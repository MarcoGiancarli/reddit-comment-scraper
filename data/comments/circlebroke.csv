That’s okay for the guys at the top — but for the guys at the bottom, who stand to lose more status, that’s very threatening.   In my opinon, this basically explains the huge amount of sexism and harrasment within both tech and gaming communities/industries. When there are no women (or near as none) then there may be casual sexism, but not hugely as there isn't a target. It's all guys. When, however, women start to try and enter these unofficially male-only realms, because duh they have as much right as anyone else, then loser men get defensive and lash out.

I'm not anti-porn at all, but I'm also not going to buy into the myth that everyone there is just happy as a fucking lark with everything we see onscreen. I have found that guys who watch a lot of porn are stubbornly insistent that anybody who describes a scene like this one must be lying, even though the impetus for doing so is pretty low. They know on some level that often they will be watching a girl who really doesn't want to be there and was probably abused prior to/during filming, but they just don't want to know. And I suppose that's justifiable. What is NOT justifiable is calling somebody a liar because their lived experience gives your hard-on a sad. Fuck these guys, seriously. They're garbage."

circlebroke,3dzyxo,heterosis,8,Tue Jul 21 05:15:55 2015 UTC,"I personally doubt anything is going to happen to igthft, basement or otherwise. That said, traffic in igthft is comparable to c-town (which either shows just how popular they are, or how poorly recieved the policies I've implemented in igthft are. IDK.), so maybe the admins will be willing to take the revenue hit. Who knows?   Would that negatively impact the mods our user base and do you think it's the right call?   I'm pretty indifferent there. We'll keep on doing our thing modwise whether we're on /r/all or not. Might see a slowdown on subscriber growth due to the hypothetical no more /r/all advertising but I'm pretty sure word of mouth would still work out in our favor."
circlebroke,3dzyxo,GodOfAtheism,2,Tue Jul 21 05:33:13 2015 UTC,"It occurs to me that from a mod perspective it would be better to be in the basement.  If you're in the general populace the expectation may be that you're filtering out hate speech and just generally keeping the sub more in line.  Being tucked away is kind of a license to loosen the moderation reigns, or put another way, to enforce the rules that you think are important.

circlebroke,3dzyxo,my_online_alias,44,Mon Jul 20 22:19:08 2015 UTC,We should really show some level of positivity here. Yeah it took them a few days to do it for some reason and yeah reddit still has a long way to go in terms of getting itself really cleaned up.  At that though they took a step in the right direction and followed through on one of the things they said they'd do.  If the shit lords get mad at the for banning the sub and then the social justice types get mad at them for not doing enough it becomes not really worth it and even less will get done.  Good job admins. Hopefully we'll see more progress in the future.

Are there really this many people who hate others because of skin color? It's disgusting how rampant racism is on Reddit. Don't get me wrong, I know not even the majority is racist, but when a site is as big as Reddit, that's still a lot of people. It's sickening to see how when a Black person is being scummy it's because he's Black, but if the White John Smith is scummy, it's because he is individually scummy.   Another point I'd like to make is that Reddit is mostly white so that probably wouldn't get so popular anyway. If anything it would probably encourage people to join CT.  And lastly and most importantly, we're better than that. I understand your anger, but not all of Reddit is like this. We would be fighting the monsters but also become the monsters ourselves by doing the very thing we are against. I am against all racism.  TL;DR: I completely understand your anger but racism is not the way. It will make offended whites join ct. By fighting racism with racism we become the racists."

Translation: I have no moral apprehensions about actually murdering/raping someone as long as I'm being punished.   And the guy wrote this   Are you really that dumb? In this fairness system the highest score would be given if the woman that falsely accuses a man of rape gets punished for it, and the man that sits behind bars without doing anything is either compensated or commits a crime that would make the sentencing fair. This way severity of punishments fit severity of crimes comitted. Obviously if the man commits a crime against a person that need not be punished, that would not work very well, so he commits a crime against that woman that has yet to be punished. In a world where jail is used for punishment obviously one effective way to get the fairness score up without involving courts that think you're already a rapist, would be to rape the woman yourself as her punishment. How else do you make the situation fair? This way you hit two birds with one stone, she gets punished, and instead of you being compensated you commit the crime to fit the punishment you've already been given and served. Translation: I have no moral apprehensions about actually raping someone that accused me of raping her. As I've said before this system is pretty dumb, yet it works very well. Certainly better than a situation where the woman is neither put in jail or raped."

Like its not hard. Just don't go to subs that trigger you or whatever.  People today just always need something to complain about.

circlebroke,3dy2cx,Brickhead816,5,Tue Jul 21 01:26:21 2015 UTC,"No. It's literally exchanging information about how to rape people and encouraging others to do it. Even if the stories are fictional, they're encouraging it in real life scenarios. Hence, the rule against calling to harm other people is called into action. They're breaking a reddit rule, so they go. And nothing of worth was lost.   50 shades is written entirely as fiction and doesn't literally tell people ""here's how you do this"". It's definitely not without its problems and huge amount of cristicism because of its stupid depiction of BDSM culture and consent.   Either way, comparing Rapingwomen to Gay marriage is really. Really. Really fucking ridiculous. Consenting adults getting married isn't the same as bastards exchanging rape tips."

THESE ARE NOT REMOTELY SIMILAR AND IT IS BOTH OFFENSIVE TO GAY PEOPLE AND HARMFUL TO GAY PEOPLE AS A WHOLE TO COMPARE THEM. Being gay isn't inherently predatory.  You being attracted to girls your age isn't wrong, but saying that pedophilia in general is okay because you're currently attracted to girls your age is a huuuuuuge leap in logic. I was attracted to girls that age when I was that age too, but that doesn't last forever unless you are actually a pedophile.   Care to refute them one by one or will you dismiss them because you know they're correct?   First of all, can I jsut say how much I hate this shit?

We gave you reasons and you ignored them and yelled ""FALLACY"" at us and ignored everything.  This is nothing like what people used to feel for gays. Actual pedophilia (again, you're not a pedophile for liking 16 year old girls while you are also 16) is inherently predatory. Two grown gay men or women are fine in a consensual relationship. A grown adult and a child are inherently not equals in the relationship, or society, meaning the entire premise of the relationship is null.   sex is not inherently harmful or predatory as long as consent is obtained   Yeah, but children can't give meaningful consent to sex. There are so many reasons why that I don't have the kind of time or patience to explain them all to you. Also, maybe I didn't express earlier how much I despise you calling them pedosexuals.   Love is timeless and age is just a number.   ""Love is timeless"" and pedophilia are inherently at odds. If you're only attracted to children, the relationship will, by definition, not last forever. Even if the child falls in love contracts Stockholm Syndrome, the adult pedophile will lose interest, abandon them and leave them an emotional wreck following years of abuse."

But I think one of our token black subscribers put it better than I probably ever will. I think he gives the comments too much credit but I agree generally:    I know it's all in good fun mostly but this place comes across as a misguided and unintentionally negative minstrel show on some infrequent occasions  I love the content here and often the comments make everything funnier and I like how we can connect and discuss the post like ""Yeah I hate it when chicks do that my ex did blah blah."" I really enjoy the stories  and how people relate and add describe their experiences and I can really relate a lot of the time- this is my favourite sub to pass the time on.  The thing is that it's not so much that people ""try too hard to speak cool or 'black'"" it's just how ridiculous the sub looks when suddenly the act is dropped like a hot pan and the minstrel show ends. Not everyone does this by the way and it's not often at all.  Like this sub pokes fun at a lot of things associated with black people sometimes (in good taste) but if you go on SRD to see the record, shit hits the fan sometimes when a lighthearted white joke is made.  People here are cool as shit but it makes the sub look weird when someone is doing over the top ""you feel me cuh, I don't mess around cuh. I hate dem ratchet thots"" but everywhere else on Reddit they type like a harvard professor.  And also, they do an over the top ebonics thing but whenever a white joke comes up or they feel an opportunity to air grievances about black people come up- suddenly the black face paint is wiped off real quick. Suddenly everyone starts typing in that eloquent and scholarly english as they talk about reasons black people/culture sucks or why a joke about white people ""isn't fair"" and so on.  Again let me say, people here are awesome and really not mean-spirited and some of you guys are funny as fuck. It's just something I've noticed about the sub, it doesn't happen that often though.  /u/damdam019, I'm a black brit so from one European to another I'd just say speak how ever you want lol. I know some Lithuanian people that are more ""hood"" than me and love Kanye and all that shit and Russian, French or German people that are really good at rapping.   I don't think you should feel you can't express yourself how you want if it's enjoyable for you. I just think people should be mindful that it doesn't seem like an act and a weird sort of degradation thing if they suddenly drop it at convenience and I don't know how to explain but just be weird about it, like pretend to be black then all of a sudden talk white when they wanna diss blacks."

It's about whether a non-racist person would be persuaded/converted to be racist on the basis of the joke or whether a ""mild racist"" would be made worse. A lot of liberal people are inclined either just to say ""this contains X therefore its making X worse"" (race, gender, sex, ...rape, etc.) and that simply isnt the case.   I can't think of any right-wing comedians/tv-show writers of that kind - fam guy, south park, etc. all have quite far-left people in charge of them.

circlebroke,3dxcue,DubTeeDub,3,Mon Jul 20 13:59:11 2015 UTC,Given Reddit's userbase and the fact the admins seem happy with it being mostly a reactionary shithole I don't think there really is anything you can do short of not allowing comments at all. Reddit isn't a site that can handle something like BPT in a mature fashion.
circlebroke,3dxcue,CarmineCerise,6,Mon Jul 20 15:15:23 2015 UTC,"I think they can, but it just takes time.  /r/blackpeoplegifs has been around for close to three years and if you go into the comments there you rarely if ever see people trying to talk black.  I think the difference between the two subs though is that one grew slowly and organically and the only people left after this much time are those that are part of the community, know the rules, and behave well.  BPT on the other hand blew up essentially overnight without building up that community understanding of what is and is not acceptable."
circlebroke,3dxcue,maslowk,7,Mon Jul 20 15:17:13 2015 UTC,BPT also hits /r/all pretty frequently so you have to deal with that a lot more than /r/blackpeoplegifs does.

Blackpeopletwitter is filled with racists who are part of the community, can you not see the fact that constantly a space posting self deprecating black humour onto a 80% white website is inherently flawed?    If some users try to speak in AAVE, yeah its cringey, but it shouldn't mean the subreddit gets shutdown.    But that's just it. Even if you get rid of the people acting like fools or openly mocking black people with racial slurs it's still a place where white people go to laugh at black people.  There wont ever be a point were a community of 8`0% white people laughing at a picture where a black person mocks another black person or part of their culture is okay.

These people also liked rap music and black actors and whatnot.

That if I disagree with a woman I am automatically sexist    ...   Marriage makes no sense for men.  There is no reason for the modern male to ever marry.  It tethers his future and freedom to a document that will NEVER end in his favor when things fall apart. Expansion on the above: modern women are not trustworthy.   ...   Forming close friendships with girls is just dumb imo.Especially if you are attracted to them. Better keep a safe distance.Nota lot common b/w the struggles of both the genders.   ...   boudaries... women have no concept of boundaries. I want to be left alone means I want to be left alone. I'm not your pet project, and I will never be a better man once you ""fix"" me   ...   The intellectual credibility of the current wave of feminism. What a bunch of buzzfeed fueled garbage.   ...   That complaining about something endlessly without trying to solve it themselves or even listening to possible solutions is okay. I know you want to vent and that's therapeutic, but holy crap...   ...   Men's rights isn't a hate group, some of us just legitimately want to see our kids.   ...   The morality of preferring younger women, sluts, and open relationships.  I don't get along well with prudish single women over 30 who want to ""settle down"" and think their dating market sucks just because they didn't cash in when they were actually somewhat hot.   ...   One of the things that is so hard to get women to understand is to empathize with the fact that we live in a time where classic masculinity is debased, chastised, and looked down upon at the same time that we live where classic masculinity is expected.    ...

Its screwed up from someone that's a STEM major that constantly whines about how she doesn't get the same opportunity as the men. I don't even know what to think.   ...   This is how girls primarily play the social game, and guys play the ""do the right thing"" game. in other words, when faced with trouble, I always notice that guys try to find the correct solution, and girls go to their friends and try to create social alliances.   ...   I have been married and divorced twice.  Both times I was the one initiating the divorce procedure of course with plenty of notice and no surprises; and after trying for years to solve issues. In the eyes of my female friends, I am the bad guy since I left them.   ...   The differences in dating and sexual relationships for men and women. I've gotten into numerous arguments with two of my closest lady friends about it. They think the experiences are more or less the same, I assure them they aren't.   ...   I was legitimately scared when I found out some of my female friends really believed that heterosexual sexual assault could only happen to women. Apparently ""all men want it"".    ...   Women have to lower their standards and go through fear of rejection just like men do.    ...   I get so infuriated over the people who do not understand the 77 cents statistic.    ...   Well you're what's known as an egalitarian.     ..   When we want to have a guys night, the girlfriends/wives showing up defeats the purpose.

Last week, I was going through some of our old stuff.   She didn't have a moment of indecision and hesitate to tell the full story. She said nothing for 3 months.

Igthft is supposed to be about offensive jokes, it's not created for sheltering bigots. Even if that's what most users use it for, that's not its purpose and not (completely) their fault that people use it as such."
circlebroke,3e0ij0,golfball1111,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:34:58 2015 UTC,"It was created to hate on black people and used for hating black people.   Which sub are we talking about here. I fail to see the difference between the two subs other than /r/imgoingtohellforthis hiding their views behind comedy, as well as hating disabled people too. It may look like a joke but it has the same effect as a sub like coontown.   Either accept both subs or accept neither."
circlebroke,3e0ij0,JesterOfDestiny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:16:10 2015 UTC,"Huge difference. Coontown was created to talk shit about black people, igthft was created to make offensive jokes. One is racist, the other is funny, if you're into that kind of stuff.  Yes, igthft became a hiding place for bigots, but that wasn't its original intention. That's why I recommended the heavy moderation, so it may return to being an offensively funny sub."
circlebroke,3e0ij0,golfball1111,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:23:14 2015 UTC,"They're using misfortune to make people happy. That's exactly what both subs do, they prey on the weak and use it for their own good. If one sub stays, both should stay. There really is no difference apart from the way the content is delivered."
circlebroke,3e0ij0,JesterOfDestiny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:27:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand the point of black comedy. It's not preying on the weak, it's laughing at things that aren't normally accepted to laugh at. I'd also make the distinction between black comedy and edgyness. Black comedy is funny even though it's offensive, that's  what igthft supposed to be. Edgyness is just saying offensive things and not really having any comedic value, that's what coontown is.  Also, I'm not in the camp that wants coontown gone. I'd support the decision, but I'm not actively rallying against it. However the banning of igthft would seem arbitrary, as it became what it is, because people don't understand black comedy."
circlebroke,3e0ij0,golfball1111,2,Tue Jul 21 19:39:44 2015 UTC,"I know very well what black comedy is, but the sub does not contain pure black comedy, it's more Johnny Rebel than South Park i.e. it uses comedy to push its own racist and ableist views in the same vein as coontown, except disguising the views as comedy.  That sub has more edginess than black comedy, one of the posts is a picture of a couple with their dead child. That's trying to be more edgy, you can tell as the comments try hard to show their lack of empathy and sympathy for something like this, rather than appreciation of the ""Joke"".   Both subs should stay in my opinion as they have the same effect on society, and that's what these new reddit rules are based on, how they affect people."

circlebroke,3dvk4g,Possible_Novelty,-1,Mon Jul 20 03:04:59 2015 UTC,Why is it our business to say OP is a terrible person but not his business to say the kid is fat?
circlebroke,3dvk4g,gaviidae,26,Mon Jul 20 03:22:01 2015 UTC,It was probably his  birthday. Only a savage wouldn't eat unhealthy on their birthday. Insulting a kid (or his parents) for eating candy on his birthday  is like insulting a dog for barking.
circlebroke,3dvk4g,Mr_McChicken_420,6,Mon Jul 20 00:10:50 2015 UTC,I wasn't commenting on the occasion at all. Obviously enjoying some sweets on your birthday isn't going to turn a healthy kid into one that is at risk for further health problems because of their weight. A parent lets their child reach a dangerous weight from the culmination of bad habits.
circlebroke,3dvk4g,Possible_Novelty,14,Mon Jul 20 00:34:24 2015 UTC,"Look, it's much harder said than done. If a parent has trouble dealing with their habits, then they'll probably transfer it to their children. And the cycle continues. Can you really call them bad parents because of that?"
circlebroke,3dvk4g,Mr_McChicken_420,5,Mon Jul 20 03:02:04 2015 UTC,It's also pretty normal to be a little chubby as a kid. I looked a little like the kid in the picture until I hit puberty and things sorted themselves out on their own.
circlebroke,3dvk4g,alskjde,3,Mon Jul 20 11:08:22 2015 UTC,"Can you really call them bad parents because of that?   Yes.  You absolutely can.  If you're putting your child's health in danger, then it's absolutely no excuse to argue that the other way is hard."
circlebroke,3dvk4g,Khiva,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:43:13 2015 UTC,"Not enough to say about this kid's parents from one picture with no context, but in general, parents should be looking out for their kid's health. And it's not that being overweight or obese makes someone a bad parent, at all. But parents have a lot more control over what their kids eat than what they eat themselves, because as an adult, it's a lot easier to ""cheat."" Not everyone with adult responsibilities is going to eat even vaguely right, or get regular physical activity, but it's pretty fucking easy to get your kid to do those things. And if someone's kid isn't doing those things, long-term, the parent is probably being neglectful and needs to try a bit harder."
circlebroke,3dvk4g,j_damp,-4,Mon Jul 20 14:05:58 2015 UTC,OP's parents probably were blunt too and transferred that bluntness to their children. Why can you call OP a terrible person but it's wrong for OP to say they are probably bad parents?
circlebroke,3dvk4g,gaviidae,8,Mon Jul 20 03:23:39 2015 UTC,"We also don't know if the kid has a condition, taking medication that causes weight gain...etc so let's not judge the parents either."

Okay, I know that a suntan is not the healthiest thing. But saying it will ruin a woman's skin by the age of 25 is just hysterical bullshit. Honestly I see stuff in this vein all the time and it bugs the shit out of me. The guys who make up the prevailing demographic on reddit have a bizarre affinity for all these weird old wives' tales about women. Sun exposure will render a girl a hag at 25. Menopause usually begins between 35 and 40. Too many sexual partners will stretch and ruin a vagina (but not, oddly, a bunch of sex with just one guy). Any woman over the age of 35 should not get pregnant and if she does she should abort immediately, because the baby will almost certainly have birth defects because of her old eggs. All women expect men to pay for every date. And on and on. Just all this ridiculously old-timey crap that's easily debunked but that they seem to actively prefer to believe."

She certainly wasn't the norm, but I grew up in the nineties where pale was the worst thing a white person could be and the risks of tanning beds were in the midst of being revealed. The woman I knew probably grew up during the same era and cultivated a rather deep tan on her not-particularly-susceptible-to-an-even-tan skin type. She paid a price for her three trips to the tanning bed per well for 7 years.  I really don't have an issue with tanning.  I think the blowback against tanning is rather inflated due to the proliferation of ""scientific evidence"" saying that tanning beds are pretty much the worst thing you can do to your skin (outside of the radiation treatment that was done to teens in the 60s).  I have noticed a massive reduction in the number of white teens going tanning versus my teenage years."

America, as one of the largest media exporters in the world, would like to protect its businesses and all the people employed as a result of media production, distribution, and retail in other national markets, and redditors want to stream shit for free.

If not for piracy, I wouldn't have been able to watch lots of shows I wouldn't have seen if I used services available in my country (given avoiding geo-block is piracy too). So if you're unable to get content using legal ways, using illegal ones is something you can't avoid. But if you can and you're pirating anyway, it's wrong.  Also, some were concerned with corporations being able to sue governments and something about NHS and similar public health services being privatized, I don't recall what was exactly about that."

Read here, Washington post   [A clause in TPP] would allow foreign companies to challenge U.S. laws — and potentially to pick up huge payouts from taxpayers — without ever stepping foot in a U.S. court. Here’s how it would work. Imagine that the United States bans a toxic chemical that is often added to gasoline because of its health and environmental consequences. If a foreign company that makes the toxic chemical opposes the law, it would normally have to challenge it in a U.S. court. But with [this clause], the company could skip the U.S. courts and go before an international panel of arbitrators. If the company won, the ruling couldn’t be challenged in U.S. courts   TPP as is fine for the most part but this clause is really really bad news.  EDIT: Also, I'm European, we don't give payouts to companies just because laws were changed. This would change for us, therefore I might be especially pissed about this."

From a karma/justice standpoint I want that, but the problem is for the falsely accused, you wouldn't I want a big incentive for the lying bitch to keep the lie going. You want anything to decrease your chances of staying out of jail.    Which is weird, because the narrative of the falsely accused always having their life ruined is not true. But, hey! let's keep this crazy train going and punish lawyers for pursuing cases we don't like.   Maybe the DA needs to be punished for poor judgment.

Your original example was torrent sites putting up liability waivers, which I think doesn't really support your point considering that the guys who run torrent sites are regularly sued into oblivion (or even imprisoned), regardless of whether they disavow responsibility or not  Its like those signs on the backs of gravel trucks that say ""not responsible for broken windshields."" there's nothing preventing construction companies from putting those signs on their trucks, but in practice it's been determined a bunch of times that they don't actually hold up as a waiver of liability"
circlebroke,3drweb,moocowfuckmilk,5,Sun Jul 19 03:02:42 2015 UTC,"Torrent sites was a lazy example, yeah, although the TPB founders were acquitted recently I believe.

I dunno, I'm not a lawyer (obviously), but I am cynical enough to think that profit trumps morality pretty much every time. I'd like to be wrong, really, but in the case of Reddit I don't see them doing anything different unless they get enough bad press and/or indicted for being a facilitator for hate groups."

Is it just a fetish and you wouldn't randomly rape a woman.   Most of the comments said I just like really rough porn and sex and this goes hand in hand. I'd never truly tape a woman.   OK sure you like the rough stuff. Whatever, fine.  Only on reddit would there be other comments saying they actually like and want to rape women because they actually deep down want it.  To make it even worse there has been so much more unmitigated shit on here over the years that you can't even pass it off as ""oh they're probably trolling."""
circlebroke,3drweb,pdxpython,7,Sun Jul 19 02:31:42 2015 UTC,"OK sure you like the rough stuff. Whatever, fine.   Even if it is strictly fantasy, why participate on a sub where at least some of the people are completely okay with raping women?   Only on reddit would there be other comments saying they actually like and want to rape women because they actually deep down want it.   I cringe everything I'm linked to a post on TRP and there's a guy talking about how his wife always said no to sex and the he stopped taking no for an answer, but it's okay because the wife really wanted it and it improved their relationship so much.  Ugh...  I have a feeling that, regardless of what changes, Reddit is still going to be in the running for rapiest site on the Internet."
circlebroke,3drweb,New_Wav,2,Sun Jul 19 05:07:55 2015 UTC,"Even if it is strictly fantasy, why participate on a sub where at least some of the people are completely okay with raping women?   I don't really know. I guess some people just want to be part of the community of people who roleplay and fantasize it and will tolerate the really awful people who come with it or to it for other reasons.  As someone else pointed out there has to be well moderated communities that encourage roleplay and fantasy without actual acts of violence. You'd also think the people into the fantasy would denounce others that make their community look like shit. Reddit is so backwards though that people will tolerate it as free speech or some horseshit.   there's a guy talking about how his wife always said no to sex and the he stopped taking no for an answer, but it's okay because the wife really wanted it and it improved their relationship so much.   People who insist marital rape isn't a thing are beyond me. If your wife is into come home and hold me down and fuck me type stuff more power to you but you really should like I don't know... communicate honestly to see if that is something she is into or not. Because someone just forcing themselves upon someone at any point without some kinda prior arrangement is disgusting."
circlebroke,3drweb,pdxpython,4,Sun Jul 19 09:12:44 2015 UTC,"There's even an active sub that literally just for rape fetishes: /r/rape_roleplay.

Why aren't the people who are into the rough stuff subscribed there instead?"
circlebroke,3drweb,ChickenInASuit,2,Sun Jul 19 18:32:33 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm not defending /r/rapingwomen.  I'm ok with people wanting to role play that stuff. More power to them.

Of behaving inter-personally to the same standards that girls and women are held to.  The longer we accept it as ""biotroofs"" that boys and men are ""scum"" as default, or if left to their own devices, the longer it will take to free all people from harmful and limiting gender roles and social scripts."

After all, he feels alone because you rejected him.""  This situation just hits really close to home for me. One of my guy friends got too into one of my girl friends and just expected her to reciprocate. She didn't, but she was nice about mending things afterward and followed that do/do not list almost play by play. Then it happened again. And again. Because she was nice the first time, it reinforced his behavior to the point where he burned his last bridge and she refuses to be in the same building with him any more. It created a rift inside our circle of friends because we then had to pick and choose who we wanted to hang out with more.

Claiming that women are in charge, oppressing you, and lying about it means that all evidence against you is just proof of the conspiracy.  If your ideology can turn all data into confirmation, you can endure through anything."

It tells you a lot about that person.   Whisper has (as I learned in his history) been a part of TRP for 6 years. That is 6 years he could've been a productive and normal human being.

circlebroke,3dqg75,acedis,46,Sat Jul 18 14:33:55 2015 UTC,"Geez, I though this post would end up about 1/4th as long as it turned out in the end when I started typing. Oh well, here goes. tl;dr: White boys turn sexist and/or racist because people with an agenda feed on their blindness to the world around them and the karma system enables that behavior.  Growing up into a fairly comfortable life, without anyone telling or showing you how there are other people who don't have it as good, is an easy route to a narrow worldview. Many teenagers want to express themselves in one way or another, and for some people this manifests as strong political opinions on how this one easy trick can save the world.  When I was 16 or 17, one of the political standpoints I stumbled upon was the surface MRA rhetoric. I didn't have any real experience of sexism, so while I probably wouldn't have consciously thought it didn't exist, it was an abstract concept for me. And I wasn't exposed to any of the ugly stuff going on in MRA circles that could act as early warning signs of nutjobs. Luckily at the time, I also hung out with a few people who were more than ready to call me out on my bullshit. Having to argue for my opinions to people I trusted about their experiences meant looking at them critically and realizing which ones were unsubstantiated. I got my head out of my ass because I had people around who responded to idiocy when they saw it. None of that was to my credit; an open mind is something you have to constantly develop, and saying ""I have an open mind"" is a surefire way to stop developing it.  This sappy storytime leads in to the main point, namely why I think the Reddit defaults (and by extension the harmful groups that soapbox freely on them) are so dangerous. I'm going to extrapolate how I think some people end up in the trench based on my own blindness to fucked up reasoning back then. Say you are a teenaged white boy, or a young adult who never had to challenge their viewpoints. You're hanging out on /r/videos or /r/adviceanimals, smiling at funny or relatable content and talking about it in the comments. You see someone make a racist joke, and you laugh and upvote because you've heard of that stereotype. You're not racist in the sense of believing in the stereotype, but you have also never experienced the consequences of racism. It does not occur to you that propagating the stereotype could be hurtful to people, why wouldn't it be harmless fun?  But hanging out with perceived allies in a casual environment is Metal Gear level stealth tech against your critical thinking. Soon you'll see someone make a slightly political response, perhaps replying to an absent strawman and talking about how there is nothing racist or sexist about those jokes, and you won't question it. You'll see the same usernames make heavier political statements, and you won't question them. Soon, you'll start taking the MRA/'race realist' political submissions seriously. Soon, you'll start feeling bothered when early birds get your own political comments down to negative score before your allies can come in and plus it back up. You'll start hanging out more in subs where those people do not. And just like that, you're trapped. You've become one of them without even noticing the transition, because it's not overt or hostile. It creeps up like a corruption through nice words and dank memes.  Now, this isn't to excuse any behavior. Rather the opposite, because calling it out before it's too late worked on me and I see no reason why it wouldn't work on anyone else. I also don't think this is how everyone gets into those groups. In the more extremist subs like coontown I think you're just as if not more likely to pick a sociopath out of a random sample of active users. But for people with no real life experience of discrimination, never having anyone around to talk sense into you can make just about anything seem reasonable. And when hundreds of thousands of people with that vulnerability gather in a corner of the internet where mutual agreement is such a visible and incentivized currency like Karma, a slide down the slippery slope is just bound to happen. Some people like /u/future-madscientist manage to help themselves through an epiphany. Others just never do."

circlebroke,3dqg75,Deutschmarxist,33,Sun Jul 19 19:11:15 2015 UTC,"All it takes is for someone to read the wrong thing at the right time in their life. You're feeling particularly disempowered and disenfranchised, you see something that validates how you're feeling and enables you to shift that responsibility onto someone or something else and makes you feel better about the situation you are in, then you dip your toe in and find that sense of belonging and camaraderie that many of those ""movements"" provide. It's then an echochamber that re-enforces it's own beliefs and dogma which naturally becomes more hyperbolic and extreme as it sheds its less ""dedicated"" and ""non-believing"" members through ostracism for not conforming to the general message, sentiment and ""goal"" (which is frequently and purposely ill-defined). It's the same thing with Gamergate, and the fact that there is a large crossover there is no coincidence, obviously.  The word ""cult"" is likely a little too strong, but many of the same concepts apply. The really common thing among these groups is that they attract people on negative concepts, rather than positive. They seek and consume the weak and the unhappy. They are absolutely opportunistic and destructive."
circlebroke,3dqg75,DJGiblets,23,Sun Jul 19 01:07:43 2015 UTC,"I think TRP is really interesting. I'm a pretty staunch liberal and self-described feminist, but I'm a straight male so it definitely tries to speak to me, even if I don't agree with it. I dislike just about everything to do with TRP, but I will admit, it has a very appealing message for young, disenfranchised men.   On the surface it just seems like tools for self improvement. A lot of their ideas make sense as long as you don't take them too literally. They talk a lot about SMV (Sexual market Value), which basically boils down to: If you want cool, good looking girls to like you, you better be cool and good looking also. It encourages these down and out men to take a look at undesirable traits and change them. And once again, on the surface, that's actually pretty admirable, but it's when you start to look at men and women as tools and walking SMVs that it gets really unhealthy.  Basically though, once you get hooked by sugar-coated introductory lessons, that's when the real misogyny comes out, and it's hard to say no when you're surrounded by so many like-minded peers, and the sub seems to have made positive changes in your life.  I have a friend who actually fits this mold pretty well. In high school he was lanky and awkward, but he had a massive growth spurt and was 6'2"" as we headed off to university. He spent another four years being kind of awkward still but making his way into the business world. Now we're recently graduated, and he's got a good consulting job and got really into fashion, fitness, and developing his social skills. This is all really good stuff, and was definitely spurred a bit by things like TRP and other similar psuedo-science bro forums. The problem is though that he's definitely on the tipping point of diving into some of the darker philosophies. The other day we had a debate about whether women had it easier in the dating world. TRP has a very male-centric view on this that he subscribed to, and it was hard to convince him that women have to deal with a lot of issues that just aren't part of the narrative we often see in media.  Basically, although I dislike TRP, it has some good tenants that lure people in if they don't feel the most confident in themselves. It becomes like a welcoming fraternity where all the members encourage each other to do better. The big problem of course though is that they eventually try to simplify relationships and make everything about hooking up with girls, and encourage each other to do things that I don't agree with."
circlebroke,3dqg75,Bartweiss,19,Sat Jul 18 15:33:02 2015 UTC,"This nails a point that I think a lot of people talking about conspiracies and self-reinforcing hatred don't catch.  TRP, more than mensrights or similar, offers a road to actual self-improvement and progress (along with misogyny and hate).  Feeling persecuted is satisfying, but it's way easier to get drawn into if you actually see some real-life benefits from your new beliefs as well.  The core advice on TRP is something like ""get fit, get rich, don't let your life revolve around anyone else"".  For a lovelorn 20 year old, this has real value - TRP is one viable road out of being the creepy, stereotypical 'nice guy'.  It tells you that you can be successful, but that no one is going to hand you wealth, success, or sex unless you work hard and become a worthwhile person.  This is actually a breakthrough for the disaffected white college guy that's their primary audience, it's just that the breakthrough is framed by a paranoid and sexist worldview.  What's awful is that the persecution complex is what enables the breakthrough.  If you've lived a comfortable but unsuccessful life, and been taught that you're owed sex, wealth, and power, you're not likely to accept the message ""that was all bullshit and no one owes you shit"".  You're way more likely to accept the message ""life is a power struggle, and you have to fight for whatever you get because evil forces are opposing you"".  TRP offers a prescription to improve the lives of a very specific group of people that are unlikely to listen to conventional advice.  By providing an 'enemy', it convinces people to work for what they think they're owed."

I saw myself as charming (I wasn't) so I started to get frustrated.   If I had seen this group and its writings that basically sold me a ""girls will like you"" pill I would have swallowed it completely.

TRP likes to pretend to spin this as a bad thing to prove its authenticity (""do you think acknowledging I'm a beta was easy?!"") when it's actually the complete opposite.  When you feel as though your life is spinning out of control, whether it be because someone just broke your heart or because you don't understand why no one will touch your heart with a ten foot pole, TRP is there to tell you that you have all the power, and if you just do X, Y, and Z you will get everything you want."

The only thing you can do to stop me debating it is ban me, too. Then you can ban all the people who object to banning me. And so forth.   You can bitch and moan all you like, but me and my team aren't going to be responsible for encouraging behaviors that lead to hate.   That's exactly what are doing to when you take it upon yourselves to allow this opinion and not that one. A man is only responsible for that which he controls. No control, no responsibility. You did not make him say what he said.  You were not responsible for it. I say were not. Now you are. Because you took it upon yourself to arbitrate. To impose control. Now you have made yourselves responsible for anything that gets said here. Because you could have stopped it.  We always want to compromise our principles when we stand to get hurt, or when we stand to profit, or when those principles protect something we find distasteful. But once you compromise a principle, it's not a principle any longer. It's window dressing.  Those who wish to impose control on what others may think or say always have some excuse that sounds reasonable. They're protecting you from the racists. Or the communists. Or the captialist-imperialist warmongers. Or the pedophiles. Or the witches.  But it's always just that, an excuse. There's no actual danger that they wish to prevent. They simply wish to stop others from saying that which they find distasteful.  For what is the real danger in allowing a man to say ""nigger""? Is that word so persuasive that people are going to see things his way? Are small, narrow, petty ideologies really that much stronger than open, free, and progressive ones?

Yishan and many other admins (spez included) say a lot of things that sound like bullshit to me, too, but I think they're really trying to have a platform that respects other people's opinions, even if those opinions is gravely misguided. The biggest problems is that they give room to trolls (yes trolls, most of them aren't even legit racists) and, well, actual racist. If it was up to me, they'd still handle things like this post shows. But I can respect that they are trying to be tolerant. Spez might very well want to go back to how things were handled back in the day, but I don't think it's as easy as turning on a switch.  He didn't ban that sub because he said, he'd only ban it after mods have gotten the tools to handle what ever potential shit steering banning that sub (and probably a lot of others) would have.

circlebroke,3doifk,toaster-cat,21,Sat Jul 18 10:31:25 2015 UTC,"SCOTUS even ruled that way recently. The Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that policies that segregate minorities in poor neighborhoods, even if they do so unintentionally, violate the Fair Housing Act. The thinking is that the result is discrimination based on race (racial segregation in housing for the purposes of that case), and that the intentions behind the policies that create those results are irrelevant in the face of the actual results of those policies.  To apply the same logic to Reddit, the policies of the admins have led to Reddit being a haven, at various points, for child pornographers, racists, sexists, bigots and people full of hate of all kinds (like the FPH sub, which doesn't really fall into a traditional -ism or the scope of bigotry). Unless forced through outside means, like say Anderson Cooper exposing the child porn, the policies of Reddit are to allow it to continue unabated, and on a surprisingly frequent basis, their policies actually punish those who try to stop the horrible shit that goes on (especially if ""doxxing"" is involved, like with the violentacrez/creepshots fiasco). They've gone so far as to say that it's a bannable offense to even mention or link a public comment/post made by someone where they reveal their own information.  The end result of these policies is that a significant portion of Reddit, not most of it mind you, but a decent portion of it that is hard to ignore, caters to bigots and hate. Because Reddit is built to allow easy access to ALL public subreddits, those people can and do easily spread to the rest of the site and sometimes brigade (you'll see it often when people comment ""/r/[Hateful Subreddit] is leaking"", but nothing is done about it). They spread their hateful ideas among the defaults and the more mindless and/or innocuous subs that cater to younger, more impressionable minds (/r/pics or /r/adviceanimals or any number of the more inane, but harmless defaults over the years) and turn them into easy recruiting grounds for their hate-subs.  Also, up until the last year or so, the admins did nothing about the Squatzis, but that's another issue all together.  tl;dr - The end result is more important than the intent when discussing whether a policy or course of action is racist."

The real problem is thinking that these opinions are originating from some particular sub/website.   When they start coming from nowhere all of a sudden, yeah, it's pretty apparent it's not just some random thing that was always here. Look at FPH over the last year or so. It quickly went from a self-contained community of fetishistic hate to one that spread that fetish to pretty much everywhere on Reddit in a matter of days and caused a LOT of drama.  When it comes to more traditional bigotry, it's easy to come off as ""edgy"" and get lots of upvotes with dog whistle racism in subs like /r/adviceanimals, /r/pics and /r/videos. Just start dropping memes and comments about ""black culture"" as an unpopular opinion puffin and watch it soar to the front page.

It pushes that subreddit into a dark corner where it will likely and hopefully atrophy into insignificance while at the same time preventing that community from becoming a martyr. While reddit is providing them a space for free, I can't imagine the marginal costs of hosting is very significant or burdensome. At the same time, by refusing to allow that subreddit to generate ad revenue, reddit has built a wall that allows them to say they don't condone that kind of speech and refuse to profit from it.

Reddit can host a ""free speech"" platform, using coontown as its flagship for demonstrating how ""free speech"" they are, while not feeding off it to appease those who are in disturbance with it.  I am in complete disagreement with everything they say and do, however, I've said it on Reddit before and I'll say it again. Keeping them here in their own sub, is safer than banning them and letting all those Reddit users loose on Reddit while feeling rejected. They'll only get stronger or more of a nuisance.  Their behaviour has worried me because they are clearly aware of the underlying racism/prejudice that exists on Reddit and they're captialising on that now. Posting subtexted photos, videos and text. They're trying to passively deliver their message by seeming harmless and THAT is what scares me, because on the surface it abides by Reddit rules, but the subtext doesn't at all.  Pretty sure they tried to get to /r/worstof recently and actually, I've become so paranoid as to feel that a recent /r/casualconversation post was their work too.

They evolve to fit the rules,  always will always do.    Personally I feel if they know they're at risk of having their sub closed if they act out of line and that there's very little string for them to pull on,  they'll keep themselves in check a lot better.

The harassment was so bad that the moderators of blackladies had to issue an open letter to Reddit admins.    In the wake of Ferguson, anonymous Reddit users on burner accounts deluged r/BlackLadies with racist posts and comments. The moderators—all volunteers, not paid Reddit employees—tried to delete the hateful content as best they could, but the entire experience exhausted and demoralized them. They contacted Reddit’s management, but were told that, because the trolls weren’t technically breaking any of the site’s core rules, there was there was nothing Reddit would do about it."

circlebroke,3doifk,robeph,-2,Sat Jul 18 13:11:17 2015 UTC,"I expect to be downvoted for this,  because, well, any lack of complete vitriolic emotional attachment to the idea of banning everything disliked,  becomes ""support""  which I don't support coontown in the least.   Won't matter to those here though,  critical thinking is clearly racist.    The guy above links to an article,  talking about ""coontown""  no where is it mentioned yet somehow he SEEMS to think that it is coontown's doing.  The inability to recognize that coontown was never mentioned is interesting to me here.   I see racists being assholes,  which is a problem,  they may even like coontown type posts,  which would make them idiots,  but being racist and even liking the content of a sub doesn't mean the ""the sub is doing this"" .     It's a bit of an association fallacy and really improper way to look at things.    That said,  I don't understand why being reasonable and looking at things from a logical standpoint or even QUESTIONING the jack boot ideology of 'ban all things!' means I have to be a racist.   I read the entire dailydot article,  I also find the section about /r/shitredditsays (known for doxing, harassing, and generally having a free pass to do so) and /r/MensRights .   Notice how the article describes SRS as ceasing their linking to /r/MensRights  because they're ""low hanging fruit""   while suggesting /r/MensRights  is allowing subs to contact their mods and request the removal of linked material noting ""subs like /r/rape""  but I suspect that the general statement coming from /r/MensRights  didn't say a thing about /r/rape.  So what we have here is SRS is good and above mensrights cos it just said 'screw it this is stupid co they're too easy to show as being idiots,  don't include the mensrights stuff'   while mensrights is allowing even stuff from /r/rape to be linked and is forcing the mods to message them first to get it removed.   So even while in truth /r/mensrights did this to address a minor problem coming from the sub (which all subs leak,  even if their intent is not negative,  when linking outside) srs gets a free pass and /r/MensRights  is made to still look a bit off by how they handled it.   /r/MensRights  is a bit of a odd sub,  I don't think it is actually misogynistic as from a cursory glance just now it seems that much of it is links to articles claiming that men are something negative in some sense.   Not a movement I really find getting behind necessary,  but it looks to be yet another case of ""defense = support for what we say you support,  not what you're actually supporting""   welcome to the world of SJW shitlogic.  It is fairly clear now that even logical discourse means you're a racist homophobic woman hater.    Banning a subreddit does nothing but placate these people,  makes them happy until they find another target to get riled up about and repeats.   This isn't so much a problem except it moves closer and closer to a point where ,  as you see with myself in this thread""  even mild disagreement is looked down upon (note the downvotes...)"

No, we are not better off having it than not."
circlebroke,3doifk,robeph,-6,Sat Jul 18 05:57:07 2015 UTC,"Except this isn't a good analogy.  Because a containment unit actually hosts a controlled group of elements.   Toxic waste,   radioactive crap,  whatever.  If we go full into the analogy.    If we place this site near a neighborhood.  It could leak,  better the leak than just tossing it out in the open sure.   But better to have it far away in Yucca mountains or something away from everyone.   Right?    This is where the analogy breaks down.   For waste as such,  the waste is controlled,  it is not a disparate lot that moves freely.  You can load it up and cart it away and it is out of the neighborhood.   People and sites like reddit.  A bit different.   It is one of multiplicity.    The member of coontown may be in 100 other subreddits,  coontown is just one.   He may have also been a member of FPH,  a general asshat all the way around.   He may also post cute pics of cats doing odd stuff in /r/awwwtf  What IS contained is the individuals behavior,  if the limits are placed it becomes much easier to recognize behaviors that are spilling out and mop that up when it occurs,  those same people are going to be just as they are,  just as racist,  and just as annoying in defaults and elsewhere subs as they are right now, with or without the sub.     The focus on the sub is silly.  It really does not add to their behavior,   but it does keep the behavior local to that sub,  else with the rules,  it'll get nuked,  and I'm sure the mods will keep their members in check.  This is preferable."
circlebroke,3doifk,_watching,14,Sat Jul 18 06:13:23 2015 UTC,"but it does keep the behavior local to that sub,    tbh analogies aside I really can't believe anyone seriously believes this while having any contact with reddit or the internet at all. /r/videos is no less racist for /r/coontown existing. FPH existing did nothing but push their unpleasantness all over the site, and now that they're gone, that's declined significantly. Hell, look at offsite - /pol/, 4chan's containment board, has basically become a culture hub and HQ for these freaks. Great containment job there."

The amount of stuff around reddit hasn't decreased except for the type of stuff that got them banned in the first place.   coontown doesn't really have that sort of problem, otherwise they'd have been banned already.  They keep their over the top shit sorted and in their sub,  and the basic racist attitudes that exist will always exist just the same on the defaults.    Suggesting otherwise is simply dishonesty.  And to be frank on the subject I think the call to ban subs like this is quite selfish... not selfish for wanting to be rid of shit stains like they are, rather selfish because really the people chanting this just want others to come and pat them on their heads for being forward thinking.   It's ridiculous and won't fix anything,  sorry.  Doesn't matter, rules are as they are now.  We'll see where things go from there."

If you ban the racist subs you'll get a couple of days of spam on other subs and then they'll tucker themselves out and fuck off to voat or wherever.

Acceptance of homosexuals is still a relatively new thing for western society, and the negative connotations of ""fag"" and ""faggot"" are really too fresh for anyone to convincingly argue that they don't mean ""extremely feminine gay man"" and that when they use that to insult someone, they're classifying gay men as worthy of ridicule simply for existing."

Racism is certainly bad, but he does kind of have a point. Religious extremism, for example, is one of the largest reasons for war in the Middle East, Africa, and various riots and terrorist attacks in India and southeast Asia. Power politics, Putin style, and corruption are two other things that are just as damaging as racism, is not, more so, to developing countries because it puts them in a rut where they can't improve the lives of their people.  I personally think that racism is a symptom of classism. People discriminate between each other based on socioeconomic status. Unfortunately, all too often, race is a good predictor of said status. Any kind of discrimination is reprehensible as long as it's malicious, and racism certainly is.  That being said, you're probably counterjerking a bit too hard here."

Take China's Uighurs for example, many of whom have been labeled as terrorists simply because they are Uighurs. Uighurs tend to be poorer than Han chinese in the same area, and are Muslims related to Turks. They are denied jobs on a frequent basis, as well as adequate housing. Not only that, they are generally restricted to western China, which is mostly desert. If you want me to take the argument closer to home, let's look at Mexicans moving to the US, either legally or illegally. Many of them are certainly below middle class, and take tough or dirty jobs many other people won't. Many don't speak English as well as the rest of Americans, and sometimes speak only Spanish to each other. They immediately mark themselves as different. This leads to xenophobia (hello Donald Trump). Since they have less money, they have to live in areas with cheaper housing and poorer schools. This starts a ""ghetto cycle,"" leaving them relatively poorer and less educated, which leads to a myriad of other problems, such as racism.

They can't even hold up their rouse that it's about health for five minutes. It's about what they value in terms of appearance.  I'm especially interested in the guy who used to be a smoker. He points out the similarities in smoking and being fat. Both are bad for your health. But he seems to believe that fat people are treated like royalty while smokers are show the curb. What world does he live in? I mean, smoking isn't exactly respected these days, but I've never seen anybody ridiculed or abused for smoking. When people want their family to quit smoking, they usually gently suggest quitting to them and offer supporting them. If that was how FPH users suggested we help fat people, I'd be totally behind them."

You can smell the sweat he broke into trying to make ""fat chicks are gross to everybody but just a few freaks so humanity shouldn't have to abide 'em"" sound so fucking tony. What I like best about this is that he didn't even bother with a desultory swipe at ""well obesity brings with it a host of health complications and blahblahblahblah"", he just went straight to trying to wrap his personal aesthetic preferences into the pseudo-science of evo psych.

circlebroke,3dmbss,potato1,46,Fri Jul 17 17:05:07 2015 UTC,"Redditeurs often use it to claim that people who support any sort of welfare, gun control, equality minded legislation, or even Hillary clinton, as a far left loons equivalent to Fred Phelps."
circlebroke,3dmbss,SisterRayVU,16,Fri Jul 17 17:41:07 2015 UTC,It's an oversimplification of complex issues like political ideologies.
circlebroke,3dmbss,wholetyouinhere,10,Fri Jul 17 18:58:05 2015 UTC,"Political scientists and theorists don't care about it at all. The only reason reddit cares about it so much is because it has a short wiki page, which actually important poli sci theories and concepts don't."
circlebroke,3dmbss,websterandy42,15,Fri Jul 17 21:19:27 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you define ""hard right"" and ""hard left."" There are also people who I would call extreme leftists and rightists that favor, essentially, no state (anarcho-syndicalists or anarcho-capitalists, respectively) for example."
circlebroke,3dmbss,websterandy42,11,Fri Jul 17 17:52:02 2015 UTC,It's kind of one-dimensional. Real Leftists with a capital-L run the gamut from Socialists to Communists and Anarchists. Many Communists believe that the ultimate elimination of the state is not realistic and many believe the intermediary proletariat run government is oppressive. Socialists usually favor a strong state.

I just think you're simply taking the joke the wrong way. But you know what, it's a conversation worth having.   And in all honesty his allowance of subs like coontown really makes you wonder.   In a way it does, but we don't really know. It's more likely that he's afraid of losing ad revenue generated by people who browse hate subreddits (who also participate in other areas of the site). Never attribute malice to what you can attribute to greed, but that's just my equally speculative stance."

If you just banned a subreddit based off singular users harassing, there would be very few subs left on this website.

This point has been brought up multiple times and has, in my opinion, been answered sufficiently. The reason the Reddit admins gave was because they weren't interested in instituting retroactive bans. They were banning for current behavior.  I haven't delved too deep into this evidence of SRS's past shitty behavior, but the one piece of information I saw of them d0xxing someone seemed highly suspect. It was simply a screenshot of an email someone receieved; something easily faked. I certainly wouldn't put it past Reddit to fake such a thing, given their depiction of SRS as the evil SJW fempire boogeyman. If SRS did partake in these activities, then shame on them.

There is such a thing as SRS and average redditors agreeing that a comment is dumb/terrible.  2) SRD thread about a user being shadowbanned, the context being something about Gawker linking to Tumblr page that doxed some users. No mention of SRS.  3) Linked thread is about an /r/antiSRS mod being doxed, no mention of SRS. The guy being doxed said that the phone calls he received sounded like teenage boys you'd hear on Xbox Live. Could've been SRS, could've been 4chan.  4) From the linked thread: ""Note, it was Adrien Chen of Gawker media who doxxed ViolentAcrez. It was not SRS.""  5) I don't have the time to go through a month of IRC chat logs. From what I scanned, there were two instances of SRS users asking for upvotes: one in an SRS thread that was being brigaded by /r/mensrights, and one for a videogame competition charity thread. No doxing. In fact, one of the users in that chat log was pointing out that a /r/mensrights user was trying to dox a woman.  6) Jesus, another IRC log? Since the person who put together this list didn't post any evidence of brigading or doxing for this, I'm assuming they didn't actually look through the log for any evidence.  7) ""Definitive"" proof of brigading on a user's post that went from +19 to +14.  8) ""Definitive"" proof that that doesn't actually prove that admins are complicit in perceived SRS brigading. Some of the links lead back to links previously listed here, making this kind of a recursive citation.   I stopped bothering to go through the list because more than half of the links don't support the claims being made, so there's not much reason to believe the rest will either. The post only appears legitimate because a giant wall of text appeals to the ""[Citation Needed]"" mindset of redditors. And even after going through and debunking a majority of them, someone can still claim that I didn't do my due diligence by debunking every single link. If this list were created in good faith, the author would have included actual quotes and explanations, not just links to entire months' worth of IRC logs or gigantic pictures of stitched together screenshots."

The majority of the userbase that this has attracted has a certain set of political views and while dissent is technically allowed and even encouraged in some places on the site, the site will always be tailored to suit this majority because of the repercussions they have shown us they can wreak on the site when we attempt to contain them. Their content and their right to share it will always have primacy over other types of content until a different demographic overtakes them as the majority. This means that the majority of our content will be politically right-leaning, anti-religion, anti-feminist and pro-racial-segregation.

circlebroke,3djpmx,WorseThanHipster,6,Fri Jul 17 01:52:13 2015 UTC,Huxley seemed to think so.  It's much more a criticism on Western capitalist countries rather than 1984 which was much more specifically about Stalinist Russia.

I think it's in England your England where he really introduces the concept he's getting at, before he's even written the book (please correct me on this, I don't have the books at hand). He's talking about what Socialism without democracy would inevitably become, so it's much more a critic of non- or pseudo-democratic socialist government than just Stalinism.   It's actually pretty impressive, therefore, when you compare it and modern North Korea."

Violent, hateful racists who wouldn't have been tolerated in the 1950s have nowhere else to go. The few who tried to migrate out (i.e. Voat) got banned and shut down (i.e. the CP fiasco) because other venues don't tolerate the pedophilia, racism, sexism, homophobia, etc., that reddit does.   If reddit bans those subs, they lose users who regularly use this platform and can't go anywhere else.

The colors, character design, surreal landscape, and bewildering visual juxtapositions are gorgeous (a red ruined earth with a giant gaping mouth, the idyllic piano set in sunlight against the fallout of Nerv HQ, the psychedelic horror of walking down those shredded stairs while Kaworu steps with total confidence, a fucking moon under the earth dredged up in the chaotic birth of a new god).   Even the little touches are just too juicy - the handheld gizmo to detonate Shinji's dome is a fucking cool little piece of tech. You can just tell that the artists involved were pouring themselves into the film, and collaborating really well with each other.  The plot itself transcends the very world Anno created in the TV series leading up to End of Eva - a world that changed animation and gave viewers a completely new and bizarre way to end a story. They say there are something like 23 story archetypes to tell. End of Eva offered something very special. And then Anno did the impossible and took us beyond End of Eva - I respect him so much for that.  Anyway back to 3. The music, the visuals, the action, the mystery, everything is there. It's fantastic. We see 10 minutes of straight-up Eva on Eva battling at the end. We see Unit 13's ascension into this blinding white freakmachine godling at the end. It's so good.   That's why I like it.    Now you seem so smug, chiding about Avengers and all, I'd challenge you to name 5 really good films. That's all. Just name 5 good examples of cinema-as-art."

He can do whatever the hell wants in my opinion. Live action Ebichu? Go for it. Godzilla reboot? Have at.  It's all just personal preference at the end of the day, but for me, Anno is my main man.  90s kids remember ordering fansubbed VHS copies of End of Eva for $3 off the nascent internet back in the day.  Watching EoE at the age of 14 probably has a lot to do with why I favor him so much.  But, to each his own."

Advertisers don't pay Reddit based on the quality and content of subreddits, they pay Reddit based on the market demographics of their end users. Beyond that, most of Reddit's gold income comes from individual users buying for themselves. Unless opting in to shitposting mode makes you immune to/ineligible for Reddit Gold, I don't see how this is going to have much of an impact on their bottom line.

I used to work in PR. I used to teach introductory PR. Now I'm a professor who, among other things, teaches about and researches online communities.   How do you, STRICTLY FROM THE PR STANDPOINT, not just ban the outright racist subs. Make it a site-wide policy that racism won't be tolerated at the sub-creation level. I get that you cannot ban racism as a concept. You cannot force every sub at every level to have some kind of expressed anti-racism clause in their guidelines. Just based on awful human nature, someone is always going to post something racist to /r/pics and it'll probably always get upvoted.   All it takes is the admins saying ""Hey, you know what? No subs that exist JUST for racism. Banning them. Bye.""   You know how much good press that gets you? And how long that good press lasts? Do they know how much bad press their site has right now? That search results talk about how Reddit harbors white supremacists, chased off their women CEO, has fired or let go of major women employees, has a disgruntled former CEO talking about how the site is trash, used to be a ring for pedophiles and trading child porn, and has an underground illegal firearms racket on it?   All it takes is banning what is essentially Stormfront On Reddit, and you buy yourself un-buyable positive publicity.

Sure, I get that there are a few subs which are kind of grey areas, but a sub whose entire point is to propagate the pseudoscientific notion that blacks are an inferior race? Subs whose entire point is to advocate for the extinction of all Jews everywhere? Why would you want these on your website?  Seriously, Reddit needs to grow a bloody spine. Ban the hateful-by-design subs (and it's immediately obvious which ones these are), and then you put in place a content policy to deal with the subs which aren't hateful-by-design, but exist in the grey area between acceptable content and bannable content.

There's literally no reason to keep them around except that you'd have a mess on your hands for a couple months before PR started getting better.

And for weeks after that, any new visitor's first impression of Reddit would include racist and sexist attacks on Ellen Pao, right on the front page, along with complaints about how hateful and fascist Reddit's administration is.  Now imagine how bad the default subs will get if all the racist subs get banned and their inhabitants decide to start frontpaging openly racist crap (as opposed to the crypto-racist crap they promote now), with Reddit's free speech brigade backing them up.  There's no way in hell admins are going to pull the trigger on that until they have mods and mod tools capable of fending off that invasion.  (If ever.)

Everytime the admins have cracked down on the userbase the revenue of the sight has dropped and the viewership has fallen as well.   Banning FPH caused the website to experience a 10% traffic loss, the most recent Ellen Pao scandal caused an even larger one (20% traffic loss, half as many Reddit gold purchases)  The admins are scared to do anything, because everytime they have they've lost money.

Could someone warped enough take in the Chimpire nonsense and bring it to action? I think it's almost inevitable. They apparently just felt like they had to ban some sub after the big to do and went for one of the easiest choices without making any real impact for the community. Whatever. That's on them if the Chimpire inspires its own Dylann Roof.  I'm not mad. I worked way too many hours today to feel anything but numb.

circlebroke,3djl5v,ArchangelleGabrielle,12,Thu Jul 16 20:09:24 2015 UTC,"This article strikes right at a central conflict that we've seen over and over again through the years here at Reddit.   Reddit, and by extension, a lot of the early web, is often thought of as a kind of a prelapsarian state before Facebook, Twitter, and those darn social justice warriors ruined everything. Trouble is, saying that freedom came first gets things backwards: idealized states of purity from the past always conceal the power relations that enabled them. Reddit's free speech, enacted, is mainly a home for young, naïve, and mostly white men to talk in the abstract about equality and philosophy without having to confront their biases.  [...]  This is the paradox of the commons. We both need collectivity and community, yet it seems that openness itself undercuts those ideals. It's an irresolvable problem that was inadvertently expressed by Reddit’s new CEO, Steve Huffman. In reference to a new approach to moderation, he writes that neither he nor cofounder Alexis Ohanian ""created reddit to be a bastion of free speech, but rather as a place where open and honest discussion can happen."" The contradiction is thus laid bare: free speech and open, honest discussion are actually antagonistic.   When it comes to free speech, so very few of its most vocal defenders consider all the speech lost by all the women, people of color, and other folks driven away by the worst parts of Reddit.  What's even more hidden is the loss to the community and its discourse itself. Imagine if Reddit was a place that was taken seriously and enjoyed by immensely clever, talented, and intelligent people like Ta-Nehisi Coates or Mallory Ortberg.  What a fucking shame."
circlebroke,3djl5v,TheRealCJ,3,Thu Jul 16 20:17:01 2015 UTC,"As a result, a culture emerges on the the site that valorizes not only free speech and anonymity, but an entitlement to it. The act of ""defiantly"" spouting one's unpopular opinions becomes good in and of itself, whether those expressions are about the right to surreptitiously photograph women, shame the so-called ""unattractive"", or assert that whites are simply better.

They have like 200,000 subscribers or so, iirc.  The average male redditor needs someone to blame when his precious karma drops from downvotes. So when he says ""I hate Jews"" and gets 10 downvotes (although honestly you'd probably get upvoted for this on quite a few more subs than we'd like to admit) he instantly blames SRS, because of their magical brigading power that seeks out every remotely shitty comment.   Additionally, other redditors need something to attribute upvotes too when something really shitty gets upvotes very fast. They don't believe it's possible the lowest common denominator actually agrees with them (reddit thinks itself much better than almost any other community) and so they blame SRS, which is why you see comments with 4000 upvotes and gilded five times blaming SRS.   Reddit wants to believe it's better than it really is.   People almost always apply the same logic to agreement. Like, 10 upvotes means 10 people agree with me and 10 downvotes means 10 people can't beat me in an argument so they won't engage."

Let's stretch back into history, has it been 3, 4, years? I mostly lurk circlebroke, but I always liked it. I hated SRS with a passion years ago because of some of the things its leaders, e.g. laurelai did, like making decisions that would fragment the lgbt community into /r/lgbt and /r/ainbow. I think that about 3 years ago, I argued on SRD that SRS should be banned for brigading and violating other rules, as there were incidents when they explicitly violated reddit's content policies in an organized and intentional way. I also always perceived SRS' inner circle as sort of unflinchingly angry and not at all self-reflective, whereas circlebroke and almost every other tolerant subreddit of comparable size was at least trying to be self-reflective, or make reddit better, or be compassionate, or even just be witty, rather than just reacting to everything with anger.  As far as I can tell, SRS has mellowed out since the ""golden"" days. Circlebroke has changed, too. 3 years ago, they were very different user bases, and the tone for both subreddits was very different. Maybe I even feel neutral about SRS now. But in the past some of their loudest leaders caused tangible damage to minority communities (like I mentioned above) and they made more compassionate people of a similar mindset look crazy."

There is not ""no racism against whites"" in the definition. By the definition, it is racism. Do you understand?   And SRS loves to use the argument that jokes are still harmful and problematic. So, again, by their own logic, and by the literal definition of the word racism, when SRS posts about hating white people, it is racism. And considering how common  and popular ""white people hate"" posts are, one could reasonably conclude that SRS is a racist subreddit."

Here's my answer: Let's just say, hypothetically, that I accept that a racist joke about a black person is worse than a racist joke about a white person. Ok, cool. Is SRS now okay? I don't think so. Even if one joke is worse than the other, both are still, by definition, and by the logic of SRS, racism. And considering the fact that most users on SRS are VERY, VERY passionate in their pursuit against racism, it is hypocritical that they would be trying to sweep racism, albeit a lesser form, under the rug. Racism against whites is still racism, and shouldn't be tolerated or respected, ESPECIALLY on a social justice forum, where anti-racism and racial equality are the goals."

circlebroke,3dfugb,ForgingIron,5,Thu Jul 16 06:28:40 2015 UTC,"My guess, motivations below.  Purge: I don't think they will purge that many subs, because if we're going with the whole ""ad-safe space"" theory it'd be more convenient to just get rid of some of the subs no one from the outside would be fooled by. I.e. high profile subs and subs so blatantly offensive you don't even have to click in order to know. And I don't think they'll have the spine to go any further than that, to be honest. So:  Coontown, because it's too high profile to ignore. Cutefemalecorpses, because it's blatantly obscene and not trying to hide it. Holocaust, because no one buys into their shit so it might as well go under the ""blatant"" category. KiA is trickier, as they do love reaffirming to themselves that it's totally not about hate and harassments. But at the same time, they're even more high profile than Coontown. Consider this my risky pick.  Top comment: Does this mandate a motivation? I'll just describe it in detail instead. It's going to be a long tirade that includes some dumb justification based on a creative word-by-word interpretation of the new rules and ""from a certain point of view"" comparisons, referencing ""offenses"" and ""confessions"" allegedly committed by SRS three years ago but without any actual links to back it up. Lots o' upvotes, some high-rated replies rewording the same thing without adding to the argument, at least 10 gold.  Content policy: ""We don't tolerate harassment"" is basically free points. Racism and sexism are the first things that come to mind, so that will be included. Homophobia will also be explicitly prohibited, because that's a popular group to support as well these days. As usual when it comes to tolerance talks, trans people draw the short straw and don't get included. As for how well any of this will be enforced, now that's a different question entirely.

circlebroke,3ddgwi,robeph,62,Wed Jul 15 20:02:31 2015 UTC,"I used to be a regular on FARK between like 2001 and 2010. Loved the place, before it got overrun by the same repetitive circle jerking and pretentiousness week after week. Anyway, I can remember sometime prior to 2005, there was some controversy on the site wherein I think some popular users got banned for something? And then they decided to make their own version of FARK, and people kept talking about how it was going to be the replacement for FARK when Drew Curtis ran it into the ground.   I cannot even remember the name of that other site now.   I imagine in a few years, that'll be voat."
circlebroke,3ddgwi,sgamer,49,Wed Jul 15 16:51:36 2015 UTC,"Hah, Bannination. Looks like it no longer exists too. Also love how Fark has a anti-misogyny policy nowadays, good on 'em."
circlebroke,3ddgwi,RhinestoneTaco,40,Wed Jul 15 13:58:58 2015 UTC,"Bannination   Fuckin' A, bubba. That was it. Do you know when it shut down? The shut-down page looks well designed.  I had an account there for a week and realized it was just sad people grumbling about hating Drew Curtis, then forgot the site existed.    Also love how Fark has a anti-misogyny policy nowadays, good on 'em.    It's amazing how fuckin' FARK, a site with that culture, could both have and peacefully regulate an anti-misogyny policy, but Reddit is still twiddling it's thumbs about getting rid of a white supremacist sub."
circlebroke,3ddgwi,sgamer,4,Wed Jul 15 14:19:11 2015 UTC,"As is noted by sgamer,  fark is admin curated and a single population modded by the same governing rules.    Reddit,  this becomes a serious issue.   Misogyny itself can't even be agreed on from sub to sub.    Some places you're a misogynist because you simply disagree with some false premise from a woman.   Some places you're an ableist MRA when you respond to some post about a guy who was sexually assaulted and some random twit posts the whole ""men can't be raped""  bits.      Then occasionally I've been called a feminist because I argue with some redpill nonsense,   or disagree with some other radical silliness.    Either side,  being fairly midline  finds you dotted across the spectrum of what they see you as, depending on where you are.   The same post on two different subs may get you side eyes and a couple downvotes with a few people calling you an asshole,  and another you're Hitler cubed;  all while you have 300 upvotes and cheers in another.    Fark,  if you say what they dislike,  you'll get the hand,  every time.  Things don't move around so much.  Not that I am always in agreement with the level I've seen it go sometimes,  but it is consistent.      Reddit by its very nature is inconsistent.   What offends one may be comedy to another.  Best thing to do is avoid what you don't like by not visiting those subs,  if it comes to your sub and the sub is like minded,  you'll find it likely will be dealt with.    If it comes directly from their sub,  you'll find reddit admins don't like crossover too much and are likely to put a heavy foot down for that."
circlebroke,3ddgwi,Ragnar_OK,6,Wed Jul 15 14:23:16 2015 UTC,"It's not really so amazing, as all of their content is curated by the admins, and their posting moderation is much more strict site-wide.   Not that the strictness is a bad thing for their site, but the same format doesn't work here because each subreddit is its own microcosm of people that have different opinions on what is and what is not spam/relevant/etc, where they'd rather moderate themselves rather than involve full-site moderation by the admins.  That's why we still have racist subs. The approach has always been to live-and-let-live except in cases where they stray outside of their purview, such as doxxing or brigading, and this isn't a bad approach, to be honest. The issue has been that it isn't always equally applied, with some situations being over-handled and others being under-handled.   I'm okay with it going forward as it always has, but I wouldn't object to the admins having a ""watchlist"" of ""bad"" subs to keep an eye on, or even having a site addon created for the admins to facilitate viewing new comments and submissions posted to that watchlist. That would help them ""stay neutral"" and still handle harassment."

circlebroke,3ddgwi,Ragnar_OK,-1,Wed Jul 15 16:17:45 2015 UTC,"The problem with implementing the opposite is with how strict do you really get? There's not a lot of great answers, and if they do end up implementing content controls site-wide, how far will they reach? Sure, banning racism alone sounds great, but then it extends into banning other groups, and possibly other things. Graphic content? Illegal activity-related content? Any worthless post or spam even if related to the sub it's in? There's plenty of gray area there to tread.  It's basically an all or nothing decision, and whoever is at the helm with the banhammer gets to impose their view of neutrality. This worked great with FARK, because it was that way from day 1 with Drew and co behind the wheel making things run smooth and locking things down. With here, with it having been so open for so long, the wrong moves site-wide could be a disaster.   Is it really better to have it open? I'm not sure. But if it changes, it's not coming back from that. We just have to hope whoever is in charge doesn't get too hamhanded with the whole thing at that point."

I personally liked the hands-off approach, because they had been able to deal with the worst of the bunch through normal means. My front page isn't shitted up with all of these godawful places, because I don't go there, and they don't brigade where I do visit. Unfortunately, when you have a group of people mad at you practically advertising your worst features, you can start to get known for them. They may be tolerable, but it's bad for them in a business sense, so getting rid of those bad apples will definitely help the company. This also helps the site as well, but how, we do not yet know."

Nope, exactly, I can't. I know I can't, because they own reddit. It's their right to do whatever they want with it and getting outraged at that is silly to me. I have no say in it, and why should I have any say in it? I use reddit because I enjoy the platform it offers, I really couldn't care less about reddit policy. I enjoy only a single part of metareddit, and that's circlejerk. Beyond that, reddit can do whatever the hell it wants, because it's its owners' right.  EDIT:   Unfortunately, when you have a group of people mad at you practically advertising your worst features, you can start to get known for them.

Their servers had considerable downtime during the post-Victorian era, which they failed to speedily rectify (and is still an issue) Although their site design shares a lot of similarities with Reddit, the default CSS style is more difficult to read, with multiple page breaks and a poor choice in legible color schema Each subreddit has the ability to control posts and comment submissions based on karma level, which is like putting a sign on the treehouse that says, ""You need 100 bottle caps to enter"". Well, maybe I don't want to go in your stupid tree house. Maybe I'll make my own tree house with blackjack and hookers    If Voat fixes those issues ( especially the fucking server issues ), then people might use it.

circlebroke,3desug,ArchangelleGabrielle,49,Wed Jul 15 18:34:38 2015 UTC,"These are nice theories to debate. The practical reality is that Reddit seems to have overtaken Stormfront as the world’s largest White Supremacy community.1 And thus, every page view turns into some fraction of a dollar that powers a server that hosts hate.  Hate for me and my children. Hate for my great-grandparents coming here. Hate that goes beyond talk, and becomes shootings and burning of churches, and “standing your ground” against teenagers. To others, hate is just “disagreement.” Or just “appalling talk.” Or just “people of colour with thin skins.”  I grew up worshipping in a historically black church. There’s another just down the street from me. There’s also a Mosque and a Buddhist Temple, mind you. So when people talk about hate, it may merely be “offensive speech” when you, your children and your neighbours are not the people they want to exterminate.   No matter what happens with Reddit's policies in the (near) future, this article really resonated with me. I like a whole lot of people I've interacted with on Reddit and I'm glad to have gotten to be a part of so many great communities here.  But what kind of moral and ethical responsibility do people who profess to care about racism and other social injustices have in terms of giving support, no matter how small, to a website that hosts communities that vocally wish violence and suffering on people like my family, my friends, and me?"

It's inconceivable to a lot of people that someone can change their mind completely, 180 degrees on an issue. I guess it's because they're relatively young and haven't seen what five to ten years or more can do to someone's experience and growth and how they inform their own opinions.

What all the white-power racist-sexist neckbeards don't understand is that with her at the head of the company, the company would be immune to accusations of promoting sexism and racism: she is literally Silicon Valley's #1 Feminist Hero, so any ""SJWs"" would have a hard time attacking the company for intentionally creating a bastion (heh) of sexist/racist content. She probably would have tolerated your existence so long as you didn't cause any problems - I know that her long-term strategies were to find ways to surface and publicize reddit's good parts - allowing the bad parts to exist but keeping them out of the spotlight. It would have been very principled - the CEO of reddit, who once sued her previous employer for sexual discrimination, upholds free speech and tolerates the ugly side of humanity because it is so important to maintaining a platform for open discourse. It would have been unassailable.  Well, now she's gone (you did it reddit!), and /u/spez has the moral authority as a co-founder to move ahead with the purge.

Why not make this case before?  And louder?  Why wait until now?  I mean, maybe the admins would ban the hatesubs.

And as such, he's a terrible business person who puts personal drama and stirring witch hunts above all else.

I didn't know that Huffman would come in (the idea was floated when I left and he was a firm no at the time) or that she would actually resign.  I assumed that this was one of those reddit drama-fests that would blow over, as they typically do.

Besides, that's not even what I'm getting at. I neutralized the spesifics of what they complain about for a reason. It's the way that they're both so far up their own ass, that they've abandoned any sliver of a notion that they could be wrong. So much so that it's a joke to them when people disagree with them. ""Stop triggering me"" ""It's actually about ethics in games journalism"" instead of actually examining what the other person said, they just turn around and make it a forced meme.

Crap on reddit gets so frustrating that it's good to have a place to just let loose about how terrible it is. TiA on the other hand has the primary purpose of putting other people down to feel better. Maybe it's a subtle difference, but it's there."

What he's saying is definitely not gonna calm people down. The fact that this has been building over several days and he keeps getting more detailed with it -- including a day or two ago when he said something to Alexis, iirc, about not respecting him much anymore -- tells me the dude genuinely had a poor experience at the company. At this point, the site's staff is going to have to prove he's fucking with people and making a lot of what he's saying up or they're going to have a real hard time with the rabble come that Thursday AMA."

This is the best post I've ever seen on reddit. Literally nothing before this has given me as much joy.

We believe that she is not only the worst CEO that Reddit has ever had, but is also a horrible person in real life.

circlebroke,3dbwyk,SkeletonJewsWarrior,70,Wed Jul 15 03:22:23 2015 UTC,"Oh this is good. I actually thought I was quitting meta Reddit, but this brought me back.   I actually can't fault Yishan's naivety here. Reddit used to be a very different site. I've been on a active contributor to this site for 5+ years (this is my meta alt) and Reddit has just gotten meaner and more cynical. This used to be a site where we did positive things like the Donors Choose fundraiser and it had a unique feel to it like the place was a special hangout of all kinds of people and some of the more noticeable hate you'd see were against Christian fundamentalists and republicans. But overall, it wasn't that bad.   But then a lot changed. With an influx of new users, you saw different sects of hate form. One in particular I think that contributed significantly to all of this was the change in culture against atheists and ""neckbeards."" Suddenly you saw places like us and other defaults lampoon ""neckbeards"" more often and a lot of Redditors were pretty relentless. I don't remember anti-neckbeard sentiments being that strong early on when I was here. This was no longer their safe-haven now that Reddit was more mainstream. The neckbeards were back in high school and being bullied but Reddit was always a safe place for the nerds and outcasts.  Think about how you used to classify ""neckbeards"" on this site. They were routinely stereotyped as ""foreveralone nice guy"" types who thought they were entitled to a relationship and happiness. They weren't bad people, just naive and oblivious. Now when I think neckbeard, I think angry, reactionary, TRP asshole with a dose of misogyny.  It's like they took all that bullying of nice guy stereotypes and inverted it into being a total asshole.   Then the nerds and outcast ""neckbeards"" got bitter and increasingly defensive. They retreated to MRA subs, KIA and TRP and misogyny on this website only increased. You had meta subs like us sprout up against the backlash and overall people were at increasing odds with each other. Little cliques formed against the SJW's and ""cabals"" and I really think you can observe all this vitriol carrying over in the comment sections. People just got meaner and more segregated and formed their own little cliques.   Essentially Reddit grew up from blissful children with a happy demeanor to angsty teenagers constantly shitting on each other. That's my hastily drawn observation and total conjecture as to what I think occurred on Reddit the last few years."

Reddit was a place where the consensus was extremely anti-woman, anti-feminism, anti-minority, but everyone was polite so it was considered enlightened.  Then, the pushback against the concept of the ""neckbeard"" began, a caricature designed to mock the self-satisfied reactionary.  Mensrights 4-5 years ago would agree with (almost) everything on the redpill now, and it was far more mainstream on reddit.  What changed wasn't the ideas, just the force with which those ideas are delivered.  Extreme, reactionary opinions are actually less strong with the reddit consensus now - just a few years ago the community was on balance mostly pro-jailbait.  Reddit has progressed.  But, I agree, this progression has led to the ""reactionary right"" of reddit amping it up to 11."

Plus, he said a few minutes ago he recognizes he's no longer employable in any executive position anywhere, so he is clearly out for lulz/popcorn/blood at this point."
circlebroke,3dcafu,__shoe__,54,Wed Jul 15 05:11:19 2015 UTC,"Plus, he said a few minutes ago he recognizes he's no longer employable in any executive position anywhere   Pretty sure that he's joking about that. Despite what his posting history may suggest, he's a pretty smart dude and has worked key roles in some extremely successful companies."
circlebroke,3dcafu,sjgrunewald,38,Wed Jul 15 05:39:06 2015 UTC,"I guess so, but it seems at least half-serious? I feel like a lot of places would be hesitant to bring him on in an executive position given how he is burning these bridges and revealing private conversations between key employees, but I, and I don't mean this in a sarcastic way, don't know a lot about Silicon Valley hiring culture. I'm sure he can find work, but specifically the executive stuff seems less easy for him to obtain now. I mean, didn't he publicly shame on reddit a former employee after they fired him and the guy started mouthing off? It just seems like he has some strikes against him that way. But I dunno anything about any of this."
circlebroke,3dcafu,__shoe__,24,Wed Jul 15 05:47:21 2015 UTC,"If you are talented enough there is very little that you could do to be exiled from the tech industry.

He's basically saying that putting /u/spez back in charge was the first step towards cleansing the filth, and the company is moving towards a safer, more inclusive website. He hasn't revealed anything terribly damaging, the net positive is going to be good PR for Reddit, and its new regime."
circlebroke,3dcafu,allhailzorp,6,Wed Jul 15 06:39:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, to the outside, it looks good. Aside from what may have been done to Ellen by the site. That looks not nice. But I think certain users are going to feel ""had"" by the admins. He basically told them they all rushed to judgment and inflicted mob justice on someone who was on their side. He's already said he's not a big Alexis fan, so I think he has some ill will toward the staff and the users who acted impetuously. And if we hear on Thursday that they're going to start getting rid of some of these nasty subs, there is going to be some real saltiness. It depends on how broad this cleansing is, if it happens at all. You're right that he has sort of softened the blow. Gaining their trust and then telling redditors they lost their ""freedom"" because they couldn't play nice makes any potential culling easier, probably."
circlebroke,3dcafu,__shoe__,7,Wed Jul 15 06:59:18 2015 UTC,"Most people who come to Reddit don't care about any of this stuff, and most people who submit content don't care about any of this stuff. Purging the whiners and entitled babies from Reddit isn't going to hurt it very much. Especially when you consider how racists, misogynists and homophobes leaving Reddit because they started to enforce content guidelines is going to get a lot of play in the mainstream media and will most likely bring in a lot of new readers.  That's what is so hilarious about this whole mess. Their protesting and whining and shitposting is only proving that they are not part of a community that wants Reddit to succeed, giving them even more incentive to ditch them. They are bring it all on themselves.   And for all the handwringing over Digg and its smaller user base, as a company it turns a profit. Size isn't everything. But I think Reddit lends itself to a lot more monetization opportunities than Digg ever did, and I don't think it will ruin most users experiences on the site, hell I don't even think it will impact the way most people use Reddit."

However I think they should be entitled to the same rights as a married couple from a tax and care perspective.  NOT OK: Fucking faggots are an abomination to humanity.    I know a lot of social justice types and people on circlebroke won't agree with the thing I'm saying is ok. I don't even agree with it. However it is a different political and religious opinion on the matter without actually being homophobic towards a group. Just arguing how a term and laws relating to marriage should be be applied.   The later is just outward homophobia.

With the whole naive Silicon Valley style cyber-utopianism, though, that distinction isn't necessarily made.  Hobbes had a different view; he believed that humans in a state of nature naturally act to maximize their rational self interest to the greatest extent possible, which means that they will inevitably come into conflict with each other. This creates a ""war of all against all"" that can only be prevented if all the people submit to an absolutely powerful centralized authority which can negotiate disputes and enforce good behavior between them.

The answer is a good and justified one - Reddit isn't being used to save the lives of dissidents or preserve free media, it's being used for worthwhile conversations mixed with near-criminal harrassment.  Moreover, it's not something like PGP or Tor where privacy and speech are all or nothing - banning subs or users doesn't compromise Reddit's general nature.  Fatpeoplehate wasn't secretly a coded forum for Syrian rebels, and frankly it should be obvious that nothing of value was lost.  The slippery slope argument isn't relevant in the face of well-intentioned and omnipotent private ownership.  I don't have any real criticism of content policies or the subreddit bans, but I am a bit unimpressed by the historical revisionism in their post.

AYYYYYY LMAO  How's everyone doing? This is AWESOME!  There's something I neglected to tell you all this time (""executive privilege""), but I'm declassifying a lot of things these days. Back around the time of the /r/creepshots debacle, I wrote to /u/spez  for advice. I had met him shortly after I had taken the job, and found him to be a great guy. Back in the day when reddit was small, the areas he oversaw were engineering, product, and the business aspects - those are the same things I tend to focus on in a company (each CEO has certain areas of natural focus, and hires others to oversee the rest). As a result, we were able to connect really well and have a lot of great conversations - talking to him was really valuable.  Well, when things were heating around the /r/creepshots thing and people were calling for its banning, I wrote to him to ask for advice. The very interesting thing he wrote back was ""back when I was running things, if there was anything racist, sexist, or homophobic I'd ban it right away. I don't think there's a place for such things on reddit. Of course, now that reddit is much bigger, I understand if maybe things are different.""  I've always remembered that email when I read the occasional posting here where people say ""the founders of reddit intended this to be a place for free speech."" Human minds love originalism, e.g. ""we're in trouble, so surely if we go back to the original intentions, we can make things good again."" Sorry to tell you guys but NO, that wasn't their intention at all ever. Sucks to be you, /r/coontown - I hope you enjoy voat!   Bolded because lol   The free speech policy was something I formalized because it seemed like the wiser course at the time. It's worth stating that in that era, we were talking about whether it was ok for people to post creepy pictures of women taken legally in public. That's shitty, but it's a far cry from the extremes of hate that some parts of the site host today. It seemed that allowing creepers to post (anonymized) pictures of women taken in public, in a relatively small subreddit that never showed up on the front page, was a small price to pay for making it clear that we were a place welcoming of all opinions and discourse. Having made that decision - much of reddit's current condition is on me. I didn't anticipate what (some) redditors would decide to do with freedom. reddit has become a lot bigger - yes, a lot better - AND a lot worse. I have to take responsibility.  But... the most delicious part of this is that on at least two separate occasions, the board pressed /u/ekjp to outright ban ALL the hate subreddits in a sweeping purge. She resisted, knowing the community, claiming it would be a shitshow. Ellen isn't some ""evil, manipulative, out-of-touch incompetent she-devil"" as was often depicted. She was approved by the board and recommended by me because when I left, she was the only technology executive anywhere who had the chops and experience to manage a startup of this size, AND who understood what reddit was all about. As we can see from her post-resignation activity , she knows perfectly well how to fit in with the reddit community and is a normal, funny person - just like in real life - she simply didn't sit on reddit all day because she was busy with her day job.  Ellen was more or less inclined to continue upholding my free-speech policies. /r/fatpeoplehate was banned for inciting off-site harassment, not discussing fat-shaming. What all the white-power racist-sexist neckbeards don't understand is that with her at the head of the company, the company would be immune to accusations of promoting sexism and racism: she is literally Silicon Valley's #1 Feminist Hero, so any ""SJWs"" would have a hard time attacking the company for intentionally creating a bastion (heh) of sexist/racist content. She probably would have tolerated your existence so long as you didn't cause any problems - I know that her long-term strategies were to find ways to surface and publicize reddit's good parts - allowing the bad parts to exist but keeping them out of the spotlight. It would have been very principled - the CEO of reddit, who once sued her previous employer for sexual discrimination, upholds free speech and tolerates the ugly side of humanity because it is so important to maintaining a platform for open discourse. It would have been unassailable.  Well, now she's gone (you did it reddit!), and /u/spez  has the moral authority as a co-founder to move ahead with the purge. We tried to let you govern yourselves and you failed, so now The Man is going to set some Rules. Admittedly, I can't say I'm terribly upset."

I dunno, there are some great things that happen here, but sometimes it's easy to forget them because the pile of shit tends to drown them out.  But both AskHistorians and AskScience are great subs. (I love when FPH types post questions about weight loss and all of the scientists basically point out how wrong everyone on FPH always is. It drives them nuts.) CasualConversation is pretty nice if you catch it on a good, flowing convo day. LGBT and Ainbow have both settled into a really great groove and don't seem to attack each other anymore, which, as a gay person, always sucked having to watch. There are no more over the top iron fist enforced rules on the former and no more whining and complaining about the former on the latter. Most of the defaults are shit obviously (Although, weirdly, AskReddit has been sort of trying a little harder at being less shit than normal) but there are tons of smaller subs that I really enjoy visiting. Especially the nature subs and the animal subs.  And I know we're all being smug and complaining here mostly, but I quite enjoy CB overall and I think most of the users here are pretty decent folks who have given up getting mad and just starting mocking the Redditors who act like idiots. If they are going to shit up the other parts of Reddit, then I think smugging out together in our little circlesmug is a pretty decent way to cope with the crap that we can run into. And lots of you all are really damn funny and I gleefully steal your jokes. It reminds me a lot of OG SRS pre-Angelle's actually."

I know I said such changes will be a ""death knell"" but that's an exaggeration, Reddit will persist, but its popularity will fade, kind of like digg.  nothing wrong with that (there will be more commentary that circlebrokers will like) but progressives have a habit of creating a toxic environment of strict censorship, in which people are afraid to speak openly.  why would normal people, even moderate progressives, be interested in posting there?  maybe that's the goal, to create a community in which the average person is less welcome than the educated progressive, but it limits the website's appeal.  this is getting long so I'm going to wrap it up there  now look at what a reasonable post that was.  strange how a racist bigoted anti-feminist piece of shit can make thoughtful commentary  /u/CanadianDragon434   I'm going with /r/coontown, /r/antipozi, and /r/ShitRedditSays (A failed attempt to look unbiased)    moderator of /r/antipozi here, AMA  /u/King_Dead   I'm kind of surprised that antipozi hasn't been taken down already.

I do feel that, at times, there are organized raids to upvote certain comments/submissions (or even just making multiple accounts to ""discuss"" with each other) and make it seem like certain views are more popular than they really are.

However, currently this thankfulness has been used by Church to do a lot of bad things, be it take way more land as compensation for what communist took away from them than there should have been in reality or stall any social progress, be it civil unions (which is kinda expected) or passing law regulating IVF (which is less reasonable, due to some bishops saying children from IVF have a mark on their heads or that they have 'survivor syndrome' because their 'brothers and sisters' died as embryos due to IVF), often threatening excommunication towards elected officials and using masses to agitate for a party they support.

Can't help but feel that kn0thing and spez have a plan for AMA and Reddit gift exchange that is profit oriented and required the removal of Victoria and kickme444. And let's face it, banning subs that people may find offensive will mean that those people find alternatives like Voat, which means apologists here will say, ""I'm glad those offensive people are gone, don't go to any alternative site because they are just filled with racists and bigots."" It's perfect for Reddit's leaders really, because obviously you are morally reprehensible if you visit alternatives to Reddit that are filled with racists and bigots. Perhaps we should think that if /u/kn0thing is pushing for something and acts like an asshole, then /u/spez, his former roommate and cofounder of Reddit, may just go along with whatever he has planned. So, will Reddit actually be able to finish the mod tools in the coming months? Or will they be able to just lay the blame on someone and move forward. /u/kn0thing obviously knows how PR works, so I'm interested to see how things proceed. I don't think this post is breaking any rules, so hopefully I won't be shadowbanned for it eh? TL;DR: This is all shitty. Shit shitty shit shit shit. It's like the leaders of Reddit are trying to kill the site with this shitstorm."

But their community seems similar to reddit's and facebook's and twitter's and pretty much that of any giant social networking site.

circlebroke,3d83e9,RhinestoneTaco,12,Tue Jul 14 16:40:53 2015 UTC,"In any kind of mass media, there are limitations to the number of things you can print/broadcast/host. People are therefore in charge of deciding, through some process, what gets seen and what does not -- that process is called Gatekeeping.   Let's take a traditional example: A newspaper. You only have so much space in a newspaper. You only have space for two stories ""Above the fold"" on the front page. By studying what kind of stories a newspaper decides to put on the front page ""Above the fold,"" you can make determinations about how those people, the ones who work at that paper, think about what is important. If you do that enough times and different newspapers, you can draw conclusions about what people who work at newspapers think is important."

Off the top of my head I think of Old Boy (pre-USA remake), Chungking Express (although In the Mood for Love is probably more popular), The Lives of Others, The Three Idiots, etc. These are all movies that I heard of through other people and decided to watch.  When I went to see Incendies in theatres there were only 3 people there, including myself. If every theatre audience was approximately that small all across the country, I'd say it has spread pretty well. Hopefully in the next few years we can get more people watching through word of mouth.  Incendies is without a doubt one of my top 3 favourite movies. It is truly amazing. I also don't understand how it is so unknown.

If you are attracted to the opposite sex, it is different (hetero) than your sex.  Heterosexuality.  If you are attracted to the same same, it is the same (homo) as your sex.  Homosexuality.  Homosexual and heterosexual attraction have longevity.  They can last entire lives.  Pedophiles' attractions toward an individual lasts at most 18 years.  This is not love.  This is not worthy of respect.  This is not tragic.  It's fucked up and these people need to be trained to not rape kids, because everyone else has been doing a pretty damn good job of not doing that."

I'd always gotten stuck at ""god damn that's stupid"", but never bothered to work up a good reply.  I think this is actually a powerful discriminator - it's a sexuality if you're being drawn to certain, (relatively) immutable groups of people.  Its a fetish or a paraphilia if you're being drawn to traits, independent of the person behind them.  Some paraphilias are harmless, others aren't, but this is a quick way to differentiate sexualities from sexual tastes."
circlebroke,3d6dds,Bartweiss,27,Tue Jul 14 05:00:27 2015 UTC,"The first issue for me is its quite important to distinguish between orientation and paraphilias like peadophilia because of how they actually work. Orientation has been observed as corresponding to the kind of sex hormones you react to; which is how you can have a blind person who knows they're gay for example. As it stands I don't think peadophilia works in the same way i.e. corresponds to some sort of ""child hormone"" or even exists in the same areas of the brain, so right away when you're correlating the two, you're muddying understanding betwen orientation and paraphilias by lumping them both in together under an ""orientation"" or ""preference""  There are also many different types of peadophile which is often an important thing to consider in discussion. You can have an orientation but also have a paraphilia like peadophilia, but the sex of the child might not correspond with the sex of your orientation i.e. you can be attracted to adult men and little girls, but not boys or women, along with all other possible comibinations I imagine.   In addition to that, 40-60% of peadophiles in the studies done have reported exclusive attraction. This means that they are attracted only to kids of both or either sex and not adults at all. You will see peadophiles in /r/confession for example who will differ, one will be attracted exclusively to boys and not adult women or men or girls for example. So there isn't just one type of peadophile, which most people don't consider.  You'll often see people assume a male peadophilie is attracted to the adult sex of the child in which he abused, so if its a boy he must be attracted to adult men and if a girl he must be attracted to adult women, but that is often not the case. Unless you actually interview them to get their full sexual profile there is no way of knowing their full sexual identity using the sex of the abused child to draw conclusions. But you'll see a story in the news about a guy abusing a male minor, and everyones all ""this is why gays shouldn't be allowed to be scout masters!"" - assuming the guy is gay without knowing his full sexual profile.  Also you have the history of LGBT, where early psychiatry based on christian interpretations of evolutionary psychology where everything was centered on reproductive sexual activity established the sexual deviances we are familiar with today, in which homosexuals were known as ""homophiles"" and indistinguishable from peadophiles for quite a long time, and you still see people saying we're one step away from peadophile from time to time, so thats another reason people get touchy about I think. You still see this interpretation of sexuaity often, in which heterosexuality is the only ""natural"" state and everything else falls on a scale of ""sexual deviancy"", often including various kinks or fetishes as well as homosexuality and paraphilia basically antyhing but vanilla heterosexual intercourse, primarily for the purpose of reproduction, but blowjobs and other ""vanilla"" things are okay.   Maybe its that interpretation along with an ignorance to the biology of orientation and paraphilia which is why we get these common comparisons of homosexuality and peadophilia; because they still see homosexuality as ""wrong"" and on the scale of sexual deviancy and don't appreciate the history of such comparisons, so feel its appropriate to use as way to back up a point which usually basically amounts to ""people can't choose their sexual preferences, see gay people for example"".   But what's interesting is you don't need to bring up homosexuality at all to make the point peadophiles can't control their attractions and should be encouraged to seek help and not vilified into the shadows where they're more of a risk to children, and yet I can't remember a time people have discussed peadophilia without using a comparison to homosexuality in some form or another. I wouldn't mind so much if it was every now and then, but does it really need to be every time? And they always find new ways to wedge it in there, very weird."

I hadn't considered the idea that people tend to associate the two not because of their biological origins but because they're both further down the (historical, Christian) scale of deviancy than heterosexuality is.  That actually helps explain a few other things I see, like people who approve of gay marriage still being skeptical of bisexuality - they haven't understood the differences between sexuality and paraphilias, they've just broadened their standard for ""normal"" a bit.  Your last point feels like it gets to the truth of why this is such a bad discussion for people to be having on a pro-treatment article.  In general, paraphilias (especially exclusive attractions) are beyond the control of the people who have them, and those people often suffer without having knowledge of how to control what they're experiencing.  That alone is reason enough to encourage people to seek help without vilification, all on it's own.  If someone is experiencing unhealthy or destructive urges they can't control, it benefits everyone for them to get help.  Tying that experience to urges that are only unhealthy as a result of social stigma and oppression manages to be both offensive and unhelpful."
circlebroke,3d6dds,Bartweiss,10,Tue Jul 14 13:14:19 2015 UTC,"I think the most basic, fundamental stupidity of this comparison is that it completely ignores the idea of consent.  Gay, bisexual and hetero people all normally want the partner to consent to sex. Being attracted to a certain kind of person (or to all persons in pansexual cases, or whatever) is one thing, and the other thing is that we also want those people to want us, and we are happy when they do and for the most part that's when we have sex with them. When a straight guy, or a gay girl or whoever, thinks that their attraction is the only thing that is necessary for sex to happen, that's when we call them rapists. And yet pedo apologists do exactly that - they insist that their attraction is the only thing that matters, and it's enough to make sex happen. It's not.  There are tons of gay guys out there who don't go around actively searching for other guys to bonk. They are happy to meet people and be approached for sex and then consent to it. Because other gays also want that sex and will seek it out. Children don't want sex and don't seek it out. That's why all those ephephapapapopiles are not content to live their lives with the hope of being approached for sex by a 13 year old. That's why kids who do approach adults for sex are basically all victims of abuse or otherwise unhinged.  Because children don't want sex and don't seek it out. Being gay or bi or asexual or whatever is okay because it still implies a mutual understanding, it still respects the idea of consent. Sex between a thirteen year old and thirty year old does not respect the idea of consent."

Pedophiles are not attracted to the person, they are attracted to the age. Once the object of their sick affection gets too old, they will be tossed aside like trash. This is why pedophilia is also classed as a paraphilia, because they're attracted to a thing, not a person.

That doesn't mean I have suggested that I am generally similar to him.  So, there are similarities here, and it's uncomfortable for me to, but our outrage shouldn't cloud our logic if we can help it.  As far as the difference between the two things, the important thing to remember is that homosexuality is a sexual orientation, whereas pedophilia is not a sexual orientation.

They may fantasize about consensual sex with underage minors, but know that would never happen and just have to cope with that for their lifetime.  You sound like a religious person who believes atheists cannot be moral by default, but instead you believe that  pedophiles have to be criminals, have to fantasize about rape, etc. etc. etc. Pedophilia is just the attraction to children.

Basically my stance is if it doesn't hurt anyone, and doesn't break the law, go for it. But the moment breaks the law, hurts someone, or it might start encouraging and supporting others who may be breaking the law or just all around being a terrible human being (child sexualization, child porn, any sort of sex trade, etc.) it is reprehensible and they need to face legal action, punishment, or whatever repercussions come from it.  So if a pedophile recognizes all this, and doesn't act on their fetish, we should not be villainizing them or persecuting them, but the moment they step over that line THEN they are a sex offender, and should face the consequences."

It sounds to me like he is asking whether we no the treatments are effective, not whether it is desirable to attempt to correct.    (+269) It's not a disease, it's just as much how they're born as it is for gay people. The thing is, gay men and lesbians can fuck each other all day and everyone is consenting. Pedophiles cannot.

No, he said that it is different. He explicitly identified the difference. He also noted that he is oversimplifying things, which he is. He might be correct that there is no way to reverse pedophilia in people, but that it is something they need to learn to cope with.

You've misread this comment as well. It seems to be saying (with the word 'just', specifically) that this sort of treatment is pointless and unneccesary. If pedophilia is a mental illness (and let's face it, it is) then just like any other mental illness it cannot simply be switched on or off, and a reasoned scientific approach to treatment and harm reduction is desirable.

Hence why the issue at hand is Don't Act On Your Attractions if it involves another party that can Never Ever consent.  It is just like homosexuality in that it is likely something that cannot just be ""turned off"" and be ""fixed"" no matter what society hopes for. It is NOT just like homosexuality in that the homosexuals are fine finding consensual partners and being able to actually satisfy their sexual wants, while pedophiles can never and should never do that."

It is categorically not like homosexuality at all."
circlebroke,3d6dds,pajam,2,Tue Jul 14 16:11:37 2015 UTC,"The thing is the people saying ""hey guys it's just like homosexuality"" is that not long ago at all, homosexuality was seen as a choice. People wanted to fix gay people and send them to camps or pray the gay away. When that is impossible, it's just the way they are. Also, people would often assume homosexuals were just deviants by default. They could never be good people.  That is why people are making a comparison. It's not anyone saying that acting on that sexuality/sexual urges is the same (because that's when consent comes into play and is the HUGE dividing factor showing how majorly different they are in that realm). But the main point is attraction to children is likely something someone is stuck with. Perhaps it was how they were born, or long term just developed it. But either way it's likely something that cannot be ""fixed"" ""turned off"" or ""prayed away."" Also just because someone is a pedophile does not make them a deviant or a criminal, they don't have to be a bad person if they never act on that fetish/sexual tendency/desires/etc.  That is the parallel people are making. Sure adult people can also have rape fantasies, and the only time that is acceptable is with a consenting partner in a agreed upon role play environment with safe words, etc. But people who have rape fetishes just haven't had a major role in pop culture recently to make the parallel easier to clearly see.  Edit: Also, rape is a crime, pedophilia is not. Pedophilia is just an attraction. So it would be more like comparing it to those people with rape fantasies (like high level dom/sub, bondage, etc.). Although in the end it always comes down to, most other people can find consensual partners. Pedophiles cannot. So they need to just deal with coping mechanisms to never act on their desires over trying to ""fix"" them. If it's possible great, but recently listening to a public radio Freakonomics episode on sex offenders in general, it sounds like it may be a lost cause to try and treat/cure sex offenders in general."

circlebroke,3d6dds,aperson1729,0,Tue Jul 14 17:52:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'd like a link to any of the info/summary on pedophilia if you have it handy. There is a lot that book covers.   It wouldn't surprise me if pedophilia was a mental disorder, it's just no one has ever shared info identifying it as one with me. And since it is often seen as simply another sexual preference or fetish, considering no one else's sexual fetishes or preferences are thought of as possible disorders, it seemed to me like people were just reacting in absolutes on this one fetish just due to the sensitivity of the issue and the dire consequences that would arise when someone acting on pedophilia leads to a crime. So is there a point where we start treating those people in dom/sub relationships as having a disorder? Furries? etc. It's possible all these sorts of fetishes have some sort of disorder involved with them and pedophiles just got the short end of the stick having the disorder that attracts them to minors who can't consent.  I see it also lists Gender Dysphoria as a disorder, which is interesting. Transexuals and those who identify as another gender are becoming accepted and having a civil righs movement and growing awareness. And it is nice to see the treatment isn't so much a way to ""fix them"" as to allow them to become what they identify as through hormone therapy, surgery, and more. That's a nice way to treat it as opposed to forcing them to be the gender they were born as and follow society's norms, or what makes the masses comfortable. The problem is with pedophilia, we cannot allow them to be what they feel comfortable being. It is somewhat of an outlier due to it involving the possibility of another party, one who could never consent by definition.  And if there is preventative help that would allow anyone to come forward who aren't criminals and not have a stigma, or be put on a registry or a list, that would be amazing. My main concern is people treating pedophilia as a crime by default and pre-judging people, making it hard for those who are innocent to proactively reach out for help  And as to some of the studies I mention as to the issues with follow up treatment, registry, etc. of sex offenders, a recent episode of WNYC's Freakonomics goes over some long term effects (or lack there) of the registry especially, follow up treatment, chances of recidivism, etc. This is not specific to pedophilia, but sex offenses in general - but the stigma attached to coming forward is a huge factor that greatly affects moving forward with proactively helping pedophiles."
circlebroke,3d6dds,pajam,2,Tue Jul 14 18:18:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'd like a link to any of the info on pedophilia if you have it handy.    Pedophilic Disorder (A/K/A Pedophilia) is one of a classification of mental disorders called ""Paraphilic Disorders.""  http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Paraphilic%20Disorders%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf  Note that other paraphilias can be expressed harmlessly, and aren't considered disorders in that case, where pedophilia is an exception, and is regarded as a mental disorder no matter how the pedophile feels about it.   It wouldn't surprise me if pedophilia was a mental disorder,   It shouldn't surprise you, because it is a mental disorder.   So is there a point where we start treating those people in dom/sub relationships as having a disorder? Furries?   The DSM has changed so that the medical community doesn't do that. The ""pendulum"" is moving in the other direction.   Except for pedophilia, which is still regarded as harmful mental disorder, and likely always will be.    I see it also lists Gender Dysphoria as a disorder   The diagnostic criteria for this are different than for pedophilia.   My main concern is people treating pedophilia as a crime by default and pre-judging people,    I disagree. I think we shun pedophiles as much as possible.  Why would anyone who thought pedophilia was natural and normal seek treatment?   er some long term effects (or lack there) of the registry especially,    Who gives a shit? The registry isn't some attempt at treating sex offenders. It's a way to let you know who to not hire as a babysitter.  Maybe you should consider that you don't actually know what you're talking about. I mean, you didn't know that pedophilia is a mental disorder, so maybe you don't actually understand this issue better than the people who have devoted their lives to researching it."
circlebroke,3d6dds,yarr_be_my_password,2,Tue Jul 14 18:46:15 2015 UTC,"That is why people are making a comparison.    it is an incorrect comparison   Also just because someone is a pedophile does not make them a deviant or a criminal   by definition, liking children sexually does make one a deviant. If you haven't acted on that attraction then you are not a criminal, this is true.    That is the parallel people are making.   then make a correct parallel, compare it to rape. Because it is nothing like homosexuality or heterosexuality.    Edit: Also, rape is a crime, pedophilia is not.   Incorrect. Both are crimes if acted upon. Both are legal if all you do is think about them but not act on them. See what a perfect comparison it is?"
circlebroke,3d6dds,Uncerious,2,Tue Jul 14 18:58:23 2015 UTC,"Rape is a crime. Rape is an action. Rape is a choice.  Pedophilia is not a crime. Pedophilia is not an action. Pedophilia is not a choice.  If someone acts on their pedophilia, then it could become problematic, but that still depends. Acting on Pedophilia could involve a number of things:   masturbating to fantasies in your head? Fine go for it. Nothing wrong. being sexual with a consenting adult but playing up the fetish with role play, costumes, etc. in a consensual matter? Fine. Go for it. Totally cool. masturbating to child porn - Illegal. Not okay. Fuels off the abuse/mistreatment/sexualization of minors, and is a crime. distributing/creating child porn - Illegal. Not Okay. Even worse than the above. sexually engaging with a minor - Illegal. Not okay. Minors cannot consent and this is unequivocally Rape (see above for a status of rape)   Overall those adults who have rape fantasies would be a more appropriate comparison on the whole. However, when someone is using the ""it's just the way it is"" aspect of homo/heterosexuality as a comparison, that is all there is to it, and works perfectly well as a comparison. It's your own fault you are putting words into people's mouths and saying it is an overall comparison."
circlebroke,3d6dds,Intortoise,2,Tue Jul 14 17:01:45 2015 UTC,"I was with you for a while, but /u/DoxxingShillDownvote makes a good point.  All fantasies of the sort involve statutory rape by definition, there is no exception.  I'm all for comparing it to homosexuality in that it's probably not a choice, though.  That's generally how an analogy works - you're not comparing the entire concept, you're comparing some small part of the concept.  Otherwise, you would be comparing A to A.  But I also understand the issue in the comparison, in that homosexuals don't really appreciate being put in the same category as pedophiles."
circlebroke,3d6dds,uguysareassholes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:18:21 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they don't. I think it's just something people need to consider when talking about ""treatment"" ""prevention"" etc. Recently studies have been made about sexual offenders and it's been shown that things like the registry, etc. don't have any effect on prevention and there are possibilities it encourages people to act on their sexual deviance more because they have nothing left to lose, being ostracized by the community already.  If pedophilia is indeed an attraction you are born with/stuck with. It is important to draw attention to that and react to it accordingly. And the recent big changes in public perception of homosexuality is the clearest well-known parallel of that concept available, so I feel that is why it is the one being used.  If we are trying to focus on the proper way to prevent sexual abuse of minors, we need to throw all generalizations and prejudice aside and tackle the issue as it is. Not with all our biases and judgment attached."

You should perhaps learn to accept human biology as it is, or you'll always be this angry. The fact that most men will probably be 'attracted' to a good looking 15 year old is a fact and you know it. Acting on that is in almost any case going to be a bad thing though, at least if you're quite older.   Damn I slept with a 19 year-old   It's pretty obvious that many 19 year olds look more prepubescent than certain 15 year olds.

circlebroke,3d4x97,OIP,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:43:50 2015 UTC,"It's incredibly unpleasant. I witnessed one horrific relationship in which the male was (a.) unemployed, (b.) not looking for work, (c.) dropped out of college, (d.) running up bills/debts from asshole shit like gambling, buying too many video games, buying expensive firearms, and eating/drinking out all the time, yet (e.) still constantly haranguing his employed/100% breadwinner girlfriend about how she wasn't earning enough money for them to also get into flipping houses, playing the stock market and other crazy shit. Thankfully, she ended up leaving that dude (he eventually shacked up with some lonely girl with money), but it was fucking heart-rending for a while. Having talked to this prick a few times at get-togethers, I was downright astounded at the levels of delusion and entitlement that served as the baseline to his whole disposition...it didn't matter that he was mooching off of his girlfriend to a crazy degree because her earning that much money was evidence of 'society being PC bullshit, man'. He also lived by a belief that he was always just a hair away from that one good investment or power-move that would be his 'big break', i.e. that which would render his partner's contribution meaningless."

None of the jokes from It's Always Sunny come from the gang getting things right and succeeding due to their immaturity; they come from how their immaturity is always their downfall, and how they are constantly completely unaware that they're setting themselves up for defeat. Edit it a little differently and it goes from a goofy live action cartoon to a Rescue Me style tragicomedy about broken people. Likewise with Archer; there's a lot of heart and pathos that isn't apparent to casual viewers.   Sure assholes still end up on screen. The difference is that their asssholishness is called out for what it is. Reddit is sad they can't be assholes without consequence anymore."

Upon looking at the comment histories of the users I've interacted with who have chosen to troll on their personal accounts, several have expressed loneliness from the inability to find a girlfriend in their submitted links.    That, and less than a week ago on an r/circlebroke thread, a user who called another user ""suicidal"" for being a well-paid white male tech worker having empathy for stigmatized minorities had quite a post stick out like a sore thumb in the middle of ""women, minorities, and service workers are inferior and ruining everything""-comment/rants: a post asking for recommendations of ""good gender therapists for a MAAB"" who has been taking hormones for a while.

circlebroke,3d576w,GodOfAtheism,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:22:25 2015 UTC,"Norms were a lot different then compared to now.    It was viewed as nothing more than entertainment back then.

circlebroke,3d576w,mattwan,10,Tue Jul 14 03:39:03 2015 UTC,"Both shows were definitely not the norm though. All in the Family and Sanford and Sons were airing at the same time as Happy Days, The Brady Bunch, and the Mary Tyler Moore Show, among others.  Married with Children was around at the same time as Friends, E.R. Seinfeld (The only show really close to it in subversiveness.), Simpsons, Fresh Prince, and basically all of TGIF.  There's definitely still boundary pushing shows... just the boundaries have changed. Always Sunny being a huge current example there.   It's the same with movies really. Why take a risk on an Inception (Which, btw, was a risk for them.) when a Transformers 2 is a guaranteed money maker? I don't like it, but I certainly understand it.    Personal opinion: I'd say we probably have more boundary pushing now than we did 20 years ago. Would a show where the protagonist was a guy who made drugs (Or was a serial killer for that matter) fly back in 1990? Would South Park have succeeded back in 1987 (instead of 1997?)? The Wire? Kinda doubtful on all counts there."

The Dukes were pretty much disowned by Warner Bros, and the same can be said of Disney and Song Of The South.  I love classic country music, stuff like Johhny Cash, and Waylon Jennings. Nowadays, artists with a subversive side aren't allowed on the radio. A perfect example of this is Sturgill Simpson. His song Turtles All The Way Down is classic country with a psychedelic twist, and mentions of mind-altering drugs and lizards.  It's not a black and white issue. Your examples are great.

When facts are in question, it's time for a lit review!  I went to the New York Times Historical database and ran a search for (""archie bunker"" AND race), then sorted the results from oldest to newest. Here are the titles of the first four articles:   ""TV: Are Racism and Bigotry Funny?: C.B.S. 'Family' Series May Shock Some"" (12 Jan 1971)  ""Can Bigotry Be Laughed Away? It's Worth a Try"" (21 Feb 1971)  ""Laughing While We Face Our Prejudices"" (11 Apr 1971)  ""As I Listened to Archie Say 'Hebe'"" (12 Sep 1971)   That last was an intriguing enough title that I opened the article, which reads exactly like a ""I'm a minority who's cool with South Park"" article today. It's full of brief quotes and references to other commentary that finds All in the Family objectionable or questionable, but the author is basically ""we need to reveal the real-world prejudices"" and stuff.  I stopped at four because five is clearly only mentioning the show in passing. Result number 8 is suggestive, though:   ""Who knows what frustrations lurk in the hearts of X million Americans? George Wallace knows -- and he's off and running"" (02 Jan 1972)   So I feel comfortable concluding that, during its first year, All in the Family was seen as an object of discussion for things other than its entertainment value."

At least from what it seems like Yishan is saying is that rather than Alexis admitting it was him who did it he let Pao take the fall even pass the point where she was harassed and the front page of r/all was littered with bigotry toward her.   Yishan is asserting that Alexis could've said it was him [which is the baffling part because alexis did] and that most of the hate would've have flung alexis' way and that motivated him not to do it. He mightve also been hinting that Pao didn't want Victoria fired but alexis' wanted differently and she deffered to him because he was her boss.

If nothing else, I'd worry that he'd make that kind of joke around Hypothetical Kid and I'd have to have the ""edgy jokes can hurt people"" conversation.  Like, not a majority of my teachers, but a good third were male growing up. Of those, I've only known two to comment on how people are too protective of their kids around men. One was the junior high gym teacher who was known for having a bed in his office, insisting that the girls wear shorter, tighter shorts all the time unless they were basically just wearing underwear (and just the girls, boys could wear whatever) and taking cheerleaders out for private fancy dinners. The other was the high school french teacher who made a point of friending all the female students on Facebook and regularly advised the guys with such gems as ""after a bottle of wine, girls might like you more."" None of the other teachers ever had any problems whatsoever, even though a lot of them did one on one work or had extracurriculars with only female students.   Like, sometimes there might be a reason why people are wary of some men, even if they're not actually pedophiles."
circlebroke,3d3mn2,ponyproblematic,6,Mon Jul 13 13:07:31 2015 UTC,"I work in a kids' science museum. I'm mid-20s & the main language I work in is not my mother tongue. I talk to kids, I interact with them, I'm sometimes incredibly awkward because I'm still not 100% comfortable with the language. When kids are lost, I hold them by the hand, walk them around where I found them to see if we can find their parents & sometimes take them to the counter in order to make an announcement for their parents to say that they're lost. Often, if they're tourists, I have no language in common with these lost kids.  It's never happened to me. I've never even gotten a vibe of wariness or distrust. Neither have, to the best of my knowledge, any of my male coworkers. The parents are, unsurprisingly, just grateful that you're trying to teach/entertain/help their kids.  Maybe there is something to this phenomenon that reddit bangs on about. Maybe I'm an anomaly for never having experienced this.

There was this kid with his mom who got distracted by one of the displays, realized he got separated, and tried to run back to his mom. He tripped and fell next to the 30-year-old guy, and the guy bent down to see if he was okay. The kid started crying, and when the mom turned around, she started throwing a fit. I mean, all she saw was her kid on the ground in tears and some dude trying to shut him up. We (myself and a few employees) had to explain to her what actually happened. So, I mean, these things do happen, whether or not they're rare. It is a legitimate concern for older men."

But when the topic turns to mens' rights, they completely and unironically embrace the victim mantle for themselves.

circlebroke,3d3mn2,nothinghere3,18,Mon Jul 13 17:27:19 2015 UTC,As someone who was drugged and raped by a woman and her daughter. Women absolutely can be the aggressors in sexual situations. The fact that we as a society don't accept that makes me sad. I know they are talking about pedophiles. I am just pointing out that sexual aggression is not a male only thing. I was raped when I was 21 and still a virgin. [+1456]   This comment and the others remarking on the fact that there is a perception that women can't be rapists or child molesters is absolutely accurate. Why are you taking apart a rape victim's words in order to imply that gender doesn't matter in society's perception of sex crimes?
circlebroke,3d3mn2,LashisaBread,8,Mon Jul 13 11:51:27 2015 UTC,"I being a woman myself have encountered women that have tried to sexually violate me so I know where you're coming from and I agree, it is a terrible thing that society does to place such expectations on genders. For society to assume all men are evil or possess the ability to do horrible things makes men feel as though they can only become angry or strong in order to show manliness. With society placing women as angels or the ones that cannot do evil things/helpless, it makes women the eternal victims and feel as though they should be forgiven for any bad things they do. [+602]   This actually has some accuracy to it. Men, in general, are seen as the more aggressive gender (this is biologically true in the general case thanks to good ol' testosterone) and as such sets women up as the more fragile of the two genders. This naturally means that men are going to be seen as more ""evil,"" or more capable of doing bad things, although ""evil"" is a strong word for it.   A female paedophile would never jump into my mind. ""This child was molested"" instant thought would be a male.   Well open your mind then, nigga. Dayum. [+143]    This is also pretty accurate. Of course, I think this is more in place because of the common news stories regarding priests molesting alter servers. The additional comment is, indeed, stupid.   I'm glad they highlighted the fact that pedophiles have a high likelihood of they themselves being abused when they were children. This fact can be used to prevent a lot of future child abuse, but it seems like not much is done about it right now because unfortunately it's socially taboo. [+433]   I think you read into this one wrong. I see this more of a ""if we can show parents that children with abusive or negligent parents have a higher rate of paedophilia, then we can start solving the issue at its source."" Maybe I'm the only one, but that's how I saw it. He doesn't look like he's saying ""just accept them because they can't help it!"" He even specifically said that the knowledge could be used to prevent a lot of future child abuse, which implies that this would prevent paedophilia by result. Are you just looking for reasons to hate some people without even reading what they're actually meaning? I mean, no offense to you, but it doesn't look like you're really reading into these much.   Do you think that people have a choice as to whether or not they are pedophiles? I feel it should be compared to homosexuality, it is not a decision you choose to make, it just simply is. Also, do you think we could be preventing more child abuse by tearing down the social stigma of pedophilia and allowing people to openly address their concerns in order to get help? [+60]   I'm mixed about this. On one hand, I feel that because it's a fetish (albeit a disgusting, illegal one) it may share the same trait other fetishes have, like feet or domination (the trait being: you can't really help what you find arousing.) On the other hand, he's equating it to homosexuality (which, I guess I can see where he's coming from, because, in a way, ""gay"" technically is a fetish) which I think he's both wrong and right. Mostly because of that ""gay is technically a fetish, too"" thing.   They have cause and effect mixed up. People didn't hate her for her race or her gender, they hated her for her actions, and then often used nasty slurs against her race and gender. It's still ugly, but no one cared about either one until she started fucking with how things were run, and they weren't a real concern even then, simply a means by which to insult someone that they loathed. [+8]   Personally, I feel that this has a point as well. Nobody really cared about Pao when she joined Reddit as the CEO; it was when she did something that got put into the circlejerk as ""bad"" that she started getting hate. I don't agree with the hate, but I also don't agree that all of these people are all racists and sexists. I think they used racist and sexist remarks, but calling someone a bitch when she did something you perceive as wrong does not make you sexist. When the thing that is wrong ends up being perfectly normal and you're seeing it through a kind of ""oh, this woman shouldn't be making money!"" kind of view, then it becomes sexist.   It's the difference between a woman kicking you in the balls and you calling her a bitch versus a woman buying a pull-up bar and you telling her to get back in the kitchen. Maybe it's because I play a lot of Dota, and people there tend to just scrape for any ammo they can get if you do something they don't like. Do you have an American location on an EU server? You'll get blasted for being a shitty American. Not because you're American, but because you're different. It's the same mentality with bullies. But this is just how I see this stuff.   I think the vilification of men is an accurate description of what I sometimes fear. I'm terribly anxious when kids get too close to me, or make an effort to interact with me in public. Whether they are just a friends kid or a total stranger, I'm constantly trying to avoid any kind of interaction in fear of being thought of as a possible Paedophile. [+32]   I think this is a legitimate concern for the guys that have patchy beards and tend to weigh 200+ pounds made up entirely of fat. Some guys also just tend to look creepy. I think this is (for the most part) controllable assuming you take control of your life and commit to bettering your appearance.    See also the women who were swooning over Justin Bieber when he was 15-16. It's not pedophilia, but still, we constantly see men demonized for the same thing, while with women it could hardly be seen as more harmless. [+24]   yeah but teenage girls are casually made out to be sex objects in the media all of the time, so it still does go both ways. [+4]    I've seen some 16/17 year olds back in high school that could easily pass as 18+. 13 year olds, not so much. Not saying it's alright to fap to teens; it isn't. I think it's completely wrong that the media is trying to get all these Disney channel stars and such to do these racy music videos and shit. It's disgusting, but it sells apparently.    Wait, I didn't realize there was actually controversy regarding this subject outside of Tumblr... [+7]   In all honesty, they aren't exactly known for being rational or accepting. That being said, it's a completely irrelevant comment, I agree.   This should be fun. Reddit loves pedophiles but hates women. Which instinct will prevail in the case of the female pediphile? [-44]   Where possibly do you get the idea that Reddit likes paedophiles? All I've seen is open disgust and offers of violent retribution. [+15]    Reddit definitely doesn't ""love"" paedophiles. I've seen far more people against it than for it. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen anyone on reddit straight up say ""paedophiles are just fine!"" I've seen people say ""we need to help paedophiles get rid of their sick fetish"" but that's more of a sympathy to cure than a ""love.""  Also, where are your counterpoints for any of these? It seems you're just making sarcastic comments without actually trying to get their side of the story. You're being a douchebag, OP."

One person made a claim that Justin Bieber was an example of bias people have (accepting creepy behavior of women / shaming creepy behavior of men). But the other commenter pointed out that this was not a good example because teenage girls are also commonly sexualized in our society. I can't really figure out what you disagree with about this.    Had to get the pedophilia apology in there.   Can you point out, more specifically, why this is ""pedophilia apology"" or what else is wrong with this statement? I'm not sure if his statement is accurate, but I do think understanding the root causes of pedophilia could be a useful factor in understanding how we may be able to fix these people and stop them from being a danger to society (if that is possible, at least).    Society doesn't pay attention to male rape! Women can do it too!   Why are you being so dismissive towards a person who is just sharing his experience and his feelings on this subject?

I'm sorry about your traumatic experience, but complaining about a 'circlejerk' doesn't demean your position.  It's not like when we're not on reddit, MRA is taboo. It's just that MRA here in England is much more about equality, bisexuality, dress sense (New Age Men) and obviously female rape. And we don't call it MRA, we call it equality. When you have a 80% male site taking this 'movement' into the extremes, it's sexism, and a vast overcompensation of the public mood. What the public calls equality is immediately branded 'tumblrism' or 'feminism'.  You've got to realise that I and many other people only check this site twice a day, and if everyday we see the same and same thing said about women, it smacks less of equality and more of teenage angst.   And let's face it, we know the frontpage American redditor never leaves his room and types angrily with wotsit (cheetos?) stained fingers.

No, the mistake was banning one awful sub and then letting a ton of other awful subs remain. It was odd for all sides. Sure, FPH is real dumb and totally deserved to be banned, but what about all the awful outright racist subs?   That's the mistake.   Also, for the record, I enjoy this sub because it makes me feel a little more sane when I see all the eugenics-heads and anti-women sentiment on mainstream reddit. That and I feel like there are some reasonably level discussions here. I'm staying for the great comic book and Star Wars subs.

Also, if she's gonna be selective at all, I'd think FPH was a really good one to start with. Like, I don't remember her saying she'd only ban the subs she banned, and that the rest were staying, but even if she was, reddit isn't missing any good content without fph.  For example, say you work at subway, and you have a new manager. Now, at the subway you work in, the knives are dull, the toaster ovens break down, the flatbread never comes in on time, and the break room's TV is broken. If your manager ordered a new set of knives the first week she was hired, would you be mad about her ""selective"" improvements? Not the best analogy, but I think you get my point."

I thought it was awful, bullying-enabling bullshit for insecure idiots. Reddit was right to ban it.   It's not like banning 5 subs is that much more difficult than banning 15 subs. They had to know there would be some sort of back lash.   Also, the backlash against Pao was totally due to reddit's distate for women and minorities. For once, there was a clear SJW target for them to hold on to, and boy did they hold on to her. I think she probably made some mistakes, but did she deserve even 1/10th of the hate she got? No way. She was trying to make reddit a better place, but it was just a little misguided if you ask me.   Like I said, it was just odd how it all went down. Ban something that's awful, but not the stuff that even more awful. To follow your analogy (though I don't think it works really), it's as if all the knives were dull, but she only replaced the ones that were most visible to customers to make it look like that Subway has sharp knives. But we still have a bunch of shitty dull knives left."

circlebroke,3cygzl,LGBTLibrarian,22,Sat Jul 11 23:36:20 2015 UTC,"There does seem to be a theme of ""fixing"" the ""mental disorder"", which does signal a lack of knowledge of history, medicine, biology etc. With the developmet of psychiatry in the early 20th century, and the new procedures that came with it such as electro shock treatment, the general consensus for ""treatment"" of such ""deviancies"" did consist of such things. The most infamous example from history being Atascadero State Hospital:   At Atascadero State Hospital, doctors were permitted under an obscure California law to commit those who practiced sodomy into the hospital.   Once admitted, men and women were rendered mentally disabled through castration, lobotomies, forced chemical treatments and experimental treatments, such as a drug which simulated the effects of drowning. This earned it the tag of ""Dachau For Queers""  The most notorious was a Dr. Walter J. Freeman who perfected the ice pick lobotomy. He jammed an ice pick through a homosexual's eyes into the brain and performed a primitive lobotomy. According to records, he treated over 4,000 patients this way around America and it is estimated that nearly 30% to 40% were homosexuals. He believed deeply this was the only way to ""cure homosexuality"".   The difficulty in documenting so much of this history is that most of the records, history and data have been destroyed. Families were often adamant about not leaving any trace of the overwhelming shame of having a homosexual in the family and they often erased the gay relative's presence on earth. Many individuals who were terrorized died in the institutions or were made mentally disabled with an inability to recall. Or unable because of their torture to share their journal.    The NHS in the UK also had practices such as 3-day long induced nausea courses until the 80s which can be seen in the documentary ""Cure me, I'm gay"" by Dr. Christian Jessen.   The consensus remained unchanged until German born sexologist Harry Benjamin was contacted by Alfred Kinsey in 1948::   In 1948, in San Francisco, Benjamin was asked by Alfred Kinsey, a fellow sexologist, to see a child who ""wanted to become a girl"" despite being born male; the mother wished for help that would assist rather than thwart the child. Kinsey had encountered the child as a result of his interviews for Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, which was published that year. Kinsey and Benjamin had seen nothing of the like previously.   This child rapidly led Benjamin to understand that there was a different condition to that of transvestism, under which adults who had such needs had been classified to that time. Despite the psychiatrists with whom Benjamin involved in the case not agreeing on a path of treatment, Benjamin eventually decided to treat the child with estrogen (Premarin, introduced in 1941), which had good results because the estrogen changed the body to what the transgender child thought it should be and helped arrange for the mother and child to go to Germany, where surgery to assist the child could be performed but, from there, they ceased to maintain contact, to Benjamin's regret.   However, Benjamin continued to refine his understanding and went on to treat several hundred patients with similar needs in a similar manner, often without accepting any payment. However, due to the personal political opinions of the American doctors and a Danish law prohibiting sex reassignment surgery on noncitizens, these doctors referred the letter-writers to the one doctor of the era who would aid transsexual individuals, Harry Benjamin. Benjamin conducted treatment with the assistance of carefully selected colleagues of various disciplines.   The legal, social and medical background to this in the United States, as in many other countries, was often a stark contrast, since wearing items of clothing associated with the opposite sex in public was often illegal, castration of a male was often illegal, anything seen as homosexuality was often persecuted or illegal, and many doctors considered all such people (including children) best treated by forced treatments such as drugged detention, electroconvulsive therapy, or lobotomy.   Publicity surrounding his patient Christine Jorgensen brought the issue into the mainstream in 1952 and led to a great many people presenting for assistance, internationally. In the preface of Christine Jorgensen's autobiography, Dr. Benjamin also gives Jorgensen credit for the advancement of his studies. He wrote, ""Indeed Christine, without you, probably none of this would have happened; the grant, my publications, lectures, etc.""   When the New York Daily News, December 1, 1952, carried a front-page story (under the headline ""Ex-GI Becomes Blonde Bombshell"") announcing that Christine Jorgensen had become the recipient of the first ""sex change"", it caused a sensation. However, the claim that this was the first was not true, as this type of surgery had previously been performed by pioneering German doctors in the late 1920s and early 1930s.   She became an instant celebrity, using the platform to advocate for transgender people, and became known for her directness and polished wit. She also worked as an actress and nightclub entertainer, and recorded several songs. Jorgensen grew up in the Bronx, New York City. Shortly after graduating from high school in 1945, she was drafted into the US Army for World War II. After her service she attended several schools, worked, and around this time heard about transitioning surgery.   She travelled to Europe, and in Copenhagen, Denmark, obtained special permission to undergo a series of operations starting in 1951. During a stopover in Copenhagen to visit relatives, she met Dr. Christian Hamburger, a Danish endocrinologist and specialist in rehabilitative hormonal therapy. Jorgensen then stayed in Denmark and took hormone replacement therapy under Dr. Hamburger's direction. She obtained special permission from the Danish Minister of Justice to undergo a series of operations in that country. She referred to how the surgery affected her in a letter to friends on October 8, 1951:   ""As you can see by the enclosed photos, taken just before the operation, I have changed a great deal. But it is the other changes that are so much more important. Remember the shy, miserable person who left America? Well, that person is no more and, as you can see, I'm in marvelous spirits.""   But it wasn't until the 60s did people in general start to distinguish between ""common queens"", such as drag queens, and transgender as an identity:   In 1966, Harry Benjamin wrote the Transsexual Phenomenon which further helped transgender people establish their identity. Though he had already published papers and lectured to professional audiences extensively, Benjamin's 1966 book was immensely important as the first large work describing and explaining the affirmative treatment path he pioneered.   In 1963, perhaps his first transsexual, female-to-male, who was later known as Reed Erickson (1917-1992), did seek help from Benjamin. With Erickson's inherited fortune, he established the Erickson Educational Foundation to publish booklets to help educate the public about those who are transgender. But most of Benjamin's patients lived (and many still live) quiet lives.   Exposure to the mainstream continues in the 60s, with transgender women appearing on TV having discussions about their experiences:   ""If society would let me live my life as I want to live it; which is a respectable, normal, ordinary woman, period. I don't run around in mini skirts, I don't run around with my hair sticking 7 foot off my head and all the rest of the stuff the queens do, which is a category I'm classified as, a 'common queen', period. I can't get away from it no matter what I do, I'm put into this category, I'm labeled as 'this'""   ""I went out to try and get a job in men's clothing - ""no, you're too effeminate, you're a f*ggot, you're a sissy, you're this, you're that."" ""So I thought well, groovy. So I put on the clothes I usually wear, which is girls clothes. I went out to try and get a job as a woman. This doesn't work; you last 3 weeks before somebody recognises you who prefers to be a hooker and a tramp, turns around to your boss and says 'so and so is such and such' and that's the end of that job.""   ""So finally it reaches a point where you get disgusted with the whole damn bit and you go out on the streets. And you find out you can make $100 a night and you say to hell with it; why should I be legitimate, why should I be respectable, why should I be anything?""   ""A few years ago I was grocery shopping and I got thrown in jail for female impersonation. I've never felt I'm impersonating a female; I am a female!""    I think the increasing exposure and decrimininalisation of LGBT people, as well as Benjamin's book and the progression of psychiatry, fasciliated the ability for the medical community, general public and gender non-conforming people themselves to be able to differentiate between the bioloigcal and physcological differences between them and change consensus.   With progress into biology and understanding of the brain, we also see biological influences for transsexualism, examples of which can be found under the neuro biology section of /r/LGBTlibrary. This shifts understanding from a pereption of ""a male who thinks he is or wants to be female"" to ""a female born into a male body"", and it would be much easier to change the body to match the brain than it would be to make the brain match the body, when you take the history and current possibilities of medicine into account. Ignorance of those factors as well as a perception of gender being based on the body and not the brain that leads people to other conclusions IMO"

SRS is considered harmful by many because it does not reduce suicide rates to justify the potential harm. 80% of people with gender dysphoria come out of it. Think of the horror of after having gone through SRS you wake up one day without dysphoria anymore.   I never advocated ostracizing anyone. I said people who are mentally ill should not be told they are normal or used for political points. Getting the mentally ill into a treatment program which will help form the backbone of a support network (if they were ostracized which is very common depending on the mental illness) for them is crucial. This is the exact opposite of ostracizing them! This is getting them in touch with people that can help them!  It's not concern trolling.

I am of the opinion that the advice of medical professionals is more valuable than that of anonymous internet comments, and medical professionals recommend HRT, sometimes SRS and living as the gender the affected person identifies as.   I never advocated ostracizing anyone. I said people who are mentally ill should not be told they are normal or used for political points. Getting the mentally ill into a treatment program which will help form the backbone of a support network (if they were ostracized which is very common depending on the mental illness) for them is crucial. This is the exact opposite of ostracizing them! This is getting them in touch with people that can help them!

He just links a thing saying ""He's against what the APA says"" but doesn't actually show where in that he is contradicting it. I just finished reading the article whose post you linked is in reply too. I see some places where the OP article actually outright agrees with his APA link. In fact I find some flaws in that it appears to weasel wording or hedging. Ex :""Therefore be it further resolved that APA recognizes the efficacy, benefit and medical necessity of gender transition treatments for appropriately evaluated individuals and calls upon public and private insurers to cover these medically necessary treatments;"" but they don't recommend it to people anymore.  So I can't actually find anyplace where he contradicts that policy. As in OP link he isn't saying to discriminate and the 1st is saying not to discriminate. Wut?  Second link. It cites the evidence he collected showing that 4/5 of the sexual abuse was 1 - homosexual in nature and 2 - minors but not qualified for pedophilia. Which is statutory rape and sodomy. in other words the catholic church had formed a culture saying those 2 things were OK. Moving on!  P2 is misleading. The swedish study says anyone who transitioned more than 10 years ago. So 10 year rates are higher than people who didn't receive SRS. The reason they make ANY note of 1989 is because that is the 10 year mark!  P3 is a single sentence. The OP article does not say to give less help. So this is a straw man.  P4 is setting up the strawman further. The rest are all cherry picked quotes from non peer reviewed or very small sample size studies."

Where people are getting sticky with you is that mental disorders are associated with behaviors and states that cause personal distress and impairment in societal functioning. Transgendered persons are, for the most part, only able to be considered 'disordered' because of how society treats them, and transitioning generally alleviates the distress otherwise.  With societal acceptance and willingness to let transgendered people live in a way that is congruent with their gender identify, Gender Dysphoria wouldn't really count as a disorder at all, unlike most other mental differences. That's why the new terminology."

The TIA thread I was in was talking about people who identify as something because it is trendy or different. That is much more than just how society treats them. In addition, if you do not honestly believe you are wrongly sexed then you don't have gender dysphoria. If you're male but live as a female and do not live under a delusion of actually being female then you're a transvestite which is a separate thing.  The new terminology catches more people under it.

circlebroke,3cygzl,exile_,6,Sun Jul 12 11:47:33 2015 UTC,"For me this just shows how fragile the gains of social progress are. One second people are celebrating the Supreme court's gay marriage decision and admiring the rainbow filters on their favorite celebrities' facebook pages, and then the next second they're dismissing LGTB people that they aren't familiar or comfortable with as ""unnatural"" or ""attention seeking"". As if this isn't exactly how people treated gay men & lesbians a decade ago.   How can they be willing to accept that sexual orientation is a broad spectrum, but then turn around and call gender a strict binary? It seems to go against the reddit branded spirit of free-thinking and enthusiasm for learning."
circlebroke,3cygzl,Zorseking34,6,Sun Jul 12 20:21:10 2015 UTC,"If all gender-culture was to be eliminated... Would there still be genderfluid people?  No, seriously...

If not, what characterizes a gender inherently?  Just asking..."
circlebroke,3cygzl,DuckThug,7,Sun Jul 12 21:37:47 2015 UTC,"I think this is where it's useful to point out the difference in gender identity and gender performance. We've probably all heard that sex is biological, and gender is social, but the increased visibility of trans* issues has raised the issue- what causes gender dysphoria if gender is only rooted in our societal perceptions?   Research has indicated that our gender identity is inherently rooted in our biology- gender dimorphic brain anatomy and androgen insensitivity during fetal development being the strongest avenues of research at the moment. Basically, we understand now that when the brain thinks of itself as being a man or woman (or neither) and the body's sex characteristics don't match, gender dysphoria is the result, and the best treatment we know of is to change the body to the brain, rather than ""fix"" the brain to match the body.   So to take it back to your question, I don't think there is any way to ever really eliminate gender-culture and the way gender is perceived by society. It can become more flexible, but it is almost certainly going to stick around. Gender fluidity definitely intersects the ideas of gender identity and performance, and probably leans more on either end depending on who's describing themselves."

Yeah; it doesn't work like that - inevitably people aren't just subbed to racist/hate subs, they'll also be subbed to ""normal"" subs (either the defaults, or hobby subs etc.), and although they may restrict their blatant racism to Coontown, they'll still spread those attitudes through the rest of Reddit either through their Coontown account or through an alt. For example, see /r/news whenever a news issue with a racial aspect pops up - you will find Coontown subbers commenting there.  Seriously, why would you want racist, hateful bigots on your website?

circlebroke,3cx1ay,tschwib,14,Sat Jul 11 20:29:06 2015 UTC,"She made some poor choices   I haven't been following this whole scene very closely, what do you mean?"
circlebroke,3cx1ay,GlassSoldier,-5,Sat Jul 11 20:32:25 2015 UTC,"The drama started with the /r/fatpeoplehate ban. That was reasonable given that they displayed picutres of imgur employees which choose to ban all submission from that subreddit.  What reddit didn't do was show clear evidence in their new policy. If they (and ellen) had presented clear evidence like ""Here is how fatpeoplehate doxxed this person, here is how they enocured to harrass this person"" and so on, I think they backlash would have been much smaller.  They also let go of an important /r/iama employee called victoria who was a major figure in organising interviews with celebs. The mod team apparently wasn't informed and therefore was pretty angry with the admins (and ellen) and blacked out /r/iama which caused a lot of other subreddits to follow.  Also Ellen Pao through out this drama never took the crticism seriously at all. During interviews she said that ""most reddit users don't really care"".  But of course you guys think she was the best CEO ever who was just perfect in everything she does and just the evil reddit userbase got her live ruined..."
circlebroke,3cx1ay,tschwib,21,Sat Jul 11 20:41:48 2015 UTC,"Except she wasn't responsible for either of those, most Reddit users actually don't care, and she doesn't have to justify anything to whiny redditors."

circlebroke,3cx1ay,c4a,-3,Sat Jul 11 21:32:02 2015 UTC,kn0thing fired Victoria   You cannot possibly know that. There are zero public details surrounding her firing.

circlebroke,3cx1ay,c4a,-5,Sun Jul 12 05:02:45 2015 UTC,As a CEO she is also responsible for everything her underlings do more or less. That is why she is payed a lot of money. Reddit has less than 100 employees. She should know about every hiring or firing. My company has a lot more employees and I'm sure my CEO knows if an important employee is fired.   There weren't many redditors who cared. They were just very loud about it.   You are repeating yourself and so am I: I don't think that is true. Is there any evidence?
circlebroke,3cx1ay,tschwib,8,Sat Jul 11 22:30:30 2015 UTC,"Ok, let's assume Pao ordered Victoria to be fired. That's not necessarily a bad decision, since we don't know why she was fired. The contingency plan was kn0thing's job.  Reddit had 163 million unique visitors last month. The Ellen Pao Should Step Down petition got 213,000 signatures. If we assume every one of those signatures is unique, that's a bit more than 0.1% of Reddit's visitors. Far, far less than a majority."

I think it's really important to mention that the mods were waiting on AMAs from celebrities who were left high and dry. One of them even flew to New York for the AMA, and pretty much had nowhere to go. It was an astounding fuck up on the part of the admins, who didn't really seem to have a real understanding of how AMAs worked."

Reddit, as a privately owned website, is allowed to ""censor"" (and I put that in quotes because if the teenagers here think that THIS is censorship, they need to get out more ) whatever they wish in order to secure funding to keep it in existence. A backlash can inform ownership of the best way to do that, meaning maybe we'll see T-Shirt Hell style ads here, but at the end of the day, ownership decides whether or not the ""safe space"" agenda brings in more traffic and starts to make at least enough money to keep it going."

Good Luck to Ellen Pao in whatever she does. This past summer so far has really demonstrated how ugly reddit can be, and how reprehensible some users reactions can be. But it goes without saying that there are MANY idiots on this site.   I hope she has some thick skin. For one, she's married (albeit to a scammer) but she can probably get laid more than 99% of the people who constantly shat on her on this site.

Trying to get someone drunk enough so that they will have sex with you is rape. That's what they were trying to get at.   Setting back womens rights about 50 years.   Sorry women! You can't get birth control, serve on a jury or get a credit card because of this ad."
circlebroke,3cwcvu,treebog,13,Sat Jul 11 10:18:20 2015 UTC,"That's part of their thing that they do. They think that increased rights for women should mean decreased responsibilities on their part - if women want equality, they should be willing to share equal culpability for a sexual assault that occurs when they are drunk. So they spin it that this is a patriarchal, protectionist law that women should be insulted about - it's saying you're too helpless to give informed consent when you are drunk, but a man isn't! That's sexist! The tragedy lies in how many women buy into this bullshit. The law actually says no such thing and a man can file a complaint about a ""drunken hookup"" as readily as a woman can."
circlebroke,3cwcvu,DeepStuffRicky,14,Sat Jul 11 12:06:37 2015 UTC,It's like they designed that ad to piss off everyone.

So I don't have a problem with people saying ""this is bullshit"". Because the design is bad, it feeds right into the ""false rape epidemic"" when it's probably just trying to say that people can't give consent when drunk.  But jesus christ Reddit just instantly blames this on feminists and assumes this poster represents the pinnacle of feminist theory. The imgur literally says ""FEMINISM"" at the top.   other things:   We literally don't know who designed the poster, why is this poster the fault of feminists now? This could have been put up by anybody.  This could be a series of posters, featuring different mixes of genders. We had those at my college campus, where it had gay men, lesbians, etc in the same scenario."
circlebroke,3cwcvu,Chuggsy,5,Sat Jul 11 14:12:07 2015 UTC,"It's funny. If anything, the ad shows why we really need feminism because the either the ad or the law forgot in this instance that women can also be responsible for actions.   It's precisely because of rape culture that women's agency and hence responsibility is denied as a possibility. The woman in the ad became nothing more than something that could be raped and the man became nothing more than something that does the raping. Only when we have these biases in mind, can we even BEGIN to discuss equality.  But the boogeyman SJWs want to kill all men. /s"

If the reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion, it may be a great website but it will never be a truly great community.

circlebroke,3cue9p,ArchGuardienneNoelle,26,Sat Jul 11 07:51:53 2015 UTC,Yep just read it. So glad that those who praise racist mass murderes have such wit.
circlebroke,3cue9p,veijeri,60,Fri Jul 10 21:31:16 2015 UTC,"Considering the guy had a manifesto not dissimilar to Brevik's, calling him a mass murderer is a nice whitewashing of what he really is. A terrorist. His actions were meant to inspire fear in the African American community and he is pro-segregationist (a political stance).   From his manifesto:   Segregation was not a bad thing. It was a defensive measure. Segregation did not exist to hold back negroes. It existed to protect us from them. And I mean that in multiple ways. Not only did it protect us from having to interact with them, and from being physically harmed by them, but it protected us from being brought down to their level. Integration has done nothing but bring Whites down to level of brute animals. The best example of this is obviously our school system.  Some people feel as though the South is beyond saving, that we have too many blacks here. To this I say look at history. The South had a higher ratio of blacks when we were holding them as slaves. Look at South Africa, and how such a small minority held the black in apartheid for years and years. Speaking of South Africa, if anyone thinks that think will eventually just change for the better, consider how in South Africa they have affirmative action for the black population that makes up 80 percent of the population.   It is far from being too late for America or Europe. I believe that even if we made up only 30 percent of the population we could take it back completely. But by no means should we wait any longer to take drastic action.    Either he is a terrorist, or we need to go full gambit and redefine terrorist as brown/muslim mass murderer. The double standards are getting tiresome. The guy clearly had a political goal and wished to achieve it through violence.   Sorry, had to get that off my chest."
circlebroke,3cue9p,jacob8015,14,Fri Jul 10 21:59:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry, bad choice of words in my part. I should have called him a terrorist yeah but, in fairness to me, I usually make the same mistake for Islamic terrorists. It's less a double standard and kore me being an idiot."
circlebroke,3cue9p,SRS_IS_GOD,11,Fri Jul 10 22:01:14 2015 UTC,I'm still with you; mass murder and terrorism are certainly not mutually exclusive.

The only consistent theme in the campaign to oust Pao was that they wanted rid of HER. Why? Well it doesn't take a team of sociologists and an extended content analysis to find out the most problematic things about Pao were her non-whiteness and non-maleness. You can see it in the conversations people are having now.  Now the dust has settled, do you see anyone insisting that reddit clarify and codify its position on content? Or demand that reddit change its corporate structure to focus on 'the community' instead of monetisation? I still haven't heard anyone ask the new leadership about the once fundamental question of whether new hires are going to be allowed to negotiate their salary. And what about the new CEO's partner - shouldn't we be getting a complete breakdown on their business affairs before we can decide if reddit's new leadership is corrupt? While were at it, is anybody asking about any past litigation they may have been involved in? None of that matters any more - because none of it ever mattered.   Pao got hounded out of a leadership role at a highly prominent tech company by an organised campaign of harassment based primarily on her gender and ethnicity. This has huge implications not just for reddit, but for any tech company with a public face.   I'm very disappointed that Pao quit, I thought the bile and naked anger being directed at her actually gave her a mandate (in the same way that any comments section on an article about feminism will prove the need for feminism). But I can also understand how shitty it must have been for her, so can't really blame her.   The last few paragraphs of the announcement, where reddit is chastised for harassing behaviour. ""Yes, we're going to indulge your temper tantrum this time, but you better cut that out because it's not nice!"". The message is really clear and chilling. Get in fucking line.

If we could straighten this out, meaning more men in education and more women in construction, the wage gap would decrease.

circlebroke,3ctxv6,GobtheCyberPunk,9,Sat Jul 11 00:22:17 2015 UTC,"Actually it's more than that - men in typically ""female"" employment sectors are paid more than women in those same jobs as well.  Part of it is the way women are socialized to not stand up for themselves and be assertive, pushing for promotions, pay increases, etc. that men often do.   However as much a problem is that women are still expected to carry the burden of taking care of kids and having ""flexible"" working conditions because there are no welfare policies that allow  mothers to both have a fulfilling full-time career and still raise their kids. Thus women more often work in part-time work and place limits on how far they can advance their career because they have to take care of their kids, to say nothing about women who abandon careers to take care of their kids - not women who wanted to be stay-at-home parents from the start, but women who wanted to have a career but ultimately had to become stay-at-home moms to take care of their kids.  So basically the problem is that our society does not support women who want to have the same career success as men."
circlebroke,3ctxv6,naked_short,4,Fri Jul 10 23:27:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. There have been studies that show most of the pay gap is due to job preference as OP suggested.   You're certainly correct that men still make more in each field but the portion of the gap explained by it is far lower than job preference. Being more likely to take extended time off or drop their career are also large explaining factors as you suggest.   Also, when women come back into the workplace after an extended absence having raised a family, they also get dinged because even with substantial experience they are likely to be treated at almost entry level."

You can call yourself a Democrat and still not follow all of your parties ideologies, that's what makes you unique.  As for her criticizing those for not interpreting feminism her way she's not the only feminist that does this, there are the feminists who believe a woman modeling nude is empowering while others think it's demeaning.  Anyways, this doesn't really debunk what she's said, just because someone leans right doesn't mean they're wrong.

He says that this type of ""free speech"" just intimidates and bullys a group, while doing exactly that. Also, comparing guns/military to pedos and racists, while also saying that this just leads to more ""evil,"" ""war,""  ""brutal conquest,"" is idiotic at best. The US was created in war, and so we know that the people should be armed in case the gov't oversteps their bounds. If the Jews/minorities had the right to bear arms in Nazi Germany, the Holocaust may've been a bit different. Plus, all militias aren't evil, if you fight for something good, and aren't being a frickin' frick, then it's not ""EVIL, BROOTILL, CONQWUEST!!1"" Ni to mention the fact that nearly every civilization has been created, or aided by, war and military."

So most of the mods are people who think reddit drama is a huge deal, rather than people who actually care about the community in the sub.

I know we're nurturing a generation to think that we're all unique snowflakes in a blissful winter sky but at the end of the day it's not long before we're all just slush on the side of the road.  Having said that, the statement ""educated in basic formal education"" is not a particularly astute statement.  The only people who are typically educated in any kind of education are teachers, because educating people in education means teaching them to teach.  And in developed countries, most of which are democratic, the common person, aka commoner, aka average, tends to receive a basic formal education as a matter of law.  Reading, writing, arithmetic, and a bunch of other shit that most people have forgotten by the time they're 25.  But they get the important stuff.  So for the OP to then try to delineate people with a basic education from the average person...there is no delineation.  They're one in the same, and ""basic formal education"" doesn't teach logic or reason.  It can't, because most teachers couldn't teach those topics because they lack those skills themselves.  So by the OP's own criteria, he shouldn't be allowed to vote because his argument showed no signs of elevated intelligence.  And as far as your response goes, do you see now how much more robust your argument can be when you stick to the details that matter instead of focusing on how insulting something is to you?"

I suppose it depends on what level of education about education that one deems is necessary to participate in a democracy."

circlebroke,3cs5a5,Ducky14,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:47:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly. He's arguing to limit the number of eligible voters based on the fact that there exists a number of ""commoners"" who don't have a basic education. Not sure what country OP is referring to? All it takes is mass education, and then the his problem with ""uninformed"" voters is solved.   Also, the thing is, OP's ideas would create an underclass of ineligible voters who have no political rights, and thus there would be no political motivation to improve the well-being of these voters, except for altruism. An example? Saudi Arabia (except that Saudi Arabia isn't a democracy, but I hope that the analogy holds).  It's like OP spent 10 minutes thinking about this, and based all his ideas on those 10 minutes, and hasn't developed any further."
circlebroke,3cs5a5,monkey_gamer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:03:46 2015 UTC,"I can think of two examples of ineligible voters in an actual democracy/republic, and suffrage in both cases was based more off land than off education or intelligence. Those were the republics of Greece and Rome, as well as the early United States. The idea was that if you don't have property and pay taxes, you don't have a stake in the government. If you don't have a stake, you don't get to vote. Things obviously changed, and suffrage has expanded drastically.  What OP seems to want is a Jim Crow type of political society, or just straight up slavery/serfdom. An underclass has practically no rights, no education, and exists simply for labor. They have no stake in anything because the fruits of their labor just gets taken from them. And, if we go based off of the stake in government=votes, then they get no votes. It holds up, but I personally find it immoral."

People with a PhD in Foo think they maybe sort of have a general understanding of Foo in general and a solid grasp of some aspect of Foo, and that kids who've just finished an undergrad Foo degree are cute as little puppies when they try to talk authoritatively.  So, if you're basing political power on understanding and knowledge, who gets that power? The PhD's in Foo would tell you that no-one with qualifications less than their own should have any say in deciding on Foo-related matters, although they might be arrogant enough to think they should have some say on Quix-related matters (which, of course, the Quix PhDs find just hilariously wrong-headed).

Something that someone who had gotten a C in statistics 101 could explain- representative sampling.  When a reality TV show picks women, they don't want the average person, they want someone who is young, attractive, and, if it's a show like Survivor or Big Brother, combative, dramatic and prone to cat fights.  If you're a normal person, the conclusion you can draw is that this group of people picked by TV executives performed better than that group of people picked by TV executives.   But if you're a neckbeard looking for validation for your misogynistic worldview, this proves men are smarter than women."

circlebroke,3cq31v,thebondoftrust,20,Fri Jul 10 08:28:25 2015 UTC,"Sometimes they do. They just shower them with liquor and hold them hostage in a house with way too many other drunk people in it, and mix them liberally with the worst people on the planet until everyone's fucking crazy. Then, if they aren't crazy enough for ratings, they just edit the crap out of footage to create the narrative they want. They're also really good at engineering drama. Like if someone detects that Contestant A doesn't like Contestant B and finds them a bit grating, they make sure that they're stuck together for everything all the time, and put in situations in which A is forced to do the exact thing that bothers B so much until B loses their shit.  I have no idea why anyone would want to be on reality television if they knew how deliberately manipulative the producers are. They're a bunch of sadistic fucks. I mean, half the reason that Survivor got way less hardcore over the years was because people were literally nearly starving to death or losing their goddamn minds. They push people that hard on purpose, to get ratings. The people who don't realize that that's how reality television works, and that it's really impossible to ""get famous"" anymore from reality television, are likely to be young, attention-seeking, and naive anyway, so they're tailor-made to be manipulated to act like terrible people on camera.  Which is awesome for the entire industry, let me tell you, because the only people who actually get paid for such garbage is the producers. The crew is cut down to the minimum, there's very little writing, and the ""cast"" sure as fuck isn't being paid to be there. Meanwhile, writers are out of jobs, actors are out of jobs, and we tune in every night at 8-o-clock to watch a bunch of young drunk dumbasses be traumatized on television for our entertainment.  It's really sick the more you think about it."

But even if they were, why do these people think that this woman owes it to them, the dead man or anyone else to flagellate herself over ""false accusations""?

When he makes a statement to counter what she has to say he simply says, ""She came to me and said she thought she was being discriminated against because of racism. I'm not racist and I won't tolerate anyone telling me that I am."" (Interestingly, he and the woman are agreed on this particular part: she corroborates that when she went to him complaining of racism he told her to get out of his sight because he refused to even entertain a conversation about racism.) That is literally ALL he says in his own defense. Then after his death friends and family followed that with more assertions that no, he definitely wasn't a racist and he in fact fought racism all his life, so nobody should have ever accused him of racism. At no time does anyone counter with a prosaic version of events that contradict what this woman says. From this I can kind of reasonably conclude that there was truth to her account."

It just seems like a very abrupt leap from ""she complained that she was being pushed to the back of the line and experiencing delays because of race"" to ""he committed suicide because of this clearly unfair accusation of racism"", and all they have in the way of arguing that it was ""unfair"" is the fact that a lot of his surviving friends and family say that he was like the opposite of a racist and ""championed equality all his life"" but they don't cite any examples of what he had actually done to combat racism. The article seems to just expect us to accept that he wasn't racist, and to further accept that his suicide was this woman's fault because her accusation - which wasn't even a real accusation, just complaining about the office in general - was so terribly, tragically, somehow objectively wrong. It can't even argue its central premise with any concrete facts."

In fact he didn't dispute this. Think about what would happen if that office were representing any other government. His flat refusal to address her complaints at all because he personally felt like he was being accused of racism shouldn't fly when he's representing a government social service. In any western country he would have been fired for the way HE ADMITTED he talked to her.   Way to come in here making a blatantly emotional argument and telling us that we should be ashamed of ourselves for having a legitimate beef with the blatant agenda of both the article itself and KiA, though.

Yeah, they are very similar, which is why I added that my point was trivia. Most people use Venn diagrams to refer to both. But the point is that for it to be a Venn diagram in the technical sense, say, you have to have an enclosed area corresponding to each subset of the constituent circles (or, more generally, closed curves) that is the intersection of the circles in that subset & no others. That's absent from the linked diagram. Normally, people indicate some extra information (about the size or the elements) about these (sub)sets in some way, either by listing the actual elements, or the number of them, or by making the size of the relevant area proportional to the size of that relevant set. But if an intersection is empty, you still have to ensure that there is an enclosed area as described above corresponding to that intersection. At least, for it to satisfy the definition of a Venn diagram.  But, yeah, in the end, it's all really just pointless adherence to an arbitrary definition."

When you use it on stage, I can see it’s funny, and I don’t care. But are you interested in what it might mean to gay men? (…) Well, the word “faggot” really means a bundle of sticks used for kindling in a fire. Now, in the middle ages, when they used to burn people they thought were witches, they used to burn homosexuals, too. And, they used to burn the witches at a stake, but they thought the homosexuals were too low and disgusting to be given a stake to be burnt on, so they used to just throw them in with the kindling, with the other faggots. So that’s how you get “flaming faggot.” (…) You might wanna know that every gay man in America has probably had that word shouted at them while they’re being beaten up, sometimes many times, sometimes by a lot of people all at once. So, when you say it, it kind of brings all of that back up. But, you know, by all means, use it. Get your laughs. But, you know, now you know what it means."

The first step in her plan is to assassinate Bernie Sanders, because she knows he's the people's choice.  Her first goal after achieving office is to repeal both the first and second amendments. After that, she will set her sights on net neutrality, and ban the confederate flag under punishment of capital treason. She also intends to increase police powers to shoot suspects on sight.  The next item on her agenda is video game journalism. She intends to outlaw ethics, as well as ban any video games that feature straight, white or male characters.  By the end of her term, she hopes to institute Sharia Law, issue arrest warrants for Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris and Bill Maher, and populate the Senate entirely with fat people. On top of that, nobody will be permitted to enter government unless they have transitioned to the gender opposite to the one they were assigned at birth.

People who think that someone can be accidentally racist are obnoxious and retarded. Racism is something that is done with intent. Someone can say something that is insulting to a specific race, but without intent it's just simple ignorance.  Most of the time the people I see trying to avoid the role of intent in racism have a victim complex and/or are trying to incite shit. You will always get tumblr SJWs who think that literally everything a man says is mysoginist and everything he does is rape. The perpetually offended, perpetually outraged.  However, with that said, this guy's circular logic is fucking astounding. People hating black people is racism. So even if they weren't racist in the first place, their reaction to a handful of bad experiences being to hate the entire race ended up making them racist... did nobody teach these idiots that two wrongs don't make a right?

Don't you find it unfair to assume the first group are naïve, unfortunately uneducated and harmless, while the latter malicious and hateful?    Jumping to conclusions about a persons intent is a dick move, and accidentally saying something racially offensive without intent is just naïve. Those are quite well defined scenarios.  I will happily concede that black people are justifiably paranoid, and it doesn't surprise me at all to see them react with suspicion. However in my experience when someone says something that is racially offensive and would be racist if it were said with intent, the reasonable reaction is to first establish the intent of the individual (""did you mean to say that out of hate?"") and then explain why it's offensive.  This is a scenario where if you have no other reason to suspect someone of being hateful apart from a single off comment, then it's reasonable to assume that they might not have meant it how it came across.   That person doesn't magically hate an entire race because they didn't know what something meant - that would clearly be an unreasonable conclusion.  And yes, a lot of people are most comfortable when they're outraged/offended. They can climb on their high horse and get a buzz out of being in a situation where they're right and the other person is wrong. They become as oversensitive and paranoid as possible in order to sustain this state because it feels normal to them.   And then you're capping it off with that stupid old shitty racist joke and you're playing it as ""these racists probably like this racist joke, let me retell it if you don't know it... sad right"" smh :/   I'm not sure what your point even is here. I'm not sure how I'd be ""playing it"", are you saying that I have some hidden agenda/ulterior motive?"

They claim that there's a method to their madness and that they are trying to use shame as a legitimate tactic for curbing the obesity epidemic, because the obesity epidemic is a real public health issue. But then they turn around and give the lie to that agenda by shaming people whose health and mobility have been negatively impacted by their obesity. When they decide they want to bitch about the supposed lazy entitlement of the obese, then all of a sudden they want to minimize the idea of obesity as a public health threat. It's just part of what made that subreddit so toxic and menacing to the rest of the community. They were trolls with a pretend mission that they thought gave them moral authority to harass people based on how they looked.  The ironic thing is that, at least in my area, many of the obese people who need the tags and scooters have limited mobility due to diabetes, but there aren't as many of them as there are people whose diabetic complications arose as a result of excess drinking. fph wouldn't judge them, though - as long as they weren't fat!"

It's complicated and is probably going to mean something different to different people depending on philosophy. It could be seen as a synonym for best friend, but some aro people feel the need for a term that implies more signifigance. Society places a lot of importance on romantic love and that leaves a lot of people who don't feel romantic attraction feeling broken. Words like this can help make someone feel that they can have a significant relationship just as important as any other without it needing to be ""romantic"".  Again, it's complicated. Romance means different things to different people, so I can understand if it seems like a joke at first. I hope this makes sense."

Sterilization can be effective but is inhumane, and for good reason IMHO.  Somewhat controversially, there are some psych meds that are known to kill the sex drive as a side effect which have been suggested.  These are all mitigating or reactive measures.

Then, when she talked about reining in abuse on this site, Cheeto-stained hands across Reddit were vigorously wrung at the looming spectre of the dreaded censorship. Because if Reddit can't bully people, freedom dies. The FPH ban cemented Pao's status as the evil queen of SJWs so no matter what she does or doesn't do Reddit will take personal offense to it.  What Ellen Pao has actually brought to Reddit is medicine. It may make them gag as they swallow it down but it's for their own good.

We can play hypotheticals all day can't we? In a more extreme slightly hyperbolic example think of the evolution ""debate"". The creationists say they're right. Everyone else says Evolution is the right module. We don't honor this idea of ""Well just because the evidence is on one side of this, doesn't mean they can't be right!""

I think some people jump too easily to their perceived narrative, and that's on both sides. We're all guilty of it in one way or another.

If the Court deemed her complaints to be completely without merit, then there would generally be a summary judgment and no trial. As it is, the Court decides that there is a preponderance of evidence to one side - I.e. That there is a greater than 50% chance of that side being right.   There is also the point that she could easily have lost without lying. Everything she says could be true, but the jury (I think? I'm English so unsure but juries seem to be used far too much in the US) decided that the facts didn't match the textual law, that the events weren't as bad as she believed them to be, or that her employer had other reasons for behaving in that way. Or the Jury could simply not have believed some of the evidence, which says nothing necessarily about whether it is true until one reads the actual evidence presented in the case alongside the jury verdict.

These are not based on genetic makeups of the sexes, rather what's been constructed to assist a narrative that benefits the status quo. As as example women were thought to be afflicted by hysteria due to a wandering womb. Therefore this distress was a female condition related to her sex that men, not having wandering wombs couldn't have. We laugh at these notions today, but at the time this was asserted it benefited men by excluding women from public participation. Everything from having a job, never mind in power or leadership positions, to even leaving her house or having access to her own children. Just slap hysterical on her and tuck her away. Again, the mere notion of doing this to men was literally unthinkable. But these were social norms of the day created by those in power and influence that just happened not to be women. It was their sex you see, simple genetics.   Today we're all aware that ascribing what ware essentially personality traits that are influenced by socialization based on norms. They are not unique to one sex or the other. Also many archaic notions of these gender roles like men cannot be tender or desire/show affection, or that women are emotionally ""weak"" are harmful to both men and women.   This is feminist theory 101 and it doesn't attack anyone for being subhuman, in fact exactly the opposite. It seeks to illuminate fallacies of the past and bring society forward by addressing and destructing these harmful ideas. Additionally theories are not personal attacks, they're political and social critiques in the name of progress.  Hope that helps."

Yesterday when she made a blog post that she is sorry, the second most upvoted comment was saying ""I don't really care what you have to say."". This is saying all that you need to know.

Which is ironic, because I think the website tools have pretty dramatically improved, and the level of valuable content (In the smaller subs) has increased. There are several awesome small/mid-sized communities that are just fantastic that I would thoroughly miss if Reddit went away. And even AskReddit, for all of it's circlejerking, is better than it used to be because a few of the mods are trying a bit harder, and automoderator is doing it's job.   And Reddit used to go down or be overloaded almost daily back then, but I think it's been over a year since I've noticed any sort of significant downtime or site glitches.

People know that it's a big problem, but they'll never admit it.  I, for one, was super happy when FPH was banned.

It's a legitimate argument that none of them have any stake in.  If they were joining in to legitimately draw attention to these issues then Reddit's mea culpa yesterday would have been treated with a lot less vitriol and childish tantrums.

The trial went through to the end, and the jury ruled that there wasn't enough evidence to award damages.    To add to this, the specific charges that Pao made was that she wasn't promoted because of gender discrimination, and that she was fired because of her discrimination lawsuit. That is what needed to be proved, beyond reasonable doubt. There wasn't really any question about whether the workplace itself was sexist (there was plenty of evidence to show that it was), but there wasn't enough evidence to specifically show that she was passed over for promotion because of her gender, as opposed to other, legitimate reasons. Basically, this kind of gender discrimination is really, really hard to prove, as unless someone is stupid enough to send an email saying, ""we didn't promote you because you're a woman"", you rely on evidence that ultimately can he interpreted in several ways. For example, Pao said that other male junior partners were promoted ahead of her, despite similar performance, whilst the counter claim was that very few junior partners get promoted, and that her performance reviews weren't as strong as those who were promoted. I'm pretty sure that one of the jurors said in an interview afterwards that he personally felt that she was overlooked due to gender discrimination, but voted against that as based purely on the evidence, he thought that it was not sufficient to prove her case beyond reasonable doubt.  So yeah, the case wasn't baseless, nor was it a simple decision, and involved an awful lot of deliberation. All you can really say is that the case showed that she didn't have enough evidence to support her claim - it wasn't that her case was invalid, simply that it wasn't quite strong enough to pass beyond reasonable doubt.

The burden of proof lies with the accuser. That means that if you get charged with something like stealing a painting, the prosecutor has to prove that you stole it. If they can't prove it, or the jury is unsure, then you don't go to jail.   If the burden of proof was on you, then you'd have to prove you didn't steal it,  and if the jury wasn't sure, they'd put you in jail (luckily, that's not how the legal system works).  Now let's say the jury is unsure, and delivers their verdict. They'll give you a ""Not Guilty"" verdict, which means the prosecutor didn't prove it. They're not saying you're definitely innocent, just that the burden of proof wasn't met.   Now for the Kleiner Perkins lawsuit. Ellen Pao was the accuser, so she had the burden of proof. She did not meet it, and KP basically got a ""Not Guilty"" verdict, with no damages awarded.   That's completely different than a case being thrown out.    Virtually synonymous with baseless    I cannot possibly begin to explain how wrong this is. The case was not frivolous litigation, and the case was not thrown out. It received a verdict.

But CEOs of any company are almost certainly not engaged that closely with their consumers, and there are millions of reddit users anyway so even if she was the evil, cackling feminist witch behind the keyboard, her personal actions wouldn't amount to much.  The fact is that the people and subreddits that have been banned have been banned by other staff and for breaking site rules, not because of some crazy agenda.  Furthermore, everyone seems to believe that they have a natural right to all the information about everything that happens in reddit's corporate offices, so even if the admins come out and say ""we banned x for y"" everyone will A) not believe it and/or B) demand ""proof"" that x did y.

Even if Reddit were to offer unusally high salaries banning negotiations still hurts any employee who comes on.

Then he quit over office space negotiations, of which I know little of to be honest.   When Pao stepped in, the narrative changed heavily.

It's the same type of hatred that you get when someone cuts you in line at the supermarket. That type of anger that induces a little whence in the back of your neck and a shiver of anger echoing through the vestiges of your body.  That anger stems from my feeling that Reddit is the personification of all the ills of society. It represents the vitriolic values corroding the foundations of the things I love, the people looking for a handout, the one who's always looking to blame others instead of their own ineptitude, the person quick to resort to attacks and calling me a nazi or a cunt instead of having a personal conversation. The site has abused the goodwill of our society for its own personal gain.  In short, Redditors are the type to cut their piece of the pie from the middle and still get mad when you eat the crust. And it's these very things about Reddit that represents the moral decay I despise.  I honestly can say this with a straight face. I despise you all. I don't wish you any physical harm because I'm not that type of person, but I just wish you all would disappear from this website and by proxy my life in general.  This site needs to die.

They also ignore the fact that a still significant number of criminals are white and that those also tend to be poor and less educated.

They tend to cite a mixture of proper academic sources and random blogs, they pick out individual results and ideas from the middle of papers while ignoring the authors' own broader interpretations and conclusions, they often fail to fully understand the meanings and limitations of the statistics they cite (for example, official crime statistics are treated as gospel - there is no awareness that crime is inherently difficult to measure and that the statistics generally come with a lot of caveats and criticism), their own attempts at statistical analysis are often faulty (a common issue is comparing or combining numbers from different studies without checking whether the methodologies were similar enough for that to make sense), and there is often far too much weight given to one or two individual scientists or studies that are not necessarily very representative of their field (for example, a huge proportion of posts attacking trans people cite Paul McHugh, a conservative Catholic activist and sometime psychologist).  But the biggest problem with these things is the way all the disparate ""facts and statistics"" are tied together to make a point.  Often the ""facts"" are suggestive of the point the poster is trying to make, but they aren't really the kind of information you would need to prove the point.  Or sometimes the poster doesn't explicitly make any broader point - they just disingenuously leave readers to draw their own conclusions.  When you are confronted with a big wall of text full of numbers and links, it can be difficult to realise that there is a huge disconnect between the reasoning and the conclusions, or even that there aren't any conclusions.   For example, does anyone know of any analysis of Arthur Jensen's work?   It's been discussed to death.  You could start here I suppose."

Really, if North Korea released honest IQ stats (or any at all...), they'd probably be noticeably lower than their brethren in South Korea, even though Asian IQ stats on those tests tend towards being higher than others on those statistical analyses, (such as those inferior white people), but that's just a one nation and 50-70 year statistical anomaly right?

In ""The Geography of Thought"" (Free Press, 2003), Richard Nisbett, PhD, co-director of the Culture and Cognition Program at the University of Michigan, argues that East Asian and Western cultures have developed cognitive styles that differ in fundamental ways, including in how intelligence is understood.  People in Western cultures, he suggests, tend to view intelligence as a means for individuals to devise categories and to engage in rational debate, while people in Eastern cultures see it as a way for members of a community to recognize contradiction and complexity and to play their social roles successfully.

Unfortunately, when that got him into trouble, he hid behind his cronies and did much to distance himself from the fanatical movement his actions and ideas spurred.  But, in doing so he catalyzed Europe into breaking free from the economic disparity and religious fascism that had been strangling its economy since the fall of the roman empire, aka the 'dark ages.'

Just a couple days ago, there was a dude who was talking about the Kleiner Perkins case, and said that Ellen Pao asked for billions (with a b) in the case, and called on women to support her but actually wouldn't have given any money back to other women.  In reality, she sought damages due to lost wages, in the millions, only called on one woman to testify during the trial, and the money from a discrimination lawsuit would be hers to keep, as it would be the amount of lost wages due to discrimination."

It's why they can automatically write off SRS and Ellen Pao as evil."
circlebroke,3cc3hr,BritishHobo,8,Tue Jul 7 01:08:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely - it's like the whole ""Pao is a terrible CEO"" thing, which is constantly parroted on this website and is always up voted. It's been repeated so much it's become a received wisdom; you don't need to substantiate the claim anymore. If you press people to do so, they will usually use examples like the banning of FPH as a sign that she is trying to censor the site, or the banning of Victoria. This all ignores the fact that FPH was banned for harassment, in particular the implied encouragement to harass Imgur's staff by putting their pictures up in the sidebar (at this point FPH apologists will usually claim, ""but no one ever actually said to harass them!"", ignoring the obvious subtext of the act), and also begs the question how would it have been a better business decision to leave a large number of users to harass one of Reddit's key business allies? They also gloss over the fact that it wasn't Pao who fired Victoria, something which is easily verifiable with like 2 minutes of searching, but she's still the one getting 95% of the flak for it. She's also apparently a terrible CEO because she once made a mistake using Reddit by trying to link to a PM (ignoring the fact that admins are able to do this within their private subreddits, so it was just an honest mistake). You don't get to be CEO of Reddit by being an expert at using Reddit. That's why the karmawhoring power users aren't sitting in Reddit's corporate offices right now.  There's also this weird belief that Pao spends her days as CEO scrolling through the defaults, looking for comments to delete and users to shadowban, laughing maniacally each time she defrosts a freeze peach. Seriously, this is something people think the CEO of a company does.  So yeah, there's this weird mythology surrounding her, all of which is based on repetition, received wisdom, and the ignorance of a large part of the user base as to what exactly a CEO is. It's why you don't need to offer any actual evidence when ranting against her, and why attempts to defend her and rebut the claims (especially on the defaults) are largely met with downvotes. The hive has spoken: Ellen Pao bad!"

In short, she's the type to cut her piece of the pie from the middle and still get mad when you eat the crust. And it's these very things about her that represents the moral decay I despise. I honestly can say this with a straight face. I despise her. I don't wish her any physical harm because I'm not that type of person, but I just wish she would disappear from this website and by proxy my life in general.

circlebroke,3cbehe,Moirawr,48,Mon Jul 6 20:07:42 2015 UTC,"The sex scene in the comic is actually one of, if not the single most important part of character development for Nite Owl and to a lesser extent Silk Spectre.  It's also the one part of the movie I hated the most, because it undercut all of the importance from the scene.   It's important because it's the second sex scene they have within Issue 7.  They try messing around on his couch and it's a total train wreck, which is punctuated by the fact that the camera is on the TV and the television dialog is a commentary on their attempt at sex.  During most of it, Ozymandias is on screen doing some sort of gymnastic routine and we get dialogue such as the announcers saying ""and just look at that confidence as he leaps up and grabs the bar, beginning his maneuver"" while Dan is fumbling around.  The scene ends with them awkwardly calling it quits and just going to bed.   That's when Dan has this dream  Which leads to the realization that Dan = Impotent and Powerless and Nite Owl = Strong and Powerful.    After they save the people from the burning building and are up in the sky, Nite Owl is confidant and smooth and sexy.  And they bang and it's the culmination of the sexual tension but also the realization that they can't quit being a mask.  It's not just who they are, but also who they want to be.    But in the movie there is none of that context.  It's just ""and then they bang, here look at some tits"""

Also, the fact that things like Playgirl did absolutely nothing for women is proof that women have zero interest in sex or porn. Women just don't know the right way to get turned on by looking at boring looking plain dudes standing posing on beaches with their soft cocks out. Women should find that kind of thing incredibly erotically satisfying, and the fact that we think it's corny and embarrassing is proof we're just not sexual creatures."

""Boring"" comes when the model is made to look like some unreal paragon of humanity while everything is evenly lit and all flaws are airbrushed away; ""interesting"" is more of a good-looking guy off the street presented well but not idealized, if that makes sense.

[disclaimer: I don't see a ton of movies and am talking completely out of my ass right now]  I think the reason for that 96% is two things. First, the marketing campaign is nothing but 'hey look male strippers,' so I have no idea what the movie is actually about. But, on the other hand, everyone I know who has seen it thinks it's absolutely amazing. FilmCritHulk says that it's a spectacular movie and the 96% is disappointing because he thinks it's really important for men to see this movie.  Second: The average reddit dork and/or apparently the average american man sees male strippers and says 'ew dats gey, im not seein no gay movie.'   So the only men left are the evidently 4% of non-dudebro men who aren't total shitheads and dismiss anything they think is is gay. And women who don't have that kind of crazy insecurity.  The 96% isn't because women are easily titillated, it's because (evidently a massive number of) men are so insecure that seeing other shirtless men on their screen makes them panic and swear off the movie regardless of what else is in it"

Thats also the conversation where kn0thing told us to fuck off essentially   Popcorn tasted good  /u/Kn0thing , reddit Administrator.     Oh shit, this is just a PR extravanagza.

Case in point the amount of misogyny Ellen Pao gets from the Redditor userbase is unwarranted.   Not to mention the many racist or ignorant ideas expressed regularly and you get the picture of why reddit isn't that liberal at all.

From my perspective, you are expressing an overly optimistic view of this site's members.  There is an unpleasant contingent who downvote everything she does, post irrelevant ""pao facts"" copypasta on every comment etc.  When she does participate, any slip up is jumped on and used as ammunition.  For example, she made a mistake in posting to the wrong subreddit, then deleted her post, as explained here.  Since that error, I've read maybe a dozen times how ""she doesn't even know how reddit works!!""    As another example, consider the infamous popcorn comment from /u/kn0thing.  He was certainly tone deaf there, but he's trying to participate as just a regular reddituer and really has been taken to task for it.  My point is, it's a risky proposition.

Maybe the reason people are mocking your, let's call it enthusiasm, is the fact that you're being rather needlessly condescending to a woman who has been here longer than you.   Also, if you look at her comment history, she has consistently engaged with the community up until Reddit decided to attack her for everything that she says or does regardless of its controversy and downvotes all of her posts. It's Reddit that isn't really giving Ellen a chance."

Calling him ""Bernie"" is just grating.  I don't know why it bugs me so much, but I think calling him ""Bernie"" just diminishes his stature.  He doesn't seem ostentatious, especially for a Senator, but people should at least address him as Senator.  Same thing with Secretary Clinton...calling her ""Hillary"" seems so dismissive of what she's done.  Also his vote to cut NASA spending and how his fanbase here completely glossed over that vote is irritating.  Some people on here have watched too much West Wing and think they are wise political operatives.  I saw a thread where someone was griping about Senator Warren not formally endorsing him, and the comment was ""don't freak out, why would she want to waste the momentum of her endorsement so soon before Iowa and New Hampshire, she will do it closer to then"".

I am supportive of NASA not only because of the excitement of space exploration, but because of all the additional side benefits we receive from research in that area. Sometimes, and frankly I don't remember all of those votes, one is put in a position of having to make very very difficult choices about whether you vote to provide food for hungry kids or health care for people who have none and other programs.

Cares about climate change, stopping outsourcing jobs. This is a big one too:   We should start by embracing citizen-funded elections, to reduce the outsized influence of special interests and the very wealthy in our politics. Small donors should have their contributions matched by six-to-one or more, and be rewarded through a refundable tax credit that encourages more people to give and participate. And we should make it easier, not harder, to vote – by modernizing registration, restoring the Voting Rights Act, and tearing down barriers like ID requirements that make it difficult for people to exercise their most fundamental right.   Voter ID laws are archaic and backwards. Against lobbying and special interest groups.  Also this:   The first responsibility of the Commander in Chief is to keep America safe. And today, we face a daunting array of threats – from climate change, to cyber attacks, to violent extremism. Above all, we must understand that our strength in the world depends on our economic strength at home. Maintaining our security in the long run will require expanding the American Dream and making sure the economy works for all Americans. No fighter jet or troop battalion will keep us as safe as a vibrant economy, a strong democracy, and a growing middle class. Eliminating the scourge of extreme poverty is a moral, economic and national security imperative. Supporting international development is a reflection of our most deeply held values, and will help us build the next generation of American political and economic partnerships. Protecting the dignity of human lives in fragile states will help reduce the threat of being drawn into costly future conflicts.   Also has a stand against going to wars, a big plus for me. I detest the United States involving itself in international conflicts incessantly.   But as I said, I also like Biden if he runs, and Hillary. I hope O'Malley makes it to the primaries at least.

circlebroke,3cc1y1,MolemanusRex,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:50:45 2015 UTC,"Yes I'm aware of this, but the reason I have brought it before Circlebroke because it fits into the Reddit STEM and Atheist circle jerks and because no one on Reddit has complained this loudly about any other issue.

Of course it is likely this translates into creationism, but that's not really the reason I posted the thread.   I also (and more importantly) posted this because of the fact that this is reddit' favourite circlejerk, and I've noticed these complaints only came out in force for Le Stem, as opposed to, for example, when Britain got a culture secretary who knew nothing about culture. Curiously Reddit didn't seem to care about that..."

So basically she's guilty of destroying the freeze peaches of bullies (which reddit loves to hate on unless they're the ones doing the bullying), letting someone who works under her do their job and fire someone (who later apologized for not having a backup plan and is working on it), AND she has the audacity to treat reddit like an actual company and not reveal private information regarding the firing to a bunch of raging losers on the internet."
circlebroke,3c9yv1,dougie_g,22,Mon Jul 6 13:41:08 2015 UTC,"So basically she's guilty of destroying the freeze peaches of bullies (which reddit loves to hate on unless they're the ones doing the bullying).   I imagine that this really does describe the the most vocal idiots on reddit. The vast majority don't give a fuck about Ellen Pao, FPH or anything. They just visit reddit and read some stuff now and again. The users who shout loudly about this stuff are mostly going to be the stereotype fedora neckbeards (not literally, but  it's the neckbeard of the heart that counts) who mostly got bullied at school for playing video games and liking anime. Which really sucks. But they now seem to have turned it round and realised that their little group can hate women, fat people and gay people all day.  I think this kind of person has been able to form a community that has folded in on itself to become a sort of toxic black hole, dragging anyone into it who feels somewhat disenfranchised and exponentially increasing their outpouring of hatred. For most of us, the Internet, and reddit in particular, can be a place where we talk to people about our interests, find interesting content, broaden our minds a bit, and/or just see funny stuff, cat pics and dank memes.   But for these guys (and I'd bet that 95% are men), reddit has been a place where their community of disenfranchised losers has flourished and grown. I understand the mentality because I wasn't cool at school and could have got quite bitter, but was lucky to change that around at university. But now they feel under threat from a powerful woman. Many will have serious issues with women, again having failed socially at school, probably having bad relationships with their mothers, and likely never having had much romantic success either. They created a 'safe space' no different in some ways from, for example, a rape victims community, where they could fester in peace without being challenged by the idea that perhaps they weren't happy because of their failure to adapt after being deeply unpopular in school.   Then again, I stumbled across the Facebook page of the guy who originally began the petition to reinstate FPH, and he seemed like a standard white libertarian guy, with pics of guns everywhere. He wasn't bad looking and was pretty in shape, and seemed to have female friends and a car. So perhaps the more terrifying reality is that these people actually are not basement dwelling sad neckbeards, living 'Red Pill' fantasies in their copious spare time, but are indistinguishable from any normal white straight middle class guy. That's a bit scary because when we see the type of stuff these people post of KiA, FPH, or TRP, we realise what horrible things apparently normal people are capable of believing.   TL;DR: Most of these crazies are probably bullied neckbeards who became bullies, but maybe a lot of them are actually outwardly normal people who secretly hate everything that isn't them."
circlebroke,3c9yv1,snotbowst,4,Mon Jul 6 14:28:53 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree, but I break down the people who like that shit into three categories.  1) People who have legitimate social or mental issues, and they just haven't gotten it worked out.  2) People who are just extremely maladjusted.  People who were bullied and never got over it.  People who had awful social lives in high school and never had a proper college experience (i.e. actually attending an actual university full time, not just a part time local college) or work experience to redeem it, so they are stuck spinning their wheels in the same shitty existence now at 20 something as they were at 15.  3) People who have gotten way too lucky in life and are too dumb to realize it.  Everyone knows the type; the model looking folks who don't get how someone has a hard time getting a relationship going, the person whose parents always have money to give asking how other people don't understand a budget, the person who only ever needed one interview to get a job wondering how people can't find employment.  I honestly never bought that Internet bullies are the type of people who just want to exercise power and be mean.  They usually have no way of knowing who they bullying so they don't get that out of the system."
circlebroke,3c9yv1,dougie_g,3,Mon Jul 6 20:15:03 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, that's a great analysis."
circlebroke,3c9yv1,starvinmartin,3,Mon Jul 6 22:14:00 2015 UTC,"That's a good point! I'd argue that people like that are really the type of people that are arrogant and abrasive IRL, even if they don't look the part. If they can't see how reactionary and bizarre they're acting, then I don't know what to say!  I think you summed it up best when you say ""It's the neckbeard of the heart that counts"" :P  E: Add to that, just the general anonymity of the internet makes conversations really bizarre. I don't think many well adjusted people would ever say hurtful things in real life to people, but here it's okay because no one knows who they are or where they come from, and it's such an easy mentality to fall into. I was kind of rude to someone here a bit back, then stopped in my tracks when I realized how rude I was and vowed to never be a butt to anyone! I don't think the normal mentality of ""treat others well"" really extends online too well, or we'd all have less problems to deal with (and make fun of!)"
circlebroke,3c9yv1,AMAathon,2,Mon Jul 6 15:01:16 2015 UTC,Right? There's no way Ellen Pao had any direct involvement in the firing of Victoria. The CEO of a major media conglomerate in San Francisco is not tasked with firing a low-level admin across the country. That's like blaming the CEO of McDonald's because a franchise manager fired a cashier. I'd be willing to go so far to say Ellen Pao had no clue Victoria even existed before last week. There's a reason you hire teams and delegate work.

Pao lost her gender discrimination case against venture capital firm, Kleiner Perkins, on March 27, 2015. A vast majority of the Reddit community believes that Pao, ""a manipulative individual who will sue her way to the top"", has overstepped her boundaries and fears that she will run Reddit into the ground.   This is just rambling nonsense.   Also, since 150,000 people signing something means it has to happen, I'm sure all these people are on board with taking ""the case of Michael Brown, popularly dubbed the 'Ferguson Case', to the Missouri Supreme Court, with Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson as the accused."" since that has 159,175 signatures.

Reddit fucked up by not having a replacement ready. Shit, even a small newspaper in  bumfuck nowhere has more foresight to transition employees into new roles like Press Relations.

I support whistleblowing as a check on power and Snowden's actions have been increasingly vindicated.  I guess you're saying that the reddit-reactionary-right's vilification of Pao, a person in ""power"", is the same kind of treatment the NSA receives, but I just don't see it.

Of course your average Redditor does not desire a more-than-superficial understanding of anything so I doubt the true purpose of the dad-rock jerk in its most common form has anything to do with this."

Is a straight guy going to write a song about how old creepy men hit on them in the club, or how breaking up feels like being an angel that can no longer fly around in a glittery candy soda world? Would a white guy ever write an afrofuturistic song that uses the auctioning of androids as a metaphor for the slavery and the particular way we objectify blacks and women, or sing about the expedited way we cycle through female celebrities, rising to stardom and then disappearing as quickly as they came, and the desire to emulate that?

circlebroke,3c8hgt,deleigh,3,Mon Jul 6 06:42:55 2015 UTC,"Women, minorities and foreign people have different perspectives to white men and (the minorities and foreigners at least) come from different cultures so in searching for music made by them you are likely to find different ideas and sounds. On top of that, women, minorities and foreign people literally sound different when singing, is that reason enough for you Mr. Logical?  The reason people look for music made by different kinds of people is because that's one way of finding different sounds.  examples:  Boris are a metal band from Japan, they sound different because a lot of their music has clear east Asian influences, no doubt strongly connected to the fact they are Japanese.  Kendrick Lamar's albums are intelligent and nuanced commentaries on life as a young black man in america. I highly doubt you would find any music that talks about that in such an informed and accurate way made by a white man.  Björk's music is very unique and her voice is a big part of that, namely its accent and high range, both of which come from being an Icelandic woman.  As a slightly more obscure example there's this new electronic producer I've heard called Mikael Seifu, he's from Ethiopia and may still be living there. His music put's a very unique spin on garage and bass music with elements from traditional african percussion paired with synthesised notes to make an incredibly lush sound. It's ridiculous to tell me that him being Ethiopian had nothing to do with that.  The list goes on and on"

circlebroke,3c81yn,strategolegends,14,Sun Jul 5 21:07:10 2015 UTC,"I remember ice soap, but what was 2 A.M. chili?"
circlebroke,3c81yn,WallScreamer,27,Sun Jul 5 21:51:55 2015 UTC,"Here is the actual link/recipe, although I am too lazy to look for the actual reddit post. As with many reedit posts, it was highly up voted, and a lot of the comments complained about it. Many of the complaints were complaining about how the recipe called for a chill spice but the person threw out a packet rather than use it. They also apparently didn't care for the over-the-top swearing and the like from the comic. I don't know that I buy either of those arguments--food snobs on reddit always advocate making things from scratch (any food subreddit will demonstrate this in a few posts), and the standard reddit default audience eats up that over-the-top, swearing stuff. I also do have a bit of a soft spot for the recipe, since it gave me confidence to make my own chill."

circlebroke,3c7rbu,AnotherCunningPlan,25,Sun Jul 5 23:23:18 2015 UTC,"For the record: you said that people need to take it upon themselves to avoid situations that might trigger them. That's literally the point of them asking for a trigger warning - so they can avoid being triggered. Yes, that's something they should seek professional help for, but when you go to a therapist they don't just snap their fingers and you're magically cured. It's a long, fragile process. If you really worked in the mental health field you would know that."
circlebroke,3c7rbu,GorbiJones,21,Sun Jul 5 23:27:39 2015 UTC,"Also, a lot of people don't have access to professional help. Therapy is incredibly expensive, and there are other practical things that could be stopping people- or simple depression and anxiety. Like the only time I can have access to therapy would be free univerity therapy but I had anxiety about it and waited too long and there were no slots left when I didn't have class, so I'm shit outta luck until september and then who knows if I'll have the balls to start it or not.  A lot of people's triggers aren't obvious seeming things- they might be music or smells from the event. I'm really freaked out by explicit handjobs and male masturbation- I wouldn't expect anyone to predict that this would upset me. It's on me to avoid that. But graphic violence and such are way more common triggers, and so it's reasonable to include a brief ""shit's gross and whatnot"" warning before content like that if it wouldn't be expected."
circlebroke,3c7rbu,RiskyChris,-13,Sun Jul 5 23:30:53 2015 UTC,"Nothing in my comments alludes to the fact that the process is a fast or an easy one. I don't see how that is at all relevant, when my overall point is while it is shitty that people go through traumas like rape and violence, in the end we can not and frankly should not, expect the world to censor and label and adjust and change every thing that MIGHT affect someone.   I read through these comments in this thread and I just can't believe that you all are real people. I can not fathom a world where someone thinks that because of their own bad life experiences, as horrible as they may be, the world must change to adapt to THEM. It is completely unrealistic.   I never said we shouldn't have ratings or simple warnings like we already do. When you start up game of thrones it clearly says when there will be violence and nudity, etc. If you are triggered by things like rape scenes, then when you see that warning, do your research.   It is ridiculous that we should have to label everything that might occur in a scene so we don't trigger someone. It isn't about empathy or sympathy or being a shitty person or being heartless. It is about what is realistic and it is also about personal responsibility.   I think by telling rape victims that they should feel terrorized and panic when they see certain things, that is demeaning to them. It is saying to them they don't have the capacity for resilience, or the ability to get to the other side of the trauma. It is normalizing being a victim. THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR WOMEN.   It also does not solve that person's original problem. You can't put a trigger warning on everything. And you can't account for all situations that may cause triggers. Like many have stated where do we draw the line? And when that person has relied on trigger warnings in order to not have to face those emotions in the real world, what then? Do they decide not to interact with society because people don't use trigger warnings before they say things in public? I don't see how it helps people. Again, I am not against ratings that give people a starting point by saying ""This materials contains mature content"" and then a person that truly has panic attacks when they see that material can do their research with a friend, family member or therapist to then avoid that material.   The reality of the situation is, people's eyes roll out of their head when they see a statement like one of your comrades below said. I will paraphrase because I don't feel like it linking it, but basically she stated that her friend, who was in another state was raped. She heard a song called Date Rape at karaoke. She considers that to be a trigger.   Now, I am not trying to be a bitch and I am not trying to be edgy. But I really do not see how that is a legitimate argument for trigger warnings. I think most adults would agree that that person maybe needs to grow up a bit and perhaps she needs to join the rest of us in the real world.   I am very sorry if you all are disappointed that I am not your typical Red Piller white guy making these statements. I hate the TRP and everything it stands for. I roll my eyes just as fucking hard when I see their bullshit spouted all over this site. But you all seem to forget the middle ground on which most people out in the real world actually stand. A middle ground where people should feel safe but also should take some responsibility for their life and not expect the world to not offend or hurt them because of their own life experiences."

circlebroke,3c7rbu,Enigmius1,-12,Mon Jul 6 01:27:41 2015 UTC,"The linked comment makes a point, but trust it to reddit to try and distill it into a self-righteous black-and-white issue worthy of a bit of soapboxing and a lot of hypocrisy.   The linked comment was pointing out how the solution to trauma is not having society walk around it on eggshells.  The solution to trauma is supported recovery for the traumatized individuals so that they have tools at a cognitive level to deal with existing issues, and also to deal with encounters in day-to-day life that might prompt re-emergence of some or all of those issues.  It is simply not practical in any way to offer trigger warnings to cover every scenario.  ""Warning: Contains violence, extreme gore, blood, gunfire, explosions, rape, cruelty to animals, strong authority figures, sociopathic manipulation, overeating, fried food, meat, vomiting, men, women, children in bathing suits, alternate sexualities, bondage clothing, torn clothing, out-of-style clothing, doorhandles that weren't checked 21 times to see if they were locked before leaving, men with long hair, women with short hair, aggressive dog breeds, sharks, water, a pharmacy, narcotics, cigarettes, alcohol, sexually suggestive behavior, and nuts. May also contain other triggers.  Supporting traumatized people in blaming society for not catering to their trauma is not constructive.  It doesn't mean that because we don't bend over backwards to warn of every conceivable trigger that we lack empathy or concern for traumatized individuals.  It does mean we support them in reaching the conclusion that despite their trauma, life does go on.  And how in the blue hell the OP got from the comment they linked to ""people can't be triggered after a rape"" is a shameful example of selective attention.  The linked comment didn't say anything of the sort.  The world doesn't get better when we twist what people say in order to demonize them.  If you can't find fault with what they say based on the proper interpretation of the words they used, don't fucking bother."
circlebroke,3c7rbu,Sailor_mini_moon,12,Mon Jul 6 01:47:32 2015 UTC,"Whether it has to do with empathy or not, I think you’re misunderstanding why trigger warnings and such things can be helpful. You seem like a reasonable person, so I’ll take the time to try to explain. I’ll go into more detail below, of course, but here’s the gist of my point: forcing people to deal with things that trigger them before they’re ready, before they have cultivated the cognitive tools you mentioned as being important, is not helpful at all; in the beginning of treatment, avoidance is expected by therapists, and sometimes even encouraged (e.g. I was told in no uncertain words not to search for diseases/ailments on the internet and to limit my exposure to world news).  I’ll try using myself as an example to better illustrate my point. I have severe OCD, severe to the point that I’m government-certified-disabled. And because of your cute little doorknob joke above--not saying that shows a lack of empathy on your part, of course, just a slightly unoriginal sense of humor and a side of ignorance--I’m going to assume that you don’t actually know much about it, or how badly it can impact people’s lives. So I’ll give you a little summary of my own experience with it. Everyone’s experience with OCD is different, but it generally breaks down into two parts: the obsessive, intrusive thoughts, and the compulsions taken to alleviate the thoughts (your 21 doorknob checks, if you will). And for anyone reading, I detail some violence below (also, that took me about five seconds to type).  My obsessive, intrusive thoughts were extremely violent; they were, for the most part, the idea that I wanted to kill people, first myself, then people close to me, and eventually, as the thoughts increased in severity, basically anyone I saw. I’d be sitting in our apartment, see my boyfriend, and suddenly get a thought like ’hey, you want to strangle this guy, and then my brain would treat me to a graphic image of his strangulation by my hands. My compulsion--as is very common--was not physical. There was no checking or tapping. I just tried to explain the thoughts away. ’No, I don’t want to strangle him. I don’t want to hurt anyone. In fact, the idea of harming someone in any way is one that makes me sicker than any other. It is a core betrayal of who I am as a person.’ and so on and so forth. It got to the point where that was pretty much my day, having violent images of ripping people’s throats out, and then trying to explain to myself why I would never do that. Then it was bedtime, but I couldn’t go to sleep, because I was terrified of what would happen if I stopped actively policing my mind. Quirky, yeah?  Now that you understand the situation a little better, I can get to my first real point re: exposure and avoidance--my first trip to a psychiatrist.  The doctor was nice, told me I had OCD, did not have to be institutionalized like I had come to believe, assured me many, many times that I was not dangerous, and explained that my treatment would include cbt, medication, and gradual--gradual!--exposure. There was this other kid she was seeing, she’d said, who had similar thoughts. And eventually, she got him to the point where he was holding a butcher knife to his neck, sobbing uncontrollably in the middle of her office. In time, she assured me, that would be me. In time are the operative words here.  That night when I went home, bolstered by the story of the sobbing boy, I decided to try to expose myself. I figured that the quicker I got better, the sooner I could go back to classes and move on with my life. I explained the situation to my boyfriend, and he agreed--I would try to firmly grasp his neck in my hands, as the idea of his strangulation was the one that bothered me the most over the months I’d been dealing with it.  Did it go well? Obviously not. I forced myself into a situation I wasn’t ready for. I hadn’t learned the tools I needed yet. I hadn’t built up to it. The feeling of his skin on my finger made me feel physically sick. I just stood near him, hands cupping the space around his neck, feeling faint and getting a panic attack so bad I lost sensation in my body for a few hours. I cried and hid and that night I tied a scarf around my hands when I went to bed, unable to trust myself. Things were worse.  And now? I still get uneasy, but I can do it. Because over months and months of therapy and medication, of gradual exposure therapy that my therapist oversaw,  I was ready for it. I was the boy sobbing with the knife to my own neck. But you can’t be that boy right off the back. You have to work toward it. Refusing to tag trigger warnings using the rationale that they have to learn to deal with their triggers helps no one, because there is a process to learning, there is gradation, and there is absolutely nothing helpful about having a panic attack because you were exposed to something you weren’t ready for yet. Panic attacks aren’t learning experiences. You don’t come out of one and think ’well, that’ll just blunt the edges of the next one!’ They just make things worse and impede progress. For example, as lot of people have panic attacks because they’re afraid of having panic attacks. It’s a vicious cycle, and one best avoided.  Now, you’re probably thinking, what about the people who have these coping tools? Surely I don’t have to cater to them!  Well, think about it this way. You’re walking somewhere, trying to get to point A to point B as quickly as possible, as people are usually wont to do. In the middle of the road there is a tall fence. In the middle of the fence, there is a gate. Do you open the gate and walk through, or do you scale the fence? Keep in mind that, after lots of training, you are in good shape. You’re perfectly capable of scaling the fence. But it would take longer, be harder, and have no benefits at all. So the obvious choice is to take the gate.  For example, I don’t watch Hannibal because I know the cannibalism will affect me badly. Technically, I could watch it, and, using my cbt and medication and exposure therapy, I would be able to work my way through the sudden intrusive thought that I want to eat people. But what’s the point? I wouldn’t have fun watching, I wouldn’t enjoy the thoughts, I’d waste my time and make myself feel poorly. And why? All because of an optional activity like watching Hannibal? And so I make the decision to avoid it. Not out of weakness, not because I don’t know how to deal with things, but because it’s the smart thing to do. So why not label something, for, I don’t know, graphic rape, and let people decide whether or not they want to deal with it? Whether they want to scale the fence or walk through the gate.  And if, after all of this, you want to cry out, ”Yeah, but in the real world--!”, I’m going to stop you right there. Everyone knows this. On average, absolutely everyone lives in the real world, every single day of their lives. Being intentionally unhelpful (or even intentionally inflammatory) online is so often framed as being helpful by its perpetrators; ”I’m just preparing you for real life!” Really? You’re preparing someone for something they already deal with on a daily basis, something they’ve been dealing with long before they knew about you and will continue to deal with long after they’ve forgotten you? We know you can’t put a trigger warning on real life. So every time I see a knife, I have to scale that fence. Every time I go to the doctor, every time someone gets shot in my neighborhood, I have to scale that fence. And most of the time, I do so with aplomb. No one honestly expects that to change, and those that do are so out on the fringes that no one takes them seriously. But on the internet, on forums, in video games, places where it’s so easy to just type a few extra words, why can’t others just open up a gate in that fence? Tagging violence in a post doesn’t mean that I’m suddenly going to forget how to deal with seeing a knife in the ‘real world.’ It just makes me a little more comfortable."
circlebroke,3c7rbu,Enigmius1,-5,Mon Jul 6 01:58:32 2015 UTC,"The point that you're completely missing is that you're picking and choosing those things that you feel are worthy of trigger warnings and dismissing everything else.  If you were taking the full gambit of triggers into account, you'd understand how absolutely futile it would be to try and protect people from triggers.  There's more trauma in life than just violence and rape, and we don't need any crusaders pretending they have all the answers running around dictating how we should interact with one another ""just in case"" something happens to be a trigger.    You're in over your head on this one.  You've seen the tip of the iceberg and you're trying to convince us you know better than we do how icebergs work.  You don't."
circlebroke,3c7rbu,Sailor_mini_moon,2,Sun Jul 5 21:07:58 2015 UTC,"There is a huge difference between working through your trauma and being forced. I work through it with my therapist. Its uncomfortable and upsetting, but at the same time, I am with an empathetic and knowledgeable professional, who helps me deal with that discomfort. That has helped a lot, I am less panicky and jumpy now, havent been in the ER for severe panic attacks since working this way.  It is not walking on eggshells to give a warning about showing a fucking rape. No one is asking you to remove it, we just want a warning. Rape has an insane PTSD rate. Its not healthy at all to have a flashback sprung on you. It doesnt hurt my feelings, it brings me mentally back to my rapes. A flashback disconnects you from reality, panic and shame wash over you again, despair too. The physical pain of it comes back. This is not healthy, and is not helpful to trauma victims.  I suggest you read some actual information on the subject. This is ridiculous."

Besides, what would this petition even accomplish? It seems like if they got 500,000 people, or even 1,000,000 people to sign, there would be absolutely no change. You can make a petition to fire the principal of your school, and even if 40% of the kids sign it, they're not going to fire the principal.  The basic users that are signing have no power here. If on July 10th all the people that agreed to the black out left, the admins would just go ""Oh, must be a slow day,"" and move on with their work. If they're lucky, maybe so q-list online newspapers will cover it, and they'll act like it accomplished something, but it would be just an average day here. Hell, maybe it would be better, because there wouldn't be as many shit posts on the front page.   The whole movement is pointless. The initial purpose was to call out the admins and to get them to address the grievances that the moderators had with the way they communicate. Guess what? They did. They put someone in charge of mod-admin relations and promised some new tools in the upcoming months. They might have done much, but the mods weren't looking for an overnight change - they were just looking for anything that showed that they do actually care. When the post came out, all the mods said ""Alright, we'll take your word for it. However, if you don't deliver, we'll be doing something,"" and reopened the subs. Why? Because they got a response.  What did the user base want? Actually, that's impossible to even really guess. Did they want an admin response? Did they want Ellen Pao to resign? Did they want the admins to publicly cry and beg for their forgiveness? Did they want FPH reinstated? Really, what exactly did they want?  By looking at the events that took place on that day, the only thing that it seems like most of the reactionaries wanted was the ability to get angry. There was no direct goal. There was no proposal. Reddit just wanted an excuse to scream and roll and kick on the floor. They didn't want a piece of candy, they just wanted everyone  in  the store to look at them and maybe give mommy some dirty looks on the way out.  This whole movement lacks a purpose or end goal. The signing of the petition will accomplish nothing. The black out will accomplish nothing. Making shitposts about Ellen Mao on the front page will accomplish nothing. Yet, they feel like July 11th , they'll be waving a mission accomplished banner around as all of the admins resign and Victoria is elected CEO of the company and the sheer patriotism of the victory will raise Aaron Schwartz from the grave to say ""Nice Meme!"" and force Obama to give Edward Snowden a pardon and the head position at the NSA, where, before dismantling them, he will use his network of hackers across the globe to take down Tumblr and 9gag. They can't fathom why their lack of direction or understanding of how anything on this site or the world works makes their cause enough of a joke that even people on Reddit won't pick it up."

The ""You'll have to pry this position from my cold, dead hands!!!"" quote, followed by a $100% true applause, never happened. People are just looking for excuses to hate someone, so they can feel better with themselves. The comment copy-pasta about Ellen Pao that was present in the Fatteing and the 10-year Reddit post had a lot of blue links linking to dank memes repeating the exact same thing in an Ellen Pao macro. They are just saying rumors or misinterpretting a lot of information to make her look like the devil, just because she is a woman and because she banned a hate sub (or actually, it was probably a decision made by the admins, because they were harassing). Ever since she became CEO, there had been some Ellen Pao hate posts. When /r/fatpeoplehate was banned, it became more and more popular. What grounds do they have to make her step down? Do you really think she will say: ""I'm sorry, and damn, that meme was really dank.

The fact that they let Victoria go and then told no one screwed /r/IAmA, /r/science, /r/Music and /r/books.   What grounds do they have to make her step down?

Yeah, I think this has caused an exodus of people who have done that (including that /r/CrappyDesign mod). How much will stay are numerous, as the numbers show that most people are not interested in meta-reddit, however much the vocal minority may be vocal. People can be upset, but still not upset enough to leave for an alternative, for which there are not many.   Anything more than that, especially asking for details about the termination of an employee that's basically a complete stranger to 99% of redditors, is behaving pretty entitled.   Agree. However, I think they should notify the mod-teams that relied heavily on Victoria for AMAs should have been done. Stuff like letting people go when someone made a flight out just to do an AMA is going to leave some people upset, and the mod-team can't do anything about it either.  I do not agree that we need to know the reason why she was fired; that is between her and the company. Since we won't get an announcement, this is left to the rumor mill.

A few AMAs fall apart, and nothing happens, life goes on, /r/IAmA  lives to have an AMA another day, etc. And for /r/science and /r/books, the AMAs aren't even the main points of the subreddits, so I really don't get what they were worried about.   And some say that the tools for moderating large subreddits need updating. I have something to say to the mods that make this complaint.

Literally nothing would have gone wrong with the AMAs if the mods didn't shut down their subreddits.   Their faith in the admins abilities were dwindling up to that point because questions about how to get AMAs verified, what would be the process, who would be doing it were left unanswered. This is what I've gotten from the IAmA modpost and this modmail exchange.  /r/science have AMA serieses (is that the right word) as a large part of their subreddit. It'd be a pretty big blow to the subreddit to lose them. I'm not sure how big they are in /r/music or /r/books.   And some say that the tools for moderating large subreddits need updating. I have something to say to the mods that make this complaint. Maybe the tools do need updating, but if moderating a subreddit is getting too hard for you, maybe you should just drop it.   I think the point is, they're okay, and they're good enough where they can be used effectively, but it'd be much easier if reddit supported some of the functionality of toolbox or whatnot. You have to manually edit the AutoModerator config to lock a thread, and natively supporting locking threads has been supported in software like phpBB, since, well, forever.  No one is expecting mod tools overnight, but I feel like this comes from a long list of grievances with the admins from the moderators. How much of it is justified, you can decide for yourself.   It's obviously causing you a lot of stress, so just retire. I am 100% sure that plenty of people would be willing to take your place.   Sure, but many people willing to moderate doesn't make them good moderators. I think that's an issue. A lot of them moderate the community because they like the community. It comes down to this.

I happen to disagree, and so do the mods of almost all of the defaults, and more.   They took something that worked, and forced it to not work.   Except no, it isn't. And it hasn't been for months.  Note that the /r/IAmA and /r/science shutdowns were a direct result of being completely blindsided and not being able to do AMAs that were scheduled to do with Victoria, not some revolt. There was no way for the mods to contact the people doing the AMAs or anything of that sort, and the mods relied on Victoria to help with problems that may occur during the AMA.  The fact that no one told the mods there after they let go of her that they had done that was really stupid on the admin team's part.

They faced a challenge they haven't faced since before Victoria started helping(except they really didn't, because other reddit staff replaced her, but let's keep going), and what did they decide to do?

The admins are not providing the necessary information and resources needing to do the AMAs, so they are taking matters into their own hands. If you would have read the screenshot or the post in /r/IAmA, you would know that.   You may recall a couple months ago when /u/karmanaut [+16] made this post. The gist of which was management has been constantly ignoring the moderators that run their site for free while devoting numerous man hours to frivolous features. Despite this, business continued as usual.  Then there was the FPH fiasco. Regardless of how you feel about that decision, the brunt of the fallout came down on the mods whose subreddits were brigaded. Again, we persevered without thanks or compensation. Because we love this site.  Earlier this week, we were informed that the new reddit search was being rolled out. Many moderators rely on the old search tool to do their job, but their pleas for access to it fell on deaf ears. Tensions were high. Looking back, it's clear that /r/defaultmods, the private subreddit for the 800+ default moderators, was a powder-keg just waiting to explode.  And then they lit the match. Victoria was let go. The reason is irrelevant. She was in the midst of organizing AMAs for multiple subreddits and they received no consideration whatsoever in the decision. No one was tasked with taking over her responsibilities prior to letting her go. The admins either forgot about the mods, or they just didn't care. Either way, it was enough to push most of us over the edge.  They faced a challenge they haven't faced since before Victoria started helping(except they really didn't, because other reddit staff replaced her, but let's keep going), and what did they decide to do? I could have recognized the problem and worked to find a solution, but no, they gave up and shut their subreddits down.   What were they going to do? Let people get in contact with Victoria and get a response saying ""No, I'm not available, get in contact with the IAmA mods"" (which is what actually happened), the mods have to say ""sorry, reddit fucked us over again because we had no idea she was fired until you actually told us, go on with your AMA without her""?  Because they had Victoria help with the AMAs, and the mods assumed that's what was happening until they got the message from a person who had been in contact with Victoria and said they can't do it.  And who exactly, replaced her?  You're missing the counterpoint to ""why not just contact the admins"". The point is that they have, and the admins haven't done anything."

There just will never be an online space this large that let's people do and say whatever they want. It's a childish pipe dream. There will always be pedoes and racists and conspiracy loonies that shit any place up. Any website that doesn't want to be shut down, either by an inability to make money or by a government agency for breaking the law, is going to have to put rules and moderation systems in place.   If anyone legitimately thinks that Voat or any of the ""Reddit alternatives"" will be any different then they are just living in a shit-colored fantasy land. The idea that there will ever be a ""free speech"" utopia is about as realistic as Reddit Island.  And realistically, Reddit wants these people to leave. Anyone who has been here for any length of time knows that the biggest roadblock to Reddit actually being successful is the small group of entitled power mods and power users who shit the place up and control half the site. And if all of them left at once there would be a thousand people waiting to take over for them and moderate subs and post the same links, but the next group won't think that they deserve special treatment."

Having a real monetary incentive to not shitpost makes for much better communities. Reddit has gotten so horrifyingly racist and shitheaded in the last few years that it somehow managed to beat out even 4chan (anonymity + meritocracy! what a great idea!)  and Ellen Pao is the first person in the admin team to admit Reddit has an image and community problem.   If they get rid of Pao, it's just going to show the userbase that nothing has to change and they can continue ramming this place into the ground.

I'm gonna edit this in even though the chain where I'm accused of being unsympathetic to a cancer patient has been nuked, because it's an important distinction to me: I DO think that what Ellen Pao did to Dacvak was shitty. It IS a pretty awful thing to cut somebody off at the knees when they're sick like that, and you could call it a lot of things - cutthroat, cheap, petty, even cruel and inhumane.

circlebroke,3c3mve,SweetNyan,3,Sat Jul 4 23:55:54 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, I'm not of any particular mindset when it comes to gun laws. I generally believe that there are wider socioeconomic issues involved than just a simple case of fixing it with laws. That said, I'd rather people stuck to facts rather than contrarian circlejerking.  Statistics, facts and figures:  Accidental discharge commonly makes up 2% of unintentional deaths. The statistics on this vary but generally accidental discharge is one of the rarest ways to die.  Handguns are the most common murder weapon primarily because they are easily concealed. About 1/3rd of the guns owned in the US are handguns, with the other two thirds being largely shotguns and rifles.  67% of homicides used a firearm, gun violence is most common in poor urban areas and frequently associated with gang violence, and approximately 0.2% of all crimes are defended against using a firearm.  You are statistically less likely to become injured if you defend yourself with a gun.  The majority of gun crime is committed using illegally acquired firearms.  Also the majority of gun crime is perpetrated by young black men.  In summary:  Basically the proliferation of handguns in the US has allowed the existence of illegal gun trade where burglars who are often funding a drug habit sell weapons, which then end up in the hands of young black men in poor communities, who use those guns to defend their drug turf so they can sell more drugs to the people who are stealing guns to buy drugs.  People who own a couple guns kept in locked cabinets for hunting/target shooting are not the problem. It's the idiot who keeps a glock in a drawer beside the bed just in case and the manufacturers making large caliber firearms that are easy to conceal.  Going further than that, the lack of opportunities for young black men in poor neighborhoods is what is going to perpetuate this problem. The general lack of inclusion and integration into the surrounding culture makes ""gang culture"" seem more appealing, and there is an obvious money incentive.  Immigration laws, gun laws, none of these things will fix gun issues. Increasing minimum wage, subsidising childcare, tax relief for the poor, tax thresholds, subsidised or even free education for the poor... those things will help fix these issues.  You joke that being a responsible gun owner leads means you're less like to kill yourself by accident with a gun. The previous poster jokes that you're more likely to accidentally discharge your gun than be a victim of an armed home invasion. But neither of these points you're making are statistically true."
circlebroke,3c3mve,ZombieOmNom,3,Sun Jul 5 04:11:44 2015 UTC,"What does any of that have to do with the post you were responding to? He said guns are more likely to be used on yourself or your family than to defend yourself. That is true.   Gun owners committed only 259 “justifiable homicides” involving a gun, compared to 8,342 criminal gun homicides in 2012. This brings the ratio to about 32 criminal gun homicides for every one justifiable gun homicide.       Researchers found that no matter what kind of storage was used, no matter the type or number of guns, having a gun in the home increased the risk of firearms homicide and suicide.      For every time a gun in the home was used in a self-defense or legally justifiable shooting, there were four unintentional shootings, seven criminal assaults or homicides, and 11 attempted or completed suicides."
circlebroke,3c3mve,SweetNyan,-1,Sun Jul 5 03:47:40 2015 UTC,"There is reliable evidence that indicates that those who choose to defend themselves with a gun are less likely to need to use it, either because no home invasion is attempted or because when presented with a gun the invader fled/surrendered. Owning a gun does not increase the risk of firearms homicide and suicide, it is merely a more effective tool for this job. Research has shown that where a gun has failed in a fatal suicide attempt or homicide attempt, another weapon/method was used, indicating that the suicide/homicide would've likely occurred regardless of the gun. Again I refer you to point 1. The most statistically significant gun crime happens using illegally owned/acquired handguns, in areas of low socioeconomic prosperity. If these statistics were not a factor, as in they did not occur, then fatal shootings would be almost exclusively suicides. It has been proven many times over in the past that suicide rates are rarely affected by gun control."

There is reliable evidence that indicates that those who choose to defend themselves with a gun are less likely to need to use it, either because no home invasion is attempted or because when presented with a gun the invader fled/surrendered.   Where do you think illegal guns come from? Most come from straw buyers. The vast majority of guns were acquired legally at first. The most reliable way to determine this showed that only 10 to 15% of guns used were stolen, but even stolen guns would have been acquired legally at first, and just not stored securely.  While I would concede (though I have no evidence for this) that most guns used in crimes are acquired illegally (through straw buyers), gun control would help this, with policies such as registration and waiting periods. In addition, for mass shootings, the vast majority of cases show that the guns are legally acquired.  You haven't named or cited any sources, you've simply said ""research has shown"", without quoting them."

Anti-gun people like to use mass shootings, it's almost their favourite topic, because it has so much shock and emotional value.  The real issue with guns is not guns themselves, it's socioeconomic problems. Anti-gun activists like to pretend that these socioeconomic problems will magically disappear if they make guns illegal. All it will do is boost an already existing illegal gun trade, and make life difficult for law abiding gun owners, while also destroying the gun industry. Don't forget that the vast majority of gun owners are law abiding citizens.  If drugs were made legal and supplied by pharmacists, and the money spent on enforcing drug laws was instead spent on rehab programs, and minimum wage was increased to a sensible level, and there were tax thresholds, and childcare subsidies for the poor, and free education for the poor, then we might start seeing an improvement."
circlebroke,3c3mve,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:24:30 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I'm not an 'anti-gun' person so lets just drop that strawman. I support gun control, that does not mean I am against guns, that doesn't mean I hate guns or fear guns or anything like that.  Secondly, you haven't disproven anything, but linked a bunch of images and opinion posts. In addition, most of the studies you've posted are woefully outdated, one of them is 1979-1985, where gun policy in the USA was hugely different. My studies are far more contemporary. Your studies are also in image format, which i assume is so I can't actually easily check your sources myself.  Your first source is from a clearly biased publication, and also relies on self reported and outdated data. There is no empirical evidence supporting that claim, at all.  Your second source is also cast over a wide period and thus fails to account for externalities. Its also clearly false when considering contemporary data. The vast majority of suicides, over 50%, are by gun. I do concede that handgun homicide has gone down since the 90s, but this obscures an important fact. Though the gun deaths have gone down, the people being shot has actually increased. The only reason deaths are lower is that medical science has become better at dealing with shots (Violence Policy Center)  There is a difference between drugs and guns. Guns are used to harm others, drugs are mostly consumed by election. If you believe that gun control is impossible just look at the UK, Canada or Australia. They're success stories that the USA should strive to copy. Most drivers will never be in an accident. That doesn't mean we don't require licensing and registration for cars.  And yes, mass shootings are rare, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be considered. Illegal guns would be cut down upon if simple measures such as registration and waiting periods were implemented, and it has had success in other countries. You suggest that 'criminals don't follow laws', but this weak argument is easily disproven. The short of it is that most crimes are crimes of opportunity. No opportunity, no crime. Make guns harder for criminals to obtain, and it will have an effect."
circlebroke,3c3mve,VoteRonaldRayGun,0,Mon Jul 6 16:00:44 2015 UTC,"I live in the UK and I'm soon to emigrate to Canada, so you don't need to lecture me about how ""great"" it is in those countries, because I've been there and done that.  The fact that you conveniently leave out is that there is still a great deal of violent crime in the UK. There is a negative correlation between guns being made illegal in the UK and violent crime. There are parts of the UK that you'd be insane to go walk in because you're likely to end up knifed. And just like your point about medical science being better at dealing with gunshot wounds, it's also better at dealing with knife wounds.  Knife crime is at epidemic levels in the UK. Look at what people propose as way of fixing it. Sound familiar? Can you not see how retarded this logic is? You think that removing the gun from a violent place is going to fix the violence. Buddy, violence is much fucking older than the gun.  So your point is fucking invalid, son.   And yes, mass shootings are rare, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be considered.   It absolutely does mean they shouldn't be considered. You do not make laws based on rare occurrences. If that was how laws were made, then cars would be illegal, since they kill more people than guns do. Police wouldn't exist either, since sometimes police are harmful. And there goes your enforcement of your ""control"" laws and your entire argument about rare events being important.  Your ""facts"" and ""sources"" are being used in the structure of your argument to point to the wrong solution.   You suggest that 'criminals don't follow laws', but this weak argument is easily disproven[4] .   No it is not easily proven because by their very definition a criminal is someone who has disregarded the law. You often hear the anti-gun brigade (and yes, that's what you are) coming out with bullshit like this because they've effectively run out of steam. You accuse me of using opinion pieces and then link to one yourself because you know your own argument is crap. The arguement isn't weak, it's an impenetrable wall and you can't accept that because it's totally trumped your point. More than half of all re-offenders in the UK are on a continuous offending spree. And in the decade between 83 and 94 more than half of all offenders in the US are rearrested within 3 years.  Here's the biggest, most well proven fact that makes your entire argument totally fucking invalid: PROHIBITION LAWS (of any type) DO NOT FIX SOCIAL ISSUES.  Criminals have guns, they have power, they have the ""control"" you speak of. You do not fix crime with laws, you fix it by disincentivising crime and making it less profitable than working an honest job. Making guns illegal or heavily controlled will make illegal gun trade more profitable. It will also make policing much more expensive. This money will be taken away from social programs that help the poor.  So what you're really asking for, is just about the most right-wing kind of political extremism. For only police, military, and criminals to have guns, for there to be more laws, and more reasons for people to get arrested. There will still be violence, segregation, poverty, drug abuse, and organized crime. Nice future vision you have there."

We have issues where people resort to crime and violence because they either don't trust or just don't care about the system that oppressed them. Banning guns won't fix that.  When we exclude the violence from career criminals against other career criminal we have a gun violence and violence rate at or lower than European states. Look at Switzerland, every adult male has a fully automatic long rifle they keep after mandatory service and they have incredibly low gun violence.  Poverty, systemic racism, and crime beget crime not guns. Banning guns is just putting a band aid on a fatal wound. There's a reason that where guns are legal in areas with middle class populations the gun violence is abysmally low. Guns don't make people into criminals.  We need to deal with the reality. 88 out of 100 people have guns in this country. The supreme Court has unilaterally ruled it is a personal right in DC vs Heller. Banning guns isn't happening and we already have extensive gun laws federally. The issue isn't more laws it's:   Enforcing laws we already have and closing loopholes Trying to fix it in more long term, economic methods    But we'd rather just say if we could ban guns all would be better rather than admitting we are ourselves culpable for the situation through decades of ignoring blatant racist policies by our federal and local representatives that turned our inner cities into the crime ridden shit holes they are."

And honestly, a gun owner who doesn't think other gun owners should pass  a safety test terrify me. Because a gun owner should know how powerful and dangerous guns can be in the wrong hands.

The peoples right to both keep AND bear (that second part gets ignored far too often) arms shall not be infringed. It doesn't even say denied, which might leave room for SOME interpretation. It says infringed. As in not even whittled down a tiny bit.   Some sort of test probably makes sense, yes, though I think we might disagree a lot on the implementation, but you just simply must amend the constitution first.

Disarmed European countries and their murder rates have nothing to do with gun control. I don't mean to argue a proven point, but it still baffles me that people want to argue this way. Mass shootings do not happen ever single week, you fabricated that to make it seem like violent crime with guns is a bigger problem than it really is."

circlebroke,3c3mve,UnluckyLuke,8,Sat Jul 4 14:22:24 2015 UTC,"Disarmed European countries? Switzerland, Norway, France and Austria all have over 30 guns per capita. You're right about shootings not happening every week though. They happen on an almost daily basis...  The United States has a huge problem with guns. In 2012 there were 8,855 homicides involving a firearm. That's 24 deaths a day. The United States has an overall firearm death rate of 11.17 per 100,000. Canada and Switzerland, who both also have comparatively lax regulations compared to many developed countries have death rates of 2.22 and 2.91, respectively. The UK has a rate of 0.27 (and an overall murder rate four times lower)."

There are 41.3 million foreign-born people in the USA.   If all criminal rapes were committed by individual immigrants it would take 480 years for every foreign-born person in the USA to commit a rape at that rate.  Try again you fucking dullard.   Gun control does little to nothing. The effects of gun control have been studied a lot over the years, blaming issues on poor gun control is getting a little ridiculous these days.   Yeah it totally doesn't work in Britain (38 gun homicides in 2011) or Australia (31 in the same year)."

circlebroke,3c4274,WilWheatonsScrote,8,Sat Jul 4 21:15:25 2015 UTC,"I'll respond by posting this, a response from an /r/pics moderator:  https://np.reddit.com/r/beernerd/comments/3c50bu/a_complete_synopsis_of_the_reddit_blackout_from/   Earlier this week, we were informed that the new reddit search was being rolled out. Many moderators rely on the old search tool to do their job, but their pleas for access to it fell on deaf ears. Tensions were high. Looking back, it's clear that /r/defaultmods , the private subreddit for the 800+ default moderators, was a powder-keg just waiting to explode.  And then they lit the match. Victoria was let go. The reason is irrelevant. She was in the midst of organizing AMAs for multiple subreddits and they received no consideration whatsoever in the decision. No one was tasked with taking over her responsibilities prior to letting her go. The admins either forgot about the mods, or they just didn't care. Either way, it was enough to push most of us over the edge.  /r/IAMA was obviously the most affected, but /r/science , /r/books , and /r/music were all left high and dry. And that's when the idea of a strike took hold. The idea had been proposed before, but never seriously considered because, believe it or not, we genuinely care about our communities. Shutting down the subs would mean alienating our userbase to spite the admins. But diplomacy had failed and we needed to be heard.  One by one, the subreddits closed down. In /r/pics we debated the matter fiercely. Afterall, we weren't directly affected by the loss of Victoria, but we were tired of being ignored by management so we thought we'd compromise and make the sub read-only. The response from users was that it wasn't enough. We were flabbergasted. The users actually wanted us to shut down. So we caved. /r/pics went private in protest.  We didn't expect the admins to produce new modtools overnight, or fire Ellen Pao, or rehire Victoria. If we decided to stay private until there was visible change, reddit would be defaults free for months. We just wanted some assurances that management would be accountable to us, the volunteer workforce that keeps the lights on. Most of the defaults had agreed to re-open at 1:30pm EST on Friday because we didn't want to inconvenience the users any longer than 24 hours."

This site is almost entirely run by volunteer mods, many of whom have but hundreds of hours into making sure things run smoothly. The crux of why they so many closed their subbreddits is because they felt that lack of communication and support from the admins was hurting their ability to moderate, to run the site that so many of us love to hate. It was a protest to force the admins into listen to them, and it seems like something that has worked as intended.  The whole thing of users bandwagoning onto the protest to try and promote whatever shitty opinions they hold is separate to what the majority of mods wanted to achieve, and we should remember that."

She would've been better off just telling them to fuck off than doubling down on her comment.   EDIT: This user was implying that men wouldn't empathise with Ellen Pao in the given situation because they'd be happy to see a naked woman. This tolerates and even normalises the objectification of women and contributes to the larger societal notion that men cannot empathise with women, which from my own perspective seems to be one of the most significant barriers to the success of modern feminism. This isn't just another ""WHAT ABOUT TEH MENZ"" comment; the comment linked to in the original post was an entirely reasonable comment because the experience of seeing a woman's identity being exploited like that, as another women, is of course different to seeing it as a man. But personally I find it very strange that users of /r/circlebroke are endorsing the idea that men could not, would not, or need not empathise with a woman in the given circumstance because they get to see a pair of tits. Surely we should expect more of men. Otherwise we only perpetuate the awful behaviour that we ourselves mock on a daily basis."

circlebroke,3c1lgo,VoteRonaldRayGun,56,Sat Jul 4 09:41:35 2015 UTC,"The whole #RedditRevolution thing, along with the Fattening, really shows how sad this site is sometimes.  It seems like for many people, this site is their real life. To be fair, I spend a lot of time on here, but there's people that take everything way too seriously. It's like if a subreddit gets banned, it's like they were evicted from their home or something. I mean, if /r/circlebroke or another sub that I liked got shut down, I'd be pretty discontent; however, I wouldn't be emotionally devastated like someone killed my child or something.  I was in the SRD IRC when things were going down, and one of the /r/pics mods came in and was pretty upset, because people were sending him death threats, because /r/pics wasn't down long enough. The thing is, he had no power over that - he just made the announcement. Even if he had sole power over the subreddit, it's still fucking ridiculous, that even one person on here thought someone deserved to die, because they didn't put enough effort in their shitty little bitchfit.  The thing is, I wouldn't care if one person got that upset over a site, but what's disgusting is that there's so many people that invested in this site. Yesterday, 18 out of 50 subs went down in protest, which was fine, but every subreddit still open on here was getting absolutely spammed with threads about the blackout. People were throwing a shitfit because /r/pcmasterrace said that they weren't going down, and were deleting posts about people demanding that the sub be shutdown to ""show solidarity"". It wasn't even just confused or misinformed people making the threads, there were people actually spamming the sub as some sign of rebellion of the ""censorship"". They thought that the mods were pulling some USSR-level bullshit, because their irrelevant posts were getting removed (which is a completely problem with this site - people thinking that their shitposts belong wherever they want them to be).  When a lot of the subs came back online, the mods claimed that they got what they wanted - which was some sort of action from the admins. The admins basically came out and said that they had a person dedicated to mod support, and they were rolling out improvements in the next few months. Sound like a response, right? No. According to Reddit, they needed to roll out these improvements now (like they're just holding them back, because they're a bunch of evil SJWs) and go to each mod's house and get on their knees and beg them to come back. I mean, they could have done a bit more, but completely re-working things do take time, and we'll have to wait to see if their promises are kept.  However, people being upset about the subs coming back wasn't the problem - it's how upset they got that is worrisome. The comments of each post were pure vitriol and dis-contempt. They were calling each mod the worst insults they could find, because apparently they were ""spineless"" for coming back when their demands were met. Then they resisted the only way that Reddit knows how to revolt - mass shitposting. Irrelevant things that vaguely relate to Victoria, or really anything. The whole black picture thing on /r/pics. It's like, Jesus Christ, how much do you really have to care to throw this big of a shitfit over pretty much nothing.  Then, there's the fact that people didn't know who to really be mad at. Some random mod at /r/pics got a shit ton of hate for announcing something that he didn't have control over - nor did he really support. Ellen Pao's been discussed like she personally fired Victoria, then killed her dog and burned her house down - even though it's possible that she didn't have anything really to do over it. And, really, there's always the possibility that something happened where she deserved to be fired and the fact that, even though how true everyone says the conspiracy is, the mods were never blackmailed into turning their subs back on; but who really cares about the facts? The only important thing fact is that Ellen Pao is literally the reincarnation of a Hitler-Stalin-Comcast bastard child, and all of the admins are her personal slaves that attach to her like an ant queen, and the mods were hypnotized into going with whatever she says.  This site is so fucking sad. If literally any other site did something that a lot of people didn't like there'd be a little resistance, but in the end, people would most likely either deal with it and move on or go to a different site. There would be no death threats. There would be no mass protest and following shitstorm that was so huge, that news sites actually covered it. There would be no fucking war speeches. There would be no fucking songs and shit written about it. Why? Because this isn't a fucking war. Because this isn't some giant conspiracy. Because this doesn't really matter. Because this is a fucking website."
circlebroke,3c1lgo,Super_Cyan,19,Sat Jul 4 10:09:05 2015 UTC,"It just goes to show, doesn't it. The blackout was based on the mods being upset at poor communication. It was a protest based on a lack of appreciation for the hard work they put in, the time they take out of their lives to help improve this website.  The users didn't give a shit. All they wanted was another excuse to circlejerk about how Pao is the most evil woman on earth. So they harassed and abused any mod re-opening their subreddit, even though the blackout was for them. Over in r/movies I saw people saying 'oh, the mods just missed the only sense of power they got in their lives, so they re-opened' or 'well done on selling out the admins'. Fucking idiots."

We don't know much about the decision-making process in the FPH banning, or in the firing of Victoria. That's what makes this entire thing all the more ridiculous.   She is, in a word, a scapegoat. A scapegoat for all of the bottled-up issues that manifested themselves in the two most recent waves of drama."

I agree this is mostly misogyny and racism, but usually the CEO is meant to take the fall, softened by their golden parachute.  We may never know what happened, but usually a CEO doesn't know when a regular employer is being fired. Normally they're only involved at the executive level. How big is reddit? Would a director such as Victoria normally be on the CEOs radar?  But yeah. This is mostly woman hating racist bs.

And as such, when things hit a certain level, they must be accounting for the solution, and not just the problem.   Her inability to solve several critical and long-standing problems is an issue of corporate priorities and leadership, which really can't be blamed on any lower level. This is why the Reddit mod teams (and community) has a growing distrust of Reddit co. While this one act may not have been explicitly directed by her, it is a part of a series of actions and inaction that show general disregard of the Reddit community and its members. That kind of ongoing and consistent disregard of the community comes from the top, and actions like these are (seemingly) at least implicitly endorsed by senior leadership because they continue to occur and weakly promised changes never happen. The corporate priorities are different. (Which may or may not be justifiable or at least understandable on a business level, but that doesn't mean the community can't be upset by those decisions because they are impacted by them).

There's just no way it's possible, unless senior management at reddit is so disorganized and incompetent that they don't discuss terminations of key employees (of which there are only 70) at meetings or at all.

That being said, CEO's routinely get the blame for how a company is run, because that's their responsibility. They get paid for it too (in the US, about 331 times as much as an average worker).  This responsibility for which they get paid so handsomely is inextricably linked to authority. If you don't have authority, you can't be held responsible.  Pao could fire kn0thing, or she could just get Victoria re-hired. She could at least offer it. She could also push for any kind of public explanation or PR message from Reddit as a company, or she could take a stand herself and give her take.   I don't think what happened is specificaly proof that Pao is as rotten as a lot of people seem to think, but to argue that you can't blame CEO's for what happens in a company down the ladder, especially when you include the company response AFTER the inital fact takes place - that's just very weird.  I also really doubt that Pao would've know NOTHING about Victoria being let go. Then again if she didn't, that would be a sign of bad management seeing what value Victoria represented to the community at large, this should definitely have been a board decision."

Just look at what a disaster Reddit has become since she had taken over the leadership role - she simply lacked the people skill to successfully execute whatever ""visions"" she thought she might have.   She may have book smart, but has shown to lack intelligence in people skill.  More so than the lack of social skill, it is her dictatorial attitude and abrasive personality that makes her unsuited for any sort of leadership role.  Unfortunately for her, she does not have  charisma to make up for the lack of people skill, (i.e., Steve Jobs was also dictatorial and abrasive, but his cult-of-personality charisma more than made up for his lack of social skill.)  Many legendary CEO with poor social skill made up for that deficiency with incredible charisma.  Charisma is an intangible quality, some kind of ""star quality"", that either someone has it or she does not; I have seen her video interviews.  She does not have it. (She is full of herself in the interviews, which is a completely turn-off.)  Unfortunately for Ellen Pao, she lacks the people and social skill, and she is dictatorial and abrasive, and then she does not have the charisma to make up for those deficiencies."

circlebroke,3c0gmc,Enlightened-Youth,19,Sat Jul 4 00:09:56 2015 UTC,They take it so seriously and get so vehement when you disagree with them! Then they forget about it a couple days later. Every single time

circlebroke,3c0gmc,AMAathon,34,Fri Jul 3 23:11:37 2015 UTC,"Reddit crises are like comic book crossover events; they're confusing, they happen so frequently, and they don't have much meaning at the end of the day. I just hope this results in the admins taking the opportunity to ban more bad subreddits."

circlebroke,3c0gmc,dope-as-heck,40,Fri Jul 3 20:13:35 2015 UTC,I would give anything to go back in time ~ 48 hours and poll the site on who Victoria is. I can almost guarantee that 90% of these people didn't even know of her existence. Now she's some kind of reddit saint? Wtf?
circlebroke,3c0gmc,thefx37,9,Sat Jul 4 02:29:06 2015 UTC,"Interesting you use that word.  This is sort of a microcosm of groupthink, and probably very similar to what made many of the saints themselves famous.   Nobody cares until they were killed and a bunch of potstirrers raised a stink."
circlebroke,3c0gmc,presidentchimp,9,Fri Jul 3 23:53:04 2015 UTC,YES. It's too soon after the FPH ban for everyone to start shitting up the entire website overreacting to something stupid again.
circlebroke,3c0gmc,lazydictionary,29,Sat Jul 4 04:15:21 2015 UTC,I hope we find out she got fired for like funding ISIS or something so we can see reddit implode. Ffs people be an adult and reserve judgement until you have all the information.
circlebroke,3c0gmc,Amarkov,11,Sat Jul 4 01:01:36 2015 UTC,They fired her pretty abruptly. With no warning.   So she must've done something pretty shitty to deserve it.   But nooo this is le evil reddit admins doing. Surely!
circlebroke,3c0gmc,Chinese_redditor,9,Sat Jul 4 01:15:26 2015 UTC,"I thought Karmanaut said it was known she was being let go for a month or so, though sometimes companies keep this stuff hush until the last minute."
circlebroke,3c0gmc,the_whining_beaver,2,Sat Jul 4 06:03:21 2015 UTC,But wouldn't they let the mods at iama know? Or at least handle the transition better?
circlebroke,3c0gmc,the_whining_beaver,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:09:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think the mods would have kept it quiet, and I think there was reason to doubt that even without hindsight. Karmanaut has talked about closing /r/IAmA in the past, and they definitely couldn't risk creating a situation where he says ""if you fire Victoria I'm nuking the subreddit""."

circlebroke,3c0gmc,the_whining_beaver,24,Sat Jul 4 17:48:16 2015 UTC,Could give two shits about what happened to Victoria. What really annoys me is the fact that half the subs I'm subscribed to have locked me out!
circlebroke,3c0gmc,thefx37,22,Sat Jul 4 14:52:37 2015 UTC,Yup - so an employee got fired. Happens all the time. People are idolizing her as if she's this holy entity
circlebroke,3c0gmc,TempusThales,17,Fri Jul 3 21:37:03 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't care. It annoys me because I had no say in whether something run by at max five volunteers (for me) decide to lock me out due to their feelings over some BS. I just woke up one day, first day off in a good while, and this shit is going on.   I have no idea if this whole fiasco even affects the admins who can simply reopen the subs at the push of a button."
circlebroke,3c0gmc,presidentchimp,10,Fri Jul 3 21:41:35 2015 UTC,"So what you're saying is you're mad that the people who run the forums you read locked you out of their decision making process?

circlebroke,3c0gmc,Cevolian,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:02:13 2015 UTC,It would be halirious if it turned out she did something so unjustifiable that they had to get rid of her. But then again the circlejerk would just bury it in a barrage of Chairman Paos
circlebroke,3c0gmc,Cevolian,21,Sat Jul 4 19:07:44 2015 UTC,"The sky falls every few weeks on reddit.  I'd guess there's a lot of users who otherwise have no drama in their lives and this is probably pretty entertaining. And that's fine. Like everything, it'll be the biggest deal in the world for three days and then everything will go back to normal."
circlebroke,3c0gmc,chauncy_billups,0,Sat Jul 4 08:08:21 2015 UTC,"I've just come to a realisation that many default-sub Redditors are basically 4Channers who self identify as liberals and intellectuals. Like 4Channers, the default-sub Redditor also has no social life, and is quickly interested by the most mundane internet crazes, which are often romanticised as crusades for justice."
circlebroke,3c0gmc,Cevolian,12,Fri Jul 3 17:40:39 2015 UTC,"Like many users, I've been here for years. All this stuff is straight out of left-field for me. Frankly I think it's just mass trolling and bandwagoning.   I think the more folks are talking about it like they're involved, they get involved with their own mythos. Most didn't even know Nobody even knew about Victoria or Ellen before this thing. The mods are just working up the adolescent users with stories of injustice, probably for practical reasons like pay."
circlebroke,3c0gmc,Naggins,6,Sat Jul 4 14:59:38 2015 UTC,It could turn the other way though and Elen just revokes all of their mod privelliges and gives them to more sensible people.   In other news I'm now advertising my services as a potential new mod for /r/books...
circlebroke,3c0gmc,GalacticTouchDown,44,Sat Jul 4 01:49:59 2015 UTC,"What makes me feel sick is that Reddit is more up in arms about this than about Dylan Roof's mass shooting spree. This site sickens me in so many ways that I might actually leave soon, very soon."
circlebroke,3c0gmc,presidentchimp,36,Sat Jul 4 10:44:18 2015 UTC,"I never understand when people say things like this. To be honest, I think the outrage over this Victoria chick is stupid and childish and the people worked up over it need to go spend time outdoors. But comparing it to what you apparently see as a lack of outrage regarding a shooting rampage doesn't really make sense because at least in this case there's some result that can come from the way they're behaving. When somebody goes and kills a bunch of people, it's obviously and self-evidently deplorable. What do you want people to do? Sit around going ""oh it's so horrible"" ? He's already been captured, nearly everyone knows and thinks what he did was awful, what is there to be up-in-arms about?  It's like when people post on Facebook saying ""oh look society, you can name the Kardashians but you can't name this random veteran who got wounded. Shame on you"""
circlebroke,3c0gmc,easterhay,31,Fri Jul 3 21:32:27 2015 UTC,"But this was a scenario where Reddit could have at least had some kind of major condemnation of the crime, or could have remembered the victims in some way. Instead Reddit decided it would quietly murmur about how white supremacism isn't so bad if you just you know really think about it, and come to the realisation that white people are superior... Barely any anger when a church gets shot up by a racist, whereas the end times have come when a half decent website fires an admin for reasons we don't even know yet. No, Reddit cannot make a ducking difference on this issue either, Victoria is gone; do you think Elen Pao is really going to lose face by rehiring her? It would be her worst move yet if she caves like that."
circlebroke,3c0gmc,grungebot5000,8,Fri Jul 3 23:40:38 2015 UTC,Or at least make dank fucking maymays about how awful Dylan Roof is.

circlebroke,3c0gmc,ChokeZero,2,Sat Jul 4 11:10:29 2015 UTC,They don't wanna fuss about Dylan Roof because that would encourage more anti-gun agenda and most Redditors have a hard on for guns

I think there were a few other fetish porn subs that shut down but this one was by far my favorite one attempting to take the moral high ground as a sub dedicated to incest porn. /r/imgoingforhellforthis was also a good one that has no business engaging in moral grandstanding.

circlebroke,3c1vgw,BroadCityChessClub,15,Sat Jul 4 01:37:20 2015 UTC,"So I was standing in a rather large boardroom at my company Reddit today behind a couple employees that I know from when I started conniving my way into being CEO. It was the only business meeting of the month so there wasn't much of another option to get my 12 pack of frozen peaches for the sanitized, anti-child-porn website I was turning Reddit into. I was wondering why the meeting was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a bunch of white guys who didn't want to censor the internet and they were trying to talk the admins into letting /r/FatPeopleHate inspire obese people to lose weight. This struck me as odd until I found out we hadn't banned everything that could hurt people's feelings yet. Now all these workers were just staring and there was even two making fun of them. I walked up and told them free speech would be banned while I was CEO. One of the middle aged guys (I knew these people, so I also knew that they all make over 4 digits) grabbed me and yelled very loudly, ""You stated you were the interim CEO and that reddit was looking for one to replace Yishan. Are we still looking for a new CEO, and if not, why should we trust you to do the job?"" For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven't tried to be a presentable, charismatic lady in awhile so I'm rocking some nice unkempt hair, a business suit, and sensible shoes, so it must have been a nice sight. Very loudly, I said ""You'll have to pry this position from my cold, dead hands!!!""  As I stormed out, a couple of the executives started to whistle and cheer, soon admins joined in and even the AMA girl. I gave a wave and went off with a feeling of accomplishment.   - Ellen Pao  seriously, she was applauded? and people believed this?"
circlebroke,3c1vgw,OIP,13,Sat Jul 4 05:22:08 2015 UTC,"just imagine, if all this drama just kept going and reddit totally shut down.    what would everyone do?  something else, probably"

circlebroke,3c1vgw,StressOverStrain,9,Sat Jul 4 01:25:45 2015 UTC,"That's not hearsay. It's his (rather dubious) testimony of what he saw and heard. If the entire story was prefaced with ""Bob told me that in the board meeting..."" then it would be hearsay.  This isn't a court of law, but if we were on a fact-finding mission concerning Pao's actions, this would be admissible."
circlebroke,3c1vgw,koronicus,5,Sat Jul 4 06:10:01 2015 UTC,This definitely true story is 100% true without a doubt or reservation. I don't know why anyone would ever dream of doubting such a completely factual retelling of events that most certainly happened without embellishment or omission.

circlebroke,3c1vgw,eriwinsto,3,Sat Jul 4 17:55:44 2015 UTC,"It sucks that he got fired. It especially sucks that Reddit wasn't up-front about whether he still had a job. Reddit should have communicated with him more effectively.   However, if I understand the story correctly, he'd essentially only worked for a year in the three years since he got the job with Reddit. Knowing that, it's much more understandable that they didn't want to employ him. They needed a community manager and couldn't continue to hold the position open.   Do I agree with their decision? Not really. But I don't know all the facts. Does it make Ellen Pao a bad CEO? Maybe. Again, I'm not familiar with Reddit's internal business workings.   Does it make her comparable to a genocidal dictator, though? Absolutely not."
circlebroke,3c1vgw,Valnar,3,Sat Jul 4 15:13:24 2015 UTC,"It sucks yes, but legal protection only gives 3 months of unpaid leave to employees.   From the sounds of it, it seems like Dacvak had a years worth of paid leave from Reddit."

I'm really fucking tired of seeing this at the top of every thread. It's hard for me to articulate, but there is a subtle double standard being enforced here, where a woman is held accountable for her partner's actions because her identity is filtered through the lens of the male partner's actions. She cannot even have agency as a human being: it's still about the man in her personal life and how she is also accountable for, and defined by, his actions.   If she was a man whose wife was doing something bad, Pao would not be put to task for the female's actions. But as a woman, she must be punished for what her husband has done because she cannot exist independently otherwise (according to reddit).  Also don't forget the slanders on her husband's sexuality. It just adds another level of subtle misogyny. A man who marries a lesbian is a victim and should move on; a woman who marries a gay man is broken and cannot repair herself or her relationship.   The guy is a gay criminal using Pao as a beard   Its not something openly discussed on reddit, but it seems very evil and insidious to me in that this is how people on this website approach a female who challenges their ideas: by removing their agency as an independent human being.  Hope that makes sense."

She is willfully associating with a criminal. That's her decision.  She is not being criticized for her husband's actions. She is being criticized for her actions. If her husband scammed people out of millions and she realized that was wrong and left him, there would be no problem. Instead she supported him and filed bogus lawsuits to pay his legal fees. That's her fault, and it makes her an accomplice.  If someone commits a crime, that shouldn't reflect badly on their family. If their family starts supporting them and trying to get them out of it, though, the family is in the wrong, too.  She decided she is cool with her husband scamming people out of millions. That makes her a bad person as a result of her own actions."

circlebroke,3c10nt,Sailor_mini_moon,20,Sat Jul 4 04:32:34 2015 UTC,"My thought process was more that I was trying to make up for Zach Jesse 'conveniently' leaving out all  description of the seriousness of the crime and not taking real responsibility when he uses passive language to describe it, e.g. as an 'incident' that 'occurred'.  I think you're right though, it's too close to making the misogynistic connotation that virginity should be prized, or god forbid, that raping a virgin is worse than raping a non-virgin.  I'll be more careful in the future."
circlebroke,3c10nt,redditaccount01423,6,Sat Jul 4 05:17:14 2015 UTC,"Ah, I get that. And youre right, he left out a lot, this is a pretty clear cut situation.

The person you were responding to? Do you feel that every omission of every alternative detracts from that? What about people who weren't unconscious? What about people who were unconscious but were vaginally raped? What about people who weren't in bathrooms? In someone else's apartment?  What about all those? You didn't list them, so if I use your logic I'm going to assume that means you're okay with them. Is that good?"
circlebroke,3c10nt,avatar_of_internet,10,Sat Jul 4 05:20:40 2015 UTC,You seem to have a poor understanding of the way rape victims sexual pasts are used to determine the seriousness of the crime. I suggest you do some reading.

I know what you're talking about. I get it, really I do, but you're pulling the equivalent of standing up in church and shouting, ""Hey, have you guys ever heard of the Bible?"" I get that you don't think it matters when discussing the severity of the crime, and rape is rape is rape (we agree that rape is wrong, period, regardless of sexual history or a lack thereof), but why do you have to bring it up here of all places? Why pick fights with your own side?"

circlebroke,3c0b4m,duyjo,16,Fri Jul 3 17:15:18 2015 UTC,"Lincoln intended to remove all blacks back to Africa or to Haiti.  This was the premise under which he sold the abolishment of slavery to the north - the north was just as racist and wanted blacks freed back to africa.  The free aristocratic blacks of the south (my ancestors), who owned Irish slaves, feared deportation and fought for the south because it meant at least remaining in the country of their birth versus feared deportation under Lincoln.  Then all that was called off due to logistic infeasibility.   That might make sense, if you ignore the more common phenomenon of southern black people fighting for the union after liberation. Oh, and of course they have to mention Irish slaves too, for purposes of historical accuracy I'm sure."

circlebroke,3bweq5,QualityGiraffe,-14,Thu Jul 2 22:06:22 2015 UTC,"No, and it's not reasonable to infer that I'm offended. You're just grasping at the idea that someone criticising an oversensitive person must, somehow, ironically, be more easily offended, or something, because you haven't got an original comment to make."
circlebroke,3bweq5,an_Oneironaut,17,Thu Jul 2 22:31:19 2015 UTC,"There's a world of difference between a private company not wanting unsavory people on their property and the government muzzling all media outlets, artists, hell, your neighbors, from expressing anything that indicates dissent."
circlebroke,3bweq5,QualityGiraffe,-6,Thu Jul 2 23:23:58 2015 UTC,"I didn't mention the government at all. I just pointed out that it's ludicrous to suggest one unsavoury comment is representative of 1) free speech as an ideal, 2) Voat or any other site that chooses to uphold that ideal, and 3) something not rampant on reddit. Because it is. That's what this whole sub is about."
circlebroke,3bweq5,an_Oneironaut,9,Thu Jul 2 23:43:26 2015 UTC,"I didn't mention the government at all.   You didn't have to.  You're conflating a private entity's right to moderate a website they run with censorship, as if there are no other private entities willing to be associated with what the first one doesn't want to touch with a 10 ft pole.  The overwheming majority of reddit's user base doesn't pay for the bulk of the costs of running reddit -- why are they entitled to have their views honored over the interests of the business?   Why oh why was I forced to read this nasty thing that I came here to seek out?   This can be easily applied to the TiA conservative Poe's Law types seeking out ""SJW"" liberal Poe's Law types on tumblr.  Hell, if you took a shot of everclear each time ""SJW"" appeared in the comments of a post in a default sub tangentally or even unrelated to what the commenter is angry about, you'd need a liver replacement at the very least.  Why are these people so threatened by tumblr, especially if it's population is considered to be composed of keyboard slacktavists?  What the fuck kind of adult regularly uses tumblr for anything serious instead of WordPress?"
circlebroke,3bweq5,marytheidiot,-2,Fri Jul 3 00:28:14 2015 UTC,"Holy shit. Literally nothing in your comment has anything to do with what I originally said. Amazing. And everyone is getting on board with it   You didn't have to.  You're conflating a private entity's right to moderate a website they run with censorship, as if there are no other private entities willing to be associated with what the first one doesn't want to touch with a 10 ft pole.  The overwheming majority of reddit's user base doesn't pay for the bulk of the costs of running reddit -- why are they entitled to have their views honored over the interests of the business?   I'm no more entitled that I am to say, stop Cadbury from adding Basil to their chocolate. But I and many others will still say ""That tastes like shit, what a terrible decision."" Bizarrely, people like you love to point out that freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom from consequences but can't see the same holds true for corporate decisions. Just because a massive forum can, legally enforce their own moral viewpoint, doesn't mean they should, let alone in such a hypocritical manner (I refer to the long list of still standing infamous subs, posts, and comments)."
circlebroke,3bweq5,GalacticTouchDown,2,Fri Jul 3 08:40:42 2015 UTC,"Sigh.  Reddit has a right to change it's user base as it pleases, and this is how they're going about it -- when I agree with how they're going about it or whether it is effective is a completely different manner.  We seem to have forgotten what the original comment was about:   The unfettered glory of le freeze peach.   Your comment implies that you literally thought the above comment was condemning free speech.  It's more analogous to what happens if humans were suddenly capable of reading the minds of one another.  The ""unfettered glory of le freeze peach"" is a comment making fun of the bizzare/disgusting shit that comes out of that particular voat user's keyboard without a social filter.  That humor can be easily applied to if EVERYONE spoke without regard to social decorum or whatever the hell is controling inhibitions about speaking about weird shit we think or do.  Smh."

It is probably related, at least tangentially, to the Jesse Jackson AMA. That is the extent of it. We can hope Reddit will reveal more information, and I expect they will release a statement tomorrow at least partially explaining the situation, but I doubt we are ever going to hear the full story. At the very least, these SRs should have waited a day for a statement to get made instead of assuming the worst and rioting over it."

I don't think I've heard of anyone ever having a beef with her.  The second is because it's an excuse for a certain group of Redditors to bring out the Pao shit and smear it all over the walls again."

Depending on what she did, those opinions may have wildly changed.

I've seen good stuff that the organizations do, which is why I always kind of thought that maybe the community wasn't so bad, but the MTG's been around a long time, I suppose.  I've been getting into Netrunner recently, color me pleasantly surprised over the how diverse the cards are and how varied the playerbase genuinely seems to be (from my personal experience, anyway). I just was talking to a couple of friends about how it's amazing that the latest cycle in ANR was being set in India, and how it looked like things were on the up and up. Realizing that the MTG community is kind of stuck in a mire is disheartening, but at least there's progress made elsewhere."
circlebroke,3by3iu,aka_Foamy,2,Fri Jul 3 05:09:19 2015 UTC,"From my limited experience (quantity not format) of playing magic I can't think of many people I met that I'd either want to have a beer with or could maintain a conversation with. Those that I would want to chill with weren't seen often. There was also a lot of times that I'd look around me and think why the fuck am I here?  I then discovered Netrunner and haven't looked back. I've maybe run into one or two guys who fit the smelly and awkward stereotype but I'd happily put the cards away for an evening and have a beer with any of the people I see at meetups and tournaments. Inevitably as well the guys who you might point to and say ""so and so is a bit of a dick"" have a history of playing magic seriously.  The only difference I can think of is the money. Netrunner doesn't do random packs, and it doesn't cost £100s to build a single deck, there's no view that Netrunner cards are an investment of worth any value beyond being game pieces. I swear that's one of the great driving forces behind the mtg community being pretty shitty. The first question people will ask you is ""do you have any trades"" rather than ""how's your day going?"". Mtg is so focussed on the money it fails to feel like a game most if the time. I'm so glad I'm free of that fucking trade binder."
circlebroke,3by3iu,captainersatz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:17:04 2015 UTC,"Also newly getting into Netrunner, I've never been a super serious player of any of these card games so I probably won't get very deep into this either, but my experience with the community has been overwhelmingly positive. Which is partially why it hurts so much looking back at M:tG and seeing this festering cesspool.   I wonder about the difference, too -- I think as an LCG, Netrunner did just attract a different crowd, a lot of Magic players I know haven't even heard of FFG's card game stuff. Magic's long-standing insular community of elitist nerdery probably has to do with it too, whereas Netrunner is a newer game that clearly went out of it's way to be diverse and inclusive from the very start."

And yeah, I actually was so happy with the recent announcement of the Mumbad cycle ( CYBERPUNK IN INDIA! ) that I showed it to a lot of my non-gamey friends, showed them how pretty much half of the runners are female, how diverse all the characters are, etc. They were all very impressed, and I've got a few people that are interested in trying the game. I'm happy there's some part of the cardgame/gaming at large hobby that I can actually be proud to show people -- even if M:tG might be festering, there's progress elsewhere!"
circlebroke,3by3iu,Systemo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:41:20 2015 UTC,"It's what a subset of the competitive community is like. But not all stores are overrun with them.  Some of the pros are upset about the decision taken by Hasbro/WoTC. Other pros are satisfied with the decision to not associate the game with a sex offender. WoTC employers are not allowed to comment.  Copy paste from a pro's facebook:  I am by no means a Zach defender, nor do I believe he is someone worthy of sympathy in this instance. I was a loud voice in favor of shadow-banning him from SCG coverage, and on a surface level I'm happy with him no longer attending tournaments. If this was part of a larger response from WotC to make Magic tournaments a safer and more accommodating environment, I would hail today as a huge success. With that said, I have no faith that this is a signal of any policy change, and I highly doubt that someone over at Wizards is cross-referencing the active DCI database with the sex offender registry. I believe that this was motivated more as a PR move because Zach had become especially visible in the recent past, some of which was due to recent tournament success and some of which was due to him having an increasingly large spotlight put on him by others, as opposed to new evidence surfacing in relation to the severity of the crime or other circumstances that would warrant re-evaluation of his continued permission to play tournament Magic. It is easy to celebrate moments like this and say ""The ends justify the means."" Certainly I've done that plenty in spots like this, and many people who I'm usually like-minded with are doing that right now. The problem is, when the response feels more like a knee-jerk reaction to the political climate rather than part of a cohesive response, it's hard to feel secure because the winds can always blow in another direction. Remember, Zach played Magic for many years with all the pertinent information public. I hold beliefs (political, economic, social) that many view extreme, and my past is by no means completely clean. Without assurance that this is part of a larger policy regarding convicted sex offenders (which I would support 100%, for the record), I have no reason to believe it couldn't be me, were the winds to blow in another direction. I know that this is easy for me to say, and anyone who is disappointed that I'm pontificating over the nuances of DCI policy rather then popping the bottles now that a convicted rapist will no longer be showing up to tournaments, I'm sorry. But I find this outcome to be wholly unsatisfying, in contrast to the community making tournaments a less inviting place for him and him electing to opt out or Wizards articulating a more substantial policy about Zach's previous behavior, and as such I can't celebrate today's outcome."

Pleads to a lesser charge despite the conviction being a slam dunk as far as rape cases go, is sentenced to work at the internship he was planning to work at anyway while sleeping nights at a work-release facility. Sentence is delayed so he can finish his school semester. Really served his time eh? Oh, and his parents blame ""the alcohol"" and his lawyer said both he and the victim ""made poor choices"".

Not a mention of his victim. Complains about how the state bar is delaying accepting him because of coverage of campus rapes in the media.

He's a good person now.  He does well in a large tournament and Hasbro decides they don't want their children's game to be associated with a sex offender. So they ban him. Reddit loses its mind.  He probably doesn't get banned if he displayed actual remorse for his actions."
circlebroke,3by3iu,TheChainsawNinja,-1,Fri Jul 3 04:49:52 2015 UTC,He probably shouldn't get banned unless he's actively threatening other players or restricted from playing the game as part of a legal punishment (most likely because of the former).  The mentality should be about protecting present and future victims not satiating our revenge boners because goddamn we need to make lives miserable for zero societal gain.
circlebroke,3by3iu,Systemo,7,Fri Jul 3 04:52:24 2015 UTC,I think under normal circumstances he would've been allowed to keep playing. But that statement he put out is what I suspect sealed his fate. He probably should have edited it more to sound more remorseful about his actions.
circlebroke,3by3iu,TheChainsawNinja,-3,Fri Jul 3 05:53:34 2015 UTC,"Again, I fully expect a lot of rapists to stay assholes (albeit more careful ones) after their sentence is up.  But players shouldn't be banned for being assholes.  Think of where we'd be if any company could distance themselves from ill-perceived individuals by banning them from their service.  That'd be a cruel and inhumane way to treat even remorseless individuals with criminal records.  Punishments are temporary for a reason, forcing someone to wear a sign around their neck for the rest of their life and inciting public harassment is entirely unethical.  The punishment should be clear to would-be perpetrators but no one needs to be made an example of to get that across; this isn't the medieval era."
circlebroke,3by3iu,Systemo,7,Fri Jul 3 06:30:51 2015 UTC,We'd be where we are today. Univision has distanced itself from Donald Trump by refusing to air his stuff after he made his comments about Mexican rapist. He didn't even commit a crime and he's suffering a consequence. WoTC has its public perception to consider and they've decided on who they want to cater to.  I doubt you'll find many companies that would be happy to do business with Charles Manson or Richard Ramirez.
circlebroke,3by3iu,TheChainsawNinja,-3,Fri Jul 3 06:44:06 2015 UTC,"There's definitely a distinction between silencing someone's ideological perspective and banning them from the website.  Trump can still use Univision to view media if he desires.  Would you defend Univision if they blocked Trump's IP address from visiting their website?  That would be taking things too far in my opinion.  And if we accept that WoTC can issue a near lifetime ban for a serious crime such as rape, where is the extent of a bannable (non-game related) offense?  I'm sure lots of companies would like to avoid associating themselves with druggies (especially in more conservative neighborhoods).  Should they deny service to customers with a drug history?"
circlebroke,3by3iu,Systemo,9,Fri Jul 3 07:00:40 2015 UTC,"The analog to IP banning would be WoTC banning Zach from ever buying a M:TG product. That's not what they're doing. He can still buy product from retailers. What they're doing is banning him from participating in sanctioned events. By allowing him to compete in their events they are implicitly endorsing him. It's more like the PGA banning a player from participating in their tournaments because they don't want to associate with them for character reasons. Baseball banning Pete Rose or the NBA removing Donald Sterling.   It's no longer just a service that is being provided to him, once he turned pro it became more of a business relationship. As a player on the professional circuit he represents the game of Magic: the Gathering community and WoTC. WoTC wants to project a certain type of image to the world and having a convicted rapist who importantly - Is not repentant - is not the image the company wants for itself. Over the years WoTC has worked to create a more broadly appealing environment by removing toxic players and promoting professionalism. Many players are mindful of this and that's why several of them began wearing suits to tournaments."

Especially when he had some harsh words for people I would consider slightly left of Reddit's userbase:   First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;"" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ""more convenient season.   Think of the Baltimore Riots. Hell, think of that black woman that took down the Confederate flag. Reddit's response was similar to both: Police brutality is bad, maybe that flag should come down, but you'll turn people off to your cause with that kind of action! Just like those before them, they wish to set the timetable of another man's freedom. MLK called their response decades in advance, that's how predictable they are. That's how little their type of resistance has changed, even in 50 years time."

First of all, in the context of modern times, I draw little distinction between sweatshops and forced labour. In the latter, the workers, after traveling to the destination country, had their passports confiscated, and they are made to ""pay back"" their employers and the people who brought them there. In other words, they are, technically, paid, but under such unequal conditions that most of the money goes back to the employers and/or transporters (don't know the exact word for the role).  Likewise with the former; if we take, for example, carpet weavers in Pakistan and India, most are children under ""apprenticeships"", paid very little, and their bosses often dock their pay for ""offenses"". In respect, it doesn't differ much than Victorian England.  As for what conditions, I would say that, if it's between ""work in hellish conditions"" and ""not work, but die by starvation"", I will reluctantly choose the former."

circlebroke,3bslch,Super_Cyan,7,Thu Jul 2 11:40:53 2015 UTC,"It's really weird that Reddit accuses Tumblr of being this centralized echo chamber hivemind.  If you really look at it, they bash Tumblr for something that occurs on here more often. Tumblr leans more into ""opt-in"", rather than ""opt-out"". If you want your page filled with cis hate, then you have to manually populate it with that. However, when you join Reddit, you're automatically subscribed to the SJW/Minority/Woman hate, because subs like /r/news, /r/worldnews, and /r/videos are defaults. You have to manually de-populate your site. It's like if every copy of Windows (inb4 Linux master race) set your desktop to gay midget porn. You could have it now, but that would be your doing. However, if it came like that, a lot of people would be upset, because they'd have to be exposed to it in the first place.  The thing about the defaults that makes them so important is their sheer size. It's safe to say that most Redditors are subscribed to at least 1 default. If something gets to the front page and it's from a default, it's kind of a consensus - or at least a very popular opinion. Furthermore, the front page actually exists. On Tumblr, there is no general ""front page"", so it's hard to say that something on that site is its opinion on something.  That means, a site that curates much of its content by showing it to most or all visitors it and allows them to vote on something to make it a somewhat accepted opinion from the site is calling the site, that is designed in such a way that you, or any other user, will only see things that you have explicitly followed and cannot possibly show something to everyone (even their update ""blog"" is optional), a hivemind."

I think it had less politics back when /r/ukpolitics was more reasonable.  It used to be that most of the prolific posters there were relatively centrist and open-minded, but now there's a big contingent of die-hard ukippers, so discussions involving subjects they feel strongly about (European institutions, immigration, ""SJW"" stuff) tend to get pretty exhausting and drive people away from the sub.   At first it seems like it’s quite a liberal forum (the Green Party were really well represented around the election) but as you’ll soon see, the second anything becomes remotely progressive the subreddit soon descends into a typical reddit clusterfuck.   I always get the impression that it has a lot of economically left-wing but socially conservative posters.

And frankly, the best stuff that came from Star Wars in the last decade has all been based in the prequel era (KOTOR withstanding).

The Clone Wars made the prequels at least semi-enjoyable, but there's no denying that they are awful films in my opinion.   That being said, there's some great ideas in there.

Nietzsche argued in On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense that truthfulness in language is in itself absurd and impossible to attain, and there are several passages in other works of his where he talks about the virtues of crafting a compelling narrative vs. accuracy and truthfulness.   In On the Use and Abuse of History for Life for example, he argues against the desire to accurately portray history, instead coming down in favor of using history to craft a narrative of empowerment for people of the present (or future).  Then there is Nietzsche's treatment of the Apollinian (vs. the Dyonisian) as both traditional philosophy and the crafting of lies, deceptions and illusions (Apollo being the god of Light, thus of both truth and revelation, and optical illusion/deception). There are also some passages which I unfortunately cannot recall the source of, where he characterizes Apollo (and by extension, classical philosophy) as a trickster and deceiver, and argues that people need to be lead to the truth via trickery, deception, and cleverly crafted lies.  Hence, the argument that an unknown number of his arguments simply are deceptive rhetoric in order to produce certain reactions in the reader - in other words, trolling.   It's a decidedly postmodern reading of Nietzsche, granted, but I do think it has its merits.

I'm currently playing a FF on the PS2, and also one on the PS3. I've been playing a hack and slash samurai game on the PS4, and I've also got Rune Factory going on the 3DS. My BF usually sticks to the computer, but that's because he's pretty obsessed with League right now. It's basically all he plays at the moment, so he's tied to the computer. I have my systems set up in the bedroom, so I get to play all my gamez IN BED, aaaawwww yisss.  Like, does it REALLY matter what systems other people play their games on? Obviously, for the open-world games playing on PC is nice because you get to play around with fun mods, but even though I modded the heck out of Skyrim, I still played more hours of Dragon Age Inquisition on PS4, because I could play that in bed.

On top of that, they act like taking $60 out of a $100 million profit margin is really ""sticking it to those evil corporations."" They feel like the bravery of downloading a game illegally is akin to a person lighting a Menorah in their window in Nazi Germany. Really, that insignificant amount of money you denied them is accounted for in their financial paperwork. They know people are going to steal the game, it's not like it's a surprise to them, and it's not going to drive them bankrupt either.

It's like how upvotes on an askreddit thread don't show what most people do, but what reddit's audience wants to be true.  News subs are worse though, since they are hiding real information in order to see what the hivemind thinks is more relevant.

Jack shit because that's how the artist intended it to end.     It's a two fold problem, firstly the audience are immature and shallow who won't work to get something out of a game artistically.

I never saw him again. It was awful.  I fully believe that was rape. There were multiple levels of problems here and I was trying to point out that male rape goes unreported often and that there are predators of ALL sexualities and genders with ALL kinds of targets. The post got downvoted there for some reason, someone commented something along the lines of ""I have no sympathy for bigots"", someone else said something like ""this is why gay people shouldnt be put in all male dorms"" which is NOT even what happened??? and I never went back I was so disgusted."

I saved the post, but it was a while ago so I'm not sure if I can find it. I've seen other sentiments on there that were dismissive of the concept, just rarely so blatant.  I don't know why I remember these specific comments, but I guess it really struck me. The only people I know who are accepting of male rape IRL are feminists, but here were these comments online very highly upvoted just being completely dismissive.

I'm of an age that I can see what a difference political correctness has made. When I was four years old, my grandfather drove me around Birmingham, where the Tories had just fought an election campaign saying, ""if you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Labour,"" and he drove me around saying, ""this is where all the niggers and the coons and the jungle bunnies live."" And I remember being at school in the early 80s and my teacher, when he read the register, instead of saying the name of the one asian boy in the class, he would say, ""is the black spot in,"" right? And all these things have gradually been eroded by political correctness, which seems to me to be about an institutionalised politeness at its worst. And if there is some fallout from this, which means that someone in an office might get in trouble one day for saying something that someone was a bit unsure about because they couldn't decide whether it was sexist or homophobic or racist, it's a small price to pay for the massive benefits and improvements in the quality of life for millions of people that political correctness has made. It's a complete lie that allows the right, which basically controls media now, and international politics, to make people on the left who are concerned about the way people are represented look like killjoys. And I'm sick, I'm really sick-- 84% of you in this room that have agreed with this phrase, you're like those people who turn around and go, ""you know who the most oppressed minorities in Britain are?

circlebroke,3bjjm0,Shiranaru,9,Mon Jun 29 22:28:47 2015 UTC,"Everyone has ways they classify facts about the world by.  The Way Things Are, or a binary, or a sliding scale, or ""there are actually two dimensions to this!"" or progressively more complicated options until we hit actual understanding.  When people are confronted with accepting more complexity into their worldview, sometimes they just... fail.  Especially if they need to add a lot of nuance at once, and especially if there's a lot of baggage attached to it.    Seeing gender/sex as one binary is a perfectly reasonable first guess, the truth is much more complex, and our society attaches a lot of baggage to that view.  Lots of people have that chance to fail to learn some nuance here.  Unfortunately, I think actual progress on this will mean we have to stick to some pretty simple narratives so people can accept it.  Sex and gender as two separate binaries is still a lie.  I'm not confident that we'll get people to accept the truth - life is complicated, biology is squishy, and all of these categories are just shit we made up."
circlebroke,3bjjm0,OffColorCommentary,3,Tue Jun 30 05:13:13 2015 UTC,"One part of it that I don't quite understand is, well, how it all works.  I mean I'm pretty much on board with the idea that gender, like race, is socially constructed.  But I keep hitting a wall trying to figure out why, if gender is socially constructed, some people feel or know or intuit that they've been assigned the wrong one.  I'm genuinely interested, not putting one on to concern troll or whatever.  People got a right to find a bearable way to live, I'd just like to better understand what motivates them in their decision to swap one arbitrarily defined sex for another."
circlebroke,3bjjm0,TomViolence,19,Tue Jun 30 05:34:14 2015 UTC,"Let's start with sex.  Sex is non-binary.  It's ""supposed"" to be binary, but, well, biology is squishy.  DNA isn't a blueprint for an organism, it's ... just some weird molecule that happens to be found in an environment where bits of it get translated into enzymes that encourage specific chemical reactions, and everything else is just chemical reactions in a solution.  The details depend on what reactants bump into each other in what order, and all the errors compound.  About 0.2% of babies are born with ambiguous enough sex that someone needs to call in an expert.  Who might just assign a gender via surgery, and might be wrong.  That's just babies who are intersex enough that someone notices something's up with their genitals.  Nobody's going to do anything if a boy has girlhands.  We're certainly not going to figure out a ""boy"" has girlbrain.  The ""boy"" with girlbrain is actually relatively straightforward.  She's going to grow up in a boy's body, certainly not knowing anything is up (child, remember).  Her body is going to produce an appropriate amount of testosterone for a boy, which if she's lucky she'll notice doesn't feel right - many trans people feel physically ill from getting the wrong amount of sex hormones, starting in puberty.  Could take a lot longer to figure out.  That was the straightforward one though.  They could've had an intersexed brain, or some mixed cluster of traits.  Or be almost entirely male but produced the wrong ratio of testosterone and estrogen for whatever reason.  I'm sure we could think of a dozen ways to make this confusing; I'm sure nature can find more.  Let's talk about society.  Genders are social constructs.  Lots of things are social constructs.  Non-controversially, sports team fandoms, different hobyist groups, and high school cliques are social constructs.  There are different stereotypes for some of these groups - motorcyclists and model train enthusiasts are not the same.  If you identify as some of these groups, you probably go along with some of the stereotypes.  Even if you're a motorcyclist / model train enthusiast, you probably act pretty differently at a bike rally than at the hobby store.  We're hard-wired to accept social constructs, and honestly it can be fulfilling and fun.  There's nothing wrong with picking up traits from the (sub)cultures you're involved in.  In our society, the gender social constructs have some problems.  We expect everyone to be in exactly one - not neither, not both.  We expect people to choose their gender to match their sex - discriminating by saying females can't be men.  And we assign genders to almost everything.  Model train enthusiasts are men.  Fashion is for women.  I don't know how we picked, but we picked for almost everything.  It's natural to want to be part of groups and fit in, and this is one of our most prominent ones.  But it's so large, and so binary, that it's easy to have trouble with what you're supposed to do when your actual preferences zig-zag all over the arbitrary line we've drawn.  If someone is female - body and mind - but wants to go full man - dress as a man, pick the manliest hobbies - I don't think there's a problem with that.  We've attached an awful lot to ""man"" and I don't want to exclude anyone.  And she's(?) not even trans (probably?), since she still identifies as female.  I'm not actually heading to any specific point here, you've probably found one for yourself by now."

I'm supportive as all getout on general principle, but I didn't know anything concrete about the biological factors in play and I'm betting that leads to a lot of misconceptions for a lot of people.  Even putting that aside, though, it amazes me that people are so fucked up and spiteful and set in their ways that they can't accept or tolerate people who want to change themselves to become more comfortable in their own skin.  I guess up till now, with all the misinformation and pseudo-science polluting discourse, I had laboured under the impression that trans-people had internalised a different gender role and self-image due to social or psychological factors.  Again, not that that gave me a different stance on things; to pursue happiness and self-worth is a fundamental human right."

To them it seems more likely that the reasons are artificially invented, similar to the way a hypochondriac invents symptoms he believes he is suffering. If that is true then it means that those people are just attention-grabbing, professional victims, with excessively unnecessary, complex needs.   If their reasons for identifying that way are legitimate, then obviously they do deserve special consideration.

In actuality, there are a lot of very smart people who want to do the right thing on both sides. There are also a lot of cheerleaders who spread propaganda on both sides, and it just so happens that the propaganda on the progressive side is that all the conservatives are just bigots.  We're never going to make any progress on anything if we just draw battle lines and define controversies in black and white terms.

You're acting like the exact kind of person that /r/circlebroke exists to undermine. You're so unwilling to even consider that there could be another valid perspective that you immediately start to imply that I'm one of the bigots. I could just as easily turn your implication around on you by suggesting that by enabling the behavior of someone who may be struggling or hurting emotionally, who desperately needs help in other ways, and refusing to acknowledge that they are capable of resolving their issues in a way other than by embracing a new identity, you are being heartless and destructive. Would you allow someone to walk into traffic despite their insistence that that is their chosen direction, or would you try to help them find a better way? Do you let an anti-vaxxer parent walk away from the clinic with their newborn or do you try to convince them that maybe they're not accurately judging what is and isn't in their best interest? Who are you to decide who does and doesn't need help? If we only gave help to those who are already brave, strong, and clear minded enough to ask for it, then those who need it the most would be totally screwed.  I'm not saying that I'm any better of a judge of these things than you are - only that the issue isn't as simple as the bad close-minded guys who happen to randomly hate a set of strangers versus the good, nice, understanding, caring wonderful people who acknowledge that trans people are trans people. Try to not take the fact that I prefer to take an impartial approach as a personal challenge that you need to get defensive about, and try to see things from the other point of view.

I admittedly haven't actually ever thought very hard (or at all) about the gender politics of the word, but that's probably because I've never seen it used in the wild, let alone with any sense of actual vitriol.   This instance is actually interesting because there isn't really an ideal outcome--using ""breeders"" would exclude trans* couples, Othering them and implying they're arbitrarily ""lesser"" than cishet couples; on the other hand, using ""heteros"" would place them instead with said cishet couples, but in an ""us vs. them"" way that kind of uncomfortably recalls the way trans* folks have all too often been ignored or excluded by queer advocacy groups in favor of white male gays.   I mean, I just used ""breeder"" because it seemed so toothless that it wouldn't distract from the central #notallmen joke, but it looks like that didn't really happen.

So if Actor X demands benefit Y, and says it's unfair? Replace X with any male celeb ever, and replace Y with ""Diamond Rocket Ship"" and every word I said is still valid."

If Zoe Saldana's inability to get her employers to pay for her daycare is a bullshit first-world story, what does it say about reddit that this is something they find important enough to complain about?

I thought it was drilled into everyone's heads by now that money doesn't buy happiness, and just because you're rich and famous it doesn't mean you can't be depressed.

circlebroke,3bfp74,minniedahen,32,Sun Jun 28 23:01:37 2015 UTC,I get fatigue reading some comments on Reddit. I try my best to minimize myself from default subs. They are all shit.
circlebroke,3bfp74,NSFW895,42,Sun Jun 28 20:46:39 2015 UTC,"My ex-bf (who is now a casting agent) used to be a PA on several movies and was often assigned to be on-set assistants to stars. Usually men, he said that women tended to bring their own assistants.   He told me a story about being a PA on a John Travolta movie (I think it was called Swordfish, the one with Wolverine and Halle Berry, but not sure, one of the ones being made at the very peak of his popularity) and some of the, frankly, absurd things that he asked for and received. The weirdest, and most ridiculous, was while on set the studio was required to send him five brand new, in the package, plain white t-shirts every day so he could change into a fresh shirt whenever he got sweaty. But not just any old generic white undershirt, no, they had to be $160 designer plain white t-shirts. And at the end of the day when my ex was cleaning out the trailer he would noticed only 2 or 3 of the t-shirts with the dirty laundry, the rest were either given away or taken by John and his people.   Now, I'm a firm believer in creative people getting everything that they can from the people paying them for their talents. I don't care that he asked for something so stupid and absurd. I think it's great that he asked and they gave it to him. But he did note that Halle Berry's only requirement was a certain brand of bottled water, a trailer with a full bathroom and she would ask PA's to walk her (Or someone in her family/entourage dog) dogs twice a day.  My point is, if you're willing to give John Travolta five $160 t-shirts a day for god knows how many months, why is it out of line to ask a studio to cover childcare? It doesn't really seem that out of bounds or that shitty of a request.  But on Reddit, women wanting anything is because of evil feminisms, so of course she's a bitch."
circlebroke,3bfp74,sjgrunewald,55,Sun Jun 28 21:52:50 2015 UTC,The point that everyone was  missing there is that all she pointed out was (Male) actor gets extravagant thing. (Feeeeeeeeeeeeeemale) actor can't even get something that a lot of other businesses offer as a perk.   Sure she is wealthy. That isn't the point. But of course the chance that Reddit would get nuance is like a dog that speaks; very rare indeed. And the idea that Reddit would ever sympathize with a woman is like a dog that speaks Norwegian; even rarer.
circlebroke,3bfp74,exNihlio,38,Sun Jun 28 22:34:55 2015 UTC,"And they are all acting like all she needs to do is hire a neighborhood kid as a babysitter, which is very much NOT what she would need. She's talking about hiring a professional nanny to travel to sets in different countries (For instance GotG was filmed in England) and live with her full time for a few months. That isn't just a few hundred dollars, that is a really, really costly expense. Especially if it is an infant or very young child.   And sure, she's not poor or anything, but she's not worth hundreds of millions of dollars either, none of the b-level stars are. Her ""big"" paychecks cover agents, publicists, assistants and god knows what else professional Hollywood actors have to deal with. So setting aside forty or fifty grand for child care isn't just pocket change. If a movie expects an actress to move to a different country for a few months and she is a new mother then what is the big deal about providing childcare? Unless, Hollywood, doesn't really give a shit about what an actress wants. Which is sort of what she was suggesting.  And someone in the comments was saying that if Chris Pratt could bulk up for the movie then she could get a nanny. But they seem to ignore the part where Chris Pratt was given a personal trainer and chef for the duration of the production, paid for by the studio. This is, ostensibly, to make sure that he was in top shape and at his best. Does the studio not understand how taxing a new child is on a mother? Why not invest in something that made sure that she was in top shape and at her best?"

Equal rights, equal lefts, amirite?  Transgender? Eww...  Poverty? Bootstrap yourself harder. Maybe if you had invested in Bitcoin...  Piracy?

I even saw women in that thread saying, ""Well I'm a mom and I don't get free daycare either but she's rich so she should STFU!""

Either way, equality is just important no matter where. Inequality is usually a social ill that shows itself in tangible ways, but the core of the issue is still within the people in power. The fact that all six stars of a major show were not getting paid the same and it was considered totally ok was ridiculous. Fixing that was a big deal indeed.

circlebroke,3bfp74,Puppy_Spymaster,4,Mon Jun 29 05:44:46 2015 UTC,"What Saldana was pointing out is a form of pay inequality. If the studio asks Brad Pitt to fly to Brazil or whatever for a movie, Pitt requests a private plane because he would be mobbed on a normal flight. Saldana asks for childcare expenses because she is also flying to Brazil. The studio asked both to go to Brazil, but only bore the seemingly unnecessary private jet cost, and not the very necessary childcare cost. It seems the only difference is the vender,  hence sexism. Round the clock childcare while abroad will cost Saldana more, and the studio is requesting her to be absent from her child, so they should cover that expense because they created it. Simple.   Of course Saldana can afford childcare, but the studio can too, and they are the ones who created the expense, a they should cover it like they do for the male actors.   Where I'm from it's illegal to fire a woman for getting pregnant. What, are actresses not allowed to have babies? They seem to have a problem with her feeling happy.   Does /r/movies have any sympathy whatsoever towards actresses? They're making the films you purport to love, like Guardians of the Galaxy. I think they just hate that women might get a childcare 'perk' and they won't,  even though it's just a covered expense.   These kids think they know how a movie studio works, that it's all cutthroat in the business world. It's nothing like this, it's about cooperation and working as a team toward a shared goal.   So many strawman attacks in there.    Yeah, studios would get away with screwing everyone over if they could. Doesn't that fucking imply, you know, that maybe when prominent figures claim to be actively screwed over by the studios that, god I don't know, maybe that actually aligns with the ""logic"" of the ""facts?""

I think the problem isn't the point being brought up-- that female movie stars are treated worse than their male counterparts. But I think Zoe Saldana's examples of this are poor ones. To me, as a woman, it is a bit ridiculous that Zoe Saldana is complaining about having to hire a nanny when women in the United States are still fighting for paid maternity leave.

But, that's not really the point. She's not saying, ""Have sympathy for me, because I have it so bad,"" to which you and others are saying, ""Oh please, others have it worse."" She's literally saying, ""There exists a systemic inequality in this institution."" To which we could say many things, but ""Oh, please, others have it worse"" is almost entirely irrelevant to the question of systemic sexism.   Redirecting the scope of the capacity for suffering onto the back of the ""working class woman"" is certainly one possible way of examining this issue, but goodness, it's certainly not the most productive. Where are all the people on the SpaceX crash threads reminding everyone that ""Come on, people are dying in the Middle East right now?"" Or, for example, when a man gets falsely accused of rape - where's all the ""yeah, but some people get falsely accused of child rape, which is even worse, so sorry if I have no sympathy for your systemic inequalities.""  I'm just having trouble accepting your position (which aligns wholly with the gestalt position of the original thread) as anything more than a secondary or even tertiary half-diagnosis of the situation, and one that has no intellectual function beyond deflecting and redirecting from one issue to another, using the promise of potential sympathy for these potentially poor other people in order to withhold sympathy from anyone else. And even worse, Saldana isn't necessarily asking for you to sympathize with her, but about the dynamics and problems she believes to be inherent in the very industry so many millions of people are gleefully (if not in this case hatefully) engaged with.  So, I mean, I appreciate your point and I get it, but I also don't think it's altogether worth defending insofar as it's not really on point in the first place, and I don't feel like ceding much ground here. Because it all comes down to this: what does your personal sympathy meter have to do with sexism in Hollywood? Why does your personal willingness to deploy ""sympathy"" to this person's position have much to do with the validity of their empirical claims about systemic inequality?"

That's pretty relatable.   A woman who is worth millions complains that she has to hire a sitter. Shit, I wish i could solve the unfairness in my life just as easily.   It's not really a babysitter that she needs, is it? What she needs is a nanny willing to move with her to whichever location(s) the filming takes place at. Could be out of state, could be overseas.

It's a risk studios take with sexually active actresses which is, for all practical intents and purposes, all of them, in the same way they take a risk hiring actors and actresses who regularly train with weights or participate in recreational sports, or cross the street, or eat solid food.  Shit happens and sometimes it happens in the kinds of ways that create delays.  And ranking high on the list of ""dumbest things a person can do"" is finding some way to criticize a pregnant woman for being pregnant, or to threaten them directly or indirectly for becoming pregnant.    We hold certain truths to be self evident, and one of them is that no movie is more important to a woman than her prospective motherhood and/or children.  Nobody should even need to have this explained to them.  And when she points out that male stars get <potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of perks on a 3 week shoot> and she has to flip tables to get on-site child care, leave it to reddit to completely miss the fucking point."

circlebroke,3bfp74,Enigmius1,2,Mon Jun 29 17:58:15 2015 UTC,That's not the point.  That has next to nothing to do with the point.  The point is that there is a disparity between male actors and female actresses when it comes to perks and services above and beyond their salary.  Losing sight of that point and arguing tangents is how these things wind up in this subreddit.  It doesn't matter if she got pregnant and subsequently needed childcare on set or if she broke her leg and needed on site physiotherapy once the cast came off.  It's totally irrelevant.

circlebroke,3bfp74,WalleB,-3,Mon Jun 29 10:17:01 2015 UTC,Instead of actually addressing the arguments you just put words in the commenters' mouths and accuse them of being women haters. Why should an actress be entitled to screw up the schedule of a multi-million dollar production? Why do you make fun of the people who think she shouldn't be able to? Could it be that you only accept people who have the same views as you? And when they don't you just resort to name calling instead of actually making a fair argument? Kind of like a... circlejerk?

The day that mainland Chinese films make more money in Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and so on than Hollywood is the day that the US has been defeated in Southeast Asia.  Historically, Chinese dynasties that rely too much on brute strength topple quickly (Qin, Sui, Yuan), but Chinese dynasties that influence their neighbors through soft power (Han, Tang, Song) last longer.   ...but today even in mainland China it's Hollywood hero films exalting America that captivate Chinese wallets, and in the smokey internet dens it's American online games that consume the youth of China.   Mainland Chinese need to worry about expelling the influence of America in their homeland before they can even begin to plan how to compete with America overseas.

It was the only register open so there wasn’t much of another option to get my pad thai for a party I was heading to. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who didn’t have enough worthless federal reserve fiat currency and she was trying to talk the cashier into accepting Bitcoin to make up the difference. This struck me as odd until I found out she was a mere 0.3194 mBTC short of her purchase. Now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed my smartphone to the cashier, sent him 5 mBTC and told her to keep the change. As we waited the 45 minutes for the transaction to confirm, one of the middle aged women (I knew these people, so I also knew that they all make over 6 digits) grabbed her kid and yelled very loudly, “See that man? He’s acting just like Ben Bernanke wants us to.” For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven’t shaved in awhile so I’m rocking some nice scruff, a Guy Fawkes mask, and a QR Code T-shirt, so it must have been a nice sight. Very loudly, I said “Like Ben Bernanke? Ma’am I’m a bitcoin anarchist who makes minimum wage and I was the one who stepped up to help her? Your hypocritical banking system is an inspiration to us all.” As I stormed out, a couple of the cooks started to whistle and cheer, soon diners joined in and even the cashier.

I especially love fungi - which have the necessary task of breaking down weakened organisms, bringing on death, recycling the nutrients and delivering those nutrients to stronger organisms - usually through soil. We humans have fungi in our bodies laying in wait... as we weaken these fungi strengthen, hastening death - ready to give our nutrients back to the soil so other organisms can benefit. As a result fungi make systems more efficient.  Manmade systems, like governments and economies are products of evolution and thus also evolve the equivalents of fungi that consistently re-inject life into our systems and recycle components. Social media, like twitter and facebook, have been the fungi of despotic government systems - giving power back to citizens to build new, more equitable governments. Napster/Kazaa/etc were the fungi of music and entertainment systems - making them more efficient, more equitable to creators and allowing for more meaningful music for listeners. The internet itself is a network of fungi, changing the world and evolving human consciousness in many different ways. The ability for this network of fungi to break down and recycle systems grows stronger over time.  Our financial systems have delivered enormous benefit to humanity. But more recently have grown into a network of systems that stray far from their purpose of facilitating commerce, exchange of value and investment. Trillions of dollars of derivatives have created a house of cards that serves no human purpose in the financial ecosystem - except to usurp value and increase inequality. These systems have to date avoided and subverted the fungal power of the internet. But fungi grow well in darkness and a powerful fungus has quietly evolved in the dark corners of the internet. Even if it has a myriad of potential uses, this fungus evolved for one purpose - to seek out global financial system's weaknesses and to return its components to a more natural state.  This fungus is called bitcoin."

It's not like the justices of the Supreme Court woke up on the 26th and decided to rule gay marriage bans unconstitutional out of the blue. This is /r/conspiracy-level shitposting. I saw people on there literally acting like the ruling was intentionally to distract people from the TPP. It was in the process of being ruled on for several months before this past Friday. It just goes to show how ignorant your average redditor is of American politics, despite acting like they're a bunch of know-it-alls. Honestly, I think marriage equality is infinitely more important than whatever misinformed ignorant bullshit redditors think about the Trans-Pacific Partnership."
circlebroke,3belf6,deleigh,9,Sun Jun 28 17:22:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I saw this attitude all over the place. The posts I saw the most often went something like, ""Why did they legalize gay marriage instead of weed?!"" As if the Supreme Court's job is just to sit around and decide what to legalize and what not to legalize, and they decided to legalize gay marriage because they thought it would be a real nice thing to do for the country. Not, you know, because a specific case was brought before them and they as a result found bans against gay marriage to be unconstitutional."

I saw a similar post on OutoftheLoop along the lines of ""is there anything going on in legislation we should know about while we were distracted by gay marriage?"".  You are allowed to think about more than 1 thing at a time. Reddit loves to think they are so contrarian and are discovering the ""hidden"" stories when in reality everyone else has the mental capacity to consider multiple issues at one time and because they read actual news from reputable sources they are actually well informed, unlike the bottom feeders of /r/news and /r/worldnews.  It's funny how no one tries to bring up this argument when reddit comes to a complete standstill to petition and get outraged over issues they care about (like internet speeds), but when it's something that doesn't directly affect them like gay marriage then obviously it was just a false flag because any issue that doesn't have an effect on white middle class males then it has 0 importance in the world."

circlebroke,3bbfm9,iamaneviltaco,37,Sun Jun 28 00:24:16 2015 UTC,"Weed talk is probably the worst (besides the SJW shit) part of Reddit.  According to Reddit, the most important basic human right is the ability to 420 blaze it erryday. If they could amend the constitution, there'd be an amendment 420 right after the First Amendment (freeze peach), that says ""Thou shall be permitted to blaze dank OG kush erry day, and everyone shall recieve one 'monster' blunt on the Holy day of April 20th ."" It would be mandatory to be high at work, so ""everyone is super chill and thinks outside the box.""  According to Reddit, there is literally nothing wrong with smoking weed. There's no smoke going into anyone's lungs. There's no hindrance of congnative function. There's no shortened or loss of memory. Despite the fact that there's been little research on marijuana, people feel safe enough to say ""the most harmful part of smoking weed is getting caught."" The truth is, nobody fucking knows. We know it could be harmful to our lungs, but there's not enough research to be conclusive. We know that it reduces blood flow in parts of the brain, but we don't know exactly what that does (Yet, doesn't ""give marijuana a clear bill of health""). We do know that it impairs short-term memory. Just because it doesn't completely fuck up your body, that doesn't mean there aren't any ill effects. While the currently known negatives to smoking pot aren't detrimental, it's still wrong to say there's absolutely nothing wrong with using marijuana.  ""B-b-but it cures cancer/anxiety/whatever!"" The fact that marijuana cures or reduces the effects of a given condition isn't a justification for using it for recreation. If it cures something, good; that means that we can take out the part that has medicinal values and leave out the part that gets people high. Surprisingly, there's people that like to have their conditions cured without being high all the time. Cancer therapy shouldn't be ""here, take this joint"", but rather ""here's some pills.""   All that aside, even if weed is found to be a good thing for you - its legalization is still not the most pressing matter in the world; and to say that it should take more precedence over the right of two people to marry in order to obtain crucial domestic rights that are essential to two people that are supposed to take care of each other is just outright offensive. If you think the right to blaze it and play video games in your basement is more important than a person's ability to take authority in the care of their dying lover, then there's something seriously wrong with you. Even if it same-sex marriage doesn't effect you personally, there's still a chance that it is extremely important to someone close to you. Homosexuality and love is something that isn't a choice, but the action of putting a joint down is completely voluntary (and if you can't, then you're probably addicted)."
circlebroke,3bbfm9,LackingGirth,18,Sat Jun 27 23:20:38 2015 UTC,"Completely ignoring the fact that it's got a really strong chance of bringing out latent mental issues like schizophrenia.  I spent a good chunk of time in a hospital while I was younger, ptsd shit. I met at least 4 people in my time there that had full out schizophrenic meltdowns after smoking too much pot. Turns out they had the possibility of it, and the pot kicked it into gear. Science is even suggesting that it might happen in people who weren't otherwise susceptible, which is pretty fucked up if you think about it.  Good read on this, if you're interested."

I wish I had learned how to deal with my anxiety and depression without pot, and now after being addicted since age 15 I don't believe I can stop and I don't know if I want to stop because I get suicidal without it.  It's not ruining my life the way other addictions tend to do, I still make friends, date, make money, have hobbies. I just walk through life sort of detached, and hazy.

Every disaster, mishap, or ""conspiracy"" points directly back to Gamer Gate.  9/11 was the conception (well, besides Hitler getting rid of all of the Jews that would later vilify us Gamer Gators, if you feel like appeasing the HoloHoax) of the movement. It created the detrimental link between the news media and the American populace. It was designed to make us all sheeple under the control of the media. Think about it, when's the perfect time to pick up a woman? Right after a break-up, when she's vulnerable and looking for something to attach to.  This event was crucial to moving into the next phase of the plan: mass shootings. With all of the population focused on the media for ""groundbreaking"" and ""unbiased"" news, they had a tunnel directly into our minds. When they started to link video games with real-world violence, they were able to tarnish the previously-honored title of ""Gamer"" by making us look like hate-filled psychopaths.  Luckily for us, we caught on to this early. We knew that the attacks on the World Trade Center were orchestrated to develop trust in the news media. We saw straight through their lies. We fought to break people out of their hypnosis by producing feature-length, premium videos that completely debunked the attacks with logic and reason. We produced studies that proved that video games didn't make people into raging psychopaths. They thought the take over was going to be a piece of cake, but those fat fucks were wrong - for us it was just practice for the biggest event yet - Gamer Gate.  They thought that they could push this politically-correct bullshit down our throats, but when we uncovered the true intentions of the SJWs, we had a well trained army of top minds ready to completely blast them out of the water. No matter what they threw at us, our global network of geniuses were able to easily rebuke with the grace and class as gentlemen. Every inch they thought about taking, we pushed them back a mile. No amount of SRS brigading, blogs, or news articles could stop our cause. They tried to distract us with everything - from the NSA, to Same-Sex marriage, to TPP, but we still stayed trite and true, because we knew what was truly the most important thing in the world: the absolute pinnacle of modern art and storytelling. After all, theatricality and deception are powerful agents against the uninitiated, but aren't we initiated GG?  There is nothing going on in this world that isn't about Gamer Gate. Every thing pro-feminism or pro-women is aimed at either pushing us back directly, or gaining support for the fempire. Every person supporting our cause deserves knighthood and the recognition they deserve. The rest should hang where the world can see them, because in the end, it doesn't even matter. When we take victory, tell will be known as traitors any way."

And for instance the very idea of forcing 50%50% character in games is against every gamers statistics is an unfair DEMAND of a privileged treatment, and that is what the little divas want.  You decided to ruin gaming community for your own interest. This will NEVER go away. The internet NEVER forget.   GG was one of those things where it was carrying on somewhere off in some noisy corner of the internet and every once in a while some hipster would tweet about it or I""d see a comment until curiosity overwhelmed me and I decided to see what it was all about.  At first I was a little shocked, but then I came to understand the genius of it all.  It's like a fresh coil of poo for a fly, or a 100W bulb for a moth.  It just attracts all of the dumbest people with the promise, ""Have we got a cause for YOU!""  It's like James Dean, but without a gram of cool.  GamerGate is the cause for people who have no meaning in their lives and aren't smart enough to find any.  It consolidates the propensity of the most reactionary + least intelligent personality types you see making a mess all over the internet and keeps them largely restricted to one place.  It's the closest thing we've ever seen to fly-paper for online stupidity.  The shocking foundation to this entire orgy of half formed ideas, sexually frustrated motivations, and self-righteous hate mongering has nothing to do with significance or even reality, and everything to do with how long the worst of society can carry on when every contributing member has a dick in each hand and neither one belongs to them.  And this quote I copied symbolizes that about as well as any other GG related quote that a person might find.  Somewhere in there is a point and a purpose but it got lost under a mountain of dumb."

That they can't just admit that they're shitheads. If they just came out and said ""Black women make us uncomfortable and we support the Confederate Flag."" These people are straight out of goddamn 1840, but still say ""Oh, we don't hate gay marriage, so we're super liberal""  Today, a black woman took down the battle flag of a nation founded on being allowed to own her as property and reddit hates her for it.   Know why switching the flags and gender and race of everyone involved would make it a problem? Because a hateful bigot taking down a flag that symbolizes love between all people isn't the same fucking thing as a black woman taking down a flag that symbolizes that she should have no human rights. If you don't understand that, congratulations on either failing 4th grade history or just being a homophobic and/or racist shitwad.  Also, there's only one thread about this on /r/all. There were a bajillion about gay marriage yesterday. This is big news too, but it involves a black woman doing something that reddit seems to be physically incapable of understanding, so reddit doesn't care beyond the one token thread because something happens.  So much hypocrisy, so much thinly veiled support for the flag, so much ""that was like 200 years ago, why does it even matter? I'm colorblind to racism (while being extremely racist), the same 3 heritage arguments that have been debunked every ten minutes since this started. I fucking hate reddit  Edit because I forgot this: Reddit, it's not a circlejerk to dislike the fucking Confederate Flag. It's just the opinion that everyone has. It is a circlejerk when you have to compete to prove how much you hate EA, it's not a circlejerk to dislike a symbol of slavery.

Why don't you do a little self policing. Reddit doesn't hate women, they hate feminist. The term itself isn't even egalitarian. Fem for female. That's hardly inclusive. Is it really that hard to figure out? It would be like saying a labor union is working for the capital side too."
circlebroke,3ba5ps,uggmun,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:15:22 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, because there's a scourge of Redditors promoting feminism and only a small fringe of freedom fighters are pushing against it. Therefore, it is my duty to self-police the feminist menace. That's totally how it works here.  Why should they change the name of the movement? It was made for women and still largely consists of women. The only people I see clammering for an ""egalitarian"" movement are reactionaries anyway.  Besides, intersectionality is a big deal in feminism. The issues which affect women in society also affect men and minorities. I'm willing to bet feminism has done more for those groups than the ""egalitarian"" Men's Rights movement, which just rails against feminism all day long."
circlebroke,3ba5ps,adrianjherman,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:40:16 2015 UTC,"So...this is a pretty common response to self policing, ""why should we"". When you don't self police your core group losses legitimacy due to being drowned out by the extremists. Few of examples: nazi Germany, al quiada, ISIS, fedal Castro Cuban revolution, kkk.  "" feminist menace"" your words, not mine. There are plenty of feminist on Reddit. Funny how people always think they are under represented, especially women. Strange how they are 50% of the population but think they are a minority. You don't have to change a thing. If that's your flag fly it. I'm glad at least one of you is willing to admit that what you want is hegemony and not equality, contrary to what is normally told to the public. And if you think men are going to roll over and be out competed you haven't been paying attention. We will concede equality but we will not be ruled. Again see history: we are a violent lot.  Issues that affect women do not necessarily affect men and/or minorities in the same why.  Willing to bet that feminisms influence on most causes that are outside of their of their own has been emergent at best. Which is to say that an outcome affected was more the result of the sum of total of agents and their weight with feminist influence just one more on the stack. The Men's rights movement doesn't get attention because most men don't see themselves as victims. Based on societal perception men are not beings that are acted upon without agency. Of course this is wrong but people like you want to have your cake and eat it too: women are strong women are victims. And society allows this age for females. Men only get to have strength projected. Men are complicit in this. The strength we have, physical, has always been acknowledged as the one that matters. And that was true for most of our experience. Now it is time for both sex's perceptions, of self and the other, to evolve."

There's also a pretty big difference between telling your child that they're hard working, rather than saying they're smart. The kids that are told they're smart all the time are more likely to grow up into those people that think they're ""brilliant but lazy"" that we all know.   Also it takes a little bit more parental involvement to know if your child worked hard on an assignment versus knowing the grade they got.

circlebroke,3b95r1,Sodaholic,12,Sat Jun 27 05:34:04 2015 UTC,"I think you're either overlooking or unaware of some context here.  For a while now, when people have been called out for saying ""OP is a slur,"" they defend themselves by saying that ""OP is a slur"" is a stock phrase and that, in this usage, the slur isn't a slur because it refers to OPs and not in any way, shape, form, or fashion to gay people.  No, really, they say that and expect people to believe them. Some people call it the ""South Park defense"" because of an episode that tried to say the slur wasn't bad because it meant ""obnoxious motorcyclist"" and not ""gay person.""  So the premise of the /showerthoughts post, and especially its reception, demonstrates that this common defense of ""OP is a slur"" is simply untrue. Does that make more sense?"

Lumping LGBTs in with paedophiles and calling them degenerates, wanting to gas and hang people without a trace of irony. I'm sure you get the picture.   I don't want to gas gays. Homosexuality is a naturally occurring defect. Until we can completely predict the biological premises for homosexuality like maternal hormone levels during pregnancy, then we can't stop homosexuality and therefore they shouldn't be punished for how they were born.   Now, I would absolutely love it if we could get to the point where we understand the biological impetus for homosexuality and create practices that eliminate those variables. That would be awesome. In the same way it would be awesome to understand a million other defects well enough to eliminate them.   If homosexuality was genetically heritable, then yes, there'd be an argument for eliminating them from the gene pool. They'd do a pretty good job of it themselves anyway, with not procreating and whatnot. We wouldn't need to force anything.   Transexuality doesn't belong in the same conversation as LGB if the concepts were intellectually honest. One is supposed to be about gender identity and the other is supposed to be about sexual orientation - but it gets lumped into the popular movement because the popular movement is actually about sexual degeneracy and not sexual orientation.

circlebroke,3b7wut,MORMON_EXTREMIST,3,Fri Jun 26 19:30:52 2015 UTC,"Why is that?   Could you explain the ideas separately?   Why does ""supporting"" the vulnerable (I assume we're talking about our American welfare system that is a huge point of contention between reactionaries and progressives) make an economy stronger than eliminating them?   How does diversity directly lead to a stronger economy than homogeneity (obviously we're primarily talking race, but sexually and mental illness status like transgender status too)?  I also think you're misunderstanding or misrepresenting the reactionary argument. Yes, economics is something that's important to them, but society and culture seem far more important to them. In fact, I watched the speech by the guy that invented the use of the term ""Dark Enlightenment"" and the crowd applauded voraciously when he brought up the fact that economic growth isn't everything and should never be an end goal and that society, culture and social strength/health is far more important.   So, please do address the questions because they are of personal interest to me. I'm honestly curious how using money to ""support"" a permanent class of parasites is better for the economy than cutting them loose or even better, shipping them out of this country or making a reservation where we give them land and basic supplies and they either cut it or they die like ancient Greece (or was it Rome?)   Or are you imagining some utopian version of ""support"" where it magically turns our permanent underclass of parasites into motivated, educated, contributors? Or will you be dealing in current realities? Either way, it's very interesting to me.   Also very interested in what a diverse society brings to an economy unless you're talking about a place like Africa where by bringing in outsiders you are immediately raising the IQ and knowledge of the population. I don't see how diversity helps a society that is already advanced beyond the societies of those that would like to invade.   Anyway, I'll just let you respond. But perhaps later we can address what the reactionaries really care about, not economics as much but, society and social health."

The irony is that I am very much an 'ally' to a lot of liberal causes. However, I am also not stupid and recognise that society is being controlled by the labelling of individuals with 'hate speech', where once this was mildly amusing of liberals it has now stepped into the realms of detriment to society (vis Tim Hunt) and thus the only way to fight such injustice is in the peculiar reclamation of words such as tranny, fag, poz, etc.  No doubt the above reasoning is ineffable to posters within r/circlebroke but I thought it was a funny coincidence of the OP blundering across the sentiment of parody, nonetheless."

Medford is not a great spot, and cab service is pretty damn minimal. There's not a ton of return, so it's razor-thing margins for the cabs that do serve the area.   So when Uber came in and was able to skip regulations and operate at an even cheaper level, tons of cabs started giving up on the area. All of a sudden you have only Uber, and Uber doesn't need to have even a single handicap vehicle in its fleet, nor even pick up a guy with a cane if they don't feel like it.  So this lady, she stops going to her doctors appointments. And she got sick. And that's how I met her. Because all of a sudden there was no one to give her rides any more, because some shitty kid didn't want to deal with wheelchairs.  We have the ADA for a very specific reason, and it's horrible that people are willing to trade a societal promise to save a couple of fucking bucks on their goddamn taxi ride.

circlebroke,3bb8f8,wwxxwwxx,12,Sat Jun 27 18:31:53 2015 UTC,"I really like Uber's app/idea/business plan, but I hate that people don't get their business plan.  Uber's business plan;     To offer taxi service you need to comply with expensive and cumbersome and sometimes archaic regulation.  By not calling yourself a taxi service you circumvent that regulation and save lots of money.  By offering the same service for a much lower price, you can compete a lot better with established players.  Taxi companies can't compete because they have to achieve the same as Uber but they have to comply with more laws and pay more.   Uber's business plan is to ignore regulation and compete on an uneven playing field. it is pretty shitty to tell taxi companies 'you guys should compete more', while they have to comply with more regulation and they have to pay to enter the market, when Uber doesn't.  I completely understand why taxi companies everywhere are turning to legislatures for help. Their problem with Uber is a legislative problem.  Now there are two solutions to this problem:   Uber has to comply with the same cumbersome and expensive regulation which is applied to traditional taxi companies. The taxi companies should no longer comply with the aforementioned regulations.   Of course redditors are completely unwilling to acknowledge that taxi companies are trying to compete on an uneven playing field, because they totally had a bad experience with a taxi driver and a good one with an Uber driver. Then added on top of that is that taxi companies usually want the status quo, which is why they aim for solution 1, instead of solution 2. (or a mix of both) This is seen as government intrusion into something that government shouldn't be involved in, ignoring that government has always regulated for profit transportation services, for thousands of years..."
circlebroke,3bb8f8,CanadianDragon434,5,Sat Jun 27 16:19:51 2015 UTC,"uber is 'putting people out of jobs' because they offer a superior (in many ways) service at an often better price.   I live near chicago and unless there is a major event going on when demand is way higher, uber is usually 30-50% less than a taxi (and the drivers are almost always more friendly, their cars are cleaner and more comfortable, etc). not to mention that the drivers themselves stand to gain a lot from using uber; you can pick your own hours and earn far more than an average cab driver.   While it is sad that taxi drivers stand to lose out because of this, uber has created a business model which is way more in line with the wants of a very large portion of their potential consumer base.  obviously it's not as simple as ""taxis should just get better"" (a lot goes into that and taxi companies don't have investors clawing at their door to throw money at them like uber) but even if uber was wiped off the face of the earth today, it wouldn't change the fact that a service like uber is bound to exist in some form.   there are of course downsides to uber, but I think they actually are doing a good job of addressing them quickly (and they should if they want to grow at the insane pace they have been) i.e. more extensive background checks and such.   there's also the legal problems; in most (all?) states, if your uber driver gets in an accident while on a job the legal implications aren't the same as if it was a friend driving passengers. To be honest though, uber and the like are getting big to the point that legislation will have to modernize to address these problems soon enough."

Though the kind of consistent and overt tracism you see now though was not common at all.   By the time the console wars really started getting crazy though PC gaming was on life support. In the mid 2000s rampant piracy had lead developers to start fleeing PC development. The only big PC exclusive games left were MMOs and a few other genres that didn't translate well to consoles like RTS games. So, for a long while PC gaming was kind of left out of all of the ridiculous bullshit.  Anyway, as PC gaming started to make a comeback thanks to the boom in MOBAs, indie developers, etc I guess it was inevitable that it got dragged into the never ending slapfight that is the console supremacy wars.

circlebroke,3b8642,ALoudMouthBaby,6,Sat Jun 27 01:53:02 2015 UTC,"Admittedly there may be some nostalgia on my part.  There were such great PC game companies back then. Blizzard, id, 3DRealms, Sierra, Microprose.  Things have gone so down the rabbit hole that the tiny number of AAA developers today have business strategies that don't even rely on game sales."
circlebroke,3b8642,hackiavelli,4,Sat Jun 27 05:24:00 2015 UTC,"It's weird as the PC is arguably a second-class platform these days   I don't know about that. PC is definitely less populated but it has a higher cost of entry, so that makes a ton of sense. Consoles get more triple A titles but I haven't bought a triple A title in about 2 years, and I'm just now considering ARMA III and Witcher III.  I disagree but that's probably because my favorite genre is roguelikes which are made mostly by indie devs, and it's very hard to get indie titles on a console."
circlebroke,3b8642,agentbueller,2,Sat Jun 27 03:02:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it's treated second class by devs and publishers. Look how broken the majority of AAA games the last couple years were. They're only starting to care now because of refunds."

It's basically the colorblind view applied to games. Yeah, the white male gamer might claim not to care who the protagonist is, because he's used to the default white male one and he thinks that this is the ""normal"" way things should be. Any deviations from the norm are not just one perspective out of many, but an affront against the supposedly ""neutral""/""normal"" narrative.  It's so easy to pretend you don't care about race or gender when it's your race or gender that's it's overwhelmingly featured. Really, is it that hard to apply some perspective?"

If they really don't care who the protagonist is, then their enjoyment will be 100% completely unaffected in any way even if developers start publishing games with no white male protagonists at all. Other people who do care, meanwhile, will find their enjoyment increasing as they see more representation of people like them. Not only will the net amount of enjoyment in the world increase, no individual person's enjoyment will decrease. It's like, the best of all possible worlds. So if a person really didn't care, why would they possibly object? In fact, why would they offer anything at all other than support or apathetic silence?"

circlebroke,3b8642,mattwan,24,Sat Jun 27 01:06:36 2015 UTC,"This is and always has been an issue of market segmentation.   Marketing in video games has always been to a niche audience. Today, digital distribution platforms like GOG and Steam give small developers a place to sell their games and make them financially viable, where previously there was none. This has led to an explosion in the variety of game types that are made, and with it, an appeal to a more diverse audience. Think about the types of games that were released on the NES or Genisis. How many platformers were there? This didn't really lend itself to widespread appeal. The demographic for those games were very specific. So what did marketers do?   Marketing is not about selling games. That's what salesmen do. Marketers create an image of what it means to buy the product. one of the most effective and widely used ways of doing this is marketing segmentation. You divide a broad target market into subsets, and then market in a way that creates a reaction to the homogenous, distinctive subset of that target market. When you have such a niche market for the type of people who play the specific type of video games, their job is easy. Optimize your message in such a way that your target demographic feels superior to those who do not buy the product. This has the duel effect of excluding unwanted demographics from the target group, thus increasing profit margins through the cost/benefit of spending money on your marketing design, brand communication, places where you put your advertisements ect. and the return you get on that investment.  So, for example, if your target demographic is men, it would make sense to exclude and segregate women, from a purely business perspective. Its easiest to tailor your narrative using prevalent concepts about men and women. In fact, reinforcing those concepts actually strengthens your narrative.  Things like more diversity in games actually signal a possible sea change in marketing, which is a positive thing. AAA gamers are realizing that there are now markets that they have completely been neglecting that could be making them tons of money and are moving to meet those demands. When that guy was talking about ""If there is a demand for more diverse characters, those games will get made"", I don't think he realizes that is exactly what is happening.  Marketers certainly aren't ""putting diversity in games"" (whatever that means) out of the goodness of their hearts."

It sort of forces introspection about how we have put limits on our compassion which is supposed to be limitless, bounds on our love that is supposed to be boundless. It suggests we should have empathy (but not sympathy) even for the Devil. If I were still a Christian, I think it would inspire me to work harder to be more Christ-like rather than tempting me away from the faith.

It's a complicated, multifaceted concept, and there's a lot of unknowns involved.  First, it's important to remember that Germany (and the rest of Europe) suffered greatly under the Nazis, so it's completely understandable that they would want to take steps to prevent it from happening again.  I can understand the hesitance to criminalize a viewpoint. But this is not an opinion- you won't be sent to jail for saying, ""I think the welfare state is a burden that does not provide enough benefits to justify its existence"". The Holocaust happened. People who say that it didn't are simply wrong.   Is the freedom to spread lies about the Holocaust essential to the average German? I'd argue no. The only issue here is the possibility of criminalizing other, less clear and distinct opinions. But that's only a slippery slope argument."
