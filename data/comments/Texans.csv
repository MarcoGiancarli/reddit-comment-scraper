Texans,3dudfk,GrammarBeImportant,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:40:24 2015 UTC,He'd be great for all the young receivers we have.
Texans,3dudfk,This-Is-My-Moment,53,Sun Jul 19 23:11:29 2015 UTC,Not gonna lie. Kinda hope he ends up here cause fuck the colts.   I know we won't take him because he's old and injury prone. If we wanted one of those we'd have kept aj80
Texans,3dudfk,electricalenginerd,7,Sun Jul 19 15:56:03 2015 UTC,Reggie Wayne is nowhere near the level of ability that AJ is at right now. Reggie had 1 reception in the playoffs.
Texans,3dudfk,mrtrollmaster,5,Sun Jul 19 18:18:07 2015 UTC,he was playing with a torn tricep
Texans,3dudfk,lagatron,4,Mon Jul 20 13:08:51 2015 UTC,Not sure if trolling or colts fan
Texans,3dudfk,electricalenginerd,5,Sun Jul 19 19:17:56 2015 UTC,"why would you think that was a troll post, the fact that Reggie Wayne is till a free agent doesn't tell you something?"
Texans,3dudfk,Ravid32,15,Sun Jul 19 20:17:21 2015 UTC,The username. That's why
Texans,3dudfk,electricalenginerd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:47:32 2015 UTC,"I'm serious. AJ went for 100 yds and a TD against Vontae Davis when we played you. Reggie went for 12 yds in 3 playoff games. However, Reggie dod have a couple of beast seasons when he was AJ's age and Luck was new to the league."
Texans,3dudfk,mrtrollmaster,-2,Sun Jul 19 19:44:57 2015 UTC,Oh snap I didn't realize Wayne was older than andre. But andre doesn't have anything left in the tank.

Texans,3dudfk,This-Is-My-Moment,3,Sun Jul 19 23:10:52 2015 UTC,I'd imagine the Jags/Titans would make a bid for him.
Texans,3dudfk,Simpleton216,6,Sun Jul 19 16:40:54 2015 UTC,Gus Bradley appears to be building almost strictly through the draft. As he should. I don't imagine the Jags picking up Wayne.  The Titans? Who knows what the fuck they're doing over there.
Texans,3dudfk,CruisinForABrewsin,4,Sun Jul 19 18:20:05 2015 UTC,I doubt the Jags. They have lots of young talent they probably want to let grow with Bortles
Texans,3dudfk,Wham_Bam_Smash,4,Sun Jul 19 18:14:33 2015 UTC,I figured they'd get him as a mentor for the young guys.
Texans,3dudfk,Simpleton216,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:42:07 2015 UTC,The Jags might secretly have one of the most loaded receiving corps in the league. They're so loaded with depth right now that signing Wayne would mean taking away snaps for someone else.  I bet Wayne goes with a team like NE or Green Bay - teams with great QB's who can help him hide what he's lost in his age.
Texans,3dudfk,iammattchambers,9,Sun Jul 19 19:34:09 2015 UTC,"I hope the Titans get him, and then he sucks. So they can both get fucked."

Texans,3dudfk,mementori,29,Mon Jul 20 16:19:21 2015 UTC,I wouldn't like it.   We have too many receivers as it is. He's old and we should look towards the future. We're better than the Colts and don't need to stoop to their level. Fuck the Colts.
Texans,3dudfk,BisonST,11,Sun Jul 19 16:18:09 2015 UTC,But how many of them are good? Hopkins is. Shorts is but is an injury concern. Strong is a rookie so won't be cut. Wrong Johnson sucks and is depth. Nate Washington is eh. Martin is a scrub. Bonner is meh. Mumphry is an unknown rookie too. That's 1 receiver that's definite production He is old. But one year of Reggie Wayne playing the slot and teaching the young guys routes sounds amazing. I'm spiteful. Exactly why yes.
Texans,3dudfk,Wham_Bam_Smash,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:17:48 2015 UTC,How much u think he'll cost?
Texans,3dudfk,Peacebon3r,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:56:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we're really lacking in experience at the WR position.  Wayne may be more willing to take a backseat mentor role than Andre was, meaning he's a better fit under BoB's offense."
Texans,3dudfk,JodiskeInternetFor,4,Mon Jul 20 06:31:47 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. This would look more like a move to jab back at the Colts for taking Andre than anything else, and fuck all that. Plus, as you said, fuck the Colts - Reggie can get fucked as well."

Texans,3dudfk,dudenotcool,2,Sun Jul 19 17:15:15 2015 UTC,"That's Reddit in general. For some reason when it sees 5., etc. it starts off at 1, regardless of what number you put in."
Texans,3dudfk,BisonST,5,Sun Jul 19 17:18:25 2015 UTC,"I mean another solid receiver can't hurt, but given our already kind of silly logjam at the position if this happens it better be damn cheap."
Texans,3dudfk,Quadrophenic,2,Sun Jul 19 16:13:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed. DHop, CS3, Strong, Washington, Damaris, Mumphrey, and guys like Labhart and EZ. I don't see this playing out unless it's vet min or something. It seems we're really trying to build through the draft and base our play off of a solid system."
Texans,3dudfk,johnabrille,2,Sun Jul 19 16:21:32 2015 UTC,I think it definitely can hurt. We don't need him as a veteran presence since we have Washington and shorts. We have plenty of recievers that seem to be doing a great job competing for final roster spots. Taking on Wayne just denies a young guy with potential from having a spot on our team.  Doing that could mean slowing his progression and (correct me if I'm wrong) but other teams could sign that player from our practice squad. We're not a win now team really.   If rather the pats pick him up. They are a win now before Brady retires and the colts-pats rivalry is strong enough for a fuck you to make me happy
Texans,3dudfk,InbreadSourdough,3,Sun Jul 19 18:24:39 2015 UTC,"No thanks, don't need their leftovers."
Texans,3dudfk,chaserjames,3,Sun Jul 19 16:35:38 2015 UTC,"Good idea. Obtain Luck's Stenghts, weaknesses, route progressions, read tendencies etc. This would also stick it to the Colts fan base for taking AJ. An eye for an eye motherfuckers."
Texans,3dudfk,seanchump,2,Sun Jul 19 16:43:17 2015 UTC,"You can do all of that by watching tape though. You don't have to date someone's ex just because they took your girl.  We're talking about a guy who, if signed, likely wouldn't get significant snaps. It doesn't make sense to invest money in a player who doesn't make us much better."

Texans,3dvtsw,noobjafoob,10,Sun Jul 19 23:19:25 2015 UTC,"I'd say either TE or SS. Rahim Moore at FS will be solid enough but as much as we like to hate on Swearinger now that he's gone, we didn't really replace him with anybody that was better than him.  The TE group has potential but we still haven't seen anything yet."
Texans,3dvtsw,faceripperr,4,Mon Jul 20 00:10:19 2015 UTC,Pretty unfortunate our TE group is subpar. BoB loves those 2 TE sets but we just dont have the personnel for it. I miss Ownn Daniels =/
Texans,3dvtsw,no_one_knows42,3,Mon Jul 20 01:58:28 2015 UTC,I think it's a myth that BoB loves the two tight end set. He simply had two great tight ends at the time. He will use whatever he has available.

Texans,3dvtsw,Logorrhea_,3,Mon Jul 20 14:54:39 2015 UTC,Tell me more! Did you line up against him? What made him stand out?

CBs are amazing, couldn't be happier with JJo, KJax and KJo with Bouye, Morris, Rolle, James too  FS is Rahim Moore and i'm very happy with that, but SS...? I just don't know...  On offense, ignoring obvious QB comment, has to be O-Line depth or  TE really"

Texans,3dvtsw,Lobo_Marino,3,Mon Jul 20 15:15:12 2015 UTC,"No, because it's classic Texans for a LB to get injured and we need them all"

Texans,3dvtsw,Literally_JaclynGlen,7,Mon Jul 20 12:13:41 2015 UTC,"We all acknowledged it continuously up until the point passed when the team could realistically do anything else to strengthen at QB.

Texans,3dvtsw,htownholditdown,2,Mon Jul 20 14:23:37 2015 UTC,"QB is more important than SS or TE, but our QBs are better than our TEs or SSs.  So given a choice between upgrading one or the other, I'd take QB.  But we have meh QBs.  We have awful SSs."
Texans,3dvtsw,Quadrophenic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:54:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's that everyone is afraid to acknowledge it, it's more that people want to avoid all saying the same position. Would make for a pretty stale thread, and it's the most obvious answer."
Texans,3dvtsw,CruisinForABrewsin,3,Tue Jul 21 03:06:10 2015 UTC,i am TERRIFIED of strong safety being an issue once the season starts. we all remember what terrible safety play looked like (Eugene Wilson anyone????) and it is horrific
Texans,3dvtsw,w2eatherman,3,Mon Jul 20 01:58:24 2015 UTC,"I'll say it, WR is pretty damn weak.  Hopkins: Actually good, so we'll skip him  Shorts: Could be good, if he wasn't injured all the damn time. He hasn't ever played a full 16 games. Thats not good.  Washington: He's old. He's only 31, but that's still pretty old. He'll probably be the most stable WR, excluding Hopkins.  Strong, Mumphry: Rookies. Could be good, could be bad, we have no real idea yet  D. Johnson: He's fast. That's about it.   Keshawn Martin: Ugh.  Alan Bonner: Its his third year here, and I don't think he's even played in a preseason game. He just can't seem to stay healthy.  So yeah, one good player, two veterans that can be pretty good, but are injury-prone/old, two rookies who could be very good or very bad, one fast dude, and two wastes of roster space."
Texans,3dvtsw,zombiebillnye,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:38:33 2015 UTC,"QB, safety, and TE are all question marks. We don't know who's going to start or who is going to step up and play great."
Texans,3dvtsw,VitaminBro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:34:10 2015 UTC,I think our TE crop is really underrated. Now that our QB's are moving away from the single read offense that BOB had to water down for Fitzy should help that.
Texans,3dvtsw,iammattchambers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:24:56 2015 UTC,"This doesn't really answer the question exactly, but I wanna say our offense as a whole.   Aside from Arian, there is a question mark at every position group.   Who's our QB? Center? How's XSF gonna do? OLine as a whole?  Nuk as WR1? Whose WR2? WR3?  TE performance?   That's our whole offense aside from Arian. I think we have decent answers for each of those questions but the fact remains that one side of the ball is pretty much entirely up in the air."
Texans,3dv4fk,Tune_of_the_Piper,22,Sun Jul 19 19:43:49 2015 UTC,"I like the legend number idea. But regardless of how it's done, I think our first retired number/ring of honor inductee ends up being #80."
Texans,3dv4fk,iammattchambers,13,Sun Jul 19 19:53:49 2015 UTC,"Have to keep #99 available though. You know, for when JJ Watt's sons/grandsons follow his footsteps and come play for Houston."
Texans,3dv4fk,CruisinForABrewsin,8,Sun Jul 19 21:09:57 2015 UTC,"No, at that point we'll be Super Bowl champs, so the #1 pick for Justin James Watt Jr., Defensive End out of Wisconsin, won't be available to us. It's sad that it has to be this way, but when the time comes, we can hopefully all pull together and cry into our many Super Bowls."
Texans,3dv4fk,effortlessgrace,3,Sun Jul 19 21:56:18 2015 UTC,I can't wait for JJJ. (Justin James Watt Jr.)  Maybe he'll be a TE who occasionally takes snaps on the D-Line.
Texans,3dv4fk,iammattchambers,10,Mon Jul 20 15:29:57 2015 UTC,23 will probably be off limits. Foster has had one of the best careers for an Undrafted player ever. The Texans have to respect the incredible way he has carried the ball for so many years.

Texans,3dv4fk,w2eatherman,4,Sun Jul 19 20:35:54 2015 UTC,99 is a lock considering he's easily on pace to be a first ballot hall of famer. Is there any doubt that he'll continue to be a dominant force?
Texans,3dv4fk,TripStep,6,Mon Jul 20 03:04:09 2015 UTC,"Let's see...he's 3 years into his career and still very young. If we don't start getting serious about winning shit, he'll have to put up absurd numbers for most of his career to be considered a ""lock"" to get in. His production is so unprecedented that we really don't know how a major injury would effect his ability to sustain it, but realistically it could slow him down a lot if he picks one up.  I'm not saying it won't happen, but I'd maybe wait another 3 years at least before you start calling him a surefire first ballot HOFer."
Texans,3dv4fk,DoktorStrangelove,3,Mon Jul 20 03:40:26 2015 UTC,Pretty sure he's now four years into his career...
Texans,3dv4fk,TTTA,3,Mon Jul 20 12:00:49 2015 UTC,"Ah you're right. Still, I stick by everything else I said. If he were to slow down or get hurt then he'd be remembered as a defensive Bo Jackson at this point. I think he's got potential to be on Lawrence Taylor's level, but that's a loooong way down the road still."
Texans,3dv4fk,DoktorStrangelove,4,Mon Jul 20 12:06:54 2015 UTC,I'd retire 80 and 99 for sure. Also I think the Ravens should be off this list soon if they do the right thing and retire Ogden's 75 and Ray's 52

I think if those things happen he has earned the right to have his jersey retired with us. 99 is next in line, but let's not even think about all that for another 10 years at least."
Texans,3dv4fk,htownholditdown,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:22:30 2015 UTC,"I'd say with almost 100% certainty that #80 will be the first one retired, probably within 3 years or so of Dre retiring.  I also think that it’s safe to say if #99 stays in Houston, and stays healthy, for 5+ more years, he’d be next.  I don’t know about #23 yet, despite what he’s done, he’s not on the same level as 80/99.  As for the Ravens, surprised they haven’t retired one yet. No Ogden?

Texans,3dqljl,LOOK_AT_IT,2,Sat Jul 18 19:12:09 2015 UTC,"Sunday Ticket is basically a must, but to get every game (without using streams)* he'll need: Sunday Ticket, NFL network, ESPN, local Fox, local NBC, and local CBS coverage."
Texans,3dqljl,Mittens-Romney,2,Sat Jul 18 15:14:07 2015 UTC,For me I lived in the Dallas area for 2 years. I only missed 2-4 games I think. Usually they schedule one game on CBS and the other on FOX so it isn't terrible but if they are on the same channel the Cowboys game gets precedence.
Texans,3dqljl,rab7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:02:35 2015 UTC,"Even when the Cowboys are on fox or snf/mnf, they still more often than not put another game on cbs.   There have been way too many weeks where the broadcast map is all one color in Texas except for the dfw splotch  Edit: I checked 2014 and counted at least 7 where we were not on tv"
Texans,3dqljl,Theageofpisces,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:23:05 2015 UTC,"Sirius Radio has become my new friend. It's hard to find a good stream of regular radio coverage. Also, 506 Sports is my go-to for coverage maps."
Texans,3dqljl,jdubba,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:19:11 2015 UTC,"Hard to say.  For example look at this broadcast map from week 2 of last year.  Green is the Houston game broadcast.  If you look at a map of Palestine, it's quite a bit south east of the central metroplex area, somewhere kind of close to that red/green broadcast border.  If it falls in the red, then you'll pretty much need to find a streaming/sling-box/NFL Ticket solution.  Sounds like from other responses you could miss 5-7 games otherwise.  If you're in the Green, it will probably be closer to what we experience here in Austin, which is usually getting screwed out of 1 sometimes 2 games a year.  Personally the wife and I keep Sunday Ticket just for those 1/2 games, plus I like to be able to game surf when the Texans aren't on, but I think a lot of folks around here just go out to a sports bar, or get together in groups etc. since it impacts fewer games."

I currently live in a pretty rural part of the county, I work at the South Texas Project (nuclear plant).   I mean if you're young and are looking for a great night life keep looking. One of the bigger selling points to me having lived in Chicago and Kansas City before was ""no snow"".   The people are also a mixed bag. You find some of the nicest and best people here, but their next door neighbor can be as backwoods redneck as you can get.   But that's just where I'm at. I loved living in Houston, just didn't like the commute and the traffic.   The culinary scene in Houston is top notch (just wish I could find GOOD Korean BBQ), the music scene is a little lacking, the humidity is nasty and will keep you indoors a lot (part of why Houston is so fat, the other reason is the culinary scene). Public transportation is a joke, and lack of zoning restrictions have caused an AWFUL case of urban sprawl. I love Houston, I'd live there again if I could have a job and a house within 10-15 minutes of each other."

Crick should shine this year because teams will have their hands full with JJ, Clowney, Vince, and Cushing.

Pretty sure I was the fallback candidate while they negotiated with another person. Well, good for that guy, but dammit.  This fucking oil market is killing me. I've got two other companies that want to hire me, but neither is super motivated to hire anyone right now, especially since everyone else is laying off.  Current job is giving me a brain tumor.  I should just start a pizza and beer joint. I'd be fatter but way happier.  True Detective needs to get it's shit together soon too.

Texans,3djvqd,Barian_Fostate,12,Thu Jul 16 21:27:02 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what i was thinking when i saw these 70 mil deals.  Im so excited to have Hopkins playing in Houston, but it also made me go back and look at each Superbowl winner for the past decade and more.  Maybe its just random and the sample size is not great, but my point is this.    Teams with elite WRs and their elite paychecks don't win Superbowls.  I'm only making an observation here.  When you have elite players other than Quarterbacks the common denominator is winning seasons and nothing to show for them.  My fear is that we kick the can down the road and pay these stud role players and not invest in the one thing that brings home the Lombardi.  I hope BoB  start making moves and gamble on a young QB instead of bringing in vets that don't turn the ball over.  To bring it back to the point of the article, Im super amped to have Hopkins here, but it can be a trap that a lot of coaching staffs seem to fall into."
Texans,3djvqd,Chromebrew,6,Thu Jul 16 22:23:06 2015 UTC,"This. This. This.   There's plenty of research out there showing that huge contracts for superstar players are absolute anchors that sink teams.   I love Nuk,  love watching him develop,  think he's a fantastic player,  but I really hope we don't throw huge money at him. If he walks,  he walks. Especially considering that WR are coming out of the draft more pro ready than ever so you can get decent production from guys on a rookie contact."

Nuk has put in work and if he continues growing at the rate that he has, I wouldn't mind giving him money. I'd be heartbroken if he left us, but I also don't want him to end up resenting us like he who will not be named. :("

All that's going on right now is baseball and ESPN needed to fill air space AND get people talking about them. So they give out a few controversial awards to make sure people tune in.

Texans,3ddyqv,Logorrhea_,6,Wed Jul 15 15:00:20 2015 UTC,My picks for 1-10.  10 - Clowney - needs to come in and not play like a rookie coming off an injury.  9 Hopkins - WRs always get a lot of attention but in the history of superbowl winners you do not need the best one in the league  8 - Crennel - Below ST coach because he has all the weapons just needs to direct them properly  7 Special Teams Coach - need better plays  6 Raheem Moore - All of our safeties are gone. He will have to step in seamlessly so we don't take a huge step back  5 Cushing - much like Arian our defense is on another level when cush is healthy especially versus run  4 JJ - god  3 Foster. We are a completely different team when he is healthy and firing on all cylinders  2 BoB - I am pretty certain BoB will be one of the best coaches in the league for the next decade. But I'm also blinded by kool-aid and a one season sample size.  1 QB1 Hoyer or Mallet will need to have an above average season for us to have any success.

I had very split feeling on the extension too,  but there is one piece of information about him that helps put my mind at ease.    He's only 24. He was drafted at 20 as a DE and converted to OLB and is now on his second defensive system. Even though his play has not been stellar, he's preserved through a lot and I think there's every reason to believe that he will continue to develop over the next few years."

Barring a 1983 or 2012-like draft, we aren't getting a QB in the first without sacrificing WAY too much.  I think a 2013 situation, where there were a handful of 2nd-4th round QB talent, is where we would go for it.    Personally, I think Savage is developing very nicely, and could be ready to start in 2017."
Texans,3dfrd1,kckolbe,3,Thu Jul 16 01:42:24 2015 UTC,What makes you think that Savage is developing nicely? I'd be elated to see that happen.
Texans,3dfrd1,Maxmoxie,2,Thu Jul 16 05:06:34 2015 UTC,"Just some of the comments from the OTA coverage.  He does very well in timed situation drills, which tells me that he has the tools and the decision-making, but not the habits and/or focus.  That is something that can definitely come around with practice."

Texans,3dfrd1,illegal_deagle,2,Thu Jul 16 18:21:50 2015 UTC,"I think it's too hard to say for sure.  But I think the Texans are going about it in the right way.  Especially with BOB being a new HC.    Lets talk about what's available.  Unless the Seahawks do something stupid, young and talented QBs who have proven they can run a pro offense effectively are just nearly impossible to come by.  So you look to your draft.  It's disastrous to go after QBs in the first round year after year just because you don't have an answer.    So then what do you do?  I believe that even though the position is the most important on the field, you treat it like it's the same as any other.  Do you have a warm body who resembles a pro athlete?  Then it's not a 1st round priority. You draft like it's any other position.  You can certainly cash in when a BPA situation comes up but you're not just drafting the highest prospect QB on your board as early as you can.  Which I feel is the reason we didn't go after Bortles/Carr/Bridgewater/Manziel etc.  As a new HC, your future can easily become tied to a first round QB which adds extra pressure.  So just try to mitigate any negatives at the position as best you can and then see to the rest of the team as usual.    You sign a smart experienced QB to run your first year offense. You try out unproven back ups. You bring in vets that have shown flashes of ability to give them a second chance. You draft mid round project QBs.    The QB position is just incredibly difficult at the NFL level and so predicting who can excel at it is nearly impossible unless the prospect is Andrew Luck.    Just don't mortgage your future on the position.  Maybe we hit on one of those possibilities along the way but I think you keep at it until you find one.  I hope that's more sooner than later."
Texans,3dfrd1,LdZppln,2,Wed Jul 15 23:50:21 2015 UTC,"Much concur,  so agreed.   Don't mortgage the future and do look for low risk opportunities like back ups and mid round picks. Aside from Luck,  even first round picks are a gamble and I think trying to plug and play with those guys just increases the chance of failure.    Keep someone serviceable on the field and an active pipeline of low risk project QB's in the works.  Fact is,  elite QB's are harder and harder to come by and it's just sort of a waiting game."
Texans,3dfrd1,Logorrhea_,2,Thu Jul 16 17:50:57 2015 UTC,"Tom Savage is our QB of the future. I don't have any hesitation in saying that. He has a great QB coach and head coach to guide him, he's got the physical tools to be successful, and he's getting invaluable time to settle in here and build his confidence.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if he gets a few starts this year if Hoyer and Mallett don't work out."
Texans,3dfrd1,dseals,14,Wed Jul 15 23:05:56 2015 UTC,"More than anything, I want our QB to be named Savage."

Texans,3dfrd1,dseals,5,Wed Jul 15 23:19:14 2015 UTC,Can you go more in depth why you think it's gonna be savage in the future?
Texans,3dfrd1,SherlockBrolmes7,4,Thu Jul 16 03:22:29 2015 UTC,"I wrote this article about his game in against Indy. http://nflbreakdowns.com/tom-savage-vs-indianapolis/  I you don't want to read all that here are my final thoughts on his play:   Tom Savage suffered from his lack of playbook knowledge in this game against the Colts. He had several incorrect protection calls and a few miscommunications with his receivers. With that said, I still see a lot of potential in Savage. His footwork is much better than it was in college, though it’s still inconsistent at times. Savage will still set his feet too early on occasion and make poor throws. However, he’s displaying lighter feet and a more consistent rhythm with his footwork. He also improved on his reads. He’s watching the safeties now and adjusting his throws to them. He’s also improved his internal clock and tries to get rid of the ball much more quickly now. In college he earned the reputation for his pocket presence because he simply held on to the ball too long. Now he’s not only standing in the pocket and delivering, but he’s making quicker decisions and smarter ones at that.  Where Savage still needs to improve is his field awareness. He seems to get tunnel vision towards one side of the field and needs to have better full field awareness. He also needs to stop staring down his first read and freeze the safeties more often. I blame this problem mostly on Savage simply not knowing the playbook well enough to anticipate who would get open. However, he had the same problem in college so it could still be a lingering problem. Savage also needs to get better at progressing through his reads. He simply doesn’t look around enough. This goes back to my tunnel vision comment, he gets so fixated on one side of the field, or even one particular receiver, that he blinds himself to the rest of the play.  Overall, I think Savage is on the right track. He’s far better than most people will give him credit for. His time under Bill O’Brien is doing him a lot of good, and should continue to help him grow as a player. As for his competition with Hoyer and Mallett, I don’t think Savage is ready to win a QB battle just yet. As a 3rd string QB, there are certainly worse options to have, and as a backup he’s a decent replacement. If given some more time to actually learn the playbook and develop some chemistry with his receivers I could see Savage competing for a team’s starting spot in 2016.   And to just sum up all my thoughts on him even further:  Great pocket presence  Good footwork  Strong arm  Good touch  Decently mobile  Is learning how to read defenses  Is getting better at not staring down his receivers  Should show much more improvement once he actually knows the playbook and can make better protection calls"
Texans,3dfrd1,dseals,2,Thu Jul 16 03:37:04 2015 UTC,I agree with this. I believe in savage!

Can Brown play a full season?  How much play time will McKinney receive? And of course, can Cushing stay healthy."
Texans,3ddrzm,Quadrophenic,6,Wed Jul 15 15:22:34 2015 UTC,"I'm really excited about those as well. I think McKinney is a day 1 starter in base D sets as well as running downs. Texans have been getting trashed up the middle with runs the last two years. From everything I have read it says Cushing looks like himself again finally so that's exciting. One thing I don't think is getting enough love is the signing of Moore. The Texans finally have a true centerfield safety, I believe he will pay big dividends from day one."

Texans,3ddvlv,Lincoln_Hawk,2,Thu Jul 16 03:48:38 2015 UTC,"Are you re-registering every year? If you do not re-register yourself prior to the deadline you will be dropped from the waiting list thereby losing your place in line. After you re-register you will be moved up in line. You should be getting a newsletter with your place number on it.  http://files.clickdimensions.com/houstontexanscom-a6kpy/documents/waitlist/ht2015wlguidlines3.1.pdf  Also, though it may be too late this year, you can call the ticketing department around the time of renewals and if they have seats available at that moment they will sell it to you. They use the waiting list as a marketing list to cold call and make sales. But if someone calls them when they have tickets, they will not refuse selling them to you in order to randomly call someone on the list who a lot of times does not make a purchase. I heard this from someone who use to work for the Texans ticketing department. I was on the list and was called but all they offered was some really expensive seats that had the churassco club. I told him I was only interested in the top section. I kept following up with him after I turned him down. He called me back a few days later with seats in the area I wanted. He did not have some protocol where he had to go down the list after me, he knew he could sell these specific seats quickly to me. My point is there is no rule that the tickets have to be sold specific to that waiting list, it's just a marketing tool to assist in selling tickets.    If you are serious about getting tickets I would make a contact in the ticketing department and keep bugging that person about the section or area you want. I guarantee you that when those seats come up, he will call you first as their job is to move these seats as quickly as possible. This could save you waiting 4 years for a phone call. It's been some years since I was in the market for purchasing tickets but I bet this will still hold true today."

Sure it needs to be shored up, but getting on the move and stretching the field on Off, and stopping the long plays on Def are the real areas we need to focus on if we want to get somewhere."

Texans,3d9ayi,oh-propagandhi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:58:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it's certainly weighted. If you were a total flop on all things ST, it would screw your team, but there are no ""super bad ass"" special teams out there. So knowing we have a good punter and a good Field Goal kicker makes me think we're actually pretty good.  Edit, that wasn't a very good answer. Just additional ranting."
Texans,3d9ayi,Logorrhea_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:22:36 2015 UTC,"I had the same reaction too, that it sounded high. But after thinking about it for a minute it sounds more reasonable.   Of course, take into consideration that ST does include FGs and extra points, the former of which can have a pretty big impact on games. This is especially relevent if a team is poor in the red zone.  To boot (pun intended), a team's place kicker is usually their highest scoring player.   STs plays a big part in dictating the field position battle throughout the game can occasionally lead to a kick returned for a TD.   On top of all those things, it helped me to state the percentage a different way. Offense and defense still account for 43.5% of the game impact respectively. I could see ST taking up a measly 6.5% from either side of the ball."

Brandon Brooks is locked in at RG, I think LG should be XSF and I'm happy with that as long as he plays like he did at the end, just C looks a bit shaky until we know what Jones does regularly at C"
Texans,3dawy8,DSmith96,3,Tue Jul 14 22:10:10 2015 UTC,Dre fumbled at critical moments and gave up on plays too often last season. I don't think it will be that hard to replace the production of a 34 y.o. WR in a run first offense.
Texans,3dawy8,bootycallSAUL,3,Tue Jul 14 22:11:17 2015 UTC,"Defense:  DL: Buy  We lost Powe and Pickett and gained Wilfork and a (hopefully) motivated and healthy Louis Nix in his second year. Add in the underrated Crick and nice rotation from Pagan and promising rookie Covington, I think we'll pack a punch. Oh yeah and there's that JJ guy or whatever.  OLB: Hold  We lost Brooks Reed, our SAM, which will hurt more than I think people think. Not a great pass rusher, but man could he set the edge. Our replacement comes in moving Mercilus to SAM. Seeing how Mercilus handles the transition and if he finally comes into his own will be crucial. Clowney is also an unknown. Reports are positive about his recovering, but microfractures are no joke. I feel an organization pretty much has to be optimistic in their reports given he was taken #1 overall. I'll believe it when I see it; color me skeptical. Our rotation is decent, but how these two perform will dictate where we stand.  ILB: Buy  No major losses, but we gain a healthier Cushing and drafted a thumper in McKinney to go next to him on early downs (think Brandon Spikes). Mike Mohamed has been incredible in coverage, so he will come in during obvious passing situations. Couple that with alright but not astounding depth and you have me optimistic here.  Corner: Buy  No losses. Re-signed both JJo and KJax who have been an underrated tandem for years. Spent our 1st round pick on Kevin Johnson to groom for JJo's eventual departure and to play nickel. And all of our underrated depth returns in Rolle, Bouye, and Morris with another year under their belt (minus Andre Hal with his move to safety). If Johnson pans out, this may be our strongest group.  Safety: Sell  Major losses in Kendrick Lewis, Danieal Manning, and DJ Swearinger. Replacements in the form of Rahim Moore, Stevie Brown, and (suspected) Reshard Cliett. Danieal Manning retired, and while he had lost a major step, he was vastly underrated last year. Similarly, Kendrick Lewis had a career year with us on a one year deal. We tried to bring him back, but he left for Baltimore. DJ Swearinger's absence won't really be missed aside from his turnovers. Dude could strip the ball, but in most scenarios when he missed the strip, he also missed the tackle. Liability in coverage and in the locker room. Our safety position depends on how all the new faces do. I have faith in Moore, but not so much everyone else. Stevie Brown is a couple years removed from a decent year. Cliett is listed as an OLB, but is suspected to take the Swearinger role (we ran a lot of 3 safeties last year with Lewis and Manning up top and Swearinger as a hybrid OLB/S). My worry with him is he's a rookie. Andre Hal's transition to safety could smooth things over if he's able to improve his tackling. He wasn't physically able to keep up at CB, so hopefully the transition masks his physical limitations. Some depth in Pleasant and the very raw Ballentine leave some to be desired. This group could prove me wrong, but I'm pessimistic.  Defense Conclusion: It's hard not to be super optimistic. I forced myself to put safeties as a sell so I didn't come off as an overly biased fan with my homer goggles on. They and our OLBs are the current weak links in a potential top 3 defense."
Texans,3dawy8,geologists,3,Tue Jul 14 21:52:48 2015 UTC,"Offense  QB: Hold  We re-signed Mallett and signed Hoyer. Honestly, everyone here is drunk on kool-aid after Mallett's game against the Browns last year. He had a great game, tore his pec, then tried to play through it the following game and looked terrible. One good game is not enough to go off of. We are optimistic about him, but can't know until he plays more than a game. Hoyer I believe is underrated by some. He started his season great last year until the Browns lost Alex Mack and lost defense depth, forcing him to do more. He also tried to force it to Josh Gordon when he came back. I think in BoB's system, Hoyer could stand out. Everyone is rooting for Mallett to win the job (myself included), but if Hoyer plays better in camp, I say give it to him. Tom Savage, meanwhile, gets another year to develop. He looked promising in the few snaps he did take. We just can't know about the group until the season starts though, so hold.  RB: Buy  This could be a hold, but with reports of Foster feeling the healthiest he's been since he started in the NFL, it has me optimistic. Alfred Blue is also trying to prove something this year. I also feel Chris Polk is underrated. Those are my 3 to make the roster. Grimes may sneak in for special teams. I doubt rookie Kenny Hilliard makes the roster. Someone not talked about much in RBs though is Keith Mumphery, a rookie listed as WR. While as a prospect, he was unexciting and not quite there physically, it's been rumored he will play the Shane Vereen role for us. Camp reports about him have been phenomenal. If the rumor and the reports are true, expect him to have an early impact.  FB: Buy  FULLBACKS ARE PEOPLE TOO!! No changes, but Jay Prosch will have another year under his belt. He blocked like a champ and can hopefully improve further.  WR: Sell  We lost Andre, obviously. I think reports of his decline have been overstated in this sub as a result of being hurt he left us for Indy. I'm not a fan of how we treated him in the end, but I'm also not a fan of him going straight to Indy. I'm trying to just look past it. Hopkins is awesome. One of the few first rounders of 2013 that worked out well for any team. Can't complain at all. Everyone past him scares me though. Washington I think can be a competent #2. Very underrated route running. Shorts has potential as well, if he can stay healthy. I'm not as hyped about rookie Jaelen Strong as most are. He came to rookie minicamp out of shape. He couldn't finish workouts. He got beat by UDFA's corners in on a tryout only basis. Not a great start. Maybe in a couple years he'll come into his own. Hopefully he proves me wrong. After them, it's all rookies and underperformers. You know it's bad when people are cheering for someone not to make the roster (Keshawn Martin) but reports are that he's ahead of some rookies and fan favorites. I think we'll make it work, but I'm not about to speak glowingly of anyone in this unit aside from Hopkins.  TE: Hold/Sell  Borderline sell. No additions. No subtractions. CJ Fiedorowicz has yet to show he can do anything other than block, despite everyone's hopes that he develops as a pass catcher. Graham had a down year in BoB's new system. Griffin as well. Our TE's were invisible last year and haven't done anything to instill confidence in the next year. I personally wouldn't mind spending a relatively high draft pick on a TE in the near future if there aren't any major improvements this year.  LT: Buy  Duane Brown, motherfucker. Expect him to continue to be one of the game's top LTs.  LG: Hold/Buy  2nd year Xavier Sua'Filo has a lot of optimism around him. I think he'll work out great, but we need to see how he does this year to know for sure.  C: Sell/Hold  We lost Chris Meyers, an anchor on our Oline for years. That sucks a lot. Ben Jones, our LG last season, will move to center, his natural position. If he can perform, great. But nothing will replace Meyers' iron man consistency we've lost this year.  RG: Buy  Brandon Brooks was PFF's secret superstar for the 2014 season on our team, and he lived up to it. One of the game's better RGs, though no one knows who he is. He should be even better this year. Buy buy buy.  RT: Hold/buy  Derek Newton was terrible his first three years. His nickname was the Hologram, and for good reason. Last year, a contract year, he came in healthier and more refined (he was a raw 7th round pick). PFF rated him a top 10 RT in the league. We re-signed him this offseason. If last year was not a fluke this is a buy.  Offense Conclusion: How our offense does is about 80% on our QBs. Our run game was great last year, but we won't ever be a whole offense until we get a QB who can run it."
Texans,3dawy8,geologists,3,Tue Jul 14 22:17:43 2015 UTC,"Special Teams  K: Hold  Randy had a shit rookie season but came on much stronger his second year. If he can continue what he started his second year and make some improvements to short yard consistency, he'll be great.  P: Hold  Lechler has started to show some signs of age. He will still place the ball very well and keep the opposing returner from taking advantage, but he had way more touchbacks last year than he should've.  KR/PR: SELL  HAHAHAHA who the fuck is even doing that this year? We were terrible last year and I'm not optimistic.  LS: BUY  Oh yeah.  Special Teams Conclusion: K and P are alright. Coverage is alright. KR and PR is a fucking joke. REALLY need to improve special teams all around this year."

Also, Savage gets even more time to develop and improve on the promise he showed last year, while we added Hoyer which seems like an improvement over Fitz. I loved Fitz last year, but I think Hoyer will be more like his start of season self here than end of season  RB - BUY  Foster feels even better than last year, with more backs to take the load off of him(Polk, Hillard). Blue gets another year, works on his bowling ball vision with Foster, Grimes is kicked for Hillard or Polk, both of which should be vying for that last RB spot, potentially both staying, as we started last year with 4 backs.  WR - HOLD  I know we lost Dre, but he is 34 years old. He's not happy with us, hurting the locker room, not going all for the ball, cost critical fumbles, safe to say, he just wasn't the same. Not that i don't think it will be a big loss, or that he wasn't good anymore, just that he wasn't in it for us anymore. Nate has apparently looked GREAT in OTAs, especially with Mallett. Strong looked good when he wasn't dead tired. Whip him into NFL shape and you've got yourself a first round prospect. Cecil was the Jags' 1 for a few years when healthy, and he wasn't bad when he was healthy either. Travis Labhart has looked good competing for that last spot, and Kieth Mumphrey was one of the best players in all of OTAs! Plus Keshaywn  Martin has actually looked good! Uzoma Nwachukwu has looked like a viable depth guy too, and Hop is Hop.  TE - BUY  Everyone gets another year in the system that is apparently hardest on QBs and TEs. OTA news says that the TEs have picked it up, whih gives me hope.  LT- BUY  Duane had a bit of a down year last year adjusting to the new system, and should pick it up again even after getting one year older. Nearly a hold, but close call.  LG - HOLD  I think Xavier Su'a Filo will be an improvement, especially with the end to his season. BUT, I need more information, so according to the rules, this is a hold  C - HOLD  We lost Chris Meyers, which will hurt, but I don't know how good Ben Jones is at center. If he is a little better than guard, he'll be a buy, as Chris sadly had a really down year last year, while Ben has been right around average.  RG - BUY  Brandon Brooks, one of the best in the league, gets another year, entering his fourth in the league, and second in the system. That should spell a major improvement to a lock top 3-5 guard, if he isn't already.  RT - HOLD  I need to see if Derek Newton had some contrct year magic, or if that was the real him. If it was the first, than this is a sell. If it was the second, it will absolutely be a buy, with another season.  EDIT: OLINE DEPTH - HOLD  I have no clue on this one sorry. We dumped Clabo, but picked a few guys, DQ might be back. I got no clue here outside of the basics.  DEFENCE  NT - BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY  NO MORE JERRELL POWE. Honestly the worst starting DT in the NFL last year. Utterly horrid. Ryan Pickett is going to be well missed though, he had a great year last year coming up off his couch. Honestly though, I think most players could replicate this, mostly everyone NOT NAMED JERRELL POWE. Makes him look EVEN WORSE if that’s possible. Now we get Vince Wilfork, an offseason of learning the system, and Nix back, healthy and seemingly motivated, plus Christan Covington as a DE/DT hybrid I think. He was hyped as a first rounder before his injury last year, to provide some context.  DE - BUY  Jared Crick seemed like an upgrade to Tim Jamison at the end of the year last year. That plus more experience and a shiny new Vince Wilfork to look up to, and he should take a major step forward. He has Jeoffery Pagan backing him up, which should make for a good rotation. JJ Watt is JJ Watt. Christan Covington should provide for good rotation here as well.  OLB - BUY  Two words. Jadeveon. Clowney. We missed him nearly all of last year, and he should play for the majority of the season this year. No, he is not a bust. He should be the same dominant force as he was before the injury, even with having such a serious surgery. Because his was EXTREMELY minor compared to other people getting this surgery. Plus we used ground breaking techniques with him that set him up for even more success than any others. He will make a major contribution this year. We have good depth in John Simon and Lynden Trail. Plus Whitney has been very good at stopping the run during his career, and should take over very well for Brooks Reed, and the coaches are clearly confident in him with his new contract, even if he hasn’t lived up to his draft standards.  ILB - BUY  Cushing is healthier than last year by a long shot, and we got a very good two down thumper to rotate with Mike Muhumad, who can gradually take over coverage, as he has looked much better than expected when trying to cover. We basically have the same depth as last year, which isn’t bad.  CB - BUY  Jonathan Joseph is a year older, which will hurt, but he was still a top 20 CB last year, and that trend should continue. Kareem is more experienced, and was top 10 or top 15 last year. We have 3 very young nickel guys in AJ Bouye, Darryl Morris, and Jumal Rolle, with all looking really good in limited time last year. They should progress with a new year. Also, if Andre Hal’s transition to safety doesn’t work, he should be in better NFL shape this year, and he has the technique ready to be a huge impact with more athleticism. Oh yea, that Kevin Johnson guy. Yea, the one that needs to add more weight or the run game, but has great speed and technique. He should make a huge impact this year as well. If I divided this into Nickel and Outside, nickel would get buy, and ouside sell, but overall I see more improvement than not.  S - HOLD  Rahim Moore is an upgrade over Kendrick Lewis. Lewis was good, but didn’t have enough speed to be a deep safety, but would have great with a safety over top of him. DJ sucked in coverage, and seemed to have a bad attitude. I’ll miss him, but we’ll probably be better with Reshard Cleitt who was picked this year. He should serve the same purpose, but with more versatility, a key feature O’Brien wants. Steve Brown was good then tore something in his leg and had a bad year after that. He was cut by the Giants and might be our starter as a deep safety. Lonnie Ballentine is a freak. But he is the most raw player on the planet. So in a few years, he’ll be great! This year’ll be a different story though. Andre Hal has a good chance as a higher safety backup and a lower CB backup. He should transition like Glover Quinn. Kinda.  SPECIAL TEAMS  K - BUY  Randy Bolluck gets another year to blossom, kicks should be lasers now.  P - HOLD  Shane is a god, but an old one. Might go down a bit, I think we still have 2 or 3 years before anything major, since he is a punter. But we could be in serious trouble.  KR/PR - HOLD  I think we might get better with pickups this offseason and more time, but I’ve got no clue really. IM’m just holding out hope at this point.  LS - WHO CARES????????  Same guy I think.  COVERAGE - BUY  We drafted players with abilities here that should help fix it.  COACHING  Because why not?  Oline coach is better, ours was abysmal last year.  Godsey title change  Miss anything?"
Texans,3db4jw,AngryhamLincoln,3,Tue Jul 14 22:17:16 2015 UTC,Duane Brown  Clowney  Cushing  Foster (QB/RB)  Hopkins  Watt  Wilfork (backup QB)
Texans,3db4jw,hogfart,2,Tue Jul 14 22:37:36 2015 UTC,"No injuries.   Usually you have 3 lineman, a running back, a QB and two wideouts. Sometimes you go three wide, and sometimes bring a wideout in as fullback.  On D, you typically have 2 CBs, 3 lineman, a LB, and a S. You can mess with the formation a bit, getting 2 S blitzes, two over the top, 2 corner blitzes, D is pretty up in the air, but the above is the base formation"
Texans,3db4jw,Random908,2,Wed Jul 15 01:33:36 2015 UTC,"Cecil Shorts (WR-CB): Faster than almost anybody else on the field, plus there aren't any injuries  Darryl Morris (WR-CB): Faster than almost anybody else on the field  Arian Foster (Wildcat QB-LB): Has ability to throw, and is basically a RB  Deandre Hopkins (WR-S): Fast plus great catcher for Arian  JJ Watt (DE(EDGE)-T): Based Watt  Vince Wilfork (DE-C): Big body, great on the line, Knows D moves  Duane Brown (T-DT)- Great blocker, finishes dominant Offence, Big body to push around that can probably anchor himself well in the middle  GAMEPLAN  Arian obliterates the QB blast play, when he does pass, his line is great, so just send Cecil, Hop, and Morris deep on streaks or a PA, and watch as they outrun opponents. On D, just drop Morris and Cecil in man coverage with Hop over top. Rush Arian opposite JJ's side to try and send one guy free. Let JJ and Big Vince do their thing, and the QB stands no chance."
Texans,3db4jw,Random908,2,Wed Jul 15 01:29:02 2015 UTC,"I'd go with Watt, Wilfork, and Brown for my linemen. Cushing because he's an animal. Justin Tuggle because he was a QB in college and can play linebacker now. Finally I'd get JJo and Hop to be WRs/DBs.  I'd have Watt and Brown as my tackles with Wilfork playing center and Tuggle at QB. With Cush in the backfield we'd run plenty of option plays and the occasional throw it up to Hop play while JJo burns everyone.  Defensively just blitz Cushing on every down and hope someone gets a sack."

Texans,3d4bqa,SCREW-IT,29,Mon Jul 13 12:26:11 2015 UTC,"Jan. 7, 2012.   The father of two of my good friends had just passed away from cancer and it was the day of his funeral. Every single one of us are die hard Texans fans and had been hyped for the playoffs, but we all kind of agreed that #1 in priority was being there for our friends. So we went to the funeral without even a plan to watch the game - maybe we wouldn't watch at all.   To my surprise, after the funeral the guys were like, ""Let's get out of here, we have a playoff game to watch."" They just buried their dad, but were still down to watch the game. I think they needed it, and they knew we all could use the mood boost. So we went to someone's house and watched it on the projector in the media room.   There was no way to completely shake off the downer of the day. Hell, we were still wearing black suits, although some of us had our jerseys on over them. As much fun as playoff football is, it was still a dark day.   Until this. When JJ got that pick-six, we all lost our shit. Hugging, yelling, jumping around. For just a minute, those guys got relief. One of those moments you don't forget. We could go on to win the Super Bowl one of these days, but I don't think even then it would top that moment."
Texans,3d4bqa,illegal_deagle,13,Mon Jul 13 13:18:41 2015 UTC,That's the kind of story that JJ loves. you should tweet it to him. Maybe you can get something for the 2 sons.

Texans,3d4bqa,kckolbe,3,Mon Jul 13 17:14:14 2015 UTC,"He's mad raw. Like super duper raw.  ""Pedals tall and does not play to timed speed. Has a bit of a track mentality. Cautious running alley. Not a strong, face-up, wrap tackler. Does not trigger quickly vs. the run and is late to see plays developing. Average processing speed. Gives up too much separation in transition and is not quick out of his pedal. Shaky hands -- not a natural catcher and will mistime jumps. Marginal career production on the ball.""  Seems like he needs some good coaching. If we can make Kendrick Lewis look good, I think we can mold this dude"
Texans,3d4bqa,Wham_Bam_Smash,2,Mon Jul 13 17:20:55 2015 UTC,"Wow, definitely enough problems to make teams wary.  Being weak against the run might not be much of an issue, though, given our improved run defense.  I can see his game speed and tackling improving, but most of his problems seem tied to lack of instinct, which is only slightly more coachable than height."
Texans,3d4bqa,kckolbe,4,Mon Jul 13 17:25:36 2015 UTC,"Apparently he is new playing free safety too.   Pros:  ""Exceptional size, length and closing speed. Can get over the top and leverage the field. Plays with emotion. Superb pro day workout, posting some sub-4.4-second 40 times and a 38-inch vertical jump. Flashes straight-line striking ability when he has a clean angle""  He's a project for sure, but apparently has an impeccable work ethic too. I like our staff. I think we can do something with him."
Texans,3d4bqa,Wham_Bam_Smash,3,Mon Jul 13 17:27:47 2015 UTC,"Really appreciate this.  He's definitely worth watching based on all of this, and fits BoB's philosophy physically and emotionally, as well as our biggest needs at that position (over the top).  However, all of his flaws point to someone who has to think about what he is about to do on the field, which isn't really viable at this level."
Texans,3d4bqa,kckolbe,5,Mon Jul 13 17:30:49 2015 UTC,"I think some of that instinct is him getting more time playing safety.  Once he learns the playback and his responsibilities,  the game will then slow down for him and his instincts will take over.    He's a project in every sense of the word,  but has a high potential"

Texans,3d4bqa,Pocketship,5,Mon Jul 13 19:18:55 2015 UTC,"Anyone have any tips on how to budget monthly expenses while on a biweekly pay schedule? I have bills due on the 1st, 5th, 15th, 20th, and 26th, but because of the 2 week cycle, these bills don't always group together consistently and it's really annoying when I get paid on the 24th and won't get paid again until the 7th"
Texans,3d4bqa,rab7,5,Mon Jul 13 13:33:49 2015 UTC,"I had a similar problem and I fixed it in two ways.  The first was contacting a few of the companies to move my billing due dates.  ATT and Reliant did this for me no problem.  They'll send you a pro-rated bill for the adjustment period so that your billing cycle is still 30 days.  Just watch the charges.  ATT billed me for all of the standard monthly fees and such on both my regular monthly bill and the prorated one....basically double dipping on me.  They refunded it as soon as I mentioned it so just watch for it.    The second was getting ahead my own bills.  I got the YNAB budget software and over the course of 4 months I saved enough to be a month ahead of everything that rolls in.  Now I pay my bills with last months income and I don't have to worry about timing at all.  Most any budget software will do but you need one that gives every dollar job as soon as it comes in....the popular ""envelope"" method.  The point is that you need to be forecasting your budget, not reacting to it.   It's hard to make changes in your spending when you just look at your budget at the end of the month.  It's hard to see where you went wrong.  This method allows you to see it as it's happening."
Texans,3d4bqa,LdZppln,3,Mon Jul 13 13:56:29 2015 UTC,Best advice.  I recently switched to a 1st and 15th payment schedule with my new job and did the same stuff switching my payment dates.  Some companies like Chase let you do it right from their webpage with no hassle.   And +1 for YNAB.  That thing helped me dig my way out of a ton of debt.
Texans,3d4bqa,da1hobo,3,Mon Jul 13 15:00:28 2015 UTC,"Here's what I do:  Equally separate my bills into 2 groups. Try to group them by time and money value if you can, but money is more important.  Every 2 weeks pay off one of those 2 groups of bills. When you catch up to a full 4 weeks ahead of a bill (because you're paying every 4 weeks instead of every month), throw that money against a CC, savings, etc."

Best defensive player in the league but it's because he racks up stats in a weak division.    The only player to ever have 20+ sacks in two seasons but it's because he chooses his alignment and takes advantage of weaker players.  ""He doesn't even play 3-4 DE"" LOL  Is the epitome quality work ethic but he's a try-hard douche for advertising that nobody works harder than he does.    Projects an easy going attitude off the field and does a lot for charity but that's just a crafted image to cover his huge ego.    Just realize that when people hate us, sometimes it actually is because they anus.  You're a silly person if you don't want JJ on your team and you're even sillier if your response to that is you'd ""rather have a QB."""

With Clowney and Wilfork on the line this year hopefully we can get into the top 5 again, but in case anyone forgot JJ really is that dominant."
Texans,3d1a2x,DrMantisToboggan-MD,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:03:35 2015 UTC,"This is kinda troubling. We really need Clowney to recover from his injury and play up to his billing. As amazing a talent as he is, we need another pass rusher to help the defense out and to neutralize Luck, who will probably be even better this year. If that happens, and if our secondary improves as we hope it would with Kevin Johnson and Rahim Moore, the Texans will have one of the best defenses in the league."
Texans,3d1a2x,effortlessgrace,7,Tue Jul 14 19:35:21 2015 UTC,"As far as the proportion, I think it's more JJ is sofuckinggood. Hence the first player to reach 2 20+ sack seasons, within these past 3 years."
Texans,3d1a2x,roogug,7,Sun Jul 12 21:54:48 2015 UTC,Super Stat Sunday should be a thing with us  that's impressive jj is almost 50% of the sacks
Texans,3d1a2x,electricalenginerd,5,Sun Jul 12 18:41:11 2015 UTC,"Copied from another thread:   Various sources have noted that JJ doesn't necessarily elevate the play of those around him. Because he has a green light to be a human highlight reel, it's even more important that the players around him (specifically DLine and LBs) execute their responsibilities strictly. So its kind of like either JJ gets the sack or no one does, cause as he's freestylin' and comin' through like a wild man everyone else needs to stay home.  That said, I agree that his play elevates the entire defense because the sheer amount of disruption he causes has to benefit everyone, especially the secondary.   I think we could see a more versatile look for our D this year with JD becoming a factor, Crick another year improved, a reliable NT in Big Vince, and improved coverage in the secondary that should give our pass rushers an extra second or two to get to the QB."
Texans,3d1a2x,Logorrhea_,4,Sun Jul 12 19:38:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm pretty sure they play JJ like that because the other guys around him are more bench player level or barely starters (other than Cushing when he's healthy). He kind of HAS to do that or else no one would cause any disruption. Now we've at least got a healthy Cushing and Wilfork in the mix. If Clowney comes back strong and, like you said Crick improves, this won't be necessary anymore."
Texans,3d1a2x,edwardsamson,3,Sun Jul 12 21:53:46 2015 UTC,"I think that's part of it, but I really think JJ being able to write his own ticket every play is the key to understanding this stat. Granted, in 2014, we didn't have anyone else that could mount a serious pass rush. Even if we did, I'm guessing 9 out of 10 plays their assignment would still be to stay home and let JJ do his thing.  I'm with you about the mix for next year though. From what I understand, RAC likes to generate pressure up front. I can't wait to see how he uses JD, VW, and Cush.... especially in concert with what should be a very formidable secondary.   With any luck, RIP opponent's backfield. Now we just need our offense to still average 23 ppg and we should be in decent shape."
Texans,3d1a2x,Logorrhea_,5,Mon Jul 13 00:06:53 2015 UTC,I'm really excited to see how Crick looks this year. He was the other guy I felt like I always had to watch to make a break through the line last season.

The statistic of '23-25 wins over a 3 year span' is skewed, because while 2-14 sucked to watch for a year - that record doesn't accurately convey the quality of overall talent on the field.

Texans,3cyvlx,WeirdChi,6,Sun Jul 12 04:10:36 2015 UTC,"The Charlotte Hornets.  The history is similar since their team relocated to New Orleans and Charlotte got a new expansion team - the Bobcats - 2 years later.  Also, the few times they made the playoffs they were one and done."
Texans,3cyvlx,freakybj,3,Sun Jul 12 12:32:52 2015 UTC,"As probably the only Hornets fan on this sub... yeah no. Houston has a much better franchise overall.

Texans,3cyvlx,CockADoodleBOOM,2,Sun Jul 12 15:53:08 2015 UTC,"This makes me think, what would happen if the Texans changed back to the Oilers? New Orleans switched to the Pelicans opening it up for the Bobcats to switch back to the Hornets in Charlotte. So since the Titans are clearly not called the Oilers anymore and haven't been for quite some time, shouldn't we be able to switch back?"
Texans,3cyvlx,edwardsamson,2,Mon Jul 13 01:43:16 2015 UTC,"The Titans still own the Oilers history (and still kind of use their colors). We'd have to legally acquire the rights from them in order to rebrand, or even refer to the Oilers history by putting up, say, a Warren Moon banner up at NRG or something.  That being said, Bud Adams is finally dead. So the chances of the Titans selling or just giving us the rights is probably higher, but I'm not sure how much higher.  Personally I would love going back to the Oilers. We all love the Texans and no Houstonian has any trouble supporting them, but I've talked to a lot of people that agree that the name isn't that cool or distinctive to Houston. That, and the color scheme is kinda generic, especially compared to the love ya blues."

I'd much rather that instead of just being in a position where we ""might"" have a chance to even make the playoffs year to year and don't even know what the real situation is with the most important position on the field.  There is literally no single player I wouldn't give up for the best QB in the league, and throwing in the first rounder doesn't really hurt my feelings too much either - Rodgers would more than make up for the loss of that pick.  Don't get me wrong, JJ is a fucking beast and a phenom and might be my favorite Texan right now - but I would rather win than fanboy over him or any other player."

I think a football generation is generally somewhere more like 10-15 years rather than 25 as you say for a standard generation. I like to think of it like this - This year, 2015, there will be very few players still in the league that were playing in 2005... and if you go back to 2000 that drops off even more.  The general consensus when Luck was drafted was that he was the best prospect since the Manning draft as far as ""sure things"". I think that, subjectively, he has the ability to be better than Manning over the course of his career and could potentially be an all time great. I just think he is that good.  Those guys don't just come along."
Texans,3cyk9x,Jardun,3,Mon Jul 13 19:52:58 2015 UTC,Hellz no.  JJ Watt is gonna lead us to a super bowl as predicted by this guy (insert draft day fan video).   Aaron Rodgers is going to start losing some zing in a couple of years. Can't we just start hiring away green bay's QB coaches / farm?
Texans,3cyk9x,fred_yall,5,Sun Jul 12 08:13:47 2015 UTC,Yes and it's not even a question.
Texans,3cyk9x,swiftwings88,2,Sun Jul 12 01:14:02 2015 UTC,Abso-fuckin-lutely.  Rodgers turns em into instant Super Bowl contenders.
Texans,3cyk9x,BallFaceMcDickButt,3,Sun Jul 12 01:16:16 2015 UTC,Look I love me some JJ.. But if that trade came.. JJ would be on the first plane out of Houston.

I love JJ as much as the next guy, but you can never pass up on a surefire QB and there isn't anyone else you would want then either Rodgers or Luck.  Those are the only 2 I would even consider doing that kind of trade on."

He'll even score on his own or almost single handedly get the ball back for the offense. Rodgers gets hurt every year, great as he is.  Defense wins championships and Watt is still peaking!!"
Texans,3cyk9x,fuk-dee-say,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:55:00 2015 UTC,"Obv I'd be a terrible GM, but I don't think I would.  I think a JJ Watt is more rare than an Aaron Rodgers.  While QB is more important as a position than DE for winningness, I think our odds of finding another DE like Watt are significantly less than finding another QB like Rodgers.  I rather we keep Watt, find our own next rodgers QB through draft, and take all the superbowls."

He left Central Michigan after his freshman year, returned to Pewaukee and trained with Arnett for six months. Watt pushed himself to eat six meals a day, heavy on chicken, greens and protein shakes. He and Arnett worked on acceleration and deceleration, and in the summer of 2008, Watt felt he was physically ready. He had added 20 pounds by the time he left for Madison.

Texans,3cu4oy,electricalenginerd,5,Fri Jul 10 22:09:11 2015 UTC,"Great job! I'll take the chance to comment.  I fucking loved most of your offseason. I really like the FA signings. I think Swearinger did need to go, as his mistakes were just not getting any better, and he seemed to get too emotional. My opinion is already known on how I dislike Andre, so I'm glad he is gone. Wilfork is going to make Watt have an even BETTER season. And you guys retaining Newton will do wonders. Only bad thing is that you guys still did absolutely nothing for the QB situation. I honestly think you guys should've retained Fitzpatrick, or traded for someone like Matt Moore, since I don't see Mallett being the future.   The most important thing though, was your draft. Johnson, McKinney AND Strong? Holy shit. A lot of people were mocking all of them in the 1st round for good reason. I am looking forward to the Hopkins & Strong duo. And with Shorts in the slot? This is going to be a good offense.  Biggest concerns will be safety and quarterback... which can really mess it up for you, but they are mainly question marks and not necessarily ""holes"".  I don't like reading the entire season predictions, and for good reason. You have the Texans going 5-0 from the get-go, and then you have yourselves losing to the Jax' Bortles because ""trap game""? Or also fail to see that turnovers haven't been an issue with Tannehill for well over a year (and your midget safety defense), and how our offense was better than our defense last season. And 11-5 with Mallett with a harder schedule, when you went 9-7 last season with Fitzpatrick, a better QB? :\.   Don't worry. I haven't liked ANY of these. Not even the Dolphins'. I don't understand why this section was included in these series. They tend to be overly homer-ish and nonsensical."
Texans,3cu4oy,Lobo_Marino,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:30:03 2015 UTC,"I don't like predictions either. The Jags always play us tough, and I could definitely see a divisional loss after a big win. Plus how many teams lose to shittier teams? If it happens to us I think this is the game.  We could start 8-0 IMO or 4-4. I think Mallett plays average football and opens up our deep game. Our defense is loaded, and our offensive line is loaded. We should be a threat to everyone.  But all this means shit because it's still the off-season lol"

Texans,3csxqr,MisallocatedRacism,2,Sat Jul 11 02:45:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. It's not often you get the chance to look out for a Texans fan over here in Oakland.   Reminds me of a recent story actually. My wife and I met up with the Traveling Texans group at a bar out here for week 2, AKA the Raiders home opener. After some fine breakfast fare and more than a few bloody marys, bloody beers, and plenty of high fives,  we let ourselves get talked into trying to make it into the game (twist my arm, right?). The distance from the bar to the Coliseum would be about the Museum District to NRG. We head off on our bikes, half drunk and ready to scalp our way in. The scalping went poorly. Very poorly. Tickets that were offered to others at 80 were 160 to us, 100 was 250. With all the merrymaking that morning, we'd forgotten to grab jackets or something to cover our jerseys. I happened to be sporting a battle red Foster jersey; that shit might as well have been a bullseye. Needless to say, trying to scalp tix at the Coliseum as an opposing fan is about enjoyable as being walked to your cell for your first night in a super-max prison....lots of jeering, lots of threats, probably lots of knives and not so many friendly faces.   Anyway, we made it out of the stadium and into another bar by the second quarter and the whole experience made that crazy trip fumble play and the W all that much sweeter.   Also reminds me of meeting our very first Texans fan out here and then going out to watch the Warriors v Rockets series, which was also tough times."

I don't care how many perks the job has or how much it pays if I come home after a work day and consider shooting myself rather than going back tomorrow.    I'm currently looking for a new job right now because of this.  The job pays more than enough for me to live comfortably and I have lots of vacation time and benefits but I'm working 55+ hours a week, have no time to go see friends and family, and the people I work with leave a lot to be desired.  If I'm going to spend 60 hours a week with a group of people I better get along with them."

Texans,3cmv1i,BisonST,3,Thu Jul 9 04:19:57 2015 UTC,Has to be it.
Texans,3cnb7h,Snow-jizz,5,Thu Jul 9 06:06:32 2015 UTC,I wouldn't give up JJ for anyone but a QB and no team would give up their franchise QB for JJ.  At least not a team with a QB that we would want.    Something like a Stafford/Watt trade sounds fairly reasonable but I don't see it happening.
Texans,3cnb7h,LdZppln,3,Thu Jul 9 15:26:57 2015 UTC,Russell Wilson and Bruce Irvin for JJ Watt and Mallett?
Texans,3cnb7h,TwoChe,16,Thu Jul 9 19:41:13 2015 UTC,"There isn't one. He's more valuable than any non QB. He's also more valuable than most QBs, except for a few who's teams would never trade them for a pass rusher."
Texans,3cnb7h,geezergamer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:50:25 2015 UTC,"But you don't trade players, you trade contracts.  I'm fully aware that I'll get massacred for saying this, but I'd trade him for some of the elite Sophomore players.  Specifically, OBJ and Mack are more valuable at their price than JJ is at his.  Yes, JJ's a much better player.  But we're paying for that."
Texans,3cnb7h,Quadrophenic,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:36:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to massacre you. The truth is that until the Texans get a good QB, it's a moot discussion. Are we sure that Watt has hit his prime, btw? He's now being utilized on offense, and that might continue. Can you imagine a season where Watt gets ten TDs and ten sacks?"
Texans,3cnb7h,geezergamer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:09:37 2015 UTC,"But those guys could get better too.  We don't know, so I'm basing this off what I've seen.  And going by what we've seen, I'll take Mack or OBJ at their rookie bargain bin price vs Watt at his."
Texans,3cnb7h,Quadrophenic,2,Fri Jul 10 20:12:09 2015 UTC,"The problem is that for teams to both benefit from a trade, you need some sort of positional asymmetry or there needs to be contract weirdness.  Our D-Line depth after JJ is awful, so that makes him a bad trade candidate for us.  His contract is also about right, which makes it hard to find trades that help both teams."
Texans,3cnb7h,Quadrophenic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:02:40 2015 UTC,"Our D-Line depth isn't that bad. Wilfork, Pagan, Crick, and Nix. Plus Clowney/Mercilus are essentially DE's."
Texans,3cnb7h,Quadrophenic,2,Thu Jul 9 20:35:36 2015 UTC,That's not actually good depth.  Our D-Line minus JJ is like bottom 10.
Texans,3cnb7h,robertturo,3,Thu Jul 9 21:31:45 2015 UTC,"I get that you're trying to come up with a challenge, but I couldn't trade JJ even in a hypothetical imaginary world. There seriously is no other athlete in any sport I'd rather have on my team than JJ Watt."
Texans,3cnb7h,bearwulf,2,Thu Jul 9 13:24:48 2015 UTC,I'd take Andrew Luck.
Texans,3cnb7h,Grilled_Cheeseus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:37:35 2015 UTC,Brady in his prime
Texans,3cnb7h,TonyShadyDee,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:43:05 2015 UTC,Luck for JJ...that is all!
Texans,3cnb7h,kckolbe,4,Thu Jul 9 10:05:12 2015 UTC,"That would suck for us.  Luck is only under contract 1 more year, and after that would need a 5th year option (not sure if traded teams can claim that) and then franchise tag.  Indy would face almost 0 dead money, but we'd eat a TON since JJ is on a new contract."
Texans,3cnb7h,TonyShadyDee,4,Thu Jul 9 12:33:28 2015 UTC,Yea I wasn't looking at the logistics just the benefits.  Should've thought of that first.
Texans,3cnb7h,iammattchambers,2,Thu Jul 9 13:12:19 2015 UTC,Would be sweet to have Luck return to Houston though.
Texans,3cnb7h,twoscoopsofpig,2,Thu Jul 9 14:28:41 2015 UTC,And JJ would murder our shiny new Luck out of spite and we'd be out a QB anyway.
Texans,3cnb7h,kckolbe,6,Thu Jul 9 15:45:57 2015 UTC,"Bill O'Brien walks out on the field, looking over a sprawled out, lifeless QB about 11 yards behind the line of scrimmage.  ""We did not think this trade through, Rick."""

Texans,3cnb7h,Lobo_Marino,2,Thu Jul 9 19:56:41 2015 UTC,"(not sure if traded teams can claim that)   FYI, the tags are contract based, not team based. The Texans could still do it."

Texans,3cnb7h,TonyShadyDee,2,Fri Jul 10 00:07:18 2015 UTC,But they wouldn't do it of course.
Texans,3cnb7h,the_toaster_lied,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:05:58 2015 UTC,"Why is everyone assuming this needs to be a one-for-one trade?  There's obviously no one player that will match the productivity of JJ Watt except for maybe an elite quarterback.  Why don't we find a team with a solid quarterback they can stand to lose due to an up and coming back-up along with another solid position player?  Aside from us getting a one-for-one trade with someone like Aaron Rodgers, a two-for-one is the only thing that would make sense."
Texans,3cnb7h,faceripperr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:59:34 2015 UTC,"Looking at needs for both teams, I'd venture to say the falcons need some pass rush badly. Does Matt Ryan plus a 2016 2-3 rounder seem fair?"
Texans,3cnb7h,chase-316,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:16:39 2015 UTC,"Now I don't want these to happen, but hypothetically.  Texans receive: Von Miller and Chris Harris Jr. and Emanuel Sanders Broncos receive: JJ Watt and Brian Cushing  We recieve a premier pass rusher with coverage abilities that is a suspension risk and probably just as pricey as Watt.  We receive an amazing CB with a really good deal, and a very solid #2 receiver.  Wade gets his Cushing/Watt combo back.  I don't know if picks are involved, I think both sides would hate this deal personally .  Texans receive: Aaron Donald and Robert Quinn and Tre Mason Rams receive: JJ Watt and Brian Cushing  u/barian_fostate wet dream.  Premier Pass Rusher, the next best DT in the league (can he play DE or NT in Crennel's defense?) and a running back to take over for Foster after his career."
Texans,3cnb7h,Barian_Fostate,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:09:58 2015 UTC,Lol there is no way they would ever give up two All-Pro caliber players for Watt XD
Texans,3cnb7h,chase-316,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:38:07 2015 UTC,Probably not.  Would you take that if offered and you had the title of GM?
Texans,3cnb7h,Barian_Fostate,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:24:11 2015 UTC,If I was the Rams I would laugh in their face. If I was the Texans I take it in a heart beat.

Texans,3cnb7h,IveAlreadyWon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:47:52 2015 UTC,I wouldn't trade Russel for Watt.

Texans,3cnb7h,mintz41,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:23:28 2015 UTC,"Three team trade?  Texans receive: Matthew Stafford, Corey Liuget   Lions receive: JJ Watt, Melvin Gordon, SD 2016 first rounder   Chargers receive: Calvin Johnson, Jeoffrey Pagan   Houston gets a top tier QB that fits the Bill O'Brien mold and a good young D-Lineman to fill the JJ hole.   After losing Suh, Bush, and Fairley the lions decide to tear it down and start over. They get the best player in the NFL entering his prime, a blue chip RB, and a first round pick to expedite the rebuild   Rivers gets the most dangerous WR in football and SD decides to mortgage it's future in an attempt to finally get over the hump."
Texans,3cnb7h,TwoChe,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:34:34 2015 UTC,"The Lions have absolutely no reason to tear it down and start again after losing Suh, replacing him with Ngata, and losing Bush and Fairley who contributed almost nothing to the team. They've just beefed up the OL for Stafford and finally have a complete receiver/TE set, along with 2 very good linebackers and a complete DB core. They're the closest they've been to contention for a very very long time and there's no reason for them to start over because they lost Suh."

Texans,3cmnj8,varo20,2,Thu Jul 9 02:24:10 2015 UTC,Still see people say that JJ can't win you games. That confuses me since most say it seriously. That pick 6 against the Bills is a prime example.   Then the sacks against the Ravens...Pick 6 on the Bengals our first playoff run - Sacks/TFLs against the Lions on thanksgiving which lead to missed FGs list goes on.

Texans,3cmtgs,SCREW-IT,5,Thu Jul 9 15:12:53 2015 UTC,Don't go looking for common ground with Colts fans!
Texans,3cmtgs,ShieldGuard,0,Thu Jul 9 18:11:38 2015 UTC,"Somewhat. Neither of those guys are in a position to truly be the GOAT on their side of the ball. Maybe Luck, but that would take a lot of amazing things to happen. Watt is already on his way, and I don't see him slowing down anytime soon."
Texans,3cmtgs,bburchibanez,8,Thu Jul 9 21:27:23 2015 UTC,Did you even watch the Texans past season? Clearly he spent 84% of snaps playing 4-3 OLB!
Texans,3cmtgs,jstevens21,3,Thu Jul 9 03:16:24 2015 UTC,"In 2014, the vast majority of his snaps (401) have come at left defensive end.    http://espn.go.com/blog/houston-texans/post/_/id/8581/the-many-places-j-j-watt-lines-up"
Texans,3cmtgs,LdZppln,2,Thu Jul 9 03:24:11 2015 UTC,"I wish it was broken down better.  Basically remove this sentence and do it right.     There's shading to all of these positions, but for the sake of simplicity we divide them into simple categories. In those, this season Watt has lined up in five different positions.   Or at least tell us the parameters for how you grouped the positions based on shading."
Texans,3cmtgs,mrbigglsworth,2,Thu Jul 9 15:39:28 2015 UTC,"I think that guy just phrased it really really badly.  JJ lines up a lot in N-techs that are most commonly associated with other positions quite a lot because our defense isn't vanilla 3-4.  He plays a lot of 2,3,4 (associated with DT), 7 and 9 (associated with 4-3 end) as well."
Texans,3cmtgs,LdZppln,2,Thu Jul 9 15:22:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I gathered as well.  Everyone has been misquoting the PFF #1 article that broke down his alignments.    A 4-3 DE is supposed to be more like a DT but Watt tends to line up outside more often.  Not exclusively, just as you said, but more than you would think.  People have been quoting the part in bold but forgetting the unbolded section that preceeds it:     Watt and Bennett still spend a lot of snaps inside, but their biggest spike is in the same area as the true edge defenders like Pierre-Paul. What makes Watt even more interesting is that he has the biggest spike of the group in the 9-technique alignment, the widest rush-alignment there is. That spike isn’t just the biggest of this group, but is one of the biggest in the league. Watt spends more time rushing from the wide-9 alignment than many of the players you would immediately think top that list."
Texans,3cmtgs,PanicCasanova,2,Thu Jul 9 15:34:43 2015 UTC,"Someone please and discuss with me but, jj is a Leo pass rusher that happens to play in a  3-4 system, right?"
Texans,3cmtgs,madeitallupvotes,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:50:28 2015 UTC,I think he's more of an Aquarius pass catcher. At least in our goal line package

Texans,3cm2bc,icklebush,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:39:13 2015 UTC,"There's some inconsistency, but it's about the year they had.  Murray had a great year, and a lot of it was his doing.  Is he a top five player this year?  Not even close.  But he was on fire last year and I don't think it's all that bad to give him a bit of spotlight for it.  Meanwhile, Calvin didn't look great this year, especially when you consider how well Tate played as the #1 when needed.  In general, Calvin is the greatest WR today, but it wasn't a great year for him."

Texans,3ck0mr,SeaRavenTX,5,Wed Jul 8 22:08:37 2015 UTC,"I think it's hilarious. They're both just having fun with it. As long as no one's hurt, there's nothing wrong with it.

Texans,3ck0mr,Imakeshittyusernames,16,Thu Jul 9 02:09:52 2015 UTC,The hate boner at r/nfl is beautiful. No one is really acknowledging the fact that this shit ended 8 months ago.  It's like that argument you get into with someone and they sorta burn you (with a sack and selfie celebration) and you come up with the perfect retort only as you're walking away and the argument's over.
Texans,3ck0mr,gergz,19,Wed Jul 8 15:07:31 2015 UTC,The hate from there is hilarious. Watt is just poking fun at a rival opponent. They are taking this shit wayyyyyyy too seriously. Ohhhh the NFL offseason....
Texans,3ck0mr,turymtz,-18,Wed Jul 8 15:45:29 2015 UTC,Watt is getting really annoying. He's so obviously fake. He's got no personality so he puts on this Clark Kent persona. He's approaching douche-bag level.
Texans,3ck0mr,Imakeshittyusernames,17,Wed Jul 8 16:17:05 2015 UTC,"Fuck, I knew the conspiracy rumors were true all this time! What a fucking low-life piece of shit JJ is. I mean, the truth would've come out eventually but im glad it did now rather than later. JJ Watt really is Superman"
Texans,3ck0mr,turymtz,-21,Wed Jul 8 16:25:52 2015 UTC,"Nah, acts like Clark Kent but is not Superman. Unless his hypocrisy and corniness are faster than a speeding bullet."
Texans,3ck0mr,Imakeshittyusernames,12,Wed Jul 8 16:32:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe they aren't, but his ability to sack quarterbacks and score a few TD's probably is"
Texans,3ck0mr,turymtz,-4,Wed Jul 8 16:42:20 2015 UTC,No doubt.
Texans,3ck0mr,da1hobo,16,Wed Jul 8 16:55:33 2015 UTC,I wish for the love of god someone would tell me what is fake about JJ.  It gets repeated so much but never expanded on.  It's like people who call Obama a socialist.
Texans,3ck0mr,gergz,14,Wed Jul 8 16:42:39 2015 UTC,Because he tries to be likeable. What an asshole!
Texans,3ck0mr,turymtz,-8,Wed Jul 8 16:45:44 2015 UTC,"It's just a read on him from me. It's a lack of personality. The dude speaks almost exclusively in platitudes. . .and repeats them ALL THE TIME. There are a lot of players that would be interesting in a sit down conversation. . .that I'd actually look forward to if given a chance. I'd probably pass on a JJ Watt sitdown if given the chance. To each his own, I guess. Just my opinion."
Texans,3ck0mr,da1hobo,12,Wed Jul 8 16:54:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe instead of calling him fake, which is calling him a liar or fraud, you could maybe say you don't think he would be a fun person to have a conversation with.    Just a plea to use some accurate terminology rather than saying someone is ""obviously fake"" because you have a personal opinion about them."
Texans,3ck0mr,turymtz,-11,Wed Jul 8 17:01:31 2015 UTC,"Well, he talks in these platitudes to put out a persona. He's not genuine. For example, he misrepresented his ""cabin in the middle of nowhere"" to train. . .like a Rocky IV training montage because it fit this image he wants to convey."
Texans,3ck0mr,Imakeshittyusernames,12,Wed Jul 8 17:17:51 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize JJ sits at home by himself worrying over what the public thinks of his image rather than focus on the next season.   I mean, we're sitting here arguing over what another man does with his millions of dollars and are upset because he downplayed a description of a summer home. This is so stupid."
Texans,3ck0mr,da1hobo,7,Wed Jul 8 17:31:49 2015 UTC,"JJ didn't misrepresent anything.  People who take his quote out of context do though.  His ""no frills"" and ""minimalistic"" comment was about the location of his cabin, not his actual cabin.  You can thank deadspin for that spin.  He never even described the cabin other than saying it was in the middle of the woods."
Texans,3ck0mr,This-Is-My-Moment,6,Wed Jul 8 18:02:38 2015 UTC,I'm glad you know him personally are you willing to do an AMA
Texans,3ck0mr,rab7,11,Wed Jul 8 16:41:46 2015 UTC,"I'm used to the jj hate already, but what really pissed me off was that there are a lot of people that actually believe that Mettenberger is better than every qb on our roster. Fucking seriously?"
Texans,3ck0mr,LOOK_AT_IT,8,Wed Jul 8 15:23:26 2015 UTC,At least every QB we have (save for Savage) has actually won a NFL game.
Texans,3ck0mr,da1hobo,10,Wed Jul 8 16:23:47 2015 UTC,Even Keenum has won two games.    Take that Mettenberger.
Texans,3ck0mr,dseals,7,Wed Jul 8 16:43:29 2015 UTC,"The Mettenboner in /r/nfl is real. Mett's a good QB, but he's not even at the level of Hoyer. Anyone that thinks that is a moron."
Texans,3ck0mr,natedogg89,3,Wed Jul 8 17:22:21 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it wasn't like Mett just came out eight months later and said it. A reporter specifically asked about it even though it was pretty old and Mett responded then.  The whole thing is kinda like ""we get it guys, you can stop now"" at this point though."
Texans,3ck0mr,Imakeshittyusernames,2,Wed Jul 8 22:11:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly which is why this whole thing is crazy stupid. He did answer it thoroughly like he was still irked by it, but he and JJ responded in a way that makes it seem they want to put this shit behind them, but everyone at the other sub is jerking each other's hate for JJ off"
Texans,3ck0mr,BackAlleyPrisonRape,7,Wed Jul 8 22:25:31 2015 UTC,Except doesn't Watt still post selfies and make fun of Mett? But oh well
Texans,3ck0mr,Imakeshittyusernames,18,Wed Jul 8 15:25:19 2015 UTC,"I mean, if your definition of a personal attack on someone is a #OhNoaSelfie then yeah I guess JJ is an awful person"
Texans,3ck0mr,da1hobo,10,Wed Jul 8 16:11:26 2015 UTC,And those are not even directed at Mett.  It's to all the people who were ragging on him for his selfies after he made the comment about Mett.
Texans,3ck0mr,Imakeshittyusernames,13,Wed Jul 8 16:38:52 2015 UTC,"That, and honestly the whole sheep reference can be attributed to the butthurt fans more than Mets"
Texans,3ck0mr,da1hobo,7,Wed Jul 8 16:42:59 2015 UTC,Yup.  People have been sending him shit all day since Mett made his comment.
Texans,3ck0mr,BackAlleyPrisonRape,2,Wed Jul 8 16:44:46 2015 UTC,When did I say they were personal attacks or that he was an awful person? He just seems like he's a tad bit arrogant. Don't get so defensive.
Texans,3ck0mr,Imakeshittyusernames,6,Wed Jul 8 17:00:24 2015 UTC,"Lol none of what I said was defensive. Except for this comment, sort of."
Texans,3ck0mr,BackAlleyPrisonRape,-4,Wed Jul 8 17:09:08 2015 UTC,You grossly exaggerated what I said to make it seem like I said JJ Watt is a horrible person
Texans,3ck0mr,Imakeshittyusernames,3,Wed Jul 8 17:23:01 2015 UTC,"In an attempt to refute against your passive aggressive remark. I mean, we're still arguing over what is essentially a selfie, right? How is that not as ridiculous as my comment? Lol this is actually fun"
Texans,3ck0mr,BackAlleyPrisonRape,-2,Wed Jul 8 17:28:59 2015 UTC,...but it's not ridiculous for Watt to make fun of it for months? 😐
Texans,3ck0mr,Imakeshittyusernames,6,Wed Jul 8 17:54:58 2015 UTC,All he's done is use a fucking hashtag dude. If that's seriously a mental torment for Metts then he needs to grow a pair.
Texans,3ck0mr,LongJohnErd,-16,Wed Jul 8 17:57:47 2015 UTC,"JJ initiated the feud when Mett was just minding his own business having fun. Mett ignored it. JJ continued to make fun of him, Mett finally shot back, and now delusional Texans fans like /u/Imakeshittyusernames are trying to act like Mett is the one that can't let it go."
Texans,3ck0mr,da1hobo,9,Wed Jul 8 16:00:15 2015 UTC,JJ hasn't made a comment about Mett in a long time.  Unless you think #ohnoaselfie is directed at him.  If that's the case you better get over to instagram and tell all those people who don't even watch football to knock it off.
Texans,3ck0mr,Imakeshittyusernames,12,Wed Jul 8 16:41:27 2015 UTC,"He continued it with a fucking hashtag on Twitter. Really? That's what we call fued's between people now? Lol ok sure buddy, I'm the delusional one."
Texans,3ck0mr,SCREW-IT,4,Wed Jul 8 16:16:22 2015 UTC,If I try to talk shit about someone 9 months later... Then yes... He might have issues letting it go since Watt savaged every single one of his holes both times we played him.
Texans,3ck0mr,dseals,9,Wed Jul 8 17:21:08 2015 UTC,"I can't stand /r/nfl today. I can take a little JJ hate, but when it gets to this level of ridiculousness:   I love how they are attacking Mettenberger and calling him a bad QB.  Mettenberger is probably better then any QB on their roster.   /r/Texans right now:   You think Hoyer or Mallet will be the answer? Queue talk about how both probably are the second coming of jesus   No fuck this shit I'm out. Once my Luck article is posted I'm taking a hiatus from that place. If this kind of unfiltered bullshit can get 50 upvotes then I'm clearly in the wrong sub."
Texans,3ck0mr,deephousebeing,7,Wed Jul 8 17:30:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I died when I saw that comment.

He has the NFL size for a QB but he needs to let his game speak before his mouth does. Now it's looking like Mariota is the future Mettenburger will ride the pine- yet he talks trash in an interview?

Texans,3ck0mr,OmgItsTheWams,0,Wed Jul 8 23:15:02 2015 UTC,Am I the only Texans fan that thinks JJ is being a douche about this? He always pokes back at Mett with the selfies I mean JJ Is awesome and the best player in the league why bother messing with a backup qb

Texans,3ckern,Blucheese99,5,Wed Jul 8 16:30:16 2015 UTC,"I felt real comfortable every snap he took last year. He had total command of the offense. When we desperately needed a play he made it, like on that 4th down vs the browns.   We been watching our QBs run for their lives in the backfield for too long. Great QBs identify blitzes and put a hat on every head. Mallet is the answer. Hoyer is good but we need someone with the potential to be a great."
Texans,3ckern,quickdrawmcgraw1,10,Wed Jul 8 17:41:31 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty shitty article. Basically the author admits there's no actual new information to go off of, then briefly rehashes some old information and adds some editorial conjecture based mostly on Mallett's college stats.  Almost anyone could have slapped this piece together in under an hour. It's offseason, slow-news-week clickbait, nothing to see here."
Texans,3ckern,DoktorStrangelove,4,Wed Jul 8 17:37:21 2015 UTC,Just throwing this out there. I went to school with Mallett. He's got an absolute cannon for an arm (often out throwing our fastest receiver there (Jarius Wright who now plays for Minnesota). If Mallett continues to develop in some much needed areas like vision and especially footwork Nuk will put Mike Wallace in his hay day to shame by becoming the WR that without a doubt can stretch the field to no end

Texans,3ckern,mementori,3,Wed Jul 8 17:22:02 2015 UTC,"I love Mallet, there's just one thing missing in his game and that's the touch on intermediate routes. He throws a 5 yard hitch like it's a go route from the 20. With a QB whisperer like O'Brien he's got the best chance to fix it.  His vision and footwork are there, just not 100% consistent. But that's more of a reps issue than anything."

I think when it's all said and done, B-Hoy is probably gonna be your starter. Just make sure you don't rely on him to win games. He's a suitable game manager, and 15 yrs ago under different rules, could've gotten you guys into the playoffs and maybe even a SB win"

Texans,3cic7c,skizmcniz,12,Wed Jul 8 04:16:41 2015 UTC,JJ's sentiment was a good one but the delivery was awful. The kid was about to face one of the best defensive linemen in recent years with an atrocious offensive line. Every pregame moment should have been spent finding ways to stay alive throughout the game. JJ brought this up but he could have been so much more tactful about it. Zach went through some really messed up shit at LSU (see: four sacks in a row) which tanked his draft stock and he was excited to be given the opportunity to play at the professional level. He has balls of steel. No need to talk down to him and belittle him.
Texans,3cic7c,effortlessgrace,2,Wed Jul 8 05:51:56 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. I love JJ, but I'm a diehard LSU fan and this selfie thing has always rubbed me the wrong way."

That being said, the dude is a hyper-competitive psycho, it isn't a surprise that he's going to be an asshole like this on occasion.   I kinda hope that Mett gets a starting job somewhere and proves JJ wrong. Ever since I've seen that horrible clip of Mett taking four sacks in a row, and then finding out how he's basically been cast aside in favour of Mariota, I've been rooting for the dude. He's had to deal with a lot of adversity."
Texans,3cic7c,Jmacadd,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:08:40 2015 UTC,"I really hope Mett gets a chance tos tart somewhere as well. I was so excited for LSU's crop of rookies last year as I had so much fun watching Mett, OBJ, Landry, Blue, and Hill. I feel like Mett just hasn't had his chance to shine yet. Watching him crawl off the field after that fourth sack was so damn hard to watch. I really hope he gets another shot. He's dealt with a lot of shit on his journey to the NFL, some of it because of his own stupidity, but I really hope he's not given up on yet."

Texans,3cic7c,bearwulf,19,Wed Jul 8 03:44:40 2015 UTC,1) he's the face of our franchise. And the jackets were dumb.   2) I think we all drink JJ's kook aid to much. Sometimes JJ is a Social Media Douche. Zach's right unfortunately on this one. The jackets were really fucking gay.
Texans,3cic7c,htownandown,8,Wed Jul 8 13:21:36 2015 UTC,Agreed. I unfollowed his Instagram because it was getting annoying especially after the zac brown shit.

Texans,3c4mha,This-Is-My-Moment,15,Sat Jul 4 19:02:57 2015 UTC,"I've discussed this with a few Colts fans and it basically boils down this, which I fully agree with:  They won't take us seriously until we cockblock them from the playoffs or knock them out of it. A lot has changed since the last time we beat them out of it.  Now, on the bright side is that anybody who has watched our last few games knows we're definitely capable of beating them. I think in a game where we don't suffer bad luck or complete bullshit outcomes (such as our QB breaking his leg), we can definitely split the series. With quite a bit of bad luck, we get swept. With quite a bit of good luck, we could even sweep them. Any given Sunday.  Until we take a dump in their Cheerios, they won't take us seriously. And so far the planets and stars have all aligned to keep us from doing so."

Texans,3c4mha,EarthboundCory,3,Sat Jul 4 20:56:28 2015 UTC,"As a Colts fan, I don't think it's an automatic win, but I'm also not going to fear the Texans until they start winning against us regularly. While I consider the Titans and Jaguars to be easier games, I'd still much rather play the Texans than the Pats, Steelers, Cowboys, Broncos, or Ravens.  Every game is different though, and it's possible to lose every week, so I don't exactly sleep on anyone. The Browns almost beat us, after all."
Texans,3c4mha,freakybj,10,Mon Jul 6 20:56:03 2015 UTC,The Colts are the trendy pick to go to the Super Bowl this year so I say they are sleeping on us pretty hard.  Can't say I blame them since we haven't done much to improve our offense this season.
Texans,3c4mha,thursdae,-3,Mon Jul 6 14:48:18 2015 UTC,"Hey, remember when we were the trendy pick to go to the Super Bowl?  Yeah, I hope the outcome is exactly the same for them."
Texans,3c4mha,BallFaceMcDickButt,13,Sat Jul 4 22:22:59 2015 UTC,"Colts fan's perspective here, it's about an 8.   We fully expect to win in Indy and half expect to win in Houston. We know our games are usually close, we just usually come out on top."

Texans,3c4mha,geezergamer,4,Sat Jul 4 19:12:09 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's their division to lose tbh. For us to win would take some sort of collapse for them or a major injury. It's a QB driven league and Luck can play."
Texans,3c4mha,thursdae,7,Sun Jul 5 05:09:08 2015 UTC,"Until they get a decent QB, no one is going to respect the Texans."
Texans,3c4mha,SilverViper,4,Sun Jul 5 16:43:34 2015 UTC,"Putting up a good run (including getting to and not being blown out of the playoffs) would solidify people shutting the fuck up about us not having a QB.  Though chances are, whichever QB did that for us would then be considered a servicable QB if they weren't before.."
Texans,3c4mha,SilverViper,5,Sun Jul 5 00:38:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know if we are necessarily sleeping on you guys. You were still in the thick of things last year with Fitzmagic playing only part of the season. I think Hoyer is more than serviceable for you guys(if Mallet wins over him, even better) to at least secure a wild card. I don't think you should be favorites for the division though. A lot can happen either way. For instance, two years ago you guys were 2 and 14 with a fairly similar roster that had just won the division the year before."
Texans,3c4mha,HoustonSportsFan,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:23:39 2015 UTC,Of course not favorites to win but at least a serious threat

Texans,3c4mha,JayVeeThree,2,Sun Jul 5 18:42:48 2015 UTC,The head coach is responsible for winning games. Kubiak had us at 2-14. He was fired. OB1 came in and lost three QB's and went 9-7. That says a lot.
Texans,3c4mha,acreek,3,Sun Jul 5 19:11:00 2015 UTC,The casual Colts fan is at a 9.   I'm actually kinda sad I moved out of Indy this year because I won't be able to enjoy all the salt when they finally lose.
Texans,3c4mha,jiggeroni,2,Mon Jul 6 16:02:40 2015 UTC,"Most Colts fans don't sleep on the Texans. You guys have a great team, but dog turds at QB, which is the most important position. Also, as many have pointed out, you guys have never won in Indy and are only 4-9 in Houston. I have a lot of respect for the Texans and how well they draft, but you guys made a big mistake (or huge blessing if you're a Colts fan), by not taking Teddy Bridgewater. If you guys took Teddy #1 (or traded up a few spots to get him), then you'd be a top 4 AFC team IMO.  The part about being one Colts game from winning the division is inaccurate though. Even if you flipped one of the two games, Houston still loses by tiebreakers (common games)."
Texans,3c4mha,ae_syn89,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:40:46 2015 UTC,I hope it's a 1. Divisional games should never be considered an automatic win no matter who you're playing.
Texans,3c4mha,SilverViper,-2,Mon Jul 6 05:35:58 2015 UTC,"I lurk the Colts subreddit. They have absolutely no humility to them which is very entertaining to me. If you think I'm kidding go lurk there and see how ridiculous they are.   They consistently circle jerk about how good they are,  how bad everyone else is, how bad the pats will be.   They had a thread with everyone's ""realistic"" predictions not to long ago and it closely matched their normal ones of 13-3 and 14-2.   90% of their fan base thinks they are going to be the greatest show on turf 2.0 because they added a few aging verterans. It's not if they make the AFC championship or the Super Bowl anymore it's now who they are going to play like it's fact. It's not if they are going to win the Super Bowl it's who Andrew Luck will win his first superbowl against.   Now to answer your specific questions are they sleeping on us? The entire Colts fanbase is sleeping on the ENTIRE league minus SEA and maybe GB."
Texans,3c4mha,EarthboundCory,14,Mon Jul 6 16:43:33 2015 UTC,"They consistently circle jerk about how good they are, how bad everyone else is, how bad the pats will be.   That is simply not true. I read just about every comment and post over there. We certainly think we'll be good (and why wouldn't we think that given the past 3 years), but there are very few posts that talk about how bad other teams are. And I think just about everyone over there knows the Pats will be good.  Don't know what sub you're lurking, but it sure doesn't sound like r/Colts. Unless you're just cherry picking the occasional comments from dumbass fans which inevitably get downvoted."
Texans,3c4mha,thursdae,7,Sat Jul 4 21:48:45 2015 UTC,"You see what you want to see. Most of the predictions from Colt's fans are 12-4 btw which I think is reasonable given our cake schedule.   I lurk on all of the subreddit's and would actually argue that this is one of the most arrogant ones(this usually only comes from select individuals as is always the case in these things). Your post for instance thinks that our ""entire fanbase is sleeping on the entire league minus SEA and maybe GB"" and that's simply not true nor can you have any means of proving it.   I think our fanbase simply recognizes that we have an excellent chance at making the post season again. So we are probably prematurely focused on the post season."
Texans,3c4mha,SNSDsunny,2,Sun Jul 5 22:40:29 2015 UTC,"Not true. Most of us feel like we should win 10-11 games easily (assuming we're healthy). Is that really a stretch? I can see us winning 13 games, but that would require us to win some games that are pretty much up for grabs and not lose games we should be winning. I don't see anyone who thinks the Colts will win more than 13 games. I see anywhere from 10-13 games being realistic."

Texans,3byxm4,Zaracen,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:24:04 2015 UTC,The story was mostly the same the first four seasons with some very interesting things left out. I haven't watched this past season but I heard they butchered most of the story.
Texans,3byxm4,OMGIMONF1RE,6,Fri Jul 3 15:22:53 2015 UTC,"Its kind of funny to see how different the sports subs are from the other subs. Most subs are like JOIN TOGETHER IN UNITY FUCK THE ADMINS. I saw a post on /r/games that said that everyone should ""unsubscribed these pussies"" because they didn't go dark. Meanwhile in all the sports subs  (except /r/sports) the general consensus is like ""nah I just want to talk sports i dont want to deal with this crap,"" which is great. While I understand the issue, i deal with enough crap in real life. I just want to talk about the texans rockets and astros with other people because my friends aren't really like knowledgable about sports."

Texans,3byxm4,What_No_Cookie,3,Fri Jul 3 14:20:01 2015 UTC,I love drama as much as the next person but this just amounts to a hissy fit by a lot of the mods. If they really wanted to do damage to reddit all they would have to do is leave and leave all the defaults without mods but they won't because they like the power trip.
Texans,3byxm4,edwardsamson,2,Fri Jul 3 14:49:54 2015 UTC,Not to mention how in EVERY one of these fuck reddit posts theres like 20 golds given out....lmao great idea lets protest a site while giving them views and money!

In front of me. Wtf attacking my manhood. I'm right in thinking that's fucked up right? They don't know we aren't together

I've been stubborn all week, telling my husband that I'm good to go to Schlitterbahn this weekend. I gave up, today. I can't frickin walk without my left leg feeling wonky from the knee down. No first-time New Braunfels fun in the sun for me. :'(  Gah, I can't believe I fell in the most stupid way in the history of falling. I couldn't get my right leg out from being tucked under my butt in order to try to catch myself.   So.... my weekend plans involve being sad. Could have been worse, though.

Texans,3byxm4,Zaracen,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:48:45 2015 UTC,The only problem I have is everyone is freaking out over someone being fired and they don't even know the story of why. There are two sides to every story and we haven't heard anything except she was unexpectedly fired.  I'll probably play Skyrim and surf pornhub. Maybe take the kids swimming if the pool isn't crowded.
Texans,3byxm4,Blucheese99,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:30:04 2015 UTC,Well I go on a site called funnyjunk and it's a great site I recommend using it whether site fail or not. They even have a sports page just not an individual Texans page. Here's the link to the site http://funnyjunk.com

Texans,3byxm4,gritodedolores1946,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:36:19 2015 UTC,They'll learn the more protests happen over other stuff. There's a bigger move to voat now but the problem is their servers are down from the influx of reddit users.

Texans,3byh1j,freshproduce,3,Fri Jul 3 12:08:12 2015 UTC,I'm so proud that this is the highest upvoted response to a question about our sub going dark.  Love y'all
Texans,3byh1j,GingerRaceFTW,16,Fri Jul 3 17:14:21 2015 UTC,I honestly can't believe they got rid of her.  She was awesome in the AMA's.   Reddit management is fucking retarded.
Texans,3byh1j,gritodedolores1946,13,Fri Jul 3 06:11:22 2015 UTC,"People's  reaction to subreddits going private in protest is really frustrating. They just think it's a shitfest or Reddits monthly bitching but the issue is more serious than it was during the FPH banning. Admins aren't listening to mods, no cooperation. Reddit is still a business and it seems like Reddit is going down. I don't want this website to go away. I'm rambling and ranting but there's my two cents. If /r/Texans joins then great and if they don't then great. So...yeah fuck the Colts."
Texans,3byh1j,aareyes12,5,Fri Jul 3 08:53:58 2015 UTC,"I know. She's done so many great things for the Reddit community. Rumor has it that she was opposing the commercialization of the AMA process, so Reddit got rid of her. If it's true, I'm not sure if I can continue being a member of the site..."
Texans,3byh1j,OMGIMONF1RE,20,Fri Jul 3 06:17:18 2015 UTC,Nah we need a Friday night thread. This is the perfect time because the rest of reddit will be down.   Come to where the lights are still on! /r/Texans shindig is going down!!!

Texans,3byh1j,Mittens-Romney,3,Fri Jul 3 05:37:21 2015 UTC,I can pretty much assure you that /r/nfl isn't going to be a part of this.
Texans,3byh1j,Jafair,3,Fri Jul 3 17:58:56 2015 UTC,Personally in this sub - why would you?  I can get the higher subs doing it but smaller ones like teams shouldn't (IMO)   Then again nothing is happening soooo
Texans,3byh1j,What_No_Cookie,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:19:49 2015 UTC,"Like I said...I was just curious what was going on with this sub's mods. There are a lot of little subs that have decided to go dark, wasn't sure if this was one of them."

Texans,3byh1j,falsekoala,2,Fri Jul 3 05:18:17 2015 UTC,Well then let's get a Friday free talk going!
Texans,3byh1j,hank_scorpion_king,2,Fri Jul 3 05:19:16 2015 UTC,You can always start it but I won't participate until I have something to say. It always takes me awhile to remember what I want to say.
Texans,3byh1j,Timid_One,2,Fri Jul 3 05:23:37 2015 UTC,/u/aareyes12 mentioned there would be a Friday thread in their other comment...I'm just waiting for it to pop up!
Texans,3byh1j,SpawnDnD,4,Fri Jul 3 05:25:12 2015 UTC,Yeah if we could not get involved with this meta bs that'd be great. If reddit wants to have their monthly shitfest that's fine but frankly the sports subs are where people go to escape this nonsense.

Texans,3bvfh0,aareyes12,3,Thu Jul 2 19:15:53 2015 UTC,The cabin story definetly brought some good comics. Maybe Suh should get a cabin
Texans,3bvfh0,paulwhite959,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:28:13 2015 UTC,I wonder what prints sell for?
Texans,3bvfh0,SCREW-IT,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:38:03 2015 UTC,probably not insanely expensive. on his site is says he does commissions and the prices are reasonable so i imagine just making a print of an old comic and not making a new one should make it decently priced.
Texans,3bvfh0,Mind_Killer,8,Thu Jul 2 20:48:28 2015 UTC,Hah! That's awesome.   In that scene in the movie it took more than one velociraptor to bait the trap.   Only takes one Watt.
Texans,3bvfh0,trillvilletx,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:26:05 2015 UTC,it makes no sense and just a crude representation of the scene swapping the raptors with jj...but still entertaining nonetheless.
Texans,3bvfh0,tannhauser_gate_vet,0,Thu Jul 2 21:17:44 2015 UTC,"It's also a complete ripoff of a comic that's been around for years where a guy is tracking JJ Watt in the forest, only for JJ to drop out of a tree and sack him. But I guess we're upvoting zero effort pro-JJ posts."

Texans,3bsmqx,559179,14,Wed Jul 1 23:04:10 2015 UTC,He's on the roster. We could say the streak is alive for players that make the final 53 but that's a stretch.
Texans,3bsmqx,BisonST,14,Wed Jul 1 23:06:41 2015 UTC,"I really don't think that's much of a stretch. If they weren't on the final 53 at one time is the previous season, it shouldn't count against us. :)"

Texans,3brvxe,Blucheese99,10,Wed Jul 1 17:26:26 2015 UTC,"Rahim Moore will start at free safety.  We don't really have an in the box type safety on the roster that doesn't completely suck. Looking at you Eddie Pleasant.  If Brown is healthy he will probably play a lot. Hal may play safety in nickel looks.  Ballentine might also see some time, and he has some nice physical tools, but he's so so raw.  I feel pretty good about a cover 2 with Moore and Brown."
Texans,3brvxe,Wham_Bam_Smash,4,Wed Jul 1 17:31:02 2015 UTC,"I think Cliett could be a decent in the box safety. Played linebacker in college, and has some coverage ability. He's a lot faster than Pleasant too."

Texans,3brvxe,dirtymindrebel,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:06:10 2015 UTC,"I'd bet that Stevie Brown will start at SS - he's going to be counted on working with our CB's for run support and pass coverage. Rahim Moore will start as our Free Safety. RAC will throw him into a lot of zone situations - ask him to be more or less of the 'roving CF' called on to make a lot of turnovers, and worry less about run support.  As for Ballentine and Hal, I think they'll provide depth behind Moore. They both have good quickness, are hailed for their football IQ and thrive in zone situations - and Lonnie's got that size factor going for him too.  As for depth behind Stevie - I think it's a little scarier. We'll probably roll with Pleasant and Cliett and just cross our fingers that no one gets hurt - Swagg kind of screwed us on this one."

Texans,3bq25t,dismemberedalive,8,Wed Jul 1 05:59:13 2015 UTC,i cant wait to see cushing. he is so fucking chill outside of the game. like every interview and off field thing ive seen. hes just calm and talking about his kid and whatnot.  then the clips of him in game. night and day. i wonder how riled up he gets for practices.  i would argue that he was the heart and soul of the team until sometime last year... but he can become that again i think if his knees keep geting stronger and he gets that confidence back.
Texans,3bq25t,iammattchambers,3,Wed Jul 1 07:44:07 2015 UTC,I think he is still the heart and soul. He's definitely still the loudest.

After a couple glasses of sweet sweet purple drank, things begin to look a lot rosier and I think we have every reason to be optimistic. We put together last season with 4 QBs and little to no impact from our draft class. We have those guys coming back, a new draft class, solid D, and smart contracts over the offseason.

If you have no idea who your QB is and no concrete plans to land a top one (i.e. tanking), you're basically directionless. We're always going to be one JJ injury away from being a 4-12 team until we figure out the QB situation. It's also a questionable strategy to me, keeping Rick Smith in charge. Hopefully he takes a backseat and lets BOB make the personnel decisions, because frankly Smith isn't any better at drafting than if you just asked Kiper/McShay who the BPA is when it comes our turn."

I don't really trust BOB's evaluation skills either.  We haven't gotten a lot from last year's draft class and it seems like O'Brien blew it on evaluating QB talent.  We could've had Bridgewater, Bortles, Carr, or Garoppolo but end up with Tom Savage.  It's too early to equate last year's draft class with that of 2013, but it isn't looking too promising right now."

Neards will be shaven, clothes will be ripped, and ashes will be thrown in agonizing grief as we lay waste to their team at lucas stadium and NRG stadium. Then he-who-must-not-be-named will look up at us as we make our way to the superbowl and say ""lol, jk, trade back, plz?"" and we will whisper back ""No.""  Truly, fuck the colts."
Texans,3bj7ku,Mittens-Romney,5,Mon Jun 29 19:14:57 2015 UTC,That speech just brought a tear to my eye.
Texans,3bj7ku,at_work_safe_acct,4,Mon Jun 29 19:32:27 2015 UTC,To each his own but personally I view the Cowboys only as some asshole down the street that I can just ignore. The Colts are that dick neighbor that always tries to rub your face in their own bullshit.

Texans,3bj7ku,thursdae,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:24:41 2015 UTC,"Interesting, why not shit in a Colts helmet. I'm not exactly a huge cowboys fan but I don't really care about them either, Colts are the ones we have to battle if we are going to get into the playoffs.   I don't want to say it's a ""casual fan"" post or anything, but I only see this kind of stuff on Facebook. The badly photoshopped heavily jpeg'd anti-Cowboy pictures. If you're not heavily invested in the progress of the team I can see why you would hate on the Cowboys over the Colts, and I was the same way before I started really following the team on more than just game-days during the season.   If what you're expressing is shit-talk that embodies the progress of the team and its current struggles, it would be anti-Colts.  If what you're expressing is shit-talk for trolling local friends and such, in spite of it not being entirely relevant to the current state of the team, it would be anti-Cowboys.   The middle ground is anti-Titans ;)"
Texans,3bj7ku,KKG_Apok,2,Tue Jun 30 14:05:05 2015 UTC,Jesus christ guys. We may be over analysing this. I found the picture and posted it. Not a casual fan. just thought people might laugh at it.

In fact, let's continue analyzing it!  It appears that not only is the picture of substandard compression quality for the Texans subreddit, but that the Cowboys helmet and Texans logo are both photoshopped.  http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=23ac438891396a51dc8643aeb6996e4d14d9845e.24537  As you can see in this Error Level Analysis (ELA), the areas around the helmet and logo are light colored. ELA highlights differences in the JPEG compression rate. Regions with uniform coloring, like a solid blue sky or a white wall, will likely have a lower ELA result (darker color) than high-contrast edges.

John McClain tweeted back in February that this wasn't going to happen.  Even this latest news is just speculation.  If the Texans deny that the turf was the cause of all those injuries last year, why would they change it?"
Texans,3bi3jt,thedrainbow,3,Mon Jun 29 14:01:09 2015 UTC,I don't think they can change their stance and that's what the hold up is. Because of the on going case with the punter they can't admit fault without it effecting that outcome.
Texans,3bi3jt,baudrillardwasright,7,Mon Jun 29 14:44:25 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's a pretty well-ingrained part of evidence law that subsequent remedial measures aren't admissible in court because they unfairly imply an admission of guilt. That wouldn't be the hold up."
Texans,3bi3jt,thedrainbow,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:52:57 2015 UTC,"So even if the cause of injury is still undetermined, they couldn't bring up changing the field due to pressure from league and public for being unsafe?  Even if that punter doesn't win his settlement, but we change it during controversy, does that open the door for other lawsuits from players? This all needs to be taken care of before we host the big one."
Texans,3bi3jt,tangygnat,3,Mon Jun 29 17:09:43 2015 UTC,"Texas Rule of Evidence 407(a):  When measures are taken that would have made an earlier injury or harm less likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove:  negligence; culpable conduct; a defect in a product or its design; or a need for a warning or instruction.  It is not admissible in this case or any other case regarding the safety of the turf.  In short, the legislature did not want to prevent people from correcting potentially hazardous conditions so they simply excluded subsequent remedial measures from admissibility for the above purposes.  https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_407"
Texans,3bi3jt,baudrillardwasright,2,Mon Jun 29 19:28:05 2015 UTC,"Yup. Federal Rule of Evidence 407: https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_407  The fact that the turf is being changed wouldn't be admissible as evidence in that lawsuit or any other - it's not relevant as proof of wrongdoing. It can be admitted for other purposes, like showing control (e.g. ""you said you didn't own that dangerous truck, but then you fixed it, so you must have owned it"") or the feasibility of precautionary measures - so, if the Texans say ""we couldn't have gone to fieldturf, because it wasn't feasible with our field"", and then later change to fieldturf, the evidence of the change to fieldturf would be admissible, but the jury (or judge) would ONLY be allowed to consider it to the extent that it involved the fact that the change to fieldturf was possible.   In other words, there are a couple of limited circumstances where it could be admitted - in any lawsuit, not just this one. Those probably aren't at play here. They wouldn't be any more admissible in any later lawsuits than they are in this one."

No matter how nice the artificial surface is... but I'm sure there have even been some improvements in that in the last 10 years.  Turf just doesn't give the way that sod does so you get all the associated injuries with that like turf toe and torn knee ligaments.  Plus turf burn.

Texans,3berc1,freakybj,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:05:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think Savage will ever be a starter for the Texans.  Just looking at last year, Savage should've have been made starter when Mallett got injured but O'Brien felt more comfortable going back to Fitzpatrick and signing Thad Lewis.  When Savage stepped on the field after Fitzpatrick broke his leg it was obvious why O'Brien didn't name Savage the starter.  This offseason O'Brien brings in Hoyer to compete for the starting job.  If Savage is truly developing, why isn't the QB competition for starter between Mallett and Savage? Hopefully, he'll serve as good trade bait one day and the Texans can get something back for him."
Texans,3berc1,sluke827,4,Mon Jun 29 13:22:09 2015 UTC,There's a reason why they say Savage is a project. They are trying to mold him to become a quarterback for their system. Will it work? Idk that's why he's a project but it will take a lot longer than a few months for him to be thrown to the wolves. Why would Bill O'brien start him over a healthy Fitzpatrick when we still had a legitimate shot at the playoffs? Starting a third string rookie would have been giving up on the season.
Texans,3berc1,freakybj,3,Mon Jun 29 14:16:30 2015 UTC,"I wish people would stop calling Savage a project. This is his second season, but he's still the 3rd QB option.  He should be at least competing for the backup spot by now.  Mettenberger who was drafted in the 7th round at least started for the Titans last year and had legitimate hopes of continuing as starter until Mariota was drafted.  Also, I'm not saying going back to Fitzpatrick was the wrong decision.  It was the right decision especially considering the game he had against the Titans.  My question is...how come Savage wasn't ready to seize the opportunity of being the starting QB?  Even this year, he has very little hope of even seeing the field if Mallett and Hoyer stay healthy.  What purpose does Savage serve?  I don't get it.  He should be at least in the conversation by now as a potential starter for the Texans.  We shouldn't have needed to spend cap space on Brian Hoyer.  If Savage was any good the QB competition this year would be between Mallett and Savage; not Hoyer and Mallett"

Kevin Johnson, Rahim Moore, and Vince Wilfork will definitely bolster our defense. Along with our linebackers (Cushing/Clowney pls) getting healthy and back to form.

We also have 2 second round picks (Moore, McKinney) in our starting 11 on defense which means that 9/11 of our season starting roster is drafted in the first and second rounds:  I know that Cushing was on his way to becoming a star after 2011, and our CBs aren't Revis or Sherman but we have  a pretty high profile defense."
Texans,3bf2nq,KKG_Apok,3,Tue Jun 30 12:16:46 2015 UTC,"I live in Toronto, so I catch a lot of Bills games. They have the defensive line from hell. JJ Watt might be the best defensive lineman since Reggie White, but as a unit, the Bills' D-line is significantly better than ours. There's no shame in that though, that D-line is probably the best in the league.  The Jets are another superb D-line - I suppose it's mandatory for any AFC East team that isn't the Patriots, as they have all decided they no longer care about winning and they simply want to murder Tom Brady - and they have Revis back, and they got a great defensive line prospect in Leonard Williams, so they sure as hell aren't hurting for depth at that position.  That being said, I'd say the Texans improve as well. I am most confident about the improvements in the secondary; I think Kevin Johnson was a very good pick, and that Rahim Moore will be great at free safety. The big question mark is with Clowney and Cushing. If those guys, especially Clowney, return to form, then we could have a terrifying front 7 with an above average secondary on top of that."

On another note, it makes me really think that Bill O'Brien isn't really in it for a Super Bowl right now. I think he's taken this year to fix a substantial weakness, and next year I expect him to be on a serious prowl for our franchise quarterback. Savage, Mallett, and Hoyer are all decent, but I think it's wishful thinking to say any of these guys could lead a championship team. We will see though."

Texans,3bdbzb,DoktorStrangelove,27,Sun Jun 28 04:33:00 2015 UTC,MFW Texans fans are genuinely nice people and it isn't just my friends feeling obliged to look after me
Texans,3bdbzb,saxamaphon3,13,Sun Jun 28 04:08:36 2015 UTC,"You'll find that NFL fans generally don't give a shit where you're from as long as you want to have a good time and talk about the sport and watch a team.  It is the literal opposite of how the English seem to be about foreigners supporting PL sides, which is I guess where some of your hesitation may come from. I've been following Liverpool since the 90s but I still feel like I need to justify it to some people when I go over for a match...you can imagine how fun that is to deal with, although in general the people I meet have been welcoming.  I know it's apples to oranges and maybe I'd feel differently after 20+ years of rampant global NFL popularity re-shaping the game, but I tend to think it's bullshit how protective Brits are of their local teams that have made a conscious and ongoing effort to globalize.  Anyway...whatever, enough about all that."
Texans,3bdbzb,GingerRaceFTW,4,Sun Jun 28 07:13:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're exactly right- I don't follow a soccer team that anyone cares about but I know that ""we"" don't open up well to foreign fans so I was hoping the same wasn't true of you lot."

Texans,3bbhal,kckolbe,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:51:05 2015 UTC,"I was too young to know that was one of the potential names, that's honestly a pretty sick!"
Texans,3bbhal,kreg132,2,Sun Jun 28 04:10:11 2015 UTC,"""During this time [January 2000], a handful of team names were trademarked for potential use by the franchise, including Apollos, Bobcats, Challengers, Colt 45's, Energy, Hurricanes, Roughnecks, Roughriders, Roustabouts, Stallions, Stormcats, Texans, Texians, Toros, Wildcats, Wildcatters, and Wranglers.  On March 2, 2000, Houston NFL 2002 announced that the team name search had been narrowed down to five choices: Bobcats, Stallions, Texans, Toros, and Apollos. The list of names was determined after several months of research conducted jointly by Houston NFL 2002 and NFL Properties. An online survey regarding the name generated more than 65,000 responses in just seven days.""  That's from Wikipedia.  I didn't remember all of those names, but I was still living in Houston at the time (was 19), and I remember being stoked about the name Apollos, which had considerable support.  ALL of our teams had aeronautical/space references (Rockets, Astros, Comets, Aeros, etc) that it seemed a real given, and our uniforms would have been distinctive.  I was so pissed when Texans was announced."
Texans,3bbhal,kckolbe,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:24:04 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting, I had no idea! Those ""Space"" names seemed pretty cool so I sad that we didn't get those, but I felt we got a pretty cool logo and name in the end. I do wish we would update our uniforms, though, same with the rockets too, but each owner seems pretty stern on keeping these uniforms, but I guess tradition is cool..."

Texans,3b96sa,BisonST,11,Sat Jun 27 03:44:44 2015 UTC,My totally biased answer:  I think we'll win in Indy.   Rule of averages. I feel the Colts didn't address their weaknesses enough. We kept it competitive with a 3rd string QB who got injured at the end. Wilfork. Clowney. Moore. Healthy Foster.
Texans,3b96sa,Going_Braindead,5,Sat Jun 27 04:00:05 2015 UTC,"Sort of what you're asking for. If you go through my post history, I made a contest post on this sub for our season, in which I predict every game. I'm from the future and my results are fact so check it out"
Texans,3b96sa,iammattchambers,9,Sat Jun 27 00:41:55 2015 UTC,"I think we match up pretty favorably against the colts.  I fully expect Bill O'Brien to have learned a thing or two watching the Indy v NE tape from last year - I expect Arian Foster to do what he does best (especially against the colts). The line behind him will continue to improve - which will only keep Arian healthier, and Mallet's job easier. We have an actual formidable WR Corps (i'm not saying it's as good as Indy's - but it's more than solid.)  Add to that a defense that should feature a finally healthy Brian Cushing, and Jadeveon Clowney along with Vince Wilfork up front and Rahim Moore in CF going toe to toe with TY. (And don't forget JJ)  The only question mark for me is QB - Mallett should be more than competent to play the position at an above average level. And as long as we're getting just moderate success under center, this team should be rolling. If you think that our last game was close, I think you'll be amazed at how we look this year."
Texans,3b96sa,oorza,2,Sat Jun 27 01:32:28 2015 UTC,The only question mark for me is QB - Mallett should be more than competent to play the position at an above average level   Why do you believe this when he hasn't even been able to win the job against Brian fuckin Hoyer?

And your comment about Hoyer is misleading. Hoyer had a 10-7 record in Cleveland. And the majority of which was without Josh Gordon, an often injured offensive line, and running back by committee. It's not as if he was leading them to the playoffs or anything, but I think given the situation, he played admirably.  Now, fast forward to this year - he's in a new city, with a better offensive line, better wide recievers, a stud RB in Arian Foster, and you're puzzled how he could be so much as a formidable competitor for the starting role?  Come on homie, don't play that."
Texans,3b96sa,oorza,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:33:40 2015 UTC,"First thing, the Browns have the best pass blocking line in the AFC, if not the NFL.  He will be taking a downgrade at offensive line and TE to upgrade RB and WR, so it's probably a wash on offensive talent around him.  And he played a very, very average game.  There is no world in which I would describe Hoyer's performance last season as ""above average.""  The fact is he has so much game film and is a fairly well known commodity to the coaching staff, and Mallett isn't able to win enough of the coaching staff's faith to allow them to say something like ""It's Ryan's job to lose,"" let alone anoint him the starter.  If the coaching staff doesn't seem to think he's obviously better than Hoyer, so why should you?  I really do not understand the source of any optimism about Mallett.   Is it simply residual jock sniffing of Belichick?"
Texans,3b96sa,iammattchambers,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:39:12 2015 UTC,"If that's how you feel, then you just don't know the team.  No one is given a job that is just their's to lose. (Except for maybe JJ.) BOB believes in competition - and that's why he doesn't want to call the race just yet - it doesn't matter if Mallett is winning by a mile - it's only just begun.  And all mediocrity you associate with Hoyer are all the same plattitudes doled out last year about Ryan Fitzpatrick, and yet he proved to be more than capable of a starting role. BOB showed a willingness to adapt his offense to suit Fitzy strengths - something that those present for OTA's noted. Which is precisely why he's recieved such high praise this offseason. He's been putting in the hours on an offense he was drafted to run. I really can't believe it's so unfathomable to you that even under the best of circumstances Hoyer might be able to actually hold his own.  As for Cleveland, that whole line became much worse when Mack went down - and that's why groups like PFF graded out Baltimore and Houston's (both AFC) lines as better than Cleveland's.   Spend the day on Google, go back and watch some tape - learn a little bit about the team you want to talk about, and then come back and discuss."
Texans,3b96sa,oorza,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:23:59 2015 UTC,You did a phenomenal job attacking my awareness of the team without actually answering the question: where is the source for your optimism about Mallett?

Texans,3b96sa,oorza,2,Sun Jun 28 23:03:38 2015 UTC,Fan overanalysis of the first start of a QB's career against a team that has had no chance to analyze and prepare for him is the best you've got?  This dude is the hugest Texans homer and he's pointing out absolutely routine plays that probably 30 of the 32 starting QBs in the NFL could make as evidence he's going to be above average - and this is against an unprepared defense...   I am not convinced that this wasn't a waste of half an hour watching this.  I can probably make this exact same video about Christian Ponder's first start.
Texans,3b96sa,mistere676,3,Mon Jun 29 00:07:02 2015 UTC,"This is what I was looking for. I knew your FO had to make some sort of move to cover up TY because honestly, without TY torching you guys, you 100% would've won that second game last year. Probably the first one too. Other than that, your team is even more balanced now and that scares the shit out of me. Colts vs. balanced teams does not bode well."
Texans,3b96sa,iammattchambers,2,Sat Jun 27 02:40:21 2015 UTC,"We drafted what will be the best rookie CB in the league as well... and he's fast... our ""T.Y. Buster"" hopefully."
Texans,3b96sa,SCREW-IT,5,Sat Jun 27 12:31:11 2015 UTC,"I really hope Hard Knocks has some awesome slo-mo of KJo in coverage. He's so fluid in the tape I watched, and he seems to never waste a step.  I'm excited to see how he plays against guys like Nuk, D-Jax, and Brandin Cooks this preseason.  Edit: Grammar"
Texans,3b96sa,kckolbe,6,Sat Jun 27 14:28:05 2015 UTC,Yes.  All of them... Except QB and WRs.
Texans,3b96sa,BreezyD,6,Sat Jun 27 00:47:57 2015 UTC,"I'll take a stab at this.  TY Hilton will not shine:  This guy has torched us in past games mainly due to poor safety play and lack of a true speedster in the secondary who can keep pace with him.  We fixed both problems, drafting Morris last year (he was injured for our first game against the Colts...notice the score difference between game 1 and 2) and adding Rahim Moore as a Safety.  So not only will TY not be able to flat outrun his defender, but there will be capable help  if he does.  Gore doesn't threaten us:  Gore is not a great runner.  He's durable, experienced, and trustworthy in any role and will be a great backup, but he is no starter.  The Texans had some issues with missed tackles last year, but they were mainly nimble RBs dancing around, not power RBs knocking them over.  Between that and a healthy Cushing, McKinney, and Clowney (not to mention Vince in the middle), our run defense will ensure that Luck has to pass a LOT.  Luck will not have a lot of time: The Texans generated a lot of QB pressure last year, and this year will be even better.  In addition, our secondary is both deeper and better.  Now, Luck CAN scramble, so this may not be as significant, but Luck will not have time to stand in the pocket."
Texans,3b96sa,kckolbe,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:45:15 2015 UTC,I'm inclined to agree with most of this but Mckinney is a rookie. I would not expect him to go out and play on that level.
Texans,3b96sa,BisonST,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:31:22 2015 UTC,"McKinney is an upgrade in terms of depth, so I mentioned him, but he is definitely no Cushing or (original) Clowney"

He hasn't tried forcing many passes, he's aware of the pocket, doesn't try to run when things are falling apart, and he's had a few throws that were just on the money.  That being said, I can see the references people make about his accuracy. There have been a few throws that were definitely possible but he didn't put the ball where it needed to be, or it wasn't anywhere near it.

Texans,3b6slu,eastexaslion,3,Fri Jun 26 14:42:09 2015 UTC,Doing a potluck this weekend with friends. It's of course super-unorganized but that's just how we do. I think the Women's soccer game against China is tonight at 6:30 so I'll be rooting for our ladies.  Friends and I are trying to figure out whether we should build a DIY  brick oven/smoker in my backyard or just buy for like $150. Any of y'all have experience with this?
Texans,3b6slu,Simpleton216,3,Fri Jun 26 17:51:38 2015 UTC,"I'm a DIY all the way kind of guy!!  Why buy something already made? There's nothing unique to it, but building your own? That's going to be a story every time people are over. It's going to be a memory with the friends you build it with. It'll be a reason to not be inside all day. And it'll be a great thing to sit around and drink a few beers with some buddies when it's finished.  I don't think building one is really all that hard. I just searched ""building a smoker"" and got a page of results with guides, Youtube videos, pics, etc. I think you can do it."
Texans,3b6slu,francois_hollande,3,Fri Jun 26 13:39:05 2015 UTC,"Very good point. That's essentially where we are stuck right now.

Texans,3b2p3p,m0c4z1n,3,Thu Jun 25 19:14:19 2015 UTC,I can't imagine. During the week for me I'd eat  Breakfast  6 hardboiled eggs  1 cup of oatmeal with brown sugar  16 Oz container of cottage cheese  1 scoop whey protein with whole milk  Lunch  Roasted chicken breast  Turkey Swiss sandwich with mayo  12 Oz of baby carrots and 6 Oz of hummus  Dinner  2 roasted chicken breasts  One 16 Oz package of spaghetti   2 cups of prego sauce   1 scoop whey protein powder with whole milk  Bedtime  1 scoop casein protein powder with whole milk  That's about 4000 calories.

Texans,3b2p3p,SNSDsunny,2,Thu Jun 25 17:02:27 2015 UTC,"Increasing the amount you eat is a process, slowly increase the amount of calories you intake. It took me awhile but when bulking I'm able to consume 3300 calories with ease."
Texans,3b2p3p,edwardsamson,2,Thu Jun 25 18:51:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I was about the same weight in college and had the same issues. Simply adjusting your schedule around meals goes a long way, you end up missing a lot of caloric intake when you forget to eat, or let a meal slide here and there. I reminded myself to eat every 3 hours.. and though meal timing doesn't really matter, the regimented intervals helped.  Also lifting really heavy in a strength based program makes you really hungry too."
Texans,3b2p3p,lacrorear,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:55:31 2015 UTC,"Well the biggest problem for me is the stomach issues. Typically when I wake up I just plain can't eat for like 2 hours. I tried to force it once and puked up my entire breakfast like 20 mins later.  I train for rock climbing which SHOULD make me hungry (especially since I train before dinner) but a lot of the time I will come out of climbing with that ""full"" stomach feeling despite not having eaten for like 5 hours and climbing/training hard. On those nights I won't be able to eat for like 2-3 hours even with smoking weed to help my appetite.   Other times I'm hungry and start eating but I get that full feeling in my stomach early in the meal and can't finish it without feeling like I'm going to burst."

Texans,3aymxq,Kage613,2,Wed Jun 24 19:06:08 2015 UTC,"Even if the trades were still possible I'd be kind of against it.  Yea it's Peyton, but he's now 39 instead of 36 and he's coming off injury AGAIN.  We'd probably not have to give up as much of our future for him as in '12, but the cap hit would make it to where we could not have signed A LOT of our players.  We'd probably have made 0 other off season acquisitions.  Makes me think that if they had picked up Peyton...would Dre have stayed? D:"

Texans,3ayfu2,Athletics115,13,Wed Jun 24 14:40:29 2015 UTC,And now we need to know what Broncos were asking in return for Peyton. That will then help us determine if this could have been a good trade or not. Otherwise this is all just a waste of time.
Texans,3ayfu2,vandyriz,5,Wed Jun 24 14:47:24 2015 UTC,"Yup. And since nothing happened, neither team will ever say unless somebody goes full retard."
Texans,3ayfu2,Skarmotastic,4,Wed Jun 24 14:48:40 2015 UTC,"I heard they wanted to dump a lot of his salary. To my understanding, even post restructure, they wanted to shave an extra $10 million in cap figure.  Granted, I'm putting this together from a handful of articles I've read about this. Everything seems sketchy, but from the sound of it, taking in Manning means no Wilfork, Rahim, Cecil, or Nate. It also likely means we couldn't extend guys like Whitney or J-Jo."

Probably because it was getting alot of hits today.  Dick move.  I deleted it cause fuck them.  Feel free to message me for it.  It was basically what /u/dseals said here.  The author also mentioned some stuff about writers should not move forward with stories that have less than 3 sources. . .unofficial sources at that.
Texans,3ayfu2,LdZppln,3,Wed Jun 24 14:50:09 2015 UTC,"If these rumors have some merit,  the biggest impact to for me could be the relationship between Kubes and Manning with Kubes potentially nixing a chance to coach Peyton twice."

Texans,3ayfu2,LdZppln,2,Wed Jun 24 17:33:42 2015 UTC,"What's your take on that from Kubes perspective....given the dearth of elite QB's in the league,  how do you pass on PFM twice?   Two unrelated decisions that are indicative of a Kube's overall attitude about Peyton? A preference to work with his own guys?  I dunno...."
Texans,3ayfu2,Logorrhea_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:02:46 2015 UTC,Too many unknowns to speculate so I just make jokes.  I like to imagine he hates him for something incredibly petty.

Texans,3ayfu2,Logorrhea_,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:05:47 2015 UTC,"Less speculative,  but Kube's could be looking for more mobility and bootleg action than Peyton likes,  he didn't fit Kube's system. Plus, trying to ask Peyton to change what Peyton does isn't really an option."

Texans,3ayfu2,Legendary331,3,Wed Jun 24 15:05:17 2015 UTC,It doesn't matter anymore. This whole debacle is basically trivial trivia.
Texans,3ayfu2,coolasj19,3,Wed Jun 24 15:47:04 2015 UTC,"First the 2012 rumors and now this. All rumors and speculation, no facts.   All of that being said, the Texans need a long-term answer at QB. Peyton may have made us competitive this year (realistically I think it's the last one he has in the tank), however we'd just be kicking the can down the road in the search for our franchise QB, while putting ourselves in cap hell.  No way we're able to sign Wilfork Moore, and the other FAs as well as re-sign Jackson, Newton and Joseph, even with an underpaid Manning. I'd much prefer rolling the dice to see if Mallett is our guy going forward this year over winning 10+ games and flaming out in the playoffs with Manning."
Texans,3ayfu2,DCTexan,3,Wed Jun 24 15:46:27 2015 UTC,"To me, and this is just my opinion, the team did have these very early talks about trading for Manning, but nothing serious was ever offered. Much like the article /u/LdZppln posted, Allbright tried to turn what was essentially a ""Hey are you guys interested?"" call into a full trade proposal.  610 can confirm that the team had talks with the Broncs, but even 610 said they were ""“very preliminary” talks"" so they covered their asses on it. Essentially, there's was never a trade offer, but there was a ""Would you be interested in possibly trading for him,"" to which we probably gave a ""Yes,"" answer and then said Manning would need to take a huge paycut. The Broncos likely used that to tell Manning that he needs to take a paycut, but then Manning used that to get his no-trade clause."
Texans,3ayfu2,dseals,2,Wed Jun 24 16:01:57 2015 UTC,"Based on yesterday's reports, I figured there was definitely discussion and perhaps the Texans and Pancakes were supporting the Broncos in saving face with Manning.   If the pay cut he signed removed the no-trade clause he had prior, then the Broncos hypothetically began shopping him, if they hadn't already before the no-trade clause had been removed... that looks pretty bad."
Texans,3ayfu2,roogug,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:48:44 2015 UTC,"but....but pancakes is always right....right? 2 sources confirmed, How could this be?   where there's smoke, there's fire."

Defense I have full confidence in but offense wise outside of Hopkins, little too much uncertainty with Foster's health, who's going to line up as WR2 and WR3, who's going to be the special teams return man cause Martin blows, and too many other questions that the team is sure about."
Texans,3ayfu2,jaybudday,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:31:09 2015 UTC,"manning makes average wrs good.  all you need is hopkins.  he'll make the sanders, deckers, garcons, collies, stockleys, etc.  he'll be able to get the texans around 24-28 points togther with foster, a good rb, something he's never really had since edge. and the defense can do their part."
Texans,3ayfu2,bellsofwar3,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:36:56 2015 UTC,I don't think we would be contenders. It would have obliterated our cap and we would have stumbled into next season with a depleted team.

Texans,3avuwc,electricalenginerd,4,Wed Jun 24 01:48:21 2015 UTC,It's very frustrating. Most of the NFL writes us off like that. I feel a realistic statement is we have two top 20 Qbs. I really feel we have a top 12 in Mallett and top 20 in Hoyer. Savage may potentially be really good too!

Texans,3avuwc,balderdashed19,2,Wed Jun 24 10:06:26 2015 UTC,"I think the top 12 is pretty optimistic for Mallet, especially based of 2 games, really more like one game because we don't know the impact the injury had on the 2nd game. I would be ecstatic if he came out and performed in that range, but I don't think we can expect that out of him."
Texans,3avuwc,DCTexan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:32:59 2015 UTC,"We almost beat the Colts last season in a game where we had to play our 3rd string rookie QB. If Fitz stayed in, I bet we'd have won that game.  We currently have 3 QBs: 1 average-to-mediocre Veteran who knows our system well, 1 unknown who had a solid game before getting hurt, and 1 unknown rookie project with a lot of upside. With our D, we just need a consistent average to above-average QB to win games and threaten the Colts. We don't need an elite-tier QB.  IF, and i say IF, Mallett gets to start and proves to be in the top 50% of starting QBs, we're in good shape and win 10-11 games. If not, or if we get Hoyer, we're looking at another .500 season."

Texans,3avuwc,pawsforbear,4,Wed Jun 24 22:32:15 2015 UTC,"OK so let me preface this in saying I would take Andrew Luck on our team hands down, no questions asked.    But what the HELL have the Colts done to earn the throne when the Texans just had it, and were right on the heels of the Colts last year.  This isnt their mandate.  The Peyton dynasty is over. The Texans can grab this for real.    My biggest pet peeve is that Andrew Luck is touted as the greatest when he hasnt done anything to prove it.  They havent made it far in the playoffs yet. In the context of a 'good QB', Andrew Luck is not overrated.  In the context of GOAT, he is super fucking overrated.   Plus their defense is still trash, their running game has questions as well.  My $.02.  fuck the colts, keep that throne warm for us because we're coming."
Texans,3avuwc,BisonST,6,Wed Jun 24 18:52:30 2015 UTC,They havent made it far in the playoffs yet.   AFC Finalists is pretty far.
Texans,3avuwc,pawsforbear,-1,Wed Jun 24 19:45:01 2015 UTC,For a good qb?  Yes that's great.  For the talk Luck gets for being up there as top tier?  I dunno.   It's still early in his career and I am salty but I still feel the dude hasn't performed to earn how much praise he gets.
Texans,3avuwc,KKG_Apok,2,Wed Jun 24 19:56:56 2015 UTC,Without Luck the Colts would be 3-13 or 4-14. He's THE reason they aren't bottom feeders like the Jags have been recently. Don't underplay how good he is and how he carries the team because he does and we all wish he played for us.
Texans,3avuwc,sedibAeduDehT,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:14:43 2015 UTC,"As much hyperbole as there was in that segment, the closing statement was the honest truth; if the Texans want to be considered a real threat to the Colts, we're going to have to beat them.    As much as I hate saying it, that's something they haven't done yet. Not even when Indy sucked for luck and went 2-14. If we beat them, even once, even at Reliant, then the talk can officially be real.    I just want to see the Jags beat them this year, too. I really like the Jags and I wish them all the best. They very nearly beat us in the season-ender. I'd like to see them sniffing the playoffs or at the very least breaking the .500 mark."
Texans,3avuwc,DCTexan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:16:46 2015 UTC,"The Colts are a good, not great team with Andrew Luck. For the last two years, they have been the best team in our division, which isn't saying much. Without him, they're a 6-8 win team, tops. Their performance last year actually reminds me a lot of the 2012 Texans... they beat the teams they should beat, and lost to the good/great teams.   Losses last year: DEN, PHI, PIT *, NE *, DAL *. All but the Eagles on that list were playoff teams. * Denotes a blowout. Their regular-season wins against playoff teams were BAL and CIN.  With our defense, I like our chances to compete for the division IF our QB play is consistently average to above-average."

Based on what's already happened, it may seem like I'm behind the times but its important to note that I am, in fact, a full cycle of contrariality ahead of the pack!  BTW, thanks for dropping into our sub."
Texans,3at0l8,Logorrhea_,88,Tue Jun 23 20:32:48 2015 UTC,"Like we should give a fuck. We have the best NFL player on our team, who cares what people think. Oh and Fuck the colts."
Texans,3at0l8,Drunk_Robana,13,Tue Jun 23 09:16:19 2015 UTC,"For every circlejerk, there is an equal and opposite jerk. JJ is definitely the best defensive player in the NFL and arguably already the greatest of all time, and with it came a lot of media coverage. This has always been inevitable, and I'm actually surprised it took this long for the tide to turn.   TL;DR Fuck the Colts"

Texans,3at0l8,lpbiggie,19,Tue Jun 23 21:39:46 2015 UTC,"i thought about this after reading a thread full of JJ hate.  Its kind of like LeBron James.  Best player in his sport and has always kept it clean off the field and knows what to say to the cameras.  Sure he's had a few mishaps here and there, but nothing that bad.  However, simply because he is the best there will always be a legion of haters who just pray for him to fail."
Texans,3at0l8,trillvilletx,3,Tue Jun 23 12:51:58 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't compare JJ Watt hate to LeBron hate. A lot of LeBron hate stems from the fact that the refs seem to call everything in his favor. LeBron flat up misses a lay up, let's let him shoot 2. LeBron has no time outs, let's let him call one anyways. LeBron does his little body wiggle thing, in the process elbowing defenders,  let's pretend like nothing happened. I could go on, but I think you get the point.   Oh, and his whole 1hr TV announcement thing rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. My point is, people hate LeBron for different reasons that people hate JJ Watt."
Texans,3at0l8,AnOrangeDinosaur,9,Tue Jun 23 14:03:02 2015 UTC,"Every star in the NBA gets calls. The only objectionable thing he's done is the decision, and if that's enough of a reason for you to hate him then have at it."
Texans,3at0l8,kirk5454,4,Tue Jun 23 14:17:26 2015 UTC,"That is not the only thing at all unless you're a casual fan. He is arrogant as fuck, he disrespects his coach openly and he disrespects his teammates."

Texans,3at0l8,kirk5454,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:28:36 2015 UTC,I think it's more you have to have a general disrespect for the idea of a team and for your teammates as peers to treat yourself as Kingly as LeBron does.

He sent out a bunch of cryptic warnings to K Love.  And it appears K Love and Lebron dont get along that well either. I feel like LeBron is cool with you if you submit to his Alpha position."
Texans,3at0l8,TwoChe,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:12:54 2015 UTC,"Not every star.  Centers get fucked.  Dwight, Yao, Shaq, Cousins, they all did and do get mauled all game but get no calls.    Sexy perimeter players get their calls because they play the way the league wants them to play."
Texans,3at0l8,TwoChe,0,Wed Jun 24 19:11:21 2015 UTC,That's not the point. The point is that he gets all the calls and WHINES and COMPLAINS when he doesn't. Like he takes it a step further then most people who complain to the refs.
Texans,3at0l8,edwardsamson,3,Tue Jun 23 17:16:36 2015 UTC,"I watch a lot of NBA, and I haven't seen that at all. It's not like he's Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, or really anyone who plays for the Clippers. I haven't seen him do anything that I haven't seen James do. Could it be possible that you're focusing on what he's doing because he is the best and you're holding that against him?  I don't even particularly like Lebron. I used to hate him, but eventually I realized that it wasn't deserved and I just hated him because he's so good and doesn't play for my team."
Texans,3at0l8,kirk5454,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:32:01 2015 UTC,LeBron bitches way more than KD dude.   https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/66/0c/4f/660c4f8ae53b7a9dd47f603a536e37d3.jpg
Texans,3at0l8,TwoChe,0,Wed Jun 24 19:13:26 2015 UTC,"No its not possible because I've been watching him play for at least 5 years now and I've seen him do it time after time after time. I even saw it 10 feet away from me in person when I was sitting courtside at game 4 of the Celtics series this year (the infamous Olynyk-Love game). He probably spends 5-10 secs longer than anyone else complaining.   My problem isn't even so much the complaining itself its that he does it when he gets SO MANY calls in his favor, at least fucking take the ones against you in stride..."
Texans,3at0l8,edwardsamson,-5,Tue Jun 23 18:42:39 2015 UTC,"Let's get this straight, I don't give a shit about the decision. Other people use that as an excuse to hate him though.   Secondly, there's a difference between getting calls, and being so good that you ""can't"" do anything wrong in the eyes of the ref. Curry, Durant, Harden, Rose, and any other star I missed; none of them would be able to call a time out when they dont have one left (The Bulls are my #2 team, so maybe I'm a but salty). None of them get to shoot free throws when they flat up miss a lay up with no contact. Maybe I should hate the refs instead, but I'd prefer to hate the mile high hairline."
Texans,3at0l8,AnOrangeDinosaur,3,Tue Jun 23 14:56:29 2015 UTC,"All those players you mentioned received superstar calls. Harden, got away with a lot this past offseason. He also spent a lot of time just charging into the paint and then complaining when he didn't call.  It reads like you're hating on LeBron because you just do not like LeBron."
Texans,3at0l8,Oakley-Guy15,0,Tue Jun 23 18:16:14 2015 UTC,"Yep, hit the nail on the head. I hate LeBron and his stupid ginormous ass forehead, and terrible hairline.  But, as I've tried to convey. He seems to get phantom fouls called for him way more often than any of the other superstars. Yeah sure, Curry does the whole jump into defender to create fouls. I don't like that, but it's not against the rules. Harden goes into the paint and embellishes contact. Yes, he gets lots of phantom fouls as well, but also look how many times actual fouls aren't called for him. However, when LeBron has the ball it seems that he gets the foul every time.  He even got away with public indecency, anyone non celebrity would be put on the sexual offenders list. /s  TL;DR  LeBron is the reason I  don't actively watch basketball."
Texans,3at0l8,AnOrangeDinosaur,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:22:13 2015 UTC,"I hated him since high school....I don't know why, I think it was his face plus his arrogance.  Then the decision came, and it just added to it.  He shit on his home town on national TV.  It was just classless.  As much as I don't like the Browns, I do realize their fanbase is fucking loyal as hell.  And he did that to that city.    Plus I hate how he lowers his shoulder and bull dozes over people and doesn't get called for it.  And we all know he does PED's, but then again, so do many players."
Texans,3at0l8,VernonMaxwell,4,Sun Jun 28 20:13:07 2015 UTC,seems like you don't like superstars getting calls in the nba...news flash. they all flop and get calls. your biased against him is strong. whatever you do don't google kevin durant rip move.

He is a phenomenal player, and is nice he has a chip on his shoulder.  I am so sick of hearing about stupid shit like the cabin in the woods, or the MVP discussions, though."
Texans,3at0l8,Lobo_Marino,6,Tue Jun 23 14:12:12 2015 UTC,It's due to the offseason.  The JJ Watt circle jerk will come back around when he gets 2 sacks a game.
Texans,3at0l8,at_work_safe_acct,5,Tue Jun 23 14:40:19 2015 UTC,"Yup. Also, contrarian opinions will always take off in this set of circumstances.

Texans,3at0l8,MeowieTex,16,Tue Jun 23 22:31:39 2015 UTC,"People like to call him fake, even here people have already mentioned that he's fake nice, but actually arrogant. What judgemental bulshit. Why can't he be both? Do you have the same personality all day in every situation? I sure as shit don't. Not to mention football breeds strong personalities.   So what if his niceness is just PR. He's a product and should market himself as such.  I'm hearing lots of ""Fuck Andre"" on here in the past few days, but no one mentions all his toy donations. At the same time, those donations are a tax write off and a PR move, just like any other business. Actions can have multiple intentions/reasons."
Texans,3at0l8,oh-propagandhi,2,Tue Jun 23 13:35:17 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that those toy donations wouldn't be a tax writeoff, since he's not donating to a nonprofit, just buying toys and giving them directly to kids."
Texans,3at0l8,baudrillardwasright,4,Tue Jun 23 17:05:42 2015 UTC,"He is the non-profit...well more specifcally the Andre Johnson Foundation is who he donates to, get his tax break, then the non-profit buys the gifts.   At least, that's how I think it works. I'm pretty sure most football players do this."
Texans,3at0l8,oh-propagandhi,2,Tue Jun 23 17:57:44 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't realize he had a foundation. I guess I didn't expect that given that he doesn't have an agent and it seemed like he always just kinda showed up to toy stores randomly to do his thing."
Texans,3at0l8,baudrillardwasright,2,Tue Jun 23 20:56:57 2015 UTC,"He may not have an agent, but he certainly has an accountant. I'm under the impression that all the decent earners pretty much all have a foundation/tax haven. Then some have car washes that take all their money."
Texans,3at0l8,oh-propagandhi,13,Tue Jun 23 20:59:59 2015 UTC,I think it stems from the MVP race last year.  People were having to find ways to diminish Watts season to justify their reasons for Aaron Rodgers.  They've invested energy for Watt to not be great.
Texans,3at0l8,mylilponyranger,10,Tue Jun 23 11:16:05 2015 UTC,I remember there was one thread talking about who in the NFL you dislike most and one of the top comments was people talk about how J.J. is fake humble. I think that catapulted the J.J. hate. This was about 2-3 days ago. I cannot find the thread :(
Texans,3at0l8,MaxRationality,-5,Tue Jun 23 08:46:00 2015 UTC,"I'm a Texans fan and I think he's fake humble. There I said it, feels good."

I guess that's mildly disappointing, but does it really matter? He got where he is through an insane work ethic - the kind of work ethic that usually comes with Stannis Baratheon levels of social skills. The fact that he can put on a good guy mask for the franchise while also actually helping people (charities, special needs kids, etc) is pretty impressive when you consider it's coming from the same guy who basically goes to war with his body every day."
Texans,3at0l8,illegal_deagle,4,Tue Jun 23 13:11:53 2015 UTC,"Damn right.  I feel like both he and Russel Wilson are selling a marketable personality. And I'm OK with it.  Now, obviously, if we find out he's doing monster level shit behind the scenes, no bueno, but other than that I don't care."

Texans,3at0l8,seanchump,2,Tue Jun 23 22:04:01 2015 UTC,The Seahawks became cool to root for after Marshawn had his crazy TD against the Saints that one year and they pulled off the upset. Then it became uncool to like the Seahawks at one point. The Tom Brady train comes and goes.
Texans,3at0l8,KKG_Apok,7,Wed Jun 24 05:58:44 2015 UTC,"Same reason certain big named stars are hated, overexposure. NFL and media tend to latch onto a guy and ride him until the next big name. Sadly for them JJ is just getting started."

Texans,3at0l8,Kunt_Thunda,4,Tue Jun 23 13:09:09 2015 UTC,But people chose to believe that their idea of a cabin in the woods was like Rocky training in snow and in a remote area where no distractions can be detected. Ala savage mountain man lol. Correct me if I'm wrong though.

Texans,3at0l8,creason08,3,Tue Jun 23 19:33:51 2015 UTC,I can be unbiased.  I think it's because he's too nice to the point people think it's disingenuous. Maybe he lays his nice guy act a little too thick and it's become unwelcome. Maybe he needs to step away from the spot light.

I've had to deal with Steve Smith hate for a long time and while Smitty has done more to deserve it, he's also a great man and a fierce competitor. Just ignore it. r/nfl has to make sure they have someone to hate on for a while. They might come around, they might not. When JJ Watt is putting up huge numbers every week, the more reasonable people will start loving him again."
Texans,3at0l8,LittleDinghy,3,Tue Jun 23 17:25:20 2015 UTC,"Probably during this offseason, after he was snubbed of the MVP. Watt posts and comments were all over r/nfl (deservingly so) and people got 'annoyed' with all the attention the Texans received as a result. It is a damn sport to rip on Houston sports teams and /r/nfl remembered that this offseason.  Also, Watt does a lot of shit like any early-twenties kid. People seem to dislike that too. Honestly, I think they're just pissed that we are shaping up to have a dominant team in the AFC for years to come and no one outside of Houston enjoys a dominant Houston team.  Shit, my friends from Dallas/New York hate Houston but can't give me an actual reason. ""Just cause."" Yeah, ok there buddy."

I mean no one is going to really buy your stuff if your a boring wimp. In a way he is doing his job well off and on the field. Yet he does seem conceited because we want a normal guy too."
Texans,3at0l8,DeerOnTheRocks,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:34:22 2015 UTC,"Yet he does seem conceited because we want a normal guy too.   This is kind of the problem.  To compete at the level they are, you have to be full of yourself.  You constantly hear players say they are better than other players when it clearly is isn't true, and even though we laugh, we understand.    I think JJ is one of the greatest athletes to ever play any position, and he makes a solid effort in the community.  I am thrilled that we have him...just wouldn't want to talk to him.  Arian, on the other hand...love that guy, he'll probably have my flair pick this year."
Texans,3at0l8,kckolbe,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:00:30 2015 UTC,"Yes JJ seems to know what he is doing. He's one of the greatest.  Have to disagree with you on Arian, seems to me he is too arrogant and or conceited. He doesn't show it, but just the way he presents himself rubs me the wrong way. Sometimes acts like he is just too smart for people."

He's a great player, arguably the best, but one thing he said on Hard Knocks kind of irked me. I remember when the Falcons were having joint practices with the Texans, J.J. Watt was talking to Mike Smith and brought up Jake Matthews saying, ""Your right tackle... your little rookie. He's gonna be a good little player someday."" Adding ""little"" in there twice was a little odd."

Texans,3ar71a,Sydeffect94,2,Wed Jun 24 01:52:20 2015 UTC,"Well, yea. That's kind of the point I'm getting at. Are they using arbitrary numbers to measure how much they ""like"" a player?

I'm just having antsy FOMO over the idea that maybe one of the several QBs we passed on ends up being above the dalton line. Texans QB PTSD."

Texans,3ar71a,SNSDsunny,2,Tue Jun 23 20:28:22 2015 UTC,Neither of which is Texans QB of the future.    If Hoyer starts this season we are still in the market for a QB.
Texans,3ar71a,SNSDsunny,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:56:19 2015 UTC,"I mean, I agree. As much as I liked Fitz, we know the ceiling for both Hoyer and Fitz isn't very high at all (hence why most of us like the unknown factor in Mallett). The original question was if Bridgewater's hand size is a major factor that they weren't willing to make an exception for then that's kinda shitty."
Texans,3aq28h,fearthebeard13,11,Mon Jun 22 16:09:47 2015 UTC,"What was the most frustrating time in Houston? ""Probably the past two seasons. The year we went 2-14, Coach Kubiak being fired.

Just excited about this new opportunity now, can't wait to get it all going.""   Wait. So having a new coach and a new system was awful and unbearable in Houston, but having a new coach, a new system, AND a new town, new teammates, colors, field, fans, etc, etc..... isnt too much? O_o"

It was obvious that he wasn't happy during the last two seasons. All of a sudden, now that he says what everybody already knew, he's ""classless""? I disagree, he's being honest and nothing in that article/interview was untrue. Andre was the only shining spot for this team for a long time, a fan favorite & considered by almost everyone to be a pro on and off the field. He exemplified what you wanted as a member of your team. He was the antithesis of the T.O. or Chad Johnson diva personality. With that being said, I can understand that everyone is pissed/sad that he isn't on the team anymore (myself included) but it's as if anytime he opens his mouth or is mentioned in this sub everyone is ready to crucify him.  Edit: Spelling"
Texans,3aq28h,thekidla,65,Mon Jun 22 17:02:46 2015 UTC,"I think the major issue is that he is contradicting himself to make the Texans look bad and himself look good. I agree the hate can get a little harsh, but I'm certainly not happy with him.  He says he never complained, yet he stormed off the field before a game was over, and skipped OTAs and training camps, and his agent did the bitching for him.   He says he didn't want to learn a new system again, so his solution is to move teams and have even more to learn? Not to mention, maybe he could have learned the system better and have ""better numbers"" if he showed up to OTAs and training camps...  I don't waste time sitting around hating him, but if he pipes up about how the Texans did him wrong, I'm going to respond with a hearty ""fuck you"", then move on with my day."
Texans,3aq28h,dschneider,22,Mon Jun 22 17:37:13 2015 UTC,"To add to this, a lot of people are criticizing what Andre said in the interview, but not the questions asked by the interviewer. Let's recap, shall we?   Have you ever been miserable enough to enjoy not going to work? What parts of the business with the Texans were disillusioning to you? How does your career play out differently if you'd had a great QB your entire career? What was the most frustrating time in Houston?   As you can see, these are loaded questions that elicit a certain kind of response."
Texans,3aq28h,imgoingstag,29,Mon Jun 22 18:17:03 2015 UTC,"Have you ever been miserable enough to enjoy not going to work?   I love the game of football and consider myself lucky to be able to play the game for this long.  There have been some tough times but I'm proud and lucky to still be playing the game.     What parts of the business with the Texans were disillusioning to you?   I think all players reach a point in their career where they may be unhappy or realize their goals don't align with the goals of the front office.  The Texans made decisions on what they thought was best for the franchise and I have to respect that.  I'm just happy we were able to part ways amicably and I'm thankful for this new opportunity.     How does your career play out differently if you'd had a great QB your entire career?   It's easy to speculate on what could have been but that sort of thing doesn't do anyone any good.  I'm thankful for the career I've had and I look forward to playing with the one of the best QBs in the league in Andrew Luck.     What was the most frustrating time in Houston?   Every season has its ups and downs.  Unfortunately, the last few years seem to have been more down than up.  I'm just thankful to have this new opportunity and to get out on the field and prove that I can still play.    It's not that hard to be honest and not a dick about it."

Those are great answers and probably the perfect thing to say when you're an athlete in front of a microphone, but these are all bullshit, politically correct, P.R. friendly answers that are vague and don't tell you anything.  Andre Johnson may not have given the answers that people here liked, but I think he told the truth as he saw it. For one, his career probably would have played out differently if he had a better QB throwing his way, and he was miserable for the last few years playing here."

I guess your definition of bullshit and mine are different.   Andre played on a lot of bad teams and would have been successful as receiver anywhere. Of course he is lucky to have had a HoF career as a professional athlete - a lot of people would kill for that kind of life - but it's not as though the organization did him a ton of favours either. He's had a stretch of bad QB's throwing him the ball and he wants to be on a contending team - now he has the best young QB in the league throwing to him. What do you expect him to say? We put a mic on these guys, then we crucify them for saying what they really feel.  And yes, it is absolutely a bullshit non-answer. Instead of saying something vague like ""I love football and I'm lucky to still be playing after all these years"", he said ""Yes, sometimes it sucked to go to work"""

Going through the whole process again of having a new coach, learning a new system"" and represent that as a major complaint, the Texans were incredibly consistent in regards to that statement.

Texans,3aq28h,BisonST,6,Mon Jun 22 20:46:07 2015 UTC,"so you're saying that if you worked at a job for a decade, left to get a better job, and then took a shit on the boss's desk on the way out you think there should be NO repercussions?  You HONESTLY think you should be welcomed back with open arms at any time?  Something wrong with your medulla oblongata there."
Texans,3aq28h,mayorjimmy,-1,Mon Jun 22 18:38:18 2015 UTC,"comparing football as a profession to any other profession is faulty in my eyes.   andre's entire legacy is predicated on who is throwing him the ball, and the Texans really didn't make an effort to alleviate that issue.   and it won't matter, in 2-3 years he's still going to retire a Texan and we'll all welcome him back happily"
Texans,3aq28h,GeauxHouston22,3,Mon Jun 22 18:43:27 2015 UTC,look if he wasn't happy with who was throwing then he does what he just did.  leaves.  there's no need to trash the place after.  that's just classless.  the Texans didn't trash him.  they didn't trade him to some shit team like the Jags.  they knew they couldn't get an elite QB so they let him go and wished him well.
Texans,3aq28h,mayorjimmy,2,Mon Jun 22 19:01:02 2015 UTC,"that's true, he is def being kind of childish  I'm just a little put off by some of the posts in this thread saying like, ""fuck andre he's a pussy"" and, ""he shouldn't be allowed to retire a Texan""  I agree he's over-stepping his bounds, but I'm not gonna' hate him forever for it"
Texans,3aq28h,GeauxHouston22,6,Mon Jun 22 19:06:47 2015 UTC,"The thing that amazes me is Andre didn't really say much for most of his career with the Texans (barring the messy end). That was one of my favorite things about him. He kept his mouth shut on and off the field and just worked.   Now, he's acting like every other diva WR out there. So frustrating."
Texans,3aq28h,Sportssadness,3,Tue Jun 23 01:56:41 2015 UTC,"He needs to stay out of things that aren't his business.  I know it's most likely that reporters keep asking him the questions, but for years he made his reputation based on keeping quiet and showing on the field. He needs to stay out of the Texans business (I might be alone here) because I am losing a lot of respect for my favorite Texans player of all time."
Texans,3aq28h,dd2811,5,Tue Jun 23 04:48:47 2015 UTC,What's this dudes issue? He needs to chill. Sometimes players are on bad teams and they just gut it out and call it a day. He's had a great career (with some years left in it) and unfort it looks like he's not appreciating it. Oh well.   Eff the Colts.
Texans,3aq28h,mookiemookie,7,Tue Jun 23 00:33:50 2015 UTC,"Keep burning those bridges, Andre. That's the spirit."

Texans,3aq28h,TwoChe,0,Mon Jun 22 16:52:46 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry they couldn't get you a ring, jesus.   I think he was asking for much less than that.  He wanted a team that cared about his input, and tried to put a winner on the field.    But the truth of the matter, they were rebuilding if he liked it or not.  Same reason we traded Hakeem at the end of his career.  Always sad to see a legend go.  I hope he can forgive us and be a part of our franchise after he gets over feeling hurt and neglected.    Hopefully the Texans reach out as soon as he is retired and retire #80."

Texans,3aq28h,peccadillop,3,Mon Jun 22 16:45:09 2015 UTC,I did not mind his complaining when he was on our team for the most part I agreed. We sucked in 2013 and he had to put up with a lot. But at the end of the day it all comes down to money.   He wanted to have his cake and eat it too. McNair and Rick aren't stupid and they don't get paid to do any favors. If he hated being on our team he should have just left.. say I don't need any money from you guys I will leave and join another team. That would have been amicable and fans would not have turned on him either.   I would have been happy for him if he joined some other team but for the sole reason that he joined the Colts... Fuck him.
Texans,3aq28h,chaserjames,3,Mon Jun 22 20:42:18 2015 UTC,Oh just keep your mouth shut and try no to drop any more balls.

Texans,3aq28h,2COOL4U69,4,Mon Jun 22 17:10:09 2015 UTC,Give the guy a break.  What's he going to do - begrudgingly stay with The Colts but send us drunk texts saying he misses us?  He's there now.  Let's just build a fucking bridge and get over it.
Texans,3aq28h,thekidla,2,Mon Jun 22 22:41:03 2015 UTC,Im Alat work so  I was going to respond to a few of the other responses with something similar later this afternoon. It's a very valid point in my opinion.

Texans,3aq28h,freakybj,2,Mon Jun 22 23:50:29 2015 UTC,"Probably the biggest thing was the QB situation. People who actually think how you feel about certain things, but then when you give your opinion, they tell you something and do the opposite. That was the biggest thing, talking to you about certain stuff, and even doing contract stuff to help the team and nothing was coming of it.   Last year O'Brien said he might draft 2 QBs in a draft rich with QB talent and then waits until the 4th round to draft Tom Savage.  It's no wonder Johnson is putting the Texans on blast.  I would be mad too if I redid my contract to give the team extra cap space and those in charge did nothing with it to put together a winning team.  Don't be mad at Andre.  He's only telling the truth."
Texans,3aq28h,thursdae,2,Wed Jun 24 04:13:36 2015 UTC,I'm glad for everything he's done for us. I really am. I look forward to when he retires as a Texan. But I hope it's without a ring.
Texans,3aq28h,TwoChe,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:12:52 2015 UTC,"C'mon guys, he will be a Texan for life after he retires.  He loves the franchise and he loves the city.  He hates the current leadership that dumped him to save money and rebuild for a younger sexier WR corps.  Dont get mad at him."
Texans,3aq28h,GeauxHouston22,-1,Mon Jun 22 18:22:31 2015 UTC,"he's right, he's dead on. I know I'll get downvoted to shit for saying it, but it's true.  we went 2-14 with the best defensive lineman in a generation, so what did we do to fix that? drafted another defensive lineman then got the kid from the wonder years in the 4th as a, ""project QB"", whatever the fuck that means. Go check out the starters for every other NFL team, do you see a lot of guys that were multi-year projects? What you see is a bunch of first and second round draft picks.  I don't blame him for being butthurt, I'd be butthurt too. Every time I see Teddy Bridgewater throw a TD pass, I'll cringe thinking that we probably could've been the team to trade up for him at 32... we could've had him AND JD Clowney."
Texans,3aq28h,WeirdChi,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:22:18 2015 UTC,"drafted another defensive lineman   Can't speak for sure, just my thoughts on the matter but perhaps their reasoning behind this was: OB didn't want Teddy, and defense is a huge part of championships.   Going into the season no one expected us at 9 wins, none the less had we known we'd go through every QB on our roster. What helped those wins? Our defense. Sure Clowney wasn't here to help the first year but everyone else for the most part was. And now we got (seemingly) better on the D end and Clowney coming back is a plus.  Plus a lot of people don't really credit the 2013 draft. The draft can make or break teams and we have like 2 players left from that draft. 2 out of 7/8. Thats fucking bad, yet here we are, some plays away from the playoffs.   I hope we find out some day the reason we passed up Teddy."

He is a real person who struggled with his job situation, you know, like often happens to real people. He handled his Houston years with class  and generosity, and a bunch of myopic barcalounger jockeys kibbitzing his decisions over the internet and pissing themselves in self-interest won't change that. There are actually people in this thread writing fake bland pro-athlete talking points that he should have used instead, like that kind of insipid bullshit is somehow better than Andre answering an interviewer's questions honestly. Grow up, dudes."
Texans,3aq28h,j22x,-6,Mon Jun 22 19:27:23 2015 UTC,"Colts fan here: I think you guys take these a bit too serious. Most of these are out of context, and the media provoking with specific questions to sell papers/get clicks.    If you go watch his actual full length interviews he definitely does not sound as bad as people here make it out to be. Yeah he probably was not very happy the last few year, and this off-season exit probably did not help, so he did vent against your current coach/GM, but who wouldn't.      That said I think he still has the same respect for the team overall and Houston/fan base he always had. And I would be really surprised if he does not retire a Texan."

Texans,3ase29,EpicMindfreak,7,Tue Jun 23 03:13:48 2015 UTC,I think he is too old to be a draft steal.   He could be a good backup TE but not a steal.

Texans,3ase29,DoktorStrangelove,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:44:36 2015 UTC,"I'm in Denver, radio guys think they'll be running a ton of 2 TE sets. Virgil Green has more upside, but OD will play a ton as well. I don't expect either of them to be particularly consistent in fantasy, though. They're basically just going to be used to help spread the ball around more. Both will be effective in spurts and will help to diminish overall WR stats for every member of that corps. I'd be wary of staking a 1st round pick on any Denver WRs this year as a result...at least not a high first round pick, anyway."
Texans,3ase29,Jardun,2,Sat Jun 27 16:32:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think he will be at all, he is a backup or waiver type fantasy player. He's to old to be a reliable fantasy starter, and if you target him that way you will probably have a bad year at TE. Unless you are in a 16 man league and desperate, I wouldn't want him as my starter.  Not really sure why this is relevant to this sub though, he hasn't been on the Texans for two years..."
Texans,3ase29,iammattchambers,3,Tue Jun 23 16:36:46 2015 UTC,"Technically he bailed last offseason. (1 year ago) And frankly, I'm okay with slicing out some space for dear 'ol snakedick on the sub."

Nope. He's just the same as all the other BB castoff coaches who were all immediately recognized as lacking Head Coaching ability when they tried. Bill was never recognized for his coaching ability until he was a Patriot and he certainly wasn't noted as being on the rise for the last 20 years.  Nope. He's a winning NFL head coach and he isn't worth shit cause history."

But it doesn't line up with the evidence I've seen so far, with the exception of the QB issue, which is the biggest mystery. Of course though, I am biased by my fandom and might be choosing not to see the bad because of it.  The writer may be falling into the same Belichick obsession he's trying to hang out to dry, overanylizing and using small sample sizes to pass judgement on this Texans team that, yes, has a lot of Patriot-y things going on with it...  I am cautiously optimistic with the QB situation, and very optimistic about our head coach. The guys play their best, hell practice their best, for him.

I want Mallet to win the starting job. I don't know if he is better than Hoyer but I know what Hoyer is and I am not sure I know what Mallet is. His size, arm strength and knowledge of Bill's system make me think there is pretty decent potential for a long term fix. If it doesn't work out, we at least know we have to move on. With Hoyer, I think we have seen enough of him to know that his ceiling is too low to take this team where they/we want to be."

Texans,3aot6w,My-Names-Jeff,5,Tue Jun 23 09:49:26 2015 UTC,"Yep, and if I remember correctly they wanted a 2nd before the draft."
Texans,3aot6w,WeirdChi,6,Tue Jun 23 18:50:53 2015 UTC,It's late so only going to mention one thing    how quickly and cheaply they unloaded him    When did we make the trade? I know it was rumored the Pats wanted more than what they eventually settled for. (Like 3rd-5th rounders for him in the early talk days)  I guess it can say different things but they didn't try to sell him off cheap at first.
Texans,3aot6w,Kage613,2,Mon Jun 22 08:01:48 2015 UTC,"Late August of last year.  I looked it up after posting, and Garoppolo didn't beat out Mallett until preseason games, not training camp."
Texans,3aot6w,jcdark,3,Mon Jun 22 08:19:59 2015 UTC,"Another thing to consider is that Mallett was at the end of his rookie contract when the Patriots unloaded him, whereas Garoppolo was just starting his, so financially it made sense for them to try and trade Mallett.   Also due to having Brady, Mallett didn't see a lot of playing time, so he was more of an unknown quantity which lead to the lesser value seen from other teams. Now this doesn't mean he doesn't have the tools to be a starter, just that they haven't been prominently displayed, because, well, Brady."
Texans,3aot6w,VitaminBro,2,Mon Jun 22 12:22:19 2015 UTC,"| Mallett was at the end of his rookie contract when the Patriots unloaded him, whereas Garoppolo was just starting his, so financially it made sense for them to try and trade Mallett  This is true, but it doesn't explain why a rookie was able to make up for three years of experience in two weeks of preseason.  | Also due to having Brady, Mallett didn't see a lot of playing time, so he was more of an unknown quantity which lead to the lesser value seen from other teams. Now this doesn't mean he doesn't have the tools to be a starter, just that they haven't been prominently displayed, because, well, Brady.  Garoppolo saw significant snaps in two games his rookie year (Chiefs, Bills) despite being behind a healthy Brady.  Couldn't one also argue that his tools weren't displayed so no one would know they were crap?"
Texans,3aot6w,My-Names-Jeff,2,Mon Jun 22 13:34:25 2015 UTC,"I think you're basing this off of rumors too much.  One could also speculate that Mallett did not see as much pre-season/practice action after Garoppolo was drafted BECAUSE the Patriots were going to unload him.  Yes it could be that Garoppolo was better, but it could also be that they had no plans of keeping Mallett."
Texans,3aot6w,Kage613,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:48:06 2015 UTC,"I think that if you hold onto a guy for a while and he doesn't make the strides in his production like you want after a few seasons, you draft another guy you think that will eventually produce. But then again, they have Brady (and nobody's starting over him) so it's tough to determine if that would be the case."
Texans,3aot6w,sixout,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:30:26 2015 UTC,"True, but before last year's draft media was always talking about Mallett posssibly moving on and getting his chance out from behind Brady.  With the understanding that it would have been hard to keep Mallett with a cheap contract as back up to Brady the smart thing for the Patriots to do was to draft another back up.  Also remember this was around the same time Brady was telling the media that he would play into his 40s.  Not something a backup with eyes on a starting job wants to hear."
Texans,3aot6w,defrost24601,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:54:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it could go either way. It very well could be that Garoppolo is just better or has better potential than Mallett does, or at least what the Patriots saw. Or maybe they full well believe Tom Brady has several years left in the tank and didn't want to pay Mallett, saw talent in Garoppolo, and pulled the trigger for his replacement. Knowing full well that Garoppolo was going to be Mallett's replacement they gave him the snaps instead of Mallett. But I'm also not the GM of the Patriots, and have no clue how their organization is run. All I know is, Mallett is better than Keenum, and for the time being I'm fine with that."
Texans,3aot6w,mistuhgee,5,Mon Jun 22 18:34:32 2015 UTC,"I can agree on some points, but overall I think Mallett is a very adequate QB that could lead us to some wins.  That being said, I 100% believe that Hoyer will be our starter going into the season, and I'm completely ok with that."

It didn't take long before I started hating the Titans and I still do today. I have always hated the Cowboys and the fans like you are a big reason (the ones who rooted for the Cowboys when the Oilers left). Don't really know why but that just bothered me so much. Glad you eventually saw the light :)

After I turned eighteen and started working, I stopped following sports for a long time, until about 2010. Everyone at work was obsessed with football, so I started following it again. By that time, I had lived in Texas for almost four years...I couldn't stand Dallas or their annoying fans, so naturally, I picked Houston."

Of course, when the Texans materialized there was no looking back. Except when Vince Young came to town, but hey, we all make mistakes.   Why would anyone root for the Cowboys? Gross.

Texans,3anm55,2COOL4U69,2,Mon Jun 22 04:58:58 2015 UTC,"Grew up going to Oilers games and Astros games in the dome. Was awesome. I loved every minute of it, even when there were literally only 15,000 fans at the games at the end. Just made it easier to get field level seats and easier to get the little footballs the cheerleaders threw out.   After they left I didn't quite understand, was still very young to really grasp that Bud Adams was a total dickhead to the city. I pretty much quit paying attention to the NFL and switched my focus to the Astros and the Aggies, who happened to be playing decent around that time. I loved the Rockets, too..but my parents never took me to any games so I didn't care as much.  When the Texans came to be, my dad and I grabbed up season tickets and have been unwavering fans ever since.

Dude was a scammer and a thief as well, and last I knew he got fired from where we worked for scamming a PSP from a customer.    We're gonna hear some shit from this guy in the next year, and it ain't gonna be good. I guarantee it."

If anything, I respect his professionalism of grinding through the last 2 years, if that was what it was for him. Yes, it sucks he moved on to the Colts, but I don't begrudge the man for taking 2 years for himself at the end of his career after giving 10 HOF seasons to us.  Still though, Fuck the Colts."
Texans,3agypy,Logorrhea_,22,Sat Jun 20 10:13:54 2015 UTC,"Because he didn't ""grind"" through the last 2 years.  He pissed and moaned about everything, was the king of giving up on routes, fumbled more than he had in his entire career.   ""I don't know if I'm a Texan anymore.""  That's not the definition of grinding through."
Texans,3agypy,meatiepie,8,Sat Jun 20 03:03:47 2015 UTC,"Listen, you're right about a lot of that stuff. You're right about the holding out (in the twilight of his career and with a new coaching staff tho), you're right about some of the negative quotes he had, and you're right about the some of the effort and the drops.   Still, I know how I react after a bad month or two at my job and it isn't always so pretty. Overall, I think he did relatively good job of working through the whole thing compared to some of the other behavior I see around the league. By all accounts I've heard, the guy still came in and worked hard to set a veteran example for the rest of the team.   Past that, he's a HOF talent and I can't imagine what it must be like to watch the culmination of your career dwindle away year by year. Sure it happens to lots of players, but he's kept a lot of faith in Houston and I don't begrudge the guy using the last couple years of his career to make a run for a ring. And he did get paid well here, but he was always going to get paid wherever he went.   On top of that, I don't really have a problem with his comments. He's being understandably honest about his frustrations here...I get that. He's being understandably positive about his new team and, especially understandably, about his new QB. What do you guys want him to say? I miss the excitement of the QB carousel and perennial struggle to cobble together a winning season? Can any of us throw rocks when he compliments Luck based on our QB line up over the past 10 years? On being asked to take 1/2 the targets this year?   I know it sucks to see him on another team. I know it hurts worse cause its the fucking Colts. But c'mon, we need to be above turning on a player after a few months when he's given the better part of his career to the Texans. As Texans fans, we're better than that.   Still though, Fuck the Colts. I hope his season is a tragic disaster insofar as it helps to knock them off their cocky, no good divisional pedestal and helps us take their place. Fuck the Colts."
Texans,3agypy,Logorrhea_,12,Sat Jun 20 04:31:56 2015 UTC,Damn log I respect your opinion on this sub but shit he shouldve kept his mouth shut
Texans,3agypy,Mittens-Romney,3,Sat Jun 20 07:20:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the respect piece. Keeping a decently civilized level of informed discussion here is one of my favorite parts of this sub and I think it makes it one of the best NFL subs.   As far as keeping his mouth shut, I guess I don't know what else to expect. He's a public figure so he's always gonna get those questions. He's not saying ""Fuck the Texans"", he's saying that he felt frustrated. I'm sure he could've given some sports interview boilerplate answer about enjoying his time here and wishing us the best in the future but I don't mind his honesty.  I think you're right that he could be handling the situation a little better and I'm not saying he's perfect. I just don't get all the vitriol over the whole thing.   Ugh  /soapbox"
Texans,3agypy,Logorrhea_,3,Sat Jun 20 16:35:42 2015 UTC,he said more this offseason.. this sentence even than i heard him say the other 10 years combined. fk that.
Texans,3agypy,dismemberedalive,6,Sat Jun 20 21:32:54 2015 UTC,"He could have kept his mouth shut, but he didn't. People have every reason to lose respect for him. Crying about the situation once it's over doesn't do anything but cause people to lose respect for you, so why do it?"
Texans,3agypy,chaserjames,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:56:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think his comments have anything to do with my respect for him as a player. He's moved on, he doesn't owe the Texans anything. Plus, its not like he's badmouthing the team...he's talking about feeling miserable and I get that. That's a reasonable feeling, right?   I mean, what are the expectations here? That if he doesn't have anything nice to say he should just STFU or else fuck him and his time with the team doesn't count for shit? Do you want media figures that spout off meaningless platitudes about everything being so fairy tale perfect all the time? I'd rather have some honesty.    Ugh....this almost feels like religious persecution. Any anti-Texans sentiments are blasphemy and intolerable. The Texans organization is perfect and no one has anything but positive experiences in which there is nothing but dedication to the team and the cause. If a player has any type of negative sentiment it is clearly evidence that the fault must be with the player, that he's whiny or selfish or whatever.  I know I'm going over board here, but it really bugs me to see how quickly members of the sub are turning on a long time hero."
Texans,3agypy,Logorrhea_,4,Sat Jun 20 21:56:45 2015 UTC,"I'll put it this way.  I work in a niche industry and have moved around from shop to shop a couple times in my career. It's a pretty small group of people who do what we do so I assume anything I say will get back to any former coworkers,  so I wouldn't dream of saying anything negative about another shop, no matter how bad things got. For one, it makes me look unprofessional and two, what does it help?   Obviously they're two different situations, but the overall point remains the same. It's not like he screwed over the Texans by going to Indy, but he certainly didn't need to complain about his time with the team. The face of our franchise for years saying he couldn't stand being here is just going to alienate the same people that used to spend their hard earned money going to support him every Sunday. I'm not saying he owes anybody anything,  but that doesn't mean he should have said what he did. It's just kind of a dick thing to do."
Texans,3agypy,chaserjames,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:27:44 2015 UTC,"I think there are some important differences but I see what you're saying and I can meet you in the middle on this one. He could be classier about the whole thing, but I'm also sure there are Indy reporters pushing to get quotes like this. Still, its his choice to oblige them.   I even checked in with the wife on this one....she's on y'alls side and thinks Dre is being a ""titty baby"", to quote her exactly."
Texans,3agypy,Logorrhea_,-1,Sat Jun 20 23:17:30 2015 UTC,"People are gonna find any reason to bitch about him. If it was any other career, they would be saying what you're saying."
Texans,3agypy,gritodedolores1946,2,Sun Jun 21 01:43:24 2015 UTC,"You know what makes me sad inside? He is probably going to get boo'd when the colts come to town to get their ass beat. He doesn't deserve that, and I already feel embarrassed about it. Yeah he whined a lot the last two seasons..and cried about not getting paid when he didn't show up for work..but he could have left sooner. He stuck it out with us despite all the shitty seasons, QB carousel, and three head coaches.   With that said, I can't wait to see him fail in Indianapolis and come back to sign a one day contract to retire as a Texan."

Texans,3agypy,Not_a_Clue,2,Mon Jun 22 12:58:35 2015 UTC,"I don't hate Dre. He was stuck with shitty coaches, shitty QBs, and a clueless owner. He just needs to shut up and let his game do the talking. I wish him the best unless he's playing the Texans. That's all I got.  Longest offseason ever!"
Texans,3agypy,geezergamer,2,Sat Jun 20 02:50:53 2015 UTC,"That's his opinion. I respect him as he was my favorite Texan of all time. Dude made me feel excited about this team, and I wish him the best unless he is playing against the Texans."
Texans,3agypy,MugiMartin,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:11:01 2015 UTC,"I understand why it would've been hard in 2013 since we went 2-14.  But last year should have been different with Bill O'Brien coming in as the new coach.  My theory is that they just didn't get along.  How else do you explain O'Brien telling Andre he was only going to be used sparingly for the next season?  I think Andre had some ideas on what the Texans should do (e.g. trade last year's #1 pick back) and the coach and GM didn't listen which further frustrated Andre.    It all comes down to the Texans' philosophy that they don't need a talented QB.  They believe their system can make anybody good which is why we're seeing Bill O'Brien bringing in failed QBs from other teams and now having his 2nd annual QB competition.  I think this is completely ridiculous and is the only reason we've been mediocre for so long.  We've had shots to get some good QBs (Vince Young, Peyton Manning, Teddy Bridgewater, even Derick Carr) but we've passed on all of them to stick with what we already had.  I understand Andre's frustration with the Texans because I'm frustrated as a fan."

So they are paying out his guaranteed money early so that they can cut him worry free or just pay him his base salary to play the year.    Speaking of which, Rick has been on point dropping these solid contracts all over the offseason."

Not only that but Fred said some book spoilers for Game of Thrones a couple years ago and then told the callers to get over it.

Texans,3aev5w,Mikedela,3,Fri Jun 19 20:22:45 2015 UTC,I pretty much agree.  I like Matt Thomas mid day. I think Charlie is the smartest guy around. I'm also a mad radio fan.

Texans,3aev5w,ElxJ1991,3,Sat Jun 20 00:01:57 2015 UTC,610 is FUCKING GARBAGE almost all day.   Meltzer is about the only half decent guy there.  Lance in the morning on 790 is the best football guy in Houston and they add in good analysis of everything you want.  In the trenches is fantastic and Matt Thomas is nice and mostly lighthearted.  I would say Rusillo and SVP for afternoon but they just finished.  Pallilo is allright but probably the worst and yet the highest paid.
Texans,3aev5w,Daniiiiii,7,Sat Jun 20 21:27:06 2015 UTC,"I like Mad Radio on 610 and In the Trenches. In the Evening I just listen to music. Charlie on 790 rubs me the wrong way. The triple threat is horrible, Shawn's and Lord's voices get on my nerves and they never offer unique views."

If you get there an hour before, the lot is basically already full, and you'll be parking way at the back. We don't really do the tailgate scene any more, we just bring a sack of breakfast tacos and about 12 beers and try to consume all of it in 45 minutes, so we usually don't really care about being a bit late to the party.   If you want to have time to wander around and check out the tailgates and maybe explore what's going on outside the stadium, I would definitely recommend getting there 2+ hours in advance. If you know anyone who is doing a large tailgate, just show up at 9am...it'll be more relaxed and you'll have plenty of time to pregame and you'll be able to park really close.   Pro tips: ALWAYS find a way to remember where you parked, blue lot is probably the best lot, but it's huge and sometimes we forget where the dang car is. Also remember beer sales don't start until noon on Sunday in TX, so buy your tailgating beer the day before."
Texans,3af38m,oh-propagandhi,5,Fri Jun 19 17:13:00 2015 UTC,we just bring a sack of breakfast tacos and about 12 beers and try to consume all of it in 45 minutes   You got this.
Texans,3af38m,DoktorStrangelove,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:12:02 2015 UTC,"Also forgot to mention the airplane bottles we smuggle in with us most of the time.  But yeah, we don't usually go super early, but we do like to eat well and get a good buzz on before kickoff."
Texans,3af38m,oh-propagandhi,2,Fri Jun 19 18:15:52 2015 UTC,"We knock down some Big Gulp Jack N Coke (this takes the 1l bottle out of comission) and some whataburger breakfast.   Airplane bottles are a good idea.  I'm going to the Thursday night game this year, so I don't know what the plans are, besides calling in Friday and leaving early Thursday."
Texans,3af38m,DoktorStrangelove,2,Fri Jun 19 18:27:30 2015 UTC,"Night games are a total train wreck...maybe I sound irresponsible to casual fans, but things get a little weird when we have all damn day to drink and watch other games before we go to ours. Morning kickoffs are better for my body, that's for sure."
Texans,3af38m,electricalenginerd,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:43:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks! We've been there once before for a USA vs Mexico game, though it was a long time ago, so we had a rough idea of how busy the lot is. We'll make sure to get there an hour or two early then!"
Texans,3af38m,fib16,2,Fri Jun 19 17:28:01 2015 UTC,"I went to the jags game last season. Showed up about an hour before kickoff. I believe we parked in the blue lot and it was only a 5 minute walk. It was raining and there were puddles everywhere just an FYI. But most importantl, have fun!"

Texans,3af38m,daedas,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:10:56 2015 UTC,"Beer makes you pee, liquor is good for tailgaiting (pace yourself), then beer in the stadium. Have a good sized breakfast, food is pricey inside (papasitos by the stadium is a morning party, good grub too). There's cool stuff to do in the stadium before the game, tailgating is kinda cool, but people aren't just going to invite you to join theirs."
Texans,3af38m,omnipotentjefe,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:23:10 2015 UTC,"I would jump on the TexansTalk message board, post your story, and you're almost guaranteed to get invited to some great tailgates in the Blue lot.  Be sure to bring something to the tailgate (Beer, food, etc.) to pay for your breakfast. If you do I would probably show up 1 and a half, or 2 hours before the games start time."
Texans,3af38m,sixout,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:51:10 2015 UTC,"If you live in the right location, you can take the rail in. It'll drop you off about a 1/3 of a mile away from the stadium and you don't have to worry about parking. It does get pretty congested after a game though. I think I stood in line about 30 minutes after one match."
Texans,3af38m,Kunt_Thunda,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:09:37 2015 UTC,"Depends, do you want to tailgate? If yes, get there early. Like 8:30 early. Have fun. If it's your first time you can head in the game a little early, around 10:30 or so, check out the shop, find your seats, wander around the stadium.  Just go and enjoy the atmosphere. Blue lot passes are good, I tailgate in the blue lot. If you want to stop by for a beer let me know!"

Texans,3abcbw,PowderedToastMann,13,Thu Jun 18 18:49:19 2015 UTC,$7mil/year and front-loaded almost all the guaranteed money to this year. Very nice.
Texans,3abcbw,MVBeard13,4,Thu Jun 18 19:09:04 2015 UTC,Is it worth paying him 7 mill per when he's already 31?
Texans,3abcbw,dseals,12,Thu Jun 18 19:12:42 2015 UTC,JJo was a freakish athlete that turned into a very good CB. Now JJo is a regular athlete that is still a very good CB. He's definitely worth keeping around as long as his play keeps up.
Texans,3abcbw,PowderedToastMann,7,Thu Jun 18 19:25:13 2015 UTC,$7mil is the cost of a quality CB and he's still a quality CB. It sounds like we can cut him any time during the final two years with little problems if his play declines.
Texans,3abcbw,bellsofwar3,3,Thu Jun 18 19:14:48 2015 UTC,"Well he's worth it and there's no one else to really use the money on, so may as well keep him"

Texans,3abcbw,bellsofwar3,5,Thu Jun 18 23:34:51 2015 UTC,You don't want to pay $11m more over 2 years for a proven CB?  You don't want to have a proven CB there while  Kevin Johnson gets up to speed?
Texans,3abcbw,bellsofwar3,-8,Thu Jun 18 23:41:38 2015 UTC,nope.  most organizations would draft a cb to be a starter by year two IF they have good drafts.  IF Johnson is the real deal you just wasted precious cap room on an old back up CB.  if Joseph stays the starter you just wasted another first round pick.
Texans,3abcbw,Wham_Bam_Smash,4,Thu Jun 18 23:45:50 2015 UTC,"KJax didn't work out being chucked in early, and lots of other organisations don't play rookie CBs  We can rotate starters and that's a good thing"

Texans,3abcbw,SherlockBrolmes7,3,Thu Jun 18 19:57:55 2015 UTC,"Don't know exactly, but: 11.75m this year means average of 5.125m over the last two years, which is great value."
Texans,3abcbw,SherlockBrolmes7,14,Thu Jun 18 20:05:27 2015 UTC,"If the price is right, then I'm ecstatic.   If Rick follows this up with a Brandon Brooks extension, then I'll officially be a Rick Smith fan."
Texans,3abcbw,iammattchambers,3,Thu Jun 18 18:52:17 2015 UTC,I think he's definitely freeing up cap. I'm crossing my fingers is for a free agent pickup like Evan Mathis.

Texans,3abcbw,dseals,2,Thu Jun 18 19:32:17 2015 UTC,"I do too. But I don't think Ben Jones is doing as well as hoped. We haven't heard about him at all, but the team has tried XSF out at center, and apparently attempted to resign Chris Meyers.  I mean, moving XSF over to center doesn't sound like the worst idea. He's got good size and strength for the position, and he seems to excel in smaller spaces. Plus, he's earned a lot of praise for his limited snaps there so far.  Just saying, if he can be brought in reasonably, im not opposed to a starting line of:  Brown - Mathis - XSF - Brooks - Newton."
Texans,3abcbw,Chipaton,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:32:43 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry about not hearing anything about Lineman in minicamp, they can't block as it's non contact so we don't really know how they're doing. That's why you've also heard nothing much about anyone else either.  I don't want XSF trying to play center, he's got potential to be a great LG and that's more important if you ask me, Jones could be a good make do at Center.  I would love that line, but Mathis is getting more $$$ elsewhere with a need at Guard"

Texans,3abcbw,texansfan,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:15:12 2015 UTC,"His new deal gives him more guaranteed money over a longer period of time.  Essentially its the promise that instead of paying you $10 today, I'll pay you 5 dollars for the next three days.  Now, that example was using entirely made up clean numbers, but the gist is that the hit is smaller in the short term, but Joseph makes more over the long term. Everybody wins."

Texans,3abcbw,bellsofwar3,8,Thu Jun 18 18:47:36 2015 UTC,CB is one of those positions that take time to transition from college.  KJo is going to benefit with JJo around.

Texans,3aczx1,SherlockBrolmes7,9,Fri Jun 19 02:46:16 2015 UTC,I think it's more that the sub wanted Mallett to start rather than that he was ever the favorite.
Texans,3aczx1,David_Inhume,2,Fri Jun 19 03:26:34 2015 UTC,Valid. But why the change of heart all the sudden?
Texans,3aczx1,David_Inhume,5,Fri Jun 19 03:51:12 2015 UTC,I don't think there has been a change of heart. What you're seeing now are team sources suggesting Hoyer will start. I think most reddit people who wanted Mallett still probably do.
Texans,3aczx1,dseals,3,Fri Jun 19 03:58:08 2015 UTC,"Indeed we do, but if Hoyer wins it not much we can do about it other than cheer on the Destroyer."
Texans,3aczx1,Thebassist140,2,Fri Jun 19 04:00:22 2015 UTC,I want mallet because I believe he'll do what needs to be done to win games. He will take the risk and air it out. Hoyer will do what needs to be done to not lose games and I believe that's the difference. But I could be crazy
Texans,3aczx1,dismemberedalive,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:27:17 2015 UTC,because it was said that Bob was going to pick his guy. all the OTA news says hoyer is doing great and mallet is not. would be surprising if the guy who is not accelerating in the coach's system got the nod.  we all just want mallet because more upside more arm strength and younger.
Texans,3aczx1,VitaminBro,9,Sun Jun 21 18:58:33 2015 UTC,I'm telling you Hoyer is great in practice but sucks come game time. BOB better be able to differentiate between the two.   Source: my dad is a Browns fan
Texans,3aczx1,BublerBuddy,3,Fri Jun 19 13:39:06 2015 UTC,Come to think of it Hoyer did look great for the Browns in training camp and that did not transition over into the games.
Texans,3aczx1,lincolnhawk,2,Sun Jun 21 02:24:07 2015 UTC,"I think part of the problem may be that mallet can do the opposite and seem to suck in practice, then turn it on for games. It's not like he tore up the preseason before we traded for him last year. We all know he struggles with touch passes, and I cringe every time he nearly rifles a ball past a receiver 10 feet away. I could see an issue like that being compounded in practice such that it would annoy O'brien. I feel like it would stand out more than Hoyer's disadvantage in the intermediate/long game because there's really no excuse for it. Ultimately, any optimism for the offense this season is really rooted in belief in O'brien's system, so if he chooses Hoyer to run it I'll just support the destroyer. But I really hope Mallet gets it."
Texans,3aczx1,PowderedToastMann,7,Sun Jun 21 04:21:28 2015 UTC,I don't buy the stories that Hoyer is ahead just yet. Put the pads on and then we'll see.
Texans,3aczx1,rab7,8,Fri Jun 19 06:30:25 2015 UTC,"It's not us that changed. 4 out of 5 of us still want mallett.   Most recently, however, some sources are raving about Hoyer, especially that one tweet that said,  ""if hoyer does the same thing he did today for the rest of training camp,  expect him to be the starter.  Since we don't have access to any of their practices,  we can only go by the word of these reporters, and every small tweet that shows the slightest interest in Hoyer will of course be met by severe overreaction.   That being said,  of the 80% of us rooting for mallett,  I think 99% have the opinion, ""BOB is smarter than me,  and I will support who he supports"""

Texans,3aczx1,OmgItsTheWams,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:13:47 2015 UTC,it does seem like when someone leaves Cleveland they perform well I am guessing he is a solid qb just surrounded by a complete shit show in Cleveland
Texans,3aczx1,Chicagazor,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:47:06 2015 UTC,"Quite the opposite actually, I strongly believe that Cleveland was a decent QB away from the playoffs last season. Overachieving receivers and a strong run game really bailed Hoyer out during the first half of the year. When our run game fizzled out due to a combination of defences stacking the box and us eventually relying on our 4th string center, we saw who Brian Hoyer really was. He's got guts and is capable of sucking for three and a half quarters only to pull a miraculous game winning drive out of his ass in the final minute, (see tape on the Atlanta game last year) but he's not the kind of QB that has the talent to step up to the plate and constantly win unless everything else is going perfect around him. Watch tape on the Colts game from last year where our defence dominated Andrew luck all day and all Hoyer had to do was pick up a few first downs in the second half instead of 476377930 3&outs and you will see the real Brian Hoyer."
Texans,3aczx1,bellsofwar3,0,Sun Jun 21 13:36:56 2015 UTC,like i've been saying all along (and being downvoted) hoyer is just better.  mallet is not good.
Texans,3aczx1,freakybj,-2,Sun Jun 21 19:00:52 2015 UTC,"I will be so sad if Hoyer is named starter.  It may start off well, but he'll inevitably fail like he did in Cleveland.  And if Hoyer starts that means Mallett is even worse.  We would need our defense to have a historically great season if we want to make the playoffs.  That's why I'm predicting the Texans to win only 5...maybe 7 games this year if Hoyer starts."
Texans,3aczx1,freakybj,4,Fri Jun 19 13:24:24 2015 UTC,Most people think Hoyer blows and I don't get it. He's obviously not Tom Brady but he doesn't suck enough to lose us 4 more games than Ryan Fitzpatrick.
Texans,3aczx1,freshproduce,0,Fri Jun 19 13:42:53 2015 UTC,"It's not that he blows...it's that we know he's not the long term answer just like Fitzpatrick wasn't the long term answer.  If Hoyer starts we'll be asking the same question next year, ""What are the Texans going to do at QB?""  I'm still clinging to the hope that Mallett is actually a good QB, but only because we haven't seen him play that much.  And unless Mallett has a breakout year, we are not going to the playoffs."
Texans,3aczx1,the_sloppy_J,4,Fri Jun 19 13:56:59 2015 UTC,"But we almost made playoffs last year with a QB carousel. I mean, not to knock on Fitzy, but our defense (and Foster who was injured/missed a few games) almost carried us to playoffs. If we can just get some consistent QB play, I think we stand a good chance. Our D has only gotten stronger this offseason."
Texans,3aczx1,rab7,2,Fri Jun 19 14:29:42 2015 UTC,"I think people are tired of almost doing things, we want a long term solution that can solidify our playoff chances and give us hope for a Super Bowl. Hoyer doesn't exactly do that for me, personally. I'm open to giving him a shot, though."
Texans,3aczx1,kckolbe,3,Sat Jun 20 01:25:49 2015 UTC,"Ok, but the fact that he isn't the long term answer doesn't mean he'll only get us 5 wins"

Texans,3a8l2r,Occams_Lazor_,10,Thu Jun 18 02:11:23 2015 UTC,"How tough/physical were the offenses under Kubiak?    Kubiak's offensive lines were smaller and use more movement than most run-first offenses, play action plays can be as smooth as butter, and good TEs destroy in his system. I don't consider his offenses' physical because when the play calling got predictable, it collapsed quickly. What I remember most is how Kubiak rarely allowed Schaub to audible. I wonder how much freedom he'll give Manning.   What would you say Wade Phillips is really good and really bad at?   Defensive lines, installing a new scheme quickly. Our defense turned around immediately when he joined, and players really seemed to like him. Our secondary was pretty bad and very sloppy."
Texans,3a8l2r,CrazM,13,Thu Jun 18 02:51:26 2015 UTC,"Wade has a problem too in that his defenses aren't great against elite qbs. Lots of pressure and blitzes will terrify and disrupt the gabberts and lockers of the league, but guys like Brady and manning read them with ease and can make the fairly quick easy pass to the guy who only has a man on him. It's also very dependent on turnovers and that can be hard to do if the blitzes aren't scaring the passer into bad plays"
Texans,3a8l2r,no_one_knows42,2,Thu Jun 18 05:15:04 2015 UTC,Great Analysis! Couldn't agree more. Risk/Reward is so high with in regards to his blitzing scheme. All the elite QBs had their way with us. Remember that one seasons on National TV Rodgers lit us up at home and then later that season when we released the varsity jackets before the Pats game.. Brady went off.
Texans,3a8l2r,bullsonparade13,6,Thu Jun 18 12:30:27 2015 UTC,Realistically Kubes probably learned from his mistakes here so don't be as freaked by the answers you'll recieve.    I would say under Kubes the team was soft. It showed big in 2012 when the Texans got blown out three times by elite QBs also in 2011 when the Texans couldn't beat the 2-14 Colts at Lucas Oil. What I put here applies to Kubes as well as Wade. Both put together really good squads on both sides of the ball but it appeared they never changed over time so they got predictable and exploited (2013 when the team went 2-14). Next year the Broncos as a whole will be awesome but if Kubes hasn't learned to adapt... in a few years there is a good chance you'll see a nightmare scenario. Edit: Also I'd say Kubes isn't the type to inspire the team to follow him in tough games so unless you're confident in the leaders on the team that could prove to be a challenge.
Texans,3a8l2r,Mittens-Romney,6,Thu Jun 18 02:44:58 2015 UTC,2011 when the Texans couldn't beat the 2-14 Colts at Lucas Oil.   Fucccccccckkkkkkk that game.  Had the most depressed feel after that.
Texans,3a8l2r,WeirdChi,2,Thu Jun 18 04:56:31 2015 UTC,"Well that's a bit of a bummer.   Joel Dreessen, if you remember him, played for Denver and Houston, and said that while he liked Fox as a person, he loved Kubiak to death and even said the guys ""wanted to bleed"" for him or something like that, and that he could really pump the guys up before games. Sounds like he could have just been hyping his guy up., which sucks because I was expecting a really rough and tumble offense this year.    I'm hoping that Manning rubs off on him and Kubiak gets a little more adaptable."
Texans,3a8l2r,Mittens-Romney,2,Thu Jun 18 02:53:27 2015 UTC,Yeah I wouldn't worry about it too much. I'm sure Elway had a good talk with him about predictable play calling. Also his guys liked him because he was loyal to them even when they weren't good enough to start. Don't get me wrong Denver will be good next year it's 2-3 years from now is when you might worry.

Texans,3a8l2r,iammattchambers,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:46:58 2015 UTC,Not crazy optimistic but not pessimistic either. I cautiously expect him to do well but understand that is a huge question mark.
Texans,3a8l2r,iammattchambers,2,Thu Jun 18 13:19:21 2015 UTC,"Well, he should be a good fit for Kube's offense though."
Texans,3a8l2r,bullsonparade13,6,Thu Jun 18 14:48:11 2015 UTC,"Hey Broncos Bro!  As far as Wade's concerned, I'd say that his strength is (allegedly) getting at the QB. You guys should expect to see a lot of prescribed speed rushes from Miller &amp; Ray. Wade likes his outside Linebackers to play a lot of contain, but thankfully, you should have two guys who can do that pretty well. In the meantime, Wade will have DeMarcus Ware and Antonio Smith going full time after the QB, which, IMO should fill out a pretty scary pass rush. They'll have a little extra time to get to the ball because Wade will command Talib and Harris to exclusively play man in 100% of the snaps they'll play.  However, his biggest weakness is predictability. Wade's method does work with the right supporting cast, (which I think he has in Denver) but quality offensive coordinators will give you fits opening up their receivers with rub routes and check downs."
Texans,3a8l2r,FansView,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:20:57 2015 UTC,"That's comforting. It seems like Phillips is the best DC Denver could have, provided we actually do have all the needed parts. Two (Roby makes three?) good man corners, strong pass rush like you said, good ILBs..."
Texans,3a8l2r,VitaminBro,3,Thu Jun 18 03:29:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Wade asks a lot of his ILB's. He'll throw in a blitz here and there, but mostly, he'll want them to cover the underneath routes from TE's and RB's. They are completely what holds your defense together. Our defense in Houston was completely different with and without Cushing. It was crazy how much less efficiently it ran. (Be wary of the injury bug - it follows Wade EVERYWHERE.)  By the way, I noticed that I didn't answer the Kubes question. I'm sure you guys are seeing a lot of info about his offenses, but there's a lot of misinformation out there describing it. I'd highly suggest that you read this article"
Texans,3a8l2r,jesusjwatt,4,Thu Jun 18 03:43:14 2015 UTC,All I need to say and I am sure a lot of my fellow texans will agree... get ready/prepare yourself for hb draws and sweeps on any third down that is greater 5 yards.  So with that said... kubes is made soft on offense.
Texans,3a8l2r,trillvilletx,3,Thu Jun 18 12:28:12 2015 UTC,Kubiak's offense is very reliant on the run and play action. It's a good system if ran right. Very difficult to differentiate between plays because a lot of them look exactly the same (run and play action look the same so play action is extremely effective).  Wade Philips defense is good if you have good man to man corners. Very aggressive up front but it always got ripped up against elite quarterbacks
Texans,3a8l2r,drippydick,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:20:49 2015 UTC,"Kubiak did a great job in Baltimore turning around their run game. If Denver has a strong run game, Manning becomes that much more dangerous.   In Houston, the players loved Kubiak. He's not a ""rah rah"" coach like Pete ""throw the ball on the 1 yard line"" Carrol.   Kubiak is guilty of conservative play-calling. ""Conserviak"" may be a little more loose with Manning though."

Texans,3a7gf7,PanicHouse,13,Wed Jun 17 23:03:06 2015 UTC,"Can you just look at this smug bastard. He is so full of himself it's not even funny. Motherfucking mister righteous indignation over there, JUDGING OTHERS AND PRETENDING TO BE A 'GOOD' BOY. He's so fucking over the top about this shit, it just gets on my nerves. Motherfuckers act like he is god around here. I just feel like I am the only one who is fed up with schtick, amirite guys!?!?  Was that good enough?"
Texans,3a7w8e,toldyouanditoldyou,4,Wed Jun 17 22:39:26 2015 UTC,"Look guys you're both awesome, now let's go win a championship."
Texans,3a7811,slowcassowary,2,Wed Jun 17 19:44:36 2015 UTC,I'm excited to see CJ develop. I think his size will make him a great red zone threat.   What's this about MJD? Did he show just to practice?   I'm disliking the qb news. Nuff said
Texans,3a7811,electricalenginerd,3,Wed Jun 17 20:24:53 2015 UTC,"I'm disliking the qb news. Nuff said   We may not be liking it this year, but all signs point to Savage possibly making a run for the starting job next year which I think is awesome news. It not only means things may be better next year, but also that our staff can actually develop a QB which is not always a given."
Texans,3a7811,givememoreluisplease,2,Wed Jun 17 20:43:57 2015 UTC,"That's very true. If our staff can develop QBs we may never fall into qb hell again! AND when savage is ready, he will have one hell of a team to play with."
Texans,3a7811,electricalenginerd,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:57:48 2015 UTC,BOB got Fitz the best season of his career and got Case Keenum (of all people) the wins Kubiak could never get. I think this staff can develop a QB. It's which QB gets the privilege is the real question.
Texans,3a7811,Checksbounce,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:43:18 2015 UTC,I would say this staff made alterations to make sure those QBs succeeded. There is difference between that and developing IMO. But regardless we both believe in this staff and that in itself is exciting for us fans.
Texans,3a7811,givememoreluisplease,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:06:09 2015 UTC,"I'm so excited for the growth we're all expecting this year.   Not only should we see improvements in his like Fiedo, XSF,  and Blue, but having Clowney and Nix healthy should make our front 7 even scarier. And when you add in this year's picks - it looks even better."
Texans,3a7811,iammattchambers,2,Wed Jun 17 20:34:16 2015 UTC,"I know, we get essentially 2 draft classes in 1 year. Our salary cap situation should be solid over the next few years if we are able to develop cheap, young talent to replace FA."

Texans,3a7811,electricalenginerd,4,Wed Jun 17 20:59:17 2015 UTC,I'm excited for our secondary - I think our defensive roster is the most complete is probably ever been.
Texans,3a7811,iammattchambers,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:29:12 2015 UTC,Oh me too! I also have a really really good feeling that Hal will excel at the safety position should we move him there. He's got pretty solid awareness and amazing hands.
Texans,3a7g8l,TwinsBasilTwins,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:43:04 2015 UTC,Not much from Labhart and EZ lately. Think they're gone come Week 1?
Texans,3a7g8l,BisonST,2,Thu Jun 18 01:56:16 2015 UTC,"There's just too much competition at WR. Those guys have been on the practice squad forever, if they haven't turned a corner by now, it may never happen."
Texans,3a7g8l,VitaminBro,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:36:16 2015 UTC,"I definitely think EZ will be gone. With Chandler Worthy and Kieth Mumphery turning heads, EZ speed will not save him. Labhart will more than likely be on the practice squad again as insurance, but no way he cracks the 53 unless Strong gets the IR treatment for his rookie year AND they carry 6 receivers for the year  1.DeAndre Hopkins  2.Nate Washington  3.Cecil Shorts III  4.Damaris Johnson  5.Jaelen Strong  6.Kieth Mumphery"
Texans,3a921t,mementori,3,Thu Jun 18 04:50:59 2015 UTC,Kind of related but yesterday I got a nice -20 comment in the CS:GO sub for thinking Football Manager 15 was something like Madden (or Front Office Football). Its the soccer version of Front Office Football. And because apparently saying soccer and getting the 2 sports confused is almost as bad as Hitler. I had one guy being like WHY WOULD YOU EVEN THINK FOOTBALL MEANT THAT IN THE TITLE when the American football version of it (Front Office Football) literally has football in its name! I got downvoted for pointing that out too. Ugh I didn't realize how many Europeans were in that sub. 'Futbol' elitists are the worst and make us football fans out to be the bad ones for innocently like a different sport with the same name =/  thats my Front Office Football story lol sorry

Texans,3a921t,SpawnDnD,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:26:20 2015 UTC,I used to love that game but the holdout systems are really broken.  I would still jump in on this though
Texans,3a921t,kckolbe,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:13:35 2015 UTC,"i wish!!  desperately want to try this game out. I love football manager series so this sounds right up my street. But i cant justify the cost, albeit small, wit my current cash flow situation/responsibilities.  I'm praying for a demo, and then i know i wont be spunking cash that i cant justify to blow on a game when ive got so much other things i should spend it on."
Texans,3a61r4,toldyouanditoldyou,11,Wed Jun 17 14:43:07 2015 UTC,"Mohammed just keeps making the news. I know people love to shit on the Texans drafts but you can't tell me their scouting department is not good with the consistency in which they uncover gems, especially lately."
Texans,3a61r4,givememoreluisplease,3,Wed Jun 17 15:00:20 2015 UTC,"No mention of Hoyer's performance even though PDS was raving earlier.    This either means John Harris doesn't want to talk about it for some reason, or PDS was trying to generate controversy. Which is more likely?"
Texans,3a61r4,rab7,4,Wed Jun 17 15:24:44 2015 UTC,"He didn't dedicate a bullet to gushing about Hoyer, but Hoyer's name shows up three times, and every time it's very positive."
Texans,3a61r4,Quadrophenic,2,Wed Jun 17 15:46:57 2015 UTC,We're either much better off at QB than the general public thinks or putting a lot of fluff out... opinions?
Texans,3a61r4,mistere676,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:53:28 2015 UTC,I think it has more to do with the offense in general being better in year 2 of the system.
Texans,3a61r4,givememoreluisplease,2,Wed Jun 17 19:58:13 2015 UTC,I want to see Morris do well... he showed some potential last year before he got injured.
Texans,3a5j92,TwinsBasilTwins,12,Wed Jun 17 11:50:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to click the article... but guess he used the word ""consistency"" as he has been, well, consistently since the start of OTAs."
Texans,3a5j92,mistere676,3,Wed Jun 17 13:43:27 2015 UTC,BINGO!! You're good.
Texans,3a5j92,electricalenginerd,5,Wed Jun 17 14:40:59 2015 UTC,JJ 4 QB!
Texans,3a5j92,wireguy17,2,Wed Jun 17 13:49:18 2015 UTC,"I haven't been following OTAs very closely, but I read the title of this post and thought ""consistency"". I am not usually critical of our coaches or our team, but I can tell you that I'm growing kind of bored of the ""hard working guys, consistent, versatile"" mantra that BOB has been peddling and driven into all of our guys. No shit we want our guys to play hard and be consistent and versatile.   I will be cool with all of this if we have a winning team this season, but I have been bored to tears this offseason."
Texans,3a5j92,TraylaParks,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:13:01 2015 UTC,so say we all
Texans,3a5j92,jesusjwatt,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:56:47 2015 UTC,Its the right thing to say. Obviously we want the best most consistent player.

Texans,3a5j92,geezergamer,3,Wed Jun 17 13:17:53 2015 UTC,"It's going to be. It sounds like BOB wants a game manager. If true, then why get Mallet in the first place?"
Texans,3a5j92,BisonST,9,Wed Jun 17 13:39:05 2015 UTC,Because he got Mallett before he got Hoyer. Then he had a competition to see who'd be the QB.  BOB is good but he can't see the future.
Texans,3a5j92,electricalenginerd,5,Wed Jun 17 14:30:58 2015 UTC,To be a backup who knows the system. Put yourself in bobs shoes. Do you want case or mallett?
Texans,3a5j92,iammattchambers,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:54:46 2015 UTC,But is that all Mallett's going to be? A high quality second stringer?
Texans,3a5j92,electricalenginerd,2,Wed Jun 17 20:35:21 2015 UTC,"I'm really hoping he's the chosen one, but it doesn't sound like it from the news out of camp. I was also talking about last year why he picked Mallett."
Texans,3a3gru,dd2811,35,Tue Jun 16 22:48:54 2015 UTC,"To me, I don't really care who is the starter as long as they perform well."
Texans,3a3gru,BanterWithTheLads,7,Tue Jun 16 23:10:31 2015 UTC,You should care because we are turning into the Browns with our QB rotation.  No one wants to be the Browns. Taking it one step closer with Hoyer. I feel like this QB search will continue for a very long with no real answer. Kinda like... The Browns.
Texans,3a3gru,zebtacular,16,Wed Jun 17 09:31:58 2015 UTC,"This is different because we aren't drafting 1st round quarterbacks over and over again based on poor scouting (sometimes I feel like they just watch party to the draft or some other media bass ranking).  Hoyer could be fantastic in a good system with good coaching, a good run game, line, and targets."
Texans,3a3gru,IUMaestro,2,Wed Jun 17 09:45:48 2015 UTC,"Hoyer is what he is though and thats not very good. Hes basically another fitzpatrick, but at least fitz had some fieriness and passion that made you love him anyway. And he couldnt even be a good game manager near the end of his browns career.  This is terrible if true. I guess best case its another ""punt on our qb situation"" but what exactly is our plan if we keep drafting mid round and only sign aging ""game manager"" qbs? I dont want to keep going 8-8/9-7 occasionally squeaking into the playoffs because  JJ watts is GOAT. I want an actual super bowl run.  I think this unfortunately says something about Mallet. I dont know if hes the answer to our qb problem but he at least (seemingly) has the chance to be, unlike hoyer or fitzpatrick. If whatevers hes doing out there in practice is enough to make BoB move toward Hoyer than it must be pretty ugly"
Texans,3a3gru,no_one_knows42,5,Wed Jun 17 13:18:17 2015 UTC,I don't care if we swap QBs every game as long as  it results in a playoff run.
Texans,3a3gru,GeeWarthog,21,Wed Jun 17 11:59:27 2015 UTC,I don't mind if Hoyer starts if and only if he's far better then Mallet in our system. If it's close it should be Mallet
Texans,3a3gru,MVBeard13,15,Tue Jun 16 23:10:06 2015 UTC,Can you imagine how the NFL will react if we have a 12 win season under hoyer?
Texans,3a3gru,electricalenginerd,19,Wed Jun 17 00:03:43 2015 UTC,At least then we'll know for sure OB is the 2nd coming of Belichick
Texans,3a3gru,dseals,6,Wed Jun 17 01:53:01 2015 UTC,I can't wait until the Pats game this year!
Texans,3a3gru,electricalenginerd,13,Wed Jun 17 02:18:05 2015 UTC,"The winner beheads the loser while shouting ""There can be only one!"""
Texans,3a3gru,paulwhite959,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:39:54 2015 UTC,And if Hoyer fails then we really need to start questioning how far we can get with BoB
Texans,3a3gru,My-Names-Jeff,8,Wed Jun 17 10:56:17 2015 UTC,"If Hoyer fails I think the question is ""What the hell is wrong with Mallett"" and not on BoB. You can't be ready to throw your head coach under the bus after 2 seasons. 4 seasons of no results though, then yes it's time to question him. But not after only 2.   Coaches need time to build and establish their system. We'll know how far OB can take us by the end of his 4th season."
Texans,3a3gru,dseals,2,Wed Jun 17 16:01:26 2015 UTC,"2 seasons and mediocre QB play from scrubs when you pass up some great talent in the draft.   Yeah I say you can start to question BoB.  Not saying he needs to be fired if that happens, but I do think he needs to figure it out quickly."
Texans,3a3gru,My-Names-Jeff,2,Wed Jun 17 16:27:27 2015 UTC,"Great talent being 1 year wonders Carr, Bridgewater, and still unproven Garoppolo, with an overdrafted Bortles? I'll trust the QB guru to know when he's found his guy.  We don't know what kind of talent we passed up in the draft yet. For all we know, Bridgewater could regress along with Carr, Garoppolo could be an overhyped 2nd year player, and Savage is legitimately a good QB. It's far to early to say OB has passed on great draft talent yet."
Texans,3a3gru,dseals,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:14:57 2015 UTC,"Just saying that if after 2 years the QB situation is still shit then yes I think us fans have the right to question him a little.   Not calling for his head, but it will be 2 wasted seasons at the QB position with back up quality players.   However you wouldn't have to worry about the fans questioning BoB, the media will do it first.   For the record I want Mallett to succeed."
Texans,3a3gru,My-Names-Jeff,5,Wed Jun 17 17:55:48 2015 UTC,Because 16 games is a great way to assess a coach. Isn't that what the Browns do too?
Texans,3a3gru,PapaLRodz,0,Wed Jun 17 16:04:43 2015 UTC,"Or 32,but whatever.   Spin it how you like."
Texans,3a3gru,My-Names-Jeff,8,Wed Jun 17 16:17:10 2015 UTC,If Hoyer can do better than Fitz we should be in good enough shape right?
Texans,3a3gru,Kunt_Thunda,11,Wed Jun 17 00:44:10 2015 UTC,"If Hoyer can give us 10 wins, then I'm not complaining. If he only gets us 7, then I'm going to be loudly complaining."
Texans,3a3gru,dseals,10,Wed Jun 17 01:54:41 2015 UTC,"I just don't want a qb who loses us the game, keep us in it. If our qb is a complete neutral impact I'm happy. Anything positive is bonus."
Texans,3a3gru,onlytruth_Nmyopinion,8,Wed Jun 17 02:15:51 2015 UTC,"I don't want a neutral impact. I want a QB that can win us games, which is something Fitz could only do once. If Hoyer can't improve on Fitz's performence, then I'm not happy with that."
Texans,3a3gru,dseals,7,Wed Jun 17 02:20:55 2015 UTC,"If Hoyer does worse than Fitz I'll be pissed we traded him away with a pretty cheap contract. I might be biased though because, for some reason, I fucking love Fitzy."
Texans,3a3gru,Checksbounce,6,Wed Jun 17 03:13:53 2015 UTC,"He gave every game all he had. It wasn't enough, but god damn it I loved watching Fitz play his heart out."
Texans,3a3gru,dseals,6,Wed Jun 17 04:39:06 2015 UTC,"""EVERY PLAY LOOK TO ME!"""
Texans,3a3gru,Checksbounce,7,Wed Jun 17 04:53:21 2015 UTC,"""I'M NOT A MAN OF MANY WORDS,  BUT THIS GAME MEANS SOMETHING TO ME!"""
Texans,3a3gru,The_Mills,2,Wed Jun 17 06:58:31 2015 UTC,He is my favorite QB we have ever had. I think of Gene Hackman in The Replacements. He has heart!
Texans,3a3gru,WiggsMagoo,2,Wed Jun 17 18:26:58 2015 UTC,"I hear ya man.  I'm hoping he starts for the Jets and makes the playoffs, or at least gets a winning season."
Texans,3a3gru,kckolbe,3,Wed Jun 17 12:02:00 2015 UTC,"Fitz had basically the best season of his career, and we had a killer defense who finished #1 in turnovers (unlikely to be replicated). Tie that in with last seasons easy schedule (granted ours this year isnt bad either) along with Andre johnson leaving and i dont see hoyer taking us beyond 9 wins.   He at least looked good last season early on, but after awhile he couldnt even be a game manager and was throwing picks all over the place. If we're not going with mallet for whatever reason i'd just as soon have kept fitz. At least he has heart"
Texans,3a3gru,no_one_knows42,6,Wed Jun 17 13:23:34 2015 UTC,If Hoyer is the starter then that means we don't have a QB of the future in Mallett. Which means we just have to continue this carousel of trying to get by with average QBs and that sucks :(
Texans,3a3gru,BaconYourPardon,9,Wed Jun 17 17:08:21 2015 UTC,Meh.  Though i'll trust in what OB decides. Every fan at this point just wants to find that guy and not be stuck in QB hell
Texans,3a3gru,WeirdChi,6,Wed Jun 17 00:05:14 2015 UTC,Obviously not a better Coach than OB1 but damnit I want Mallett
Texans,3a3gru,SherlockBrolmes7,7,Wed Jun 17 00:15:37 2015 UTC,I feel like we'd be going from Fitz to Fitz 2: Electric Fitzaloo. Hoyer isn't the answer.
Texans,3a3gru,jebedia,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:51:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly if Mallett isn't the answer then we are screwed.   Waste of two years looking for a decent QB off the scrap heap.     If we start Hoyer I have this sneaking feeling that come week 8 or 9 we will be just in it, but very close to being out of it.   Much like last year.   Not saying Mallett will get us 12 wins, but I am pretty sure Hoyer can't."
Texans,3a3gru,My-Names-Jeff,2,Wed Jun 17 11:00:52 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Hoyer also can't get us 12 losses.  Mediocrity has pros as well as cons."
Texans,3a3gru,kckolbe,3,Wed Jun 17 12:00:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly is there a difference in 4-12 and 9-7 if you miss the playoffs with both records.   Sure 9-7 might be a more fun ride, but it still just as shitty.   A decent QB on this team is probably the difference in at least 2 games.   That could make for 11-5 season instead of 9-7."
Texans,3a3gru,My-Names-Jeff,3,Wed Jun 17 12:20:32 2015 UTC,"We disagree.  I completely understand the point, but the ride matters to me a lot.  I will point out that 9-7 almost made the playoffs last year, though."

Texans,3a3gru,roogug,-1,Wed Jun 17 02:55:11 2015 UTC,Problem is we are 2 years into BoB reign.   Do we really need to be going down the same path ad last year? If anything we should be year 2 of developing our future guy.

Texans,3a205w,Maxmoxie,3,Wed Jun 17 00:29:56 2015 UTC,Like 90% of our coaching staff is from the Pats. As is our QB.

Texans,3a2lkb,Checksbounce,3,Wed Jun 17 03:17:53 2015 UTC,Good to see Jaelen out there.
Texans,3a28vj,givememoreluisplease,5,Tue Jun 16 17:39:24 2015 UTC,I liked that Graham is actually doing something. Maybe he'll show he was worth that contract this season.
Texans,3a28vj,Zaracen,2,Tue Jun 16 18:07:37 2015 UTC,I think he will. I think the entire TE group will show up this season because all of our QBs will understand the offense better than last years group and actually utilize all of their options.
Texans,3a28vj,Quadrophenic,3,Tue Jun 16 18:14:07 2015 UTC,"It seems Hoyer actually has a chance to win the starting job. I feel a little let down about that. We'd be dealing with another stop gap QB.   Regardless of what Keshawn shows I really don't think he makes the 53 this year. Simply isn't space on the roster for players who have shown that their ceiling is mediocre, at least the way BoB manages it."
Texans,3a28vj,Zaracen,7,Tue Jun 16 17:51:18 2015 UTC,"I feel a little let down about that   I don't get this.   If Hoyer beats Mallett, it's because he's the best QB on our roster."
Texans,3a28vj,edwardsamson,13,Tue Jun 16 18:03:33 2015 UTC,I think it's more that we've seen Hoyer's ceiling and not Mallett's and Mallett's could be much higher. I won't argue when O'Brien names his starter.
Texans,3a28vj,VitaminBro,7,Tue Jun 16 18:07:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly as u/Zaracen said, if Hoyer wins he'll be a stopgap QB, but if Mallett wins our QB carousel could be over. Thats why I'll be let down, not because I have something against Hoyer."
Texans,3a28vj,riotupfront,2,Tue Jun 16 18:12:30 2015 UTC,Who knows maybe we do need a stopgap while we wait for Savage. Sounds like the only thing he needs to work on is throwing the ball. Could be ready next year.
Texans,3a28vj,My-Names-Jeff,2,Tue Jun 16 21:07:46 2015 UTC,"Either way if Savage or Mallett turns into the guy I'll be happy because they have time on their side. I believe Savage was still suffering from decision making not so much his throwing ability, which can be worked on and fixed given time, I believe.  The good thing about this team is most of our guys have time on their side, and that should give all of us fans hope that they'll find the right QB."
Texans,3a28vj,peccadillop,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:16:13 2015 UTC,"Throwing the ball is kinda important... If he can't sling it and be a starter by his 3rd season, idk if he can be a starter."
Texans,3a28vj,VitaminBro,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:06:32 2015 UTC,"Just curious, but why would hoyer just be a stopgap? If he has even just an above average season, I don't see anything wrong with keeping him. He's still pretty young, only a year older than mallet IIRC."
Texans,3a18d8,Mixitwiththerelish,4,Tue Jun 16 12:58:02 2015 UTC,"Interesting read. I'm sure we'll be happy to have Mohammed's coverage ability when facing some of the more athletic tight ends, but I'm glad we brought in McKinney for some size and strength inside."
Texans,3a18d8,Dukes1320,2,Tue Jun 16 18:01:07 2015 UTC,I really like the move towards two specialized and potentially cheaper ILBs for different scenarios. Feels like the kind of pairing that can get us high level production without having to pay a superstar next to Cushing. McKinney being mentally freed up to run downhill and dominate the run sounds like it could help him early too.
Texans,3a18d8,lincolnhawk,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:00:22 2015 UTC,"I like it too, especially because Cushing's versatility will make it harder for a smart opposing QB to pick on the other ILBs weakness. Seems like Crennel could win a lot of chess matches this season."
Texans,3a18d8,Dukes1320,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:18:39 2015 UTC,"With a stronger Dline and stronger Secondary, how much easier did the ILB jobs get this season?"
Texans,3a18d8,givememoreluisplease,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:24:36 2015 UTC,"Opposing TEs will have to stay in and block more due to our pass rush and the need to double Wilfork, we can be more creative with our blitz packages... Their job for sure is easier, though I'm not sure how much Raheem Moore will help out the coverage duties, there probably won't be too much overlap there."
Texans,3a18d8,Dukes1320,2,Tue Jun 16 19:37:24 2015 UTC,Moore will at least give them a true safety over the top for the faster TEs. I dont see the run being an option against this defense this year. Its making more sense why they decided to take Kevin Johnson in the first. Teams will abandon the run and try to pass so they need to make sure they have enough talent back there.
Texans,3a18d8,givememoreluisplease,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:48:47 2015 UTC,"itll be interesting to see how teams try to block watt and wilfork. if you use 4 linemen to block just the two of them, the possibilities are endless for clowney (if he can stay on the field) and mercilus."
Texans,3a18d8,trillvilletx,2,Tue Jun 16 20:42:13 2015 UTC,Also Crick.  Our front 7 is going to be monstrous if everybody is healthy.
Texans,3a18d8,Quadrophenic,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:56:07 2015 UTC,"Yea, my only concern is does Cush have his full range and coverage ability back? He's talking like he does and that's reassuring, but until I see it I'm still a bit nervous about him and McKinney getting exposed in coverage.   Regardless, it's gonna be awesome watching RAC tinker with all his new chess pieces. McKinney, Martin, the safeties, Vince, Clowney, Nix. Makes me all tingly to think about."
Texans,3a18d8,lincolnhawk,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:35:15 2015 UTC,"does Cush have his full range and coverage ability back?   We won't know for sure until the season starts, but Cush, his teammates, and every media person who's watched him play is saying yes."
Texans,3a18d8,Quadrophenic,3,Tue Jun 16 21:56:48 2015 UTC,"I know there really isn't stopping a great player like Gronk, but I wonder if Mohammed will at least be able to limit him this upcoming season. Then again were we ever able to see a dominant Cush vs. dominant Gronk? I would love to see that matchup as well and this might be the year."

Texans,39yah4,Quadrophenic,2,Mon Jun 15 20:23:23 2015 UTC,"If I can recall correctly, i thought we drafting him to be a Shane Vereen type of player. I might be wrong, but i think we even took our RB coaches to go scout him instead of our WR scouts."
Texans,39yah4,jstevens21,5,Mon Jun 15 20:57:25 2015 UTC,That may be true but word out of OTAs is that he runs a MEAN route.
Texans,39yah4,edwardsamson,7,Mon Jun 15 21:18:33 2015 UTC,"Cecil with a dash of Nate in 4th quarter, clock running situations.   We loved that 5 wide set last year but that was probably to accommodate Fitzy and the adjusting line. But still I'm sure they'll all see some time out there, hopefully a guy like Mumphrey can just make KMart disappear. Right Johnson hopfully invested in some stickum.   I'm cautiously cautious about our dude Jaelen. I hope he works hard to earn the second spot at some point this season."
Texans,39yah4,aareyes12,3,Mon Jun 15 23:30:43 2015 UTC,"Gives him a non immediate NEED to become a starter, but he should want it if he wants to hold true to his reasoning behind his jersey number."

Texans,39uf0f,thursdae,25,Mon Jun 15 19:27:18 2015 UTC,"In that thread:  ""He's humble, Must be a fucking faker""  ""Got any evidence for that?""  ""Nope.""  (EDIT) Also:   COCKY:  Adjective; conceited or arrogant, especially in a bold or impudent way.    JJ Watt is not conceited. Guys like Richard Sherman are. JJ Watt is proud of his accomplishments (everyone is, and if you aren't you're a fucking liar or suffer some sort of depression), but is a team player and always has been.  JJ Watt is not arrogant. He's confident and hard working because he believes he can be better. Refuses to accept he's as good as greats like LT or Reggie White. He's humble about himself. ""I can only control what I do"" is his favorite saying.  Surely he's bold. Every successful NFL player needs to be bold in some sort of way.   JJ Watt is surely not impudent. He shows great respect for his opponents. God forbid he trash talks his rival once in his god damn career. It's unbelievable how blown out of proportion that incident was. Considering his utter domination as a player, some trash talk is allowed. Yet nobody gives him a pass. 2nd place in that thread was Richard Sherman. Yet when Richard Sherman is brought up, people literally say ""Even tho he can back it up"". Why doesn't Watt, the #1 player in the NFL, get that kind of pass?  It's unbelievable that JJ Watt is at the top of that submission thread. He's the best at what he does and people are simply sick of hearing it. It has nothing to do with his ability, and everything to do with jealousy and celeb fatigue."
Texans,39uf0f,TripStep,10,Sun Jun 14 23:21:53 2015 UTC,"I remember JJ helping Mettenberger up after he sacked him. Coulda just left him there, but instead did what any other player would do. To me that shows how little he actually cared about that selfie thing."

Texans,39uf0f,TwinsBasilTwins,12,Sun Jun 14 22:30:38 2015 UTC,He said someone just showed it to him right before the game and he used it as a little rivalry fuel. I don't see the big deal.
Texans,39uf0f,deephousebeing,6,Mon Jun 15 00:22:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was bad at all or a big deal.   Seriously, that's not even 1/100 as bad as the NFC East."
Texans,39uf0f,tatertot255,8,Mon Jun 15 05:34:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think he loves attention. I think some of the things he does are intended to bring some attention to the city of Houston, which is desperately needed because we as a team have never received a lot of respect around the league. When your team is constantly being overlooked by pretty much everyone, it's nice to have an ambassador like JJ who will do whatever it takes to get us on the map while remaining humble"
Texans,39uf0f,stompy411,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:33:22 2015 UTC,"Yes. I have a feeling he's prodded by his agent to keep it up, but he can say no when he wants. I unfollowed him because it was so bad."

I was thinking, ""Are you guys being serious right now?"" but then went on with my life. Whether he's cocky or not, he's still better than any other player in the league, whether they like how he presents himself or not.  The most ironic thing? A COWBOY'S fan says ""People in this sub will find any way to hate on JJ Watt"" and gets completely downvoted. /r/nfl is going to become to /r/Texans, what /r/nba is to /r/rockets, a place full of haters who never want to admit a Houston team is better than theirs."

Secondly, presence on social media makes these guys money. Yeah it's cool that you're a good player but when you have 851,000 followers and people actively follow you companies are going to be more willing to pay big bucks for your endorsement. It's not all aimed at NFL fans either, think about the huge female market the NFL is trying to break into. Lots of girls use instagram and facebook and eat is this sorta stuff up."

Texans,39uf0f,dsmvwld,5,Sun Jun 14 22:31:40 2015 UTC,Can't say if he was serious for sure (seemed like it however) but it's still overblown. Oh no he's against selfies such a crime. Total scum.   Honestly wouldn't give a shit if I was a titans fan.

I'm just happy we get to watch him play for us all season, and that we have a player that's so good and so in the forefront of nationwide NFL consciousness that he's getting under the skin of other teams' fans. Pats fans have to hear shit like this about Brady and Gronk all the time, and do you think they care? Hell no they don't.   And sure, maybe JJ is cocky as shit, but who cares? He's not out getting DUIs or beating his girlfriend or saying racist shit on Twitter, so let him enjoy himself. He's potentially on a GOAT trajectory for a defensive player...so many guys in that thread looking down from ivory towers as though they wouldn't love to be in Watt's shoes, I'm sure 90% of them would be doing it up the same way if they were."

Texans,39vcqy,This-Is-My-Moment,10,Mon Jun 15 02:46:31 2015 UTC,"Because the odds are that the vast majority are juicing, and people need to learn to be ok with it. It doesn't matter and it certainly doesn't diminish the work that they've done. The thing is, people vastly inflate the significance and the advantage gained by PEDs. PEDs don't turn an average athlete elite. Yeah, they could allow a player to elevate certain aspects due to enhanced recovery etc. The extra miliseconds or rep could be the difference between being a first rounder and a 2nd etc.   I'm hesitant to make the link to Cycling but I think it has to be made, I think that it's most likely that a large number of players are on PEDs, and the only way to be on an even playing field is to use them too. I in no way see it as damaging the integrity of the game.   You can't just take a magic pill and everything improves. All of the hard work still has to go in, they're just benefitting from enhanced recovery and a couple of other things. What's the harm?"
Texans,39vcqy,RFC52,5,Mon Jun 15 08:52:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  A lot of the hatred for PEDs is spill over from the Soviet Era olympic athletes being seen as made in a lab while our ""good ol' all american corn fed boys"" were competeing ""naturally""."

Texans,39vcqy,VitaminBro,4,Tue Jun 16 01:29:00 2015 UTC,"People assume most everyone in the NFL juices because it's true. It has nothing to do with the integrity of the game; this is a brutal sport where the athletes are multi-million dollar investments and testing is a fucking joke, of course there's a going to be a huge incentive to use PED's under such an environment.   Integrity doesn't factor into it - in fact, I think it's self-righteous of fans, many of whom have done nothing that was more physical than sitting on their ass for most of their lives, to pass judgment on a man working his absolute hardest to get healthy as fast as possible with the help of drugs in between engaging in an hour long car collision every week.

You could say all Italian people like spaghetti, or all Australians are a little crazy. It's just not authentic to a serious discussion about any topic to generalize so brazenly.    Some people do think all athletes use PEDs. Some people think the only thing keeping them from a career in sports is their moral decision to forgo PEDs. psh, that Watt would still be delivering Pizza if he wasn't on the juice.

Texans,39pz3v,TheSwellFellow,3,Sun Jun 14 06:50:39 2015 UTC,"No it's not. 5 stars consistently do better than lower rated players.   The star system is not based off of their chance in the NFL, rather their chance in college."
Texans,39pz3v,achacha,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:46:34 2015 UTC,Here read this to understand why this star system is so broken:  http://bleacherreport.com/articles/117345-recruiting-for-beginners-part-i-how-are-players-ranked   The arbitrary assignment and subjectivity make it as useful as the combine is to the draft position.  Many players are ranked using about 30 seconds of video tape and some word of mouth.  Here is some more about JJ and his 2-star ranking: http://www.houstontexans.com/news/article-2/Watt-and-Foster-high-school-recruiting-rankings/f8c0814f-1804-43a7-b210-792377a21af5  I have followed Big12 for a while and there are so many 5star recruits that fail to do anything useful in collge and so many 2star that go on to the NFL that I don't really trust this system much.  Yes there are 5 star players that play well in college and go on to NFL but you can check any college roster and see that there are as many well performing 5star players as there are 2star and unranked players.  Do you have something to backup your assertion that the star system is a consistent way to rank incoming freshmen other than what you were told by the ranking companies?
Texans,39pz3v,TheSwellFellow,2,Sun Jun 14 14:53:22 2015 UTC,https://m.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/2555al/the_correlation_between_stars_and_the_nfl_draft/  I've played against recruits of all rankings; the five star guys are grown ass men. On a completely different level.
Texans,39pz3v,achacha,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:19:43 2015 UTC,"A critical part that the rankings miss are injuries (existing and past), getting a 5star that is hiding an injury is very common (and not just at the NFL level).    Another factor that needs to be considered is academic performance, many schools have minimum bars for academics and I have seen 5star freshmen never play a game as they go on academic probation while red-shirting and then get taken off the team. High schools can be very lenient with athletes.  Yes there is a level of corruption (or string arming) that the athletics department can have.  We have local schools here that are nationally ranked for academics and football where athletes get surprisingly high grades and then flunk out of college; which is sad.  There is also an old-boys-network where scouts and coaches have a ""relationship"" and certain players get a higher ranking to keep the school visible in the recruiting world.  Putting out many 5star players will draw more talent to them and more money for the program.  This is something that may not be new to you since you have played at some level.  This also follows them to the NFL, high draft may mean they do well or their non-rank related issues come up.  Texans are a good example.  Clowney will never play at the level he was expected to play.  The jury on Nix is out due to his poor work ethics.  Mallet a 5star out of college has questionable aim but a strong arm.  And so forth.  I agree with you that there is definitely some correlation but the system also misses out on many aspects that make a player a better team mate and not just a physical specimen.  There may never be a huge fix for this, there are a lot of kids coming into college and only so many people at ranking companies that can really put the time into it."

Texans,39qrxz,electricalenginerd,5,Sat Jun 13 21:55:03 2015 UTC,"I don't see it as betrayal.  For his career here, he was well-underpaid and one hell of a teammate and community member.  We released him and he went somewhere where he thought he'd be utilized."
Texans,39qrxz,kckolbe,8,Sat Jun 13 21:57:48 2015 UTC,"well-underpaid   He signed those contracts and made well over 60 or 70 million dollars here. I would hardly call him underpaid.   Considering his total contracts here add up to about 170 million, and that he played all but 2 years on those contracts, it's not an exaggeration that he made far over 100 million as a Texan."

Texans,39rqqa,ascenzion,26,Sun Jun 14 02:54:24 2015 UTC,"JJ Watt lines up against the weakest players on the line because he has the ability to play everywhere on the line, and have an elite impact while doing it.  Not many players can do that. Justin Houston doesn't cause pressure from the interior. Ndamukung Suh doesn't pass rush from the 9 technique. They play their roles extremely well, but Watt is on a whole other level. Neither are able to impact the QB and the run simultaneously like Watt can, from any position on the line.  Being able to attack any weakness is a strength, not a knock on his performance. Anyone who spends any time watching his ridiculous physical ability and impact in a game simply understands that he is not of this world. He's a fucking freak of nature."

That is how he attracts double/triple coverage and gets one of our other men free.   QB's find weak CB and attack them often. That is how the game is played... A QB does not go ""Oh! a weak CB is covering my best WR I should not target the poor guy and make him look bad... I would rather throw the ball to my other WR who is double covered.""  Infact that is one of the primary job of HC watch the opponents game and tune your game to attack their weakness. Put your best man against their worst and cash in."

Texans,39nhta,jjhouston99,3,Sat Jun 13 00:31:08 2015 UTC,I had a dream nightmare last night where Hoyer was starting in game one. I did not like it.
Texans,39nhta,The_Mills,2,Sat Jun 13 16:53:04 2015 UTC,I think you took what he said out of context. He's saying he could pick at any time.
Texans,39nhta,k-rizzle,4,Sat Jun 13 01:02:13 2015 UTC,I understand he can pick at anytime. But my question is why do alot of people think hoyer will be the starter just because he said he was going to make a decision before camp
Texans,39nhta,TripStep,7,Sat Jun 13 01:16:54 2015 UTC,"Because if I were a head coach and the perception about the competition was true (That they were both about 50/50), then my choice would come down to two things:  Do I choose the younger, higher potential player, who has very little experience and has accuracy issues? Will he crumble under pressure? Can he be consistent? Will his injury haunt us?  Or do I choose the much more experienced veteran, who has a much more limited skillset and body type? Will he cause us to lose games? Will his smaller body take the abuse?  When dealing with billion dollar operations, you generally end up with the more conservative choice, which is Hoyer.  Sitting in my Armchair with my Analyst Hat on, I always say: Roll the dice. Start Mallett."
Texans,39nhta,kckolbe,3,Sat Jun 13 01:30:39 2015 UTC,I like you
Texans,39nhta,TripStep,3,Sat Jun 13 02:03:51 2015 UTC,"We meet again, TripStep.  Add lack of mobility to Mallett's potential problems.  Personally, I want Hoyer.  I wouldn't be heartbroken if we do what we did last year, using a vet to get us off to a solid start, then bring in the young one with upside once we are rolling.  Given that KC and CAR both have a pretty strong front 7, I just don't want Mallett facing them to start our season."
Texans,39nhta,kckolbe,4,Sat Jun 13 03:51:37 2015 UTC,Cleveland had one of the best defenses in terms of generating pressure and Mallett ran the offense so well that he was touched or pressured once.  His excellent mobility in the pocket had something to do with that as well.
Texans,39nhta,TripStep,3,Sat Jun 13 04:24:02 2015 UTC,"It was also his first start EVER, so defenses had almost no tape on him, and he had two weeks to prepare because of the bye week.  And mobility had almost nothing to do with it since he had the fastest release of any team.  It was impressive, but how many young QBs have looked good once and then fallen off as defenses learned them?"
Texans,39nhta,DaftProdigy,5,Sat Jun 13 04:27:00 2015 UTC,"defenses had almost no tape on him   This literally has nothing to do with being able to climb the pocket and diagnose a defense. Defensive shells and personnel are the same from High School through the Professionals. Secondly, Mallett has 4 years worth of Preseason tape to learn his tendencies from. Cleveland is notorious for having a defense that is really good at confusing the shit out of QB's, so being able to punish them while taking only one pressure is remarkable for a first start.   how many young QBs have looked good once and then fallen off as defenses learned them?   Hoyer, for one."

Texans,39krcg,weebx,2,Fri Jun 12 16:14:05 2015 UTC,"Meh, I think Hoyer's okay. We have better offensive weapons for him than the Brownies did last year.   Actually, I don't really care which of the 2 gets the nod, just as long as they're the best."
Texans,39krcg,freshproduce,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:28:41 2015 UTC,"My thinking with Hoyer is that, like Fitz, BOB will structure the offense to what the QB can do. Add on that the selected QB will play a majority of the snaps during mini-camp and the preseason, and by the start of the season, we'll have a QB that has had ample time to work with the receivers and BOB to hone their craft and control of the offense.  Couple this with a defense that looks OP on paper, and this season can turn into something special for us!"
Texans,39krcg,bellsofwar3,6,Fri Jun 12 17:37:14 2015 UTC,"I'm betting it's Mallett, but my gut is fearing Hoyer.  If Hoyer does win the job, I have to hope it's because he had a bad scheme/coach in Cleveland and he's much better than people thought.  I'm leaving for a trip to Puerto Rico on Monday!  I'm 6'0, 200 lbs. I could probably put on the weight to be a RB. I'm a pretty agile runner and I can cut pretty well. I played a fucking shitload of soccer as a kid."

Texans,39krcg,whiskeygirl,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:10:01 2015 UTC,"mallet has been historically inaccurate and a poor decision maker.  i've not seen one thing he's done that's impressed me.  at least hoyer had a few flashes of brilliance.  also, please don't bring up mallet's ONE game of dinking and dunking going 1 for 4 deep with one interception."
Texans,39krcg,texansfan,6,Fri Jun 12 15:15:52 2015 UTC,"What impressed me wasn't his dinking and dunking or even his cannon arm, but his poise and command of the offense. Every snap with Fitz I had an underlying feeling that something terrible would happen. I felt the exact opposite with Mallett.   We haven't seen Hoyer in live action in a Texans uniform yet, but I wouldn't mind him beating mallett as long as he combined those flashes of brilliance with the same poise and command that Mallett showed against the Browns"
Texans,39krcg,rab7,2,Fri Jun 12 15:39:57 2015 UTC,I agree but keep in mind he played the Browns in the midst of their collapse. I've never liked mallet and this is going back to Arkansas. he always fell apart in big games but csn crushed everything else.
Texans,39krcg,texansfan,5,Fri Jun 12 16:04:55 2015 UTC,"I always go for boring veterans over cannon arms.  Hoyer.  Boring weekend lined up, as I am a boring man.  Without a doubt, TE.

(Don't know where he got that last one)  I think it's funny because my build doesn't indicate my height at all. People always think I'm 5'8"" or 5'9"" when I ask them how tall I am because I don't ""look"" short, but when I tell them I'm 5'6"", they're like ""Really?

Texans,39krcg,MisallocatedRacism,3,Fri Jun 12 17:33:40 2015 UTC,"Because you said peak physical condition, not top 1% of all physical conditions on earth"

Texans,39krcg,deephousebeing,3,Fri Jun 12 20:12:07 2015 UTC,"That's a terrible question. If I can be the best athlete in the world, then fine, I'll be Miguel Cabrera and take my $300MM guaranteed contract and do whatever I want. If I'm the rest of the sporting population (ie, not the .005% that becomes a Tom Brady) then back up QB. Average life of a NFL player being what it is, you are most likely to earn more money as a backup QB than just about any other position. If you assume that you are going to be the best person to play a position over a 10 year period then yeah, pick whoever gets paid the most with the least amount of bodily damage."
Texans,39krcg,deephousebeing,3,Fri Jun 12 18:37:17 2015 UTC,"Hoyer with Mallet as the backup. Going to IFLY again and embarrass myself in front of a bunch of strangers. I used to play football in high school and was a great outside linebacker or what we called a blood backer because we were out for blood. True story. I was playing that position during a high school game and this one lineman kept burning me off the line. He had my number and was using tactics that were illegal but the ref never saw it, (while I was down this guy would punch me in the nuts). My coach caught wind of it and asked me if I'm going to do anything about it? The next play I put all of my fingers inside his helmet and blinded the guy for the rest of the game, (he turned out fine). By the way I am picking up my orange Astrodome seats tomorrow. I can't wait!"

Lechler's first pass is a 60 yard TD. Lechler gets named starting QB. He comes out of the dark to surprise all our opponents and puts up H.O.F. numbers. Lechler's wins Super Bowl passing 19-25 for 372 yards and 4 TD's all to JJ.  So it is written so it shall be.

Texans,39h7t1,StraightoutaBrompton,6,Thu Jun 11 18:39:41 2015 UTC,It very well could be a ploy by BoB to get the QBs to compete even harder.  To sprint that much harder coming to the finish.

Texans,39ij3e,BublerBuddy,8,Thu Jun 11 23:21:12 2015 UTC,I'm 90% certain his lost year to cancer did not count against his rookie contract. So we still have him on his rookie deal for the next 3 years. No reason to cut him since he's so cheap and our O-Line depth is so thin.
Texans,39ij3e,dseals,4,Fri Jun 12 02:09:54 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, if that's true it makes perfect sense that we continue to mentally and when he can physically train him for the extra time and unleash the beast once he's healthy. Nothing brings out team loyalty and spirit like being there for someone when they are in their darkest place (especially when we don't have to pay much to be there for him ;))."
Texans,39ij3e,GeoStarRunner,3,Fri Jun 12 02:29:32 2015 UTC,I haven't heard too much on him. It'd be amazing if he's in football shape this year. If he's not I'd like us to keep him around another year. I'd like to see him become starting caliber
Texans,39ij3e,electricalenginerd,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:26:55 2015 UTC,I would too because he is a great story. But has he shown anything that would prove that he could become a starter?
Texans,39ij3e,electricalenginerd,2,Thu Jun 11 23:46:22 2015 UTC,No. There's nothing that says he's even going to make the 53 man roster. He's finally started practicing with the team again. That's all the news I've read

Texans,39h962,PowderedToastMann,4,Thu Jun 11 18:33:12 2015 UTC,"Savage was an extremely raw prospect that had hopped around between three different schools and sat out for a year or two because of the NCAA rules regarding transfers. When we drafted him all the Texans fans knew that there was very little chance that he would make an impact before the 2016 season because of how raw he was. The reason we took the chance on him is the fact that he has all the intangibles to become a starting QB in the NFL ranging from a spectacular work ethic and leadership to a good arm and above average intelligence. This off season he has made tremendous leaps, but he still is behind Mallet and Hoyer and hasn't proven to be completion to them yet."
Texans,39h962,BublerBuddy,2,Thu Jun 11 21:38:43 2015 UTC,"Small note, we drafted him because he has great tangibles. Tall, strong arm, fairly accurate. With the hope that we could teach him the intangibles. Reading coverage, handling the blitz."
Texans,39h962,Beep_Boop_IAmaRobot,2,Fri Jun 12 21:41:26 2015 UTC,He was drafted as an experiment. Kinda like Mallett (funny we have them both). He's gunna have to sit back and develop but who knows maybe next year he could win the #1 job.

LeBron gave Ohio State Beats and Beats gave Oregon some Beats  But I think high school is fine no matter what.

RB Battle- We have Arian Foster, Jonathan Grimes, Chris Polk, Alfred Blue, and Kenny Hillard, Foster is a lock but at least one of the others won't make the final 53. WR #2 Battle- Hopkins is obviously the #1, but Cecil Shorts, Nate Washington, Jaelen Strong, and Keith Mumphy will are all in the running for the second WR spot. TE Battle- Will C.J Fiedorowicz or Ryan Griffin finally supplant Garret Graham for the starting spot? KR/PR Battle- Keith Mumphy, Chris Polk, Keyshawn Martin, and Damaris Johnson are all in the running. Fight for players like Keyshawn Martin, Travis Labhart, and Damaris Johnson to stay on the roster. Battle for the starting Center spot between Xavier Su'a-Filo and Ben Jones. Battle for the starting SS spot between Stevie Brown, Terrance Parks, Eddie Pleasant, Lonnie Ballentine, Kurtis Dummond, and Andre Hal, and additionally the fight to stay on the roster for some of those guys. Can Clowney recover? How is Wilfork handling moving to a new city? Jaelen Strong's conditioning problems. Can Kevin Johnson challenge Jonathan Joseph for the starting spot opposite Kareem Jackson?

Texans,39agmp,GOTO_Velociraptor,3,Wed Jun 10 14:07:52 2015 UTC,"His recovery is impressive and is mostly a result of his athleticism.  Few people work as hard as NFL athletes so he is already conditioned to be more dedicated to recovery than a typical patient.  Some patients feel lethargic for years after chemo but others are back running marathons after a year or so.  For some it becomes a mental barrier, for others it is physical.  DQ has the ideal fortitude for recovery.    It also depends on what kind of treatment he had.  Chemotherapy agents are toxic to all cells and different agents have different effects....some of those relative to the individual.  He also could have been on immunosuppressive drugs which could effect his recovery.  Diet is crucial as well and all those drugs just wreck your stomach and appetite, though he likely isn't experiencing any lasting effects now that he's in remission and off treatment.    TL;DR:  Recovery depends on the individual and the circumstances but DQ is a tough mofo."
Texans,39agmp,BewareOfLurkers,3,Wed Jun 10 12:54:08 2015 UTC,"I thought about the athleticism he had, which is something to take into consideration, and the fact he has a mentality that's built for saying ""this isn't stopping me"" that definitely contributes to it too.   But I still wonder, how did he physically feel? Was he unable to move some days? Did you feel like he was sick times 10? For me, I'm always trying to place myself in the shoes of others to gain a better understanding of where they're coming from with their issues. With cancer, it's one of those things you hear about all the time, but you can never truly understand it."
Texans,39agmp,ICantSeeIt,2,Wed Jun 10 13:35:51 2015 UTC,"But I still wonder, how did he physically feel? Was he unable to move some days? Did you feel like he was sick times 10?   OH he most assuredly had some incredible low feeling points.  I don't think I've seen anyone immune to chemo.  The difference is he has the mental ability to overcome laying in bed and not wanting to get up and walk....because it's hard.  Still trying to eat right despite the nausea and vomiting and remaining active during treatment are big things that aid in recovery too.   It's easy to feel sorry for ones self and the wrong kind of support can enable that.     In the yahoo article posted I just saw that he had ten rounds chemo and 5 weeks of radiation.  Chemo rounds are typically 28 day cycles.  Radiation therapy is usually first and comes with a radiosensitizing agent that is often given daily throughout the full radiotherapy treatment.  Then that drug regimen is typically continued as adjuvant chemotherapy, though different drugs may be used.   Those doses can be daily as well or alternating weekly or once a week, just depending on the drug.    So 11 months of taking chemo drugs is alot.  There are some oral chemo meds that aren't so bad but still come with fatigue.  Then there are some that have to be given IV through a PIC line and they just flat out wreck your body.    No doubt there were some very low days but having the goal of getting back on the field ahead of him had to have been a big factor in his quick recovery.  He's a strong willed person to be even considering hitting the field inside of a year from his last treatment."

I think we have a lot of great players all around but lots of them are either in their first or second year without any playing time or FA that are new to the team. We also have a question mark at QB. Lots of learning and adjusting to do. If Mallett turns out to be the one, I really like our future starting in 16. I just don't think it happens in 15.  Sorry :( somebody tell me how wrong I am please"
Texans,397lom,New__York__Bozo,21,Tue Jun 9 21:33:05 2015 UTC,"Holy shit it's nice to see an honest team sub.  I got lynched last week for saying Bakhtiari is our worst starting O Lineman.  You can't even say a Packer is worse than other Packers over there.  Everyone needs to be tied for ""Awesome because my team.""  Say what you want about your team, you don't know how nice you guys have it not having those dumb ass casual fans in your sub that have no idea what they're talking about.  I'm sure you've got a handful, but people in Wisconsin have to be Packers fans.  They literally have to.  They don't commit to the team or learn anything like other teams that don't have quite the guaranteed payoff."

Texans,397lom,SenorFluffy,9,Wed Jun 10 00:08:08 2015 UTC,One of the nice things about the NFL as opposed to the NBA is that if you make the playoffs you have a chance to win it all. We could make the playoffs at 10 wins and have a decent shot to go deep in the postseason. I'm a little worried we won't make the playoffs though.
Texans,397lom,at_work_safe_acct,4,Tue Jun 9 21:49:21 2015 UTC,"While you are probably correct, lets look at it from the Kool-Aid perspective.  We went 9-7 last year and almost made the play offs with 4 different QB's and lost a lot of very close games.  What information do we know about our QB situation? Mallet played one game excellently and one game terribly while hurt.  Hoyer can be serviceable under the correct offense but prone to melt downs.  We could have kept Fitz and had him again this year.  If you trust BOB's ability to assess quarter backs than you must believe that we are in a much better situation this year.  So BOB thinks we have two QBs that are better than Fitz otherwise why not just keep him and not sign Hoyer? This is not to mention a potentially healthy Electric Circus and a Cushing that has said that he feels 100% for the first time in years. Hopkins is putting up early career AJ numbers (I'm not saying they are the same caliber WR, I am just stating facts)  Obviously this is a lot of speculation but if those things are true we are in fantastic shape.  edit:I FORGOT BIG VINCE! He's gonna plug some holes."
Texans,397lom,Checksbounce,3,Tue Jun 9 22:44:44 2015 UTC,I'm really excited about Rahim Moore and our secondary.
Texans,397lom,at_work_safe_acct,3,Tue Jun 9 22:58:19 2015 UTC,I'm more excited about this year than any other year in Texans history.  It is because of Bill O Fucking Brian.  Good leadership and identifying talent and knowing how to utilize that talent wins games.
Texans,397lom,INTENSECHOCOLATE,2,Tue Jun 9 23:06:13 2015 UTC,"While I do agree with you, I'm gonna play devils advocate. We will have to worry about injuries in general. If any of our keystone players (foster, watt, etc.) Are injured for 3+ games, that might mean one win less down the line. Also NFL parity is pretty humbling. Unless you're substantially better than most teams, you're gonna have to respect ""every given sunday."" we're a facing a few teams below our level, but we're playing a lot of teams at our level. I dont know man, I'm just saying the football gods are cruel and spiteful."
Texans,397lom,dylxesia,3,Wed Jun 10 04:42:48 2015 UTC,"I think you're pretty spot on, although i think if Mallet or Hoyer is the right one then our ceiling is about 11-5 due to an easy schedule. I think we are going to have a season that the Rockets did last year, make playoffs but get knocked out in the first round."

Texans,397lom,outright_bs,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:49:22 2015 UTC,Well - BoB did manage to do some remarkable things with the crew last season.  He's the best at making adjustments to maximize what he has and has shown he's not afraid to make unpopular changes to get there.  So - we got that.
Texans,397lom,TripStep,5,Wed Jun 10 12:02:26 2015 UTC,"Depends on our QB situation. Same thing as last year? 8-9 wins is as good as you can hope. Revolving doors are awful.  If we find stability and consistency? 12 wins isn't out of the question. Considering that our Roster (if you exclude QB) is far and away better coached and more well rounded than the Colts, I think a consistent QB could even allow us to sweep them."
Texans,397lom,SCREW-IT,4,Tue Jun 9 23:03:01 2015 UTC,This is it.   We find our QB of the future? Sky is the limit.  If not.. decent but not terrible seasons are in out future.
Texans,397lom,texans1234,5,Tue Jun 9 23:54:47 2015 UTC,If Mallett turns out to be a top 10 qb then there's a good chance we win 12 games and make a deep playoff (or with a little luck make the SB) run. As far as I'm concerned we are only lacking solid qb play and have the rest of the pieces to do it.
Texans,397lom,Pktur3,4,Wed Jun 10 00:12:16 2015 UTC,"The possibility exists.  From the outside (and from a team y'all hate, I get it), we're scared of that Def.  If Mallet can stay healthy, a solid Y-receiver develops, Watt keeps up the crazy-ass season he had last year, and Clowney produces at 75% of what he was expected to I think you guys will surprise a lot of people."
Texans,397lom,H1ghjack3d,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:29:56 2015 UTC,Upvoted a Colt. Never thought I'd see the day. I'm betting with pressured qbs and Raheem Moore ballhawking I'm thinking we have a great turnover differential.
Texans,397lom,pieman2005,3,Wed Jun 10 16:20:39 2015 UTC,"Complete different situations though. The Rockets are going to be legit contenders as long as Dwight's knees stay healthy. The Texans are still rebuilding and don't have that star QB. The Rockets have a superstar ""QB"" in Harden."
Texans,397lom,yankwanker,4,Tue Jun 9 23:25:57 2015 UTC,"Are you asking if the Texans are gong to blow the doors off of the NFL this year? I'm doubtful to be honest.  That being said, if Mallet can throw the ball, I think we will be a playoff contender this year. I think a lot of people were surprised by the rockets advancement to the WCF and obviously the stros have been a revelation these last few months, but don't forget the Texans were 9 and 7 with a shot at the playoffs last season. We aren't nobodies and if we could have eeked out another win we could have played ball with the colts.  So it wouldn't/shouldn't be unexpected for us to make a wildcard spot this year.   We lost our greatest receiver (and one of our greatest players) ever and replaced him with cecil shorts. We also bulked up our defense and could possibly rule the front 7 numbers if everyone stays healthy... but that's a big if.  So my answer is no, but not because I think we will do poorly. I just don't think we are going to be breaking the dolphins undefeated streak this year.   Bold prediction: Texans 10&6 with a playoff berth this year."
Texans,397lom,trillvilletx,2,Tue Jun 9 21:45:18 2015 UTC,"I honestly hope that the front desk is making the right choices, i am doubtful so far but it seems like they don't know what they are doing. We have settled for ""mediocrity"" for far too long and they only keep increasing the ticket prices without giving us favorable (championship) results."
Texans,397lom,w2eatherman,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:00:30 2015 UTC,"Mallett has to have the IT factor and prove that he was a top-level QB that simply was buried behind the even greater Tom Brady. If Mallett turns out to be an average QB, we will likely hit 10 wins or so at best with strong defensive play. Even if Hoyer has to play due to Mallett being insufficient, I still think we can be ok...but to reach postseason and have a chance at doing anything, we need to know that our QB position is shored up."
Texans,397lom,Random908,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:00:18 2015 UTC,i feel as if i'm the only one expecting a 6-10 type season. i think last season we benefited from an easy schedule and solid (not great) play from Fitzpatrick. i think both Mallett and Hoyer are going to be worse than Fitzy.
Texans,397lom,w2eatherman,3,Wed Jun 10 00:05:22 2015 UTC,What makes you think Mallett won't be better than the guy he started over?  Or the career backup?  Or Fitztragic?  Or the guy that was dumped for Charlie Whitehurst?  What makes you think Mallett is worse?
Texans,397lom,Random908,0,Wed Jun 10 01:24:13 2015 UTC,his accuracy in my opinion. it's something he's struggled with his entire career and has never shown signs of improving it. even in the game against Cleveland where he played well there were a few times he just missed on an open receiver (deep ball to Hopkins comes to mind)
Texans,397lom,w2eatherman,3,Wed Jun 10 01:26:38 2015 UTC,"Sure, he missed a few passes, IN HIS FIRST NFL START EVER. So what? You'd be nervous too if you trained your whole life for something, and finally got a shot. The thing I'm more worried about is the overall accuracy, the footwork, the pocket presence, the touch, the improvement from his college career. He exceeded in all of these. That's veteran presence, that he doesn't have in his first start. If he still has no improvement on these by the middle of the season, than we can talk about certain passes being missed. Not over one start"
Texans,397lom,Random908,0,Wed Jun 10 01:35:44 2015 UTC,he's 27 years old you think he would have shown a little bit more by this age. I'm fully supportive of giving him the starting role and letting him get a fair chance to show his skills but I'm just saying that I personally don't believe he's the answer at QB.
Texans,397lom,Balls_4,3,Wed Jun 10 01:41:21 2015 UTC,"He's not starting over Brady, if that's what you want. During practices reporters said that he LOOKED BETTER THAN BRADY most of the time. He worked ~25 for a shot at something. He got it. No one wouldn't be nervous. Plus, the OLine played better under him! Teams dropped off to respect the deep ball. What in the world could possibly give you a bad vibe?"

Texans,396us5,Logorrhea_,5,Tue Jun 9 18:00:45 2015 UTC,"I really hope Strong steps up soon.  2 questions:   1) The article mentioned rostering 4 running backs. Which 4 would we most likely keep? Foster and Polk for sure, but then we have to pick 2 from Blue, Grimes, and Hilliard (am I missing anybody?)  2) Mentioned Polk as a return guy. I may be completely making this up, but I thought I remembered hearing that Mumphrey was a return man in college. Is he in the equation? Did I make all of that up?"
Texans,396us5,InbreadSourdough,5,Tue Jun 9 18:38:28 2015 UTC,Blue is on a rookie contract so he's an easy add. Not sure about #2
Texans,396us5,htownandown,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:43:28 2015 UTC,So is Hilliard
Texans,396us5,Random908,3,Wed Jun 10 01:11:51 2015 UTC,1) Grimes would be the cut from that group if Hilliard and Blue perform to expectations. It's basically those 5 fighting for the 4th spot.  2) The article mentions Mumphrey also playing in the return role.   Rookies Mumphery and Worthy appear to figure in

Texans,396us5,InbreadSourdough,2,Tue Jun 9 19:24:22 2015 UTC,"I think Polk can be a decent punt returner. I'm not sure if he was a return man in college, but Mumphrey is one of those wide receivers that runs like a running back and can pick up a lot of yard after contact, so I wouldn't doubt him being an option."

The wait list for season tickets is comically long, I was finally able to buy some in 2011 that weren't in pairs and was lucky to upgrade to consecutive seats last week. They'll release single game tickets for sale after season ticket holders get a chance to buy additional seats, but whatever's left will likely be single seats and in high priced sections."
Texans,397na0,JAMESDALTONSFIST,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:46:00 2015 UTC,"They release them for all the games on a single day which I assume is coming up here soon, so it's a typical click and refresh race online to try and grab seats before the resell companies buy them up. I'm not sure what would happen if you waited at the ticket booth the day they were released. It's always good to call the texans ticket office for more info"
Texans,397na0,rock99rock,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:01:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure when regular tickets go on sale, but the week before a game the club releases seats that they have available. I think you have to be on the waitlist, but that's easy enough to sign up for."

Texans,393x1q,Labambama,5,Tue Jun 9 04:29:38 2015 UTC,I sure as hell hope so
Texans,393x1q,SherlockBrolmes7,5,Tue Jun 9 02:50:24 2015 UTC,I doubt it. Chris Myers was pretty bad last year.
Texans,393x1q,Checksbounce,7,Tue Jun 9 03:29:03 2015 UTC,He wasnt his normal pro bowl self but he was decent. Plus with Mallet probably starting a qb a vet center would be nice. Definitely preferable over having Ben Jones try to figure it out when he still has trouble playing gaurd
Texans,393x1q,no_one_knows42,9,Tue Jun 9 13:06:14 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Unless Myers has put on some serious weight, I don't think he would have a bounce back year. He has the build for zone schemes and that's about it. He didn't only miss assignments last year, he muffed the snap and stepped on feet after getting mauled a few times. Jones was a center so this should be more natural for him than guard was. We drafted him for center. Chris needs to be a vet with the heart of teacher right now in my eyes."
Texans,393x1q,thedrainbow,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:29:06 2015 UTC,maybe BoBs scheme doesnt fit him? too small? could also have played hurt. centers usually dont fall off the face of the earth. giving him the some benefit of the doubt.

Texans,393x1q,Wham_Bam_Smash,11,Tue Jun 9 21:12:12 2015 UTC,"On one hand, great! I think Meyers stumbled in the beginning of the year with all of the changes, but he caught on quick and became solid again. I want him back, but on the other hand it makes me concerned that Filo and Jones haven't been able to play up to par so far. Which is a depth issue now. Meyers isn't a spring chicken and Center is a key position."
Texans,393x1q,MisallocatedRacism,5,Tue Jun 9 12:16:19 2015 UTC,"where did you see that Sua Filo and Jones aren't playing up to par? I'm thinking Meyers is being signed for depth, not necessarily because our centers are bad."
Texans,393x1q,Ferbinder,3,Tue Jun 9 12:56:53 2015 UTC,"I don't know that they are bad, I'm just saying that it could be a bad sign that they aren't up to par. You think Meyers wouldn't start?"
Texans,393x1q,MisallocatedRacism,3,Tue Jun 9 14:25:25 2015 UTC,O'Brien is always preaching competition so I think the young'ins will get a fair shake at starting. I'm hoping we'll have another case of young guys improving drastically like Newton. I do see your point that it could mean that it might be a bad sign though. I'm just hoping you're wrong about that.
Texans,393x1q,Ferbinder,2,Tue Jun 9 14:43:17 2015 UTC,Me too!
Texans,393x1q,MisallocatedRacism,2,Tue Jun 9 16:15:44 2015 UTC,Probably based off of his performance last season.
Texans,393x1q,bearwulf,2,Tue Jun 9 13:26:44 2015 UTC,"Well the fact that Sua Filo couldn't make the field last year and that he couldn't beat out ben jones is what people are going off of. Substance and facts. not ""pie in the sky"""
Texans,393x1q,WorkAccount83,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:23:52 2015 UTC,"Su'a-Filo graduated late last offseason and missed rookie camp, and was behind most other players when he came in. It wasn't likely he would beat out Jones for the starting spot when he's having to learn the playbook and then catch up to the veterans."
Texans,393x1q,dseals,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:36:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not good from a 2.1 draft pick...hell 3 and 4th rounders on the OL are expected starters."
Texans,393x1q,WorkAccount83,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:56:06 2015 UTC,Most draftees graduated in December though. XSF was a May graduate so that's why he was so behind.
Texans,393x1q,dseals,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:17:18 2015 UTC,"you realize that it only puts him like 3 weeks behind? not to mention he got the playbook right after he got drafted. So 3 weeks gives him an okay not to pick it up for the entire season? We had 7th rounders on our OL start on day one. Just saying....for being a 2.1 draft pick, not starting at all your rookie year looks really bad. Lets HOPE that he will come around..if not..ANOTHER 2nd round bust.   edit 2.1 is really like a first round pick in my eyes. but that's just my opinion!"
Texans,393x1q,WorkAccount83,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:03:21 2015 UTC,"You realize he still has to adjust to a completely new system of line calls and protection assignments. It's not just ""Line up and hit this guy."" He has to first learn his new line calls, then he has to actually beat out the man in front of him which he couldn't begin doing until preseason while also learning the entire playbook.  It doesn't matter that he got the playbook once he was drafted because he was still going to school. Of course he's not studying the playbook while he's trying to study for school.  So now he's behind on the playbook, still has to catch up to line calls, and missed rookie camp AND OTAs. He wasn't even practicing with the team at this point in the season thanks to the quarters system that UCLA uses (which I screwed up because the semester ends in mid-June in the quarters system so sorry about that).  Su'a-Filo basically walked into training camp with only his knowledge of the playbook to that point and then had to compete for the starting job. It wasn't going to happen."
Texans,393x1q,dseals,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:40:53 2015 UTC,"Okay so your points are he's behind in the playbook, but all he brings to the table is the playbook? And lets be honest here, Its not like he was in med school, and he's been playing football for a long time. (and he didn't even graduate).  He gave up school to focus on football. So stop making excuses for a guy that didn't produce for where he was drafted.  Let's hope this year he won't be a complete waste like he was in his last."
Texans,393x1q,WorkAccount83,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:39:01 2015 UTC,"Your whole point is ""Su'a-Filo didn't play last year therefore he was a wasted pick."" You don't even understand how rookie development works if that's your argument. Your other argument, ""3rd and 4th round O-Linemen are expected to start"" is also not true. 1st and 2nd round OL picks are expected to start, but 3rd and 4th rounders are backups. They are never expected to take over starting positions. Just because they occasionally do doesn't mean it's an expectation.  I'm not making excuses for him. He was in school until mid June. You're acting like memorizing a new playbook, learning new line calls, and new protection schemes is something everyone can do in a month.  Stop acting like he was a complete failure and realize not everyone is going to be an instant success in the NFL. If you're already hammering him for not knowing the playbook after showing up late and being unable to take the starting job away from Jones then you're just being overly harsh. Su'a-Filo had to earn the spot and being behind Jones in everything isn't going to help him. It's not surprising that he didn't play many snaps during the season."

Texans,3926n4,PDSTX,2,Mon Jun 8 18:38:31 2015 UTC,"For those who were wondering about his weight, here's a quote from him yesterday:   ""It kind of fluctuates sometimes, but we’ve steadily been gaining weight. I think at the end of my chemo, I was in the high 260’s (pounds). Right now, I’m high 280’s about. It’s coming on. You don’t want to put on weight too fast. We’re right where we want to be. Before I got diagnosed, I think I was around 306 or 307.”"
Texans,392j9z,LdZppln,11,Mon Jun 8 20:02:23 2015 UTC,Anyone else hope that paragraph about Foster doesn't get out to the fantasy community?
Texans,392j9z,edwardsamson,2,Mon Jun 8 23:24:49 2015 UTC,"Just checked the fantasy football subreddit. So far, so good.  Got Forte in the 1st and Foster in the 2nd in my last mock draft."

Texans,392j9z,givememoreluisplease,3,Mon Jun 8 20:36:01 2015 UTC,"I was listening to the podcast with Adam Wexler and Pat Starr and they mentioned that although Labhart stood out in rookie minicamp, he once again disappeared once OTAs started. It does not bode well for Labhart with such a tight WR competition."
Texans,392j9z,edwardsamson,3,Mon Jun 8 21:47:16 2015 UTC,Apparently today was his best day in OTAs but he wasn't great last week.
Texans,392j9z,friendlygoatherder,8,Mon Jun 8 22:00:18 2015 UTC,Why nothing about the archduke!? I fear he will get injured four games into the season.
Texans,392j9z,edwardsamson,2,Mon Jun 8 21:46:09 2015 UTC,It will hurt to miss him but we may be okay with how good Mumphries and Washington are playing in OTAs then there's still Strong who will hopefully turn it around.

Y'all remember the Eagles game last year when Barwin thought he could backpedal on Foster?  It resulted in a 56 yard TD pass instead.  I'll try to find the video.    Edit:  The only highlight I can find is a wide angle that obscures his backpedal with the scoring graphic.  The replay during the game showed it clearly, which I cannot find."

Texans,392t4h,TonyTNT,7,Thu Jun 11 00:06:06 2015 UTC,"Case in point, at practice today, the offense messed up a cadence and the entire offense dropped to to do ten pushups. Bill O’Brien, Pat O’Hara and George Godsey included. In fact, they were the first three to hit the ground and do push-ups and the players followed suit. Something small, but it means something to players that coaches take accountability as much as they demand it.   Full mast. I can't fucking wait for Hard Knocks."
Texans,392t4h,TripStep,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:27:42 2015 UTC,"It's not much   Linebacker Max Bullough wasn’t known for his pass coverage ability in college, but he’s improved in that area a bunch since being in Houston. Today, he tracked RB Jonathan Grimes on a route down the field and knocked down a pass. If he can do that, he’s going to be right in that ILB competition for certain.   But I was all hype when we brought in this guy and Simon last year. I hope they both end up earning a spot at LB."
Texans,3926uj,PDSTX,8,Mon Jun 8 18:39:51 2015 UTC,Who's gonna call plays?
Texans,3926uj,SherlockBrolmes7,8,Mon Jun 8 19:12:44 2015 UTC,I think it's been him and Bob and probably still will be.   And Arian on fourth and goal apparently
Texans,3926uj,aareyes12,3,Mon Jun 8 19:22:11 2015 UTC,What do you mean about the last part with Arian?
Texans,3926uj,SherlockBrolmes7,11,Mon Jun 8 19:29:26 2015 UTC,Arian convince bob a few time last year to give him the ball on 4th down
Texans,3926uj,aareyes12,4,Mon Jun 8 19:55:01 2015 UTC,That's interesting.  Bob doesn't seem like the kind of guy to give up control of decision making easily.  I wonder if Foster has the chops to coach when he retires.
Texans,3926uj,da1hobo,5,Tue Jun 9 03:01:40 2015 UTC,I think it's more Bob doesn't like wasting drives and Arian having confidence in himself. We went for it a lot on 4th last season
Texans,3926uj,aareyes12,3,Tue Jun 9 03:04:12 2015 UTC,"I think he's saying Foster's TD pass was a broken play that he was supposed to run? In the replay, it does look like it a bit but then again he could have just done a perfect run fake to set up his pass."
Texans,3926uj,edwardsamson,5,Mon Jun 8 19:46:18 2015 UTC,"""We've been running that play the last two or three weeks in practice,"" Fiedorowicz said. ""When we were on the six-yard line, that was our goal, to get that play run. Coach (O'Brien) called it. There was a toss to Arian to make it look like we were doing an outside run play. He ended up dropping back and throwing that pass, so it worked perfectly."""
Texans,3926uj,LdZppln,3,Mon Jun 8 20:38:57 2015 UTC,No way that was improv that was pass all the way or Arian is a legend
Texans,3926uj,SherlockBrolmes7,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:34:08 2015 UTC,And how would Fedora know to look for a pass from Arian?  That was at least the backup plan in goal line packages.
Texans,3926uj,BisonST,6,Tue Jun 9 14:22:19 2015 UTC,"When pancakes announced it a few months ago, he said Godsey had already been defacto OC, which implies he was already calling the plays in.

Texans,3926uj,TripStep,4,Mon Jun 8 19:24:38 2015 UTC,"Interesting. BOB was OC last season, I wonder if he is fully going to hand over the reins and let Godsey do it all or still play a small role in play-calling."
Texans,3926uj,htownholditdown,7,Mon Jun 8 19:26:08 2015 UTC,"The clues I got from player interviews and mic'ed up videos was that Godsey was calling the plays for most, if not all, of last season. I doubt much will change."
Texans,3924s4,TwinsBasilTwins,7,Mon Jun 8 18:26:01 2015 UTC,"It looks to me like he's very wary of speaking to the press, perhaps rightfully so.  Internally I see him thinking ""Don't say anything O'Brien wouldn't like...don't say anything O'Brien wouldn't like..."" before gently answering/deflecting the questions.    Unfortunately, I think as fans we're not going to get many memorable interviews, but perhaps it's better that the players don't put up bulletin board material."
Texans,3924s4,daedas,5,Mon Jun 8 20:04:04 2015 UTC,"We would all rather see our players light up the scoreboards instead of the headlines or police scanners. Besides, a healthy fear of your head coach is a good thing right?"

Happy Monday I guess.   Couldn't sleep much on top of that, but I did have a dream that I was running from some dangerous situation and called an uber - JJ Watt showed up in an F - 150 or something.   Obligatory comment about this being where I'd talk about my SO if I had one.   Can I say Clowney?  I want to say Clowney.  Also Strong."
Texans,390ysm,Thebassist140,3,Mon Jun 8 15:38:00 2015 UTC,"Ew, waking up early is gross. I was at 530 this morning because I come in DC on Mondays. I was tired earlier in the day but I'm feeling better now that I've had a lot of hot water to drink.  I had a dream that was almost a nightmare, and just scary as fuck. I dreamed I was with friends on a task force that guarded three doors constantly because ""mutated"" people walked out of them all the time. They looked like regular people, but they were pure evil, so we had to shoot and kill every. Single. Person. On sight, no questions.  It was terrifying because the people that would walk out would look like friends, family, children, and no matter how they looked, they HAD to be killed. It was hard to see, killing people that looked so damn innocent, or that looked like a really good friend, or a little kid crying for help. Even in my dream I could feel myself bending to the thoughts of ""What if they aren't evil?"" and my sanity as well, but sure enough the instant they crossed a line, they flipped out and turned into psychotic killers with no regard to themselves, they just wanted to end us.  There was a moment where I was in close-quarters combat with one of them that looked like teenager, he was maybe 14 or 15 years old with black hair, white eyes, and weighed maybe 140lbs, but he could move. I felt my adrenaline rushing from the thought of dying, the force of blocking his hands, one holding a knife, the look in his eyes of pure blood lust, the fact that this was literally a fight for my life. I've never dreamed of stabbing a person in the throat before, but if it's anything like it was in my dream, it's one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen. And if the look in someones eyes as they're dying was anything like his, it's extremely haunting.  I love my dreams because they're intense on realism, but I hate it when they go into a weird place, because that shit's weird."
Texans,390ysm,Next_Episode,3,Mon Jun 8 16:21:42 2015 UTC,This is an award winning short film. Also maybe a peek into your psyche. As disturbing as that might be. I've only had super violent dreams once and I ended strangling someone because my hand was trapped between my thighs and I scratched myself waking up. Scary shit. Sleep with your hands at the side.
Texans,390ysm,Next_Episode,2,Mon Jun 8 16:51:03 2015 UTC,"I think I'm pretty good mentally, I don't dream like that often, and the GoT episode from last night may have had something to do with it too. That was honestly my first really violent dream in quite some time, probably 6 months or so.  My dreams are always vivid though, I commented on here once about the level of detail my dreams get into, so that wasn't a surprise to me. The content was definitely different though, the last weird dream I had was after watching Bronson on Netflix, lol. And I sleep with my hands under my pillow or head most times, does that suffice?"

Texans,390ysm,Thebassist140,3,Mon Jun 8 16:01:22 2015 UTC,I get that sense from some professors too. They gotta do this online thing to get back to their physical classes. Online classes are fun.

Texans,390ysm,BisonST,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:55:06 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have a role in breaking down food in your stomach. That role belongs to HCl. It does help with constipation, as your intestines rely on an osmotic gradient to transfer some nutrients and create the stool that you will eventually pass. Unless you're severely dehydrated, nociceptors (pain neurons) shouldn't be effected by water. And with that, temperature has no effect on any of these functions listed. Just my two cents. It's one of these homeopathic remedies based off of someone's experience, not science. As far as my education has taught me (biomedical engineering BS and half a medical school education completed), this is nothing more than a rumored health fad."

Texans,38wc4i,Skarmotastic,12,Sun Jun 7 21:37:15 2015 UTC,"partial /r/theydidthemath   Using this picture from 2014 to estimate arm size  He measured in at 34"" arm length at the combine, so on a rough estimate of his acromion process to his finger tip, like so , in this picture is pixel 218x414 -> 175x1174. Using Pythagoras makes the line a length of 761.215 pixels (to 3dp).  Also from the same picture we can estimate arm width, like so, which is pixel 177x614 -> 284x645. Again using pythag makes a line length of 111.400 (to 3dp)  If the first line is 34"" long and 761.215 pixels long, that means his 1 inch is 22.389 pixels. This means that his arm is 4.975 inches wide at that point.  I don't know how to work out circumference from that, but 5 inches wide front on is quite big I would think...  Feel free to check the math"
Texans,38wc4i,DSmith96,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:02:07 2015 UTC,"To get circumference, you'd have to make the assumption that his arms is a perfect circle. Then, you'd use the formula circumference = pi*diameter. That would make his arms have approximately a 15.6215"" circumference. In actuality, his arm would probably be more ovoid in shape, so you would need the distance from the dorsal apex of the tricep, to the ventral apex of the bicep."
Texans,38wc4i,MDfootball2014,2,Sun Jun 7 17:54:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah i didn't know how to go about doing it as they're obviously not a perfect circle, or even close to it  If anyone could get a side on picture of his complete arm we could complete the math"
Texans,38wc4i,DSmith96,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:56:26 2015 UTC,"Not sure how useful these approximations will be since I have 14"" biceps after not being in a gym for 3 years, while Hulk Hogan had apparently massive 24"" arms, so our error might wipe out anything useful. I think we have to go with an ellipse as the cross section of a bicep; circumference of an ellipse is complicated but google has a calculator. When I started typing this I thought you had calculated both dimensions of his arm; ballparking my arm, I got 3in on the short axis, 4in on the long, so 4/3= 1.33, so we'll say the long axis is ~30% longer than the short, so his arm is ~5in and 6.5in axes on an ellipse. Put it all into google and we get 36.28 inches, 50% bigger than Hulk Hogan and 5 inches larger than the previous world record!   At first I regretted putting any time into this but knowing JJ has literally the largest arms in the world is pretty cool.  Google's ellipse calculator must use some different variables 4in x 3in doesn't give the right shape, and I'm not taking exact measurements and* calculating ""complete elliptic integrals of the second kind"" to try to finish this, because I totally could if I wanted to.  edit 2; so yeah, using radii instead of diameters, things work out way better. My own estimate comes back as 11"" circumference compared to 14"" measured, so the method might spit out a small number, and using 6.5 and 5 I get 18.14in for JJ, adjust up a little bit we could say 19-20"" pretty easily, and average is apparently right around me at 13.5 inches. So without further info I'm going to say about 20""."

Texans,38se39,bootycallSAUL,10,Mon Jun 8 17:43:41 2015 UTC,Fuck Houstin festivals in the SUMMER WTF. Why the hell don't we have a Winterfest?! I'd love to goto a fest in a hoodie. People are going to die his weekend.
Texans,38se39,MisallocatedRacism,6,Sat Jun 6 14:35:07 2015 UTC,I never understood that.. Like summers here can be pretty brutal... Why the fuck would you hold it in the middle of summer.. That's fucking insanity..
Texans,38se39,bootycallSAUL,4,Sat Jun 6 15:17:34 2015 UTC,"First you have to understand the history of FPSF. The first year they held the event, it was free or like $10 for the whole weekend; my memory is somewhat fuzzy on the details but I remember it being dirt cheap. The reason most music fests are held in the summer is because the number of touring bands is MUCH higher. With already established festivals like ACL, Bonaroo, Coachella and Pitchfork booking a large portion of the most in-demand bands, FPSF originally was held in the middle of August to avoid scheduling conflicts. This allowed them to book Of Montreal and Broken Social Scene as the headliners, which is pretty impressive for a nascent free music fest. The rest of the lineup was mostly local and regionally touring bands. The following year they moved the festival to the beginning of June because it's slightly more bearable and there was little competition.  From '09-'12, the festival would TRIPLE in size and the ""Summer Fest"" brand was gaining nationwide recognition. In 2013, they sold out for the first time, and also received key sponsorships from national brands. Now, in it's 7th incarnation, FPSF has to demonstrate to it's sponsors that they can become a permanent fixture in an industry that is becoming more competitive every season. Given the growing pains that they have already endured since '12, it would be foolish of them to kill their momentum and re-brand in a cooler season.  Source: Toured in a ""college rock"" band from '08-'11 and played at a handful of festivals, including 2 appearances at FPSF."
Texans,38se39,GOTO_Velociraptor,3,Sat Jun 6 18:17:18 2015 UTC,But why no winter festivals here?
Texans,38se39,MisallocatedRacism,3,Sat Jun 6 19:42:28 2015 UTC,"It's probably not economically viable.  Winter festivals are hard enough to book due to the lack of nationally touring bands to fill out the undercard. Then when you consider the dates, you're pretty much looking at Jan-Feb, unless we want to directly compete with Austin during SXSW or F3F. Jan-Feb comes with the increased the risk of having inclement weather, and potential attendees will have less disposable income to spend due to the expenses of the holiday season."

Texans,38o7fe,givememoreluisplease,-1,Fri Jun 5 16:15:56 2015 UTC,Haha you guys are so ignorant on our cap situation.  Everything is set up perfectly for resigning our 2012 draft class. All these old vets can be cut at anytime with no harm to our long term cap.  It's how you build when you draft a good qb and have him in his rookie deal. Sign people who can help now that you can cut in 1-2 years. Just focus on maybe trying to get a qb (mallet is in no way the answer) and less on us.
Texans,38o7fe,MrKittenz,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:46:59 2015 UTC,Can you tell me why you think Mallett is not the answer please?
Texans,38o7fe,Random908,0,Sun Jun 7 00:47:55 2015 UTC,"I don't even know where to start if you think a guy who has started 2 games in his career and looked okay in one and horrible in the other is the answer to your qb situation. I understand why you guys would be optimistic considering your a qb away from being super bowl contenders, but I just don't see a reason to be so over the top excited about him yet. Remember how crazy you guys went over Case? I'm really not trying to talk shit either. I watched the game tape someone put together on his potential, but I'm just not sold. Can you tell me why you think he is so impressive yet didn't start the season as the starter in his 4th season? He has 79 pass attempts in his career."
Texans,38o7fe,MrKittenz,2,Sun Jun 7 06:30:30 2015 UTC,"1). He didn't start the season because he got here in August. There is no person who can arrive at a football team in August and then start the first game.  2). You said ""Mallett is in no way the answer"" in your previous post. I was asking what definitive proof you have that no one else seems to have, including the coaches. In OTAs he has destroyed any idea of a QB battle between Hoyer and him. He has looked like far and away the better QB.  3). He played two games. The bad one he played WOTH A TORN PECTORIAL. Thats right, he played with a season ending injury. I think it's fair to say that that game should be taken out of the discussion.  4). that first game he played was above average to good. Add in the fact that he had only two weeks to build a rep with the first team WRs, and Oline, and our elite RB was out, and you've got yourself an even better game. Did you watch his presnap reads? His pocket presence? His accuracy? Did you see how much better the Oline played when he started? That is the why we think he will be good. Add in the coach went out of his way to trade for him, and prefers him to the other QBs last year, and likely this year, and we're going to trust the coach. He made the defense back off because he had the ability to throw it deep. BOB seemed to give him full reign of the playbook, unlike Fitzy. Case's biggest problem IMO, is that he can't sense blitzes. He can't make adjustments at the line to counter the blitzes, and he never got better at it. In a full season of starting, he never improved. Ryan, is already great at that coming in. He hardly got hit. He had an extremely quick release, the quickest in the league at the time. He went through his reads and threw his receivers open, another thing Case couldn't do. Look at the rookie evaluation he got, and look at the weaknesses. How many of them have turned into strengths, and how many did I list here? Thats the difference between him, and Case"
Texans,38o7fe,Random908,0,Sun Jun 7 12:53:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry, obviously I don't know for sure. I didn't mean to imply that. Can you name me 5 starting qbs you would rather have him over? He has 70 some pass attempts at 27 years old. I just think you guys are being overly optimistic like you guys did with Case."
Texans,38o7fe,MrKittenz,3,Sun Jun 7 17:31:10 2015 UTC,"The reason we are so optimistic, is because we trust our coach, and he has shown way more in terms of improvement than Case ever did. Obviously I can name players I'd rather have, but we don't have the ability to get those players, we have to make our own. So far, this is the best we've got.

Texans,38o7fe,Muzikhead,11,Fri Jun 5 22:09:45 2015 UTC,The Colts have built their history on ignoring defense and relying on their QB to carry them to wins.  When they won the Super Bowl in 2006 they did it with the 23rd ranked defense.  By far the worst defense to ever win a Super Bowl.  Now they are trying to do the same thing.  Create the most efficient offense in the league with the best depth.  However there is a problem with this tactic.  Andrew Luck isn't Peyton Manning.  Now don't get me wrong.  Luck is very very good.  One of the best in the league.  But he isn't as good as Peyton.  He throws more interceptions with better receivers while under less pressure.  When he does get sacked he loses more yards.  And he's just not as accurate.    This team looks very much like the Peyton Manning era Colts.  Lots of post season appearances and lots of post season losses.  But at least with Peyton those post season losses were actually close.

AFC Championship Game: The Patriots were poised to take down the Colts again leading 21-6 at half.

Texans,38o7fe,lagatron,3,Fri Jun 5 20:18:16 2015 UTC,"Andre likely is over the hill and his production showed it last year. I could see that even when I was still rooting for him.  Also, the Manning and AJ situations are hardly alike, so lets not play like Colts fans are somehow morally superior because they cheered Manning's return - your organization cut him and moved on and Manning, who clearly wanted to stay, went to play for a non-rival who was out of conference. Andre asked to be let go and went to play directly for our largest and most direct rival after acting like a diva for two years. Manning endeared himself to fans and ended his tenure with grace, while AJ put distance between himself and fans and ended his tenure with a slap to their face."
Texans,38o7fe,slowcassowary,2,Fri Jun 5 21:55:58 2015 UTC,I thought he was told he was being phased out? Hence the asking to be let go?
Texans,38o7fe,coda19,3,Sat Jun 6 01:19:13 2015 UTC,"He had been making noise and quitting on the team well before being asked to take a reduced role. He was asked as a result of his reduced production and subsequently asked to be released.  I don't feel like making two posts, so I'll go on to say that I'm fairly sure wasn't just our QB situation. Though I'm sure it was frustrating for him, but he dropped far more balls than I've ever seen from him before and lost as many fumbles as the rest of his career combined, catching less than 60% of his targets. Despite his still sharp route running, he had somewhat lost the burst to be a real threat in the vertical game, so his average reception length, longest reception, and total yards all dropped. Maybe it was just his heart not being in it, but he didn't look like the same player at all."

Mallett looked solid passing the ball in between the numbers, keeping it in catchable spots for the receivers. His confidence with the offense is apparent as he constantly talks to receivers after reps to discuss certain aspects of the play.  It was an up and down day for Brian Hoyer throwing the football. Inside the numbers, Hoyer had moments where he looked good but with throws outside the numbers, he struggled with accuracy, leaving passes to be broken up by defenders. Hoyer is the safety blanket of the Texans offense but his accuracy has to gets sharper as camp progress."
Texans,38oacz,da1hobo,10,Fri Jun 5 15:04:48 2015 UTC,It sounds like he is just creating offseason fodder because there is no other news.  That's ok with me though because I neeeeeeeed football.
Texans,38oacz,at_work_safe_acct,8,Fri Jun 5 16:03:46 2015 UTC,Pancakes was on our local sports station earlier in the week.   When pressed he said as of right now he saw Hoyer starting week 1.  Media sure does have a hard on for Hoyer.
Texans,38oacz,My-Names-Jeff,0,Fri Jun 5 19:18:24 2015 UTC,I hate to be the one who spreads rumors but I think I read/heard about BoB giving Hoyer more opportunities than he deserves because he thinks he can beat Mallett out. maybe the media (who has access to the practices and can see much more than us) notices this and are putting their eggs in the Hoyer basket.
Texans,38oacz,w2eatherman,2,Fri Jun 5 19:54:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah I remember seeing that tweet from Jayson Braddock. It just seems to be completely the opposite mentality from what BoB has went about things. Nothing is given, it's all earned"
Texans,38oacz,Sydeffect94,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:00:23 2015 UTC,"PatDStat, who's been at the practices, says that they're all being divided up equally.  On his podcast, he said they're literally splitting first team reps 50/50. And Brian Hoyer hasn't looked good. There was apparently a drill where Hoyer was asked to make a touch pass to a standing target in the back of the end zone with no rush, and he was still overthrowing his guy.  Don't get me wrong, It's not like I've been there, but with all the positive feedback on Mallett throughout OTA's - doesn't this just further confirm Mallett's standing on the depth chart?"
Texans,38oacz,iammattchambers,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:05:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I'm assuming, it's why I don't believe what Braddock said."
Texans,38oacz,Sydeffect94,2,Sat Jun 6 16:14:24 2015 UTC,"This is my one worry.   Is that BoB will try his hand at Hoyer first because Hoyer has more experience.   I really hope not, I'd hate to repeat last year and waste half the season with a known commodity in Hoyer that isn't really good.   I think it would be smarter to put all eggs in the Mallett basket and if he fails then switch to Hoyer for damage control.   That way we will know what we have in all of our QBs and can move forward in the next draft."
Texans,38oacz,My-Names-Jeff,7,Fri Jun 5 20:06:38 2015 UTC,I'd really love it if the best players won the job.

Texans,38gqs0,Logorrhea_,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:20:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right about the cortico vs anabolic confusion. Thanks for pointing that out....some quick reading cleared that up for me.    I am aware of the blood doping thing with Lance. Learning about that piece helped me understand more about PEDs and sports, mainly that they can be aimed at any part of the training cycle on not just muscle growth. There's a lot of talk that PEDs in MMA and other competition combat sports are really being used to prevent injury and decrease recovery times/increase active training times as opposed to getting ripped.   There's some book on doping in cycling that I've been meaning to read but am forgetting the title of. The history of the two is pretty intertwined with the team physician often being the most important team member in the not so distant past."
Texans,38gqs0,MisallocatedRacism,3,Thu Jun 4 17:36:59 2015 UTC,"That would he awesome. What an inspiration to the Texans and the fan base. Before he was diagnosed and I watch him play, he stood out to me not only because of that silly name, but because I'd see him in damn near every big play during the preseason. Could just be hindsight rose colored glasses, but I think he could be good if he can recover."

Texans,38fx2x,DoktorStrangelove,10,Thu Jun 4 23:57:18 2015 UTC,AFC east is going to be tough and I can imagine the NFC south could give us two losses.   My guess:  4-2 division  2-2 vs AFC east  2-2 vs NFC south  2-0 vs Chiefs/Bengals  10-6 final record.

Texans,38fx2x,ChiliWillie,5,Thu Jun 4 00:52:24 2015 UTC,10-6 but 11-5 isn't out of the picture with our defense even if our QB situation ends up kinda like last year.

Texans,38fx2x,5213,0,Thu Jun 4 03:07:21 2015 UTC,9-7 with decent health and crazy turnovers though (which is mostly luck). Fortunately our schedule is still not bad but with andre gone and our qb situation still up in the air I think we max out at 9-7. 7-9 or 8-8 wouldn't surprise me
Texans,38fx2x,no_one_knows42,3,Fri Jun 5 07:24:59 2015 UTC,"Decent health? Seriously? We had THREE QBs go down to injuries. Clowney and Nix out for the full year (not to mention Ballentine). Then Cushing was playing hobbled and not 100%, Andre Johnson was not 100% (or not 100% committed perhaps?), how many times was Foster hobbled? Quite a few and he even missed games, and on top of all that we had secondary injuries pile up in the middle of the season but we barely noticed that because our young CBs stepped up big time (Rolle, Morris, Bouye).   Tell me again about our health."
Texans,38fx2x,edwardsamson,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:20:16 2015 UTC,"Our qbs weren't exactly Peyton manning. The only injury that really hurt was mallet because we couldn't see what we had. Foster can't be expected to play more than ~12 games. Cushing was seemingly fine. Clowney absence admittedly hurt, but we were definitely not as injured as most teams. Football is rough, you're gonna deal with plenty of injuries. Or maybe 2013 just left me thinking its normal to have everyone hurt"

Texans,38du7e,LdZppln,3,Wed Jun 3 18:32:46 2015 UTC,Nope. They kept being insanely difficult and it's almost literally impossible to get them on the phone. We just relied on my salary to get us through.
Texans,38du7e,Kage613,3,Wed Jun 3 18:44:24 2015 UTC,"If they don't respond, that means you get unemployment. Also, you get back unemployment so keep on it. You might get a check for $3,000 once it finally goes through. And remember, this is paid for as insurance by the company as a cost of doing business, not a government hand out."

Texans,38du7e,dseals,2,Wed Jun 3 19:04:29 2015 UTC,I'm working towards an electrical engineering degree. I'm finally switching to full time status this fall so I can really gear towards it instead of the snail's pace I was doing before.  Check out Kyle or Lockhart. Both are about the same distance from San Marcos as Wimberly. Kyle is on the highway though so you might not want that.
Texans,38du7e,LOOK_AT_IT,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:18:18 2015 UTC,Kyle's dirt cheap though. So affordable to live there.
Texans,38du7e,LOOK_AT_IT,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:08:43 2015 UTC,"Currently living in Kyle, not so dirt cheap, especially home prices. Austin is driving the housing prices up like crazy in this area."

Texans,38du7e,LdZppln,4,Wed Jun 3 19:45:04 2015 UTC,"So one of my favorite players from my alma mater got picked up by you guys as an UDFA.  There's a really good chance he won't make the team and might have already been cut, but I can find any news anywhere on the little guys outside the spotlight.  Any idea where or what sites I can look into this with?"
Texans,38du7e,Caradryan,3,Wed Jun 3 19:24:18 2015 UTC,"Who is your guy?  Following the beat reporters on Twitter is usually the best place to get info on OTA's.  When articles are written, it's usually just a collection of tweets from the day.  Your guy has to do something to get a call out though.  Good or bad.    http://www.scout.com/nfl/texans/ does the most write ups for OTAs and smaller name guys I feel."
Texans,38du7e,da1hobo,3,Wed Jun 3 19:58:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  It's Quinn Backus and haven't heard anything since he got picked up.  Probably won't make it due to position depth, but hope he does well"
Texans,38du7e,LOOK_AT_IT,2,Wed Jun 3 20:05:36 2015 UTC,"Well being that he's a strong safety he's got a big leg up because that's a position without a starter at the moment.  No arrangements were made prior to cutting Swearinger so the only options are guys we picked up, last year's backup Eddie Pleasant, or converting a player from another position.  Your guy probably has as good a chance as anyone else if he's a quick learner.    He's on the smaller/slower side of the scale though.  Actually very similar to DJ in those areas so the door is open."
Texans,38du7e,Substituted,3,Wed Jun 3 20:12:34 2015 UTC,Yeah I hope he finds a spot somewhere.  He had a crazy year last year and great intuition.  Here's a reel from him last season.  He was able to read FCS qb's really well and has great vision on the ball.  Hope he works out so I have to buy two Texans jerseys this year.

I need you to dress up like Mary Poppins, take this pitcher of Kool Aid that I stole from Aaron and bring it to this house on Pine Street and Magnolia. When you get to the house knock exactly 3 times and then spin around twice. After you do that a man will answer the door and ask you to show him your stockings. You must then claim that a lady never reveals her undergarments, but the man will insist and then you will show him. Don't ask questions, just roll with it. Now you will enter a room with a TV, a chair, and an old man in that chair. You're going to pick up the glass on the table next to him and pour him a glass of the Kool Aid. You're then going to wiggle your nose and prance away while singing ""I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts."" Be sure to bring the pitcher with you. Can't trust that fucker with the Kool Aid.  Once you've done this, send me a picture of the pitcher to confirm that it was poured out, then I need you to delete the message, and destroy your phone. Don't worry I have another one on the way to you. Your pay will also be with the new phone. Don't screw this up."

Texans,38du7e,LOOK_AT_IT,3,Wed Jun 3 19:13:07 2015 UTC,Got a new job working at a port.    So I split my time between working 60 hours a week and playing a backlog of video games.  Right now I'm playing The Witcher 3.
Texans,38du7e,Kage613,3,Wed Jun 3 18:47:48 2015 UTC,I'm really liking it so far.  Yesterday I played for like 5 hours but when it was done I didn't really feel like I progressed very much within the game.  Which is good because I like games that are worth the price of admission (who doesn't?)....I like to get alot of mileage out of them.    Definitely learned to save often though.
Texans,38du7e,LOOK_AT_IT,2,Wed Jun 3 18:53:05 2015 UTC,Witcher 3 really brought out the old school gamer in me.  I'm going to wear out my F5 key.    I love the game so far.  I didn't have any plans last weekend and invested about 20 hours into the game and I still feel like I'm just scratching the surface of the story and that's with a total playtime close to 30 hours.  I only just finished the Baron's story line.    I'm doing every single side mission to level up because I'm playing on the second highest difficulty.  Seems like everything can 2 hit you.  One of the damn contracts I found for fighting a foglet was tough as fuck.  He was one shotting me from full health.
Texans,38du7e,Kage613,2,Wed Jun 3 19:09:44 2015 UTC,I went with blood and bones or whatever for difficulty because I didn't play the first two in this series.  Usually I do a second run through on higher difficulty but I doubt I'll have the time for this game.  You can still change it within the same game though so I'll maybe adjust once I've gotten some experience up.    I'm very obsessive with things that I have interest in.  I get really into them and have to do things to the fullest extent of capabilities.  So I can't leave a level without hitting all the question marks in the first level.  I can't walk by a building without looting it either.  This game will take me forever.
Texans,38du7e,jcdark,3,Wed Jun 3 19:20:35 2015 UTC,That game has consumed way too much of my life. Got it on release and I'm already on my 3rd play through. By far the best game I've ever played though.

Texans,38f4xh,teamFBGM,2,Wed Jun 3 20:18:55 2015 UTC,"We just bought some partial season tickets that cover 21 games (super cheap ones), and we did it mainly for the first dibs at playoff tickets haha.  You should give them a call....they hooked us up with a suite, took us on a tour around the stadium to show what we'd get if we bought FULL season tickets (which we'll consider next year), then we got to watch the game and eat their food in the suite.  I'm sure if they knew you were legit interested in buying season tickets they'd give yall the tour, so you could see if you'd dig the Churrascos Club Pass."
Texans,38f4xh,ImMayorOfTittyCity,2,Wed Jun 3 22:07:03 2015 UTC,Holy crap those prices are making me rethink my spot on the waitlist.. no way I can afford that.  Is the seat price list readily available? Could you share yours?

Texans,38f4xh,pawsforbear,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:26:20 2015 UTC,I have to assume the seating changes for each availability window?   The prices dont seem terrible but I definitely thought there would be options under $1700.
Texans,38f4xh,superdelux86,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:49:06 2015 UTC,"That was about my thought as well. I thought I could get tickets in a decent area for under 2k/ seat.

Texans,38f4xh,htownholditdown,2,Thu Jun 4 14:00:13 2015 UTC,"We used to have the Churrascos Club passes but switched season tickets a couple of seasons ago. It's a pretty cool experience, the food is good, you get to drink for free, they give you a program and some other swag, and they have live music in there. With that said, it is absolutely NOT worth $100 per ticket to get in there.   For us it was always a hassle, not only did we wanted to tailgate with friends but we park in the orange lot. That means we had to walk all the way across the stadium just to get to the Churrascos Club, and we missed out on the regular tailgate our friends host. Overall, we are much happier and have more money once we got rid of the Churrascos Club."
Texans,38f4xh,htownholditdown,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:02:34 2015 UTC,You say you only planned on going to maybe 5 or 6 regular season games...that's 75% of the season.

And I'm also not sure I will be in town for the Pats or Saints games due to work/ Thanksgiving. If retail on the tickets is 142/ each I think it would be cheaper just to let someone take my spot and buy tickets for the games I know I will make it to rather than buying the season and reselling those games since I wouldn't have to buy the Churrascos passes."
Texans,38f4xh,fastanez,2,Thu Jun 4 12:16:06 2015 UTC,"Totally your call, but you can always re-sell. That stadium sells out about every game, so there should be a worry that they wont sell. Plus, you would make money on them."
Texans,38al1d,Logorrhea_,20,Tue Jun 2 23:34:58 2015 UTC,"First UT fires you as head football coach, then you can't hack it as an NFL RB.  Mack's life has really gone to shit."
Texans,38al1d,mistere676,8,Wed Jun 3 12:42:50 2015 UTC,"Glad to see the D line depth.  Anyone else concerned about our O line depth though? Was checking out the depth chart today and we are very thin. I know none of the WRs can play, what about O line?"
Texans,38al1d,dseals,9,Tue Jun 2 23:37:10 2015 UTC,"Well most teams don't roll with more than 8 linemen anyway because the chance of injury for them is fairly low. But if you were looking at the depth chart on the team site then just throw that out the window because it doesn't have any of our UDFA signings.  As of right now our line looks like this:  RT: Newton, Yeatman, Joseph Treadwell (likely will be cut)  RG: Brooks, Newton (if the Ravens game is any indication Newton is the #2 RG and the #2 RT will take his place in the event of an injury), Cody White  C: Ben Jones, Su'a-Filo, Greg Mancz (likely a backup OG as well), James Ferentz (might be cut)  LG: Su'a-Filo, Cody White, Mancz (probably)  LT: Duane Brown, Jeff Adams, Kendall Lamm (one of Lamm or Adams will likely get the axe)  If all goes as planned that would give us 9 O-Linemen and we'd probably cut one more (White is likely the first to go in this case) and roll with 8. You just can't have a perfect set of 10 linemen when the roster limit is 53 players. Offensive line depth is usually based on quality not quantity and I'd say we have some quality depth in Mancz and Yeatman. Lamm or Adams would like be decent replacements at LT, but you can't ever really expect a backup LT to step in and replace Brown."
Texans,38al1d,TexansDefense,6,Wed Jun 3 00:59:35 2015 UTC,"Welp,  thanks dseals :)   That was really above and beyond and I feel a lot better now. Like,  I'm even going to sleep just a little bit better tonight because of you tackling that post right there. Right on."

Texans,384h8c,TripStep,34,Mon Jun 1 20:06:27 2015 UTC,"Vince Wilfork is getting comfortable with the team and his attitude is infectious, making everyone smile.   Vince may be the best signing of the offseason just for his attitude alone.   Keith Mumphery is taking to the veterans in front of him and put together another solid practice. He has strong hands and once again showed he can catch the ball, most importantly, in traffic.   This guy wasn't even projected to get drafted and we took him in the 5th round. God damn if he turns out to be a beast I might just OD on kool-aid.   A big jump has been made by second-year player Andre Hal who is working at both cornerback and safety.   I like Hal at safety. He just didn't look comfortable at CB. Maybe he can find his niche as a 2nd deep safety in 3 safety sets.   Ryan Mallett had a solid day throwing the football and is developing a good on-field relationship with Nate Washington.   At this rate we're going to start the season with 10 receivers on the roster.   Not to be overlooked is what Brian Cushing has done and how he is moving out on the field...Players are whispering that he looks like the “Old Cush” prior to the two knee surgeries.   So. Fucking. Hard. Right now."
Texans,384h8c,dseals,7,Mon Jun 1 20:19:35 2015 UTC,I like Hal at safety. He just didn't look comfortable at CB. Maybe he can find his niche as a 2nd deep safety in 3 safety sets.   The last slow physical corner we converted to safety was Quin so hopefully that trend will continue.

Texans,384h8c,bellsofwar3,2,Tue Jun 2 21:57:51 2015 UTC,"he can hit on a late pick every now and then, but if he's not hitting on the 1-3 round picks it's irrelevant.  one sleeper pick doesn't make him a draft guru."
Texans,384h8c,KKG_Apok,2,Wed Jun 3 01:08:54 2015 UTC,Maybe youre overreacting to 2013 which was a horrible year for the Texans. It seems like hes developed a solid roster.
Texans,384h8c,bellsofwar3,2,Wed Jun 3 01:42:55 2015 UTC,"in all honesty i think most of his drafts have been busts.  don't get me wrong, he's hit on a few but he's had more busts than hits.  while the roster is ""solid"" it's not great and contains many starters that wouldn't be starting for most teams."
Texans,384h8c,KKG_Apok,2,Wed Jun 3 02:23:27 2015 UTC,I think a lot of it was he was getting kubiaks guys that kubiak wanted. Wevr seen a complete style switch since obrien took over  I dont think it's fair to count his pre obrien era
Texans,384h8c,bellsofwar3,2,Wed Jun 3 02:43:33 2015 UTC,I'll definitely be on board with that argument of that's the case.
Texans,384h8c,da1hobo,3,Wed Jun 3 03:25:37 2015 UTC,I like Hal at safety. He just didn't look comfortable at CB.   I remember saying as much during the preseason last year.  The kid has strong hands and decent to good tackling ability.  He also doesn't take big risks when taking down a big running back.  He gets low and trips them up instead of trying to drag them down.  If he is significantly stronger he could easily move to safety.
Texans,384h8c,ianzilla,14,Tue Jun 2 02:25:44 2015 UTC,From all sources Mumphery has been killing it. Hopefully Strong can follow his example.

Texans,384h8c,da1hobo,8,Mon Jun 1 21:20:00 2015 UTC,"Mallett looked solid passing the ball in between the numbers, keeping it in catchable spots for the receivers. His confidence with the offense is apparent as he constantly talks to receivers after reps to discuss certain aspects of the play.   If there's one thing about Mallett it's that he's extremely confident.   And he inspires the same in his teammates.    Foster has been the the most surprising of all. Looking healthy and happy,   Happy Foster makes me happy."

I don't think he is the same but we signed a veteran two years older than Wilfork off of a practice squad last year and he started some games at NT and helped our run game. A nose tackle who was the starter on a team like the Patriots with his leadership and veteran mind next to Watt? It's a dream come true.
Texans,383pm8,Zaracen,5,Mon Jun 1 19:33:25 2015 UTC,off of a practice squad last year   I think he was sitting on the couch (i.e. teamless). There's a maximum league experience for practice squad membership.

He'll find a way to work around his weaknesses and turn them into strengths, and when the day comes when he can't do it anymore, he'll retire.    The man wants for nothing. He has a buttload of money, a beautiful wife, two kids, and the adoration and respect of his peers and millions of fans. I don't see him trying to irk out another year just for a paycheck.    He did seem to get worn down towards the end of the year. My guess is there's a significant possibility this is his last year, but my God, I hope he comes to the Texans for a year even if he's terrible.

Texans,37xqav,kckolbe,1 point,Sun May 31 15:38:01 2015 UTC,"I'll do a follow up in a few weeks and maybe go more in depth as to where our holes are, players I missed, etc. and maybe even touch on some things like our division rivals.  There's kind of a tension between completeness and readability and I didn't want to include an overwhelming amount of content."
Texans,37xqav,MDfootball2014,2,Sun May 31 19:28:48 2015 UTC,"My only complaint is that there is no Johnathan Joseph, who we picked up as a FA in 2011 for just under 10m a year.  Our defense was 30th at the time and 32nd against the pass.  He has been an amazing man cover corner, spending more time against #1 WRs than any CB in the league (through 2013 at least), and is also one of our leading tacklers due to mistakes among our LBs, something that should improve this year.  This is likely his last year on the team.  Despite his age, however, he has led all Texans CBs in snaps played over the past two years and is still a damn fine starter, with much of his decline due to moving more to a zone scheme, which isn't his strength (a slight contradiction to what was said in the Kevin Johnson section)."
Texans,37xqav,kckolbe,1 point,Sun May 31 12:14:09 2015 UTC,JJo was the next guy I would have added but I was at the character limit :\  And I do agree that he's still playing quite well; I just also think he's nearing the end of his shelf life.
Texans,37xqav,MDfootball2014,1 point,Sun May 31 14:49:22 2015 UTC,"I think it has more to do with our switch to zone coverage.  Like I said, J-Jo was the man at man.  I'll be sad to see him go, but letting him go somewhere else next year really is best for us.  I wonder if he'll retire a Texan.  If he goes back to Cincy, I could see him retiring there as well."
Texans,37xqav,kckolbe,2,Sun May 31 15:11:08 2015 UTC,"Has JJo ever mentioned retiring after this contract is up? I've never seen much mention to it, but that people expect him to because he will be too old to contribute effectively at his position. But, I feel that if he wanted another 2 year contract, he could pick one up else where. He could be a good corner to rotate in, despite his old age, and really help mentor a young secondary unit if needed."
Texans,37xqav,AndrewNaranja,1 point,Sun May 31 19:14:24 2015 UTC,"He might decide to retire, but I really doubt it.  Again, he's led the secondary in snaps the last two seasons and still produced well, so he clearly isn't done.  He's no longer a great fit for our scheme, but he's still capable.  He doesn't even need to be rotated in.  He can still start."
Texans,37xqav,5213,1 point,Sun May 31 19:18:13 2015 UTC,"I rationalized him being a corner to be rotated in because he seems to have an injury problem as of the last couple of seasons if I recall correctly. And I think that has a large amount to do with the amount of action he is seeing, especially with how often are defense is on the field with our offense in 2013 and 2014. I figured if you picked him up, and the situation allowed it, it would be better to use him sparingly, than to have him start every snap and possibly suffer another injury. But this right here is why I am not a head coach haha. I'll just stick to practicing medicine and fixing said injuries."
Texans,37xqav,gamesterdude,1 point,Sun May 31 19:24:34 2015 UTC,"he's led the secondary in snaps the last two seasons    Just stating this again to put injury concerns in context.  He's very healthy.  I'm not saying that spelling him more often is a bad idea, but it isn't necessary."
Texans,37xqav,c12w45g5,2,Sun May 31 19:30:39 2015 UTC,I'm still pissed the Panthers got a spot and we didn't.
Texans,37xqav,gamesterdude,2,Sun May 31 17:02:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you, OP!  I don't know as much as most when it comes to football, so stuff like this helps me understand more about the players and whatnot. I'd love it if you could do more posts like this for some more Texans players! (And maybe even the biggest threats the Texans face from other teams)"
Texans,37xqav,MDfootball2014,2,Sun May 31 18:57:35 2015 UTC,"I'll probably do a followup in a week or so with some of the stuff you mentioned.  I didn't want to let this get too too long so it would remain approachable to someone who knows absolutely nothing, but still serve to get them hyped and up to speed."
Texans,37xqav,Thinksl0w,1 point,Sun May 31 19:30:04 2015 UTC,"So for me colts are a fun rival as we always seem to go 50 50 against them. For me the Patriots are the ""fuck you guys"" team we always play. They knocked us out of playoffs both times and always embarrass us in primetime.   Finally, if you really want to learn the players pick up a copy of madden and play franchise as Texans. Then you really get to know the team including starting center to backup full back!"
Texans,37xqav,GOTO_Velociraptor,2,Sun May 31 13:02:08 2015 UTC,We lost against the Ravens the first time we were on the playoffs...
Texans,37xqav,mistere676,2,Sun May 31 18:58:09 2015 UTC,"Playing Madden is 100% the best way to learn the roster.  You can't get the story side of things so much from it, but if you want to know who is on the team, it really is the best way!"
Texans,37xqav,MrKittenz,3,Sun May 31 14:43:54 2015 UTC,Also I just got around to reading your bio on the players. I wouldn't say foster has an issue with staying healthy. I would say the Texans too often ran out of options and relied on him too much. When you run that many plays while carrying a team anyone would get worn out.   With that wide receiver core I see Obrien running spread formations a lot more that should take some pressure off foster and him stay healthy through post season.

Texans,37uyu1,w2eatherman,10,Sat May 30 22:55:36 2015 UTC,"I'm a non-American Texans fan, so forgive me for stating what might be obvious to you locals here; but isn't football basically religion in Texas? There's a reason why the Cowboys are one of the most valuable franchises in all of sports, and why the Texans, despite existing past the turn of the century, nevertheless are worth over a billion.  It's like soccer in Brazil or hockey here in Canada - it doesn't matter whether it's in some rural shithole in the middle of nowhere, if it's a bunch of kids or the best in the world: people can't get enough of it and they are going to fucking watch it. I watch OHL games here occasionally and I'm not even a big fan of hockey! I just do it because it's fun and it's around."
Texans,37uyu1,effortlessgrace,10,Sun May 31 01:45:59 2015 UTC,"you're right, that's the main reason we have such great support. football will always be king in this state, no matter how good our basketball and baseball teams are doing"

Texans,37uyu1,saxamaphon3,-7,Sat May 30 18:09:42 2015 UTC,"The only problem with how amazing we are as fans and crazy about the team is that we sell out no matter how good or bad we do. I think this leads to longer leashes on front office and coaching staff. If being mediocre meant mediocre attendance, Rick Smith and Kubiak would have been gone a long time ago."
Texans,37uyu1,StraightoutaBrompton,18,Sat May 30 19:28:36 2015 UTC,"That's not true. McNair has said in interviews that he believes the way to build a great team is by having continuity in leadership positions. He's noted how the Krafts, Rooneys, Maras, etc give their coaches more autonomy, allowing them to succeed. You may not like it or agree, but that's the way it is."

Texans,37rx2b,meatball4u,6,Fri May 29 22:25:38 2015 UTC,"He's a 6'6 beast that played at our LT position, and was really only one of the few seniors, if not the one senior that has a shot at the NFL this year, which is why I'm interested in him. Our senior class this past year was extremely small with out team being so young. He only allowed 2 sacks in 817 snaps, so pretty damn impressive.  Here is a photo gallery of him (#74) if anyone's interested."

Texans,37rx2b,TripStep,3,Sat May 30 05:46:55 2015 UTC,"Huh. This is cool, found an article back in April on 32 guys Dane Brugler of CBS thought were not invited to the combine but who he pridicted would get drafted. http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/nfl-draft-scout/25151389/nfl-draft-no-combine-no-problem-for-these-draftable-prospects  Your guy is the top tackle mentioned:  Kendall Lamm, Appalachian State (6-5, 302, 5.27): A four-year starter, Lamm was a mainstay for Appalachian State's offense in recent years, averaging only one sack allowed the past three seasons. His traits don't scream NFL prospect, but he gets the job done with adequate lateral range and the balance to mirror rushers on the edges. Lamm should get better as his technique improves, making him a viable developmental option.  EDIT: This gets me excited: http://www.appstatesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=21500&ATCLID=209930796  ""Lamm and Ross both had extremely impressive workouts as several scouts remarked on Lamm's excellent footwork""  ""In the weight room, Lamm recorded a 10-foot, one-inch broad jump, a number that was higher than any offensive lineman at this year's NFL Combine."""
Texans,37rx2b,dismemberedalive,2,Sun May 31 01:53:30 2015 UTC,"Awesome find! Thanks for the read. I do remember him not being at the combine, which I thought was some shit. And that broad jump is rediculous!"

A QB (situation) that at the bare minimum are people above the Dalton Line and we're stacked with YOUNG talent. We're only gonna get better from this point on.  Realistic Answer : Whenever we start sweeping the AFC South. We sweep the Jag and the Titans. When we can beat the Colts both times every year, we can start talking getting a tougher schedule.  We kind of need to start peaking NOW though. I want all the youngins now to be at their best preferably for the Texans vs Cowboys Super Bowl in 2017.

Texans,37qpoa,TripStep,15,Fri May 29 17:12:34 2015 UTC,"I honestly feel as though the Texans could be an elite team in only a couple years, and the only piece they really need at this point is solid consistent QB play."
Texans,37qpoa,kckolbe,3,Fri May 29 17:11:25 2015 UTC,"I think that the Giants and Ravens have shown that consistent QB play isn't necessary for a championship.  It's necessary to create a dynasty, but not a single Lombardi win."
Texans,37qpoa,KKG_Apok,3,Sat May 30 01:49:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Sure we need individual game consistency, and consistency in the playoffs, but I honestly think Hoyer is certainly capable of stringing together 5 good games come January, and I think Mallett probably has that ability too. And if that can come together along with health across the board, it's definitely possible to win a ring.. but you're right that doesn't make a dynasty."
Texans,37qpoa,PaintByLetters,1 point,Sat May 30 04:22:03 2015 UTC,Eli Manning is required though to take down Brady in a Super Bowl. It's a scientifically accurate statement supported by collected data.
Texans,37qpoa,freakybj,1 point,Sat May 30 20:24:10 2015 UTC,"Eli is so erratic, he's the only QB Belichick has no clue how to gameplan for."
Texans,37qpoa,chase-316,6,Mon Jun 1 01:43:41 2015 UTC,I think realistically we're 3 years minimum away.  Our QB of the future is more than likely not on the roster right now which means we will have to draft a QB in the first round of next year's draft.  His rookie season will have growing pains so we will have to wait until his second year to legitimately challenge Andrew Luck and the Colts.  I think drafting Clowney over  Bridgewater set us back.  But thinking positive... we don't know what Mallett or Clowney can do when healthy. If they turn out to be good then we are contenders this year.
Texans,37qpoa,electricalenginerd,15,Fri May 29 21:26:46 2015 UTC,"Our defense needs to show that it can shut down the offensive juggernauts in the league, Mallett/Hoyer need to show consistency, while also running the ball successfully even when the opposing teams knows we are going to run the ball.  We accomplish that, we can follow suit along the lines of the Ravens/Seahawks.  Unless Mallett truly is the chosen one, then all limits are off!!!!! KOOOOLLLAAAAIIIDDDD!"
Texans,37qpoa,mushyz,13,Fri May 29 17:35:15 2015 UTC,"I think this will be the year. From a football fundamental standpoint the Colts began their decline towards the end of the regular season. We would've taken the win in indy had fitz not been tripped and broke his leg. Meanwhile we were coming together as a team under BOB. Our defense was lights out after the bye week. I'm excited to see what mallet brings to the table this season. Assuming the browns game is his ceiling  (playing it safe), there's no reason we won't take the division"

Texans,37qpoa,cyclops1771,6,Fri May 29 20:43:55 2015 UTC,its the nfl. anything can happen. colts are 1 injury away from being a pretty shotty team. i think the biggest change ive seen last 5 years is we no longer expect to lose big games. maybe in a few more we will expect to win them all. i think we are fine tho. no way to seriously answer this.

Texans,37qpoa,kckolbe,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:05:11 2015 UTC,"Until we get a consistent, franchise level QB. Otherwise we're an 8-8 team forever."
Texans,37qpoa,raysweater,6,Sat May 30 00:13:00 2015 UTC,"Great point, except that we weren't 8-8 last year."
Texans,37qpoa,kckolbe,-1,Sat May 30 01:45:22 2015 UTC,"8-8 *average team. I'm not doing the math, but I'm sure as a franchise who has never had a franchise caliber QB, we're hovering around 8-8.  Edit: And really? A one win difference last year essentially proves the same point."
Texans,37qpoa,raysweater,1 point,Sat May 30 01:49:45 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind as well that I predicted 9-7 this year as well.  I can agree that we won't be a dominant team without a quality starter (not quite franchise level), but we can definitely be a playoff contender without one.  Using your own logic, we were less than 1 game from making the playoffs last year.  Once in the playoffs, it is anyone's game.  A simple 3 game hot streak and we are the champs.  8-8 and 9-7 may not seem like a big difference, but 9-7 is a chance at the playoffs right now, whereas 8-8 takes us out of contention."
Texans,37qpoa,kckolbe,0,Sat May 30 01:58:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we'll always be a team that has a chance to get in, and will get in at times, but will never have a real shot at a Super Bowl unless we find a franchise QB.  We'd be fool's gold forever, like the Bengals. After years of getting close and winning only a playoff game here and there, it will get old and tiring. We need to set our goals hire."
Texans,37qpoa,raysweater,1 point,Sat May 30 02:07:50 2015 UTC,"Again, once in, anything is possible.  Eli Manning, for example, has pretty poor numbers as a franchise QB (82.4 passer rating) and is more expensive than any QB we've had.  Surely, with a situation like that, the Giants would have no chance, and most years they've fared very poorly.  But twice they've won the Super Bowl with him, with season records of 9-7 and 10-6.
