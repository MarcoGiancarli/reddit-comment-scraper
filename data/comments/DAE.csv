Later that week we looked at a house, and the dining room window was the one from my dream and the view was the same. Other dreams have been as clear, but didn't come to pass. Yet."
DAE,3dzrwx,nachoqueen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:15:56 2015 UTC,"I had one months ago and it was rather ominous.  I was downstairs in a house that was mine in the dream, but I had never been to such a house. I heard some kind of noise upstairs, from up there and around a corner where I knew my sister's room was. Instantly i  understood there was a boy up there with my sister and that she was in immediate danger (not physical danger, but of humiliation, embarrassment, degradation, etc.) I switched from a state of fear and concern to one of blind fury and murderous rage against this person who was preparing to (or already had) defiled my sister. I ran up the stairs in my rage and the dream ended before I got to the top of them. It was rather odd now that I think of it, because I'm in no shape to sprint up a flight of stairs, but I had little trouble in the dream. We could perhaps dismiss that as simply an expression of mental will and emotion translating directly into superpowers that one always seems to take for granted in a dreamworld...  In real life, my sister does not live with me, she has her own house and is married with two boys. This dream sister might have been a minor, college age at most, not 37 like in real life.  The dream was disturbing by itself, but free more disturbing when, during my wife's and my quest to move into a cheaper house to move into, came across a really wonderful one that looked just like the one in my dream: its interior included a front hallway, lower floor area, claustrophobic staircase ending at a T intersection with bedrooms to the left and right of the upper floor hallway. The two rooms to the right were the girls' rooms. If I remember the floor plan from the dream, up the stairs, turn right, and turn right again puts me into the 'blue room' (as we call it), the bedroom of the older daughter of the former owner. The former owner had a very young daughter and a son as well.  I don't know what else to make of it. It's pure speculation from here onward. But as the former owner happened to mention, her oldest daughter was pregnant and a single mother. The mother did not talk about it in a shameful way, but more of a 'we will get through this' manner, as though the pregnancy were less of a mistake than a trauma.  I fear to inquire further."

My parents had just gotten divorced, I had got cheated on by my girlfriend and I was working 6 days a week at a job where I could have knocked my boss unconscious at any given time.   I thought it was acid reflex for quite a while, went to several different doctors. Did allergy tests, got allergy shots (I have some environmental allergies they think caused stomach issues because of the nasal drip that would occur...gross i know). None of it really worked.   Finally, I gave up and slowly slipped into depression. The more depressed I got, the more I realized that this would flair up out of nowhere when I was stressed or anxious. I started taking anti-anxiety pills and have been golden ever since.   TL;DR: Felt this a few years back, turned out it was bad stress/anxiety.

I started doing this this to pass the time when I would walk home alone. It turned more electronic as I started diving into house and techno around 15. Last year I bought Ableton so I could turn these brain compositions into actual music. It's hard to translate sometimes but it's very satisfying! I also occasionally dream in composition and create with symphonies that I can usually remember for a bit after I first wake up..."

DAE,3ddyke,Swankymcdoogle,-1,Sat Jul 18 09:18:33 2015 UTC,"There are many ways to find out. The best way is to know body language and be able to pick up on the clues.   Another way is observation. Look at celebrities. Do you look similar to any of them? If you do, are they considered attractive?   You can even go the scientific route and look at how symmetrical your face is. The more symmetrical, the more attractive you will be.   At the end of the day, attractiveness only goes so far. It can be argued that personality is the ruling factor. You can be attractive all day long but if you have a poor personality, then you wont get anywhere."

I'm a Christian so I don't believe in suicide and I also believe I'll go to heaven once I do die. I just think about how small and worthless all this is. Waking up to go to work to make money, to eat healthy, to look pretty, to get married... for what? To die at one point. No one's getting out alive.

European ear scoops produced up to the early 19th century were made from either bronze or precious metals such as silver.

DAE,3cth9p,awutnow,2,Fri Jul 10 17:19:51 2015 UTC,Right there with you. It just feels safer
DAE,3cvbes,Free_,3,Sat Jul 11 01:59:22 2015 UTC,"You mean a swimming pool filled with chlorinated, filtered, clean water?  Yeah!  I always do feel extra clean after swimming in one of those, for some reason..."
DAE,3cvbes,happyself,-1,Sat Jul 11 14:54:58 2015 UTC,Get your happy self out of my thread.
DAE,3cvbes,happyself,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:21:50 2015 UTC,"lol, just being sarcastic with ya.  I do know what you mean and I actually prefer how clean a hot tub makes me feel/smell, as well as my GF.  After (or during) the hot tub is the only time I go south, because of this ""clean"" effect :)"
DAE,3crt2v,demigodrickli,5,Fri Jul 10 06:47:30 2015 UTC,"It just means, ""That's nice, I don't really want to keep talking."" There really isn't an SMS protocol for ""I have to go."" The messages are meant to be casual and, in a way, timeless. You never say goodbye, you just don't respond. People can't reconcile that, so they say something you can't really respond to. How do you respond to ""LOL"" or ""Haha""? You don't. And that's exactly the expected response."
DAE,3crt2v,dragontology,3,Fri Jul 10 09:04:54 2015 UTC,"It depends, but that's definitely the case when someone replies with ""haha"". It's as if they're trying to convince you that they're laughing."
DAE,3crt2v,embigger,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:49:55 2015 UTC,I only do it when something merits it

DAE,3cvg3m,Golden_showers,4,Sat Jul 11 02:43:08 2015 UTC,I see what you're getting that but I think that upvotes being anonymous really counters that.
DAE,3cvg3m,asianmangg,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:51:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah I suppose, but not when it's a comment on your own post, like now for example..  I should have specified that I mean replies to your previous comments.  See how I waited 18 hours?"

DAE,3crjyx,Craptastic1234,2,Fri Jul 10 05:09:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Happens also when I hear a song I enjoy on the radio, but much less of an effect than what you describe."
DAE,3cqq4e,_otterinabox,2,Fri Jul 10 00:36:31 2015 UTC,I keep it pinned to my taskbar and always up. I just minimize it so all I can see is the cpu and ram graphs and always have it up so I can check it
DAE,3cqq4e,penatrater51,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:39:47 2015 UTC,I do all the time. I don't keep it up though because it's just another process running that I don't need.   I mainly use it to check to see where there is a slow up.
DAE,3cqq1f,BohBohShotBoh,3,Fri Jul 10 00:35:58 2015 UTC,"I have an obsession with collecting books. I have only read about half of the ones I own. Every time I walk past the cases,  I get anxiety--like they are screaming at me to digest their content, a disappointment that I'm wasting their potential to be read elsewhere."
DAE,3cqq1f,ddefiore,2,Fri Jul 10 03:12:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm reading 2 books right now and have 2 more in the wait and I feel some anxiety cause I haven't finished the fuckers yet"
DAE,3cqq1f,mortalkomic,2,Fri Jul 10 01:38:34 2015 UTC,Exactly. Now think of the few books you set down and never picked back up. Now think of then dozens of books you've thought of reading. Now think of the millions of books in the worlds.
DAE,3cqq1f,mortalkomic,2,Fri Jul 10 01:45:22 2015 UTC,"I'll admit that grand of a scale is where I stop worrying, but it is a shame I never finished LOTR . But hey, just renewed a book from the library. Two more weeks, there's still hope!"

DAE,3coost,Kryeiszkhazek,2,Thu Jul 9 15:25:33 2015 UTC,"thats actually kind weird you'd bring that up...  My grandma has like a dozen magazine subscriptions and she leaves them all around the house. Specifically in the dining and living rooms she has like a basket set to display them and I always get uncomfortable and turn the displays around. I will actually put the bathroom basket outside the door when I do my business.   and full disclosure when you said he put black tape over their eyes, I fully entertained doing so before I realized that's fucking insane"

DAE,3cl7i7,brianreading,6,Wed Jul 8 19:47:19 2015 UTC,I was at a friend's hunting cabin by myself for a whole week. Everytime I cooked it was like I was on a cooking show. I'd even look into the camera.

DAE,3cl7i7,80sKid,3,Wed Jul 8 21:56:28 2015 UTC,It's not an inner monologue when you say it out loud.
DAE,3cl7i7,JD5000,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:06:57 2015 UTC,"It's still the same process going on though, except that you are verbally saying it as opposed to thinking it.   People that say it out loud probably have that condition were it's hard for them to visualize things."
DAE,3cl7i7,80sKid,2,Wed Jul 8 22:25:30 2015 UTC,Yea I'm literally speaking exactly what I'm thinking.. I'll sort of switch from my head to out loud for some reason..   But I don't feel like I have trouble visualising things. Sometimes I think I visualise things too much and get disappointed when they don't turn out how I wanted.

Like I'll talk in my normal voice to ""him"" than answer back as ""him"" in another voice. I notice I do it more when I'm freaking out about something. I try to imagine how he'd respond. And then later I usually ask him about it for real, just to see how well I know him. I'm usually wrong."
