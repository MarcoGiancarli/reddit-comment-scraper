MitchellAndWebb,3a3ym0,justonewordforyou,13,Mon Jun 22 06:28:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm the same way. It's sometimes called fremdscham (as opposed to schadenfreude), or vicarious embarrassment.   It makes watching shows like Peep Show or The Office difficult, even if you find them very funny. And it makes places like /r/cringe a nightmare."
MitchellAndWebb,3a3ym0,KingWiltyMan,5,Wed Jun 17 03:04:26 2015 UTC,"That's awesome! Thank you so much. Someone else suggested I wasn't used to British bleakness which I think may be true. But then again I'm a pretty bleak person, so who knows. Thanks for teaching me two new words."
MitchellAndWebb,3a3ym0,Vorocano,3,Wed Jun 17 09:04:31 2015 UTC,TIL a new word. Schadenfreude is such a nasty part of being human so it's nice that the opposite exists. Cheers.
MitchellAndWebb,3a3ym0,Meath77,7,Wed Jun 17 03:47:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe you arent used to British bleakness? Louie is a show that gives you bleak moments but definitely also goes for some warmth, thought provocation, and closure (ofa sort.) Peep Show wont set up warm moments unless its to underscore the terrible shit show that follows- enhancing its hilarity in the eyes of the faithful."
MitchellAndWebb,3a3ym0,BeeCDN,3,Wed Jun 17 03:37:54 2015 UTC,So true. I think you may have found out why I feel so shitty afterwards.
MitchellAndWebb,3a3ym0,fucking_righteous,11,Wed Jun 17 09:07:45 2015 UTC,"<The writing and acting is so amazing it's easy to forget they are characters.>  Very much agreed. Any time I see Webb in an interview, he is always very well spoken and comes across as quite intelligent. And every time I feel surprised, and weirdly intimidated. I would have thought I'd have learned by now."
MitchellAndWebb,3a3ym0,xsolv,26,Wed Jun 17 04:20:51 2015 UTC,"Quite the opposite. I'm currently travelling around the States, and there have been days where I've felt self concious and out of place, especially when in hostels full of loud Australians with six packs. I stayed a few days with an American friend in Iowa, where I introduced him to Peep Show -he loved it, so we watched loads. I'm now in San Diego, and when those feelings of out-of-place anxiety arise I can reflect, ""Don't worry, don't fight it. There's nothing wrong with this, you're just feeling like Mark Corrigan""   Peep Show affirms to me that it's actually ok to be overly analytical when dealing with personal interaction, to view the world as a scary place that you have to muddle through, to treat 'chilled out fun' as some sort of modern monstrosity. In fact, Mark's level of awful, awful awkwardness is kind of glorious. Peep Show reminds me to revel in this glory.  That makes sense, right?"
MitchellAndWebb,3a3ym0,captinc,3,Wed Jun 17 01:44:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah it makes sense, I guess I could view it in that way. I'm actually from the US also. I can totally relate with the being overly analytical when dealing with other people. Great actors though, great writers, and I love Mitchell and Webb."
MitchellAndWebb,3a3ym0,rabbithunter7,9,Wed Jun 17 01:54:15 2015 UTC,"Just remember that about 90% of the shitty things that happen to Mark and Jezza are either their own fault or the fault of the other person in the pair. Their lives are awful, and they only have themselves to blame.  Edit to add: I do kind of agree with you though, there are a lot of episodes where I laugh, but feel vaguely bad about it. Some of it is so cringey that you feel awkward for having watched it."
MitchellAndWebb,3a3ym0,mistermarsbars,3,Wed Jun 17 01:40:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, the cringing and awkwardness is a good way to explain it."

MitchellAndWebb,3a3ym0,peter__venkman,5,Wed Jun 17 21:41:30 2015 UTC,"It makes me feel shitty because up until a few years ago, my life could have easily gone in the direction that Mark and Jeremy's went. I was Mark in that I just seemed to be drifting aimlessly through life and had a lot of plans that I never saw through. And I was Jeremy because I fell in love with someone every 5 minutes and never took any personal responsibility. Fortunately, I never became even a little bit like Superhans, even when it was really rough. So I've got that going for me!"

MitchellAndWebb,3a4xd2,DrCoquenbols,-34,Thu Jul 16 02:15:47 2015 UTC,"Why are there so many questions like this in this sub? ""Why is peep show a television show?"" - ""why are their actors in peep show?"".   Are you really asking why you think something is funny? Are you without your own agency? Can you not critically think? What prompted you to ask this question?   A large naan is basically like 3/5 pieces of bread worth of carbs. Ordering 4 is like ordering an entire loaf of bread if it's big naan.  See my issue is that you understand it because you laughed. Or you are one of those people who just learned to laugh when other people laugh because you don't really understand humor."

Stuff just is or isn't, and will be different for everybody"
MitchellAndWebb,3a4xd2,peter__venkman,10,Wed Jun 17 18:13:36 2015 UTC,"I didn't say calm down. I said lighten up.   Basically someone says, at the very least ""hey remember this? It was funny"" and at the very worst ""hey, let's have a discussion about comic theory"", and you went off on a ""I hate"" speech.   You seem to be a very angry person."
MitchellAndWebb,3a4xd2,Rpanich,-16,Wed Jun 17 18:19:19 2015 UTC,"Dude I'm calmer than you are.      I didn't say calm down. I said lighten up.   Obviously you're not a golfer  Do you generally judge people after reading two posts in semi-obscure sub-forum of a corporate-owned link aggregation website?  Could you please cite where I used the word ""hate"" or even anything remotely eluding to hate?"
MitchellAndWebb,3a4xd2,peter__venkman,7,Wed Jun 17 20:32:46 2015 UTC,"Are you REALLY asking me to pinpoint the word? Are you REALLY unable to understand? Maybe if you could CRITICALLY THINK and HAD YOUR OWN AGENCY, you'd be able to understand the tone you present when you make strawmen who asked ridiculous question to whom you compared op.  No, I don't play golf. Why does that pertain to anything?   And yeah, why is that a bad measure of character? Essentially you see a group of people talk about enjoying something, and you rush in out of no where and berate them. And taking a quick look at your post history, it's not the first time.   So yes, anyone who decided to attack other when unprovoked generally seems like an angry person.   And at least 7 other people agree. Or is everyone wrong but you? You acted perfectly fine and socially acceptably, and everyone's out to get you? Or maybe, just maybe, you acted like a dick and reflect upon your actions so it doesn't happen again in your life."
MitchellAndWebb,3a4xd2,Rpanich,-11,Wed Jun 17 20:40:28 2015 UTC,"Are you REALLY asking me to pinpoint the word?   A word as powerful as hate? yes.   strawmen   A strawman is a form of argument, it does't really apply in a plural sense. You're also using it incorrectly. If anything my quoted, sarcastic ""questions"" are just erroneous and inflammatory, but strawman, they are not.   No, I don't play golf. Why does that pertain to anything?   It's a Big Lebowski reference, as was the ""calmer than you are"" comment. The golf reference fit the situation.   And yeah, why is that a bad measure of character?   I want to be sure you realize that buy posing this question, I am led to assume that you think snap judgments of people is a perfectly efficient and proper way to interact with others. I will wait upon clarification before responding.   and you rush in out of no where and berate them.   Yes, I click on links on a website with literally billions of hits a day. It is quite sudden and unpredictable that you may interact with somebody on here /s  I did not berate anybody, I was inflammatory, but unless you are suggesting that we all act fake nice all the time and completely destroy and chance for real discussion, debate, or even arguments, I was not out of line.  True, I asked a few inflammatory questions and probably could have phrased them better, but I they were still honest questions. True, I ended on a bit of a sour note and that probably wasn't too nice, but to be honest, the whole thread premise kind of insults my intelligence.   People find things funny for a myriad of reasons. And all of them are going to be different, it's why such opposite people can find the same things funny. The question was not even posed as a discussion topic, it reads like a 14 year old kid asking why something is funny, after laughing at it with everybody else. OP even says they think it's amusing. My ""strawmen"" were only included to show how asinine a question OP had. Does not mean OP is an idiot, to be honest, I don't assume people are idiots and that is why I asked them the questions I did.    And taking a quick look at your post history, it's not the first time.   Ok. But what does that have to do with this?   So yes, anyone who decided to attack   Attack? What attack? That is another strong word. Why are words like that used so readily online? Victim mentality buzz words. You ever really? been attacked? Physically? In real life? I think people who have may object to that word being used to describe a smartass asking you to explain yourself online. I would not use ""attack"" in the context you are, it does not seem fair to victims of violence.   And at least 7 other people agree.   That tends to happen on a website with this many users.   Or is everyone wrong but you?   Why are you trying to put words in my mouth? Isn't that what you're calling me out for?   You acted perfectly fine and socially acceptably, and everyone's out to get you?   Again?   Or maybe, just maybe, you acted like a dick and reflect upon your actions so it doesn't happen again in your life.   You do realize this tone and phrasing not only suggests you think you're better than me (and probably most), but also like you're lecturing, again, demeaning.   I'll admit when I'm being a peniswrinkle and take my downvotes, I'm not perfect.   You are contradicting yourself perfectly, and being just as mean as I was."

You kept being a prick. I am not going to mollycoddle you after then.   I'm pointing out what you did wrong, and what you can do to improve. You're not going to listen, clearly.   So conversation over. Have fun in your angry life."

MitchellAndWebb,37qsm3,kbox,1 point,Sat May 30 03:14:31 2015 UTC,"It is pretty quickly flashed on there. The varying font doesn't help either, especially with the word charm's. I spent a while focused on charm's because in some areas it's just so damn thin that I didn't track the sentence down to swinging it. Remember that sans serif fonts are easier to read which would help if you want quick shots. also ""got to do something"" leaves a little too fast. Though it looks like you're trying to get it off the screen before he makes the face so that does make sense.   But you still are better off than the people that don't realize you need to contrast your letters (the white inside black border). And you're gif is smoooooth though I don't think that will help in your class.   Overall I feel like this scene is too quick for what you're doing. you might be better off on a shot that is focused on mark's face in which he berates jez and you have each word jump on screen as he spits them out. Somewhat like this but it's up to you. Wish you luck!"
MitchellAndWebb,37qsm3,HeadBrainiac,1 point,Sat May 30 07:04:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, making quotes from Peep Show are quite difficult because the best ones are just thoughts and you don't have a face to go along with it. I synced the words up as he was saying them, but I realize now that it wasn't necessary.    The font with ""Charm"" is one that I'll never be using again, that's for sure.    I have a long way to go in readability if I don't want to just use Impact font on the bottom (like this)"

So if they started Uni at 18 and moved in immediately afterward a couple of years after graduation (accounting for Jeremy's 1.5 years spent living with Big Suze at the 'love shack'), that would place them at 23 25 at the start of the series in 2003 and as the series progresses in real time, 32 34 at the end of series 8 in 2012.

But I sincerely hope most Brits are half as aware as Mr. Webb and vote accordingly. The Tories in the UK are analogous to the Republicans in the US. And both are only concerned with rich people and making those rich people richer. At the expense of everyone you or I has ever met. I'm not rich. Are you?  Why vote for those who only care about people who aren't you?

Edit: I looked it up, and this rhyme is correct. Those posted above and below by /u/maxwellbrot and /u/Bananinator are backwards and can get you killed.  North American coral snakes have yellow bands between every red and black band (as in the infographic), whereas kingsnakes, scarlet snakes, and other similar-looking but nonvenemous snakes have black bands between every yellow (or white) and red band (again, as in the infographic). So in North America, if red and black touch it's OK. If red and black don't touch, it's venemous.  Seriously though, this is the kind of thing you should be really careful about being correct about.

In the first case you mention it's to keep the kid occupied, in the second, well, that's self explanatory; Garfield comic books are long and thin and flexible, so you can slip them into your socks to protect your shins."
MitchellAndWebb,2z3iah,lazenbooby,5,Sun Mar 15 12:37:05 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I had never heard that phrase before so I assumed it was some regional slang for something as opposed to an actual garfield

He wrote me a (hand-written) letter back saying he couldn't make it, but that he'd love to if he could. He was the only one who responded to any of my classmate's letters.

MitchellAndWebb,2wehjr,roger_,16,Thu Feb 19 05:40:07 2015 UTC,It's nice to read an article about Webb but do they have to rub in that he is considered the lesser member so much? I love his solo stuff. His flashdance performance for comic relief was amazing.

Now Fresh Meat on the other hand is fantastic (and it's from the writers of Peep Show). Robert Webb is in a few episodes as well. Just don't get too attached to that one, as I did, they're set to film their last season (4) this year as well."
MitchellAndWebb,2umh8i,Doktor_Dysphoria,10,Wed Feb 4 03:06:49 2015 UTC,"Inbetweeners is a bit more low brow (lots of fart, shit and sex jokes), but it's also got a lot of really smart, witty bits and the awkward situations that are somewhat Peepshow-esque. If you didn't like the first two episodes, you might not like it, as it doesn't get too different. But I enjoyed it loads.   I'll have to check out Fresh Meat, as I ran through Inbetweeners in a week and a half and I need another good British comedy to watch."

When Jez married Nancy and she basically blew it off, you could tell that he was hurt. If he was a sociopath, I think he'd just be like whatever, I'll find another, and not bat an eye.  I think it's less to do with him being manipulative in terms of his dishonesty, and more to do with him being childish, haha  I may be getting psychopath and sociopath mixed up, but I wouldn't be surprised if there's a big ole debate about what each mean, how they're different, etc.  TL;DR He is a liar and unaccountable. His immaturity outweighs most of his other attributes, but no, he's not a sociopath."
MitchellAndWebb,2t3yu7,SilkRd,5,Wed Jan 28 05:30:57 2015 UTC,I think this is the best response. Also his breakdown in the emergency room when he believes Nancy cheated on him leads me to believe he's not a sociopath.

Sociopaths are incapable of experiencing guilt or shame, rarely apologize, are considered incapable of experiencing real love. Jez is shown to have feelings toward several people and shows remorse for his wilder actions every so often They're not self-reflective, whereas we've seen Jez doubt himself several times.

Who is probably being an asshole in negotiations, because they know that all they have to do is stonewall and you will take it out on Netflix, not on them."
MitchellAndWebb,2qpvm3,hobbified,52,Mon Dec 29 16:49:11 2014 UTC,"It's amazing that there are still people who believe that Netflix adds & deletes programs as they see fit. The multimedia conglomerates that own all the big shows and movies are counting on this, they'd love for people to cancel Netflix and go back to paying $100/month for cable and $12/ticket for movies, or at least move to Hulu (which, by the way, is co-owned by Disney, Comcast and Fox). Personally I'm team Netflix for life, they may just want to take my money just like the big guys but at least they want to do it by providing a quality product, rather than by swinging their ancient dicks around to try and impede changes in how people consume media."
MitchellAndWebb,2qpvm3,45adapter,3,Mon Dec 29 18:41:39 2014 UTC,"Okay, bye-bye Hulu, enough with the ancient dicks already!"
MitchellAndWebb,2qpvm3,JustSuet,8,Tue Dec 30 00:59:37 2014 UTC,"You are partly right, and partly oh so wrong. Netflix has made it their business model in recent years to pare down their catalog to essentials that drive new subscriptions -- kid's shows and movies, the most popular sitcoms and action shows, reality TV, a small handful of blockbuster movies -- while at the same time developing their own only-on-Netflix shows. They have shown less and less interest in a diverse catalog and have pared away more than half of their titles in the last two years.  Sure, the people who own the shows are being as backwards as ever, but don't think for a second that Netflix gives a solitary fuck about ""good shows"" or anything that doesn't drive their subscription numbers."
MitchellAndWebb,2qpvm3,VALIS666,3,Mon Dec 29 22:10:15 2014 UTC,"They're not trying to pare down they're catalogue at all. Content owners are constantly demanding greater sums for their shows and movies, leaving Netflix with the choice of dropping some titles or raising prices. People have generally shown that even one dollar increases will lead to many cancellations, so Netflix is left with choosing which titles to keep."
MitchellAndWebb,2qpvm3,tmlrule,17,Tue Dec 30 13:42:13 2014 UTC,"Yup, and it's getting more expensive for Netflix to do deals with distributors because of their streaming with no commercials model. Networks find it much more tantalizing to work with Hulu because they get a licensing fee, plus revenue from the streaming ads.  Peep Show is available on Hulu Plus, as is That Mitchell and Webb Look, but you have to suffer through Hulu's atrocious commercials AND pay the subscription fee."
MitchellAndWebb,2qpvm3,timesuck,11,Mon Dec 29 17:21:08 2014 UTC,"Peep Show is available on Hulu Plus, as is That Mitchell and Webb Look,   I will watch CLIPS of those shows on youtube before I go over to Hulu.

MitchellAndWebb,2qpvm3,Evertonian3,3,Mon Dec 29 17:52:17 2014 UTC,Didn't know this. Could be part of problem - Hulu has been going after a lot of netflix's popular titles.  Are there commercials?

MitchellAndWebb,2qpvm3,ablebodiedmango,3,Mon Dec 29 18:44:20 2014 UTC,but they aren't excessive   Unfortunately on Reddit this is not a popular opinion but I agree with you completely. For under $10 a month I get next day access to current TV shows versus waiting a year for a full season on Netflix. Is it the ideal situation? Nope. Is it tolerable and still costs me far less than cable? Yup.

MitchellAndWebb,2qpvm3,setmehigh,1 point,Mon Dec 29 23:58:44 2014 UTC,A shame that the BBC won't let us just pay the license fee outside of the country and get access to their content. Is it even a requirement within the UK in order to view it online?
MitchellAndWebb,2qpvm3,Funkymunks,3,Mon Dec 29 18:55:23 2014 UTC,"When I lived in England I had full access rights to BBC stuff online before I got around to setting up my utilities.  BBC is funded primarily by the TV tax, which is a pretty high tax that any household capable of receiving live broadcasts must pay.    I was told that, even though I didn't have a TV for a lot of the time I spent there, that I still needed to pay because I could watch the broadcasts on my computer.  If I remember right the tax was somewhere around $200/year."
MitchellAndWebb,2qpvm3,JustSuet,3,Mon Dec 29 19:20:29 2014 UTC,"That isn't ""high"".  They provide news websites, public events, multitude of TV stations and radio stations, podcasts, kids video games all without adverts and usually with some decent quality."
MitchellAndWebb,2qpvm3,arcturum,2,Mon Dec 29 20:41:03 2014 UTC,"Well, I can agree with you that the tax is a good thing and the BBC definitely gets its money's worth.  Whether are not the tax is high or not is really a matter of perspective.    I assumed the question was asked from an average American point of view, because that seems about right for reddit.  Assuming a 12% tax rate and average household income in America of $60,000 we get $7200 in taxes yearly.  $200 is around 2.7% of that.  A fairly significant number.  The percentage would be even higher for those underneath the average tax rate and income levels because the tax is a static number regardless of income levels, as far as I'm aware.  Although if wikipedia is to be believed you only have to pay half if you are legally blind."
MitchellAndWebb,2qpvm3,Bagelsy,1 point,Mon Dec 29 20:59:56 2014 UTC,"Woah, hang on, Americans pay 12% tax? Is that both federal and state (do both take taxes??!)? I'd love to see a comparison, especially if things like health insurance are taken into account."
MitchellAndWebb,2qpvm3,Bagelsy,1 point,Mon Jan 12 19:23:08 2015 UTC,Irrelevant if you're no longer in the UK but you only need a TV licence if you watch or record TV as its broadcast. So if you're watching Netflix or catching up on the iPlayer you won't need one.

MitchellAndWebb,2qpvm3,Green_Guitar,3,Mon Dec 29 22:19:02 2014 UTC,Last year they got a lot of negative feedback after they pulled it and they put it back a month later. Hoping this happens again.

MitchellAndWebb,2qpvm3,MixLync,3,Tue Dec 30 01:09:24 2014 UTC,That truly sucks but hopefully they will re-add it when the new season comes out. I remember Always Sunny got pulled from netflix for a while due to an expired licensing agreement and then was re-added later on with the new season. I feel like Peep Show actually may have gone off for a while too prior to season 9 but don't quite recall. Either way- it should be back hopefully after the new season.

MitchellAndWebb,2pol4r,mike_pants,4,Thu Dec 18 13:53:55 2014 UTC,"My favorite line is season one when mark breaks a swear on his mothers life. He goes ""what's that even mean? What are you going to do kill her?"""
MitchellAndWebb,2pol4r,Bagelsy,-4,Mon Dec 29 20:30:02 2014 UTC,"It's actually one of my least favourite moments, since it was when I realised the humour was getting more and more repetitive and the show was in decline.   This joke fits the general formula ""jez uses common saying, mark takes it literally and gets annoyed"" (see also season 8: Jez - ""If you love something, set it free."" Mark - ""Oh really? And what if I love a black mamba? Should I set that free?), which I find quite a lazy way to use the characters, and is frankly not that funny any more.   Having said that, the new years eve episode and the first episode of season 8 are two of the absolute funniest of the whole series, so they're still coming up with great stuff, but I definitely think the overall quality has dipped compared to earlier seasons."
MitchellAndWebb,2pol4r,Aquapig,24,Thu Dec 18 15:28:00 2014 UTC,"I look at the scene a bit differently. To me it is Mark taking a common saying that Jez uses and turns it around to humiliate him. It speaks to marks stubbornness that feelings of superiority that have been a hallmark of the character since the beginning. His attempt to humiliate him by doing this also reveal something that we, the audience have been aware of from the beginning, that behind that smugness is really just a insecure man."
MitchellAndWebb,2pol4r,Aquapig,1 point,Thu Dec 18 15:44:38 2014 UTC,"I disagree. While Mark definitely does enjoy exercising his superiority over Jez, that's usually shown in different ways; when he is put in charge of Jez's inheritance in season 5, or when he buys Jez an indian out of spite in season 8 come to mind (i.e. when he is in a position of actual control or moral superiority). Both of them know that Mark is cleverer, and I doubt he would feel much satisfaction from proving that to Jez. I think it's more just the writers playing on Mark's general irritation with mainstream culture, pretty clumsily in this case. Like I said, I don't really find that funny anymore since they've done that kind of joke better countless times before."
MitchellAndWebb,2pol4r,Aquapig,2,Thu Dec 18 16:00:10 2014 UTC,"when he buys Jez an indian out of spite in season 8   Did I miss that episode?   I feel like its amusing because it is taking a rather absurd statement and treating it absurdly.   Also, it serves as a call back to jez's obsession with butt stuff."
MitchellAndWebb,2pol4r,DipThatChip,4,Thu Dec 18 16:12:05 2014 UTC,"Maybe; it's one of the funniest moments of season 8 (episode 1 I think it was?). Mark pays for Jez to see a therapist, but sees him in an Indian restaurant when he should be at his appointment. Mark then gets really excited and proceeds to buy them both a huge Indian meal ""as a treat"" to force Jez to admit he didn't go to the session since he's already too full to eat any of the food."
MitchellAndWebb,2pol4r,Aquapig,3,Thu Dec 18 16:21:42 2014 UTC,OH YES! That was amazing.
MitchellAndWebb,2pol4r,Aquapig,8,Thu Dec 18 16:41:58 2014 UTC,still funnier than anything else on television/streaming sites
MitchellAndWebb,2pol4r,insuman,11,Thu Dec 18 15:38:30 2014 UTC,"Happily disagree. He's not ""taking it literally."" He's using his intellect to dismantle Jez's personal attacks since he has no social or conversational acumen other than petty belittlement. Season 7 has my favorite episodes, hands down. You say repetitive, I say it hit its stride."

MitchellAndWebb,2pcr0p,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Dec 15 21:47:13 2014 UTC,"Moors:       The Moors were the medieval Muslim inhabitants of the Maghreb, Iberian Peninsula, Sicily and Malta.  The Moors invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 711 and called the territory Al-Andalus, an area which at its peak included what is today Gibraltar, most of Spain and Portugal, and parts of Southern France. There was also a Moorish presence in what is now Southern Italy, primarily in Sicily. They occupied Mazara on Sicily in 827  and in 1224 were expelled to the settlement of Lucera, which was destroyed in 1300. The religious difference of the Moorish Muslims led to a centuries-long conflict with the Christian kingdoms of Europe, called in Spain the Reconquista. The fall of Granada in 1492 saw the end of Muslim rule in Iberia.  The term ""Moors"" has also been used in Europe in a broader sense to refer to Muslims,  especially those of Arab or Berber descent, whether living in Spain or North Africa.  During the colonial era the Portuguese introduced the names ""Ceylon Moors"" and ""Indian Moors"", in Sri Lanka. The Bengali Muslims were called Moors.  Moors are not a distinct or self-defined people.  Medieval and early modern Europeans applied the name to Arabs, Berbers, Muslim Europeans and Sub-Saharan Africans.
