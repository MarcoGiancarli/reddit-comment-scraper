DnD,3e213p,Rhino887,19,Tue Jul 21 10:16:21 2015 UTC,"My trident-wielding dragonborn fighter had recently convinced a group of orcs we were fighting that he was a God of the river, having leapt up out of the water to dragonsbreath their leader while rolling a crazy intimidate check to strike fear into our opponents. Shortly after, their leader (who had survived) had frozen the surface of the water while I had briefly gone to the shore, leaving me potentially stranded from the ""source of my power"". As the orcs began to grown more confident that I had been ""weakened"", I heroically leap into the air, attempting to smash through the ice on the way down with a majestic trident spike. I failed the strength check and only succeeded in looking rather pathetic. My illusion of grandeur being broken, I charge at the leader, who was still suspended on a log bridging the river, but slipped and fell on the ice and careened into the log, flipping unceremoniously over the other side into the water. I was then struck by an arrow or something and fell unconscious, floating down the river to be rescued by the only other party member who survived the encounter.  It all started so well but my ego got the better of me and I was punished accordingly by the dice."

The encounter was also supposed to be a quick and easy thing where we realize we're outnumbered and quickly run away. Of course this doesn't happen and it takes up most of the session. Tons of fun though, and the guys who had to roll new characters made some good ones. We lost our hilariously crazy halfling bard though, as he ran into the forest with 1hp to escape more orcs, dodging many obstacles but eventually being knocked unconscious by a thorny bush and left at the mercy (or lack thereof) of his pursuers."

A young (like, Tiny-sized) dragon whelp was captured by kobolds and in the previous session we set him free, he killed the leader and became the king of the kobold tribe.  He proceeded to become a twat, killed and injured a couple kobolds, and when they attempted to prevent him from killing their injured and sick, he proceeded to start killing them again.  So... my character had enough. Athletics check. Double crit with Advantage. Grabbed him by his wings, slammed him into a wall and walked into a different room and closed the door behind him. Threw him in a corner, gets right in his face and starts shouting. Crit on intimidation.  Rants about how things shouldn't have to fear you to respect you, finally calms down and holds his hand out to the dragon in an offer of peace.  Have completely and utterly given this dragon PTSD. It doesn't even notice I'm there anymore.  Drop a few gold coins in front of it. ""A start on your horde."" And it snaps out of it. ""So you're going to treat the kobolds well, right?""  No response.  ""Right?"" Nat 20 on intimidation, again.  He nods furiously. ""Alright. I'll be checking up on you.""  And then he leaves.  Feeling like a total badass, we leave and go find some goblins that were terrorizing the kobolds. Proceed to crit fail EVERY roll in combat, including his attempts to intimidate the goblins. Obviously he strained his vocal cords too much and his voice cracked."

Completely missing, the barbarian plummets face first into the ground after a 100ft drop ready to accept death after such a miserable failure only to have the wizard swoop in at the last second to cast feather fall, saving the now suicidal barbarian while the manticore creates a very large crater nearby."

The final battle before Sam was being promoted to hero was a battle between two ships, the heroes are swinging and jumping back and forth between the ships fighting off baddies and henchmen were dying left and right (poor management of resources).   When one of the heroes needed help it was Sam's time to shine, he grabs the rigging and tries to swing to the other boat.   A 1 is rolled.   He slams into the side of the other ship and falls into the water. With the ship he just jumped off bearing down on him he needs to roll a moderate athletics check to swim and grab the ropes hanging off the side of the ship.   Another 1 is rolled.  Sam is sucked under the boat and forced underwater, he needs to make a saving throw to survive.  Another 1 is rolled.  Sam was never seen again...

DnD,3e213p,KatherineDuskfire,5,Tue Jul 21 14:04:48 2015 UTC,"Let me tell you about our level 1 party's (though we also have a level 4 fighter with us) attempt to fight off a  blue dragon. Minor HotDQ spoilers incoming.  For reference, we have a wood elf ranger, rock gnome sorceror, aasimar druid, half orc monk, an eldritch knight, and a tiefling bard (that's me!) in our party. We are demonstrably squishy at the moment.  The town is under siege. An NPC hands us a bottle of oil, telling us to attach it to an arrow and shoot the dragon with it when in range. Naturally it falls on the ranger to make the shot.  The rest of us devise a plan to get the dragon within range. The bard and the eldritch knight confer and translate an insult into draconic.   The bard prepares the insult, then offers a word of encouragement to the ranger (bardic inspiration). Casts Thaumaturgy on himself so his voice booms three times the volume, and shouts at the dragon in clumsy draconic: ""Inept flying lizard! I've met brass dragons with bigger balls than you!"" (Vicious mockery is fun).  The sorceror quickly conjures a minor illusion of a baby brass dragon that floats about 30 feet up from the tower we're on.  The blue dragon is livid. He roars and comes right up to us, the beat of his wings keeping him aloft even as it sends three of us, the druid, bard and sorceror, tumbling to the ground.. ""Who said that!"" Naturally, my bard doesn't pipe up. With a lackadaisical breath attack the dragon dispels the minor illusion.  Then the ranger takes the shot. Now, I'm normally a proponent of free will and choice, but this arrow was destined for failure even with advantage and bardic inspiration (first a five, then a one). The thing goes sailing into the night, probably blowing up someone's house. The dragon sneers, ""what a waste"".  You know, that's the closest we've had to a decent plan, and the final piece just didn't connect. That could have been an epic moment, but alas. Instead the eldritch knight and sorceror spammed him with firebolt while the ranger just took another shot at his wing and sent him limping off. It'll do.  Tl;dr: decent plan to take down a dragon is ruined by the linchpin's terrible rolls."
DnD,3e213p,Dynethor,5,Tue Jul 21 14:17:28 2015 UTC,"I don't have any stories about this because I'm always the DM, but I hate it when this happens to my players.   Hours or even sessions of buildup has lead to this moment. Even the circumstances align. This is your character's time to shine! Even the improv speech was awesome! You roll your dice and... a 1. All that build up and all that excitement wasted on a single die roll.   This is why I often forgo dice during this high-tension moments. When the dice should be rolled, I often prefer to roll the dice before the player says ""Okay, so this is what I do..."" This is also the reason why I'm looking forward to Phoenix Dawn Command.

I managed to kill the dragon while grappled (it was mostly dead anyway). I make the dex check to get out of its talons, make the acrobatics check to get onto its head as it's falling, and then whiff the acrobatics check to jump off right before it hits the ground.

DnD,3e213p,AggressivePoliteGuy,2,Tue Jul 21 15:28:34 2015 UTC,"Here is one from the DMs point of view.    It was the final battle of the campaign and as the DM, I had made it a tough one.  The monsters were high level and even the terrain was out to kill them. However the party was on a holy mission so I had these boons in place they could pick from each round.  Basically think of them as special divine help and worked much like instants or enchantments in Magic: The Gathering.  It was going to be the party's lifesaver and also raise the epic feel of the battle.  I just needed the cleric to pray for diving guidance at some point prior to the battle.  And near the end of a skills challenge prior to the battle, he did exactly that, ""I pray for diving guidance.""  Whew! - all he needed to do was not critically miss.  We were playing 5e so I gave him ""advantage"" and told him to roll 2d20 and take the highest.  He rolled a '1' on both die. - we all just stared at it. The cleric just signed and said, ""I guess Erathis wouldn't have much of a presence in the plane of chaos.""  They were about to fail the skills challenge too and the bard was up next.  ""I want to sing an uplifting hymn to help the cleric connect to his divine power."" - Whew, I was saved, I told myself, all he needed to do was not fail and I would be justified in giving the cleric another go at his divine connection.  The bard rolled a '1' - which almost broke the DM.  The player starts singing his hymn which started off with something like, ""Our gods have said goodbye/they have left us to die...""  They failed the skill challenge but the worst part was I HAD to either get the divine boon cards into play for the combat or scale back the monsters.  Now with the failures, either was going to take away from the epic-ness of the final encounter.  I should have told the cleric he automatically succeeded because it was so important but I choose to let the randomness in and paid for it."

Anyway, we were traversing across a plateau when we come to a large canyon spanned by a stone bridge, on the other side was a very pissed off looking gorgon. It started charging us.  I got a little cocky and my half orc pushed the party back, then walked forward onto the bridge and prepared to grapple and stop the gorgon, ready to throw it off the side. I just barely missed the strength check, so he took hold, slid a few feet, halting the gorgon, and then was tossed to the side.  Then I failed the check to grab onto the side, plummeting down the canyon. Luckily someone threw down some rope and my very forgiving dm let me make a check to see if I could grab it and halt my fall, and I did, but my half-orc had a very bruised ego after that.

Kobolds were bountiful, but I had been hearing rumors of this adult green dragon running about.  Eventually, my party and I tracked down the beast to an orc encampment.  After the barbarian thoroughly trashed the camp and made an example of what happens to those that side with evil dragons, the ranger spotted it.  Out on the horizon, green scales were spotted glinting in the summer twilight. After being alerted, we all made a dash to our respective spots to begin combat.  The ranger climbed a tree for good shooting angles, the barbarian topped a crate, ready to swing an axe at the beasts underbelly, and I dashed towards a nearby tower.  I was about to do something very brave, and very stupid.  Climaxing the tower in a few rounds, I saw the dragon approach.  I dashed to the edge, ready to leap and impale the beasts skull with my longsword of dragon's bane.  Then I rolled a 2 on my jump check, tumbling into the rushing river below.  My party helped my full-plate wearing ass up out of the water, as the dragon laughed at us and began to fly away.  Recovering from my fall and near drowining, I watched helplessly as the ranger's well placed shots brought the beast down and the barbarian's heart-seeking blow felled the beast, dropping it into the river that quickly took the monster away before I could defile the corpse and make my blessing to Bahamut.

DnD,3dzc8h,SupremeSarah,9,Mon Jul 20 22:24:59 2015 UTC,"Well, you could do the usual with first seeing that the goblins are crude, twisted things that are better off for the slavery, then as they delve deeper, find that that's mostly wrong and they are being treated worse than scum, perhaps have them interact with a few goblins that are helpful, get them friendly with some, then seeing that they are treated horribly.  Or, you could have it that the goblins are slaves in secret. Perhaps there are a few powerful people in the city that have some means of controlling them (a private army that holds their families hostage for example, or a magic artifact, or perhaps they have convinced the goblins that they are their gods) and everyone thinks that the goblins are wild, but are actually being manipulated against their wills by a few villains.  Then of course, you could have all this, then when you finally free the goblin slaves, it turns out that they were in fact horrible little creatures and must be put down for the pest they are. Up to you.   I always like to mess with the preconceptions of the players. Goblins are evil creatures that you kill levels 1-5, make them the victim. If the party has accepted that they are the victim, perhaps make them villainous in the end after all. Don't just spring on the party ""Thank you for freeing us! We will now eat all the babies in the city."" Have them show a deep seated anger, or resentment at their captors, or even humanity in general, but be grateful to the party. Perhaps have factions within the goblin groups. Up to you."
DnD,3dzc8h,SupremeSarah,5,Tue Jul 21 00:50:24 2015 UTC,Oh you're brilliant XD thank you! This has given me a few ideas!
DnD,3dzc8h,chubachu,3,Tue Jul 21 00:53:29 2015 UTC,Goblins are actually temple virgins who have been cursed by a jealous god to look like goblins. The goblins attempt to convince the players they are indeed sexy ladies. You'll need some kind of witcher to lift the curse.
DnD,3dzc8h,SupremeSarah,2,Tue Jul 21 14:59:52 2015 UTC,Pahahah omg thats funny! Definitely a twist like that is going somewhere!
DnD,3dzc8h,Masri788,4,Tue Jul 21 15:56:36 2015 UTC,"""Oh brave, handsome adventurers, do not look upon our hideous bodies now, for were were cursed into this unsightly form.

DnD,3dzc8h,Nethnarei,20,Tue Jul 21 16:10:04 2015 UTC,"My own twist:  A necromancer is mining a mountain for magical crystals to enhance her power. The resulting dust and magic residue in the air has cursed an entire town with various kinds of lycanthropy. They beg you to stop the necromancer and find a cure for the town.  Twist: The residue was causing confusion not transformation, the town was always a lycanthropic tribe that forgot they were lycanthropes."
DnD,3dzc8h,Masri788,2,Tue Jul 21 09:05:13 2015 UTC,"Sir, why don't you have more upvotes?"
DnD,3dzc8h,lonelyxsky,2,Tue Jul 21 14:49:29 2015 UTC,"hahaha thank you. To be honest one of the most important parts of the plot twist device is alluding to it.  For example for the one above, the village is located in an isolated region by the dark woods that are known for terrible beasts. There is only one road that goes near the village and other villages consider the people from them to be aloof, private and just plain weird. The village itself has Native American/Shaman like religion and culture with totem poles  etc. The necromancer herself will be confused when you accuse her of trying to make a werebeast army. And trying to consume the residue knocks you out and leaves you with temporary amnesia.  A well excecuted twist can be a lot of fun :D"
DnD,3dzc8h,mcj0rdalini,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:38 2015 UTC,"I like this. I like this one. Let's give it variations up the whazzoo.  Let's start with the motives for the necromancer (or wizard)  What if the goal of the mage isn't the collecting of the crystals, but the cursing of the town. Perhaps they slighted him, and he wants them to suffer, perhaps they have done some grave wrong, and this is his punishment, perhaps the curse only affects those that have some sort of sin, and it is manifesting as lycanthropy. Perhaps the crystals are not being gathered for selfish reason, but is for some greater good? Perhaps the town hired the wizard to collect the crystals, but they were cursed as a result and the wizard doesn't know?   Now lets mess with the town.  Perhaps they were all lycanthropes to begin with as you said, but are saying they are cursed. The magic residue is harmless, but with the mage out of the way, they can collect the crystals themselves. Perhaps they are not actually lycanthropes but are all having mass hallucinations. Perhaps that was the wizard's goal, a nasty prank on the town, but ultimately harmless. Perhaps the town is turning into lycanthropes, but it's not the magic residue, but an actual gang of lycanthropes have moved in and are turning people using the magic as a cover. Perhaps they were always lycanthropes, and the wizard was actually a guardian, keeping them locked away, and they are tricking the party into killing their jailer?  Just a few ideas. Have fun!"

For most of these, I just thought of what would be an interesting change to a regular story idea. Princess guarded by a dragon, what of the dragon was the good guy, the princess evil. What if the princess was working with the dragon. What if they were both good/evil. What if there was no princess, no dragon. What if someone in the royal family was in on the princess being kidnapped. What if it was all a ploy to round up pesky adventurers and get them all killed?   The possibilities are almost endless."

DnD,3e25b1,trollburgers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:19:53 2015 UTC,"If you live in Ontario, Canada, the $100 pledge will cost you close to another $40 in shipping.  Just something to keep in mind.  EDIT: I live in Toronto. With the exchange rate and shipping, the $100 pledge would (at this moment) cost me $177.80 CAD.  As they add more to the Core Set, shipping costs may increase.  As the exchange rate fluctuates, the end price will obviously change."
DnD,3e25b1,EmperorGruumm,2,Tue Jul 21 13:57:50 2015 UTC,Plus the exchange rate isn't too favorable right now... It's still worth it though! Plus if more people get into it that number can continue to go up. I suspect it may be about 150 miniatures for $100 when it's all over.

DnD,3e25b1,dabneyb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:45 2015 UTC,"Well it wouldn't ship right away. The Kickstarter is so that they can make the molds to create the minis.

DnD,3e199t,Folsomdsf,3,Tue Jul 21 13:17:03 2015 UTC,"The errata essentially makes the grappler feat useless. You get all of the benefits by simply maintaining your grapple and knocking him prone. In fact, it is actually better to knock the target prone than to pin him, because pinning restrains YOU as well, while grappling a prone target doesn't have any disadvantages."

DnD,3e199t,Folsomdsf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:07:42 2015 UTC,"It's not really worth the feat though. Pinning stops you from the best part of grappling, which is grabbing those poor jabronis and running around beating the crap out of them and tossing them from the top rope off a cliff. As for advantage, you'll want to be shoving them prone anyways (which I think you can do easily with the tavern brawler feat instead I think) where they can't get up because 0 move speed, and you get advantage anyways. It sort of sucks that you don't take grappler as a grappler, but if you read that guide that's being posted around and linked in OP it explains why it's not a great idea."

As for race, if OP's DM allows Unearthed Arcana posts, he should look at the Goliath race.

You'd lose proficiency in str saving throws, but gain them in dex  This would have the added effect of making you better at grappling, which is thematically appropriate, and would negate the need for the tavern brawler feat (in favor of the grappler feat, which allows you to pin enemies and get free attacks on grappled opponents)"
DnD,3e199t,sstripwire,3,Tue Jul 21 06:10:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah he's been pretty lenient with the rules as long as we can make a good case for it role-play wise. I don't want to be too difficult as a player, but this seems like a fairly reasonable substitution."
DnD,3e199t,winkingchef,4,Tue Jul 21 06:16:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know that it's really necessary. As far as wrestlers go, savage was more of a high-flying technical grappler than a strength-based brawler. (Though, obviously way stronger than an average joe.) There might be something to subbing the dexterity skills for charisma, though, since that's what really put Macho over, and what pro wrestling is all about.   Sub out some special attack for the elbow drop, though. It wouldn't be the Macho Man without that flying elbow."

DnD,3e199t,sstripwire,2,Tue Jul 21 13:45:33 2015 UTC,Colorful leather armor with some sleeve tassles complimented by by a cowboy hat would be much more thematically accurate.
DnD,3e199t,RvBblues,4,Tue Jul 21 06:11:18 2015 UTC,"http://community.wizards.com/forum/player-help/threads/4142801  Apply said guide. It's the best grappler's guide in my opinion and is incredibly bad ass. It may not be what you're going for thematically, but it will show you several ways to build a mechanically kick-ass grappler without bending the rules. Thanks to ktkenshinx for making it!"
DnD,3e199t,TOHCskin,2,Tue Jul 21 06:16:11 2015 UTC,Oh hell yeah! That's actually what inspired me to make this character. I linked it in my OP. Definitely a well put together guide. Thanks ktkenshinx!
DnD,3e199t,Xylemicarious,11,Tue Jul 21 06:18:52 2015 UTC,"As an unarmored barbarian who recently started grappling, I fully support this endeavor!  Apart from disadvantage though, and maybe some general badassery, I havent quite found a real perk to grappling. The only times it has really shined has been against big heavy hitting baddies tearing up my team. I usually rage/frenzy and grapple to impose disadvantage and make him focus on me.  Apart from that though, my particular character cant really do damage while locked. His weapon is a two hander, so even if I grappled one handed as the PHB suggests, I couldnt swing my axe!  Its because of this I have resorted to pulling body parts off, fish hooking, and eye gouging. Even flayed the flesh from an abominations arm once, I did. A fine day that was!"
DnD,3e199t,Xylemicarious,4,Tue Jul 21 05:11:28 2015 UTC,Oh yeeah! The thought of pulling an arm off a guy and bludgeoning his friends with it seems appealing.
DnD,3e199t,Pan0ptimist,5,Tue Jul 21 05:16:15 2015 UTC,Thats usually the goal. Still hurts seeing my axe go to waste though. I've also been throwing it at things before going at them hand to hand :) still ways to have fun!
DnD,3e199t,Tehtacticalpanda,4,Tue Jul 21 05:18:06 2015 UTC,Yeah the grappling guide I linked mentioned using the Shove attack action to knock an enemy prone while still maintaining a grapple. Meaning as long as your grapple holds they can't get up since that requires movement. Seems like a pretty powerful crowd control technique. Especially if you have something like a Rogue in your group.
DnD,3e199t,Ubongo,4,Tue Jul 21 05:22:21 2015 UTC,"Wow, I never thought of that. So far I have only shoved one enemy... onto a pile of 12 battleaxes I had previously leaned against a wall. :>  I shall investigate your guide and USE IT THIS WEEKEND!"
DnD,3e199t,MetathranSoldier,4,Tue Jul 21 05:27:28 2015 UTC,"Human Variant + Shield Master Feat + Barbarian is what you are looking for.  Shove, then grapple-pin."
DnD,3e199t,Hyatice,2,Tue Jul 21 05:35:52 2015 UTC,"What about a strength Bard with grappler feat and and college of valor. You have access to some useful spells, double the proficiency bonus on athletics and I believe you get advantage even with creatures a size larger.  Shield mastery only allows you a bonus shove after your standard attack right?"
DnD,3e199t,brainpower4,2,Tue Jul 21 11:32:30 2015 UTC,Shield mastery only kicks in when you are wielding a shield (obviously). The shield takes away one open hand (which is the only damage source) and is pretty weak thematically. I don't think a Macho Man is running around without a weapon but with a shield.
DnD,3e199t,SleepingSheeperson,2,Tue Jul 21 12:18:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah the guy that did the guide is pretty thorough and very enthusiastic about grapplers. Gotta love the environmental attack options with abilities like that.

DnD,3e26h8,TheRedCometCometh,14,Tue Jul 21 11:28:32 2015 UTC,"The most obvious difference is that 5e combat is fast. If your players share your feelings about the technical nature of 4e, they may not like the combat. On the other hand, if you often find your combat sessions dragging, with players getting bored, you'll love it.  5e's ethos is to have equal weighting on exploration, social interaction and combat - there's much more in the way of rules regarding the role-playing aspects of the game. Personally, I liked the fact that 4e left a lot of this open to the DM, but again it's all personal preference. Have a flick through the 5e PHB and see what you think."
DnD,3e26h8,YorsWorld,3,Tue Jul 21 11:57:33 2015 UTC,"5E combat slows down heavily as you gain levels.    I've played two characters up to level 10 and am currently GM'ing a party that has gone from level 1 to currently 9.  Warriors have twice as many attacks starting at level 5, Battlemasters have maneuvers to pick from, spellcasters have 10+ spells they can cast at a given time, Monks are debating whether to spend their ki to stun or Flurry, etc.  More decisions, more rolls, slower turns.  Tier 1 play of 5th Edition is extremely fast but once you hit Tier 2 all those speed differences go the way of the Dodo."
DnD,3e26h8,Unsight,7,Tue Jul 21 17:50:12 2015 UTC,"My last campaign was 4E until around level 11, when 5E came out, and we switched.  I like running 5E better. While it lacks the incredible balance and ease of building encounters at just the right level of challenge that 4E had, it feels easier to make things up on the fly. My players are a mixed group of veterans that have played since 2nd edition to noobs where 4E or 5E were their first crack at D&D. The older ones were a little more attached to 4E, mostly because they enjoyed the technical, tactical gameplay there, which 5E just doesn't have in the same way.  That said, everyone has adjusted at this point, and we just started a new campaign. Everyone seems to be satisfied with the system after almost a year with it, and I feel like we end up with a lot more time outside combat to do things, which is important for a game we can only run for 5 or so hours every month."
DnD,3e26h8,VincentGrayson,9,Tue Jul 21 13:35:28 2015 UTC,"5E is like 3E with less content and less chaos.  I liked 4th better, but I've enjoyed two 5E campaigns too.    Pros: Faster combat.  Theoretically simpler character building.  A ""feel"" that classics lovers will appreciate. Cons: Combat is less strategic.  The character building in my experience hasn't in fact been faster.  Not a lot of content yet (feats especially feel lacking)."
DnD,3e26h8,HeyDude378,2,Tue Jul 21 12:52:32 2015 UTC,I think character building is only supposed to be faster if you use the basic options.
DnD,3e26h8,bigmcstrongmuscle,4,Tue Jul 21 17:29:52 2015 UTC,"Is roleplaying what you like about D&D? Then play whatever; it doesn't matter. The new character background mechanics in 5e are really cool and worth looking into, but honestly you could just steal the cool parts and use them in whatever you play now. Is tactical-level combat what you like about D&D? Play 4e. The combat system is more granular and detailed, leading to longer, more interesting combats. Combat is the main game layer and it's designed to be fun on its own, with lots of interesting options every round. However because of that, even simple fights take a fairly long time, which tends to crowd out non-combat material and turns random encounters into long and tedious drains on table time. You'll probably not want to use them. The system is extremely well balanced and very tightly designed, but the similar classes and strict adherence to the system math can feel overly gamey and dull for those who prefer something looser and less standardized. And the AEDU system eliminates most of the per-day and per-adventure resource mechanics that make exploration an interesting layer of game. Is strategic-level adventuring what you like about D&D? Play 5e. Combats are streamlined, short and sweet. Less the main layer of the game, more one minigame among several. In 5e you can have bigger groups, encounters that last less than ten minutes, and random encounter systems that actually don't take over the entire session. You will often have rounds where all you do is move and make your basic attack; but those rounds go by very very quickly, so it's not agonizing like it would be in 4e. There's less tactics on the round-by-round level, but more logistics and long-term resources to juggle over long adventures. Of course, because of that, you have to put in a bit more effort on those occasions where you WANT a combat to be an epic three-hour showdown. The character balance is less tightly controlled... but that does allow for a wider variety of content. The system is breezier and more freewheeling, with more open subsystems built into it... but that also means it's much easier to break."
DnD,3e26h8,bigmcstrongmuscle,5,Tue Jul 21 15:40:34 2015 UTC,"Pros: each class feels more like its own entity. Their powers don't all have the same effects. Faster rules, less modifiers, etc. It's streamlined.   Cons: i really miss the Push effect in combat."
DnD,3e26h8,ZE_LUMIS,3,Tue Jul 21 12:49:39 2015 UTC,Cons: i really miss the Push effect in combat.   Pick up the Charger feat. ;-)
DnD,3e26h8,BadKarma7,2,Tue Jul 21 17:15:01 2015 UTC,I don't really know much about 4e.  What's the difference in pushing there?
DnD,3e26h8,Zefirus,4,Tue Jul 21 14:44:22 2015 UTC,"4e had a lot of powers that pushed, pulled or slid enemies. This maent that positioning was both important (hence the mandatoryu maps) but alos tactically relevant. Where you were was a big deal, asd opposed to other versions of DnD where the only important thing was who you're next to.  It made 4e combat more tactically deep, more dynamic (especially compared to 3x) and more interesting - and slower and you really did need map and tokens and stuff."
DnD,3e26h8,jmartkdr,2,Tue Jul 21 15:12:36 2015 UTC,"In 4e, there are a bunch of powers and spells that result in pushing your target(s) some distance after you hit. It was a fun mechanic and made for some strategic battle planning here and there."
DnD,3e26h8,ZE_LUMIS,3,Tue Jul 21 14:58:29 2015 UTC,"Outside of combat, 5e is better. The training bonus scales, but is still significant at all levels, there's no extraneous math (everything is simple with rarely more than two numbers to add up); backgrounds allow for some serious character variety without adding complexity; every class gets decent noncombat features; the ability check system makes handling odd actions very easy; you can refluff the existing classes to nearly any possible concept; advantage/disadvantage makes circumstantial modifiers easy to work in while leaving them significant without ever being game-breaking.  I'm playing both, and one of my only complaints about 5e is that combat is dull. Almost every class is using the same basic attack almost every round, every combat, all bloody day.  And it doesn't change as you gain levels, either. A champion fighter who picks greatsword will use their action to ""attack with my greatsword"" 90% of the time from 1st level all the way through 20th, because they will never have a better option available. Even a battlemaster or EK will use ""I attack with my greatsword"" 60% of the time, because they only get a few (like, 6) daily powers, and the game only works if you have 6-8 encounters per day. So a battlemaster is using about one maneuver per fight. The rest is going to be basic attacks.  This is true for sorcerers as well, except they might be able to get away with two spells per encounter. In fact, I have yet to see a class that isn't about spamming the same damn attack over and over.  So you need to ask your group: are we enjoying the combat in 4e? If the answer is yes, don't switch to 5e. Look at 13th Age, which is designed by Rob Heinsoo, the lead designer for 4e. It adds a lot of nifty excitement-enhancing aspects to the rules, and cuts out a lot of fat. You can probably homebrew any classes not present fairly quickly once you get a feel for the new setup."
DnD,3e26h8,jmartkdr,2,Tue Jul 21 15:09:55 2015 UTC,Ranger attacking with a magical longbow with which you're proficient: d20 + STRENGTH_MOD + PROFICIENCY_BONUS + ENHANCEMENT_BONUS + ARCHERY_STYLE_BONUS.    It's not a knock on 5th edition specifically... it happens in every edition.  I wish VTT was mo better.
DnD,3e26h8,HeyDude378,2,Tue Jul 21 17:59:50 2015 UTC,"That's a fairly specific example, as opposed to 4e's normal 1d20 + ability mod + half level + proficiency + enhancement + item bonus + feat bonus + power bonus. Your damage would then be X * (weapon dice) + ability mod + enhancement + different feat bonus + different item bonus + different power bonus; + extra effect of the power.  And this would still be easier than 3e/PF in most cases because only the power bonus changes from attack to attack. Heck, ThAC0 worked well enough because there were no circumstantial modifiers - so you could make a little chart that gave you ""what AC you hit"" directly from the roll and not change it until you leveled up.  Personally I found 3e the worst, because there were so many different kinds of bonuses to keep track of and spellcasters tended to add several each battle, but what one person considers hard is not something everyone has trouble with. A game designed just for me would be a hybrid of 4e and 5e (with some stuff borrowed from several other systems) but I'm just one player."
DnD,3e26h8,jmartkdr,3,Tue Jul 21 18:09:02 2015 UTC,"Combat is faster and easier to keep track of, but there's far less tactical depth to it. If you're a fan of 4e's tactical combat and monster design, 5e's a bit of a letdown in that regard. On the DM side, encounter building has been kicked in the teeth with vaguer guidelines and some misleading or missing information.  Out-of-combat play has a great deal more support and options, with more rules and guidelines for exploration, downtime, and interaction.  Character creation is smoother, roleplay/backstory are integrated far better, and classes and subclasses feel more distinctive, with a huge variety of archetypes available - the 12 classes almost function as 30ish classes.   You might want to skip character levels 1 and 2 if you have a specific concept in mind, because you don't get your specialization right away. Want to play an eldritch knight or a beastmaster ranger? You'll have to do without your magic / animal for two levels."
DnD,3e26h8,szthesquid,4,Tue Jul 21 17:58:10 2015 UTC,"Ultimately for me the Pro and the Con of 5E is one in the same which is 5E relative simplicity to other D&D editions.  For alot of people, that means that they'll spend less time in their character sheets/PHBs and more time thinking about the environment, the NPCs, and manipulating the world around them.  If you or your players aren't used to the DM-May-I style manipulation of said world around them, then this edition is going to seem bland and very boring."
DnD,3e26h8,siegeszug,3,Tue Jul 21 14:29:45 2015 UTC,"It's simpler and more ""boring"" for most classes... unless you're a spellcaster or battlemaster fighter. You're going to lose a lot of the tactical feel in combat and teamwork isn't as fun for me anymore. Setting up flanks and forced movement into hazardous terrain was lots of fun for me and my group in 4e.  It's more difficult to do in 5e."
DnD,3e26h8,SkyCaptain13,3,Tue Jul 21 11:49:14 2015 UTC,Biggest con for me about 5th is there being no builder like there is for 4th.
DnD,3e26h8,ZenTempus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:23:27 2015 UTC,"If you prefer D&D feeling more like a videogame, with a stronger emphasis on combat and tactics, stick with 4E. If you prefer to roleplay and relax, move to 5E. Personally, I like 5E much more; combat is not incredibly convoluted, and it does not take up most of the session anymore (especially at higher levels, my goodness)."
DnD,3e26h8,richardjcompton,8,Tue Jul 21 11:54:40 2015 UTC,"I agree. The action economy of 4e was ridiculously complicated, esp. at paragon and above, where everyone would spend forever making sure they used that godforsaken minor action.   4e's technical systems are best suited to players who enjoyed min/maxing and fiddling with complicated mechanical interactions to produce, say 50 damage at level 1. At times it felt like the game punished you for not having a 20 in one of your stats at first level... Don't get me wrong I loved 4th, and character building in 5e is nowhere near as fun. Multiclassing in 4e is way more rewarding as well"
DnD,3e26h8,spirit_meats,2,Tue Jul 21 12:06:06 2015 UTC,"5E can lend itself to the combat and tactics if you want to give it that flavour (however, 4E is the king/queen of combat frenzy D&D).  I found that 5E is much more flexible and up to the DM.  However, reading it as it was written, it definitely reads much more as a Theater of the Mind with heavy RP elements in it."
DnD,3e26h8,ilikpankaks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:37:55 2015 UTC,"I usually have a high number of players at the table and 5e came out as these players were getting close to paragon tier.  I dreaded how long combat of 7 players at that tier was going to take.  We made the switch and although it wasn't completely without its speedbumps, it was still pretty smooth and I like it a whole lot better.  I still write and run skill challenges as my players and I enjoy them."

DnD,3e26h8,p01yg0n41,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:40:39 2015 UTC,"People say that 5e is less tactical or dynamic in combat than 4e. It is true to a certain extent that you will have fewer triggered abilities. For some classes this is basically just your basic attack. If that's not your thing, pick another class! Even the ""simple"" classes have complex options, and some of the ""complex"" classes, like Druid or Paladin, have ways to reduce that complexity if you don't want to engage with it. That's the same advice I'd give for a player using 4e essentials classes or 13th Age.   5e can be played technically with strong tactical combat and interesting terrain features. What gets in the way of that, and a big contributor to the impression of fast combat (which is still true for other reasons as well), is the encounter design recommendations. An easy combat should take 1 round, a medium combat should take about 2 and a hard combat 3-4. This range is much higher than 4e had in mind, but it serves the greater focus on procedural exploration.  If you want a more tactical combat experience in 5e, don't plan 6-8 easy to medium encounters the way the book suggests, plan 3-4 hard to deadly encounters. Use all the tricks you know: Use a grid, count squares, vary enemy types within and between encounters, create interesting terrain, include traps and hazards."
DnD,3e26h8,ChaosDent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:47:41 2015 UTC,"I started D&D with 4e, and had never seriously played any other edition until 5e came out. Now, I use 5e.  Pros:   Simplified game play. We all have 1-2 character sheets now instead of 3 or 4. We spend more time talking and laughing than studying our character sheets and books. Combat moves quicker. The skills make much more sense to us, like Deception and Performance. There isn't all kinds of + this and - this for conditions and situations. It's simplified into advantage and disadvantage, which I LOVE.   Cons:   Some of my players complain about spells. Spells have become less class-specific and aren't as ""special"" anymore.  Lots of things have become Feats now, making them less available."
DnD,3e26h8,peronne17,0,Tue Jul 21 19:38:44 2015 UTC,"4e was extremely combat-focused and lacked any real out-of-combat roleplaying options. 5e goes the other way by simplifying combat, taking each class back to its core (instead of everyone having powers like in 4e), and laying out guidelines and spells specifically for out-of-combat roleplaying and adventures."
DnD,3e26h8,1000thSon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:26:16 2015 UTC,"4E - More combat centric. Encounters all revolve around using your combat abilities or throwing dice one way or another. It's a lot more tactical. 5E - A LOT of emphasis is taken off combat and refocused on building storytelling for your character.  If you're thinking too much time was spent on encounters and focusing on mechanics rather than the story of your campaign, then 5E is the game for you."
DnD,3e26h8,Corronchilejano,0,Tue Jul 21 13:23:40 2015 UTC,"5E combat is streamlined. There isn't a ton of content. Instead of 5,000+ feats, feats are an option you take instead of advancing a stat, and they have a lot more power. 5e rules are less dense, which is a good and bad thing."
DnD,3e26h8,lilsteviejobs,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:29:03 2015 UTC,"5e is a dumbed down version of dnd. It is more simple in every way, if you like simpler game without deep/interesting mechanics (because of this combat is arguably faster) it would be better for you. 5e is less of a game and more of a ""storytelling instrument""."
DnD,3e26h8,offoy,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:45:23 2015 UTC,I like how every comment that said something positive about 4e got downvoted. This place doesn't change.  Play 4e if it's what you've been enjoying. There's nothing particularly new in 5e that 3.5 didn't already do.  And here come the downvotes!
DnD,3e26h8,Crossfiyah,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:16:26 2015 UTC,If you're enjoying what you're doing stick with it.  Personal opinion: drop 4e......preferably down a well.

A level 20 character should almost never fail a save against a level 5's attack, but if it's entirely based off of an attribute bonus then it's not just possible, it's often very likely."
DnD,3dwg7z,supermochabear,66,Mon Jul 20 05:06:56 2015 UTC,"That is actually a design point. They call it bounded accuracy , it gives a chance for characters to still hit you, even if your super high level mega god.   Just because you are level 20 doesn't mean you are anything compared to a Demi-God.   This helps reduce the abuse by putting hard caps to anything you could possibly due because the numbers can only go up so high before you max out."
DnD,3dwg7z,silverwolfer,3,Mon Jul 20 05:48:43 2015 UTC,But even Gods' caps feel too low for me. I think it is kind of ridiculous that at 20th level an elven barbarian can have 24 strength while raging compared to the Tarrasque's or Kord's 30.
DnD,3dwg7z,Mandalorehero,14,Mon Jul 20 13:43:30 2015 UTC,"An extremely powerful mortal hero shouldn't, IMO, be as strong as Godzilla+ or the literal God of Strength."
DnD,3dwg7z,Bhangbhangduc,2,Mon Jul 20 14:12:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The 30 max cap feels way too low. In 3.5 the Tarrasque and Kord had strengths 45 and 55 respectively (not to mention Thor's wtf strength of 92). With the rules for breaking down walls with strength checks, these were some of the few who could make the DC for stone walls. In 5e either an epic barbarian has a chance at pushing down a stone wall of a castle, or the tarrasque has no ability to. Either way it seems way off."
DnD,3dwg7z,Mandalorehero,5,Mon Jul 20 14:25:52 2015 UTC,"Ahh, no, I see. As a permaDM, I would just handwave it, I probably would never make either one of these characters ever have to make a strength check for something as mundane as smashing up a castle. Hell, I'd probably let Kord pick up a city and only make him roll to carry around a continent or something.   I think a high-level barbarian should have a decent chance to break down a mundane wall, though. That's high-level stuff."
DnD,3dwg7z,Bhangbhangduc,2,Mon Jul 20 14:29:48 2015 UTC,"30 means that the creature gets +10 to hit; any higher and the math of 5e starts to fall apart. Instead of thinking of ""reality"" (this is a game with magic and elves, forget that), think of it in terms of mechanics.  There are size-based advantages that aren't really in the base 30 number.    Hit die is determined by size (DMG275). More importantly is on DMG 278, ""Double the weapon dice if the creature is Large, triple the weapon dice if it's Huge, quadruple the weapon dice if it's Gargantuan.""    So a Hill Giant (str 21) has +8 to hit and does 3d8+5 damage; a 10th level barbarian with 20 strength, would have +8 to hit and only do 1d12+5 damage. That's an average of 7 additional points of damage simply for being bigger."
DnD,3dwg7z,egamma,6,Mon Jul 20 22:10:11 2015 UTC,But damage still scales doesn't it? As do HP. So it's not very consistent in that regard.  Edit: this was a criticism of the commenter above me claiming that bounded accuracy ensures realism.
DnD,3dwg7z,insert_topical_pun,35,Mon Jul 20 06:19:38 2015 UTC,"No it keeps things touchable, the HP and damage scales but the hit/accuracy level stays the same mostly.  So nothing is really unbalanced you just can't make yourself or the monsters unhittiable."
DnD,3dwg7z,silverwolfer,9,Mon Jul 20 06:27:56 2015 UTC,"but that 4th lvl character will never have a chance against a 20th level character by dealing straight damage, because they have so little damage and HP comparatively. Already there is level imbalance - this is fine for some, others dislike even this.  But that same 4th level character could use a spell designed to paralyze, stun, blind, etc. the 20th level character, and it will be practically as effective as if it were used against a 4th level character, because saves do not scale. That's 'balance' between levels, but gross imbalance between abilities.  Edit: not talking AC here, I'm talking saves"
DnD,3dwg7z,insert_topical_pun,12,Mon Jul 20 06:34:15 2015 UTC,"Some saves do scale. Each class has save proficiencies. So if you are a level 20 Fighter with maxed strength and decent Constitution then your STR save is +11 and you Con save is +8 or 9. But his other saves are low which makes sense because he is a Fighter who focused on those abilities.   Every class has things they are strong with and things they are weak with. There are plenty of spells, abilities, items, and feats to address various weaknesses but you have to work at it and its better if you have a group that fills in eachother's gaps. No one character will be invincible.  That's good design."
DnD,3dwg7z,Maebure83,4,Mon Jul 20 09:19:24 2015 UTC,On top of this the DCs for spells are much lower as well. A 4th level caster most likely has saves that are around 13 or 14 and potentially lower. With proficiency in the save the 20th level character should almost always succeed.
DnD,3dwg7z,kingofthen00bs,19,Mon Jul 20 11:57:16 2015 UTC,Would that be any different then trying to balance a regular dude against a skilled solider ?   How could you show such a difference without some sort of advantage for the solider.   If you make such a system that shows the difference would it not then be the difference of someone who is unskilled versus someone who is very skilled...  therefore imbalanced ?  The 20th level character will have toys/class abilties/ and gimzos to help supplement the weakness of being human while the regular unskilled person will have no way to counter the inherent weakness.
DnD,3dwg7z,silverwolfer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:41:37 2015 UTC,"I don't care about the increased damage and HP as levels increase. That's a fundamental of the system. It's a bit silly, but it's also a game, so whatever.  The issue is that spells from a low-level caster are almost as dangerous to a 20th level caster as they are to a 1st level. That's inconsistent with increasing HP and damage as you level up to make higher level characters more powerful, and it's inconsistent when compared to level-equivalent capabilities.  That's always the way it's been for D&D, but removing scaling saves just exacerbates the issue."
DnD,3dwg7z,insert_topical_pun,4,Mon Jul 20 06:46:49 2015 UTC,"This has always been an issue with D&D in general, because of the way AC and HP work. They don't have any roots in reality. Imagine if some level 3 assassin caught your level 20 off guard, put his dagger to your throat, and raked it across. 1d4 damage. In reality you would just die. At least it seems 5e is sort of trying to curb that unrealistic connection to ""the fiction"" a little bit with bounded accuracy."
DnD,3dwg7z,Black_Scarlet,2,Mon Jul 20 12:37:54 2015 UTC,"A single 4th level player couldn't beat a level 20 player, no. But a hoard of them could. In previous editions, the 4th level players would basically be unable to actually hit a level 20 player because numbers like AC just scale so much. This means that even a large number of weak opponents wouldn't really stand a chance. 5e fixes that."
DnD,3dwg7z,Zagorath,8,Mon Jul 20 15:54:23 2015 UTC,"That's the entire point.  Basically, there are two 'axes'* that matter for combat; targets/bonuses (AC and attack bonus, or saves and DCs) and damage absorption (HP and damage).  In previous editions, both axes scaled with level, meaning that the difference between characters of different levels was exponential.   e.g. say you've got a 50% chance of hitting a same-level character for 50% of its HP, meaning the expected damage per attack is 25% of the target's HP.  Then if you attack someone of a higher level, maybe you've got a 40% chance of hitting for 40% of their HP. Now the expected damange of your attack is only 16% of the target's HP!  Similarly, if you had a 60% chance of hitting a lower-level target for 60% of their HP, now your expected damage is 36%.  As a result, it's very difficult in older editions to have parties of mixed levels, and enemies are generally only useful for a relatively narrow band of levels.  The idea is that now the target/bonus axis is fixed (sort of, it still scales a bit, which really bugs me), so in the examples above you'd always have a 50% chance of hitting but you'd do 40%, 50%, or 60% of the target's HP in damage.  *Three if you count the great axe ;)"
DnD,3dwg7z,Asmor,18,Mon Jul 20 12:56:23 2015 UTC,"They play by Game of Thrones rules, otherwise Olly wouldn't have done shit."
DnD,3dwg7z,Dramatic_Explosion,5,Mon Jul 20 05:37:03 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I think that is one of the things I really like about 5e.  If a Kobold's poison kills a high level wizard, sure that is anti-climactic, but it is representative of the limitations of mortality in the game.  You're not all powerful, invincible, or immortal just because you are level twenty."
DnD,3dwg7z,darthNinjabro,2,Mon Jul 20 14:39:35 2015 UTC,"I suppose, although it makes DMing difficult sometimes. Some spells are powerful because they have a relatively low chance of full success. Kinda sucks when your big boss gets banished for a full minute because he didn't roll over a nat 15, especially when you wanted the encounter to be challenging."
DnD,3dwg7z,supermochabear,3,Mon Jul 20 15:06:29 2015 UTC,"I'd love 5e if not for how limiting skills are. 3.5 was a little bloated with skills, but I'd rather have that than the incredibly simple skill system we got in 5e. I made a face rogue and even with my Expertise, I still only get 6 trained skills, so after training Deception, Persuasion, Insight, Perception, Slight of Hand and Thieves Tools, I'm the best rogue in the world at being untrained in Stealth.I liked how in 3.5 I could throw my skill points about and be really good at, say Diplomacy and Bluff and pretty good at 15 other Rogue skills, but in 5e there's no room for that."
DnD,3dwg7z,Vandelay_Latex_Sales,7,Mon Jul 20 13:34:19 2015 UTC,"As a heads up, you get 6 trained skills, not 6 total trained proficiencies.  For example, if you are a Rogue with the Charlatan Background, you would get 4 trained skills from Rogue, 2 trained skills (Deception and Sleight of of Hand) from Charlatan, and you are trained with Thieves Tools (Rogue) and Disguise Kit / Forgery Kit (Charlatan).  Your complaints are definitely still valid but Rogues should have six distinct skills, independent of their proficiencies, that they are trained in. And two of those skills, or one of those skills and thieves tools, that they are experts in."
DnD,3dwg7z,Kgreene2343,33,Mon Jul 20 13:59:30 2015 UTC,"I haven't played D&D for maybe 7 years. Took one look at 4e and hated it. But 3.5 will always be my fav. Started in 1996 with AD&D.  The expansions were only a problem with 3.5 if you let the powergamers run the show. We had a guy like that who the DM would never say no to, so he was allowed to build his stupid mounted charge character who combined talents from a bunch of different books and was totally broken, and the DM made every adventure take place somewhere he could bring his horse. smh."
DnD,3dwg7z,Buscat,20,Mon Jul 20 05:44:42 2015 UTC,"That's why we completely randomized everything during character creation in 3.5. Even names. We'd roll 3D4+1D6 for letters you could use in your name which you'd have to pick randomly out of a Scrabble bag. We'd roll a D12 for class, if I remember correctly, and 12 would let you roll from a list of classes from the expansion books. Then you had to hope your ability rolls actually matched up with the class.   If your character was broken as fuck, well, you earned that privilege with your good dice rolls."
DnD,3dwg7z,Opset,61,Mon Jul 20 05:55:40 2015 UTC,That sounds horrific.
DnD,3dwg7z,Wanderlustfull,20,Mon Jul 20 06:09:41 2015 UTC,"It was hands down the single best campaign I've ever played. We each probably went through about 10 characters throughout the summer. When we got to about level 15, the DM let us resurrect our favorite characters from the past and reroll their abilities.  It was incredibly fun to have a new character every week though. It forced you to learn how to play them differently based on our rolls. Made you learn the DnD rules inside and out and made us all better roleplayers. One week, you'd roll a character who was a paragon of virtue, but so useless because the rest of the group rolled selfish and evil characters and was able to overwhelm your opinions. Then maybe 2 nights from then, you'd have to reroll and you'd be the powerful one in charge of group decisions.   Made the game very dynamic. I suggest everyone play a long term campaign like this at least once. New players would get a little upset at first when their character would die, but they discovered quickly that that was what made the game fun."
DnD,3dwg7z,Opset,16,Mon Jul 20 06:22:09 2015 UTC,Was this a function of your characters dying every session due to being totally randomized?
DnD,3dwg7z,lijern,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:01:05 2015 UTC,"I have never played in a campaign where everyone did it, but I have played many characters where everything was randomized and these were often my best and most interesting characters.  I named them though."
DnD,3dwg7z,mysticrudnin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:19:51 2015 UTC,"I don't like the idea of randomly rolling for class. Roll for stats, for background, heck even for race, but rolling for class doesn't make sense to me.   If you get a halfling with 8 strength and 10 dexterity, they are just never going to become a fighter. It's just never going to happen; it doesn't make sense.   To me, it makes sense that one might roll for everything prior to that, since the character doesn't get to choose the circumstances of their birth or their natural abilities. But they do get to choose what they do with those abilities."
DnD,3dwg7z,Zagorath,2,Mon Jul 20 16:32:45 2015 UTC,"Of course. That makes sense. But I don't play games just because they make sense, they don't have to emulate reality or even sensibility. I'm playing the games for new and interesting experiences.  My Halfling might have been a castle guard his whole life until he was injured and bedridden for years, and is only now coming back into his loved life of fighting.  What are his other stats? You can put those into play, as well. A high con can be a good excuse to be a fighter."
DnD,3dwg7z,mysticrudnin,12,Mon Jul 20 16:46:14 2015 UTC,"That sounds fantastic. The closest I've gotten was ""roll one 3d6 each stat in turn, then try to pick an appropriate class to fit your stats - no, I can't tell you what class the other PCs are, you haven't met them yet, silly"". (It's great. Absolutely the only way to play.)"
DnD,3dwg7z,MikoSqz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:48:10 2015 UTC,"I think this is the better way to do things. Roll for stats, background, and race, since the character wouldn't get to choose those.

DnD,3dwg7z,A_Stoned_Smurf,5,Mon Jul 20 06:12:17 2015 UTC,Everything makes some sense except for the random names. Your name has absolutely no impact on how powerful your character is. Randomizing the names sounds absolutely useless to me and takes out part of making your character truly yours.
DnD,3dwg7z,OwenLeaf,8,Mon Jul 20 12:42:17 2015 UTC,"Understandable. I liked it, though. We managed to make some good ones. Had a cleric named Qoogeta Slant which, due to illiteracy, she insisted was pronounced Vegeta and the 'Slant' part was silent, a samurai named Dewabizoa, a barbarian named Satan Gimsly, and a dwarf warrior named Tuhgi Torr.  But that was only after we decided Scrabble tiles were the best way to do it. Before that we rolled for a page, column, and word in the dictionary. One of my early characters, a Kuo-toa which actually had some great rolls, but was crushed by a giant after about 10 minutes of playtime, was named Ski-mask Overture.  Using the dictionary did give us the name of a deity one of the characters started worshiping which became a major part of the plot later; Paraquat. The only place any of us had ever heard that word before was in The Big Lebowski, so Paraquat ended up taking the form of the Dude as well as his 'philosophy'."
DnD,3dwg7z,Opset,3,Mon Jul 20 13:19:19 2015 UTC,"If you get the itch again, give 5e a try. It's been pretty good to me so far. Pathfinder is good too, but 5e lets you focus on the story telling instead of being bogged down in the mechanics."
DnD,3dwg7z,Ninbyo,13,Mon Jul 20 11:32:32 2015 UTC,I still love the mechanics behind it. I think it's why my group has tended to favor pathfinder over 4e or 5e.

I honestly won't do pathfinder because I don't want to try and govern such a content rich system that you can rape with broken combos.  I forced my group to 5e for simplification and streamlining my responsibility at the DM side of the table.
DnD,3dwg7z,silverwolfer,12,Mon Jul 20 05:51:14 2015 UTC,It's all about priorities. I don't have problems handling my group and I'm willing to take time to counter balance adventures and encounters to whatever my party creates.

DnD,3dwg7z,T_esakii,31,Mon Jul 20 03:49:48 2015 UTC,"I might be wrong, but I thought the tattoo was only for Triple X (meaning it was drawn on). Still really cool, though."

DnD,3dwg7z,Condomonium,2,Mon Jul 20 08:22:00 2015 UTC,"He said that Melkor was a Tolkien name in a Kimmel interview, so he might be."

DnD,3dwg7z,Kablooey88,2,Mon Jul 20 11:55:13 2015 UTC,It all makes sense now. His Melkor character was a witch hunter. The first thing I though of when I saw his new movie trailer was imagining Vin getting interested in playing his old character in person on screen.

Part of it was that I don't like the movies he's in, but if I'm being honest, part of it was probably envy.

MOST fondant is ether overly rich or is just kind of there.. Anything that can be done with fondant can also be done with standard whipped cream, cream cheese, buttercream... It just takes more skill to get it smooth, and putting in the years of training to get that good is something most wont do. Hence the popularity of fondant, imho."

Not in reference to d&d, just a veiled threat.   I KNOW the guy has rolled his share of d20s, and I think most of us around here are likely to know that. I was trying to reference one of his films and that apparently went tits up.   Also, I'm drunk. I'm 99% sure but that's a drunk 99%."

Theater of Mind is a tried and true method that everyone should try out at least once!

It's pretty disheartening to see very little interest after spending many many hours on it.
DnD,3e3scu,Spe333,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:03:55 2015 UTC,I'm guessing the PHB you bought was 3e? The one WotC has is for 4e. You're probably going to need to find the disc

The research of the body especially looks pretty balanced, but Research of the Soul may need a little clarification on the first 2, and Instant Mind seems pretty crazy powerful for a level 14.  Again, I haven't played at that level yet, so maybe it's pretty close to in line with other classes.    I couldn't go super in depth or anything right now, but so far, great job."
DnD,3e1kov,Star_Tropic,10,Tue Jul 21 06:36:26 2015 UTC,"It's a fun little mechanic, I would suggest however that you reduce to a d8 and instead reset to a chance of 1/8 on the door after a trapped one. Obviously that's up to you and what kind of dungeon you'r using it for but I can definitely see how you might get to 8/10 and then have the next 4 doors trapped making it become very tedious."
DnD,3e1kov,TraneHartnet,3,Tue Jul 21 07:40:32 2015 UTC,"Not trying to jump on your comment, but for the sake of comparison with my other comment, the method suggested here gives an average trap probability of 31% over a large number of doors:  https://repl.it/xyu/2"

DnD,3e1kov,Nytik,6,Tue Jul 21 17:08:27 2015 UTC,"For me it depends on the dungeon and what lives there.  If it's an inhabited castle, it doesn't make sense to have traps on common, high-traffic areas.  A long-abandoned dungeon might have some of the traps already sprung by previous explorers, leaving their corpses where they lay if there's isn't anything that cleans up the messes.  Traps make sense on vaults and defensive choke points though."
DnD,3e1kov,S_Jeru,4,Tue Jul 21 09:30:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, whilst the above mechanic could be alright in a hap-hazard on-the-fly game, I support the logical path like yourself."
DnD,3e1kov,Heliosra,2,Tue Jul 21 10:09:37 2015 UTC,Don't know why I didn't think to make that a part of my dungeons. Expended/broken traps would be a great tool for adding to the ambiance - not to mention making the group skittish as all hell.
DnD,3e1kov,Einbrecher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:07:10 2015 UTC,"It's also a handy way to distribute loot, maps, and supplies.  Instead of putting it all in a hoard at the end, drop a few bits on dead explorers.  It could be something as simple as rope or lantern oil, or some jewelry or a magic item for the final battle."
DnD,3e1kov,S_Jeru,3,Tue Jul 21 15:11:23 2015 UTC,"Due to the chance only decreasing by 0.1 when a trap is triggered, your probability will tend to oscillate around p = 0.5 and so approximately half your doors will be trapped. Of course, if you want half your doors to be trapped then this is fine.  Here's some code to check (sloppy but hopefully easy to understand): https://repl.it/xyu/1"
DnD,3e1kov,Nytik,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:35:28 2015 UTC,I don't think this would be easy to understand for anyone who doesn't know anything about coding..

DnD,3e1kov,Nytik,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:27 2015 UTC,Seems like a decent idea but could do with a little refinement if you get into the higher numbers a chain of doors have a high chance to be trapped. Also because of this some doors which make no sense to be trapped could be and if players catch on to the system you will have players heavily inspecting doors if they went through 3 with no trap
DnD,3e1kov,Oshava,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:30:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the specifics on the math, but this is basically how some competitive games (LoL, Dota 2, etc) do critical hits.  If you nail down the numbers it's a pretty solid system, although it still allows your party to get screwed sometimes - but since DnD isn't a competitive game, having to deal with getting screwed by random numbers a bit is okay."
DnD,3e3e98,AarchangelSC,6,Tue Jul 21 17:28:25 2015 UTC,"Is his tail in any way useful in combat, or is it simply cosmetic?  The stats for teifling suggest it is just cosmetic.    It cannot be used to open doors, or hold a candle which means it isn't dexterous enough to accurately swing a weapon.  (Think of Nightcrawler of the X-Men wielding a cutlass with his tail).  It's also not a natural weapon capable of smashing enemies which means it isn't strong enough to attack with. (Think of The Lizard, foe of Spider-Man, smashing the web-slinger in the face).  Since it's neither dexterous nor strong, it cannot be used to ""wield"" a weapon/tool."
DnD,3e3e98,trollburgers,4,Tue Jul 21 17:39:28 2015 UTC,"First off, he can't force you to make it possible. You're the DM, not him. If he throws a stink then it's too bad for him.  With that said, I think the idea is at least fun in concept. I don't know how much control a tiefling would have over his tail or how strong it would be to attempt to control something like that. I feel like it would be like a cat trying to attack with its tail. It can give you a thump but it's not going to do any real damage. Ever try to pick a cat up by its tail? The thing will freak the fuck out. I figure tieflings are similar. They have some control over the tail, but there's a reason they don't mechanically have a tail slap attack in the game.  If the player wants to use the tail for carrying the chain and hook, then I see no problem, but I highly doubt he would be able to effectively use it or wield it in a fight without also using his hands."
DnD,3e3e98,holyplankton,2,Tue Jul 21 17:34:21 2015 UTC,"Okay, so fighting is out of the question, how about using it to throw the grappling hook up onto a ledge and climbing up the chain?"
DnD,3e3e98,holyplankton,3,Tue Jul 21 17:38:04 2015 UTC,"If he has at least a 12 STR I think I would allow him to carry the chain with his tail, but not use it to actively throw it anywhere. Like /u/kindulas said, you could always design a feat for him to take, make him pay for something like this instead of just giving it to him. Make it replace an ability score increase or a feat."
DnD,3e3e98,Kindulas,2,Tue Jul 21 17:46:21 2015 UTC,Same as throwing it normally but with disadvantage I guess. Which is still being very generous.
DnD,3e3e98,Kindulas,3,Tue Jul 21 17:45:54 2015 UTC,"To be fair, tiefling tails are more reptilian. Past editions had ways to get ""prehensile tail"" and do things like grab items and use thieves tools.  Still, I agree with your principles and it doesn't seem so strong as to attack with it... Or, I mean, 10 feet of chain.  So to OP: while it is good to try and make player things work, if a player does actually try to demand something of the DM, that's grounds for not doing it on principle. This is the kind of thing you shouldn't feel especially pressures to make work, since it's waaaay outside the bounds of intended capabilities. However, if you want to run a ""silly stuff goes"" kind of ship, which there is nothing wrong with... What's his class and STR score? Could create a feat for it, he'd need to pay for something this silly"
DnD,3e3e98,rollingForInitiative,4,Tue Jul 21 17:39:57 2015 UTC,"I'd easily allow it as flavour. Just say that for balance reasons (literally his balance), he can't attack with his tail and hands at the same time. He swings the weapon with his tail, but can't really fight with his arms at the same time. Instead, he could flavour it as using his arms to parry incoming strikes when they miss. Same with climbing.   He gets to use his tail and be cool in combat, but it won't change anything mechanically."
DnD,3e3e98,AggressivePoliteGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:04:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah same here, seems like a flavor thing to me which I don't really mind that much as long as its reasonable, plus I like to reward my PCs when they're creative."
DnD,3e3e98,Kindulas,2,Tue Jul 21 18:18:46 2015 UTC,Hands to block and tail to attack is a pretty damn cool image... I'd be more inclined to just tie a dagger or spearhead to the tail myself (get a scorpion tail going on)
DnD,3e3e98,EyebeeLurkin,3,Tue Jul 21 18:27:24 2015 UTC,"Well it's a really cool idea, so it's not a bad thing to allow it. There's no reason it should do any more than d4+str damage if he's using it in combat, and it shouldn't have any additional benefit to climbing other than being really cool.  Also chains jangle. Give him disadvantage on stealth rolls as if he were wearing chainmail. Ofc, be up front with that and don't ambush him with it next time he tries to sneak around."

With no chance of surviving, the Black Spider turned invisible and climbed to the top of the dwarf statue and started to pry out the fake emerald eyes in an attempt to bring the ceiling down on our party members; a trap he discovered only that morning. Zurgo, frustrated and enraged from his inability to hit anything with his club, dropped it and channeled all of that frustration into pushing the 12 ft statue over into the last place he saw the Black Spider. As it tumbled to the ground, the group saw the evil drow mage reappear, his concentration broken as he muttered, ""well shit, this went south quickly. Stupid, stupid bard. Why couldn't we just be civilized?"" The statue came crashing down, crushing his legs and nearly killing him. He passed out from the pain. Zurgo saved the day! No ceiling collapse! Except for there was. Moments later, while the rest of the party was outside greeting Zelthana's mother, Zurgo and Hammish could not resist the emerald eyes!

He pitted us against two gravity elementals with a damage reduction of 10- without our hard hitting fighter. Essentially, it would have taken at least fifteen rounds to kill them, if we'd been landing hits every turn, and we'd run out of healing spells in three.   On top of this, they'd just need to hit us the one time with a grapple to absorb us and kill us, something we didn't have the stats to fight back against, especially as they wittled us down.  So we ran away... through the dungeon... and the fucking DM has them just chew the wooden door off it's hinges. We're moving and they're following at 100ft movement speed. A solid iron door held them for three turns of attacks only.   He was legitimately trying to TPK us, not because he wanted us to die, but because it'd be implausible of him not to- to have them go soft- and he wants us to know we'll die if we fuck up.  We now have a dimension door, and the policy of 'one party member dies and we run away if shit goes south' when we can't carry them with us.   My GM terrifies me."

To me, this was... refreshing. It did perhaps go a little too far with the gravity elementals, but that's the thing; it was a real world, where we encountered a problem we couldn't solve, and it was hell bent on killing us to the best of it's abilities. It wasn't not busting through the metal door because it just lost interest, it was a summoned elemental bound to kill us and by jove... it was gonna do that realistically.  /u/Proto-Fett should note, he's not a hard ass all the time. If we die, he's made it clear that we won't all just be re-rolling- there will probably be a way for us, if reasonable, to come back to life.

In the majority of our social encounters, the party would try to use tact (""So...where were you on the 11th?  Would 15g help you remember?

It's that he doesn't know any other way to play the game than to be ""The Paladin"" in every campaign, every situation, every character, and every class.  When I looked around the table and saw that the rogue's player was about to burst a blood vessel, I did what I could to diffuse the situation in a way that allowed the paladin to play the game the way he knows how to play, while also allowing the rest of the party to mitigate the paladin's directness, and advance the plot without constantly having to repair our burned bridges.  This guy is a great guy out of the game, but he struggles with accepting that playing a bad character doesn't make him a bad person in the real world.

DnD,3dyj67,wraithja,6,Mon Jul 20 21:17:09 2015 UTC,The fighter in the campaign I'm DMing had to fight a hardened orc warrior to gain entry into an orc outpost. He cast minor illusion on his shield (he's an eldritch knight) to have an orc gods symbol appear on it. The orc bowed down to him and after exchanging blows with the orc alpha and a good roll he is now their bloodkin. I gave him orc resilience for it. Thanks to the redditor who gave me that idea

If they don't have a skill and you want to roll it for them, then you use the standard way of working it out.   If it's listed, all the math is pre-done for you.  Edit: This is 5e I'm assuming?

Yes, in the 'Str +/- X' part, the 'Str' represents whatever total you would add to a regular strength-based melee basic attack (which would include weapon modifiers), and then the particular power you're using may be more or less accurate (in this case 1 less accurate), so the total would be D20 + Str-modifier + weapon properties (in you're proficient with it)."

Tremorsense and Infrared/Heat vision can see through stealth in some ways.  Alternatively, give them living organisms as a challenge. Perhaps they're trying to be stealthy in a copper dragon's lair, but all the mice and birds are insistent on having obnoxiously loud small talk to the trying-to-stealth PC; perhaps the mission involves rescuing a baby in the middle of a war camp -- it's difficult to sneak around with a crying infant."

The Fire Mage who manages to survive the hell hound encounter will feel like a badass, a truly cool mage who can take on the toughest of foes. this is the common gaming fantasy of empowerment  Stealth encounters are not about feeling like a badass, but rather a puzzle environment where timing, patience and planning should be the prized factors. the encounter should have multiple routes to completetion, where you can be a ghost to the enemy, or a shadow of death, or a mix inbetween. the challenge should be about puzzling their way through the route, and have the threats be dangerous to take head on.  this requires a completely different level design, and if you're trying to seriously mix it in with high octane empowerment scenarios, you may leave the rogue wondering why he couldn't be a badass in the stealth sections, or like you're being unfair by switching out the challenge type."

My first thought for this would be a variable Stealth score, so that if the NPC doesn't suspect you nearby, you have an easy score to beat via stealth, but in area of light or within a square or two of the enemy, have the roll jump to much higher levels, which may help the player have an easier decision as to where not to stay out of the light, stay away from enemies if you can. EDIT: or if you've been seen have a harder score.  also if the enemies detect him/her, you can have a marker where the player thinks he was last seen based on the enemies he knows about, can use that to get away and roll for stealth."

DnD,3e1cjq,The_Rathour,6,Tue Jul 21 06:02:07 2015 UTC,"Something to remember is that stealth =! invisibility. Giving the party a very well lit area with very little (or even no) cover to navigate can make a Rogue's life difficult.  Alternatively, create things that happen that aren't sight-based. Maybe the floor is covered in glass shards that crinkle anytime you step on them, or is littered with wooden cups that you'd have to Acrobat through to remain quiet (exposing you to sight). Perhaps create a pitfall that sends the Rogue into a pile of excrement, meaning everything in a ~20ft radius can smell them no matter how well they attempt to hide from sight.  Lots and lots of remaining hidden is based first on sight, second on hearing, and third on smell - So try to create situations where one of these things is completely impossible and one of the remaining two is difficult."
DnD,3e1cjq,Drewfro666,2,Tue Jul 21 08:14:15 2015 UTC,"Having it be well-lit with little cover is an idea. The rogue can't hide in an empty, circular room which is illuminated by a magical, permeating light."

What I might do is have the cover change, like with sliding panels or machinery or something, or require that the rogue make the cover/heavy concealment themselves (flipping some tables, shattering big urns of ash, shooting out the only lantern in a room of human cultists - which I actually did once, and it was really effective)."

Something else that falls into the category would be Tremorsense, where no matter how light on your feet you are, you still emanate shockwaves into the ground, and thus, can be spotted just as easily.

Set up a situation where the rogue has to sneak in to get something the party needs, and fighting their way through is clearly not a good option. Put a lot of effort placing the guards and light sources so that the rogue has to figure out how he's going to get through without getting caught. Establish the various patrols and reflect that on the map - run it just like combat with turns and whatnot. If he fails a stealth check, don't coin it as immediate discovery - run it as if a guard heard something and is then going over to investigate.

As soon as the Urchin gets to work, baddies flood the room or chamber they're in. The trick is to make it clear that the baddies won't stop; like the finale in a Left 4 Dead match.   The gimmick is to tear up some pieces of paper and draw a key  on one of them. draw a skull on another. Toss them all in a hat, and for every substantial Disable Device/ Lockpick roll lets your Thief player dig in the hat for the key. If he draws the key, the door opens.

The wizard's player would like to not merely follow the fighter's lead, but they're too non-confrontational to do anything about it. They're not going to say anything mid session, worrying about an argument. But approach them about it alone, they might admit to feeling bossed around.  2) Not really. The wizard's player is just a passive follower by nature, they're enjoying playing the game by being ""along for the ride,"" and they're fine with not having to overthink things.

If he wants to DM, he can put together campaigns, write characters, and throw himself at your mercy for 4+ hours at a time.  If you think the wizard just needs some prodding to get into it, then try to create an atmosphere in which he can feel comfortable. One in which you can say ""Look, fighter, we're playing MY D&D now.

Also, the system is specifically designed to encourage player interaction in the setting- when a player says 'wouldnt it be cool if X happened', the system backs that up and helps the DM to back it up.  dunno if it's heresy to say 'dont use DND for everything', but with a low player-count game games like dungeon world are really special."

If neither of them have a problem with how it is working and this is the dynamic they enjoy then that is what they want to play and there is nothing wrong with that.

The second option is maybe they save a NPC from somewhere that sticks with the party for protection, it won't get involved in combat but help around camp and such, maybe it takes a shine to the wizard and often chats with him, if the fighter butts in maybe the NPC will start ignoring him due to rudeness.

You need to let your players know that they can't have one play style and one dominate aspect of the game, he needs to think about his action more and you need to put scenarios in where perhaps the Fighter is not most powerful.  Also try some sneaky DM stuff, whisper information to players, pass notes, try and do things to get both characters involved.  Say for example, a NPC only wants to talk to the wizard but not the fighter, if the fighter gets all aggressive and tries to storm in with them, say a magical forces pushes him back aggressively taking a total of (xDx) Damage. Then whisper to the wizard what is needed to be said.  This will make the wizard feel more involved and more crucial to the story, while the fighter possibly learns they can not barge everything."

Also, a two-person party is pretty weak and lacks the versatility that even a 3-person party has.  Now, as to ""solutions""....There are two things I can think of off the top of my head. Aside from the obvious of talking to the players and letting them know that you disapprove of the fighter's methods. 1) Set a boss that regenerates or is resistant to non-magical weapons. Something that the fighter is actively punished for attacking. Analogously, the enemy could be several levels above your characters. 2) Have a mission where there is no actual combat. Maybe a random encounter, fine. But searching an ancient tomb for lost texts or strange artifacts would give puzzles that they can't just blast their way through.  As to rule-lawyering...Either learn the rules yourself so you can overrule him or/and set your foot down that you are the DM, and you are the one interpreting the rules. After talking to them, of course."
DnD,3e1kat,SkybreakSpatterlight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:28:33 2015 UTC,"Even assuming both players are cool with the status quo, I'd mix things up.   Occasionally divide the party, and don't allow the fighter to suggest when his character is elsewhere. Also you migt set up a social situation where the NPC (perhaps a mage) has no interest in what the meatshield says, he needs to shut up and let the wizard talk or the NPC will not be helpful. Finally you can set up a situation where the fighter's honorable methods will clearly get innocent civilians killed and have him wrestle with that.   It is not the GMs responsibility to provide success whatever the players choose to do."
DnD,3e1kat,captainraffi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:04 2015 UTC,"Experiment and put things in front of them that need skills the wizard has and the fighter doesn't.  My guess is that the fighter player is a min/max kind of person so look at the fighters min stuff.  Example would be a key NPC will only interact with someone knowledgeable in the arcane. Stuff like that.  Adjust, watch, learn, re-adjust."
DnD,3e1kat,JesseBrown447,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:07 2015 UTC,"First answer is to talk to the players outside of the game. Let the assertive guy know that you don't appreciate his backseat-DMing and that you'll only listen to what he says if it works for you and that if you rule something different then tough noogies. Then talk to the wizard player and ask he is ok with being dragged along and if he's enjoying himself. DnD is supposed to be communal, you're all telling a story together and not fighting players vs DM or everyone trying to turn their single character into The Savior Of The World Best Most Awesome Person"

DnD,3e0f40,Ender-of-Bart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:27:14 2015 UTC,"Wow your characters amassed a fortune. In that case I would increase some of the prices but use the guide as a reference between items.  In the DMG they give advice for starting characters at higher levels.   levels 1-4: Normal starting equipment levels 5-10: 500 gp plus 1d10 x 25 gp normal starting equipment levels 11-16: 5,000 gp plus 1d10 x 250 gp two uncommon magic items, normal starting equipment levels 17-20: 20,000 gp plus 1d10 x 250 gp, two uncommon magic items, one rare item, normal starting equipment   Your characters have as much gold as the DMG expects a level 17 character to start with.  In contrast however, they are right in line with gold acquisition by treasure hoards: https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/2r8kci/deconstructing_5e_typical_wealth_by_level/"
DnD,3e0f40,Shuliak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:00:01 2015 UTC,You get a ton of coin in horde then a ton more in RoT all these dragons have hordes for the most part and it adds up quite quickly. You have nothing to spend it on but buying magic items like this would likely trivialize encounters imo.
DnD,3e0f40,montezumar,2,Tue Jul 21 13:06:15 2015 UTC,"True enough. But keep in mind this isn't a shopping list for players, it's a tool for DM's to help sort value between items. In addition, the DM has the final say so.  Several of the comments in the post and the /r/dndnext post mention things like ""Oh no.. I may have sold my level 5 rogue PC high level armor for a fraction of what it's worth"".

With a bit of luck on persuasion checks, the party was able to sell them for 20,000 gp, far more than we had accumulated through the entirety of the campaign.

DnD,3e2jqi,thomar,4,Tue Jul 21 14:35:52 2015 UTC,"Note that D&D 4e has an official character creation tool. In fact, my aunt loathes 5e almost exclusively on the fact that you need to fill out a character sheet yourself instead of having everything you can do filled in and pointed out for you. As opposed to 4e, where ""OMG, you just pick what you want and the system fills in the rest"".    The problem is that we are dealing with D&D 5e now. 5e was released only last year, so would still have some mileage out of hard-copy rulebook sales.  Also, WotC was working on a character generator system with one company but then dropped the company for some reason.    As to other tools, I think some like official map-building exist (I recall seeing something about it on a post from Dragon magazine)"
DnD,3e2jqi,SilverShadow5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:00:47 2015 UTC,"The 4e character builder was great. Character creation, while complex with many different choices, was so greatly simplified. One big, sometimes painful part of character creation or levelling up is first just figuring out what choices you have to make in the first place. When do you get a feat? What powers can you choose? The 4e character builder did all that work for you. All you had to do was make the choices. And it consolidated all the content from the edition and put it at your fingertips.   Many people still use the old offline version and just modify it themselves. You could add custom feats, powers, etc...  I wasn't a fan of when they abandoned the old builder and moved it online though."

That was an amazing product, but we didn't get it until basically the end of AD&D's lifespan. And we've never again had anything half as good as that, at least not from official channels.   4e had done good tools online, but required an ongoing subscription, and now they've stopped supporting it with 5e out."

It was amazing!!!!!!!!! ever since then they have failed when it come to tech.    The PHB should come with a code to download a PDF verision of it. Or heck even a verision that is only viewable based up on your username/password log in.   Same with the MM and DMG.  The MM would be amazing if it had an online companion that you could just bring up in an instant.

DnD,3e2jqi,Gypsy_Cowboy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:27:08 2015 UTC,"I am fairly new BUT, I think that while some people can effectively use tech with D&D to make it better in some way for them; technology is very closely related to video games and the other styles of games that have become more button mashing than thinking out creative problem solving.  In addition to maintaining a separation from video games, this also makes sure that all you need to play D&D is really your imagination. Pencil and paper helps keep track of things, but as it stands now someone who is very set in their way of never having used a computer can still play D&D."

DnD,3e3d89,DeliriousDay1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:21:36 2015 UTC,"Early-Mid Game SPOILERS!  So far I have only had my players get through a modified version of the Lance Rock adventure and the Moving Stones adventure. So I haven't had much of a chance to add a lot yet. However, I have put an NPC teen in the village who is constantly helping out the PCs for tips and then spending the coins to fuel his personal parties. They both love and hate that kid so I ended up using him in the Moving Stones adventure instead of the other kid that was down there.  Other than that I know my players like converting people so I'm working on some more backstory to Sevra and one of my characters is trying to get some land to rule so I'm prepping a side quest to earn the rights to Watergard Keep after they clear it out.  Finally, I have some ideas for other parts of the Dwarven Ruins that I am toying around with. I haven't gotten to flesh those out yet."
DnD,3e3cbr,silver2866,3,Tue Jul 21 17:15:32 2015 UTC,"Check with your dm for how you will be handling ability scores: rolling is the default, but a lot of groups will only count rolls made in front of the group/ dm, to ensure that no one's misinterpreting the rules.  Other groups will prefer not to roll at all (for many different reasons) - in which case you'll need to use either a standard array or point buy.  I think your AC is wrong: scale mail (if I'm remembering right) is 14+ dex mod, to a maximum of +2. Since your dex is 14 or higher, you'd only have a 16 AC. It also gives you disadvantage on dexterity (stealth) checks.  Beyond that: /u/AggressivePoliteGuy mentioned that you can use you dex mod for the shortswords. I didn't catch any other issues.   If you can keep these ability scores, you're probably better off in simple leather armor: it's a lot lighter and would give you the same AC as you have now. Also, no disadvantage on Dexterity (stealth) checks, something you'll want to be good at as a ranger. You can pick up studded leather pretty cheap, which will give you the best AC you can get without magical armor or taking a feat."
DnD,3e3cbr,jmartkdr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:29:52 2015 UTC,"In the last line he said he has a +1 AC for being a ranger, I assume it's from the Defense fighting style."

If I where to play this character I would either pick ranged or two weapon fighting and stick with weapons that let me use my dex mod( finesse weapons) depending on how I felt at the time but play stile is your chose. Being a ranger, you might want to take the survival skill. As it helps with tracking, witch I have used immensely, the last time a played a ranger."
DnD,3e3cbr,AggressivePoliteGuy,2,Tue Jul 21 18:29:54 2015 UTC,"Looks good to me so far, although, shortswords are finesse weapons, which mean you can use your Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of Strength, so it would be a +7 to hit and you would add +5 to the damage.  Also I like to include the modifier directly in the damage for the weapon, so it'd look a little something like this:  Shortsword | +7 | 1d6+5 (p)  It takes the dexterity modifier into account so you can add it at a glance, and the p stands for piercing damage.  Other than that I don't really see anything wrong with it."
DnD,3e3cbr,AggressivePoliteGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:09:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comments /u/aggressivepoliteguy & /u/dezmit I've updated my character to reflect the suggestions.  Question on the damage: I knew to add the modifier to the attack roll, but not the damage. Is that always done with weapons you're proficient with?"
DnD,3e3cbr,Alarien,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:01:51 2015 UTC,"I believe its with all weapons, regardless of proficiency. Say you're attacking with a greatsword but you're not proficient, you would still add your strength mod to the attack roll, but not your proficiency bonus, and you would still add your strength mod to the damage as well.  Spell attacks however don't add your spell modifier to the damage, unless it specifically states in the spell."

I have a similar situation where 2/5 of my PCs are more experienced and are usually the tacticians.

When the see their opinions/ideas matter,m they won't need to be prompted as much.  Also, make sure everyone's characters have long-term non-combat goals they can work on during downtime / social encounters. Goals give direction, which will let players think about how to do what they want to do. If they don't know what they want to do, they'll either sit the encounter out or do random (often disruptive) stuff out of boredom. Don't veto goal ideas unless the dm absolutely has to; they'll probably pick stuff that seems cliche to you but it's all brand new to them."

DnD,3e23mv,Derp_Stevenson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:16:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly your best bet is to figure out what the player likes, or at least seems interested in, in the game.   I'm currently playing with a rather diverse group of players I've always enjoyed complicated combat and clever use of abilities and my group knows this so they kinda let me lead and pop suggestions about what combat maneuvers we should be doing.  On the other hand this specific character has little to no interest in any social... faff... so our cleric and druid do a lot more of the talking, while our rouge causes trouble for me to deal with.   So long story short, try to get them to play their play style if they don't like combat or are really unsure of what to do, a suggestion isn't going to hurt, alternately if they don't really like having to role play maybe try to do more of the talking and take into mind what they have to say.

I understand your apprehension up front, but it's totally doable and requires less effort on your part in terms of preparation since you're DM'ing one campaign instead of two.  1) Start gritty. Keep things like encounters pretty basic at first so as to minimize the need for referencing special snowflake rules and such.  2) Make sure everyone gets some spotlight time. City adventures are a great tool for this since player's tend to divide up in towns depending on who needs what.  3) Up your encounter sizes. Regardless of whether you DM for 4 or 8, something is going to go awry in your initial encounter designs. Be prepared to flex them as you feel out the characters and the overall capabilities of the party. Some things are going to be too easy or too hard, be prepared to beef it up or scale it back on the fly.  4) Put the first adventure on rails a bit. Honestly, bigger groups can be harder to organize, so be prepared to push them forward a bit. I'd bet after their first successful run, they'll start providing you with the direction they want to go - making your prep much simpler. =)  Big groups can be a ton of fun if DM'd well... I'm betting you can do a stellar job, just think things through when you're preparing for the first session. Let the players take it from there."

DnD,3e0voo,lunchboxx1090,3,Tue Jul 21 02:30:49 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head the best way to abuse this (in 3.P) would be to get a chain of casters to use Create Demiplane, Greater, creating planes with the flowing time (double) trait, staggered so that each plane's day starts slightly later than the last plane's day. Then, twice each (actual) day, one player would shift into each of these planes sequentially, catching each plane's morning and emptying all but one coin out of the bag before moving on.  It's hardly game-breaking, especially since Create Demiplane, Greater is a level nine spell, and by that point A) there are better ways to make money fast (multiple ways with Create Demiplane itself) and B) 26 platinum is chump change. But it adds up over time, I guess.  You could even hire NPC casters to create their own planes for greater profits.  A dickish DM with one of these in his party would send his party to the Astral Plane for a little bit, as it has the Timeless trait, effectively preventing the bag from functioning while there."

A family can live comfortably without working on a weaker version, but someone in a similar situation would kill for it. A medium version could support a group, whether a commune that will fall now that it is stolen or a hidden cult where it explains their existence. The most powerful versions would be worth nobles fighting a mass battle over.  For players it is different. If you can't declare ""I wait a year"" in your campaign then anything but the platinum and maybe gold version won't change things. If you can it can theoretically be problematic, especially if your campaign gives significant value to money for items or minions, but it is still unlikely outside the platinum version.  Of course, you are giving a random table to that, which is an extremely 1e/2e/""Old School"" idea. I mean, depending on a roll, the item could literally be worth 1000x as much! That is absolutely a way to play, but not the way I prefer to. I'd rather pick the version that helps tell the story I want, rather than leaving such an important decision to the dice.

One of you guys needs to DM. Some of your players have experience? Let them do it. Or watch a few Chris Perkins games on youtube, do a few rounds of Adventurers League, and you DM.  If you're in the Metroplex check out Order of the Funny Shaped Dice. Or hell, just swing by your LGS."

DnD,3e1gwm,ilikpankaks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:37:59 2015 UTC,"roll20 has a very active /lfg section.  I would recommend hitting up DMs there that have posted games but not yet invited any players.  You could all potentially join a freshly listed game, saving the DM a bit of time looking for enough people.  Although as you've likely already realized, players greatly outnumber DMs."

DnD,3e2xv3,Matt_Sheridan,3,Tue Jul 21 16:24:18 2015 UTC,"Every new edition of D&D has been a reaction to the emergent playstyles and perceived deficiencies of the previous edition.  With 3e, the game's new owner—Wizards of the Coast—revamped things hugely, rationalizing a lot of the weirdnesses of TSR-era D&D (and AD&D) into what was fundamentally a new game. Most importantly, a unified resolution mechanic (that being 1d20 + modifiers vs. a target number) was used for attacks, saving throws, skills, initiative, everything. (Except for damage rolls, that is, which still used all the other dice in the bag.) Non-weapon proficiencies and thief/rogue abilities all became a skill system which every character could use. Lots of 2e's odder restrictions disappeared, too: every PC race could be any class (and could multiclass!), and there were no racial restrictions on level. In general, things became a lot more sensible, and players were given a staggering wealth of character-building options.  D&D 3e was also a really successful game. It brought a hell of a lot of new people to D&D and to RPGs in general. I'd guess that many of these were younger folks than AD&D 2e's fanbase, and they maybe also had more of a background in video games and Magic: The Gathering. So, to a large degree, 3e was played differently than 2e was, and I'd even say differently than its designers expected. 3e was played with a stronger emphasis on combat than 2e was, and as players dove into the edition's rich character options, they found a lot of things to exploit, and also a lot of fundamental imbalances in the system. Most notably, spellcasters—clerics, druids, and wizards in particular—tended to outshine pretty much everybody else, after the early levels of the game, and modern players weren't as forgiving of this kind of disparity as earlier generations might have been.  So 4e was created with that situation in mind: combat and balance were primary concerns in its development, leading to a game with somewhat narrower character-building options and much less asymmetry between character classes, but also a very tactically-deep (if often slow-moving) combat system. It's a great game, honestly, but it was too jarring a change for a lot of folks: characters' abilities functioned more or less the same way regardless of class, most of the mechanics of the game were centered on combat, lots of basic setting lore was reworked, etc. And between a lot of bad marketing decisions by WotC and often a seemingly willful misunderstanding about the way the game was actually played, a lot of people felt kind of betrayed by the whole thing.  In the end, 4e was wrapped up after a very short lifespan. (Which, naturally, lead to people who liked 4e feeling as betrayed as the 3e fans had.) 5e was developed in reaction to people's problems with 4e, and also with a new understanding of the huge diversity of playstyles and preferences among D&D's huge, multi-generational fanbase. So it brought back the class-asymmetry that 4e had smoothed away, increased the focus on non-combat mechanics and that vaguely-defined thing gamers call ""story"", and embraced a really admirable ""It's your game, and you can play it the way you want"" ethic. This means way more power and responsibility is put back in the DM's hands, lots of rules options are presented, and there's technically no default setting for this edition. (While all the adventures WotC is releasing take place in the Forgotten Realms, the core books mention examples from all over D&D's many worlds.)  5e, ultimately, is mechanically a lot like a streamlined 3e, with a style that recalls 2e. It's currently a little bit lacking in character options to fans used to the late-era riches of most previous editions, but it does have a really nice amount of flexibility. The story focus is nice and the ""play it your own way"" ethos is refreshing. Combat isn't as tactically deep as it was in 4e, but it also runs a hell of a lot faster.  I'd definitely recommend that fans of 2e and other earlier editions check out 5e. It's a solid, fun game, and very amenable to running the kinds of adventures you want to run. Finally, the rules are available online for free, so you might as well read 'em for yourself! I think we'd all be interested to hear what you think, too."

Skills have faded in favour of ability checks, treasure feels similar, saving throws also and back to simpler rules.   The classes themselves feel more 3rd Edition and magic is a lot less powerful but more of it. From a game point of view the players are optomising a lot less than 3rd or 4th an making characters for fun!"

I thought I had these down and kept getting tripped up time and time again.  There is neither nature nor dungeoneering and there are several different skills someone could use to search.

As DMing goes, be loose with the rules- 5 is very roleplay intensive and even has mechanics for rewarding RP with Inspiration. Additionally, combats are BRUTAL at level 1 if you balance up to much. In 4 and 3.5 it was easy to get away with CR 1 or even 2 creatures against a level 1 party- now, if your players are new to 5 or even not all that much prepared, combat can drop your party real quick."

DnD,3e1f9c,Baelwolf,3,Tue Jul 21 05:33:35 2015 UTC,"First of all, Play a factotum instead of a rogue, they can do everything a rogue can do and more, plus they are int based and synergize better with swash (which you should never under any circumstances take more than 3 levels in). Secondly, swordsage or not, you may want to invest in a few martial study/stance feats so you can get the shadow blade feat (or whatever it's called; the one that lets you add your dex to damage). Other than that it's pretty much all personal preference. It might also be a good idea to invest in dual wand wielding, spell trigger activation feat (along with the wand grip), and a few metamagics, so when you're useless in some combats you can throw around some max/twined fireballs or whatever from wands.            I like the build factotum 16/swash 3/cleric 1 (for divine defiance/divine counter magic), it's very versatile."
DnD,3e1f9c,A_Dragon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:32:14 2015 UTC,"This will require more reading if I go this route, I have heard of factotum, but I do not know much about them."
DnD,3e1f9c,A_Dragon,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:51 2015 UTC,They are not all that complicated. They are in dungeonscape. There's very little reason to play a rogue when they are available.
DnD,3e1f9c,Dante527,2,Tue Jul 21 16:35:16 2015 UTC,"If you're going to go rogue/swashbuckler, the Daring Outlaw feat from Complete Scoundrel is right up your alley. It lets you stack Rogue/Swashbuckler levels for certain class features of Swashbuckler and Rogue, namely Sneak Attack. You can get it at level 6 if you 3 Rogue/3 Swashbuckler. From there, the level split is to taste, although you're probably better off heavier in Rogue than Swashbuckler. Also, one thing you need to be SURE to do is find someone of being able to sneak attack things that are normally not sneak attackable, whether taking the Penetrating Strike alternate class feature for Rogue, or UMD'ing wands of gravestrike/vinestrike/golemstrike or whatever.   Some other feats that would be good:  Two-weapon Fighting - standard really for SA based builds  Craven - adds your level in damage to sneak attacks. More gravy!  Telling Blow- crits are sneak attacks. use kukris, and either take improved critical or Keen them.  Darkstalker - while not directly related, come endgame you pretty much need this feat to still be able to sneak past the dragons/demons/things-man-was-not-meant-to-know that are par for the course for enemies at that level.   Adding swordsage is going to be a bit tricky. Because of the way ToB multiclassing works, it can often be beneficial to dip a level or two into an initiating class in purely martial builds. Swordsage is wis-based, though, so you'd probably be dipping purely for maneuvers. Are there any maneuvers in particular you're interested in? That would heavily influence when you dip and how many levels."
DnD,3e1f9c,Hallalala,2,Tue Jul 21 07:08:42 2015 UTC,"There's a feat in complete scoundrel called daring outlaw that allows your rogue and swashbuckler levels to stack when determining your sneak attack damage, among other benefits. So with that feat a rogue 4/ swashbuckler 16 has the sneak attack damage of a rogue 20.  Go with a whisper gnome from Races of Stone, start with rogue at 1st level and alternate between rogue and swashbuckler until you hit rogue 4/ swashbuckler 3, then keep taking swashbuckler levels for the rest of your career. Stick to a shortbow at 1st level, since you won't have weapon finesse until 2nd.   Take two flaws from Unearthed Arcana, each one gives you an extra feat at 1st level and they're generally well worth it. Murky-eyed and vulnerable generally have the least impact, but you can use wilderness rogue and get city slicker from Dragon 324 p93 which requires survival as a class skill and gives you a -4 to survival, handle animal, and wild empathy checks. You can also get no time for book learning form that same issue and page, which makes your character illiterate, he can never learn to read or write, and takes a -4 to all knowledge skill checks except for nature. There's also love of nature in that same issue and page, you must make a DC 12 will save when trying to attack any animal, plant, or vermin, failing the save causes you to lose your action, and those creatures can still attack you without penalty.   Feats should be silencing strike, craven, and magic in the blood (1st), two-weapon fighting (3rd), daring outlaw (6th), improved two-weapon fighting (9th), darkstalker (12th), greater two-weapon fighting (15th), and deadly precision (18th). Craven is in Champions of Ruin, you take a -2 to saves vs fear effects but your sneak attacks deal an extra +1 damage per character level. Magic in the blood is in Player's Guide to Faerun, it makes all of your 1/day racial spell-like abilities usable 3/day instead. Silencing strike is in Races of Stone, it allows you to completely screw enemy spellcasters, guards who would raise an alarm, etc. Darkstalker is in Lords of Madness, and it makes it so opponents using scent, blindsight, blindsense, tremorsense, etc. must still make a spot/listen check to notice you when you're sneaking.  If you want to use swordsage, then you should completely drop both swashbuckler and rogue and maybe pick up a level of spellthief to get trapfinding if you need it, and just stick to swordsage for your whole career. A single level of spellthief allows you to use wands of any sorcerer/wizard spells of the schools that the class gets access to, even if you can't cast spells with that class yet.  An alternative means of using swordsage is extremely cheesy. It involves using the feat rogue variant from Unearthed Arcana along with swashbuckler 3 and two levels of swordsage. Your second stance you gain from swordsage is assassin's stance, which gives you 2d6 sneak attack, fulfilling the prerequisites for daring outlaw. Once you have daring outlaw, you gain the sneak attack of a standard rogue of a level equal to your feat rogue + swashbuckler levels. So for example, a feat rogue 4/ swashbuckler 3/ swordsage 2/ feat rogue 11 would have the sneak attack of a rogue 18 (plus an extra 2d6 with assassin's stance) and the bonus feats of a fighter 15. As I said, it's extremely cheesy and not likely to be allowed in most games, but it's not like this even breaks you out of the tier-3 power level. I wouldn't recommend this for starting at 1st level anyway."
DnD,3e1f9c,Hallalala,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:54:09 2015 UTC,Thank you this is exactly what I needed. I think I will avoid the alternate cheese route as you put it :-). /u/A_Dragon mentioned the factotum route. Your thoughts??

DnD,3dzf1u,redkat85,2,Mon Jul 20 20:40:56 2015 UTC,"On a somewhat related note: a year ago I too was looking around for a puzzle to throw at players, when I came across this image: http://slyflourish.com/images/jenga_heroes.jpg I knew then I had to have a room where all there was was a large central stone block tower with a door on the ceiling as the exit. I drew various runes on the ends of each block, some matched, caused some to move and shift, etc. I won't go into detail of the mechanics of it but man did it create a tense situation to get out of the room. They also fought monsters at the same time. Many stone blocks fell and almost crushed a player.   So my addition to you all is, if you can't find a puzzle to use, use a puzzle game as THE encounter."
DnD,3dzf1u,ElSurge,2,Mon Jul 20 23:23:13 2015 UTC,I ran a game and used this https://www.vat19.com/item/khet-laser-game-2 it worked wonderfully.

DnD,3dzf1u,Thuxle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:41:54 2015 UTC,"It requires more prep, but having extra hints or handouts for players with high mental skills really pushes this. So for reassembling the statue, you can hand a high Int character a handout with a partial complete version that only they get to see. Same thing with a cryptic message that needs to be translated from a non-Common script. Give the player who took Languages or otherwise high Int, and give them a key, or partially translated version.  For the labyrinth minigame, you could use a simple mechanic like a navigation or perception check divided by 5, turn over that many tiles and choose the one you want to represent your turn, flipping the others back over. Characters who optimized for Wisdom shine and turn the maze into a walk, outweighing the player who has a great memory for tiles, but didn't put in the skills."
DnD,3dzf1u,redkat85,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:10 2015 UTC,Those are some great ideas. They also jogged my memory of how some other games have done it. In particular Mansions of Madness.  In that game they have an INT score that determines the number of moves they can make on a puzzle per turn. I think something similar based on the INT modifier could be used in D&D very easily.

DnD,3dzf1u,Thuxle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:25:59 2015 UTC,"I have no idea how to do it, I'm just an idea man!  So a polarized screen has slits that only allow light/colors to pass through in a certain fashion. If you use two polarized screens you can completely block out light.  People use polarization in sunglasses or on their monitors. THey've been known to make monitors that are only viewable to the person who has the polarized glasses for them.  Imagine if you took two polarized monocles, scrying glasses or whatever and you could only see what was on a tablet screen/computer monitor when you had the correct two.  Another way to do it without polarization would be to use color screening. If you have a field of dots in multiple colors you would need the correct color screen to remove the inconsequential color dots and reveal the actual pattern thats undearneath."
DnD,3e2nnz,MinervasRaider,4,Tue Jul 21 14:16:05 2015 UTC,"I tell you this with 30+ years of watching groups form and collapse and reform and all the like.  Add new players one at a time. This will allow your existing group to not feel overwhelmed by a flood of new players and the new players will be able to acclimate better to your existing group's style.  After a few weeks, add in the next player.  This next part is very important. If your current players are all good together (there's no fighting among them), then if any new player joining in isn't like by a single existing player, then the new player is rejected.  Some people will say ""take a vote and majority"" rules but you should reject that.  When a new player comes in and an existing player doesn't like him,  but you keep the new player, you risk losing your existing solid player for an unknown player.  And finally, the DM should set the limit on the total number of players he's comfortable running. If the DM starts feeling stressed, you put a hold on the number of players until there's an opening or the DM is ready for more."

However I like the idea of introducing 1 new player at a time, with a few weeks between adding the next player. I'll probably set my max at 6, and talk with the group, get more of their advice and let them know this is what I plan on doing.  Nobody fights yet other than in-character discussions/arguments, but it makes sense because one is a devious tiefling sorcerer and the other a stalwart dwarven cleric haha.

DnD,3e2nnz,Holythius,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:08:21 2015 UTC,You don't have to take on new people just because your party has a good thing going and word is spreading. People will always want to join the campaign that has a good dynamic and an interesting storyline. The more people you add just to not exclude anyone the quicker I can turn downhill if let uncheck. The cohesion can get diluted and there can be too many sideplots.  I noticed whenever I had more than 4 players at least one would run off in the attempt to get more time then the others since each person on average had less spotlight time. I usually would resolve it by intentionally giving the solo time a fifth or less of the attention. It usually fixed the issue.

Obviously, there are more voices to listen to, and there are more characters to try and appease.  While you could probably handle 1 more quite easily from what I can see (up to a player group of 5), it might be unfair to pick just 1 of the possible wannabe joiners and have to tell the rest no.  Simply put; The easiest thing here is to say that you are comfortable with your 4-man party, and cannot handle anymore - It's the safest bet.   As surely you don't want to ruin the good thing that you have going, right?"
DnD,3e0iip,Frinckles,3,Tue Jul 21 00:43:49 2015 UTC,"First of all, I do not see where it mentions how long a normal session lasts.  With my group the amount of content you have currently is probably about 2 hours worth of content at the most for them.  However, my players normally do not stop and smell every rose or tip over every barrel.    I think you are on the right track with your outline, but leave some space for randomness.  A PC will eventually break through your episode and you have the choice of either railroading back on track (I generally avoid this) or having the opportunity to be creative with the randomness the party brings (I reward this).    When I prepare for a session I have list of high points that I want to complete eventually.  I don't put them in any order, and I pick and choose what I want based upon how well it will fit. Sometimes I don't even need the list because the party has found something else to do that I am running with.  For  you, I would see this list as 1 event.  I suggest coming up with 2 or 3 more just in case. Whatever you don't use can always wait until next time. :)"
DnD,3e0iip,jetset314,2,Tue Jul 21 00:55:48 2015 UTC,"Awesome advice. I was actually prompted to ask this question because  of the thread /r/thuhnc created.  Plot derailment is something I feel like I can handle as far as creating new encounters, but I feel like it's also a ""Give then an inch, they'll take a mile"" type of thing. One good perk about the campaign I'm doing right now though is that it takes place mostly on the ocean. Not many other places to go except wherever you row. Thanks again for the reply."
DnD,3e0iip,jetset314,3,Tue Jul 21 01:04:45 2015 UTC,"Give them the mile, and they'll love you for it.  Let them make it their own, within reason.  You will learn that whatever you plan they are going to surprise you, and as long as you are quick on your feet they will see it as planned and they will sing your praises.    Also, wherever they row? Give them some sails, man! Pirate campaigns are a TON of fun, and the fact that a boat can go ANYWHERE makes introducing new content so much easier."
DnD,3e0iip,jetset314,2,Tue Jul 21 01:25:59 2015 UTC,"Haha, they have sails -- somewhat. Just not total control over them until later on in the campaign. I'm super excited to introduce different content given an ocean setting. For what it's worth, other ""Missions"" I have laid out include everything from coastal Arabic cities, a Dragonturtle's lair, a few ship battles and even closing a portal at the bottom of the sea to stop Dagon. :P I'll just brace myself to for when the surprises happen to me, improvisation is something I'll need to be more comfortable with and If I do, I think it will be an awesome campaign."
DnD,3e0iip,Not-Jim-Belushi,2,Tue Jul 21 01:32:11 2015 UTC,"Well, for what it's worth it sounds like you've got an awesome start for an awesome campaign.  Good luck to you!"
DnD,3e0iip,MCPawprints,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:36:35 2015 UTC,"I think you're prepping just a little too much. As it is your story structure is a little rigid, not allowing much room for player choices. A good tip when you're coming up with something like this is break it down to its base component, ""The party is tasked with getting a superweapon out of the antagonist's hands"" then jot down a couple notes about what might happen (they're attacked by winged sharks, the ship they're infiltrating gets attacked while they're on it, the captain is a player's sibling) but don't tie yourself down to anything. Let the players guide the story and if an idea you like doesn't make it into this plot, rework it and put it in your next.  If you haven't already, watch some of Chris Perkins DMing and take some inspiration from him. He plays off of his player characters and improvises a whole lot. Improvising is definitely scary at first, but once you get the hang of it you and your players will be thankful"
DnD,3e2mkj,Keyesb7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:06:58 2015 UTC,"This sounds like a good idea if you have multiple NPCs with classes and complicated combat. Keeps the encounter flowing smoothly and quickly for the players, and they still get to be invested in what the NPCs are doing. My only question is once a player decides to help an NPC, would they be thrown into initiative? I'm just thinking that if the NPCs all start doing badly it'll be a situation where your players will be focused on helping them too much and you'll be in the same place you previously were."
DnD,3e2mkj,MinervasRaider,2,Tue Jul 21 14:21:57 2015 UTC,"NPCs are never the stars of the game. They may affect the game in some way, but should never get in the way of the glory of the party.

DnD,3e2mkj,Brainfried,2,Tue Jul 21 14:31:05 2015 UTC,But as a DM I like the feeling of tough NPC allies accompanying the adventures in big battles.  Also sometimes when the players use the characters they meta them into benefiting the group.   Don't. DMPCs take up time in combat and steal the spotlight from the PCs. The only time you should do this is when you want an insanely powerful monster to swallow Awesome McPecs and his legendary sword so that you can telegraph to the party that they should flee from the encounter.
DnD,3e2mkj,thomar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:38:51 2015 UTC,I wonder if you could spend the time that would go into pre-planning NPCs to help the PCs you could put it into making the enemies a big tougher so the players may wish they had a helping hand but they need to find a way to deal with it themselves.   Also this may not have to do with anything.... but if you are not doing a high level of details to explain the cave they are in or the keep or foe even increasing the level may indeed help.

Just keep in mind that you wont have random generator rolls, fancy macros, or auto-fill character sheets, you have the same tools you have at a real table (plus some additional sandbox stuff for manipulating physics and so on)  I don't know what you prefer for your games, but attendance went way up when we started using table top sim and everyone has said its much nicer to actually roll your dice, move your pieces, and (with some time and dedication) create full 3D dungeons and towns to play in.  Of course you can also go the traditional route and just upload a map onto the table using Google or just draw everything, its ultimately up to you."

DnD,3e19s1,tecrogue,3,Tue Jul 21 04:55:06 2015 UTC,"Not entirely, setting up a table in tabletop sim basically entails opening your menu, spawning some dice, spawning some player pieces, and then setting a table background with a link you copy pasted from google.  Interacting with it and playing on it is much more intuitive and simple, as its just a 3d environment no different than using noclip in gmod and moving things with the click of a mouse.  Of course, if your game requires you to do complicated math on the fly, or you want everyone's character sheets to be on the table, it gets a bit more complicated, but only as far as opening calculator.exe and finding a way to get pictures of everyone's character sheets and uploading them to imgur."

DnD,3dysj7,JHawkInc,3,Mon Jul 20 17:11:53 2015 UTC,"This line of thinking is also incidentally why I generally prefer systems that have fewer direct couplings between fluff and crunch. As much fun as roleplaying is, at its heart it's also a game, and with that comes gameplay styles that some prefer or dislike. If you really like the mechanics and playstyle of a certain class it can be frustrating to have some seriously baked in RP requirements/fluff shackles. As an example, I typically really enjoy the playstyle of the Fey-pact style Warlock. I like charismatic characters, I like charming and illusionary magic, and I like not having prepared magic (Wizard or Cleric style). In 5e I also really like the invocation system. However, I really find the whole ""Sold your soul for quick power"" gimmick to be really tiresome, especially if you've played that way before. It especially doesn't really jive all that well when it actually takes you just as long to get stronger as a wizard, a cleric, a sorcerer, or any other class.   5e does a better job overall with this than a lot of the stuff in 3e (IMO anyway), and 4e had almost zero hardline enforced fluff connections. I love being able to reflavor the mechanics of a profession, or play that profession in a different way than expected."

His class? Barbarian. Background in entertainment, he had enough basic skills to fit his job, but in combat he was a straight up barbarian. Long term goal of getting to tell the great stories, maybe witnessing heroes first hand, being the famous bard/storyteller that is known throughout the realm, just as likely he'd end up being that hero.

You will definitely be at a disadvantage, though.  Healers are probably the least required class role (Aside from whatever rogues/bards do), so you should be fine. You may want to force your Ranger into melee; they have a d10 hit die, so they're just as good as a fighter would be as the party tank, people just don't think of the class that way for some reason. He'll help relieve the monk in melee (unsure on whether your Rogue is melee or ranged) and even has a few token healing spells, so he can server as both the party's tank and healer.  If in doubt, have a bard. They have a stigma, but they combine the benefits of an sorcerer (arcane spells/Spell Knowledge), cleric (healing spells), and fighter (Extra Attack) into one class, along with an impressive amount of skills. They're not as good as any of the above, but they're a decent class in their own right."
DnD,3e1ldc,Drewfro666,3,Tue Jul 21 07:13:34 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Depends on the DM, but healers are always good.  Look at it this way: that Wizard's flesh looks awfully soft. At level 1, a dagger in the ribs could be enough to put him down, if caught by surprise. If only there were someone to save his life, or properly defend him...  That said, it really depends on the campaign you're playing in and the DM running it.  Most DMs are forgiving enough that traditional roles, like those found in RPGs, aren't necessary. ""Combat is a formality,"" a fictionalized version of one of these DMs might say. I've found that these are by far the most common types of DMs. For them, story takes precedent over all, and that is perfectly fine. However, other DMs relish the combat aspects of tabletop games (remember, these are still games) and balance their encounters for difficulty. In these types of campaigns, you have to be prepared, both in character and out. This is also perfectly fine, though these DMs are rarer.  These roles didn't arise arbitrarily; they came to be because they make sense. In a 4-man group, having one guy to take the hits, one guy to heal wounds, one guy for manipulating the battlefield, and one guy to do the stabbing is optimal for just about any situation. Only 3 guys? Drop the stabber or manipulator. 5 guys? Another stabber couldn't hurt (the party).  Like I said earlier, it all depends on your DM. Regardless, having a healer is always very useful, and in D&D, healers are rarely boring. 3.5E Clerics were the most broken class in the game, beating every class at their own game in the higher levels. They could (and still can, although in much more manageable numbers) summon monsters, enhance their own physical strength, summon forth elemental bolts, and sap life energy with necromantic power."

DnD,3e1ldc,Fiat_Goose,2,Tue Jul 21 07:49:01 2015 UTC,"I don't honestly believe that tank is an existing type of role in D&D.  If you are engaged in melee, then you are already attracting a majority of attacks towards you.  If multiple people are engaged in melee, then the enemies may split their attacks (I typically have enemies split evenly between melee targets unless one guy looks particularly tough and needs extra effort to wipe out.)  So, consider it being less of a tank roll and more of a melee roll.  The more people you have in a melee, the less enemies there are rushing straight at your weak spellcasters.  Two characters armed with sword and shield can cover 30 feet of space between them, creating a large barrier that your enemies have to risk running through in order to get to your back line.  As far as your party is concerned, monks and rangers aren't the most resilient of characters, but they can smash heads up close and personal just fine.  The ranger opens up with volleys of arrows before the enemy reaches the party, and then engages in melee once the enemy is within charging distance.  The rogue acts as a skirmisher, able to dash around the battle and empty arrows into engaged targets or dart in and out with a lunging stab.  The wizard is likely taking cover and making use of distance to keep a gap between them and any potential melee opponents."

This is fortunate because monks don't have to trade damage for procection like barbarians do because they are based on the same attribute. Might want him to take the toughness feat as well later on. Seems like a solid enough party. Any of the other players can take the medicine feat and be able to heal the party between fights. I wouldn't exactly tank with the monk, but he can draw aggro and evade for the rest of the party as well as deal out a really good amount damage."

We've had to struggle in some encounters, but we're all alive so far, and luckily we have classes that can grow to fill those roles down the line (bard and druid)."

Maybe during the night as they sleep in the inn or at their camp a vampire attempts to feed on a player( this can be great if he gets infected and has to find a cure)  Maybe one villager is immune to the spell and wants the PCs to get his family out of the town.

Not a derail of the campaign, but once the party was sleeping in an underground tunnel.  DM had them wake up to hear rumbling (he had a purple worm on the way).

DnD,3dzup8,Krazen,7,Tue Jul 21 02:17:23 2015 UTC,"Yesterday, my Fifth Edition campaign imploded.  The PCs were working for an organization known as ""The Gauntlet"", a paramilitary secret-world-police-type-thing that sent them to various locations to diffuse potential threats to the continued existence of the multiverse and deal with those that have already been set in motion.  They knew that sometimes the Gauntlet did some shady shit, but nothing had really come of it. Until yesterday.  Several days into their investigation of a maddening robot-plague afflicting a nation of Warforged, they came upon a delegation from the Azure Fist, a nigh-ubiquitous mercenary company, and the Gauntlet's arch-enemy (the Gauntlet was actually formed by a founder of the Azure Fist, specifically to undercut their machinations).  The PCs killed the grunts and captured the leader, Arayah Polaris, who was the daughter of one of the PCs from an old 4E game where we played as members of the Azure Fist during its glory days-- that game was the basis for much of the story and history of this game.  Their intent was to get Arayah to forsake the Azure Fist and join the Gauntlet, arguing that the Azure Fist was no longer honorable and the Gauntlet was a better force for good. Arayah refused, on the basis of their basically being terrorists (they assassinated the king of a prominent nation, like, a couple weeks ago in-game), having just murdered two of her friends and allies for seemingly no reason, and her claim that the Gauntlet killed her father.  Suddenly, Dro'Hagan, the gnomish founder of the Gauntlet (he was, like, 800 years old), appeared from behind the tree Arayah was tied to along with two Gauntlet guardsmen and commended the party on having captured a prominent member of the Azure Fist, saying he'd take her back to Gauntlet HQ and interrogate her. One of the PCs, his faith in the Gauntlet evidently shaken by Arayah's words, asked Dro'Hagan if it was the Gauntlet that killed her father. Dro'Hagan's response was, basically, ""Don't worry about it.""  As Dro'Hagan and his guards were leading Arayah away, one of the players stabbed and killed one of the guards (because it literally used the level 1 guard stat block, and they were all level 6). Another player killed the other one. An army of Gauntlet knights appeared around them, as Dro'Hagan exclaimed, ""what the actual fuck?""  One player remained loyal to the Gauntlet, while in the ensuing chase one of the others was captured and the other escaped into the sky using a potion of mist form. Party is now totally, irrevocably split. I had not planned for any of this shit.  The player who escaped fled east, to the desert nation, where he took refuge in a port city. He had 3 magic amulets with him, that were part of a side quest to gather six cursed amulets that provide crazy stat boosts in each of the six attributes but drive you crazy and, if all worn at once, would make you into a physical god.  He decided to put them all on.  So, basically, now this campaign is totally broken. The captured character got executed for his crimes, and the remaining Gauntlet character was put in charge of a strike team to capture/kill the rogue character.  In lieu of playing this out any further, I just described how this situation resolved. The demigod player killed all of the Gauntlet members sent after him, as any other people he drew to his cause were slaughtered in droves by his assailants. After about a month of him traveling through the eastern continents leaving a trail of mangled bodies, friend and foe alike, in his wake, he made his way back west, and killed the heads of the Gauntlet in a bloody rage.  The Gauntlet was vulnerable anyway, because they were busy dealing with the other physical god that was summoned by the cult that caused the plague, which the players completely abandoned in favor of fighting the Gauntlet.  By that point, the only person who could even touch the god was the player with the amulets, who had by then collected all six of them. He struck down the immaculate golden god the cult had built, and then set about cleansing the world of its impurities in a mad inquisition of blood and fire.  The worst part is, they were probably going to turn against the Gauntlet later, anyway. They were going to meet an anti-Gauntlet organization, comprised of old villains they'd fought, and led by their old mentor/commander who led them when they first joined the Gauntlet. After they dealt with the imminent robot apocalypse, which they never got around to in the actual chain of events.  So, now this epic campaign in a world that we've all spent the better part of two years building together has completely collapsed, and ended with the world being plunged into abject chaos. Maybe I could've handled it better, but that's how I decided it'd play out at the time.  It was still kind of awesome, though.  TL;DR: Something unexpected happened, and brought about, like, three simultaneous apocalypses."
DnD,3dzup8,b3nzay,4,Mon Jul 20 22:17:55 2015 UTC,"??? How did you not expect them to turn against the gauntlet after they're basically dragging away the daughter of one of their former characters?"""
DnD,3dzup8,beta_eight,4,Tue Jul 21 01:28:09 2015 UTC,"Because they were playing completely different characters, utterly unaffiliated with the Azure Fist. Their old characters were ancient heroes who lived, like, hundreds of years ago (the old PC in question was an elf, which is why his daughter is still alive).  Also, she was kind of a self-righteous bitch.  Also-also, they murdered a king two weeks ago, so it's a little weird that regicide is okay but kidnapping is wrong."

No one else in the party knew how scummy of a person I was, until the party was split in half. One of the party members (a giant, hulking trandoshan scoundrel) was hired to kidnap me and turn me into a corporation known as adascorp. He kidnaps me with the help of another member.   Then things get out of hand.   I mind control him, put handcuffs on the other member,  then go to nar shaddaa and sell the handcuffed one into slavery. I bought a slave collar for the trandoshan and five competent mercenaries.for the day that he's mind controlled, I took him and his ship and fled to a agricultural planet which my GM hastily created, dubbed ""Karona"". On Karona, I make a deal with the corporation controlling the spaceport (Czerka) to stage a coup and take over as ruler of the planet.   A session that was supposed to be based around collecting money from a bank heist completed the last session turned into my quest for planetary conquest, and everyone loved it."

DnD,3dzup8,baal4710,3,Mon Jul 20 22:27:12 2015 UTC,"We'd finally made it. It had taken over a years worth of in game travel to get there, but we made it to the lair of the bare bear ninjas (insert bear pun (bear with me here)). Our assassin had been taken captive. Our negotiator had been taken captive. Our monk was separated from the party, lost in the wilderness. The only two who were free to act were my thief and his apprentice. The door was currently unguarded, which allowed me to slowly creep over and enact my plans...  I then proceeded to write a passive aggressive letter, pinned it to their door and walked away. The note I left on their door simply read ""Please stop killing the townsfolk, Thanks."" I took the entire year long trip back to our quest hub, never rescued those PCs (they returned my message, along with the statement that they had eaten the captured PCs and were still terrorising the nearby towns). Even stole the party boat, leaving them stranded on a largely unexplored continent.   Before judging me on this, I was new to pen and paper gaming, it was a comedy heavy campaign and most of the PCs I left behind had already stopped showing up when I abandoned them. After we'd restocked on players and discovered the main plot back in our home country, we eventually had to go back to the bare bear ninjas, to collect the final maguffin of the set. It was supposed to be the first maguffin until I ignored it. So plot wasn't derailed, it just took diversion.   Edit: Just remembered another plot derailment of magnitude that the campaign was scrapped afterwards. When playing as the only true good character in a party of largely evil, I ended up discovering they had plans my inquisitor character would consider evil. After realising I couldn't persuade them away from using a vault of demonic artefacts I needed to destroy, and not having the muscle to back up my argument I sealed all the entrances while they were looting the place. Cut all the rope ladders, poured alchemical fire down all the climbing holes, and rolled large rocks over the only truly usable exit. Which was also at the top of a rope I cut.  Again, I realise this was kind of a dick move.  That session is my reason for arguing against opposite alignments within a party. At the time though, my GM was enjoying the idea, the other party members weren't yet worried out of character, and I realised the only other options were to cross my faith, or let them kill me. Essentially, nobody expected the hobbit inquisition to jump out and derail everything."

""Oh, if only somebody could unite the five maguffins of maguffland, and defeat the evil army of badness! But alas, the furthest maguffin is a years travel away, protected by bare bear ninjas, in the far east.""

DnD,3dzup8,sstripwire,3,Mon Jul 20 23:30:37 2015 UTC,"Basically the DM had a whole dungeon planned out and at the end we would have fought a shadowdancer BBEG, but unfortunately he didn't see the possibility of us being bad at rolling. So when we went outiside of the castle for one second where a dire wolf was waiting(this was at level 1), we all rolled miserably and died to it.  However, the necromancers inside the castle brought us back to life to work for them, after ridding us of all good inside of us. So, we went up to the upper levels of the castle where we found many chests and decided to attempt to open them.  The first chest we opened was trapped with a blinding spell that lasted a day and a half, and since we all failed our wisdom checks, we continuously opened it until eventually one of us didn't close the lid as we fell over. Inside all we found was a diary. Useless. Then there was a closet which had the same blinding spell, and we all fell for it again.  By then, a month had passed since we had initially left the town to go to the castle, most of it spent blind, and we decided to go back to the town. When we finally reached the town, after suffering an attack from an archer that should have been easily killed, but managed to wound us enough so we gave up and ran, we decided that we would try to steal the most valuable item that the blacksmith had, and if that failed, that we would kill him quickly and easily(Right...).  We went out and bought a black square of cloth to cover the window so that no one could see as we killed him, if need be and decided that we were prepared to try this feat. As we entered we already looked suspicious due to a member of our party ""casually"" strolling over to the window holding the black cloth. Our rogue attempted to use his amazing skills at bluffing to get the blacksmith to place the object on the counter, but failed so we put into motion our swift kill plan.  Our Cleric(who had the best weapons and strength) walked up to him as we held the door shut and blocked the window and went in for the kill. Of course, he failed his initiative roll so the blacksmith had time to pull out a great sword and swing at our cleric. That critically hits, taking most of our cleric's health and our cleric goes to attack and misses. The blacksmith swings again and knocks him unconscious and goes after the guy blocking the window. The Rogue sneaks out the door and goes to the police attempting to convince them that the blacksmith has gone crazy and is killing people, and misses the DC by one, so the police follow him to the blacksmith's to see the blacksmith with a bloody great sword over two unconscious bodies. The Blacksmith explains himself and the rogue gets arrested.  The rogue then tries to escape using his open lock skill, but critically fails it calling the attention of the guards who swiftly end his life."

The party was summoned to High Lord So and So's castle and presented with a terrible tale of woe and disaster.  Monsters were terrorizing the townsfolk, running wild in the forests outside the city walls.  Please, oh please, won't you help us?

How would we, its big""  Other member: ""well i have this grenade...."" dangling it by the pin Jim: grabs grenade and throws it ""lets git outta here bitches!""

DnD,3dzup8,Frinckles,3,Tue Jul 21 01:46:20 2015 UTC,"So... This was my Sunday session.  We go to a sky pirates fortified jail (They over-ran it.), and as the group prepped the ship, the rogue took invisibility on himself, and infiltrated the compound solo at night.  He goes through the movements, sneaking by and climbs the anchor within the compound that held the pirates sky ship to the compound so it didn't float off.   So, he climbs with much difficulty up the sky ship, then kills the pirate sharp-shooter upon the ship. After killing him (As he was an assassin, and round 1 surprise is really good.), he set up some explosives on the ship (Mind you, I gave these several sessions ago.) and he cut the anchor, and rammed the ship into the ship.   A explosion happens, the pirates basically are wrecked by it, due to the size and how close it was, while the rogue succeeds the DC 20 dex save, and of-course, because of evasion, he takes no damage.  The thing is... They were suppose to get a map, but now that the fortress is basically destroyed, the map is either destroyed or wrecked beyond compression.   This isn't worrisome... No, it isn't. There was a dragon they could rescue within the compound that would inform them of the location that the map is. But, nope, now that isn't possible as-well, seeing the fact that the rogue, after destroying the main building of this prison jumped into the hole that was created by the bombs. It fell to the lower levels where the sewers, and thus the dragon is.   So, he jumps down, sees the dragon and says, ""I jump on the dragon."" I nod, alright... The dragon says his speal, ""Thank you blah blah blah..."" And he says, ""I stab the dragon.""  He puts up a fair fight, but dies. Almost got away too, but as he was escaping, he was clawed, downed, then swept away by the sewer water where he drowned in the adjacent river.  So congrats, now a player is dead, the dragon won't trust the next party to come (Especially since this dragon took a beating by this rogue, and this party is really famous) and the sky-pirates (And cult of the dragon) still has a 100000 gold piece bounty on the party."
DnD,3dzup8,Frinckles,3,Tue Jul 21 02:03:04 2015 UTC,"I had players derail a plot that they themselves (unknowingly) placed the rails for.  I like to pick a few key events that should happen in a session, then let them happen based on the actions of the players. If they're going to find certain information to go forward, I give it to them after appropriate effort, regardless of what they do. They get to do what they want, I get my story, and neither gets in the other's way, and ultimately they blend together nicely.  So I had some players basically decide ""X is what we need to do next"", and when they got there, they were going to find some bad guys, and ultimately it was going to point them forward. Then they didn't go there. And everything they did was in broad daylight where they wouldn't encounter the bad guys. They did a lot of investigating (both in the area, looking for a trace of these bad guys, and studying objects recovered from a previous encounter), and learned a lot of useful information (some of which I had to make up on the fly, and jot down notes so I could adapt it in later anywhere it would be relevant), and our session ended before they found the dudes. And at that point in time, they'd split up, so I was prepared to split up the bad guys and have the split party groups both find some bad guys so they could all end up in the same place in short order.  tl;dr DM paves path around player's actions, players act to build path, then immediately deviate from that path at a 90 degree angle."

Everyone started grabbing soil and wondering about the crops they could plant on the village's farmland. Our group plays for fun mostly, so the first half of the adventure was a quickly-constructed farming mini-game, where each player had to choose their crop, till the soil, sow, maintain, fertilize and water their crops, rolling for some things and using knowledge for others, in order to maximize their yields  In the end Daggertooth the halfling rogue won the competition with his prize crop of tomatoes, and the group happily went on to  investigate the town, and discover that they'd been hired as sacrifices rather than guards for the festival and subsequently nearly die in their desperate escape."

Long story short, our acting DM decided to allow it so we could move on. We had been talking about it for about a half an hour at this point, and a shorter tempered friend of ours was getting worked up xD  We continued down the caves until we were face to face with some element of the story, cant quite remember. At this point our ""wizerd"" decided to equip his rat with a sword so he could go join the fight. This launched our group into a heated debate over whether or not the rat could be smart enough to fight.  It was at this point our hot-headed friend flipped the table and sent the board and dice flying. Never did get our d20 out from behind the deep freeze in the garage :<  Still though, its funny to think that a game like this can get you to think and act so creatively.

DnD,3dzup8,that_blind_panda,2,Tue Jul 21 05:31:09 2015 UTC,"The very first time I ever played true Dungeons and Dragons, I was a freshman in highschool and I was playing with seniors. Keep in mind these seniors were also veteran Dungeons and Dragons players and a very close tight knit group of friends.  Well we were playing 4th edition because it was relatively new and the DM had mentioned that he wanted to try it out.  Our party consisted of ""homo habulous"" our Elastin Warlock, ""Ritchard"" The Paladin of light, ""Oscar"" The Human warlord and ""Wilkas"" The half-elf Fighter.  Plot derailment was common for us, however one particular quest in the campaign solve the most plot derailment, as well as the Dungeon Masters hilarious attempt to punish one of our PC's.  Most of the time whenever the plot was derailed it was always by Oscar's hand. To let me set the scene:  Our party was making its way outside of the town of good heart a strange otherworldly faytown dominated by a radical religious pastor. Who looked oddly like Joel Olsteen, after slaying said Joel Olsteen psychopath the party was making its way towards the next large hub when they got lost in an enchanted road.  See Oscar got us lost whilst we were on the road he heard something he believed was beautiful that within the woods surrounding the road who's the beautiful fairy queen. In true Oscar fashion he dashed into the forest to find his next lady love, we followed which was a horrible idea for us all.  Not long after we had found said fairy queen but Oscar was not with us. In his search he got separated purposefully believing that we would never find this fairy queen and if we did he would find her first. Now our Dungeon Master tried multiple times to redirect Oscar towards the actual goal to which he replied ""Fairy Queen!!"" Again and a again; finally our DM had enough and painted a wonderful scene... For the rest of us to enjoy.  Oscar, with all his shouting and calling, awoke a slumbering Griffin and was trespassing in its territory. Now the Griffin came swooping down and in an attempt to spare himself from slaying the creature our Warlord tossed anything he could grab hold of within his pack.  Finally one such item hit its mark, however it wasn't sleeping powder or any such item but a trinket our DM had cooked up a few sessions ago and our friend Oscar forgot it's effect. The item was the ""Stones of Corellon"" Which when broke cast charm automatically on whom ever it was used.  The item was meant to be used for political intrigue and as a bargaining chip once we made it into the trading hub, but it served much better use here. The Griffin failed the Save against the charm (Coincidentally) and pounced upon our Warlord, who also failed his Save (Thankfully) mistaking him for a Female Griffin you can use your imagination.  From that point on when Oscar's antics began to take too much from the narrative the call of a Griffin could be heard not far.  Edit Damn mobile posting before I'm done."

DnD,3e16u4,Smitikus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:16:52 2015 UTC,I give my group a 10-15min break every 2 hours or so. The adverage session for us is ~4 hours so that give enough time for a break in the middle and time to clean up at the end.
DnD,3e16u4,Drewfro666,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:25:23 2015 UTC,"Take breaks often. Scheduled breaks would be even better.  Play music. Shitty faux-fantasy music is alright, but try playing actual music, or Final Fantasy soundtracks or something. LotR scores and celtic music is mellow and those generic ""Electronic fantasy music mixes"" on youtube are pretty good, but nothing really beats Final Fantasy.  Though it sounds a little funny, make sure your players are eating and drinking a lot of water. Hungry, dehydrated players are no fun.  Don't let shit drag on. A single conversation should ideally take only a few minutes maximum; if your players (or you) tend to drawl on, ask for a check and move on, and be adamant that you cannot argue yourself out of a failed social check after it is rolled. If combat is dragging on, do whatever you can to speed it up; take average on damage rolls, write down your players' ACs so you don't have to ask, move around monsters in the initiative order somewhat (Never in a way that hurts characters who rely on high initiatives, like assassins) to put monsters into groups, so you can roll more attacks at once (which generally speeds up combat)."

DnD,3e128k,Drewfro666,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:32:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is underpowered, you just have to look a little deeper into their mechanics. At level 1 monks get the Martial Arts class ability which lets them make an additional unarmed attack a round as a bonus action. This essentially means that they can dual wield at 1d4+dex at level 1. Add onto this that they can use monk weapons instead of the 1d4 damage. For instance, at level 1 a monk can attack with a great club at 1d8+dex and then make an unarmed attack at 1d4+dex. This is pretty much on par with a dual wielding fighter or rogue. In addition to this monks get ki at level 2 and can start doing flurry of blows. By spending a ki point they can do 2 unarmed attacks as a bonus action instead of 1. So at 2 level you can do 1d8+dex, 1d4+dex, 1d4+dex as a full attack that uses a bonus action. They do this twice per short rest at level two and can start to outpace a fighter's damage. The rogue bonus from sneak attack can be pretty hard to keep pace with though if your team is working well together and the rogue is taking advantage of sneak attack every round, but that's how rogues are supposed to work (glass canon types). Later at level 5 the monk gets an extra attack and a bump up to 1d6 unarmed damage, as well as 5 ki points. So while a fighter can do 2 attacks per round monks can effectively do 4 per round, 5 times per short rest. If you take full advantage of all of the Monk's class abilities you shouldn't have any trouble keeping pace with your other melee oriented team mates. Add onto this the extra utility the monk has with Unarmored Movement, stunning strike, and the monastic traditions and the monk seems pretty well balanced with the other melee classes to me."

Instead of doing a module, I would suggest writing a little starter adventure. Tell your PC's ahead of time what the world they will be in is, or is like. (For my current campaign, I told them all we'd be doing Forgotten Realms, the year, where it takes place, and the relevant back story that the had to know) Figure out where and why the characters will meet for the first time, and write a short adventure to involve them together as a group.  Also, keep it down to a pretty short adventure with mixed RP, exploration, and combat so they get a good idea of the mechanics before being tossed into an actual module or campaign. Many, many ""newbie"" modules/campaigns can kill you in the first encounters. Just look at Hoard of the Dragon Queen.  As for specific modules, they'd have to be converted to 5e for me, but I can tell you that the starter adventure ""Lost Mines of Phandelver"" is pretty good, but you'd have to put some effort into making the main town, Phandelin, compelling; otherwise it feels a little too much like going into a new quest hub town in an MMO and seeing a bunch of little exclamation points above people's heads."

DnD,3e17f5,nabanibanaanid,5,Tue Jul 21 04:14:48 2015 UTC,"I don't use critical misses or fumble charts, they are pretty dumb ass idea imo.  The higher skilled you are the more often in a fight you fuck up.  High level fighters are just tripping over themselves and stabbing their friends in the back all the time.  Your idea is just more bookkeeping.  The only halfway good idea for fumbles I have seen is.  If you roll a 1 and you want inspiration, work with the DM to describe a cinematic fumble that puts your character in an awkward position.   If you there is an ally engaged in melee with your original target of your fumble and they also want inspiration, the fumble can screw them over too.  This way the player ops in for the fumble, and for making the game more interesting get a small reward (Inspiration) if they are the type of people who hate fumbles they don't ever need to accept the inspiration for fumble mechanic.  Also your screw up only affects other characters if they also chose to be affected for inspiration."
DnD,3e17f5,Ironforged,2,Tue Jul 21 05:00:56 2015 UTC,"The problem with critical miss rules, and the reason they are never part of the official rules, is one of game balance.  Critical miss rules punish multi-attackers, and that's bad.  If the wizard's fireball targets 10 goblins, that means that the wizard has 10x the critical miss chance as a fighter who swings his sword once.  That means that characters will eventually learn never to target lots of creatures at once, because the critical miss penalties will be crushing.  The problem is that most people assume that if something bad happens to the target in critical hits, then the relevant symmetry for critical misses is that something bad must happen to the attacker.  But that leads to bad game play, as I said above.  The better symmetry, if you must have critical misses at all, is that something good should happen to the target on a critical miss.  And here's a simple thing that's good for targets: they take 0 damage.  That's good enough, and that's how the official rules always treat critical misses."
DnD,3e17f5,ypsm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:27:17 2015 UTC,"Ypsm, note however that Fireball is an AoE spell where each creature in the area must make a saving throw. So the wizard slinging fireballs does NOT have any chance for a critical miss.  That said, this shifts the game balance the other way. Now the Wizard is beating a billion things to a bloody pulp without breaking a sweat, and the fighter is being penalized roughly every encounter because he lacks abilities that forces multiple enemies to make saving throws simultaneously."
DnD,3e17f5,SilverShadow5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:37:56 2015 UTC,"Fine, then that's a bad example.  The point is that critical miss rules penalize multi-attacking, and you don't want to do that."
DnD,3e17f5,ypsm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:02:12 2015 UTC,So I should treat a critical miss as a miss and nothing more? Maybe make an exception to melee classes. Gets complicated though. More bookkeeping.
DnD,3e17f5,ypsm,2,Tue Jul 21 07:39:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Any time you introduce a rule, think about (a) whether there's a benefit, and if so then also (b) whether the benefit outweighs the added complexity.  In this case, the added rule is not only not beneficial; it's positively harmful.  And it adds additional complexity on top of that.  Not worth it."
DnD,3e17f5,Smitikus,2,Tue Jul 21 10:56:05 2015 UTC,Thanks for the insight. I never liked using critical misses but in 5E the advantage/disadvantage system seemed to compliment them. Anyway it was a thought but I will stick to just misses. Cheers!

In seriousness, I'd prefer a critical miss system that is properly integrates with the rules.  Paranoia is done perfectly, as players have a few backup characters and it generally keeps things interesting.  Star Wars: EotE also does it well, since they're much more frequent but minor (with the more severe/unblockable crit failures requiring either a special situation or spending a DM resource.)   For D&D, most critical failure systems don't work as well because they either forget about multiple attacks (drastically making it much more common) or about spellcasting (where there's no worry becuase they use saves rather than attacks)."

Travel between planes or Captain Planet sounds really good and flow with what the overall story arc will be. our campaigns normally last a while. They'll probably all be anywhere between 18 and 20 when they get all four.

DnD,3e0e9b,YadSallad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:53:54 2015 UTC,I just finished a similar campaign around 22 sessions long.  Instead they had to hunt down Astral Shards that were stone fragments each marked with one of the animals of the Chinese zodiac.  Once the pieces were reunited and combined it was supposed to restore power to the demigod who had to disperse his power to protect it.

""Well..I'll be damned, you found it."" The man's drunken smirk fades to a dark stare as his gaze lifts from his cup and towards the adventurers. ""You have no idea what you've gotten yourself into."" He sighs and leans back, whirling his hand to buy all the party drinks and invites them to pull up a chair. ""Allow me to tell you the tale of Baru, the first dragon."" One of your party members exclaims ""This is blasphemy..there is no mention of this Baru, or what he even does with this gem, I say we take our leave and leave this drunk to his own devices"" The old man chuckled to himself and sips at his ale, and blinks, flashing a draconian eye to the skeptic ""I insist, stay awhile, and let me tell you the tell of Baru, and how he became Bahamut...""    Tl;Dr The gems are able to rewrite history and bestow godly power, and through the campaign you will find out that not all deities are what they seem to be."

DnD,3e0zav,Twins00,4,Tue Jul 21 03:01:37 2015 UTC,"Sounds like (in 5e at least) a fighter with the archery fighting style and the Soldier background. When you get to the appropriate level, choose the Battlemaster archetype."
DnD,3e0zav,The_Archer_of_Rohan,3,Tue Jul 21 03:07:36 2015 UTC,"Just a tip, definitely go with 5e. My group recently switched from 4e to 5e, and it just plays way better.  In 5e, if you use a dexterity-based weapon (Like a bow), there's really no mechanical reason to have a high strength score. The only scores which are directly valuable to you are Dexterity and Constitution, so those should be your two highest scores (People might make a case for Wisdom, but it's only valuable if the party lacks someone else with higher wisdom, imo). What other scores you choose to be high should be based on how you see your character; is he charming? Then boost Charisma. Is he gruff? Dump it. Is he strong? Have high strength. Is he about average but skilled with a bow? Put it at around 10-12. Is he weak? Dump it., etc.  Since he's a professional fighter (And you have words like ""Trained"", ""Lord"", and ""skills"", which gives a good impression of the character you're trying to make), you probably want to go with the Battlemaster archetype. Champion is a no-frills ""I'm good at making things go splat!"" subclass, and Eldritch Knight would work if you want to go for magicky character. Be sure that the maneuvers you take can be used with bows; all of them can but Lunging Strike and Sweeping Strike, and Evasive Footwork, Parry, and Riposte will be of little use at range.  As a human fighter, you have a lot of feat choices. Crossbow Expert might be a good one; you can use a Heavy Crossbow in place of a Longbow as your primary weapon, dealing a bit of extra damage and no longer having disadvantage on attacks in melee. Mounted Combat (for a mounted archer), Sharpshooter (for any archer), and Skulker (for stealthy archers) are also good feats.  You want to have a rapier (or other finesse weapon, but rapier is the best) and shield as backup weapons if you ever find yourself in melee range. Use Studded Leather or whatever medium armor you can afford, which one depending on whatever gives you the highest AC. Heavy Crossbow is the best weapon for you levels 1-4; at level 5 you get Extra Attack, which does not work with crossbows (unless you have the Crossbow Expert feat) but does work with other bows, so unless you have that feat, you should use a longbow instead. (You deal an extra 1 damage on average per hit with a crossbow, so it's not that big of a deal, but it's still something)"
DnD,3e0zav,Drewfro666,2,Tue Jul 21 03:44:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the big post, Drew. I think I will go with a longbow, and RP my character to be a bit elitist towards crossbows, "" Amateur weapon, just point and pull. You want to see a weapon that takes SKILL to use, look at this longbow"".  I will probably use a shortsword, just because I see rapiers as being a bit ""frilly"" and effete. While you are thrusting with your rapier, I'll just beat aside your blade, grab it, then stab or slash you... Eh, flavor.  Thanks for the help, everyone!"
DnD,3e0zav,PoorlyShavedApe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:37:48 2015 UTC,"Rapiers should really be piercing and slashing damage...and I believe they were in previous editions. 5E simplifies things a lot in that regard. too many people think of rapiers, epees, and foils as all being the same when they are not.  Grabbing the rapier blade is a valid dueling tactic as was taught...but isn't just something you casually do. You have to grab the blade correctly or it will cut the hell out of your hand."
DnD,3e0zav,RobVegas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:49:35 2015 UTC,"Rapiers(sabers) are bladed swords, epees are the classical ""fencing"" sword that's round and pointy that people call rapiers, and a foil is an epee with a kinda-sorta pistol-grip.  Go forth, and stab"
DnD,3e0zav,PoorlyShavedApe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:02:32 2015 UTC,"Ah, thanks for the clarification and information. Regardless, I don't think a rapier would be a good fit for a military scout."
DnD,3e0zav,PoorlyShavedApe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:17 2015 UTC,My suggestions were:  Look at the soldier (scout) or criminal (highway robber) backgrounds for flavor.  If going Ranger then pick Hunter at level 3 (the Lord's Huntmaster sort of thing is where i was headed).   If going Fighter pick Archery as your fighting style and Battle Master to use all that training your father passed along.

DnD,3dza0r,KatherineDuskfire,7,Tue Jul 21 16:56:16 2015 UTC,Sneak Attack in 5e is only applied once per turn... not once per attack per previous additions of DnD. Your rogue should not be doing 90% of the party damage. Either the other players just suck at their classes or the rogue is applying sneak attack damage to every attack it gets in a turn which is wrong.
DnD,3dza0r,jdxerox,6,Tue Jul 21 02:14:43 2015 UTC,Sneak Attack is fine.  It's not overpowered.  No one should have problems keeping up with the Rogue.  Either the dice really hate your party or there's something wrong with the non-Rogue characters.
DnD,3dza0r,Unsight,11,Mon Jul 20 19:14:30 2015 UTC,"A striker style class doing a bunch of damage. What a shock.  But without his party members there, he'd be good as dead."
DnD,3dza0r,Ryuutakeshi,4,Mon Jul 20 19:31:58 2015 UTC,Who are the other two aside from the tank? A Tank shouldn't expect to deal HUGE damage per round as he is mainly there for the Casters and Rogues to lob enemies with crits and powerful spells or protect downed allies. But it is also easy for the Tank to get in the way of them. Some casters won't blast the area with a Fireball if their ally is in the fray and archers better be careful. Especially Rogues. So they don't accidentally crit the team Tank.
DnD,3dza0r,TheDarkSpirit,5,Mon Jul 20 21:00:18 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that he can only do it once per turn.   So in a Round when it is his TURN no matter how many attacks he gets, he only applies SA damage once (though on a crit as all dice are doubled, its cray-cray). In the same round if he gets an attack on someone else's turn (say a Reaction used for Opportunity Attack) he can then add his SA damage then as well as it is a different turn, even if it is in the same Round.  It sounds like everyone is looking at it like too much of a video game. If I were the other party members and this guy was saying ""I'm so much better than you in combat that I deserve more loot"" I'd not adventure with him anymore. D&D isn't a video game, there should be some roleplaying concerns. Also, if he is doing that much damage, the monsters should wise up and fire back to try and take him out as well. They think mind you, they aren't just AI saying ""attack MMO tank"".  Plus, how is he in puzzles, social situations, or in fights where he can't get SA? You need to setup some challenges that don't just play to his one strength."
DnD,3dza0r,Ryngard,2,Mon Jul 20 22:14:58 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more about ""tanks"".  Also, if you're playing with roles, the enemies should be too. Who's to say the orcs don't have a big dude occupying the paladin while two others run to flank the rogue?   Enemies can also take a Dodge action to give incoming attacks disadvantage, or neutralize any advantage coming in. No advantage, no sneak attack.  In conclusion, rogue isn't over powered, your enemies are getting themselves killed."

The big meat shield of a a tank or another melee PC is going to, depending on enemy vs player size, partial cover if it is larger then the PC, at least three quarters cover if its a same size, and full cover if the target is smaller. Use this to your advantage and have the enemy contently move to keep the tank between it and the rogue. Also smack him for the I deserve more loot bullshit."
DnD,3dza0r,Coppercredit,6,Tue Jul 21 04:09:54 2015 UTC,"If everything is being done correctly then its not overpowered.   Make sure he only applies it if he has advantage. Edit: Also if an ally is within 5 feet of the target and isnt incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage. The dice rolls may really suck for some people. Put him in a fight without the tank or where he can't sit back with a bow and show him just how much he needs the other characters to function at the best he can."

The attack must use a a finesse or ranged weapon. You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, the enemy of the target isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.  All three conditions must be met or he needs advantage.   You get sneak attack as long as you don't have disadvantage   Thats how you end up with overpowered Sneak Attack"

DnD,3dza0r,Ryngard,2,Mon Jul 20 22:17:48 2015 UTC,"Clarification: You get Sneak Attack Dice on two conditions: Condition One, you have advantage on an attack. If this condition is not met, Condition 2: You have an ally within 5 ft of your target. So as a rogue as long as somebody is engaged with your target you will get SA damage dice OR if you are attacking with advantage (Such as attacking from stealth). And yes, this can only be applied once a round, so multi-attacks do not trigger it each time."
DnD,3dza0r,ArmedPirate,4,Mon Jul 20 22:41:27 2015 UTC,Once per turn. So in a round you could get it more than once (using a Reaction for Opportunity Attack for instance).
DnD,3dza0r,Ryngard,3,Mon Jul 20 23:07:09 2015 UTC,"Doesn't have to be an ally, just an enemy of the target."
DnD,3dza0r,Zupheal,4,Tue Jul 21 00:41:30 2015 UTC,"To add to what others have told you, remember that firing into melee grants cover to the target.   If there's 1 ally between the rogue and his target, that target gets a +2 bonus to AC (1/2 cover) for the rogues shot. If there's 2 or more creatures between the rogue and his target the bonus to the target is +5 AC (3/4 cover). (These are all for Medium sized creatures. If the cover creature is Large or larger feel free to up the cover bonus.)  The DMG has a variant rule whereas shooting into melee now has consequences. When shooting into melee combat if you missing a target with cover, but wouldn't miss the covers AC, you strike the cover.   Example: The rogue shoots at enemy with two allies between him and his target. The target has an AC of 15, with a +5 bonus due to 3/4's cover. Ally 1 has an AC of 16 and Ally 2 has an AC of 18. The rogue rolls a 17 to hit. He misses the target, and Ally 2, but hits Ally 1.  If an enemy is standing next to the rogue he gets Disadvantage on his shot and therefore no sneak attack. This can be a Wizard's familiar. (What wizard wouldn't commit their familiar to save their own life?) It can also be a monk/barbarian with 40+ speed that can take the disengage action, waltz through combat without provoking any OA's (opportunity attacks) and then just stand next to the rogue, not only defeating his ranged prowess but also pinning him to the spot (forcing him to use cunning action on his turn to move away).  Also if the Rogue is Hiding, then popping out and firing with advantage, it's entirely AOK to give him disadvantage on his Stealth Check if he's hiding in the same spot each time. The first time the enemy probably won't see him. The second time you damn well bet they're going to be keep in eye on that spot!  Hope this helps!"
DnD,3dza0r,daren_sf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:39:55 2015 UTC,This is all interesting.  Is the cover rule that would apply to melee combat that you mentioned first a written rule or homebrew?  We are fairly new to the whole thing and are following the book a bit closer than I think most people would.
DnD,3dza0r,aButch7,2,Mon Jul 20 21:04:20 2015 UTC,"I'm almost certain that ""rules about hitting cover"" are writen either in the phb or the dmg. Just look for ""cover"" in the index of both books."
DnD,3dza0r,aButch7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:30:05 2015 UTC,No i mean it applying to someone who is shooting into combat? Basically the rogue is getting advantage all the time because he is shooting at something in combat

DnD,3dza0r,daren_sf,2,Tue Jul 21 01:25:09 2015 UTC,"There are some things that you have to look at logically. 5e is a bit loose on the rules but common sense should trump a rule anyway. There may not be a strict penalty for shooting into melee but the bad guy could be granted cover if your tank is a huge guy directly inbetween you and him. Next thing you know you have to deal with the cover rules, or your DM could say ""you get disadvantage as Bob the Tank is blocking the shot"" bam, no SA."

So, if your Barbarian is fighting on the side of your target (effectively making it so you're shooting into the side flank of your target) the target does not have cover, and therefore there are no penalties to shooting into melee.  At least, no guaranteed penalties. Most DMs will fuck over your teammate on a natural 1 in that situation too. So... Fire at your (and your party's!) risk."

DnD,3dza0r,Folsomdsf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:00:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly, sneak attack isn't even that powerful, when compared to serious DPS builds. A big portion of a rouge's value comes from his RP and skill based abilities.   Say you have a level 11 party fighting an efreeti. Everyone has +1 weapons, and 18 in their primary stat.   The rouge has +9 to hit, and we'll assume he has advantage half the time from hiding(but always has a parry member in melee range), he will hit a 17AC target about 84% of the time (and crit 7.5% of the time) for 7d6+5, for an average of 26.75 damage per round.   What about a battle master fighter with great weapon master and polearm master feats? We're going to assume that he uses his superiority dice for precision attacks on anything within 4 of hitting, to offset taking -5 attack to get +10 damage using great weapon master. I'm going to break this into the main weapon attacks, and the bonus attack with the shaft, to keep things more organized. He has a 5% chance to crit, a 35% chance to hit normally, a 20% chance of using a precision attack and a 75% chance of hitting with it after the dice, for a net of 50% to hit and 5% to crit. Each regular swing deals 1d10+15, except we throw out 1s and 2s, so it is really 1d8+17(2d8+19 on crit), and he gets 3 swings. Then he also gets a 4th swing with the pole arm shaft, which we'll say doesn't use precision attacks, so 5% chance to crit, and 35% chance to hit for 1d2+17 damage. Added all together, we get a total of 44 damage per round, and he should be able to keep that up for 8 rounds, not counting an action surge.   There are MANY other higher DPR builds out there. A maximized rouge is probably barely in the top 2/3s single class (although multiclass can be pretty powerful)."
DnD,3dza0r,Zupheal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:06:49 2015 UTC,"Remember, he has to be hidden to get sneak attacks without the tank. That means he needs to be behind cover otherwise lets be real.. If someone just shot you with a fucking bow an arrow, you know where the fuck he is unless he's able to somehow actually be out of sight. The rogue will quickly become shit without what is essentially flanking for 5e. Oh and he better not be behind the tank, or the enemy has cover, automatically not getting sneak attack cause he'sjust not going to hit. And if he gets in position, just put someone next to him, instantly has no sneak attack. Just send some random melee up next to him and see how he likes never getting to sneak attack. It doesn't even have to be a dangerous enemy, send the crappiest little kobold over to stand next to him with his bow/crossbow, see how unhappy it makes the rogue and how useless he feels."

Alternatively, drop loot specifically for tanks or the other characters that he wouldn't be able to use. It would be a dick move for him to say he wants to sell it when the tank could use it.  Ultimately, don't intervene with loot distribution, give them the items and let them discuss in-character who gets what. Internal arguments (in character) are fun. Don't let it spill out of character though."

As long as Fighter Fred is standing next to Ozzy the Orc, Rob the Rogue gets Sneak Attack all day."
DnD,3dza0r,Treberto,-7,Mon Jul 20 19:20:38 2015 UTC,"Not completely true, you can be within 5 feet, but the enemy can't have line of sight on you, the minute the enemy can see you, or is aware of you, then Sneak attack can't be used."

In 5e you get sneak attack damage if you have advantage on your attack or if your target has an enemy within 5ft of them and that enemy isn't incapacitated and you don't have disadvantage.  Your target could be staring you right in the face and pointing at you but if you have advantage or if your target has an  active enemy within 5ft of them (and you don't have disadvantage) you would still get Sneak Attack damage.  I think the problem here is it is called ""Sneak Attack"" so people automatically assume you have to be sneaky or hidden to do it. They should have renamed it to be ""Vital Strike"" or something like that."

My rogue, on the other hand, an assassin... she has a lot less damage.  Except... once in a while, the rogue gets a nice setup. When this happens, and trust me she is learning to make it happen more often, she makes the damage the other two put out look like a joke. She'll walk in, picks off the nastiest target or very nearly so, and then the other two walk in and casually beat down the rest.   The other two make short work of enemies, sure, but nobody trivializes encounters like my rogue.

The lowest they could hit with Sneak Attack is 9 with a Rapier, or 10 with 2 Daggers.   A level 6 Barbarian with Bezerker Path can deal a maximum of 57 damage, with out Crit (1d12+5+2 [Original Attack], 1d12+5+2 [Frenzy Attack Bonus Action], and 1d12+5+2 [ Extra Attack] in one turn.

It would initially not be full-sized of course, but if kept from dying, then it would eventually grow bigger.  Spells and items that let you influence animals would be useful for procuring the young and might help with the training, but just charming an adult lion or t-rex or whatever won't cut it.

This might give way to some awesome villains that keep chasing your players EVEN after the pirate battle ends. Some ""Blackbeard washing up on shore swearing vengeance"" kind of shit.  Maybe your players find out about a tribe of natives that live on the island, and the God your barbarian warpriest worships has given them power but they are peaceful. Will your players take this power (maybe a magic item) by force? Will they try to coerce the natives into giving them the item? Perhaps there is a temple where the item is hidden, and the natives will not allow them entry?  You've got a sick campaign setting, so it's all up to you. Have fun!"
DnD,3dxwk0,ThePTouch,2,Mon Jul 20 13:08:11 2015 UTC,"The whole island is a gargantuan mimic, but this mimic is not ""evil"". (If you want you can have it as the ""mimic god"") It lives as a sort of symbiote to the natives of the island and changes itself and in turn the island to suit its occupants needs. In turn the occupants give the mimic tribute via a bottemless pit at the center of the island. The sacrifice can be anything from gold, food, creatures, anything that is ""valuable"". If some occupants fail to pay tribute(every 6 moths or so) the mimic opens up a fissure and swallows the civilization whole. Of course on this island is a cult that worships the mimic like a god because it kinda is to them. They have a way of communicating with the mimic to ask it for something(new river, mountain,etc) If they ""join"" the cult they can ask they can complete a ""quest"" for the mimic to get help with what they need.   For example: The warpriest might ask for a cure or to see his god and in return the mimic would ask him to get rid of the cult because they are annoying. The mimic would tell the cartographer of a temple/ruins/structure on him that he can't control. It scares him and he wants to know why. I tried to not go into too much detail and leave that to you."
DnD,3dxwk0,Iaconacoalsaurus,2,Mon Jul 20 16:02:55 2015 UTC,"First off a little warning I am kind of stoned so I will probably write out the best little mini campaign of your lives.    Okay so the players will start out on the boat going towards the island. Its pretty far out but not more than a day and nights journey. They will leave and reach the island the next morning, if all goes to plan. (BTW I am going to give an outline and you can fill in all the details) During the day their journey was smooth sailing. Sunny and warm the whole day it was a pleasant trip. The companions got to know some of the npcs that they encountered. I suspect you could roll some die and figure which of the NPCs they encounter, but always make sure they encounter Corin and his guard. So on the play through you roll and they meet Francis and Foltyn, you will also make them encounter Corin. Make sure you make it known he is a violent criminal.    The night also passes without incident. Incidently though the players room is right next to the room Corin is held in. The morning comes and the captain is notified that they are next to the island. He decides to wait and wake everyone up in a few hours when it is day time, as he doesn't want to land during the darkness (the players don't know this). If this is 5e you can do a perception check at this point to see if the players notice the stopping/orders and wake up, or you can just say ""You are awoken to sounds of orders"" or something.    They dont know this but Corin woke up as well. Unfortunately Walsh Fenris did not. Corin took this chance to take advantage of a trick he was taught back in the city. He dislocated his wrist and slipped out of the manacles. He undid the ropes on his legs and was making his escape. He took Walsh's weapons and armor, knocking him out in the process. And the players roll perception checks! If they pass em the players hear the struggle and get the jump on Corin, otherwise they have to wait until the alarm is sounded on the deck. By that time it might be too late. So if they capture Corin good job,  if they kill him thats too bad for Walsh. If he gets away Walsh goes out looking for him (making an enemy of the players who failed to catch him). If Corin is captured Walsh continues to guard him on the island. If Corin is killed, Walsh offers his services to Paisley Hammerhorn.    So that is the boat. I will condense the next part as this is getting a bit long.    So basically the whole plot will center around Paisley and him trying to exploit the island. Lots of shit will happen because Paisley fucking with the island trying to use it to get rich. First off, the ship will stay out in port and only the people exploring the island will be leaving the ship. The crew will go on the beach and only a skeleton crew and the captain will stay on the ship.    When the players first make landfall they are approached by Paisley Hammerhorn. He asks them to explore the island and look for any signs of civilized life. (Oh there is)    On the island the players come to find a tribe of whatever race you want them to. The players were accompanied by an assistant for Hammerhorn who goes to inform Hammerhorn of the discovery.    At this point you can have them do something for the Tribe, or they can go back to Hammerhorn. Its up to you what direction you want to push them. If the players go off on tangents the events still happen that I am writing just by different means.      So Hammerhorn contacts the tribe and at first its all fun and celebration but he is able to get them to join his cause. He relocates the tribe to the coast and starts the construction of a small fort. During the deforesting process he disturbs a magical creature that causes starts rampaging and the players will be procured to defeat the beast.    Foltyn is off exploring the island, you could do small encounters with him as the players explore the island.    Francis has been with the tribe and discovered he is a powerful sorcerer plagued with wild magic. You can do some quests related to that.    You could have them help out the crew on the beach. Maybe they are being attacked at night by forest creatures. You can choose.  Paisley in his infinite wisdom decides to explore an ancient ziggurat in the middle of the island and look for valuables. He asks the players to go into the ziggurat. If they dont he and his guardian go in. The players miss out on a lot of treasure, make it known there is a bunch of treasure in there. Well either way, if the players go in they personally learn of a cult that destroyed the source of the illusion magic protecting the island from outsiders. They also plan on using that source to summon a god and bring about the destruction of the world, the normal cult hubbub. So the source could be a creature, a crystal, a statue, a weapon. Whatever. If the players dont go into the ziggurat they find out through Paisley about the cult. Paisley wants to get rich, not get killed by a god when it destroys the world, so he asks the players to help.  Foltyn doesn't want the world to end so the players can work with Foltyn to stop the cult.    While the players are dealing with the cult, paisley is still working on making his perfect little cash cow on the island. So there will be issues with him fucking up the island and generally causing problems. If a large amount of time has passed you can have more workers and merchants from the main continent come and populate the newly formed village surrounding for Hammerhorn.    So lets say the players stop the cult from summoning a god and destroying the world (hurrah). What should their reward be. I feel that the god of the warpriest should make an appearance and cure his people. The cartographer should get something cool to happen to him as well. So this is what I got, hope you use some of it :D"
DnD,3dxwk0,PolygonMan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:27:31 2015 UTC,I would make several different groups all assume this is their holy island. Maybe some demon cult thinks its a sign from their dark gods. Maybe an ancient blue dragon thinks this will be his new home. Maybe some pirate admiral wants this to be his home base. Basically make many multiple sides all covet this new land for their own reasons and it turns into a mass conflict over sparse resources.

Just as your adventurers are there to study the island, the island is studying your adventurers.  It sends various monsters and traps to test their martial abilities, while at the same time blasting them with psychics to see how they stand mentally.  The island isn't really evil, so to speak, but it's concepts of life and death are so foreign to us that it has very little regard for the safety and well-being of your adventurers. As a bonus, any of the adventures that do end up dying on the island will just be absorbed into the islands hive mind, allowing them to make an appearance again either as friends of enemeies."

I'm sort of doing this in the opposite direction, though - long ago a huge island that is sorta Atlantis separated from the mainland after a cataclysmic event. All the players come from this island and believe that life everywhere outside the island ended long ago. Now they're on a naval expedition to travel far to the west and investigate whether any other lands/life still exist.  I'm still working it out, but I think it's going to start with their ship being grounded on a reef not far from the first new island they discover and having to go to the island to gather food/water/etc. while encountering various enemies. Eventually it turns out that the entire continent still exists and the ancient Atlantian empire that used to run everything was pretty horrible and as a consequence things are still pretty messed up there."

You have a few days until [important person] expects to have a new task for you. What do you do now? [Who goes where, with whom, and why are good points to work out.

DnD,3dzw1e,Shuliak,8,Mon Jul 20 21:47:22 2015 UTC,"Clerics use their holy symbols as a spell-casting focus (can be used in lieu of material components).  They can have their symbol emblazoned on their shield, which basically makes their shield their focus.  Things get muddier when you start looking at somatic components as well, though.  If you don't want to worry about that at all, you can take the War Caster feat which lets you use your shield or weapon hand for somatic components."
DnD,3dzw1e,coldermoss,3,Mon Jul 20 21:52:36 2015 UTC,"If a spell requires both material and somatic components then you can use your shield hand for both.  Your only issue by RAW is when a spell requires somatic components but not material, as you need a full open hand.  On these occasion you can use your free action to put your sword away.  The only downside is you couldn't make an AoO while your sword is in it's scabbard."

DnD,3dzw1e,techiesgoboom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:16:58 2015 UTC,"I had a crafty cleric once, while explaining that the holy symbol replaces the need for material components unless they cost gold, and he asked what happens if he lost his holy symbol. Well, you can't cast.   What if I have a material component pouch and lose my symbol?  Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh (15 minutes later) uhh yeah sure you can cast I guess?  Later on I wanted to make use of this, so I had the party put under arrest for trespassing and other crimes. The guard captain was present for this, which is important. The guards took the party's weapons, the holy symbols and the material component pouch from the wizard (come on it's not often to think a cleric has a MCP) and would have them and their packs thoroughly searched when they were locked in cells. The crafty cleric put his hand into one of the pouches on his bandolier, looks at the guard captain and said, ""Hey, you know me! We've done nothing wrong, let us go!""  Well captain failed his save against the Suggestion spell, ordered his men to let go of his good friend and his party on grounds that they keep their noses clean, and let them go and the cleric concentrated for the full 8 hours so they'd have that long of a head start getting away."
DnD,3dzw1e,RobVegas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:20:52 2015 UTC,The problem is there are two objects you need to interact with.  The weapon and the holy symbol.  Some DMs will let you fudge this by painting the holy symbol on the shield.

So cleric with weapon and shield, casts a spell with S&M component no problem just uses shield and hand griping shield.  If the cleric casts a spell that needs somatic and no material component, then he needs to drop/store his weapon or have the warcaster feat."

DnD,3dzw1e,Dongaloid,2,Mon Jul 20 22:59:28 2015 UTC,You can draw or stow a weapon on your turn for 'free'. To do both requires an action. To don or doff a shield is one action.  With the PH Errata it's best to have a cleric with a 2H weapon for big damage as the errata clarified that you only need 2H to use the weapon. Instantly bypasses the issue...

DnD,3dw136,TheWolfee,124,Mon Jul 20 00:22:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, um, that's not entirely a DnD problem. It's more of an internet problem. All it takes is one or two weird players to ruin a game. Tbh that's what you get when you use roll20 to find a game with random internet strangers.  I would consider trying to pull a game together from the decent people you've met from random roll20 games. You'll want to find a DM first, then try to pull together some players. Yeah, it's a lot of work, but it's what has to be done if you don't want a bunch of weirdoes in your group.  My first DnD group (before some friends from school started a home group) was pulled together from a bunch of other staff from a minecraft server, so if you're into anything like that, you might be able to start a game."
DnD,3dw136,Drewfro666,45,Mon Jul 20 00:49:53 2015 UTC,"Yep. The reason OP keeps getting weirdos is because up until now he's just been trying to get into a group by potluck.  Guess what? No one wants fat, awkward fetishists in their group, so those people get kicked out and then they go look for a group by potluck. And they continue to bounce from one group to another, because no one wants to put up with them. So if you sign up for a random group on Roll20, guess who's likely to be in it.  Finding a decent DnD group is no different than finding a decent girlfriend, or a decent job, or a decent house. If you want something of quality you've got to work for it, at least a little. I don't buy OP's line that no one in Ireland plays DnD.  I'm in Texas, and I've got a great group of four players. Two of them I met at church. One of them I met at a bar. The last guy I met at a game store, playing DnD with a bunch of weirdos because I was sifting through them for the one quality person I could be really good friends with.

I could never grab a beer with them which really bothered me.  In comes my current dnd group playing board games and now I just do that instead. Mtg on the side, and Dnd every week.

I have talked to every single person in my entire school and only 5 of them like video games and there all not really people i would be friends with.

I got some news for you, google search that shit or even just look at his twitter.   I do not think weird is a bad thing but yah, some people are seemingly oblivious to how their actions affect others in some respects. Add in a dash of internet and you got a strange recipe. Like I'm weird as all fuck and don't deny it. I'm the guy who in an online game has turned his camera on, ripped off his shirt and started flexing going 'BERSERKER RAGE'. Then calmly putting on a new shirt sit down and go 'I go into berserker rage and charge the goblin to the far right here and go hard into power attack'. I'd probably never do the shirt ripping thing in person because ya know.. I wouldn't likely have an extra shirt nearby, but the rest is... pretty standard fare for a very animated group."

DnD,3dw136,FlakJackson,3,Mon Jul 20 17:59:05 2015 UTC,My advice would be get friends who want to learn to play that are decent people and teach them the game.  It's a lot easier than teaching internet guys to be decent people.
DnD,3dw136,Havok-Trance,3,Mon Jul 20 01:37:41 2015 UTC,"I got a bunch of my friends into it by hosting a beer and boardgame night once a week or so. We'd be playing settlers and stuff, and my friend and I would be talking about what happened in our campaigns, our friends would overhear and became interested.  Which led to one-shots, which led to adventures, which led to campaigns. DnD is millions of times better with people you click with."
DnD,3dw136,Havok-Trance,3,Mon Jul 20 06:26:36 2015 UTC,"Sounds like Skype games. I once thought I had scored a decent group when I had found out there were two women in it. A former of positive stereotyping for women told me that the girls couldn't be so bad. So one made a character without understanding the game setting or rules or really anything. She was also incredibly award and chose to spend the last half of the session cleaning her house unmuted. The other woman wanted to use her high charisma too seduce every male npc to do whatever she wanted, actively interfering with my interactions with them to do so. Yeah no more online games, and apparently women can be just as weird as men.  The hobby attracts weird people due to its fantasy orientation and seeming lack of requirement to be good at anything.  Now I do think you can be bad at role playing on multiple levels but that isn't something people want to put in their books. My thinking is that if most of the people weren't damaged in one way or another they would be doing something that had a higher barrier to entry like a craft or a sport.   Roleplaying has good potential though. There are huge opportunities for creativity and skill development that surpass video games and fandom. I just take it seriously and tell people I consider it a hobby that you can do wrong just like dancing, tennis, or drawing. There are rules for behavior and principles for doing it correctly. It's hard to find players but the two I have are great."

DnD,3dw136,Delvakiir,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:48:07 2015 UTC,"I think searching for a 'regular' group of players is an exercise in futility. Especially on the internet. I know that I'm pretty awkward and such not to the level of nakedness on cam or making furry characters. But def have verbal ticks and stuff like that that, role playing really helps me cope with that. So yea, in a way I am the weirdness.  As for others, I think that you just need to learn to embrace and mitigate the weird as much as possible. Role Playing is still very much the counter culture, so it's going to draw in people with strange views.  Naked fat guys on cam should be kicked out if they're creeping on other people. Or at least told to get off cam and watch what they say. And as long as the Furry people aren't really hurting anyone or trying to force their weird fetish down other peoples throats then you should just roll with it. Weirdness is bound to happen by design when playing in a fantasy world where people are given free reign to be open with each other."

DnD,3dw136,Ender-of-Bart,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:47:58 2015 UTC,Random question but where does OP go to find random online DND groups? I have even looking to start my DND hobby and would love any suggestions for sites or DND online! Thanks everyone!
DnD,3dw136,Wintorn,2,Mon Jul 20 14:03:24 2015 UTC,Roll20 has a Looking For Group page.
DnD,3dw136,NateMayhem,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:34:08 2015 UTC,"It looks like you have enough answers to your question, but one way to solve this is to create your own group and screen the people you let join it, its what I have done in any online game I have run.  When you are not the DM, you do not have much say as to who is in the game, but if there is anyone in any of the games you had played in that are ""normal"" enough for you, ask just them to join in your game."
DnD,3dw136,Rilack_Miller,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:15:01 2015 UTC,"Try looking on meetup.com It took me a couple years to find the group I have now. I had to sift through many people.  I was fortunate, there's a website called Vancouver gaming guild, and I live in Vancouver... I found some cool people on there.  Just look around online for locals.  Start small, see if you can get a group of 4. Try to learn how to dm, you'll attract more people."

Then, you play those games, and pick out people you like and can tell are uncomfortable with the game in the same way you are. Make an effort to be friends with these people outside of roll20, and make sure you have another way of contacting them. If the group overall is awkward and you don't like it, leave the group.   Repeat this several times until you have assembled your A-Team of online D&D players. Then, you create your own group with those people and have the mythical ""good D&D""  This'll probably take a while, though, so you'll have to be ready to play the long con."
DnD,3dyemt,Hyakk,11,Mon Jul 20 15:30:46 2015 UTC,"I have even had instances where the NPC would ask them questions directly and they just don't say anything or they say like 2 words.   So roleplay it! ""Gee, your friend here a little slow?"" Maybe some combination of comedy, shame, and aggression will garner a response. If not, well, some introverts roleplay... introverts. Just keep it moving, and think about how your NPCs would legitimately react to such actions.   However some players kind of just refuse to say anything once again. Sometimes not even declaring an attack literally just rolling.   I've called players out on this. A roll without a declared action doesn't count:  dice hit table ""Sixteen""  ""What were you doing?""  ""Uh, hitting it with my sword""  ""Okay, roll now"".  ...and it's possible you might have to be the one to describe the swing and the hit. After several of these, they might catch on.  Another thing is to stop assuming their characters are doing anything if they're not talking. Ten minutes later, when the party members are attemping to discuss something with them, you can say ""you notice so-and-so isn't here."" ""What, where am I?"" ""Well, the last time you said you were doing something was back in town, so it appears you're still standing in front of the well."""

DnD,3dyemt,Derp_Stevenson,4,Mon Jul 20 19:54:34 2015 UTC,"You just have to do your best to ease the less social players into it.  Try to suggest that they use 3rd person roleplaying, e.g. ""I ask the innkeeper if she can tell me anything about X person,"" instead of getting into first person.  In terms of combat, I would tell them that the minimum they have to do is to declare what attack/spell they're using, etc.  Then flavor it up for them.  If they just want to say ""I attack the goblin with my sword,"" then you fill in all the flavor.  Maybe your other players want to flavor it up and you just describe the outcome, but with the more quiet players you just do the full thing, describing how they swung their sword, etc.  If they enjoy it, they'll take the reins back from you and start to do more of it themselves.  Some people have a hard time getting comfortable being open at the table, but you might find they'll get there as long as you don't make them feel weird about what they're doing now."
DnD,3dyemt,Derp_Stevenson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:46:30 2015 UTC,When they do talk they normally use the third person which is completely fine so thats is all good. Just they don't talk haha :P  Certainly going to use the combat idea and describe there moves if they don't describe it themselves. I agree that they might then want to take the reigns back. Thanks for the help!
DnD,3dyemt,ictow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:05:43 2015 UTC,"Np, I hope you can get your players excited and comfortable with getting more into the game, because as we all know, it becomes that much more fun when you just let yourself really get into character."
DnD,3dyemt,Altair1371,3,Mon Jul 20 16:31:03 2015 UTC,"Try talking to them about it away from the table? Just a basic: ""Hey, how are you liking the game?"" If they give a non-answer like ""A lot"", follow up with: ""What do you like? Is there anything you want more or less of? Since I'm new I'd love to get your perspective.""  That will give you a lot more information to work with in diagnosing what's going on."
DnD,3dyemt,navystreak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:52:34 2015 UTC,I have tried that and got some great feedback at times and then at other times got the 'Yeah its good' sort of approach which doesn't really help. There was once a time when a player started arguing with me because I let his character go unconscious in the first couple of turns in combat and I didn't 'fudge' the rolls so he could at least have a couple more turns fighting. I mean I understand why someone might not like this but there are rules for a reason right?
DnD,3dyemt,Zorgak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:11:05 2015 UTC,"It is a tricky balance there.  The rules are there, but at the end of the day the DM is the referee, judge, jury, and executioner.  If having a character get knocked out in the first round isn't fun for the party, consider other, lighter consequences.  Maybe he's just stunned, for example.  Also, make sure the enemies are properly balanced.  A big issue is where both sides can one-shot each other, but have poor aim. That setup means the battle is solely determined by the dice.  Instead, tweak attacks so they hit more often, but don't deal as much damage.  Make sure your party's gear isn't too powerful for the enemies they should be fighting (a level 3 shouldn't have a +3 weapon)."
DnD,3dyemt,Sarcausm,2,Mon Jul 20 19:58:46 2015 UTC,"I have the same issue, two players do all of the talking and the other three are silent.  I push these players to interact more by conversing directly to them and encouraging more out of them than a few words, but it's important to understand that some players just aren't comfortable with this.  In terms of rolling attacks without saying anything, I had a player do this quite a bit to the point where I discussed it with them privately and asked them to at least state the action before rolling.  Now, if an attack hit and defeats an enemy, I'll ask the character ""what happens"".  This has now come to be understood as ""you have dealt enough damage to kill the enemy: describe it"".  The PCs love this.  This is their chance to be the overpowered war machines that they want to be.  Split a guy in half? sure.  Decapitate the ogre? No problem.  Describing mundane attacks can get tedious, even I as a DM find it difficult to find other ways of saying ""you missed"", but there's countless ways of taking an enemy down.  Final point: talk to your two active players and ask them to converse in character to the silent ones.  I talked to my most talktative player and said ""could you make an effort to talk in character to the others?  They're not reacting to NPCs but maybe they will to a fellow player"".  This approach has worked on one of them, the other two are still quite quiet but its a work in progress.   The more we play the more everyone is comfortable with getting into character and playing the game as a role-playing game instead of a tactical board game.  For the less interactive players you could always suggest that they play characters who are quite similar to their own personalities which makes it easier to act in such ways.  I hope some of this helps :)"
DnD,3dyemt,peronne17,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:45:10 2015 UTC,I will ask if the more talkative players can help bring it out of the others a bit more.  I actually use the whole 'What happens' sort of thing. The more Active PC's love it when they can go crazy with the kill. Thanks for the advice!

The gateway is barred and on the base of each statue is what ever you want to open the door. The trick is one statue is different such that it's outside the very common class race combo (eg an elven ranger is common but you don't see an orc wizard all that much) and the odd statue is the one that will open the door. Hidden in the room is a message to help if they get stuck. If the wrong lever was pulled the ""accurate"" statues become animate and the players fight them."

DnD,3dxhxb,Zorgak,4,Mon Jul 20 11:18:18 2015 UTC,"My best one was a modified version of one I found on the net. It's a bit long. I'm sorry.  From my notes:  ""The natural passage abruptly stops, cut of by a chasm, seeming endlessly deep. There is a ledge, about 15 feet by 40 feet. To the left there is a large, carved dragon's head, jaws apart and a sword thrust in to the top of it's mouth. To the right there lies an obsidian statue of a slain knight. The blackness of the stone makes it seem as the warrior was charred by the dragon. At the other side of the chasm they see the passage continue, but there is no way to cross the chasm. There is nothing else to discern.  If anyone grabs the handle of the sword, that character will be magically stuck, with no chance to get loose by normal means. At the same time, letters appear on wall by the knight statue.   ""Never defeated by sword or might. Have no hand but will grip you tight.""  At the same time a weak fire appears in the dragon’s throat. If a letter on the wall is touched, it will start to glow. The password that must be spelled out is the answer to the riddle: «fear». If any other combination of four letter are pressed, the fire in the throat intensifies and the letters stop glowing. If five combinations fail in succession, the dragon will spout fire, dealing 10d6 damage to everyone on the ledge. If any player is near the exit, they get a DC 18 dexterity save. A success will make them tumble into the cavern, and take half damage,  When, or if, the correct password is entered, the sword releases it’s grip, the flame in the throat is extinguished and large stones float up from the chasm, forming a bridge one can use to safely cross the gap.""  My players managed to enter the correct combination on the last try. The rogue that was stuck in the dragon's mouth was literally sweating with fear. Great fun!"

DnD,3dxhxb,Herahtic,2,Mon Jul 20 16:03:59 2015 UTC,"One of the best pieces of advice for puzzles in roleplaying games is: ""The correct solution is the one that lets your players feel clever and fits the fiction.""  That means you provide clues, may have thought of a solution, but you aren't stubborn about it.  Puzzles and riddles can grind a session to a halt.  What makes sense to you may not make sense to other people.  And as a DM my goal isn't to 'win' against my players, it's to to enrich and enliven their imaginary lives.  Any puzzle I have in my games can be solved by a reasonable good faith effort and a plausible solution."
DnD,3dxhxb,Shuliak,2,Mon Jul 20 17:17:12 2015 UTC,"One that I had created but have yet to use was a 4 (or 6 or 8, depending on how and complex I wanted it to be) statue moving puzzle. Each of the statues were of folk heroes who had become friends  with another hero (making pairs) and defeated some evil but eventually had a falling out for various reasons. Each statue had a plaque with a brief description of who the hero was and other relevant information.  The big hint I would give on a large plaque above a door was something along the lines of:  ""Darkness the heroes had once slain, but will they ever see eye to eye again?""   From there, the players hopefully would figure out that they had to pair off the statues so that they faced each other in some pattern. If they had read the plaques and paid attention there would be a mention of another hero (either by deed, race or another distinguishing feature) and the players would know who to pair off. So for example:  ""Richter the Fighter, tall and dim, fell in love with a lady small and slim""  Then on the plaque of another statue:  ""Yoelle the Halfling, quick and conniving, for the heart of a warrior she was striving""  Do this X amount of times with the other statues until all are paired off, then voila, door opens, chest appears, whatever you want.  edit: fixed some words and phrasing"
DnD,3dxhxb,slothbot,3,Mon Jul 20 19:05:13 2015 UTC,"As a DM and a player I actually hate puzzles in a role-playing game. If you are playing with a bunch of meta-gamers then I suppose they could be okay but to me, it just breaks the immersion.  First of all, lots of dungeon puzzles have clues scattered throughout to help solve the riddle. Yet, why would anyone who designed traps to keep people out decided to leave clues behind so that random strangers might just happen to figure it out and break in? I can understand if it is some kind of gauntlet to test the mettle of certain individuals and their worthiness but besides that it does not much sense. That's just my problem with them from a world-building perspective.  However, the biggest problem I have is that when tasked with a puzzle almost all role-playing will cease. A puzzle is to make players thinks. But let's be honest, the 8 int barbarian with a -1 modifier to the int is not going to solve some ancient riddle structured around demonic lore and archaic prophecy written in a language he does not understand. However, the player of this character might actually be the smartest player at the table. So, then this player might be quick to realize how to solve the puzzle, but his character would not... perhaps the 8 year old brother of the DM has the 20 Int wizard at lvl 1 who is trained in all the right skills yet the player might not be that smart. There is a disconnect. Puzzles, to me, make the players step back from the game and just think about how to solve the puzzle regardless of their characters actions or intents -  it is just a weird meta-gaming brain trust to get exp or be taxed some HP.  I like puzzles, I honestly do and I love the idea of puzzles. However, I just hate how they break immersion."
DnD,3dy16d,justdiver,21,Mon Jul 20 13:45:57 2015 UTC,"First, I'll disclose that I love 5E much more than I ever did 3.5, and I am glad as hell to be back to an edition of D&D that is much more loose without rules for every little thing, and without 100 splat books.  I also didn't like 4E, mostly because the wargame combat was fun but took too long to run and so didn't give my table what we wanted.  If you're interested in trying 5E but don't want to transition your current game, then don't.  Moving a 3.5 campaign over to 5E would require a lot of work, and in the case of certain characters, it just wouldn't work at all and you'd have to ask people to give up a lot of what they like about the characters they already made.  What I would do is finish your current campaign, and then start a new one using 5E, fresh.  That way you can try it and see how the group all feels about it playing new characters, not having to feel like they need to try to translate their characters over mid-campaign."
DnD,3dy16d,Derp_Stevenson,6,Mon Jul 20 14:05:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you don't have to switch editions mid-campaign. If you're really itching to try 5e, maybe do a one-shot game with it instead."
DnD,3dy16d,thomar,2,Mon Jul 20 14:14:47 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking.  I did purchase the starter kit and that has a small one shot in it.

DnD,3dy16d,captainraffi,2,Mon Jul 20 17:41:20 2015 UTC,The starter box is awesome and is definitely more than a one shot. Probably 3-5 sessions if you want to do all of it.
DnD,3dy16d,Quiddity99,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:52:14 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest trying out ""Mind Blast"", a free one shot that was made during the playtest phase of DnD 5e. There are some slight inconsistencies in naming convention, but otherwise it's a great fully-prepared adventure that shouldn't take very long to get up and running. It also has the benefit of coming with 4 pre-made fourth level characters that will fill the roles needed to complete the adventure. I highly recommend it."
DnD,3dy16d,RobVegas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:42:03 2015 UTC,"It's not THAT short, there's four ""episodes"" and each episode has like 4 - 6 combat encounters, it took the group I ran a good couple of months meeting weekly.

DnD,3dy16d,trollburgers,8,Tue Jul 21 00:30:56 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same situation.  After all the money we sank in to 3.5, my group is leery about switching over.  Add to that the fact that we're still having fun with 3.5, and it becomes harder to justify the switch.  At the same time, only two of us in our group are rules people.  We love the rules and how they make the world work, even if it prevents us from doing something that would be cool.  Because the rules set the tone for the entire campaign.  (I've noticed that this is a very unpopular belief to have, nowadays.)  The rest of the group, I think, would benefit from the removal of the bloat that was 3.5.  A more streamlined, easier to use system would reduce those times when myself and the other rules-guy talk and discuss exactly how this rule interacts with that rule and leads to something awesome.  We have the Starter Box, and we are planning on running a one-shot with the pre-generated characters just to see how the game flows, and to see if the group prefers it.    But we've decided that it's either a) going to have to wait until after the current campaign is over, or b) do a time skip where something major happens (probably on the deity level), that changes reality a little bit and brings in the new status quo.  (Like the Time of Troubles in Forgotten Realms that marked the end of AD&D and the introduction of 3.5 D&D)."

DnD,3dy16d,Mechanatrix,3,Mon Jul 20 15:05:06 2015 UTC,"You and your group should atleast finish the current main story. After that your characters actually have time to change into the 5e settings ingame aswell as your players are not handicapped at there current goal. If you reached that point of transition speak with all together about what would be an appropiate entrypoint. Some players might loose abilities they had before, others gain things. So it might be best to decide on an overall entry level for everyone. So your PCs can research and adjust their other selfs. There will be problems with transforming gear, spells and other things. But it should be no big deal.  You can start using your 5e stuff and playtest it with your ""old"" group, and when 5e doesn't woirk at alle you can fall back anytime. OR, you all meet up for an extended one shot of 5e with completly new characters an then decide after that playtest to tranform your stuff..  Either way I like the 5e alot. But also came across many hardcore / homebrew 2e guys that bitch alot about ""inbalance"" in 5e that I havn't encountere yet and cant understand..."
DnD,3dy16d,MetathranSoldier,2,Mon Jul 20 14:16:30 2015 UTC,"Really all you can do is just give it a go. Maybe try the Starter Set adventure, or make something up.   My group had a similar thing, we used to do 3.5, and then I bought the 5e stuff, loved it, and wanted to give it at least one go. While the others do not like it as much, they still play it."
DnD,3dy16d,i_start_fires,2,Mon Jul 20 14:54:07 2015 UTC,We play two groups per week. One playing 3.5 and one playing 5e. When doing oneshots we sometimes go with 5e and sometimes with 3.5 depends on the dm.
DnD,3dy16d,cowsandturtles,2,Mon Jul 20 14:54:32 2015 UTC,I wish I had time to run 2 groups a week.  We can barely get our group to commit to one night a week on a consistent basis.
DnD,3dy16d,jwbjerk,3,Mon Jul 20 18:15:27 2015 UTC,Here's an unorthodox idea:  Do a one-shot where your group uses 5e versions of their characters in an encounter they've already run.  Maybe a BBEG fight.  Flavor it like an alternate reality reboot.  It would let them compare the mechanics directly without feeling like they're missing something or playing less-optimally.  It would give them a much better benchmark as to whether they like the new 5e rules better.
DnD,3dy16d,elfskin_coat,3,Mon Jul 20 15:41:45 2015 UTC,"I'm in the middle of running a several year long 3.5 campaign. The campaign has gone into epic levels and has magic littered everywhere, which makes it hard to transition to other editions. Instead, what I do with my group is we continue our 3.5 campaign, but about once a year we run a 3-4 session mini-campaign that takes place elsewhere in the world. The mini-campaigns serve three purposes:   1) The players get to influence events happening outside of the reach of the main party giving them a better sense of how the world moves when their characters aren't around.  2) The events and characters of the mini-campaigns will often change the main campaign. For example, our first mini-campaign was about a rising rebellion that was occurring in another country. Things there got out of control to the point that they accidentally opened a rift and unleashed very powerful creatures from another plane. The main party's first warning of this came from one of the mini-campaign pcs seeking powerful people to help protect her from the monster that has been methodically hunting down her friends.  3) We get to try different systems. This helps fight fatigue from playing the same characters/systems for so long, gives us a chance to play the different systems out there, and lets me experiment with different mechanics that I sometimes import back into the main-campaign.  So far we've played a mini-campaign in D&D 5e and Fate. My players have enjoyed both of them, and they left both mini-campaigns excited to return to their main characters."
DnD,3dy16d,ilikpankaks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:13:35 2015 UTC,"It depends on how much custom stuff your campaign has-- and how strictly you want to convert.  For instance I have a duskblade in a 3.5 campaign.  There's no 5e duskblade.  I could certainly play a refluffed Paladin or Eldrtich knight and hand-wave away the difference, but it will function quite differently.  It depends how important you consider the mechanics of your character.  If you are roleplay-centric you can just build something as close as you can and handwave away the difference.  There's also a lot of homebrew out there, some quite good, some really bad.    I love 5e, but I wouldn't recommend starting to convert your campaign blind.  Perhaps take a month off from your regular campaign and try a short 5e campaign- with new characters.  See how the group likes it.  If they really love it you can think about converting your campaign.  If they like it a little better, you can think about switching after your current campaign is over.  Though personally, I find 3.5 more overwhelming and unbalanced as you advance into higher levels so maybe a version conversion saves more trouble in the long run."
DnD,3dy16d,Matt_Sheridan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:16:05 2015 UTC,"We made this exact mid-campaign switch from 3.5 to 5E when the 5E PHB came out. I did it with the caveat of ""don't burn your old character sheet, if you guys hate it, we can always switch back."" Which, not one person ended up wanting to do.   I completely understand the reticence to leave all the cool splat books. When we did switch, the one point of disappointment was losing some of the cool spells/feats/etc from the huge library of 3.5 that didn't exist in 5E. The disappointment ended up being very short lived though, because for everything they'd lost they'd also gained something cool from the conversion. For my part as the DM, re-designing things was actually a really smooth process because 5E has so much less stuff to contend with. The math has significantly fewer variables going into it, making things, in my opinion, a lot easier to balance. There were certainly things (mainly monsters) I tossed and started from scratch with, but I hadn't planned so far ahead that the work was insurmountable.   Honestly, if you and your players are willing to accept a little bit of retcon, you can probably make it through fine. :) Just be prepared to play a strange hybrid of 3.5 and 5 until everybody gets a full handle on what has and hasn't changed. Take it in stride and make sure to point out ""Ah, that's how it was in 3.5, this is how it works from now on..."" as things come up."
DnD,3dy16d,hdashshh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:20:55 2015 UTC,"I loved 3.5.  Still do, and still play (along with some PF).  I tried 4th twice and just couldn't do it.  Got 5th, read the free PDF from WotC, and gave it a shot with a quick adventure.  2 sessions of towns, dungeon, and reward.  Then I got the starter set and gave it another go.  It is so unbelievably balanced compared to 3.5.  Also, for newer players, it is much easier to pick up.  The DM seems to have a bit more work (in deciding rulings and how things roll, but this was easy enough for me to overcome).  It's very general and can be applied easily and run off the cuff.  I enjoy it for my players that surprise me with ideas, along with new TTRPG players.  I reccomend running a short adventure in 5e with some friends to give it a shot. My players all loved 5e more than 3.5, along with my old veteran D&D friends that played since AD&D.  It's a fresh take that lends itself to lots of play styles. And for the 3.5 minmaxers, there is still plenty to play with, despite feats being optional. (Also, everyone gets Mobility feat! Free! Holy shit!)"

There's just way too much stuff that would get lost in translation. I don't think I could suspend my disbelief when all kinds of in-fiction stuff just starts working differently.  On the other hand, just starting up a new campaign in a new edition is no more hassle than playing a new game. That's generally something that's pretty easy to get players into."

DnD,3dzszw,erddad890765,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:52:01 2015 UTC,"I am looking at the Sorcerer archetypes and am going to modify it and post my modified version here so you can see what I feel should be changed.    Blood Mage (sorcerer subclass)  1st level Blood Offering:   Starting when you Choose this Origin at First level, as an action you may choose to expend a number of your Hit Dice in order to cast a spell (that you are normally able to cast) instead of using a spell slot. In addition, if you use half of your current HD for one spell or if you have no remaining HD when you cast the spell, you gain one level of exhaustion. In addition, a Special Dagger (it acts as a dagger, but has a blood opal inserted) may now function as your arcane focus and some sort of cutting tool as necessary for the use of Blood Mage features. This feature may only create spells of up to 7.   For example, if a 4th level sorcerer wants to use this feature to cast a 2nd level spell, the sorcerer would have to spend 2 HD to do so, but that sorcerer could not use 3 HD to cast a 3rd level spell because they do not have access to it.  1st level Bloodletting   Starting at 1st level, whenever you use the Blood Offering feature to cast a spell, you may also inflict a minor wound (1d8 damage), major wound (1d12 damage) or severe wound (2d10). This always deals damage to you and ignores Temporary Hitpoints. At level 14, this is reduced to 1d6 for a minor wound, 1d10 for a major wound, and 2d8 for a severe wound. If you do so, the amount of damage (divided by three, round down, minimum 1) that you deal to yourself is converted into Blood Points, which you can use for the spell. In addition, this wounding does not count as damage for concentration purposes (see page 80 in PHB).   -If the spell requires an attack roll, add a +1 bonus to the roll for every Blood Point you use.  -If the spell requires a saving throw, increase the Spell Save DC for the spell by 1 for Blood Point you use.  -If the spell deals damage, the spell now deals bonus damage equal to double the Blood Points you use (i.e.  if you were wounded for 3 damage, it deals 6). If this spell would deal damage to many creatures, you must divide the damage among the creatures taking damage.  -If the spell requires Concentration, you gain a number of +1 bonuses to add to your Constitution saving throws for maintaining Concentration equal to the Blood Points you use (i.e. if you use 5 Blood Points, you gain a +5 bonus). These +1 bonuses go away when you stop Concentrating on your spell, and can't be used for any other purpose.    6th Level Sanguine Shield   Starting at 6th level, your path of sacrifice has left you many scars, but also made you much tougher than the average magic-user. As a bonus action, You may spend any number of sorcery points in order to grant yourself temporary HP equal to the amount spent plus your Charisma Modifier for up to one hour. While you have these hit points, you do not have Disadvantage when casting a ranged spell while adjacent to a melee attacker.   14th level Desperate Sorcery   At 14th level, if you have no remaining hit dice, you may gain one additional level of exhaustion to cast a spell of up to 5th level (for example, if a 16th level sorcerer had 0 Hit Dice and used this feature, he would gain an additional level of exhaustion and be able to cast the Fireball spell, likely pushing him to 3 or more levels of exhaustion).   18th level Pain is Power   Starting at 18th level, once per short rest, upon taking non-magical, non-Radiant, non-Acid damage, you can choose to treat ½ of that damage as a wound for the purposes of the bloodletting ability on your next spell."

DnD,3dzobb,KCDinc,0,Mon Jul 20 21:04:08 2015 UTC,"But what if the druid (or a dual polymorphed creature) drops to 0 HP, then it comes back to its previous polymorphed form regaining full hp? Or both forms take the damage simultaneously, making him go back to its normal form?  Also, lets say he use a bonus action to revert to his normal form, he has to use it twice to cancel both forms? Or he may revert to his previous form then using only one bonus action?  Druid -> Bear -> Scorpion  1 - Bonus action to cancel (or drop to 0 HP), revert back to bear, have to use another bonus action or drop back again to 0 HP to to finally revert to normal form (having 3 HPs at once for intended purposes)  OR  2 - Bonus action to cancel (or dropping to 0 HP), revert back to druids normal form. Stacking effects can be ended simutanously using the same action?"
DnD,3dzobb,Bluegobln,0,Mon Jul 20 21:17:12 2015 UTC,"The layers eliminate one another. If a Druid has been polymorphed I am pretty sure they can wild shape to get out of it, or maybe even just return to normal form. Unless they don't have control of themself.  You can't be dual polymorphed. The second polymorph ends the previous polymorph effect completely. Some spells in the PHB specifically say that casting the spell again cancels the effect, and I think the reason for that description is to both give casters the possibility of ending a mistake and to allow a ""counter spell"" like effect if a target can cast the same spell. That's how I would rule it, anyway. If you can cast the same spell, you can do so to end the effects of the spell currently being cast, to counter it."
DnD,3dzobb,KCDinc,0,Mon Jul 20 22:02:18 2015 UTC,"I dont see that casting the spell again cancels the effect in PHB.

DnD,3dzobb,daren_sf,0,Tue Jul 21 01:04:59 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying that for me as a DM I would allow anyone who can cast a spell to end the effect of the same spell by casting it themselves (countering the other effect). The spell Mage Hand for example allows you to make the hand disappear by casting the spell again. I would allow another caster to cancel the spell with the same spell, if they knew the exact spell. The same is true with Minor Illusion, Simulacrum, and Spectral Weapon.  It makes sense. First you have to know what the spell was, seeing its effects might be enough but otherwise an arcana check needs to succeed. Then, it being a spell you know, you can do the exact same spell, right? In the case of an illusion you can illusion there being no illusion... which is to say, you hide the illusion with your own illusion spell. In the case of a Polymorph spell you can literally counter it by casting the spell to return them to their normal form, but the net effect would be to simply ""counter"" the other Polymorph. There are many other examples of spells like this where you could counter its effects with the same spell.  Its my personal opinion / ruling as a DM, not RAW."
DnD,3dzobb,Zupheal,0,Mon Jul 20 22:18:43 2015 UTC,I see. The issue was this happened in my table last week.  The druid had changed from a Bear to a giant scorpion and had spent all his wild shape. When he got to 0 HP he asked me if he had become a Bear again and i didnt knew for sure
DnD,3dzobb,daren_sf,0,Mon Jul 20 22:22:23 2015 UTC,"Actually I just spent some time looking at the relevant Druid abilities and Polymorph spell.   RAW, I think it actually doesn't specify well enough, but one assumes that all prior states are held where applicable. So if his bear form still had duration left (number of hours equal to half your druid level) he would revert to bear form with the same stats and HP as he had before.  Again my opinion differs here though. Druids have control of their shape, and as long as he is able to mentally function as himself I think your druid could have cancelled his bear form and returned to his normal self, which would override the Polymorph. In this case, however, since a Giant Scorpion has an Int of 1... he wouldn't even know he was a scorpion, he'd probably just want to munch on something Giant Scorpions eat.  And I don't think shapes should stack like that. I think you have only your natural state, and your current state. There is no layers of states in my games: you're either yourself, or you're something else temporarily and you revert to yourself when that effect ends, be it an effect you control or a spell cast by someone else."
DnD,3dzobb,daren_sf,2,Mon Jul 20 22:36:16 2015 UTC,"1) One would happen (if the Save failed). Then the next one would happen (if the Save failed). They don't stack per the rules: PH, p. 205, ""Combining Magical Effects"": ""The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine, however.""  2) Since the rules for Wildshape state that you change into ""a"" beast shape, nor do they say anything about overlapping shapes, if you switch from one to the other the first shape is gone. This also bears out with the capstone feature Archdruid. Having unlimited wildshapes that overlap would be impossible to track for a player and DM alike!"
DnD,3dzo05,The-Woop,5,Mon Jul 20 20:50:44 2015 UTC,"Depends on how into it the five players are, and how much work you want to do.  With five players, you tend to have to pit them against large hordes of enemies rather than just a few of them, so battle tends to take a while, I have found.  And then when it's non-battle stuff, it's sometimes difficult to 1) keep everyone interested in what is going on, 2) ensure everyone has a chance to talk and roleplay, and 3) ensure that everyone is working together towards a goal instead of at odds with each other constantly (unless this latter point is what you're actually going for in a campaign)."

Too many players want to play the ""well I steal and kill whenever I feel like it but I'm well intentioned"" and it comes off as the person not really playing a character. (Disclaimer: 60% of the time)  This will tell you if you're good or evil. Will your DM even allow you to play an evil character, who'll be at odds with the party?  If you're well intentioned, do you follow the laws of the land, or do you follow your own conscience? Lawful or chaotic respectively.  If you're self serving, do you follow an evil lord or do you just commit random destruction?

DnD,3dzecm,Thatguy181991,2,Mon Jul 20 20:32:07 2015 UTC,Dm would allow evil within reason (no murder hobo) but don't necessarily want to be evil. He is going to be fairly withdrawn from current society. (Steam punk era game and my guy is going to be from a small village with little to no tech. A hunter gather society) I would assume he would follow the laws of a small village. (Basic rules of respect) Stealing will probably happen without malicious intent. (food and things). The only thing dm has told us is staring in a cold weather urban enviroment.

DnD,3dzecm,Vandelay_Latex_Sales,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:29:10 2015 UTC,"The toying with them a little (not lawful evil, though.  You'd be in the Chao Neutral -> Neutral Evil corner.), but letting them go if they're too weak is more a Neutral trait.  You have to remember, it's two axes / a 3x3 grid.  So if you're having a hard time choosing, narrowing each axis down separately can help.  Based on what you've said, you're probably going to be in the Chao Good/Neutral Good / Chao Neutral / True Neutral square somewhere.  Based on the ""laws of the tribe"" bit, I'm going to suggest Neutral Good or True Neutral."
DnD,3dzecm,CowsKickAss,2,Tue Jul 21 02:05:52 2015 UTC,I'm thinking starting neutral good and seeing how he evolves from there. Thanks for being awesome. Just hit a bit of a mental block with him.

DnD,3dygmd,moonshadowkati,4,Mon Jul 20 16:01:20 2015 UTC,"I think it's good to have both. Go in with a solution in mind, but be open to the players coming up with their own solution. That way, if they come up with something creative that you didn't think about, you can allow it and the players can be accomplished. But if the players get totally stumped and are at a roadblock, you can start dropping subtle hints or find a way to Deus Ex Machina the players out of the situation so the game doesn't come screeching to a halt."
DnD,3dygmd,schwagle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:02:18 2015 UTC,"Impossible problems don't have solutions  Generally, it would be catastrophic for most DMs to even consider making a puzzle without at least thinking of a few solutions.   However, if you feel that your a quick-thinker when it comes to puzzles, then you might not need to... Or if it's a problem that has multiple right ways of dealing with it (really fuckin' obvious ones), then you also might not need to.  Situations on the other hand - You may be able to get away with not thinking about a solution. However this is very situational (forgive the bad pun) and each situation would need individual thought."

DnD,3dygmd,emenar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:19:26 2015 UTC,"Every situation in a game needs a solution, even if that solution is simply back away and come back later. Something that cannot be overcome no matter what is not enjoyable and will end with either dead or frustrated PCs.  I had a DM once who loved giving us seemingly impossible situations and we would spend hours tryingg to figure them out. One puzzle involved a musical lock with the code being ""Happy Birthday"" despite there being no reason for us to assume happy birthday existed in game. (He eventually had to tell us the answer)  Another time gave us a 30 foot long area that we couldn't go around and had to cross. Entering the field displaying any sort of concious thought kills you instantly. Apparently the monks of the temple somehow programmed their subconcious to move their bodies in a series of complex maneuvers through this field to the other side. 30 minutes into trying to figure out a better way the DMs wife threatened to strangle me. (I think our solution ended up with us mind blanking each party member and throwing them through the field while attached to a rope)  And then there was the 1 million hit point door that couldn't be hurt by anything short of a +8 weapon. We had a page long list of things we tried that did nothing to it. Our only +8s were a shield and a cursed scythe. (Worst boss fight ever since it ended up being pointless)  We overcame every one of those (somehow) but the DM had to intervene on a few occasions because the solution involved some odd thought process that made no reasonable sense to us"
DnD,3dygmd,Ryuutakeshi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:31:43 2015 UTC,"That approach backfires least when you're the ""Yes, and"" kind of DM. The more permissive you are, the less likely you are to come up with something that causes your players to get stuck.  I usually come up with solutions for quests I expect the players to solve. Even if they don't use that solution, the thought I put into it makes the situation more robust."
DnD,3dygmd,Akintude,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:18:51 2015 UTC,"I run a game that is both highly structured (my players describe it as ""their favourite weekly TV show"") but also pretty flexible in that I tend to DM by the seat of my pants and usually the outcome of individual sessions is not what I necessarily anticipated.  In my experience, having a ""solution"" to your proposed problem is more for your benefit than the players' benefit in a lot of ways. I've tried a lot of different formulas and what works best imo is for you to draw a map that has point A, point O and point Z on it and let your players fill in the other 23 letters. If they decide to end the session on Q or eschew Z entirely, that's fine, but YOU need to know what Z is to help them get there.  A backfire example: I recently did a two session jailbreak episode. My roommate helped me build this giant prison full of colourful, complicated NPCs and lots of weak places to exploit and ways to sneak around. We decided to give the episode no ""solution"" - we'd just present the information and let the players divine their escape plan from scratch.  While this DID eventually work out with some emergency rail-roading, my usually creative players absolutely floundered in this environment. I thought that they'd be glad to have so much freedom since they were always throwing away my DM proposed solutions and coming up with these brilliant third paths... but given an absolute sandbox to work in, I found that they spent most of their time trying to find to ""correct answer"" and it was difficult for me to lead them down that path because the lack of solution meant that technically all information presented was equally as important as all other information and to underline anything in particular was essentially giving them the DM approved solution (which did not exist).   They interacted with the session like it was a poorly made PS1 era-game with a garbled pre-rendered background: they had no idea what pipes were paths or what objects were clickable because ALL pipes were paths and ALL objects were clickable. ""What do we do now?"" ""You can do literally anything."" ""But what SHOULD we do?""  Not sure if I explained that well, but yeah, don't go in without a solution in mind, even if you end up not using it."
DnD,3dygmd,Herahtic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:49:06 2015 UTC,I often create situations for my players where there's no set solution. I also don't use puzzles though so that may be why it works well for me. I like to keep questions open-ended and watch the players decide on what to do.
DnD,3dygmd,pufwa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:23:58 2015 UTC,"I don't even make puzzles, but when my player think they're in one they start solving it and I just make up a solution. It works if you're quick on your toes. Just find a proper solution for the situation and reward clever thinking."
DnD,3dyfpt,Sanstitre01,3,Mon Jul 20 15:38:53 2015 UTC,"This seems potentially unbalanced depending on how easily the player has access to healing. Obviously the risk of burning HP in exchange for spell slots is a lot lower if there is a cleric nearby that can throw on a couple heals or if the player just has a few healing potions on hand. This might be something to consider before implementing this rule. Overall though the idea seems pretty cool. Maybe even cool enough to base an entire archetype off of. Sorcerer magic is supposed to be inborn after all, what is more inborn than blood?"
DnD,3dyfpt,GoodGuySomethingBlah,2,Mon Jul 20 16:14:32 2015 UTC,"Would you make it a /per dat thing? I thought that healing wouldnd be that bad because it would take two players' turn just to cast one spell. Or maybe add some bleed so that even if you heal, you keep getting hurt"
DnD,3dyfpt,GoodGuySomethingBlah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:31:54 2015 UTC,"Making it a per day could be a good way to balance it. Like once every long rest, increasing frequency at higher levels. Alternatively, you could use something harder to come by to fuel it. For instance, instead of HP loss it could constitution score damage. That would inflict HP loss but also have a lot of other consequences as well. It might be too much to take a constitution hit though, it would REALLY make it a life or death move."
DnD,3dyfpt,Rainieri,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:42:05 2015 UTC,You could solve it somewhat by reducing max health alongside with taking damage.
DnD,3dyfpt,Altair1371,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:03:49 2015 UTC,"Make it a once/twice per day thing.  He gets [level] amount of slots opened, in exchange for some decent damage to himself.  This type of action should be something you only do when there's no other option."
DnD,3dyfpt,Treberto,3,Tue Jul 21 01:01:12 2015 UTC,"Best option, in my opinion, would be to have it cost hit die. That does not do any up front damage but will make it so he can't heal as much during a short rest.  How about 1 HD per level of spell? It would be powerful but could be incredibly risky depending on how deadly you are as a DM.  At level 7, for example, he could use his hit dice to cast one level 4 spell and one level 3 spell. Or seven level 1 spells."
DnD,3dyfpt,Kindulas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:15:08 2015 UTC,"More than that, I would let him use Hit Dice as Sorcerer Points"
DnD,3dyfpt,RobVegas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:18:18 2015 UTC,"There was a book series I read a while back, like a decade or so, where the wizard traveling with the group was stupidly powerful but rarely used magic and relied on his party to do most of the fighting unless the situation was a direct threat to their lives, then he'd do some crazy magic fuckery to completely annihilate the enemies and save everyone. Turns out every time he used magic it drained his life force permanently and would eventually kill him.  It was really cool."
DnD,3dyfpt,Treberto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:43:23 2015 UTC,Thats pretty awsome. So if he used all of his HD he would just collapse until he had a long rest?
DnD,3dyfpt,Gigawicket,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:25:00 2015 UTC,"I think at 0 hit dice he just won't be able to heal during a short rest. Not sure though, I don't know the rule for what happens when you're out of hit dice."
DnD,3dyfpt,Agentwise,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:36:42 2015 UTC,"HD aren't the same as HP. He'd basically lose his natural ability to heal during short rests. But you don't lose consciousness or anything just for running out of HD. He's sacrificing his ability to recover, rather than directly sacrificing health.  You also only regain half of your HD during a long rest, so if at level 8, he used all 8 HD to regain spell slots, he would only be able to use 4 HD the following day. This helps balance it even further."
DnD,3dyfpt,jward,3,Mon Jul 20 17:39:09 2015 UTC,Just make it temporary con damage. HP/HD are nothing to a caster. make it 1 Con per spell level that hurts your Pool and makes to harder to concentrate (you know because blood loss). Have it recover after a long rest
DnD,3dyfpt,BlazeCell,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:53:42 2015 UTC,"I would mirror the sorcery point to spell slot mechanic a bit in that it requires a bonus action to do so.  I would take from the hit dice pool to power this, and also roll those hit dice and reduce the pcs max hitpoints by that amount until they are able to take a long rest."

I'm not planning on spoiling anything, and some things have actually been altered for my campaign world, but hey ... its a dream.  Hopefully someone can tell me if I'm spoiling anything, but I dont think I am, or at least not very much...  You see before you a bountiful field rich with wheat. A Bird's cry startles you then is silent, the bubbling of a nearby brook babbles secrets you do not understand, the earth beneath your feet groans in protest and gives way. You fall deep beneath the field, the rich warmth of flame reaching out to embrace you.  You are standing on a hill top staring at the clear night sky, a cool breeze nipping at your bare chest. There is a thunderous roar as the sky rips itself apart and the stars fall to the ground. In the skyless night the stars plummet into a nearby ocean and its water turns scarlet and still. Other stars fall on an unsuspecting town but no one notices. The mountain erupts in black fire and silver smoke, but no one notices. A Voice calls out for them to flee, to seek shelter, to fend for their lives, but no one notices.   A Feather. A Scale. A Golden Mask. A Wicker Doll.   The village is silent and still, smoldering in the skyless night sky.  Laughter. Unrestrained laughter echoes across the silent scene, pure and guttural.  An single lidless eye stretches across the sky from horizon to horizon, staring down at you as the laughter builds on itself, as though you are part of a great cosmic joke.  You awaken in a cold sweat, the sound of the laughter slowly fading from your mind."

DnD,3dzayf,Crossfiyah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:39:50 2015 UTC,"This is how one of the games I was in around xmas started. We were all from out of town and each was ultimately on their way to the same place, and were arriving to town about the same time.  The town was under matriachial leadership, with a curfew set for the men and things like that.  The druid (who was practically mute and very antisocial, female, Aor), and the Warlock (incredibly talkative nerd, male, Borsalino) arrived from one direction, and myself (true neutral rouge, female, Miresgal), and the barbarian (has a lion loincloth for formal occasions, male, Jerrik) arrived from the other.  The barbarian is stopped for papers, as people from the tribes generally weren't welcomed in town. The chain of misunderstandings from Jerrik, King of the Wildlands, (at least to his village) over his papers and the curfew led to Miresgal laughing her ass off at him, and deciding to follow him to the inn to keep up the entertainment.  Once inside, he nearly broke Miresgal's squishy rougish spine because she was laughing at him, but enough quick talking convinced him she was just in a jovial mood.  The party ended up bonding when two dudes in the inn starting harrassing the barmaid and being generally douchey over feeling emasculated in the town. There was a lot of scaring them with the huge barbarian, and the druid's preference for just chiling in bear form, and a hex shooting a hole through the wall, and a roll to trip them from me as they sniveled and tried to run away.  Once Borsalino patched up the wall and Aor finished scaring him as a bear, we all got together for drinks, and realised we were all headed the same way. Borsalino wanted the protection, Jerrik liked the company, Aor mostly just tolerated the rest of us, and Miresgal couldn't miss the chance to laugh at the barbarian."

Maybe they need to figure out who made the weapons the bandits were using: they know it's a blacksmith in this city (you'll need a city for this) but they don't know which one. The players will probably try to look for clues: whatever they come up with should lead them to another person, not just a new location. After a few people, they find the blacksmith in question, and are able to stop him from arming bandits any more (even though they do pay well enough.)  Or try adding politics, or trade, to the thing the players have to deal with. The important thing is: the pc's need to have a goal they want to accomplish, and the players need to know what it is. If you just throw some random npc's for them to talk to, you're not creating an encounter so much as a diversion that only takes up table time without making the game move forward.  Here's amuch longer and much better discussion on the topic of using mysteries in rpg's.   Also, you don't need to have all three pillars in every session, but over the course of the adventure they should usually be somewhat balanced.

DnD,3dvwfv,teh_captain,5,Mon Jul 20 00:04:09 2015 UTC,I'll give them a shot too! Thanks for the recommend!
DnD,3dvwfv,filouza,4,Mon Jul 20 00:17:33 2015 UTC,"Gotta back this one too. It's super light hearted and heavy on the jokes but it every episode has quite a few guffaw moments and for some reason the fact that it's a son DMing, his two brothers, and dad playing makes it super heartwarming to me."
DnD,3dvwfv,KingDai,16,Mon Jul 20 01:31:20 2015 UTC,"Though it isn't a podcast, I think Critical Role is a great weekly DnD stream. They play 5e with a little bit of homebrew rules because they migrated their characters from Pathfinder and one of them was a gunslinger, but essentially it's still 5e.  The unique thing about the cast is that all 9 of them (1 DM, 8 PCs) are pretty celebrated voice actors and it's really cool that the DM, Matt Mercer, incorporates his voice acting into his NPCs. They're funny, they handle playing in such a huge group very well, and Matt is a beast DM."
DnD,3dvwfv,vartian,6,Mon Jul 20 01:58:45 2015 UTC,I debated putting Critical Role on this list because it's a YouTube show/twitch live stream. But I really do love it (along with Titansfall). It's quickly become on of my most anticipated shows of the week!
DnD,3dvwfv,RustingKnight,11,Mon Jul 20 02:10:31 2015 UTC,Thank you for your very kind words about Godsfall! I promise I am editing new content as I type :)

DnD,3dvwfv,vartian,7,Mon Jul 20 19:03:15 2015 UTC,"I would recommend RPGentlemen, with their Kain Campaign. It's a 5e DnD podcast, comes out weekly, and is ridiculously funny. All the characters are different, stupid and crazy."

DnD,3dvwfv,vartian,7,Mon Jul 20 02:59:28 2015 UTC,I think we do a good job. We do inspirational episodes similar to DM's block ( I was a guest in their show and did a Synergy session ) and we also do edited actual plays. Check us out at www.therpgacademy.com
DnD,3dvwfv,RpgAcademy,2,Mon Jul 20 00:12:38 2015 UTC,Seconded. One of my favorites.
DnD,3dvwfv,TestProctor,2,Mon Jul 20 00:43:26 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely have to give your podcast a listen! Do you stick to one storyline, or do you go through several?"
DnD,3dvwfv,HannasAnarion,3,Mon Jul 20 00:14:09 2015 UTC,"a little of both - not always by choice We have several campaigns that are either concluded (made men - our first, some audio growing pains) or just kinda stopped (A New World ) We do a lot of 'The Trials' which is where we try out new game systems - many still in development. and we just started Field Trips which are one shots  We have an ongoing 13th age game (Secrets, Lies and the Undead) that finished season 1 and is on hiatus for a few months before season 2 starts  and we just started a new 5e game called Dead Center which have gotten very positive reviews but one of our players got caught in the middle of changing jobs and moving so we've not played for a couple months - but we are hoping to continue it soon."
DnD,3dvwfv,DarthBoseiju,6,Mon Jul 20 01:05:32 2015 UTC,"The One Shot RPG Podcast and it's Star Wars spin-off the Campaign Podcast are amazing actual play podcasts; well-edited, new games every few episodes (One Shot is a single session spread over two to three episodes), and genuinely entertaining people who often make me laugh out loud.    Not all of the games are my bag, so not every episode is great listening for me, but I'd say 85% of them are wonderful.    The Esoteric Order of Roleplayers does a lot of actual play podcasts but most impressive to me is their ongoing play through of the entire Great Pendragon Campaign... a classic game campaign following from the rise of King Uther Pendragon through the saga of Arthur, 80 years of game-time with each session being roughly one year of that.  We see characters start fresh and die young or in glory or retire or pass into legend as tragic figures, before being replaced by newcomers, all while the dramatic stories of the classic tale play out as influenced by their actions."
DnD,3dvwfv,Zorgak,4,Mon Jul 20 02:55:30 2015 UTC,"Agree on One Shot. Their Everyone is John playthroughs were the more hilarious than I ever could have imagined, I'm in love with that game now."

The DM for the flagship show has gotten iffy recently, but the pre-Solum show was amazing, as are most of the shows on itmeJP's channel in general.  My personal favorite is RollPlay Swan Song, which uses Stars Without Number (basically AD&D in space)."

DnD,3dvwfv,fire_head202,2,Tue Jul 21 07:16:37 2015 UTC,"I've given Critical Hit a few hours listen on a long car ride once and they are some really dedicated and involved players. It sometimes got a little too serious and after awhile the role play got too strong for my taste that I just lost interest. And not that it's a big deal but in the 5 or so hours I listened, they never once went into combat or any sort of encounter. I just wanted to see the capability of their characters in something other than talking to each other."
DnD,3dvwfv,CritConfirm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:06:32 2015 UTC,"I agree that they do get into the heavy RP, especially later in the series, but there's quite a bit of combat in that podcast.

Common topics are fart jokes, video games, and things happening within our team.  -D20 Debut: We debate common heroes, villains and characters from pop culture and create them into playable Pathfinder characters!  Tales from a Struggling Story Teller: DM talk where we discuss personal struggles we've had at the table and how to handle them.  Endless Dungeon: Endless Dungeon is a live experience done at conventions local to us. It's kind of hard to explain but ultimately it's a Pathfinder game done for charity!

DnD,3dvwfv,GoingInBlindPodcast,2,Mon Jul 20 15:54:37 2015 UTC,"Here’s my list...  The Dragon Fisters - Primarily a Pathfinder actual play podcast. Pure table experience with good audio and very character-driven gameplay. Slow at times, though most of the times it's mainly because the players go off on some in-character conversation.  Gamerstable: Openly Gamer Theatre - Various systems of actual play with an incredibly high production value. While heavily edited, thus removing much of the original table experience, the stories are absolutely amazing and it's more of a story experience than simply an actual play.  RPPR - If you want a ton of various systems to trundle through, then this one is for you.  They cover anything from D&D 4E to Mutands & Masterminds to Call of Cthulhu and more.  Quality is on part with most other actual play podcasts out there, as well.  Also, if you want more than just actual play podcasts then...  Gamerstable - A group of really cool guys that talk about various things in the RPG community.  Anything from various system and game reviews, to concept designs of characters and campaigns, and general ideas of gamers and player types.  Nearly Enough Dice - So long as you can get through the scottish accents, they cover a vast array of board game, video game, and RPG topics in their news. Plus, their discussions of their ""geeky week"" and idea brewing have given me an exceptionally long list of things to do in my own games.  Undergopher - From basic concepts of every essence of an RPG discussed in detail, to quick reviews of board games and RPGs, to interviews with developers, these guys cover pretty much anything and everything in the geek-o-sphere.  RPPR - This time from the off-table side.  These two guys have a very unique perspective on the RPG universe, both being in the development and design area. Their views and topics are intriguing, fun, and hilarious.  Hope these help!"

DnD,3dvwfv,Brwright11,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:46:26 2015 UTC,I recommend dungeons and randomness if you like them funny
DnD,3dyz7x,Star_Tropic,4,Mon Jul 20 17:55:51 2015 UTC,Paint.NET is what I recommend
DnD,3dyz7x,Ryuutakeshi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:23 2015 UTC,GIMP maybe?
DnD,3dyz7x,LittleBillHardwood,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:48:45 2015 UTC,GIMP is really good because you can use layers to cover things up and put each player's token on its own layer. I've done this for D&D games on a wide screen TV.
DnD,3dyz7x,thomar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:12:11 2015 UTC,"Gimp is very good tool wise. Everything is clearly labled and pretty easy to figure out. The drawing itself, and the context boxes for picking tools and switching layers are different windows, so you can fill up the entirety of your second monitor with the dungeon, and put the tool boxes on the other monitor if you'd like.  The only downside is that it takes a bit to start up with all the brushes loading and what not.  Pro-Tip: Make sure to use the option 'create new layer', not 'create new layer from visible'."
DnD,3dyz7x,capslion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:36:54 2015 UTC,Would you please expand on the differences?  I played around a little with the program and it looks really good.
DnD,3dyz7x,capslion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:30:25 2015 UTC,"Create new layer just creates a new, empty layer, either in the set background color, or transparent. You'll probably be using transparent layers most of the time.  Create new layer from visible will create a new layer that has everything currently visible stacked on top of each other in the way you currently see them in one layer. As such, you can't erase things without accidentially erasing things next to it, or move just one part of the image in its own layer, or change what's showing on top.  Create new layer from visible is probably mostly not going to be useful for you, it's just annoying when you accidentially click the wrong one, get finished draying this whole thing, and then realise that you've fucked yourself over and have to redraw it.  Oh, other helpful stuff:  If you need the map for multiple sessions, or just want to save it for possible later use, make sure you save an image as a .xcf, rather than exporting it to a .png or something. You lose the layers when you export. It should give you a warning when you try that, though.  Nameing your layers is really helpful for finding things without having to make them visible and ruining the suprise for your players, since the little preview box is so little and it can be hard to tell what's in a layer if it's not a big block of color.  Press the little eye button to make a layer invisible. Can be useful for suprising the players with enemies if you have them placed ahead of time, or putting multiple locations into one file without having to erase the last one.  You can drag and drop layers to change their order, or I think there's an arrow button for moving them up and down.  You can merge layers by, I believe, right clicking on one and merging it to the one beneath it? It is very useful for making a layer of lines, then coloring underneath (after lowing the opaqueness so you can still see the grid through the color) and merging so you don't have to be very neat about coloring."

Turns out his son was possessed by a demon that he summoned playing D&D, and he (dad) and son had a fistfight trying to exercise the demon. Son was subdued, taken to a clinic in Minnesota, where a real exorcism took place.   It was also a mental hospital, drug, and alcohol in-patient treatment center, because in addition to the demon possession, he was also schizophrenic, a drug addict, and alcoholic. Someone asked him if he thought the son's other issues were the real problem, and not D&D. No, said dad, because he stopped playing when we was released. No one really pushed the question though. The man was scary: disfigured from being kicked in the face by a horse, missing an index finger so he always pointed at people with his middle finger, and taught Driver's Ed. Man, that guy loved Jesus though. Never shut up about that, even in public school."

A carriage with an enhanced space charm cast on it.(like a giant bag of holding, except it's a carriage or wagon of holding) (so that the inside is magically huge, like the tents in Harry potter that they stay in at the quidditch world cup)  Rhinoceros mount.

DnD,3dyvba,StormWolf115,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:08:36 2015 UTC,My 3.5 party once had a splint mailed armored dire boar with a ballista mounted on Bacon Bits' back. We also had a towers held as protection on the ballista. We wrecked up until our Nordic fighter tried pulling the winch to reload and broke it.
DnD,3dyvba,Oshava,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:46:50 2015 UTC,"It depends on how creative your dm will let you be, as a warforged (which is still sorta in development) you have the unique stance that your body is made of metal and like in earlier editions your dm may let you modify yourself, maybe you could get a stronger metal custom made into a chest plate and replace yours. Or build a winch/anything really into yourself."
DnD,3dwf0v,morallygreypirate,3,Mon Jul 20 02:27:50 2015 UTC,"Graph paper's nice, compass rose is good. Looks like you've got that. Bring a straightedge and compass to help with drawing in a hurry.  Also, discuss with the party and the DM what symbols to use to signify things on the map (e.g. squares for chests, crosses for altars, circles for pillars, etc.). Developing a symbolic shorthand that everyone knows makes the map less cluttered and allows you to focus on the game instead of spending the whole session drawing.  Edit: Oh I remembered: hop down to the dollar store or big box and look in school supplies for one of those drawing tools that lets you draw different squares, circles, triangles, and all. Speeds things waaaaay up."
DnD,3dwf0v,AdmiralMango,3,Mon Jul 20 02:32:26 2015 UTC,"Alright. I'll have to dig those up before the next session. :)  The symbols I'm using are the ones our DM wants me using so they're fairly standard as far as I know. There's also a map key that didn't make it into the picture to ensure that no one forgets. :)  The longest part of drawing the maps at the moment is actually drawing the rooms/hallways out because I'm still learning how to count out the squares. Considering I at least appear to not be annoying my DM as much as the last time I was drawing the maps, I may be catching on. lol"
DnD,3dwf0v,AdmiralMango,2,Mon Jul 20 02:36:03 2015 UTC,"Hah, if your DM's fussing over how long it takes to draw a map, tell him to show you his maps, revealed as you explore. I know if my players did that I'd clam up and let them draw.  If it helps, most graph paper squares are 1 cm2, so if you can convert the distance required to that in your head, you can just measure out on a metric ruler really fast (ex: 30ft = 6cm)."
DnD,3dwf0v,AdmiralMango,2,Mon Jul 20 02:42:05 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely. It got to the point where he was even going to print his maps out for us, but then we got to this session and he had no maps because it turned out that he'd rather help me learn to make the maps than have to print them all out. lol  The main issue is just ""Well, that north wall ended in that square. Does the next south-going wall start the square below it, or the one where the north wall ended?"" The actual count is actually not too bad since our DM has to count out the squares for the distance anyway."
DnD,3dwf0v,gigaflop,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:46:50 2015 UTC,"Ah, the ol' ""boy am I too lazy to make maps ahead of time"" trick. I love having mapmakers in the party until they call me on where a wall is supposed to end and I forgot because I was making it up on the spot. If he ever says ""pocket dimension"" you've caught him with his cartographic pantaloons down. Teach him the D&D distance to centimeters trick (divide distance by five, basically) and it should go faster.  Don't forget to add artistic flourishes to your map; it's your opportunity to put some flair into the adventure."

DnD,3dxvhx,Dr_Oatker,11,Mon Jul 20 12:53:29 2015 UTC,"Well it's pretty straight forward.  Spell Components - Verbal (V) - Somatic (S) - Material (M)  If it's verbal then anything that stops the caster from being able to talk will prevent this type of spell from being cast.  If it's somatic, then they need at least 1 hand with which to point/finger-click/jazz-hands the magic into fruition. So anything that binds their hands, stops them from casting these type of spells.  Material components need a certain material to be cast - These will always be stated in the spell itself. Unless it has a cost, as far as I'm aware you can use an arcane focus as the material (as that takes away the need to have the actual material). So if they don't have access to a focus or the stated component they wont be able to cast these types of spells."
DnD,3dxvhx,Heliosra,5,Mon Jul 20 13:25:56 2015 UTC,Material Components that have a Gold Piece value and/or are consumed by the casting aren't covered by the use of a focus.
DnD,3dxvhx,daren_sf,3,Mon Jul 20 13:44:17 2015 UTC,Material Components that have a Gold Piece value and/or are consumed by the casting aren't covered by the use of a focus  or component pouch   Some added info.

DnD,3dxvhx,Heliosra,7,Mon Jul 20 13:58:14 2015 UTC,I won't reiterate what anyone here has already said. What I will do is pass along a helpful tip:  As a DM I have all my players write the PHB page number next to any spell they have prepared. It cuts down on game time for when we are not immediately familiar with the components required for a spell (or it's mechanics). Helps tremendously!

DnD,3dxvhx,moonshadowkati,4,Mon Jul 20 15:44:58 2015 UTC,"It's all in the PHB. Spells require different combinations of hand movements, words, and material agents; they may need any or all of these things. Thus, what spells you could cast in a situation where you are bound or gagged or choking all depend on that."
DnD,3dxvhx,Zefirus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:57:08 2015 UTC,"Every spell is unique.  It says on the spell list what they need to be cast.  Most spells have both a Verbal and Somatic component.  Some of those have material components in addition to those.  Occasionally you'll find spells that only need one of them, like Searing Smite for Paladins which only has a verbal, because they might not necessarily have a free hand to use a somatic component."
DnD,3dylss,Shuliak,10,Mon Jul 20 16:22:09 2015 UTC,"I feel like if you just artificially ram rust monsters into your campaign straight after he wins his shiny plate armour fair and square, that will create feelings of resentment.  Let him have some fun and be invincible for a few sessions. It's only fair, you designed the encounter in the first place. If that doesn't sit well with you, tell him he needs to pay to get it fitted before he can wear it.  Just don't automatically screw your players over because you couldn't balance the original encounter."
DnD,3dylss,Pariah--,3,Mon Jul 20 17:21:13 2015 UTC,This is a good answer. Also remember there are other ways to do damage than just attacking his AC. Use spells that make him roll saving throws.
DnD,3dylss,Rhino887,5,Mon Jul 20 20:38:54 2015 UTC,I got full plate at level 4. It's not a game breaker.
DnD,3dylss,moonshadowkati,4,Mon Jul 20 16:57:28 2015 UTC,"First off, why is it 21 AC?  Full plate is 18 AC and doesn't benefit from dex.  A shield gives +2 for a total of 20 AC.  Only way he gets that +1 is if he took the fighting style that makes him a better tank. Second, there is nothing OP about an AC of 20.  A level 1 cleric can have 20 AC with chain mail, a shield, and the shield of faith spell running.  A level 1 barbarian can have 20 AC buck ass naked if they have 16 con, 16 dex, and a shield... plus they take half damage if they do get hit.  A level 1 wizard/sorceror with a dex of 14 can have 20 ac in brief flashes with mage armor and shield.  Full plate and a shield isn't out of line with any of this. His job is to tank.  It's what he is good at.  It's the path he picked for his fighter at level 1.  Don't take that away from him.  Next level when the wizard gets fireball and does on average 28 damage to everything in a 40ft radius will you decide that the page in his spellbook that says 'Fireball' gets eaten by moths?  If not, why would you take away what makes the fighter special?  Because what you are proposing is just as ridiculous.   Look for other solutions.  Monsters that get advantage on attacks like direwolves make it more likely to hit him.  Monsters that use spells and spell like abilities don't usually target AC.  Monsters that produce status effects that require saving throws like knockdowns or fears or webs don't get countered by armor.  TL/DR: Don't be a dick."
DnD,3dylss,jward,7,Mon Jul 20 17:47:32 2015 UTC,"Don't take away his fun, at least not at first.  Crits from big monsters still hurt. I threw a bulette at my group this past weekend and it critted for 8d12+4 damage. I rolled low damage so it didn't outright kill the poor AC18 level 4 bard, but it sure as hell woke up the party.  So let your fighter have his fun, just humble him sometimes."
DnD,3dylss,Brainfried,2,Mon Jul 20 16:34:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what edition you are in but for 5th edition the rust monster doesn't actually need to hit him. If the rust monster can close into melee range then the fighter would have to make a DC 11 dexterity saving throw to avoid being touched. If the fighter fails the save the rust monster starts doing it's thing. This is totally a viable plan if you really don't want the fighter to be all suited up.   Overall though, I don't see the problem with the fighter having his tin can, just through more spellcasters in the mix."
DnD,3dylss,GoodGuySomethingBlah,2,Mon Jul 20 16:27:22 2015 UTC,Could have always just changed the knight's armor or rule that he still needs to pay to get it fitted.
DnD,3dylss,Ryuutakeshi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:35:53 2015 UTC,"There are some things about Full Plate that should be considered:   Its really quite heavy Its made for a specific person Alterations cost time & money   In general, I wouldn't let someone just slip into the armor. They need to have it sized and fitted by a professional, which could be up to half the cost of creating a new suit, so about 750 gold.  If you don't use exhaustion/weight rules I would suggest you find a way to do so elegantly. If you do it right, it shouldn't add overhead and it prevents weird abuses. In this case, wearing someone elses Full Plate only gives  AC 16 and one level of Exhaustion per day. If they want to carry it back to town, they better have a mule or some rope to bundle it up and not already be carrying a heavy load."
DnD,3dylss,Thuxle,-4,Mon Jul 20 16:47:46 2015 UTC,It's a dragonborn with 18 strength.  I think rust monster is the way to go.
DnD,3dylss,daren_sf,4,Mon Jul 20 17:02:13 2015 UTC,"""Are you sure you want to do that?""  Rust Monster is honestly a very cheap way to deal with this situation.   Let your player enjoy being in a tank and as already mentioned AoE spells won't even see that AC. Shocking Grasp, Heat Metal, etc. are all really good ways to challenge your player in combat.  Out of combat, and as long as this isn't an Adventurers League game, you can further challenge the player at night when his armor is off. Plus there's all sorts of RP moments where wearing full plate mail is not advised (seeing a high ranking official and such).   I too had a lower level player in Platemail, however this one was also an Eldritch Knight with the Shield spell. He was mostly ""Crit or Miss"" so I simply had to deal with it. After all, he didn't just show up one day and wrote ""Platemail"" on his character sheet. I made it possible for him to have it so I had to come up with viable ways of challenging him."
DnD,3dylss,Bigsharkey,2,Mon Jul 20 17:13:38 2015 UTC,You're a pretty shitty DM if you think that's the way to go.

DnD,3dylss,crypticthree,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:43:00 2015 UTC,"Using the variant encumbrance rules, that 18 STR would allow him to carry 90 Lbs to light and then 180 Lbs to heavy. Plate is 65 Lb, Chain is 55 Lb, thats 120 right there. Most starting packs weight in the range of 40-60 lbs, so 50 Lb average and now he's at 170 Lbs. That's without mentioning weapons/shields/clothes that he's carrying. Either he drops his chain and puts on the ill fitting plate and takes the exhaustion for the same value of AC or binds together the Plate with rope and carries it with Heavy Encumbrance slowed by 20 Ft and Disadvantage on ALL physical (STR, CON, DEX) checks (Attack, Save, Ability) while possibly being exhausted at the end of the day if the group isn't traveling at a slow pace.  Besides, the weight doesn't matter for exhaustion if it doesn't fit him correctly. Abstraction has its moments, but there are times when you should think about things realistically. You can ignore the encumbrance portion of it and still say ""You can't swim with it on, its ill fitted and doesn't provide full protection and wearing it for extended periods is like wearing a 65 Lb trail pack that isn't firmly attached to your body""."
DnD,3dylss,techiesgoboom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:10:31 2015 UTC,I don't even think they can hit him. What to do!!   Require stealth? Or just let him have some fun. He can only tank four enemies at the same time.
DnD,3dylss,clockworkable,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:08:31 2015 UTC,"If 5e there are tons of ways around this, besides a 21 AC isn't all that amazing anyway. Any defensive class can get 20 AC at level one, pretty much.  So how do you hurt this unhittable 21 AC beast fighter? Spells.   Don't take away his fun of getting this armor, or do a cheap trick like rust monster it away - unless it is apropos for your campaign.  Use spells that required saves. How good is this Fighters Dex or Will or Int? Have an evil Cleric command him to Grovel and watch him go prone and then have the cleric's minions wail on this prone target. Or cast hold person on him or fireball/lightning bolt/sacred flame etc.  To beat a high AC use attacks that don't target AC.  If 3.5 then use touch attacks.  Also have stealth sections. Full Plate has disadvantage (or a big gear check) for stealth.   And combats that interrupt their sleep. Can't really sleep in full plate so he'll be fighting naked."
DnD,3dylss,Wulf2k,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:23:47 2015 UTC,Make him fight casters or monsters with spell casting. He might have good AC but he probably isn't passing a wisdom check.
DnD,3dylss,ReydanDeathrain,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:26:13 2015 UTC,"Heat metal exists for this reason.  Any Druid will have it prepared and most bards as well.  If you want to challenge him for the next few levels until he should have acquired it include a bit of this in a combat and he is very challenged.  If he and the party don't interrupt the concentration he's just dead.  Shocking grasp is a great one as well.  And really, any spell that targets a save is perfect for  higher ac users in general.  I try to have about a third Tina half of my enemies as spell casters, and make sure that they have a few save spells prepared because any Mage should.  The more heavy armor. In m y party the more I aim for that 1/2.  If all of your monsters are melee types than you heavily punish every caster that doesn't dip a single level into war cleric for the heavy armor."
DnD,3dylss,ReydanDeathrain,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:52:59 2015 UTC,"Not sure if mentioned, but I think what you should probably do is put some situation in where having plate mail is also a curse, not just a blessing, example.  Say the party goes into a cave after a monster, lay it out like there is something horrifying and powerful up ahead, they'll send the fighter first, but what the party do not know, is that there is a lot of traps ahead, one that require Dex checks and stealth checks, the plate Armour will make this more challenging for them.  Don't punish a player for doing something well or try and get rid of it, try and use other means to increase the challenge.  Also, buy an hour glass and set traps with time limits."

Secondly, as other people have said, you have to play rules that your might not have before, encumbrance might have to make an appearance. Don and Doff'ing armor needs to be considered. If your party gets ambushed in the night, he wont have it on, etc.   Dont ruin his new shiny loot, plate is a sweet pickup. And dont specifically force him to lose it either.

DnD,3dylss,Gray_FoxSW20,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:58:25 2015 UTC,I essentially gave the person a mega expensive item over a relatively easy combat.
DnD,3duymg,Highlad,12,Sun Jul 19 18:54:56 2015 UTC,"This makes a lot of sense, especially if you don't come across spellbooks and scrolls often. It isn't too easy to learn new spells, especially high level ones, but it can be done.  One question though- say you are trying to learn Animate Dead, as in your example. You need 4 research points from studying just, say, undead to learn the spell? Or can you apply research points gained from studying Chromatic Orb?"
DnD,3duymg,The_Archer_of_Rohan,8,Sun Jul 19 19:36:56 2015 UTC,I'd assume you can only apply related research to related spells and that just an undead wouldn't be enough. It would have to be an undead raised by a caster. (in my opinion)
DnD,3duymg,PrimeInsanity,8,Sun Jul 19 20:00:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would agree that the undead would need to have been raised by the spell that the PC was attempting to research. In fact, you could go a step further and not tell the PC which spell they are researching. This would reflect the characters perspective and add a sprinkle of mystery to the whole thing."
DnD,3duymg,PrimeInsanity,5,Sun Jul 19 20:14:23 2015 UTC,Yes I'd agree it would be a good way to mitigate some meta-gaming. The player (and character) maybe have a hypothesis on what they are researching from scorched earth thinking they were researching the effects of burning hands but in the end realizing it is chromatic orb instead.    On that note I feel 1 research point per spell level may not quite be enough though if you know a related or compatible spell you may be able to either get a bonus to rolls or reduced research points required. But I am a fan of complex yet intuitive systems.
DnD,3duymg,The_Archer_of_Rohan,2,Sun Jul 19 20:30:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just seeing a random undead shouldn't really tell you how to cast Animate Dead."
DnD,3duymg,The_Archer_of_Rohan,6,Mon Jul 20 03:07:59 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, I hadn't thought about transferring points from one spell to another...  I would probably rule that research points are non transferable. So if you were researching Animate Dead and wanted to begin research on Chromatic orb, you would not be able to move those points over to speed up your research. Though it would be entirely possible to research both spells at the same time, they would each have their own, segregated research points. You could even spice things up and say that a PC can only be in the progress of researching up to a number of spells equal to his/her wizard level.  As for the material needed to gain points, watching the undead for the needed time or studying their bones shortly after they have been re-killed. Or if there is a library full of books about necromancy or a senile necromancer that can't quite remember how to cast his spell, a PC could make the research roll there."
DnD,3duymg,The_Archer_of_Rohan,3,Sun Jul 19 20:01:43 2015 UTC,"Good, I don't think they should transfer. A pretty solid system, I think. A lot is up to the DM, though, about what counts as research material."
DnD,3duymg,Nerdwonster,2,Mon Jul 20 03:09:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. It means that you can adapt it to different situations and have your PCs chip in as well.  As long as the DM is using common sense and not allowing a PC to research Wish because they threw a penny in a well, it should work fine. :D"

DnD,3duymg,eriktheguy,5,Mon Jul 20 13:54:00 2015 UTC,"Another price may be a gold requirement, just like recording a spell from a scroll or spellbook. Maybe double the cost the PHB requires, and if the wizard is specialized in the school that the spell belongs to then the time rolled and cost is halved."
DnD,3duymg,renadi,3,Sun Jul 19 19:46:30 2015 UTC,"I like it! Might indeed incorporate something like this to my group.  One idea is to lower the points needed if the spell is one that falls under your Arcane Tradition. Like half spell level (rounded up). So to research a 9th level evocation spell when you have chosen the Evocation Arcane Tradition, you would need 5 research point instead of 9."
DnD,3duymg,sother2,3,Sun Jul 19 20:33:15 2015 UTC,"Would access to a library count as a research opportunity? It seems like a wizard might think ""Ah, this makes sense, but I need to do some more research."" And trot off to find some books of knowledge.

DnD,3duymg,Mr_Industrial,2,Mon Jul 20 01:07:49 2015 UTC,"I think that would be fine, this seems like something that would work really well in a structured game where everything is short term, but I'd say you would require witnessing the effect in person before you could do library searching, and each library could only be used once per research success or fail. Otherwise if your character had a week off you could basically learn all level one spells, or practically all spells..."

DnD,3dyg7d,solojin,5,Mon Jul 20 15:42:29 2015 UTC,"Might not be a bad idea to just blatantly steal from the Fate system. Inspiration is pretty much ""fate points lite"" as it is, and could be strongly improved by getting rid of the ""lite"" part.  What this would mean, first off, is that players wouldn't gain inspiration just for roleplaying their characters. They'd have to do stuff that actually affects the direction of the game and isn't in their characters' best interests.  So if a PC has a trait like ""I've got a short temper"", they're not going to get inspiration just for snapping at other PCs in intra-party roleplay. But if their short temper gets them into a fight with the city guards or something, that would be worth inspiration.  Another change would be that the DM could suggest opportunities to gain inspiration. Like ""So are you cool with these guards hassling you? You've got a short temper, after all.""  I'm also inclined to let players stack up inpiration points rather than just making it a binary ""inspired"" / ""not inspired"" state. Of course, to keep players from hoarding them, inspiration points should probably just disappear at the end of a session. Use 'em or lose 'em!  Finally, I think the most effective thing you could do to improve inspiration would be to give it more uses. Advantage is lovely, but why not also let it impose disadvantage? That could rescue a lot of PCs from potentially deadly critical hits, and keep save-to-resist spells from fizzling out uselessly.  Also, following Fate again, you could let players spend inspiration points to declare minor details about a scene or even the setting. So stuff like ""I think there's a guy I know at the back of the bar. He fences stuff for me, sometimes."" or ""How about if kobolds are terrible swimmers and generally afraid of water?"" would be valid things to propose, although of course it would be up to the DM to approve them.  Taking it further, you could even let it work as a replacement currency for some of the other resources in the game. Maybe a player could spend inspiration to get the effects of a short rest in just one minute. Maybe it could restore a spell slot or replenish hit dice.  Of course, all of this together will likely have some pretty profound effects on the way your players approach the game. They'll be much quicker to complicate things for themselves and veer off in unexpected directions, so your own plans should probably be simple and flexible in order to accommodate this."
DnD,3dyg7d,Matt_Sheridan,2,Mon Jul 20 16:53:46 2015 UTC,"I think I should get the Fate Corebook sometimes.

DnD,3dyg7d,MagusLech,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:56:07 2015 UTC,"Thinking about inspiration in a disjointed way is much better IMO.  I've repeatedly said to my players that Inspiration is like XP and levels... You as a player knows about it, however to your character - It doesn't exist.   Whilst I've left it in, I use it rarely; There has been one session in my current campaign where no-one gained Inspiration. And on the average session, only 1 person out of my 6-man group is awarded it.   Nothing sucks from the player perspective about being able to gain Advantage on a roll. That's fine enough as it is. As a DM, you should feel free to remove it completely from the game if you don't like it. That's your call. Putting in a replacement for it is futile IMO.   I'll tell you what actually sucks - Players who look at it as something they can achieve and overly focus on it - Which makes the RP forced, which normally ends up being shite RP. Only the DM's need to focus on it; A player needs to forget it fuckin' exists, until they gain it."
DnD,3dyg7d,Heliosra,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:16:01 2015 UTC,As someone who has yet to ever receive any inspiration points I must say I'm fine with that as it seems to be only a minor reward as it show be. But then again I roll high on average any way so the advantage is really needed.

DnD,3dyg7d,Derp_Stevenson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:42:41 2015 UTC,"I like to use inspiration as a way to encourage roleplaying, but not just related to your traits/bonds/etc., and I like to have it happen in the moment.  So this is my version of inspiration:  ""Rather than granting an inspiration die that you hold on to and consume later to give yourself advantage, inspiration will be granted and used on the task for which it is earned.  E.g. Character is attempting to make a Persuasion check to influence someone, and does a good job roleplaying the situation.  GM grants inspiration to that check, and the Persuasion check is made with advantage.    It's my intent to reward creative roleplaying in and out of combat using inspiration.  If your character gets it in her head to make a running leap and grapple an enemy to hold it in place so it can't reach the injured mage, describing that in an interesting way may get you inspiration and thus advantage on the check to grapple.    The idea is to foster creativity, fun, and role-playing at the table, rather than just give you an on-demand advantage once in a while."""
DnD,3dyg7d,Treberto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:14:37 2015 UTC,"I only award inspiration for truly inspired acts that are also roleplay based, not just for roleplay. I did this with a group of all new players and it really helped them think outside of the box, as well.  Example: Wizard in the group liked randomly fire bolting things but very rarely did this ever lead to anything apart from a fire bolt hitting a wall and fizzling out, or a barrel of salted pork lighting up and smelling like bacon. Sometimes negative things happened, alerting guards etc. So he learned to be more cautious with his random fire bolts.  Until the spider's lair in a small abandoned building. It was covered in webs, practically impossible to traverse or search. So, in a moment of inspiration, he fire bolted and burned the webs down, leading to a much easier time for the party as well as some loot.  So for aiding the party in a unique way while also role playing his fire starting tendancies he was awarded an Inspiration Point."

DnD,3dyc7w,moonshadowkati,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:17:03 2015 UTC,"In my current campaign, a paladin who was resurrected using a necromancer's lab equipment ended up with a bear soul fused with his and became a wearbear.   There were some pretty significant disadvantages from the change. First of all, he didn't have control over when he changed to start. Every night he automatically changed to full bear form, and had to make a DC15 wisdom save to avoid going on a rampage. We managed to avoid him breaking his oath, through good party planning and getting away from civilization, but it wasn't easy. The party almost starved because it was winter and the bear ate most of our supplies while we were out in the wild.   Until he succeeds at 3 consecutive wisdom saves, he didn't have the ability to use hybrid form at. After making the saves, the DC to avoid going bear at night drops to 10. Another 5 consecutive saves allows him to avoid transforming at night at all.   When he does transform, none of his equipment changes size with him. This is an especially big deal as a paladin because he had plate armor at this point in the campaign. To change without being crushed in the armor and taking 4d6 bludgeoning damage (before becoming a hybrid and gaining the damage immunities) he needed to make a DC 20 Str save to break free, destroying the armor in the process.   Considering that the paladin already had 18 Str, much of the party's combat was indoors where being large limited his movement, and a good chunk of the enemies being fought had access to magical damage of some form or another, he wasn't significantly more powerful than the other players."

DnD,3du2lj,thedragonsword,18,Sun Jul 19 22:03:51 2015 UTC,"Obsolete Warforged!  You were amongst the first of your kind constructed in this world, a prototype, and thus many of the features that became standard to later models were never installed on you. Like speech.  Lacking the more complex emotional self-awareness that other Warforged possess, you warred as a silent tool for many years, knowing no better than being walking artillery.   You would have been allowed to break down and pass on like the rest of the first generations if not for a kindly soldier who took pity on you. He performed the best repairs he could, took care of you and bought a chalkboard and chalk to hang around your neck so you could communicate with others in your regiment.  With that he became your friend, and taught you to think beyond being a disposable weapon. Opening your eyes to the world.  Though he is long dead now, it was his will that all his wordly savings should be invested into eventually paying for your freedom.  Now your body is ill-maintained and failing in places, but your simpler mind is still young and curious about the world around you. You are a free creature and you have dived into adventure seeking wealth and exotic metals. As you conquer dungeons and gain both you will be able to regain your former strength. And you willl need to do so in great amounts to realize your ambitions, of commissioning the retrofit that will give you the body you should have been born (made?) with.    But most of all you harbor the deep desire to pay back your debts to the descendants of your soldier friend. For it was his family who were left wanting to grant you such a precious gift.  You still use the same chalkboard from all that time ago, and have had it magically mended many times. Only when you have your speech shall you finally give it up, to leave your final message to your friend upon his old grave.   'THANK YOU'"

So with impending boredom looming on my day I decided to write a short backstory that can fit any class.  Now that I've wrote it I feel like using it myself but do feel free to use it.   ""I write these words down as it is the only way for me to speak.  I have lost all forms of verbal communication.  The languages I once knew are now lost to me.  Not that I have forgotten them but it’s been so long since I could speak them that they have faded away to the far corners of my mind.  Only the letters remain to me.  When I first sacrificed my voice I became inclusive and hid from my neighbours and friends in shame of what I’ve become.  How can anyone remain friends with a freak who has no voice? But it was worth it to save my wife from certain doom.    As I write it has been 6 years since I last heard my voice, and I cannot bear it anymore.  Since the events that unfolded so long ago I have been a burden on you my dear.  Every day since that fateful night you have worked to feed us both while I have done nothing.  I’ve stopped you from having a family, from having true love, because I weigh you down with the burden I most bare.  How can I give you life, yet then take it away from you so cruelly?   When you find this letter I will be gone from your life.  I have not forgotten who I once was before this mess. The times we have spent together in our lives are some of my most treasured memories I will forever bear even into the total abyss.  I am sorry I could not stay but I believe leaving will help us both.  I beg of you to move on from me and find a new husband who can do better than what I could. It breaks my heart that my last action of love to you will cause you unbeknownst pain. Remember though that I will forever love you with a love so strong it cannot be expressed with words.  Once more I am truly sorry.   Love your ex-husband (insert name)."""

In fact, looking at it again, this sounds like a very classic paladin.  I ahould mention that your saving throws are poorly chosen. Str and cha are uncommon saves. Every regular class has one common save (dex, con, wis) and one uncommon save (str, int, and cha)."
DnD,3dy00d,Ryuutakeshi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:24:40 2015 UTC,"Do you mean I should compare the ~90 abilities/spells to bard/paladin spells for balance? I don't really want to restrict them to levels so I'm looking for other methods to make them relevant at all stages of the game.  The paladin seems to have additional damage on attacks but nothing like the spear mastery, which is in my opinion at least 50% of a paragon. Since I want to stay as close as possible to original paragons it feels kinda bad to just be the paladin but ranged.  I didn't know this about saving throws, thanks, what do you think would be a fitting combo?"
DnD,3dy00d,Ryuutakeshi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:19:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, anytime you try to do a conversion to a new system you have to make sacrifices. You can already play a spear and shield paladin or valor bard (or war cleric). If you want better crits, then you play either a half orc, a barbarian, a champion, or a mix of the three. If you want tankiness, you go heavy armor and hp, If you want ally support, clerics, bards, and paladins all have abilities for that. And 5e allows relatively easy mixing and matching between classes.  If you are set on being a spear master, work it out with your DM. By the book, a spear master will perform consistantly worse (dpr wise) than a greatsword wielder. There's also the fact that you can only carry so many spears so you won't be throwing them forever. And ranged tanks are difficult to pull of in DnD since tanks work best in melee actually tanking.  I'd recommend cha and wis. Same as paladins."
DnD,3dy00d,jmartkdr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:04:21 2015 UTC,"Paragon was easily my favorite class in GW, and I'm going to say that paladin with a spear is probably the best bet for a spearmaster paragon.   Weapon mastery from GW just doesn't translate well into 5e; the numbers are far to small to allow for those kinds of small differences to work. Also, melee charcaters don't get special abilities in most cases, they might get a couple tricks but for the most part you'll do damage by making a standard attack, not by using a skill. But with a custom 1d8 one-handed spear (basically a refluffed longsword; totally balanced) and shield you can come damn close. Not really a ranged character without a magical 'teleports back to your hand' spear, but otherwise that's the closest.  For a support paragon, valor bard is already there for you to use as written. Just add a devotional bent to the character; maybe take the acolyte background? War cleric could work too.  In general, though: 5e characters are a lot less magical than GW characters. A GW character is much closer to a hybrid 4e character. If you're joining a 5e game, that's just something you'll have to get used to."

When your bros get to 1/3 hp they could radically change tactics, or even the terrain.

DnD,3dxr5v,American_Genghis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:28:07 2015 UTC,I'd say it's a 9:1 split for in character. I only go third person when I need to clarify something.
DnD,3dxr5v,Ryuutakeshi,0,Mon Jul 20 14:32:39 2015 UTC,First Person all the time. I've even talked to people at the table in character.

DnD,3dtweo,Mother_Cunter,5,Sun Jul 19 12:40:53 2015 UTC,Dankeschoen!
DnD,3dtweo,Alrik,7,Sun Jul 19 16:26:14 2015 UTC,"http://deepnight.net/tools/tabletop-rpg-map-editor/  That's what you're looking for.  I suggest making a big ass bookmark folder for all the good tools, like kobold fightclub, donjon, inkarnate and music options."

DnD,3dtweo,PolandStronk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:28:22 2015 UTC,"Basically, yesterday I found a lovely mapmaker that's very simple and very elegant, and I made and downloaded a map from it, but I then cleared my history, and can't remember what it's called."
DnD,3dtweo,The3rdCraigRobinson,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:38:02 2015 UTC,"Zuul?  No, wait... that's the Gatekeeper."
DnD,3dtweo,Alrik,3,Sun Jul 19 13:20:12 2015 UTC,"There is no mapmaker, only Zuul."
DnD,3dtweo,sypersonic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:25:55 2015 UTC,Not Zuul? Then die!
DnD,3dtweo,ajchafe,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:54:48 2015 UTC,How have I never seen this? Pretty great little map editor.
DnD,3dtweo,Zefirus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:51:46 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is nice.  Thanks for bringing it up.  I'm going to use it in my roll20 campaign I'm about to start."
