GetMotivated,3e2vla,121_Gigawhats,2,Tue Jul 21 19:04:12 2015 UTC,"You guys are having a weird argument right now. /u/jceez touches closest with his comment. Everyone has advantages and disadvantages to their situation. Your work ethic plays into your chances of success, but it's not a simple interval scale. Some people work hard their whole lives and never move anywhere on the socioeconomic ladder, some people are born into wealth and have to actively work at sabotaging it in order to fail (Robert Durst is my favorite example). Just because you may never succeed doesn't mean you shouldn't try your hardest, because your chances of succeeding are practically nothing without any effort unless you're in some beautiful situation that lets you take a hands-off approach to your whole life. But you can't measure how hard someone has worked by how much they have achieved at just a surface glance because sometimes their achievements aren't their own and more often their achievements are things you can't quantify. That's why it's important to stay motivated and try your best, but also not to rip others down just because you don't think they're trying hard enough. You don't know their limitations. It's better to see if there's a way you can help pull them up."

She doesn't have a holster but rather than ""mexican carrying"" her Series 70/Detonics 1911 hybrid in the front of her waistband or small of the back as is common in film she keeps it at the 4 o'clock position, she's carrying it in Condition 1 (round chambered, hammer cocked, safety on), her Weaver stance and high grip are absolutely superb (notice how she's not tea cupping the grip with her left hand but rather her thumbs are 'spooning').  She also legitimately picked the lock on her cell door at the insane asylum (which she insisted she do). Bitch went above and beyond what was necessary to learn for a movie and you have to hand it to Cameron for giving his actors the resources and encouragement to do so  In that movie neither Linda Hamilton, Arnold, or Robert Patrick ever flinch while firing and that's something plenty of trained and experienced shooters can't avoid.

GetMotivated,3e2vla,3226,9,Tue Jul 21 17:08:41 2015 UTC,Not necessarily.  I work with targeting systems and weapon sights.  A lot of systems use lasers for rangefinding and alignment.  It's generally some sort of near-infrared laser paired with a night-vision device so the laser isn't visible to the naked eye.  Sensor feedback from the laser can feed real-time data into a ballistics computer.  But the real answer is probably because lasers look cool on film.

In Arnold's case, given where and when he served, it was probably a bolt action Mauser or something similar (which I'm sure you'll agree isn't really the best preparation for a role as the Terminator). On top of that, most of his time in uniform was probably spent doing actual military stuff (drills, standing around, standing at attention, standing in guard duty, marching with gear, skiing with gear, cleaning stuff, picking stuff up, putting stuff down, rinse and repeat)."

GetMotivated,3e0l5u,Diodon,4,Tue Jul 21 16:16:02 2015 UTC,Isn't this less of a motivational statement than just a description of getting old?  If taken as a motivational statement it would imply that we should withdraw from anything we deem might cause conflict.  Avoid challenging popular beliefs and attitudes.  Distance ourselves from those who see the world differently.  Take the comfortable path over the challenging path.
GetMotivated,3e0l5u,MassiveWasteOfTime,4,Tue Jul 21 14:48:36 2015 UTC,"For those who hate fuzzy words.   I no longer have patience for certain things, not because I’ve become arrogant, but simply because I reached a point in my life where I do not want to waste more time with what displeases me or hurts me. I have no patience for cynicism, excessive criticism and demands of any nature. I lost the will to please those who do not like me, to love those who do not love me and to smile at those who do not want to smile at me.  I no longer spend a single minute on those who lie or want to manipulate. I decided not to coexist anymore with pretense, hypocrisy, dishonesty and cheap praise. I do not tolerate selective erudition nor academic arrogance. I do not adjust either to popular gossiping. I hate conflict and comparisons. I believe in a world of opposites and that’s why I avoid people with rigid and inflexible personalities. In friendship I dislike the lack of loyalty and betrayal. I do not get along with those who do not know how to give a compliment or a word of encouragement. Exaggerations bore me and I have difficulty accepting those who do not like animals. And on top of everything I have no patience for anyone who does not deserve my patience.   Strong words, but a possible path to self love if you ask me. Not that you did."

GetMotivated,3e0l5u,welearntolive,3,Tue Jul 21 13:22:57 2015 UTC,"Actually... I meant it as a negative. Self love as narcissism.  However, I was only thinking of myself and those around me. Most of the people I know could use substantially less self love, myself included. I never thought of the other extreme. People who don't have enough.  I suppose the quote pushes in one direction, but like everything else, life requires balance. So it's good for those who don't have enough, but dangerous for those who have too much. The only difficultly is determining where you are."
GetMotivated,3e0l5u,MassiveWasteOfTime,2,Tue Jul 21 13:44:38 2015 UTC,"I read this great article the other day that addresses something similar - the difference between strong egos and big (i.e., weak) egos. Self-obsession/narcissism could be attributed to a big, weak ego. But true self-love, self-esteem, and self-acceptance are signs of a humble and strong ego."
GetMotivated,3e0l5u,welearntolive,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:01:46 2015 UTC,"...but how do I know which is which? I like myself, is it genuine or is it a defense from weakness? Would I even know the difference?"
GetMotivated,3e0l5u,Kush_McNuggz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:08:00 2015 UTC,"Good question! I'm currently learning the difference too. I think that article addresses it pretty well. Do you often feel rejected, offended, angry, guilty, or like a victim? Or do you accept things as they come, act with resiliency, and habitually extend your self-compassion to others? Someone with a weak/big ego sees the world, both external and internal, as a threat (usually subconsciously) and reacts to it in that way. Someone with a strong/humble ego generally feels safe and secure, even during a fight with a significant other, after getting fired, when someone cuts in front of them in line, when they get downvoted on reddit, or when they're having a bad hair day.    It seems like the person who said the quote that OP posted has a big ego, that is, a weak ego masquerading as a strong ego. It is perfectly, 100% absolutely okay to want to associate with people you love and who love you (that is a sign of a strong ego, because you know your worth), but someone who feels as if they MUST have their world built exactly the way they want it and won't tolerate anything else (viewing other things as a threat), actually probably has a pretty weak ego.    The truth is, if they had a strong ego, nothing would phase them. Nothing would be able to disrupt their happiness. The person in the quote is obviously very offended by many things in life and allows those things to disrupt their happiness."

Unfortunately, not every dataset lends itself to comparisons that are as simple and immediately visible as ""this line is below that line."" Given the lack of perfect presentation for this data, this circular presentation seems to be reasonable. You have a brief moment where you think the people on the inside sleep less, then you realize that is wrong and switch to angular comparisons instead of length comparisons. Perhaps it could be accompanied by a small bar chart of sleeping lengths, but I don't think replacing the circle provides a reals improvement."

It's silly to imitate them, hoping that some of their genius will rub off on you. I doubt any of the truly great people ever sat down and thought about how to get motivated. Motivation comes all by itself when you're passionate enough, and they probably didn't choose their passions. They were instead consumed by ambition and the desire to self-actualize - their innate genius had to find a way of expressing itself.   You'll probably never be a creative genius. You won't. You would have already seen it if that potential were there inside of you. It's not depressing to admit that, because whatever you are, you're probably fine. If everyone could be outstanding, if we could all be great, the word would be meaningless and ""great"" would just be average - greatness is by definition extremely rare. But that's okay. Just focus on being the best version of yourself you can be.  Here's how to do that: read a lot. Learn new things constantly. Get outside of your comfort zone. Don't waste time - make sure your free time is nurturing. Try to work at a steady pace, stay disciplined, and always try to improve yourself. Listen to your inner voice. Stop comparing yourself to others and work hard for your own sake."

There was a time in my life that I was very suicidal because I didn't want to keep living the way I was feeling. I even secretly told my family goodbye in my own way with out them knowing it was my final goodbye. When the time came to end it all I decided to check myself into a mental hospital instead.

GetMotivated,3du7sn,zoingk,4,Mon Jul 20 12:08:41 2015 UTC,How ?
GetMotivated,3du7sn,CapricornAngel,9,Sun Jul 19 23:14:36 2015 UTC,"I had to let go of the negativity that was strangling me.  It messed up with my mind that I was not thinking clearly.  I had these feelings for years, it wasn't just a passing phase or a sad part of my life that I was going through.  Going through a depression is physically and emotionally draining.  Even on days that should have been the happiest of my life, I felt like I didn't deserve to be on this Earth.  There were many things in life that I had to come to terms with.  I could not change my abusive childhood or erase the neglect that I had endured.  If an animal is abused all of its life and has no social skills, it just doesn't immediately know how to behave correctly and feel at ease in its new social environment.  I had to learn to forgive myself for all of the social graces that I lacked, and even cringe when I think of all of the things that I did wrong that most people take for granted.  Recognizing that it was okay for me to feel sad, it's just that it shouldn't last for years.  I embraced poetry as an outlet for my sad thoughts that I used to be too afraid to share with anyone.  I never owned a diary for the fear that someone would read it, but the poetry felt like I could clear my thoughts, but in artistic way.  My depression would overrun my thoughts to the point that I wasn't thinking clearly.  I had to start trusting my own instincts and stop listening to the negativity and toxicity in my life - including dumping friends that I have known for years that just took advantage of my friendship.  I had to learn to truly love myself and recognize that when true friends love you, they will not want to take advantage of your friendship just because you are considered good-natured and kind.  My depression started to go away when I started taking control of my life.  It was not one thing, but many things over the course of a few years.  I left several jobs that I hated being at and I finally pursued art school.  I did not enjoy art school as much as I thought I would, but it was a dream of mine and instead of still being bitter that I never tried it, I am happy to finally have gotten that opportunity.  Also, I love the job I am currently at - it makes a big difference considering how much of your time you spend at work.  When the negativity feelings creep in, I will stop it in its tracks and ask myself, ""Why am I feeling this way?"".  If there is nothing in my life that I legitimately have a reason to feel sad, I flood my brain with positive thoughts and what I have to be grateful for.  It's a challenge, but it can be done.  This is a powerful motivator to win - it's like fighting an internal devil that only wants to bring you down.  I'll remember the relatives that I miss, but I am appreciative for having met them and felt their love.  This is one example of how I turn my negative thoughts into positive ones.   I will leave my home.  I'll look up at the sky and be appreciative that I still have my sight and I can see the sky and see the sun, moon and the clouds and I can still breathe.  Instead of focusing on what I don't have, I'll focus on what I do have in life - a few remaining family members still living, a few loyal and trustworthy friends, a job that I enjoy going to work every day (even though it is not my dream job, I still love working there) and I am free. I am free to roam, I am free to take my car wherever I want, I am free to write the next Great American Novel.  To be free is a luxury that many people in this world do not have.  The mind is a very powerful thing.  If you let it, the effects of depression will completely take over you.  Life is hard, life is difficult, life is not easy and I conquered this lingering sadness that gripped me for many years until I took ownership of my emotions.  When I felt very sad, it was almost like PTSD and I would remember many difficult times in my life.  I would remember some of the worst experiences in my life that no one should ever have to go through.  But it's the past and I cannot change the past.  I can only live for myself now.  I have never done drugs or abused alcohol, even though many people have gone down this route to mask their pain.  I do not feel that a therapist can help depression unless they have gone through it themselves.  They may read books and have taken tests, but I do not feel comfortable being judged by a therapist with only textbook training.  When I feel depressed, I literally feel sour inside and when I am feeling happy, it's like sweetness - I call it lemons versus cherries.  I will recognize it more when I feel the sad feelings creeping in that I will literally fight it with my mind.  I will start to think of happy thoughts, I'll call my friends just to hear their voices at the end of the line or most importantly, I'll go outside.  The longer that I am in my home, it feels like the world it going on outside my walls and I am not a part of life - kind of like cabin fever.  Every once in a while, I'll think about Robin Williams.  He was hurting so much on the inside but he couldn't comfortably tell anyone of the internal torture he was going through.  He didn't want others to understand his sadness.  There is nothing wrong to admitting to the world that you are not perfect.  Nobody is.  It's what makes us all human."

GetMotivated,3du7sn,wtfisthepoint,2,Mon Jul 20 00:25:44 2015 UTC,I was trying to come up with a good way to articulate something similar to this. People do and say shitty things out of weakness and ignorance. They are not intelligent enough to see how their actions effect people or they simply have their own issues. I used to be bothered by these things too but it's much easier to just pity these people and their hateful existence. They are clearly not healthy or happy and most likely suffer from their own miserable nature more than anybody. I hope everyone who is struggling can rise above it and focus on the positive. I can't imagine what this must be like but it makes me really happy to see the internet connecting and helping people like this. Its freakin' awesome actually.

GetMotivated,3du7sn,WATisISO,62,Sun Jul 19 15:30:32 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I remember when I first discovered subs like /r/depression or /r/bipolar, I would spend hours reading people's posts, sometimes laughing (because I couldn't believe others had the same screwed up life), but most of the time crying (because I didn't feel so alone). Before I went to the hospital, I was at a point where I could no longer function. I stayed in a room inside of my mom's house and drank as much as I could in order to become unconscious. When I would pee the bed thanks to medication like trazadone and seroquel, I didn't give a shit, and didn't change my clothes or shower for a month sometimes. My sister with bipolar started doing the same thing before she committed suicide in 2002. She was 25.   To be honest, I am manic right now, but more of a controlled manic. I know that this will fade, so I'm trying to do as much as I can to defend myself from the crash that may follow. I feel like letting others know that they aren't alone is the best weapon to combat The Monster when it tries to kick down my door eventually."

GetMotivated,3du7sn,Princesa_de_Penguins,29,Sun Jul 19 17:38:00 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. It felt very inevitable, which is why I didn't want to spend 20 years suffering when I would just die anyway. Last thanksgiving I was in the room I never left, and my mom popped her head in to try and convince me to meet up with the rest of my family. I had the computer playing forensic files in the background but I was just staring at the wall. The room smelled awful because I didn't shower or anything like that. She said I just looked at her and said, ""what has happened to me?"" with a blank look on my face.   The next morning she came it at like 6 am crying her eyes out. she had had a nightmare that I followed my sister, because she saw the same look in her eyes that she saw in mine the previous day. She begged me to get help, and not follow her (my sister Kara) into death. It killed me to see my mom like that. No parent should ever have to bury two of their children.   Obviously it didn't stop me from trying to end my life, but when I got out of the psych unit, I realized that I needed to do everything that my sister didn't. The fist being to talk about it. So I decided to tell the world about the most intimate parts of my life through youtube, and in response people have done the same towards us.   This mindset of mental illness and suicide as something that is taboo because it makes people uncomfortable has got to stop. This is why I do what I do."

GetMotivated,3du7sn,ThirdWorldWrapGod,26,Sun Jul 19 19:25:54 2015 UTC,"Please keep up the great work! This is important to those suffering as well as those who don't understand this disorder.   I apologize in advance for the wall of text, I want to share a little of my story for those who feel hopeless or confused as how to keep string and keep going.    I've been diagnosed bipolar since I was 13 (20 years now) when it was still called ""manic depressive disorder"". Regardless of the name, the symptoms are the same and you're absolutely right OP, ""The Monster"" is always right around the corner waiting to pull me into the downward spiral when I'm feeling manic or just plain old happy. I was severely abused(in all ways) by my father and step-mother and most partners. I always felt worthless and had zero hope for my future. I dropped out of high school at end of grade 8 after failing all my course work, I was a in drug addiction for many years running from my issues. I was content knowing this was my life and I wouldn't make it into my adulthood. I failed at 3 suicide attempts because I was meant to stay on this earth and be who I am today.    During my teens I was extremely suicidal; spending much time with psychiatric care. I never felt heard and always resisted help because I didn't want to go on with life.   As a mother since 19, I have often thought of the way my children's life's would be changed for the worst if I wasn't around. It keeps me going strong. I had severe post-partum depression with both because I felt guilty for bringing children into my life to watch me go through my symptoms every day. I thought I was never going to have children because I didn't want to ""pass this on to them"".  I thought being a mother was wrong and very selfish of me. Of course after getting help I saw the ridiculous nature of these thoughts and grew to love and adore my own beautiful creations.    Only 5 people in my life know I have this disorder, 2 of them being my children who finally reached an age where I could sit them down and explain why I react the way I do to situations and how they can support me. They're almost 10 and 13. They have always thought Mom just had anxiety or over reacted and was either really happy and everything was perfect OR everything was catastrophic.   What I've realized: they love me no matter what I feel. They give me hope to be better and do better and make better choices for us. I've had two partners (their father's) who never understood my disorder and ridiculed me. I left them both fast. I've been a single mom for most of their lives. We are an amazing triquerta of balanced people who assist others when needed and never judge.   It has taken me a long time to get to where I am today, however, I never give up even when I have really wanted to.  I struggled working whatever jobs I could just to sustain us after the divorce 7 years ago, this was hard with a grade 8 education in today's society. I proved my hard skills to employers and learned the soft ones as I went.  Then 2 years ago I became courageous enough to return to college and am working hard at my undergraduate degree in the Business program specializing in Leadership and Management. I've earned where I stand today and without fully and truly understanding myself I would never have been able to do it. I have an amazing Dr who listens and treats me according to how I wish not what the medical community says to pump into my system. Most medications make me worse so I don't take them. I would rather silently or loudly suffer and know myself than be the way the meds make me feel. I practice yoga and daily meditation by myself or with children and family/friends and journal when needed. I don't exaggerate my feelings but I don't downplay them either. Balance is the key to my true happiness.   Thanks for reading Reddit, I've never shared anything so personal and I hope my words can influence and inspire another to stay strong and keep the hope. One day we all get happy endings to our suffering.    Love and hope to you all. It does get better even when the odds seem stacked against you."

I became a mother at 19, like you I'd already had mental health issues and felt guilty for inflicting them on a child. I got severe psychosis when the baby was born and tried to jump off a high ledge at uni but a friend saw me and stopped me. My boyfriend hid my meds so I got worse, he locked me in the house while he went on tour for weeks and told all my friends to stay away. Took a couple of years but I finally ran away (with the baby) got help, found a job but it took years to shake the depression and It still grabs me every couple of months.

That was absolutely terrible of him to do and I'm glad you got the courage to leave.   Life is a constant struggle for us yet we keep at it. Our children need not suffer the way we do, yet they will watch us do so and never fully understand until they're adults.    Your son and you are just as courageous as I, and he will also grow up strong watching his Mama. Despite any struggles that hit you from time to time. Life isn't perfect and I feel that children of mental illness parents are stronger because they realize early on in life: life isn't perfect!! It doesn't just be handed to you on a silver platter. You have to earn what you have no matter what life situations you are going through. We are teaching them coping skills, even through they don't realize it.   Give yourself a hug and I hope you have a great social support circle now! Depression will rear its ugly head from time to time and each time it does know you are not alone and it will pass.    Staying off Facebook and other social media sites helps me. I call crisis lines when I really need to and am always honest with myself and others about what I'm experiencing. Even when the truth hurts. Keep you head high and keep the courageous flame burning alive. Everyone deserves to sparkle!!   HUGS"

There's persuasive evidence across many cultures that an unwillingness to admit vulnerability is the ultimate weakness, because it effectively cuts an individual off from from the healing power of community.

I'm 33 now, but the day he did it, is just like yesterday, I remember everything... He didn't suffer from depression, it was a very bad situation he put himself in.  But, that led me in to a deep depression, in which I am just now starting to come out of.  I thought of killing myself numerous times, simply because I just didn't know what to do, I was retired from the military for an injury, I had a fiance who broke up with me, when I went to watch her graduate boot camp in NJ... I flew from the west coast and was back there for 3 days, she talked to me one time for 15 minutes.  She spent the entire time with her mother in a different room than mine even.  I loved her a lot.  I moved back home, only to find my friends I had kept in touch with in completely different times with their life and not supportive in the least. I developed a drug addiction and lost 50 pounds.  I've been sober for a year and a half, and isolated myself for about a year.  Take pride in what you do and pat yourself on the back for saving that person's life!  Suicide is never the answer, you have the power to change your life, and unless you have people in your life who understand that (which is rare) it's up to you to do it on your own."

GetMotivated,3du7sn,_____l,3,Sun Jul 19 21:51:36 2015 UTC,"'The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.'  David Foster Wallace"

GetMotivated,3du7sn,Palana,2,Sun Jul 19 20:29:44 2015 UTC,"This might be too personal but I have to ask.  If you are currently in a manic phase does that mean you are not taking any medication?  I was diagnosed at 16 when I had my first episode and didn't want to believe or admit i had it.  Didn't have any problems until 25 which is the age at which onset normally occurs.  I've had to rebuild my life 4 times so far.  This last one was a ruff one I basically drank a handle of vodka everyday or two for an entire summer.  Somehow I always come out ahead after everything settles and I get back to normal me.  Some of the damage it caused though is permanent.  I've read tons online and picked up quite a few books on Bi-polar.  Somehow I never read the Wiki- article on it.  When I did it was basically like reading my life.  I've experienced and lived EVERY symptom save one or two.  I hoping now that I'm seeing a doctor every month (even though I honestly don't care for her or her nurse... ""atleast I've got a good counselor"") and on a medication that I believe works I will never have to go through another rebuild and at worse the episodes will be much less severe."
GetMotivated,3du7sn,Darkspade1,4,Sun Jul 19 20:32:37 2015 UTC,"nothing is too personal for me :) I am definitely still taking meds, but that doesn't completely curtail the effects of being manic. For instance, I am always ""up"" so to speak. I only need about 4 hours of sleep a night, and my head is full of creative ideas. I have BP2, so my cycles last about 4 months.   I really hope you can start to rebuild again. you sound like an amazing person :)"
GetMotivated,3du7sn,Cereal_Killerz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:16:41 2015 UTC,This year everything hit so fast in rapid succession it seemed like I was outta it before it started.  It was odd when the mania hit and I knew I was in it and self-aware.  I had one night of total Euphoria and believed I could do anything.  As I've gotten older I can feel it coming on but once it goes full blown.  I'm no longer in control and all rational thinking is gone.  Add heavy drinking into that and its a total train wreck.  This time it was a bit different maybe perhaps because I was actively seeking help and I had a good friend helping me through it all.  Last August I started to reach out for help but once I landed a job I put getting treatment on the back burner.  When life gets better that's when most people stop taking their meds.  I have never continuously stayed on anything until now.  I was a little dis-heartened when I read that medication will not completely take away the Episodes but only diminish their severity.

I mean seriuosly, have you ever seen a Dali? How about an Emmin? Now they may not seem like art to some, but it hasn't stopped them making shed loads of money, and becoming damned famous because they went beyond their own shortcomings and embraced what they could do, they even went beyond their own boundaries and in the end created art that is so unique and so amazing to behold that 50% just won't get it, and the other 50% will get it and not only get it but understand where the artist is coming from.  Remember there are so many different ways to express your idea of art, be it making models out of clay, sculpting out of stone, wood, etc, creating pictures by using just dots, yes dots, or little lines. Osamu Tezuka who created Astro Boy said once that he drew the way he did because he couldn't draw the smooth curved lines like the other artists he knew, and look how amazing his Manga became.

GetMotivated,3ds5sh,Feeedbaack,328,Sat Jul 18 22:59:53 2015 UTC,"Yo. I used to feel the same way. Shit sucks. A lot of people on here are very emotionally motivated: ""here is a picture of a lion with a saturated Instagram filter and some quote you've probably heard before, go get em'."" That is a good thing overall. However, I am much more logic oriented. Honestly, giving up just seems stupid rather than tragic to me. When it came to overcoming the hurdle you are currently facing here is the attitude that pushed me to do better:  1) You take a risk every single day. Every decision you take is a risk, not everything is blackjack or joining the military. When you decide to procrastinate the risk you just took is ""I am risking feeling more depressed and digging myself into a deeper hole for the guaranteed pay off of being comfortable for another day."" You are betting that your obligations will go away, and you will nearly always lose that bet. When you take them head on you are still taking a risk but it is one that is more likely to be favorable to you in the future. ""To ask this girl out I risk the feeling of rejection for the potential pay off of happiness later down the line."" You take risks every single day whether you choose to or not. The question is do you want to put the effort into placing larger bets that are more uncertain, but also have a far greater pay off?   2) Maybe you are a total failure when you try at these things. One thing that is certain is if you are going to be a goddamn failure no matter what, then what do you stand to lose by giving everything you got to possibly avoid that outcome? You don't know if its inevitable, but you know it is guaranteed to be inevitable if you give up whenever life gets tough. It is always going to be tough. Anything in this world that is worth a damn should take determination in the face of failure to achieve. I would take a possible failure over a guaranteed failure any day of the damn week. The only element you add to the equation by continuing to push yourself is a risk of success, and that is objectively better than the alternative. I don't care if you feel unprepared. Trial and error is what makes you become prepared. I don't care if you have to break a sweat. You should.  If you always just have this vague idea of becoming successful, you will never realize it. Vagueness dilutes determination. The feeling of achievement comes simply when you tangibly reach a clear and specific goal. That you are able to wake up and refuse to simply just exist for another day because it seems like a useless exercise to you at this point. Look at the specific steps to accomplishing your goal and start knocking them down one after the other to the best of your constantly developing abilities. Whether that's getting laid or becoming a CEO is your agenda.   Of course these things are up to you. You can choose to just never start because you are afraid of what might or might not happen. Procrastination isn't unique. Nowadays to me I view giving up as extremely illogical and pointless. If my life is burning to the ground anyway then I might as well start dousing the flames to the best of my abilities. Even if I manage to delay the flames for only another minute through my tireless efforts and turn to ashes regardless I still made the right call. If I am going to go down, I'm going to go down fighting. It is a minute longer than I was originally guaranteed had I just given up the moment I realized my house was on fire. Yet, more times than not we find that there is enough water at our disposal to douse the flames. The raging fire is extinguishable. We only need to start filling the buckets."

But in reality whatever you're working on is a skill just like everything else. It takes time, practice and you have to maintain it.  So it's all well and good to ""JUST DO IT"" but you have to ""JUST DO IT"" for hours, days, weeks, months, years. You don't just get a 5 minute confidence booster, ask the girl out and then sit on your ass cuz mission accomplished.

Okay you got the job, now you gotta do it 40 hours a week. Keep at it. That PB in the gym is going to take a few weeks to hit meaning your ass has to get to the gym every day and put the work in to get to it.

GetMotivated,3ds5sh,consistentstrength,14,Sun Jul 19 08:09:32 2015 UTC,"Its funny that you use the word ""patterns"". Ever heard of Aristotle? All philosophers argue different ideas about human morality and ethics; why we act the way we act, what drives us, etc. One major question involving this sort of thing in relation to the self is where it starts. Plato argues that ethics and knowledge of the right thing to do and innate; we are born with what we use, Aristotle however, disagrees. He argues that on an ethical basis humans are creatures of habit. What you know, what you do, and what you are is all born out of habit. Now Aristotle believes that the sole purpose of life is to achieve happiness. He defines happiness as the sole achievement of virtue through reliance of this knowledge to reach a state of what he calls ""Eudaimonia"" (Greek for fulfillment). It's called ""perpetual happiness"", let me explain it in other terms. When you're afraid of something the only way to get over that fear is to face it right? In doing so you become brave and in becoming more brave then before you're able to face even greater fears and become even more brave! The self is like a ball of clay, with every action you mold your character into something else. Everything matters, take this into account and you might start realize what kind of a person you are.  Observe your emotional reactions to different stimuli (even if its subtle!) and take note of it. Most important of all ask yourself 'why?'.   I use to be a shy person, unable to properly socialize or get girls' numbers but now I am a completely different person purely because of this idea. After I soon began doing this I found myself taking certain actions without thought, things I would normally obsess over in my mind and try to rationalize with logic and reason. The point is, nothing is stopping you from being the person you want to be except yourself. I know you've probably heard this a million times in commercials and in a bunch of movies but it is fact. It has changed so many aspects of my personality.   Find what makes you uncomfortable and start there. For me it was socializing. I remember being so incredibly nervous just applying to jobs because I knew it meant I had to talk to someone. But after a while the habit grew and it became something else. It may begin with disappointment but you have to keep trying. Eventually you'll realize you're making progress and from your faults you will experience intense euphoria (an incredible experience). For example, mid this introspection I struck out with a girl and i mean really struck out. It was a set-up/double-date thing with my friend at the time and I was awkward the entire time. I remember I asked him a few days later what she thought and when he told me of her disinterest I had complete inner-peace. Not with the fact that I failed of course but with the fact that I knew I tried. I knew that even though I had failed the old me wouldn't of even tried, so how would the future me handle it? Its the feeling and total awareness of becoming something else. So find what makes you uncomfortable and do it! You might very well fail, but I think the next few times around you'll get it.  I wrote a lot, pretty sure I covered all my bases. If you have any questions or even if you just need help with any of this just send me a message."

For example, ""if as I suspect XXX, then it would have to be that / it implies YYY"" and if YYY is less expensive or quicker to confirm, go for YYY first.  If that was true, XXX may have become much less of a gamble.  Sometimes there is even ""If I want to do XXX I have to know -> YYY which means -> ZZZ requiring -> AAA"" etc and AAA you can just google before going back up the chain.  Even if you get a few steps and see it won't pan out, you will have mapped out a chunk of the problem space and should see if what you learned feeds back into what you were trying to do and refine your model of how to do it.  It sounds like you have gotten to thinking there are only risky one-shot direct-hits as the way to get to your goal, and getting to your goal is the only worthwhile part of the activity of going towards it, that is probably not how it is.  Every time you get blocked, how and why you are blocked is also telling you something important about the path to the goal.  Sometimes the best way is seal the blocked area while you think about what it means, and continue around it so you don't lose momentum.  As for feeling achievement, I think it comes by ""proving mastery"" of something.  Your actions, that confirm you can make correct predictions about, and make use of the related things, generate the genuine feeling you have gained something.  You will feel that long before you reach the end goal."

GetMotivated,3ds5sh,crippledassasyn,2,Sun Jul 19 06:41:03 2015 UTC,"Once something becomes done so often and consistently, it becomes a habit and requires no effort. so the key is turning it into a habit. the reason why you fluctuate is because motivation fluctuates. we cannot be motivated perpetually and new behaviours get fight back from the mind. the key is about chunking down your tasks into smaller and more manageable steps so that you require less motivation and it becomes easier to be persistent with and thus more likely to turn into a habit. Don't try to create your outcome from a single leap. it happens in small steps. in the gym, i do not set myself a massive routine that i need loads of effort and endurance to do. i set myself a manageable routine that's focused on step 1 (fix my misalignment) before i progress. when i leave, i make sure i congratulate myself. this is super important. your brain needs to associate positive emotion and then it becomes effortless. lastly, do this new behaviour at the same time so the brain habituates to it quicker. doing your 100 pushups in the evening and then morning requires more thought and effort. doing your 100 pushups immediately after brushing your teeth ever morning quickly makes it an unconscious move. i hope that helps. Summary: don't rely on motivation. break new behaviours into smaller chunks and do them at the same time to quickly make it a habit. turning each tiny change into a habit is the key."

GetMotivated,3ds5sh,msheaven,2,Sun Jul 19 15:25:54 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of people out there like you OP, including me. I read an article somewhere, and I wish I could find it again, but it outlined this exact problem. It's basically a cycle.   You have no motivation, no energy etc. Then you get this huge burst of (unsustainable) energy and go balls out for a bit. Like ""fuck yeah I'm gonna go run a marathon!"" Then things get difficult or you rebound back into being lazy/apathetic because it's comfortable. It's a black and white, all or nothing mentality. Either I go out and conquer everything or I just say fuck it and do nothing. And if I fail then I'll still say fuck it and do nothing while completely discounting everything else that's great about you because it's not this huge super amazing thing you accomplished.  It's a very toxic mindset to be in. One of the best things you can do (as cliche as it sounds) is to keep setting small, achievable goals in the direction you're trying to go, and focus on your strengths, positives and all the small things you're great at. Maybe you can't run a marathon (yet)...but you can get out of bed every morning.   Yeah big whoop but there's a lot of people who can't, whether it's a physical or mental issue you can get out of bed every morning and start your day. Maybe you're amazing at video games. Pfft who cares? Hey a lot of people don't have the hand/eye coordination to play games especially if it's some crazy SHMUP or something or pull off world record speedruns. Maybe you were born with a certain trait like being really tall. I'm 6'5"" and people would kill to have my height but sometimes I see it as an inconvenience or don't even think about it because of my own body issues.  So yeah just try to focus on your strengths and the things you're already succeeding at (or just aren't a problem for you) and then set those smaller goals to make that mountain a bit easier to conquer. Maybe you can't just up and compete in that marathon TODAY but you can go for a jog 3 times a week. You can incorporate some sprints or push harder on that run for another 5 minutes, 10 minutes, etc. You can get advice or inspiration from people on these subreddits or in real life. And then focus on THAT. ""Hey I did another 5 minutes today. Man 6 months ago I got out of breath just jogging down the street.""   The key is to keep your spirits up and set up easy blocks to knock down to build you up to those harder challenges. Accentuate your strengths. Accentuate the positives. Compete with yourself and no one else. It might seem like a form of self delusion but so is being negative and pessimistic about everything. None of us are ""failures"" and what we do IS good enough as long as we're putting in effort and working to the best of our abilities."

My advice, read this and the articles on that sub: https://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/3dc4sy/what_not_giving_a_fuck_simply_means_with_visual/  You have to stop giving a fuck about adversity and what others think about you, and start giving a fuck about yourself. Are you unhappy in a situation? Then change the situation to what you want, or get yourself out of it. Did someone cut in line and you value integrity? Call them out, tell them the line starts back there. Learn to take yourself less seriously by asking for a Big Mac at a Chinese take-out.   Loving yourself is basically following through with your desires and dreams, and standing by your principles, while remembering that you're still another human being, so don't take yourself too seriously.  I'm pretty sure you have dreams and desires deep inside you. Maybe you're scared to pursue them. It's okay, take 1 small step at a time (rejection therapy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFWyseydTkQ), and soon enough you'll be going for what you truly want, and that's when you know you love yourself, because love is simply wanting the best for the person you love."

Except for two friends, nobody knows about me taking this test, and I wouldn't want them. Why? Because then, between now and six years, when the symptoms start, I will have to tell my about the final step I will take: euthanasia.  I put on a brave face in front of my two friends in the know, but honestly, I am so goddamn terrified. If it turns out I have the disease nothing much will change about my lifestyle. I am reluctant to date anybody because the future might turn out a lot shorter than it should, and having a child is not something I want to do with the risk of passing on this disease. But in the face of having to make a decision between actively killing myself before the disease does, or letting the disease run its course, it's tough.

I have never had a neurological disease or something like that, but for a year of my life, I crossed the same bridge every day and I was ready to end my life on that bridge. It wouldn't have been a long fall, it was so short, but I told myself if I went head first, it would probably break my neck and I would no longer have to feel the way I was feeling because I would be dead.  But I didn't and I realized that since that time, I have kind of woken up. I've started to do all the things I have wanted to do and I have learned so much.  If I had killed myself then, I would have never started to learn the 32 foreign languages that I can now read, never learned to play the guitar, never had my first job, never met a lot of funny and enjoyable people, experienced most of my college life, never gotten into my personal nutrition, exercise and weight loss, never listened to new music, never read a lot of the books I have read, never made a lot of art, never experienced how amazing it feels to love who I am, never experienced how much or how good it can feel to love someone else romantically, and never learned how to crochet.  This year I will be graduating from college and besides all those things, I am going to further involve myself with acting, which I've wanted to do for a long time. I'm losing weight, so I can have the courage to wear a bikini, and I'm going to exercise to become a little stronger and build up some muscle. I want to learn how to play the piano and I want to try kick boxing and skiing again. I want to read more novels in both English and in foreign languages and soon I will be going back packing in Europe with my best friend. I hope that with my talents and with a little time and studying, I could apply to an Ivy League university for grad school and be accepted.  All of those things, are things I have worked for for 3-4 years. A lot can be done in a short amount of time, if you don't give up, you can grow and become beautiful. So, I don't know what it's like to have a neurological disorder, but I know what it's like to stare down at your death every day, at least a little bit.  I really hope that if your results come back positive, you choose to live, because once you get to the other side, of choosing to live, you look back and you see that if you had killed yourself on that day all the things you would have missed. All the joy and all the sadness that wouldn't have been your's to have if you left the world then."
GetMotivated,3dqdom,nerfoc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:17:07 2015 UTC,"The reason I am choosing to end my life (ONLY IF I HAVE THIS DISEASE!), is because my body will gradually shut down due to this disease. It slowly destroys my brain due to the faulty creation of a protein. The first symptom is depression, then loss of muscle control, which results in involuntary jerking of the muscles. I will no longer be able to walk, to talk, and eventually eat. I will have to drink all of my food untill eventually I choke on that too, which leads to things like pneumonia. That is how I will die. Not the disease itself, but the infections it causes.  I won't be able to read, to learn, or to meet new people. I will be confined to a wheelchair until I die in a home due to a random infection. It's inhuman. So as soon as the second symptom starts (muscle jerkings), I will end my life.  However, should I not have this disease, then it's not an issue. Of course I won't euthanize myself then. That'd be crazy."

There are many paths that your career can take and they're all within a 30 minute train ride. I believe the most valuable thing that you can do is research your options and build a plan.  The city has a huge amount of opportunities and you have to know how to utilize them. Think of the city like a tool that can help you achieve your goals. Everything you need is right there, but you have to find it.  It's important to figure out all of your options and which ones are the best for you. Then you can plan out your path to success. In some cases not everything you do will work out so you have to also have a back up plan that will still lead you to your goals. Once you know what you have to do, you won't be scared because you'll see a clear path to success.  You might feel overwhelmed to sit down and think so far into the future and that's fine. Your plan doesn't have to be perfect. Over time as you speak to people and do more research you will improve your plan and maybe even change direction to a better success.  The are a few rules that you have to follow for this way of thinking.   Only change the plan if it's going to improve your chances of success. Stick to the plan. You made it because this is your best chance of succeeding so why do anything else. Understand your limits. If your plan involves risky moves like getting a really competitive internship then make sure you have a back up and a back up for your back up if needed.   Other than that just keep going and you'll be amazed at how far hard work can take you."

Planes basically, move fast enough that the air on top goes quicker than the air on bottom and produces lift.  Jet engines just work to keep the plane moving fast enough to create this same effect.  Now I'll wait for an engineer to roto-root my answer."
GetMotivated,3dn0i9,BearlyBreathing,22,Fri Jul 17 20:31:12 2015 UTC,"Pedantic note: Most lift generated by planes isn't produced by the pressure differences you describe.  Instead, it is simply created by air smashing into the bottom of the wing at the angle of attack the same way your arm will get pushed up or down depending on how you angle your hand if you stick it out the car window on the freeway.  This is also why you can fold a paper airplane that glides reasonably well in spite of having wings that are most definitely not airfoils.  Airfoils just make things more efficient."

GetMotivated,3dn0i9,BearlyBreathing,9,Fri Jul 17 21:23:25 2015 UTC,"Since I realize the previous explanation might be misleading in its simplicity, here's a slight clarification if you're thinking about taking this idea to your teacher.  The wing doesn't simply skip off the top of the air.  It turns the air (like the rudder of a ship turns the water in the opposite direction that it pushes the ship).  Because of its nature as a fluid, both the air flowing over the top and bottom of the wing are turned, so lift is created on both sides the wing.  In fact, the air flowing over the top of the wing will be turned more to the extend that you might say the top of the wing produced more lift than the bottom.  Still, this is all Newtons third law, distinct from the Bernoulli effect, which accounts for the vast majority of lift generated by an airplane.  More here."

GetMotivated,3dn0i9,Draconan,7,Fri Jul 17 22:35:45 2015 UTC,"Not an engineer but what you're describing is the bernoulli theorem which accounts for a small amount of lift. From memory there's three things that account for lift; bernoulli, flat plate and some kind of upsuck like when you put a spoon, scoop down, under a fast moving faucet.   Flat plate is if you take a piece of rigid cardboard, put it parallel to the ground, angle it up a bit then move it through the air. It'll go up and back.   I think that bernoulli pretty much makes the air on top of the wing adhere to the wing, due to the pressure differences, and pushes it down.  Flat plate and bernoulli pretty much push the air down and because of Newtons third law pushing down makes the wing go up.   TL;DR Planes flight is ""explained"" by Newtons third law of motion."

GetMotivated,3dn0i9,Nazurai,4,Fri Jul 17 23:17:53 2015 UTC,"I think you misunderstood the message.  The point is that people tend to limit their potential by looking to what is commonly thought possible or advisable, and pare down their aspirations accordingly. This is bad, because people can be wrong. Wisdom can be misguided. Knowledge can turn out to be false. Humans love to think they know everything, but are wrong as often as they are right.  So the message is to avoid limiting yourself because you or someone else thinks your dream or your ambition is impractical or impossible.  Also, the bee is not an actual bee. The bee is a model for the attitude, and the science of flight is not the actual math, but an example of common knowledge being dead wrong. This is a metaphor."
GetMotivated,3dn0i9,badattitude4u,8,Fri Jul 17 23:44:18 2015 UTC,"I undestood the message he used an example not a metaphor. He's referencing something that is completely untrue as evidence for a philosophy. I agree with part of this philosophy with all my heart, which is nearly anything is possible and we shouldn't limit ourselves based on our preconceived notions.  However there is an important piece that's missing here, which is in order to overcome these obsticals we need to understand them and strategize to overcome them which is completely overlooked in the magical bumblebee example."
GetMotivated,3dn0i9,AGirlOnFire,3,Fri Jul 17 20:48:51 2015 UTC,"At one point in time a physics student put a bee's wing area and velocity into aviation equation and found, unexpectedly, that the bee shouldn't be able to fly.  The sediment is that sometimes people will say something is ""impossible"" when in actuality it is quite achievable. In these circumstances, those people will be wrong.  The bee example is flawed because it is relatively rare to mess up the math badly enough so that bee's can't fly. Millions of other examples are not.  If you hear this as ""avoid limiting yourself because you or someone else thinks your dream or your ambition is impractical or impossible"" then that's perfectly reasonable, but I hear it as the much more neutral ""sometime people are wrong about what's impossible."""
GetMotivated,3dn0i9,badattitude4u,3,Fri Jul 17 20:16:53 2015 UTC,"I hear it as the much more neutral ""sometime people are wrong about what's impossible.""   I totally agree with this philosophy with all my heart. And furthermore I would say it's dangerous to the human spirit and heart to believe otherwise.  My contention with the statement is simply that in order to overcome what was previously thought impossible you have to understand the nature of the problem and have the knowledge to form a solution.  The bee example fails in my opinion because it interjects something an animal does instinctually and compares it to someone achieving something previously thought unachievable. It's as meaningful as saying playpuses shouldn't be able to lay eggs--you can achieve anything."

As I got closer the yipping intensified and as soon as I rounded the corner of that barn I almost died.  Of Laughter....

See, the bar on the top line is referring to the talent of each artist.  The bar on the bottom line is referring to the perseverance.  So, by moving the pink hand up, you are changing the message sequence of the story from ""Talent is more common: See, A has more talent than B... but perseverance is rare. See, A didn't finish, B didn't give up.""  Into:  ""Talent is more common:  See, A has talent, (not finishing is irrelevant at this stage)... but perseverance is rare.  See, B didn't give up.  It separates the side-by-side comparison of their talent and perseverance.  I think it would have been better to center the text above each original pair of drawings.  That might have made the flow even better.  Or move the perseverance bar to the bottom, and close the gap between the comic panels, if you were to keep the pink sketch in your orientation."

OTOH if you think you're talented from birth...or that talent is a fixed quantity, then mistakes aren't setbacks...they are walls that keep you from moving ahead."

When you see someone do something well you have no idea how long they have been practising or where their journey began and it's best not to presume about them or yourself.   I think this is really good advice for someone who maybe doesn't feel talented right now, instead of telling them they do have some innate talent which they just haven't found yet, which both discourages them from what they've already tried and sets up this fear you're talking about.   Whereas you can tell people anything can change, that you don't have to feel/be talented right now to be talented in the future and that that the processes of getting better at something is one you have loads of choices and control over. Seems like a positive truthful message."

I get where you're coming from. You might be thinking ""it's MORE common to have natural talent? But natural talent isn't that common to begin with."" That's actually the point. As rare as it is to find someone born with natural talent, it's actually more rare to be the type of person with persistence. The moral of this is that you shouldn't fret if you're not one of those rarities born with talent, because we all have the capability of showing persistence, which is way more rare & useful than natural talent.  And I agree with how western society seems to place heavy emphasis on inherent talent. I feel like I often see themes in tv shows, movies, and video games where the main character has natural talent, and they triumph over the villain, who has nearly the same level of power due to hard work & persistence alone.

GetMotivated,3dingh,JamestheTraveler,6,Fri Jul 17 09:18:35 2015 UTC,"I think one thing that should be pointed out regarding the difference between talent and perseverance . . . (note that this is all IMO, whether you have the same or different views)  Talent is really just having the luck of being good at something right off the bat, and catching onto it quicker and better than others.   It doesn't matter how good you are at first though. If you have no interest in the task and no intentions of learning more in the future, then talent will only get you so far, and eventually, you'll do as poorly as everyone else who doesn't have any talent with it.   An example: I'm an artist, and I know another girl who's a striving artist. I've always been praised by family members and friends for having ""talent"", but to be honest, I wouldn't be where I am today without all the blood, sweat, and tears I put into my work through the years. And I still have a lot more to go before I can be truly proud of my work from my own individual sense of achievement. I'm still waiting to turn 20, so I have a long artistic journey ahead of me. I don't consider myself ""talented"", I just consider myself ""slightly experienced"" in one particular field.    Meanwhile, there's this girl I know who's older than me and has started drawing again, and is floating around on her own self-satisfaction and bragging, with friends and family who tell her all sorts of BS like ""YOU HAVE SO MUCH TALENT"" and all that noise - but her art is equivalent to the art that I've seen luckily talented children draw. And that's because she didn't put the years of work and perseverance into her art (she didn't even start truly drawing again until this past year or so). And she's already floating around like she's hot shit, when really, she isn't. She has no knowledge of anatomy, no life drawing experience under her belt, nothing. Just a bit of talent that she's been riding on and getting praised for simply because the people around her don't have said talent (as you can tell, it really pisses me off lol)  TL ; DR: Talent will get you started.

GetMotivated,3dingh,iliketurtlesdurr,7,Thu Jul 16 19:12:27 2015 UTC,"You know what? I think perseverance is all you need. To me, I think natural talent simply means you get a head start. That's all it is, just a head start. I don't believe a naturally talented individual actually has more potential than anyone else, they simply start out with slight boost, and might be able to learn faster at first.   Someone else with perseverance alone may lag behind at first if competing with someone with natural talent and the same level of persistency, but I believe if you really love what you do, you'll eventually reach a point where the both of you will be so good at what you do that the small boost the talented individual originally had over you will be rendered completely meaningless. At which point, you'll be able to either match or surpass the guy who had both talent & perseverance."

GetMotivated,3dingh,Idoontkno,2,Thu Jul 16 21:57:00 2015 UTC,Nah. The truly talented can make connections that are simply lost on others.   It's like their brain is capable of connections that elude the rest of us.  This is why the work of Bach or Beethoven stands so tall.  It seems so simple and beautiful when listening to it but to make that original connection....that's the thing.  That's where the genius and talent of it rests.
GetMotivated,3dingh,KING_0F_REDDIT,3,Fri Jul 17 00:08:35 2015 UTC,I think that ability is something you can develop though. I think that most people just don't want to go through the intense hardships needed to do it; they just kinda want it; they just want the quickest way to stardom.  They are full of expectations; and expectations are the best bet at making sure your creativity is held small.

GetMotivated,3dingh,KING_0F_REDDIT,2,Fri Jul 17 13:45:28 2015 UTC,"perseverance will get you into the top 10% of something, sure. But if you want to get from the into the top 1%, or into the top 0.1% of anything, be prepared to be disappointed if perseverance is all you have. And if you don't think that's true, you should try getting some experience in this thing known as reality before you get too philosophical."
GetMotivated,3dingh,iliketurtlesdurr,4,Fri Jul 17 20:11:52 2015 UTC,"For some things being at the 10% is enough. There's also things in which the difference between 1% and 10% is subjective or not that big... like music? who knows.   Point is, things aren't black and white, so hard work will get you shoulder to shoulder with unique talents for some things.  edit: people are downvoting you, but to be clear I'm not disagreeing with you. II agree that there are exceptional people whose talent if honed are unreachable through hard work."

You can get somewhere if you have no inherent talent with sheer hard work, but you won't be able to reach the same heights as someone with a lot talent and a little bit of willingness to work hard."

Lots of people have talent but most of them will give up early. On the other hand, people who perservere will succeed even if they didn't have talent to start with."
