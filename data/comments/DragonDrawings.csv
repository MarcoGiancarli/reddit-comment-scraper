Since rivalry between subspecies caused a 10000 year ""dark age"", specieism is considered a form of xenophobia; which means that although there are dragon-only nations and human-only nations; to be a specieist is frowned upon by most of society."

DragonDrawings,3cxul5,imacookielol,2,Sat Jul 11 19:22:51 2015 UTC,"I dunno if this is the sub for crit but since you did such pretty nice soft shading maybe think of the fire as a light source, and shade as if there is a flashlight in front of your dragons mouth. Unless that's ice that your dragon is breathing!"
DragonDrawings,3cxul5,saturdaycat,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:32:45 2015 UTC,Thanks :) The shading was definitely something I tried to take my time with. Started with the darkest values and tried to work up to the face and front of the body where I thought his scales would be the lightest.
DragonDrawings,3cxul5,RainbowRaccoon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:46:29 2015 UTC,"That is some beautiful shading, well done! The neck/body/tail also has a nice flow of motion to it.    For future works, you could try ""livening up"" the pose a little more-things rarely sit 100% symmetrically at random y'know. Maybe lift/move a paw, or a wing, just to make your subject's other half look less mirrored.    Also, fire has a natural tendency to go up for some reason, so a flame heart would probably look smoother at the bottom. rough Paint example (assuming the thing consists of a single stream of flame)"
