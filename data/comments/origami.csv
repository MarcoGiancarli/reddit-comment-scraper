It's a completely free vector graphics software, and i use it for CP's all the time. I imagine you know how to transfer an unfolded model to a CP, so, yeah. Inkscape.    P.S: it has a bunch of cool tutorials on its website as well."

origami,3e40w2,Paper-Dragon,5,Tue Jul 21 20:01:57 2015 UTC,"Bone folders are used to make sharp creases.  You can get them on Amazon, Ebay, etc.  You can even make your own.  They are also used in sewing and bookmaking so you can look for them with those supplies."
origami,3e40w2,SlippingAbout,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:06:21 2015 UTC,Are they worth getting?  I usually slide the side of a pencil across a crease to make it sharp.  Does a bone folder do anything special?
origami,3e40w2,MLGisNotForMe,3,Tue Jul 21 22:05:03 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, you're going to get a significantly sharper fold using this over a pencil. It's also more precise and easier to handle."
origami,3e40w2,Tahoma,2,Wed Jul 22 00:46:30 2015 UTC,"It seems like a stupid expense when you are buying it. But when you are creasing a 256x256 tessellation, your fingernails will thank you. I used to have a groove in my thumbnail from all the creasing i did, and now the bone folder never leaves my bag. A pencil can break, but you can put some oomph behind a bone folder and crease a lot of layers at once."
origami,3e40w2,malachus,5,Wed Jul 22 03:25:25 2015 UTC,"Bone folders are one of the most common tools used for origami.  They are used to make sharp creases in addition to some other uses.  Traditionally they are made from animal bone or horn, but they are also made from plastic, teflon, and wood (often bamboo).    Typically they have a rounded end and an end that tapers to a point.  The traditional shape style is usually about 6-8 inches long, about an inch wide with parallel sides for most of the body, and a quarter to half an inch thick.   These dimensions can vary quite a bit with some being much small or larger and with variations on the shape.    Teflon is the type of folder preferred by book artists because it does not burnish the paper (make it shiny) when pressure is applied.  Other types do this to one degree or another.  Glue and dye also don't stick to teflon, which is not always the case with other materials.    In recent years, there have been a few wooden ""bone"" folders made and/or marketed specifically for origami.  These tend to have one end that narrows to a long, thin point which can be used to manipulate paper inside of many layers or inside of a pocket.  They are frequently useful for models that require unsinking or other complex manipulations that might require some precise force but which do not allow the paper to be fully opened.    Of course, one of the great things about origami is that you don't have to have any tools at all, so these things are always optional.  I personally have had the experience of splitting a finger nail because I used it to fold many, many modular units and the creased edge wore a groove into my nail, so I will sometimes employ a folder when engaging in a large and/or repetitive origami task.    There are many ad hoc substitutes for a folding tool including credit cards, USB drives, milk jug handle punch outs, thick guitar picks (usually bass or jazz), banjo thumb picks and pretty much any other hard, smooth object.    I have a large collection of tools, many of which are folders but I also have scoring tools and tweezers.  That photo is not current and some of those tools have been retired/replaced.  If you want more information about those, look at this old post, I listed everything in the comments.  https://www.reddit.com/r/origami/comments/1efg60/origami_tool_kit/  Origami specific folders:  http://www.origami-shop.com/en/bonefolder-origami-xsl-219_243.html  http://www.origamispirit.com/folding-tool/  https://origamiusa.org/catalog/products/hardwood-creaser  I'm getting tired of typing, but let me know if you have any questions."

origami,3drd2y,JustPassive,3,Sat Jul 18 18:43:40 2015 UTC,"Well usually as soon as you make something, it's copyrighted by yourself by default (unless you signed a contract with your employer that states otherwise, to avoid issues with things you make at work etc...).  From what I understand is that a lot of folders obtain permission from a model if it's not made by themselves before they fold a certain model from the author. This is something that Sara Adams from Happy Folding does. Once you have the permission, all you then need to do is mention the author of the original design. (and as courtesy you might want to mention the authors website/book/etc... where you got it from etc...).  Also when you see folded models, you see ""design by ..., folded by ..."" to indicate who did what.  Please correct me if I'm wrong."
origami,3drd2y,EvilActivity,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:51:30 2015 UTC,"Does that mean that if I were to fold a model designed by someone else and share the photos on the subreddit, I should contact the designer first?"
origami,3drd2y,VitulusAureus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:38:51 2015 UTC,"I think folding it and posting pictures is fine? Its only when you teach people how to fold it, that is when you need permission I guess."
origami,3drd2y,EvilActivity,2,Sat Jul 18 22:52:51 2015 UTC,"Check this out, a pdf with most asked questions regarding copyright and origami:  https://origamiusa.org/files/OrigamiUSA%20Copyright%20FAQ.pdf    Neither the images nor the folding sequences for traditional models — generally those over 100 years old — are protected by copyright, although specific diagrams for traditional models, such as those redrawn for recent publication, are protected. Original origami compositions composed within this century are generally protected by copyright, whether or not they are marked, and whether or not they were purchased or obtained for free, unless copyright is specifically waived. When you legally obtain instructions for a copyrighted origami figure, for example, by buying a book of instructions, along with that book you have the right to fold as many copies of that figure as you wish for your own enjoyment and/or for private display. However, you have not obtained the right to fold, teach, or display it commercially, unless that right is specifically granted in the instructions.    So you could argue that the youtube video isn't for commercial activity, but since it could be monetized, I would ask permission in any case (besides the fact that it's a nice thing to do towards the author).

origami,3drd2y,malachus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:01:50 2015 UTC,Oh thanks for the links! that clears everything. So I guess all the origami models within the century I will need to find permission from the author.
origami,3drd2y,jsu718,3,Sun Jul 19 00:30:21 2015 UTC,"Copyright in origami is a pretty big can of worms.  You can easily find some stuff around the web that discusses some of the implications.   The short version is that in the origami community a lot of the expectations are based on social norms of respect for the designer.  This means that most people who do something publicly, like creating a video tutorial, will ask permission first.    The more complex and nuanced version is that the finished model is protected by copyright and any diagrams used to create that model are protected by a separate copyright.  However, copyright does not protect a process and there have been cases where someone has redrawn diagrams and published them without permission or attribution, which is frowned upon.  So, the general rule is to ask and get permission from the designer and, if you are going to used images of the diagrams, from the person who drew the diagrams."
origami,3drd2y,jsu718,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:44:36 2015 UTC,I guess the best option is to ask for the person/designer first and give proper credit.
origami,3drd2y,OriirO,2,Sat Jul 18 21:53:22 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. It is not strictly legally required, but it is the proper and polite way to do things. There isn't enough legal precedent to say that things are absolutely required by law or even that specific origami figures can be copyrighted, there is more detailed information here, but in general you need permission before doing anything beyond what is just for yourself, especially those things that involve sharing with others how to make a figure or making money (or youtube fame) off of something."
origami,3drd2y,OriirO,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:59:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation and the link. I guess in this situation, the ones on Origami-make.com that states its ""traditional"" those are the ones that are fine to create as there is no origin to the maker.  Whereas, the ones states its copyright: Hyo Ahn, those are the ones that I need to contact the creator for permission."
origami,3drd2y,OriirO,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:25:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if it is traditional it is fair game. You can use it however you like. Plus almost all the origamists that you will contact will be fine with you demonstrating and teaching if you ask and credit them as long as you aren't charging/selling.

origami,3dof4i,xpkg,2,Mon Jul 20 05:32:10 2015 UTC,"Before I started folding anything on the ryujin, I drew out the entire crease pattern on a large sheet of graph paper.  That REALLY helped me find the exact reference points when I started creasing. I would strongly suggest putting in the time to try overlaying the crease pattern with a grid. The 3.5 was a pain, but I actually found a lot of helpful stuff online that got me through the whole thing."
origami,3dof4i,Paper-Dragon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:34:20 2015 UTC,Instead of drawing the grid on graph paper i just took the crease pattern and sent it though inkscape and put a 96x96 grid on top of it.
origami,3dof4i,Paper-Dragon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:35:38 2015 UTC,That sounds a lot easier.  Does it help you locate reference points?  I have a lot of stuff saved that helped me make the 3.5.  Maybe I could share those with you.  I have an album on here of the ryujin I made and maybe that could help you fold it.

origami,3dgakh,Malleon,2,Thu Jul 16 01:20:03 2015 UTC,"Hm... It seems very, very crumply.  I'm going to be honest: I only liked the hercules beetle, Eupatorus, and the sailfish. Maybe the Kabutomushi and Caucasus. The rest are either very crumply, or has foil showing.  Tissue foil is one of those mediums that are very hard to master. If you force it to place, the result would be crumply. You just cannot fold cursorily with this medium. Have a look at my fold of Kamiya's Frog. The body is fine, but the forelegs are crumply as I forced it to place using a tweezer.  On non-insect models, I suggest you to glue tissue on both sides of the foil and use PVA (white) glue. It makes folds easier to reverse and has more paper-like than foil-like as it makes it stiffer, which reduces the crumpling significantly. But more importantly, keep practicing; it's possible to get crumple-free insects using one-sided tissue foil. But looking at your hercules beetle and Eupatorus, it seems that you are getting better and better, so keep going!"
origami,3dgakh,redheadorigami,0,Fri Jul 17 05:25:22 2015 UTC,"The realization of how much the double-backing helps didn't really occur to me until I actually tried a color-change model like the Eupatorus. Thanks for the feedback; I've definitely had a lot of time to practice!  I'm currently using 3M Super 77 spray adhesive, which I often find causes significant crumpling when I'm not careful. My procedure that minimizes crumpling is to lay out the sheet with adhesive and press a sheet of foil over it. With practice, it tends to give me wrinkle free paper.  I'll look into the PVA glue, but I've mostly been using the spray adhesive because it's easy to clean off with acetone/nail polish remover. Seems like it'd definitely help with some of the models I've had to force rather than fold into place."
