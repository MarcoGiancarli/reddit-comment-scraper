newhampshire,3e3lbm,Imnotcreepyatall,16,Tue Jul 21 18:16:15 2015 UTC,"It really depends on where you are. Whose land is the forest? If it isn't yours, public, or you have permission than you should not shoot there. Also many towns have restrictions on shooting on public lands, so you should look into your local ordinances.   I have no idea about your firearms experience, but you really should have a backstop and/or be shooting shot light enough that you can see everything within its range.  I know that some people here are saying ""fuck your neighbors complaints, this is NH"", and to an extent they are right,but a pissed off neighbor can really be a pain in the ass to deal with. So for your own sake, try not to have your neighbors pissed at you.  Edit: It always amazes me what gets downvoted in this sub."
newhampshire,3e3lbm,deadstump,3,Tue Jul 21 23:13:52 2015 UTC,"Solid advice with the neighbor pragmatism.  At least make sure they have nothing to screw you with - your trees hanging over their fence, you breaking the neighborhood covenant by parking a car on your lawn, etc.  And it'd be worth talking to them and explaining that it's perfectly legal during the day."
newhampshire,3e3lbm,ChopperIndacar,4,Wed Jul 22 00:02:30 2015 UTC,"Everything gets downvoted. I don't know why, but somebody with too much time on their hands is downvoting everything in /r/newhampshire."
newhampshire,3e3lbm,livin4donuts,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:14:33 2015 UTC,"The important issue for me is always, always safety.    Dealing with a pissed off neighbor is indeed something worth avoiding, but a million times easier on the conscience than accidentally shooting someone because you were careless.    Go somewhere safe, and ideally, not infuriating to those nearby."
newhampshire,3e3lbm,issue9mm,5,Wed Jul 22 02:57:29 2015 UTC,Granite State Indoor Range in Hudson definitely allows shotguns. Slugs only. I was just there 2 weeks ago and asked about it.

newhampshire,3e3lbm,skankopotamus,8,Wed Jul 22 03:10:11 2015 UTC,"Many of the sand pits in NH are shooter-friendly.  I'd poke around online to find a couple in your area, see if anyone online has mentioned them, and call their office to inquire about their shooting policy.  The sand pits that are cool with shooting usually just ask that you pick up your brass (and shotgun wadding).  Bonus: great backstop, no worries about safety."
newhampshire,3e3lbm,ildrummer,2,Tue Jul 21 19:13:05 2015 UTC,Sand pits have offices?

newhampshire,3e3lbm,wickedhip,5,Tue Jul 21 20:57:46 2015 UTC,Tons of little pieces of shot bouncing around inside a basement doesn't seem like a great idea.

newhampshire,3e3lbm,SheeEttin,2,Tue Jul 21 22:30:47 2015 UTC,Definitely don't shoot Flubber in your basement.
newhampshire,3e3lbm,ChopperIndacar,6,Tue Jul 21 23:56:21 2015 UTC,"You need permission if that's private land, but town forests that don't have specific firearms discharge restrictions are an option. WMA's are a no-no. As long as what you're doing is legal, anyone in ear shot that has an issue with it can go pound sand... guns have been a part of woods culture long before they left Massachusetts.   The obvious goes, no leaving shells/debris behind and no shooting up trees. Leave nothing but footprints."
newhampshire,3e3lbm,DieCommieScum,7,Tue Jul 21 19:55:16 2015 UTC,Actually afaik (see below) you don't need permission to shoot on private land but you should definitely get it before shooting. Always better to be respectful. And certainly not if the private property is POSTED.  http://www.wildlife.state.nh.us/hunting/where-hunt.html

newhampshire,3e3lbm,Defenestrationism,2,Wed Jul 22 00:48:07 2015 UTC,"idk where you live, but people reacting from the blasts shouldn't bother you. If you want, you could warn them. RSAs 207:3-a, 207:3-c, and 644:13 is the state law on discharge restrictions.   You will be limited to shooting ranges, your own land if you meet the needed space, or someone else's land who gives you permission. Otherwise you run the risk on trespassing on private land or being on public land, where it's design is gathering of citizens"
newhampshire,3e3lbm,SpartanG087,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:13 2015 UTC,"Good luck. I got stationed up here from Texas four years ago and I really bought into the whole live free or die motto. I bought a house with a good piece of land and I started living the dream. I quickly realized that country living, at least in southern NH, is not at all like it is down south. My neighbors have called me in for just cleaning my guns on my deck. They complain to the subdivision Facebook page about coyotes getting into the trash, I get the cops called on me for skinning one in my backyard. I shoot far enough back that I've never violated any laws but whenever it gets called in the cops always come and make contact with me and I ain't got time for that nonsense. I would like to say make sure you are far enough away and are being safe and just let all the whiners go to hell---but eventually it just gets annoying. Find yourself a good sand pit and get permission to use it. MFL would charge you for breathing their oxygen if they could. There is also some decent gun clubs near Manchester but usually you have to wait for someone to die to get in. Your mileage may vary with all this though. Not being from NH I've always been treated like an outsider so my perspective may be flawed. And maybe I just picked the wrong neighborhood. Idk. I've enjoyed the time Uncle Sam gave me to reside in this state but I am looking forward to going home."
newhampshire,3e3lbm,vault34,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:43:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry to say, but I think you have some crappy neighbors.  I've lived in southern/seacoast NH my entire life, and have rarely seen anyone bat an eye to someone carrying a gun (either a long gun or one on the hip). I'll admit I am in a rural town; nearly everyone I know has someone in the family who hunts, so having the cops called for cleaning a kill sounds crazy. Especially considering how non-restrictive NH's gun laws are ( less restrictive than Texas' laws), people should be acclimated to seeing guns on private citizens.  I can only guess you are in a community where many of your neighbors are Mass transplants (MA has very restrictive gun laws)."
newhampshire,3e3lbm,JD-73,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:17:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah most of them work down in MA. I try to be respectful of people's viewpoints/concerns, especially being neighbors and all. After I started feeling like they were dictating my hobbies I decided it was time to move. Just listed the house this week."
newhampshire,3e3lbm,vault34,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:32:14 2015 UTC,"Good luck to you, hope your new place comes with better neighbors."
newhampshire,3e3lbm,JD-73,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:41:48 2015 UTC,"Back to the backyard. Fuck the neighbors. This is NH. Better yet, invite them to shoot with you if they come to complain. If you really rustle their jimmies and they have a grudge against you, invite the entire neighborhood to a barbecue. They won't come, and you're not the bad guy. You're just a typical NH resident.  Happy Shooting."
newhampshire,3e3lbm,fifteenaces,5,Tue Jul 21 21:19:18 2015 UTC,"Every time I got out into my back yard to garden, the neighbors come out with their semi autos and get cracking at the sand pit behind our places.  Makes me crap my pants by the second shot.  There's not a thing I can do about it and this is NH, I wouldn't have it any other way.  I wish just once they'd keep practicing after I go back into the house, just to spare my feelings."
newhampshire,3e3lbm,nullcompany,2,Tue Jul 21 23:53:15 2015 UTC,"I had a similar issue, neighbor thought the world revolved around him, and that I was using a dirtbike specifically to ruin his pool relaxation time.

newhampshire,3e2lvw,overdrivegto,9,Wed Jul 22 00:57:07 2015 UTC,My wife met a bunch of people when she started going to Pure Barre in Nashua.  She had never done it before and just started a few months ago.  She also participates in some knitting groups at Yarn & Fiber in Londonderry if you are into that.    You could do try and join up with the NH chapter of AMC.  They have group hikes all the time.    Double Midnight Comics as mentioned is great.    A few of my buddies at work play softball through the NH Sports & Social Club.  Bars in Manchester are pretty terrible.  I went a bunch when I was in my 20s and never met anyone I even wanted to have a conversation with so good call skipping that.

I guess that goes back to the hobbies.  you might try checking out some meetup groups --- I never really got into them....but I have friends who've met some cool people.   [edit] -- oops, saw above you already tried that!    Another idea is to (if your work allows it) work in a coworking space (I think manchester has one). I feel like that provides the perfect environment for an introverted person to ""organically"" meet someone because the coffee machine is broken or whatever, and not because ""hey, we all just showed up and we don't know eachother -- my name is so-and-so"".   There's also the Portsmouth Makers Space...which is cool if you like, well...makin' stuff."

These recruitment places are scattered through public areas. Armed recruiters, who may even feel compelled to respond to emergency situations nearby, starts looking like a standing army in the streets (more so than our cops already do)."

newhampshire,3e0qpt,SiberianShibe,4,Tue Jul 21 19:41:37 2015 UTC,"Yup, it is. Doesn't mean treating them like 2nd class citizens will fix the problem. I trust a gun in the hands with someone I served with as infantry than I do any civilian. If you took away guns, they'd find another way if they were hellbent on suicide. Just like civilians."
newhampshire,3e0qpt,GoneCountry87,-2,Tue Jul 21 21:27:50 2015 UTC,We have precedents for this. Felons are not allowed to own weapons. You need to obtain a special federal permit to obtain automatic weapons. We have forms of gun control for reducing risk all over the United States. Would you trust a gun in the hands of a mentally ill service member? You'd be an idiot to say yes.
newhampshire,3e0qpt,SiberianShibe,2,Tue Jul 21 21:33:07 2015 UTC,"... we're not all mentally ill. And I sell guns for a living, I don't need an explaination on the importance of 4473s.  Have a good night friend."

newhampshire,3e0qpt,GoneCountry87,8,Wed Jul 22 01:27:07 2015 UTC,How and why is this remotely necessary?
newhampshire,3e0qpt,Sqwirl,5,Tue Jul 21 10:33:13 2015 UTC,"because there was a terrorist attack on a recruiting office. By law the recruiters themselves are not allowed to be armed. The police are not there when you need them, so these Ex-military PATRIOTS are defending their brothers because no one else will."
newhampshire,3e0qpt,_live_free_or_die,5,Tue Jul 21 12:30:57 2015 UTC,"It's not by law, it's by pentagon rules. If the military decides to arm their people in these and other places they can."
newhampshire,3e0qpt,dave603,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:36:38 2015 UTC,I suspect it could run afoul of the Posse Comitatus Act if we have soldiers going armed to work in strip malls and everywhere else recruitment happens.  It may be tricky.
newhampshire,3e0qpt,ChopperIndacar,3,Wed Jul 22 00:08:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I watched the video. What I don't understand is why this is different from when someone shoots up a school or anywhere else. We don't, for instance, have armed civvies standing outside of Sandy Hook.  Also, why do people only seem to care after something happens? Where was the outcry before these people were shot?  Will these people be doing this forever? What happens when they're gone? Do they really think someone else plans to shoot up a recruiting center? Is there a credible threat in this regard?  I'm not asking why they're personally doing it. I'm asking why it's necessary.  The reason I'm asking is because if it's necessary, then we can't have it both ways. When we see a guy walking down the street with an AR, we can't act all incredulous and concerned, because just like the shooting at the recruiting center, mass shootings have proven to be possible at any time and any place (but most likely to occur in a 'gun free' location).  Just some food for thought."
newhampshire,3e0qpt,Sqwirl,4,Tue Jul 21 12:44:36 2015 UTC,You are correct. Schools should not ban guns on their grounds either. I am sure we would have similar PATRIOTS doing this at schools if they were allowed to by law.
newhampshire,3e0qpt,dromoney,4,Tue Jul 21 13:28:43 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're being downvoted. If this is appropriate and acceptable at a recruiting center, then why not at a school? This is a very strange line to draw in my opinion.  It sure would be nice if people could at least respond or explain their position before summarily downvoting an honest and relevant question or point."
newhampshire,3e0qpt,Sqwirl,-2,Tue Jul 21 13:47:08 2015 UTC,I downvoted /u/dromoney because he insists on capitalizing the word PATRIOT as if that gives it more meaning. Also... he's got a crap worldview and I disagree with everything said.

And yes, some things you have posted since, I do agree with. So I would like to retract my statement about your worldview (as a whole).   With regard to my view on ""veterans"": I do not believe that our military should be used to invade every third world backwater on the planet that needs some American style ""freedom"". Our military has not actually defended our country from a foreign threat since 1812ish. If the US military were upholding their charge to defend our country and constitution there would have already been a military coup to restore the rule of law to our Nation. Alas, our ""heroes in uniform"" are sent overseas, to kill goat herders who are no threat to our country whatsoever. I say again, when the US military does it's job, and actually protects our Country and Constitution, I will support them in speech and in action. Until that day comes, I will always question their label as ""heroes"". You keep sucking that hero cock though... I bet it feels good to think you are right."
newhampshire,3e0qpt,5arge,4,Tue Jul 21 19:13:54 2015 UTC,I think those in Pearl Harbor would disagree with you.

newhampshire,3e0qpt,SheeEttin,3,Tue Jul 21 13:35:47 2015 UTC,"I was not aware of that. Do you happen to have a source? I can't find anything on it, and I also find this very interesting as school grounds are considered 'gun free' zones."

I'm pretty sure people are getting the wrong idea from the point I'm trying to make. It's become very difficult to have a non-binary opinion on reddit these days. Oh well.

newhampshire,3e0qpt,SiberianShibe,5,Tue Jul 21 17:54:15 2015 UTC,You make these blanket statements as if they are the undisputed truth. How would any regulations have kept Major Nidal Malik Hasan from killing those people? Can regulations see a person's future actions?

newhampshire,3e0qpt,SiberianShibe,5,Tue Jul 21 18:25:07 2015 UTC,"""He wouldn't have had access to a weapon, duh."" Duh, he used an FN57 semi auto pistol. Not an Army issue weapon. The Army issues Beretta's.    Stop making blanket statements that you don't know what your talking about."

newhampshire,3e0qpt,Imnotcreepyatall,4,Tue Jul 21 18:52:26 2015 UTC,"Wrong again, he wasn't authorized to be armed."
newhampshire,3e0qpt,dave603,-4,Tue Jul 21 18:28:04 2015 UTC,"That's not a regulation problem, that's an enforcement problem. Its a reason for metal detectors or other devices."
newhampshire,3e0qpt,SiberianShibe,3,Tue Jul 21 18:33:45 2015 UTC,So you want to put metal detectors on military bases to solve the problem?  LOL HMM let's see if this infantry platoon has anything metal on them before they go on a full pack hike.
newhampshire,3e0qpt,dave603,3,Tue Jul 21 21:42:58 2015 UTC,In many military occupational skill sets you are doing very dangerous things that will hurt or kill you and lot's of people around you. Many of these things do not include use of a weapon.
newhampshire,3e0qpt,dave603,-4,Tue Jul 21 17:52:47 2015 UTC,That is irrelevant to my point.
newhampshire,3e0qpt,SiberianShibe,4,Tue Jul 21 17:56:53 2015 UTC,"No it isn't. You made it sound like if we arm active duty service people they will not only kill themselves, but other around them. You don't need a gun to do that on any type of military installation."
newhampshire,3e0qpt,dave603,-4,Tue Jul 21 18:27:05 2015 UTC,Having a firearm makes it a whole lot easier. You can't kill nearly as many people with a knife.
newhampshire,3e0qpt,SiberianShibe,4,Tue Jul 21 18:29:43 2015 UTC,You can by running them over with an unarmed tank! You have no idea how many other things are dangerous on any military reservation do you?

newhampshire,3e0qpt,DieCommieScum,-6,Tue Jul 21 20:38:41 2015 UTC,"Theoretically, cops have a lot more training, an oath to uphold the law, and more accountability than regular citizens.  Also they are paid to protect order, not protesting to promote gun rights."
newhampshire,3e0qpt,nill0c,6,Tue Jul 21 15:31:55 2015 UTC,"Theoretically, cops have a lot more training   The key word there is ""theoretically."" When I was on the board of directors at a southern NH gun range I served as a range officer for the local PD's qualifications one day. Part of our agreement with them was they could use the range for quals but one of us would be RO. It wasn't the usual RO duties, more of an observer type of thing but we had the final say on range safety.  Except for a handful of them, they sucked. Their gun handling was poor and their shooting wasn't much better. The guys I used to shoot IDPA with could outshoot those guys any day of the week."

NH is full of ""rural suburbia"" and although there are some bus routes you will be hard pressed to find a convenient line. Plus, most backroads here were built a long time ago before cars and do not have shoulders or room for bicycles Live south of Merrimack if you can. Traffic on route 3/Everett Tpk gets relatively backed up at certain areas going SB in the morning (exit 12, other highway intersections near Manchester) so living south of Merrimack (Nashua, Milford, Hudson) will give you a much nicer commute, plus closer proximity to Boston if you care about that sort of thing Rentals are not very commonplace in NH. There are a lot of homeowners here, but there are some good rentals in Nashua if you look around   Enjoy and welcome to NH! My wife is a NY transplant from upstate and she likes it quite a bit :)"

I also work in the Merrimack area, and can tell you from experience that the 5pm northbound traffic on the Everett Turnpike is awful, especially between exits 10 and 11. Southbound isn't too bad, even with all of the Massachusetts drivers.  Your housing budget should be ~$850-$1000/month for a respectable apartment. Anything less than that, and you'll probably be unsatisfied with your living condition. Should you decide to find a place in Nashua, stay away from the ""Tree Streets""; streets named after species of trees (elm, birch, etc). They're located downtown, and are not all that great to go through. A friend of mine lives in the Clocktower Place and he loves it. I've visited a couple of times and was impressed by what I saw. However, that's only one location, definitely research around!  Finally, as someone else said, you need to have a car. Public transportation, outside of college campuses and downtown Manchester, is pathetic. NH is very rural and spread out, so in order to go anywhere you'll need to have a car. Preferably one with AWD (back roads can be bad to drive through during the winter)."

newhampshire,3dr9x1,SiberianShibe,5,Sat Jul 18 19:08:51 2015 UTC,Our property taxes are insane because we have no sales or income tax. The landowners pass it on to renters typically.  You could find a studio for 500ish

newhampshire,3dr9x1,badenglishihave,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:02:26 2015 UTC,"Although I disagree, I can understand your thinking. To me, Lowell is better because it has a younger demographic, and Nashua has just as much gross neighborhood area as Lowell. Both have nice downtown areas, but frankly, I think Lowell wins out in that respect because there is more to choose from.  OP didn't really say what he was looking for, so you are right in that Lowell has more of a city feel to it, though if he's coming from NYC it won't feel very big at all.  If he's interested in the hinterlands, then my recommendation wouldn't hold water anywho."

I guess I'm just partial to Nashua because I love NH so much :)"

Grant was arrested and the boy was reunited with his mother.   __  UPDATE 11:29pm  Police say they may be in danger!  Mr. Grant was at the house, the mother was distracted and took the child in a vehicle that was in the yard.  The mother called the police right away.  We are concerned about the welfare of Mr. Grant and the child.  We do not believe he has any access to firearms or weapons, but there is a knife in the vehicle.  Comments made earlier in the day lead police to believe that the child is in danger.  We have some tips that he could be in the state of Maine, however, nothing has been confirmed.  These are notes taken from a live interview with the Somersworth police captain WMUR News 9 Tonight at 11.  __  UPDATE 11:00pm  Authorities said they are looking for his father, Jeremiah Grant, 33, of Berwick, Maine. He is described as a white man with brown hair and brown eyes. Police said he is around 6 feet tall and weighs 275 pounds.  Jeremiah Grant has tattoos on his left neck saying “Alpha Male,” on his upper left arm of a skull and on his left forearm with the inscription “INSANE"" with a cross above it. The tattoo on the left forearm also has the inscription “GRANT.” On the right inner forearm, he also has a tattoo of a skull.  Jeremiah Grant was last seen wearing a bright yellow Hanes T-shirt and black pants.  Police said Jeremiah Grant does not own the vehicle.  Investigators said they have reason to believe that Jeremiah Grant is mentally unstable and is a danger to himself and others.  Jeremiah Grant is listed on Maine's sex offender registry in connection with a sexual assault that occurred outside the state.  Anyone who spots the vehicle is urged to call the Somersworth police department at 603-692-3131 as soon as possible.  __  AN AMBER ALERT HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR A BOY ABDUCTED FROM SOMERSWORTH.  MALACHI GRANT IS ONE-AND-A-HALF YEARS OLD. HE HAS LIGHT BROWN HAIR, HAZEL EYES, AND IS 34 INCHES TALL. HE WAS LAST SEEN WEARING A LIME GREEN T-SHIRT WITH BLACK STRIPES, BLACK SHORTS, AND NAVY BLUE SHOES WITH WHITE LACES.  POLICE BELIEVE HE IS WITH JEREMIAH GRANT. HE'S 43 YEARS OLD... WITH BROWN HAIR AND BROWN EYES. HE'S SIX FEET TALL.  POLICE SAY GRANT'S VEHICLE IS A 1991 GRAY HONDA ACCORD WITH NEW HAMPSHIRE LICENSE PLATE 2854569.  THERE IS SUNOCO STICKER ON THE REAR BUMPER AND DAMAGE TO THE RIGHT FRONT FENDER.  PLEASE CALL POLICE IF YOU SEE THIS CAR!  I am sorry this is all in caps, I had to copy it from news scripts."

newhampshire,3dgpzo,craineum,3,Thu Jul 16 03:35:16 2015 UTC,This is correct. DOT is paving between Exit 12A and 13 on I-89 this summer. They will recut the rumble strip after they do the overlay.
newhampshire,3dgpzo,of_marginal_interest,2,Thu Jul 16 17:42:51 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. Do you know if it's easy to tear up afterwards and restore the strip? I worked construction for a summer job a bit and we used to fill in depressions overnight with some sort of paving, but I wasn't doing permanent paving work so I don't know much about this sort of thing."
newhampshire,3dgpzo,Mitchioto,2,Thu Jul 16 04:08:33 2015 UTC,It is probably because there is a layer of 'top' paving going over the whole area and they dont want the rumble strips to telegraph through to this layer.   A lot of projects leave the 'top' until the very end because it's difficult to place correctly and is what shows when all is said and done.   Once that's down they'll likely grind new rumble strips.

Red squirrels are our native species being out competed by the larger and disease spreading grays, and then there are also two kinds of flying squirrel.   Basically, its good to see the red ones! I'm also 100% sure black squirrels are abnormalities in NH, those are rarities."

newhampshire,3dfql6,dave603,0,Thu Jul 16 11:10:30 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I don't think that is true. The reds are smaller and the grays are carriers for disease that can kill off the reds. I've never heard of them forcing grays out but hopefully I'm wrong.

newhampshire,3db8gz,nightfyr,10,Tue Jul 14 22:45:33 2015 UTC,"Several things off the top of my list (in no particular order):   Declare victory on the ""War on Drugs"", legalize, tax, and set up rehab for those wanting it. Commute the sentences for those already convicted of non-violent crimes. Make sure all available resources have been extended to individuals needing services before using the criminal justice system. Open discussion on police activities, including use of force and procurement of military weapons/hardware. Independent oversight of all law enforcement activities. Curtail use of 'no-knock' warrants. Taxation - investigate the disparity between owning a house for primary residence and owning for vacations.  Death penalty. Get rid of it. I don't trust our government to be able to openly arrest, prosecute, sentence, and execute anyone. We've got one guy who more than most deserves to hang, but letting him live so that in other circumstances we can be sure that the state has not lynched someone else is a small price to pay."
newhampshire,3db8gz,mbrousseau,-2,Wed Jul 15 00:28:53 2015 UTC,"Also, all this stuff. ^"
newhampshire,3db8gz,teefour,-1,Wed Jul 15 00:57:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for posting such a comprehensive list! I will address these issues in the order you presented them!  I openly support the legalization of marijuana and actually want to tax it so we can lower property taxes for everyone. I have already replied to the idea of building rehab centers in each city on my facebook page. The gist of it is that we need to have services available with specialists for each field available in every city. As far as Commuting a sentence goes, it would be case by case basis and that would take a lot of time. for example:  A Meth dealer got arrested for selling to a undercover police officer. In no circumstance would I commute this sentence. Distribution and production are the major problems and that's what we need to take care of.    Open discussion is KEY, but only if done civilly. I have seen the same news reports you have and I have gotten as angry as you have. I am not aware of the procurement of military hardware in NH, please give me some info on this, i'd be more than happy to study up. When people mention police officers, use of force is usually the topic at hand. We see a very limited window of police activity on the news, even fewer good things. The last incident i could find in New Hampshire was in Seabrook in 2013. I don't believe use of force is a issue our state faces at the moment. I love talking about taxation and how to lower it, keep money in your pocket. I believe trough the taxation and legalization of marijuana we can lower all property taxes throughout the state! Morally I believe the death penalty has its use. When someone commits a crime so heinous, so devastating, that a entire state is shaken by it, I believe The person should be put to death but only if there was loss of life involved in the crime.   I will admit I am no expert but I will review any material you send me and educate myself with it. I realize that you and I have different views on some things and I am Willing to discuss them with you further. Please let me know of any further Inquiries and thank you for your time!"
newhampshire,3db8gz,PowPowPowerCrystal,4,Wed Jul 15 03:03:16 2015 UTC,In no circumstance would I commute this sentence.   Mostly because that is in no way a power of the legislative branch of government.
newhampshire,3db8gz,mbrousseau,3,Wed Jul 15 03:34:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for reading and responding.  Again, in no particular order is my response to your response:  See House Bill #407 for legislation will study the procurement of military hardware for use in New Hampshire. It's a beginning. The problems with a police force using military equipment are that, despite police departments claim that the gear is necessary to prevent acts of terrorism, it appears not to be the case. It would seem that the constitutional rights of citizens to freely assemble, even in protest of the government, are at risk. Recently, Keene began a plan to purchase a Bearcat, an eight-ton armored personnel vehicle. Along with the Bearcat comes the responsibility of maintaining the vehicle - but for what use? To control the Pumpkin Festival? It's the threat of lethal force to maintain civil obedience that is troublesome.   You might want to take a look at this Youtube video linked here -> Send in a Marine! for more information about this subject.  Not just the legalization of marijuana - decriminalization of all substance abuse. It seems to work when it is used - Portugal is one example. I'm not advocating open and unrestricted sale and use of all intoxicating substances at all, nor do I suppose that a six-pack of beer or a bit of weed is the same as a bag of meth or smack, but I think community resources would be better used to provide education, identification, treatment and support for people who have found themselves influenced by dangerous drugs. Your example of the meth dealer - that might have been the person who needs medical and social intervention before the use of the criminal justice system. In that rhetorical case, maybe, it would have served the community better if other avenues were explored before a no-knock SWAT team throwing flash-bangs through windows shows up. In real cases, intervention and guidance would be a better alternative.  The death penalty. I fail to see any moral distinctions between state-sanctioned death and a criminal murder. I also would like to personally deliver retribution to those who have committed horrible crimes. The guy currently on NH's death row probably deserves this as much as anyone. BUT - how can you say that the government is right, not only in this case, but in ALL cases of capital crimes? There are many historical antecedents in the US where the death penalty was improperly applied. There are cases that the Innocence Project has re-opened and found the accused was, in fact, innocent. You cannot fix death. You cannot trust the government to be able, in all cases, to present a legal justification of the death penalty. Therefore, you cannot have the government seek the death penalty. A lifetime in prison meets all the needs of maintaining a safe society without making an irreversible mistake because of political ambitions or other divergence from the constitution's limits to state power.  We take taxation seriously in New Hampshire, as you well know. We consistently avoid a state income tax on earnings, and we consistently avoid state sales taxes (much to the annoyance of our neighbors to the south). But, New Hampshire faces the same problems as others with shortfalls of revenue. Our schools need money, our public works need money, our natural resources need money - where do we get the funds to support all the things in New Hampshire that we have come to love and cherish? One way (and I'm in no way an expert or even well-versed in finance) might be to look at the property taxes on homes. It seems that the burden is unfairly placed on the single family residence when compared to ownership by individuals who have purchased vacation homes. Also, fck them rich ccksuckers taking over the lakes region. Don't get me started!  Also, as a side note, stop ending your sentences with a ""!"". It's unnecessary, and distracting.  Good luck with your campaign to join one of the most diverse and representative legislative bodies in the US."

newhampshire,3db8gz,PowPowPowerCrystal,2,Wed Jul 15 03:10:08 2015 UTC,"You're very young. How will you strive to understand your older constituents with life experiences that are far more varied and nuanced than your comparably short life - people with children in school, parents with disabled children, seniors barely making ends meet with social security, returning veterans with psychological stress and families in financial crisis.   Will you continue the New Hampshire tradition of eroding social safety nets for our most vulnerable citizens?"
newhampshire,3db8gz,fackinzebu,0,Wed Jul 15 03:17:22 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, I am 22 years old which is young. But I have been through a lot of these things, albeit while I growing up. While I don't have a child, I can Imagine what it's like to want the best for them. To want your child to have the best chance at life, to have a better life than yours. That all begins with education. I remember schools very clearly, elementary at Beaver meadow all the way to Concord High. I remember my junior year of high school was the first time I was offered a chance to take a class related to a career skill. Junior year of high school is pretty late in the game to start offering things like that. I want our schools to be able to offer those classes in Middle school, to jump start children to do something they love for a career!  I don't have a child with a disability, but I took care of my mother for seven years after my father passed away. Three months before my fathers passing my mother was in a car accident. She developed a very severe case of COPD and couldn't breath on her own or do many mundane tasks. From age 9 I stepped up and took care of her, I administered treatments, called 911 when there was a emergency  and lived in constant worry that one day when I woke up, she wouldn't. When I was 16 she was admitted to the hospital permanently. It was hard work but all I wanted to do was take care of her and wanted her home. She passed away in 2012. I understand the struggles of taking care of someone with a disability, I really do.  after my father passed away, we received Survivors benefits. It was barely enough to scrape by, I can make but one promise in this regard, I promise to try and make life better and easier not just for those who receive social security and other benefits, but for everyone who lives in this great state!  for a year and a half I lived next to Fort Meade in Maryland. I saw people who came back in all sorts of states. Our soldiers put their lives on the line for us every single day and we should be here to help when they need us! I'm no expert of the issue of psychology, far from it, but I will collaborate with those who are  in order to help our troops like they help us!  I seek change and want only to strengthen those nets while allowing opportunity for those nets not to become crutches!   Thank you for the post!"

Once you are a renter, all of the protections are on your side.   It can be a nightmare for the landlord.  It is just too risky, when that risk isn't needed.  My suggestion is that you instead rent a room for just yourself on a month-to-month lease to put a stake in the ground.  You can then find a job, and with a job, the barrier to entry should be much lower.  Good luck!"

newhampshire,3d5ol8,Sqwirl,-2,Tue Jul 14 13:39:05 2015 UTC,In this video he states that you are allowed to Start or End a function. I assume it's meant to wake the device and end a call. But cancelling a GPS route would be included.
newhampshire,3d5ol8,abbys_alibi,4,Tue Jul 14 14:57:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't assume anything. He also states that the device has to be hands free at all times, and that the exception that you're referring to is only ""to use one hand to activate or deactivate a function of the telephone, typically to begin a process of using hands free.""  In other words, it sounds to me like ""No, you can't fiddle with your gps unless you're doing so with one hand and only in order to activate its non-existent hands-free mode."""
newhampshire,3d5ol8,Sqwirl,-2,Tue Jul 14 15:34:31 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry - my gps is a single tap to cancel navigation.

newhampshire,3d5ol8,abbys_alibi,2,Tue Jul 14 17:33:43 2015 UTC,"The law doesn't work on implications, though. According to the wording of the law, use of any device is not permissible while driving unless specifically setting it to hands-free mode.  What about Waze? Can I tap my phone to confirm/deny an object in the road/police ahead? Of course not. You're defending a law that goes way beyond its stated purpose."

Are you saying that's permissible? Of course not.   Look, you can assume that these actions won't result in a ticket, but the police don't even have to prove you were doing anything. Touched your phone? That's a ticket."

I spend a lot of time in Hanover and work near the hospital (DHMC).  There are a ton of outdoor activities. You can hike Mount Cardigan, grab a kayak and paddle in the Connecticut river behind Dartmouth college and walk around Hanover, Norwich and White River Junction and walk into antique shops, grab ice cream, have a beer and dinner. Great opportunities for a photo walk if you're a photographer.  Lebanon Proper has Salt Hill and that's pretty much it for nightlife. There are two theatres in the area but I don't recommend them.  Fore U Ice Cream by Home Depot in West Lebanon is great. Ziggy's pizza in west-leb is also great. You can go Apple / fruit picking (I think Raspberries this weekend) at Poverty Lane Orchards in Lebanon. Fore U is also a driving range if you want to hit a few balls before getting ice cream.  I like Tuckerbox coffee in White River as my favorite spot but they close at 4PM to prepare for dinner and kick out most of the coffee lovers then.  Morano Gelato in Hanover has fresh daily - made Gelato and Italian style espresso drinks. Big Fatty's in White River has the best BBQ in our area.  Walk, Bike or Run the Rail Trail through Lebanon / Enfield and Canaan is a nice thing to do or you can fish off the Mascoma lake Bridge or swim in the nearby swimming area.  Finally, a short drive out to Quechee Gorge and hit that touristy spot with the Cabot store is a lot of fun. Or you can drive down to Harpoon brewer or Norwich Inn for a craft brewed pint of beer  There's a ton to do in this area. People saying there's nothing to do aren't from here or lack creativity. The Upper Valley has something for everyone. It's a little expensive compared to most of the 'real new hampshire towns' because of the hospital and Dartmouth college but there's a lot to do!

And let's not even get into the bigger issue which is labor force participation rate.  http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000  Less people working less hours will not lead to improved household income."
newhampshire,3da8da,invenio78,6,Tue Jul 14 23:01:37 2015 UTC,"Hours worked don't matter, productivity does. Jeb's arguing that more hours would theoretically lead to more productivity (or not due to burnout).   What he's wrong about is that workers would see those gains. Productivity has gone through the roof, compensation hasn't.  Which brings us to the truth that Jeb won't mention. Your wages aren't tied to your productivity, they're tied to your bargaining power. You can bring in a million dollars a day to your company but if there are other people that can do your job you'll be paid minimum wage."
newhampshire,3da8da,gnoah0,0,Wed Jul 15 07:30:27 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the job.  Some jobs pay on productivity, but most don't (and never have).  If you are on a salary, then obviously you are not paid on productivity.  Although I agree with you statements that the system should reward productivity this is really not the case.  It doesn't matter how many burgers you flip working at McDonalds, you are going to get paid X amount of dollars for each hour your work.  And I don't believe that is going to change anytime soon (regardless of what politicians say).  I think my points (and data) about labor force participation and hours worked are more realistic direct measures of why household incomes have not gone up.  If the average person asks you ""how can we make more money for our household""?  A much more realistic answer would be, work more hours and the stay at home Mom should get a part time job.  I know this may not be a popular answer, but this would actually generate a significant increase in income.  Waiting for your job to suddenly give you a big bonus because technology has made you more productive is wishful thinking."

Even one extra person working a part time job out of 30 households would result in a major shift.  There are many reasons why fewer people work and work less hours.  Some of these are in their control, some not.  I don't want to get way off track.  We are really talking about the original title of the post which is about Bush's comment to work longer hours.  People are simply working less overall.  I don't think it is surprising that household income is difficult to increase with people working less and less."
newhampshire,3da8da,invenio78,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:35:11 2015 UTC,"Um.  Your last graph doesn't say what you think it says.  Basic economic theory says that as scarcity of labor goes up, so too does wages.  It's the same as with any commodity or service.   Now, you could've (but you didn't) make the argument that declining labor participation is indication of a labor glut, in which case it's SUPPLY and not productivity, that determines wages.  In that case, gnoah0 is correct and that's it's bargaining power that's the issue.    The link between productivity and wages is standard economic theory.  I'm sure you think you're smarter than all those economists, but you're not.  Nevertheless, I'm confident you'll go on believing what you believe forever until you die."

The graph only indicates one thing, less of the potential labor force is currently working.  There are many things that can effect this number, not just wages, scarcity of labor, productivity, etc.  I'm not smarter than ""all those economists"" as you say.  There are thousands of variables that determine wages and labor force participation rate.  I don't want to get off track here.  I'm not discussing the 1,000 of variables that determine what percentage of the population works and how much they make.  I'm arguing a very simple premise:   We see less people working. Those that are working are working less hours. The above two criteria cause household incomes to either fall or not increase.   Do you disagree with these three points?"
newhampshire,3da8da,invenio78,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:51:05 2015 UTC,"I realize the point you're making -- if i earn $10 an hour and work 10 hours, I earn $100.  I work 20, I earn $200.   Yes, that's a straightforward point, but that's a banal observation and practically borders on tautological thinking.    The real question is why haven't wages gone up for 40 years?  Yes, if I worked 100 hours a week I would make more money, but why is there a wage/productivity gap in the first place?  You do the see the problem here, don't you?

newhampshire,3da8da,autopoietic_hegemony,-1,Wed Jul 15 13:47:05 2015 UTC,"Actually, income has gone up through the decades.  In the lower income groups it has risen although a very small amount.  In higher income groups there has been significant growth.  The top 20% has seen significant income gains.  This is all under the fact that less people are working and they are working less hours.  In all honesty, how much do you expect average household incomes to rise when more people in those households are not working, and the ones that do are working less hours?  http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/charts/census/household-income.html?household-incomes-mean-real.gif"

If working hours has a one-to-one correlation with working wages, shouldnt that be reflected in everyones wages going down?    I know you really want to believe people are just being lazy, or something.  But maybe, just maybe, this issue is a little more complicated?     Here, read this.  This talks about how wages and working hours have a differential relationship. Overwork used to actually hurt you economically even as hours worked went up, but now that it helps, working hours have gone down across the board (except in those professions where there's no such thing as hourly wages).    Also, check out this chart"
newhampshire,3da8da,autopoietic_hegemony,0,Wed Jul 15 15:35:17 2015 UTC,"Your chart actually hurts your argument. As your chart plainly demonstrates, earnings have flat-lined for everyone but the top 5% over the last 15 years,    Look at the chart again, you are reading it wrong.  Everybody past the bottom 40% (the 3rd, 4th, and 5th quintiles) have gone up significantly.  Remember the numbers are already adjusted for inflation already so if the line is going up, the incomes have gone up.  There is actual rise in the lower 40% although it is very small and hard to see on the graph due to scale.   but we know that people are working fewer hours overall. So there goes your argument. If there was a one-one correlation, it would go down as well.   No.  What I am saying is people are actually earning more.  If they earned the same, then their incomes would fall.  Despite less people working, and less hours put into work, people's incomes have actually gone up or at least stayed the same.  Hence, they are being paid more for each hour of work.  If I go from working 40 hours a week down to 35, yet my salary is the same,.. I actually got a raise.  My income stayed the same but my hourly salary went up.   But some of what you said actually comports with some of the observations economists have been making over the last 15 years. Some people are working more and some are working less, and some of it is reflected in wages, and some of it isn't. Here, read this[1] . Actually read the whole thing, because I won't respond unless you do.   This is all true.  There is great variation from person to person.  Yet, going back to the very fundamental points that I made:   Less people are working. Those that work are working less hours. Household incomes have gone up despite these negative factors.  In other words, people are making more for their work."

newhampshire,3da8da,autopoietic_hegemony,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:44:11 2015 UTC,"Look man, you clearly don't know how to read your own graph. It starts at 1965. You'll notice of course, because you're apparently an economist, that gains taper off starting in 2000. Yet productivity[1] has gone up.   I'm not an economist.  Yes, gains have been flat after 2000, but we also went through one of the worst recessions.  My point is that household income has gone up significantly for most people in the last 50 years.  Also, the productivity vs income graph that you put up is for ""goods producing workers"" only.  That is a small and decreasing subsection of the workforce and does not apply to the US workforce as a whole.  The US has moved from manufacturing to service based economy so that graph applies to a diminishing sector of the workforce.  Also, the whole idea that productivity will result in higher incomes for low skill labor is just wishful thinking.  Unless you have a job that gets paid on commission, your salary will most likely not be affected on whether you produce 10% more or less than somebody else in your position.  Not only that, but higher productivity can even lead to higher unemployment and subsequent lower wages.  Kind of like when robots start building cars instead of people.  They fire 90% workers as robots are making the cars.  Yet, you can argue that the productivity of the few guys left have gone up considerably, yet, he will not be paid 10 times as much as before.  Meanwhile, 9 other families lost the breadwinner.  Higher productivity for the job, yet much lower mean household income.    This is the mystery-- the decline since 2000. You say, people should work more. Dude, look at what happened in the bottom 3 quintiles of your own fucking graph. LOOK AT THEM. Their wages are the same. That means they stayed constant despite productivity gains, regardless of hours worked, regardless of... ANYTHING.   Again, I agree with you that the incomes have stayed stagnant since 2000.  This was not only in the bottom 3 quintiles but all of them (including the top 5%).  The biggest drops were during the two recessions we had during that period.  Unfortunately, this is an outcome of recessions, and it seems to effect all income levels.   Add to that the decline of income gains among the next quintile -- a quintile, overwhelmingly comprised of salaried professionals whose income is not measured in hourly wages -- and now you have cause for real concern. THIS IS THE PUZZLE. THAT IS WHY PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED. I know of only one economist on THIS EARTH who has made the arguments you have made here, Jeffrey Dorfman[2] , an agricultural scientist who has published no peer-reviewed articles stating your (and his) position.

And you clearly didn't read what I posted, so further discussion with someone who has obviously never even stepped foot into an economics class is a waste of my time.   It is your choice whether you want to continue the conversation.  At the end of the day, people still make substantially more than the previous generation, they work less hours, and less of them actually even work.  Is the picture all sunshine and roses.  No of course not.  Despite all our moaning, we are still better off financially than any other previous generation."

Perhaps rather than talking about the politicians that have been in office so long they can't really be considered people we talk about some of the lesser known candidates that actually might be able to make a difference. Bernie Sanders has been getting a lot of traction and there are other potential candidates that should be getting publicity too.

Broke up with a girl and took it real hard, then an opportunity to go to Full Sail for game design in Orlando popped up and I bumped into it. Couldn't wait to get out of town. Two years later after some rough times (aka I couldn't keep up with programming and dropped out) I moved to Myrtle Beach for a month until I got sick and finally decided it was time to go home.  I'm in NH now cuz my wife got into a doctorate program at UNH and have been up here for two years. This is a great state, and while I'm not nearly as homesick as I was when I was in Florida, I still miss Maryland. New Hampshire is a great place to live but Maryland will always be my home.

I cannot express how emotional I get seeing the gorgeous lush flora -- it's just such a far cry from the poisoned, dead, soul crushing trees and plants in the City.  That said, I'm not sure how much I'll love being back in NH for good. I hope I can find a happy medium where I live elsewhere, but can come back frequently for hiking and family time. I definitely think I would raise a family here in another 15 years when I'm ready to have kids. God, what a great state.  The drug thing though.. very scary.

newhampshire,3d487m,namkrav,2,Mon Jul 13 16:39:57 2015 UTC,"Based on what I am reading, I'm a bit removed from the growing drug problem.  I didn't realize it is as bad as it apparently is.  What drugs do you think should be made illegal that aren't?  Or did you have some other law in mind?"
newhampshire,3d487m,slayermcb,3,Mon Jul 13 18:17:28 2015 UTC,"I mean, heroin is already illegal, as is recreational sale/abuse of opiate medications. I just think the state needs to do more to help people recover. Maybe that means stricter laws regarding the use and sale of the drugs -- make people hit their bottom faster so they seek recovery faster. Maybe its something that will help increase quality of life for more citizens. Maybe its a state-wide health advocacy initiative to build communities - stronger communities have less drug abuse nd related deaths.  I'm recovering from a light opiate addiction right now, so I get it. They fucking rooockkkkkkk oh my god, blissful floating on a sleepy cloud. Amazing, the best, I love oxy.  I found my way out of that by hitting an emotional, spiritual bottom and being willing to put in the effort to recover because I couldn't deal w the pain anymore -- i had an internal bottom. Another type is an external bottom, where you've absolutely devastated your relationships, facing criminal charges, lost your home, etc. That kind of thing. Maybe the state mandates some pretty serious short term consequences for getting caught with this crap (especially in cases of overdose), but your record can be totally expunged after 3 months of rehab and 12 months of clean drug testing. Instead of putting people in jail, you give them the option of a clean slate and recovery.  Or maybe the state gives out more grants to community organizations with missions to eradicate drug use and abuse. Community building initiatives. Stuff like that.  I just know how much it sucked for me to be psychologically hooked on this stuff :( the drug feels great, but literally everything else (including the act of getting and being high) feels horrible. no one casually or recreationally uses opiates, you know? it's not like pot. Whenever I'm home reading the newspaper, there's always an unsympathetic/unempathetic letter to the editor about all the drugs. I just feel bad for people. It's a consequence of our over-medicated medical economy. Maybe that's what NH has to do - heavier regulation of the distribution of prescription medication. But again, heroin is the big thing now. It's very sad. Methadone and suboxone clinics need to be widespread. People need to be rewarded for getting off drugs. It's tough for people who haven;t been through it and don't have the same compulsion to get high - tough to understand. But everyone has something in their life that they do, that they wish they didn't do, but really struggle to stop. Watching too much TV, too many snickers, etc. It's the same thing, but motivated by people who aren't comfortable with life. I don't know  the one thing i absolutely think can't happen is legalization. that, a few decades down the line, i VERY FIRMLY BELIEVE would turn into a Soma/Brave New World situation. focus on recovery, focus on alternatives. people dont get addicted to opiates because they're happy, they get addicted because they or their lives are miserable. treat that. in my opinion.  sorry for the essay  But yeah, NH has an incredibly high number of drug related (opiate related). more deaths than traffic fatalities"
newhampshire,3d487m,slayermcb,2,Mon Jul 13 19:03:38 2015 UTC,"You hit the nail right on the head, my friend. As far as opiates go, there are a lot of problems that are only getting worse, but I'd much rather see that over heroine, which gets worse every time I get to go home. It really sucks seeing people I went to highschool with, stuck in the same towns, abusing the system and total junkies. Breaks my heart really, especially for the ones who had bright futures. Last time I went home, one of my old friends sold his toaster for crack. His fuckin toaster, man."
newhampshire,3d487m,slayermcb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:44:02 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the perspective and thoughts.  Thanks for taking the time.  NH has a growing Libertarian movement which I suspect wouldn't take such a hard stance against legalization of drugs.  Quite possibly they'd take a completely counter position.    I haven't done much thinking about this but given that people do drugs whether legal or illegal, I wonder if we'd be better off making the drugs legal and putting money towards support and recovery rather than law enforcement and penal systems.  I wonder if a hybrid solution might work best for opiates where use is legal but distribution or possession above a personal use amount would be illegal.    Just some off-the-cuff thinking."

Best short hike in NH is Boulder Loop Trail off the Kank, 3+ mile loop hike to some incredible cliffs.  Mt Chocura via Champney Falls is in the same area, great hike to a spectacular peak. half day hike Mt Flume via Oseo Trail from Lincoln woods is a solid half day+ hike up and back to the summit, you can add Mt.Liberty as well to the hike to make it a full day.  Lincoln Woods Trail, has many hikes off of it, but good swimming spots too, Pemi River & Franconia Falls. Also backcountry Trout fishing at Black Pond"

There are multiple trails and lookout points but the best part is the boulder caves hike. Basically, there's a boardwalk built through these glacial boulder deposits and you can either walk through the caves or stay on the boardwalk. It's beautiful and worth the trip.  If you go over the Kanc and up I-93 there are some great hikes lining Franconia notch. The Flume Gorge is gorgeous, and the Basin is quick and easy but has multiple harder hikes branching from it. The Flume Gorge does have an entrance fee though. You can rent kayaks to paddle around Echo Lake at the base of Cannon.  If you head towards Conway, you've got endless options. You can rent tubes to float down the river from North Conway to the Maine border. If you want a more challenging hike, head for Mount Kearsarge. It's a 4000 footer with a fire tower at the top. The Presidential Range is accessible from both Crawford (Route 302) and Pinkham (Route 16) notches. Trailheads are literally everywhere along these highways. Make sure to stop at the Forest Service Station on the Kanc in Conway. They can give you a nudge in the right direction depending on your skill level. Happy hiking!"

This obviously must have been posted elsewhere recently, as if you check the reviews its flooded with 1 stars referencing the video. If you filter for older reviews, they seem pretty standard for a hole in the wall rural Chinese restaurant.  What we can conclude, is that this place serves hundreds of people a week and is not going under by causing sickness. Ultimately, it's the cookery and servingware that is the last mile for ensuring food is safe to eat. The fact is, grease residue doesn't make a surface any more of a bacteria risk and we have no context as to the more material issues. The restaurant hired a cleaning crew, in this case white trash with a camera and some SOS pads, so we can't assume the improperly stored or contaminated foods were to be served and it is likely wasn't intended to be since the kitchen was closed for cleaning. A kitchen left for after-hours cleaning is always going to be able to be painted in a poor light by someone with an agenda, Gordon Ramsay has made a fortune for FOX by doing it.    Seize your pitchforks."

They are absolutely reoccurring and systematic. Raw meat over raw vegetables? Piles of mold? Improper storage of food? That sort of grease and food buildup takes months of inadequate cleaning and a terrible attitude in the kitchen. If you go here to eat after seeing this video then you are really taking a risk."
newhampshire,3cml6d,DieCommieScum,3,Thu Jul 9 16:25:26 2015 UTC,"They are absolutely reoccurring and systematic.   The only one we know for a fact is the inadequate surface scrubbing as evidenced by the grease build up. Everything else is just speculation.  The cross contamination we have no context on, that could have been left like that on a Sunday night after service with the notion that a cleaning crew was coming in on a Tuesday morning and that food wasn't never be served.   There's no breakout of sickness reported, supporting my point is appearances can be deceiving. That being said, you're right in that I wouldn't eat there but less with a concern for safety as much as what quality can be expected from a such a lazy operation."

It's a credit card for vet visits and medical visits. At my vet, if the visit is $200+, I have 18 months to pay it off without any interest. The emergency vet is $100+ with 6 months to pay it off with no interest.  I went to the dentist and had 6 months with no interest to pay off my cavities. It's definitely saved me tons of times. I would absolutely recommend it if you can't find a vet with a payment plan.   Good luck!"
newhampshire,3cm62e,j_collins,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:35:18 2015 UTC,"Seconding CareCredit. It's manageable but it's very important to pay within the promotional period or you get slammed with the interest, applied retroactively, and it's very high. But definitely a lifesaver. I recommend checking that out. You can find out directly from the provider the cost of the procedure and what duration of time they offer with 0% interest, then apply for the credit when you have that info."

Also, can't you just clip the nails regularly to avoid it overgrowing into the pad? That's like, $10 every few weeks.

I've owned dogs all my life, and a couple cats along the way. My previous set of dogs were amazing, and lived for a long time. A little problem though, was that one developed epilepsy around 5 years old, and diabetes a time after. This dog lived to be 14 years old and was happy every day of his life. There were some bad times, but with proper care and medication, he was always back on his feet. His name was Buddy, and that's just what he was to me and my family. He was also that too all the vet techs at the Amherst animal hospital. Without them, we would have been lost. They were mine and my family's rock in the bad times, and were always willing to help out in times of emergencies.  With our next set, we thought we would give Milford a try. It was a horrible experience, and they always tried to upsell us on everything. Mostly it was for those damn tracking chips of theirs, as they make a good chunk off of each one sold. We left them for Amherst shortly after we realized how bad Milford was.  I will sing the praises of the crew at Amherst animal hospital for the rest of my pet owning days. You can trust them."

If you have a a map of the area, and you REALLY should get one if you don't have one due to the many, sometimes poorly marked intersecting trails, the maps will show established campgrounds and shelters.

I also have the Map Adventures White Mountains map  which is one double sided map for the whole Whites, it's a smaller scale but just as good. I'd go this route unless you plan to do A LOT in the Whites.  As for the rest of the state, AMC puts out a map for the larger southern mountains (Grand Monadnock, Sunapee, Cardigan/Firescrew).

newhampshire,3cgft3,drunksterlingarcher,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:35:08 2015 UTC,Why? Serious question
newhampshire,3cgft3,StopNowThink,3,Tue Jul 7 23:03:33 2015 UTC,"It is extremely easy to get information on a person just based on a license plate. While it may not be a rule in this subreddit, many subreddits would consider a license plate to be posting of personal information like a phone number is. It can be very rude and lead to harassment outside of Reddit."
newhampshire,3cgft3,drunksterlingarcher,2,Wed Jul 8 00:08:08 2015 UTC,"But we all drive with visible license plates every day. A phone number is inherently private, whereas a plate number is public.   People only blur out plate numbers if it's their own, purely to dissociate a Reddit account with themselves."
newhampshire,3cgft3,StopNowThink,2,Wed Jul 8 00:16:18 2015 UTC,"It's not technically illegal, but it is against Reddit's terms of service.   https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_is_posting_personal_information_ok.3F"
newhampshire,3cgft3,gnoah0,0,Wed Jul 8 04:36:58 2015 UTC,"Phone numbers are not as inherently private as you believe. Phone number lookups exist just like they do for license plate numbers. Both can tie a name and other sensitive data to a number. While, most certainly you'll see hundreds of license plate numbers every day, it changes context when a single license plate number is posted to a website like reddit, where people can become malicious towards someone completely unexpected. The rules for posting information like this are done to make it harder for people to harass individuals outside of reddit. It doesn't matter if it's public information that is seen every day. Posting it to an online forum suddenly makes this license plate number stand out from the millions you see in a lifetime. It should be hidden out of respect to the individual to prevent any kind of harassment."

newhampshire,3cfr96,TheBashar,3,Tue Jul 7 15:52:04 2015 UTC,I don't know of any in the Upper Valley but if you find one I'd highly suggest going in for a test shave well before the big day. A poor experience with a SR shave can be uncomfortable at best and cause razor burn/bumps making you look awful at worst. Depending on how many people you're planning on having shaved it can take a long time to do properly; estimate roughly 30-45 minutes per person. Maybe consider giving them a quality shave brush as a gift instead. Simpsons' Duke 2 in Best is a great choice. Good luck and congratulations!
newhampshire,3cfr96,liog,2,Tue Jul 7 16:57:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the responses!  I decided not do the shaving the day of.  None of us uses a straight blade to shave.  In fact I have a beard, but I shave my head.  I don't want to risk irritation and other skin issues on the day of the wedding.  I will look into the Lebanon Barber for a beard trim though."

They also have 5 or  6 chairs going so it wouldn't have to be an all day event"
newhampshire,3cfr96,skankopotamus,3,Tue Jul 7 17:09:24 2015 UTC,"I'm going to echo what /u/averagejoe3000 said and suggest that you think twice before doing this on the day of the wedding, since I've had barbers tell me the same thing. Unless you and your groomsmen already regularly shave with a straight blade and are used to it, having it done by a barber is likely to cause all sorts of irritation and ugliness. And if they're already shaving with a straight blade, they probably don't need a barber to do it for them.  I just got married myself; I got my groomsmen personalized engraved decanters and ice sphere molds, and then I took them out to breakfast on the big day before we got ready. Let them take care of their own grooming."
newhampshire,3cfr96,bostonmolasses,2,Tue Jul 7 19:17:59 2015 UTC,I believe the Lebanon Barber does upon request. You should call him and see if he would shutdown for the morning for you.   http://www.lebanonbarber.com/
newhampshire,3cfr96,JinDover,2,Tue Jul 7 17:25:50 2015 UTC,"bostonmolasses' idea about reserving the shop for the entire party is a good one. I'd also have to agree that you test out the barber and shave before the day. I've had good and not so good in the straight shaving category. Everyone's mileage will vary.  Another angle on this idea is to gift your groomsmen with a straight razor (or, preferred, a double edge razor) set to get them started.   Razor, shaving soap, brush, and bowl.    The reddit sub  wicked_edge is a great place to get information. It's a sizable community of guys (and woman) that prefer a traditional shave and are VERY forthcoming with suggestions and links to help you get the best set-up for your party, in your price range. Just announce yourself ask about a grooms gift and the information will flow! They even have sets put together by price range, for beginners (see the page's FAQ), and there's a guy over there - Leisureguy - that literally wrote the book on straight and double edge shaving.  Good Luck and Congratulations!  -- A Double Edge Enthusiast"

(""I won't vote for you if you don't do what I want"" is not persuasive.)  The argument I might offer here is that New Hampshire has the second-lowest gun murder rate in the U.S. I would also take a look at comparative rates in other states with and without provisions like that being considered, and what evidence may be suggested by those figures.  I would also avoid any arguments about rights. Besides the fact that they've heard it all before many times and don't need (or want) to be reminded yet again, federal courts have repeatedly upheld the power of legislatures to place reasonable restraints on Second Amendment rights in the interests of public safety. Argument must therefore advance on a reasoned, fact-based basis, and it's on the person advancing the argument to present credible and persuasive evidence."

If I want to fish or hunt, I need a licence.   For better or worse, the right to keep and bear firearms is a constitutionally enumerated right with all the perks and freedoms that enjoys.  It sits nestled amongst your right to free speech, exercise of religion, privacy, due process, voting, etc.    Would the idea that you need a license to speak freely on your blog freak you out?  Do you like the idea of having to get a license to vote?  To practice religion?  If none of these bother you, then you're good to go... otherwise, the degradation of any constitutionally enumerated right is deleterious to all the other rights, and setting a precedent that licensure is okay for one lowers the judicial scrutiny for all the others.    If you don't like the idea of state-approved speech, then you should probably oppose state-approved licensure for the second amendment."
newhampshire,3cc9xw,ChopperIndacar,5,Tue Jul 7 19:14:57 2015 UTC,Best response I have yet to hear.  I agree that every precedent set creates a slippery slope for the continued erosion of personal rights.  I may just be drawing the line in the wrong place.  I have witnessed how other rights have fallen victim to a slow yet relentless moving of line of what is tolerable under the law. I am not sure my opinion is changed but you do provide something to consider.
newhampshire,3cc9xw,Yumeijin,3,Tue Jul 7 02:25:58 2015 UTC,"Bit offtopic here, but... I've been studying law as a hobbyist for some number of years now.  The concept of judicial scrutiny was completely foreign to me, but it's really the core of the Constitution.    For as much as people obsess over so many things, judicial scrutiny is really something to get lathered up over.  The Supreme Court's recent holding that marriage was a civil right, and as such, deserved strict judicial scrutiny was a big win for civil liberties, whatever your beliefs.  If we could get the courts to more evenly apply that strict scrutiny to things like the NSA's spying, and free-speech zones, I believe America would be a far better place.   The hard part of judicial scrutiny is in supporting it even when you don't like it.  4 of our existing Supreme Court justices are happy to apply strict scrutiny protections to gay marriage, but will only begrudgingly extend the lesser intermediate scrutiny for firearms ownership.    The justices on the other side are more reserved with all forms of scrutiny, so while at least they're more consistent, sadly, they are consistently less stringent in the application of judicial scrutiny, such that more rights are subject to government intervention more of the time than not.    I'm basically ranting at this point, but it's a position I think that merits more explanation.  The immediate obviousness isn't there without a deeper understanding of how rights work at a judicial level, but for civil libertarians like myself, it's worth giving consideration to the broader implication of all civil rights and how you'd like them to be treated.   If you've made it this far, thanks for listening."

newhampshire,3cc9xw,Yumeijin,3,Tue Jul 7 12:46:23 2015 UTC,"I suppose that depends very much on how you define ""bear"".  ""Bear"" obviously means ""carry"", so at least some form of carriage is constitutionally protected.  As the right to carry is expressly defined in the Constitution, and the government is prohibited from infringing that right, also per the second amendment, then the manner of carriage should be up to the individual, not to the state.

newhampshire,3cc9xw,issue9mm,2,Wed Jul 8 14:42:20 2015 UTC,"Constitutional carry:       In the United States, the term constitutional carry is a neologism for the legal carrying of handgun, either openly or concealed, without the requirement of a government permit.    The phrase does not typically refer to the unrestricted carrying of a long gun, a knife, or other weapons. The scope and applicability of such laws or proposed legislation can vary from state to state.  The phrase ""constitutional carry"" reflects the view that the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution permits no restrictions or other regulations on gun ownership, although District of Columbia v. Heller, decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2008, suggests that some state or local controls may be allowed, at least as to certain types of weapons. Prior to Heller there have been many other cases that have upheld both state and federal gun control laws under the Second Amendment. The Heller case was upheld by the Court in McDonald v. Chicago, passed in 2010, that found that the 2d and 14th Amendments to the Constitution were ""fully incorporated"" and thus the right to ""...keep and bear arms applies to the States and not 'in a watered-down version' but 'fully applicable'...,"" and does limit State and Local Governments in passing Laws that restrict this ""individual"" and ""fundamental"" Right to ""...keep and bear arms,"" for Self-Defense. Self-Defense was considered by the SCOTUS a ""...central component of the 2d Amendment."" All of the state laws described below operate in the context of federal regulation regarding the transfer and sale of firearms. Firearms and ammunition are subject to taxation as well.  Constitutional carry is also sometimes known as ""Vermont carry"",  ""permitless carry"", or ""unrestricted carry.""

newhampshire,3cc9xw,Yumeijin,0,Wed Jul 8 14:56:42 2015 UTC,"""Bear"" obviously means ""carry"", so at least some form of carriage is constitutionally protected.   Exactly.   As the right to carry is expressly defined in the Constitution, and the government is prohibited from infringing that right, also per the second amendment, then the manner of carriage should be up to the individual, not to the state.   That's the part that's up for debate. So long as you're able to carry a firearm, your right is not being infringed upon. Whether or not you're able to carry it in the manner you'd prefer is irrelevant to the counter-point that this infringes on one's constitutional right.   Broadly speaking, carriage of all forms was expressly permitted effectively everywhere until the freed slaves started trying to exercise the right. We're still working to undo that overstep, but six states currently have the right idea.   According to that article, precedent has been established that states can determine controls on firearms.  Regardless, despite all the hollering about the constitutional right to bear arms, I don't see anyone clamoring for the mentally unsound or others who would be denied a weapon due to behavioral history having their rights infringed upon. This doesn't seem tobe  a matter of principle so much as it is people throwing a tantrum they don't get to bear arms precisely the way they want."
newhampshire,3cc9xw,issue9mm,2,Wed Jul 8 14:57:36 2015 UTC,"So long as you're able to carry a firearm, your right is not being infringed upon.    So then, as long as you're able to speak, your right to free speech isn't being infringed, yes?  If your website is censored by the government, no problem?  If your emails are intercepted, deleted, and never reach their destination, no problem?  What if you're only allowed to speak at dinner time?  What if you're allowed to speak as much as you want, but aren't allowed to whisper?  Are none of those infringing your right to free expression?    According to that article, precedent has been established that states can determine controls on firearms.   The article is quoting Hassan, and Hassan is wrong.  The 2008 decision she refers to is ""Heller"", which upholds the right of citizens to keep arms, but does not address carriage in any way.  It does have approximately one sentence from Scalia that acknowledges that older, state-level courts acknowledged that there might be validity to concealed carry bans, but then he went on to say that they specifically didn't evaluate those as they were not in issue before the court.    The issue of who can and cannot carry, and how has not yet made it to the Supreme Court.    That said, the issue of whether there is or isn't precedent is irrelevant.  There's precedent indicating the validity of slavery.  The issue is how we want rights to be treated, and barring concealed carry is not at all unlike banning the use of whispers, or the other ridiculous scenarios I mentioned already."
newhampshire,3cc9xw,Yumeijin,0,Wed Jul 8 16:08:12 2015 UTC,"So then, as long as you're able to speak, your right to free speech isn't being infringed, yes?   Correct. Since you're making reference to the first amendment, let's also point out that even though the amendment clearly states    Congress shall make no law ... abridging freedom of speech   that there still exist restrictions--that is to say, abridgements to free speech. These range from the famous inciting actions that would harm others to libel. The Amendments are not absolute.   If your website is censored by the government, no problem?   Is the website mine? Do I own the servers? Do I own the means of connecting to it? More likely than not--no.   If your emails are intercepted, deleted, and never reach their destination, no problem?   Are the servers containing my e-mails mine? Are the servers containing the e-mails going to their destination owned by their address holders? Are we both instead essentially leasing the space from a third party who retains ownership and has the discretion to do with the e-mails as they please?   What if you're only allowed to speak at dinner time?   Are we talking about a law that prohibits the ability to bear arms excepting a specific time-frame, e.g. ""Dinner Time?""   What if you're allowed to speak as much as you want, but aren't allowed to whisper?    Better example. So long as I'm able to speak, my right to speech isn't being infringed upon. Your complaint that you can't speak in exactly the way you want to seems trivial, and the volume of the complaint disproportionate to the censure.   Are none of those infringing your right to free expression?   Let's make this simple: Does this law prevent you from bearing arms? No. Your right to bear arms is not being infringed upon.  If this is truly a matter you care deeply about, though, I expect you to be championing for the mentally ill and violent convicts whose rights to bear arms are being infringed upon. I'm assuming that your stance is the amendments should be absolutes.   The article is quoting Hassan, and Hassan is wrong. The 2008 decision she refers to is ""Heller"", which upholds the right of citizens to keep arms, but does not address carriage in any way.   Wrong.   Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. From Blackstone through the 19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. See, e.g., Sheldon, in 5 Blume 346; Rawle 123; Pomeroy 152–153; Abbott 333. For example, the majority of the 19th-century courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amendment or state analogues. See, e.g., State v. Chandler, 5 La. Ann., at 489–490; Nunn v. State, 1 Ga., at 251; see generally 2 Kent *340, n. 2; The American Students’ Blackstone 84, n. 11 (G. Chase ed. 1884).   So long as the Supreme Court recognizes State Laws and does not declare them unconstitutional, it is constitutional.   That said, the issue of whether there is or isn't precedent is irrelevant.    Precedence is always relevant.   There's precedent indicating the validity of slavery.   Which is overruled by its own amendment and more recent decisions which establish a new precedent.   The issue is how we want rights to be treated, and barring concealed carry is not at all unlike banning the use of whispers, or the other ridiculous scenarios I mentioned already.   What's ridiculous is throwing a fit over whether you can hide your gun or not. Amendments are not absolute. The Supreme Court, among numerous others, has reinforced this idea. Amendments being absolutes is a bad idea. If you'd like to argue that point, I invite you to provide rationale.  Given the predisposition for blindly downvoting anything people disagree with in this subreddit, though, my bar is set awfully low."
newhampshire,3cc9xw,issue9mm,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:31:17 2015 UTC,"Your entire premise is predicated on the notion that the first amendment is not absolute, right?  That, since there are laws against inciting violence, or libel, or defamation, that for some reason, the right to free speech is lessened.    That is a poor comparison though, as none of those laws disallow speech, they simply insist that speech must be responsibly used, or there will be punishments.  There is the presumption of lawfulness to speech that is not extended to firearms.  There are no laws that insist that your exercise of speech must be cleared by the state before hand.    A better comparison would be laws against assault, murder, or negligent discharge of a firearm.    That said, I'm not ""throwing a fit"", I'm simply providing my rationale for why I believe that rights should be treated more absolutely.  Your claim that they aren't absolute because they aren't absolute isn't terribly compelling to me, and your mismatched comparisons even less so.    That said, by your logic, it would be permissible to demand a license for speech, or voting, so, y'know, if that's how you think the constitution is supposed to limit the government, then that's your right. I think you're flat wrong, and while I've probably studied the issue more extensively than you have, that doesn't make me right by default.  I'm just trying to raise awareness that sloppily misapplying post-facto punishments as de facto bans is deleterious to the rights of the citizenry on the whole.    But so long as you're categorizing your ideas as reason, and everybody else as ""throwing a fit"", I suggest that your position is probably too intractable to waste much more effort on."
newhampshire,3cc9xw,ChopperIndacar,0,Thu Jul 9 17:36:40 2015 UTC,"That, since there are laws against inciting violence, or libel, or defamation, that for some reason, the right to free speech is lessened.   They're laws that restrict your ability to express oneself. They are speech that has been abridged.    That is a poor comparison though, as none of those laws disallow speech, they simply insist that speech must be responsibly used, or there will be punishments.   And the definition of ""responsible use"" and what merits a punishment and to what degree is dictated by the courts. The fact that these laws even exist, however, is still lessening.   There are no laws that insist that your exercise of speech must be cleared by the state before hand.   Every try to establish a public protest? Guess what, you can't just plop your ass in the middle of the road with a protest sign.   A better comparison would be laws against assault, murder, or negligent discharge of a firearm.   Not really, the purpose was to demonstrate that amendments are not absolute, and can be infringed upon by circumstances dictated by courts. The first amendment is a shining example of that, and the same can be applied to the second amendment. The point is a law that restricts the use of firearms or how they're carried is not violating any constitutional right, in spite of what some here seem to think.   That said, I'm not ""throwing a fit"", I'm simply providing my rationale for why I believe that rights should be treated more absolutely.    It looks more like throwing a fit to me, considering the insignificance of the detail and how little impedance it presents. You can still bear arms, you just can't hide them. There is nothing here that merits the counter-argument that this infringes upon an amendment and as such should be curtailed.   Your claim that they aren't absolute because they aren't absolute isn't terribly compelling to me, and your mismatched comparisons even less so.   I can't help how compelling the argument is--but that's the way things are, and it's for the better. Amendments aren't absolute, the degree to which they provide a right has been governed by courts for years. They should not be absolute--because absolutes are shortsighted and broad, failing to take into consideration any intricacies.   That said, by your logic, it would be permissible to demand a license for speech,   Again, ever tried to arrange a protest? You'll need to get it cleared.   or voting,    Are you able to vote without your ID?   I think you're flat wrong, and while I've probably studied the issue more extensively than you have, that doesn't make me right by default.   Well, there are no ""rights"" and ""wrongs,"" merely our belief in what is right or wrong. I happen to believe that laying down particulars like ""You can't say whatever you want if it's a lie meant to hurt someone's reputation"" or ""You can't carry a firearm if you're going to hide it from people"" have their place beside particulars like ""You can't say what you want if it's going to physically hurt people"" or ""You can't carry a firearm if you're mentally unsound.""  No matter how extensively you've studied, you'd have to make some damn persuasive arguments to convince me otherwise.   I'm just trying to raise awareness that sloppily misapplying post-facto punishments as de facto bans is deleterious to the rights of the citizenry on the whole.   Your problem is you are looking at a regulation as a punishment inflicted on people before they've committed a crime. Any license is intended to ensure that any law-abiding citizen engaging in a specific act is capable of doing so responsibly, to a certain criteria. If that's something you consider a punishment, I'm not sure what to say.   But so long as you're categorizing your ideas as reason, and everybody else as ""throwing a fit"", I suggest that your position is probably too intractable to waste much more effort on.   You know, you've yet to actually provide a coherent argument against my reason. You keep trying to diminish my argument by being dismissive, but you're not actually addressing any point. You're already wasting effort."
newhampshire,3cc9xw,Yumeijin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:59:16 2015 UTC,"Licensure, by its very nature, is infringement.    Are you able to vote without your ID?   Yes.  I've literally never once had to present ID to vote.  Perhaps that is not true in all jurisdictions, but where I live, it is, and that's the way it ought to be.     Your problem is you are looking at a regulation as a punishment inflicted on people before they've committed a crime. Any license is intended to ensure that any law-abiding citizen engaging in a specific act is capable of doing so responsibly, to a certain criteria.   Your analogies to 1.4 assertions are also, again, deeply flawed.  Yes, you have the right to peaceably assemble, and you do not need a license to do so.  You do need a license if you intend to commandeer a public space for that effort.  That is not a license to protest, it is a license to commandeer the space for the exercise of protest.  Organize a protest on your property and you don't need a license.    If it's as you say, then surely you wouldn't object to a license to blog, or to speak at an open mic night.  You don't need licensure for those things, obviously, because having to ask permission to exercise one's first amendment rights is counter to constitutional restraint.    It looks more like throwing a fit to me   Well, fair enough then.  I apologize if my informed, reasoned arguments based on legal jurisprudence are, in your opinion, equatable to a three year old's tantrums, though I suppose that speaks well of the children in your life, or the evenness of their tantrums.     You know, you've yet to actually provide a coherent argument against my reason.   Which is appropriate I suppose, since your reasons have been mostly comprised of falsity."

newhampshire,3cc9xw,InfectedUvula,-5,Tue Jul 7 00:05:54 2015 UTC,"Well, my gut tells me no, but with  wartime military services drafts, abortion laws, drug prohibition, criminalized suicide ordinances and other precedents, I would have to answer with a definite ""Maybe"".    The ownership of your body argument really falls apart when you explain that the purpose of a weapon is to inflict damage on a body of someone other than yourself.  Even if the state categorically avowed all ownership of your person, I would not extend ownership privileges of any other body that you may feel compelled to injure."
newhampshire,3cc9xw,skankersores,5,Tue Jul 7 14:52:41 2015 UTC,"The legitimate purpose of a firearm is for self defense, hunting, or recreation.

Although I understand the point you are making, the truth is: If everybody would just agree to use a firearm in a manner that is considered legitimate, the need for any legislation regarding firearms would be moot.  This is the very reason for the lack of laws requiring a licence for the transport of a foam pool noodle. Now, I am sure that everyone in this thread is law-abiding gun owner that has never had a moment of anger or poor judgment and would never be involved in violating even the most innocuous civil ordinance, there are those outside of us that sometimes forget the list of legitimate uses and need to be held accountable.  *http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/homicide.htm"

Why does a sector of the gun lobby have such an objection to such requirements?    Wild game animals and fish are considered the property of the State, so you need a permit to harvest them.  That is the basis for the hunting/fishing permit requirement.   Roads are considered the property of the State, so you need a permit to drive on them.  That is the basis for the driver's license requirement.  Carrying a gun does not directly necessarily involve the usage of State property, therefore the aforementioned justifications fall flat."

Should/could that extend to carrying a concealed firearm? I dunno. My speculation: many people in favor of this bill would likely be in favor of removing fishing/hunting (maybe even drivers?) license requirements as well, so using those as an example of why a CCP is necessary might not resonate too well. But that's just speculation. I've got no horse in this race."

newhampshire,3c5c47,ChopperIndacar,-2,Mon Jul 6 13:57:31 2015 UTC,I don't see how any of that addresses what I said.    Honking won't teach a lesson to people who cut you off.  And people who create dangerous situations by driving aggressively may continue to be aggressive/escalatory if you prolong the interaction by trying to teach them a lesson.   Feel free to address these points or completely sidestep them again.
newhampshire,3c5c47,Bootsk8,2,Mon Jul 6 14:03:34 2015 UTC,"Sidestep what point? I wasn't present at the situation in question. I did not share the same relationship that they had, I spoke from personal experience and you seem to believe that I'm ignorant for sharing my personal opinion, which is quite apparent when your point was surrounding doubt around my opinion.   As I can see you have gleefully jumped on the chance to attempt to belittle someone's opinion. Go get your kicks somewhere else buddy."

But by all means, share your personal experience that leads you to believe a group of 4 motorists cutting someone off in unison will be receptive to being ""taught a lesson"" that cutting people off is wrong."

newhampshire,3c5c47,ChopperIndacar,-2,Mon Jul 6 14:28:37 2015 UTC,"From your advice, I guess the point of the horn is to make you feel better after someone knowingly wrongs you on the road, and possibly escalate the situation even though it's already 100% over and done with."

newhampshire,3c5c47,RaveDigger,6,Mon Jul 6 14:45:40 2015 UTC,I'm a biker and if I were to cut someone off I'd expect to get honked at.
newhampshire,3c5c47,willyb99,2,Sun Jul 5 00:03:42 2015 UTC,It is sad that there is an amount of fear by honking. I don't want to lose a mirror or something else. A bike can just zip away and disappear of they damage your car or you.
newhampshire,3c5c47,tommysmuffins,2,Sun Jul 5 13:44:44 2015 UTC,"99% of the time riders are just the same as everybody else.  Maybe a little bit braver, but the differences end there.  Even the car talk guys say it's OK to honk if you get cut off.  A lot of the time people are totally oblivious when they're driving, and will never learn any better if no one informs them how bad they are.  The only exception might be when you encounter guys who are obviously part of a MC, with the rocker patches on the back and something identifying the state they're from."

newhampshire,3c5c47,wickedhip,-5,Sun Jul 5 12:37:16 2015 UTC,Since the purpose of a car horn is to indicate displeasure or irritation or some other type of annoyance your use in this instance is appropriate.  People sometime lose situational awareness and need me to remind them of their shortcomings as drivers.  On the other hand I have never been to New Hampshire and am just passing by.
newhampshire,3c5c47,Long_dan,3,Sun Jul 5 02:30:00 2015 UTC,"Displeasure & irritation? I always thought the horn was a warning device to let other vehicles know you're there in case they enter your lane without seeing your vehicle, and to draw the attention of distracted drivers to a change in the traffic light."
newhampshire,3c5c47,ChopperIndacar,0,Sun Jul 5 12:03:32 2015 UTC,So you are one of those who think it is a safety device instead of an admonition to drive the way I think you should.  How wonderfully quaint!  Horn is weapon of chastisement to frighten inferior drivers into returning home lest they face my wrath!  Then I lock my doors and refuse eye contact.

newhampshire,3c3xd8,starista,2,Sat Jul 4 15:11:07 2015 UTC,Thank you! So there are usually no physical address deliveries?  What I mean is - we have a physical street address as well as a PO Box. If we order stuff from Amazon (which is frequent) do we send it to the physical address or PO Box?  Thanks again and sorry for ignorance!!
newhampshire,3c3xd8,livin4donuts,4,Sat Jul 4 16:23:14 2015 UTC,"You can do either. If it's a physical address, you run the risk of bad weather damaging the package, but if it's a PO Box, it can be inconvenient to get to the office during their open hours, unless you work odd hours."

newhampshire,3c3xd8,picklehaub,6,Sat Jul 4 18:33:28 2015 UTC,"I live in Eastman.  I've lived in the southwest, west coast, and up and down the east coast.    I work in Hanover, and so we generally shop to the north, although Concord and Manchester are only a little over an hour away.  Boston is 2 hours away (depending on traffic and where in boston you are going).    1) Grocery shopping:  We shop in two places primarily, the co-op (rt 120 between lebanon and Hanover) for all produce, meats, and many more upscale groceries.  For staples like paper towels and such we use Hannaford in West Labanon.  We also use Rumbrook for sandwiches and quick things like Walpoole ice cream.  IT's a convenience store for us.  We do eat next door at the Farmer's Table a lot.    2)  I have a BMW with x-drive and it's a beast in the snow.  My wife has a mini cooper and she gets around just fine.  Snow tires are a must, 4wd is not.    3) Yes, people jog in eastman a lot.  I walk my dogs twice a day, and in my neck of the woods, I can take a half hour walk and only see one car.   4) We lose power all the time here, it's insane.  We have a whole house generator, but frankly it's purely a luxury.  Power doesn't generally stay off for more than a half a day, so your food is generally fine, and if you don't mind the lifestyle interruption, losing the power isn't the end of the world.  In the last place I lived, I lost power for about 2 hours in 8 years.  Here we lose power monthly.  I was without power for two of the three days last 4th of July.    5) I came here with AT&T and now have Verizon.  I'd argue it's a little better, but they both suck.  It's so hilly that nothing will work as well as you are used to.  I needed a micro-cell when on ATT in my house, but with Verizon I have two bars without one.    6) No clue, we have no children.  There's a lot of family stuff in the hanover and lebanon area.    7) If you live in eastman, you'll need a PO box for USPS  deliveries.  Anything from UPS and FedEX comes to your door.  However FedEx seems to be handing off the packages to the USPS for the last leg, and you'll get those at the post office (really annoying).  Get amazon prime, there isn't a lot of shopping in this area.  Some things are good, others are completely missing.    Things you'll want to check out:  4-aces diner:  Not much to look at from the outside, but great food Worthy Burger:  Worthy.. Farmers Markets:  Our favorite is the Norwich VT on Sat Mornings. Farm-way:  Outdoor clothing, and so much more King Arthur Flour:  A store, bakery and cafe"
newhampshire,3c3xd8,j_collins,2,Sat Jul 4 19:04:02 2015 UTC,"Closest full size grocery stores are in Lebanon, with several to choose from.

newhampshire,3c3xd8,Ubermensch72,2,Sat Jul 4 22:53:46 2015 UTC,"We have UPS and FedEx packages delivered right to our front door.  Any packages that ship via USPS just get a yellow ""Parcel"" card in the PO box, which you give to the guys at the counter and they get the package for you.

I don't have one, and when we lose power we fill the tubs with water and conserve heat as much as possible. The longest we've gone without power (mid winter) was a weekend, and RIGHT when it was getting down to the 50's in our house the power came back on. At that moment, I wish I'd had a generator -- but that big of an outage rarely happens in my neighborhood. If I had a wood stove, I wouldn't even bother with a generator."

You certainly won't regret having 4WD in the winter as there are some dirt roads throughout Eastman.  In the summer there are definitely some people jogging.  There is also a jogging path that follows I-89 and is accessible by one of the exits of Eastman.  You're right about Verizon, but you may not need a Network Extender; I don't recommend buying one until you're there.  As for activites for your kid, Grantham Indoor is the local soccer location.

newhampshire,3c4qhq,telemecanique,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:23:47 2015 UTC,"Any car 1996+ must be equipped with an OBD2 computer yada yada and pass an emissions test.  However, since your engine (the source of your emissions) is pre-96 (otherwise it would be OBD2) then I would say no, you probably won't have to pass emissions and you'll only need safety.  However, if your car is has a cherry bomb or a fart cannon and it's annoying loud, then they'll probably fail you. So as long as your car isn't obnoxious sounding, then you should be all good."

The Meredith Library is a bit tight. Meredith itself has many cafes and restaurants with lobby's and bars. The Tilton Library looks kinda like a church. The Franklin Library was built with a Carnegie donation. The Alton Library is nice enough. If you're willing to drive a little further, the Gilmanton Library was built in a large barn and has a cool balcony. There's not a lot of Panera's or Starbucks that I can think of. There might be luck to be had at golf course cafes.  Lochmere, Waukewan, Ridgewood, etc.  If you're dressed like a golfer, and you buy a coffee, a lot of those cafes probably wouldn't mind. How about the Gunstock ski lodge?  Similar to the golf courses in that there's plenty of capacity.   Good luck!"

And if they're passing you on either side they are likely to be in your blindspot. Motorcycles scare the shit out of me already. On more than one occasion I've looked twice, flicked my signal to merge, and out of nowhere a crotchrocket comes zooming by going 90+ weaving in and out of traffic. I don't want to hit them as much as they want to get hit by me. The lanes are there for a reason."
newhampshire,3c01u3,Trancefuzion,14,Fri Jul 3 17:43:43 2015 UTC,What you're describing is different than what I'm talking about.  I think most people would agree that lane splitting at high speeds is dangerous.  The situation that I was responding to involves lane splitting at a reasonable speed (10-15 mph) when traffic is at a standstill.  This type of lane splitting has been shown to be safe and is legal in California and most of Europe.
newhampshire,3c01u3,RaveDigger,5,Fri Jul 3 17:48:39 2015 UTC,This is true. But if it's legal in traffic doesn't that make it legal at any other point on the highway? Or does the law restrict it to a certain speed? It just makes me uncomfortable as a driver. I would never want to be responsible for injuring someone like that.
newhampshire,3c01u3,Trancefuzion,4,Fri Jul 3 18:08:09 2015 UTC,For more on lane-splitting (from three Californian motorcyclists' perspectives):
newhampshire,3c01u3,Spenray,10,Fri Jul 3 18:58:54 2015 UTC,"The law would certainly have to account for the rider's speed while lane splitting.  Though it's legal in California, CHP can still issue tickets if lane splitting is not done in a safe manner at a reasonable speed.  Also, in regards to   I would never want to be responsible for injuring someone like that.   In California, if there is an accident involving a rider who is lane splitting, the rider is automatically at fault (I think).  I'd just like to say I appreciate you taking the time to ask questions and understand the issue."
newhampshire,3c01u3,RaveDigger,5,Fri Jul 3 20:18:58 2015 UTC,I appreciate the enlightenment good sir.
newhampshire,3c01u3,Trancefuzion,2,Fri Jul 3 18:11:44 2015 UTC,I agree 100% I am currently living in California where it's legal and it is so dangerous. They always startle the shit out of me. I can't just always be looking in all the spots at them same time never know when the are going to pop up. Luckily the law states that they will always be at fault if they get into an accident while driving down the middle. But I really don't want to hit one but I feel like its eventually going to happen.

But what I see is actually a ""holiday problem"".  America is a ""system"" of people going here, there, and everywhere.  It works when it's an average day, but it starts to break down fast when it's a non-average day - like a holiday.  So what we really need is 365 average days.  We do that by re-categorizing paid time off for holidays to personal days.  Simply put, we stop having everybody take the same days off and instead have people take days off that they want.  The original holidays can still be observed on the calendar, but we do everything we can to spread things out to avoid mobs.  My large family used to be strict about celebrating Christmas on the 25th.  But that's crazy because of snow and all the other people fighting to do the same thing.  So now it's celebrated three weeks earlier.  The traffic patterns are normal for us!  It makes no sense for an entire country to take the same day off.  It's just a day.  Giving workers all personal days instead of holidays keeps America running smoothly and makes the traffic patterns remain as close to normal as possible."

This asshole had NH plates. an asshole on a cell phone, in a cadillac escalade with NH vanity plates, sped out of a parking lot without looking at traffic nearly hitting me and another vehicle. another asshole in a Honda Pilot blew right through a stop sign on Kearsage Rd by Cranmore almost hitting me and causing me to slam on my brakes.

Sure, its not a universal rule but when I'm trying to merge into a lane because my lane is ending, 9 times out of 10 the person obstinately driving beside me, refusing to acknowledge my existence and let me in has MA plates.

They WILL let you cut in and do what you need to do, but you need to do it FAST.  If someone in MA cut you off, its probably because you missed the 2 second window they gave you to do what you needed to do.  Otherwise, they are going to use the space and you can wait.

They will let the car in front of them completely clear the intersection before they start going.  I remember being shotgun in a Mainer's car in CT and wanting to melt into the seat as we did that at EVERY intersection on a major road.  I could feel the hate from the people behind us.  And don't get me started on the Maine State Police or their INSANE 6 points on a 15mph over speeding ticket.  THAT'S AGGRAVATED DUI IN NH.  Two tickets doing 80 (ok, 85 now that the limit is 70) in one year in ME and they will suspend your license.   Maine is a nice place to visit, but I try to avoid the place most of the time.

Having worked in real estate previously, and knowing Brady Sullivan's reputation, I would say that it is totally plausible that they may have downplayed the risks. Unfortunately, it's possible that they still could have followed the letter of the law by giving proper disclosures and having an attachment signed. That would mean that legally they have done what they needed to, and  then in that case it is on the shoulders of the tenant to A) read the brochure (ha) and B) order an inspection of their apartment to determine the location of lead paint.   From reading the article, it's not just that the lead paint was in the building, but they went about having it removed improperly. I think that's where the legal case lies, not that tenants weren't informed of there being lead paint."

newhampshire,3bx7vo,strangerflower,3,Fri Jul 3 02:48:52 2015 UTC,"Regardless of the levels of lead in your blood, you should contact the attorneys that are putting together the suit.

I would also recommend contacting a couple of the agencies listed in the brochure I linked to see what your options are.   I hate when companies rush a legal contract.

I wanted to bring fireworks back after visiting home last week, but then looked at how illegal it was in the city. So just a heads up, use everything you buy and don't bring them back here.   Most of the highways going into the state have fireworks stores. I know the western boarder has less stores than our southern one, so the Vermont boarder may very well have pop up tents this weekend.

The NH Pyrotechnic Association on the other hand.... http://nhpyro.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=50  On the extreme east of the state, Route 1 in Seabrook is loaded with year-round dealers cutting their balls off to compete for sales to Massholes... ignore them all except Atomic (across from the Home Despot). They might occasionally get beat by a few bucks on a few things, but are on the whole the best deal in the state. The owner, Steve, has been a big help in keeping the politicians at bay with regard to Fireworks regulation. They just built a new facility a year or so ago to accommodate growth."

Any opinions on the place if you have one would be welcomed. It's the closest Google can give me to where we'll be.  In Missouri tents pop up all over rural highways selling them this time of year and was curious if we might come up on something similar before traveling that far into new Hampshire . I wouldn't think a short term fireworks tent business would show up on Google maps and just curious if it was a possibility.  Thanks again!

The rest of what you say, I completely identify with.  I used to live right next to a bunch of section 8 housing when I lived in Claremont and all I saw were a bunch of useless, ignorant, white-trash slobs who didn't want to work, sitting on their steps chain-smoking and getting plastered... just staring at me or other neighbors with dumb cow-eyes and gaping jaws like they never saw other people before....  while their litter of undisciplined brats,  which my taxes pay for them to keep popping out like they're coming off a factory assembly-line, fighting and generally acting like little shits out in the yard, trespassing on my property all the time.... always had to keep all my stuff bolted down or locked up in that neighborhood or it would get stolen, often vandalized. I had my windows shot out with BB-guns, flowerboxes stolen, garden plants trampled, etc.  There was a lot of drug activity too.  Never again will I live near that kind of housing.  This is why I bought a place way out in Cornish, with neighbours who actually work and maintain their own homesteads.  The welfare rats (as in the ones who can work and shouldn't be drawing a lot of support) add nothing of value to society and should be deported to work camps where they are forced to learn how to work, with consequences if they don't.  I strongly believe in helping out the less fortunate by giving them a hand up and comprehensive job training, but many of these people don't want a hand up, they just want someone to give them everything and offer nothing in return and they perpetuate that culture by having litter after litter of dumb little brats who will also be on the system for life.  I personally have two diagnosed disorders which should get me a decent amount of assistance but I power through it and don't even try to get help because I know I can work and support myself.

Claremont was a company town, really—the various mills basically ran the town, from the 1830s onward, and Joy was the center of it all in the mid-20th Century. When Joy closed (I think in the 1970s), that's when everything really went downhill.  Claremont didn't want to monkey with a good thing by building a highway through it, and some of the state politicians at the time were from the upper valley, so they used Leb as a backup plan, knowing it could prove fruitful for Leb. That took care of the 'shopping mecca,' but the overall economy was due to Joy.   Source: both of my grandfathers worked for Joy, one as a machinist and the other as an engineer, and both had to find other employment in the 70s. The first as a postal carrier, the second went back to being an electrician. I grew up hearing a lot about this."

Also, there are only a few large employers in Newport, and they tend to go through waves of hiring and lay-offs.    It's sad, and I left as soon as I could.

newhampshire,3brvo4,starista,6,Thu Jul 2 15:33:10 2015 UTC,"A lot of people here are blaming drugs, and that has a lot to do with it, but Claremont has been this way far longer than it's had a meth problem. What it has is a massive chip on its shoulder from being beaten down by its own failed system.   I was born and raised in Claremont, growing up largely in the 80s. I was a quiet, shy kid, skinny and bookish, but in other towns I'd otherwise be considered pretty normal. In Claremont, a lot of people would ask my parents, in my earshot, ""what's wrong with him?"" I have memories of things like looking out into a yard with a bunch of terrifying asshole kids beating the crap out of each other with sticks, and having some adult say, ""Why don't you go out and play with the other kids? What's wrong with you?"" Starting in about third grade, I was called a faggot as a matter of course. My first time riding a schoolbus, the driver pulled the bus over and screamed at me because I couldn't close the bus window. I had trouble with teachers, police, store proprietors, and community members pretty consistently, and yet I almost never misbehaved, but I felt like I was constantly accidentally doing the wrong thing. When I was 10, my dad was 40, and as such many of my classmates thought he was my grandpa. It took years for them to get it. My memories are full of adults speaking loudly and publicly about tampons and beer, sex, drugs, welfare, and never having a scrap of self-awareness about it.   The Claremont I know has always had a major attitude problem, but it's not a focused one. It's just a general problem. You're reading a book? You're a faggot. Got a job? You're lording it over everyone. Comb your hair this morning? Faggot. You're a kid? You must be smashing car windows. Nice collar on your shirt, fag. Why aren't you playing with the other kids, you think you're better than them? Everyone from kids through adults, shopkeepers, police, etc., embraces this culture that celebrates ignorance, promotes self-loathing, and punishes anything it decides is abnormal or deviant behavior because everyone is afraid that everyone else thinks they're ""better."" It's the kind of town where you hear people confront each other for ""disrespecting"" them. People will scream at each other on the streets or get in fights in your front yard. I grew up thinking that getting in fights was a pretty regular thing that everyone did but me, and that I was ""weird"" for trying to avoid them.  In fact, I was pretty socially aware as a kid, and I basically grew up thinking I was a weirdo. I wasn't worldly enough to realize that it was the town and all the people in it that was messed up. I referred to myself as ""the weird kid,"" which broke my mother's heart, and for a short while I barely thought it was worth it to go on living. I knew I was heterosexual, and I never understood why most children (and some adults) called me gay, faggot, queer, and homo almost daily. I grew up assuming people were right when they said something was ""wrong"" with me, because I was reading a book, drawing a picture, or generally not fighting or avoiding assholes. For a long time, I struggled to figure out just what WAS ""wrong"" with me.  I left, I went to college and grad school, and I moved out of state. I don't hate the place, but it's not my favorite. I do return from time to time, and it's fine. But sometimes I see people screaming in the street, or complaining when something nice happens to them, and I think, ""Yep, that's the Claremont I know."""

newhampshire,3brn06,ChopperIndacar,7,Wed Jul 1 21:34:13 2015 UTC,"Also:    A frequently employed tactic by cops to catch people under this law is to sit behind a group of cars at night and watch for the interior of their car to light up.  Use the absolute lowest brightness setting possible, use dark skins or appearance themes, and do not turn on your phone if you are not already sure the vehicles directly behind you are NOT cops.  Police vehicles have spotlights above the driver's side door.  This may sound ridiculously obvious, but seems to be lost on many motorists.  Do not pass such a vehicle while on the phone....or while speeding!  AFAIK, NH does not have any police vehicles without spotlights or any true ""unmarked"" cruisers.    If stopped for using your phone, the cop will ASK you if you were making a call.  Do not lie to him.  Just refrain from answering him politely.  He can now NOT put in his police report that you admitted to the charge and your ability to fight the ticket just went up substantially.  The cop now has to prove behind a reasonable doubt that having your hand near your head meant you were on the phone.  Do you know how close a cop has to be to SEE a phone in your hand?  Probably closer than he actually was.  Even a cheap-ass lawyer will get this ticket thrown out or deferred.  It is highly unlikely that the Dept. of Safety will go through a subpoena process with your phone company for a few hundred dollar ticket.  Finally, if you get pulled over by a marked cruiser for using your phone (something he must be quite close to see in a way that he can defend in court), you DESERVE it.  Learn to pay better attention to your surroundings.  THAT is how you avoid being a dangerous driver."
newhampshire,3brn06,g3wd,6,Wed Jul 1 21:08:32 2015 UTC,"Good tips.     Do not lie to him. Just refrain from answering him politely.    I was pleasantly surprised at how well this was received by a Mass state trooper when I was seen speeding.  Just went with ""I'd rather not say."""

newhampshire,3brn06,vmont,2,Wed Jul 1 22:08:24 2015 UTC,"I have spent some time reading actual studies on driving behavior with respect to cell phones and other devices. One thing I recall reading is that when people engage with their devices while stopped at an intersection they are far less likely to scan their surroundings before moving again.   I know, I know.. live free or die. We all have the right to do whatever we want, blah blah blah. But your right to live free and die ends when it conflicts with my right to live. I actually spend more time as a pedestrian than I do behind the wheel and driver inattention at intersections is a significant threat to my life."
newhampshire,3brn06,PigBoyOhBoy,2,Thu Jul 2 13:46:00 2015 UTC,"Then they should criminalize ""not scanning your surroundings"", it would only be as pointless to enforce in non-collision scenarios as the law that just went into effect.  Better yet would be to penalize people for negligence when they actually commit a negligent act, like mowing down a pedestrian.  Oh wait, that's already been a thing since always."
newhampshire,3brn06,ChopperIndacar,0,Thu Jul 2 13:56:41 2015 UTC,"The issue is punishment vs. prevention. The thought goes through my mind every time I walk through an intersection. Should I wave to that driver who is going through the walk signal, poised to mow me down? Or should I let him hit me so he will be punished appropriately? Hmmm..."
newhampshire,3brn06,PigBoyOhBoy,2,Thu Jul 2 14:09:36 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, if you take a super naive view on how well this law can be enforced.   On top of that, texting was already banned.  Now they are banning handed phone calls.  That's just gonna incentivize texting, since you will pretty much never get caught texting with your phone down low while cruising down the road.  If anything it was probably safer when people could just quickly make a call without worrying about a ticket."

Where can we relax? Echo lake looks pretty nice. Also are there any waterfalls around there?
newhampshire,3bpaw0,g3wd,3,Wed Jul 1 02:18:59 2015 UTC,"Diana's Baths is an awesome series of waterfalls.  Like any waterfall, its not really deserted enough to sit in the middle of it and drink without someone noticing.  However....no reason you can't sit nearby and knock back a few....lots of gorgeous places around there.  As the other guy said....you can do whatever you want as long as you don't give people a reason to ask questions."
newhampshire,3bpaw0,wod_killa,4,Wed Jul 1 04:08:06 2015 UTC,"Shit man, Franconia Notch and the surrounding area is the most beautiful place in New England. Arethusa Falls is off route 302, easy hike, goddamn gorgeous. It's a quick drive from Echo Lake (where you can park, there is probably a small fee)  Right across the street from echo is Artist Bluff which has beautiful views of the notch. Or, you can take the Tram up Cannon for about 12 bucks (one exit down from echo goin south). Friends of mine own the Dutch Treat restaurant in Franconia, MOJO's coffee and pizza shop, and the village store right in town. There you can get whatever you need. If you want to go shopping, go to Littleton. It's 7 miles north from Franconia on 93. Fireworks will be at Mt. Washington hotel on Saturday night Round dark. Don't fucking miss it (makes Boston look like kids fireworks, no joke) this is also off rt 302 past Bretton Woods resort. Good luck man!"
newhampshire,3bpaw0,representativefisher,3,Wed Jul 1 03:15:19 2015 UTC,"The state liquor laws are pretty outrageous, so it's not a bad question to ask. I have heard of many people being harassed by police officers regarding drinking in public parks- there are many where there are fines involved (such as hampton beach). That said, Franconia is pretty low key and I don't think you'll run into much trouble."

Leftists like Warren and Sanders fail to realize that centralized government power is how corporations get above the law.  You can't just go after corporations to solve the problem of corporate/government incest....you need to limit government power as well.  Otherwise you just end up with the classic totalitarian state...which is no better than an oligarchy."

The outside is pretty warn down, and there's still a lot of work to do- so it's not exactly pretty yet... but the interior rooms are remodeled and look very nice. I stayed there just this past weekend, and for the price, it wasn't a bad stay.   The indoor pool/hot tub and nice room made it worth while.   If you don't mind the fact that they're still in fixing up stages and it's not quite done, but you want to support some really nice people who are working hard to bring a hotel back to life, you should give them a call. Negotiate the rate and mention you heard via word of mouth that they're remodelling and you wanted to support them, I think you can probably get a good rate (under a hundred for sure).  Talk to the front desk manager- Aileen, she'll be most accommodating. Tell them Robert Fisher sent you! I have no affiliation with the hotel, and just myself discovered it this past month. But I got to know the staff while I stayed there and they were really friendly."

newhampshire,3bjd1l,bionicragdoll,3,Mon Jun 29 18:26:34 2015 UTC,"Nh electric coop serves Raymond I think.  My electric bill in NH has always split supply and delivery and they're usually  around the same. You can also change electric suppliers but as long as eversource has their lines connected to your house, you're going to receive a bill from them for at least the delivery portion of the bill."
newhampshire,3bjd1l,sndtech,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:38:53 2015 UTC,That's weird. This is the first bill it's shown up on in the 7 months I've had them as my provider. I had Unitil in another area and they didn't charge for delivery. This is the first time ever that I'm seeing it and it seems ridiculous to be charging that much for it. Yeah I know infrastructure and all that but as much as the electricity itself seems excessive.
newhampshire,3bjd1l,corey1031d,3,Mon Jun 29 19:43:46 2015 UTC,"OP, delivery and supplier has ALWAYS been on your bill. You're wrong if you think otherwise. Eversource maintains the lines that get the power to your house, and they also generate the electricity.   You can get a different supplier, but you still still be getting a bill from Eversource for the delivery portion of your bill."
newhampshire,3bjd1l,corey1031d,0,Tue Jun 30 15:38:04 2015 UTC,I'm not saying your wrong since everyone on here is saying delivery is a normal charge but I've never seen it on my bill. My bill has always been about $60 for the past 7 months. Now because of the $46 delivery charge it's close to double that. I always look over my bills carefully so I know what I'm paying for and it's not something I've ever seen on past bills.
newhampshire,3bjd1l,Ardiea,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:04:48 2015 UTC,Your bill is based on what you use for electricity. That is how you are billed each month.

newhampshire,3bjd1l,Pault66,2,Tue Jun 30 16:31:08 2015 UTC,My bill has always been roughly split in half. Half for the electricity itself and half for the delivery. I'm surprised you're just seeing the delivery charge now. Generally you can't do anything with the delivery portion but you can shop around for the supplier. Most of them aren't any better to be worth the hassle. You will save a couple bucks a month but after their introductory price expires the prices tend to vary wildly month to month.

It's just got more than it's share of junkies and shiftless deadbeats but really is getting better with all the economic growth on the seacoast. You'd probably prefer to live a town or two over (more rural) such as Milton or Farmington. If you're dependent on frivolous stimulation the more urban Dover and Portsmouth are about 20 minutes down the pike and counter-flow to traffic (unless you work odd shifts of course).   Frisbee is just an average small town hospital. Lots of geriatrics, lots of junkies, lot's of maternity... anything serious gets a flight to Boston or a bus to one of the few better hospitals in the state. It's not a total shit show or anything, and IIRC has an excellent reputation for maternity. I wouldn't see any reason to avoid it unless you're holding out for name recognition for your resume or prefer an urban lifestyle.  I can't compare anything to NY as I loathe it, I won't even stop there for gas, so I needn't say more."

newhampshire,3b8xqt,DieCommieScum,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:31:08 2015 UTC,"Frisbie is a fine hospital with a good reputation. It might be the closest  Hospital  to the White Mountains.  A few minutes south in Dover is the larger Wentworth Douglas Hospital. While Rochester is an OK small town to live in, with its tiny main street and a couple of restaurants,I find it too monotone for my tastes, I would think you might prefer Dover more, as it has a decent student population and a bit more culture.  With U.N.H one town over in Durham there are people from other states wondering around the area which is neat. That being said, Portsmouth is most peoples favorite town on the seacoast. Great places to eat, wonderful little shops, on the water. Touristy in a good way, It's been getting more gentrified and expensive in last few years but it is a wonderful town.  In terms of housing, you might want to start by renting a room in Barrington or Dover until you get a feel for the area.   I'm sure you'll enjoy the seacoast."

newhampshire,3b8xqt,slyfox4,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:16:18 2015 UTC,"Frisbie is a good hospital for its location. Rochester is a little rough around the edges but it has the benefit of being cheap while still being close to the sea coast. You're actually 20-30 minutes south of the White Mountains and almost on the border with Maine. Depending on your profession, Frisbie is a decent place to work. As far as patient demographic, you'll see a lot of drug use (16 is the heroin highway) and complaints generally associated with poor demographic. People who don't have a PCP, illnesses and injuries that fester for a while until they're critical, people who can't keep up with medications, etc. Frisbie is also the default prenatal/OB for much of the white mountains southern region ever since Huggins closed their L&D. Next closest OB is over an hour north in North Conway. May I ask what position you're looking at?"

What will they say now?  Yes, the group of people Sanders caters to are the same people who rarely or ever vote, but damn why can't that change? We just accept Hilary even though anyone with a brain stem knows she only cares about the financial elite and historically will lie through her teeth for votes? You might not agree with Sanders 100%, but at least he is consistent. Why can't a person like myself who never voted before, finally feel like there is a reason to, without being shamed.   Also can we stop downvoting people simply because we disagree with them? So ChopperIndacar thinks Sanders will be bad for the economy.

You can, however, use the boat landing right beside the beach area (right side of the fence facing the lake) because it's paid for with state tax dollars and they can't legally kick you out unless you are misbehaving.  I highly recommend swimming or boating out to the largest island which is also state property and you can't be kicked off it unless you are breaking rules.  Much of the undeveloped shoreline on on the far side of the lake is also state property from what I understand. The island has some awesome diving and picnic spots, big boulders for sunbathing, diving off from, etc.  No fires or overnight camping allowed.  If there hasn't been any rain for at least 5 days, the water is usually crystal clear too, also great fishing and snorkeling.  I've been going there since my preteen years.

newhampshire,3az3y2,NicCageKillerBees,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:28:21 2015 UTC,"The problem would still exist. There is no incentive to lay the fiber for the infrastructure division. Also, the monopoly problem today is caused by regulation as towns decide on the one or two providers that are granted special privileges to operate within their borders.   Alas, you are going to get your way. Since the FCC enacted the new ""net neutrality"" regulations (that no one is allowed to see) Internet access now falls under chapter 2 (like phone service) instead of 7 (like private radio communication) so they will regulate it like a utility. This is also the same reason why they are now saying they can ""ban"" certain communication on the internet.  Note: my FCC chapter numbers may be off but the concept is correct."
newhampshire,3az3y2,marcucci,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:59:15 2015 UTC,"When referring to ""regulating the internet like a utility"" I only was referring to allowing any company to broadcast over any wire. I meant for this to supersede any cases in which towns granted monopoly powers to companies as part of an agreement, so it would solve for that. Any company transmitting over any wire is not part of the new FCC regulations. While this idea should bring down cost through increased competition, you're right in saying that this wouldn't incentivize more wires or better infrastructure.     These are the regulations that were just put out, so they're not very secret. I thought this article does a pretty good job of explaining them in brief as well.

Governments derive power from a constitutional mandate and, ostensibly, the will of the people (although this is currently heavily influenced by those with the most money).

If it weren't for the government, ISP competition would drive Comcast and Time Warner out of business.  They only do so well today because the government grants them and protects their local monopolies.  This ensures there is little to no competition.

Because you're ""tough on crime"".   One wrongful conviction is FAR worse than one guilty person going free.  Our protections in the justice system are pretty sparse to begin with, try not to fall victim to the same fear mongering bullshit that people fall for with the turrists.

newhampshire,3arr9g,Ogre213,3,Tue Jun 23 03:21:02 2015 UTC,And get unstuck from way more places.  And not have to dig your vehicle out in the morning (just brush it off).
newhampshire,3arr9g,ChopperIndacar,3,Tue Jun 23 14:14:20 2015 UTC,"Winter tires are a great idea.  If both of your vehicles are 2wd, it may make sense to get one that's AWD like a Subaru or 4wd like a Toyota 4Runner.  You'd still want good tires on it, Because then you at least have one vehicle capable of getting through an unplowed dirt road in an emergency, then again, your neighbors will probably all have a 4wd, so just get friendly with them.  If you ultimately decide to get an AWD/4wd before you move, and if you are looking at used vehicles, you may want to buy one before you come up so you can get something that hasn't seen New England salt.  And when we get the first snow storm, go out to a parking lot and play around, get a good feel for your cars on snow and ice if you haven't driven in it before, keep those front tires pointed the direction you want to go."

Is the road private or public?  If it's plowed during the winter, you'll be fine, and probably better off than if you lived on a paved road IMO - as long as it's plowed."
newhampshire,3arr9g,ChopperIndacar,2,Wed Jun 24 14:42:10 2015 UTC,"Snow tires are more important than anything else.  That being said, it might be worth investing in a vehicle that you can plow with depending on how big your driveway is, and if you can/want to pay someone else to do it for you.  And unless you're doing extreme offroading or pulling really heavy trailers, AWD will be superior to 4WD.  But seriously, get some studded snow tires.  Don't count on seeing that dirt for most of the winter.  It could be just packed snow for five months."
newhampshire,3arr9g,darthjoe229,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:44:23 2015 UTC,"Weird, I've never seen an AWD plow truck.  ;)"
newhampshire,3arr9g,ChopperIndacar,2,Tue Jun 23 14:11:29 2015 UTC,"Well, 4WD is better for plowing too.  Typically AWD cars don't come with a low-range feature, which is what's really key for plowing.  It puts waaaay more torque to the wheels, which is important when pulling (or pushing) heavy loads.  I wasn't thinking of connecting ""plow vehicle"" and ""AWD"" in my head, but I can see how my comment reads that way!  If you're just putting around town, AWD gives you true ""four wheel drive"" by providing power to every wheel consistently, meaning you'll have a much harder time losing traction or getting stuck on a patch of ice.    Unless you have a limited-slip or locking differential, your 4WD car is really only 2WD, and your 2WD car is really only 1WD."
newhampshire,3arr9g,iamthepandaman,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:15:29 2015 UTC,"All good points.  Although there are some notable exceptions - Jeep has introduced ""brake lock differential"" systems (standard feature on the Wrangler), where you have an open diff but the brakes are electronically applied to the slipping wheel to get the other one moving.  Pretty neat."

Winter tires on anything will perform better than an AWD or 4WD with all seasons, but for best results put the power to all 4 and have the right rubber on!"
newhampshire,3arr9g,skunkbollocks,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:42:24 2015 UTC,"I moved here from the charlotte area the end of last Dec.  I have a FWD mid-size suv with a great pair of all season tires and the only issue I ever had was  getting in my own driveway one time at my apartment after a rather big dumping of snow.   I put a few thousand miles on my vehicle by the end of winter due to the being new and driving all over the place to get a feel of the state. Never had any issues on the highways.    Even though I had no issues, and I love the gas mileage my fwd gets, at the end of the day I still wish I had an awd vehicle  and will probably trade mine in soon if the price is right.  There were a lot if places up north I wanted to travel to dead of winter and woukd have  felt more comfortable  in a awd.  Still though,  this state does great keeping the roads in good shape to drive.   Best of luck and I hope you enjoy nh as much as I have. I love it here and can't imagine living anywhere else."
newhampshire,3arr9g,portsmoth,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:32:12 2015 UTC,"As others have said, snow tires will make all the difference.  That being said, your own ability to drive in the snow will be the determining factor of your success and if you haven't before, you're going to suck at it.  I suggest finding an open lot near you during the first storm and practicing.  It may seem stupid, but being able to anticipate how your vehicle will respond in inclement conditions will be what makes or breaks you when it happens.  source: stuffed my share of cars in snow banks"

newhampshire,3arr9g,teefour,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:34:54 2015 UTC,"I love the first snow storm in NH.  By distribution, some roughly 4% of the drivers on the road each year are experiencing their first blizzard behind the wheel.  I envy these young people, in conflict between the immortality they know they have and the coefficient of sliding friction between their car and the road.  These people are easily identified by the cool mods they do to their cars - the most common is that they keep their wheels on the top half of the car, and the roof closer to the road.  Others prefer to assist random neighbors plow their driveways/mailboxes using a sort of panicked, diagonal maneuver.  I watched a young woman perform a 360 degree spinout while she took a cellular phone call just this last year - her call never dropped and it was painfully clear how rude the ice was in hindsight.    Keep a few bags of cat litter in your trunk with a cheap shovel on these perilous journeys.  The added weight is only a side benefit - many cars have a single driving wheel and three passive wheels.  I spent a few hours stuck in an icy parking spot, flat, with no snow, due to such an unfortunately arrangement.  Remember that an old cell phone with no service plan still has to connect you to 911.  Perfect for a glove box.  A bone saw is a convenient tool to keep in the trunk, as well as a tarp, fresh eyepatches, superglue, rope, tang mix, and slingshot.  Most NHers won't readily admit to this, but pretty much everyone has spent an overnight on the side of a rural highway, with nothing but fresh squirrel meat and snowcones to sustain them.  Oh!  Also add a few packs of playing cards.  There's a really good chance someone is crashed on the other side of a highway median and could go for a few rounds of rummy.  The only other advice I have is that in a pinch, you can pull the chain out of your chainsaw and rev the alternator to recharge a dead car battery.  With that, I think you're ready for your first New Hampshire winter.  Good luck!"

newhampshire,3arr9g,ChopperIndacar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:45:32 2015 UTC,"I take it the ford escape is a FWD? Definitely trade one car in to get some sort of AWD/4WD vehicle, especially if you're not used to driving in snow. It won't stop you from slipping sideways, but it will make it so you don't get stuck on any hills or deeper drifts. And since you're down a half mile dirt road, absolutely get a truck. I've driven snowy dirt roads before in a hatchback, and it's not fun. If you're having to do that every day, you'll be thankful for the larger tires, increased clearance height, and real 4WD. Especially if your second car gets stuck and you have to pull/push it out of its predicament."

Improving the downtown strip and having a few businesses move into the area does not really mean an area is turning around. Their crime rates and poverty rates are lower than the national averages, but they are still the highest in the area by a very large degree."

They're both developing the seeds of the change that hit Dover in the late 90s and Portsmouth in the 80s.

newhampshire,3acdgq,fly_rover,3,Sat Jun 27 13:50:55 2015 UTC,"Really everywhere around portsmouth is nice. Rye is going to be even more expensive but Greenland and Newington are nice and a decent amount cheaper. More space out there too. Kittery is right across the bridge and may be a little cheaper but it's in Maine so the taxes are going to be different.   I haven't lived in portsmouth for a while now so sorry I can't be more specific. You can find some less expensive places to live in portsmouth itself but for what you're paying, it's not going to be much."
newhampshire,3acdgq,doodledoo1,3,Fri Jun 19 00:43:31 2015 UTC,"I feel like people on the sub have extremely high standards. Newmarket is really nice and has a small town community feel. I lived there for years until I moved to Dover. If you live near Main Street you'll quickly get to know (or at the very least recognize) your neighbors. There are lot of shit hole apartments that are filled with college students, but there are also a lot of affordable homes and nicer apartments. The mills are really, really nice. Lots of outdoorsy stuff to do but not much in terms of a night life though. All the bars suck (with the exception of the Polish Club). Cracksulls is an awesome coffee shop + bookstore. It's a nice place to sit and read.  Dover is very affordable and has more to do than Newmarket. You pretty much completely lose the small town/community thing though. There are a few good bars and coffee shops. You just need to be more discerning when it comes to the street you live on. The whole town is safe but some streets are a lot louder than others. All the streets off Silver Street are nice and fairly quiet (maybe not Belknap..) and have affordable housing. The traffic is terrible though. If you're coming back to Dover from Portsmouth on the bridge anytime after 3:45pm you're going to have to deal with annoying construction and stop and go traffic. Often you're better off going through Maine to get back to Dover.  I've rented apartments in both and I would say you're looking at $750/month minimum for a one bedroom."

If you want something more rural, going up into the Farmington/Barrington area gets rural fast.    Most of the seacoast is going to be quite expensive, except for the inner Hampton/Seabrook area....but there's a reason for that.  Cost-wise, going in the northwest direction up the Rt. 16/Rt. 9 area is going to be your best bet because you are getting away from areas that are commutable to Boston.  Those are the expensive parts of NH....where you can get to Boston in about an hour.  Anything within that range that's cheap is going to be cheap for a reason.    That being said, I live in Portsmouth (near Newington) and its pretty nice.  Not too bad for cost."

Or store owners during LA riots. It's completely arbitrary, what's the magic number? 7? 10? 30? Asshat.    Mandatory waiting periods give law officials time to complete background checks and also provide ""cooling off"" periods in the scenario where someone may get into a conflict with another person, then walk into a gun store later that day. Three days later when they receive the gun they may not be so inclined to shoot.   NICS checks are instant. Most gun purchases are made by people already owning a gun, so the cooling off period is bunk. Waiting periods worked well though for the crazed ex-boyfriend of the NJ woman that was killed recently during her waiting period. Her blood is on the hands of assholes like you.

I'll snap off a few of the more digestible ones in the interest of time since I'm wagering you'll need a full economics and history lesson to understand these things.   Voted YES on increasing AMTRAK funding by adding $214M to $900M.  Corporate Welfare Voted NO on prohibiting eminent domain for use as parks or grazing land. (Dec 2007)  Power transfer to Ag and Real Estate developers Voted YES on $2 billion more for Cash for Clunkers program. (Aug 2009)  Corporate Welfare to Automakers Voted NO on authorizing construction of new oil refineries. (Oct 2005) Protecting margins for big oil  Voted YES on $84 million in grants for Black and Hispanic colleges. (Mar 2006) Corporate Welfare for the Education Lobby Voted YES on additional $10.2B for federal education & HHS projects. Corporate Welfare to Government Contractors Voted NO on barring EPA from regulating greenhouse gases. (Apr 2011)  Protecting Margins for Indistrial Lobby Voted NO on protecting middle-income taxpayers from a national energy tax. Economic Warfare on the proletariat Voted NO on reducing Marriage Tax by $399B over 10 years. Economic Warfare on the proletariat Voted YES on Congressional pay raise. Does this really need explaining?
newhampshire,3a7pxw,DieCommieScum,2,Thu Jun 18 10:17:27 2015 UTC,"This is insane... I'm honestly not sure if you're trolling; if you are you're doing a great job. Assuming you're not:   Voted YES on increasing AMTRAK funding by adding $214M to $900M. Corporate Welfare   From Wikipedia: The National Railroad Passenger Corporation, doing business as Amtrak, is a publicly funded railroad service operated and managed as a for-profit corporation[1] which began operations on May 1, 1971, to provide intercity passenger train service in the United States.   Amtrak is basically the only large scale passenger train transportation in the US. It's not a particularly profitable model, it requires public funding.   Voted NO on prohibiting eminent domain for use as parks or grazing land. (Dec 2007) Power transfer to Ag and Real Estate developers   Eminent domain allows the government to seize land. It doesnt allow corporations to seize land. I don't necessarily agree with it, but I also don't know anything else about this particular bill and it's pretty clear you're grasping at straws.   Voted YES on $2 billion more for Cash for Clunkers program. (Aug 2009) Corporate Welfare to Automakers   Cash for Clunkers provided incentives for Americans to turn in their environmentally unfriendly cars and get newer cars with better environmental ratings. That money didn't go to companies, it went to people. ""BUT IT MADE PEOPLE GIVE THEIR MONEY TO COMPANIES!!!"" you shout in response. No, it provided an incentive. No money was handed to any company. That's not corporate welfare, you're just stringing words together.   Voted NO on authorizing construction of new oil refineries. (Oct 2005)   Protecting margins for big oil?? Who the fuck do you think would be putting in the new oil refineries? This PREVENTED big oil from constructing new refineries.  This is the sort of shit that makes it really hard for me to believe you aren't just trolling.   Voted YES on $84 million in grants for Black and Hispanic colleges. (Mar 2006)   I have no idea what these grants were actually for. Were they for the students? There honestly isn't enough information here to have any clue what it was about. Certainly not enough to, yet again, scream corporate welfare.   Voted YES on additional $10.2B for federal education & HHS projects.   Corporate welfare to government contractors?! Who exactly do you expect the government to use to get anything done?! This is money provided for EDUCATION and HEALTH RESEARCH PURPOSES. You are a fucking lunatic.   Voted NO on barring EPA from regulating greenhouse gases. (Apr 2011)   What the fuck do you mean protecting margins for industrial lobby? Do you understand English?? The bill, if passed, would bar the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases. The Environmental Protection Agency exists to protect the environment. Regulating greenhouse gases is an important thing for them to be able to do. He voted NO to barring the EPA from doing what it was formed to do.   Voted NO on protecting middle-income taxpayers from a national energy tax.   Come on. Economic warfare on the proletariat? Could you be more stupidly dramatic? Once again, I don't have enough information on this one. The devil is in the details, and while I feel like middle-income taxpayers shouldnt have to pay more taxes, ""protecting middle income taxpayers from a national energy tax"" sounds like there was a tax put on sales of some form of energy and he voted for the version where it applies to everyone. Probably pretty fair, an energy tax is the type that would scale with usage rather than income.  Seriously though, economic warfare on the proletariat? You're a loon, brother.   Voted NO on reducing Marriage Tax by $399B over 10 years. Economic Warfare on the proletariat   I don't know anything about this one, just wanted to point out that you said Economic Warfare on the proletariat again, and you're a loon.   Voted YES on Congressional pay raise.   Honestly couldn't care less. I would vote to raise my own pay too, in the grand scheme of things that's pretty unimportant compared to actual policy issues.  So, to recap: You're a loon and/or must be a troll. I'm embarrassed to have spent this much time responding to you. May god have mercy on us both."

Very wealthy people have a lot of power to control social outcomes for this society.  Other people don't want them to have that power.  Luckily, we have a system that allows for a redistribution of power without dragging people in the streets and shooting them.   Sanders' platform reflects this perspective.

If you look at the guy's issue platform (https://berniesanders.com/issues/), it's very straightforward and doesn't include silly 'college kid' comparisons.    It's perfectly valid to disagree with the guy, but being hyperbolically reductionist with ""live free on other people's money"" is just as silly as the kindergarten to hedge fund comparison.  If you genuinely are vehemently opposed to him, I would suggest having a few concise reasoned points to make to educate people.

Sanders advocates a tax on hedge funds to pay for universal college tuition. He has plenty of other ideas, all of which involve taking money from someone and giving it to another.

newhampshire,3a2dwb,ChopperIndacar,-1,Wed Jun 17 13:31:24 2015 UTC,"Please explain.  You live socialism every single day of your life here in NH.  Our roads? Socialism.  Our schools? Socialism.  Our police/fire protection and other emergency services? Socialism.  Our telecommunications infrastructure? Socialism.  Clean water? Socialism.  National parks? Socialism.  Sorry, but I'm going to need a better explanation about this 'thoroughly debunked' political philosophy you speak of."
newhampshire,3a2dwb,Sqwirl,2,Wed Jun 17 13:41:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe they're thinking of some kind of small-town capitalism like from old westerns, when people used to trade gold powder for hillbilly moonshine?

newhampshire,3a2dwb,ATG77,0,Wed Jun 17 14:14:32 2015 UTC,"If police, roads, and public schools are your justification for socialism then your argument is fucked. They are complete shit relative to their market alternatives. Clean water and telecom are rarely socialized, most of the state gets theirs from a hole in the fucking ground. Private land trusts already augment, and could easily replace, national parks.   Just because something is socialized, doesn't mean it would cease to exist if it wasn't. If you like socialism so much, I hope you're prepared to give up all your luxuries for subsistence living (assuming you don't starve to death).  Socialism can't solve for the economic calculation problem, and is therefore defunct as an idea pragmatically, in addition to being completely morally bankrupt."

In fact, those all rely on the private sector at current.   Next time you need an ambulance, turn away the private ones and see how long you are waiting there as most are private. There's also already over 2 million full time private security workers picking up the slack for the corrupt, murderous, unaccountable, and over-priced gestapo that you call police."
newhampshire,3a2dwb,DieCommieScum,8,Thu Jun 18 14:39:18 2015 UTC,Why do you find it terrifying that people like Bernie Sanders?
newhampshire,3a2dwb,beaherobeaman,-7,Thu Jun 18 14:51:37 2015 UTC,Because he openly and unapologetically supports theft through violence.
newhampshire,3a2dwb,DieCommieScum,7,Thu Jun 18 15:01:18 2015 UTC,"Come on dude. This cliche hyperbole is getting tired. Taxation is not simply theft and enforcement of tax responsibilities is not simply violence. I and those around me are much more ""victims"" of capitalism than the rules and enforcement of the republic.

You'll observe all of the NH license plates flying in to MA, speeding and generally driving like assholes, congesting our highways, all so they can earn money from our companies to take back to their state.  NH needs Massachusetts. You need our jobs, our money, our disposable incomes to support your shitty touristy spots like Hampton Beach and LW. 90% of your state's economy is based on tourism (read: Massachusetts people supporting your small businesses). We are the lifeblood of your state. You wouldn't be shit without us. You'd all be sitting around, smoking your cheap cigarettes, drinking your shitty beer, and crying about the Old Man on the Mountain being gone.   And yeah, your beer is shitty. I'll give you stoneface, but Massachusetts beer kicks your beer's ass. Trillium, Tree House, Jack's Abby, Wormtown, Night Shift, and mother fucking Sam Adams. You've got Stoneface and what, Woodstock? Look around you. Vermont has three of the best breweries in the world, and Maine is killing it with Bissell, Allagash, Oxbow, etc. New Hampshire is the anus of the northern New England brewing scene, and you have the audacity to claim that they ""love their beer."" Fuck right off until you get your shit together. People drive through your state to get to Vermont and Maine for their superior beer offerings. Your beer sucks, and your food is shit too.

newhampshire,39p1fx,GWizzle,11,Sat Jun 13 13:43:02 2015 UTC,"I'll explain why it's not ironic.    The demonstration is meant to defy the command that these murderers have given us, to not draw muhammad.  He wants to piss them off, but only them.  Drawing all the other deities pooping on muhammad's chest, for example, would offend other people who aren't murdering anyone.    Also, it's his event.  He's not controlling what other people do on their own, and he's not murdering anyone.  Not ironic."
newhampshire,39p1fx,SicSemperTyrannis_,5,Sat Jun 13 15:35:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly, the point is also to not be crass about it. Drawing Mohammad sucking a dick doesn't get your point across as well as just drawing a portrait. The idea is to show how ridiculous it is that this offends Muslims so much and how ridiculous it is that they're willing to be violently aggressive over it."
newhampshire,39p1fx,FascistAsparagus,-7,Sat Jun 13 17:48:35 2015 UTC,"There seems to be some confusion. Understandably, Muslims are offended by depictions of Muhammad sucking a dick. Not unlike getting offended by cartoons of your daughter, wife, son, husband sucking a dick. I understand that, therefore I don't draw cartoons of people sucking dicks. I don't find that ridiculous at all.  There are very few Muslims who would kill him for that. Some, but to say that Muslims are willing to be violently aggressive about it is a lie.  Just because you can be offensive in a particular situation doesn't mean that you must be offensive. And if you are, then expect  the offended party to engage in some sort of dialog with you."
newhampshire,39p1fx,FascistAsparagus,7,Sat Jun 13 19:58:08 2015 UTC,"It's wishful thinking to conclude that there are very few Muslims who would commit/be supportive of violence. From polls across Muslim nations, violence in support of Islam finds plenty of sympathy from a large part of the population."
newhampshire,39p1fx,xPersistentx,3,Sat Jun 13 20:32:35 2015 UTC,"Tens of thousands of Muslims march and protest in support of the terrorists who slaughtered innocent cartoonists.  If tens of thousands physically marched in support, how many millions silently agreed from their homes?"
newhampshire,39p1fx,boondoggie42,-3,Sun Jun 14 15:27:30 2015 UTC,"I understand that the article states that thousands of protesters demonstrated in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Indian Kashmir. The article says they were demonstrating against the cartoon portrayal of the Prophet Mohammed. The article never disclose where those numbers came from, nor did it say that the protesters supported the killings.  I also see that the 2010 global estimated population of Muslims is around 1.57 billion people. The ratio is exceedingly small, so I can remain confident in my view that it isn't the Muslims who are murdering and supporting murderers, but a vanishingly small number of individuals claiming that offensive speech is a rational for murder. So small as to be statistically insignificant.  I also understand that there seems to be considerable effort being made to demonize Muslims in general, and I believe that effort is being made to prepare for a global offensive against Muslim states in order to seize assets and control political dialogue consistent with an offensive operation.  The cartoons are regarded by some as hate speech. This is a good reason to protest. This is not a good reason to condemn the Muslim religion as hateful, nor is it a good reason to continue the rhetoric in the name of freedom.  I think that if it continues many, many, many thousands and millions of innocent people will die. And it won't be because Muslims are offended by cartoons.  I have lost faith in my government to provide me with a factual representation of the issues we face going forward to achieve peace and stability after the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan. I believe that my government is facilitating a global apocalypse brought about by a small group of international shadow players willing to use my brothers and sisters to kill their brothers and sisters so that those pulling the strings are left in absolute power for a very long time.  The demonstration of freedom to disseminate hate speech is just a single tactic in the overall strategy toward achieving those goals."
newhampshire,39p1fx,DieCommieScum,3,Sun Jun 14 16:09:44 2015 UTC,"If anything even remotely like this were ever perpetrated by any religion other than Islam, there would be absolutely zero sympathy for the attackers, period."

It's not his event because he is seeking media coverage.  Now, it's become our event.

newhampshire,39gygn,fukthehabs,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:25:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not an artist but my best friend is.  White Ink - Doesn't show up very well, depending on your skin color, and while it sounds like a good idea it often doesn't end up as the customer wanted.  Hands and Neck/Face - Artists will do these areas, but usually on people who are already heavily tattooed.  The reason being, new tattoos are a fun idea, but having them on your neck and face is a big step for somebody who has no experience with visible tattoos.  As for hands, hand tattoos don't set very well because the skin moves so much and gets so much daily contact.  What ink does stay, won't look good for very long.    Frankly, my buddy doesn't want to deal with customers who regret their decisions.  He will do these areas, but again, only with customers who are already heavily tattooed."

Said new customer could have been in poor standing with their previous utility in another state, or have no previous record of paying their bills. I do understand that the law technically does not say that, but I do not feel that requiring a track record of more than a couple months is unfair. Perhaps maybe the law should be changed to list a minimum customer history for this sort of thing."

newhampshire,396lh7,shazammerbammer,2,Tue Jun 9 18:56:33 2015 UTC,"Mr. Fisher sought to rely upon the ""customer in good standing"" to provide a ""irrevocable written guarantee of a responsible party"" and the person used was not a customer for 12 months, and therefore was rejected, and the commission found that a reasonable basis for rejection.  I'm inclined to agree with the commission and eversource that the ""newbie customer"" was not a ""customer in good standing"" since they were too new to being a customer.  It's like saying you bought a pack of chewing gum from the store, so the cashier should think that is a reliable customer. They want a longer history and the commission doesn't think that is unreasonable.  There's so much ""outrage"" on that post that it is difficult to take seriously. Maybe just pay your bills on time?"
newhampshire,396lh7,shazammerbammer,11,Tue Jun 9 19:18:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah but its a ""public"" utility operating a monopoly that serves a required service for first world living. Requiring roughly an 8 month deposit is insane.  And your analogy is off: Its like ordering chewing gum a bag of rice for your kids and the store demanding you give them $100 to hold for a year and then they'll sell you chewing gum a bag of rice. And also they're the only store you are allowed to go to."
newhampshire,396lh7,lunchbox15,-1,Tue Jun 9 19:31:36 2015 UTC,"I agree an 8-month deposit sounds large but I don't know the facts of the person being required to pay such a deposit, so it might be reasonable. We don't know."
newhampshire,396lh7,ChopperIndacar,5,Tue Jun 9 19:48:47 2015 UTC,"Did you read the article? Basically, they found that you can be not in 'good standing' just because you're a new customer, which for something like a utility is insane. What about someone moving to the area? I'd agree if the the deposit was reasonable - one or two months. Maybe it is in this case - if the guy uses $400 of electricity a month. Maybe he heats with electric."
newhampshire,396lh7,bostonmolasses,6,Tue Jun 9 20:18:15 2015 UTC,"The rule on the books is 2 high use months is the max for a deposit. But the bad news is, yes, that includes people with electric heat. The worst I've heard so far was a $1600 deposit.  The problem is that Eversource is shaking people down for extra cash when people don't have it, threatening disconnections when they can't pay it, and keeping that money for 12 months (or indefinitely). A few of my colleagues in the house have mentioned it sounds like the utility is floating the money to make an extra buck.   I don't think it's necessarily unreasonable to want deposits from high-risk customers. But that's only if the customers actually have these options available to them- which the PUC has demonstrated they do not."
newhampshire,396lh7,bostonmolasses,7,Tue Jun 9 20:23:01 2015 UTC,There is a lot of recent history of utilities fucking with the people. Enron and California come to mind. They need to be handled with stone hammers to the nuts to keep them from shaking people down.  For sure some suit in a fancy office is laughing at the extra 3% they've milked from NH over last year.  And you're right they're absolutely just floating people's deposits.

If you want to get your legs under you without getting winded, Woodpecker is perfect.  It's sort of a momentum track that has minimal hills and if you're gunning it, start to finish in about 7 minutes.  Not sure how to ping, but here is a map that I plopped a star on.  You can park on Depot Rd. in Auburn and the trails all start there.  You can see all the fire roads that surround FOMBA to the right of the parking area.  Have fun!"

""the amount of chips a player may purchase during the course of play in said game...""  So I would say if you buy $150 chips, play game, duck out, you can't buy another $150 and jump back in that same game. Gotta wait for next game. If you bought $140, ducked out, you could buy back another $10 for that game, but no more.  I don't really see the state's interest in regulating the dollar amount for bets and games..."
newhampshire,38qq1o,minuteman_lono,2,Sat Jun 6 17:01:51 2015 UTC,Nothing you said here is contrary to my post. We both agree that each player per game can have up to $150. Thanks.

newhampshire,38qq1o,dj_narwhal,-1,Mon Jun 8 12:47:12 2015 UTC,"However, the way its worded is poor.  You can buy up to $150 per hand of play.  Meaning you can sit down with $150, play a hand, then buy another $150.  Rinse and repeat and you can essentially sit down at a $1/$2 NL game with $1000 if you just wait a few hands.

See Saf-C 1006.07  Re-Examination After Failure.  http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rules/state_agencies/saf-c1000.html  I am skeptical of this website because there is no mention of such a limitation on the DMV general knowledge page either. If the website were correct, I would expect there to be a discussion of a three failure limit for license testing similar to the discussion for three failures on the driver's Ed certification testing in the dmv regulations. But, I can find no such discussion.  http://www.nh.gov/safety/divisions/dmv/driver-licensing/apply/testing.htm"

newhampshire,38oc09,itsMalarky,0,Fri Jun 5 19:44:47 2015 UTC,"Mainly because the texting laws can't be enforced at all without a law like this, because people can just say they weren't texting, they were dialing a number, or getting directions, etc. All of which aren't illegal. So this just covers that.  Either way, I've been using blue tooth for years. Way fucking more convenient and comfortable for talking in the car. And you can get one for $10 or less these days."

newhampshire,38oc09,ChopperIndacar,2,Fri Jun 5 20:04:53 2015 UTC,"The law is mainly aimed at texting, not phone calls.  Texting while driving is a big problem. It takes both your visual and mental attention off the road for an average of four seconds at a time.  A lot can happen in four seconds.  And many people are texting multiple times, not just once and done.  Phone calls take your mental and auditory attention, but not so much of your visual, and for fewer and briefer periods.  It's still distracted driving, but that visual+mental attention is the real killer (alas, sometimes literally).  I was also a bit incredulous at the stop lights/momentary pause restriction.  If I have to adjust my GPS or read a text, that's when I do it.  Especially at very familiar intersections where I know the light timing."

Isn't the distracted driving law enough? Why pass a law that forces everyone to go out and spend money on Bluetooth car accessories .
newhampshire,38oc09,itsMalarky,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:53:19 2015 UTC,"also, your argument is:    Reaching down to answer my phone takes as much attention as picking up my coffee. That's partly subjective to me   And yes, that's subjective but you're not addressing the actual law. The law prohibits you from reaching down, grabbing your phone, and then operating the phone.   Now in the coffee scenario, imagine you reached down, grabbed your coffee, then poured cream into it, then poured some sugar into it, then stirred it....all while driving."
newhampshire,38oc09,Ragnar_Targaryen,2,Fri Jun 5 18:51:07 2015 UTC,"I suppose my issue is more ideological. i've never had a cell-phone related car accident, so the fact that I'm no longer free to talk on the phone while I'm driving irks me.      Apart from singling out phones specifically, how is this more effective than the distracted driving law?  I suppose the sticking part of the law is the fact that they're really more trying to regulate how often people AREN'T looking at the road...which I understand I suppose. It sounds soooooo teaparty of me...I just hate losing these ""freedoms"" and being faced with more laws."
newhampshire,38oc09,itsMalarky,-2,Fri Jun 5 18:59:26 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, it's primarily focused on the phone issue. While many people don't have problems using their phones, some people do, which causes other people's safety to be in jeopardy.   This is how dangerous driving can get. Approximately 1/4 of accidents are soley because of phones."

This.  Unless its an emergency I don't answer my phone while driving as it is.  I just cannot carry a coherent convo and drive at the same time because my focus is on my surroundings while driving (possibly because I took my driving lessons from a cop who promote defensive driving).  So, I just don't answer my phone.  I could see how some morons out there would be the opposite of me.  Focusing more on the convo, what's being said, ect than what's going on around them while driving a hunk of metal at 65mph.  Edit: I'm not in favor of this law btw   But more because from what I understand it means I can't even check my phone at a stop light, which is dumb IMO."
newhampshire,38oc09,dariusdetiger,3,Fri Jun 5 20:07:02 2015 UTC,Is there much of a difference between focusing on a phone conversation than having one with your passenger?   I get the whole picking up and dialing and looking at the screen thing.
newhampshire,38oc09,j_collins,2,Fri Jun 5 20:15:43 2015 UTC,That's a great question really.  Never thought about it.  I can hold conversations fine with passengers (unless the road conditions are shit) but not on the phone.  Maybe there's something more to it?
newhampshire,38oc09,dariusdetiger,2,Sat Jun 6 00:44:06 2015 UTC,"The only thing I can think of is people trying to fiddle with their phone that don't know how to properly do it, like turning up the volume if they can't hear. Or those that aren't used to driving with just 1 hand on the wheel.  I typically drive with one hand on the wheel. It's usually more comfortable. Except when the roads are shitty, or I feel as if I need them. I've got both hands on the wheel during those times, and I won't touch my phone, drink, or even radio."

There is NO WAY you can tell me leaning over and poking screens in the dash is safer than bringing a cell phone up to eye level, and when it's safe, move your thumb up and down. I actually find it more distracting constantly trying to find music I like on FM radio or trying to avoid commercials. This law is a blanket ""We don't know what to do!"" law that is unnecessarily redundant from distracted driving and has collateral damage. iPods can't even connect to cell towers for crying out loud!"

I don't want to use my car Bluetooth and have my whole car listen to my conversation if I have to make a phone call while driving with others. I have no problem using it otherwise. I actually find my Bluetooth is pretty distracting compared to having my phone to my ear. I'm focused on how loud I'm talking and if they can hear me, if my blue tooth will stay connected.

I doubt this article does an adequate job describing the three provisions but this is my understanding of it:  1: So they can look at who is calling who over-seas, as long as there is a suspected link to terrorism. I don't really see in issue here.  2:They can tap with a warrant, but why does the target stay anonymous?  3:This seems like the worst one to me. Roving wiretaps without any warrants or suspicions. The ""nation's spies"" can listen in on any and all conversations.  These provisions are just ripe for exploitation and abuse, especially the third one.

Can you make any more of a generic, negative post about the Patriot Act? The Patriot Act had so much wrong with it but it also had so much right about it. Accept the world we live in today, the government does have to monitor the communications of terrorists.   Let me say that again, the government does have to monitor the communications of terrorist here in America because whether you like it or not, there's terrorists that live among us and they must be stopped.   What the USA FREEDOM Act is stopping is the mass data collection. This means that the NSA can't just collect all the information about the citizens in America, there needs to be a reason; the NSA needs a specific warrant to collect data on a specific person.  For example:   With the Patriot Act: If I was suspected of being a terrorist, the NSA could collect all the information they wanted about me, about my friends, about my family and anyone with connections to me.   With the USAFREEDOM Act: If I was suspected of being a terrorist (like I just came back from Syria where I disappeared for 6 months), the NSA could monitor me, follow me, watch me, etc. However under the new provisions, they can not collect whatever they want with people connected to me. The NSA would need a special warrant to collect information on my mom, sister, cousin, etc.   What's so wrong with monitoring suspected terrorists? The reason there hasn't been a mass attack, like 9/11, since 9/11 is because of ideas like these.   Basically my point is, is that the USA FREEDOM Act is rolling back all the bad things about the Patriot Act and keeping the good things from the Patriot Act. We live in a very dangerous world where everyone is connected and I believe the government is acting in national security interest when it 'data collects' certain individuals."

newhampshire,38el6o,Pickle_boy,2,Wed Jun 3 18:24:18 2015 UTC,"Restaurants in Littleton is something I know.  Tim-Bir Alley is by far the best meal in town.  I'm letting you in on a secret here.  They have no website, they never advertise, and the place is always full.  It is fine dining, which I know you wanted to stay away from, but absolutely world class food, no exaggeration, check yelp, but I do think it'd be a bit awkward sitting at a table by myself for 3 hours, which is what a typical meal lasts there.  Baliwicks is the next best resturant in town.  For a single guy you can sit at the bar and ask to see the dinner menu.  You'll have a very nice meal there.  Schilling Beer Company on Mill St. is great if you are a beer guy.  As far as food, all they really have is pizza, but the pizza is pretty good.  They do not take reservations and there can be a long wait, especially on a hot day in July.  Screaming Boar on West Main St. is pretty good BBQ.  If you're coming from Texas or Kansas City, or some other big BBQ area I'm sure you'll complain about this or that, but for around here, it's good.  Chang Thai on Main St. is, half way decent Thai, it's a bit pricy, but a fairly young crowd, also a small bar.  For Chinese I prefer Mr. Lee's on Union St.  Don't dine in, the fan in the kitchen sounds like a jet engine and wears on the nerves of some people.    If you are staying at the Hampton Inn, stay away from the Applebee's next to the hotel.  Applebee's is meh at best and this one is pretty crappy even by Applebee's standards.  I don't normally reccomend a chain resturant to anyone, but the The 99 is within stumble distance to the Hampton Inn, and if you are not from the north east, you may not have eaten at one before.  It has a pretty lively bar, and the food is pretty good, as far as chain restaurants go.  Last, is The Topic on Main St.  The Topic is not fancy at all, but it's a good, home cooked, breakfast served all day kind of place.  As much as I enjoy a fine dining experience, nine times out of ten when I'm grabbing a quick meal I find myself there.  They run lunch and dinner specials daily and offer a full bar."

People believe this will enable people to abuse heroin more since they can be revived if they OD. The argument couldn't be further from reality. Anyone who has lost someone to opiates would tell you they wish Narcan was introduced sooner.

newhampshire,37l5jn,spitfire8125,4,Thu May 28 14:45:53 2015 UTC,"This isn't fallout from the war on drugs... this is a plague brought on us by ""Big Pharma""."
newhampshire,37l5jn,5arge,8,Thu May 28 16:35:07 2015 UTC,"Both opinions seem to be missing the big picture and it is silly to place the blame on one or two factors when this is a very complex issue. The rise in heroin use may be a result of ""Big Pharma"" as you say but the rise of Fentanyl and other RC (research chemical) synthetic opioids (some which are active at a micro gram level) is more connected to the war on drugs. There really is no reason to cherry pick a cause, this is a multifaceted hydra."
newhampshire,37l5jn,5arge,3,Thu May 28 16:59:37 2015 UTC,"That was my point actually. ""Don't blame one thing"". You are more eloquent though..."
newhampshire,37l5jn,OgieOgletorp,-1,Thu May 28 17:58:46 2015 UTC,What is your point? Heroin and Opium should be legalized?
newhampshire,37l5jn,spitfire8125,7,Thu May 28 19:12:44 2015 UTC,"The point is that, regardless of your personal feelings about this shit, when you make something that is VERY desirable to certain people illegal, a black market happens.  If people can't get pure-quality stuff that'll only kill you in ways you know about, you get shoddy stuff which, in all likelihood, you don't even know whats IN it.  In Prohibition, this meant dangerous bathtub gin and the roots of most modern organized crime in the US.   For our lovely drug war, it means that if people can't get their hands on regular heroin or opiates, someone will make synthetic opioids behind many of N.H's drug-related deaths.  It also means more organized crime and violence as the people who make and distribute the stuff fight a host of government agencies and each other.  Not to mention the explosion in prison population, families torn apart, etc.    So, yeah. My point is that prohibition fucks up way more than the drugs its aimed at.  Your addicts demand just as much heroin as they would have anyway, and instead of nice, pure regulated heroin, they get the equivalent of bathtub gin.  And they fucking die."

newhampshire,37l5jn,GordonFremen,2,Fri May 29 00:32:32 2015 UTC,I imagine a lot of people get addicted to opiates because they were prescribed them for pain relief and couldn't kick the habit. It's not like they all got addicted on purpose.
newhampshire,37l5jn,OgieOgletorp,5,Fri May 29 13:53:47 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you, but I don't blame the government for a person's strength of will power. If someone could provide the statistics  on opiate usage leading to heroin use vs those who use opiates for recreational use I might be swayed. Personal anecdotes are usually disregarded, but I had eye surgery and was prescribed Oxycodone for 30 days...when my supply was done I didn't go out on the street and try to find a bag of heroin."

It's terribly stupid, especially considering that he became drunk enough to somehow alert everyone around him that he was carrying, but I don't find it all that hard to imagine the scenario."
newhampshire,37giob,Netrilix,0,Thu May 28 00:14:57 2015 UTC,I think his friends would come up to NH rather than he heading down to CT. Also I think its more likely that he had a rifle on his back than him brandishing a pistol.

newhampshire,37encm,sylban,6,Wed May 27 04:05:22 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why 11 other people saying ""No it doesn't."" wasn't enough to sway the one juror.  I've never been picked for a jury trial - can you not ask the judge for access to simple research materials?"
newhampshire,37encm,tommysmuffins,6,Wed May 27 08:16:04 2015 UTC,"Generally, no, I would imagine.  Prosecutors, in particular, are extremely intent on leading juries to believe that the law is black and white and they may only use information presented in the trial (which they've helped filter) to reach a verdict.  If a juror said ""I did research on xyz...."" you'd have the prosecution (or defense, as the case may be) object immediately and try to suggest that the jury was now ""tainted"" with ""inadmissible"" evidence that hadn't been put through the rules of evidence.  This would be incorrect, as the information is unrelated to evidence about the criminal act its self, but that doesn't matter in a court of law.  If a lawyer can convince the judge that black is white, they will do it to get the outcome they want.     Law is a funny world.  Many lawyers believe some weird things about the concepts of truth and justice.  Truth is whatever you can prove in court (regardless of whether it is actually true).  Justice is served if a trial is ""fair""....not whether the verdict is correct (i.e. if the defendant is guilty and still walks one lawyer told me that this is justice if the trial followed the rules)."

It's really a two-way race between Clinton and O'Malley on the Democractic side. Bernie might be able to drive some of the discussion on the campaign trail, but he won't resonate.  If I were able to bet, my money is on O'Malley to be the Dem nominee, I think there are too many question marks and bs following Clinton, all she has going for her is the last name.   The GOP is not looking good either. Walker will win Iowa. Paul, Christie, or Bush will win NH, and then Rubio will do well in the South. All have pretty serious flaws."

He seems like the candidate that can gain momentum very quickly among independent voters. Sanders is a no-go beyond the fringes of the Democratic party, just like a Huckabee on the Republican side.   The only other one that could work his way in is Webb who is the closest to the center of the group.  Warren won't get in unless Hillary bows out, she has some accolades to her name and the love of the left, but she can get exposed in a general election outside of Massachusetts."

newhampshire,37inmt,thestupidlowlife,1 point,Thu May 28 01:55:28 2015 UTC,"Democratic socialism:       Democratic socialism is a political ideology advocating a democratic political system alongside a socialist economic system, involving a combination of political democracy with social ownership of the means of production. Sometimes used synonymously with ""socialism"", the adjective ""democratic"" is added to distinguish democratic socialism from Marxist-Leninist Communism.   Democratic socialism is distinguished from both the Soviet model of centralized socialism and from social democracy. This distinction arose from the allegedly authoritarian form of socialism that emerged in the Soviet Union in the 20th century.   Democratic socialism rejects the social democratic view of reform through state intervention within capitalism, seeing capitalism as incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality and solidarity. From this perspective, democratic socialists believe that the issues inherent to capitalism can only be solved by a transition from capitalism to socialism - by superseding private property with some form of social ownership; and that any attempt to address the economic contradictions of capitalism through reforms will only cause problems to emerge elsewhere in the economy.    However, ""democratic socialism"" is sometimes used as a synonym for social democracy, where ""social democracy"" refers to support for political democracy, regulation of the economy, and a welfare state.   There is no exact definition of democratic socialism. Some forms of democratic socialism overlap with social democracy, while many forms reject social democratic reformism in favor of more transformative methods, while some forms overlap with Revolutionary Socialism. The ""democratic"" element may refer to extending principles of democracy in the economy (such as through cooperatives or workplace democracy), or it may refer to support for a multi-party parliamentary democracy.

newhampshire,37ei7w,plunkti,2,Wed May 27 02:48:47 2015 UTC,"Newport and Claremont are nearby. Claremont took a bit of a turn for the worse about 15 years ago but it is still a very pretty, classic New England mill town. I went there recently and a local shop owner told me it is back on the rise. These aren't really ""cities"" outside of a rural New England context. Really, only Manchester and the seacoast are. But in Claremont you will find bars, restaurants, Walmart, and most other major chains. Also, I can't imagine that Concord, the state capital (though smaller than Manchester) is much more than 30-35 minutes away."
newhampshire,37ei7w,Winzip115,2,Wed May 27 01:32:31 2015 UTC,This is Claremont. It's not exactly a thriving metropolis but I really like it.

Lebanon is a nice town too, but probably a bit more pricey. John Hodgemen just had a show there, so there's culture!  It's around 30 minutes up I89 from Sunapee."

newhampshire,37f1ft,McAllisterforNH,5,Wed May 27 03:45:53 2015 UTC,What would you list as the most pressing issues that New Hampshire faces in the next ten years?
newhampshire,37f1ft,textfile,1 point,Wed May 27 12:03:48 2015 UTC,. It is always difficult to find a way to lower any tax without introducing a new tax or increasing an existing one. I believe a way to this is to legalize marijuana and tax it like Colorado did. We can then use that tax money to help pay teachers and make sure maintenance is being performed on both the building and the equipment. A majority of property taxes go towards these things and I believe this is the best way to lower them.
newhampshire,37f1ft,GodMike,2,Thu May 28 03:14:35 2015 UTC,What are your views on recreational marijuana?
newhampshire,37f1ft,GodMike,5,Thu May 28 20:23:53 2015 UTC,I believe that marijuana can be a great asset to help boost our economy and help us with our budget. This is a issue that needs to be put to bed and resolved!

There are many reasons for this, but I believe a big one is the lack of people going to trade school.  If more people picked up a trade, competition between colleges and trade schools would develop and I believe higher education costs would drop."

newhampshire,37enlr,sidepocket13,-3,Wed May 27 02:22:59 2015 UTC,"It isn't so much a benefit of one over the other, its the fact that this school has run for 200 years as an ""academy"" with a headmaster, and now, the school board has secretly changed the title to principal and has refused to even consider opening up the topic for another vote, despite the huge support from the community for the headmaster title."

newhampshire,374zpr,bpratt05,3,Sat May 30 00:31:11 2015 UTC,Me and my daughters(6&9yrolds) did kearsarge today from Winslow Park.  You can do a loop with the two trails located there(Winslow and Barlow) with a combined mileage of 2.7 miles. At the summit the views are spectacular and the summit is pretty much nothing but rock with minimal vegetation. It's a interesting place. The shorter of the two is actually harder and I would suggest taking that one up and decent down the other side(I can't remember if Barlow is the shorter or Winslow. Both trail heads start at the Winslow Park parking lot).
newhampshire,374zpr,bpratt05,2,Mon May 25 01:08:31 2015 UTC,I  just did Mount percival and Mount morgan loop with a friend. It was about the same height 2500 feet i think. About 4 miles and difficult rating. Lots of rocks to climb and very steep at times. Check it out really fun.

You may be able to do something similar for all the days (unless you're sometimes working in Mass, then not those days).    If you're not working in Mass at all, talk to your employer, its possible that you might not need to have Mass tax withholding.

Essentially, there is a calculation done that is your days working in MA vs. your days working in NH which is applied to your MA tax bill (which should be zero, what with that whole 'no taxation without representation' business).    In any event, it is not an insignificant amount of money, but you cannot e-file your MA taxes, has to be done on paper and mailed in.

You still report it, but if you are careful with receipts and documentation you can get a bunch back on your taxes.   You will still have to file if you work more than 90 days for a MA company, but when you file your taxes you can document things there and get some of it back.

The ""conventional wisdom"" was that you would only pay taxes on the income earned while your ass was within the Mass border. However, I could not then, and can not now, find any documentation on the Mass DOR site that justifies the claim. I paid my taxes.  Now.. as a non-resident, you do not have to pay Mass income tax on any income that you earned from a non ""Massachusetts source"" (this is the DOR term that is used). For example, if I make money in NH by delivering newspapers, Massachusetts doesn't get to tax me on that. But if it is a ""Massachusetts source"" then as far as I have been able to determine, they want their money.  I am not a lawyer, and I am certainly not a tax lawyer, but unless you get someone from the Mass DOR to say, ""go for it!"" I would pay the tax.

When people don't have access to affordable health care they don't seek medical attention until it becomes a crisis. And then we are on the hook for the cost anyway. The hospital passes those costs along to everyone else, for example. I say take the money while it's offered at least. But, we should make this a priority. Healthy residents contribute to society.

I believe we need to stop focusing on moving our budgets money around and start trying to obtain more out of state revenue. We should NOT have to consider cutting state jobs to pass a budget. I believe this is where gambling and marijuana can be assets to our state. If we not only allow casinos to be built but allow small businesses the same rights, we could make New Hampshire a one stop tourist attractions. Camping, hiking, skiing and gambling can help us bring us much needed revenue. After watching Colorado's success after the legalization of marijuana, there is no doubt we could jump start our state economy and as a result, help with our budget. Thank you for your question 😊"

The government is pretty notorious for these ridiculous blanket bills. They just list every chemical combination possible so they don't have to provide any meaningful solution. You need special clearance to buy some incredibly simple compounds used to make thousands of other chemicals just because it could possibly be used as a precursor to some illicit drug.

newhampshire,368074,justsomeguy911,10,Sun May 17 01:32:04 2015 UTC,"It really is relative. Part of the reason why it is becoming such a big deal here is because hardcore drugs have never been that big of a problem here. Alcoholism has always been a much larger factor. To be honest you really are going to only really find it if you are looking for it. I have lived in in NH my entire life and not once have I had someone try to sell me heroin or meth and I am know for being more curious than cautious. The usage of these drugs has risen but it is not an epidemic. People get hooked on RX drugs like Oxycontin and Ritalin and then eventually make the shift to the street drug because their RX expires, street drugs are cheaper, or other reasons but then they are generally unfamiliar with concentrations in those street drugs and then OD. Another factor is that street drugs often vary widely as to their potency and a lot of the new stuff coming in is more potent and users are in unprepared. Police also want it to make it seem like a bigger problem because they are in a time of serious scrutiny and really wish to show the need for bigger budgets. Not a shot at police in general, just how it is.  Tldr; Yes, hardcore drug use is up in NH but not to the epidemic proportions the media and police report. Overdoses are up because of inexperienced street drug users and more potent drugs. The amount of ODs is not proportional to new users. NH is still by many metrics one of the top places in the country to live.

NYC would be drug free.  The media is what it is. Just fluffy fury and fear.  In reality, all poor rural areas, and developing urban areas, have social issues to address. Compared to truly poor areas in rural and urban areas, such as that swath from Western NY down into W.Virginia that you are referring to... believe me, as I've family down there... Northern New England does not know what real drug problems are."

One look at the crime rate in your ""ghetto"" part of PA vs the rate up here should be all it takes to convince you."

By numbers, is it worse than previous times? absolutely!! I don't argue against that point. But that isn't my point here.   I just don't get why people are so appalled. It is really strange to me. Are there a bunch of junkies and panhandlers? For a state that has just over a million people it would seem that way, but that is only if you look at it on that tiny scale. There is so much good here that I can't ever imagine ever telling someone that they shouldn't live in place X, Y, or Z.   I'm in Concord. I love the city. I'll hear people here talk about how bad Manchester is. What? It's not that bad. I wouldn't want to live there, but that has nothing to do with the city itself, it just isn't my kind of place, but I love going out to eat there, shopping, or meeting with friends at a few other places. It's a great big/little city, however, people talk about it like it's some slum.   I can't imagine living anywhere else but NH. Maybe because I've done a lot of traveling , visited a ton of different cities that may or may not have slum areas that I am just not able to see what people view as bad because I've seen worse. I like to think that it's because there is so much good here in NH. This state is absolutely amazing and I've met some of the most wonderful people in my entire life.   When I view the medias portrayal of the NH drug epidemic, I look at it not on a State level, but look at it on a level that encompasses all of the surrounding states that are New England. When I look at it from that standpoint, because all of the states up here are so small, I realize that this so called epidemic  isn't any different than any other part of the U.S.   thats my rant.

It is a reasonably diverse small/medium city. It has some very nice areas, large swaths of comfortably middle class suburban like areas, large swaths of not as nice but livable areas of triple deckers and a small portion of that last part does indeed classify as shithole.   Saying you should avoid it completely... is short sighted and... your opinion. Which you are perfectly entitled to have. I'm offering a different perspective.

We're on the subject of where to live (which we've agreed is subject to opinion). My comment of avoiding at all costs is directly related to the same. This isn't to say I wouldn't drive through it, and maybe grab a meal and some gas.   Someone relocating hundreds of miles for an overall better locale would be doing themselves a great disservice for living in one of the places I listed. He could stay in PA and do better than Manchvegas or even Derry.   The OP's 'ghetto' parts of PA are quite likely to be far worse than anything Manchester has to offer.    In general, I'd agree. Having recently been to, stayed, and experienced where he's from I understand exactly what he's trying to get away from. If I had to draw a somewhat local comparison, I'd say he's coming from someplace Fall River, MA. On the whole, Nash or Manch aren't close but they have there parts where the line gets blurry and certainly should avoid them to make the move worth it."

newhampshire,368074,hooty88,4,Sun May 17 13:44:24 2015 UTC,"Somersworth and Rochester aren't so bad that you should avoid choosing to live there. The key is to avoid moving to the cheapest house you can find in the downtown areas. These places are usually run by shady landlords that don't care if the house is falling apart or what kind of tenant they attract, because they bought it cheap and want to go for the quick buck. It should be obvious to anyone that in any case the lowest prices attract a lower class of people.  Both of the cities are generally cheap to live in, so all he'd need to know is not to try and cut costs, or he'll end up in a shitty part of a decent city. There are plenty of reasonable rural houses for low prices. Right now is the time to buy, because there are so many houses on the market that sellers will make big cuts in order to be done with the process. I'm not too sure about how prices are going, so I can't say the same about that (I've in the same price for some time now).  With that said, OP said he was concerned about drugs so what I have to say is this: You're more likely to see someone doing drugs in Rochester than in Somersworth, based mainly on the fact that it's a bigger city. You likely won't see someone on drugs unless you go out and purposefully start cruising around looking for them. Even then, your chances are minimal. Most drug users know better than to go wandering the streets and chancing being picked up by the cops.  These two cities are trying to get themselves back on track, with Somersworth specifically trying to revitalize its downtown through both government action and certain local families heavily reinvesting in multiple downtown properties. In fact, it wasn't too long ago that people were glad to say that they were from either of these cities and there was a larger sense of community between their residents.  Sorry if I kind of prattled on there. Being dismissive of my home annoys me. It's not a bad place to live, or else I wouldn't live here."

I've lived in Manchester for a bit over a year and haven't had any issues with addicts or finding needles. There's some parts of the city I would avoid after dark, but there's other areas that are perfectly safe. I feel totally comfortable living here."
newhampshire,368074,iambronco,1 point,Mon May 18 02:38:24 2015 UTC,"As someone who has grown up in Manchester and Concord I will say this: all cities have crime. No city will be completely drug and crime free. That being said, NH is not bad at all when it comes to drugs.   Media may like to make it seem like everyone here shoots up heroin but the fact of the matter is that these people are the outliers. Most people here don't have a drug issue (even in Manchester). The worst drug issue I have seen happen here is a meth house across the street was busted.   NH is an exceptional place to be and is basically empty. The population of NH I'd around 1 mil so there is not many people here to begin with. Additionally, most places in northern NH is just trees and the people who live up north just like hiking. No drug issues.  The only places in Manchester where drugs take place you won't be if you have common sense. Yes, the section 8 apartment people have some serious problems (I know since I live in section 8 housing) but why would you spend any significant time there?   NH is basically drug free. The little drugs that NH has is mainly in the big cities and even then its not a problem at all. Use common sense and don't walk in certain places at night and you should be fine. All the people who say Manchester is a hellhole filled with drug addicts really have not seen how bad some other cities are."

I'd have to agree with the others that the biggest change is the increased interest from reporters.  Aside from a few areas in the major cities, which at worst I may have felt slightly uncomfortable alone or in the evening, I can't think of anywhere in the state I didn't feel safe or that I would recommend that you avoid. I think the biggest factor should be what area suits your preferences as far urban/rural feel and any other needs (school system, public services, etc). Just be sure to check out the area you're considering moving to and ask the locals about the neighborhood and go with what speaks to you."

Also, the tax wouldn't restrict you in your ability to build your own firearm or acquire one through some means other than purchasing from a manufacturer.

You may be better off buying a cheap car off craigslist and looking into whether you'll get a better deal selling the jetta for scrap or donating it and writing it off at the end of the year.

newhampshire,35y1j5,Tridentt23,9,Thu May 14 13:48:20 2015 UTC,"So much to do, not sure where to start...  Go exploring in White Mountain National Forest.  Mt Washington is an obvious choice for a hike/drive, but there are other peaks as well.  Google around for stuff to do in this region.  You'll find something that fits your interests.    A bit father east, my favorite shortish hike is Mt. Major.  It takes about 2.5 hrs round trip for a capable adult (not including rest/taking in the views).  It's a very accessible hike with great views of Lake Winnipesaukee and the surrounding area.  Also, if fresh water is your thing, playing in Lake Winnipesaukee make for a nice day trip with Alton having just enough ice cream and family food to keep it from being ""rough"".  On the seacoast, Odiorne is nice, and has Wallis Sands Beach right down the road for more play.  Jenness Beach is a bit further down if you want to try your hand at surfing (rentals across the street at Summer Sessions).  The Hampton Beach ""Boardwalk"" is always busy in the summer, but it's basically a  massive tourist trap with shops, games, and lots of delicious fried food.  Some people dig that kind of thing though.  For all that beach stuff (Hampton Beach to Odiorne), it's worth just driving down that road (Ocean Blvd/ 1A).  The views are fantastic.  In fact, the whole strip from Hampton Beach up 1A to Newcastle via 1B is pretty fantastic.  There are some nice drives along the coast in Maine too.  Across the Border in Maine is Long Sands Beach in York and Nubble Lighthouse is right up the road.  Mount Agamenticus has wonderful views, good hiking trails, a small but fun ""Learning Lodge"" (check the hours), and gives you a pretty good chance of seeing some raptors.  Portsmouth always has plenty of stuff happening in the summer, and the area is a restaurant mecca, especially for it's size.  Check out Strawberry Banke and Prescott Park for activity schedules.    Also, remember that drive down 1B?  You'll likely be able to see the Isles of Shoals out in the distance.  From Portsmouth, you can hop on a boat and take a trip out there to Star Island.  If you have the time and the day is nice, it's a great trip (and you'll likely see some minke whales and/or dolphins along the way).  Really, if you get out to the coast, you could do a lot worse than stopping in Portsmouth.  It's a pretty cool town, but I may be biased ;-)  Lastly, everyone will have lobster rolls and some form of chowder.  If you really want to sample the stuff, ask some locals.  Red's Eats (further up in Maine) apparently has the best lobster roll on the planet or some such nonsense.  But you'll stand in line for an hour+ and find that it tastes a lot like everyone else's.  If you want suggestions for the Portsmouth area, hit me up.  Disclaimer: Not sure about your family's abilities, so double check any hikes to make sure they're in your wheelhouse."
newhampshire,35y1j5,cujo,2,Thu May 14 14:28:09 2015 UTC,I'd second the Isles of Shoals for someone from Michigan. It's probably the most Coastal NE experience you can get without touring Maine.  Lots of good suggestions in your post. :)

newhampshire,35y1j5,Meretseger,2,Fri May 15 01:07:44 2015 UTC,"Well, in fairness, their chowder is pretty damn good.    With rare exception, you can't really screw up your food choices in Portsmouth.  There's something for everyone unless you're into Mexican food.  Agave is ok, but we lack authentic Mexican food.  Obviously it depends on the type of food you're looking for, but I tend to go to more of the beer happy places downtown.  The Portsmouth Brewery and Earth Eagle both do surprisingly good food for ""pubs"".  Coat of Arms if somewhat novel in that their ""British"" offerings are pretty unique and their beer list is also pretty good.    This time of year, you can't go wrong with some Jimmy Juice at Old Ferry Landing.  Their food is pretty much just lobster rolls/salads/etc and fried seafood, but it's well done.  The location is great so it gets packed on weekends.  Consider yourself warned.  If you want some nicer places, I like Michelle's on Market Square.  Great food, very cozy atmosphere.  Aside from that, Rudi's, Radici, and several others on Congress are all good, but more special occasion places for me.  They're pricier and fairly ""fancy"".  At the same time, Radici has a killer bloody mary bar on Sunday mornings.    If you want pizza, and it's actually open, Savario's is the best around.  There are plenty of good places, but Savario's is at the top of the list.  You can't really eat there though (1 2-top, iirc).  But you could do worse than taking it down to Prescott Park to enjoy.    Now, all that said, Portsmouth has more restaurant seat than population (seriously, look it up), but my absolute favorite restaurant in the area is actually across the river in Kittery.  The Black Birch has the best combo of food and drink that I've found, and I can't recommend it enough.  It fills up quickly though, so if you aren't doing an earlier dinner (5 vs 6) be prepared to wait no matter the day of the week.  Whew, I feel like I should start blogging this stuff.  So many choices!  Hope this helps!  P.S. Oh, and probably avoid Sake.  I haven't been in a couple of years, but it has been shit for a while."

He got into real estate and mortgaging and got enough rich enough to start buying racehorses as an investment. He ended up going pretty balls deep into it but if you haven't guessed, he's something of a difficult personality. Even by his own telling of a jockey debacle, it sounds like something of a rich guy fucking with an industry's accepted order that in turn told him to fuck off.

There's also a building number of stamp stations, closing in on the 100 mark here in NH. It's all about getting out there and breaking the American taboo of not talking about politics. As a country we've spent too long not communicating with our friends and neighbors.

newhampshire,35mk0a,jcboarder901,11,Tue May 12 14:44:09 2015 UTC,Filming someone in public does not give them the right to attack you. What the fuck are you talking about?
newhampshire,35mk0a,GeneralJohnStark,-3,Tue May 12 16:55:49 2015 UTC,It is probably a good thing the person in the video didn't shoot anyone because I do not believe that shooting would be justified by self defense  http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/LXII/627/627-4.htm  It's deadly force against non-deadly force (didn't see or hear anything about a deadly weapon) and there is obvious ability to flee since they are not in their home or their home's curtilage.  Enjoy being the vigilante patrol squad but you're just asking for a murder or attempted murder charge.
newhampshire,35mk0a,GeneralJohnStark,9,Tue May 12 18:24:15 2015 UTC,"It's a stand your ground case.  The Camera-holder was in a public place where he had legal right to be.  Ultimately if things went south it would be for Police, AG and possibly Jury to decide.  But 3-4 people charging an individual seems very justifiable to me.  Just because those three don't have a gun doesn't mean they a a ""non-deadly force"".  He attempted twice to retreat from the encounter and they pursued him until the police arrived."
newhampshire,35mk0a,GeneralJohnStark,-1,Tue May 12 18:42:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get that all. But the RSA doesn't support him using deadly force against non-deadly force. You can stand your ground but if you escalate, typically, you are now the assailant. Using a deadly weapon against non-deadly force is typically construed as escalating. I didn't see any evidence of attempting to retreat from the video.  http://www.seacoastonline.com/article/20130524/news/305240416  Doesn't seem to support using deadly against non-deadly, but isn't really clear.  Stand your ground RSAs seem to reference RSA 627:4 which is just what I had posted anyway."
newhampshire,35mk0a,shazammerbammer,3,Tue May 12 22:45:38 2015 UTC,"But deadly force doesn't require having a gun.  If three people are beating the shit out of you, you can defend yourself with deadly force.  Three people could easily kill an individual without using a weapon.  There's nothing in the law about escalating the situation.  Not in NH, but the Trayvon Martin case is a perfect example that everyone knows of, and the Florida law is very similarly worded.  That was an unarmed assailant, deadly force used to defend against him.  The person with the camera didn't draw their weapon until 3-4 people were running at him, did you miss that part where he ran and dropped his phone?"
newhampshire,35mk0a,shazammerbammer,0,Tue May 12 23:24:03 2015 UTC,"That seems reasonable I just don't know that it has gone through the courts such that there's reliable precedent. I sure don't want to be the defendant setting that precedent.  I think a lot of people rightfully think the Trayvon Martin case was wrongly decided... so although an illustrative example, not something I'd gamble my freedom on!  It wasn't clear that the people were running at him with intent to harm... just that one dude that seemed to be shirtless? There was movement before the gun was dropped but isn't clear that he was retreating. I don't know exactly what happened from that vid.  I want the right to defend myself but also do not want my family to be killed by someone starting a fight for stupid reasons. It's a tough balance that I don't think this country has figured out yet and I'm simply exploring what NH has going on since I'm licensed."
newhampshire,35mk0a,ChopperIndacar,2,Tue May 12 23:44:07 2015 UTC,"I'm also licensed, and if it ever comes down to it I sure hope I'm on my property and its very clear cut. I'm by no means a lawyer, but I do try to stay well versed in second amendment issues, and I keep a copy of the law you cite in my wallet with my license. There is definitely case law that supports using a firearm to defend oneself against an unarmed assailant.  I'm citing big ones that everyone knows, despite how anyone feels about it, the Ferguson case is another where deadly force was used against an unarmed individual.  If someone is coming at you, you have no obligation to understand what they are thinking, and if you feel that there is an imminent threat of death or grave bodily harm to you deadly force is an option.  If a reasonable and prudent person feels that they are in grave danger, they can counter with deadly force (which doesn't just mean a gun, the law you cite could also apply in a fist fight, it dictates the situations where one can defend their life by taking of another's).  I think in any situation where one is outnumbered by aggressive attackers, even if they are unarmed, is reasonable to think they could kill or cause grave bodily harm, and I would be glad to have the reasonable people of NH on a jury if it came down to it."
newhampshire,35mk0a,Jhad31,3,Wed May 13 11:32:22 2015 UTC,"I think you're right. It's not even that grey of an area. The 3 bozos chased across a street at this guy yelling verbal threats after he told them he was armed and would defend himself.  If they keep coming, it's definitely a threat against his life."
newhampshire,35mk0a,ChopperIndacar,0,Wed May 13 12:30:58 2015 UTC,"My presumption was there was 1 guy being aggressive and the other two were the crying ladies that were following the 1 guy, not chasing after the cameraman to cause serious bodily harm."

newhampshire,35mk0a,bluerat,-2,Sat May 16 18:02:04 2015 UTC,Any case law to support that? Not saying he did anything wrong just want to make sure that we're keeping within the law when they do.
newhampshire,35mk0a,ullrsdream,2,Tue May 12 22:45:51 2015 UTC,"You want case law supporting the claim that multiple unarmed assailants attacking a single victim counts as unlawful deadly force, i.e. the threshold necessary for the victim to justify lawful deadly force in New Hampshire?    Do you doubt that getting your ass kicked by multiple assailants could result in your death?    I'm not sure I could find a specific case in NH where someone shot multiple unarmed attackers, but I'm positive I could find cases in the US where multiple-on-one attacks are ruled as deadly force."

newhampshire,35mk0a,carsonseyebrows,5,Tue May 12 12:15:38 2015 UTC,"Think about it from another perspective. What if the guys who were being filmed started threatening or got physical with the girls, but because they were being filmed it stopped them? Plus, there is no exception of privacy in public."
newhampshire,35mk0a,VitaminPie,0,Tue May 12 12:50:44 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing though, if they did start beating her, what was he gonna do, record the whole thing and later report it? fat lot of good that'll do. If he though the girl was in danger he should have called the cops first and then been there as a witness. He put himself in needless danger because he felt like he was a tough guy since he had the gun on his belt.  if you look at this guys YouTube, he is very anti-cop, to the point he has openly said he hopes cops get shot and die. If you notice the cop calls him by name without being introduced, they clearly know him. He was looking for an excuse to pull his gun and get YouTube hits."
newhampshire,35mk0a,Sovereign_Curtis,3,Tue May 12 13:04:02 2015 UTC,"Right, I totally forgot that video evidence wouldn't be important for conviction after an arrest...Also, video tapping might have deterred the guys from escalating the situation where the girls could have gotten hurt. He was video tapping in public, which is completely legal. The only people who put him in danger were the girl and guys who were trying to attack him.  Who said he didn't call the cops? And what exactly should he have done? Just walked away?   His youtube channel doesn't really matter here. How does him being anti cop remotely change how you look at the facts? Everyone has his opinions and you can even hear him saying how thankful he was that the cops were there.   Lets hope you are never in a situation where someone could possibly help you out in potentially dangerous situation because you wouldn't want them recording it..."

newhampshire,35n5k7,SiberianShibe,4,Mon May 11 22:31:56 2015 UTC,All the gun clubs I've talked to have waiting lists larger than your average Tumblerette.   I'm honestly disappointed in NH that outdoor shooting is so hush hush and not supported. In Colorado where I use to live the town had a state run shooting lane that cost them next to nothing to build and maintain.

Every outdoor range that I used to target shoot at has been closed up and posted over the years because of neighbors complaining. Now I go to the Deering Rod and Gun club. They have a nice outdoor range and the membership is not too expensive."
newhampshire,35n5k7,5arge,0,Tue May 12 17:18:57 2015 UTC,Yeah there are definitely no NH residents that are from other states initially that enjoy shooting. Nope. Everyone moves here and shits on the fun for the lifers. I know it's true because someone else said it online once.

Just find yourself some public land near you that's away from other folks and has a good backstop/isn't right next to a major road.  You'll probably find out that no one ever bothers you and you've got ""your spot"".    Its not that its hush hush or rare.....its more that its so common that people just find ""their spot"" and don't really share it.    Just clean up afterwards and no one will mind."

Also Devil's Den in Alton/ New Durham has some places to shoot. Just find one of the sandpits that had a nice backstop and make sure there aren't houses behind it"
newhampshire,35n5k7,akmjolnir,1 point,Thu May 14 17:20:12 2015 UTC,"So as a general rule in NH you can shoot anywhere you are 100 yds from a residence, business, or public roadway with an suitable backstop and not in the direction of populated areas. That said it is always best to go someplace that it is decidedly ok to shoot. The two places that come to mind are the sand pit off of Pinkham B road up in the White Mountain National Forest near Dolly Coop Campground. Not going to be long distance but decent for pistol. The other is at the end of Rines Road in Wolfbrough. This is a bigger and is more established but there are a fair bit of hikers and ATVs around. Here is a decent reference for specifics NH gun laws.

Every study conducted shows that if it's treated like a disease rather then a crime, the usage rates significantly drop. I'd be happy to provide sources if anyone is interested. Since I don't see that happening any time soon in this area, or indeed the country, the epidemic will only get worse. If you want to see it get better, remember, support, not public shaming, is the way to go. Obviously not supporting the habit, but the person who is sick. And yes, like it or not, addiction is an illness and needs to be treated as such to see results. I hope more people in the southern NH area, NH in general, and the country, see that with just a little help and love, these people can become productive members of society. Thank you :)"

But if you really want to help them, you do need to contact politicians. There aren't enough resources in NH or the country for addicts. There isn't a single needle exchange or a place to get narcan in NH. People wait weeks or months to get into treatment. There use to be a long term treatment program in Nashua. Now they do a 90 program at most. The long term program saved my mom's life, and she now works at the local shelter and that same rehab. There is no where you can go in NH to get long term treatment unless you have tons of money. Know why? No one lobbies for addicts. My mom and I both do, but we're in the minority. Politicians would rather spend that money on... honestly, ANYTHING else. They think it's a lost cause. But one life being saved is worth it.   You know, writing a letter and being supportive to a friend aren't mutually exclusive things. You can do both. I wasn't complaining; indeed, this is my first post in this sub.

My friend has turned to hard drugs and now is a meth and heroin addict.  I want her to be safe and just last night I went with her to one of her friends houses in Nashua which turned out to basically be a tweaker house.  I brought water, food and things they would need to try to keep them safe.  I can't believe the problems these people face.  After having seen it ruin a friend's life first hand it really hits home.  I hope the usage of these drugs dwindles soon but I don't think that will happen unless these people know that we are on their side and don't want to put them in cages for their problems.

To really make that change happen you need to expose people to the sub culture and the mind set that exists in drug user communities.  People don't want to expose themselves to that.  Except for the ""crazies"" like me.  I'm crazy because I can see these addicts as people.  I think that people who see drug addicts as sub human have just as much a problem as the addicts.  These people just need some help.  A push in the right direction or a good role model can help but that role model shouldn't be critical but should help the addict themselves be self critical.  They should question the addicts about their purpose and try to help them see that they can have purpose and that they can enjoy themselves in fulfilling that purpose without drugs.  Right now I'm trying to write an article about the drug problems in NH because it's about time we change or attitudes and start really helping these people get their lives back."

It's too strong - people start off sniffing or smoking it and move to injection when they can't get the same high as before. The most common course of treatment, Methadone, replaces one form of addiction with another. More research needs to be done in blocking opiod receptors to truly find a ""cure."" It's readily available - focus on drug busts is at getting low level users and distributors (who are often dealing to support their own habits) off the streets vs. tracing the sources up high enough to make a real difference. As other posters have stated, it's treated like a crime vs. an addition.  No matter how many of our friends and neighbors are impacted, we still have the stigma that this is something that only affects ""those"" people and the ones we know personally are an exception vs. a norm.  Guess what, it's everywhere and it impacts everyone.  If you don't know a close friend or family member (or know someone whow knows one) who's been addicted, you're just not paying attention."

I want some BIG government back.  Raise taxes on the rich, close corporate tax loopholes, put people back to work on our infrastructure, fix education funding so that 22 year olds don't leave school owing $100k before their first job, demilitarize the police, and repeal The Patriot Act.  Then an amendment sticking Citizens United right up the Supreme Courts' ass.    That's a start."

And I despise it when people pretend to be looking out for me by saying we need to raise taxes to take money by force from people we could earn money from voluntarily. If using force is never acceptable in real life, then how can it be acceptable when a bunch of people vote to have someone else do it for them?   Yes there are some corrupt rich people at the top (especially in some of the major 'connected' corporations,) but the great majority of the richest 1% of Americans came by their money honestly by making superior products that people wanted to buy or by just working really hard for someone else. It's completely immoral to steal money from them by raising the taxes on them. Obviously you are concerned with ethics and what's ""right"" or else you would not be posting here, so how can someone concerned with ethics such as yourself support a system that is nothing short of sanctioned plunder?

Of course when morning rolled around and she called animal control, the guy had called out sick. So my mom poked holes in a shoe box and brought him to the humane society.

Their presence indicates that you have healthy unpolluted streams nearby.  There's not much you can do about them that will do more than provide temporary relief for a few hours. They are strong fliers and can travel long distances. Pesticides are illegal without a permit (and they don't work long anyway). You could try foggers, or put a strong fan on your porch, but the best thing to do is wear netting, screen in your porch, or use a screen room."

newhampshire,34tgxm,Lillipout,5,Mon May 4 22:01:08 2015 UTC,"This is a Detroit Publishing Co photo which were used as references for printing postcards. here is the postcard they eventually produced from this image. That hotel on the right is the Altamonte House (photo), built in 1876 with a capacity of 75-100 guests. It was also known as the Park House and Ranlet's Hotel. It was one of about 30 hotels in Bethlehem at that time and after 1910, served a primarily Jewish clientele. Like many Bethlehem hotels, it fell into disrepair and was an eyesore on Main St for years. It was torn down in 1986. Here is the current Google street view of this location - across the street from the Colonial Theater and on the corner of Park Ave. Behind the hotel down Park Ave was the railroad depot. The building at the left of the image was the Mountain View House, capacity about 30 guests. The buildings just beyond the Altamonte are the Howard House, built in 1873 by the Governor of Rhode Island and the Strawberry Hill House."

newhampshire,34os3s,kersey79,10,Sun May 3 03:45:45 2015 UTC,Betty was my neighbor in Portsmouth when I was a kid. Such an incredibly nice woman. She used to have a flock of chickens in her yard that she would let my brothers and I play with. I had no idea who she was until we had moved away and I saw an article on her and her husband in the paper after her death. Apparently the chickens were her alien alert system and they would let her know when the aliens were coming back to abduct her again. It made sense when I remembered how mad she would get at my little brother for scaring them.

newhampshire,34oflm,ImpalaPooge,5,Sun May 3 03:29:30 2015 UTC,"The guy whom some suspect of doing it is and from what I hear was a prime suspect during investigations is apparently batshit crazy.  He puts really strange signs out in front of his house advertising what I think is supposed to be his income or savings, along with some incomprehensible non sequiturs and/or invitations for women to date him, which he changes randomly, has an invisible friend he talks to, mows his lawn in a leopard-print G-string, and the list goes on.  He's probably schizophrenic.  I'm not naming locations or anything but I'll just say he's something of a local legend.  Also, someone I know really well, her brother found one of the victims' bodies.  The way she related it to me, he was sitting on a log while hunting, poked at what he thought was a large mushroom on the ground with a stick, but it turned out to be the top of a skull.  It's in pretty close proximity to where said crazy guy lives. I'll also note that all the rumors about him being the murderer might just be the typical gossip of locals who pick out the local outsider/one they like least and the mentally ill have always been an easy target for that sort of thing."
newhampshire,34oflm,Defenestrationism,3,Sun May 3 07:20:29 2015 UTC,"Ya, I know which guy your refering to. I always thought he seemed too easy of a target, i figured a guy that has done such a poor job covering up his oddities and is so blatant with everything else would have a hard time covering up several murders...  I've read pretty much everything available online and Shadow of Death (Which is a very well written book btw, available on Amazon for $4.00 used, shipped to your door) just trying to understand it. I grew up VERY close to the location of the Saxtons River victim, and was a kid when it all happened so it had no idea about it then, but it has always fascinated me since I learned about it.  There have been so many suspects on each different crime, that they almost sometimes seem random, but just have so much similarity also.  If you know of any other material on the subject I'd love to read it.  BTW: Thanks for ruining the fun that is poking things while I'm bored hunting...LOL"
newhampshire,34oflm,ImpalaPooge,1 point,Sun May 3 14:33:24 2015 UTC,"Well, in fairness, mentally ill doesn't necessarily mean they aren't intelligent or capable of committing such crimes in a manner where they have plausible deniability, and I hear that guy is actually pretty intelligent when he's not spouting his craziness.  I suppose him being the murderer is plausible, but you probably know more about the case than me given your reading.  Was there anything else notable about him in the books and materials you've read.  Someone else I know lives near him and he visits her once in a while when he's out walking, usually has to be politely shooed away and sent back home.  She has known him for a long time and seems to think he's basically harmless, not that this is evidence of guilt or innocence.  I'm sure it's still generally safe to poke at things as your chances of running across a corpse are still rather tiny.  :-b"
newhampshire,34oflm,Defenestrationism,2,Sun May 3 14:43:06 2015 UTC,"Ya, I was more refering to the fact that someone so ""outspoken"" would have a hard time not being more vocal about involvement. There is quite a bit about him in the book, but it's all pretty much what you stated, a local ""legend"" who was everyone's first guess because off his oddities and didn't help his case by just being so different.  There where several other suspects, many of which seemed more likely involved with certain murders from my reading, I'm not 100% sold on it all being one person. But to be fair I'm sure there is much I don't know. I really feel for anyone effected by these crimes, the lack of conclusion must be torture.  This area and right across the river has so much crime beneath the surface it's pretty unbelievable. Much of it is now drug related, but this whole region has more than its fair share of murders and disappearances, it's pretty sad for such a beautiful region."

newhampshire,34jran,DieCommieScum,2,Sat May 2 19:28:10 2015 UTC,"Probably not.  Just looked it up. The Tesla is a 10kwh. As long as it's meant for constant recharge (deep cycle) then you'd be good.  What you would want is to run off continuous solar power during the day and your battery at night. If you use 10kwh per day you'll want a 8.8kwh battery so that you can use it at night + have a buffer in case you use more.  An 8.8 kwh battery from a solar installer runs around 7k. They are not cheap.  You can instead daisy chain lower end batteries like the ones found at wholesale solar. For the same kwh battery you would buy 7 AGM US 2000's and get a bit over that 8.8kwh for $1855.  Like I said, if you are willing to learn and do your own electrical, you can buy wholesale and be good to go. You are dealing with high voltage electricity, so maybe have a friend that knows what he's doing around or have a professional electrician come take a look at the final product for a small fee before you switch it on. It'd be worth not starting a fire."

newhampshire,34jran,invenio78,-2,Tue May 5 23:26:43 2015 UTC,What a scam. SolarCity gets all the tax incentives and profit of selling energy back to the grid while you get a $50 /mo savings off your regular utility bill.
newhampshire,34jran,rj218,6,Sat May 2 11:17:47 2015 UTC,"How is that a scam? It sounds like a win-win. Not everyone has $10k+ kicking around for a solar panel install. Solar City offers no money down install, you save money on electricity, everyone wins."

newhampshire,34eciq,ChopperIndacar,2,Thu Apr 30 14:36:51 2015 UTC,It's not fracking that causes earthquakes. It's the injection of saltwater waste into the ground. There's no oil and gas in granite. It's not for injection either.
newhampshire,34eciq,AgaveNeomexicana,3,Thu Apr 30 14:45:06 2015 UTC,I thought the injecting of the water was fracking? or at least part of it.
newhampshire,34eciq,boondoggie42,10,Thu Apr 30 21:22:59 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, that's right. Fracking is injecting water and grit into layers of shale. The high pressure fractures the shale, the grit props open the cracks after the pressure is relieved. Since deep formations are usually full of salt water, the water used to pressurize the formations gets contaminated. As the well starts to produce oil and / or gas, the contaminated water flows out. This is just a temporary process. The pressures are gone in a matter of hours. The pressure is further relieved as the oil and gas flows out.Then the problem is what do you do with a large amount of dirty, oily, chemical contaminated salt water? If you dump it in the nearest creek, everything downstream dies, and landowners get really pissed. So, typically the wastewater is trucked to the sorts of places that host landfills. The waters is injected deep underground into formations that are already filled with saltwater (and therefore aren't going to be used for drinking water). This is permanant. Large amounts of new water are going to affect the surrounding rock. This is what leads to earthquakes. The same thing happens when you build a dam. As the reservoir fills, all that new weight has to be fit in to the local structures, often leading to earthquakes."

newhampshire,34f3dl,bostonmolasses,5,Thu Apr 30 16:52:25 2015 UTC,"First they say this:   Noting that our ability to conduct comparative proportionality review in this case is complicated by the practical reality that no other defendant has been convicted of a capital crime and sentenced to death in this state since the legislature adopted the current death penalty statute in 1977   And then almost immediately following they say this:   Rather, the question before us is whether the death penalty imposed in this case is “aberrational . . . with respect to similar cases.   Now I may just be an old-fashioned back-country lawyer chicken, but if no other death penalty cases have happened in the last ~40 years, than couldn't any death penalty case be considered aberrational?  EDIT: Reading the report further, it all boiled down to a quantitative analysis by the defense being rejected in favor of a qualitative analysis organized by the State. The base size of cases included the framework used to evaluate this case relative to ""similar cases"" was the primary determining factor in a man's death at the hands of the State."
newhampshire,34f3dl,ATG77,0,Fri May 1 12:58:08 2015 UTC,"It could be, but they explicitly reject that argument. They suggest that the mere fact that the State does not use a particular sentencing option for an extended period of time, that option does not automatically become disproportionate or excessive once it is used.  A contrary holding would mean that the state would need to execute with a certain amount of frequency in order for the death penalty to remain an option. That would be rather perverse result."

It's a challenging, fun activity, that requires skill and effort to do it well.  I find it rewarding when I do it well.    That said, I also like the idea that my Chief of Police takes a look at people that want to carry their firearms in Condition 1 or 2 in public.  I like that the Chief says: ""Let's see, Larry Behaveshimselferson here is an upstanding member of the community, takes care of his property, helps his neighbors, and is generally an all-round good guy. He get's a YES."" I also like that he looks at Billy MacDrinksalot and says: ""Now Billy here, we've been called out to his house any number of times for fights with his girlfriend of the moment, parties that got out of control, and we've had to pull him out of fights at the local watering hole.  On top of that he's working on his third DUI, and he just got fired from his third job in the last ten months.  So, Billy... we're going to say NO.""    This isn't Deadwood, as much as people like to think that we Americans are still living the life of the Mountain Men, or Cowboys on the range, we're past that now.  I know people like to feel all self-reliant, and Rooster Cogburn-y...  But times have changed.  It's time to start looking at ourselves as part of a whole, a part of society.  We're evolving away from the rugged individualist phase, and growing into the phase of working together to achieve even more.    I will always like to shoot, even if I don't hunt anymore.  So relax, I'm not out to ""come get yer guns!""  I just believe that, in this day and age, you should have to get someones permission to go all ""cocked and locked"" around my nieces and nephews at the mall."

He get's a YES.""   Well there are some issues in you arguments. The first is that while this state is shall issue and at this moment in time and the Cheif's of police regularly issue permits, however this can change very fast. In ""May Issue"" states Chief's issue little to no permits simply because they think people should not be able to carry in general. A police chief can deny someone the ability to protect themselves for a number of reasons whether it be about political views, race, gender, sexual orientation,(all of this is illegal to do) or simply because the chief is anti-gun while getting away with all of it. They can and have denied people who have no similarities to your example of someone in which the benevolent Chief would deny a permit to. One can appeal a denial however, provided you can, hire a lawyer (if you could afford one), take out a day of work(if you can afford that too), and have ""solid evidence"" to prove your case. No one is really sure how many times this happens currently but there was one recent  example that was made very public in Keene.   I also like that he looks at Billy MacDrinksalot and says: ""Now Billy here, we've been called out to his house any number of times for fights with his girlfriend of the moment, parties that got out of control, and we've had to pull him out of fights at the local watering hole. On top of that he's working on his third DUI, and he just got fired from his third job in the last ten months. So, Billy... we're going to say NO.""   Two things here. First is that if he hasn't broken any laws, isn't a felon, doesn't have criminal record, and can legally own and posses a gun in the first place, he has every right to get a permit. I don't care if he makes an ass of himself and the chief of police has no place to do ""minority report"" based judgement on said person. There was the case in Keene where a man was denied a concealed carry permit with no legal precedent that would prevent him from owning or possessing a firearm. It was well known that it police Chief did not like him as he was an active critic and protester of the local police. He might have been an ass but he still has a right to own firearms and Conceal carry.   This isn't Deadwood, as much as people like to think that we Americans are still living the life of the Mountain Men, or Cowboys on the range, we're past that now.

We're evolving away from the rugged individualist phase, and growing into the phase of working together to achieve even more.   I don't think this has anything to do with people wanting to be a ""rugged individualist"" at all. People wish to defend themselves and have the ability to conceal carry. The police will not be there to protect you even in ""this day and age"" and have the ability to prevent your natural right to self defense due their personal ideologies?    I will always like to shoot, even if I don't hunt anymore. So relax, I'm not out to ""come get yer guns!"" I just believe that, in this day and age, you should have to get someones permission to go all ""cocked and locked"" around my nieces and nephews at the mall.   Last point I want to make to you is that you do realize other states have had Constitutional carry and there are bad characters shooting up bars in a drunken rage that ""may have been prevented"" if Constitutional carry was not legal. Vermont has had it in place since the creation of the state itself and they are the safest state in the nation. Also what if that ""someones permission"" included your right to bear arms in general?"

I personally think if open carry is legal, concealed should definitely be, since open carry may be viewed as confrontational or aggressive.

I'm going to mix together a scenario I witnessed about 15 years ago when I lived in West Virginia, and add in my previous character ""Billy MacDrinksalot.""    Scene: Concealed carry has recently been approved.  Department store Customer Service Desk the day after the Superbowl. Billy MacDrinksalot appears at my CS Desk with the 58"" LCD HD TV that he bought two days before the game.  He wants to return it for a full refund because it was ""broke right out of the box.""  Oddly enough, the box and packaging show no signs of damage.  Now, Billy and I are both from Pleasantville, we went to HS together.  I know him personally, by reputation, and have on occasion, witnessed his shenanigans.  I also know that he has a real problem with being told ""no"" and that he doesn't make the best decisions when he gets frustrated.  Lastly, I know that he owns several handguns, because he bought a couple of them from my store.    So I pull the TV out of the box, with Billy barking at me that I don't need to check that, and saying ""What, are you calling me a liar?""  Now, I'm looking at a TV that is indeed broken, the screen is smashed, right in the center.  And right there, in front of God and everybody is a bootprint on the screen.    It's bad enough that I've got to deal with a guy with a bad temper who's trying to screw me out of a $600.00 TV, without the Statehouse telling him it's okay to go around packing heat in a shoulder rig so no-one knows.  And he's the kind of guy that if you tell him it's okay, will go armed all the time. So there's at least a 60% chance that the angry man in front of me, trying to rip me off, is both half in the bag and armed. A lot of people with bad decision making skills own guns, and if you're honest, you'll accept that point.  That's another reason why I want the Chief to sign off on them carrying concealed.  In the real life version of that story, Billy was not armed (permit for concealed carry was req'd.), but he did assault the CS clerk and subsequently spent a few months in the County Jail."
newhampshire,34cnrx,dave603,4,Thu Apr 30 23:30:04 2015 UTC,"So what's the difference between that situation and him open carrying? Not much other than the gun being visible, and the likelihood of it happening (not very high at all) is the same.  I open carry from time to time, but if I don't have a license to conceal it, and my shirt falls over the gun, all of a sudden I can be fined a thousand bucks and go to jail for a year. Fuck that noise. I'm a responsible gun owner, but I'd rather not have to put myself on a list to excercise my rights."

Think about places like Detroit - crime ridden and can't afford police due to low city tax revenues. Police call response times can be upwards of thirty minutes for things like SHOOTINGS.  Someone burgle your home? Probably won't see police at all, its just not a high enough priority.  I wont argue that municipal police don't generate revenue through fines (which is obvious that they do), but the simple answer is if you're not doing anything illegal you don't get fined.

The thing that separates driving from simply walking around is the license. When obtaining a license, you are signing an agreement to be tested for alcohol (breath, blood, or otherwise) at the discretion of the police. A license is a contract with the state, to uphold conduct while operating a motor vehicle.   The article claims checkpoints are a 4th amendment violation, but that hasn't panned out yet (as someone else said).   Checkpoints seem to fall into that area of it's part of the agreement with the license, but isn't explicitly stated.   tl:dr It's a more complex issue.   ed: This happened last week."
newhampshire,349vds,randomjackass,23,Wed Apr 29 14:40:20 2015 UTC,"People love bringing the 4th amendment into an issue regarding search and seizure?  Who'd have thunk it.    And since you're keen on 4th amendment jurisprudence, you should already know that being on the road in a vehicle does NOT entail completely signing away your 4th amendment rights.  You still have some.  As more and more decisions come out of the Supreme Court, we get a clearer picture of where the Court believes that line is.    While they haven't blown suspicionless checkpoints away completely, they have narrowed their latitude significantly.  IMO police are using these as general crime checkpoints (illegal per SCOTUS) based on the stats as to who is arrested for what.  They are basically a dragnet for expired license/reg and drug possession, with DUI charges few and far between.  The proof is in the (publicly available) pudding."

That's where the whole testing and self-incrimination part comes in. Some states are now adding in specific language into the license new/renewal process to say that by signing here you agree to be tested at any time.   Checkpoints are a product of the breathalyzer and other testing. The US supreme court has upheld their use a few times so far. Individual state's supreme courts have ruled against it, NH isn't one (yet?). The state courts decided the stop violated their constitutions.   For the record, I don't know if checkpoints are even helpful at all. I don't think they have statistics to back it up.   The Supreme Court may change their decision, as there is some turnover in the judges."

What's under discussion is our remaining rights, specifically when/where/how/why we can be seized without suspicion.  This has been narrowly limited by SCOTUS, so the state is actually walking a fine line on this.     For the record, I don't know if checkpoints are even helpful at all. I don't think they have statistics to back it up.   I agree.     The Supreme Court may change their decision, as there is some turnover in the judges.

Speaking less absolutely, since that time, we've had legal guidance and shifts in judicial interpretation, as well as a groundswell of 4A concerns put before the court, some of which suggest that if Sitz were reheard, today, with a slightly different set of circumstances, before some different justices, given the precedent set by Rodriguez, it is very possible that Sitz could be overturned.    Opining on the situation at hand: The guy who insisted that Dredd Scott was unconstitutional the day after the Supreme Court said it wasn't?  That guy was right, and the Supreme Court was wrong.  In matters of law, it didn't matter that the guy was right until well later.  In practical application, it didn't matter that the guy was right.  To the world at large, that guy was wrong.

NHPR is the first public radio station I have listened to regularly (only occasional, 1-off listens in NJ, PA, and VT before this), and I was fully prepared for it to live up to the left-leaning stereotype of public radio.  You can definitely hear some speakers with political leanings towards one side or the other, but overall, I've found it to be very well representative of the news in general.  I would definitely recommend NHPR."

newhampshire,340x3a,nhprdigital,16,Tue Apr 28 20:51:56 2015 UTC,"Full disclosure: I'm a sustaining member of NHPR, meaning I make monthly donations (still waiting for that tote and water bottle, dammit!).  NHPR only has two original programs that play daily: The Exchange, which is a topical news program, and Word of Mouth, which focuses on current events. Both of those programs I feel are fairly balanced in their depiction of current events. Laura Knoy, the host of The Exchange, is a very good interviewer and treats all guests fairly. She routinely has guests on her show with opposing views on a subject, and treats them fairly. It's in stark contrast to anything played on Fox News or MSNBC, where the conservative/liberal's side of the argument is heavily favored. Word of Mouth, on the other hand, focuses less on the news (though some newsworthy topics are discussed) and more on topical events that happen both in the State and otherwise. Either way, I don't feel it to be biased either, though that's just my opinion.  NPR as a whole I also feel to be fairly unbiased as well. While it's clear from listening to some of the hosts where their political ideologies lie, they do their best to present the topic in as unbiased of a way as possible. Diane Rehm, host of the unoriginally named Diane Rehm Show, is BY FAR the greatest interviewer I have ever heard. She may sound like she's millimeters away from death, but she accepts no bullshit from her guests nor from callers. I genuinely enjoy listening to her show every day.  Other NPR shows, like All Things Considered, Fresh Air, and Marketplace (though they're technically operated by American Public Media) are good quality shows as well. Definitely worth tuning into.  Plus, how can you go wrong with This American Life and Radiolab? Those two shows alone are worth listing to on their own!"

However, I don't think his political views necessarily detract from his show (This American Life, for those who may not know). And while that view may drive the overall narrative of the show, I don't believe that it (necessarily) detracts from the quality of the program.  Compare that to Fox or MSNBC, where they present a complex situation with many points of view, and put their conservative/liberal spin on it, respectively.  Again, that's just my point of view."

I mean its better than other ""news"" stations which completely make up facts to support their own agenda. But both sides tend to put their own spin on things. I think NHPR is MORE balanced than not, but I am biased as I am quite liberal. But there is a bias, as with any news you need to read between the lines.   WMUR, although occasionally unprofessional in their format, remains reliable and balanced.   And does anyone else find the World News to be completely unwatchable? Everything is panic fear and end of the world, I don't even want my kids to watch the world news, its terrible."

newhampshire,340x3a,wtfdizzy,5,Mon Apr 27 16:38:45 2015 UTC,"The slant is really not terrible, if only because the quality of the programming is not even comparable to many other news outlets (i.e. cable news, AM talk radio, internet sites like drudge and huff post).  The subjects NPR focuses on tend to be subjects liberals care about (likely because their listenership slants left).  But you will also find just about as much attention to pop culture and international news as you will politics.  I will say the reason I like NPR is because it treats its listeners like informed adults.  For example, a story I listened to yesterday on the conflict in Yemen highlighted the recent history of Yemeni politics that led to civil unrest, explaining the conflict as far more complicated than the Sunni v. Shia, Saudi v. Iran narrative I had read on the internet.  By the end of the 10 minute program, I realized how little I had known about the conflict and how little I still know, and how little anyone knows about what comes next.  That is the feeling I get when I learn something and it's what I look for when getting the news."
newhampshire,340x3a,lumberjack5500,6,Mon Apr 27 16:52:40 2015 UTC,"That's something I like about radio news programs, as compared to TV news: the medium allows for more in-depth reporting of a topic. Listening to the radio is a passive activity, in that you can be doing something else and listening to the program in the background, yet still being able to follow along with what's being said. Compared to TV, which uses visuals to make the point requiring you to pay attention, you can typically only focus on something for a few minutes before being distracted.  I also view that NPR does a better-than-average job with their reporting. But I'm certainly biased, so take that however you want."
newhampshire,340x3a,tommysmuffins,3,Mon Apr 27 18:42:19 2015 UTC,"I've found it fairly balanced, maybe very slightly left leaning."

Also it normally requires college degrees and higher from people who elect it as a career, putting them in a left leaning demographic group."

So, like the media in general, it rarely espouses any viewpoint that would offend corporate America. Ultra right wingers might call it leftist, but, let's face it, they're in a never ending contest to be more conservative then thou.   American media reflects a continuum from Moderately Conservative to Ultra Conservative. Just look at what European Conservative parties advocate and compare."

After my Grandpa died I would visit my Grandma frequently and help her with daily chores. Going to the grocery store once in July and having a woman with meth mouth and scars on her face waiting by the entrance and opening the heavy coat she was wearing to reveal a Santa Claus Christmas ornament asking if we wanted to buy it was a wake up call.

newhampshire,33np1l,DieCommieScum,4,Sun Apr 26 01:23:26 2015 UTC,If the septic doesn't pan out I'd recommend a composting toilet.   This is not your grandfathers composting toilet.

One idea is to construct a shed near the pole, let them construct a drop to it, and install the power meter there.   then run your own feed line the 1600 feet to the camp.  Warning, 1600 is a long run which will incur a significant loss. You'll likely need to run a high voltage feed to a transformer at the camp. Then run lines off the transformer.   Yeah, its not going to be cheap.  Maybe go solar with hydrogen production and a storage tank."

newhampshire,33lage,Nellisir,17,Fri Apr 24 01:28:13 2015 UTC,"I grew up in NH, spent 5 years in Florida, went back to NH, and I'm now currently living in Rhode Island.  I can say that, without a doubt, NH has been my favorite place to live.  Even in Manchester and Nashua, the violence and crime is non-existent compared to South Florida and Rhode Island.  It's a lot safer, and the people are overall more friendly.    If you're living in Nashua or Salem, it's basically just northern Mass.  If you go out West near Keene and Peterborough, you start running into more of the hippie type people, which is largely due to the school and its proximity to Vermont.  The coast is nice to visit, but it can be fairly expensive and fast paced due to the tourism.  Once you get north of Concord and into the middle of the state, things really start to slow down and get nicer.  There is a lot of open land, lakes, and mountains.  The areas can definitely get crowded during peak times, such as Weirs Beach during Bike week, locations on lakes during summer weekends, and popular mountains during ski season.  If you want some excitement during the year, but a few months in between to relax, this is the perfect place for you.  When people talk about all of the great aspects of NH, they're usually talking about the middle of the state.  Once you go north of Plymouth/Ashland, you start running into Nowhereville.  If you like lots of open land and friendly people, that's where you want to go."

newhampshire,33lage,Nellisir,22,Fri Apr 24 01:29:31 2015 UTC,"I moved here from the Midwest to the Keene area.  I used to live in a bigger city where everyone was always grumpy and sick of being around each other. It is not like that where I live now. People seem to kind of keep to themselves and aren't always nice drivers. But when you're around the people they are usually quite sincere and friendly. They'll have a genuine conversation with a stranger, joke around, etc. and you don't feel like they're being fake. I've found that the New Hampshire farmers/blue collar workers are like this moreso. In the Midwest I felt like the blue collar workers were all assholes who had to prove how tough they were.  I definitely notice a difference between drivers in NH and drivers from the other east coast states. Connecticut and Mass drivers are awful, aggressive, etc. New Hampshire drivers will tailgate you but they are not usually aggressive where I live.  People here are noticeably more honest and straightforward. To be more specific: in the Midwest, people are extremely politically correct and will lie to you in order to keep the peace. (However if they know they'll never see you again they might go off on you and be really nasty). Very passive aggressive.  Here in New Hampshire people will just straight up say things to you. In the Midwest you could mispronounce a word for your entire life and many people will not correct you, particularly strangers. Here, if you mispronounce the name of a city, someone will immediately correct you (not in a nasty way, but just not apologetically and they won't be embarrassed about it).  People out here are also much more idealistic. Everyone has something to say and are not ashamed of their beliefs. I've NEVER out here had someone say ""oh, I don't like talking about politics."" People are generally untrusting of politicians and excess laws. I have never met so many independent minded people and atheists. I didn't know any atheists in the Midwest. Out here I meet men who are 60-70 years old who are atheists, and everyone knows. In the Midwest it was something to keep secret because people wouldn't trust you if you said you were an atheist. Here, someone might say something rude about you being an atheist, but they will not ostracize you, and will treat you like a friend otherwise.  In general: people are quite genuine and outspoken about their beliefs. They won't be nasty to you about yours unless you say you're a Free Stater (and even then they will probably listen to what you have to say. In Keene people associate Free Staters with the Free Keene folk, and the Free Keeners are always causing a ruckus and annoying everyone on purpose). People are generally not nasty at all (except some of the younger, trashier types), they are just straightforward and might playfully tease you.  Mind you, these are generalizations, but I think my feedback is good for you because I personally have moved and seen a very different culture than I had ever experienced and am able to compare.  ""if not a little judgmental and snooty to non-natives"" < similar to New Hampshire people, although no one is snooty at all. Instead I'd say they're proud and slightly arrogant. At least you won't get called a flat lander since you're from Colorado :) People are very proud out here. They take the state motto seriously. I can't tell you how many people I've heard say something regarding freedom and then say, ""Live Free or Die!"" If you're coming out here with that attitude, many people will love you. And everyone talks shit about Mass transplants who move up here and vote for higher taxes. Also keep in mind that there are a lot of people who live in New Hampshire that are FROM the other New England states. Many people vacation here also, etc., so among people you meet in public, there is a high likelihood that they're not even New Hampshire natives.  Mind you, I live in the Keene area. I'm sure different cities will carry different types. Maybe you will hate the personalities, but I find the general attitude out here extremely refreshing.  **And for the person who said that the ""live free"" thing won't affect you on a day to day basis, it does affect me noticeably. Maybe not day to day, but there are a lot of things that I notice frequently that make me happy."
newhampshire,33lage,qbnv,5,Thu Apr 23 15:10:29 2015 UTC,"Is Free Keene still a thing? I share a zip code with Keene and do most of my shopping there and I have never encountered them. I was hoping after their Colbert Report appearance they'd realize exactly how ridiculous they are and maybe grow up a bit.   Edit: hey look, free Keene found me and downvoted me. You guys want to meet up and settle this over a pint?"

I just want to make clear that I dislike Free Keene not because I disagree with moving to NH to live in a free state. I dislike Free Keene because they purposely do things that are obnoxious, some of which have nothing to do with liberty and interfere with others' lives."
newhampshire,33lage,qbnv,9,Thu Apr 23 17:42:24 2015 UTC,"There's really no consensus here, and that's partly due to politics. Some people move here because it's not too far from where they were, and they figure they can save on income tax. The problem is they don't realize that when they vote for all the programs they had in their previous state that it creates more expense, and requires more tax. It seems like there are two type; those who realize that these differences are reliant on the fewer programs and smaller expense, and those who don't."
newhampshire,33lage,snit8y,-1,Thu Apr 23 17:25:30 2015 UTC,This is something I hear quite a bit but don't understand as I'm relatively new to the state myself.  Which programs has NH adopted that has made it more expensive?  Honest question.

As far as I can tell, the tax situation in NH has been in place for a very long time, so I'm not interested in what offsets what.    I'm curious about the argument that transplants coming from MA want all their government niceties, and now we have to raise taxes for it.  I'm just not sure which govt programs are new and are driving up taxes."
newhampshire,33lage,cujo,5,Thu Apr 23 18:38:32 2015 UTC,Any. It's really the concept I was speaking to. Regardless of the program if you want to add something it comes with a cost. When people move in to take advantage of the lower costs and there's a disconnect about why those costs are lower.. Some come in and endorse every damn thing they always have.
newhampshire,33lage,snit8y,-1,Thu Apr 23 17:56:26 2015 UTC,"I get the idea that stuff costs money.  But people are constantly going on about how we can't afford all this ""new stuff"", but I haven't been here long enough to see any ""new stuff"".  What is the ""new stuff""?"
newhampshire,33lage,cujo,2,Thu Apr 23 18:33:24 2015 UTC,"""New stuff"" is anything that wasn't here when you arrived that's now being proposed. It has nothing to do with being able to afford it. It has to do with the current state of NH & why one would choose to move here, vs the current state of say MA, aka ""Taxachusetts"". The reason why people who jump the border to save on income tax are often referred to as ""Massholes"" is because they have no regard for how NH is, or was. This differentiates them from those of us who like it the way it is & understand the implications of expanding. They have no appreciation for the effect of their political practices.  Personally, if you like the idea of X & it doesn't currently exist in NH, I'd much rather you consider VT, or ME, or MA, or any other NE state, that already has it. If however you like the lack of X and the way things are in NH, then it makes a lot more sense for you to move here."
newhampshire,33lage,snit8y,14,Thu Apr 23 18:49:35 2015 UTC,"NH native & resident for 36 years, currently in upstate NY.  Oh god do I want to go home.  Let's do bullet points.   You can talk about policies all you want.  Just...don't talk about politics. No one goes around saying ""I'm a Libertarian!"" unless they're from out of state and want to make a big deal of it. Then it's rude and annoying. We're not unfriendly, just laconic. And keeping a straight face/not showing emotion is a virtue. We don't make big deals out of anything. Mind your own business. Seriously. Wave at everyone. Honestly, if you don't wave at Ms Perkins, she's not going to talk to you for five years, and that's just awkward. I don't know about ""dissonance between residents"". Some people are Republicans, some people are Democrats, just like everywhere else. The recent leftward swing of the state is, IMO, largely fueled by social values - specifically the desire to keep the national Republican committee the hell out of our business. Church. Not a big thing. The ""traditional"", if there is such a thing, faith in NH is Congregationalist, in which each church is responsible for itself. See a theme? Your faith is your business. Your sexual preferences are your business. Your birth control is your business. If you want to ride a motorcycle and not wear a helmet and splatter your brains on the sidewalk, that's your business. But there's also a sense of responsibility to the greater community; of helping others. That's cool. Don't be an idiot. The Presidential Range and Mt Washington are short little foothills by CO standards, with fantastically bad weather. If you're big on outdoorsy stuff, realize that lots of very smart people DIE regularly up there. We will bill you for that. I was amazed, when I moved to NY, at how underhanded and duplicitous the politics were here. I'm coming to realize that politics in NH are just really civilized. Also, on a strictly personal note, I'm amazed at how much people mow and manicure their property here in upstate NY. There's a very different aesthetic in NH, basically summed up as ""if you're not using it, don't bother"". Lots of people move into NH. You're not alone."
newhampshire,33lage,Nellisir,4,Thu Apr 23 18:34:56 2015 UTC,"Also: NH doesn't have sales or income tax, so a lot of stuff runs off of property tax. People in NH complain about property taxes a lot.  BUT... my property taxes here in NY are the same as they were in NH, for a property with half the value. Plus I'm paying sales & income tax."
newhampshire,33lage,Nellisir,3,Fri Apr 24 01:36:48 2015 UTC,It's more comprehensive to just go by the overall tax burden.  NH has one of the lowest.
newhampshire,33lage,ChopperIndacar,3,Fri Apr 24 14:17:57 2015 UTC,Good point. I usually go by how much screaming my wife does when she has to pay the tax bill.

But then I also got that impression from my visits to PA (nowhere near Philly).    I'd pick NH over MI or CO.  Politically it's what you're looking for, and we have one of the highest ratios of representatives to citizens in the country.    Also if you're looking to open your own shop, the used market for machinery here is out of control.  It's awesome."

newhampshire,33lage,cujo,7,Thu Apr 23 14:17:17 2015 UTC,"True.  That's why I like hearing about transplants that would help offset the effect of MA transplants.

newhampshire,33lage,ChopperIndacar,5,Thu Apr 23 14:33:02 2015 UTC,"Get out of the Southeastern part of the state and the number of MA transplants takes a nosedive.  If you're in it for the natural beauty of the place, you'll probably want to avoid that area of the state anyway. Despite the hate that tend to get on this sub, Cheshire and Sullivan counties are pretty awesome places."
newhampshire,33lage,nagi2000,5,Thu Apr 23 16:39:19 2015 UTC,"most of the ""live free"" stuff is just token BS.   Maybe, but there are 49 states in the union for which ""not wearing a seat belt"" is either a primary or secondary offense, and New Hampshire isn't one of them.   There are 13 states which require some form of a ""necessary and proper"", or ""good and substantial reason"" clause for the issuance of a concealed carry permit, and New Hampshire isn't one of them.   There are no mandatory ""court costs"", freaky sodomy laws, and New Hampshire was early to the party on same sex marriages.   I could keep going, but without trying to bore anyone with any of the ""x reasons why you should move to New Hampshire"" lists, New Hampshire gets a lot more right than most states, IMO."
newhampshire,33lage,issue9mm,4,Fri Apr 24 00:26:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for the replies everyone. It seems like there's a lot of dissonance between residents of New Hampshire on the political climate of the state. Would anyone speak to that?
newhampshire,33lage,5arge,16,Thu Apr 23 17:01:02 2015 UTC,"In my opinion you are pushing the political angle too much. That is not a NE thing to do. Keeping your religion and politics to yourself is the most respectable trait of us hardy New Englanders. I would suggest you learn it before you move here. Libertarians here don't advertise that they are libertarian, they just vote libertarian and then shut up about it."
newhampshire,33lage,5arge,-2,Thu Apr 23 17:09:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not pushing a political angle at all. Did I, even once, try to sell anyone on a political standpoint? I didn't. I just said what I believed politically and am asking what others in NH believe politically; this is a simple inquiry. I'm not arguing any politics by trying to understand people's political opinions on things; that's just part of due diligence and research.  If asking innocuous questions about people's opinions on factual topics is largely perceived as pushing an angle, or being ""pushy,"" that would be cause for concern."

This is a public forum designed for informational purposes about a geographical body (specifically the narrow section of land located in Northeastern US and the touching the Western border of Maine) and related details.  You're acting like I came up and asked this question to you on the street. Yours is an unsuitable attitude for someone posting in a Sub Reddit, and what I do and how I demonstrate my curiosity over Reddit is my business, not yours.

It's not often you get to talk to someone who just says what they think. Out here in the west we are too politically correct to do that, so you see when someone says something they often actually mean something else and it wastes time trying to figure out what they mean.  Strangely enough your confrontational attitude telling me to stay away just makes me like NH more.

The overlap in those Venn diagrams has some very different opinions than NH as a whole.  In my day to day life (completely anecdotal) the types of people I meet are mostly conservative/libertarian.  There's a very big ""government can't take my rights"" kind of attitude, much like the south.  Except unlike the south we're also (generally, in my experience) against all the welfare/handouts from the government."

newhampshire,33lage,ChopperIndacar,4,Thu Apr 23 16:26:00 2015 UTC,"Also 25 and moved here over a year ago from DC, originally from CT. I somehow stumbled upon this thread and it's awesome, so now I have to offer my 2 cents. I spent some summers here as a kid & I have some old friends scattered between Conway and Nashua, but I mostly got traction here on my own, getting to know coworkers, bar patrons, etc.. Spent a year in Concord and now i'm in seacoast, I don't plan on leaving.  Things I notice about the folk: not as well-versed in small talk like they are down south, but always ready to talk about similar interests; people value what they have, and people love their hobbies. The self reliant culture, minimalist & local gov'ts, geography, climate are the source for a lot of sincere pride. More people seem to have the attitude that they chose to live & stay in NH and can leave if they want to; few are tied to metropolitan sprawl convenience. Likewise, nobody looks at me funny for moving here at 25, they just seem to assume that I'm here because I want to be and are pretty happy to hear it. Everyone does indeed keep to themselves pretty well, but you won't get cold shouldered at your local watering hole if you're a new guy, just ask them how they heat their house for a conversation. I really have found most people to be pleasant and interested in becoming friends, though it's an uphill battle being a single guy here.  I also love to point out the built environment.. In addition to the wicked lax zoning regulations (for better or for worse), you'll never find a layering of old and new and super-old construction like we have up here. Everything from the salt-box houses to the tiny main street towns to the 300 year-old roads are tucked away everywhere you go. Lots of walkable towns.. I can walk to the bar or walk to the fishing hole. The infrastructure out west & the south is very different.  The whole liberty thing was a big plus for me coming here, and now that i am here I don't have to talk about it anymore, which I like. The state motto does all the talking, everyone else just lives like they want to."
newhampshire,33lage,StudentII,6,Sat Apr 25 04:36:08 2015 UTC,"I don't live in NH anymore, but I do have a perspective that might be helpful for you. I grew up in New England (Connecticut) but have lived most of my adult life out west (Colorado and Utah).  My husband and I always figured we'd end up back in New England at some point. After about 10 years in Utah, I felt a pull to be back east again, and got a job in NH. I'm really familiar with the state--both sets of grandparents lived there, and several of my cousins are still there.  I mean no offense to those of you in/from NH with what I'm about to say. I did make very good friends there. I love the landscape. Dealing with individuals was usually very pleasant. That said ... I found a level of negativity in New England that I was no longer equipped to deal with. And no, it wasn't as bad in NH as in CT or MA, but it was still there. When people got together in groups, it seemed like the primary way to break the ice was by complaining. Trading stories about assholes. Finding common enemies. Bitching about politics. And so on.  It wore on me. I'm generally a very positive person, and I found myself more and more being pulled into a negative mindset and being likely to find fault instead of anything positive to say. More quick to anger. I saw it in myself and my husband ... and we made the decision to get out. We were there for four years.  We're back in Utah now--and even though Utah is known to be a pretty uptight state, I think it's safe to say that, in general, westerners are more laid back and positive than east coasters.   And yes, I KNOW this is a massive generalization ... but in my experience, it has been overall accurate. So I wanted to put it out there."
newhampshire,33lage,joshuatilton,7,Thu Apr 23 22:19:35 2015 UTC,"I've heard similarly negative things about the East Coast from others. Some extended family relatives I have are from Pennsylvania and they act like nothing you say could possibly be worth their time, and are so stubborn--they can't see things from any different point of view other than their own, and I HATE THAT attitude in life more than almost any other attitude someone can have.   I can only judge based on your writing tone in this thread, but it sounds like you're the type of guy who likes to discuss and debate ideas.   There will be people in NH who are receptive to that, but far less than in other areas.   Most native NH people really aren't too keen on Libertarian talk. We know New Hampshire is libertarian and we're a bit more about minding our own business than the average American but I think many NH natives find it distasteful to openly discuss or label it thus.  That being said, the regions of NH are all somewhat diverse, and I'm speaking from a Southern/Seacoast perspective. If you tried to talk to the average Brooker (Seabrook, NH) about Libertarianism or the Free State Project at best you can expect a reply of ""what are you, fuckin' smart or something?"" most of the time.   It's a bit hard to generalize and verbalize the average mentality but I would caution against mentioning anything about being a libertarian as a newcomer here. You have to understand we get somewhat flooded (by small state standards) with young people moving to NH wanted to make a libertarian utopia out of a place that was already ideal for most of us. The stunts these guys occasionally pull in Keene and the dumb videos they put up harassing cops over irrelevant shit rub a lot of people the wrong way.  As to what I quoted from you, I think you will get the impression that a lot of people are acting like what you say isn't worth their time, and they don't care to seek different views - especially with a transplant. It's partially just the general behavior here. As another guy said ITT, NH locals are pretty laconic and it can come off aggressive to people who aren't used to it I guess.  Anyways, I don't want to discourage you or anything, but I just get the impression NH probably isn't exactly like you imagine it to be. It's not really some bastion of deep political thought and discussion. Most people just want to go to work, drink beer, go on a hike or visit the lake once in awhile and talk shit about massholes."

I'll tell you this, I get on the bus at the Westminster PnR and they have a big board that details the history of Westminster. It use to be the worlds largest Apple Orchard. Today nothing remains of that.  I say this with tremendous pride, but that would NOT happen in NH. We would never level an aspect of our history just for development reasons.

It was pretty impolite to make fun of that guy for his spelling of ""nosie"" in such a snarky manner.  And how you described yourself as ""just direct"" that's how New Jerseyians will describe themselves as well.  Just look at the governor.

newhampshire,33lage,madeInNY,5,Fri Apr 24 03:43:07 2015 UTC,"Idahoan here. Been in New England for 6 years, 5~ of them in NH.  First off, you have to know that southern NH (where I live) is full of MA refugees.  Compare it to Colorado having an influx of Californians.  All those MA folks bringing their ideas with them isn't really welcome since they come from a nanny state which is directly counter to the ethos of NH.  In general I find NH folks to be pretty friendly, and I like living here but there are a few things I would point out:   People in New England live in their own little universe. It's worse in MA, but in general people have little to no concept of how different the rest of the country is.  Not only that, there's no desire to know anything else. Florida is about as far as they go. Property taxes, especially in southern NH, are very high Things are more formal here. Working at an ad agency on the west coast = flip flops, T-shirt, shorts. East coast ad agency = slacks, dress shirt, sweater In general I found outdoor activities to be more easily accessible on the west coast (hiking trails, etc). It might just be where I lived though The food is subpar.  Back on the west coast I can think of so many little places that had good cheap food. In general it's much more expensive to eat out and I don't think the quality is as good. I don't think it's impossible to get to know people here, but they kind of put you on the back burner until they figure out you're sticking around, then you might get to know them. Even though NH is the land of 'live free or die', there are still prevailing NE attitudes.  I've been looking for a free shooting range and in Idaho / Washington I'd just go out on BLM land.  Here it's much more difficult to find a place to go since so much of the land is privately owned or state-owned and off limits to shooting (unless you are hunting) and people will call the cops. Every state in New England thinks the next state over is full of hicks.  MA folks think NH is full of toothless rednecks, NHers think ME is full of hairy hippies, and all of them wonder just what the heck is going on in VT. Driving here is terrible   It can be tough to adjust to living here, especially if you're a west-coaster but out of all the states in New England, NH is (IMO) the best state to live in. You can still make good money being close to MA, but live without all the stupid restrictions and handholding.  The weird thing is that you have to adopt a certain mindset to live here, and after doing so you feel out of place both here and back west.  I don't mean for this to all sound negative, NH has a lot of positives too (hiking, camping, scenery, great roads for cycling) but hopefully this answers your questions a little."

My wife's family are all from NH. I grew up in a great town in MA just south of the NH border and did not realize how much I disliked MA (as a state) until I moved. The diff between MA government and NH government is quite big however, as someone pointed out, the influx of MA people over the last 10 years is starting to ruin NH politics with the entitlement people from MA. Everyone has covered how people behave pretty well but my one suggestion would be to stay out of the route 3 belt.  IMO Nashua has gone downhill in the last 10 years and Manchester is about the same. The drug issue has really gotten bad in both cities so crime is on the increase in those areas.  I am friends with a few police officers and they say it's worse than ever. If you decide to move, I'd suggest to live to the east or west of either city. Once you are north of Manchester/Concord it really does not matter since it's much less populated up there."

Pretty pricey but righty by the highway and awesome amenities about a 5 min drive to the mall and about 30 seconds from anything on DW highway. Still a little bit under construction but very nice inside. And not to be racist but royal crest has about a 70% Indian population and quiet frankly it always smells like curry. So take that for what it is but Tara heights is beautiful and it's pretty affordable from what I hear.

I don't recall any laundry in the unit he was in, I seem to recall there were laundry facilities in the basement but I'm not sure.  It was so long ago that I'm not sure it's helpful but back then it was okay.  The nice part about there is the access to route 3/Everett Turnpike.  The bad part about there is having all of the traffic on/to/from route 3/Everett Tpke, lol!  It will take you a bit of driving to get to Hollis from there, though.  On a map it probably doesn't look very far but the drive time takes a bit due to the traffic volumes/light/rotaries etc."

I would recommend looking at Tara Heights or the clocktower place mills in Nashua. Both of them are fairly new and I was impressed with them when I toured. Ultimately for $1,500 you should be able to afford any apartments in the area. Also a benefit of the clocktower place mills are that they are right in downtown Nashua so if you go out for drinks you won't have a long drive/walk."

newhampshire,33hztu,teefour,22,Wed Apr 22 20:13:23 2015 UTC,"Heroin use usually stems from an addiction to opioid pain medications and there has been a crack-down in recent years on pill abuse and the institutions that allowed it to flourish. But those who are already addicted are still looking to get the dosage their body now needs and the pills are more expensive on the street and harder to come by.  When there are no pills to be found and withdrawal starts, many tell themselves I'll just use heroin once, to get back to ""normal"".   Once you've made that leap to trying heroin once, it's easier and easier to keep going back to it, never mind that it's cheaper and easier to get.  Granted, there probably is the odd dumbass who tries it just for funsies."
newhampshire,33hztu,PowPowPowerCrystal,8,Wed Apr 22 21:00:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah. If you wanna hear a good progression of how addiction works, listen to Harris Wittels's episode of You Made it Weird with Pete Holmes.

Remember last year when there were a bunch of news reports about horribly dangerous, tainted heroin making its way around? Well call me a tin-foil hatter, but I'd bet my left nut those were disseminated by pharmaceuticals seeing themselves lose market share to heroin.  People always hate on big pharma for releasing extremely expensive drugs. As a chemist, I balk at most of those complaints, because I know first hand just how expensive some of the stuff I make is at manufacturing cost, never mind adding in R&D and legal overhead. I prefer to hate on big pharma for pushing drugs on people that don't really need them, and downplaying their drugs' connection to things like mass shootings.  And as an aside, in high school there actually were a shit ton of kids who started doing heroin just for funsies. It happened shortly after the Massachusetts state police busted the main weed source for the region, and my town became mostly dry. Good job, guys."
newhampshire,33hztu,teefour,10,Thu Apr 23 00:23:24 2015 UTC,"I tried it once. Never again since. Here's what happened: I was in a band, and our drummer was an alcoholic. He then discovered prescription pain pills and fell in love. After going broke from buying pain pills, he realized that they were not working as much anymore either so he made the obvious choice....heroin. It's cheaper and more powerful than the prescription stuff. After missing band practices, and being a no show for 2 gigs in a row, it came down to me to level with him and tell him he isn't in the band anymore. So there we were, sitting in his car in some random industrial park around the corner from where I was living. We had this heart ot heart about how he knew heroin was killing him, and he knew it was his fault that he got kicked out of the band, and then he sprung this one on me, ""dude this is the last bag of heroin I will ever buy, please do some of it with me so I can get rid of it once and for all"". He snorted most of it, and gave me a little ""bump"". It was gross, I felt awful and dirty. There was no euphoria, just shame. I never saw him again... nor have I ever touched an opiate since, not even pain pills. Also, ever since as a rule, I don't associate with people who use heroin because it changes them deep down, they are not the same person you knew before the dope."

Police reported that heroin was being cut with the same stuff they give you when you get open heart surgery to slow your heart rate down. So people on normal heroin addictions are doing the same amount but they are overdosing and they are unresponsive to the methods to counter the drug.

People who OD and are addicts are usually the dregs of society yes, but people can come out of that, they can crawl their way out of hole's, they can fight for their own happiness. Sometimes, it does take a syringe full of Narcan to make you wake up and try to fix yourself before you truly become dead to society.  I hope Narcan stays legal because people who OD can bring life and excitement to our society.   Here are a few people who have OD'd  Chris Farley  Philip Seymour Hoffman  John Belushi  Mitch Hedburg  Anna Nicole Smith  Jimi Hendrix  Amy Winehouse  Janis Joplin  Corey Monteith   Billie Fucking Mayes   Ect.

newhampshire,33hztu,zdiggler,7,Wed Apr 22 21:46:21 2015 UTC,"Do yourself a favor... research how many times each of these folks ODed (or went to rehab) before they finally bought the farm. Also, your list contains a number of people who died from ""speed-balling"" which is using cocaine to get up, and then using heroin to come down. They were not just abusing heroin. They were abusing all kinds of garbage. All of the names on your list have left their mark, I love Farley and Hoffman. I thought Mitch Hedburg was a fucking genius of comedy, my style of comedy too. Anna Nicole had a huge heart, and was gorgeous for a time. Jimi, come on, he changed things. I could go on, but the point is, these people CHOSE to go out the way they did. You CHOOSE to put a drug inside yourself that we have all been raised to fear. Sure I miss these people, but I also blame THEM for their untimely deaths. It wasn't heroin, it wasn't the lack of Narcan, it was their own choices that killed them.   Let me put it to you this way: Do you think that people nowadays are less afraid of ODing because they know that the cops and the paramedics have Narcan and can save them? I do. My neighbor is an ER nurse, and has revived numerous junkies right here in Manchester with Narcan. They know it is out there, so they ARE less afraid of ODing. So...why avoid heroin? Why seek counseling? Just do your thing and the paramedics will save you if you go too far."
newhampshire,33hztu,5arge,2,Wed Apr 22 21:57:07 2015 UTC,"You are right about some of those actors yes. Whole mess of other shit fucked them up. I was just doing it off the top of my head.  You are right, it was their own choices that killed them ultimately. I think you and I are just seeing Narcan differently. I think you believe that the majority of those saved by Narcan see it as a net to save them so they can continue their addiction. I see it as more of a second chance at life, a second chance to try and get things together.  Sooo.... we could argue back and forth.   or we could just go back to enjoying reddit and part ways as mature adults?       Edit: Also, glad to see another Mitch fan out there!"
newhampshire,33hztu,zdiggler,5,Wed Apr 22 22:20:14 2015 UTC,"You got my point, I understand yours. No need to argue, no hard feelings, we are just presenting two sides of a tough issue."
newhampshire,33hztu,5arge,3,Wed Apr 22 22:24:14 2015 UTC,I think they should give that stuff out for free.. could have saved a lot of people.
newhampshire,33hztu,zdiggler,-4,Wed Apr 22 22:37:05 2015 UTC,Why not give heroin out for free also?
newhampshire,33hztu,vmont,6,Wed Apr 22 22:39:18 2015 UTC,"What if somebody close to you OD and you could have saved by narcan?   Someone who's going to do drug is gonna do drugs.  There is little you can do about it to prevent them from doing so.  No matter what, there be drug users and there will be person who OD.  NO MATTER WHAT!  Law, punishment, whatever, they'll still find the way.  If no access to they'll find some different shit to get high on.   Its still human life and all we can do is what we can do save a life however we can.  Still somebody love ones."

newhampshire,33jfog,qbnv,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:42:39 2015 UTC,"What about permethrin? It kills ticks on contact. You can't put it on your skin. You spray your clothes thoroughly, let them dry, and then that stuff lasts through a few washes. You can also get permethrin in lawn spray and in these little things called ""tick tubes."" I have the tick tubes in my lawn but am not sure how effective they actually are. They are stuffed with cotton. The tubes are supposedly effective because mice will take the cotton for their nests, and the permethrin in the cotton will kill all of the immature ticks that are feeding on the mice."

newhampshire,33ivk9,throwawayNewH,14,Wed Apr 22 22:29:54 2015 UTC,"It's winter conditions up there still, you'll need micro-spikes at least, possibly crampons and an ice-axe. I wouldn't bring a dog in these conditions, and it is incredibly unsafe to hike alone, above treeline, in the winter.  TLDR: If you are asking these questions, you are not prepared for this season.   Also, congrats on having the good sense to ask these questions! So, so many people do not."
newhampshire,33ivk9,PowPowPowerCrystal,4,Thu Apr 23 01:20:29 2015 UTC,Whats your level of experience with hiking? What equipment do you have? Lets start there.
newhampshire,33ivk9,laivindil,-1,Wed Apr 22 23:51:39 2015 UTC,"It has been a while but I do have some experience the last place I went back packing was the Adirondacks but it has been several years.  I have a nice pair of Gortex hiking boots, convertible pants,  moisture wicking shirts both long and short sleve and a waterproof shell both top and bottom."
newhampshire,33ivk9,laivindil,8,Thu Apr 23 00:25:33 2015 UTC,"There is still snow up there. Its packed, but you are going to want spikes or something similar. Its cold and its windy. Your going to want some insulating layers, warm hat, gloves.   Treking poles, sunglasses, face mask/balaclava, headlamp, and extra socks (there is a lot of melt, you can break through ice/snow/mud and soak your boots) would all be very smart to carry.  This is tuckermans skiing season, this is not spring hiking on cleared trails season.  https://www.mountwashington.org/experience-the-weather/current-summit-conditions.aspx  In short, if you don't have winter hiking experience on smaller stuff. I wouldn't recommend doing this. Its certainly doable, but you need to look into what your going to be getting. I highly recommend checking Mt Washingtons weather/trail reports and cams."
newhampshire,33ivk9,counterfitfake,3,Thu Apr 23 00:52:59 2015 UTC,It sounds like you probably haven't done a lot of hiking in the whites. If you are just starting I would highly recommend starting with something else! There are many amazing hikes in NH that are far less risky for this time of year. Work your way up to Washington so that when you try it you will know how to be prepared.   If you really want a challenge you could try Mt liberty. It's physically demanding but protected from the weather 95 percent of the way and has a really cool summit with great views. I would recommend microspikes and waterproof hiking boots this time of year as there will be melting snowpack still! Also make sure you have a couple really warm layers and a waterproof shell regardless of the predicted weather. Don't wear any cotton. Tell someone where you are going. Have a great time and don't think twice about turning back for any reason.
newhampshire,33ivk9,counterfitfake,-1,Wed Apr 22 23:58:02 2015 UTC,"It has been a while but I do have some backpacking experience, but never in the whites, the last place I went back packing was the Adirondacks but it has been several years and it was late summer.  I have a nice pair of Gortex hiking boots, convertible pants,  moisture wicking shirts both long and short sleeve and a waterproof shell both top and bottom.  Suggesting that I need spikes pretty much puts a halt on my idea, I'm not really interested in having to deal with that much snow/ice on a hike yet."
newhampshire,33ivk9,PigBoyOhBoy,3,Thu Apr 23 00:28:39 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend micro spikes. They aren't crampons, and are closer to tire chains for your boots. I think they cost about $45.  The next month or so will be snowy, slushy or muddy depending on elevation and slope direction (North or south). Even after that be extremely cautions on Washington and check the higher summits forecast online the morning of your trip but know it could change dramatically at any time.   See you out there!"
newhampshire,33ivk9,nhwoodsblues,3,Thu Apr 23 00:49:22 2015 UTC,Here is a recent trail report to consider. People are still skiing up there.
newhampshire,33ivk9,SecondHandSmaug,2,Thu Apr 23 00:26:54 2015 UTC,"You'll want to have full blown winter gear packed. It it still winter up there with deep (packed) snow and potential for bitter cold with rugged winds...depends on the day and time of day. Traction, lots of layers...etc are needed. Cannon is a less aggressive hike with shit at the top and really cool views. There's a sweet viewing deck that's gives a mint view of Franconia ridge."
newhampshire,33ivk9,jello_zoo,2,Fri Apr 24 01:23:55 2015 UTC,"Climb Chocorua instead.  Park at the Piper Trail head lot.  Do Piper to Nickerson ledge to 3 Sisters, summit, then come down the opposite ridge via Liberty to Weetamoo, and it connects you to Piper at the end.  It's about as physically difficult as Washington, but without the feet of snow and general weather.  There is still some snow up there, and the river crossing on the Weetamoo is pretty intense, but I did it last week and it was nothing but fun."

There will be many farmers markets in candia/deerfield.(seasonal) Those ones are really great. Literally buying food from someones farm. Forgot about this place. Not a farmers market, but they do have organic foods There are some community events, but it's mostly food and clothing banks. About once a month they have an actual event. (model train show, strawyberry festival). To be put bluntly it's rather dull. Hope this helps. If you are looking for a gym Anytime Fitness is great and I'm close to the manager.

I don't know about farmers markets in Hooksett, but I know that there's a plaza with a meat shop and a pretty good craft beer store close to the border with Manchester on DW Highway if you're into that sort of thing. There's also a farmer's market in Manchester every Thursday I wanna say, but it probably wouldn't compare to the ones mentioned above in Candia or Deerfield."

But what was that article I just read?  She had 3 years experience only. She didn't understand what a weather forecast was, nor had experience with the route she was taking during a dangerous time of year. She didn't bring anywhere near the gear she should have. She was not adventuresome, she was bold and impetuous and once she left the safety of urban stupidity and went into the real world, she died.  We should not be using her memory as inspiration, but safety.  You know how many other people attempted to climb that day? Zero.  Only one person in all of NH decided the worst day of the year was not that bad. Only one person in all of NH decided they only needed half the gear they should have.  There is so much insanity in this, we should not neglect to learn something from this insanity. I think your first impression was closer to the truth than your change of heart."

Obviously she didn't learn anything from her ""mountaineering"" experience.  I find it hard to believe, if any of the top mountaineers in the world were given the opportunity, that they would have chosen a recreational trip above tree line at -20 F., in 100 mph winds.  I understand why people seem to like to put a coat of varnish on the meaningless death of an impressive young woman, but I don't think it really does anyone any good."

I think it's obvious that, even at the time, the decision to attempt this was foolhardy. It's a damned difficult trek in the best of conditions, and this was the exact opposite.   But it seems clear to me that she was a smart, typically well-prepared person with a huge sense of adventure. She just fell short on a few really, really key attributes (too confident, not prepared well enough, and didn't make the right decisions until it was too late) that cost her her life. A really sad story really: people can make dumber decisions and be less prepared but still come out of it alive."

newhampshire,335zpl,Searchlights,7,Mon Apr 20 12:04:34 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they still have a cruiser on the ground to go in for the kill.  Which you can see if you use an app like Waze.  It's not foolproof but it'll give you a sporting chance - if the ground patrol is flagged on Waze it's a good day to go slow.  It beats following the speed limit every day for sure.    Live free or die.
newhampshire,335zpl,ChopperIndacar,3,Mon Apr 20 15:02:50 2015 UTC,"That's been going on forever. They even have these horizontal white lines that are painted near the left breakdown lanes. They'll time how long it takes you to go from line-to-line, and from that it's just simple math to find out your exact speed. They use the same method on the pit road in Nascar.. I'm not sure how fast you like going, but I've never had a problem doing 80 between Nashua/Manchester, which you'd think would be the biggest problem area. And now that the speed limit north of Concord is 70, it's not illegal to go that fast either."
newhampshire,335zpl,iwas-saying-boo-urns,2,Tue Apr 21 00:28:24 2015 UTC,I frequently see 'speed monitored by aircraft' signs and groups of cruisers on 95.

I think speeding tickets are BS but I'll gladly drive at or under the speed limit because my car is too janky to go too fast & I just don't want to deal with getting pulled over and the possible ticket.    I've seen troopers parked on all different parts of 93, so I can't even figure out where the hot spots are.  I think at the tolls is a popular spot, since they can just wait for people to run through without paying.    But eh... drones... I wish I could be more helpful.

He had it advertised at around 13000, but when I got there and tried to offer less he claimed that the car was mis-advertised and that it was actually around 15000. I still said that I was firm in my price and that it was his fault for not putting the right price on the Internet. He had the car aligned for me, and I walked out of there with putting around 1800 down and loan just around 11000. It was a 2012 with only 11000 miles and I bought it a year ago. They offer financing through two banks, St Mary's (which has a lower interest rate) and Bellwether Comm Credit Union (interest at 3.25)."
newhampshire,333lfi,slyfox4,3,Sun Apr 19 14:04:03 2015 UTC,"With any car dealership, the payments they advertise are just examples. Terms of your loan that effect payment are the amount borrowed, term, and interest rate.  Use a payment estimator after getting a rate quote on sites like bankrate.com   Newer cars will often be advertised with 72 or even 84 month terms, which means you would be paying off the car over a 6-7 year period. This results in paying a substantial amount more in interest unless you pay it off early. If you try to trade it in or sell it at some point during that loan, unless you made a very large down payment you'll likely find you are completely buried in it. (industry term for a loan principal substantially higher than the cars cash value)  Used cars several years old likely won't be able to be financed for terms over 60 or 72 months as the banks won't want a note on a car as old as it will be at the end of the term. Interest rates are usually higher on used cars, the tradeoff is you typically finance less as used is cheaper than new.  No matter what you decide to buy, see what rate you can get online or through your bank before going to the dealer. Dealers have partnerships with banks and can tack on an extra few percent to gain extra commission. It's OK to finance through the dealer, and sometimes beneficial as they will factor their commission on the financing into the deal, but don't let them screw you on rate. In the finance office, ask if the rate they present you with is ""buy rate"" or ""contract rate"", they'll know the jig is up if you use those terms. You want ""buy rate"" as that is the rate the bank will accept for the loan, ""contract rate"" is buy rate + what they tacked on for additional profit."
newhampshire,333lfi,DieCommieScum,2,Sun Apr 19 16:27:20 2015 UTC,My family and I have always bought cars from Cupples. You deal directly with the owner (Ross) and he has always been fair and honest with us. He wont sell you a piece of crap. The prices that he posts are based off of putting 20% down. I bought a car from him for $8000 that he advertised for $99 a month. I only had $1000 to put down so my payments ended up being $134. Hope this helps. I love Cupples.

Please keep in mind hiking in the Whites can be difficult and has unique quick changing weather patterns. Hypothermia/exposure is possible and has claimed lives every month of the year. Expect hard rooty and rocky trails, with serious vertical change in short periods, its not uncommon for a 50 mile hike to take over a week here. Please please please do your research and come prepared, we have had far too many hikers need to get rescued due to underestimating and not being adequately prepared. Here are some good links to check leading up to your hike:    Higher summits forecast for weather at summits above 4k ft.  AMC trail conditions for conditions at AMC huts in NH & Maine.  summit post for climbing beta on specific peaks.

I guess I need to do more research on my hike as I'm looking for a good 2 night, 3 day hike that's within reason to Manchester airport. Perhaps the Pemi loop isn't for me, as you said the Whites can indeed be unpredictable..I've only ever hiked in Waterville Valley in the summers as my family had a house there, but being a FL native it isn't' the same.  Are there any 2 night/3 day hikes that you could suggest? I'm a section hiker on the AT, but to be honest the Whites do intimidate me. I assume I'd have to invest in a bear can?

I don't own a bear can, would be want to invest in one as I'm a bit fearful of bears and know that NH is very active in the bear community, plus I'd be hiking alone. During the summer, is the Pemi loop active in hikers?"
newhampshire,331k99,Kreid603,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:34:08 2015 UTC,"Coming from FL to the Whites in July I don't think heat will be an issue for you. If anything you will get cold in the evenings and night. From the sounds of things it seems like the pemi loop is very doable for you. The vertical change will be a challenge but it sounds like your fit enough to take it on. I've never actually hiked in the smokies so all I know is from what thru-hikers have told me on the trail, but its usually pretty consistent that the grades are much more aggressive in the northeast. Looking at topos this seems to be re-affirmed.   I don't own a bear can either. Instead I Bear Bag. It involves P-Cord and a stuff sack. If your staying at an AMC tentsite they will sometimes have bear boxes for your stuff. During the summer, especially on the weekends and during holidays, the trails become very saturated with hikers. The Franconia ridge and the Bonds are some of the most picturesque spots in the whites and bring a lot of foot traffic through."

newhampshire,330944,ullrsdream,20,Sun Apr 19 03:09:37 2015 UTC,Why have a protest on a Monday afternoon?    The 420 symbolism just juvenilizes the movement and having the protest at that time   a) encourages idiots to show up and blow the whole thing by drawing inappropriate attention b) reinforces the idea that the only people who are against prohibition are available to protest at 4:20 in the afternoon on a Monday.  People will view this as they will.  c) prohibits attendance by the massive numbers of interested parties who do the whole 9-5 thing.    It just doesn't seem well thought out.  Cute stoner culture reference though.

newhampshire,32yh0o,cyclebiker,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:32:45 2015 UTC,"I went to a public school jr high in NH in the early 90s and we had both a wood and metal shop, and a sowing and cooking room. Then in 8th grade (1993) they eliminated all 4 so that we could have some bullshit Synergy class where we sat in front of computers and learned to do our nails, make cookies and balance a checkbook. Also we learned how to use a mouse in one station even though we all had actual computer classes in 7&8th grade. It was really sad though I was lucky to have a dad with a wood shop and a lot of patience to help me learn to make stuff. So I only missed out on some of the metalwork stuff.   I love maker spaces but we used to teach kids how to make things in ways that are still really valuable to digital makers. I teach and work at the fablab in Boston and am constantly showing students ""novel"" hand made solutions to making things that 3D printing and laser cutting can't solve."

If it's never completely legalized in NH they really need to decriminalize and have it available for medical purposes at least. Alcohol is so much worse as we all know.

newhampshire,32tqxp,GoneCountry87,4,Thu Apr 16 18:02:57 2015 UTC,I was interested in what the atmosphere is like. Is it more laid back with smaller towns or something different? I'm moving from the Southeast so how does the climate and temperature differ?
newhampshire,32tqxp,jello_zoo,3,Thu Apr 16 19:12:21 2015 UTC,"Go check out Newmarket. It's a pretty small town 10-15 minutes down 108 from Exeter. Awesome atmosphere, great little downtown area, and the food there is awesome.  Has a younger crowd with UNH being a short drive away, and Exeter, Durham, Dover, and Portsmouth, and Hampton beach area are all under 35-40 minutes. Rt 16 is a short drive away and that can take you to the White Mountains. I loved living there and keep thinking of moving back.  If you are an outdoors person you'll love it here.  Weather differences? Oh boy. Summer is usually between mid 80s to low 90s, sometimes cooler, sometimes warmer. Humid as hell, and it can last for days before storms and a front come through. Nights at their worst can be low 70s and humid as shit. Get an AC if you dont bring one with you.  That being said, the weather is crazy up here in New England. I've been in VT and was in a snow shower in July a few years back. A few summers ago we had all rain and cloud and 60 degrees. It's shaping up to what I think will be a hot one. Bring warm gear if you want to hike or camp. Mt. Washington is our highest peak here and is known for the worlds ""wildest weather"". I've been at base with temps in the high 80s and humid to later the day on summit its hitting 40s, wind is howling and you are in the clouds.  Have any more questions feel free to PM me. I love this state."

newhampshire,32tqxp,eastcoastfarmergirl,3,Thu Apr 16 19:10:53 2015 UTC,"Exeter has a lot of little shops in their downtown. 101 goes through it, so if you have a car, it's fairly close to Manchester and lots of other places to do non-specific things.

If you are anti-social jerk who needs to raise a ruckus to get your point across, it is probably best to write a letter to your selectman and stay home."

newhampshire,32rfow,nhmo,3,Thu Apr 16 13:54:50 2015 UTC,"Mental health is such a tough issue. The lacking amount of facilities for mental health make it insanely difficult for many to get proper help it seems.   I think it's important to recognize that the stigma behind these issues isn't always ""people with mental health issues are crazy/violent""  but often a general sense of people not wanting to see/deal with these kinds of problems. It's a crappy situation all around."

There are not 180 beds at the state hospital.  I certainly think there should be more help, and am very happy that Frank Guinta, among others, is championing this cause.

He said for some clients they had 'back-up' institutions in different states, so some will probably go there. Others will be taken back to their families if they are able. And then I'm guessing some will be sent to prison because many are there in the first place because they committed a crime. I'm hoping that's not the case but I don't know where else they would go. It would be great if someone could take over Lakeview who actually knew what they were doing so these poor people could stay there and get the help they need!"

If you can find a local VW club (There must be one) I'd imagine they do a lot of the same type of thing and a member may be willing to take you under their wing and show you the basics without requiring monetary return.

I really like lonesome lake in the franconia notch. I hiked that during mud season as an out of shape beginner, and when we got to the top the whole lake was still frozen over and it was still snow covered so you will need spikes or crampons.

OP, I'd consider a car rental like Enterprise or Zipcar. It wont take 14 hrs and you dont have to go by the bus schedule if you don't want to own."

newhampshire,329jxi,idrinkcoldcoffee,3,Sat Apr 11 21:11:21 2015 UTC,So...what's to stop you from buying a car for yourself?
newhampshire,329jxi,ChopperIndacar,1 point,Sat Apr 11 21:55:52 2015 UTC,"Well that would obviously involve the cost of the car, and then insurance which would be the real kicker. With Rensselaer costing close to 70k a year I can't afford many expenses. I currently have a job but my parents pay the insurance on my car. Even just liability coverage would far outweigh the price of a few bus or train tickets if available."

newhampshire,329jxi,dragomania,1 point,Sun Apr 12 02:04:30 2015 UTC,Why are you spending 70k a year for such a mediocre of a school as rip. (And why is anyone allowed to spend that much for college)

newhampshire,329jxi,ANewMachine615,0,Sun Apr 12 15:50:21 2015 UTC,"Trust me I've tried my best to lower tuition, I've appealed so many times that they no longer permit us to ask for lower tuition. Basically my family makes just enough money to get righteously fucked by the fafsa and most scholarships. Rensselaer did give me a leadership scholarship for ~10k but that doesn't help very much."
newhampshire,329jxi,dragomania,2,Sun Apr 12 20:45:42 2015 UTC,"The solution here is to go to a different school that offers you more money. If you come out of school making only $40k instead of $55k, but have saved $120k (which still brings you down to an outrageous $40k/yr tuition and all) then you're way, way ahead in life. Hell you've just saved enough for a modest condo."
newhampshire,329jxi,Protophobic,1 point,Mon Apr 13 12:57:20 2015 UTC,"That's true but one major reason for me sticking to Rensselaer is their average starting salary, it's close to 65k out of college with a bachelor's. I'm also looking into ROTC which would cover three and a half years tuition"
newhampshire,329jxi,nill0c,2,Mon Apr 13 15:34:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in that case, $35k for an RPI degree is probably worth it. Just note that schools are really, really good at manipulating things like starting salary numbers. I know (from experience) that law schools in particular drastically inflated their numbers. No reason the same couldn't work for engineers."
newhampshire,329jxi,xPersistentx,0,Mon Apr 13 15:35:39 2015 UTC,I had a similar scenario. Parents made just enough but we were by no means rich. Look into moving off campus after freshman year.

newhampshire,329jxi,jonnitin,3,Sun Apr 12 21:02:49 2015 UTC,Just rent a car from an enterprise or a hertz for $30/day. You don't need you parents' permission to do this. Just book it online right now.
newhampshire,329jxi,weco308,6,Sun Apr 12 01:57:12 2015 UTC,"Probably not an option if OP isn't over 25 yet, rental rates are way higher when you're young."

How about some small music venues? Great for your audio fetish and built in stages for your fiance to perform or where you can dance.  Tupelo Music Hall, Londonderry.  http://www.tupelohalllondonderry.com/rent_tupelo.html They just did a renovation so check their facebook for updated pics.   Blue Ocean Music Hall, Salisbury, MA http://www.blueoceanhall.com/book-a-private-event.html Amazing view of the ocean - right over it - And they would be slow in the winter.  To bounce off your stargazing idea - there's the Christa McAuliffe planetarium in Concord, NH. They do wedding rentals. http://www.starhop.com/plan-your-visit/private-events.aspx  Rent a video or film production studio for the event. Maybe even build a set for your wedding. For example: http://www.highoutput.com/crs_index.html  Perhaps you could find an old performance theatre like The Palace Theatre in Manchester, NH that also has a function room. http://www.palacetheatre.org/  or the Capitol center for the Arts in Concord. http://www.ccanh.com/venuesandrentals/planyourevent  Totally offbeat and goofy: make a deal with the Medieval Manor in Boston. http://www.medievalmanor.com/index.html  They do private shows on weeknights for relatively cheap money (in wedding terms) - you could probably make an arrangement for a wedding.  Another totally offbeat and goofy option - FunSpot in Laconia, NH. It's a giant arcade(and arcade museum - biggest in world - featured in doc King of Kong) bowling, indoor mini golf, etc. In the winter on a weekday you may be able to negotiate a take over. Maybe not the most romantic location, but you and your guests would have fun. http://www.funspotnh.com/about.htm  Okay, must get to work.

newhampshire,31t3ig,otiswrath,9,Wed Apr 8 00:03:43 2015 UTC,"My issue with Ayotte is and remains that she went to Washington looking to move up in the Republican national scene rather than to represent NH.

newhampshire,31namw,our_account,8,Mon Apr 6 17:11:20 2015 UTC,I remember when NH was fixing the bridge near exit 6 on 93 and many of my neighbors who lived nearby seemed to be more annoyed about the delays it caused than anything else.
newhampshire,31namw,SpartanG087,3,Mon Apr 6 18:44:00 2015 UTC,Some people complain about everything.
newhampshire,31namw,sobermonkey,3,Tue Apr 7 01:28:03 2015 UTC,Paywall.
newhampshire,31namw,sobermonkey,3,Mon Apr 6 18:21:23 2015 UTC,"Almost all of these are small, rural bridges that are hard to prioritize due to their small impact on traffic and the fact that repair work can keep them safe.  NH's major bridges and roads are actually in far better shape than our neighbor states.  Any bridge on the ""red"" list is inspected VERY thoroughly every six months and is taken out of service if it is actually dangerous.  I've seen these reports....you'd be amazed at how much they measure and take a look at."
newhampshire,31namw,g3wd,5,Tue Apr 7 18:58:23 2015 UTC,"Phew, I only have to cross 7 bridges to get to work. That was close!"
newhampshire,31namw,TheHIV123,3,Mon Apr 6 18:28:50 2015 UTC,Aren't we planning of cutting the DoT's budget? Won't this have an impact on maintaining the roads?
newhampshire,31namw,nill0c,0,Mon Apr 6 20:39:56 2015 UTC,"Yes it will, call your rep and tell them to fund these things. Gas taxes pay a lot of this budget, so feel good about them when you're at the pump next time. (Full disclosure, my civil engineer brother works for the DOT and doesn't want to have to leave the public sector so soon)."
newhampshire,31namw,thelivinginfinity,2,Mon Apr 6 22:12:29 2015 UTC,"The Sarah Mildred Long Bridge between Portsmouth and Kittery, ME is by far one of the worst bridges in the state. They're FINALLY working to replace it in a 3-year contract deal with Maine DOT that just started this year.   NH has been lacking on funding it for far too long. I mean, I understand 93 needs work, not arguing that, but this dilapidated bridge was hit by a barge two years ago and instead of putting some money down to fix this high volume 70+ year old bridge, NH decided to beat around the bush for another two years and continue funneling money into the 93 project, as well as start the Route 16 project right up the road.  I'll just be happy once it's replaced and safe to travel over."
newhampshire,31namw,g3wd,3,Mon Apr 6 18:57:15 2015 UTC,"Actually, that's incorrect.  ME and NH had an agreement that NH would (and did) replace the Memorial Bridge and ME is doing Sarah Long.  Memorial was in worse shape than Sarah Long is now...and the bridge railing/crash barriers are really the only really bad part (hence the temporary ones on there now).  I was involved with both the ship-crash repairs and the new bridge construction.  EDIT:  SML was put off so that there was never more than one crossing out at a time.  Both NH and ME DOT's were VERY nervous when SML was hit two years ago because it meant the 95 bridge was the only way across the river south of Dover...and they were going into vacation season.  Emergency response issues could have led to actual deaths.  Thankfully Cianbro got SML back into service ASAP.  I was actually in the office and department that first got the call.  Closest I've ever seen an engineering office come to looking like an ER!"
newhampshire,31namw,Lefthandedmidget,2,Tue Apr 7 18:55:18 2015 UTC,The 16 project is a nessessity.  The General Sullivan bridge is pretty much suicide for 4 hours out of the day due to people driving like cockbags.

newhampshire,311ely,sirsteezy,0,Thu Apr 2 16:43:49 2015 UTC,"I would start here: http://www.runnersalley.com/groups/weekly-running-groups  They have weekly runs out of runners alley, and getting to know your local running shoe store is a great place to start.  I've run with the group out of Manchester - Mostly vicariously through my wife.  I know there is a group in concord also...  Checking...  Found them:  https://www.facebook.com/GraniteStateRaceTeam  If they're anything like us you have at least a once a week meeting (different than the running shoe place) and you meet at the track during the on season for some speed work.  Off season are longer runs.  It's great as you get to make some instant friendships, meet like-minded folks, etc.  So from there it's easy to find an extra person or two to run with on other days / hours.  I'm not affiliated with either above so I can't vouch for the folks there, but my experience is that the running community is a pretty damn good one and welcoming one.  I joined up and was probably the second slowest in the group.  (the 80 year old guy was the only one slower than myself).  They are all welcoming.  So anyhow, if you have a tough time finding new local folks to join up with you, that is another avenue to look into.  Best of luck!"
newhampshire,311ely,carterbrown,0,Wed Apr 1 11:43:04 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I'll look into the local running group you mentioned.  I live right near the store and need to just go in and check them out and find out if there are other groups running besides the times I saw listed on their website.

We live outside of Nashua, but would make the 3 hour drive to Hermit Island in Maine, which is spectacular.  It sits on 225 acres, and it's the only place I know of that has ocean-front camping.  Some sites are up on the cliffs over looking the ocean, some are sand-based by the beaches, and some are back from the shore, in the woods.  Trails go around the island, and there is one beach cove on the island that can only be reached by hiking that is less crowded.  We camped there several times when my kids were young and have very fond memories of the place.  It's incredibly pricey for a campground, but it is truly unique.

Places like texas have been courting companies to come to their state via low taxes.  New York has caught on but too late.  Once you're known as a state to screw over companies, they won't come back...  But you've seen the ads just like I have:  Move your company to NY and no taxes for 10 years.

The reason the crisis is happening is that the cost of education is getting out of hand and middle class students have no other choices except to get loans. Being middle class I was offered Un-subsidized loans which accrue interest while you are in school. Most middle class students are not offered subsidized which interest doesn't accrue until graduation. Keep in mind the unsub/sub loans are govt loans, these are only given in small increments of around $2500 per semester and go up little by little every year (depending on income when filling out FAFSA).   Everyone says I could've worked or could've went to community college, but UNH doesn't transfer the credits from NHTI because of their accreditation so I would've had to take the classes again."

As a 17 year old kid coming out of high school and every guidance counselor and teacher telling you how important 4 year colleges were, it was my last thought honestly.   Keep in mind that was back in 2007, it was a whole different ball game back then. I know in CEPS kids who went the tech school route, non of their math/science credits transferred and set them back a full year.

Someone mentioned Texas luring companies to move there, what they did not mention is how much Texas is giving these companies in subsidies to move there.  They are bribing them with public money.   We need to stop these cuts and start talking about the real problem that has been facing NH for decades, our revenue stream.  Minor fees, and huge property taxes.  We need a better system where everyone pays fairly and equally."

newhampshire,30su4i,We-R-1U,4,Mon Mar 30 20:25:47 2015 UTC,"You're incorrect. Even if you do not own property you are paying property taxes.  If you rent, a portion of your rent goes to taxes.   Property taxes are an example of regressive taxes that take more % wise from the people who make the least because they are a set rate. For example if property tax was $1 and you only made $10 that would be a lot of your pay.  If you made $100 it would be minor.  I think you see my point.   This is why NH has the highest number of Millionaires per-capita they have the least tax burden of anyone in the state.    To bring more employers to the state we need to have more educated workers who can do the job, and companies willing to pay for the work being done and a reasonable rate."

newhampshire,30su4i,teefour,0,Tue Mar 31 14:30:38 2015 UTC,"Right, but my point is that if NH could snipe some of those companies up here, then the income would stay local and boost NH's economy in general. Innovation and business expansion are the only places jobs come from. In terms of the tech companies that are in NH currently vs those around Boston, the pay is comparable.   Also, low taxes on the wealthy in Mass? I suppose its more or less flat, but its a flat 6.5% off your income and a flat 12.5% off any capital gains. Combine that with the severely inflated housing prices, and it doesn't matter that NH property taxes are higher, NH is still a better deal."

newhampshire,30su4i,We-R-1U,2,Tue Mar 31 01:35:58 2015 UTC,"a flat tax is a regressive tax.  It means that people who make more money would be harmed less by the taxes.  Think of the reverse a Progressive tax would have a lower rate of taxes for lower income brackets and as the income rises so does the percent of the tax rate because there is less harm when a millionaire pays 100,000 in taxes verses someone paying 1000 out of their 10,000 dollar salary.    The US Income tax is set up as a progressive tax, until you get to the super rich where the rate actually goes down again."

I drive a 1/2 ton truck, and live on the seacoast.  I don't think I put my truck into 4WD a single time this year for normal driving, and it was a stupidly tough year for snow.  I had to flip it into 4WD to get into my driveway (it's a steep hill and never cleared when I get home), but otherwise not driving like it is nice out is all you need.  Well, that and a few hundred pounds of weight in the bed (I rode with 400lbs of sand/blocks during the worst of it).  Get good tires and don't be in a hurry.  No matter how many wheels you have spinning, you won't be able to stop, and that's the part that'll get you.  The best part is watching all the people who think they are invincible in their Urban Assault Vehicles (giant SUVs), and shitbox Subarus get stuck in snow banks.  All wheel drive does not mean all wheel stop."
newhampshire,30sgg9,Lefthandedmidget,2,Mon Mar 30 11:03:52 2015 UTC,That's what I like to hear. Since the past 2 years were El Nino years I'm hoping the next few will be a little more bearable
newhampshire,30sgg9,Lefthandedmidget,6,Mon Mar 30 11:07:01 2015 UTC,"It's always a crapshoot.  Snow if fine - ice is what will get you every time.  The thing to remember about snow is that you'll start slowly, and stop eventually.  Spinning your tires in snow is a great way to either get stuck or go in a direction you do not intend to go.  Drop the tranny into a lower gear for higher torque and ease into it.  Hitting ice is an overall petrifying moment.  You'll be going along in one direction, then suddenly you are going in a new one.  When in a spin on ice/snow, don't slam the brakes, as you'll lose complete control.  Give it a little power and steer into the skid, and you'll either get out of the slide or at least be able to direct the impact of your truck into something that will be less painful.  I lost an AWD SUV on ice a couple years ago.  I was going to work, tapped the brakes to let a deer cross, next thing I knew, I was going backwards down the road into a tree.  No matter how many wheels I had spinning at the time, I would have still gone into the complete spin.  It happens sometimes."

Add the fact that you're an inexperienced driver and you may be asking for trouble. Our roads get very bad, and if you need to stop/start multiple times, it's more efficient for the car to pull itself out, rather than push itself out, if that makes sense.

Your best tools are always going to be low speeds and paying attention. If my little Civic can be ok with just the tire swap ($~550 + $50 for year-round storage of the other set and switching the over) you should at least give it a go. How sad would it be to lose your truck when you don't need to?  Both our cars are in the 140k miles range, so what we'd make from selling them is so low that it was worth it to try this out."

I used to do that with my old pickup. Only real need to know thing, is drive slow, accelerate and slow down slowly, and if you feel the rear wheels slip get the hell off the gas, don't brake and keep it straight... you will not gain control with power. Be water.  Other than that, front wheel's better because when you slip out, you don't slide out like a rear wheel vehicle.

Just remember to take it slow and steady and you'll be fine 😊"
newhampshire,30sgg9,LovePugs,2,Mon Mar 30 11:35:27 2015 UTC,I can't believe no one has mentioned studded snow tires!  I agree with most saying that AWD/4WD is not necessary but Rear wheel drive might be tough on you- plus your inexperience. I would highly recommend studded snow tires- NOT all seasons. A 4wd with all seasons is worse that fwd with studded snows. People think they are unstoppable and drive like idiots JUST because they have all seasons and AWD/4WD.   Way better off getting studded snows and seeing how the rear wheel drive works for you. There are also advanced snow driving schools if you're really interested. I also wouldn't bank on the snow being less in coming years.
newhampshire,30sgg9,perfectbebop,4,Mon Mar 30 12:28:32 2015 UTC,"Just another note, make sure you have gloves, an ice scraper with a brush, and a snow shovel before the first storm.  Even if you rent a house with a garage you can still get snow covering your vehicle when you're out and about."
newhampshire,30sgg9,weco308,2,Mon Mar 30 16:22:39 2015 UTC,"Survival on the roads is more so staying in your lane with driving ability and truck capability. Look up a few tips to help your truck perform better (show tires, weighing down the back, etc.) And you could even take a winter safety course ( http://teamoneil.com/winter-safe/) just an example.   Watch the news and most employers here really understand that if it's awful out they don't expect you to risk your life to get to work. Respect the conditions, give yourself extra time to drive appropriately and make sure you have an emergency kit. I honestly think that'll help more than just a switch to awd.  Enjoy!"
newhampshire,30sgg9,iamthepandaman,2,Mon Mar 30 11:10:09 2015 UTC,"I ran Michelin X-ice2 with my fwd Mazda Protege5 without an issue.  Plowed through like a hot knife through a butter on most roads.  Obviously we aren't talking unplowed deep snow either.  Good thing most roads are plowed and as long as you're driving safely you'll be fine.  High performance all season's may do the trick with AWD but I personally prefer having dedicated snow tires and wheels.  I currently run 16"" steelies with Altimax tires on my WRX and it's a blast :)  Drove up the mountains in middle of winter, cut through 20""+ of powder and great traction everywhere.  I would consider AWD over 4WD for snow.  The rear stays in place with traction control and doesn't whip out like FWD and 4WD in my opinion."

newhampshire,30sgg9,iamthepandaman,0,Sun Apr 5 13:41:54 2015 UTC,I don't think 4wd or awd is necessary. I drove a Prius all winter without issue.  I also live in Nashua.   Not sure about rear wheel drive though... That can be tough. You would definitely want to weigh down the bed of your truck with some sand bags or something.   Do you imagine you'd have to be at work every day regardless of weather? Usually the roads are fine once the snow stops if you can waiting out at home.

newhampshire,30sgg9,ChopperIndacar,1 point,Mon Mar 30 11:03:32 2015 UTC,"Some heads-up on pipeline surveying in Southern NH. There's a lot of bad press about the proposed gas pipeline route through the southern half of the state.  Going with that, there are many ""No Pipeline"" lawn signs showing up on roadsides in Litchfield, Hollis, Amherst NH.  If you are here to survey for the pipeline, keep it low-key.    On a 4X2 RWD pickup, adding tire chains can get you out of much trouble, with a required lowering or top speed."
newhampshire,30sgg9,iamthepandaman,1 point,Thu Apr 2 16:09:18 2015 UTC,"I haven't read all the comments, but if its been said I'll say it again (and if it hasn't, well I strongly recommend you take my advice!). I drive a rear wheel drive truck. The key to being safe is having a good pair of snow tires, which only get used in the winter. All seasons will not cut it in a RWD truck. Unless there is fresh snow that is usually plenty, but if you want to be more safe, add some weight over the rear axle. I've used sand bags in the past, but now I use concrete plates, about 4 of them. This will help a lot with traction. Other than that the best advice is to take it easy, don't drive fast or aggressively, and be cautious. Your breaking distance will almost double, since you'll slide a bit, and don't hit the gas too hard when you start rolling! Follow those tips and you'll be perfectly fine!"
newhampshire,30sgg9,sholder89,1 point,Mon Mar 30 13:58:45 2015 UTC,"Let's not forget he's (basically) never driven in snow before.  There is a serious learning curve to people who haven't been around it.  Different snow means different driving styles.    Honestly, I think he's going to have a rude awakening.  It's one thing to figure out how to drive in snow, it's another to figure out powder vs ice vs powder on ice vs wet snow vs wet snow on powder etc. etc.    If there's one thing I've noticed about transplants, it's that southerners and snow have a hard time."
newhampshire,30sgg9,skankersores,1 point,Mon Mar 30 14:28:24 2015 UTC,"True, I may have had an advantage come from Canada (where I originally owned the truck). Ultimately these are some important tips for winter driving in general. People seem to forget how important snow tires are, and they think that 4 wheel drive is enough to make you invincible. Knowing that you only have RWD makes you think more cautiously, which is funny because even 4WD trucks are RWD unless the differential is locked, in which case the truck shouldn't drive at highway speeds"

Why do we need to force people to run their businesses a certain way? If they want to drive themselves into the ground then fuck them. We don't need to legislate every aspect of the economy  Why do you want to give your money to bigots? That's what ""decriminalizing discrimination is"". Making it illegal to not serve people will not cure discrimination"
newhampshire,30vk71,skankersores,9,Tue Mar 31 01:42:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Strictly from an economical point of view a person or business that discriminates puts themselves in a losing position.    If I'm a business and I don't hire someone because of whatever, I'm not hiring the best person for the job.  If I don't, my competitor will.  My competitor will win out over me.  So from a strict economic sense it's foolish to discriminate.  We don't need a law for it.    What we're doing with laws is making ""protected classes"" of citizens where you can't say, do, or whatever.  I thought the idea was to be equal.  Making a special law for someone doesn't make them equal, it just makes them worse off.  Instead of being equal they become ""one of those""  Just be quiet until they leave the store...  Instead of being equal, we're making everyone else less so.  People fail to see it that way because they get completely caught up in the emotions of it all."

newhampshire,30vk71,throwawayNewH,10,Tue Mar 31 01:46:20 2015 UTC,Why do you want to give business to people who are discriminatory towards other people?
newhampshire,30vk71,skankersores,-4,Tue Mar 31 01:51:11 2015 UTC,"The point of a business is to make a profit. Why are business owners discriminating in the first place? I understand what you are saying, but, unfortunately when you live in a state where the majority is white and will not be discriminated on or see the discrimination  first hand, they will still most likely be a consumer at that business later on.  Markets work in a funky way, and people will still purchase their goods or services, especially when the surrounding area and business all have similar mind sets."
newhampshire,30vk71,qeroca,10,Tue Mar 31 02:01:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, businesses are to make a profit. If you take those profits away, as in not going to the business because it's run by bigots, they are not rewarded for their behavior. Forcing them to serve everyone is doing nothing but keeping shitty people in business.  Which is why people should speak up. Get a hold of reporters. They eat stuff like this up, for good reason. We know all about that cake maker who wouldn't make a cake for a gay couple don't we (I believe it was Arizona)? Why not boycott the business and punish them for their behavior instead of rewarding them with a profit? These laws don't make people un-racist or anything of the sorts.   And your last paragraph is saying most places have ""similar mindsets"" which is in this context, discriminatory. I'd find it hard to believe that'd be the case here."
newhampshire,30vk71,skankersores,-9,Tue Mar 31 02:12:31 2015 UTC,"Should we boycott the business and say ""shame on you for discrimination"" or just out right make it illegal, because at the end of the day we have moral standings, and legal standings. I for one want to be backed by the law, for people can change their morals very easily.   And saying similar mind sets does not mean having the same. People are prejudice, which was kind of where I was going with that.   But again, how do you get one discriminated persons voice to be heard by the majority when the majority has no problem? It's not that easy. Hell we have had a history in this nation trying to get people heard."
newhampshire,30vk71,qeroca,6,Tue Mar 31 02:18:16 2015 UTC,"Yes. Yes we should boycott businesses and say ""shame on you for you discrimination"" because that negatively effects the business. Making it ""illegal to discriminate"" only rewards those businesses by paying them.   Your last point is obviously not an easy answer. I do believe we live in a highly technological world where world is easily spread. Random scenario: My black friend posts on facebook that a local sub shop refused his service because they were black. I will not go to that establishment anymore, and encourage people to do the same. Would you?   The alternative to this scenario is a piece of shit racist sub shop owner still gets business because it's illegal for them to refuse business.   Obviously there's a infinite number of scenarios and variables in a situation like this but the core of what I'm saying remains the same. Making ""discrimination illegal"" does nothing but reward discriminatory people."
newhampshire,30vk71,skankersores,-7,Tue Mar 31 02:32:20 2015 UTC,"Ok so according to you it goes like this  Have the law; reward discriminative people  Have no law; just boycott the place, while someone is still denied service.  Why should, a majority person, have to boycott a store for something that does not directly effect them? Even if what the business is doing is unethical? Why should they get out of there way to do this? boycotting is more than just no longer going there, it's getting other people's attentions to also no go there.   Again, people who are not directly affected by the problem will more likely not do anything to solve the problem. This is why we have race and ethnic relations; to inform!  I'm happy you are no longer giving your money to that store for them discriminating your friend. I will not either. But getting everyone else on board is not that simple. We vote with our money, we vote with our ballots. There's the best of both worlds, make it illegal and still don't give them service."
newhampshire,30vk71,qeroca,6,Tue Mar 31 02:44:18 2015 UTC,"If you make discriminating illegal how do you know the owner (quick edit: or the business in general, I can imagine a store clerk or someone not the owner could be the issue here as well) is discriminating?   And no, a majority person doesn't have to boycott a store for something that doesn't effect them. Look at the outrage in relation to these bills. Shouldn't all these same people be on board with boycotting a store for being discriminatory? It seems like a pretty big portion out there that think businesses refusing patronage is abhorrent. Why wouldn't these people boycott those places of business?   I realize that's a question you can't answer as you can only truly speak for yourself. But what's the issue with boycotting? People are too lazy? Too inconvenienced? The only issue is getting word out, but I truly don't imagine that being hard in the world we live in, especially all the people speaking against this legislation (quick edit: hit send to early i realized) that are outraged with people being refused service."
newhampshire,30vk71,skankersores,-3,Tue Mar 31 03:06:09 2015 UTC,"you know someone's being discriminated in the same way you knew prior to a law... Because they are being discriminated on. There's not secret code.   A boycott entails making business suffer financially. If the minority that gets discriminated on boycott, who isn't given service anyway, then the company should be fine. This is why you need the majority, the people who shop there to boycott, the REAL profit.   The issues with boycotting are again, having to do something that does not directly affect you.   Do you know why the boycotts on the buses worked so well after  rosa parks was arrested? Because the largest group that used the buses were in fact the minority.  What's the largest group that shops at this store we created in New Hampshire? White people.   Also to edit, if having the law helps set a standard of how to act, maybe it will help promote to boycott if a company is doing something that breaks the law and not just something morally wrong. Sure they are still a bigot with the law in, but once they mess up they still get punished. This time it's for certain.   I do not agree with chick fil a, on their negativity towards same sex marriage, and not every state allows it yet, but guess what! A good chunk of people also do not agree with same sex marriage and go to chick fil a to support them. You can now apply everything I said to this company and it pretty much checks out to be the same scenario."

Good riddance to bigots and their shitty policies.  Maybe then we can start making actual improvements to the state instead of wasting time passing laws of hate that only serve to create more wasted money in the form of the inevitable lawsuits to combat their hate.  Want to save money for the state? Get the bigots away from drafting litigation-prone policies.  Want to save money for the schools? Get the bigots away from administrative roles implementing litigation-prone policies.  Want to save money on law enforcement? Legalize and tax drugs, and train police to not abuse people and stop litigation-prone policies (Weare anyone?).

newhampshire,30i7vl,paithanq,2,Sat Mar 28 00:15:20 2015 UTC,"Well, NH has the seventh-lowest state/local tax rate in the country.    Another way of looking at it is ""How many days do we have to work before we've earned enough to pay our total federal/state/local taxes for the year?"".  The average date for NH residents is April 19th.  That is 17th in the nation, earlier than 2/3 of the other states.  This implies to me that our state is run on the cheap, and maybe if we want roads without potholes or a public college that is cheaper than a private one we should pony up some money."
newhampshire,30i7vl,just_ducky_in_NH,9,Sat Mar 28 00:55:01 2015 UTC,"That's an overly-simplified and biased way to put it.  We had enough money for those things before.....now we don't.  The question no one is asking is ""Ok, so why can't we afford the things we used to be able to afford?""    If the answer is that USNH suddenly got dramatically more expensive (despite its high tuition) then the answer is to cut back there, not whine for a higher tax burden.  As a current UNH student, UNH has been spending money on capital improvements like a CRACKHEAD while charging students and faculty for everything.  Its a bit tough to see all the money they spend and turn around and hear that ""those mean GOP types want to de-fund USNH"".  No....USNH is just spending a SHIT TON of money lately."
newhampshire,30i7vl,g3wd,1 point,Sat Mar 28 18:33:50 2015 UTC,"We've never had the money for any of this before.  It is just that now we have been neglecting our infrastructure for so long that if we don't address it we will have disasters, like falling bridges.  Students and faculty are charged for everything because the state won't support the university system.  NH support of the state university system is 50th in the nation.  If the current state funding were increased by 45%, we would be tied for 49th place.  Donors are willing to give money for capital improvements.  If Peter L. Paul or Marcy Carsey are willing to donate millions for capital improvements, then by golly, we'll have capital improvements.  Maybe then the system can attract rich students who can afford to attend the place, because there certainly isn't any financial aid for the typical in-state student. . ."
newhampshire,30i7vl,just_ducky_in_NH,6,Sat Mar 28 22:19:34 2015 UTC,"I've spent the last 8 years at UNH and the amount of money that's been spent on campus is mind-blowing.  The lions share is not donations, although those are great to have and have driven a few signature projects.  I don't know if you've been around campus in the last few years but there's construction everywhere and alot of it is the University (there's a couple of private projects too).  Our facilities are generally more up to date than many of our ""elite"" competitors...Northeastern, MIT, BU, WPI to name a few I've been at recently.  Professors and research drive ""prestige""...not new dorms, dining halls, roads, off-campus housing, busses, etc.  Many private schools are well behind UNH in many of those regards and ahead of us in prestige.    It is a complex topic for sure, but I don't see very many signs of an ""underfunded"" college on campus lately.  If anything, its the contrary."
newhampshire,30i7vl,g3wd,2,Sat Mar 28 23:28:41 2015 UTC,"""You have to spend money to make money."" That's the case here. In order to attract students, especially from out of state, the school needs to find a way to offset its high cost of attendance. For many people in this day and age, having shiny new facilities is a major force of attraction. I'm assuming you're some sort of STEM or Business major, in which case yes, your facilities are often quite up to date. The problem is that many aren't...look at Ham Smith, the PCAC, etc. Horton was awful until they spruced up the inside this summer. Those buildings are not very good. In order to keep attracting students in all fields, the campus needs to be consistently updated along with attracting good professors and research programs. NONE of those things will happen if the system receives poor funding. I agree that it is equally important to also focus on research and prestigious professors, and that yes, they could also focus on that more. But at the same time without state funding none of that will happen. UNH does pretty well considering its public status and it's dramatic lack of funding when compared to national averages.   Edit: This isn't intended to be a personal attack. I'm just saying that not all of our facilities are so great, and along with attracting research, overall campus facilities need to be good too."

I'm just going off of many years on campus and seeing the recent spending spree.  So when I see a headline about how USNH is being robbed of money I'm like ""Wait.....they had a shitload a minute ago...""  I'll see what I can find.  Should all be public."
newhampshire,30i7vl,g3wd,1 point,Sun Mar 29 06:21:36 2015 UTC,"I know the Peter T. Paul college was supposed to be all donations but ended up being paid the rest by the university. I believe he gave $25 million and ""challenged"" other alumns to fund the rest. Obviously the donations didn't come pouring in and the school started construction before funding was available. It was supposed to cost $50 million to build, unsure of the final cost.   Being a WSBE grad, I got to hear all of the prof's bitching about how they had their heads up their asses. The reason tuition is being hiked is because they want to make their campus look elite and brand new. The only way to pay for these improvements is to jack up fees and tuition."

It is consistently ranked in the top 200 US universities, not bad considering there are close to 3000 four year institutions. It also has been near the top of other categories for its efforts in sustainability and the intellectual property law program is consistently top 10 in the country. It's unfair to categorize all the schools as generally mediocre. It can't be expected that every school compete highly with the prestige of Ivy Leagues."
newhampshire,30i7vl,captain_falc25,2,Mon Mar 30 20:30:27 2015 UTC,"This isn't just a problem of ""Why should I have to help pay for the University System of NH's students."" If this budget passes, and tuition continues to rise, it's not just the students and their families that get screwed, but also the state. The USNH is a huge part of NH's economy. UNH alone directly supports 3000 businesses each year, and the talent the university has graduated generates $1.4 billion for NH's economy annually. All of the other USNH schools add to this. Yet NH is dead last in the nation in support for higher education. If we continue to make higher education harder to obtain, less people will come here/stay here and the skills people in this state need for NH to compete in the future will be non-existent."

newhampshire,30i7vl,captain_falc25,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:46:22 2015 UTC,"Seriously? Every year I was there tuition went up, which in turn made my student loans rise. What I was getting at was I think it's idiotic to cut state funding for it, but UNH doesn't do anything itself to lower costs. If they received more funding from the state, they would just find places to spend it, that's my issue.   I think their biggest flaw is they are trying to become an elite school but won't ever be an elite school. They are trying to look the part but won't be able to play it. I understand they have been trying to get themselves away from being a ""safety school"" but their costs are asinine."
newhampshire,30i7vl,timmythegreat,2,Mon Mar 30 20:28:10 2015 UTC,"I apologize if my previous reply sounded rude, it was not intended to be. While I realize that yes, tuition had previously been steadily climbing, the past two years, tuition was frozen. At the start of that process, students received messages about contacting representatives and telling them why it should happen. With this recent proposal the same has been happening, including emails from school admins asking us again to contact our government and get the funding to freeze tuition again for two more years. They seem to have finally grasped the situation in some ways. The website with info on this is here: http://www.unh.edu/works/homepage.   I agree that it would be a bad idea to cut state funding. I definitely see where you are coming from in saying they would find a place to spend it if they had it. According to the administration, their plan is to funnel a lot of it into additional scholarships. Whether or not that is actually the case, who knows? Obviously it will never be an Ivy League caliber school but that doesn't mean they can't improve. Considering the situation UNH does pretty well and I think it has been working to distance itself from ""safety school"" status. Obviously there is much more to do, and some priorities will need to be changed to do so, but at the same time, without funding none of that matters because it wouldn't be possible."

Due to the cold temps this year, many people added electric space heaters without understanding the consequences of them, some people added multiple heaters.  The rate increase in January for PSNH was $0.0069 /Kwh to 10.56 cents.  If you have Unitil, you're at about 15.5 cents/kwh.    Third party suppliers, if you go that route, do not have to get approval from the PUC to raise their rates, so make certain you lock in the rate their quoting.  Most of these contracts are for 6 months starting in January & the rate is balanced across those months, so if you switch early, they can legally back-bill you for the actual cost from the beginning of your contract.  Sadly, with Eversource selling off power generation, we're all going to get the shaft on rates."

I've always looked at New Hampshire as paying market value, and as a way to prevent someone from becoming career politicians to game the system."
newhampshire,3008sn,issue9mm,2,Mon Mar 23 15:07:25 2015 UTC,"Right, but that also means that they can't actually specialize in being legislators, and have to do it as a part-time job. There's an argument to be made that government is important enough to merit more than the time and effort that $100/year buys you. Also, the low pay makes it much easier for the already relatively rich to put actual time into the process, as opposed to the relatively poor. We're a big enough legislature that I feel like a fair number of at least middle class folks get in there, but that has its downsides too (see, e.g., the silly Magna Carta bills and the like that come up every year because we let any yahoo with 30 dedicated friends in)."
newhampshire,3008sn,ANewMachine615,4,Mon Mar 23 15:15:27 2015 UTC,"I dunno why you're getting downvoted, as you aren't necessarily wrong.  There are indeed compelling arguments on both sides of the coin.    To me, the trump card is that in New Hampshire, there is more direct representation, and I don't know if that scales by paying market wages.    In New Hampshire, there's a representative for approximately every 3,200 citizens.  In California, it's 465,000.  The increased odds of being able to actually SPEAK to a representative seems, to me, to enable greater democracy, even though (and in spite of) California's direct ballot measures, which I think evoke only marginal utility, and only on certain kinds of issues."
newhampshire,3008sn,issue9mm,1 point,Mon Mar 23 17:54:50 2015 UTC,"Eh, downvotes in /r/newhampshire are random and capricious. It's just a fact of life.  I think that you're right, overall. The Magna Carta bill didn't go anywhere except onto a few joke articles online; neither did the ""real 13th Amendment"" bill a few years ago. Overall, the highly representative nature of the legislature is probably a good thing.  However, I think that the pay for legislators is kind of irrelevant to how direct the representation is. Obviously the legislative budget would be larger if we paid more, but that's not to say we necessarily need fewer members; we would just need more money. Heck we'd need more money anyway if we wanted to pay anything close to a full-time salary. With 400 members, the House's total personnel cost is just $40k a year, so even if we cut down to 1 rep per 465k citizens, we'd still only be paying them ~20k/year."
newhampshire,3008sn,ANewMachine615,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:00:45 2015 UTC,"Right, but if you pay each of those members $40k, the budget goes up to what, $16,000,000 a year, and that's just for the reps, not counting aides, staffers, secretaries and other support personnel?  That's why I'm saying it doesn't scale.  Pretty soon, you start getting into real money."
newhampshire,3008sn,issue9mm,-1,Mon Mar 23 19:16:40 2015 UTC,"Wow, i really don't care about politician's in our state making more money.  I'm just pointing out that there are not too many people that can afford to serve in such a public role, for what they receive in compensation.  Trying to get any legislation passed in the state is extremely difficult, due to the size of our representation. That being said this is a quote from ignoramus Groen;  ''Every time we're in session, the gallery is open and there are children in the gallery. So I don't know, should we limit free speech? Or should we limit who goes in the gallery?"""

newhampshire,3008sn,GeneralJohnStark,0,Mon Mar 23 23:45:57 2015 UTC,Alright I'm generally curious start us off pros vs cons. If you want to debate this bring us the pros of why the legislature was in line to say all of this. As you can already see the cons are over stated.
newhampshire,3008sn,bigmikeylikes,6,Tue Mar 24 08:40:36 2015 UTC,"This is the third time this topic has been posted, so I'm just going to paste what I responded to it before:  Having watched the full 18 minute video of what actually happened, my observations:   Only Rep Groen with his Planned Parenthood comment seemed out of line. Rep Abrahmson who spoke in favor toward the end, made no real point and shouldn't have bothered speaking. The other speakers did not appear to me to be in any way disrespectful.   The fourth graders went through the educational process of researching, writing, revising, lobbying for their bill - That is the important part. The state legislature does not pass every bill and not passing this bill doesn't take away from the educational process. If the teachers plan the lesson with appropriate expectations, there will be some disappointment, but there's no reason students should expect the bill to pass.  EDIT: And thanks for not just down-voting my comment like a dozen other people."

While it would have been cool to have a state raptor I understand why the didn't pass it. Silly legislature bogs down the actual process for legitimate issues and they had to make a precedent. Unfortunately it happened to 4th graders and people sensationalized it. The only reason I feel this got as much attention as it did is because of the planned parenthood comment because lets be honest that came out of nowhere.
newhampshire,3008sn,bigmikeylikes,1 point,Tue Mar 24 13:34:48 2015 UTC,Oh absolutely.  If not for that comment no one would have even known about this.  Certainly wouldn't have seen it on national shows or news.  It was a stupid thing to say.

Most of it boils down to the fact that NHDOT is the best run DOT in New England.  Any contractor will tell you this.  They are one of the few that still does a considerable amount of design and even maintenance in-house.  NHDOT has true bridge design engineers and roadway engineers on staff designing stuff.  By comparison....MA does almost none, and as a result, most of their people know very little about it.  They're all bureaucrats.   When you work with a neighbor DOT, you generally have a hard time getting straight answers on questions and things are generally not very well organized.  Details get missed on their end all the time.  NHDOT is usually very sharp.  Their drawings and contracts are clear and few mistakes are made.  They answer questions promptly and they don't mess around.  As a contractor, we love this.....we make no money if a job drags on or has complications.  We make the most profit when stuff gets built quickly and correctly.  We want to build a good bridge or road and move on to the next job.  We are proud of what we do and want to maintain great reputations with our clients and the traveling public.    There are several roads I was on recently where the state line from NH to a neighbor state was clearly visible by the pavement getting WORSE as you left NH.  If you think NH's rural roads are bad....VT and ME are far, far, worse.  MA's highways are generally worse.  Bridges are the worst in Maine."

newhampshire,300fcx,gn84,4,Mon Mar 23 19:13:04 2015 UTC,"When the ASCE says infrastructure is crumbling, you should probably be suspicious. The long term interest rate is not ""near zero"", it's above 2.5%.  Borrowing that can't be paid off in the short term using short term instruments is highly irresponsible, and likely to become highly unstable if it continues. Throwing money at projects that do not create enough revenue to sustain themselves is why we are in this mess to begin with.   By itself, raising the gas tax is not a sustainable solution to these problems.   An increase in the gas tax, additional sales taxes/fees or more deficit spending only allow us to continue to distort – for a few more years – a transportation system that is not financially viable. Without any price signals providing supply/demand feedback, we are destined to build ourselves into insolvency (again)."

The University System of New Hampshire is one of the most efficient public schools in the nation and relies on state funding for roughly 9% of it's budget whereas other schools such as California and New York average 20-30%. There are buildings on this campus that are not ADA compatible, laboratories that are outdated, and buildings in dire need of renovation. While battling aging infrastructure UNH is able to provide higher education to thousands of Granite Staters and fuel our economy for years to come. Likewise with infrastructure, if the choice is made to reduce funding for the DOT, statewide our infrastructure will crumble. The current budget calls for reductions in both the University System and the DOT. If you guys are interested check this out!. To answer your second question... I'm afraid that NH isn't investing in the future as much as we should be and we will likely pay the price shortly down the road."

newhampshire,2zvb3f,invenio78,4,Sun Mar 22 23:45:25 2015 UTC,"However, if you keep the same education model and cut millions out of budgets, the students are the ones to immediately suffer.

The establishment will never change as the ones collecting the money and benefits do not have any incentive to change.  The ONLY pressure we as voters can exercise is through budget control.  Simply ignoring the problem and cutting other programs does not help to give kids a better education or to stop the wasteful over spending in the school system.

They pay health care costs of teachers in other states (like Utah) and they spend only 40% of what we spend per student per year.  My argument is that ""more money does not equal better education.""  The money is spent on bloated administrative costs, not students.  If spending more money on education per student resulted in better education, the US would be ranked #1 in the world.  Instead, we are the #1 spenders, and rank 36 globally.  We have to cut the glut, and focus on students.  It actually takes very little money to have a teacher in a room with 30 students with a simple textbook on each desk.  sauce:  http://www.cnycentral.com/news/story.aspx?id=978874"

newhampshire,2zvb3f,itsmckenney,2,Mon Mar 23 16:27:32 2015 UTC,"The ""glut"" is all the spending which is NOT done in other school systems all around the world which have better academic performance at a small fraction of the cost.  So that would include everything from extravagant benefits of staff, high administrative costs, and programs that are not directed at education purposes.  For example, simple wasteful buying such as getting new editions of ""algebra books"" every two years at $130 a piece (algebra has not changed in 100 years and they could use books that were published 10 years ago at 5% of the current cost).

Also, right at the fork of the bridge to hudson.

newhampshire,2zp6om,bobbyj023,13,Fri Mar 20 15:21:28 2015 UTC,"There's a reason for that.  Panhandling is considered free speech.  Hudson NH got sued by the ACLU because the police were telling the panhandlers to move along, and they just settled the case and paid out like 30 grand, the vast majority of which went into the lawyers pockets.  So the idea is that you penalize the drivers, and if no one gives handouts to the panhandlers, the panhandlers will go away.  I think anyone who stops in the middle of the road should be ticketed anyway, I shouldn't have to wait while you dig out a dollar for that guy when it's a green light.  There was a guy panhandling in Hudson for a while, and he got dropped off daily by a woman in a Grand Cherokee.  People were giving him money, and bags of food from market basket.

Hudson NH got sued by the ACLU because the police were telling the panhandlers to move along, and they just settled the case and paid out like 30 grand, the vast majority of which went into the lawyers pockets.   Speech that obstructs/tends to obstruct traffic is like the archetypal time, place, and manner restriction that's generally acceptable. Hudson had issues largely because they were trying to enforce a non-existent ordinance banning panhandling. Whether such a suit would be successful where panhandling is barred is quite different, though I'd also argue that they would have issues for not being content-neutral (Hudson is one of the worst for the boot campaigns -- I've seen huge backups near the bridge every time they run it).  The Nashua ordinance is content-neutral, and thus likely less open to challenge. The article even points out that it's going to bar boot campaigns and the like. Personally, I think they could go after the panhandlers directly, but if they prefer this indirect route, fine. Whatever works."

The kind of people we have panhandling, though, are the kind of people who will take your bag of Hannaford's groceries that you just kindly donated to them, and march their ass into the store for a refund so they can buy drugs and alcohol. You can literally offer these people a job and they will scoff at you.  The kind of people who need assistance aren't standing in an intersection with a sign. They're too hungry for that shit. Go give money to the hungry looking guy on the park bench, not these scumbags standing in the road looking to buy their next fix. Screw them."
newhampshire,2zp6om,Sqwirl,-3,Fri Mar 20 18:24:06 2015 UTC,Just from your response I can guarantee you have never even talked to one of them.
newhampshire,2zp6om,telemecanique,5,Sat Mar 21 00:56:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but I don't really need to talk to them. ONE of the ones by exit 36 sometimes holds a sign saying he's a Marine Vet, he sees the Vet plate on my truck and starts saluting over and over, with his LEFT hand!, No marine every would salute with his left hand unless he didn't have a right arm. Next DAY was a totally different sign about his two homeless kids.  Some, maybe not all are nothing but scammers, and because of it, I won't give to any of them.  And before you start, I do some volunteer work with Vets. And there are some down on their luck, but still wouldn't lose their pride enough to do this BS.   Edit: You can also add the clown at exit 5 today. Wearing what looked like a brand new, but outdated, camouflage jacket, and a sign saying ""homeless vet"". After two years my jacket was faded and looked like crap."
newhampshire,2zp6om,telemecanique,0,Sat Mar 21 01:20:57 2015 UTC,"Your willingness to write off entire group of people because of what you see as one scammer is odd (or maybe person with mental illness? how about some sort of severe PTSD? would it be ok if had a sign claiming to be King Charles? but claiming to be marine it's not ok, because someone with serious mental issues should know better right...) You don't have to do a thing, just go on your merry way.  I drove by a man today with a sign ""will work for food to feed my kids"", scammer? or maybe dad really near his bottom? Hard to imagine that's a scammer too.  Hey I knew a girl once that was with a vet who abused her, beat her, did drugs and was an all around scumbag, no one would accept the idea of writing off all of you based on that one experience, but in essence you just said that's what you did.   My main issue is that banning it really does nothing, they will still have their addictions and need for income, they will just use other means, likely theft and the few that likely use it to stay afloat with legitimate needs will suffer even more, it doesn't seem worth it to me to just ban & forget."
newhampshire,2zp6om,telemecanique,2,Sat Mar 21 03:11:58 2015 UTC,"I might actually give someone a few bucks if they were holding a sign saying they were King Charles, at least he may think he is. The people claiming to be vets are only using the current trend of supporting vets. How much do you think they would get using that gimmick  15 years ago?  As for your man that will work for food, did you offer him some work? If you had, you would gotten an insult in return most likely.  As for the boy friend, yeah he's scum, no one ever said on here or anywhere else, that all vets are perfect.  And as for you main issue, do you have any source to prove that theory?"

newhampshire,2zmsu8,meltingparadiso,8,Tue Mar 24 03:03:20 2015 UTC,AKA Dilation and Extraction. These account for 11% of all abortions in this country. The procedure can be performed generally between a woman's 16th to 20th week of pregnancy. The most common reason for this method is a pregnancy that is already self-terminated and the fetus should be removed to protect the health and future fertility of the woman. Next most common reason pertains to medical issues with the fetus. Rounding out the reasons are women who did not have access to access to abortion services in the first trimester or rape victims who had trouble processing that a pregnancy resulted from their trauma in the first trimester.

I want them to then go on and create voluntary solutions to the social issues they've identified, negating the need for a government solution in that area.

newhampshire,2zm0nh,Mail_Me_Yuengling,4,Thu Mar 19 20:07:14 2015 UTC,I grew up in NJ and live in NH now. I take The TZB to Saw Mill Parkway to 684 to 84. 84 can suck but its better than 95.

newhampshire,2zm0nh,kathryn13,1 point,Fri Mar 20 01:03:33 2015 UTC,This is good alt route if you want to bypass GWB.
newhampshire,2zm0nh,madgreed,3,Thu Mar 19 20:03:58 2015 UTC,"Taking the GW is by far the fastest way.  Going off memory, shooting up to Albany and then taking the Mass Pike over to 93 will add a solid 2 hours or so onto your drive.   Driving the entire mass pike is also a pretty heavy toll I believe so it's not like you'll be saving toll money (although given you're in NJ I doubt that's your concern)."
newhampshire,2zm0nh,weco308,1 point,Thu Mar 19 18:52:10 2015 UTC,"Hi,  This is a week late from the original request, but we will add our two pence anyway:  With the PANYNJ's rapacious toll hikes of recent years, the eastbound Hudson River crossings from NJ to NY are to be avoided at almost all costs.  If you take the TZ over the GWB, you save about $9 ($5 TZ Bridge, $14 GWB cash).  If you go further north, the bridge toll drops to $1.50 cash.  As for a low-ish traffic route, I would consider the following:  Cross the Hudson at Tappan Zee Bridge, Follow I-287 to the Sam Mill River Pkwy north, then join I-684 NB to I-84 Eastbound into Hartford.  Take I-91 North from Hartford to Brattleboro, VT, then exit I-91 for NH Route 9 into Keene, NH, then NH Rte 9 North to Henniker; NH 9 joins 1-89 Southbound, Follow I-89 to Concord, then I-93 North to Loon.  Oh, one last thing: Tank up in NJ before entering NY;both NY & CT have notably higher gas prices & taxes than NJ.  On your I-87 ride thru ALB to Loon: Not too bad, but you can avoid the Thruway toll by taking Taconic State Pkwy to upstate NY; note the Taconic has frequent speed enforcement (55) from NYSP.  The ride from Albany-Brattleboro-Keene is a slow drive, but scenic and easy."

There are a ton of Mexicans here, and yeah, I had my pre-conceived notions. 6 years ago I  started a non-profit, which put me in close contact  with the Hispanic, mostly Mexican  culture. Fast forward to today, and I swear, most every Hispanic/mainly Mexican person/family I communicate with, are the warmest, sweetest, happy, humble and appreciative people.

newhampshire,2zai7e,HazardousWeather,14,Mon Mar 16 23:39:14 2015 UTC,"Having watched the full 18 minute video of what actually happened, my observations:   Only Rep Groen with his Planned Parenthood comment seemed out of line. Rep Abrahmson  who spoke in favor toward the end, made no real point and shouldn't have bothered speaking. The other speakers did not appear to me to be in any way disrespectful. The blogger who wrote that piece is clearly one of the parents who was there, and isn't looking at the situation objectively.  If I were to get judgy, they are probably a helicopter parent that thinks their child should get a trophy for participating.   The fourth graders went through the educational process of researching, writing, revising, lobbying for their bill - That is the important part.  The state legislature does not pass every bill and not passing this bill doesn't take away from the educational process.  If the teachers plan the lesson with appropriate expectations, there will be some disappointment, but there's no reason students should expect the bill to pass."

This was like 7 years ago now, but they were nice apartments and had a 10x10 attic storage unit, set back in the woods and a lot of them were owner-occupied condos.  They do have a rental office, so you're best off just going there and talking to them to see if they have apartments available.  And they aren't on the side of the highway that gets hammered with holiday traffic, that time of year we'd sometimes take Exit 4 -> East Dunstable -> Spit Brook to avoid traffic."

Save Money and live within my means.  2. Meet new people.   I would like to point out that I currently have my own apartment at Tara Heights (would not recommend, avoid that place like the plague).  I have decided that having a apartment (at least on this big) is somewhat more of a burden then its worth,  so I am trying to scale back and live more simply. You would think that I could also bring roommates into my current apartment, but my apartment would not lend it self well to sharing (there is only 1 bathroom and 1 bedroom, with a den)."

newhampshire,2z5gdk,mrjackspade,4,Fri Mar 20 16:48:22 2015 UTC,"Many things, here is a small list:   Lack of available parking, particularly in the winter. I have sometimes had to park in the office park which is a 5-10 minute walk away, which is a lot if you are carrying groceries. Price. They gives you deals up front, but then jack up the price after the first year. Storage costs extra, you have to pay you own water bill (atleast $20 a month, just for the meter). Storage space is extra (and their isn't much in the unit either).  Maintenance issues. There is something screwy with the water system. I can not run a clothes washer load and dishwasher load at the same time, even one one is cold and one is hot. I have called Pennichuck Water to address this, they looked into it the best they can but said its internal. I tried to get this fix, but got the run around. The smoke detector beeps 3 times once or twice every night, and they don't know why and just keep replacing it. I have escalated this to the manager to see if he can have them look at the internal wiring, they said the smoke alarm company keeps sending them new ones, but it doesn't fix the problem.  The place was built on the cheap. Flat paint was used, sometimes not more then 1 coat. if your walls ever get dirty you can't clean them with out stripping paint, even using a soft cloth with luke warm water.  When I first move into, the building was brand new. It took me months to get everything fix, that should of been address when they built it. So you have to watch out for this particularly if you moving into a brand new unit.  Poor layout. You end up wasting a lot of space because of the way everything is layed out. Its kinda hard to describe this, but you will notice it when you move in and start trying to place furniture. There is one trash compactor for the entire complex, so if you move into one of the newer ones far away, be prepare for a 10 minute walk in the cold to take the trash out."

Closing paragraph: ""The PUC report said the plants have a total value of some $660 million, but would probably fetch about $225 million on the open market, leaving $435 million in so-called stranded costs to be paid by consumers.""  That doesn't reconcile to me.  I fail to see how having less electricity generation is helpful to anyone, given the article's comments about supply being thin.

It will still lower energy prices across the region as energy is bought on the open market. The more available in the marketplace the lower the price. That's simple economics. See the oil and gas industry.  The aesthetic issue is a big issue which IMO they haven't adequately resolved. But NP would reduce energy prices.   As for this ""sale"" if they sell these plants, we will see prices increase after the 18month holding period. This is PSNH, aka Northern Utiliies, aka Eversource trying to sell lemons. It's likely that some of these plants (see: Bow) are going to have to be shut down, DESPITE the subsidized $500 million scrubber that we will still have to pay for. That's what sucks about crony capitalism. Lawmakers passed the law, taxpayers funded part of the improvement AND see higher rates so PSNH can come out with a profit."

The arguments for the gas pipeline are that the gas plants are reliant upon expensive tanker shipments for a handful of peak usage days in the winter.  Added local capacity from other sources OR an increase in natural gas prices will destroy that investment, just like the drop in gas prices destroyed the scrubber investment.  But the regulated utilities are protected from the downside risk by their ability to push their investment mistakes onto their captive ratepayers   Wind and water are the only viable renewable sources in NH   There's more solar potential in NH than in Germany  Also, energy usage per capita is falling, and NH's population is leveling off.  Adding additional capacity for old, centralized energy sources when new, decentralized sources are emerging is not a good idea."

Prices can fluctuate ""on the market"" just as they could when you own the plants if labor costs increase or something breaks trigger more maintenance.  And of course, we are ignoring the reality that ""on the market"" energy is also dealing with labor costs and maintenance costs.  It seems like it's just taking the issue and making it concentrated into larger sources, which is a lack of diversity, which seems to be less ideal in the long run. But we'll have to wait until it goes to shit to be able to deliver that point to the advocates of shutting down the local plants.

newhampshire,2yqnpr,T-to-B,17,Mon Mar 16 22:04:00 2015 UTC,"I am so sick of the lack of progress on this issue.  It is absurd.  Governor Hassan has threatened to veto any decriminalization or legalization bills that pass-- this is not only a condescending and immoral dismissal of the People's will (as evidenced by polls, legislative action- 74%!), it is not based on sound reasoning or evidence, even according to her own reasoning.   This claim that legalization will somehow endanger children or send the wrong message to them, this is a disingenuous argument that is entirely false.    Those making the argument should be constantly challenged on this point, it is pure fantasy propaganda, not based on anything.  It should not even be allowed on the table as a legitimate POV, because so much of the prohibition argument seems to rest upon it, and without it they have nothing.  The truth is, REGULATION by the state is precisely the ONLY thing that COULD ""protect the children."" Every study for 25 years concludes that kids report it is EASIER to get marijuana than alcohol.  Black market dealers do not ask for ID. It is obvious.   And regulating alcohol sends a much clearer message to the children than hysterical misinformation, disproven claims, and puritanical denialism and repression. Kids, or really teenagers, are not stupid, they know when they are being lied to, and to be lied to about such an issue only undermines their trust in the authority of the state and adults in general. They think, ""Well they lied about weed, so maybe they're lying about meth too.""  So all of this means that, ironically, by opposing legalization, prohibitionists such as Governor Hassan, are literally making it EASIER for kids to access marijuana... exactly the very thing they purport to stand against!  At best this is a tragically misguided line of reasoning;  at worst, it is a deliberate lie designed to instill fear in parents and older generations.  And not only this, but the invalidity of the ""protect the children"" argument serves to further discredit another popular prohibitionist argument that marijuana is a ""gateway"" drug.  Since there is no actual scientific basis for a physiological gateway effect, the only way marijuana could be a gateway drug is if people are going to the black market to get it.  By forcing marijuana into the shadows, you place it in direct proximity to the networks which provide the harder, actually dangerous drugs.  Put another way, nobody is selling heroin in a NH state liquor store. (Well, it's probably happened but not officially...you know what I mean)  The governor would do well to listen to the people who elected her, because when every other New England state legalizes in the next few years, she is going to look quite foolish, and NH will have missed out on millions of dollars in tax revenue (which I might add, we are uniquely positioned to collect with minimal overhead or investment due to our already existing infrastructure of state liquor stores, if we chose to go that route).   It is only a matter of time before we will see marijuana stores off the highway just inside the border in MA or VT. (And in fact, Hassan's own argument for Keno-- that NH folks will gamble no matter what, and so they travel to MA for Keno, and NH loses the revenue-- you can substitute marijuana for Keno in that argument and she is proving her own self wrong on marijuana, because exactly the same principle and reasoning applies).    Bottom line is, it is time to finally fix this mistake. It is a disgrace that the Live Free or Die state continues to limit the natural freedom of its citizens by prohibiting a harmless plant which has existed for millions of years longer than human beings have. (We literally have cannabinoid receptors INSIDE our brains, it just doesn't get any more natural than that!)  TL;DR - Governor Hassan needs to stop ignoring the will of the People and get on the right side of history. Prohibition has no legitimate justification, legalization is long overdue."
newhampshire,2yqnpr,JustGimmeSomeTruth,2,Thu Mar 12 19:07:53 2015 UTC,While I agree with you on every point I don't think marijuana will or can be sold in the same way hard alcohol is in New Hampshire. Since it is still federally illegal I don't think the Feds will allow it to be sold in state run stores. They may let it slide in other states because it is sold by private industry with state over site. But I don't think they will let a state take full control of the sale of it.   This may be one of the biggest barriers to legalization in this state. New Hampshire won't let private industry take this over because they won't be able to take control back when it is finally federally legal.
newhampshire,2yqnpr,DoctorMog,3,Fri Mar 13 02:17:16 2015 UTC,"That is an excellent point, I hadn't considered that.  You're saying  that perhaps the idea is to wait until it is federally legal and/or so de-prioritized that there wouldn't be any real interference-- with an eye towards not wanting to let the cat out of the bag before they could lock it down with a state monopoly.   Or in other words, they surmise that only the private sales model would be permitted by the Feds at this time, and they know it would be a harder challenge to get any established private marijuana industry to suddenly allow the state to take full control some years down the road when legalized federally.  Yeah, put in that light, it certainly explains the behavior of Hassan and others.  Although I could see it going another way if NH did decide to use the liquor store system now... And that is, it might have the potential to catalyze the change at the federal level precisely because it would be so blatantly contrary, and so it might force the issue and either call their bluff, or get DC to show its hand at least.    Putting the ball in their court in a scenario like that might make them more hesitant to interfere if it would mean going head to head with the state itself to that degree.... Rather than some nascent private industry.  Seems like it might lead to a Supreme Court case or something... Although not sure if that would be a good thing or not.  I just wonder if the assumption that state control/sale wouldn't be permitted is actually sound... Maybe they aren't assessing the risk correctly."

It was intended to prohibit unauthorized United States citizens from interfering in relations between the United States and foreign governments.  The Act was passed following George Logan's unauthorized negotiations with France in 1798, and was signed into law by President John Adams on January 30, 1799. The Act was last amended in 1994, and violation of the Logan Act is a felony.

It was suspended from the ceiling  and yes, each of the legs had a rope you could pull to make the legs move. It was in the back room of the Arts & Science center, the building right across the courtyard from the library.   The back room was a sort of playroom for kids. Also in there was a mock 'house' with little rooms, and best of all, a 'firemans pole' mounted close enough to the wall that you could climb up the wall by bracing your feet against the wall. When you got to the top you could ring a bell and slide down again.I could swear tit went all the way up 30+ feet to the ceiling, but i am sure I am mentally exaggerating. They took everything out of this room, and i'm not sure what it became.  Google News has a story about it with a picture. Googling 'spider + Nashua Arts & Science Center gives you a few more.

newhampshire,2ygcjm,Usernamemeh,2,Mon Mar 9 16:17:54 2015 UTC,"Bitcoin is fun, but I don't understand the push to have a third party sell them and give the USD to the government for you.  I guess they see it as a step in the right direction, but why stop at bitcoin?  Why not precious metals?  Why not dogecoin?  Why not DarthMaillard Bucks?  Maybe the government should only accept government currency and allow people the freedom to use whatever they agree upon in private transactions, like how things are currently.    Lobbying for a government to play favorites with an alternate currency doesn't sound too libertarian to me."
newhampshire,2ygcjm,DarthMaillard,3,Mon Mar 9 18:30:44 2015 UTC,"Government itself is anti-libertarian.  That being said, there are definitely great variances in different governments. Some are impossibly corrupt, opaque, and ""anti-competetive.""  In a country where people have 50 states to choose from, and a world that is increasingly becoming globalized, states (criminal organizations that they are) still need to compete to attract people to move there, or stay there. The truth is that many young, intelligent, and productive people are in the Bitcoin community. A state that can offer people to pay taxes in Bitcoin is more likely to get, or keep, people from that community to live there.  A state like California can ""get away"" with being horribly inaccessable and non ""user friendly"" because it has lots of sunshine and good weather. A state like New Hampshire doesn't have that. It has something else to offer, though, and that's a live and let live attitude with an accessable government that largely accomodates its citizens (tax cattle).   I suspect a lot of the other alternative currencies you mentioned above would also be something many in New Hampshire would have no problem accepting. That being said, you have to start somewhere, and Bitcoin is as good as any.  That being said, I don't vote or take any stance on this issue as I'm a political atheist. But I understand the sentiment among libertarian leaning statists."

Hopefully in practice it would just go through some payment processor that'll eventually let you use bitcoin or whatever semi-popular altcoin you want, but there's absolutely potential for abuse for not much benefit.

newhampshire,2y35ja,issue9mm,4,Fri Mar 6 14:44:17 2015 UTC,"People shopping for readily available consumables definitely seek to maximize value.  If this is an increase of only 9%, that already makes it more profitable for me to purchase on the internet.  Unless you've been hiding in a cave somewhere (I dunno, maybe you have), you would agree that on the whole, volume dealers on the internet tend to have better prices than local shops with more overhead anyway.   The ""extra $1"" would indeed be negligible if we weren't talking about a consumable.  It's not that people can't afford the extra dollar, but why would you pay it if you didn't have to?  When I buy vaping products, I tend to buy a number of things.  Atomizers, small bottles of juice, cotton batting.  If the cost of each of those things goes up 9%, that adds up.  Over the course of a year, I'm paying a measly extra dollar at least three dozen times.    But again, we aren't talking about a 9% increase, we're talking about a 74% overall increase.  Which means that I'm not paying an extra dollar to buy locally, I'm paying an extra three dollars, on top of an already more-expensive product than I can buy on the internet.   If I buy a few different flavors at a time (as I typically do), that would basically be a difference of $20 per shopping trip. If you don't think people aren't going to order online to save $20, you're crazy."

Im from Mass and seriously, and we've kept a proposed 90% tax at bay for 4 years so far. (This year is likely our year though). If MA can fight it, you better believe you can.   The thing is, vendors and vapers alike need to actually show up to these things. Letters and emails are OK, and everyone should write one, but they dont have the same impact as when 5 (hopefully 20!) Vapers show up and speak. If you dont, the Antz, who most certainly will show up, en masse, will own the floor, the debate, and run completely un-opposed, spouting their nonsence data points to everyone of importance. Every hearing I have been at, there are no less than 8 organizations that show up to slander ecigs. No one is showing up for you, no one is going to help. You have to do it yourselves.   *BIG EDIT *  One other thing, there was an important study released this week that basically said ecig vapor has no toxicity. Know where the study came from (acedemia), know the name of the author, and report its findings in a sentence of two.   Scrap that, I just learned that the above study has issues and funded by Lollilard. Dont use it, just stick the the peer reviewed Drexel Unibersity Study, ""Peering through the mist"". It says the same thing and was done by Acedemia.   Also, here is an awesome list of ecig research (He keeps it up to date): www.ecigalternative.com/ecigarette-studies-research.htm  Dont forget tobaccoanalysis.blogspot.ro/?m=1   As well as Casaa list of studies as well as Dr. farsilonus website of bis studies (ecigaretteResearch.com??)  END BIG EDIT  Secondly, since I have seen this alot down here with TobaccoFreeKids et al, they are using the bogus Japanese study (which wasnt really a recognized clinical study) about top-coil stardust style atomizers creating absurd levels of formyldyhyde as a major talking point. This talking point needs to be refuted. One, we, as users, have know for years, that top coil attys ( bring a sample to hold up if you can), offered a terrible user experience. Thats why, years ago, these bottom coil attys became industry standard (bold up new bottom coil atty), so the study is using 4-5 year old technology. The reason why this is important, is because we know that liquid doesnt travel upwards to the coil very well, as such, the coil get too hot since there is not adequate air and liquid being supplied. When this happens, the user will immediately taste something so horribly wrong, that they might even want to rinse their mouth. However, in the study that (insert previous speaker) mentioned, the authors did not replicate an actual user experience, but rather used on of those mechanical puff machines that takes no account of what the user would taste, and immediately stop using. Think of it like this....if you burnt your toast to a blackened crisp, would you eat it? Now, you would through it out. If your toaster oven burnt your toast every single morning, no matter what you did, would you keep using it? No, you would throw it out and buy one that worked properly ( hold up newer style bottom coil tank), which is exactly what we did, 4 years ago. The only thing this study-that-was-not-study did, was prove that no matter what you burn to a blackened crisp, it will always get thrown away. ( BTW, all char on food technically is a carcinogen, point being, burning anything is bad)"

The studies are out there, so if anyone is going to go to the meetings and is currently in college (and so has access to the academic journal databases that I no longer can access) please look them up and post them for people to use.

newhampshire,2y0t40,jeffsfather,1 point,Thu Mar 5 14:12:47 2015 UTC,I switched over to ENH for 12 month fixed rate. At the end of the 12 months the rate was going to skyrocket and become variable. I switched back to PSNH since their rate was lower. I'm in limbo and on PSNH for now. People need to be very careful switching over to these alternate companies and remember when the discount rate ends.
newhampshire,2y0t40,bobbyj023,7,Thu Mar 5 16:24:43 2015 UTC,"I keep having that same thought (and receiving those same North American Power letters).  Any time I've really looked in to it, I end up reading a bunch of horror stories about what happens after your 12 months expire and your rate becomes variable.  My conclusion is that you can save money, but that you have to be diligent about watching your bill and being aware of when your agreement is going to expire so you act on it in time to avoid the price surge in month 13.    Some people have failed to begin the next switch too late and ended up paying extremely high rates for two to three months following the end of your locked price, and negating all the savings they had.  Personally I don't trust myself to micromanage my utility bill.  I'm the kind of guy who will fuck that up. http://www.unionleader.com/article/20140105/NEWS05/140109711&template=mobileart"

The federal gov't imposed rules on the states without consulting them. That's the problem.   Furthermore, for me, since some states have stood up to the law, like NH, it puts a significant portion of the nation at a massive disadvantage by not being able to access federal government services and the ability to fly. Some could say that violates the 14th amendment but there are experts who know more than me on that part."

Right, but what the federal government chooses to accept as proof of identity isn't within the realm of the states. That's how they're implementing this law, to get around non-commandeering."
newhampshire,2xygoj,tehproxy,9,Thu Mar 5 14:12:59 2015 UTC,"I'm just curious why people would have a problem with the Federal ID, but then also buy a Passport?   A passport is recognized by other countries when I'm visiting out of the United States.  It's an internationally recognized thing.  If I want to visit France, or Australia, and they impose a means of identification that is above and beyond a U.S. Driver's License, then so be it... it's their country.  I can either choose to get a passport to travel, or decline, and stay within the U.S. shores.    A driver's license, on the other hand is, in name at least, a certification that I'm able to drive within the state it was issued.  Because the nation realizes that people often drive from one state to another, the states acknowledged this and created the Driver's License Compact (DLC).  The state obligation for this was to ensure that all of its licenses were issued after completing tests, so that a driver from Nevada was not so poorly trained at driving that he would wreck into everyone in Arizona.  In addition, the states have all agreed that, if you get a ticket in one state, they will report it to a central database available to all states so that one could not simply avoid paying tickets by staying on the move.   After the DLC, driver's licenses became the de facto form of identification... not because it was particularly good at it, but because almost everybody had one.  Moreover, as all the states attempted to keep their licenses from being easily counterfeited, it evolved into a pretty effective form of identification.    Because of all of the above, the federal government wants to implement RealID, and they think that it should be easy enough to force everyone into getting one, since they already have driver's licenses and whatnot.  The problem, of course (aside from the tenth amendment implications that the federal government can just demand that states begin issuing IDs), is that the RealID contains electronics that allow for the possibility of identity theft at a distance (even though, by all indications, it should be pretty short distance-safe).    The real problem though, in my opinion, and the reason I would attempt to opt out wherever possible, is that the electronic components allow for tracking the holder wherever it is used.  The Heritage Foundation (oddly) dismisses this, because they believe that legal restraints will prevent states from collaborating using the electronic data only to share identity information when the user allows it.  Pragmatists, on the other hand, believe that if the federal government (of today at least) has access to some electronic data, they will use it, no matter what the law says, and then back up their findings through parallel construction (meaning, they found dirt on your movements by using the RealID, which told them what to look for, so then they look for other evidence of your movements, and only present that evidence in court, never mentioning that the actual source of the data was illegally obtained).    So, I know that was a long answer, but it's a complicated enough subject that I felt exposition was warranted, and that is why I don't have any problems with a passport (that I keep at home whenever I'm not traveling), and do have a problem with a RealID.   Edit: Swapped out Guam for Australia.  No passport is required for Guam, as it is a U.S. Territory."
newhampshire,2xygoj,ullrsdream,1 point,Thu Mar 5 03:08:54 2015 UTC,Guam is a U.S. Territory. They don't impose anything other than what the federal government requires unless you're flying through Japan.

newhampshire,2xygoj,issue9mm,-1,Thu Mar 5 15:26:57 2015 UTC,"While I understand your concern the fact of the matter is,  if the federal government wants to track you, they'll track you. If you have something to his, someone will find out. And if privacy is a virtue, then you should stay off of the internet.   At the end of the day, like it or not, everything we do on the Internet, cell phones, with credit cards, is all tracked and recorded in records. Now it should be understood that there isn't a team of guys reading everyone's texts and laughing at naked selfies, but when we use these systems we are forfeiting our rights to privacy. They can pull up at any time, what we say, where we were, what we bought, etc...   The real question is, what are you doing to remain off the radar? Because these systems exist and aren't going anywhere. RealID's with RFID or not (which btw stealing the info from it electronically is like someone photocopying your drivers license, it won't get you far) are trivial really, what matters is whether or not you are breaking the law or doing something that would warrant an investigation into the data that has been collected. If you don't give them a reason to look for you, they won't.   Now I can see why that seems a lot like drinking the kool-aid but to be fair, the government doesn't care about you, or where you go, or who you talk to. They've got bigger fish to fry."
newhampshire,2xygoj,SirGraniteHead,4,Thu Mar 5 04:03:28 2015 UTC,"Internet trackability can be overcome or, maybe better stated, not associable to my real identity.    Credit cards can still be overcome with cash, prepay cards, or disposables.    That said, I'm not particularly worried, myself, about staying off the radar.  My internet identity almost everywhere nowadays is some variation of my real name.  I've written code for the government (not the NSA), and I'm aware of their capabilities, and sure, I acknowledge that trying to stay private in 2015 America is swimming upstream, at the least.    That doesn't mean that I don't value my privacy, or that I should make it easier for the government on purpose.  For me, it isn't so much about paranoia, though your matter-of-factness about how justified that paranoia ought to be would probably give others pause, it's about the ability to secure one's own assets.    I can use PGP for email, Tails as my OS, connect to the internet with Tor, and do a pretty decent job of keeping my online identity separate from my real identity if I so choose.  It disgusts me personally that I would have to do all that to keep the government from intercepting everything, but so be it.  Similarly, in the real world, I could wear hats, masks, pay for things with cash, use Whisper Systems RedPhone to make calls and TextSecure to send texts on prepaid Android phones.  Moreover, I could walk everywhere I wanted to keep my car from showing up on license plate cameras.    The question isn't should I have to do that, really, but should we be actively seeking to make it impossible for me to remain private?  I personally think that we should not.  Moreover, I think that the bar for retaining one's privacy is already too high, even if it is technically doable.  I do not seek to make the evisceration of my privacy easier for the government.    I agree that they almost certainly have bigger fish to fry, but as someone who has worked for the government, and occasionally writes code for systems the government may not approve of, I don't know if that would always be true.  In the unlikely event that I (or someone else who has done nothing illegal) were to somehow embarrass a future administration to the extent that they wanted to punish me, I'd rather have more protection from abuse than less, and I would much rather that the citizenry of our nation did not have to resort to wizardry and arcana to have the same.    Another thing worth noting is that there are people who do have real secrets that the government might really want.  Whether it's a tea party leader they'd like to discredit, or a Senator who blocked a bill they wanted passed, or a reporter who is trying to protect a confidential source, Wayne LaPierre, or just a completely innocent person that they suspect might be harboring a terrorist.  Those people deserve privacy too, and the real danger in being able to track everyone's movements is the ability to create a false narrative that seems very convincing to a jury pool."
newhampshire,2xygoj,AgaveNeomexicana,2,Thu Mar 5 05:36:40 2015 UTC,"There are several objections to the REAL ID program: Unfunded Mandate: The Feds tell NH to make big changes to their Drivers license, including participation in a federal database, and tell NH to pay for it themselves. That's the Feds trying to force an expensive program onto NH's state budget and taxes. That money could be spent on better things than an invasion of privacy. Plus, that's rude.  Social Security Numbers: Your SSN was never supposed to be the national id number it has become. People worried about that happening, and were promised it would only be used to income tax purposes. Now the Feds want it stored in a national database accessible by anyone everyone with a job at the DMV.  International Data Sharing: Canadian provinces and Mexican states can join that database. So all your information is shared with Mexican and Canadian DMVs.  Political Issues: The Real ID program comes with a pile of stricter burdens relating to immigration and terrorism. Your opinion of these will vary with your political leanings, so I'll just say this: the Feds have defined ""terrorism"" to mean a lot more than you think it means. For example, some college student who wants to show the world the animal cruelty of a veal production facility and secretly video tapes it is considered a terrorist."

newhampshire,2xygoj,issue9mm,1 point,Thu Mar 5 03:05:45 2015 UTC,"Pardon the wall of text, but I want to answer every question.  They're all legitimate, in my opinion, and I don't think they should be disregarded.    1.) Since most ID's are used interstate, and airline travel is almost EXCLUSIVELY interstate, doesn't that give the feds jurisdiction?   Inter-state travel is not regulated by the Commerce Clause, despite the name.  A state may choose whether or not it respects the driver's license of other states.  There's no federal dictum that says that they have to.  They all just collectively agreed to set a minimum standard for driver's license issuances so that untrained drivers would cause problems in better trained states.    As for airline travel, well, the TSA could impose a RealID requirement for air travel, but that's a separate issue from whether or not they can mandate that New Hampshire issue those instead of driver's licenses.  To put it into a dumb analogy, I can charge you a pie to ride in my car, but I can't force your mother to make you that pie.     2.) I know that (from working with alcohol) we were actually encouraged to deny out of state IDs if we had ANY suspicion of its validity since (in my bosses words) its not our responsibility to memorize all 50 state layouts,and isn't worth the risk of getting our license pulled. Wouldn't a federal ID make a lot of aspects of life safer, and easier, with little to no extra effort?   Potentially, sure.  The voters of New Hampshire have decided, by blocking RealID legislation, that they prefer the inconvenience over the ability to better protect their identities.  If they later vote that the convenience of purchasing alcohol is greater than identity protection, then that's a state matter.  The feds, under the 9th and 10th amendments to the bill of rights, don't have the authority to simply demand things of the states.  This is somewhat countermanded by federal pre-emption, which is supposed to give the feds leeway when federal and local laws conflict, but pre-emption only applies to powers enumerated to Congress by the Constitution, and there's simply no provision for this, except for potentially the Commerce Clause, which doesn't work in the case of non-commercial driving (which is what individuals do, but not what taxis do).    3.) What are the feds asking for that's pissing off everyone so much? What do they want on IDs that aren't already there?   An electronic chip that might aid them in tracking your movements.  The social security number as the identifying factor. Both of those combine to make it more effective for someone to steal your identity.  A database that stores all of your identity information in a federal system.  And the implicit additional requirement that the RealID would become the de facto ID for everything, from buying baseball tickets to liquor to guns to flights etc.    4.) Don't the feds already have access to all your info?   Counterpoint: If they already have access to all my info, then why do they need a national ID card that just lessens my privacy protections against would-be identity thieves?  If they don't, then why would we make it so that they could?    5.) Is this going to increase ID renewal prices, or otherwise inconvenience people?   Maybe, but I honestly think that ""increased cost"" is a minor point in the debate to most people.     Honestly I have my gripes with the US govt too, but sometimes its hard to tell what's a legitimate issue, and what's just a bunch of people jumping at every opportunity to criticize the government.   There are genuine Constitutional issues at play here, and states, rightly, don't want to accede to the government the ability to impose its every demand, willy nilly.  There are states that determine things differently than other states, and that diversity (honestly) allows for Americans of all stripes to find places they want to be the most.  If you believe that abortion is murder, then you can move to somewhere like Texas, which lets you fit in better.  Believe that marijuana should be legal for recreational use? Colorado might be the place to go (now more places, obviously).  Etc., etc.    If the idea that there can only be one right answer to any issue, and that one right answer is always going to come from the federal government is not true, then we should respect state's rights.  If we accept that argument as true, then we should rebel against them.  Pre-FDR, this would have been automatically unconstitutional. Nowadays, the Constitution is read differently.  Not everyone agrees on how we should read it, and that's okay, but limiting choice should rarely be Plan A."

newhampshire,2xiri8,im_eddie_snowden,6,Sun Mar 1 13:45:16 2015 UTC,"Most of the cable was laid during the dot com bubble, TDS just came and did some small extensions and lit it up."
newhampshire,2xiri8,ohples,5,Sun Mar 1 15:14:04 2015 UTC,Municipal broadband.
newhampshire,2xiri8,tommysmuffins,2,Sun Mar 1 13:05:57 2015 UTC,And you thought comcast was expensive I bet. We can't plow the streets without running a deficit. How do you think that's going to work out?
newhampshire,2xiri8,dave603,3,Sun Mar 1 22:42:42 2015 UTC,"Municipal broadband pricing covers the cost of the deployment, connections, and upkeep.  In many of the communities where it has been deployed, the service has been very successful in providing affordable, faster internet service.  I'm not saying it's always wildly successful, but I can tell you Comcast and friends wouldn't be spending money lobbying against it with state legislatures if it was no threat."
newhampshire,2xiri8,tommysmuffins,1 point,Sun Mar 1 23:03:38 2015 UTC,"I'm sure Comcast and friends would be against anyone else running into their show.  I'm just not very sure a local government can provide the same services at any cheaper cost, while supplying the same service.  Don't get me wrong, I would love it if someone could shut down the rip off cable and satellite companies."
newhampshire,2xiri8,dave603,0,Mon Mar 2 01:20:44 2015 UTC,"Is this even a monopoly? From what it says here, it's just use of the rights of way. Unless the franchise agreement is exclusive of other providers, I don't see how that's granting a monopoly. One has arisen for economic reasons, but aside from muni broadband, I don't see a way for the city to address that. Large-scale market failures like that have to be addressed at the state or federal level. The town likely can't force Comcast to lease its lines, for instance."

I've been paying too much attention to getting all the snow off my house to pay attention to the shed.  I would shovel off the driveway, deck, a little bit of the back yard, and the edges of the house and run out of gas.  Its exhausting shoveling that much snow.  Even with all that effort I still have a few drips in my addition and a small leak in the bathroom window.

Edit: To keep the calcium in place you can pour them into cheap knee high panty hose and make sausages with them. Lay them perpendicular to your eave line so as it melts through you'll get channels for the water to drain off your roof instead of backing up behind the ice and under your shingles. It works amazingly even in cold temps, and if you get a warmer or sunny day it's that much faster. As it melts through you can just keep moving the sausages over to melt through new sections."

Another argument in favor of the downeaster, the seats are much more comfortable, and there's 110 at every pair of seats.   The downside, there's only 1 train down in the morning and two back in the evening. But the commuter rail is my backup for the times when I'm stuck in the office."

I, pointing out the flaw in that argument, linked to published research claiming a relationship between vaccines and autism.  There is no more scientific consensus (or anywhere near) to support the notion that circumcision has any correlation with autism than there is that vaccines cause autism. You were being intellectually dishonest at best.   All I did was mock calling a supported claim by an expert ridiculous.   So then you wouldn't dismiss a claim by an expert that vaccines cause autism? Give me a break. Of course you would. I just linked to one."

newhampshire,2wysis,Mr_Weebles,7,Tue Feb 24 18:41:18 2015 UTC,"Nontherapeutic/""preventative"" circumcision is a cultural body modification that is only considered therapeutic medicine for historical cultural reasons. The surgery is going to be viewed as increasingly unethical as information about the functional nature of the foreskin proliferates, which is probably going to make it even more of a magnet for lawsuits than it already is.  If New Hampshire does defund nontherapeutic infant circumcision under Medicaid, it will be the 17th state to have done so.    Circumcision is a tradition based on ignorance. Most people are unaware that the foreskin is a sensory structure and valued part of penile sensitivity. Unfortunately scientists did not start doing research demonstrating the sensorial value of the foreskin until around the 1990s (Sorrells, 2007; Taylor, 1996; Meislahn & Taylor, 2004; Podnar, 2012; Bensley & Boyle, 2001; Bronselaer, 2013; Cold & McGrath, 1999; Crosby & Charnigo, 2013). Quoting Van Howe (2013):   Anatomically, the foreskin is highly erogenous, pentalaminar, specialized, junctional (transitional) tissue. Other transitional tissues in the body include the lips and eyelids. These transitional tissues all have a high concentration of fine-touch neuroreceptors at the junction of internal (mucosal) surfaces with external (epidermal) surfaces. [The junction area feels like the primary focal point of the penis. The junction area after the surgery is the surgical scar instead of the foreskin.] In the 19th century, physicians, recognizing that the foreskin was the most sensitive portion of the penis, recommended its removal as a ""cure"" for masturbation. Only recently was the ridged band of the prepuce, which is completely removed by circumcision, identified as containing nearly all of the penis's fine-touch neuroreceptors.   More recently numerous medical organizations outside of the US have endorsed the fact that the foreskin is an important sensory structure of the penis. In 2009 the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia wrote that the foreskin ""is rich in specialized sensory nerve endings and erogenous tissue. Circumcision is painful, and puts the patient at risk for complications ranging from minor, as in mild local infections, to more serious such as injury to the penis, meatal stenosis, urinary retention, urinary tract infection and, rarely, even hemorrhage leading to death."" In 2010, the Royal Dutch Medical Association stated that the foreskin is ""a complex, erotogenic structure that plays an important role in the mechanical function of the penis during sexual acts, such as penetrative intercourse and masturbation"". The Royal Australasian College of Physicians wrote, ""The foreskin has two main functions. Firstly it exists to protect the glans penis. Secondly the foreskin is a primary sensory part of the penis, containing some of the most sensitive areas of the penis."" The Danish Medical Association (Lægeforeningen) and Danish Society of Family Physicians (Dansk Selskab for Almen Medicin) have recommended non-therapeutic male circumcision should wait until the boy or young man is old enough to provide informed consent. Circumcision which is not medically indicated is a mutilation and a violation and should be restricted to being performed with consent. The British Medical Association informational literature states: ""It is now widely accepted, including by the BMA, that this surgical procedure has medical and psychological risks. … Very similar arguments are also used to try and justify very harmful cultural procedures, such as female genital mutilation or ritual scarification. Furthermore, the harm of denying a person the opportunity to choose not to be circumcised must also be taken into account, together with the damage that can be done to the individual’s relationship with his parents and the medical profession if he feels harmed by the procedure. … Parental preference alone is not sufficient justification for performing a surgical procedure on a child."" Representing Danish, Estonian, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish clinical sexologists, in 2013 the Nordic Association of Clinical Sexology stated:   The penile foreskin is a natural and integral part of the normal male genitalia. The foreskin has a number of important protective and sexual functions. It protects the penile glans against trauma and contributes to the natural functioning of the penis during sexual activity. Ancient historic accounts and recent scientific evidence leave little doubt that during sexual activity the foreskin is a functional and highly sensitive, erogenous structure, capable of providing pleasure to its owner and his potential partners.  As clinical sexologists, we are concerned about the human rights aspects associated with the practice of non-therapeutic circumcision of young boys. To cut off the penile foreskin in a boy with normal, healthy genitalia deprives him of his right to grow up and make his own informed decision. Unless there are compelling medical reasons to operate before a boy reaches an age and a level of maturity at which he is capable of providing informed consent, the decision to alter the appearance, sensitivity and functionality of the penis should be left to its owner, thus upholding his fundamental rights to protection and bodily integrity.  Every person's right to bodily integrity goes hand in hand with his or her sexual autonomy."
newhampshire,2wysis,dalkon,2,Wed Feb 25 06:53:29 2015 UTC,"Right, so restrict the funding to when it's medically necessary or recommended."
newhampshire,2wysis,throwawayNewH,3,Wed Feb 25 14:39:14 2015 UTC,"Right. And to be clear, that is exactly what they have been discussing. No one has ever been considering defunding circumcision that is actually medically indicated. They are only considering defunding non-therapeutic/cultural circumcision. Circumcisions that are medically indicated are still covered by Medicaid in all of the states that have defunded non-therapeutic/cultural/""medical"" circumcision.  Medically indicated foreskin excision is the only time that it is medical in the usual sense of the word, where medical can be used honestly and without the quotation marks to indicate the word is not being used as expected. To explain this seemingly bizarre nomenclature, non-therapeutic circumcision is also termed ""medical"" to denote the surgery is performed by a medical professional rather than a religious figure. That is obviously not the normal meaning of the word medical. Unfortunately many if not most people mistakenly assume the word medical in reference to circumcision means that it is medically indicated. The mistaken impulse is perfectly understandable because that is the normal meaning of the term. This is actually a key part of the problem. Sorry to explain a point that might have been perfectly obvious to you, but this nomenclature seems to confuse most people, so it's worth explaining for others even if you already understood."
newhampshire,2wysis,dalkon,5,Wed Feb 25 23:12:25 2015 UTC,"Made my day.  Forcing a circumcision for some kind of preconceived opinion is twisted on its own, but it is infuriating how medicaid essentially endorses it.  Society is moving in the right direction, even if it's one step at a time."

Hanover is indeed lovely, with nice access to the northern part of the state and to Vermont, but still under two hours from Hillsborough and Massachusetts. Many of those towns along 89 are delightful. New London is absolutely splendid and regularly on those ""best place to live"" lists. The school system is top-notch. My aunt has been a 5th grade teacher in the KRSD for about twenty years now and both of her children went through the school system (and on to top schools). I worked in the school district for a short time and loved the care that they put into developing kind, well-rounded children who are independent learners. There are also lots of music, theater, and sports options in the area, so whatever your children wind up being into, there will be opportunities. New London is filled with people from all over New England (lots of people who work remotely, like yourself, or commute down to Greater Boston just a couple days a week). From both Hanover and New London there is a direct bus to Boston, which can be a nice perk if you ever need it. In terms of bars/restaurants, there are a few good spots in town and it's about a half hour down to Concord or up to Hanover or Lebanon, which all offer some good options! I currently live in the Lakes Region, but if I had to pick another spot in the state, it would either be New London or somewhere north of the White Mountains.  My parents live near Dover and seem to enjoy that area quite a bit. It's a pretty ""young and hip"" community because of UNH and it's definitely a mixed community (a lot like Keene), with students, folks who are struggling a lot, and people who are moving in to take advantage of the social environment."

newhampshire,2wte0d,i_love_oedipus_mom,3,Mon Feb 23 04:00:56 2015 UTC,"There's also Henniker. Very small town, but it has a college and a few restaurants. It's also the home of Pat's Peak. It's VERY close to Hillsboro, but also only about 20 minutes from Concord, and a half hour away from Keene.   It's also in a very good spot, weather-wise. We never seem to get hit hard with any of the storms that have come around. When the power went out on Thanksgiving, we had it back after 24 hours, whereas other places were out for days."
newhampshire,2wte0d,i_love_oedipus_mom,3,Mon Feb 23 18:04:45 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll definitely check it out. My wife will be happy to look for places that close to her family.

The Mount Washington Valley is an excellent place to raise a family, I am a bit biased because I grew up there.  I currently live in Hanover and it is not bad, definitely a great town, but if I had to raise a family and had my pick of any town in NH, it would probably be Jackson."

newhampshire,2wte0d,jcyr,8,Tue Feb 24 02:33:31 2015 UTC,"I've lived in Dover and it's alright, but it's not super quaint.  It's sort of overrun by college students and hipsters.  From what I understand, the bar scene is a bit rowdy.  I wouldn't say the restaurant scene is really great in Dover.  The thing that bothered me the most about living in Dover was the messed up traffic in the downtown area.  Not sure if it matters to you, but you will be about 1.5 hours away from Hillsborough.  Of course, Hanover will be about an hour away too.  I can't really give any advice about living in Hanover or Keene.    I would say that if you're interested in good restaurants and nice bars, then Manchester and Portsmouth are the towns I would recommend.  Towns that are known for good school systems would be Durham, Lee, Madbury, Portsmouth, Exeter, Bedford, Windham, and Bow...   I can try to answer other questions you have!  Good luck."
newhampshire,2wte0d,PigBoyOhBoy,2,Sat Mar 28 06:06:12 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for your comments! Looks like I have some more towns to research!
newhampshire,2wte0d,JumpyBlueberry,2,Mon Feb 23 00:44:43 2015 UTC,I really like downtown Dover.
newhampshire,2wte0d,mrjackspade,1 point,Mon Feb 23 01:13:20 2015 UTC,"Second that Dover is not quintessentially quaint. More of a recovering mill town going through an awkward phase - lots of interesting stuff, but from personal experience I would look at the first five towns on /u/ejtnjin's list before Dover (I don't really know Bedford, Windham, and Bow). Those are all sweet towns, good schools, restaurants, etc."
newhampshire,2wte0d,temporary_boner,3,Mon Feb 23 03:19:40 2015 UTC,"I had a similar situation...  computer consultant, coming from Baltimore, and landed in Alton Bay.  Low tax rate and ability to find some property were my keys.    Nothing in NH is very far, especially if youre used to somewhere else that you have to travel a half hour to get to no matter how far it is.  Metrocast gives me 35MB ... not fiber speeds by any means, but workable."
newhampshire,2wte0d,jenoboyle,2,Mon Feb 23 01:40:01 2015 UTC,Do you know how the school systems are in Alton Bay? Seems like there are a decent number of remote tech workers here in this thread alone.  Thanks!
newhampshire,2wte0d,Greenautobus,2,Mon Feb 23 01:42:13 2015 UTC,I've been pretty happy with the schools -- Prospect Mountain High School (hosts both Alton and Barnstead) and  Alton Central (k-8) have been pretty good for both kids (I have one in each).  ACS is in the processes of remodeling and repair -- very much needed.  PM is 10 years old.
newhampshire,2wte0d,wateverdOOd,2,Mon Feb 23 20:31:12 2015 UTC,"It would help to maybe know a bit more. Why NH? What draws you here?  Why Keene, Hanover and Dover?"
newhampshire,2wte0d,joels4321,2,Tue Feb 24 01:58:56 2015 UTC,"My wife has family there and I grew up in NE. I love Mass but I'm not sure I'd like to move back there. I like smaller towns with a nice history. Also the school systems are a big draw. Florida has terrible school systems and from what I've been reading there are nice school systems in NH.   I like Keene, Dover, and Hanover because I was reading about the towns from a ""top NH towns list"". While its probably a very biased list they seemed nice. The pictures of the towns looked beautiful and had that ""feel"" that were looking for.   I know that doesn't explain much but hopefully you know where I'm coming from."
newhampshire,2wte0d,joels4321,2,Mon Feb 23 00:48:42 2015 UTC,"You will see Portsmouth at the top of most lists. Worth looking into. Great tech scene, culture, food/drink, etc. Housing is expensive though. Some of the best schools in the state. Worth adding to your list for evaluation.  When are you coming up to evaluate?"
newhampshire,2wte0d,joels4321,2,Mon Feb 23 01:19:14 2015 UTC,Also I know schools are important to you so here is a rank of top 50. Skip to the last slides for top 10. http://wmur.com/news/30456516  Edit: I live in Portsmouth and know folks rave on schools here. Our kids will be going in a couple of years. I have no idea how accurate this list is however.
newhampshire,2wte0d,mbrousseau,2,Mon Feb 23 14:24:35 2015 UTC,"I think you will find Hanover to be very agreeable, as there is a sizable population of telecommuters who call it home (as I once did). I eventually left the software biz, did a career switch and stayed in the area. I'll stay here until the kids are through high school then probably relocate to some cheaper real estate in a nearby community."
newhampshire,2wte0d,bigfike,2,Mon Feb 23 22:09:15 2015 UTC,Dover is a nice town but as others have said lots of college kids. Not a great restaurant selection but some good places and close enough to  Portsmouth that you always have options. The bar scene is pretty good a few rowdy places but you can find some nice ones. Traffic in downtown is a bit frustrating but you get used to it. Nice school system including a high school with a career tech center which gives students a lot of interesting class options. Overall a nice town that I definitely enjoyed living in.
newhampshire,2wte0d,Sqwirl,2,Mon Feb 23 01:28:52 2015 UTC,"I'm loving where I am on the Manchester/Hookset border. Nice and quiet, but only a short trip into manch, or concord."
newhampshire,2wte0d,joels4321,2,Mon Feb 23 01:41:07 2015 UTC,"Concord is 25 min from Hillsborough and is a great city for a family. Small enough to be quaint but big enough for things to do-- nice restaurants, things going on at night (for the most part), fun winter and summer activities downtown for the family to take part in.   Let me know if you have any more questions (about concord, at least!)"
newhampshire,2wte0d,nietoattacks,2,Mon Feb 23 02:52:54 2015 UTC,"I just moved to Concord in November, and I think it is the most perfect all around town. I'm 23 and there is always something for me to do here. Restaurants and bars are great and close to the mountains and not far from the beaches. I could totally see myself raising a family here one day!"

newhampshire,2wte0d,Nellisir,3,Mon Feb 23 21:41:59 2015 UTC,"Milford might be your best bet, not as expensive as the other towns in that area and pretty quaint with a nice little diner and a good town oval/public festivals"
newhampshire,2wte0d,Jalapeno_Business,1 point,Sun Mar 1 00:46:26 2015 UTC,"Not the best school district.  Schools kinds seem outdated and theres not much academic opportunities (source: went to 3 highschools, milford was one of them). Milford just gave me an overall weird feeling, ive lived there at two different points in life. Besides the schools it is very nice"
newhampshire,2wte0d,Nellisir,4,Sun Mar 1 01:40:45 2015 UTC,"Small world. I grew up in MA (Marlboro/Framingham) and also recently lived in FL. About 7 years ago I moved to Keene and couldn't be happier. Keene has a really great and vibrant downtown Main street that is quintessential New England. It's great for walking around Spring/Summer/Fall with restaurants, coffee shops, stores, etc. I don't think there's a vacant storefront in the whole downtown. I can't recommend Keene enough.   My wife has lived here her whole life, and she's loves it too. We're likely a little older (early 50's) than you are but it's a great city. There's enough big box stores around for most shopping needs, car dealers, etc. There are some nice parks, swimming holes and of course Keene State College (college kids help keep a community young too). Mount Monadnock is around the corner for hiking, so is Vermont for skiing and their offerings.  My only reservation is that Boston and Framingham are each about two hours away, and other friends in Nashua/Manchester are about 75-90 mins away.  I'm happy to answer any questions, good luck in your search!"
newhampshire,2wte0d,magnusholmfast,2,Mon Feb 23 01:19:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks a ton! I grew up in Rehoboth and then had to move to Florida so I've been longing for NE living again pretty much since day 1 here. I also want my kids to experience growing up in NE, I think they'd be much happier overall (not that they're not happy kids already of course).  I'm definitely going to continue looking in Keene. Seems like everyone is so emphatic about where they live I'll probably have to pick a top 5 and go by schools/real estate. Or just put them all up on a dart board and close my eyes!"
newhampshire,2wte0d,gnilmit,3,Mon Feb 23 20:22:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there really are a lot of good choices in the areas you're targeting. I think depending on where in FL you're coming from, your kids will have a much, much better upbringing in NE than in FL.  A lot of folks dump on the towns with colleges but I think they really help a town. I lived in Boston for years, as much a big time college town as you could have, and I loved it. Colleges I think really help areas stay vibrant, alive and much safer. Rapists, murderers and stick-up men generally aren't in college - drunk and sometimes loud college kids are. I felt safer on the streets of Boston late at night than I did in many smaller cities with those kids. They're not what I'm afraid of at 1am, trust me. But enough about that.  Good luck with your choice or your dartboard, I really don't think you'll miss either way.  (of course did we mention snow? oy vey)"
newhampshire,2wte0d,magnusholmfast,3,Mon Feb 23 01:27:10 2015 UTC,"We're surrounded on all sides by (what was) the pill capital of the country. While we live in a nice neighborhood, but it's still really close to places I wouldn't want my kids going when they're older.  All the houses are the same crap block houses with no originality. We're definitely not talking the beaches/touristy parts of Florida.  I don't think I'd mind much about living in a college town. We're both still in our 20's so it would probably make it way easier for us to meet other people to hang out with.  Snow? Is that the weird rain that falls every so often?"
newhampshire,2wte0d,gnilmit,2,Mon Feb 23 20:28:39 2015 UTC,"That's funny, I lived in Delray Beach and we had pill rehab houses all around us, and like you a pretty short distance to some really sketchy areas.  I think if you see Keene in the spring/summer you'd really like it. The downtown is such a walkable place, wife and I go 3-4 times a week weather permitting.  Good luck man!"
newhampshire,2wte0d,magnusholmfast,2,Mon Feb 23 20:54:22 2015 UTC,"I lived in Rehoboth when I was very young, Agricultural Avenue. It's a very, very expensive place to live now."
newhampshire,2wte0d,cosmolaika,-1,Mon Feb 23 20:59:25 2015 UTC,That goes to show you everyone has different priorities and tastes. I am moving away from Keene this week and could not be happier.  I hate it here.  Mainly because of how boring it is and how stupid everyone is.

newhampshire,2wu1ro,ANewMachine615,0,Thu Feb 26 00:02:04 2015 UTC,"I fundamentally disagree with your definition of ""intruding in peoples' lives,"" and I happen to think that business is a fair sight more dangerous, day-to-day, than government is in terms of ""intruding"".  I also don't appreciate the cynicism of moving to a place solely to take advantage of its fragile democratic institutions. Stuff like the FSP is why hyper-democratic, hobbyist government like ours are the exception, not the norm. It's so easy to abuse for a concerted, active minority, regardless of the wishes of the majority. We'd gotten along fine for years without that abuse due to the culture of the state.

They grow trees for re-forestation, for city and town plantings, etc. Old school forward looking land management.  Edit: Sigh. Yes, taxes, and their pricing is in fact comparable to commercial bulk rates for bare root seedlings. I don't know the ins-and-outs of their profitability. I do know that every seedling I plant is going to provide food for my family, my neighbors, and wildlife (some of which will also become food for my family and my neighbors). Each plant will locally reduce erosion, improve the quality of both surface and ground water - I have a well, and two different towns draw water from the river at the foot of my hill. Each plant will improve the topsoil on my property and on the properties of my downhill neighbors, will improve air quality, will protect the surrounding environment from temperature extremes, will serve as wind, snow, and sound barriers, and will generally improve local environmental health and quality of living for decades. This investment will continue to benefit the citizens of my area long after I'm dead and gone. As a property owner (and therefor taxpayer), it seems like a fine way for the state to be using my money. I'm all for it."

Here is my experience as someone who did this over a year ago (that's important, you will see why):  I switched to North American Power about a year ago after receiving something in the mail advertising their prices and offering a $50 prepaid card as an incentive. At that time, their price was about a cent or more cheaper per KWH so it seemed to be a good deal. It took about 3 months for the switch to take place and I enjoyed the cheaper rate of $0.07589 for 12 months. When the 12 months was nearing completion I got a letter about renewing my contract. I'll called them up and they informed me their new ""great"" rate was going to be 0.12/KWH. They said the price was higher because rates were going up but I should lock in now at 0.12. Well, this was more expensive than PSNH so I said I would not like to renew and I would like to switch back to PSNH.  The only problem? Well it still takes three months to switch, and during those three months they take you to the cleaners. I have payed rates of 0.13 and 0.17 over the past two months! I'm hoping they don't screw me and ""forget"" to have my service cancelled, but unfortunately only time will tell. At 17 cents per KWH during a winter month, that almost erases all my savings from the previous 12 months. I can't wait for it to be over.

newhampshire,2wot5n,asdffdddmdmdmd,3,Sun Feb 22 17:28:31 2015 UTC,"Here is what I found confusing.  I was raised in NH but have since moved to Arizona.  You would think Arizona would be awash in solar energy projects (300+ sunny days in Phoenix) but no.  It is very hard for the multiple companies that push solar to get Arizonians to bite on the solar bandwagon.  Why is that?  It is because someone other than the home owner is reaping the benefits of solar energy.  If solar was good for me, believe me I would be all over it.  Back to my NH roots.  I was amazed at the amount of solar panels in northern NH on my trip back east last summer.  How and why do a lot of these businesses north of Lancaster have solar panels erected in their yards?  You and I both know that the amount of sunny days in northern NH could almost be counted on your fingers and toes so how is this profitable or good for the businesses that implement it?  Methinks it has to be the NH tax payer that is funding these installations. Am I wrong?"
newhampshire,2wot5n,DevilsAle,2,Sun Feb 22 04:04:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar at all with solar power markets, subsidies and government rebates at all, but I think this site has a lot of the answers to your question.

It removes the incentive by redirecting all seized funds to the state's general fund, and lessens the cases in which it can be used at all. Good, in my opinion.  There's another element that this doesn't address, though. Civil forfeiture is often used to deny defendants the ability to hire specific counsel by seizing their assets pre-trial. This bill would not fix that.   The bill, House Bill 636, would allow the police to continue seizing property, but would require a conviction for it to be forfeited permanently   Emphasis mine. There has to be some way to allow cash out to go to pay for an attorney for the defendant, at least in cases other than theft, fraud, etc. where some person other than the government might have a claim to the funds."

Most newer houses are built to accommodate snow loads that are quite high for their area. If you're very worried, try maybe calling a town building inspector or your local Fire Dept, they may be able to give you a good idea how worried you should be.  Also, don't forget the old ice melt and nylons trick, it can help cut channels through your ice dam for melted snow and rain to run through."

There's a video at the link below which is a good example of one way to make them: (http://makezine.com/2015/02/05/blizzard-hacks-build-a-clever-avalanche-roof-rake/)  I make one based on that video for around $40 in materials from home depot ($10 aluminum bar, $3 threaded rod, $14 tarp, $8 furniture sliders, and assorted hardware) and attached it to poles I had from my old roof rake. Works great.  Edit: as an FYI, the commercial versions of this style of roof rake go for around $150"

newhampshire,2wbm2o,ullrsdream,2,Thu Feb 19 00:02:25 2015 UTC,The enforcers of laws have a strong voice for valid input in the promulgation of laws that need to be enforced.  Conflicts of interest aren't something to be avoided by prohibition so much as disclosure. We already know their biases and can factor that into their input.   The influence is more a weakness of the legislator than an issue with the voice of the enforcers.
newhampshire,2wbm2o,ullrsdream,3,Thu Feb 19 19:54:30 2015 UTC,"No, this is an issue that the voice of the enforcers is so loud that it drowns out the people being enforced.   Legislators are there to craft laws that the People want. Rules and regulations that (theoretically) the majority of constituents feel that everyone in society should adhere to.   Law enforcement is there to enforce those rules and regulations, not to help craft them beyond consultation about implementation issues.   It's exactly like giving the military one of the loudest voices about who to go to war with and when. Please see WWI if you have any questions about the outcome of that scenario.  The police are getting to decide who to arrest, for how long, and then get a massive influence on sentencing guidelines. Is it any surprise that they're against changing laws that offer up low-hanging fruit to be arrested?   We need to stop being tough on criminals and start being tough on crime and its causes, and Law Enforcement lobbying groups have come out again and again against such reform."

If you're in the right areas, you can get fiber services from local telcos (like GSC) or from FairPoint as their ""FAST"" service.  Other than that, you're looking at DSL or wireless/satellite."

newhampshire,2wd4n2,lumberjack5500,2,Thu Feb 19 01:04:22 2015 UTC,"A few years ago, Fairpoint purchased phone and Internet infrastructure in ME/VT/NH from Verizon.  For most of this area, they only offer DSL for Internet service.  In some area, including Portsmouth and some surrounding area, they offer fiber Internet service. I live in Greenland, and am not a Comcast Xfinity fan. I determined that I am, in fact, in an area served by Fairpoint's fiber Internet, so I went this route, and have DirecTV for the TV side of things.  I am pretty happy with this set-up, but here are some things that I noticed...  Fairpoint fiber Internet customer service, while friendly and local (in Portland, ME, I think) are pretty clueless.  Sometimes you get someone good, sometimes not.  I am in a new development on a new street, and had to call four times before they were able to say yes, they can install the service, and make an appointment.  At the end of call three, I hung up after the rep told me I can't get service.  Just can't be done, even though a house a few hundred feet away had access to fiber.  Since I didn't like that answer, I called back the next day and got someone that wasn't clueless.    Service is fairly cheap compared to Comcast.  Speeds aren't as high as Comcast, but the advertised maximum throughput isn't the only factor in good Internet service. I also get low latency (aka good ping times.).    I really like DirecTV.  Their latest cable box technology is pretty good - far better than my Comcast garbage DVR."
newhampshire,2wd4n2,LouisTully,2,Sat Feb 21 22:13:34 2015 UTC,Xfinity is unfortunateiy vastly superior to Fairpoint in most areas with both speed and customer service. Fairpoint is basically leasing lines from Verizon or some other company which makes getting service a bit of a middle man hassle.  Yes I just said comcast has better service than someone else... Dear god.

My heart goes out to those that knew her, and I hope future hikers can learn from this. Given that she had a beacon, I expect she was an experienced hiker who had done her best to be ready for whatever could be thrown at her, but in the year 2015 and for the forseeable future, no one is more powerful than the elements.  Always be ready to spend a night, and check the forecast so you know what that night can bring.  By all means, push yourself and take risks, but manage those risks in a way that brings you and those you're with back safely.   May Kate Matrosova rest in peace."

newhampshire,2w30qs,katieshineh,4,Mon Feb 16 23:28:23 2015 UTC,Yeah we will do one next week

If Verizon already deployed fiber where you are, then its management has passed on to Fairpoint.  If not, then Fairpoint has no plans to expand their fiber operations.  Sucks, but that's how it is."

newhampshire,2w2cb2,tommysmuffins,1 point,Wed Feb 18 14:06:01 2015 UTC,I didn't know that.  I wonder why they didn't do it in Nashua - seems like there would be a lot of very profitable neighborhoods as candidates.
newhampshire,2w2cb2,DieCommieScum,2,Wed Feb 18 14:14:07 2015 UTC,"That's pretty common with fiber rollouts, the population density makes it more difficult to run line and the larger the municipality the more red tape usually. I had it in a small town on a road made up mostly of horse property."
newhampshire,2w2cb2,tommysmuffins,1 point,Wed Feb 18 21:09:38 2015 UTC,"I'm sure that's true, but you'd think the increased profitability of having hundreds of houses within a square mile or so neighborhood would more than make up for the downside."
newhampshire,2w2cb2,twobithacker,2,Wed Feb 18 22:09:14 2015 UTC,"Depending on the town, you might be able to get fiber service from one of the smaller telcos.

newhampshire,2w2cb2,perfectbebop,2,Mon Feb 16 14:18:43 2015 UTC,"Verizon sold its residential business to Fairpoint ~2006/2007 with a fiber non-compete in the contract (don't know the duration of the non-compete). Since then Fairpoints faced a lot of issues and scrutiny in being able to maintain their existing New England infrastucture and almost went bankrupt in the process. Fios is available on the seacoast in at least business class format.

Look, they even have graphs!  In color!""  You do realize how much money and power is wrapped up in this issue, right?  That oil company marginal losses (as oil is still used for a shitload more than fuel) is a drop in the bucket compared to the trillions to be made by Wall St, London, and Frankfurt in carbon trading along with the acquisition and centralization of sweeping global political power to be had.  And that these are the very same interests who issued those reports?  I've seen the splicing that is done on those data sets, the emails between top UK researches discussing the lack of warming in global data and the need to ""adjust it"".  You have probably never seen where the money for this research is coming from, the research its self, or the mountains of data from other scientists showing how any trends in global temp data follow the solar cycle, not atmospheric gas composition....with correlations going back centuries in tree ring data and other sources.  You probably never saw (I have) the data used to construct the original ""hockey stick"" graph that was spliced from several data sets....including the must critical ""historical"" one cherry picked from Western European tree ring data because it was the only set out of hundreds that showed a level trend (the rest showed a dropping trend from a high that exceeded current temps and clearly showed a several-century cycle that followed....wait for it.....the sun).  The Renaissance its self was largely caused by a great warm period after the Middle Ages that led to prosperity (largely through agriculture) that exceeded even today's productivity.  Records about cattle ranges in Greenland and winemaking in the UK showed tremendous warmth that disappeared in the 17th through 18th centuries and returned in the recent one as we went into another warm solar cycle (that is ending....re: the recent geomagnetic storm increases).  But forget all that.  The UN swears they're right and we just need to give them the power to tax the globe.    Believe whomever you wish.  I've done the research and I stand with many, many scientists, historians, and anthropologists that this is nothing but a game of social engineering chess with those who refuse to study it for themselves."
newhampshire,2w34zm,Mr_Weebles,3,Wed Feb 18 23:52:25 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say ""freak out"", but yeah I find these weather patterns unusual and indicative of something big going on.  But the issue with climate change is that it isn't a matter of opinion.  Like vaccinations, it doesn't matter if you believe in the number six.  You can count "" 4,5,7,8..."" and live your life that way.  It doesn't mean that six doesn't exist.  There was a time when people didn't believe the Earth orbited the Sun, or that gravity existed.  Climate change is not a matter of opinion.  It is an empirically supported fact, and needs to be treated as such.  To quote Neil Degrasse Tyson, “What I’m saying is, when different experiments give you the same result, it is no longer subject to your opinion. That’s the good thing about science: It’s true whether or not you believe in it. That’s why it works.”"
newhampshire,2w34zm,g3wd,3,Tue Feb 17 13:11:17 2015 UTC,"Well, as someone who actually does science for a living and doesn't just get my knowledge of it from public commentators, climate change is NOT in any way related to experimental science.  There are no experiments being done.  No one is modifying the gasses in the atmosphere and observing the changes over long periods of time.  There are not ""repeatable results"".  What is going on is a massive quantity of politically-connected money is observing a very, very complex system and, while they still don't know what is going to happen, they're damn sure that it involves lots of taxes and economic controls....oh, and anyone who disagrees is worthy of mockery.    They have been caught lamenting the lack of warming in data and discussing fixing it.  Multiple times.  Their predictions about sea ice, snow cover, sea level, overall warming trends, and others have fallen FLAT ON THEIR FACE.  We're far enough into it now to know that most of what was presented to the public in forms such as ""Inconvenient Truth"" was largely bullshit.    The scientific community is not exactly sure how gravity works, what light is, precisely why the center of the earth is so hot, where life came from, and lately aren't even sure if the universe is expanding anymore (the original red-shift researchers came out with a paper recently saying some of the results may have been due to optical errors).   Stop perpetuating the bullshit idea that just because someone with a degree and a big salary of government money said ""this is true and everyone who disagrees is an idiot"" that they're right.  The study of complex systems is VERY fluid and the ""scientific body's"" assumptions about anything are usually eventually proven wrong.  This is a political issue, not a scientific one.  The data is not showing the anticipated global temperature increases and every recent weather pattern is well within historical norms.  You people are complete lemmings."
newhampshire,2w34zm,Whyb52,4,Wed Feb 18 19:58:02 2015 UTC,"as someone who actually does science for a living   Way to condescend.  Just because I'm not performing a hard science doesn't mean I don't science too, or anyone else on here.  Don't assume about people.  That's like saying we don't understand the life cycle of a star because we've never witnessed one in it's entirety.  There's a mountain of evidence in support of it, not the least of which is the continually extreme weather patterns we're seeing regularly.  Drought, hurricanes, winter storms, these things are ramping up at an alarming rate.  Also, the whole point of having a degree is to signify you can be trusted in your field of study.  I'm not saying it means someone without the degree can't know more, but if you have one you better know what the hell you're talking about.  It's both political and scientific, because whether or not our atmosphere is behaving in a certain manner is absolutely an issue of science.  The only part that's political is when the government starts crying Christianity, which is another problem entirely.  I'd be happy to throw up links as supporting evidence, but I need to go to class.  edit: Link to NdGT's latest and greatest"
newhampshire,2w34zm,KingBuzzell,2,Wed Feb 18 20:33:53 2015 UTC,Did the fewer amount of snowstorms last winter make you less freaked out about climate change?  Of course not. What a stupid question.
newhampshire,2w34zm,HazardousWeather,-2,Tue Feb 17 00:42:53 2015 UTC,"Not really.  A friend brought up the warmth and lack of snow two months ago as some kind of evidence of it, but I knew the overall models predicted a nasty winter.  Sure enough, he now has several feet of snow and one of the coldest winters we have had in quite a while...I've never seen such a consistent string of single digit temps.  Enough time has gone by since the predictions started that its becoming clear that if there is some systemic, man-made change going on.....no one has any idea what it is and how it works.  Period.  We were shown the hockey stick graphs, the emphatic statements about global, overall loss of snow coverage, ice coverage, winter intensity, etc.  The last two hurricane seasons have had abysmally-low Accumulated Energy Indices.   Antarctic sea ice was at its greatest extents since records were kept last summer.  So much for rising seas.  Global temperature changes have fallen well below the predictions they gave us.  The narrative is being constantly revised....once ""global warming"" and ""the end of winter as we know it"" to ""climate change....we might not really know how this plays out"" to now ""Crazy winters are really evidence of anthropogenic global warming"".  Really?    I think its becoming clear that this entire thing has more to do with Wall St. money and UN economic power plays than actual hard science.  I think the trillions to be made in carbon trading by high financiers are influencing the debate a bit more than actual satellite temperature data sets.  The problem with trying to predict the future is that, eventually, time will reveal if you were full of shit.  That's history's biggest inconvenient truth."

The roads are barely wide enough for two cars to go through, never mind adding in a pedestrian. Do everyone a favor and go to a park, or a road with sidewalks.  Pawtuckaway might be a good choice, although the main road for that park might not be plowed right now. Exeter itself has some pretty decent sidewalks, and with the downtown area set up the way it is it should be pretty easy to find a 2 mile loop that isn't in the middle of traffic.  Barring those, why not park at the Epping Walfart and run a mile down 125 and then back. Pretty decent area, and if you didn't want to hit the roads you could run around the plaza since it's pretty massive."

newhampshire,2vp6nj,Lefthandedmidget,3,Fri Feb 13 14:09:31 2015 UTC,It is very well known in Portsmouth that the police chief is anti conceal carry. It isn't always top priority for the references to respond immediately and there are no set concrete return dates stated on the forms sent out nor on the initial form filed by the applicant. The Portsmouth Police Chief has attempted to set up his own May issue in a shall issue state. But what citizen is going to spend vast amounts of money trying to fight this in court.

Unless there's a provision I'm missing."
newhampshire,2vp6nj,i_love_goats,7,Fri Feb 13 20:51:56 2015 UTC,"Anyone who can legally have a gun can already open carry without a permit, they just can't conceal it.  I highly doubt that that there is a large subset of people who would be willing to commit a crime, if only they could hide a gun on their person legally without a permit.   If they are already willing to commit a crime with a gun, I doubt they are going to care if they have a permit or not.  As for the bar, and someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe NH has restrictions on carrying at a bar which means a random drunk person could already open carry with no restriction, or could conceal with a permit."

Just get rid of the stupid permit, I've never had mine checked once, even one time at a gas station when I know two cops saw my pistol under my coat.

newhampshire,2vp6nj,Private_Part,1 point,Fri Feb 13 04:37:58 2015 UTC,Anyone have the breakdown of the practical outcome here?   Does it mean I don't need a permit to put my pistol in my glovebox?
newhampshire,2vp6nj,vorgain,16,Fri Feb 13 03:06:47 2015 UTC,It means you don't need a permit to wear a coat. It would also mean you don't need a permit to put your pistol in your glovebox or even out on the seat. All of those activities currently require a permit.
newhampshire,2vp6nj,capecodcaper,3,Fri Feb 13 03:08:56 2015 UTC,"If this bill passes in the House and Hassan doesn't veto it, you will no longer need a permit to conceal your loaded handgun.    Permits will still be available for the sake of reciprocity, and the State PO will have to ask any states NH doesn't have reciprocity with for reciprocity once every five years.  It also extends the life of the permit from four to five years."
newhampshire,2vp6nj,akmjolnir,2,Fri Feb 13 17:34:05 2015 UTC,I like that reciprocity part. We don't have a lot of agreements with other states. It's pretty disappointing

newhampshire,2vp6nj,dave603,2,Fri Feb 13 17:40:24 2015 UTC,Doesn't it cost $10 for a license to conceal anyway? It won't make much of a difference I think.
newhampshire,2vp6nj,And_Dan,31,Thu Feb 12 23:55:33 2015 UTC,Yeah it's only $10 for 4 years but it's more of a principle thing. If you're legally allowed to purchase a handgun you should legally allowed to carry it. There shouldn't be additional hoops to jump through to exercise a right.   Any one who is against this is just foolish. Vermont does not have carry permits and look at the rampant violent crime rates next door...
newhampshire,2vp6nj,DieCommieScum,17,Fri Feb 13 00:17:01 2015 UTC,"In NH you are legally allowed to carry it, just not concealed.  As one of the Senators said, shouldn't  make a difference if you put on a coat."
newhampshire,2vp6nj,5arge,8,Fri Feb 13 00:41:25 2015 UTC,"Oh I know. I suppose 'conceal it' would've been better wording. Personally, the only way I will ever carry a gun is concealed and I'm sure others feel the same way. No reason draw unneeded attention to yourself. I know I'm preaching to the choir, but eliminating the permitting requirement will coax more people to exercise their right."
newhampshire,2vp6nj,DieCommieScum,9,Fri Feb 13 02:00:57 2015 UTC,"Vehicle carry is huge, as it's fucking dumb having to unload when you get in a vehicle just to be lawful in the eyes of the empire. Where the existence of the permitting doesn't change who can and cannot lawfully own a gun, it's nothing more than a technicality for scum of the earth armed thugs with badges to trip people up with.   There is absolutely ZERO reason for permitting unless you go full retard like MA where it's required for mere possession and proof of training. We know what the reason is there."

The class was so full, that they skipped the part of the course where you actually handle a firearm and just gave everyone the test. So at least one full class of ""licensed"" armed MAssholes will have their card, but literally no experience holding, loading, unloading, or firing an actual firearm. What's the point in that?"

Mandating it by law? Absolute asshattery... for a number of reasons both philosophical and practical.   Very few states require it and we get along just fine. Bubba from a rural state who grew up shootin' ground hogs since he was 7 at is going to be far more competent with a firearm in most cases than some middle-aged Masshole who took a state mandated class before even being 'allowed' to ever own one.

There's a reason I specified violent crime rate and not total instances of violent crime. High school might have taught you that rates take into consideration variations in population. For example, NH has 2.15 instances of violent crime per 1,000 residents and VT only has 1.21 instances of crime per 1,000 residents. Yet VT does not have a carry permit. Of course it's impossible to relate the 2, but the lack of a carry permit is certainly not making their crime worse.   The total population and population density have absolutely nothing to do with what you're trying to prove."

newhampshire,2vnxcq,maskedmariqueen,6,Thu Feb 12 16:29:16 2015 UTC,"Current student here, about to graduate this semester. The comments are mostly right, besides the one person telling you what to do with your life. Don't listen to them. I'll try to tell you everything you may need to know, and then base your judgement off of that. But first, I have two questions for you;  1.) What are you planning on majoring in?   2.) And why are you looking into NHIA? Is it because it is local? Because that seems to be the case with a lot of students and might be a deciding factor for you.  I am a New Hampshire transplant, originally from the Philadelphia area, Pennsylvania. I attended a portfolio day in my senior year of school to get an idea of where my skills were, and what schools had to say. I stood in many lines and received average reviews, nothing spectacular, nothing horrible. I noticed a small table with a blue tablecloth over it labeled NHIA with no line, and figured I'd get a free portfolio review out of it, besides, why would I want to go all the way to NH for school and leave home? They ended up loving my work, I knew it was nothing spectacular, but they saw my potential. And it made me really excited, nothing none of the other schools did. So I figured, why not go visit at least. So we exchanged info and I decided to attend an open house. When I showed up for the open house the same person who reviewed my portfolio greeted me by name and was very excited to see me travel that far to visit the school. I got a really good feeling about this school, and its very lax acceptance constraints (no SAT requirement, no GPA requirement) made it easy for me to apply and get accepted being an average student out of high school.   I am a photography major, and a huge selling factor for me was their computer labs and darkrooms. Seriously, amazing. From what I've heard its on par or even better than MassArts and RISD(but I doubt that). But I'm not sure if thats what your area of study is. The photography teachers are all amazing. They all really care about the students and want you to create the best art possible. I know there are other teachers in other departments who care, but I hear my friends complain about their teachers semi-often, but no one really complains about the photo department.  I've also dormed all four years because getting an apartment so far from home for me didn't seem feasible, considering I didn't want to stay up here after college and had no clue what I was going to be doing. I've enjoyed the dorm experience. I'm in the nice one (rainbow building on lowell) and have been in the same room for four years. It's mostly quiet, no one really parties in the dorm since most upperclassmen have apartments and everyone just goes there. I'm not sure if you do party, but it was a pretty big concern for me. I wanted to make sure I was able to have fun. and I did. My freshman class was pretty insane, we partied pretty hard. But over the years the incoming classes have seemed to become more and more tame as the years have gone on and it's pretty sad. not sure where all the parties went. They're still there, they just seem to be on certain weekends.  I'm sorry, I'm kind of just rambling here. I'm not sure how I feel about this school to be honest, I came because I wanted to do photography, and had no other applicable real-world skills that I wanted to pursue straight out of high school. And this schools tuition was less than that of other art schools in the philadelphia/northeastern america, with just as good a studio as some of those really expensive art schools. I have made some of my best friends here, made some of the best art in my life so far here, and had some of the best times of my life so far here. But man, I personally jumped into this college thing without any idea really of the daunting financial aspect of it. I like photography for the sake of art and wanted to learn about it, and now that I am about the graduate my family is up my ass about what I'm going to do with my degree. I tell them I'm going to work, doing whatever I have to to pay the bills, and still take photographs because its what I love, and they don't seem to like that answer. Yet four years ago they all pretty much shoved me on the bus to New Hampshire telling me I had no other choice but to go to college. People will do anything they can to try to tell you what to do with your life, but you need to do what you love. There is so much potential in the field of art to do something big, and if you don't try you never know.   TL;DR- NHIA is a small little traditional art school, in a pretty shitty part of NH. If you love art for the sake of art and want to learn it, come here. I think it has a nice (sometimes too simple) undergrad program that I'm about to complete and be pretty proud of. Although its not doing too well financially it still has potential.   Please PM me if there are any specific questions you have. I kind of wish someone had done what I did for you, for me. I just spent the last four years and roughly a Porsches worth of money that I don't have on school here. So I felt it necessary to try and inform you enough to make some sort of a decision. I really do love this school, I'll be proud to put it on my resume but I'd be lying if I said it didn't have its issues."
newhampshire,2vnxcq,Trancefuzion,1 point,Thu Feb 12 21:39:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for your reply! I will be messaging you :]
newhampshire,2vnxcq,naardvark,7,Fri Feb 13 16:48:00 2015 UTC,"You might think I'm a dick, but the nicest thing anyone can do on here is tell you to skip art school.  It's a sham.  Outside of that, I know an instructor there and she says half the teachers care and the other half don't.  The students suck, she's averaging about 1/2 attendance. Please, please understand the success rate of art students before you commit. Edit: spelling."
newhampshire,2vnxcq,Trancefuzion,3,Thu Feb 12 20:43:01 2015 UTC,"And working 9-5 in an office job filling out spreadsheets isn't a sham?   Please, what would you rather someone do? I bet you like music, maybe even video games. You may possibly have kids and the latest animated disney movie may be the only thing that gets them to shut up and give you peace and quiet for an hour an a half that day. The cool graphic tees you buy, your beautiful sleek shiny new sports car? All of this is because an artist designed it. Why must people hate on what someone wants to do with their own life? All college is a sham these days anyway. I have friends with chemical engineering degrees and other smart stuff who are working as fucking telemarketers and other boring 9-5 office jobs because they cannot find any other work. I'm going to get a degree in something I enjoy if thats the case. Still shows I'm more capable at doing something than a high school diploma alone.  But for your sake, are you really going to be that asshole parent who when your kid says they want to be an astronaut or rock star or actor and say ""Pfft, good luck kid, you'll never get there, the success rate is so low.""? No. You wont. Because anything is attainable with hard work, and you're going to want your child to have that work ethic to be able to attain their wildest dreams. So why do you have to go discouraging some random person?  Not sure who your instructor friend is, but I don't know what you're talking about. Most teachers I've encountered seem to love this place and the students. It's almost impossible not too with a whole student body with only 500 kids. It sounds like she is one of the instructors who doesn't care to be honest."
newhampshire,2vnxcq,Trancefuzion,3,Thu Feb 12 22:00:16 2015 UTC,"Teaching and art go hand in hand in some cases. But you are completely right. That was my exact other option. The complete opposite of NHIA, a state school at home, less money, huge student body, with a decent photo/art Ed program. I quite possibly may have branched off into something more productive I suppose if I had attended that school and I won't lie that I'm frustrated over my decision because I know things now that I didn't know four years ago. But I do love it here. CAnd that's the other issue. I'm not sure I would take it back because of the things I've learned and the passion for art/photography instilled in me. The friends I've made in this tight knit community. There are kids here who are marketing their art and already doing really well. They work hard. I, personally may have fared better off somewhere else because my ""vision"" I guess you could say, isn't as marketable. It really is what you make it if you're willing to work for it, as with anything. And it really just irks me when people dismiss art. Design is everywhere, you don't get things you like without art. So I apologize for some harsh words, but to eachs own.  I'll leave off with this great Kevin Smith quote because it sums up everything I failed to say.    Remember: It costs nothing to encourage an artist, and the potential benefits are staggering. A pat on the back to an artist now could one day result in your favorite film, or the cartoon you love to get stoned watching, or the song that saves your life. Discourage an artist, you get absolutely nothing in return, ever."

She loved the illustration classes and most of the professors, but the Art Ed department she found absolutely terrible.  Also, it's in a REALLY sketchy part of the city.  She has a number of rather scary stories about being followed, harassed, and generally creeped on.  She could hear fighting outside her dorm window regularly."

I mean, yes, it's Manchester not Detroit, but you should be aware that you need to keep your head up if you plan on coming and going to classes late night. My mom graduated from NHIA and she loved it there, but you can't ignore the neighborhood. It sucks."

A lot of people will have those dates off and hotel rates will reflect that. Locally run motels will most likely be a bit cheaper than the chain hotels, in my experience. Just look for places that don't have a lot of amenities and book ahead.   I've had good luck with the Yankee Clipper Inn. Nothing special, but they have clean rooms, a small indoor pool, and give you a discount for breakfast at the small diner next door. Avoid Junge's like the plague. It looks like they haven't renovated their rooms since the 70s."

It's just really unfortunate that over the past few years keene has witnessed events caused by students that I unfortunately have to call my peers, that have negatively affected the way keene locals and just general people see the school. It bothers me that the average student you would see around campus is someone that would value glorifying destruction and unnecessary violence over getting the most out of their education they are so lucky to have access to. It pains me to say it but at this point I'd be embarrassed to say I was a keene alumni, that I graduated along side some of these people.

These are, on occasion, pre-bought by corps for a whole season for all shows and may simply have not had a taker for that night. Some of them were likely in the club lounge near Section 101 (those seats allow you access there).   For whatever reason, the Monarchs like to hold back those club seats from general purchasers until about 10-14 days prior to the game. It's been like that for ages but beyond possibly giving club seat holders the right to purchase additionals, I don't know why."

newhampshire,2vhgb0,whywhyzee,8,Wed Feb 11 01:19:31 2015 UTC,"That's very high, it would seem.  A few questions that might help estimate roughly what your costs should be:  How many sqft is the house? How old is it? What style is it? 2x6 walls or 2x4 walls? Does it get a lot, a little, or hardly any sun during the day? What kind of condition are the windows in? Do you know how thick the insulation is in the attic space? What kind of siding?  As cold as it's been, $500 is certainly possible but with the heat that low all week I'd expect worst case scenario on the structure.  In any case, my advice would be to find a nice refurbished name brand woodstove and have that sucker installed over the summer. Wood heat, even if you buy the wood, is no less than a 50% savings over the cost of LP or Oil..... and it works in a power outage for heat, light, and cooking."
newhampshire,2vhgb0,DieCommieScum,1 point,Wed Feb 11 02:40:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response.  The home is ~1000 sqft with a large exposed concrete wall from the basement.  I assume this is my major problem since it is insulated.  My guess is that the home was originally 3 seasons and the previous owners upgraded to 4 season without thinking about the cost of heating.  To answer your questions, 2x4 construction, hardly any direct sun, all the windows are new and well sealed, there is no attic space (cathedral ceiling), and there is vinyl siding.  The bill isn't too much of a hardship, I just really wanted to make sure that it seemed reasonable and that I didn't have a MASSIVE leak or something like that."
newhampshire,2vhgb0,DieCommieScum,3,Thu Feb 12 01:51:51 2015 UTC,"I suppose the good news is that it's only 1000sqft. Your bill was very high per square foot, but based on your description of the rest of the house it seems to make sense. Winter shade is rough, and probably confirms it was a 3 season camp once.  Is the basement part of the area that is heated? Usually basements only need supplemental heat if they are finished because the walls that are underground should be ambient to the ground heat of about 55 degrees already. 2"" foam panels are pretty cheap at the Home Despot, that may help to cover that above ground wall with those if you're heating it. You could also install a cheapo pellet stove down there as a poor mans heated floors, that will slash your heat bill.... isn't as good as a wood stove but since its in the basement you don't want to run down to feed it constantly.  If you end up re-doing any external walls, be it drywall or paneling etc, rip out whatever shit insulation is behind them and replace with rockwool. Same with the ceiling, you may not have an attic but there is still insulation between the living space and the roof. Usually you don't have to wholesale replace this but add too it.   If you don't have ceiling fans in the cathedral, think about getting some, as running them in reverse in the winter is a good way to keep the heat from resting up there."
newhampshire,2vhgb0,DieCommieScum,1 point,Thu Feb 12 03:43:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks again for the advice.  The basement is part of the heated space and it is mostly unfinished.  I plan on insulating the basement ceiling this weekend and working on insulating the exposed outer wall ASAP.  Right now it is thermally connected to the living space so I figure that isn't helping at all.  Once I isolate the two, I'll start trying to shore-up the main floor."
newhampshire,2vhgb0,cujo,1 point,Thu Feb 12 13:17:10 2015 UTC,You probably don't want to insulate the basement ceiling unless you're using it as living space and just want to help even out distribution as you want the heat to radiate up into the living space.

Propane used to be much cheaper in NH back then. Now it's so expensive most people get pellet stoves.

newhampshire,2vbwkw,Falkenzz,1 point,Tue Feb 10 14:08:34 2015 UTC,"Hard rime:       Hard rime is a white ice that forms when the water droplets in fog freeze to the outer surfaces of objects. It is often seen on trees atop mountains and ridges in winter, when low-hanging clouds cause freezing fog. This fog freezes to the windward (wind-facing) side of tree branches, buildings, or any other solid objects, usually with high wind velocities and air temperatures between −2 and −8 °C (28.4 and 17.6 °F).  Hard rime formations are difficult to shake off; they have a comb-like appearance, unlike soft rime, which looks feathery or spiky, or clear ice, which looks homogeneous and transparent.  Scientists at meteorologically extreme places such as Mount Washington in New Hampshire often have to break huge chunks of hard rime off weather equipment, in order to keep anemometers and other measuring instruments operating.  Rime ice can accumulate on the leading edges and control surfaces of aircraft operating in certain meteorological conditions.  Meteorologists distinguish between three basic types of ice forming on vertical and horizontal surfaces by deposition of supercooled water droplets. Of course there are also intermediate formations.   Soft rime is less dense than hard rime and is milky and crystalline, like sugar. Soft rime appears similar to hoar frost. Hard rime is somewhat less milky, especially if it is not heavy. Clear ice is transparent and homogeneous and resembles ice-cube ice in appearance. Its amorphous, dense structure helps it cling tenaciously to any surface on which it forms.   Both rime types are less dense than clear ice and cling less tenaciously, therefore damage due to rime is generally minor compared to clear ice. Glaze ice is similar in appearance to clear ice but it is the result of a completely different process, occurring during freezing rain or drizzle.  These three types occur also when ice forms on the surface of an aircraft when it flies through a cloud made of supercooled water liquid droplets. Rime ice is the least dense, milky ice is intermediate and clear ice is the most dense. Dense ice can spoil lift and may have a catastrophic effect on an airborne aircraft.

Would love to discover some peaceful places for hikes, snowshoeing, disc golf in the summer, bikram yoga, csa's, gardening, mom's groups for my better half, knitting groups for her, photography for me.....  The list can go on and on.  It feels good in my core to be here."
newhampshire,2v71fl,Ogre213,9,Sun Feb 8 15:47:32 2015 UTC,"Don't have kids myself, but friends that do really like the Dover Children's Museum. For hiking/Snowshoeing, Portsmouth has the wildlife refuge on Pease, the Urban Forestry Center off Rt1, the Seacoast Science Center, just up the road in Rochester there's Isinglass Trails in Gonic (on Waste Management's land, believe it or not) and Blue Job Mountain.  There's also a little trail tucked in across the road from the Rochester airport-goes through an old quarry. The Farmer's Market at Wentworth Greenhouses in Rollinsford has a bunch of CSAs that show up.  If you're looking for local farms too, Tendercrop Farms has their store on Dover Point-great local produce and meat. For Bikram, I've heard really good things about Green Lotus in downtown Dover.  There's also a specialty yarn shop there called Spinning Yarns that probably has/knows of groups. For photography, you can't throw a rock around here without hitting something worth shooting and probably catching three more on the ricochets. Lots around here to do.  You're going to love it!"

Loon, Bretton Woods, and Cannon are all world class.  Like good dining?  Concord has a few gems, and Portsmouth has some awesome restaurants.  Hiking your thing?  Pick a mountain, there are a million of 'em.  Snowmobile?  Hit up the maintained and well marked system of state trails that go all the way to the Canadian border.  You can pretty much get to any destination on a snowmobile that you can reach in a car.  Ice fishing?  Check out the lakes region.  Arcades?  One of the biggest at Fun Spot in Laconia.  Ice Hockey?  Adult leagues abound, try the Tri-City arena in Hooksett, or check out stick-puck sessions in just about any town with an arena.

Other users said it right when they said ""you do the same things here you would do in the other 49 states"" There is nothing particularly boring about New Hampshire. It's just February! Also, being single doesn't make your case any stronger that there isn't anything to do. In fact, there are actually more things to do while single because you can actually do anything you want! (Weather depending)  Idk, posts like this fucking piss me off because I'm sitting on my couch with a broken collarbone thinking of dozens of things I could be doing right now, inside and outside.   Please be thankful for what you have instead of complaining about being bored in one of the most interesting states in the country.   Maybe get a part time job? I know a company that's looking for shovelers and they pay $15 an hour, out of Londonderry.   I'm in so much pain right now that I would pay to shovel. I'm still thankful though! I've had all week off and I've read so many good books and I've gotten really close to family and friends because I've needed to shelve my pride and ask for help.   If you're bored, open your eyes."

The only activity I've taken part of outside of the regular self improvement one does at home has been a sports beer league, which was entertaining to some degree.    Outside of that, I'm having some difficulty figuring out fun shit to do that isn't going out to the bar and drinking.  I already have a good, physical job, and I don't have much interest in shoveling for fun.  Again, the reason I brought up being single is because I found it much easier to 'do things' as a couple, and I was actually making this post so I could get some feedback/advice.  Taking classes on cooking is easier than just randomly dropping into some class by yourself.  Sitting at Barnes and Nobles for a while is even pretty entertaining at that level.  I'm sorry about your collarbone, though."

People don't realize it, but there's a whole different culture of being at a ski resort. I've worked at one for a while now and it actually amazes me. The whole concept of skiing amazes me. I went to the mountain during that blizzard. I stood on the peak of the mtn getting blown by 60 mph wind gusts and thought about what it would take to get to the same spot hundreds of years ago. We have the ability to ascend a mountain in minutes and ride down. Without modern tech, that would take hours and hours to do once. The sights you see skiing/riding are incredible, sights you would never see anywhere else. The other day I was watching you powder getting blown by the wind. It looked like a river of snow was running uphill on this trail. There was so much of it and it was so constant that it genuinely looked like it was flowing. It was so beautiful and unique. Nobody has exactly the same experience, and the journey of self-discovery as a skiier/rider makes it even better. You'll start off shitty, but eventually you'll be dropping off cliffs and shit before you know it.

newhampshire,2v4htu,skankersores,3,Sun Feb 8 01:56:40 2015 UTC,"Finding friends as you get older is harder in general. That's why it's important to actively seek it for yourself. So it sounds like you're not from new England. Here's a couple of ways to get in good with northern new englanders.    Be nice. Don't tell them their state sucks. They like their state (except when they want to complain about it themselves, but if you're from away, you don't have that right.)  Be useful. Offer to help your neighbor shovel. See a big pile of wood next door, offer to help them stack. Be of use.  Pretend you're interested in meeting them where they're at. Instead of wondering why they're not meeting you where you're at.    Here's some suggestions to help you think of alternative ways to meet people (unlike your the current company you keep) other than at a bar. Take a class at an art studio. Join some professional organizations. Start going to some nh humanities council events. They're free and interesting. See what you're local independent bookstore has for upcoming events. Volunteer to be an usher at your local theatre-like the palace theatre in Manchester, cap in concord or music hall in Portsmouth. Join a running group. If you're on the seacoast there's an activist group trying to get a trail put in up the coastline. Join that. Go to a poetry slam. Catch a concert at the stone church in Newmarket or tupelo music hall in Londonderry. Go to a couple if your city council meetings and shake some hands-that's a place where they live to meet new people.   Remember, if you want to meet interesting people, you should try to be interesting yourself. And yes it's work.. It's hard. But if you want it for yourself, it's worth it."

newhampshire,2v4htu,heroinking,6,Sun Feb 8 02:38:19 2015 UTC,"“Only those who want everything done for them are bored.” –Billy Graham   “I’m bored!” is the plaintive cry uttered by many a child idling away their summer vacation or fall break. They expect their parents to come up with an activity to cure this boredom (if your mom was like mine, she would always make a wry suggestion like, “How about cleaning up your room?”).  Unfortunately, many men never outgrow this need to be entertained by others and don’t develop into manly self-starters. This is the man who puts his head down on the dinner table as people talk after eating (I’ve seen it), the college student who grouses his way through a class outing to the local museum, and the houseguest who comes to visit your fair city and has no idea what he’d like to do during his stay; he leaves all the planning to you.  The reason that children are perennially bored is not that there aren’t entertainment options available—they’re often surrounded by toys and games—but that they have such short attention spans. They play with one thing for a little bit and then another, and then don’t know what else to do. The educated man is able to lose himself in a task, a hobby, a conversation, or a book because he has developed his powers of focus and concentration.  “When people are bored, it is primarily with themselves.” –Eric Hoffer   Of course these days, with an iPhone always at hand, amusing yourself isn’t very difficult. Anyone can surf or text the boredom away. The real test for the modern educated man is the ability to entertain himself when technology isn’t available or is not socially acceptable to whip out. Can you entertain yourself at a boring meeting, while camping, while conversing at a dinner party? The educated man can, and he does it, ironically enough, by retaining an important ability of his childhood—curiosity. The educated man is insatiably curious about the world around him and other people. In any situation, he sees something to learn, study, and observe. If he’s stuck somewhere with neither phone nor company,  he uses the time to untangle a philosophical problem he’s been wrestling with; the mind of the educated man is a repository of ideas that he can pull out and examine to pass the time in any situation.  http://www.artofmanliness.com/2011/10/30/the-3-characteristics-of-an-educated-man/"

If you're dissatisfied with the activities of the people you know, then maybe you need to get to know different people. Someone isn't going to knock on your door and get you into a hobby, having a hobby is how you meet like-minded people. There's clubs and meetups for just about everything. But, you probably should take that out of the equation and learn to entertain yourself.  As long as there is something you don't know, or a skill you haven't mastered, there is never ""nothing to do"".

As a woman new to the area a year ago, I chose being active as my way to meet people. You have to be careful not shit where you eat but I joined a social running club that meets Thursday night's at various bars and I joined a trivia meet up and just went every week until I got to know a smaller circle of usual suspects.   Through the meet up people, I learned rock climbing and hiking. Picked up skiing just by myself for now...   So I would focus more on addingnew  social groups to your routine and see if something comes along, rather than specifically look to meet singles.   Edit: I see you go to Murphy's?

newhampshire,2uy4kb,darthjoe229,6,Fri Feb 6 05:53:38 2015 UTC,"So, the current Stored Communications Act was written in a day and age where email sat on a server until you downloaded it. After that, it was deleted off the server. As such, it presumes that any email sitting for a long time on a third party server has been basically abandoned, and allows the government to get emails of more than 180 days' age from the server without a warrant. Less than 180 days, and you need a warrant.  Nowadays, most email services work by storing your email on the server forever. Because of how the SCA is written, all of that is available to be subpoenaed without the need for a warrant after it's been there for six months. This law requires the government to get a warrant for stored communications regardless of age. It also imposes a requirement on law enforcement to notify the owner of an email account that gets searched pursuant to a warrant within 10 days of the search."

You'd only understand it that way if you really, really wanted to.  I don't carry exact change and I don't like buying books of checks - I'd rather use the same debit/credit card that I can use for nearly every other transaction in this world. This isn't some complex bureaucratic function that would be added, this is something any idiot with an iPhone and a $10 attachment can currently do.  Regardless, ensuring that the cards are valid and preventing fraud isn't the responsibility of the merchant, those tasks are performed by the payment processor. Just like when you go to the supermarket, the card is declined or accepted at the point of purchase, any fraud is taken care of by the issuing bank or the payments processor."

newhampshire,2urasi,TehSeraphim,6,Fri Feb 6 14:13:37 2015 UTC,"Silly as hell. First, this requires the state to take on silly levels of risk with those fees, due to the huge fluctuations in bitcoin markets and low liquidity/long transaction clear times. Second, it brings no benefit whatsoever to anyone, as the fees and such will still be priced in USD, not BTC. Also, the argument that the state wouldn't have to pay for processing fees is only true until they run out of coins to mine; after that fees will skyrocket. Even now, coin rewards form a miner subsidy that's hugely costly, in real terms, but one that's paid by bagholders buying into this silly experiment.   Then there's issues with storage, security, slow transaction speed, etc. that make the entire blockchain tech useless for actual institutions. The article suggests that the state could be insulated from price risk, but then they're using something like Bitpay, where they're not actually accepting bitcoins, they're accepting dollars and Bitpay is doing some mumbo-jumbo and telling clients they're really using BTC.  Yet another in a long line of dumb proposals put forth by NH's amateur legislators."
newhampshire,2urasi,gizram84,2,Thu Feb 5 18:28:52 2015 UTC,"They probably aren't taking btc directly. I would assume they use like what Newegg uses, which is a third party system. You make a btc payment and its transferred to usd immediately and deposited into state coffers.   Companies like newegg use this because it gives them appeal to people who support btc, while really doing nothing for their currency."
newhampshire,2urasi,ANewMachine615,7,Wed Feb 4 16:59:47 2015 UTC,"while really doing nothing for their currency.   It's doing a lot for the currency.  Being able to spend bitcoin directly at retailers is quite possible the best thing they can be doing.  The only barrier that stands in bitcoin's way is mainstream acceptance.  The more companies that accept bitcoin, the better for bitcoin users.  I could care less whether NewEgg converts some or all of the bitcoin they receive to USD.  It's irrelevant to me.  I am just happy I can spend my bitcoin in more places."
newhampshire,2urasi,g3wd,-3,Wed Feb 4 18:01:45 2015 UTC,"Except Newegg never receives any bitcoin. When you use Bitpay, you are transferring your BTC to Bitpay, who then pays dollars on your behalf.

I explained why that's irrelevant, and how it's still helping the bitcoin economy significantly.  Also, just because a company uses BitPay, doesn't mean they aren't holding bitcoin.  BitPay offers the ability to convert any amount of sales to USD.  From 0% to 100%.  You're assuming that NewEgg is converting 100% of their sales to USD.  That's nothing but a guess.  All you know is that NewEgg is the customer of a bitcoin payment processor.  You have no idea what agreement those two companies have with each other.  A BitPay emplyee has stated that around 50% of their customers accept some percentage in bitcoin.  NewEgg might be one of them."
newhampshire,2urasi,gizram84,0,Wed Feb 4 18:57:11 2015 UTC,"It is relevant because the law in question requires the state to accept bitcoin as payment. I'm not sure that accepting USD from Bitpay on behalf of the taxpayer counts as ""accepting bitcoin,"" which has a lot to do with the terrible drafting of this law. You can tell nobody expected this to clear committe just because it doesn't define anything, like ""bitcoin"" or ""third party payment processor."" A definitions section is like the first edit you make to any serious legislation. This ""bill"" is more of a one-paragraph ""wouldn't it be nice"" resolution than anything."

newhampshire,2ulh43,JudgeWhoAllowsStuff,3,Tue Feb 3 07:15:24 2015 UTC,"Gun permits typically go to the person, and allow them to do the permitted activity on an ongoing basis (like a pistol/revolver permit in NH).    A tax stamp must be gotten for each item, in this case including for each projectile.  That's $200 and an extensive (read: weeks long) background investigation by the BATFE.    Misleading.  Far from an open market.  The fact that you can spin something as being an open market when it is literally illegal to manufacture transferrable machine guns (for the past 28 years) just shows how misleading you are being.    Then there's the fact that you mistakenly claimed that rocket launchers are not DDs.    Do you think elephant ivory is an ""open market"" in the US, even though only grandfathered, certified ivory is exempted from the ban on ivory sales?"

newhampshire,2ulh43,skankersores,-6,Tue Feb 3 16:14:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure a ban is appropriate.  How about a publicized report analyzing the value the weapons would provide to the intended recipient, and perhaps a public vote on accepting them?

The people talking about supremacy think this is an attempt at nullification, which it clearly is not (not that the headline does the bill any favors). However, I think it's bad policy to blanketly bar state enforcement of any federal rule that might touch on firearms. For one thing, that's an incredibly broad prohibition. For another, such enforcement is limited to civil issues, discretionary, and can always be carried out by federal regulators as well, so it may be ineffective in the end. For a third, the penalty is absurdly harsh -- cutting off all funds to the entire town if they do anything to enforce federal rules.  So... yeah. Bad facial policy, possibly futile, and hugely over-corrective penalties."

It's more political grandstanding, not a discussion on the lawful use of guns or working towards removing current federal limitations/laws.   I understand that some people on the left are using salami tactics to limit rights to guns, but this (in my opinion) is a callous way to counter it. As it is written now, I am not happy with it or the message that it stands for, which sounds to me like a ""Fuck you, Washington.""  What America needs is a real discussion about guns. Each side has these fanatics entrenched on their own side and they are blinded by their echo-chamber. Look at my first comment stating that I don't support this bill and how it was flat-out down voted away. Civil discourse usually flies out the when discussing guns. Until we get to a point that we can actually engage in a discussion with members from each camp nothing will change.  E: Forgot a ""with""."

You gave no reasoning for that first statement which is something to be down voted and not as much a echo-chamber knee jerk response. Also so what if its a ""fuck you"" to Washington its protecting our rights from being taken away by a federal power without the states consent.You can't have expect to have discussion with those to wish to take our rights away as it is an issue that can have no compromises. Its silly to say its an argument since its from the original bill of rights which basically states ""don't fuck with these original rights""."
newhampshire,2ujp60,JudgeWhoAllowsStuff,7,Tue Feb 3 12:43:13 2015 UTC,"My first comment was at -7 when I replied to you, while a comment saying ""Excellent."" was at +4. The federal government doesn't take rights away without states consent. Representatives from each state write laws that they see fit based on what their constituents have voiced. The states' representatives vote on these bills. It's part of how our government works. If you dislike any legislation, take it up with your representative. Compromising is how you get things done in government. Bills that don't compromise generally fail. Otherwise you get the gridlock that we've been seeing the past few years in the federal government and a ""do-nothing Congress."" The Bill of Rights is open to interpretation. There are things that the founding fathers could never have dreamed of in our modern society and it is up to the courts to sort things out. Whether the people agree with the interpretation or not is another matter.   Now, I believe fully in the right to bare arms. You know this and I know this. I'm simply saying that everyone is too gung-ho about saying ""I'm right."" to even hear what the other side has to say. This applies especially to the anti-gun people, but it also applies to pro-gunners as well. I believe that there can be compromises, but I don't believe it should only be the pro-gun side doing the compromising.  In my opinion, most of those who are against guns are that way because of a lack of understanding of the purpose and uses that citizens have for guns. The problem is that instead of trying to teach those people about guns we have this us-vs-them mentality and we fail to properly meet with and educate those who would try to pass laws to limit what we can or cannot own or do with guns.  E: Grammar."

As much as I wish this was true I have seen to many times the futile attempts of such education. I do agree education will help but to the individuals who commit to limit are rights no education seems to sway their views. Education is key, I absolutely agree but at the same time and education is useless when other refuse to learn. And we should not have compromise on any civil right and not a single time has there been compromise when civil rights were demanded and only then were they were guaranteed (see civil rights movement) when no one let up."

Going along with your comparison of the civil right movement I'll put it this way: teach those that will listen about guns, if you make enough of them understand that it isn't the end of the world and ostracize those that don't listen. It'll get better. Guns aren't going away.   In the meantime education is the key and we need to be the ones out there spreading the information. However, this can't be done if we don't get together and try. You say that you've seen it fail, but because something fails once doesn't mean that it will always fail. If we truly want to advocate for guns we need to learn to listen and discuss. Be the change you want to see in the work, so to speak.  Now, compromises have already been made. Look at the NFA. I would say that that was a reasonable compromise. I'm not saying that we need to compromise further, but I am saying that we must understand that we can compromise. Being rigid makes the other side do the same. We need to be open-minded, yet clear with what we want and what we will not accept.

It should be easy for people to get and should be as cheap as possible. I also support basic firearms safety in schools just like sex ed. I see no reason you can't have a week in your Health class in middle school where the local PD comes in and explains how things work, basic safety rules, and simple familiarization.  The reasons that I object to it are 1) It shouldn't have to be legislated, the fewer laws the better and 2) Maybe it starts as a 1 hour course, then it's easy for them to make it a 5 hour course later, next time the law is examined it'll be a 2-day course. I think that the easiest line in the sand on that is no course rather that mandating one and hoping it doesn't become a de facto block to firearm ownership.  Plenty of tools should be used responsibly and have little training. For instance, should I have to take a course in order to buy a chainsaw? I know it's a bit of an absurd example but it does highlight what I mean: it's a dangerous tool that can easily be used to kill multiple people but it's up to the owner to make decide whether or not they need training."

New Hampshire will likely see increased drug crime, violent crime, and increased racism as ""model minorities"" become less a slice of the population in the state. This will become an extreme problem for suburb-dwellers if the trend towards affluence moving back towards major metropolitan centers continues, so that places where one could leave the door unlocked for generations will become home to more theft and petty vandalism, property values will lower, and the move away from a safe, affluent semi-rural New Hampshire will continue apace.   I sincerely hope that all these fears are overblown, and that New Hampshire will find a way to continue as a safe, relatively affluent, quiet place to live. I think people overstate the need for every corner of the world to be a bustling metropolis, bursting with commerce and jobs, there is something to be said for having that place to ""get away from it all"", and definitely a population who wants to live in a place that is always away from it all.  New Hampshire might do better to continue with its roots as an exclusive vacation destination for the wealthy and upper-middle-class, with a bit of diversification towards high-value manufacturing and information technologies, or it might be able to do something completely out of the blue to continue to inspire moderate growth, but I fear that will be swept aside as people and politicians call for high growth and increasing urbanization."

You'll probably come across that way. We're pretty live and let live here.   Alright, I'll definitely keep that in mind. As for ""live and let live"" I'm pretty intrigued by this. What exactly do you mean? Does that apply to politics, or how one lives there life in general? Like what interests you have, or what music you like?   The further from Massachusetts the better.  I guess I'd say so in general. More people are moving up from Massachusetts than are being born here and they can be pretty liberal (the massholes, not the babies).

Plus they do a lot of weird public statements, like harass police.  That said, many locals have a libertarian bent, even if they identify as democrat or republican. This doesn't make the place seem like a lawless utopia; moreso it makes it feel fairly moderate and independent. It's a pretty moderate place, though.

I will say that it seems like people pay attention to the state government moreso than they did back home.  I lived for years in Dover and Rochester. Rochester is basically a demilitarized zone. I loved living in Dover. I really miss the seacoast area, as rural areas are literally minutes from large, nice towns like Portsmouth, which is one of the loveliest places one can spend his time if he enjoys eating (which I do).  Right now I live in Nashua, which is merely a convenience because I work in MA.  Nashua is fine, but I wouldn't want to live here long term. It's pretty busy with all the retail operations, and it isn't very pretty (except for the view from the highway, going north on route 3 between exits 2 and 4).  There are, however, some very nice towns around us and Nashua is a good starting point for exploring the region.  If I were you, I would try visiting NH for a bit and checking out as much as you can. I have to say that, while NH has its problems, it's a lovely state and it has really grown on me. Check out Manchester, Portsmouth, The Lake, and all those little towns in between.

The reality is that most Libertarian and FSP people are super nice and intelligent...and love to talk about their beliefs.  Of all of the political groups they are the ones who seem to be able to handle and interact with other viewpoints far better than your garden variety Republican or Democrat.   Case in point, I have worked lighting and sound for campaign events at a frequent S. NH campaign stop and have worked with everyone from Hillary to Ron Paul folks.  Hands down the nicest, most chill staffers I worked with were the Ron Paul people.   (Incidentally....Hillary's people were the WORST.  Absolute assholes who stiffed me on my stipend.)  I've found Libertarian rallies are also the most welcoming of new people because they're the closest to ""the people"".  Republican events aren't too bad, but there's definitely the ""rich guys in suits"" and ""everyone else"".    The FSP project has created zero state problems that I'm aware of.   I've spent about 8 years working in an industry where state governments are our clients 90% of the time and the State of NH is the best run of all neighboring states.  Maine is broke, so is VT, and MA is just a disaster....easily the least functional of all.  Definitely come up here, as it sounds like this is the place for you.

Most of the northern pass complaining is being done by north country political types who have very little to gripe about and feel like this is their Waterloo.  Some of the ""it will fry people"" stuff is laughable because HVDC does NOT produce the kind of RF harmonics that normal AC does....its direct current.  The only difficulty it will cause of any substance is that apparently operators of HF HAM radio (which supplements emergency) have issues with powerlines across the state in getting signals from the North Country down to Concord....and even they said its not a problem that isn't fixable, just a potential issue.  As far as keystone....its all money.  Warren Buffet is behind most of the opposition because he owns many of the major railroads that move oil out of Canada right now.  By any metric pipelines are safer than rail and have excellent environmental records....just look at the Trans Alaskan pipeline....and much of that one is above ground!

newhampshire,2ucno7,ANewMachine615,2,Tue Feb 3 18:20:53 2015 UTC,The part authorizing the indefinite detention of any person for any reason deemed related to terrorism or national security without a trial or representation.
newhampshire,2ucno7,g3wd,-1,Tue Feb 3 18:46:24 2015 UTC,"Several things wrong with this.   The NDAA did not change existing law at all, except to place the detention program under Congressional oversight and implied potential Congressional censure. The NDAA just codified a power that the administration (both Bush and Obama) had claimed arose from the 2001 AUMF, and had exercised liberally since that time. It included sufficient exceptions and exemptions for American citizens, nationals, residents, and those captured within the territorial US as to say that it changed nothing. There was a debate pre-NDAA as to whether the AUMF's implied detention power could be exercised against American citizens, and that debate was not resolved or assisted on either side by the NDAA. All the NDAA does is take the known portions of the claimed AUMF power and make them explicit. By doing so, it implies that the detention power could be revoked without necessarily revoking the rest of the AUMF, which technically does add a smidgen of (likely illusory) oversight and control of the administration's use of deention. The NDAA does not bar the detained person from a review of their detention (not trial, but better than nothing) nor from obtaining counsel. See, e.g., Boumediene v. Bush."
newhampshire,2ucno7,ANewMachine615,1 point,Wed Feb 4 16:46:37 2015 UTC,"First off, yes, no one suggest that this stuff wasn't happening before NDAA 2012.  HOWEVER, it was, as you say, made explicit and became a public issue with that bill.  Many, many people vocally protested it including members of Congress because it is absolutely illegal in every sense.  However, despite this, most members of Congress said ""Screw it, we're voting for it anyway"" and Ayotte was one of them.  As such, I want her out of office.  Your second point is almost laughable...""Well, it doesn't say they can't have a ""review""...""  Really?  It doesn't require a trial...which is the LAW under the Constitution.

newhampshire,2ucno7,ANewMachine615,1 point,Wed Feb 4 18:26:23 2015 UTC,"Oh, c'mon, bud.....""due process of law"" is pretty clearly NOT ""some officer at the CIA decided to detain a dude indefinitely.""   Also, the due process clause is in addition to the requirement that a Grand Jury indictment is REQUIRED for any detention or prosecution in major offenses...and terrorism or national security issues are DEFINITELY in that category and what the NDAA is talking about.  The only exception is members of the armed forces during a time of War...which is clearly defined as only being when Congressionally declared, not when the President decides to and Congress goes ""meh"".      Stop pretending the Law doesn't say what it clearly says."

It might be review of the detention by an Article III judge by way of a habeas corpus petition. Which is precisely what cases like Boumediene established that Gitmo detainees have access to.   Also, the due process clause is in addition to the requirement that a Grand Jury indictment is REQUIRED for any detention or prosecution in major offenses   The due process clause is part of the Fifth Amendment, not the Seventh (where the grand jury indictment comes from). Also, conviction and detention are two different things.   Stop pretending the Law doesn't say what it clearly says.   Please show me where detention, with habeas corpus review, is specifically barred by the Constitution. Again, I think that given the nature of the detention and the reasons for detention, due process should include a full trial, with a jury, etc. SCOTUS disagrees, and feels that habeas review is sufficient. But where you and I differ is that I am capable of describing the law as it is actually practiced, and you are only capable of describing The Law as you believe it to be."

I'm pretty sure by plain meaning ""being held at Gitmo on charges of terrorism"" is far beyond being simple ""held to answer"".  Its illegal....wildly illegal.

This is particularly true of catalytic converters, one of the biggest gripes older car owners have with NH inspection requirements. CCs include precious metals often mined with poor practice methods in other countries. Then these metals must be processed, formed, molded whatever, which uses tons of additional energy. Then shipped, then sold and installed. Furthermore, CCs actually hurt the fuel efficiency of a vehicle because it interrupts the flow from air intake-->engine-->exhaust.  Now I am not saying CCs are bad; I find them incredibly necessary to help curb the environmental impact from our cars and trucks. But 95.1% efficiency passes and 94.9% doesn't is bullshit until something better arises to help filter exhaust. Currently, there is no incentive for car companies or states to change this system--it makes people a LOT of money.   And I am not ignorant of the argument ""well, where would the efficiency line be then?"" Well, I am sure a lot of people a lot smarter than me could calculate real cost and come up with a better number than 95%. Surely some of that 95% is better suited to use up instead of end up at a scrap yard."

Texas is basically a joke of an inspection. It's $15, and all they do is check your directional lights, headlights, brake lights, and if your brakes seem to function.

newhampshire,2u43o8,wtfdizzy,2,Thu Jan 29 21:33:57 2015 UTC,"I would argue that safety inspections should be every year considering our weather and driving conditions. Emissions inspections should be less often and the ""no check engine light"" policy should be abolished completely.   My biggest frustration with inspection standards/requirements in New Hampshire is how it essentially pressures people into buying/leasing new cars and, more importantly, getting rid of perfectly functioning vehicles that have a check engine light on. I had a 90s Nissan Pickup that was a bit trashy, but it ran great and everything safety related was always kept up. The problem was sensors and catalytic converters. CCs, in particular, are incredibly expensive and the check engine light went on as soon as CCs fall below 95% efficiency or if the sensor is broken. I am all for emissions restrictions and environmental concerns, but isn't the resource cost of buying a new catalytic converter/new vehicle OR getting rid of perfectly functioning vehicles worse than a few percentage points of efficiency? The truck was only worth, according to KBB, like $2200 at the time, but a new Cali catalytic converter and installation was like $600 bucks and I had to replace two $80 sensors to KNOW it was the CC. If I wanted a CC from the dealer that would last more than a few years, it would've been like $1300.   I ended up selling the truck for like $900 to some guy who ships these cars to states that don't care about emissions as much. The less efficient emissions still exist somewhere and I still was screwed. I think the ""no check engine light"" policy included in NH inspection standards, especially in regards to emissions, is a silver plate to the auto sales/service industry in the state and poor for New Hampshire residents."
newhampshire,2u43o8,beaherobeaman,3,Thu Jan 29 21:53:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100% on the Check Engine Light policy.  I had a Volvo that kept tripping the CEL at random intervals and I could never get the light shut off long enough to pass inspection.    I took it to a couple of different mechanics before I found someone who could find the actual problem - which turned out to be a kinked air hose that would cause the car to run lean just long enough to trip the CEL - and all told it cost me hundreds of dollars to get this fixed.  From this I learned 2 things: OBDII is a crapshoot - the CEL code might be useful or completely worthless, and the actual problem with the car might have exactly zero bearing on safety or emissions.  I had another car fail because the backup lights didn't work - which to me is a pretty silly reason to fail a car - and it turned out the reverse light wiring had conveniently 'uncoupled' at some point.  I fixed it myself in about 30 seconds but that would've been an easy money-maker for the garage."

newhampshire,2u4qss,Jbarry465,3,Thu Jan 29 22:31:31 2015 UTC,"The physical card isn't much, really. I actually buy mine online so I can print out multiple copies - keep one at home for back-up, one in the glove box of my truck, and one (folded up in a double baggie) in my tackle bag. That way when I inevitably soak/lose one (I'm mostly a surf fisherman), I have another.  I believe the ME & MA reciprocity thing refers to the saltwater license - because NH only has a few miles of coastline, we cut a deal with the border states. It's nice if I'm going down to Plum Island or up to Ogunquit.  For friends and family, the one-day or five-day tags are pretty cheap. NH Fish & Game raise their entire budget from license sales - I don't believe they get anything from the state budget, and they do an amazing job. I'm willing to shell out a bit to support them."

newhampshire,2u4qss,enigbane,2,Fri Jan 30 00:04:50 2015 UTC,1) You can buy a license at lots of different stores and sports shops (i.e. fish & tackle shops and gun shops).  Sports Authority is where I get mine.  The ones you get at these places are waxed so they won't get ruined when they get wet.    2) You need a NH or bordering state license to fish bodies of water that fall on or across borders.    3) No
newhampshire,2u4qss,Rowls,1 point,Fri Jan 30 16:39:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about the first two, but as for the third: no. Anyone fishing needs their own NH fishing license"

newhampshire,2u35b2,sirsteezy,6,Fri Jan 30 00:12:51 2015 UTC,Keep an eye on the weather via Higher summits and be very cautious with avalanches hiking anything alpine this weekend you will prob need both Snowshoes and Crampons. Expect brutally frigid cold at these elevations as well. Hiking the whites in the winter is a whole other ball game compare to summer. I would highly recommend staying lower in elevation. The Lonesome Lake hike is awesome and pretty low risk. If your looking to stay around Washington try the Tuckerman Ravine Trail to hermit Lake. Please be prepared and pick up your hike safe card
newhampshire,2u35b2,JudgeWhoAllowsStuff,2,Thu Jan 29 17:03:07 2015 UTC,Is the hike safe card new?  I'm wondering why it was never advertised to me when I drop $100+ on a hunting and fishing license every year.
newhampshire,2u35b2,itsMalarky,3,Thu Jan 29 18:00:26 2015 UTC,if you have a hunting or fishing license your all set. The benefits of the hike safe card are covered by both of those. And yes the hike safe card is new for 2015.

newhampshire,2u35b2,meltingparadiso,2,Thu Jan 29 15:59:26 2015 UTC,"Bump for Blue Job.  Really quick and a killer view.  Great to test the winter waters!  If that seems easy for you, I'd step up to Mt. Major."
newhampshire,2u35b2,MoBio,1 point,Thu Jan 29 20:12:07 2015 UTC,Mount Major is another excellent suggestion if you think Blue Job is too easy. Good jobby Darthjoe :]
newhampshire,2u35b2,JudgeWhoAllowsStuff,4,Fri Jan 30 01:24:53 2015 UTC,I usually don't do any summits in the winter so I usually do partial hikes to interesting places. Waterfalls are a good bet. My favorite is Champney Falls on the east side of the Kanc. The trail goes all the way up to Mt Chocorua but the Falls is a good stopping point. The ice is bright blue and there are usually some climbers scaling the frozen falls. Another rewarding one is going up to the Lonesome Lake Hut in Franconia. It's not much for the scenic vistas (save for the lake) but there's lots of variation along the trail and it looks very different from the popular summer hike.

newhampshire,2tri0e,beaherobeaman,7,Tue Jan 27 11:40:47 2015 UTC,Go to the store get some water and some non perishable food items. The hotel probably has a generator. Go ask the hotel front desk if they do. If they don't have a generator go buy a battery back up charger thing for your phone so you don't get bored.  I suggest that you don't drive because even the most experienced drivers can't drive safely in the amount of snow they are predicting.  if you snowed in for 2 days just chill inside. If your hotel has a pool and you did not bring a swim suit go buy one now also if it has a gym acquire gym clothes to keep you from being bored.  Also walk around the city (or at least around the hotel) experience your first snow.
newhampshire,2tri0e,TheLawIsi,7,Mon Jan 26 21:29:55 2015 UTC,"How do I drive in snow?   Easy: Slowly.  People make a huge deal out of driving in the snow, but it's really not that bad. Just don't drive over 20mph. If you're on a side street with nobody around, try taking a turn slightly too fast so you can know what it feels like when you start to slide. Don't panic, correct the slide, apply gas, you're good to go.  That said, don't fucking drive tomorrow. Even we aren't. And we're nuts enough to live here."

newhampshire,2tri0e,captain_falc25,5,Tue Jan 27 17:48:49 2015 UTC,"Welcome to New Hampshire!   I would guess your hotel will probably have generators and if you're in Manchester you'll probably get power back quicker than if you were already in the White Mountains and lost power. Make sure if you have any electronic devices you might need to charge them now just in case.  Check out the AAA Wesbite Article on driving in the snow and in the winter. I would recommend not trying to drive up to the White Mountains in the storm. The roads will definitely be bad. For storms like this its better to get some food and beverage together, gather some snow-day activities (books, movies, whatever) and hunker down for the worst part of the storm.   Sorry the weather timed up with your conference. It's crappy but it should make for an interesting experience at least"

Just don't drive in the snow. You've never done it, so you'll be really bad at it, and that's really your only source of danger here. I'd forget the mountains until Wednesday, and maybe later. Manchester hotels are likely to keep their power or get it back quickly if they do lose it. You'll be surrounded by utility workers very soon if it gets bad. Grab some food and drink, and maybe a book, and settle in."

newhampshire,2tok30,throwawayNewH,6,Mon Jan 26 15:36:09 2015 UTC,"The weird thing is that the colder it is the less likely the snow will take out power. Warmer weather means heavy/wet snow, which takes down tree limbs, and power lines. Temps are supposed to be low 20's, so hopefully that's cold enough that the snow will be on the lighter (weight) side... That doesn't mean we won't get tons of snow though, and travel will still be a pain.  Early season, and late season storms tend to be the worst damage wise, because they happen when temps are closer to 30's, and the snow is wetter/heavier. This is also where ice storms are more likely. Heavy snow tends to pack down, and its a pain to shovel. Lighter snow will accumulate more, but its much easier to move around."
newhampshire,2tok30,thesandwitch,3,Mon Jan 26 14:54:59 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you that we will have fluffier snow, unfortunately we'll also have high winds.  I think that may cause some issues as well."

newhampshire,2tok30,laz303,4,Mon Jan 26 15:15:23 2015 UTC,"It can be hours, but during a major storm it is usually 3 days. Worst we've had was about 5-7 days. More remote places can be a week or two."
newhampshire,2tok30,perfectbebop,5,Mon Jan 26 10:07:52 2015 UTC,"It will depend on where you live. Manchester here and used to live around Salmon and Maple, never lost power for more than 5 or 6 hours. Moved a mile and a half north and lost power for 5 or 6 days during the thanksgiving storm."
newhampshire,2tok30,ANewMachine615,2,Mon Jan 26 12:17:31 2015 UTC,"Even then, within a city it can vary hugely. A friend is just up the road from a hospital, and he's never lost power for more than about 8 hours. I used to live at the very end of a long spur, and in the Halloween storm a few years back we were out for nearly a week. Some of our neighbors one street away were on a different part of the grid, and had power back within a day."
newhampshire,2tok30,bnbtnt2,2,Mon Jan 26 17:25:12 2015 UTC,"It really does depend on where you live, ask your neighbors about the history.

newhampshire,2tok30,teefour,2,Mon Jan 26 14:29:51 2015 UTC,"Well PSNH is the shittiest electric provider I've ever dealt with, so probably days if it gets bad. The problem over Thanksgiving was that a bunch of transformers blew up, and those jackasses had only stocked a fraction of what they needed for backup replacement units in an attempt to save money.   This time around with heavy snow and strong wind, it will likely be branches falling and tearing down lines that will knock out power. It's a relatively quick fix, but only once they can get to it. Which guaranteed won't be until Wednesday mid day at the earliest. Those guys can't be climbing a telephone pole in 40mph winds. It depends on your location though. I'm on the rural outskirts of Manchester, so over Thanksgiving the rest of manch has power back in a few hours because of population density, while I didn't get it back for a day and a half."

No male below the age of 18 and no female below the age of 18 shall be capable of contracting a valid marriage between persons of the same gender, and all marriages contracted by such persons shall be null and void.""

newhampshire,2tnrn4,strangerflower,1 point,Mon Jan 26 01:23:41 2015 UTC,"As a gay guy, I'm not sure how to feel about this.  On one hand I think that marriage is way-too-serious a thing for kids that age to consider regardless of pregnancy or whatever but if both want to marry and all parents are OK with it, then that's their business and not mine.  It seems discriminatory to not allow same-gender but at the same time there are an awful lot of kids around that age who haven't really figured out their sexuality yet and if a same-sex couple got married at such a young age I'd be worried about one or both of the kids deciding that they aren't really gay/lesbian/bi/whatever and imagine the crazy tangle of legal/ethical issues and drama that could turn out to be."

I live in Meredith now because it truly is a beautiful town, right on Winni and it comes alive in the summer. However, the increasing influx of tourists and ""summer birds"" have made the traffic hellish. It's a great place to stop and have lunch and a cocktail before you go further north.   Like many of the people commenting the beauty of New Hampshire is REALLY in the White Mountains. Personally I adore leaving Meredith and driving up through Holderness into Plymouth (you go past biddie and biggie squam this way) for a cup of coffee at beidermans. You'll get to see some beautiful mountains and downtown Plymouth is gorgeous! Its also helpful the students are gone for the summer. You can also float the pemi river if you like laying in cool water, navigating timid rapids and taking advantage of your favorite vice.   To give additional support for the people voting for Woodstock/Lincoln I will toss my support that way. Stop in at the brewery, have a blast.   Because New Hampshire is so spread out and the views are so vast you can't really just spend it in one area if you're looking to maximize your visit, so why not take the backroads and go through multiple towns. When you see a place you want to stop, do just that and talk to some locals/get some coffee/get some beer.   If you're up in this area looking for fun anyway, look into the Polar Caves as well. It's a fun day adventure to explore some glacial creations. New Hampshire really has a lot to offer, welcome to the Granite State! We hope you enjoy your visit."

I wouldn't drive there, though, just park at Wal-Mart and take the 50-cent trolley into town.  Don't forget to check out Seacoast Rep - there's an improv show called Dorks and Dungeons every fourth Sunday night, and their other programming is pretty good too.  I also strongly suggest going up Route 4 from there to Emery Farm and picking some blueberries."

It shall be designed not for use as a permanent dwelling but as a temporary dwelling  for recreational camping and vacation use.   But that's not real-estate related per-se.

Market Basket has two Portsmouth locations which I find you can't go wrong with. There's a Trader Joe's in the mall near the movie theater, but as far as I know that get's a little more pricey but aims to be more environmentally friendly and all that good stuff.

newhampshire,2t14bo,g3wd,8,Tue Jan 20 07:44:30 2015 UTC,"Tuesday or Wednesday, Cianbro will begin installing the temporary trestle to allow heavy equipment to construct the new Sarah Long Bridge in Portsmouth. This pile hammer has a 14,000lb solid steel ram that is lifted up by a crane and dropped at a roughly 11' height. As it falls, it triggers a fuel injection pump that injects diesel fuel under the ram into the hammer body. When the ram impacts the bottom anvil, the diesel explodes under sheer pressure and throws the ram back up into the air. The equal and opposite reaction (Newton always wins) will drive a nearly 3 foot diameter steel column (pile) into the ground with 150,000 ft-lbs of energy. This repeats every two seconds."

The new bridge is being made with precast concrete pieces that will be assembled like Lego blocks with some really big cranes.  The area where the metal pile was is going to be the precast yard.  They're going to set up an entire concrete plant and then cast all of the bridge and tower segments there.    After that's done, the metal recycler might be back, but I don't know....it depends on who leases the space from the Port Authority."

newhampshire,2t11az,ghostofpennwast,8,Tue Jan 20 07:02:41 2015 UTC,I like the idea of states having more leeway to teach in the way they think most appropriate and beneficial.

newhampshire,2sxjy9,turboboob,8,Mon Jan 19 13:09:18 2015 UTC,First. Take pictures and document everything.  Then if you are withholding rent make sure that you keep it in a separate account or whatever to pay. Check to see if your town has a housing code and call city hall.
newhampshire,2sxjy9,BettiePlague,5,Mon Jan 19 14:58:30 2015 UTC,"I have argued a 540 case on my own behalf (Pro Se) in the state and I won the case that was brought in front of the New Hampshire Supreme Court, and I am now a landlord.  I know quite a bit about 540 law and if you need me to I can help you, just message me.  The first thing you should really do is take pictures to help with the documentation of your case.  Then, you need to go straight to your district court and file an emergency 540 petition (today).  New Hampshire Legal Aid is a great resource.  The specific thing you have an issue with is a direct violation of New Hampshire RSA 48-A, specifically part II.  Nothing can or should be done without documentation and an emergency 540 petition.    Good luck."

newhampshire,2sxjy9,kathryn13,3,Mon Jan 19 21:28:17 2015 UTC,"Doing the homework is the right first step, so good on you there. Might just need to go a little further, though. There might be a time limit on how long that violation can persist before you can terminate the lease early. I would guess that, until then, you would still be legally obligated to the agreement, namely the rent payment.  Perhaps also check up on laws involving rental space repairs. Leaving a backed up sewage line pulled apart in your living space sounds like a problem on its own. Reread your lease agreement, too."
newhampshire,2sxjy9,kathryn13,3,Mon Jan 19 15:02:58 2015 UTC,"You should file a written complaint with the legal system. It will document the incident and legally protectyou from undue retribution from the landlord.

Although the out of state drivers ARE bad, the drivers from NH are pretty shitty themselves.

You'll find me in the left lane, with some idiot cruising up on my right. The idiot looks at me like, ""why you not letting me in?"". I'm sorry, its not my lane that ended. I knew what lane I had to be in to make the merge easier...this shit happens way too often. I'll never let 'em in.   Basically, what I'm getting at is that NH residents should know their roads, and where they need to be to make their commute easier and to make traffic flow a little more smoothly... surprisingly, I don't find that to be the case for the most part."

I have to say that NH drivers are much better at merging than the Western states (WY, MT, ID) I passed through. They had no concern for mergers at all and had no concept of checking their mirrors. The big trucks were the worst offenders.  In Seattle there's a serious lack of directional use that I miss. Also people forget to turn their headlights on all the time even at night. They are also more passive aggressive than outright aggressive.  I think it's more about every region driving differently and people new to the area having trouble adjusting.

My point is that through organization, these groups gain power that far outstrips the individual's.   So, you want to use your power of large organization to tell other people what to do? What's the difference? Voting makes it OK? What if not everyone agrees to be bound by the results of the vote.

newhampshire,2s3n1e,gungungun123456,3,Sun Jan 11 22:17:48 2015 UTC,"Any gun dealer is going to need you to fill out a form swearing your not a felon, alien, mental, or otherwise prohibited. They then call the state PD (handguns) or feds (long guns) to run a background check. You should be in/out in 15-20 minutes.  Some of the larger shops should have a good selection of used guns, in my experience KTP doesn't have much cheap but Shooters Outpost or Riley's in Hooksett may.   Newer Taurus guns are actually quite nice contrary to what others have stated, it's the Hi-Points you should stay away from as the price point may be tempting but they're particularly dangerous to new gun owners given their shoddy construction. Used Rugers are usually the best bargain.  If it's a long gun you're looking for, Walmart and Dick's usually have some cheap ghetto blaster shotguns for under $200 that work just fine.  All the good deals on Armlist disappear quick, so if you know the market and keep an eye on it great, but a lot of sellers will want to see a pistol permit ($10 at your local PD)  Do take a safety class if you are new to guns, or at the very least have an experienced gun owner give you a kitchen table version of one. Shit, show up to a club on a weekend and ask and someone will take the time I assure you."
newhampshire,2s3n1e,DieCommieScum,2,Mon Jan 12 02:11:54 2015 UTC,You can also check out /r/NHGuns   It's a pretty new sub so it's somewhat dead but you'll find some more information over there.  /u/And_Dan has some really good information for you below but I'd recommend you stay away from guns like Taurus. They've got a pretty horrible reputation for quality and can be more dangerous to the owner than they are to anyone else.  What are you looking for? /r/Guns is a good place to start if you want to talk to other people about recommendations. There are a number of NH residents on there as well.
newhampshire,2s3n1e,grafvonorlok,3,Mon Jan 12 00:45:40 2015 UTC,"Gotta agree with your opinion on Taurus. Unfortunately, OP mentioned cheap, not reliable. Normally I wouldnt recommend them.

newhampshire,2s3n1e,g3wd,1 point,Mon Jan 12 06:32:14 2015 UTC,"What kind of gun? If you need something inexpensive just to have around the house, you can't go wrong with a shotgun.  Head to Kittery Trading Post and look in they're used shotgun section. You could probably pick up a used 12 gauge pump action for between $200-$250. Maybe even a bit less. Even in their used handgun section you might be able to pick up something for under $250, like a Kel-Tec or Taurus.   Or head to a Sports Authority and pick up a new Maverick 88 12 gauge. They're inexpensive (around $220 new) and are reliable enough.   You could also check out Armslist NH if you want a private party sale, but the seller might ask for an ID and a pistol permit. Finding one cheap on there might be tough though."

As long as you're not a felon, drug addict, or have police record with convictions for violent crimes, you should be good to go. You fill out a one page form called a 4473 at the gun counter. They call your info in then wait 15-20 minutes. Then you walk out the door with  your new gun.   If you buy a handgun in Kittery though, the process is the exact same except they have to drive the gun over the  border to their NH firearms transfer building before they can  give it you. It's literally a 5 minute drive right over the bridge in Portsmouth.   edit: If this is your first gun, I'd highly recommend taking some classes on basic safety."

In order to buy from an FFL you must be 21.  You could also buy private sale from armslist.com, often people will want a CCW (or a Pistol/Revolver Permit here in NH) to prove you can own a gun.

Most people who live in town are low income and/or living off the system...not many cultured/educated people and what not. Unless you want to work at one of the prisons, nursing homes, hospital, or biomass plant, there aren't many jobs that pay decently. Those that do have decent pay are very competitive. Like every town, there are good neighborhoods and bad neighborhoods, but the better ones are a bit harder to find/require you to have some money. Not horribly much in the way of major crimes in town, but lots of stupid stuff (noise complaints, shoplifting, etc.). Drugs (especially narcotics, Rx meds, and heroin) are starting to become a problem too. As far as charm goes, Gorham is much more charming.   Good things? If you're really into the outdoors there are TONS of snowmobile/ATV/hiking trails, fishing holes, wooded areas for hunting. We're about 20 minutes away from Mount Washington and there's more than plenty of protected forest to go around. Berlin is also home to Androscoggin Valley Hospital; don't get me wrong, it ain't no Boston Hospital but having been to every other hospital in the North Country due to my line of work, I can say with confidence it's one of the better facilities in the north.

There are some really nice little villages up here, and some that are kinda...not so scenic. (not scary, just a wide spot in the road with some gas pumps. <cough>Danbury<cough>).   North of 89 is where you start to get more elevation. South of 89 you've got Mt Sunapee and Mt Monadnock. Monadnock is a nice climb, and I like Keene a lot. Great downtown.  Sunapee...I assume you can climb Sunapee to some kind of peak, but I've never heard of anyone doing it.  It depends on where you're working. Concord is pretty much the limit for the hard-core Boston commuters. It's doable if you're Nashua, and pretty easy if you're in Manchester. There's also a good amount of ""rural"" west of 93, but the more convenient it is to the highway, the more you're going to pay."

newhampshire,2s0sz8,Usernamemeh,0,Sun Jan 11 02:13:01 2015 UTC,How about having a discussion on the impacts of community college in New Hampshire instead of down voting. And the policies supporting community college and who benefits and who pays.   I admire Ross Gittell's work and what he had done to implement courses that will prepare lower income workforce for businesses in the New England area and worked with business to find out what training they needed in employees to work at there companies.  With that said who is paying for this education is the question and who is benefitting from it most is the question that should be asked. Just like GE and Halliburton using taxpayer funded military for there workforce education and workforce needs to make profitable companies. Are the companies who profit from these community colleges and workforce paying there fare share or are they relying on tax payers and low income workforce to take out debt for this education.

Do not underestimate Mount Washington. September is a good time to visit, but pay close attention to the summit forecast. It could be a gorgeous fall day in the 70's at the base, with strong winds and sub-freezing temperatures at the summit. On the other hand, the view from the summit on a clear day is absolutely spectacular...you just have to block out all the tourists who drive or ride the railway up.  If the weather is iffy for the Big One but you guys still want to do some hiking, I would strongly recommend a loop up and down Mount Lafayette (Old Bridle Path > Greenleaf Trail > Franconia Ridge Trail [part of the AT!] > Falling Waters Trail). Still a big mountain (by New England standards!) and a really beautiful, all-day hike. There's an AMC hut about a mile from the summit that sells some food and you can even book bunks there if you want.   One place I think you should hit up in Boston is the Harpoon Brewery. They have a huge selection of their fresh beer and also make some pretty amazing hot pretzels.   Anyway, this sounds like an awesome trip! Have fun!"

Your costs here should have stayed pretty neutral or gone down a hair.  The second portion is energy supply. When you saw the letters and postcards last year for competitive suppliers, it was the energy supply they were selling, and they were all selling natural gas supply, because nat gas is the cheapest generating fuel. We have tons of it in the States, but it's hard to get it here due to pipeline limitations. In the winter, home heating uses get priority, followed by industrial and generation. So it's not just a matter of gas being expensive - it's not available. Some of the competitive supply based on nat gas contracts either evaporates or becomes very expensive. Many of your alternatives are now more expensive than your default utility. This is possibly less so in Unitil and Liberty territory right now - PSNH generates a lot if its own power with a mix of fuels, and can play one against another to temper increases. I'm not trying to be dramatic when I say that this is a crisis for our region, and will be until we find a way to get more power or more gas (or both) into the region."

newhampshire,2rim10,tommysmuffins,4,Tue Jan 6 21:45:36 2015 UTC,Leave it to politicians to come up with exactly wrong answer.  The gas tax is a good tax because it incentivizes efficiency.
newhampshire,2rim10,the_bigZ,2,Tue Jan 6 14:59:20 2015 UTC,"Then the gas tax would need to increase quite a bit. Sure efficiency is key, but like they said, they are losing money to maintain major roads."

newhampshire,2rim10,OwenMoney,2,Tue Jan 6 17:50:06 2015 UTC,"It incentivizes the efficiency of individual vehicles, but not necessarily the efficiency of the system. As cars become more and more efficient, it's less financially painful to drive, so people may drive longer distances and drive alone more often. Two hybrids with single passengers will use as much or more fuel compared to one mid-size sedan with two carpoolers.  Road construction and maintenance costs are probably more closely tied to vehicle miles traveled than fuel efficiency, so it may make more sense to tax on miles than fuel consumption.

Buy your own 100lb tanks and dolly them to get filled (pain in the ass/back) Buy outright a 250lb or bigger tank and have a plumber connect it, then call around asking for cash price on delivery when there's about 33% left.

I use a wood stove most of the time, so my monthly propane usage is low (except for days like today, when even if I was home all day the heat would still kick in to keep things livable).

So not management as the actual manager, he was awesome and did a good job, but the management of the restaurant on a whole. There was a lot of independent responsibility for the Loaf put into the hands of people who didn't care what happened (young and inexperienced). There was a ton of food waste and I know for a fact there was a ton of internal theft of both money and food. My first night as a shift manager there was a whole shift worth of money taken (they found out who did it...it wasn't me). Not sure what the insurance was like on the building but we had a couple of floods that completely wiped out stock and caused a lot of damage almost every other year.   Again, this is just the stuff I saw my self but both my brothers, my sister in law, her sister, and a ton of other friends/small group of people I know all worked there right around the same time and all saw bad practices."

newhampshire,2rcx7a,skankersores,8,Mon Jan 5 02:43:00 2015 UTC,"Cold Weather: get some all weather tires on your car. A warm hat, waterproof gloves, a decent winter jacket, and waterproof boots will get you through the winter. Actually, the Seacoast is pretty mild compared to the rest of New England for both temp and snow. You don't need four wheel drive in most places around the shipyard but rear wheel drive is not recommended. if you drive a truck, fill that bed with sandbags to avoid fishtailing. Avoid housing with natural gas heating in winter gets expensive.   Fun things: Depends on your interests. There's live music, theater, a legit cigar bar, plenty of breweries, some trail systems in Portsmouth and neighboring towns for easygoing hiking, trail running, or biking. Skiing and more rugged hiking are up north.   Eating: Kittery has some excellent restaurants: Black Birch, Anju, Robert's, and Loco Coco's are all favorites. Across the river in NH, try The Portsmouth Brewery, The Black Trumpet, The Coat of Arms (great local bar with a good kitchen), Radici, The District, Rudi's are all good. This is not a complete list there are tons of great places at all price points.   Must do: Breweries. There are a ton of them in the area. Smuttynose is the biggest and produces a lit of great beer. Throwback, Stoneface, and Earth Eagle are outstanding. The Portsmouth Brewery is a great brewpub. Tributary is a new brewery opened by local brewing legend Tod Mott."

newhampshire,2rcx7a,autowikibot,2,Mon Jan 5 18:50:38 2015 UTC,"Just want to reiterate, going with winter/summer tires is generally superior particularly if you're driving a sedan.   Also highly recommend waterproof boots and if there's a ton of snow and you're trying to shovel your car out real quick in the morning tie them tightly. You don't want to have wet socks all day.   Personal recommendation for someone new to the area would be to check out a lot of the beaches both in Southern Maine and New Hampshire (can skip Hampton beach unless you want to see why our downvote button is Massachusetts). Every beach around there kind of has it's own little personality.   Would also highly recommend checking out the Kangamangus Highway in good weather. I've been all over the country and it's one of the most scenic drives in the lower 48.   Lastly hiking Mt. Major to get an epic view of Lake Winnepesaukee is sort of a local tradition. It's a relatively easy hike and you don't need to be super fit or anything to do it.  I'm a bit of the outdoorsy type so if you're into any of that and want any specific recommendations regarding camping, snowmobiling or ATV trails feel free to shoot me a DM."

newhampshire,2rayiq,bostonmolasses,-1,Mon Jan 5 18:11:34 2015 UTC,That is also only half of how it works the other part is determining the property tax rate which is different for every town depending on services and budget for that town
newhampshire,2rayiq,bostonmolasses,3,Mon Jan 5 21:01:14 2015 UTC,"true. but the tax rate is the same for all property within the town. the dra determines the tax rate based on the town's budget and the estimated fair market value of property within the town. the dra also determines the equalization ratio. but my point is that it would be unconstitutional for new hampshire to ""raise the property taxes on lawns."""
newhampshire,2rayiq,skankersores,-1,Tue Jan 6 15:09:15 2015 UTC,But having a nicely groomed lawn does enhance the property value and a town could raise the rates to have a service that enforces lawns are maintained to standard.

newhampshire,2r3w0n,danesworld44,5,Fri Jan 2 17:03:46 2015 UTC,I'm still not too sure about what caused the initial accident. It looks like there was about 3 cars that were in front of me that escaped with some minor scratched so I'm assuming they braked and the person behind them wasn't prepared to brake combined with the black ice. I was able to initially avoid hitting the car in front of me but then I got tagged a few times from cats behind me that weren't able to break.

newhampshire,2r1hzy,RickyDiezal,1 point,Fri Jan 2 02:19:38 2015 UTC,The written is all based on signs and the driving takes 5-10 instead of 15 to 20. As long as you look backwards for reverse parking you pass

newhampshire,2r1hzy,gnilmit,1 point,Fri Jan 2 03:23:34 2015 UTC,"It depends on the person giving the test. I had to parallel park, but most of my friends who went to the same facility did not.  I don't know of anyone who had to get on the highway, but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen elsewhere. It might depend how close the DMV is to the highway.  Whatever you do, try to practice in the car you'll be taking the exam in. You want to be comfortable doing each step in that car. If you're worried, it can also be a lot easier to do in a small car.  You probably also want to make sure you're good at reverse perpendicular. There may not be easy access to a spot for parallel near the DMV, but they can always ask you to back in."

newhampshire,2r0mtg,sidepocket13,1 point,Thu Jan 1 19:40:28 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hijack your thread but I was hoping I could ask a ennui related question. I have a functioning fireplace, but it basically gives off no heat. I've considered getting an insert,  Just to supplement the oil. Any suggestions?"
newhampshire,2r0mtg,DieCommieScum,2,Thu Jan 1 20:21:01 2015 UTC,"Modern fireplaces are mostly for decoration and offer little in the way of heat, in fact, they cool the other rooms of the house as the draft sucks in outside air through cracks and such.  In olden times, they got heat out of them by the fireplace being taller, of a different shape, and with most if not all of the chimney being in the living space as to keep the heat indoors as long as possible. If yours is an older house where maybe it was intended for providing heat, a heat reflector (basically a giant piece of metal on the back wall of the fireplace) cast a good amount of heat back into the room.  Shy of an insert, you can install a door and blower into an existing fireplace and get meaningful heating out of it. Though I'm not sure of the value proposition there.  I heat with wood, with the oil heat only being a supplement for if we are away for an extended period of time. My suggestion to you would be invest in a woodstove insert as they pay for themselves very quickly in saved oil (even at today's prices and even if you buy the wood)"
newhampshire,2r0mtg,sidepocket13,1 point,Thu Jan 1 21:27:15 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback. I never expected the fireplace to rely be a heat source but with the recent history of multiple day power outages something to give me a little peace of mind would be nice

newhampshire,2qx6ab,GregoryPeck92,17,Wed Dec 31 14:36:00 2014 UTC,"It goes both ways in NH as far as my experience goes. They will give you an ""Official"" warning which involves paperwork, or they may give you an ""Unofficial"" warning which is literally just a verbal warning.   If you didnt receive paperwork, than it was most likely just an unofficial verbal warning. I doubt its actually in the system anywhere.   I could be wrong however, but this is just my experience."
newhampshire,2qx6ab,mrjackspade,9,Wed Dec 31 14:56:54 2014 UTC,"They're more likely to produce a written warning for mechanical issues (like a broken taillight) to document that you were advised to fix it. Those are tracked so that they can issue a ticket if you should happen to be pulled over for it again. Verbal warnings are more common for minor infractions such as a rolling stop where it's less hassle for the officer to just reprimand the driver and be on his way.   edit: If you get a written warning for a mechanical issue, keep it in your car in case another department pulls you over before the time frame to get it fixed expires."
newhampshire,2qx6ab,Lillipout,-2,Wed Dec 31 16:25:22 2014 UTC,"I never understood the attitude of cops to reprimand people.  Their job is to enforce the law, not warn you that they may enforce the law.  I understand they have lots of leeway, but they aren't our masters or parents."
newhampshire,2qx6ab,Bathroomdestroyer,5,Thu Jan 1 00:00:24 2015 UTC,"They still take note of the warnings. The police take note of all actions they do. It may not tell us what the warnings are for, but I would imagine they can see what it's for.  Source"
newhampshire,2qx6ab,TheCowIsOkay,2,Wed Dec 31 16:33:45 2014 UTC,"I also have no idea either way, but my guess is that the trooper ran the plate as he was being pulled over, so there's at least tracks of that in the system. So I would treat it as though there was a ""real"" warning in the respect that the next trooper that pulls him over will know that this happened."

newhampshire,2qx6ab,bowhuntNHslayer,2,Wed Dec 31 16:24:58 2014 UTC,"Police in Massachusetts and New Hampshire respond to infractions in three ways: verbal warnings, written warnings and written citations (tickets). The verbal warnings don't result in any paperwork or marks on your record, as far as I know.   What will appear on your record, as far as your vehicle's registration is concerned, was that your license plate was run at that location by that police officer. If you get pulled again, when they run your plate, they'll see that and will likely ask about it."
newhampshire,2qx6ab,Lillipout,1 point,Wed Dec 31 17:34:19 2014 UTC,i received a written warning while on my bike for not wearing eye protection while riding.  I'm no cop but i believe if they desire to issue a warning they are suppose to document it (issue a paper) so its documented in the system in case you do it again.  but a warning is the same amount of work as a ticket to issue so i think you got a personal warning from the trooper who didn't want to fill out paperwork

If you became homeless, you wouldn't have the funds to keep or maintain your nice car. Car homeless people are the mythical ""down on your luck"" people with families and too much pride to panhandle. They are the ones that actually take you up on the offer of work for food, and are the ones that make up the small percentage of homeless that get back into a house and job on their own.   If you are addicted to heroin, you would sell your car without thinking for just a single hit, then immediately start looking for another one to steal so you could get the next hit. Rationality of any kind goes out the door once addiction kicks in. Hence morbidly obese people taking their metformin with a milkshake chaser, smokers claiming they can't breathe without a cigarette, and junkies getting shot by the dealers they try to steal from, not a day or so after that same junkie sold the dealer a stolen gun to get another dose of their personal poison.   Again, if you're the sort of person that thinks about whether they would sell their car in the event of homelessness, you probably don't need to worry about it."

Much like anything, if one person gets away with it, a bunch will follow.    And just for the record, manchester has a lot of great services for the homeless. If someone is panhandling, it is because they want beer, drugs, or cigarettes. Seriously. Give them money if you would like, but it's going to buy them beer, drugs, or cigarettes.   Source: I am a community based social worker in Manchester. Clients tell me all the time about panhandling for cigarette money."
newhampshire,2qtp3u,SceebyDeeby,5,Wed Dec 31 01:02:18 2014 UTC,"I do that sort of work too. Anyone in the system who would end up a homeless crazy person has most of their basic needs met, so yes, every penny you give them goes to cigs and booze, giving me cancer and stinky clothes, and necessitating yet another talk about how if they still want to live in the home/apartment with staff assistance, they need to be drug and alcohol free. Which of course is met with all the genuine remorse your three-year-old gives when you catch them sneaking cookies. If you ever feel like your opinion of humanity is too pessimistic, take a job in some sort of human services, and prepare to see the depths it can sink to. For every inspiring story I've sort of maybe witnessed, I have twenty of someone deliberately self-destructing their lives while maintaining it was everyone else's fault."
newhampshire,2qtp3u,dave603,3,Wed Dec 31 01:27:53 2014 UTC,"Yes and no. I work in mental health, so I understand why severe and persistent mental illness is highly correlated with homelessness. It seems crazy to us, but for some folks it's easier to be homeless because of their illness. Some people are abandoned by their families at a young age and are never taught how to maintain a home. And you are right, for each person that uses services the way they are intended, there are 3 who abuse the system. Some people would rather be homeless so their food, clothing, and shelter are free so they can spend all their money on beer and drugs.  It's tough to work in this field sometimes, when your job is to advocate for people but you know they are abusing the services you try so badly to get people."
newhampshire,2qtp3u,SceebyDeeby,2,Wed Dec 31 01:48:10 2014 UTC,"I'm not even sure they abuse, so much as they are taught to. I've seen perfectly capable people treated like complete babies, and they learn to live up to that  level of expectation. Drives me nuts watching them turn helplessness on and off like a light switch depending on who they're talking to that day. ""Help me figure out how much it is for one of these paper towels if they're two for five dollars! I can't do it!"" Then later they do some weird quantum calculations to scrape up enough for a pack of American Spirits, giving the clerk exact change in Yap island stone coins, deuschtmarks and halfpennies or some craziness.  And I think the sort of person you may be thinking of in the first area is likely very schizophrenic, and probably lacks the skills to panhandle consistently as the pros do. I work with the deaf disabled, and only ever met one mentally ill guy who almost couldn't keep it together enough to sign paperwork and show up for med time, and he was so off the wall that it was something of a miracle when he could string two sentences together. After a decade, he was the only one I've seen who was almost too gone to stay in a program, but not quite bad enough for a spot in a mental hospital.   Unless the ratio is way different in the hearing population, I'm guessing it's a safe bet that the panhandler has some kind of home they go back to, if they are genuinely unable to take care of themselves, and aware of it, that is. I'm sure there are tons of method heads and heroin users who think they're doing ""just fine"", as they bed down in their local crack den."
newhampshire,2qtp3u,BegetterTwo,2,Wed Dec 31 02:14:18 2014 UTC,"Are you sure the people some of us are talking about are people like you treat?  Many of the people out here are nothing more than professional panhandlers.

Amazing transformation when you have the time to watch."
newhampshire,2qtp3u,ashleyxcouture,3,Wed Dec 31 03:45:05 2014 UTC,"Nah, my guys don't have that kind of motivation. My clients at least are mostly mentally disabled rather than current addicts, DTs are a hell of a motivation.  Principle is the same. Claim we steal their food stamps, don't feed them, haven't eaten in days, and so on. Really a matter of degree. I can certainly see a few who would do it, given a bit of teaching and someone to drive them to primo spots. Then again, because deaf people value directness, at least we can call them out for acting like terrible smelly bums, that stigma helps to curb it a tiny bit."

Him and I took a bike ride over there recently and came to find out that they've switched over to RV's primarily in that area.  Also I've seen panhandlers working shifts as others mentioned happens in Manchester.  They're always right at the entrances to the city too (DW Highway from exit 36, Whole Foods on Amherst St, Hudson Bridge into Nashua, etc.  It's completely absurd to be honest because it just gives Nashua a worse reputation (which I don't think the city has entirely earned)."

Mom grabbed me by the sleeve and directed me away from the woman who was wearing about 30 layers of clothing (think, bird lady from Home Alone) and pushing a little buggy. We sat down waiting to board and this lady, now seated in a corner across from us, reached into her bra  and pulled out a gigantic roll of money. Larger than a softball, all hundreds.

I live in Concord, and work in a very public setting where interacting with these panhandlers and homeless individuals happens on a daily basis.  The people of Concord have surely gotten tired of the countless panhandlers on the medians of every major intersection / retail district in town. I do feel bad for these people, don't get me wrong, and after talking to many of them they really are generally good people at heart (for the most part), but I no longer give them money.  People like to donate money to see results, but when you see the same guy begging day after day, you know that dollar you gave him three days ago didn't do too much. Then I got to thinking about the results I wished I would see by giving my money to these people, which brought me to my idea....  If these homeless people spent their time cleaning up our city's streets and generally doing things that give back to the community, even in small ways, I for one would be MUCH more willing to spare some money to them.  Not sure exactly how to pitch this idea to the vast population of homeless, and something tells me that since they are incapable of spending their time attempting to find a job, that they would be unwilling to take on such a task, but hey it's a solid idea, right?"
newhampshire,2qtp3u,wtfdizzy,4,Wed Dec 31 08:35:57 2014 UTC,"This was sort of the impetus behind the New Deal and, more recently, the mythical ""shovel-ready job"" that Obama wanted to give. Problem now is that it's cheaper to ignore homeless and import some more H1-Bs than it is to go through the painful process of trying to rehabilitate a drug addict (almost never works, that's why people who kick the habit are usually so successful after, because it takes a strong support network and some kick-ass willpower), train them into a manufacturing or tech job (because if they've ever talked to a cop with a drug within ten miles of their body, good luck getting a job in education or nursing), then deal with the fallout when they stop showing up to the training program or job, fall off the wagon, and need to be rehabbed again.   Real solution is to somehow build up the family unit again, promote strong communities, provide meaningful, ability-appropriate employment for as many people as you can, find some way to enable parents to be able to support a family on one paycheck, and try to maximize education for as many people as possible. Or, in other words, discover cold fusion and fairy dust."

I remember there was a study or interview out there somewhere, where one guy stated that he made almost $80,000 in one year from doing this. And within the next few years it's blown up. In the Nashua area, I've seen people get out of brand new cars in the plaza across from the pheasant lane mall in Tyngsboro (near dunkin donuts), walk through the woods, and I would see them at the light with a sign 5 - 10 minutes later. Also, the Burger King on Amherst St there is a girl that's always out there, while this guy sits in a dodge ram in the parking lot (picture from a few weeks ago). Which is obviously a marketing tactic, since more people would feel sympathetic towards a struggling female.

Also possibly Waterville Valley. Sunapee in particular has a lot of grooming and is not too much further than Pat's but can be crowded. I think Cannon is great but its on the harder/steeper side of things for the most part. Bretton Woods isnt bad but is kind of resorty and crowded. Crotched is closer but not quite as big. It has lots of good blues and late night skiing for most of the season. Ragged and Gunstock also fit that category of mid size mountains that arent too far away. If distance is no real issue then you could look into Stratton (VT), Attitash, Burke (VT) (I refuse to call it anything else), and Black Mountain in New Hampshire. Black will have the least amount of crowds and its a great little mountain when the snow is good and you can deal with a kind of slow main chair. Its also cheap but its up above north conway so its a hike.   Best bet is to check out the trail maps to see where the blues are, if there are easy ways down from the top or what. You can also check here to sort the new england resorts by the percentage of the trails by difficulty...greens, blues, etc: http://www.onthesnow.com/northeast/ski-resorts.html?&ud=0&o=intermed"

newhampshire,2qpr8k,Threepointergood,5,Tue Dec 30 20:11:51 2014 UTC,"Well circumcising others at an age without significant benefit or consent is a human rights' violation. Not really hard to figure out.  What is more concerning is the total disregard of anatomy and the beneficial aspect of foreskin in general when people start circumcising infants and discuss how ""the benefits outweigh the risks"".   It boils down to financial incentives and an ignorant medical community/culture.   As for me, I would never want someone to remove parts of my penis. But since they could, they did, and now I am permanently and sexually handicapped. Who defends the defenseless?"
newhampshire,2qpr8k,lubed_out_to_dry,9,Mon Dec 29 17:43:18 2014 UTC,"But it should not be a parent's choice. They will never have any consequence of the penis that is circumcised. The person who will use it for sexual pleasure is the only person who should have the right to choose  (except extreme, less than .01% of medical issues and no, that does not include phimosis since many physicians incorrect diagnosis young boys). It is not even comparable to vaccinations, not by a long shot, since condoms are still required. Circumcision is like napalming your own troops to kill a few enemies. Vaccinations are like intelligence for a military and helps to defend and prepare for a future attack. Genital cutting cannot be and should not be, a right for parent's to choose. And many are not given informed consent where physicians will push the practice and never state that the foreskin has benefits, only downside and circumcision helps to prevent disease and infection. Incorrect and misleading.    who parents are idiots and didn't give them a choice being circumcised isn't going to destroy their lives or impact their sex lives.   I disagree and many others like myself who experience complications. For me, it has not only deafened my sexual experience but harmed my own identity because I had assumed I was intact until I was 18. I thought the mobile skin was going to grow in with puberty. I had many, many misconceptions and now I struggle with suicidal thoughts and obsessing over being circumcised every day.  I wake up wishing I could just tug my penis without lube and masturbate, but the truth is I cannot. Circumcision takes a simplistic range of sexual motion and destroys it if enough is removed. And the most sensitive areas (ridged band of nerves, frenulum, triangular delta) are either obliterated or crippled with the operation. In American culture, there is a huge assumption that the foreskin provides no benefits and as a result many physicians do not give it a second thought as they too were either circumcised or grew up in a circumcision-positive culture."

The transitional region from the external to the internal prepuce is the most sensitive region of the uncircumcised penis and more sensitive than the most sensitive region of the circumcised penis. Circumcision ablates the most sensitive parts of the penis."

If she was 17 they could probably go with something like attempted child pornography, but they said at the end of the article exactly what the issue is:   They later explained that the only law applicable to the case was the abuse of power statute, under which a public official is guilty of a misdemeanor if he or she knowingly commits an unauthorized act ""which purports to be an act of his office"" or ""knowingly refrains from performing a duty imposed on him by law or clearly inherent in the nature of his office.""

It seems to me that the prosecutors have uncovered some evidence which would make this more than just a bald accusation.

Washington in November in a t-shirt and need heli rescue to come and treat your hypothermia, and you have to pay.  Does a hiker need to pay now (without the benefit of a card), if he or she doesn't do anything irresponsible?"
newhampshire,2q73pu,tommysmuffins,8,Tue Dec 23 19:26:21 2014 UTC,"It's still the same for non-card holders.  There's a piece on the Faq that covers what the card gets you, and that is coverage when you are negligent but not reckless.  However, if you're buying the Hike Safe card, you're unlikely to be negligent in the first place. It's a way for hikers to voluntarily fund Search and Rescue which we have historically used the most while never paying into."

Now, if it was a non-pompous ninny, well then, I say take that opinion to the bank. But for the non-pompous ninnies, let me reiterate as some of you seem to be having a problem with understanding English.  At no point did the article or the poster say that any of the referenced sources were from a bastion of conservative ideology and were anything but op-ed.  It simply indicated that a number of op-ed columns from various newspapers were not in-fact pleased with the actions of O'Brien.   But you seem to be very defensive so by all means continue to twist things to suit your agenda.  Keep up the fight, because without angry, self righteous non-pompous ninnies like yourself, those of us that actually appreciate the interplay of various opinions when it comes to trying to understand a situation would have no one to laugh at."

At $900, you'll have just enough rope to hang yourself with unless you have some friends or family in your back pockets. It will take you a while yo find work unless you go south, even then your background and having moved recently hurts you, and if you don't have a car, you might as well become neo-primitivist now so you can prepare for not being able to access 90% of modern life. New Hampshire's social welfare services are far less than other areas, and the chances of finding a shelter that will let you stay long enough to ""get back on your feet"" are very low. Charity begins at home in NH, and that leaves strange transients from down south out of luck.  Remember, lots of people will tell you to move, and how wonderful it will be, but when you run out of cash, they won't be the ones freezing to death on the sidewalk. Get your life together before you make a sudden move, and you'll be much happier. If you couldn't afford living on a part time job with a roommate, what makes you think it'll work without one?   Job first, then nest egg, then move. Be smart and be safe. Wherever you are probably seems terrible, but you have a computer, food, and enough spare time to play a lot of TF2, so it's not all bad.

newhampshire,2q1jyu,DukeofAlbany,5,Mon Dec 22 13:49:58 2014 UTC,"If you prefer city life, Concord and Manchester are nice but small, as are Nashua and Keene.  Boston MA and Portland ME are both fine cities relatively near by with the same climate and more or less the same attitude.  As for a nice rural life, NH has vast woodlands, beautiful lakes, and mountains big enough to be interesting but small enough to climb in a day.  There's a number of really nice classic New England ski resorts in NH as well as neighboring ME and VT, most have resort villages at the base.  All of these resorts have their own snow making capabilities so they will be open regardless of what falls on it's own.  Aside from the cities and a few bus routes, there is pretty much no public transportation in NH at all.  You need a reliable vehicle that can handle icy conditions.  The cities and towns are pretty spread out, so walking or cycling everywhere would be tough.  There's an international airport in Manchester (the largest city in NH).  If you need public transportation, the Amtrak Downeaster runs along the southeastern part of the state and up through Portland Maine and into Brunswick.  This could give a non-driver a way to live in NH and still commute to Boston for work if you can't find any in NH.  Boston MA is the largest nearby city and has a full public transit system (subways, buses, trains, etc.)  As for what to do, NH has a booming tourist industry in the summer with no shortage of fun seasonal jobs.  I've noticed a lot of places up north have websites that are horrible by 1990s standards and could really use some help.  I'm sure there's plenty of businesses still ancient computers that are desperately in need of upgrading.  I'm still blown away by the number of old monochrome terminals I keep seeing everywhere.  The winters are long and cold, but I've greatly enjoyed many winters working at a ski resort.  That said, if I could work at one anywhere in the country, I'd likely go out west to the Rockies.  A bag of herb will still get you arrested in NH although there's been a push lately to relax that.  It's decriminalized in MA, ME and VT, so if it's something you enjoy, maybe look outside NH in the same general area."

newhampshire,2pvy4p,gnilmit,8,Sat Dec 20 23:33:36 2014 UTC,I am filled with outrage over this latest turn of events.  The Pumpkinfest organizers are being handed a massive bill because Keene State College can't police their students during a family festival in Keene.  This is just disgusting.  If the KSC wants to make amends to the citizens of New Hampshire and the residents of Keene then they can start by covering the cost of this bill.
newhampshire,2pvy4p,skankersores,5,Sat Dec 20 14:41:31 2014 UTC,How many of the people arrested in relation to the riots were KSC students?
newhampshire,2pvy4p,skankersores,2,Sat Dec 20 19:40:22 2014 UTC,The full tally has not been made yet as arrests are still on-going.  KSC has censured 170 of their students in relation to the riots.  This number also continues to grow as more arrests are made.
newhampshire,2pvy4p,skankersores,5,Sat Dec 20 20:02:46 2014 UTC,"I'm just not sure what the answer is here. A lot of the parties originated from off-campus apartments from what I understand, and it's not like KSC can just lock everyone in their rooms for the duration of Pumpkin Fest, especially considering so many of the people there are from UNH, Plymouth, or one of the UMass schools."

This happened because KSC students acted irresponsibly, invited a bunch of friends from neighboring colleges to the city, and then watched as their guests ripped the town apart.  I am sure nobody intended for this to happen, but what did these students think was going to happen when they are promoting a raging party at their small college?  The days of just getting drunk and screwing indiscriminately to blow off steam are over.  These days it is all about getting completely wasted and destroying as much property as possible.

These days it is all about getting completely wasted and destroying as much property as possible.""  If that were even remotely true then shouldn't be seeing the scene we saw at Pumpkin Fest this year at every university across the country on normal Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights? This is totally isolated to Keene State, so let's not paint an entire generation with such a negative brush.  That said, between last year and this year, the events that have gone down have become legend and will continue to attract the troublemakers in the future.  I'm not as much concerned with the cost of this years events, because there really isn't a good answer as the only people who are truly responsible are those who did damage to innocent people's property so good luck on that, but what the answer is to this issue in years to come. I'm of college age and so I know it's the thing to do on Halloween weekend now. Similar to Spring Fling at Umass (though they have their own separate sets of issues so I hesitate to bring it up) in the sense that you can go, get drunk and see some crazy shit.   Overall, I have no answer to this whole issue, but I think it's of Pumpkin Fest and KSC's best interest to formulate a plan or expect the exact same consequences, probably worse."
newhampshire,2pvy4p,omdq,1 point,Sat Dec 20 22:16:44 2014 UTC,"The issue is a moot point anyway.  I think finding festival planners who are going to underwrite the Pumpkinfest in the future will be a near impossible task.  Not too many businesses are interested in financial suicide.  As far as UMass goes- they have their own campus police force.  There are riots there on a routine basis, which is why they have their own force to deal with it.  That college takes responsibility for the actions of their student body, and doesn't expect the people of Massachusetts to foot the bills.  The bills are footed by the students who opt to attend that college.  That is not what has happened at KSC."

According to the article, the process is the same as in years past - organizers agree to pay a portion of overtime costs for emergency service personnel, to be determined after the city council decided how much they will pay. That's all that's happened thus far. The amount is just much bigger because there was much more overtime involved.  If the organizers bring this to Keene State (which seems to be the plan, according to the article) and the college is like, ""LOL, no, we're not paying any of this,"" then I would call it safe to begin outraging."

newhampshire,2puqqa,TheLawIsi,2,Sun Dec 21 20:59:24 2014 UTC,"According to Section 540 of the NH laws, ""A landlord shall not demand or receive any security deposit in an amount or value in excess of one month's rent or $100, whichever is greater.""  It also says that ""A person who rents or leases a single-family residence and owns no other rental property or who rents or leases rental units in an owner-occupied building of 5 units or less shall not be considered a ""landlord'' for the purposes of this subdivision, except for any individual unit in such building which is occupied by a person or persons 60 years of age or older. ""  In other words, someone who rents a lot of apartments and doesn't live in the building is a landlord and can't charge more than one month's rent as security deposit.  Someone who rents out only one place, or who rents out <5 apartments in the same building s/he lives in can charge whatever they want for a security deposit (unless the renter is 60+ years old).

If you look at the drawing of ""Kibby"" that the police drew from what Abby told them, you'll notice it looks nothing like him. That's because it resembles his best friend who also lives in the trailer park and was seen going in and out of Kibby's trailer during the months Abby was ""missing"".

You have a fire department, a storage facility, bass pro, walmart,  a condo complex, rt 3, and 93 all within striking distance. If they were shooting where I think they were shooting they were 100 yds away from it all. What they were using for calibers and backstops and in what direction they were firing will dictate whether the charges are warranted. Felonies seem a bit much though."

They fit you and then bring you items to try in your size, it's not set up in a browsing format. This serves 2 purposes: they can carry more stock and sizes since they aren't dedicated to browsing space, and you don't get your heart set on something that doesn't fit. They carry difficult to find sizes, too. 28-50+ band size, AAA cups up to K. Expensive, but nice to try on before you buy.  I don't think they had fetishwear, though."

If we have to increase capacity I'd rather see it via pipe-line than rail, road or sea.  That being said, I personally think we should be working to use the fuel that our existing infrastructure provides more conservatively rather than expanding capacity so that we can have more for cheaper and continue our use non-renewable resources at ludicrous rates."

newhampshire,2ort6q,PowPowPowerCrystal,1 point,Wed Dec 10 21:12:38 2014 UTC,What are you talking about? The registries cannot reject an easement based on its content.
newhampshire,2ort6q,bostonmolasses,1 point,Thu Dec 11 03:26:26 2014 UTC,Whether a new easement is needed depends entirely upon the language of the original easements.

newhampshire,2ort6q,g3wd,2,Tue Dec 9 18:33:31 2014 UTC,"No, I suppose not.  I really don't have strong feelings about it, although I suspect people whose property will be impacted will.  Especially if it leads to an assessed betterment cost.  I'm wondering whether I'll have an electricity surcharge to fund the project."
newhampshire,2ort6q,Searchlights,3,Thu Dec 11 00:31:02 2014 UTC,"Generally they will go to great lengths to avoid getting an easement on private property that isn't a large undeveloped lot.  Obviously no one wants a cleared swath through their yard, although that's the worst it really does.  As I said in other posts, there's few steel structures more thoroughly scruitinzed than ever single piece and weld of a gas pipeline.  Shouldn't lead to betterment.....it doesn't improve the property, might even detract slightly.  I don't think Kinder Morgan is associated with PSNH....and utilities are really happy for these lines because power plants are the first ones stiffed when supply doesn't meet demand.  Gas plants are used to make up differences in load and their demand varies.....variable demand customers are second to constant-demand customers (like local gas suppliers and gas used for heating in the winter)."

newhampshire,2ort6q,telemecanique,2,Thu Dec 11 04:11:32 2014 UTC,"Mass. already has gas pipelines running through it. My parents have had one right behind their property line for over 40 years now. And there was never any problems. They check for leaking at least 3 times a month.  Edit: before you start, this is NOT a street line, but a major supply line. As a matter of fact there's been more problems with the street line in front of the house than the supply line."
newhampshire,2ort6q,dave603,5,Thu Dec 11 06:09:32 2014 UTC,We build gas pipelines...can confirm.  You wouldn't BELIEVE the quality standards for pipeline steel and weld quality.  Our company has fantastic welders and we still struggle to find the LeBron James types of welding that can do transmission line work.  Every single joint is completely x-rayed.    The welds on a gas pipeline are some of the most heavily scrutinized welds mankind makes on a regular basis.

newhampshire,2oshx7,kathryn13,3,Tue Dec 9 22:17:30 2014 UTC,Not free but my all time favorite hotel is the mount Washington hotel maybe if you rent a block of rooms you could use one of their rooms for cheap since its a ceremony not an entire reception. Also they have a very nice dining room to eat in afterwards. Also the people over at r/weddingplanning are very helpful maybe one of them has done this before. Also if you need a photographer my sister does weddings professionally and shes pretty inexpensive compared to others in the area especially if there is no reception involved.

You could hold the wedding upstairs, which looks like an old theatre, and then have a potluck reception downstairs where there is a full kitchen. You need to be a resident to get it on the cheap though.  Also, I went to a wedding reception at Daniel's of Henniker. Very small (about 22). Very intimate. Right on the river for beautiful views. Individual menus for guests. I believe it was very affordable and my friend, the bride, said they were very helpful and went out of their may to make it successful.   At that time of year the Audubon at Lake Massabesic might be an interesting choice...or the location in Concord.

I live in southern NH and have experienced the exact attitudes mentioned above, from transplanted MA folks.

Since we have no sales or income taxes, a huge part of our schools, roads and services are paid for with our high property taxes. Which the mass holes take advantage of. I worked at a ski shop in Salem in high school and that's what most of the people were doing.   Also they tend to drive like shit."

newhampshire,2onuf8,Tharkun,0,Mon Dec 8 18:20:42 2014 UTC,"Why do you assume that they blame all gun crime solely on NH guns?

If we're going to get rid of all illegal guns, then they have to be strictly controlled everywhere, and that's a constitutional issue."

Not only will they do this, but they also change our social policies and don't understand the culture.  Example - a Masshole I know of called the police on a guy open carrying a handgun on the 4th of July.  Not only was it completely legal, but the guy was obviously exercising his right to be ""'Murican"" on the 4th of July (not up to no good, or threatening people or anything like that).  Personally I believe he should have just concealed it, but that's his decision and under no circumstance would I make a fuss about something that petty.

I've got some news for you, Dartmouth does not have some magic anti-gun barrier around it preventing guns from being brought on campus.  What do you think happens when you go to West Lebanon to shop?  Not to keep ranting but more on your point, I was at the deli in Hannaford's in West Leb and some guy was open carrying and some woman kept trying to get everybody to panic over it by saying loudly ""IS THAT A GUN!?"" and ""WHY IS HE ALLOWED TO HAVE A GUN?!?!""

My north end one bedroom is about to be vacated - I know they're going to renovate it after I leave - so you may want to drop by peloquin property mgmt and ask what they have available now or coming up."

Government services have far smaller administrative costs, don't have to pay out huge sums of money to share holders, and their only legal obligation is to provide X service to the people, with corporations their only legal obligation is to generate profit at all costs. For example, for every dollar spent on Medicaid, only 2 cents goes into overhead. The rest is allocated to do its job. For every dollar that goes into private insurance, between 25 and 30 cents goes into overhead costs.

Restaurants are also not in the position to provide or deny people life saving medical care. Where health insurance companies are, and do so every day.

newhampshire,2o4o5b,ANewMachine615,6,Wed Dec 3 12:48:12 2014 UTC,"Sorry, meant to include it's description in the post. Basically it's a group of people who want a government that does not regulate much, primarily libertarians and anarchists, that are planning to move to new hampshire since it's one of the ""most free"" states (some of them wish to go to enjoy the state as is, others want to get involved with the political landscape). That's the simplest explanation I can think of, but hopefully someone will comment with more info. Additionally, they are trying to get 20,000 people to sign a statement agreeing to move, and once they do, someone will send out an email ""triggering"" the move, although some have already moved."
newhampshire,2o4o5b,ANewMachine615,2,Thu Dec 4 02:05:25 2014 UTC,"The original agreement was to move when a critical mass had agreed to move. So, a sort of mass migration. Lots of folks started moving early after the FSP talked up how ""liberty-friendly"" the state is."

Theoretically this might boost people's actual resale value on their homes closer to what they originally paid.  We're suffering from an upside-down real estate market in many areas of the state right now because of the economy/housing bubble burst.  I know at least a dozen locals who want to move but can't because they wouldn't be able to sell for anywhere near what they bought for in the middle of the housing bubble and are basically upside down on their mortgages.    If y'all actually pull this off, a decent contingent of you should consider moving to Claremont.  The real estate prices in this area are pretty good.  The town has a serious issue with welfare abuse and could use at least a few hundred more people who are willing to speak out against and do something about it and/or volunteer in initiatives which seek to make said folks more financially savvy and self-sufficient.  Though I don't have any desire to totally remove the welfare system because I legit know plenty of people who need it through no fault of their own and benefit justly from it.  I'd love to see the system refined in such a way that there aren't a whole mess of irresponsible shit-heads abusing it.  I've seen soooooo much of that crap going on around here and it pisses me off that I have to work my ass off to barely make ends meet and live in borderline poverty while others around here can just keep doing drugs, popping out children they can't afford to support and make a tidy living off the state checks from child benefits while having most of their living expenses paid for from my taxes, and in effect training their kids to be the same way.  Yet I can't even get a little break on my medical expenses because I'm a single male with no kids who works full-time and they say I make too much for assistance despite that I live frugally, have lower material expenses than most in my age and position and am still barely holding my head above water."

If it weren't, they'd not be taking advantage of fragile democratic systems like town meetings and our hyper-representative legislature to push their minority and fringe ideological policies, reality be damned. They want to prove that ""liberty"" is the best thing ever, and given that they have no real-world examples of people operating by their unrealistic principles, they needed a state with an easily-commandeered governmental system in which to create such an example. By hook or by crook.  The really sad part is what'll happen in ten or fifteen years if they do move here.

Mass residents might move here for the lower taxes, but they don't say ""Ah, but once I am there I can easily win a seat in the state house!"" FSPers do.

Don't you get it?   So how does one then get ""private"" property? This is something I've never understood about the whole stateless fiasco. In order to have private property, you need respected contracts. In order to have contracts on anything bigger than a tribal scale, you need a body that will mediate discussion of contracts so that they don't benefit only one side and become useless. So in order to live without a government, you need a government.  You all just want the government that benefits you instead of the other guy.   Libertarians are all for charging fees for service, but get upset when a public service charges fees for its use. But somehow, me having a gun on my hip and telling you that you need to pay up or else is ""non-violent"", and the state sending a bill to your house is ""statist theft"". It's all so crazy and self-contradictory that I have no idea how you think you're going to rope everyone else in on it.   Then again, that presupposes that a majority of libertarians care about much other than screaming about freedom and frightening meter maids with the unspoken threat of a gun."
newhampshire,2o4o5b,axisofelvis,11,Fri Dec 5 16:11:19 2014 UTC,"Again, these systems all seem to require some manner of governing body, or a system of bureaucracy so intricate that they become a defacto government. In the polycentric law example, how does one legitimize contracts between the COLAs? How does one deal with a transgression against one COLA by someone who doesn't agree to their terms? You would end up with a super-COLA eventually who would arbitrate between the largest communities, helping them to arrange for agreements that met their best interests. Law would, like it has, become more standardized, and probably, like businesses, one would come out on top, become the monopolizer (say, WorldGov), and bam, government again. If you opted out of WorldGov, you would miss out on services, like now, probably pay non-citizen fees for WorldGov services, call them fines, and then you'd be in the same position poor people are now, stealing and breaking the law to live, or part of a social security program and living of the largess of others.   I don't have extra time or cash to read the wiki linked book, sorry, but I do think that the problem has been brought up again that Harm-free moral systems collapse under the computation of harm, and result in a gray, dreary existence, where everyone is alloted joy points. Again, it fails to address why giving up one moral illusion (government) for another (anarchistic capitalism) is so good. It seems that ultimately, both will need to provide ways for large numbers of people to have a common law and expectations of one another, will likely be run by people with a great deal of social and physical capital, and will probably screw the poorest of the poor as hard as they can without splitting them open.   For the videos, I'm deaf, can't watch them. That's another issue I take with the ancap view. I can get along fairly well day to day, but if I want to talk to a professional, a doctor, lawyer, accountant, I either need a couple notebooks and an extra three hours, or an interpreter. I could never pay an interpreter what they are paid now, and they can't afford to work for what I can afford to pay. So in the libertarian wonder-world, do I have to wait for a Deaf person to become rich enough to subsidize interpreters? Do interpreters have to work for less than they are worth because the mysterious market says I'm worthless? Do I get to eat shit and die? It seems that the libertarian form of government works great for rich, tech-savvy ""normal"" people, and not so great for the rest of us.   You say it will be done by market magic and by volunteers, but as far as I'm aware, volunteers flake out on FSP gatherings all the time, they are marked by vandalism, theft, and other small crimes that I certainly wouldn't accept as part of my day-to-day life. But somehow I'm supposed to believe that giving up a highly-trained NH police force full of lots of folks who grew up in their communities and want to do the right thing, is worse than getting rid of them and trusting a bunch of people who can barely agree on a mission statement, and can't even police the members of their voluntary movement, unless I missed a lot of libertarians coming down hard on Free Keene for their rude and harassing actions.   Sorry, but since I'm not rich and hearing, and with an IT degree, I don't really see how it works for me."

They, in response, created social pressure on you to conform to the communities established desire - to drive on the correct side of their road. Rather than go to state government, file a petition to create a new law, then use police resources to enforce said law and costing the tax payer money to do that while process, they got their point and desire across. You, wanting your own measure of liberty, decided their way was not for you and left, finding your own libertarian utopia."

Pat's Peak is closest to Manchester though. I just prefer Crotched cause it's generally quieter and more laid back. These two places in particular are great for spontaneous trips from Manchester which is why I suggest them over other places that are bigger and further away. Both also have night skiing and on weekends Crotched is open until around 4am.  Ice skating is tons of fun and there are plenty of nearby town that have rinks set up when it gets cold enough. You can usually find really cheap skates at local ski swaps.

Drink beer and enjoy watching people tear ass down the headwall (in terms of speed and/or injury).  On the right day it has a wonderful atmosphere.  If you're a good skiier / snowboarder, talk to someone who's experienced with mountaineering or get a guide and do it yourself. It's a rush.  Though I recommend doing it well before the spring thaw on a day with a low avalanche risk (I won't even get into the gear you need here). Do not do it without the proper experience / guidance.   Apart from Tucks there are plenty of good off-the-beaten-path hike&ski spots in the state.

My point is that I don't believe this idea that no matter what anyone does, Democratic governors are the real problem (which I believe was the central thesis of the comment you linked to).

You're allowed to cut large (8"" at chest height) trees, so if you like big trees it might be cost effective.  http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/whitemountain/passes-permits/forestproducts/?cid=stelprdb5277575"

I think because it is the biggest city in NH people look to it for superlatives and may be disappointing, for different reasons. Those that like rural life don't like it because, ewww big city and those that want big city environment and look to places like Boston or NYC, think ""what a dingy little town with nothing going on"".  You are right though, it is a lot like Worcester. Certainly there are things that you can criticize it for. I don't know if you have kids or are planning to but the school situation in Manchester is a bit dicey now. A lot of the surrounding towns that had been sending there kids in to Manchester have build there own schools over the last few years and the school funding in Manchester has been a political football. The schools are still good but... if you are being picky other nearby towns are better."

newhampshire,2nvh8t,kitchinsink,2,Fri Dec 5 15:06:07 2014 UTC,"1) everyone will tell you Verizon, buy AT&T is honestly just as good. I've been with them almost 2 years now and I find I have service everywhere my Verizon friends have it, and sometimes places where they don't.   2) I'm with fair point. Not going to recommend them on account of the strike and their service had slipped the last few months. I've heard Verizon is good?  3) I found my place on craigslist. If you have time to check places out its not a bad way to go, rent is quite expensive for what you get here (again, my opinion).  4) I like Concord, lots of small café places and what not. I prefer Portsmouth though, very nice town.   5) again, I spend most of my time in Manchester in elm street, lots of restaurants and bars that I like there. Also a few decent places on main street in Nashua, but I wouldn't recommend venturing too far off main.  Nh is a great place and I wouldn't want to live anywhere else in the north east, best of luck to you!"
newhampshire,2nvh8t,chiclet81,3,Mon Dec 1 23:35:07 2014 UTC,"I have zero problems with AT&T. Folks also have good luck with Verizon.  DO NOT go TMobile or Sprint.

The big box stuff is all at one end of town,  away from downtown,  which is adorable. We have an indie cinema,  great few restaurants,  nice Main St for walking.  Way better than Manchester if you have kids or like a safe,  quiter place to call home.  I don't know of nice places in Manchester unless you're a millionaire.

newhampshire,2nvh8t,chiclet81,1 point,Sun Nov 30 21:58:54 2014 UTC,"You don't have to be a millionaire to live in the nicer parts of manchester. Most of the homes in the north end and near the Bedford line (the ""nice"" areas) max out in the 400k range, which compared to most other states in the northeast is cheap money for what you get. If OP is coming from the south he'll be in for a rude awakening cost-wise but otherwise should be fine. Bedford housing prices essentially start in the 400k range and move up from there."

newhampshire,2nvh8t,minkastu,1 point,Mon Dec 1 14:29:00 2014 UTC,"Totally valid. Houses are really easy ways to get in over your head. OP did say he's looking to rent a house, however, and the rental market for stand-alone homes has far less variation in price in this are than purchase prices for those same homes, from what I've seen at least. I'm pretty confident there are a bajillion townhomes in a 30-minute radius of Derry as well, that may save OP some money too if he's open to it."
newhampshire,2nvh8t,Pault66,1 point,Mon Dec 1 15:43:21 2014 UTC,"Our plan is to rent for the first year or two while we save up for a down payment and they look to purchase.

newhampshire,2nvh8t,concordmonitor,1 point,Tue Dec 2 12:51:51 2014 UTC,"It may give you a little leverage to negotiate though... generally people don't like moving in the winter, so if the landlord has the option to rent it for a little less monthly, but actually have a tenant rather than a vacant rental for several more months, they might consider giving you a deal. It's worth a shot. Also, when i rented in the past i got a discount for doing my own lawn maintenance and snow removal. I saved $100.00 a month for like 30 minute's work."

Verizon has dead zones that are far between, other providers have live zones that are far between. 2) We had Fairpoint for a while but last year we experienced an outage and switched to Comcast. As bad as Comcast's customer service is, Fairpoint's is worse (in our experience). 3) Can't say, haven't looked. 4) Concord is awesome. It has a thriving downtown with great cafés and dining, Red River Theatre, the Capitol Center for the Arts, and a bunch of local shops (the retail downtown does leave something to be desired). If you need Big Box/chain stuff, you can venture down Loudon Stroad. There are festivals downtown all the time great for all ages. 5) I here the farthest northeast extremes of Manchester are nice out by Wellington Road and Derryfield Park."

I just used him in the last 6 months to buy a house in Concord which brings me to.....  I just moved to Concord and I love it so far.  I'm up off exit 15 in close proximity to the downtown area.  It's a great city. There is a nice downtown with some good restaurants and unique shops. On the other side of the river you have you have the more mundane strip mall section.  Concord is by far the best city to live in between the big 3, Manchseter, Concord, and Nashua.  I wouldn't rule out Manchester. If you come from a city of any size you'll most likely be used to far worse then what Manchester has to offer.  There is definitely places I wouldn't want my family to live but not all is bad.  East side and North End aren't bad at all.  If you're more rural folk There are great towns surrounding Derry with good school systems.  Windham, Chester, Auburn, are all great towns to live in."
newhampshire,2nvh8t,chiclet81,0,Mon Dec 1 18:24:06 2014 UTC,"Get Verizon. I've had AT&T for close to 8 years in NH and just came to accept the outage zones. Verizon is the way to go in NH. If you're able, get Metrocast. They are a local service provider, and for $50.95 a month I get high speed cable through them, steady 7mps DL, 2mps upload. I've never received a warning letter about the content or volume of my downloading habits, enough said. I love searching though NNEREN for available homes. I believe NH is still pretty lax about home inspector certifications so if you find something that's a potential have a certified inspector from MA go through the home. Concord is still a pretty dead New England town stuck trying to revitalize its Main Street. Nightlife for an adult is very lacking, other than a handful of restaurants. Shopping is either generic or costly, not necessarily unique, but Red River Cinema and the Center for the Arts are pretty reliable draws. Manchester has plenty to offer, I'm just not sure about what the have yet.   Good luck, and welcome to the greatest state in the union!"

newhampshire,2nnuvl,JustGimmeSomeTruth,21,Fri Nov 28 12:20:16 2014 UTC,Sadly it would cost far more to bury the lines than any loss from outages.
newhampshire,2nnuvl,Liar_tuck,7,Fri Nov 28 12:31:47 2014 UTC,Yep. This is because of our established infrastructure (imagine road crews tearing up the side of basically every road in the state) and the really rocky soil around here.
newhampshire,2nnuvl,ANewMachine615,2,Fri Nov 28 12:36:09 2014 UTC,Also the high voltage wires either need to be heavily insulated or far apart from one another (same thing really) and you wouldn't want frost heaves involved so you have to bury them a ways down.   It'd probably be cheaper for PSNH to just buy every household a generator.
newhampshire,2nnuvl,jdkeith,-8,Sun Nov 30 11:57:09 2014 UTC,"It seems like they already are doing this anyway... Or maybe it's just my specific commute routes that they are always working on haha.     But seriously, what about slowly implementing this to coincide with road work that is already being done?  On that topic, my history teacher in high school did a lesson on how the Romans built roads that are still usable today because they intentionally built them to last forever, meanwhile our roads are built to intentionally wear out... His theory was, in order to employ construction workers."
newhampshire,2nnuvl,nill0c,15,Fri Nov 28 12:50:19 2014 UTC,"Our roads are built to handle 65-85 mph 80,000 lbs vehicles.   So they need to be smoother and flatter than the Roman roads were, which requires a different set of properties. Also cost still plays a big part—would you like a few miles of smooth granite slabs, or the 100s of miles of interstate that stretch across the state (not to mention the country) that the same money can buy. If you haven't noticed, this country has had a hard time agreeing to invest in projects that last much longer than the next election cycle, but roads and bridges are expected to somehow last ""forever"".

C'mon now, if you think I'm wrong here then explain to me why.    neighbor rams a trencher through the line   Right, I get that it would cost more to have to dig up the line whenever there is a problem, but the whole point of burying the lines is that they would be far less likely to have any problems.    Obviously accidents would happen but there is a problem with your example-- you can't honestly believe incidents of people digging without checking first would come anywhere close to the number of weather related incidents that happen all the time with the lines above ground.  Plus, those kind of accidents already happen, with people crashing into poles etc. That kind of tiny risk exists above or below ground.  And how much maintenance is actually needed with lines sealed underground?  Has to be far more needed with being exposed to the elements.  Personally, I'd be happy to risk being affected by the once in a blue moon freak accident, vs having my power go out every year whenever there is a storm."

newhampshire,2nnuvl,nullcompany,4,Fri Nov 28 13:39:51 2014 UTC,"Initially, of course it would. How many years, though, until it pays for itself? Power outages cost our state millions of dollars. Preventing them would save that money. A long term cost-benefit analysis could warrant the initial investment. On what do you base the notion that it is inherently cost prohibitive?"
newhampshire,2nnuvl,beanx,4,Fri Nov 28 13:18:00 2014 UTC,It would cost billions to bury all the power lines in NH. The millions lost by outages are a drop in the bucket compared to the cost of fixing the problem.
newhampshire,2nnuvl,UnthinkingMajority,-1,Fri Nov 28 14:02:16 2014 UTC,"Again, initially. If we buried the lines little by little (each time we dig up a road or replace lines, for instance), the cost would be partially mitigated by the cost associated with that regular maintenance. Burying the lines is the future, and as we create more and more technology jobs in our state, the cost of outages will only go up."

Even if we had ten storms like this every year (instead of one or two) it would be a century before it was worth it (using these numbers). A century ago planes were a curiosity, electricity was scarce, and WWI had just started. I wouldn't be making infrastructure bets along those timescales."

I've had a similar conversation in past with a civil engineer and his take on it was the cost of burying lines in this part of the country is extra prohibitive do to the need to bury deep enough to get past the frost line, if more shallow they would break over time too and end up costing more than above ground lines.  I'm in Manchester in a section where the lines are buried and I lost power for 2 days anyway... of course the trouble might have been on an above ground line on the way here."
newhampshire,2nnuvl,DietCokeMachine,1 point,Fri Nov 28 22:07:00 2014 UTC,We can barely keep up with road maintenance. You think we can realistically add upgrading our power infrastructure to that? The funds are simply not there to do it.

newhampshire,2nnuvl,SkyBlueLogan,5,Fri Nov 28 14:05:55 2014 UTC,Why most cities don’t bury power lines
newhampshire,2nnuvl,SheeEttin,9,Fri Nov 28 15:45:27 2014 UTC,"Great example of why it isn't practical.    ...it would cost $5.8 billion, adding $226 to customers' monthly electricity bills for the next 10 years.   While that is for the DC area, I think assuming that the costs per-customer would be similar, if not more, in NH.  I can just imagine the nightmare of burying the lines.  Not only do you have to put trenches along every road, but you then have to deal with crossing all the residents driveways, and THEN trenching up to each and every house.  You'd also have to cross the road at each house that wasn't on the same side as the power lines.  Don't forget, if you put the power underground, you'll need to do the other utilities, as well.  This would include the local cable provider, the telco providers, municipality's telecom infrastructure, AND also any local LEC's that is leasing the pole space.  I believe that a much more cost effective plan would be to MUCH more aggressively trim back trees that are near the utility lines - as illustrated above, it is not just power.  If trees were removed completely within 20-30 feet of the power lines, the number of outages would drastically be reduced.  However, this comes a huge aesthetic cost.  A lot of home owners would be outraged as the drastic ""clear-cutting"" under and around those lines.  I found this interesting article - http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/diorama-series/landscape-history-central-new-england - it shows that New England seems to be a regrowth period.  As trees grown back, they encroach on those power lines.  I think it is all a matter of trade-offs.  Assuming that the study is correct, and it would rase my bill over $200 a month - knowing that PSNH (Unitil, NH Electric Co-op, etc) aren't going to eat these costs - personally, I would rather just spend a fraction of that on a nice generator."

This would include the local cable provider, the telco providers, municipality's telecom infrastructure, AND also any local LEC's that is leasing the pole space.   It typically doesn't work that way at all.  When power lines are buried retroactively, the last leg very often stays strung. What's important is that the distribution lines are buried, so that when one goes down it's not affecting thousands or tens of thousands or more of people all at once. Burying lines in individual neighborhoods and cities/towns isn't as big of a deal, and especially not burying them from the curb."
newhampshire,2nnuvl,smavonco,0,Fri Nov 28 15:41:16 2014 UTC,"Well maybe it wouldn't necessarily have to be offset by upping customers' monthly bills...

newhampshire,2nnuvl,corey1031d,4,Fri Nov 28 20:08:13 2014 UTC,"The internet white knights defending PSNH are cracking me up.  First and foremost, I don't think many people are upset with the hard working individuals who are out working the lines or in the office, especially over the holiday.  To those folks, my hat's off and my family and I thank you deeply.  It seems perfectly reasonable to me to question how PSNH is being managed at the top, along with the poor generic communication that's fed to the community every time these outages occur which seems entirely focused on covering the company's ass.  I think it's pretty clear there are issues with an antiquated infrastructure that isn't getting enough resources/maintenance put into it by PSNH, as well as cooperation from state and local government.  I'm not going to pretend to know if burying the lines is the right approach from an engineering or financial standpoint, but a critical look at how to properly maintain the infrastructure and harden it against outages of this scale needs to be done sooner than later.  The fact that we get a lot of snow is not an excuse to not do this, it's just a challenge that needs to be taken into account when coming up with a solution.  I'm certain there are some bright engineers out there that are more than willing to tackle the problem.  Unfortunately profit margins and politics typically drive whether or not assessments like this are done, and more importantly, whether follow through on those assessments actually happens."

newhampshire,2nnuvl,nullcompany,3,Fri Nov 28 22:24:45 2014 UTC,PSNH didn't keep trees trimmed?  Wasn't this the reason we all lost power a few years ago in the last ice storm?
newhampshire,2nnuvl,pattheaux,2,Fri Nov 28 21:06:23 2014 UTC,When I moved into my house 14 years ago. I called PSNH and asked them to trim my Tree in my property near their lines.  The said they would and warned me they tend to over trim and sometimes it's not so pretty.  I was fine with it and they actually did a very professional job.  All I had to do was dispose of the waste.   Several years later I called them and asked for the same service. I was informed they don't do this any more and I have to hire a contractor.  I haven't gotten around to it.   I bet you could track an increase in power outages to the institution of this short sighted policy.
newhampshire,2nnuvl,Lord_Dog_Balls,3,Fri Nov 28 21:11:22 2014 UTC,"To underground all distribution, subtransmission, and transmission lines is cost prohibitive.  Regarding distribution lines as most people here are familiar with them, underground existing lines is expensive and there are many factors to consider.  From tearing up roads, acquiring easements to run ug lines through properties, ug service lines from transformers to individual customer meters requires a deep investment by everyone, and no one wants to make that sacrifice.  Those that do say so, but when a bill goes up 200-300 per month in an area that already is some of the highest rates in the country is in no ones best interest.  Unless Northeast Utilities (PSNH) pockets some $$$  You can start to ug certain feeders a few sections at a time, or UG the mainline and keep lateral taps OH and that could assist, but also requires a significant investment.  Why stop at lateral taps?  While UG cable can last 30, 40, 50 years when they do fault, depending on how the UG cable is laid out you can have extended outages.  If the cables are laid out radially then everyone is out while the cable is located and the fault repaired.  If the cable is laid out in an open loop configuration then you can sectionalize that section of cable to keep customers on, then come back to make repairs.  However in my experience only smaller utilities will come back to make repairs.  Tree trimming does work, however trimming occurs within the utility easement.  Often if more tree trimming occurs there is a NIMBY mentality which then prevents necessary tree trimming from occurring.  Utilities can install polymetric insulators get rid of ancient ceramic ones which are prone to cracking and tracking.    Other factors to consider are many substations may not have any telemetry so the company is unaware of an outage until it is reported.  People  talk about a smart grid, but it is amazing how old an antiquated our system is.    There are areas that are UG new areas, some places were very proactive and stipulated that after a certain date all utilities are to be buried UG.  Others are slowly reinvesting back into their systems.  However the northeast is the oldest electric system, and have not been proactive to change until it is too late.    I know for a fact some equipment is still running strong and was manufactured here in the US in the early 1900's late 1800's.  That is a testament to how great our manufacturing once was but not to how progressive the new energy paradigm is supposed to be.  There are even substation ckt breakers used that contain wooden rods.  This may have been cutting edge at the turn of last century.

If you had a break in the line somewhere you'd be forced to dig up the entire field to find the outage, which could take weeks.  Now imagine this happening during the height of the football season and see how people feel about your buried lines then!"
newhampshire,2nnuvl,sndtech,3,Fri Nov 28 21:48:51 2014 UTC,"This seems absurd.  Why don't those concerns affect gas, water, and sewer lines?"
newhampshire,2nnuvl,PowPowPowerCrystal,2,Sat Nov 29 15:29:15 2014 UTC,"I think they can use tools to determine exactly where the break is (timing by bouncing a signal along the wire or smthg...). But yeah, just like gas lines they are probably going to replace the whole segment..."
newhampshire,2nnuvl,nullcompany,4,Fri Nov 28 13:38:23 2014 UTC,"How does a 'break' happen in the buried lines? I don't think your friend thought this through. The lines would get broken if someone dug without calling digsafe, but how else could this happen?"
newhampshire,2nnuvl,sndtech,6,Fri Nov 28 19:32:19 2014 UTC,"We do get some tectonic activity. You'd also have to bury them very deep to avoid frost heave interactions causing breaks, which may not be readily possible in some places depending on the depth of the soil before you hit granite."
newhampshire,2nnuvl,PowPowPowerCrystal,-1,Fri Nov 28 22:47:18 2014 UTC,"Exactly. It seems like, outside of freak accidents, the lines would be far far safer overall underground."
newhampshire,2nnuvl,Politikr,0,Fri Nov 28 14:02:59 2014 UTC,"Yeah I definitely see the logic there...  But then why is burying lines even a thing? Don't they do this in parts of Europe?  If it's truly that impractical, then why is anyone using it anywhere?"
newhampshire,2nnuvl,skankersores,4,Fri Nov 28 15:05:29 2014 UTC,"Most often in places with other underground utilities, like sewer and water, thus can be run parallel and accessed."
newhampshire,2nnuvl,secreted_uranus,3,Fri Nov 28 14:22:05 2014 UTC,I agree completely. Anytime a road is dug up for maintenance they should be laying down the groundwork.
newhampshire,2nnuvl,g3wd,2,Fri Nov 28 14:03:12 2014 UTC,"Ok. It's not practical to bury existing Lines. But any new construction needs to be done that way.    As I sit here in my house in Nashua without power for the third day consider my anecdotal data.   I grew up in a NYC suburb with all of our utilities buried.  And in the 21 years I lived there there was exactly ONE power outage.  And that happened to black out the entire city.    It looked really nice not having unsightly powerlines strung down every street.   Rarely was there ever any road construction to service the lines.   Access that was needed was almost always made through manholes.    Where I live now, we have underground gas, water, and sewer.   Why didn't they put electric down there too? It's just seems so stupid.   What was the calculation that had them say,  ""Oh we don't want to put the lines underground while the water and gas and sewer lines are being installed.   We want to erect poles and string wires in the air in addition?""   Unless I can get some piece of information that explains otherwise I continue to believe it's just inconceivably mind numbingly stupid."

A little more background:  I was jealous when my buddy told me he got to wake up early and leave his family on Thanksgiving morning because his boss, who is on vacation in Florida this week, gave him the privilege of going to work today.  He was overcome at this generous display.

Ended up moving about 20 people into my house for dinner yesterday because the power/generator situation ruined the regular plans. Pellet stove running, a ton of food, and homemade booze so all in all it was a pretty good day.  The PSNH facebook is insane, sooo many angry people. The throwing out food comments are really weird.

Our little ones flipped out at first, but once we got a few oil lamps lit and some battery powered lights on they thought we were camping and wanted stories.  Around 8pm I decided that it looked like we were in it for awhile and went out to the shed and got the portable genny going. We've got enough fuel on hand to run it for a few days. It's wired into the main panel so I can turn on whatever we need as it's needed. The kitchen is up and running and Thanksgiving feast is in production now. Wood & pellet drives have the house at a toasty 78°.   The only thing different than a usual day is the buzz of the generator, and no TV or video games on.   Happy Thanksgiving everyone!"

I'd like to see the split between landline and cell interviews.  Lets look at the graphs - first, R$ is getting special attention in his own question that lacks him. Clinton has three questions about who could run against her. Next, the not sure / none of the above / different candidate totals in 2, 3, and 4 are pretty telling. It shows that, as polled, the GOP is mostly divided/confused or ready for R$, while the democrats are going overwhelmingly Clinton. I'm seeing a lot of Warren support in my area of southern NH. Probably a Rep / R$ funded poll to scare old folks into thinking Clinton is going to be the Dem ticket."

newhampshire,2n62hc,SceebyDeeby,3,Sun Nov 23 14:46:32 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately, New Hampshire needs this natural gas pipeline to help alleviate shortages during the winter when domestic use spikes. There is a reason why all the electrical generation rates have jumped up 40% leading into winter. Last year during the coldest days the cost per kwh jumped 1000% due to shortages of natural gas. Natural gas plants like hydro can react quickly to changes in demand, whereas nuclear and coal have much more ""inertia"" and take hours/days to start-up, hence they provide the base power. Until we see better storage methods paired with renewables or traditional base power plants we are stuck with natural gas."
newhampshire,2n62hc,TheDwarf,7,Sun Nov 23 17:19:41 2014 UTC,"Fracking, need for pipelines, methane emissions and the potential for explosion make it kind of a bad alternative, though. Not to mention that, outside the high-population seacoast area, not much benefit comes to the state from this: a few very temporary jobs, some gas distribution in high-density areas, in return for disturbance of New Hampshire's best asset: its natural beauty. Feels like another Northern Pass, we get a few bucks in return for a long-term eyesore."
newhampshire,2n62hc,SceebyDeeby,3,Mon Nov 24 01:22:43 2014 UTC,"It sounded like from the article that the project is going to be using existing right of ways to route the pipeline, so I can't imagine it spoiling the environment more than the 40ft towers that already populate those RoWs. We are stuck in a pickle here and no one wants the infrastructure required to meet our energy demand in their backyard, whether it be wind farms, pipelines, transmission lines or nuclear power plants. Vermont Yankee will be closing this year and I believe PSNH wants rid of Merrimack Station, combined they produce nearly 1GWe of base power that is going to be tough to replace. Renewables like wind and solar would nice, but consumers don't want to cough up the cash to pay for them."
newhampshire,2n62hc,TheDwarf,2,Mon Nov 24 03:42:17 2014 UTC,"We already are coughing up the cash. Where so you think 2.8 billion to build the pipeline is coming from?  This is about profits first. We can keep paying the companies to get better at delivering gas, or start making longer term investments away from finite resources that are hurting our planet."
newhampshire,2n62hc,nill0c,9,Fri Nov 28 14:54:24 2014 UTC,"Yes. The reason is they want to build support for a pipeline. Make everyone hurt a little, present the pipeline as the solution and then boom, pipeline is built but strangely, prices don't change. Call me a conspiracy theorist all you want, but the tactic certainly isn't without precedent."
newhampshire,2n62hc,beaherobeaman,3,Sun Nov 23 23:20:13 2014 UTC,"The facts are pretty clear, during winter months commercial demand is compounded by high residential demand for natural gas. During a period last January, ISO NE had 75% of it's natural gas fired power plants offline due to price spikes caused by extremely cold weather. At the same time, companies like Gorham paper that depend on natural gas for boilers also had to shut down the plant temporally and lay off its workforce because it wasn't cost-effective to run the plant. And you're right, prices likely want change for 95% of the year but if I understand correctly this pipeline is being built for the 5% of the year when New Hampshire doesn't have sufficient capacity to meet demand."
newhampshire,2n62hc,TheDwarf,3,Mon Nov 24 03:23:45 2014 UTC,"this pipeline is being built for the 5% of the year when New Hampshire doesn't have sufficient capacity to meet demand.     Correct, and that remainder is for export.  This isn't about fuel for the area, this is about export and Kinder Morgan profiting off it.  Period.  The ""shortage"" is largely a manufactured excuse."
newhampshire,2n62hc,NHGuy,1 point,Mon Nov 24 19:24:21 2014 UTC,"No, its not.  We don't export natural gas due to a WWII era law.  We do have a massive natural gas shortage in New England, and everything /u/TheDwarf said is correct.  I work for a construction company in the energy secter.  Power plants get shafted during the winter because their variable draw puts them on the ""second tier"" list for pipleline operators.  Customers with more constant loads are first teir (like your local gas company).  This pipline is not a big deal at all.  Gas piplines are everywhere....this is just another one."

There's about 3 billion going into gas infrascture in New England....and most of it is extremely low-impact, like this pipeline.  Pipelines are everywhere....and the fact that no one knows how many big pipelines are in Southern NH is precisely why this isn't a big deal....they don't bother anyone."

newhampshire,2n5wo2,darthjoe229,5,Sat Nov 29 00:08:23 2014 UTC,"Just to distinguish there is a difference between which fwd cars you are talking about. A sub compact like a miata is different than a full sized sedan such as fusion. Weight, distance between tire and frame of car, distance car is from ground, and distance between outer rim of car and where the calipers are play a role.  I firmly believe in awd cars though. Fuel efficiency is on average lower, but it's well worth it especially in larger vehicles. Especially if you're snowed in. I've pulled out of spots where the snow was above the bottom of my car with zero shoveling. Something like a mid sized subaru legacy or awd Ford fusion (which is hard to find now a days) is probably your best fuel efficient and controlling car. Maybe even investigate an awd cross over. Actually screw it, just buy the new self driving awd Tesla. 300k nbd. But on a more serious note, knowing the car and how to drive in the snow trumps all."
newhampshire,2n5wo2,KryptaKray,8,Sun Nov 23 14:19:48 2014 UTC,Not to mention you know... miatas are rwd...

It was fwd but very similar to a miata. That car was so small and low to the ground I'd get stuck in two inches. Where the awd impreza moves in ten inches no problem
newhampshire,2n5wo2,KryptaKray,1 point,Sun Nov 23 23:47:25 2014 UTC,"Definitely this, have driven front wheel drive almost 20 years in Southern NH, and have lost track of the number of SUVs and pickups with a 4x4 I've seen blow themselves off the road because they thought AWD made them invincible in the snow. Take it slow, deliberately skid out a few times in an empty parking lot to get a feel for it, and basically forget you have a brake pedal for most snowstorms. That's the big killer, people freak out in a skid, slam on the brakes, and lose whatever traction they had."
newhampshire,2n5wo2,SceebyDeeby,3,Sun Nov 23 14:51:23 2014 UTC,"Most pick ups and a good portion of suv's are actually 4wd and not awd. They are not the same. 4wd can be switched on, and distributes power to all four wheels evenly and is designed to achieve maximum torque. These things make it very bad to use on dry pavement or turns. The wheels move different distances during turns, applying significant stress on the cars chassis. Awd is always on, and uses a computer now a days to change power distribution to the wheels based on traction and vehicle movement. Turning increases power to front wheels, where a patch of ice on one tire removes power from that wheel and gives to others. Awd is not just for snow. It's on super cars too. New Tesla, r8, etc. Both lower fuel efficiency but on my opinion is ingenuity at its finest"
newhampshire,2n5wo2,KryptaKray,0,Sun Nov 23 15:39:02 2014 UTC,"Source? I've checked countless sites, forums, and not to mention new England mechanics and all support my claim. I'm not saying one turn will break your truck, but it is excessive wear that should be avoided. The only exception I found is the wrangler (2 door)  because the front and back turning radius is very close. If four wheels are powered evenly and take a turn, the front two travel a lesser distance than the back two. This causes your front wheels to apply force in the direction of the turn, and the rear wheels continue to apply force in the forward direction. That is essentially trying to tear apart your chassis. Snow and slippery conditions kick in limited slip differentials on your back wheels, which in turn correct for this and actually help adjust your back tires relative to your front. If you do simple force vectors of the vehicle, it all makes sense."
newhampshire,2n5wo2,KryptaKray,7,Thu Dec 4 18:03:01 2014 UTC,"It really depends. If you live near downtown concord and use the interstate or main roads, FWD ( with snow tires, of course!!) is just fine. The roads get cleaned very well so it's not a huge deal. However, if you have you head out of town using back roads they don't get cleaned as quickly and awd can be helpful.  I will say, have you lived in a snowy area before? Having knowledge and experience about how your particular vehicle handles in the snow can be better than the vehicle itself.   SOURCE: I lived in concord for years and commute through NH and see plenty of 4wd vehicles in ditches BC people think they are impervious to ice."
newhampshire,2n5wo2,TehSeraphim,2,Sun Dec 7 06:00:58 2014 UTC,Yep. More 4wd Drives in the ditches than you can count after a bad storm. Folks think it makes them invincible and get 4wheel stuck instead.   Driving carefully and taking it easy is worth way more than the vehicle.

newhampshire,2n5wo2,floppybutton,1 point,Sun Nov 23 16:38:20 2014 UTC,"I guess if you live in a small town the plowing will be done by the state. Over in Keene they normally salt the roads before the storm, maybe plow once during if the storm is bad, then they finish after the storm is done. They mostly have the roads cleared for the commute times. And since it mostly always snows at night and ends early in the morning, you won't see plows very often."

The only time I ever crashed in the snow was when I was a teenager and tried to answer the question, ""what happens if I engage the parking brake while I'm driving?"" Answer: don't do that ever again.  Front wheel drive is fine. Take it easy and learn to recognize icy conditions and how to handle the car. I also recommend buying good snow tires.

Otherwise, you'd be fine with either."
newhampshire,2n5wo2,ullrsdream,2,Sun Nov 23 14:46:51 2014 UTC,"The relevant question is: do you have a job for which its mission critical you drive through unplowed streets?  The average person doesn't find themselves in emergency situations like a snow storm where they need to drive but buy AWD because they have this notion they need AWD. Then, they go buy a WRX or some other car with pathetically low ground clearance because it's got AWD.   If you're living in a city or town in NE which doesn't regularly have you navigating serious terrain (and I don't mean the potholes on 93) and you're not one of these people who need to drive all around Hell's Half Acre when you've been asked to stay home (out of dangerous conditions and away from the work of road clearing crews) then you'll do just fine with FWD and a good set of winter tires."

newhampshire,2n5wo2,tfmeh,1 point,Mon Nov 24 14:38:08 2014 UTC,"Depends on the vehicle.  I drive an '07 Forester (AWD) and it is very capable in the snow, even with sketchy tires.  Hell, a couple of years ago I used it to tow out some guys in a huge F-350 more than twice the size of the Forester, which had ended up in a ditch in the middle of an ice storm.  I also drove a Ford Focus (2WD front) a couple of vehicles before that and, despite it's faults, of which there were many, lack of longevity being a major one... with good snow tires on, it handled about as well as the Forester.  I also drove a Subaru Impreza which was probably the most capable in the snow and was fun to drive because it had some balls and handled like a go-kart.  I miss that car.   All that said, I'm on my second Subaru and I recommend them.  They are pretty reliable and need less maintenance and repairs from what I've seen, though when they do need repairs they tend to be 30%-60% more expensive than the same type of repair on a domestic-brand.  They also have are known to have some issues with gremlins in the electrical systems, depending on the make and model.  Any more questions, just ask."

newhampshire,2n3pu6,Trancefuzion,3,Mon Nov 24 21:58:41 2014 UTC,"I am a NH native that lived in Austin for couple of years recently to take a job there, then returned to NH for a promotion and better job. I'd say I am similar age group as yourself of mid 30s to early 40s. However, I lived across the river from downtown Austin a short walk to Zilker, so I was  downtown all the time for food, hanging out, people watching on 6th was always fun.  When I was in Austin, i wasn't much in to the bands and clubs (too damn loud ina snall space),  festivals like FunFunFun fest or ACL were my preference and these are activities that aren't found here, I loved Zilker and the dog parks like Red Bud Isle.  Natural beauty of the area Austin vs NH I'd say is a toss up as The Lake Travis area is pretty awesome with the surrounding hills and whatnot. And NH scenery is just mind blowing, and changes colors. The ocean is an hour away. So our seafood is fresh as hell. Go up north to the mountains and it is just amazing. Skiing, snowboarding, snowmobiling, hiking in the summer.  Weather wise... Austin gets hot like 100+ degrees during the day in the summer is normal. It cools down to about 80. Rest of the time outside of summer it is still hot, just not melt the soles on your sneakers hot. NH has seasons, sure it gets cold but I'd prefer to be able add clothes to get warm, than be in 100 that there's no defense for if you go outside with your dog. You'll probably be an apartment dweller, let the landlord worry about shovelling snow.  Politically....Texas is a fucking mess. The functionally illiterate governor, Rick ""Look at my glasses"" Perry gets Carte Blanche from all of the yahoos outside of Austin . Austinites recognize Perry is missing a chromosome or 2, but the rest of the state eats his shit up. In my experience NH residents are politically active on a more local and direct manner. Town meetings and the like bring solid participation. The atmosphere pics up around presidential elections. There is a lot of shit happening and plenty to get involved in to quench you political thirst.   Few other things of importance. Our public schools are light years ahead of Texas schools. Evolution is taught here, as opposed to Texas. Funding for schools comes from local towns who collect your property taxes, so generally speaking wealthier towns end up with better schools.   Cost of living here is similar as Austin is no longer inexpensive as it once was, so rent at a decent place could run 800-1500 a month  depending on needs a amenities.  Guns are more prominent here in NH than TX, and much easier to acquire. TO get a concealed carry permit in Texas, you have to take a certification class and pay like $150 for it, where as here you just fill out paperwork to your local town police and pay $10 (that may have increased). And open carry requires no license at all.  Much like the areas in the hinterlands of Austin, there areas in NH where you'll find dilapidated trailer homes half a mile down the road from a mansion or really nice neighborhood. That is just a reflection of how the towns evolved.   Health options are better here in NH, the hospitals generally are very good as we pull students from very good schools in Boston or Dartmouth. If you need a specialist for something rare, the best in the world can usually be found just an hour south in Boston.  Generally, NH people are nice and friendly, there is a very strong live and let live mind set, like if what you are doing doesn't interfere with my freedoms, I don't care. Gay marriage is fine, no one blinks an eye.   Personally, I'd say it would be a no brainer to take the job. It would put you front and center of the upcoming presidential election. Almost all candidates flow through here to test the waters.   However, I wouldn't suggest living in Manchester unless you absolutely have to. Iys not a bad little city to go to for dinner  of a few drinks, but there is crime and shitty areas and crackpots galore. Look a town or two out and you'll find decent places that are more country feeling."
newhampshire,2n3pu6,Biff_H_Tannen,6,Sun Nov 23 00:59:01 2014 UTC,Currently finishing up my senior year at NHIA (New Hampshire Institute of Art) which is located in downtown Manchester. Originally from Pennsylvania.   Its a nice little city with some charm. Bars are plentiful and I can think of three coffee shops within 2 blocks of each other on Elm street. There is plenty to do if you look hard enough. There does seem to be an increasing amount of homeless/drug addicts wandering around the city though. You will be approached asking for cigs/money on an almost daily basis. There are sketchy parts of town and nice parts as with any city.   I've only lived in the city for 3 and a half years so my knowledge is limited. I know from friends living off campus that rent is affordable.   Hope this helped.

Worst case scenario you can move back. I've taken up camping and hunting since I moved out here, honestly haven't taken advantage of the night life Manchester has to offer very much. But when I do go out I always have fun. Winter is interesting for me, but probably cause I've been here for a year and a half so I'm only going in to my second one. I'm sure it gets old after several of them. I would have to agree with the comment about the political thing. Mainly gonna find more of the left leaning people in Mass. Overall I like it here.

Winter: 1.5 hrs to mountains and skiing, although there's a little ski hill right in Manchester-good place to learn if you don't know how. Summer: 45 mins to the ocean and less time to the lakes.

Boston is one hour away without traffic. Lots of music venues, museums, sorts, etc.  For Manchester,  Check out studio 550 -they offer dance and art classes, good place to meet like minded folks.  We have a boatload of coffee shops downtown.  Lots of political activity to keep you busy too. Saint Anselm college, southern nh university and unh-manchester along with nh institute of art are the colleges in the area. They often host talks, shows and political discussions and debates. There are poetry slams and stand up comedy around town. There's a great theater in town - palacetheatre.org  Tupelo music Hall is a good music venue in a neighboring town.

newhampshire,2n25fa,Monkey2525,7,Sun Nov 23 01:53:03 2014 UTC,"Here is her sister Barbara Webber working in the mill. She is the last surviving woman (as of 2011) who worked at Turkey Pond. Barbara and Norma Webber were 21 and 18 when they worked there in 1942.    When they began to lose male workers due to war, a second sawmill was built in 1942 at the pond to be operated by women. The mill was dubbed the first women's sawmill in the country.  Many of the women, Smith said, found work at the sawmill through an employment service in Concord. They tried mostly to find people who had machine experience, and many of the women that worked at the sawmill had previously worked on farms, but several hadn't, such as the Webber sisters, who were looking for something fun to do while their boyfriends were at war. Two other women came from the state hospital to work there.  Smith said the average wage for a woman during this time was not even $2 per day, but the starting pay at the sawmill was $4. That price eventually went up to $4.50 after the forestry supervisor lobbied to give the women the same wages men were getting, which was unprecedented at the time.  ""He was so impressed with them he figured why should they make less than guys in the same job,"" Smith said. ""... The organization was so surprised how good the women were, how dedicated and loyal they were to the job.""   link"

newhampshire,2mzf4j,shackinthewoods,6,Fri Nov 21 13:48:38 2014 UTC,I would use the shit out of this
newhampshire,2mzf4j,Themalster,7,Fri Nov 21 19:20:01 2014 UTC,"I'll also add that it needs to be commuter rail priced, not like the $16-25 the Downeaster costs each way. Costs the same or less to drive and park downtown."
newhampshire,2mzf4j,nill0c,3,Fri Nov 21 14:57:43 2014 UTC,Costs the same or less to drive and park downtown.    And that's only if you're traveling alone! Take a family of 4 round trip on the Downeaster? May as well hire a chauffeur service.
newhampshire,2mzf4j,PowPowPowerCrystal,3,Fri Nov 21 16:56:11 2014 UTC,"Well, since the commuter rail uses zone pricing the further out you are from the hub the more you pay. The commuter rail goes up to zone 10 currently (Wickford Junction, Rhode Island). That costs $11.50 each way or $362 for a monthly pass.   The stops in Manchester would likely be in zone 9 or 10. So the price would be cheaper than the Downeaster, but trip time would be longer because the commuter rail stops more frequently."
newhampshire,2mzf4j,hipster_garbage,2,Fri Nov 21 17:20:57 2014 UTC,"$0.56 includes depreciation and wear and tear, though. Most people think only of gas and time when they say how much a trip ""costs."""
newhampshire,2mzf4j,ANewMachine615,1 point,Fri Nov 21 17:58:59 2014 UTC,"True, I'm coming from Exeter, down to around the center of town Dartmouth St., but I was only counting gas, as I drive a fully more-or-less depreciated vehicle that I repair myself on the cheap and gets an average of 29.5 mpg on these trips.  Most importantly I make the trip once a month or so (and usually my wife comes along, halving that cost), if I was a daily commuter, I'd strongly consider a monthly pass, but as it is, I go down and come home weird hours and not very often, which is another problem with the Downeaster, I'd have to come home at 1am most times…  Edit: I just looked at multi ride passes, kinda a crock, they only save you <$1 off the super saver tickets… unless ride the thing daily."
newhampshire,2mzf4j,nill0c,8,Fri Nov 21 18:01:45 2014 UTC,If they do this - I hope they add multiple stops and lots of parking.  There is also a need for express trains that stop only a couple of times in the larger stations.
newhampshire,2mzf4j,b0ltzmann138e-23,7,Fri Nov 21 18:20:33 2014 UTC,"I moved to NH in early 1983 and recall reading about plans to extend commuter rail from Lowell to Nashua.  And for 30+ years I've been reading about similar studies, but nothing has ever happened.  If we had built a half-mile of track every year Nashua would already have rail service.  I love rail, but I'm not holding my breath."
newhampshire,2mzf4j,horrabin13,2,Fri Nov 21 14:45:34 2014 UTC,I want this to be a thing so badly! I would take the train to work (in Lowell) every damn day!
newhampshire,2mzf4j,Aly-oops,3,Fri Nov 21 16:47:26 2014 UTC,It'd be nice if they extended the same line to Durham -- so I could travel from here to Manchester and even on to Boston on the same line.
newhampshire,2mzf4j,dat_information,2,Fri Nov 21 17:48:07 2014 UTC,"There also really isn't much need for a Durham to Manchester rail line, even the bus Portsmouth has to Manch is pushing the edge of demand."
newhampshire,2mzf4j,PowPowPowerCrystal,1 point,Fri Nov 21 16:06:36 2014 UTC,"Apparently the economics don't make sense past Manchester. It'd be about $10 per rider to maintain the tracks to Manchester. If you go to Concord, it's more like $60 per rider. That's a pretty expensive ticket.  They didn't do a Durham analysis, but I wager it's similar."
newhampshire,2mzf4j,ANewMachine615,1 point,Fri Nov 21 20:12:09 2014 UTC,"It makes sense, the amtrack from durham to Boston is already a little too expensive for the average student. But It would be nice for all the kids with family in Manchester."
newhampshire,2mzf4j,dat_information,1 point,Fri Nov 21 18:01:33 2014 UTC,"There's already train service from Durham to Boston.  I rode it last year going from Durham to Baltimore, MD.  Its Amtrak, not MBTA.   Don't know what the ticket cost for Durham to North Station is, but Durham to Baltimore was slightly cheaper than air two weeks out."
newhampshire,2mzf4j,g3wd,3,Fri Nov 21 20:53:39 2014 UTC,"Not this again. No transit line in the country comes close to covering its own operating costs or project costs. They're all taxpayer-subsidized money pits.  Even the ones that attract a reasonable number of riders - and there's no guarantee there, either. The Mass commuter rail system has seen declining ridership for the last 10 years. Nobody wants to sit on a train for 2 or 3 hours for what would take only an hour by car or bus, not to mention the high cost and poor service that comes with it.  A more efficient use of taxpayer resources would be to increase the number and frequency of bus runs between the cities and even then, you'll probably still lose money."
newhampshire,2mzf4j,SwallowedABug,1 point,Sun Nov 23 05:03:26 2014 UTC,The MBTA is particularly a money pit because even their bus drivers start at $65k with full benefits and pensions. I'm a fucking chemist and I don't make nearly that.

newhampshire,2mzf4j,3tondickpunch,3,Sun Nov 23 05:03:59 2014 UTC,"To add to what /u/Themalster said, they're not upkept to a level that would allow them to handle the type of volume we're talking about here. A lot of the proposed project, IIRC, was taking existing lines and widening them, strengthening them, etc. And then you have to add depots for stops, deal with the traffic problems potentially caused by these trains crossing towns far more frequently, etc. Hardly an easy solution."
newhampshire,2mzf4j,ANewMachine615,4,Fri Nov 21 17:57:54 2014 UTC,"They're all being used by commercial rail companies, or have been either reclaimed by woods, or ripped up for rail trails."

newhampshire,2mzf4j,Shinden9,1 point,Fri Nov 21 19:19:17 2014 UTC,"While the Nashua corridor seems to be their corridor of choice....it should be mentioned that the current I-93 designs being built DO include a rail corridor.  The secondary bridges just north of Exit 5 that cross a nameless dirt road are actually crossing the rail corridor where it would dive west to the airport.

If you are looking for cheaper apartments and don't want to limit yourself to the ghetto, I recommend the west side of town, should also make it easy for you to hop on 293 and get up to Concord for work.  Good luck and welcome to NH!"
newhampshire,2mv7nd,1778,2,Thu Nov 20 12:27:43 2014 UTC,"Funny enough I live in a property owned by red oak.  Its not that bad IMO, though the insulation of this apartment built in '86 needs to be redone."
newhampshire,2mv7nd,dariusdetiger,1 point,Fri Nov 21 23:09:53 2014 UTC,"A friend of mine rented from Red Oak, and other than the location it wasn't terrible, for the price, it was in a lower class neighborhood but the neighbors were all really friendly. And they never had any issues with management. What exactly is wrong with Red Oak?"
newhampshire,2mv7nd,Sophistifuck,1 point,Sun Dec 7 20:59:18 2014 UTC,"I have just always heard bad stories over the years from many folks in the rental biz.  The current story is a friend of mine's ceiling caved in from years of water damage, along down with it comes black mold and bed bugs from the apartment above.  A bad situation, but made worse by management, the place is not livable with those conditions, ceiling not fixed, mold not cleaned/removed and bed bug treatment delayed. My friend says ok well I am just going to move because I can't live there and they aren't doing anything to remedy it. They refuse to fix the issues or to let her out of the lease so now her and roommate have been living back at home for 2 months with her parents and still paying rent for the uninhabitable apartment as red oak keeps telling them they have to keep paying or if they stop they are breaking the lease and will have to   pay the whole rest of the years worth of rent regardless of living there or not."
newhampshire,2mv7nd,1778,1 point,Mon Dec 8 03:13:20 2014 UTC,"Thats certainly understandable. My friend didn't live there for long, and didnt have issues canceling his lease early for unrelated issues, but his appt never had any issues like that. Granted, before they moved in they had remodeled the place after the previous tenant shot himself deaf after trying to burn the place to the ground. Management did neglect to mention those details though."
newhampshire,2mv7nd,Sophistifuck,2,Mon Dec 8 04:11:04 2014 UTC,"As others have said, try an independent landlord and maybe best to use the paper instead of Craigslist.  I moved here from out of state, rent can be expensive and will likely be in the higher end of your figure, but maybe you can get lucky with finding something.  Good luck and enjoy NH! - I really like it here.  Beer festival season and winter are both awesome.  If you do end up in Concord, maybe we can grab a drink sometime.

newhampshire,2mv7nd,amp324,1 point,Sat Nov 22 05:42:43 2014 UTC,"If I were you, I'd go for AWD.  I've only been here for 2 years and we've had lots of snow each winter and probably another snowy season this year.  My AWD has certainly come in handy.    Getting a newer vehicle though, be prepared to pay high car registration fees.  I'm not sure what you're used to paying, but transferring my out of state registration cost a little over $200.  The year after it was about $120.  It's different for every car and is based off some calculation from the state/city (I believe they use age of car and MSRP).  That may seem high, but also keep in mind that you wont be paying a state income tax.  My previous state, I only paid ~ $20 to renew."
newhampshire,2mv7nd,amp324,1 point,Sat Nov 22 08:46:02 2014 UTC,$200?  Holy smoke!  That's where they make up for the no sales tax and income. Lol.   Yeah I'm going to think about this some more in regards to awd or fwd.  Thanks
newhampshire,2mv7nd,tone_hails,1 point,Sat Nov 22 10:52:39 2014 UTC,"True, but that's a yearly figure and the state & city don't tax your income each pay check.  Only federal taxes are taken out.  Divide that number by 12 and maybe it won't seem as bad..."
newhampshire,2mv7nd,Aly-oops,2,Sat Nov 22 12:37:44 2014 UTC,true. And I do realize that but sometimes I have to sit back and think about what you said because im so used to how things are in NC. at the end of the day im coming out ahead once i move up there.

newhampshire,2mv7nd,Politikr,1 point,Thu Nov 20 12:26:55 2014 UTC,"Price range between $600-900 depending on the place.  It's really up  in the air at this point and I'm kind of just waiting until the first week of December when I'll have my stuff packed and heading up.  I'll probably just drive up and put everything in storage, shop around for an apartment for a few days and then head back to NC until the 1st of January when I officially move for good before I start my new job."
newhampshire,2mv7nd,Politikr,1 point,Thu Nov 20 14:37:35 2014 UTC,"If you want to rent at a lower price range, I actually think Concord is cheaper than Manchester if you look for and independent landlord, not a company. I rented a 2-bedroom I'm a nice house managed by nice landlords that lived up the street, it was only $650. So definitely look in the local paper instead of the net. If you'd like I can email you the rental section of the concord monitor."
newhampshire,2mv7nd,fflexz,1 point,Thu Nov 20 12:37:28 2014 UTC,"Yeah that's a good idea with the local paper.  I looked and figured moat were older people who don't use Craigslist, which  is fine, but I didn't see any photos. I'll probably contact a few people before I get there and just set up an appointment to view a apartment."

newhampshire,2ms14z,ponfarrwinner,6,Wed Nov 19 15:45:23 2014 UTC,"Bentley said recently, seated at the kitchen table of his house at the end of a gravel road. “They don’t understand the risk they’re putting their citizenry in. They don’t understand the concept of prevention.” He said he has called 911 about a dozen times since 2010 and “the response has been paltry at best.”   Why the hell did he need to call 911 a dozen times?  I've lived in more populated areas of NH and have only called it once in 15 years...but maybe I'm the weird one, I don't know.  That was a decent article though.  I've been doing a lot of work in northern Merrimack & Coos counties lately, and did often wonder if they needed a police force."
newhampshire,2ms14z,I-am-Gizmoduck,6,Wed Nov 19 19:44:57 2014 UTC,The guy is probably a busybody. You know the type. Car parked outside looks fishy; call the cops. Neighbors are partying too loud; call the cops.
newhampshire,2ms14z,Market-Anarchist,7,Wed Nov 19 23:54:04 2014 UTC,"“There’s nobody sitting at the Crossroads store” — one of the few retail businesses in Salisbury — “drinking a coffee in a blue suit to make people think that it’s not a good idea to rob the store,” Bentley said. “There’s nobody sitting out beside the road running radar in the morning to slow people down. There’s nobody driving around looking for a van or a pickup truck up backed up to a house ... If the neighbor happens to see it, he might or might not call it in. He might not even notice it. There’s nobody dedicated to looking for things that might be going on.”   Yet 911 calls are down 50% and most people seem to like it.   This is a pretty interesting read though. The concept that every town needs their own police department is pretty inefficient, though I'd be curious the cost on the other end for the State Police to provide for these smalls towns."
newhampshire,2ms14z,skankersores,1 point,Wed Nov 19 19:32:44 2014 UTC,"On one hand, yeah it sucks that small towns are losing police departments due to lack of funding, thus having to pull in State Troopers who should be elsewhere.

newhampshire,2mtv7k,Alyson_Hendryx,0,Thu Nov 20 02:07:17 2014 UTC,I got mine at zales they seem to have cheaper prices than the other big name competitors. Kay is really fucking over priced IMO.  Where ever you go get the theft/loss re-sizing coverage. Also try to figure out here ring size before hand by either just asking or having a friend or mom find out.  Also as a woman please have an idea of what shape and kinds she likes again recruit a friend or just ask her...get her to use pictures to explain preferably. Shes going to wear it for the rest of her life..so even though you like it she might not.  lastly consider if you want to buy the engagement ring with the wedding band as set generally its cheaper to buy them together as a set and it will match perfectly.  Also when it comes time to purchase your wedding band amazon sells pretty much exact replicas of anything sold in stores for 1/3 of the price Unless of course you want real gold. But tungsten or other metals are dirt cheap on amazon bought my husbands ring at zales for 300$ he lost it a week later and bought an exact copy on amazon for 18$ cant tell or feel a difference.

Ayotte for not voting for this, however I would like to see a comprehensive plan that is more based on holding those in control of security accountable for misuse of power rather than potentially compromising security by adding extra steps for real threats to be prevented.

I appreciate hearing from you.  As you may know, on July 29, 2014, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduced S. 2685.  If enacted, S. 2685 would prohibit the bulk collection of an individual's call detail phone records under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act (Public Law 107-56).  The bill would permit the collection of call detail phone records only pursuant to a specific selection term, which would narrow the scope of the search and results.  In addition, the bill would also require declassification reviews of some Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) orders and create a Special Advocate who would be tasked with advocating for individual privacy rights and civil liberties before the FISC.  I believe we must be careful not to damage our counterterrorism efforts by disclosing classified information to terrorists.  It is essential that government programs operate within the bounds of the Constitution and appropriate statutory restrictions, and Congress and the judicial branch must exercise rigorous oversight.  These surveillance programs are overseen by the FISC, regulated by executive monitoring, and subject to congressional oversight.  I have attended classified briefings on the content and legality of National Security Agency programs. Additionally, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the PATRIOT Act require periodic reauthorization, and Congress will again have the opportunity to review oversight capabilities and evaluate transparency and privacy concerns.  On November 18, 2014, S. 2685 failed to advance in the Senate by a 58 to 42 vote.  I voted against moving the bill, which had not received consideration and study in Committee, forward due to concerns that this bill would significantly hamstring criminal justice efforts to keep our nation secure.  American citizens' privacy rights must be protected while simultaneously guarding our nation against terrorist threats.  It is important to ensure that our intelligence community has appropriate tools to gather intelligence and prevent attacks against our country.  I believe we must ensure a balance between liberty and security as our nation works to stop ongoing terrorist threats to our citizens and our homeland.  I will support measures to provide greater transparency and oversight to counterterrorism programs.  Again, thank you for taking the time to contact me.  It is important for me to hear from you regarding the current issues affecting New Hampshire and our nation.  Please do not hesitate to be in touch again if I may be of further assistance.  Sincerely, Signature Kelly A. Ayotte U. S. Senator"

newhampshire,2mmcod,soxfan4life,1 point,Wed Nov 19 00:50:23 2014 UTC,"My favorite campground is Passaconaway campground on the Kanc. Best one in my opinion. You can still see the other campsites, but unless you're going back country camping or off a trail, you're not going to find that seclusion at any of the established campgrounds.   Passaconaway is small and, if you get a site on the back loop, it's definitely more secluded than the other campgrounds on the Kanc. Plus it's a short walk through the woods to the river. Last time I was there, I saw a mother and baby moose right near our site.   The other nice thing is that it's a very short drive to the Jigger Johnson campground; which has showers (bring quarters). I don't recommend staying at Jigger Johnson though. It's the largest and, in my opinion, loudest and more 'family oriented' (a lot of kids; which isn't bad but it's not my thing).   Avoid Tripoli rd, unless you want parties with drunk college kids. I'd also recommend staying away from any of the sites too close to either end of the Kanc (Big Rock, Hancock, Blackberry Crossing and Covered Bridge). Since they're more convenient, they fill up quick and the sites are not as secluded. However, the nice thing about Covered Bridge is that it's one of the few camp grounds that you can reserve in advance, which is nice to have a guaranteed site, but then you're forced to go regardless of the weather.   A little bit further north are Sugarloaf 1 and 2 off of rt 3. This would be my back up recommendation if Passaconaway doesn't work out. These have decently secluded sites, are a bit cheaper (if i remember right), and are also a short walk to the river. No showers there though, but that's nothing a dip in the river with some environmentally friendly camp soap  can't fix. Since these are a bit more out of the way, they fill up a lot less quickly too.   If you need any other recommendations, let me know. I've spent a lot of time up there."

The camp sites in the back were so secluded, you couldnt hear or see ANYTHING. you might as well have been in the middle of the woods.   the rest of the park was pretty standard however.   The only piece of real info I have on the place, is that it was past some native american gift store.

newhampshire,2mmcod,And_Dan,2,Tue Nov 18 18:09:31 2014 UTC,"Ok, so there's 2 campgrounds that I think fit.

See here (this is looking south and the river is on the left of the road):  http://www.ssqq.com/travel/images/new%20hampshire55.jpg  Take a look at this map of the Dry River Campground in the notch:  http://www.nhstateparks.org/uploads/pdf/Dry-River_Campground-Map.pdf  There are several campsites on the right side. Just like you described, toilets at the beginning, you park, walk in a bit, it's right on a river and there is a mountain literally right across the river. You might have been at site p2 or p5; which are the closest to the river. Keep in mind that the map might not be to scale so the site might be closer to the river than it appears. If I were to bet on it, I'd say this is where you stayed. It fits all your criteria.   The other one that it might be is the 4th iron campground, but I think Dry River is more likely. I've never stayed at 4th iron, but I know that there are walk in campsites that are pretty remote and probably have a similar view to what you remember just based off it's location. Unfortunately 4th iron is a small campground so I couldn't find a map of it.   http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/whitemountain/recarea/?recid=79278  Hope this helps."

newhampshire,2mmcod,PowPowPowerCrystal,1 point,Tue Nov 18 17:51:37 2014 UTC,Went camping at Jigger Johnson on the Kanc last month. I've been doing state parks every year for the past 5 years and I feel that this was much more enjoyable. I don't see myself going to state parks half as much after going up to the Kanc.
newhampshire,2mmcod,itsMalarky,0,Tue Nov 18 17:33:09 2014 UTC,I just camp off trail and find a site that the american money club hasn't hidden so you'll be more encouraged to spend money at their sites/huts/platforms.
