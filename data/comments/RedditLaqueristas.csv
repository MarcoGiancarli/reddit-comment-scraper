RedditLaqueristas,3e1unx,Jaggerous,2,Tue Jul 21 08:47:38 2015 UTC,I just ordered my very first Barry M polish. Does it work well for stamping? I know some brands are better for stamping than others.
RedditLaqueristas,3e1unx,tragopanic,2,Tue Jul 21 08:51:14 2015 UTC,I love Barry M for stamping. Especially their gelly range.  This is just regular barry M shocking pink 272 stamped on Gelly Barry M Fondant 512.  The darker colours obviously stamp better on lights. But they have a great thickness. And provided you let the base layer dry enough it's very easy to do.  Plate is Sugar Bubbles 029

RedditLaqueristas,3dxr0f,letsgosmokess,3,Mon Jul 20 16:54:59 2015 UTC,"Room temp filtered water!!! I tried several times to get water marbling to work with tap water and failed miserably. Since I started using room temp filtered water it has gone MUCH better.  As far as polishes go, its all trial and error. I thought thinner polishes would work better but that isn't always the case. The OPI I used was thin but the Essie was fairly thick so experiment with different polishes!  Paint your nails one of the water marble colors your are using as a base. I used the pink Essie. I have tried no base color (the polish is thinned out in the water and you can see the nail underneath) and white as a base (haven't found a white that isn't streaky or has to have 3+ coats for opacity which makes it too thick) and neither worked very well....someone let me know if you have found a white that works well with water marble!  Make several rings. Each time I did a finger, I made at least four to five rings of each color.   Use a safety pin, not a toothpick to draw your design. Toothpicks were too thick for me and I ended up messing up my design. Also every time I draw a line, I remove the safety pin snd wipe it clean on a piece of tissue.   When placing your finger in the water, pay close attention to which part of the design you want to show up and hover over it. I hold my finger (wrapped in masking tape around the nail) flat and lower it into the design as steady and evenly as I can.  Once in the water, I kinda anchor my finger to the side and gently shake of any air bubbles that may have gotten trapped.  I blow on the water to dry the polish on the surface and then use a qtip to remove it. Then I remove my submerged finger.   If I notice any water drops on my nail I immediately fling my hand away from me (to send the water flying off) and then blow REALLY HARD to get any remaining off without ruining the design...this happens on just about every finger and I typically have to blow a few times lol.  Take off the tape, clean around the cuticle with acetone and a fine tipped brush and topcoat! Tada! Youtube videos taught me all of this...these are the techniques that worked for me, keep playing around and I'm sure you'll get it too! Hopefully my next one will turn out just as good with more than three polishes. :-D"

RedditLaqueristas,3dtobw,briarbeauty,5,Sun Jul 19 11:27:28 2015 UTC,"You mention not going over the same area twice with the sponge while it's still wet- does that mean you're doing just ONE ""dab"" per nail, or are you doing a few dabs in quick succession, moving the sponge slightly back and forth along the length of the nail to help blend the colors?   Beautiful work! And good warning about the staining from the turquoise one!"
RedditLaqueristas,3dtobw,triforceful,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:06:28 2015 UTC,Thanks!! I normally place the sponge on my nail and push it gently down so that I cover the entire nail. You can do it by dabbing quickly but don't go over it when it's drying.

RedditLaqueristas,3dtobw,Picklada,3,Sun Jul 19 17:13:58 2015 UTC,They're essentially regular paints but they're advertised as being easily blended. They also are a bit less opaque than an average polish. It's basically all advertising.

RedditLaqueristas,3dzr2d,slendermansdaughter,2,Tue Jul 21 02:27:59 2015 UTC,Wet n wild black is really good for stamping. I hear kleancolor is good too but I can't find it so I don't personally tell you how that is. The Sally Hansen insta dry are also good. I have a few pure ice metallic ones that work well. The ideal stamping polish is thicker and  opaque in one coat or just about as close to that as you can get. The more sheer colors don't stamp well for me
