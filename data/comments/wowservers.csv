wowservers,3e451r,SandersonWarrior,3,Tue Jul 21 20:30:53 2015 UTC,"I posted a similar concept and was downvoted to oblivion shortly after on the official WoW.    Where my concept differed was rather than having them maintain multiple patches, have legacy content servers that use a current patch. We have a precedence with servers using Wotlk but locking content to vanilla. This would reduce the programming overhead.    And my concept was to have each xpac have a server for each major raid patch it recieved.    Each server is on a 3 month patch cycle where it advances to the next major patch in that xpac, with all events included.    Once a server runs it's course it is set back to the first patch of the xpac and all players are offered a transfer to another server. Players that stay have their gear restricted to gear associated with that patch when raiding or in pvp, this lets people enjoy their gear and characters without breaking the server.    This lets you, if you choose, progress through all of WoW's history, with greatly reduced programming overhead. It also lets you stay within your favorite patch as well, since you can just transfer servers at the end of a server's lifespan."

wowservers,3e451r,mygoddamnameistaken,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:16:27 2015 UTC,"So there's two counter arguments against this, first of all Blizzard have to admit the defeat, they have to aknewledge that the wow of today is worse then the past, and no developer wants to do that.  Secondly blizzard stated that if it made servers like these, the developers would feel the need to fix bugs and twerk the game play to be better, which in turn wouldnt make it ""legacy"" anymore.  To elaborate in the last point on the last point, faerie fire have the same animation as inner fire in Vanilla, the developers would probably change it to what it is in retail to game the game player better etc etc.  And if anything they probably would add servers like this once the game have had it's last expansion; to get the last money out of it."

You needed to create a new folder(outside of the retail folder all together).  Mine is placed in downloads/privateservers/expanion/(folder).  You overwrote your retail client.
wowservers,3e4g97,dungeonjay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:35:24 2015 UTC,"Do I actually need to redownload cata, mop, and wod, because that is what the battlenet app is trying to get me to do. Or can I just rewrite it back somehow?"
wowservers,3e4g97,dungeonjay,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:02:30 2015 UTC,"Well it is trying to patch your client back up to the current version.  If you still play retail, then you need to go ahead and let it repatch it upwards.  It will automatically rewrite the information so it will connect back to battlnet and that will be your retail folder(again).  After that make a separate folder similar to what I mentioned above when you re-download the torrent for Wrath 3.3.5a.  This way, you have two separate locations of World of Warcraft.  One being for Retail and the other for Dalaran.  When you want to play Dalaran you will need to open the Dalaran folder and launch the WoW.exe found within(never use the launcher).  Also, depending on where you download the Wrath client(if it isn't from Dalaran), you will need to change the Realmlist.wtf file found in that folder's sub-set and write the ip address of Dalaran back again.   Sound good?"

Prot and ret pallys will still have problems with the lack of abilities and mana regen at 60.  also, regarding population. it's been hiting new server peaks every weekend which shows that new people is joinning and leveling. the 10-19 and the 20-29 bg brackets are quite popular atm the server is quite new with only molten core released as raids. onyxia is expected during september and zg will be released later in december. bwl should come 3 months after that...  so for those who like to join a server while it's still in it's early progress stages, now this suit them perfectly."

wowservers,3dzio8,46516481168158431985,6,Mon Jul 20 20:22:08 2015 UTC,"Lack of RDF, so people have to actually travel... usually means pugs are more attentive. Shitty setup for healers - no dual spec, +heal means very low damage in your raiding gear, etc. Makes farming as a healer a pain. Tanks weren't as bad, but still far lower dps than in Wrath (or Cata). Different zones - Outland tilted areas annoyed me, but damn if the instances weren't nice. Progression was king, rep was something you never stopped grinding. Human 10% bonus to rep (and spirit!!!!) was great... oh, for priests at least.  Fights were more frantic, at least early on with 5man heroics being murder on low gear. We actually used cc, and people were willing to wait for it... until end-game gear became common and they expected everyone to be capable of ripping through. Seems the wow community was never very intelligent.  Pallies started to come into their own, Alliance got to play with shaman and the OPness of Chain Heal, rogues learned not to mess with resto druids (sure, you might kill me eventually, but is it really worth the effort?), and flight was still fresh and new.   And you can still access the Vanilla/BC content in WOTLK if you want.   Except no one really cares about it until they get bored with LK. Its virtually a snooze-fest with Wrath balance changes."
wowservers,3dzio8,Rajron,-3,Mon Jul 20 20:28:53 2015 UTC,Tell me why RDF is so bad. Even Vanilla realms implemented their own RDFs somehow because they are too convenient to get rid of now.
wowservers,3dzio8,Peraz,9,Mon Jul 20 20:59:43 2015 UTC,"And that's the problem. It promotes a lazy, antisocial community and is too tempting to avoid. Sit in queue, don't talk to anyone (except talking shit in your global channel of choice), get into a dungeon, rush the first mob without waiting to make sure everyone is ready, roll on everything in sight (because you've never talked to these people before, and probably never will again - so you don't give a shit about them), then when the group wipes because if your mindless rush, either do the same thing again without thinking about why you wiped (and usually pulling before the healer can even buff or drink), or just bail immediately. The only time people talk in RDF groups is to whine.  On the other hand, without RDF you're encouraged to find a guild that's running the content you want to, which will encourage you to not just chat and get to know your guildmates, but probably use VOIP, roll fairly (don't want to get /gkicked after so much effort) and learn tactics that you'll use in raids.  And don't get me started on Raid Finder. Pugging a couple dps was workable back when raids required intelligence and not just gear (or an achievement to prove someone already dragged your retarded ass through it)... pugging the whole group is just stupid - and requires content to be nerfed to match.  Pservers implement it because that's what today's WoW players expect. Its funny that while gaming is far more accepted as a hobby, the ""socially inept, friendless gamer"" of a decade ago that actually managed to maintain peace in 40-man raid groups for a year of painfully slow progression - has been replaced by selfish, thoughtless brats who have no interest in the social aspects of an MMO. These kidiots will tear apart a raiding guild because ""they didn't get their drop this run"", when a decade ago you were expected to grit your teeth and show up every raid night for a month so when your piece did drop, and it was your turn, you would have earned it. RDF allows them to be selfish without consequences, without putting any effort into find a pug - much less a dedicated group they can get along with."
wowservers,3dzio8,Rajron,2,Mon Jul 20 21:14:01 2015 UTC,This hits the nail on the spot. Wotlk was a better game. Vanilla a bettter MMO.
wowservers,3dzio8,trmpah,4,Tue Jul 21 11:14:30 2015 UTC,"Speaking for TBC, five man dungeons were just a lot more fun back then, WOTLK 5 mans were OK but were nowhere close to the TBC heroics in terms of difficulty. And warrior tanking, I liked having to plan out each trash pack rather than just AOE tanking everything and bursting it down without a second thought."
wowservers,3dzio8,Craptola,2,Tue Jul 21 03:33:28 2015 UTC,"In WTLK you can buy the previous raids gear by doing 5man instances and collecting badges. That means that by the time ICC is released all previous content is trivialized. In Vanilla and TBC you have to progress one step at a time from one raid to the other since you need proper gearing before you can enter the high tier raids and you can't just get that gear from running 5mans like in wtlk. Leveling up is much more challenging in vanilla. It takes longer and you die way more often. Mobs hit harder and quests are harder to figure out without guides. Five-man content is much harder in Vanilla and in TBC. Especially TBC heroics can be gruesome. People who played TBC on launch still see nightmares about Arcatraz and Shattered halls heroic. WTLK dungeon running is completely trivial. Just aoe tank and aoe kill everything. No cc, no trash tactics (marking etc), no special pulls. Even in Heroics.  TBC raids are just as iconic as WTLK and they also require just as much strategizing and knowing the tactics etc. Vanilla raids may be simpler in tactics up to aq40 and naxx but the 40 man feel and composition make up in epicness.    For me the game's peak was TBC. It still has the raw and immersive feeling of vanilla and it's streamlined enough to feel modern but not too gamey the way wtlk feels with RFD, RBG and the ""raid catch up with badges"" stuff. A TBC private server with all content released will still have guilds and players progressing through Kara/SSC/TK on their way to BT and SWP. A WTLK private server would just have people farming 5mans to get pre-ICC gear and doing naxx and ulduar only for the achievements with very little challenge.   That being said WTLK would be my next best choice, especially a ""progressive"" style realm like Dalaran."

Wotlk is like the mechanically better version of TBC with more content and Grizzly Hills. And I also dislike every Outland zone. After years of WOTLK, Cata was the edge that made the game so unexpectedly easier at every step it even surprised me. Maybe people share the same feeling about WOTLK, the same feeling I have about Cata."
wowservers,3dzio8,Peraz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:19:07 2015 UTC,What do you mean you don't have to go there?  How else do you get to level 80?

wowservers,3dzio8,dungeonjay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:43:11 2015 UTC,"Wrath introduced RDF which was overkill on community in some people's minds.  However, since the private server scene is where we are at, this changes when you have a lower community pool to work with.  On all the private servers I play on, even large populated ones like Warmane, I continually run across people I recognize.  If I pug(and I do pug a lot in Wrath with RDF), it doesn't take long before I run across the same able bodies in a group.  You will know the ones that have no patience and those are the ones I have no patience on and will flat out tell them, ""You rush the mobs, you die.""  Simple as that.  Either that pisses them off and they leave or they wait.  Either way, smaller servers mean they have to play with you or they can go twiddle their thumbs elsewhere.    So when someone says more community feel with lower expansions, I think that the same can be said of the higher expansions on private servers.    In the end, it then becomes a matter of content and what you prefer to play in.  What style gameplay and what mechanics you liked the most.  Everyone is partial to a particular playset for one reason or another."
wowservers,3dzio8,nimeral,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:20:05 2015 UTC,"Why no one have mentioned ""only one raid""? I mean, ~no one raids Naxx or Ulduar on 3.3.5, and no one scriptes them (except progression servers). So almost fresh 80 immidiately fights a Lich King. Blah.  I'm exaggerating, but it's a huge turn away for me. RDF is another very bad thing. Also, levelling speed hit the group quests, so they just had to remove them in Cata.  Personally, my ""the best"" is TBC, I like its game philosophy (and story, btw) more. But TBC servers are not better than so-so, that's why I play another great content - Vanilla (on Kronos, as most eyed of you already know)."

wowservers,3dxync,ChaoticKid,3,Mon Jul 20 13:23:04 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend playing any of the expansions beyond Cataclysm on private servers, because all of those are so broken that it's just not worth your time. And even when it comes to Cataclysm, I'd be hard pressed to recommend anything other than Atlantiss.  My personal recommendation is Dalaran-WoW, if you're interested in giving Wrath of the Lich King a try. It offers a good balance between the casual newbies and the hardcore pros, though the leveling is slower and more difficult than in Atlantiss."
wowservers,3dxync,Thalabon,0,Mon Jul 20 13:51:30 2015 UTC,"Dalaran is a good server but it's been slowly dieing. Where at one point they had a thriving community and tons of guilds now it has dwindled down substantially.  This can IMO be attributed to a few things:  1) 1x speed, while a lot of players like 1x and they do have an insta-70 option for donations, most people don't want to invest the time into leveling to 80 at 1x and the donation option is pricey since you need 12pts but have to buy minimum 20 to be able to do it.  2) Lack of PvP, because of the lack of userbase (it's gone down quite a bit since I started there) there is less PvP, less PvP means less to do outside of raid schedule.  3) Lack of leadership among the admins to make the necessary changes in order to keep the server growing. There isn't even a graph on the site to show current online users and/or what peek hours look like, and during the highest peeks a lot of those users aren't level capped.  I feel if they would make insta 70 cheaper, add insta 80 for the price 70 currently costs, and increase the leveling speed their numbers would go up, but now that it has dwindled and they've gotten a reputation of not being that progressive when it comes to keeping an eye on things like that I feel the server is done for.   There isn't many options for guilds if you want to raid and if you start your own guild there isn't a lot of people available to join who are level 80 and aren't already in a guild. At one point summer of last year the server was doing a lot better. If you like leveling content and don't mind having little PvP then it's a great server, if you want to have your own guild and/or don't like the current guilds available for raiding then it's not the best choice.  I'm sure much has improved since I last was active but anytime I've logged in the server is more dead than the last time. Great server but shame how much it's fallen off the map IMO. I feel like unless somebody makes a new server or blizzard finally caves and makes legacy servers I won't find a private realm worth playing on.  At its peek, Dalaran was an awesome server and if it had maintained it and grown the issues I outline wouldn't have been so problematic, but as it stands even though it might be the best current option, it lacks what is necessary to have true WoW-like experience, in trying so hard to be wow-like they've alienated what would have made them truly wow-like IMO, a thriving community and player base."

Servers for these do exist however they are nowhere near as polished as servers for other expansions and i doubt they have a great population behind them either.  Now the next most recent expansion ""Cataclysm"" is generally pretty easy to get into at the start and does have arguably the greatest scripted server to date called Atlantiss (yes double s) and has a decent population for it to boot ( i think around 1200 people at peak times between 7-10 pm cest) when it comes to cataclysm servers Atlantiss stands far and away at the forefront.  http://atlantiss.eu/pages/1 <--- this is the atlantiss self download page ( I recommend having qbittorent to download the torrent, also use qbittorrent for any wrath of the lich king client torrent)  here is the link to a server review by popular private server reviewer dodgykebaab on Atlantiss mind however that this review is from a time when Atlantiss was on patch 4.0.6 instead of 4.3.4 (essentially just means more content) as it is now and I believe the installation changeup he speaks of here isn't relevant anymore."

Atm there are only a few WoD private servers and they are not good. You'll encounter alot of bugs and it will most likely ruin your first wow experience. Id say go for a WOTLK (Wrath of the Lich King) expansion server. (you can check the list.) In order to play wow on a certain private server you need to have that server's client version. Vanilla WoW pservers use 1.12.1 TBC (The Burning Crusade) pservers use 2.4.3 WOTLK pserver use 3.3.5 There also are Cataclysm, Mists of Pandaria and WoD private servers. But as i said those servers are not that good. After you chose a server you should change your realmlist. Each server has something called a realmlist. Which is basicly a connection key to that server. To change the realmlist address you have to enter your WoW client folder and open the realmlist.wtf file with a text editor and  change it. IE: wowrandomserver might have the realmlist set realmlist logon.wowrandomserver.com. Pretty much all servers have their realmlist address listed on their website. Good Luck."

wowservers,3dyz6a,Ambassador_Buta,2,Mon Jul 20 18:01:28 2015 UTC,"Client size is not a good measure for quality. Bring up the gameplay differences instead, like Vanilla being more old, grindy and rewarding, WotLK easier on newcomers and with a faster leveling experience, and TBC being the middle ground of the two."

wowservers,3dyz6a,Ambassador_Buta,2,Mon Jul 20 19:17:35 2015 UTC,"Right because you like it, bring more solid arguments to the table, so the new player feels more reasons to join what you want them to.  There's a lot of good stuff to speak about for Vanilla, much more compelling than fewer GBs :)"
wowservers,3dyz6a,Heyharrer,0,Mon Jul 20 19:50:31 2015 UTC,"Well I really don't see the point about arguing because it's entirely due to personal preference. If he wants a buggy mess he can play the expacs including and past Cata, if he wants close to the real game then he can install both WotLK and Vanilla and play every private server on those games for all I care.  OP needs to tell us what he likes in an MMO if he wants to know more."

It's unknown why they do this (some said that they control the influx of new players on correct realms, like new people see more people on ragnaros and go there and that way they do pop control, some said that it's people who are on char selection screen and not counted in-game) and it would be at least a similar case with a lot of other private servers. (wowcircle faking 50% etc)  It's just so far from being positive in a lot of cases that I really think it's not worth the work to make such a list."

There are small easy-to-use installers for Cataclysm, while for WotLK and below they will need to download the whole client. Torrents are usually the best way to download clients, and easy to find around the net.  For the optimal settings, that depends on the kind of server you have. It all boils down to Normal or PvP ruleset and low or high exp/reputation/gold/profession rates."

wowservers,3dynrv,HypeQQ,3,Mon Jul 20 17:21:43 2015 UTC,Well it is clear you have no clue what you are doing.  You will not find a single working 6.2 private server anywhere.  If you want anything playable you will need to run WOTLK or TBC (3.3.5a or 2.4.3) server.  This is pretty much over your head from what I can tell.... As this is not like Minecraft where you turn key a new sever.  I suggest just joining a free private server instead.

wowservers,3dxy90,anonymousxx007,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:19:25 2015 UTC,"Things like hacking and blizzlike-ness really vary from server to server, so it's difficult to give a clear answer to that.  It is a fact that there are definitely more hackers on private servers than on retail, but how much and how rapidly they are fought against relies on the moderation of the server in general.   As for the Blizzard state (usually referred to ""Blizzlike""), most servers like to increase the exp rate for leveling purposes, though donation shops, increased gold gain and gear selling are common sights as well.  When it comes to Blizzlike functionality, there are no servers yet that have managed to flawlessly emulate the older expansions. However, the current most functional servers are considered to be Atlantiss (Cataclysm), Dalaran-WoW (WotLK) and TrueWoW (WotLK). I personally don't know which TBC server is the most functional (though I have heard people claiming only Excalibur is worth it), and you will often find Kronos and Nostalrius players bickering about which Vanilla server is better."
wowservers,3dxy90,Thalabon,2,Mon Jul 20 14:00:14 2015 UTC,"The differences between Kronos and Nostalrius is that Nostalrius have the bigger population but Kronos have slightly better scripts.

Hackers are very rare , and they don't last long. The amount of working content depends on the expansion you want to play , ranging from near perfect for vanilla,great for TBC,WotLK, to playable/little working content in the later expansions such as MOP,WOD. Most servers do not have custom things aside from changed xp rates. If you need more help feel free to pm me."

wowservers,3dxy90,dungeonjay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:23:22 2015 UTC,"They have been scripted using backwards rewriting.  Any of the patches have a stable core developed outside of the framework that Blizzard used and then emulated to work similar to the principle that Blizzard developed.  This usually takes scripting and rewriting.  A lot of the information they process comes from taking ""sniffs"" of packet information and transforming it into recognizable scripts that we see when logging into their server side.  The better the development team; the better the server.    Need to grab the client version that the private server is hosting: be it 3.3.5a(Wrath), 2.4.3(TBC), etc.    The private server you choose will have a torrent to download the patch of wow they want you to run.  It usually has the Realmlist.wtf setup to automatically work for them as well.  I recommend setting up a download folder for this particular version and be separate from retail WoW(if you have that on your computer).  Also, when accessing the server version you will need to launch their wow.exe found in the torrent download.  Do not use the blizzard launcher as this will automatically update your client to the current 6.2 retail setting.    They rarely get hacked - it can be done - and I wouldn't stress about it in the long run.  The only true information you are providing is an email address(usually) and a password.    Last thing of note, do not use an email address as the form of login name for the private server of your interest.  Instead, I would create a regular name and use that as the login name.  The only time to provide an email address is just when it asks for it and never more than that."

More recent client brings things like Dual Spec, RDF, Achievements etc but also affects class balance in some slightly odd ways. Very well scripted, population is very friendly and growing (From approximately 25 - 400 in about 3 weeks). Currently A:H ratio is a tad skewed but RDF is currently merged so it doesn't really matter. I'd recommend rolling horde if you do decide to join.

It's basically Vanilla with WotLK leveling (about 2x as fast as Vanilla) and all the perks that come with it, i.e. quality of life improvements like comparing items in ur inventory to items u are wearing, multiple items sendable by post, RDF, actually useful talent trees, not being oom every 2nd mob while preserving Vanilla endgame difficulty.  Class balance is ""new"" in the sense that noone really knows how WotLK talent trees work out in a lvl 60 environment - the server is pretty fresh so there aren't that many 60s to test this properly.

I can't really be bothered to level an alt or grind the old reputations, so all I really do now is log on to raid and farm for gold whenever I need it.  My guess is that I'll probably quit playing once I've grown bored of killing the Lich King, whenever it becomes available on Dalaran-WoW."

That being said, I will play this as long as this is a viable avenue of entertainment with fellow players and friends."
wowservers,3dv5k2,dejvyd,9,Sun Jul 19 19:52:48 2015 UTC,"Currently on my way to 60, just hit 34 on my Pally. Pathing is okay, nothing special. Few bugs here and there. Scripting is actually pretty decent, not actually had a quest gimp out or a scripted piece not work. The dungeons I've had so far went off without a hitch.  I'm glad that it's remaining PvE otherwise it just leads to max levels ganking lowbies.  Developers seem to be unsure what they want to do at the moment, the EMFH issue of late is a prime example but they also seem to be squashing bugs rapidly. Community is growing but seems very very friendly. Greatly enjoying my current guild but people just seem nice all round.   I think once they've wrangled some of the balance issues we'll be onto something good. Not expecting any class balance but raids need tuning from what I can tell.   Talents are obviously an issue with it basically making some class's useless due to not reaching higher points in trees. But that's vanilla as fuck, deal with it.   Honestly it's the ""idea"" of the server that attracted me, a content driven roadmap all the way to Lich King with the same character sounds beyond ideal to me."
wowservers,3dv5k2,kaytotes,5,Sun Jul 19 22:15:07 2015 UTC,"The premise is solid: A great concept rolled into a neat little package for longevity.  The owner isn't in a rush to push through the progressive content - which is a relief - and you can enjoy leveling a toon at your leisure.  They will be polishing the system as it goes.  Transferring the fixes to Truewow(stablishing that server in the process) and eventually bringing the two under one roof.  I'm with Dodgy when he said this is his home, it is now mine when I'm not messing around with friends on other servers."
wowservers,3dv5k2,dungeonjay,5,Mon Jul 20 01:29:02 2015 UTC,It should be noted that the staff and the server owner are very friendly and professional. They communicate with the playerbase very well and take suggestions and criticism. I have no doubt that they will balance the classes in the near future. And i'm having a great time so far =P
wowservers,3dv5k2,TribTheHunt,3,Sun Jul 19 20:37:30 2015 UTC,There are a few issues with pathing but my major concern is class balance. Right now Warriors are so OP that the raids are stuffed with them. Still playing and liking it but I think some class tuning is needed to keep people interested.
wowservers,3dv5k2,rock8104,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:59:20 2015 UTC,Whats op about them? Is it a bug or just wotlk skills being too powerful?
wowservers,3dv5k2,Triface,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:43:42 2015 UTC,Revenge is op skill right now. It will balance out more in tbc but that's a few years away
wowservers,3dv5k2,rock8104,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:48:37 2015 UTC,"Revenge is as high as it is in every 3.3.5 server i think.   Fury dps is alright. The recent server first of ragnaros showed Fury warriors well below Hunters and Mages (as it would be expected in such a fight). On melee friendly fights they go toe-to-toe with rogues, provided they are specced correctly."
wowservers,3dv5k2,CallMeZau,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:39:07 2015 UTC,Good to hear. From what I was hearing they were well above all the other melee classes
wowservers,3dv5k2,rock8104,0,Mon Jul 20 10:49:15 2015 UTC,"There's also something else in favor or warriors: the spec is pretty much a cookie cutter just like it was in 1.12 vanilla. Whereas as a rogue (and the 3.3.5 reality of things) some people are still adapting their specs, trying diferent talent combinations and so on. There seems to be more talents worth picking up then talent points available, so people have to do some triage and try and pick the best out of them. It's a learning process, i guess.  That been said, i've seen raid logs here on Primal of rogues on par and ahead of equally geared fury warriors."
wowservers,3dv5k2,CallMeZau,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:24:43 2015 UTC,"Primal wow is a really interesting concept that was put together in a very lazy way. Most of the vanilla content is stock trinity core, which isn't bad but it definitely isn't good. The devs try to make fights harder on healers with debuffs but really this just makes fights take 2x as long and not actually any harder. Guilds have been stopped by gms that said they were progressing throug mc too quickly and forced to stop their raids. Really neat idea but the developers so far haven't done anything major besides take a wotlk core, restrict levels/zones/talents and add a healing debuff."

I'm having fun leveling my lock, and it's a great idea that's not really being properly executed.  The server has some bugs it shouldn't have for a live server, and the EMFH debacle has brought some light on the way that the devs are managing the WotLK balance to Vanilla content.  It seems like they have no idea what to do, and Prime itself said that EMFH was disabled because he didn't got much feedback on what to do with it.  Yet, the world chat is still pure cancer, with just 200players online. People who COULD be giving good feedback keep talking about rape and racism in a pserver that still suffers from population.

wowservers,3dv5k2,trmpah,0,Sun Jul 19 20:26:48 2015 UTC,Your thoughts are correct. FoL spam and shock for bursts. Use divine sacrifice for raid protection.  Having seal of wisdom makes me having infinite mana on most fights.

You're sounding exactly like those people who has ""dreams"" about starting up a server, with the illusion that they have the competence and game knowledge to create an actual good one. You're sounding exactly like those people whom put their generic half-assed stock projects powered by Fusion CMS, up on Ac-Web.  Also your blissful ignorance about development time is also common and hilarious. Put a team of lets say 5 competent developers, and proper work ethic in place and you'll have 110% perfection in a lot less than 5 years. You have to remember, CoreCraft has been in development for 3 and a half years, whilst Kronos and Nostalrius has had a half-assed development time for over 5 years and is still over 90% MaNGOS. So don't come to me with your bullshit about ""we all know how that will end up"". Because you clearly don't know anything about such matters, nor show any competence of any level that would make you appear as intelligent or knowledgable in the field.  By this I can already tell how ""great"" your Helios Empire will become and how short it will last. Do yourself a favor by not wasting your own and partner's time, aswell as the energy and effort of your team by trying to build something that is far beyond your comprehension and competence.

Drop rate and Reputation gain will be x1.  Idea behind a TBC realm was present for over a year now even during our previous (WotLK) project. Realm that we are preparing for release has been used as our personal playground.

The x2 xp rate is comparable to Excalibur(and it has it shares of leveling quest bugs), and I see that being acceptable if not every bugged quest is fixed.  A donation shop without gear is definitely a solid start in the right direction for playerbase.  If you have battlegrounds that do not lag out like on Excalibur then you have sold me on this being a server to at least look at.  Hopefully, your reception will be better than Vengeance had.

I'm also not in high school anymore and can't dedicate as much time as I used to.  Vanilla WoW private servers are weird because while there are a lot of people who started in WotLK or later and ask a lot of (noobish) questions, majority of them are people who did play Vanilla or other private servers and know the game very well.

As you know they are simple people who just have their own thoughts and not bound to a treaty where you have to make money and give proper content etc. I think the entire private server scene first of all came to existence because Blizzard removed content and people wanted to play it again. Then private servers will become a sign for Blizzard that there is a lot of people playing there and to make their game possible to play it the way people want not them.

Even those who don't like Nostalrius thinks he's a bit damaged in the head.  And you're fanboying hard too. Nost hasn't outsmarted anyone. Their earlier release is now biting them in the ass, as the AV debacle with banned players that used Lazypig to queue together and didn't even got an advertence first.  Nost forums is extremely tense, while twinstar's forums is a breeze.  I did expect people seeing Alex's moves as hurtful to Kronos reputation, but your response is more of a Nost fanboy than someone who simply doesn't get the guy."
wowservers,3duvwg,tvojidol,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:21:54 2015 UTC,"""Nost forums is extremely tense, while twinstar's forums is a breeze""  Part of the reason for this is having devs and gms, who acually know what they are doing and dont straight out lie and accuse other people for their personal fails."
wowservers,3duvwg,Ishouldjustdoit,2,Mon Jul 20 05:47:36 2015 UTC,"That i will agree. The AV thing is really enlightening for those who wanna see the inner workings of Nost. But i don't wish the server to fail, i want them to succeed whilke correcting these mistakes."

When a newcomer see his messages, he may trust his lies about other servers and may not come back to read the subreddit everyday. The only people he's upsetting are people who already know what to think about this. Stop thinking with your asshole.  Your argument is convincing although I knew completely some wannabe smartass would throw it and feel super awesome, but you would be very surprised at how stupid people are. And it's very possible that he's part of kronos.  I don't play Nostalrius nor Kronos. Nost outsmarted them, that's a fact, and you're blind to this. But you will understand it when you grow up."

I don't feel super awesome because i just rebutted an failed logic, it's something usual within my daily life. Nor am i surprised as how people are imbeciles, you're giving me a show right now.  I'm pretty grown up, thanks. What happened within Nost and Kronos was simply failed logistics: Two competing stores are prepping for release, one of them sees the power within opening first and does that, but the structure of the store is not ready for such.  Take a look at Nost forums: AV is fubar. BWL will release after Kronos ( unless they pull up the ""release first"" card, with everything broken ), players are leaving in droves, which, one could argue, wouldn't make a difference if you server has 4k+ players playing it, but like a Nost forum poster said: Mana tide totem doesn't break when 4k people log, nor do magically gets fixed with 3k.  They don't have the power to hold the population within their server, and the game itself is showing that to them.  But that's the main factor on fanboys: They actually believe whatever the fuck they smashed within the empty spaces inside they skull.  Have fun, i guess."

Secondly, be aware that sometimes servers have lower ping but more delay due to over population (nostalrius mostly)  I am from NZ and so I'm guessing my ping is similar if not worse than yours, but I find Primal Wow and Dalaran great, giving me around 200ms in non peak and 300-400 at peak. To be honest all servers should be giving you at most 400ms at the worst times and 150 at the best."

wowservers,3dskg4,iolheal,3,Sun Jul 19 03:08:30 2015 UTC,"Tbh 400 is the upper limit and doesn't occur that often, just thought I'd mention it in case. Dalaran wow is the best blizzlike wotlk server, primal wow is wotlk too but is progressing through vanilla and tbc content first and is a really unique server. Warmane is another wotlk option but it trades quality for population and is heavily pay to win. I currently play on Primal Wow and I have enjoyed it more than any other server thus far.  Search through the subreddit for more info, the stickied post with server details at the top is also pretty accurate."

wowservers,3dt0ex,choolete,3,Sun Jul 19 13:33:45 2015 UTC,I'm a computer science student who became interested in programming and development through World of Warcraft and the private servers ~6-7 years ago.   The project is about bringing something fresh to the emulation scene. Me and my friend are not here to make money nor are we here to establish a huge community but instead we're trying to develop something that sticks out from the ordinary private server. We want to establish a small dedicated and devoted community that simply enjoys the content that we're putting out. That is our goal and we hope we'll eventually reach it!   Thank you for showing your interest! :D

wowservers,3dsbu8,PenguinsAreAmazing,4,Sat Jul 18 23:58:49 2015 UTC,"Yes.  What version of wow do you want to play on?  You don't use the retail version to play on back versions of wow(example: Wrath 3.3.5a, TBC 2.4.3, etc.)  You play the version of wow at that release 2.4.3 copy or 3.3.5a copy.  To obtain those you have to browse around the private server scene and find the server you want to play on.  Usually, that server provides a link(torrent) to d/l the content to play that particular version of wow on their private server.    You also, always, keep a seperate folder for your private server's version from your retail version."
wowservers,3dsbu8,dungeonjay,2,Sun Jul 19 00:14:44 2015 UTC,"okay from the looks of it you are very new to this stuff  one does not simply 'install' a private server unless you're trying to make one. which is an entirely different ball-park then what I am about to tell you. if you want more information on that just ask  first off, decide which expansion you want to play. vanilla? TBC? wotlk? cataclysm? i recommend you do not play private servers for MoP/wod as they are still terribly buggy. you can get a client from thepiratebay the fastest, and your torrent client can be anything but I recommend picking up qbittorrent.  then you can look in the sidebar for server suggestions there, all of them are different.  to answer your 'no realmlist' question, Blizzard has indeed gotten rid of their realmlist in the past few years for newer expacs to slight private server owners. to play newer expacs on private servers you will need a modified wow.exe which is provided by private servers.  You cannot use a 6.2 client, the one provided by blizzard, to play on a private server that isn't hosting 6.2. to put it more simply, you will need to get a 3.3.5a client (wotlk) to play on a 3.3.5a server, and a 1.12.1 client to play on any 1.12.1 server (vanilla)."

wowservers,3dsbu8,Ambassador_Buta,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:15:19 2015 UTC,Yes. the patch of which the private server is hosting must be equal to the version of the client otherwise you will be unable to connect.

wowservers,3dr3if,AspiringgMage,0,Sun Jul 19 00:19:01 2015 UTC,I'd reccomend Primal-Wow. It uses a wotlk client but progressing starts from vanilla. The population grows every day and the server will be a long journey! :) (you can go and watch Dodgykebaabs review about it if you want)
wowservers,3drs1i,ineedaserver,3,Sat Jul 18 20:54:20 2015 UTC,Wotlk would be best for you as it's not as much as a grind which TBC and Vanilla was with the improved experience system.
wowservers,3drs1i,Air_chandler,2,Sat Jul 18 20:58:32 2015 UTC,"I recommend you try an increased xp server.  You spend 8 hours and you are max level and can start getting into the end game stuff.  I'd check out Warmane or Gamer-District since they have a bountiful amount of increased xp servers going on.  Or Feenix's Archangel for TBC.  In the end, the only grind you are doing is going back and leveling up your professions since it is a race.    Or if you have a few bucks lying around.  You can instant 70 on Excalibur or instant 70 on Dalaran.  Warmane offers  leveling for money as well."

wowservers,3drs1i,dungeonjay,2,Sun Jul 19 02:24:09 2015 UTC,"Well, I would say anything from WotLK to Warlords of Dreanoer is more casual than vanilla.

Excalibur, Feenix and Hellground have high/medium populations but they are all far along in their progression.  Vengeance should be opening Kara and starting progression in a couple of months but it has a very low population.  Between those you will need to consider which aspect is more important to you.  There is also the mythical beast that is Corecraft which might come out one day, but currently that seems to be fuelled more on peoples hopes and dreams rather than any tangible facts so I wouldn't count on it if I were you."

wowservers,3dpzbh,Air_chandler,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:41:25 2015 UTC,TBC is the ultimate progression in itself.  On Excalibur you still need to get decent blue gear from 68-70 dungeons before doing heroic farming and somewhere in there you get geared enough to slip into Karazhan and proceed.    Blizzard didn't make easy gear catch up mechanics until the emblem vendor disparity found in Wrath and the notoroius ICC regular dungeons and ToC.
wowservers,3dpzbh,dungeonjay,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:21:50 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about,  emblems as catch up mechanics started in tbc. What do you think BoJ are? You csn skip all of t4 and most of t5 if you just do MT and use badge gear. Excalibur even lets you farm BoJ in ZG and has 2x drop rates for them sometimes so its not really blizzlike progression."
wowservers,3dpzbh,justnotthathappy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:13:50 2015 UTC,"You go on any private server with Wrath ICC released and the progression is get a few pieces of pvp gear, buy a couple epics and grab a couple warm bodies and farm reg icc dungeons until you are heroic farming them.  Then, you go straight to ICC 10N and rep farm to ICC10N running it.  That is totally skipping content.  The amount of time it takes to gear up on excalibur far exceeds any of the fully released ICC servers we have.  That is what I'm talking about.    But, you are absolutely correct you run ZG for x2 BoJ but how much of that do you have to run and for how long before you can get a couple decent pieces?    They didn't fully utilize the catch-up method until they diversified the badges in wrath.  Look at all the different types?  That is when it truly converted to last patch easy gear up philosophy.  They didn't really have the casual outlook fully established in The Burning Crusade release and before we mention the blue drops in Vanilla that were OP'd I just want to say they really didn't know what they were doing then most of all.  They developed an easy catch up method through trial and error and simplified progression to the point of anyone dinging max level could jump in at a higher point then when the expansion first released."
wowservers,3dpzbh,dungeonjay,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:23:05 2015 UTC,"You can just run normals then heroics, farm badges and jump straight into t5.

wowservers,3dp8u7,TheEpicLazyTaco,0,Sat Jul 18 10:57:42 2015 UTC,A patch doesn't have to be 20000 gig to have custom maps and custom content in it. That mostly happens because the morons use and combine all the free patches they find and/or add random files that are not even being used by the client and some of them don't even compact the .mpq archive.

wowservers,3dp8u7,TheEpicLazyTaco,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:07:41 2015 UTC,Oh aggressive much? Ofc 20000 gigs was a exaggeration lol. I was merely stating the reason why patches are as big as they are on most custom servers. If done right a patch doesn't have to be big and the process of downloading and installing it doesn't have to be so much of a hassle. Its very easy to make a program to automate this and make the player only have to press 1-2 buttons. But if you ask me if a player wants to play on a custom server they should expect a patch. It does say custom after all and without modifying the clients files you cant do a lot of things like map edits or edit any of the client side dbc files.  The fact of the matter is the reason most patch based servers are not very popular is for 4 reasons. 1: Most players don't want a truly custom experience.  2: The players are morons and cant handle a simple task as downloading a archive file and putting it in a folder. 3: The servers don't do a great job of explaining or don't make a program to automate the process for the noobs. 4: The servers themselves suck to all hell and/or their patches are huge and 90% of the files are not even used on there server by the client.    That is the truth rather you agree or not.   As far as OP goes I say go for it. Its usually the small servers that are that usually have the best game play as far as custom is the topic. Personally I'm more intrigued about what a server makes then what the game play or community is like. Then again I'm a private server developer myself and i enjoy making them more then i do playing them anyway.   Anyway Good Luck OP!

Add some small random factor to AoE stuff, otherwise I could simply check targets location and spells location and if they match (with float values for a player it would never be possible to get the EXACT same position as target) just kick him.  Most no clip stuff can also be detected (atleast I can think of a simple fix for trees)."
wowservers,3donod,robinsch,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:59:42 2015 UTC,And how? Do you want to check every online players position and see if they are inside a non-reachable room? Its NOT possible to detect NoClip. Its pretty obvious that above suggested solution just wont work out.
wowservers,3donod,robinsch,2,Sun Jul 19 01:47:20 2015 UTC,"How? check oldPos and newPos then use the lovely G3d::Ray::fromOriginAndDirection then get the ""possible"" intersection time from the ray and kick player.

Well you could try to skip some movementpacket but if server devs are decent enough they check your movementpacket skip time.

For Wrath Dalran WoW is closer to what you describe, but I also hear GamerDistrict is good. For BC the best ATM is Excalibur with 2x rates, which truely isn't bad, they do have a cash shop however so if that's a turn off... might not be worth it to you. For Vanilla... It's a Toss up between Nostalrius and Kronos.. you will see people bashing them back and fourth and fanboying over one or the other.. But both are pretty solid honestly. There is also a new server Primal WoW, that I personally REALLY am enjoying... Quality server 1x rates, and it is running the wrath client, with Vanilla content server side, and is going to progress through Vanilla, then BC, then Wrath. So I LOVE the idea. Population there is kinda small right now, but there are always people to group with, so not too bad, and it is growing steadily and probably about to grow even more as they are part of TrueWOW (another wrath server) and are about to merge the websites and realmlist, which will bring in a good number of players I am sure.

I know the average BG queue is closer to 10 minutes sometimes because I play Alliance and there is a pretty steep Horde to Alliance ratio on Dalaran. I have never experienced a Dungeon queue of 30 minutes, but it can be quite long if you are not queuing for a random but rather trying to queue for a specific one."
wowservers,3dn1hs,ksharp25,2,Fri Jul 17 16:41:10 2015 UTC,"The best RDF leveling server hands down is Dalaran.  If you have a tank or a healer the que times will be shortened immensely.  Their population can hit peaks upward to 2k.  It is also a progressive raid server.  They have ToC about to be released.  Right now, the way they have it setup, you have to finish Naxx before Ulduar and etc.  This is a good link to understanding exactly what Dalaran is about.    http://www.dalaran-wow.com/forums/news-and-rules/news-and-announcements/topic/1111/algalon-how-the-progression-will-work"

wowservers,3dn1hs,dungeonjay,2,Fri Jul 17 21:52:59 2015 UTC,"Horde to Alliance is somewhere in the ballpark of 60/40.  Although, I've noticed a slow increase on Alliance side but the disparity is still over a 100+ people."

None of them, it's an entirely different team with the old leadership that made Molten successful.

You go in one thread and agree that bashing servers needs to stop and in this one you're making childish remarks of something you have no clue about. If you're going to be so hypocritical please stay away from reddit entirely.  It is apparent that you have never played AT.

wowservers,3dnvj6,huskymuffintop,-1,Fri Jul 17 22:18:39 2015 UTC,"It's you who hasn't played on AT for long enough. After they went with the failure that was the Cataclysm realm, the WotLK realm didn't get so much attention. Sanctified Retribution was broken for years. I don't even know if they got around fixing it before I left.  There are hundreds of bugs, even though they only have classes to fix. From pet damage range to cheat death formula to basic damage formulas to Sanctified Retribution to to aura rolling to stupid exploits like BoPing a warrior while he's Bladestorming. At least they fixed this last one. Ha..."

Also their WoTLK realm has the most attention right now with new systems coming out, incentives and such.  I admit that it's a bit late for them to realize that but they have. They even changed how soloq works in their last update + further innovation and changing the meta with new incentives to play which is showing population increase by a lot.   Blackrock (AT) has more players than ever and it's doing fine and writing a ""Ha"" comment reply to a post that says they have the best PvP is laughable, especially when in other threads you compared them to Kargath-WoW which is a basement repack project. That says a lot about your knowledge, but I will not argue, your words alone and your behaviour show what kind of a person you are."

They pay their developers more than what some servers make profit during the whole month (go check their forums) and have more developers than what some servers have entire staff of, have a bit of faith and you'll see what these people are capable."
wowservers,3dnvj6,huskymuffintop,3,Sat Jul 18 13:22:12 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda excited to see what kind of population it might bring.  They have said that the fixes on the Lordaeron server will transcend unto their other servers.  This can only be a win-win.  What a lot of people don't understand is Kaer may have stepped away and given up the reins back in the day but at that time Molten was the best polished Wrath server on the block.  Things change.  With the loss of Molten and the transformation of Warmane and Kaer back in the lead....they may again regain the most polished since they have such a massive payroll of developers.  Hopefully, Kaer has learned his lesson of stepping out of the driver seat.    One thing I don't doubt.  Kaer is a smart businessman and if he has focused attention on this project it will come to fruitation."

The economy is also very healthy and stable as there aren't a ton of people on, so prices are very low, even on epic gear in the auction house.   Reason I play here instead of atlantiss is due to having started here first; just don't have the drive to relevel  to 85 again.

wowservers,3dlce6,azureknightgx,2,Fri Jul 17 13:15:12 2015 UTC,He's referring of the removal of EMFH from humans and replacing it with the old perception. This imbalance basically means that horde are infinitely better at PvP.

If increased xp doesn't bother you then Gamer-District or Warmane are the next logical choices beyond Dalaran.

wowservers,3dkqqt,dungeonjay,2,Fri Jul 17 02:49:19 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't personally recommend Gamer's District if you don't like the 'pay-to-win' aspect of WoW-Mania, as you can also donate for max tier gear on GD. It also has some features which I don't prefer (transmog, teleports to anywhere basically, manual instance/raid ID resets, etc). Population is around 1.5k'ish at peak times, and is heavily EU favored as the population dips to as low as 200 at NA times.  I'd recommend Dalaran if you want the ""blizzlike"" experience. x1 rates, no donating for max-level gear, etc. Population (according to people on this sub) say it peaked at 2.1k this past Sunday. On days that aren't Sunday, 1.5-1.7k seems to be the normal. Only dips to around 500 at NA times which is a huge bonus for me as an NA player."

We know(since I play on Dalaran as well) that the pvp is lacking.    I wouldn't recommend Gamer-District either if he is NA.    I would recommend Warmane unless he wants a functioning Wintergrasp.  Then, that leaves Dalaran or Gamer and between the two Dalaran has the strongest NA following and he can still get some encounters in world pvp even if the battlegrounds aren't popping(with full capacity).  Depends on his playing timeframe.    So....if battlegrounds aren't a priority and you are looking for World pvp and a functioning Wintergrasp with a decent NA following...I fully recommend Dalaran.  :P  Confusing enough?"

wowservers,3dkju3,Rajron,3,Fri Jul 17 01:20:58 2015 UTC,"Vanilla - warrior. Honestly the only one of these classes that was remotely accepted at the time.  End game, feral druids and ret pallies were both marginal through most of TBC, but great in Wrath. Though feral ""rotations"" absolutely sucked at least their mobility included indoors in Wrath, making it easier to keep bleeds up. Ret pallies were always a stupidly simple playstyle.  Interesting leveling... warrior absolutely sucked to level in Vanilla, expect to eat/bandage after every mob unless you're doing green quests with great weapons. Worse than priests, who could at least wand and save their mana for heals. Pallies just autoattacked in Vanilla and TBC, druids were never bad and having both cat and bear made them quite fun to quest with... but none of these classes felt very powerful while leveling until Wrath."
wowservers,3dkju3,Nevermind04,3,Fri Jul 17 01:26:10 2015 UTC,"That's good I was hoping to be able to go with a warrior for vanilla, I do already have a druid at 16 on wrath so would be nice to be able to keep that, and I figured having TBC for the paladin could make it a bit less simple to play due to the higher challenge compared to wotlk (at least in leveling)  Primal WoW is a hybrid vanilla/wotlk server which means that warrior leveling won't be so tough (I hope) and will be more similar to wrath"

wowservers,3djynq,yolkol,2,Thu Jul 16 23:39:51 2015 UTC,"So your main sources of damage are going to come from abilities like overpower, rend, and auto swing. I highly suggest you find a slow main hand/shield and a 2 hand with high top end. Overpower and rend scale directly with weapon damage, so those stats are extremely important since you'll get things like crit artificially through imp overpower which will trigger another bleed (deep wounds).  You don't want to dual wield at lower levels since it incurs a 27% miss table on your white swings versus a 9% for your sword+board and 2h. To further avoid rolling on the miss table, you'll want to burn all your rage on thing like rend which creates a more dependable dot and overpower which is high in damage to rage ratio while also having high chances to proc deep wounds when talented.  Heroic strike isn't going to be an ability you use often at lower levels unless you are tanking 2+ mobs at once which would result in adequate rage gen."
wowservers,3djynq,Autismmprime,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:23:58 2015 UTC,go prot to level. revenge hits for a decent amount in TBC and costs almost no rage. And then devastate at 50 really helps out. It's less gear dependant and the spec functions better with low rage.
wowservers,3djynq,Craptola,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:06:14 2015 UTC,"I had the same issues leveling my warrior in TBC.. All these guys are right. Gear is a huge factor, so it is rough for a bit."

I think population-wise Warmane is  your best bet and they have high promises for their new realm. Other 2, good choices will be Dalaran WoW (well scripted endgame, a pop of about 1.3k, blizzlike rates) and Gamer-district (Overall well scripted, about the same population with a larger EU base and adjustable rates)."

Dodgy's review alone doubled the population and it has been steadily climbing since... ALSO they announced TrueWoW is who developed the server, so they are soon merging the websites and the realmlist which will also bring a huge increase of players I am sure. There server is only about 2 months old... The population will increase. And in the current state there are plenty of people to get the stuff done that you need to. Population won't be an issue for long. His goal is fun, and there are enough friendly guilds and people to accomplish this. He also has never played WoW so this would be a great place to start... so he can experience the content almost as it was in retail and play all the expansions... Worst case her tries... doesn't like it, and tries elsewhere. Not to mention recommendations are opinionated, they are not 100% you are going to love this server.

wowservers,3dia78,thewallofsleep,2,Thu Jul 16 14:23:13 2015 UTC,"From my experience, no and that goes for PVE and PVP. Gear does not magically make you a good player and yeah raiding guilds do exist and usually they don't look at gear from my past experience. They look for people who know what they are doing. At a certain point better gear is just extra numbers on a stat sheet but those extra numbers don't help you not stand in fire or not behind an ice tomb.  Also like I stated the same can be said for PVP. Back on the old lordaeron realm before they started arena seasons I was able to get into the top 5 2s spot just by actually coordinating with my partner when to use our cooldowns."
wowservers,3dia78,Swimjack,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:53:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  It's just kind of frustrating.  I was in a decent casual progression guild during retail Wrath and had cleared 10 man normal and most of 25 normal, as well as quite few heroic encounters for each.  Would have probably fully cleared 25 normal but we didn't have enough guildies for 25 and pugs would drop group after Saurfang, even if we were doing great.  When I want to join a 10 or 25 normal pug run on warmane but have a low gear score, I might as well forget.  Looks like I need to find a guild that raids NA times or buy at least a couple pieces of gear lol."
wowservers,3dia78,Swimjack,2,Thu Jul 16 15:01:31 2015 UTC,Which realm and which faction? I might be able to help point you in the right direction when it comes to that.

A lot of people think GearScore is some holy thing that makes them better than anyone else.  But that's besides the point, from your comments history I can see you play Dalaran-WoW, what's the point of the thread then? :/   If not, post in the recruitment section of realms sub-forums and there's plenty of guilds that will pick you up and help you along the way."

The gearscore requirements plus (All BoE reserverd, All Plate Reserved, etc.) that you see is ridiculous when they are forming.

After wasting my time on Molten I'd rather not gear up again only to find there's nothing but pugs of the same 2-3 unscripted runs, full of MLG bullshit.  Why are you requiring better gear than the instance drops?"
wowservers,3dia78,Rajron,2,Thu Jul 16 19:18:23 2015 UTC,"It is solid.  You even have progression guilds, casual(gear up) or serious raiding guilds and in different languages(if English isn't your primary).  Most of the better guilds require you to access the forum and see if your class fits what they are looking for.  But, I would say there are more raiding guilds than pvp guilds."

wowservers,3dham9,only777,-1,Thu Jul 16 14:23:33 2015 UTC,"It is just I would stay away from dodgey kebaab style of review, if you look at his Molten MoP review it ends at something like level 30.  Doesn't even touch any MoP content what a bad bad review.  He never even enters pandaria so how can you call it a MoP review?   85-90 had about 80% of the quests missing and many quests broken and released with 0 dungeons open at 90 and only one rep vender working and 50% of the rep quests were broken as well.   Non of that was even mentioned in his review, I could go on about pretty much all of his reviews, although I do enjoy them as entertainment they always get a thumbs up from me because they are funny but they are certainly not good reviews from a content stand point. 10/10 entertainment 4/10 actually review quality.  Going for a journey type review is fine but I still think you need to touch on all those category's I mentioned and do a full/complete review."
wowservers,3dham9,IIIIIIIIIIlIl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:59:17 2015 UTC,"Oh come on, you picked the only review where I wasn't even allowed on the server and had to operate in secret.  And what would of it even achieved if I had got to lvl 90?  Nothing, that's what.  The end result would have still been the same.  Also the idea of a 'complete' review is subjective.  A review is nothing more than someone opinion.  Your idea of a full review is different to someone else.  What's a full review?  Every quest?  Every race?  Every class?  Every Dungeon?  Every Raid?  All these things?  Sure, I'll cover all these.  Next video will be out in 2019 (in time for Corecraft!)"
wowservers,3dham9,only777,0,Thu Jul 16 17:07:25 2015 UTC,"Actually if you go and rewatch your WoW circle review that is in a decent format I don't know why you switched from that.  When I say a full review I mean actually look at the content for the expansion, for a WOTLK server cover northrend ect.  Even in your Pandashan sever review YOU STILL didn't even cover Pandaria itself you are reviewing things like Darkmoon fair lol?? and low level dungeons and quests are."
wowservers,3dham9,annul,0,Thu Jul 16 17:47:21 2015 UTC,"Other reviews that covered at least the same amount as the WoW Circle video:  Primal WoW Warmane: Cata Kronos Gamer District Valkyrie Atlantiss True WoW WoW Reach Excalibur Molten: Cata Dalaran (including both parts) Molten WoW: WOTLK  So for the previous point about content, if you thought WoW Circle was good, bare in mind that all these videos covered more.  As for this point your making about format and how I made it in WoW Circle, there was a big difference between WoW Circle and every other server.  that difference is location.  Normally it's pointless to cover ping times as everyone lives in different places so my ping is useless information.  WoW Circle being Russian and so far away, I thought it was a valid point.    Lot's of the information in the video actually relates to the server not being european and not normally points worth talking about (like text types, communication, etc).  So many of the points related to the server not being European and just wouldn't fit into my journey format.  I had to section the review up only for this reason, plus the sections worked out because the breaks were made to look like Cold War propaganda posters so it fitted very well with the video theme.  But if I was to do this everytime, it would get boring very quickly.  i don't enjoy making lists of what works.  if people want that then each server has a list of fixes and improvments.  For me WoW is a journey, not a destination; and as such my videos reflect that.  The videos unfold in the same way the server in question unfolded as I played it.  Also worth noting is that I pace the videos in the same way, with the highs and lows happening at the same points they happened to me."

If it takes a team of devs to make a legacy server and they are working on that instead of Current content that just takes away content from the majority of players that want to play new content rather than older content.   Also Blizzard feels like most players would see it as a novel thing. where people would join the legacy server, play around abit and then get bored because its a huge time commitment to Level 1-60/70/80 without all the quality of life improvements made in the later xpacs, mounts and gear they worked years for, and possibly friends theyd be leaving.

wowservers,3df0gu,Neronja,2,Wed Jul 15 20:45:46 2015 UTC,"I once played on a woltk server that when you create a char it would be instant 80 with max gear, so basically everyone had the max gear for their class and was only skill pvp."
wowservers,3df0gu,dungeonjay,3,Wed Jul 15 20:01:07 2015 UTC,That exists now on Warmane's Blackrock.
wowservers,3df0gu,dungeonjay,2,Wed Jul 15 20:23:36 2015 UTC,"My idea for the Cata server was that it would be instant 85 but not with instant best gear, just so that players would do the custom PvE content."
wowservers,3df0gu,biffsteken,2,Wed Jul 15 20:18:29 2015 UTC,"There already is one sorta like that....Mortal Cata.  It has instant 85 beginning tier gear....1v1 duels, pve(some custom) and pvp."
wowservers,3df0gu,dungeonjay,2,Wed Jul 15 20:24:25 2015 UTC,"Custom content is not popular at all in the private server community, at least not what I've heard. And I dislike it pretty much aswell."

wowservers,3df0gu,dungeonjay,3,Wed Jul 15 21:01:06 2015 UTC,"The vanilla server is kinda a mute point at this time.  You have big dogs laying the gauntlet down and gobbling up all the population.  The custom content Cata server is starting to pop up all over the place at this point.      Honestly, a server like Gamer-District with interchangable xp rate between 1-7x, with that same super scripting and no P2W shop and progression like Dalaran with having to complete tiers.  PVP sets interchange between seasons.  Leave the Gamer-District transmog and portal.  That is my cherry pie right there."
wowservers,3df0gu,dungeonjay,2,Wed Jul 15 20:26:19 2015 UTC,"I know it is not smart to open up a server at the moment with so many people quitting WoW due to WoD and big names coming up at the same time. That is why I want to stand out in a way. I am just not sure how to. If I open up a server, I do not expect it to be a huge success, I don't expect it to be a success at all, more like a small project I can dive into and maybe, just maybe have a few people enjoy a server of my own."
wowservers,3df0gu,dungeonjay,2,Wed Jul 15 20:34:09 2015 UTC,"Then you should open up a server that you, as a player, would enjoy playing in. There's no meaning in tailoring a server for the ""biggest potential population"" if you don't enjoy what you do. Even if there are one hundred servers of one same type, there's always space for more."
wowservers,3df0gu,dungeonjay,2,Wed Jul 15 20:43:32 2015 UTC,Yeah.  If it is just for you and friends I agree.  You can grab a Cata custom repack that needs hardly any work for that and just enjoy it.
wowservers,3df0gu,FrozenZombiez,2,Wed Jul 15 20:49:56 2015 UTC,"I am just afraid that most players will not like the same kind of content as I do. The whole thing for me is to make a server that others can enjoy, just so that I have something I can devote a part of my time to. The Cata server for example would most likely not be appealing to players since Cata was extremely hated and custom content is heavily disliked too."
wowservers,3df0gu,cakesandale,2,Wed Jul 15 20:53:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hear you.  That is why I write short stories.  Not really for me but for others to enjoy.  As far as the Cata expansion goes.  I don't think it is so much a dislike of appeal but a distain to so much being broken.  There is just now a couple servers getting into what some would call, ""decently scripted"".  Mortal cata is a very active instant 85 server.  You may want to dip into there sometime and see what is going on and what makes it have around 350+ actives at peak(for instant thats not bad).  It could give you some good ideas on what is good and give you some ideas where you could imrpove that situation(if you were in the driver's seat)."
wowservers,3df0gu,emenems,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:00:48 2015 UTC,"You said you weren't really a scripter.  The Wrath repacks are almost so complete that they are an open gateway for someone to take up as a hobby and start tinkering with.  You can do everything I said...get a repack for portals in major cities/transmog.  A few editing lines and you have the increased xp.  Setting up tier blocking.  The hardest is probably the most fundamental though....raiding and getting the scripts up to blizzard standards like Dalaran.  That is where you might want to invest in a programmer.  You can then do a vote shop/vanity shop(donor) to help support the endeavor and go to town.     I think there is a market for this....really I do.    Also, you might want to take Truewow's direction on low population and do cross-faction random dungeon finders and such until the population is high enough to sustain that without the feature.  This isn't 100% needed but it definitely helps the transition on population in the beginning."
wowservers,3df0gu,notgunnahappen,2,Wed Jul 15 20:43:28 2015 UTC,"I am truly thankful for your feedback. I believe Vanilla repacks are pretty much in a same state with the WotLK ones, I just need to know which one appeals to a bigger audience. I personally prefer Vanilla just for the nostalgia, but WotLK is still a lot better as a game."
wowservers,3df0gu,Thundercats_Hoooo,2,Wed Jul 15 20:50:56 2015 UTC,"Definately go with your gut on this.  The thing about Vanilla is the core.  Hard to work with.  But, if a few broken quests and some pathing issues don't faze you I say go in this direction and see what happens.  In the end, the choice of decision is for you.  Are you appealing to yourself or to the private server sector.  If it is just you.  I say do what you want :p"
wowservers,3df0gu,Thundercats_Hoooo,2,Wed Jul 15 20:54:07 2015 UTC,"My dream server is an east coast located blizzlike vanilla server (the double xp weekends sound awesome and a nice incentive to play on the weekends, but you should probably think of some incentive for raiders as well for the weekends). My main priorities are low latency, high enough pop for at least a couple 40 man teams for competition sake and very little bugs (outside of what bugs existed in vanilla during its time)."
wowservers,3df0gu,SandMan560,2,Wed Jul 15 20:21:24 2015 UTC,The population will most likely be the biggest problem since there are plenty of other better known servers out there. It will most likely take a long time before the population can grow. The double exp thingy was only one of the things I had in mind. Others are having better chances to get epics and rares and boosted gold drops for a certain period.

wowservers,3dgo8j,_just_a_fox_bat,2,Thu Jul 16 03:10:38 2015 UTC,The best part of Dalaran is that there will always be interest in running Naxx because of the raid progression structure they have setup.  You level to 80 and you will have to do Naxx before Ulduar.  As long as fresh 80s are entering the game then this will continue.

But it's really nice to see they did away with that here, I'm playing on a private server to relive the entire expansion, would have sucked to have to skip naxx."

Talent trees are locked at 31 points so a lot of the most important talents are unavailable (no Beacon of Light, no Tree of Life, no Circle of Healing, no Devastate, etc. And resto druids are fucked over due to the uneven nerfing of heals. On the other hand, PW:Shield is decent because it isn't nerfed at all, but there's no mana return or extra scaling from talents. Resto shamans have no Earth Shield or Riptide, but that's horde only. Pallies are in the same boat they were in real Vanilla - spamming FoL or going OOM.

About pvp they also said the server is focused on PVE and bgs are rare even at 80, but that was like a 1 year ago or something.  They're definitely not doing good job on advertising it, maybe they're not doing that at all :P Still, I got even more interested now since I'm looking for 1x server without p2w myself and 1.5 - 2k players sounds really good, might give it a try."
wowservers,3deabe,dungeonjay,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:34:49 2015 UTC,It is definitely growing.  I don't know if the pvp will ever pan out right on that server because of it being a x1.  Too many people leveling and what-not.  If it hits above 2k peaks I think it might.  Just it has a level barrier stopping it.    Just remember when you log on if you do a /who it only shows the faction side total population.  Confuses some people when they first join.
wowservers,3deabe,Swimjack,0,Wed Jul 15 19:48:11 2015 UTC,"Warmane basically fits your description to a T and if what they are promising with lordaeron's more updated core is true then you will not see any game stopping bugs plus everything major and almost everything minor will be scripted, that will likely be ported to the other two realms also once they probably proved that lordaeron is stable so that's nice to hear. I'd say dalaran-wow but they don't even have ToC out yet for the public, and you will most likely have to wait patiently for awhile for them to actually get ICC out which kinda stinks. There is also gamer-district but I don't really know much about them spare that they are famous for pay 2 win features."
wowservers,3deabe,dungeonjay,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:14:20 2015 UTC,"Dalaran is a progressive raiding server?  They are just now releasing ToC....they also have it setup in tiers where you have to finish Naxx to Ulduar.  It isn't like Warmane where ICC is the top released and only ICC and sometimes ToC is farmed endlessly.  Even when Dalaran gets to ICC there will be people looking to do Naxx or Ulduar or ToC based on tier goals.    Gamer-District is the best overall quality scripted server.  They are basically Warmane except if it had Wintergrasp released and fully functional with almost all questlines intact.  Also, they have added some neat make life easier features like portals and transmog that the Mane doesn't have.  Just they suffer from poor NA population.    Everything you said about what is happening with Warmane is spot-on.  If they get this Lordaeron thing going it will be definitely something to consider on the x1 bracket.  We will just have to wait and see."

wowservers,3de3z9,jetsfan07,4,Wed Jul 15 16:43:56 2015 UTC,"The way some talents got swapped around the trees during Vanilla>Wotlk, now provides for some metagame changes and im sure people are still trying to adapt to that and find that suits them better in terms of gameplay.  Warriors are without any doubt the most represented class atm, but there's also others that may see more love from the playerbase.  Players looking for PvP (Bg's / Arenas) may look at Rogues and Warlocks as they may be slightly stronger in PvP then they were back in vanilla, due to talents like Vigor and Soul Link being earlier in their talent trees and thus available to specs like Sub w/ Vigor or Affliction w/ SoulLink. Other classes that benefict from these wotlk updated talent trees: Feral Druids (Naturalism talent providing 10% extra damage), Shamans have Water Shield to name a couple.  On the bad side of the coin, paladin's reckoning nerfed version compared to the old reck bombs from 1.12 (or even the old Seal of Command) may turn players away from Paladins if they look for damage. Their tanking and healing still compares (or may be even better) to what it was in vanilla.  All in all, I find that these wotlk updated talent/spells in a vanilla environment provide for some spiciness to a game that for long had got me bored."

wowservers,3dcf53,Delrasha,4,Wed Jul 15 04:27:37 2015 UTC,"I'm sure a portion of Nosts population could be attributed to the dislike of any kind of donation rewards (even though it's adversary simply provides nothing but aesthetic bonuses for donating, like real WoW)...but the most glaringly obvious reason is simply because they released a whole month before Kronos conspicuously around the time Kronos announced its one month until release clock.  It's highly probable this was one of the smartest moves the Nostalrius team could have made, as despite their low-grade attempts to run a high-functioning quality server they still manage to retain a lot of that population in the face of an extremely low quality experience for their players (in terms of dev communication and server quality).  People would probably rather just quit and move on than reroll at this point even if they were unhappy with Nostalrius, it's a pretty big bummer. Those players deserve better."

wowservers,3dcf53,dungeonjay,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:36:11 2015 UTC,"I like subscription models way more than F2P.  For me in a subscription based game, there should be absolutely NO way to pay for additional services or cosmetic items.  Everything should be available by playing the game.  Your value of the subscription fee is based off of how much time and effort you actually put into the game.  Playing more gets you more value.  Playing less gets you less value, but you never feel cheated.  It is up to you to make those kinds of decisions.  If you don't get that sexy mount, that was your fault.  It isn't because you didn't shell out $25 extra dollars on top of your sub, it is because you didn't put in the extra effort to get it and excel at the game.    Private servers are different.  You can't charge a sub fee.  I still donate to Nostalrius because they have given me the best experience so far and I want to keep having fun on their server.  I'm not donating a lot, maybe $5 here and there, but I still think it makes a difference."

wowservers,3dcf53,biffsteken,-1,Wed Jul 15 21:13:21 2015 UTC,"P2W and voting rewards have never held a server back in terms of player numbers. Literally NEVER. Just look at the all the servers who have it and are high on voting sites. They have more people coming in constantly, people who then keep voting (for rewards) and donating - they most likely have never played WoW before and just wanna shit on some people in PvP.  The thing is, there hasn't been a single server that offered high gameplay quality but also did this. So you see people flocking to scarcely populated servers with well scripted content and x1 rates and you see servers with 2k+ online (Excalibur) completely broken and p2w.  If someone combined those 2 options, you would still see everyone flocking to that server, because with population and quality, almost everyone is easily willing to look past the p2w crap. Which hardly affects the gameplay on a WELL FUNCTIONING server anyway, given that you can't buy legendaries and absolutely top tier gear, just some entry level stuff."
wowservers,3dcf53,schaka,2,Wed Jul 15 07:14:50 2015 UTC,"You're not necessarily wrong, don't know where the down-votes are coming from.    Many of the big P2W servers maintain their position by poaching developers and throwing their weight behind marketing, not necessarily by the quality of the experience they provide.  For a lot of players, a fancy youtube channel/website and high rankings on the voting websites is a bigger pull than the quality of the scripting/code.  Not to mention that they will be generally generating much more revenue, allowing stronger server hardware/better DDOS protection, and generally a higher motivation to continue what they are doing.  (Your developers will probably be more loyal if they are paid). A lot of projects that started off non-p2w seem to have ran out of steam, with the developers just giving up or running of with a final donation drive worth of funds (Scriptcraft/rebirth etc).  They also do attract a fair number of players who just want to skip the grind and destroy people/raids with top-end gear etc.  I don't think this is a good thing but it is a fact of life of private servers.  Smaller servers have a high turnover rate and many people are not prepared to invest in a server that may fold a few months down the line. As a consequence the whole circle of private server life is a bit of a paradox, people hate/trash talk on the big servers they play on, but don't want to take a leap of faith and invest in newer, smaller servers, hence they find themselves drifting back to their familiar environments."

The owner of Truewow opened this server, for some(i don't know who) this is a surprise.  Truewow's developers wanted to test this server out before committing anything to it and see if people were interested.  It appears there is.  So, Truewow will focus on fixing their vanilla dungeons/raids on Primal and transferring over their fixes to the Truewow realm in the process(along with quests, etc.).  It is really a win-win.

The items we currently have in the store is: Gold, Character rename/Customization/Reset talent points, Mounts and a 1 time boost from your current level to 80.   All of these items can be purchased with voting points, you are never required to spend money if you want to use the item store. However, if you do not wish to spend your time voting you can make a purchase using real money. We are not 100% sure of keeping all these things in the store (Gold & Level 80).

wowservers,3da5k0,KnaxxLive,3,Tue Jul 14 19:08:47 2015 UTC,"I play on Nostalrius.  However, there are advantages and disadvantages to both good servers, Nost and Kronos.  The main is population.    Nostalrius has a super large population.  This makes it sometimes harder to find/kill quest items/mobs.  It also yields wPvP and these issues both slow down the already large time it takes to level.  The quest mobs/items becomes a smaller issue as you level up, where the wPvP issue goes up with more contested territory.  However, you can find a group to do anything in 5-10 minutes, no problem what-so-ever.  Elite quests? No problem.  Dungeons? You'll have a group in 5 minutes.  Kronos has a smaller population so these issues are nearly opposite to Nost.  There is little slow down in leveling because of items/mobs being dead all the time, so you will be able to do more while playing the same amount of time.  However, you lose out on the benefits of a larger playerbase like quick groups for elite quests and dungeons.  This is not always present.  You will eventually find dungeon groups, but group quests could be hit or miss.  Not being able to do these is a non-issue since there are so many other quests and things to do.  I chose Nost because of it's huge population.  I really don't mind taking over a month or so just to level up to 60.  I frequently participate in wPvP and group quests even though it isn't necessary.  Every zone is full of people and they feel alive.  Seeing that many people brings a smile to my face and I enjoy ganking OOM mana users and then having them gank me when I get crowded with 2+ mobs.  However, it is up to you to make that decision based on your preferences.  Each of the two servers has their fair share of bugs so I can't comment on them in those respects.  A side comment is that even though Kronos has a smaller player base, they are more on par with what a medium or medium-high population would have been in Vanilla WoW."

wowservers,3da5k0,alexhjelm,-1,Tue Jul 14 20:15:12 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind on Nostalrius, is that due to the extreme population, they have made render/draw distance very very low.  This results in you not seeing another player until you are almost right in front of them.  They just fade in out of nowhere.  I find this really destroyed my immersion.  It also has gameplay effects, as you'll be going for a node or mob and won't realize another player is closer until it's too late."

wowservers,3dbozi,huskymuffintop,-1,Thu Jul 16 01:24:39 2015 UTC,"Well, I can only speak for Dalaran-WoW server where I have been playing for more than a year. Every raid is released on an almost perfect state AND pre-nerf status, which means an extra challenge. There is a huge work on the pre-nerf from part of dalaran devs. So yes, all I can say is ICC is going to be without the 30% buff/nerf on dalaran."

From the random hate and trolling I received from just simply playing Primal WoW, sometimes I wonder if there is any mature players.

wowservers,3d9exy,Driver969,2,Tue Jul 14 19:30:44 2015 UTC,"Definately high schoolers and college students.   As a young twenty year old without kids, I myself can't even play the game barely with a 8-5 job. Get home at 5:30, take a shower it's 6. Time to make dinner / eat dinner. Then it's 7, by that time grinding ore/running through quests just seems like too much work. Also I sit in a chair all day over a keyboard and a mouse, so the prospect of more of that just makes me want to barf.   I watched a streamer farm ore for hours ( I didn't watch him do it for hours, but I skipped around and saw he had been) and it just made me not want to play the game, since any version before WOD does have a lot of grinding if you want to be good/have mounts/good gear etc. Sure you can play MMORPGS casually, but it's very easy to feel like you're slipping behind the crowd, not playing as much as you should, or like you aren't well suited to the game because of your play style.   In many ways, MMORPGS remind me of survival games like Rust. But instead of being killed while you are logged off, you fall behind the gear tread mill and you can't access the same content your friends/guild might be working towards while you were gone.   Like a lot of people, I think I'm more inclined towards shorter PVP sessions--like Rocket League, which I love / hate for different reasons. I love the satisfaction from winning battles, but I also hate the same competitive aspects as well because of the bad community that exists in most PVP oriented games (League of Legends, Dota, etc).   That's one satisfying thing about MMORPGS is that you can work alongside other players to accomplish goals. I never raided much, but questing together can be quite awesome. Only thing is, that doesnt happen in most MMORPGS. Thankfully it does happen in vanilla wow, since it's harder, but again this requires a lot more time invested. Players group together because quests can be tedious alone. There's definately a trade-off and I'd be interested to hear others thoughts about a good balance between difficulty, time to grind, and how group questing / cooperation can be encouraged in MMORPGS.   I think there is still room to be filled alongside games like Minecraft, which provide ample ways for players to cooperate instead of kill/beat each other.   Controller / couch play is also great for after-work sessions. While I often do miss the long-term rewards and satisfaction from playing a MMORPG, I don't miss the time invested."

Keybind CDs and snares and stuff on your naga. I also used shift+naga buttons for more keybinds.   I remember getting use to all the keys took a few days and i didn't like it at first.

The pvp scene is lackluster and as the population increases I'm sure this will eventually pan its way out.  They are in the process of releasing ToC.  If you want to experience every raid in Wrath this would be the server I would pick.  They do have some bugs and broken quests.  You need to be aware of this going in.  Also, has a fairly decent NA population allowing for raiding to take place almost any time of day.  Gamer-District probably has the best polished overall scripting experience I have seen of any of the Wrath servers out there now or in the past.  Their raid scripting is a little-off Dalaran's level but everything else is spot on.  They are an increased xp server with ICC released.  This is primarily a ToC/ICC farm pve server.  They do have extensive arena and pvp going on during EU peak times.  Has a low NA population and struggles to find activity into the wee little hours of the night.  Warmane.  Population explosion for a wrath server(they have two and a third on the way).  They have decent scripting throughout and the raids are scripted decently as well.  Does not have the spit and shine of the other two servers but makes up for it with having usually 500-750+ more people on either of their two servers and a higher NA population then both allowing for Raiding and PVP at any time of the day.  This, like Gamer, is a ToC/ICC farm pve server.    Those are your choices.  I've tried them all.....I play on them all.  :p  What more can I say."

GD also offers the ability to donate for gear, which I'm not  a fan of. These things may not be issues to you, and you'll need to decide which you prefer. Dalaran also has a unique style of progressive raiding, which has it so that you must finish Naxx before moving on to Ulduar, and Ulduar before moving on to ToC (which is not yet released). Dalaran also has a recruit a friend program similar to Blizzard's if you have a buddy to play with. The scripting quality is very good on both servers. There is also Warmane, however I'd avoid if I were you unless high population is a necessity to you. The scripting quality on that server is far below the other 2 mentioned."

Dalaran (Algalon, Kirin Tor realm is dead): x1 everything Blizzlike raids, Ulduar runs, eternal progressive server, best scripting out of the three, I'd recommend this one if you don't mind x1 leveling or paying $20 for instant level 70."

True-wow doesn't peaks around 700 people total now and drops off fairly quickly into the NA evenings hovering around 100-150. Dalaran, has a 2k peak population.  A larger NA population.  However, when you log in and do a /who it will only show a total for the side you are playing on(confusing to some).  If you log on both sides and add them together you will get a population total.  However, I say it chugs along pretty strong into the NA night-time with around 500-700 people.    As far as a true retail server.  Who knows if it will ever exist.  These are private servers and they are what they are.  Dalaran will offer Wintergrasp which Truewow doesn't have, adding to the experience.

wowservers,3d4kfv,SunRiseFromHell,3,Mon Jul 13 14:29:31 2015 UTC,"Check out Rebirth (Vanilla) if you want great scripting. The community is rather small though (but great). If you prefer population, go for Nost.  TBC, check out Excalibur-wow (2x, mostly euros), I honestly, sincerely do not think that Corecraft will be such a golden god when it comes around, they already have stated it will be insta-58 because they can't afford the time to fix quests in azeroth.  Dalaran wow is excellent for Wrath, probably the cleanest server i've been on."

If you look at the forums, you're going to see continuos complaints about lag or overpopulation. Personally, I haven't experienced the delay that some are talking about. As a U.S. Player I maintain 120-130ms without delay both in the afternoon during peak hours and in the evening when the population is lower.  The population is large, especially for a vanilla server.  This causes some issues with leveling as things are crowded, especially if you're used to retail leveling where the re spawn rates are near-instant and you never have to wait. Nostalrius' population means leveling is more of a challenge, and I believe that is a good thing. Yes, you might have to wait 10 minutes for your quest mob to respawn and fight people for tags. It's an MMO, which means there are other people and on Nostalrius, there is plenty of other people.  There are bugs, like any private server, but I've found fixes to be accurate and pretty quick."

I don't know how much faith I have in warmane projects either, but it might be worth just waiting for lordaeron to come out so you can start on even terms with everyone else. Right now the dalaran auction house is abysmal (often 100g+ for level 10 items) and bugs with the midsummers event allow you to farm infinite gold by creating level 1s and running them to your main city for 20g every 5 minutes or so. There are also caves in which over 20 ore nodes spawn every 5 minutes making mining a complete joke to level. I don't know if this was normal in wotlk or if the server just has node spawns set way too high, but I never had such an easy time with mining as on this server.  Also, dalaran is not p2w but they do have the option to pay for instant 70 + 900g. This is kind of a turn off for me, but I know a lot of people like that option. So really either jump on dalaran or wait for lordaeron, but those will be the highest populated 1x English speaking wotlk servers I'm sure."

wowservers,3d4soo,KnaxxLive,0,Mon Jul 13 17:54:42 2015 UTC,"At this point I'm doubting this assessment unless they give Nostalrius time for it to run its course.  Nost has gobbled up most of the Corecraft player base.  And, I tell you this now, they will be hesitant to abandon ship for Corecraft.  You may have some Excab travelers in this mix but I doubt seriously that it will be anything more than a 2k sustained population in the beginning.  And that is if it is released.  As people get tired of Vanilla content, they will trickle their way to Corecraft and that will only be if Nostalrius doesn't grab the bandwagon express and open their TBC server with free character transfer from their population playerbase.   Right now is a pivotal time for Corecraft and unfortunately they hyped their ""perfect"" experience a little early in my books and are paying for it.  Should have time released it closer to launch(whenever that is going to be.)"
wowservers,3d4soo,dungeonjay,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:02:12 2015 UTC,Isn't that the same server that nerfed a certain Hunter ability after the community whined about it on an 10 years old game? Are you comparing it with Corecraft?
wowservers,3d4soo,Estheliel,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:03:22 2015 UTC,"Which server?  If you are talking about Nostalrius they have a massive amount of people that were waiting on Corecraft playing there now.  If you are talking about Excalibur, I know there are a few waiting on Corecraft's release....     I haven't compared anything.  I stated the fact that Nostalrius has a lot of Corecraft player base that will be hard to move since of the time they have invested in their characters there.  And, knowing Nostalrius, they will see Corecraft moving to launch and counter with their own very similar to how they did it to Kronos.... a ""month"" earlier.  I wouldn't be surprised if Nostalrius isn't working on a TBC server behind the scenes right now.    All this is speculation, but it is speculation built upon previous knowledge.  Which leads to the term, ""educated guess""."
wowservers,3d4soo,dungeonjay,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:28:19 2015 UTC,I believe Corecraft are disabling/nerfing Seal Twisting though right?  If so then both servers are effectively making custom balance changes for the sake of the game (although paladins really do need seal-twisting to do viable dps)
wowservers,3d4soo,Iwasapirateonce,2,Mon Jul 13 22:31:25 2015 UTC,"The problem with Seal Twisting is that it was flagged as a bug by Blizzard. I would say that's a fix, not custom-change though I get where you're coming from."
wowservers,3d4soo,Estheliel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:10:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah I do understand that Blizzard flagged it as a bug, but honestly, if seal twisting is removed, then totem twisting should properly also be removed.

I had issues when gearing up as well, had to go through the longer route of reputations -> (non-FoS/PoS/HoR/ToC) HC dungeons -> FoS/PoS/HoR, and then this weird gap between being FoS/PoS/HoR geared and ICC. At least without using Underachiever, it was hard to get into ICC pugs.  What I can advice is, either forget pugs, and look more into Guilds/friends you have that host raids, or go for 'ICC equivalent' stuff by farming EoTs as much as you can to get 245 ilevel pieces, EoF from daily dungeon/weekly quest/FoS-HoR chain quest. Get Quel'Dalar, the chain quest works! You're able to get into those pugs without ever being carried (if we ignore silly achievement requirements at least), but takes time."

Best bet is finding a guild/forming one with the friends that you are playing with and progress that way. This is how it is on all of the ICC progressed servers anyhow.  I don't play enough on Dalaran to really say for certain if the same applies, but as I've been leveling, I can't recall many asking for GS, only to meet up somewhere so they can inspect you (or to link achievement)."

But for the rest only good players knowing the tactics with the average or normal gear. E.g, Obsidian Sanctum with 3 drakes (which, allow me to say, its perfectly scripted :P, props to the devs), is not a piece of cake and you might need a raid with full naxxramas gear."

That would probably be the best step.  The gearscore needed on GD is actually lower than the gearscore I see being shouted on Warmane's x7 Wrath by usually .2-.4k. On Warmane, Isuckbigballs: LF 2 DPS for ToC 25M Heroic.  Need at least 5.5k and link achievment(reserved all BoE).  And that is ToC..... I mean not even ICC..... WTF?  But I see similar on GD so not saying they both don't have this.  Really it is just rampant everywhere.

Obviously before the feature was implemented servers tended to have more active/open communities.  Does the convenience offered out-way the possible damage to the server community/world vibrancy/world pvp outside dungeons etc?  Do you still find a lot of people outside in the world or do people tend to stick to the cities like in wotlk and later expansions?

RDF works pretty good except you do have people dropping group if they get something they didn't want a lot.

wowservers,3d1lwm,FadedOkay,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:31:41 2015 UTC,"considering the fairly small population of the server and the fact that there is no cross-server grouping, it is more of a convenience in terms of travel and there is little negative impact on the community. If you are leveling up using the LFG feature you're probably going to run dungeons with the same people many times. This gives you the opportunity to establish a better community than just solo questing.   The biggest problem of LFG on retail was that you would get random players who you would never have to interact with again, so they would end up sucking, afking through, etc. with no consequence since you had no further interaction with them. Since everyone you interact with even through the LFG tool is on the same server and must participate in the single community it works very well."
wowservers,3d1lwm,slapdashbr,2,Mon Jul 13 13:25:07 2015 UTC,"As someone that has never played WoW (at least pass level 30+) this seems a really interesting project to jump into, in order to experience the game as it was ""intended"", i.e., going through each expansion at a relatively slow pace.  Don't you agree with this?"
wowservers,3d1lwm,petersaints,3,Sun Jul 12 22:50:41 2015 UTC,"It isn't the same game as we had back in the vanilla days.  A big deal is made of ""blizlike"" servers, such as Nost, Kronos and others.  Primal isn't a blizlike server, it's probably best described as a custom server.  Is that a problem?  I suppose it really depends how much you want that original feel and game play style.  If you've watched Dodgy's video, you'll see him finishing up by saying it is like an upgraded version of the game.  I quite like that way of putting it, so when my retail subscription drops in a few weeks I'll probably give Primal a good go.  Personally, I like tanking but tanking in vanilla was a bit of a pain in the ass.  Prot warrior in WoTLK was very sweet, so this works for me.  YMMV."
wowservers,3d1lwm,DiscoSt,5,Mon Jul 13 00:40:13 2015 UTC,"Sure, I understand what you mean by being a custom upgraded version. It is kinda of WotLK Blizzlike while leveling up to 60, the rest is tuned up to be an enjoyable experience but it is neither WotLK Blizzlike, nor Vanilla Blizzlike."

To add my 2c worth, I have been leveling a druid on horde side, currently lvl 45.  I am enjoying myself by working toward Loremaster of Kalimdor as my first goal and as I level.  Every quest is available that I can remember (and I have Everyquest so I remember them all) and I have, in that time, found one escort quest that had slight problems, which were fixed by some creative pulling before I started it a second time, and so far only one quest needing to use the (very simple to use) quest completer. The A:H ratio seems to be about 2:1 at this point, so if you are coming here, please consider rolling horde for those who like to bg.  All in all, this is the best private server I have tried.  Like most people who play private, I was active in vanilla and remember all of the expansions, having played for the ten years WoW has been retail.  This server brings that best of the old world to life and has dropped the worst (druids can use potions in form, etc).    Like you, Mr Kebaab, I have found home."

wowservers,3d1lwm,trmpah,2,Sun Jul 12 21:28:50 2015 UTC,It is the copied Truewow core.  They have changed hps.  And modified healing/damage output.  They are playing with percentages right now to try and get it in-line.  I really look forward to the bug-fixing and the problems I saw happening inside those dungeons.  If they are tackling those issues it will really help sell the server.

It's not just affecting Nostalrius, apparently it's affecting other game servers and EU voip services such as Teamspeak.

It is the most populated server there has ever been (talking about single servers).   Blizzard even ordered Twitch to shut down EVERY stream under 'World of Warcraft' that was streaming Vanilla at a point not too long ago.  There's areas where Blizzards DMCA laws won't apply (basically all of Europe) and I hope CC isn't dumb enough to host in Canada/US.
wowservers,3d1z36,Laova,15,Sun Jul 12 21:41:18 2015 UTC,"It's like you guys have no patience whatsoever. Yeah, it's not perfect and it's a bit overpopulated, but every time people post about nost it's always things that can be easily overcome. To the guy below me, I've never had to camp that hard for a quest, especially with a group of 4."
wowservers,3d1z36,dayxdreams,-2,Sun Jul 12 22:34:41 2015 UTC,"Being an east coast player and being unable to hit players because the client shows them in front of you but latency actually puts them ahead of you is not easily overcome. Random drops from the server while questing and then dieing, random drops while on a boat and logging back in in the exhaustion area, disconnecting off a griffon and logging back in way far away from your flight end? Yeah, these aren't little things or easily overcome. And this has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with patience at all. This has to do with false advertisement to inflate the server population. There is absolutely no way the dev's have been working on this server for the past four years and achieved the results currently found on this server."
wowservers,3d1z36,dungeonjay,6,Sun Jul 12 22:45:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  Actually, this may be a surprise to some but Kronos was promoting their server way before Nostalrius.  Everyone was hyped about Kronos then Nostalrius stepped in about 4 months before Kronos launch and started hyping it up harder.  Then, they pushed to release the server a month before Kronos.  It was a well played marketing scheme.  One, in which, I don't entirely understand since they are a free private server with nothing to gain from this other than undercutting someone that had been promoting their server for a lot longer.    Note  Nostalrius did have an open french vanilla server(i think?) a while back but closed it down to revamp it and reopen with Nostalrius begins.....someone with some more backdrop history might be able to fill this information in a little better than me."
wowservers,3d1z36,CaptainButtmad,6,Sun Jul 12 23:24:15 2015 UTC,"Other way around. Nostalrius announced their release based around the 1 month anniversary of BRF opening on retail, and Kronos announced it's open beta test date the same day as Nos' release and a launch date that was exactly one month after Nos' launch. Nos also spent its time hyping up current retail players, while Kronos focused on the existing private server community for hype."
wowservers,3d1z36,dungeonjay,3,Mon Jul 13 00:00:18 2015 UTC,"Well.  That makes sense.  I knew about Kronos long before Nostalrius simply because I hang around the private server community.  At the same time, I haven't been around in the PS community long enough to have heard much of Nostalrius previous Vanilla server which was out awhile back?  Just know they had it because of a youtube video post-dated like 2012 or something."
wowservers,3d1z36,KnaxxLive,5,Mon Jul 13 00:07:12 2015 UTC,"I really don't have any idea what you are talking about.  Lately there have been a few crashes.

wowservers,3d1z36,dungeonjay,7,Sun Jul 12 23:37:11 2015 UTC,"Well.  That is the nature of the beast.  It has a large population to effect the MS.  It is a private server and privately funded.  I found that playing it during certain times is about unbearable.  Honestly, you will find broken quests and scripts on any private server you travel upon.  It is just the extent of the broken quests.  They don't have the code.  It wasn't handed over to them and they have to backwards rewrite and fill in gaps where the code was missing or broken.  Sometimes, they can never fix it.    My suggestion if you are looking for a nice experience for you and your niece to play on, I would go with Gamer-District's Wrath server.  It is the most polished questing server I've ever seen.  If you have any questions about joining feel free to message me directly and I can instruct you on how to log-in and how to change experience rates if you want to do x1 instead of the x7.    Or, perhaps, Dalaran-WoW which has an smooth leveling experience offered as well.  Again, any questions just message me and I can give you some advice on decent servers around here.  I've tried them all."

wowservers,3d1z36,dungeonjay,0,Mon Jul 13 14:46:40 2015 UTC,"And I get that, I really do, but 4 years of work and this what you get? Let me direct you to a different game by private, non-funded server that has put in the same amount of time and achieved vastly different results.  www.project1999.com  Granted they've been at this for a lot longer then these guys but the idea is the same. There's very little feedback if things are fixxed or perhaps i'm just not seeing them? There's very little feedback with the community at all outside the initial ideas of the server. If there was feedback that the devs are actively going back and fixing things I would feel a lot better but this... this feels like a lie."
wowservers,3d1z36,alexhjelm,4,Sun Jul 12 22:31:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I can't really comment on project1999 because that is EQ and I have no idea how they sniffed the data or if it was given.  How unstable it was before they started working on the project.  A lot of the problems that exist in a vanilla server is that the code was incomplete and they are trying to fill in data.  I haven't found a single Vanilla/TBC server that isn't affected by this.  It all comes down to the development core that it is being ran on.  A programmers nightmare from what I've heard.   Wrath had the best sniffs/data retrieval of any Blizzard expansion.  That is why they will usually be the most prominent(new servers) because even the stock Trinitycore is 90-95% working when you D/L and start fixing on it.    All this being said, a lot of people put emphasis on Kronos having a more comprehensive scripting going on.  I don't know this because I don't play there.  But, a lot of people say this that have played on Nostalrius and Kronos."
wowservers,3d1z36,Bibje,8,Sun Jul 12 22:44:13 2015 UTC,"4 years of work and this is what you get    It's 4 years of people putting in their own time and spending their own money.

I was level 19 and had to kill like 6 of that, 12 of that and 12 of that. I did it with a group of 4 and after an hour I was halfway. Thats were I decided to pick an less populated server.

TBC endgame is a lot more time consuming than Cata, with all the dailies and atunements and grinding, whereas cata only requires you to be geared enough to enter your relevant dungeon/raid.   Also Atlantiss doesn't keep it a secret that they have a MoP progressive server planned after all of cata is released so either way you'll be getting at least 2 expansions worth. (Assuming you don't wanna do Wotlk over again on primal)  I can wholeheartedly recommend Atlantiss. Great server, great community.  If you choose Atlantiss pm me your IGN and I'll hook you up with a little starter pack. (200g + bags + a random gift). I play Alliance though so that's about all I can do for you."

wowservers,3d1nky,Magicono,2,Mon Jul 13 08:07:11 2015 UTC,"They are looking to create a perfect TBC experience.  Not Vanilla content.  They are trying to perfectly script TBC before release.  Problem is, even servers that have been out for years now with a paid development team can't seem to pull that off.  It is an abysmal core they are working with(most of them)....I believe Hellground is using a different core and I heard that their scripting was pretty tight for TBC but it is mainly a polish speaking server.  Anyways.  Good luck to that endeavor but the sniffs and data from that expansion never panned out well and we may never see a 100% endgame scripted TBC server."
wowservers,3d1nky,dungeonjay,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:20:28 2015 UTC,"Some people have been saying that Wrath was the best documented expansion in WoW, in terms of data retention. Was TBC just poorly retained by Blizzard so potential coders had very little to work with from the start to make a decent TBC server?"
wowservers,3d1nky,Magicono,2,Mon Jul 13 18:06:40 2015 UTC,"It was the data retrieved and the Core originally presented for free for public developers to work on.  I'm not 100% up to par on the technical side but in a nutshell the Mangos core was a patch work and since most Vanilla/TBC servers run a Mangos they are working on someone else's information.    From what I understand(which some days isn't much), whenever they re-code it usually unravels a layer of another code since Mangos is patch-worked so hard.  There-in lies the problem.  Fix 1 thing and 10 things break.  Hellground runs off another developed core(I don't know if it is open source and available to the public) that was offered that was substantially in a better place to begin with(in terms of re-working the script).  A lot of the reason people say Hellground has better scripting.    Since no one really wants to open source their work anymore on TBC you have this universal problem of working off the same backwards Mangos core from eons ago.  And, for some reason, people seem to use this core to start their servers on.  Maybe because it is the easiest and most available core?  If some of the private servers would pool their knowledge together we could have a much better standard core to work with at this point(like the open source that happened for Wrath) but this hasn't happened yet and may never happen.    I hope that clarified it up a little.... :)     Sidenote:  There was only a small team that presented the TBC core for open source.  So, really their initial sniffing of data/reworking the scripts on a different core(then blizzards) and the updating by a few select random developers that didn't hold onto their reworked scripting is given the real credit for their even being TBC servers available to play today."
wowservers,3d1nky,dungeonjay,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:24:30 2015 UTC,I do find it strange that the private server creating communities seem to have a somewhat pointless competition between each other. Some have the same goal as another and having them split into separate servers and communities just makes it harder to get all the interested players into one place.

wowservers,3d1oft,MrGamemasterReviews,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:20:51 2015 UTC,"You're going to be waiting a long time (2-3+ years) if you wait for Atlantiss' MoP realm.  Warmane is probably your best bet currently for MoP realms, but I personally wouldn't play it at all because of the donation system.  I can't imagine it will be very good, but Feenix has promised a MoP realm very soon (next month/two?) so that might be something you want to check out. It will have a decent population at the very least."
wowservers,3d1oft,pikunul,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:39:24 2015 UTC,"I played on warmane and freakz (more on warmane actually) both were crap. Too much bugs, major/minor, mobs walking thru walls, people leave parties because they wipe without 30min deserter because they logout 1st. etc"

Or try one of the other servers out that doesn't?  :)  Honestly, it is a controlled setting in Raid environment and helps facilitate more raiding or heroic dungeon opportunities on a small populace server like Excalibur that only sees 1.7k peaks."
wowservers,3d1qjt,dungeonjay,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:17:33 2015 UTC,Hellground is probably the least bad but it's still far from perfect.
wowservers,3d1qjt,Anesthesize,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:46:39 2015 UTC,"Hellground is the most polished (no pun intended) TBC server currently out, but it is heavily underpopulated compared to Feenix/Excalibur, and the population is something like 95% polish."

wowservers,3d1pak,SandMan560,2,Sun Jul 12 20:33:55 2015 UTC,"No, it isn't always this bad.  There is speculation on the forums that the devs are working on something, which is causing the server to crash excessively today.  However officially all they said was that they were aware of the crashes and were working to fix it.  So I am not really sure, but it should be resolved."
wowservers,3d1pak,Nehalennian,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:35:09 2015 UTC,"No pal, it crashes sometimes like every pserver, but is not unstable!"
wowservers,3d1pak,stonehriot,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:37:49 2015 UTC,"Idk, but it seems like a lot of the servers are crashy today."
wowservers,3d1pak,KnaxxLive,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:43:53 2015 UTC,Nope. The crashes are like ... birth pains of pregnancy. 99% of it is decently stable but there are times where things go a little haywire. The crashes and whatnot are a byproduct of changes in code and working on the server (and whatnot). It's nothing that completely ruins the gaming experience or anything so much that it is a huge problem.   I myself was killing heroic bosses like 2 days ago and the lag made us wipe 3-5 times but we killed the boss after a while and everyone went about their business. Sure noobs on world chat might complain about about the lag but people like me don't care about it that much. It's whatever.
wowservers,3d1pak,BrandonzThrowaway,-3,Mon Jul 13 17:47:14 2015 UTC,"LOL, I quit 6 months ago because it was crashing like crazy. And back then, they still said it wasn't always that bad, and that they're working on something. They're not doing shit. It's nice to see I didn't waste my time with that fucking bullshit."
wowservers,3d1oqt,crusaderftws,4,Sun Jul 12 20:16:10 2015 UTC,"There is no accurate estimation.  The Github bug/progress tracker currently sits around ~25%.  There were a few regressions (new bugs) introduced in the latest beta according to what I heard, so these could further slow things down (so far ~56% have been solved according the the github milestone tracker.    I don't think a release can be expected within the next 10 months (only my opinion)."
wowservers,3d1oqt,Iwasapirateonce,4,Sun Jul 12 20:21:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly...this is probably at least a five year project(at least how they want TBC to be before release).  If it was me.  I would find something else to occupy my time.  Corecraft may see a 2017 release.....and hopefully in the early part of the year.     Yes, I just totally skipped 2016.  The way they are going it won't be ready so don't get your hopes up."

wowservers,3d1g22,pikunul,-5,Sun Jul 12 19:19:35 2015 UTC,It has a lot to do with the server not being able to take the burden that Wintegrasp can impose. For low-population servers this is easy + I'm not seeing how Wintergrasp will be fun on servers that you need half the population of the entire realm to have it properly playable.

People praise Dalaran for their raid scripting, but I must say, their leveling really isn't all that good. Granted, most of the quests work (escorts and all that), but mobs/mob interaction etc are all pretty horrid. Lots of mobs underground, walking while casting, evade bugging, over/under-tuned, etc."

Pretty much all caster mobs spells hit hard. Yellow mobs (most recently for me was yesterday with the sprites is Feralas) will aggro from a distance just by right-clicking on them.  I did not see a left-click aggro.  Those 2 mines in Elwynn Forest are notoriously hard on every server I have played on - Nostalrius, Kronos, Excalibur and Dalaran-WoW."

And this is freakin 2k population server, where people recommend this server, cuz gameplay is great, meanwhile fuckin basics in this server is broken.

wowservers,3cyvqa,Ba11in0nABudget,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:07:44 2015 UTC,"Lmao look at the babies crying because an arena server is offering a competitive, equal enviroment.  If there was a gear progression, it should just be one that's ""fun"". Like a goal you can work towards, not one that brings you can ACTUAL advantage. Not in a competitive PvP enviroment. You really don't want players who are already better at the game to have an extra advantage by the game.   I used to think that it would be a good idea, but I've moved away from that since. Personally, I think actual gear progression can work in TBC. But I feel in Wrath, Cata and MOP, gear scales way too fucking much."
wowservers,3cyvqa,schaka,2,Sun Jul 12 11:11:02 2015 UTC,"The problem is that a lot more of the miniscule character progression there was is being removed. And nothing is being added to replace nor increase it, and fucking christ don't even mention that ""Weekly Points"" shit. Character progression is what keeps the majority of wow players whom are casuals, interested in pushing forwards, staying on the server long-term, and coming back after breaks. Malaco tried to turn this into a WoW version of League of Legends, and it's failing hard.  Lets see how much more the gameplay experience can be butchered, before even the Molten audience leaves it deserted."

I remember working hard to get the current PVP gear decided to do some world PVP for fun, only to find people with just flex SoO with more HP, more attack power, generally more everything coming in and even if they were bad they still had a very good chance of beating good PVP players. Actually now that I think about it what made me actually quit retail was flighting a frost DK in timeless isle, neither of us had that one area buff and even though I did everything right, predicted and countered everything he did he still won, why? Because the guy had 180k HP over what I had in my full blown PVP set verses his SoO normal/heroic set. The guy seriously only won with 12k also so to me that was a turning point from playing retail.  AT putting everyone on the same level of gear is not the end of the world. Matter of fact now nobody has to complain about grinding and nobody can complain about being out geared. Now when people lose in a match all they can do is blame themselves... or their arena partner... or lag."

wowservers,3d1o4v,Neretz,3,Sun Jul 12 23:36:11 2015 UTC,Ill try Warmane's Lordaeron for now. I took a look at corecraft and if im not mistaken it looks like it is currently live?

But my guess would be that CoreCraft is in the best position. Crestfall is still heavily rewriting and fleshing out their core. ClassicWarcraft as stated has a scarce amount of sparetime. Warmane's Lordaeron recently begun with the development.  CoreCraft's work ethic has increased the last 2 months, and they are still pushing rewrites and fleshing out the core aswell. But they have a lot done on the surface, in terms of quests, mobs, spells, etc.  You have to remember. For some people it may have felt like an eternity, but CoreCraft has only been in development for 3 or 3 and a half years. In contrast to Nostalrius' and Kronos' 5 years total development time. And the CC team still has accomplished far far more than they have, as Kronos' and Nostalrius' cores are still pretty much over 90% MaNGOS."

Look at Rend in UBRS for example. you dont even need to kill the adds you can simply wait it out and gyth/rend will come running down to you. This is just one example most of the dungeons are dogshit and bugs are fixed extremely slow. Minor ones are being completetly ignored.

You will get to know everyone there because the population of a good one sits around 1.5-2k.  The RDF was also across cross-realm on retail and that(depending on your group) could have meant upwards to 30k players all in the same cross-realm pool.  Large difference.    As far as talents and changes goes....not much to do about that.  They all primarily run on 3.3.5a

wowservers,3cuji2,IIIIIIIIIIlIl,4,Fri Jul 10 22:30:02 2015 UTC,Few options here for Wotlk: 1) Dalaran 2) Warmane's x1 server they are opening soon 3) Truewow    If what you seek is RDF and slower more blizz-like leveling.    On Gamer-District you can actually change the xp...by doing xprate .1 or w/e and level at x1 and they have a working RDF as well.  I don't know many people that do this on that server though.
wowservers,3cuji2,dungeonjay,2,Fri Jul 10 22:55:09 2015 UTC,"Dalaran is more blizzlike in my opinion, plus the 1x rates really smooths the leveling experience. If you want endgame, though, go GD. The 7x rates will really help you there."

You can do the Seeker, Loremaster... and all that achievements without any issue.  Their raid Scripting is almost perfect, now with such leveling experience the server is freaking great. No wonder, at least for me, dalaran is and it will be the best WOTLK server around for years."
wowservers,3cuu9q,Squex,4,Fri Jul 10 23:27:25 2015 UTC,"Overall Russian private servers have biggest active players base, with WoW Circle at the top, but there are others with 10k-20k pop servers http://wow.mmotop.ru/ people don't even know what servers even exist behind the ""International or Support of International Playerbase"" etc. while we are in Russia now, there is a server called UWOW.biz which might be the most complete MoP server ( no i haven't played but overall content in videos that are being filmed on the server shows server quality, ect. its the server with 70-80% scripted Siege of Orgrimmar ). There are servers like Geek Crusade (TBC) with has really good scripting but sadly 100% of the population is French and that is the fact that destroys playability on this server,international people don't want to join cause they think that they will be alone, its not like the server owners won't like bigger population. But look at this fact now, Atlantiss was at the begging server with only Polish community, at some point ""international community"" started joining the server more and more thus far Server announced that it will convert into True international server and it REALLY did and now even more people are joining population went from 500-600 to 1200-1400. My point is if this method starts on all servers we would have bunch of more options to choose while choosing the right server, Example Tauri-WoW or Twinstar these are really fascinating servers but both ""Language Barrier problem"" if they would change to international it would be never-ending awesomeness . If you look at International toplists you will find those servers its not that they don't wan't ""International Community"".

wowservers,3cuu9q,Sniprep,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:57:21 2015 UTC,"I feel you on that.  However, I think there isn't as many NA players as International.  This is in fact due to limited knowledge of private servers in the NA region by the retail player-base.  There is also a stigma in the NA(American mainly) about this fear of losing their Battlenet account on Blizzard if they play on private servers.  I, also, think this delves into the realm of mentality that Americans have and a lot of them don't understand private server emulation or emulation of any kind.  A smaller percentage of gamers in the US truly understand Emulation and its function.  I don't think it is a snub clause...I think it is a fear clause.....   I am an American gamer.  I have been playing on the internet since there were BBS's.  This is just my knowledge of this since I have been around the scene since the early 90s.    I actually played on a server called GEnie.  You paid by the hour(a ridiculous amount).  Just so I could play an online rpg(one of the first mmos).  More like a Mud.....since it was all text based.  But, it was the first RPG I played online with others that had a decent population at that time."
wowservers,3cuu9q,dungeonjay,2,Sat Jul 11 13:55:20 2015 UTC,Combined through all expansions?  Probably Wow-Circle....or maybe Warmane.  For a single server....I would say Nostalrius has the highest peak population.

wowservers,3cuu9q,Ambassador_Buta,2,Sat Jul 11 00:41:47 2015 UTC,"How does Nostalrius population ""break the game completely?"" I leveled 1-60 when the leveling zones were at their absolute peak, and I didn't have any real problems. In some cases the high amount of players forces you to group for some quests. That was it.   I absolutely love the fact that the cities are bustling, the economy is as alive as can be, and that you can always find a group for anything you might need."
wowservers,3cuu9q,multi_shot_,2,Fri Jul 10 23:49:32 2015 UTC,"I have my doubts about your claim about the economy, but don't really know enough to refute it. I can say this, however: I played on Stormscale EU during Wrath of the Lich King when it was absolutely packed and there was a queue almost every night. I don't know the retail limit for a server, but the amount of players online at peak must have been close to Nostalrius sees on a friday night (6-7k). The economy on Stormscale was perfectly healthy.  As for grouping, I have been playing here steadily since March and have never, ever, had any group leader ask to meet and inspect me, let alone base his decision to invite or not invite me on what gear I have. LFG is done mostly in world chat, and you get invited through whispers. You tell them your role and level, and get invited if there's a spot. Who has time to inspect people? It just doesn't happen.   Raids may be a different thing altogether, but I would expect a competent raid leader to set some sort of standard for gear. Even still, I have run UBRS (granted, it's easy as hell) upwards of 20 times, many of which while still clad in mostly greens, and never had any problems getting in.   I don't really see where you're getting this idea from. That someone would waste their time checking the gear of every potential invite just seems absurd when you think about how easy the dungeons are."
wowservers,3cuu9q,multi_shot_,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:05:44 2015 UTC,"The flip side to lots of players and lots of things on the AH is that lots of people are buying stuff from the AH too.  Sure it will likely deflate low level stuff because lots of the population is lower leveled but that's actually a good thing since most private servers get massive inflation at a certain point because the whole pop is level 60.   Anyway, more people = more supply AND more demand not just more supply."

wowservers,3cuu9q,Beefstaek,2,Mon Jul 13 15:32:23 2015 UTC,"Actually they never envisioned Vanilla to launch and be that popular.  Their original estimate was 80 servers 2.5k for 200,000 concurrent players on at any one time.  This population capacity remained the same for a couple months.  Then, the higher populations they moved to 4k.  Eventually, the dust settled on server capacity versus waiting.  There was still wait times all the way through TBC and Wrath depending on the server.  This is even after some of the larger servers moved upwards to 8k population capacity in the beginning of TBC to finally settle around 12k(on the highest populated servers) at the end of TBC into Wrath.  Again, all this fluctuated because Blizzard adjusted the capacity of the server based upon the demand.

Second: Nobody here was claiming there was a cap to the number of characters that could be created on a realm in total. The claim was that only 2-3k players could be online simultaneously (please check you spelling) on a single server.

Unrelated to my argument with you; posted by Drysc, a blue, on 12-20-2006 (during the vanilla times Nostalrius is attempting to emulate):  ""There is a predetermined amount of players set for the realms based on a design goal of approximately how many players are intended to be within a given 'game-world'. There are some concerns with realm stability factored in with having a concurrency-cap, but it's a side factor.  Once that cap is reached any additional players attempting to log in will be placed in a queue. Players entering into the queue aren't re-arranged by any factors, such as characters on that realm, level of those characters, etc.""  http://blue.cardplace.com/newcache/forums.worldofwarcraft.com/59246246.htm  Drysc's words show that Blizzard used (side note: they still use it) a queue system to limit the number of active players on any one realm.  In the future, doing a bit of research before posting incorrect information, such as ""they never limited the amount of players on one realm"" will make you look more intelligent  edit: Also, I've realized how stupid it is that I'm arguing a point I don't care about with someone I don't know on reddit of all places. As I have written all I feel is necessary, I will not continue to dispute this point."

You have to earn the gear.  They may even offer a full set of honor gear and instant level but then you have to progress through arena(or buying it; depending on the server). Warmane offers instant 80/85/90 PVP  (no open world) Mortal Cata offers instant 85 (Has PVP/PVE but no open world) Those are the better of the bunch of instant servers as far as population goes.

wowservers,3ctg43,huskymuffintop,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:27:08 2015 UTC,Alright...?  But other than someone jacking off in the wilderness hoping to run across another there is no point to it?  The dungeons are closed and there is no progression...unless that has changed?  Has that changed?
wowservers,3ctg43,dungeonjay,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:59:13 2015 UTC,Don't see what dungeons and progression have to do with an open world. Especially considering dungeons are not part of the open world.
wowservers,3ctg43,huskymuffintop,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:27:10 2015 UTC,"An open world is a level or game designed as a nonlinear, open areas with many ways to reach an objective.[5] Some games are designed with both traditional and open world levels.[6] An open world facilitates greater exploration than a series of smaller levels,[3] or a level with more linear challenges.[7] Reviewers have judged the quality of an open world based on whether there are interesting ways for the player to interact with the broader level when they ignore their main objective.[7] Some games actually use real settings to model an open world, such as New York City.[8]    Taken from the wiki.    Open world setting has to have objectives.  An open world and an open sandbox are two different type of settings.  What you are referring to is an open sandbox with no quests, no progression...no linear reasoning other than to find someone else and smash them because they haven't bordered off the world.  So....if you want to refer to Warsong or Blackrock you need to say ""open sandbox setting""...if you want to get technical about the ability to leave the pvp staging areas and go seek out people doing the same outside the objectives.    I try not to remain so, ""technical""....but maybe I had to for this case.    added note  Even then...open sandbox usually contains goals and objectives....take this point...do this....kill so many of them....etc...     See what I mean?"
wowservers,3ctg43,dungeonjay,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:42:34 2015 UTC,"First off, sorry for the late reply, I've been busy.  I actually downloaded the AT/Warmane MoP server, but there wasn't an instant 90 option as far as I could see. Apparently it was removed at some point.  I will take a look at Mortal Cata, though, thank you."
wowservers,3ctlvt,xerum26,5,Fri Jul 10 17:53:00 2015 UTC,From Eastern US - Michigan on Kronos I get 100-130
wowservers,3ctlvt,GMGurky,3,Fri Jul 10 20:11:59 2015 UTC,From Illinois I get 120 average on Kronos. It's about the best option.
wowservers,3ctlvt,Dimpled,2,Fri Jul 10 22:59:49 2015 UTC,"I have had to suck it up. I live in PA and play mostly weekends and a few evenings (6 pm - 10 pm EST). I am on Dalaran-WoW because I loved the WOTLK and previous content, builds, etc. We have I guess an average population on Agalon realm (approx ~2,000 or so peak) but that is always EU peak time.   I havent experienced a ping much more than 180, but then again I have thus far solo content/quested and have not tried any Dungeons or PuG RAID. I am guessing my ping would suffer in that case. I also am only at lvl 30 so I havent gotten to higher level more crowded areas but when I am in the main cities with people around, I have had a really seamless gaming exp. So much so that I almost forget I am not in an active sub retail server. IMO that is how smooth and well scripted Dalaran-WoW is."
wowservers,3ctlvt,ksharp25,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:15:17 2015 UTC,"I get 140-200 at different times on 4 different EU private servers I'm on, and I live in the southeast US. 400-800 shouldn't happen anywhere in the US, unless there's an issue on your end.  I know that when I switched from my local cable internet provider to Uverse my ping went down by 100 ms to all games, things like that can make a big difference."

wowservers,3ctlvt,dungeonjay,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:21:19 2015 UTC,"Rebirth is hosted in EU now.  Vengeance is the only NA hosted server stationed in Canada.  You seem to be encountering extreme packet-loss versus population.  Nostalrius is about unplayable for me during the day for the higher MS and lag issues.  I wait until NA evenings to play on it.  If you are only looking into Vanilla servers then the options are pretty bare.  Rebirth, Valkyrie, Vanilla Gaming, Feenix, Nostalrius and Kronos.  You may have to try them all and find the one you are comfortable playing with the MS on."

wowservers,3csqcx,pepsiblast08,2,Fri Jul 10 13:49:22 2015 UTC,You have a couple choices for Wrath. Gamer-District - PVP/PVE focused with great scripting(Medium Playerbase) Dalaran - PVE focused/Light PVP with great raid scripting(Medium Playerbase) Warmane - PVP/PVE focused with good overall scripting(Large Playerbase)

wowservers,3csqcx,Beefstaek,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:57:26 2015 UTC,Would you recommend this over Warmane?
wowservers,3csqcx,Beefstaek,5,Fri Jul 10 13:51:11 2015 UTC,"the problem with warmane currently is that it is in a very buggy state, promises are that this will change but personally i will be convinced when ""its done"" also i never liked that they claimed stuff is not fixable just so people pay for stuff when other servers had the same stuff fixed and working.  also i always felt that cheaters on molten ran rampant without much happening against it sure there were the global notifications bla bla got banned or whatever for ""insert reason"" but i still knew alot of people who were blatantly using hacks/cheats and never got cought and they currently still do the same without anything happening.  for blizzlike 1x rates and no shop to buy end-lvl gear with fairly decent playerbase there are some servers out there you would have to specifiy which expansion though."
wowservers,3csqcx,Cover25,2,Fri Jul 10 14:11:36 2015 UTC,WOTLK is my preferred expansion. Never played anything newer so not sure if they'd be worth diving into.
wowservers,3csqcx,mewcat4,3,Fri Jul 10 14:45:58 2015 UTC,yea then 2 good options already have been named dalaran and gamers-district

wowservers,3csk81,petersaints,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:16:01 2015 UTC,I think that the problem is that I have third-party cookies disabled on my browser and you are using Opinion Stage polls. So when I access privatewow.eu the opiniostage.com cookies are blocked and I'm allowed to vote as many times as I want.  Disabling cookies altogether has the same effect. Oh well... the only way to stop people from voting more than once would be to IP block but since most residential IPs are dynamic and some users may share the same IP it is not really feasible.
wowservers,3csk81,Beefstaek,0,Fri Jul 10 14:55:07 2015 UTC,"i wonder what means best to people ? if it goes by stable/most bugfixes then some of the votes are clearly wrong, if best means only high population then sure votes seeme ok."
wowservers,3csk81,huskymuffintop,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:48:37 2015 UTC,"OP didn't say 'best' anywhere in terms of voting, not in the title and surely not on his page, OP just said 'favorite'."

wowservers,3csk81,Beefstaek,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:55:58 2015 UTC,"and thats the problem only because someone thinks its the best it does not mean its actually the best server which can be missleading for new players that search the ""best"" meaning scripting very good and then they end up on warmane."
wowservers,3csk81,Suntys,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:07:45 2015 UTC,Looks like Not Warmane is #1 . Guess the population is not everything

wowservers,3csk81,Suntys,0,Sat Jul 11 10:51:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly,  Tauri WoW/Twinstar/Frostmourne are in such a huuuuge disadvantage in this poll. They are non-EN servers and their players rarely visit reddit like international players from Warmane/Atlantiss.  And all 3 of those are comparable to Atlantiss or better in some aspects, all with huge population."
wowservers,3csk81,dungeonjay,3,Fri Jul 10 16:27:18 2015 UTC,That should be obvious since this is a reddit in English with bilingual members.  I'm sure if the poll was taken on a Russian or Polish cast vote it would lean in a different direction entirely.  The same if we did a poll for what is your favorite sport.  Depending on the language(and region) it will definitely lean one way or another.

wowservers,3cquf4,SativaSammy,8,Fri Jul 10 01:13:48 2015 UTC,The general consensus seems to be that Kronos is the better server in terms of bugs and scripting but Nostalrius has a huge population going for it. Take your pick.
wowservers,3cquf4,GrungeLord,2,Fri Jul 10 01:20:20 2015 UTC,Rebirth has the best:  *Scripting  *Content and patch release schedule  *Community  The population is low but join one of the major guilds on either faction / don't be a dick and you won't have any trouble getting groups

If you choose Nostalrius or Kronos you will have to relevel up in a x1 environment.  Nostalrius has the most population and Kronos has the best scripting.

I know they are trying to put a lot more work into their realms now because of the tight competition.  Personally, I'd just roll on Nostalrius(since you are NA) and start dabbling a little play time there to see if it fits your criteria....They are also talking about eventually releasing a TBC server with free character transfer(but maintaining the character on both realms).  That might be a pipedream since they take awhile to release content."

wowservers,3cn79z,huskymuffintop,3,Thu Jul 9 07:54:14 2015 UTC,You can recover your account by making a new account and contacting Web Support. You should get enough coins to re-make your characters entirely. That's what most of the players did and yeah Warmane is the most popular option.

wowservers,3cn79z,dungeonjay,4,Thu Jul 9 08:22:52 2015 UTC,I strongly disagree that GD is better scripted than Dalaran-WoW. I think it's widely agreed upon that Dal is the best scripted WOTLK server.
wowservers,3cn79z,Ba11in0nABudget,4,Thu Jul 9 13:43:47 2015 UTC,Ok... weird to go from +3 to -4 downvotes after this reply showed up!  But what makes you say so? What's usually said is that Dalaran has the better raid scripting for the few raids it has released and GD has the better scripting for well... everything else
wowservers,3cn79z,Pvt_8Ball,3,Thu Jul 9 17:05:22 2015 UTC,"This is a very true statement.  Dalaran has great raid scripts bar none.   And a large population to boost the experience of their progressive server.  Gamer-District is also a ""very"" solid Wrath server.  From beginning to end, it is a great experience.  It doesn't have the exact sequences scripted as well as Dalaran on Ulduar.  Their Naxx's are just about neck and neck in quality, however.  We can't judge ICC yet because Dalaran hasn't released their ICC.  Gamer-District also has better scripted NR dungeons(something not mentioned a lot) than Dalaran.  But, I'm not turning this into Gamer-District has that and Dalaran has that....They both are great servers in their own right and that is all that matters.  Definitely in the top 3 of Wrath servers available to play on."
wowservers,3cn79z,thewallofsleep,5,Thu Jul 9 23:44:10 2015 UTC,Warmane for population. Dalaran-WoW or Gamer-District for better gameplay.
wowservers,3cn79z,Cover25,4,Thu Jul 9 07:52:16 2015 UTC,"I support other people when they say Dalaran-wow, ATM they peak at like 1600 players or something online, and I think that may be rising, also you can do Recruit a friend if that's your style."
wowservers,3cn79z,dnyte270,2,Thu Jul 9 09:22:15 2015 UTC,"Dalaran-WoW is X1 rates.  Great coding/scripting.  Pretty nice community.  Reasonable population which seems to be slowly rising.  Raids are released progressively and you to play through all previous tiers to access the next one. Up to Ulduar is released and has been active for a while.  ToC should be soonish I think.  Good server.  You can buy boosts to 70, heirlooms,  bags, mounts and pets with donation and vote points.  Warmane has more players than Dalaran, but with Dalaran growing, the difference isn't so huge from what I can tell.  Warmane is x7 unless you decide to go with their new X1 realm which is coming soonish I think.  The coding/scripting isn't nearly as good here, and you can 100% buy power.  You can buy best in slot gear for real money.  For me, Warmane has positives and negatives, because it seems to be active at all times, whereas Dalaran isn't as active during peak North American times.

wowservers,3cn79z,Xipeify,2,Thu Jul 9 05:25:04 2015 UTC,"i still cant wrap my head around people saying dalaran is well scripted. I spent my time on that server in combat for 4 days with a level 1 wolf unattackable following me around.  I was frequently unable to turn in or pick up quests due to npcs swimming 50 feet in the air.  Everytime they release a patch on the already buggy ulduar they break 20 more things.  I'm not sure if the people who call this server blizz-like have ever played retail but it is FAR from retail.  GD I've have no such issues with leveling/raiding/pvp.  The only issue I have with the server is the very common loot rules of ""LOOT GOES TO TOP DPS"".  Which from my understanding is pretty common in EU and an incentive not to be lazy.  GD is far better scripted though I did want to play on Dal alot initially from all of the reviews saying it is better.  I wasted far too much time leveling characters on that realm."
wowservers,3cols1,Acisao,3,Thu Jul 9 15:02:44 2015 UTC,"For WotLK I would say Warmane (both Deathwing and Ragnaros) if you want x7 rates with best in slot gear available for real money.  Dalaran-WoW has x1 rates, and you can't buy power with real money.  Server population is pretty good and is growing. But is still 1k-2k behind Warmane.  You can pay to boost to 70 though and buy heirlooms.  I think Dalaran-WoW has much better coding/scripting as well.  The appeal of Warmane is the population and x7 rates if you're into that."
wowservers,3cols1,thewallofsleep,-8,Thu Jul 9 15:29:31 2015 UTC,"Warmane has the most population all together for WoTLK, Cata, and MoP. Also dalaran-wow basically has just 1 developer which isint actually a developer. They only port shitty scripting from the open source trinity project hence why it's ""progressive raiding"". Just like RDF being disabled was probably a ""feature"" for so long."
wowservers,3cols1,Flyjake,7,Thu Jul 9 16:25:02 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but DalaranWoW is better scripted in just about everything in comparison to Warmane. The released raids are top notch, you can actually level at 1x without going through major issues, even mechanically it's better. You try to insult by saying they only 'port shitty scripting from open source trinity' when Warmane/Molten has an hilarious history of being exceptionally shitty. Enjoy the Shadowmourne dropping out of Halion! Or keep waiting for CLB to 'fix everything'..."
wowservers,3cols1,mixd3,-2,Thu Jul 9 17:11:59 2015 UTC,"While that guy was well, blunt for lack of better words he is not exactly lying. Dalaran is only better because it's on the normal trinity core. Now if you checked out lordaeron which is currently in alpha it basically competes directly with dalaran-wow with scripting. I don't know if that is because they switched cores or with their like what? 12 developers and they just decided to put full attention to lordaeron to get it back up to a snuff that kaer wanted before hermes took over and decided to put development on WoTLK on the back burner. I mean let's face facts. Molten had the best scripts around when kaer was in charge then hermes comes along and everything comes down a notch, then kaer comes back, gets new developers, then puts lordaeron on alpha and even in alpha it's like seeing the molten... warmane... whatever I once knew. Also as topic goes, they do still have the most population. I am very curious to see what will happen once the work on lordaeron goes to deathwing and ragnaros, or if what they are saying is true and all expansions are now modular script wise, that work ported to cataclysm and MoP."
wowservers,3cols1,Cardshawrk,4,Thu Jul 9 17:31:21 2015 UTC,"Molten had the best scripts around when kaer was in charge   No... it didn't. Gunship only came when half the privates everywhere already had it, Shadowmourne dropping from Halion, missing Frostmourne phase from LK since ever, the billion bugs everywhere. Molten never had working pathfinding, LoS system was always buggy, classes always had double dip bugs and there were even more aura stacking issues that made raid horribly easy. It's not like Kaer left and then suddenly the realm started getting more buggy.  Frostmourne, Gamer-District, Wowreach (rip) were always better than Molten as far as WotLK scripting goes."

A few invisible walls have been put up so those places are now no longer accessible.  Its not vanilla blizz-like to have those invisible walls those little hidden niches...but it does make WSG games 100% BETTER especially at 60.

It's not just the quality of Kronos, it will be a combination of Kronos quality and Nost shooting themselves in the foot.

wowservers,3cp6x2,Onarm,2,Fri Jul 10 11:04:58 2015 UTC,"No.  I played WoW at release, and it wasn't a perfectly scripted game even then. You'd die constantly to mobs suddenly respawning on you after you killed them, getting launched into the sky, or quests just not completing, especially as you went through Desolace/Feralas/Silithus pre AQ changes. It was an imperfect game, made great by it's community interactions, and ideas at a time when ""fuck the player completely"" was still a valued way of designing games. The idea of a perfectly scripted server interests me far less then the idea of a populated server, even if the scripted server gets updates faster.   Both servers have finished their honeymoons, and from watching the trackers, both servers are dropping subs now. Kronos went from averaging 1k-1200 to averaging 600-800 most nights now, even on the weekends. And Nos went from averaging 5k-8k to averaging 3k-4k. I'm guessing even more people will leave in the coming weeks as they realize vanilla isn't for them. All this will do for Nos will make it vanilla pop/fix the economy/fix the lag. For Kronos, this will likely leave it nothing but the diehards.  I've been playing on both servers back to back to try them both out, and so far Kronos hasn't really been very impressive. As I said, the thing that matters most to an MMO is the MM bits, not the raiding. Progression was only a hobby back in the day, it was the friendships and teambased fuckery you got to take a part of that made vanilla great, and made it something to remember. Maybe you guys had a better time leveling on Kronos back when it launched, but the zones are a near wasteland now, and you'll never find anybody to do elite quests with, let alone see while leveling. I'd rather have too many people then no people.   Nos so far is still, in my mind at least, the only server to play on. They'll release the content at the rate they want to release the content, and there is more then enough to do in vanilla to pad the time between raids. Kronos just doesn't appeal to me at all, especially with how the Kronos community here on Reddit acts about this ""fight""."

wowservers,3cp6x2,Tymmen,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:03:08 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing, OP. The only people that care about BWL are the 50 some odd raiding guilds on Nost currently clearing all content. That's 50 groups of players that have spent minimum 10-15 days /played on a server.  The majority of these people are incredibly invested in the server and will not reroll to Kronos unless their guild came along with them--WoW is a social game after all.   You can't give a 100% guarantee Kronos' BWL will be flawless, as kronos' onyxia didn't have a threat wipe in p2>p3 transition as of a month or two ago, why trade one server's bugs for a different server's if you're going to be playing with 10% of the population you used to play with?  In order for Kronos to live, it needs to offer something different from what other servers currently offer. It currently brings nothing to the table, which is why during US primetime it struggles to peak over 3-400 players.  There's 5-6 servers that I know of that focus on the 1x XP experience aside from Kronos, they are: Nostalrius (averages 3000-9000) Rebirth (peaks at around 300) Valkyrie (peaks at around 6-800) Emerald Dream (peaks at 400ish) Ascension-WoW (peaks around 200) Classic-WoW/Nefarian (peaks around 800)  All of these servers have 1 thing in common: there's absolutely fuckall to do for level 60s that aren't pvp grinding right now. ""Progression"" guilds on these servers are stuck raidlogging in limbo waiting for the next tier of progression which won't come for a lot of these servers for a very very long time.  That's the niche Kronos can fill. If Kronos were to suddenly setup scriptcraft style instant 49 and 5x exp rates while offering AQ and Naxx within the next 6 months, I can guarantee you half of the top guilds from Nost would jump ship. Progression guilds are the only niche audience in the vanilla wow scene that aren't being served properly.  It's a fact that those that play vanilla wow for the ""classic leveling experience"" at 1x rates don't give a fuck about the scripts. I've leveled on all of the big vanilla WoW names and found many quests that just don't work, yet they still have zealous sycophants that screech ""its a free server and it has the best scripts so if you dont like it play somewhere else!"". So instead of catering to those individuals, why doesn't Kronos cater to the PvE heroes?"

We're in #crestfall on the freenode irc, or you can always feel free to email me directly (Asura@Crestfall-Gaming.com).  If you'd like to know what we're developing at the moment, we're actually restructuring a lot of the code to C++14 standards and cleaning up lots of old Ascent code, such as bringing in the non-boost verison of asio for networking code. We're also bringing our master branch, where we've done all our changes(Spells, new AI, etc) and our clustering branch together. That's been a handful as it has to be done commit by commit to ensure nothing gets broken heavily.  On top of actually having the content working, we want to make sure we keep stable and have no bottlenecks, whether it's database queries, networking or just overall usage from our server. It's a pretty big plate but our priority stays as giving the best server that we can.  For our nice list of public changes during June, you can check out: http://pastebin.com/6F39MwnC  Note that those are not counting private changes. Since our code at the moment has been restructuring, updating, and the update to clustering, we've kept it on a secondary private branch (Since 17/6/2015).  If you have any other questions, I'm usually around between 08:00 to 23:00 on IRC (GMT -1), or as I said, my email is open to questions."

wowservers,3cm5v5,dungeonjay,-1,Fri Jul 10 23:54:46 2015 UTC,"This is concept has been around for a very long time and is nothing new, it revolves around having blizzlike character progression through expansions.  Char Transfers just shows how desperate servers get in attempting to get people interested in trying out their servers. And if by default you build a hype like Nostalrius or CoreCraft, it's not needed at all. It's has far bigger minus than it is a plus.  It would only work if you had the proper resources, and we're not only talking about financial resources, but everyone in the team being on the same page, sharing the same ambition, having a proper work ethic and level of dedication to the project.  As it is a huge investment, it's also a huge risk."

Nostalrius is slacking big time on their schedule while kronos is a ghost town. The commitment needed for a project like you suggested (near blizzlike flawless scripts with no p2w) is unfathomable and most people with the knowledge to sustain such an endeavor would eventually choose the safe path and move on to a real well payed job."

I can't see full on 40 vs 40 AV ever happening on kronos unless there's a serious population boom.  A lot of people will give you bulshit about the population, claiming it's lower or higher than it actually is depending on which of the vanilla servers they're fanboying.

A few days, seriously?  There is a pretty healthy WSG community at the moment, even at NA hours, so in a sense you are also giving ""bullshit"".

wowservers,3cjssg,ShaneH021,6,Wed Jul 8 13:41:24 2015 UTC,"I'll give you my summary, having levelled to 50 on Nostalrius and 60 on Kronos. NOTE: I no longer play on either server.  Nostalrius:  The population is incredibly high. This means that all level brackets have BGs, and it's easy to find a group for dungeons.  I played since opening day and enjoyed my time levelling in the beginning. However, continuously having to camp 30+mins for each quest mob does get tiresome and frustrating most of the time. As well as this, it is likely you will see a hell of a lot of world PvP. While this can be a good thing, it will mean you will be ganked more times than you can remember.   Quests were generally scripted well, but sometimes I found that mob paving was a little wonky at times. Not a huge deal, but some players get frustrated by this.  I cannot speak for the scripting at end game, but I hear from most accounts the devs have done a decent job on MC and Onyxia. However, the devs have fallen behind on their schedule of releasing content, and their lack of communication to players can be worrying at times - this is a huge downfall for me as a player. They are obviously dealing with many issues that come with such a high population, but I feel they should still provide more clarity for the players.  With such a high population comes some server problems. A large amount (not all) of the player base report a lag during peak EU times- I am not sure whether this is something the devs can improve further, as they have already implemented many changes affecting the quality of gameplay (i.e. reducing sight distance etc).  Kronos  Kronos has a more manageable population during peak EU times (around 800-1000) players. It's not as easy to find dungeon groups as Nostalrius, but still doable nonetheless. There is small amounts of world pvp, but again less than nostalrius. Questing is much smoother and you are likely to enjoy the levelling process more on Kronos (well, I did). The NA population is a problem, with the playerbase dropping as low of 250-300.   I found quests were scripted well, maybe marginally better than Nos in some aspects, but in all, I don't think there is a noticeable difference. However, Kronos' mob paving is better than mob paving on Nostalrius (fanboys may dispute this, but there is no two-ways about it).  PvE scripting on Kronos is very good. Onyxia's threat seemed a little wonky at times to me, but the jury is still out on whether this is correct or not.   The biggest problem with Kronos is end-game PvP - it is absolutely terrible. As a horde, you will queue for upwards of 2-3hours, and when it does pop, you will face an alliance premade that will stomp you in less than 10 minutes. When horde return a premade, if they win, the alliance will stop queueing. You may get a few pug vs pug games in a day, but horde will stomp alliance and they will stop queueing. The PvP is incredibly monopolised by the alliance premade group (a regular 10-13 players). It is incredibly frustrating, and ultimately played a large part in me leaving vanilla wow behind.  Some quirks  Kronos has a character auction where you may trade your character with someone if they want to. I think this is a nice touch, as this is something that happens on the 'black market' anyway, it's a good way to make the process safer.  10g respec cap on Kronos - enables you to switch specs between raids to PvP. Again, I quite liked this, although it is not strictly 'blizzlike'.   Nos has pre-nerf AV coming out. Although it's not really prenerf, it seems a bit of a hybrid between old and new AV. Anyway, that should be fun and incredibly populated.  Any more questions feel free to ask me."

I had a look at the corecraft website and it looks great for tbc, I'd love to play it from scratch, but doesn't look like it'll be out any time soon"
wowservers,3cjssg,DisforDesperate,3,Wed Jul 8 14:58:26 2015 UTC,"Well... I personally don't think it will get better, mainly due to the fact the regular (good) PvPers on alliance will ONLY queue in their premade. They will not queue with their pugs to give them a more of a chance. It would take a very large population influx to help it, but I'm not sure if that will happen.  EDIT: I am not saying premades do not happen on nostalrius, but the population is so large that there is likely to be many pug v pug game as well."

At this point it should be considered spam by unfairly and unethically manipulating what gets promoted as top threads by upvotes or not.

And downvote all forms of criticism, regardless of whether it's neutral or in a more brutal honest manner.  Should still be considered a strategical, unethical, and unfair form of advertising/spamming. And yet, the mods are still doing nothing to address this kind of behavior. The chance of 90% of this community all playing on Primal Wow is nothing but a fantasy, and if you claim that is the fact, and that the not normal amount of upvotes and Primal Wow threads is just a coincidence.

wowservers,3cd031,oscar956,6,Mon Jul 6 23:18:23 2015 UTC,"I have been playing there for quite some time.  Let's start with facts: The core mechanics like questing and LoS are directly taken from TrueWow, they are outstanding for a non-retail server. I have never experienced any downtime or lag, I know how frustrating a rollback can be. Should one come across something buggy, it has most likely already been posted in their bugtracker. Their entire webpage is actually surprisingly feature-heavy, take a look at their armory for example. What the server offers is a journey through every expansion and raid release on the back of the arguably most mechanically pleasing WoW client version. In the beginning of a new release, the content will be nearly impossible to beat and with time the difficulty will be tuned down. This ensures that because of the different abilities a class might have gained, one can not steamroll newly released content. Right now Molten Core is actively being challenged by players. Depending on the corrent progression, the talent trees can not be entirely completed. The RDF-Tool is currently enabled and working, however this could change later down the road.  Now let's take a more subjective approach: I always dreamed of going back to classic WoW, however the thought of only having about five spells that I actively use while leveling my hunter for example, made me question this idea. On this server however the best of both worlds is being combined, that is atleast how I feel about it. I have gotten so used to the fluently of the newer WoW versions that playing on 1.12.1 for example is simply not as enjoyable to me anymore. I played since retail vanilla and on probably more than 100 differrent private server and for some reason running low level dungeons on this one feels refreshing. The people playing here are absolutely convinced of the potential that this server holds and all we need now is you reading this, we desire a larger population. I hope my comment helped you decided and I thank you for your time and interest."
wowservers,3cd031,kalandriel1234,3,Wed Jul 8 02:50:12 2015 UTC,"What I might have missed is that there is absolutely no premium or other pay2win-system. All you can get in their shop are services like changing your characters name or vanity items, which were also available on retail servers. You can also get the mounts of the different races there, however it makes no real difference, because on retail you could also just buy yourself the [Reins of the Swift Spectral Tiger](www.wowhead.com/item=49284/reins-of-the-swift-spectral-tiger) for example."
wowservers,3cd031,kalandriel1234,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:03:02 2015 UTC,In my opinion that's even more fair than Blizzard.

wowservers,3cd031,Indicted,14,Wed Jul 8 05:35:28 2015 UTC,This server is actually a really good one that's being led by a excellent team of devs.  I highly recommend this server.
wowservers,3cd031,Cover25,-3,Tue Jul 7 06:08:06 2015 UTC,"lol I guess you are trolling, I read somewhere you and many ppl hate the this server cause of their lies and lack of development   I think there are tons of things poorly thought and insane amount of custom things, soon all the players will notice playing vanilla with 3.3.5 is not good..."
wowservers,3cd031,takashilol,3,Tue Jul 7 23:19:35 2015 UTC,I've rethought my position and support this server fully.   Roel and his team are doing good work.
wowservers,3cd031,Cover25,3,Tue Jul 7 23:45:57 2015 UTC,"Question though, when creating game accounts, do you need three separate ones for each expansion/version of the game? It looks to be that way in the account manager section. Or can you have one that is linked to WotLK and use it for all of them as the server progresses?  Actually I see it now, it looks like you can change the version of the account or something. I'll have to play around with it all when I get home."
wowservers,3cd031,catnipcartel,3,Tue Jul 7 12:48:13 2015 UTC,"I didn't have to mess around with changing the version of my account or anything.  Just made a forum account, made a character account, and linked them via the account manager."
wowservers,3cd031,Cleofatra,3,Tue Jul 7 14:26:00 2015 UTC,"I'll try it out for sure when I get back to my computer that has the client on it. But when I looked in the account manager and selected the account I linked to the forum account, it has a spot that says ""Expansion"" and can be changed via drop down list to Vanilla, TBC, or WotLK. Just made me wonder what effect that has on it all. It has other stats/info on the same panel too, such as Last login, Date Joined , Failed Logins, etc."
wowservers,3cd031,catnipcartel,3,Tue Jul 7 14:36:56 2015 UTC,"Weird, I guess just do WotLK"
wowservers,3cd031,Cleofatra,3,Tue Jul 7 14:37:32 2015 UTC,It runs off of the Wotlk client. So it's the only one you need. Primalwow website has a good how to guide as well.
wowservers,3cd031,tdkid21,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:44:59 2015 UTC,"Just leave the version on WotLK. It's still capped at 60, it's just there for when the future expansions launch. No need to fiddle at all."

wowservers,3cd031,Somnu,6,Tue Jul 7 05:54:17 2015 UTC,"You can only reach the 31 point capstone.  For example, you cannot get dual-wield as a Shaman but you can get Stormstrike (both on the same tier of talents)."

wowservers,3cd031,Akashic3000,2,Tue Jul 7 12:52:17 2015 UTC,Been having a lot of fun here after raiding and leveling on other vanilla servers. Leveling is fast and i don't feel like gouging my eyes out playing a warrior (my main) with shitty skills and talents. RDF is fun. So far the devs have been very open to ideas and communicate with everyone a lot about bugs and raid progression. Planning on raiding here for a while. See ya there!

wowservers,3cd031,Cleofatra,4,Tue Jul 7 14:26:20 2015 UTC,"yes indeed you need more, but I can see you have a great fan base supporting the server. All the best!"
wowservers,3cd031,choolete,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:56:06 2015 UTC,"The scripts here blow, it is stock core which looks nice because of the amount of vanilla scripts that were fixed by default in trinity core but there are still tons of bugs. If it is using truewows core than it is still in a sorry state and the vanilla content is definatly stock. Also their idea of balancing vanilla encounters is nerfing damage by 50% which just makes the fights take 2x as long. Interesting idea but very lazy implantation and design."
wowservers,3cd031,survivethisyo,4,Tue Jul 7 14:44:16 2015 UTC,"Yea we are working with the Devs to make the experience more enjoyable and balanced.  The cool thing is that they are VERY active, often attending/viewing our Molten Core raids and make changes based on community input.  This might be because they are small and need to appeal to the player-base... but either way it is refreshing to get daily feedback from Devs.  For instance they buffed trash HP too much in Molten Core and listened to the community so they are reducing it.  They fixed bugs from the first MC raid within the week and have overall been very receptive to suggestions."
wowservers,3cd031,Cleofatra,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:23:44 2015 UTC,"This server sounded good in concept, but they are changing things about classes to be non blizzlike because they want to balance them. Not sure how I feel about that."
wowservers,3cd031,plopzer,7,Tue Jul 7 00:43:31 2015 UTC,I like that it is a sort of a fresh take on Vanilla content.  I've done vanilla content on a vanilla patch before.  I want to experience my favorite raids from a new angle /  character role that isn't possible in pure Vanilla.
wowservers,3cd031,Cleofatra,5,Tue Jul 7 03:53:34 2015 UTC,"Why would that even be bad? I hardly doubt that Blizzard wanted some specs to be horrible for PvE during Vanilla, and why wouldn't it be funnier to see some boomkins, ret paladins, maybe even BM hunters in raid? Thats actually cool. There's ton of Vanilla servers who are trying to be a replica of how it was during retail, which you might want to try then :P (If Im right Nost is also going to upgrade xpacs?)"
wowservers,3cd031,ShaankZ,3,Tue Jul 7 11:54:24 2015 UTC,Can confirm- I am a BM hunter doing good DPS in raids.  Feral DPS and Boomkin are also viable!  Haven't seen a good Ret or Tank Pally though as of yet.
wowservers,3cd031,Cleofatra,5,Tue Jul 7 16:36:40 2015 UTC,"Well, with the oddly itemized vanilla gear and the updated talents/wrath scaling, it would be worse if they did not make balance changes."
wowservers,3cd031,Iwasapirateonce,4,Tue Jul 7 09:50:21 2015 UTC,Not being able to get a mount till level 40 in 3.3.5 is also not blizzlike. What's your point?
wowservers,3cd031,coolfangs,2,Tue Jul 7 02:23:16 2015 UTC,It's Blizzlike for vanilla. Which is the expansion the server is emulating on the wotlk client.
wowservers,3cd031,shilofax,-3,Tue Jul 7 03:15:49 2015 UTC,Because we're in Vanilla so every thing is set up to be like Vanilla noob

wowservers,3cd031,plopzer,0,Tue Jul 7 02:16:55 2015 UTC,"Its just from my experience playing on the server. Things like life tap have non blizz-like coefficients and scaling. I assume this is because it is overpowered/underpowered in the current raiding environment (fwiw, I'm not 60 yet). But it just seems disingenuous to me."
wowservers,3cd031,svn,0,Wed Jul 8 22:28:32 2015 UTC,Like what?

wowservers,3cd031,newslooter,-1,Tue Jul 7 19:56:23 2015 UTC,"It's a cool concept in all, but doing old content in later versions gets rid of any real challenge and the experience won't be the same.  For example I did a Black Temple run back in WOTLK with about 15 level 70 players. The content was made much easier due to raid and class changes."
wowservers,3cd031,Silez,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:33:02 2015 UTC,"That's not what this server is. It's more like a progression server, except you progress through expansions like how the games use to be released."
wowservers,3cd031,trmpah,-2,Tue Jul 7 04:18:14 2015 UTC,"If you are playing just to experience old content then it's great. If you want to want the game to feel like it actually did and have some challenge like it was before, I wouldn't recommend it."
wowservers,3cd031,IIIIIIIIIIlIl,3,Tue Jul 7 04:57:01 2015 UTC,"If you want the game to feel like it did back then there are nostalrius and kronos to cover that demand.  Why are people so square when it comes to servers that diverge slightly from the standard run-of-the-mill ""blizzlike""?  This server provides a different experience. The combination of Azeroth content with some of the quality of life updates of wotlk is a welcome alternative to the endless cookie cutter 1.12.1 and 3.3.5 servers."

Still the major bugs is at 11% complete after a month of me looking at that progression.  The new test on the 4th opened 191 new bugs/encounters and they have fixed 22% of those so far, plus added to the list in other spots.  If it was me I would do what this guy suggested on their forums.    Re: Status Update & Upcoming Test Honestly this is just bad business now in my opinion. People have been waiting for this server for years. It's never going to be perfect just release it and let us try it out and fix bugs a long the way. This is getting ridiculous.    *- pobiakc *   Look at it this way: The sooner an unpolished server gets released, the sooner you'll quit playing on it afterwards. Thus it doesn't matter when, but in what state is it released. The hype is fading because people are slowly forgetting about this server. Once it's out, they'll be coming back. I suggest you do the same. Instead of being impatient like your life depends on it, just go play something else in the meantime. The more you forget about this server, the more you'll be surprised once it's out. It may sound utterly dumb, but it's true."
wowservers,3cfepb,dungeonjay,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:58:31 2015 UTC,"Excellent post.  We all thank you.  My idea of ""soon"" is more in line with Blizzard's concept of ""soon"".  I would still consider 1-2 years to be relatively soon for launching this server.  I should have said a couple years instead of soon.  I still wouldn't dedicate tons of time on a TBC server when a better one is coming along in the future.  Excalibur is probably the best bet for a server available right now."
wowservers,3cfepb,thewallofsleep,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:22:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks man.  Not really saying you were biting at the bit to get on Corecraft like that post quote exactly replied but the sentiments are there in saying spend time elsewhere especially if you want to play TBC.  I will give a suggestion in general to anyone that says I'm waiting and not investing time in a TBC server.  What if it never opens?  We are relying on two guys to basically make this happen.  Life can get in the way of that.  But, before I say more perhaps this link might get where I'm going with waiting for something to happen....and it is very Bliz-like in nature... <wink> http://www.polygon.com/2014/9/23/6833953/blizzard-cancels-titan-next-gen-mmo-pc"

wowservers,3ccejd,newslooter,9,Mon Jul 6 20:38:15 2015 UTC,"I think it's a combination of several factors. For one thing, private servers are finally getting a reputation of being actual recreations of past expansions, and not just shitty fun servers as they all used to be. Private servers are also getting much better in quality, with servers like Nostalrius, Kronos, Dalaran, etc. And I think people are just getting sick of the casualization that Blizzard has done to the game in recent years, and would like to relive to glory days."
wowservers,3ccejd,coolfangs,5,Tue Jul 7 12:27:32 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to say, Vanilla servers seem to be undergoing a renaissance of popularity atm.  TBC seems to be fading away however, which is sad.  Cata and Wrath realms are always pretty popular."

wowservers,3ccejd,killerwife,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:03:32 2015 UTC,"Corecraft is definitely a big reason why TBC servers are in decline. I just don't want to spend a week of /play leveling only to reroll on a server that my entire guild will move too when it gets released.   @OP  there is a few reasons but retail being worse than ever before is a big one. I would also say that the hype around nostalrius has advertised private servers to many wow players but also the fact that the quality of private wow servers has increased.   It was like 3 years ago where i was leveling on the most popular TBC server, a highrate P2W that had been up for many years and overpower didn't even work in PvE a bug which had been reported 2 years prior to me playing, i don't remember what the server was called. Or pvping on smoulderforge getting 7-9 rage per swing with a S3 epic weapon on a clothy."
wowservers,3ccejd,yolkol,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:07:09 2015 UTC,The problem is Excalibur is a shit server too with nerfed content and free gear. There just isn't a single good blizzlike tbc server at the moment.
wowservers,3ccejd,Anesthesize,2,Tue Jul 7 15:00:22 2015 UTC,I was just wondering the same thing. It would be interesting to pull census reports on our favorite private servers and put them together.

If i had known about them before I would of made the move hell of alot sooner though!"
wowservers,3ccejd,Phawkesy,2,Mon Jul 6 21:02:25 2015 UTC,"Right. I think the same thing happens when people are searching for servers as well. It's hard to sift through so many servers, and this also causes population fragmentation. The biggest resource, the top lists, aren't always a good indication of which servers are good."
wowservers,3ccejd,Phawkesy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:13:04 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. It is all a little daunting and overwhelming at first to be honest with all the different servers. I guess all people can really do is try which ones interest them and see which ones they like the most. Overall though, I've been impressed with the quality of the servers I've tried and how nice the people I've come across are.   I think that the legal issue may put some people off too. I have no clue what the legal issues surrounding playing on private servers are however, but in the end I decided that if blizzard etc arnt going to make a game people want to play then it serves them right if people look elsewhere"
wowservers,3ccejd,Driver969,2,Mon Jul 6 21:35:32 2015 UTC,"Right. I just wish some private servers took more liberty than simply copying everything Blizzard did with their versions. For example, improving systems Blizzard never cared about like WPVP incentives."
wowservers,3ccejd,thewallofsleep,2,Mon Jul 6 21:38:08 2015 UTC,"Been playing since vanilla retail, loved tbc, loved wotlk even more. Cata was garbage and caused me to quit. Haven't played MoP or WoD. Been playing Vanilla and TBC servers since then (since they tend to be the highest populated than Wotlk)"
wowservers,3ccejd,KosmosBOOM,2,Tue Jul 7 00:09:12 2015 UTC,"I didn't actually learn about private servers and how they work until Warlords of Draenor.  I'd heard the name private server, but didn't know how to access them or any of that.  It's very telling that I didn't take the time to check them out until WoD was unleashed on us.  It killed retail for me."
wowservers,3ccejd,dungeonjay,2,Tue Jul 7 11:13:43 2015 UTC,"I've been playing private servers since Cata. I hated how they raped the old world. MoP had very little appeal to me, so I skipped it. And WoD is a big pile of shit."
wowservers,3ccejd,dungeonjay,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:41:48 2015 UTC,"How do you stay playing the same content for so long? Even I, who didn't play extensively throughout WOTLK, can't really look forward to playing it that much since I've seen a lot of it already. What do you spend your time doing? Do you think a majority of players who play this way just never had a chance to do all of the raids in retail etc?"
wowservers,3ccejd,dungeonjay,2,Mon Jul 6 20:45:06 2015 UTC,"The same can be said of someone that plays chess everyday?  Just because the pieces are the same doesn't mean that what you do remains the same.  PVP always offers a variety of encounters that differentiate itself from the previous encounter.  Sure, raids could become mundane and useless if you have acquired the max gear.  Maybe you like the guild you are in and enjoy helping others reach max gear as well.  Maybe, it isn't about the gear anymore but the experience while raiding.  Just because the content has lulled doesn't mean the game isn't fun.  It comes down to, perhaps, liking the gamestyle, mechanics and working environment that you are playing in.  I mean, the list can be endless here."
wowservers,3ccejd,rey2089,2,Mon Jul 6 20:56:49 2015 UTC,"To be fair, in the high end game of Chess, it mostly revolves around the players ability to memorize patterns and certain plays. In the same way the high end experience of WoW can be simplified as well. That's one reason games like Starcraft have stagnated while games like MOBA have more of an allure to PVP, since the game actually keeps changing with balance fixes and new hero implementation.   However, I think I agree more about PVP being dynamic, but I was under the impression that PVP wasn't exactly active on private servers. Am I wrong under this impression?  I can see PVE being fun meeting new people. But from my point of view, I see it hard to understand how running encounters already done would be more fun than running new encounters in retail. However, I've never been one to reread or re-watch movies or revisit much old entertainment at all, unless I really really like something inherently unique in it that I haven't found elsewhere. That just might be it for some people I suppose."
wowservers,3ccejd,KosmosBOOM,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:08:16 2015 UTC,"I'll start from the bottom on that.    I think you smacked the ball out of the park when you mentioned re-hashing material over like a movie or a good book.  That fits a certain mentality and I will be the first to admit that re-running old raids isn't particularly my cup as tea as well.  However, I do pvp and it becomes beneficial in certain expansions to obtain raid gear for certain in-slot gear for arenas.    PvP is a very active model in private servers.  Sometimes, more so, than actual PvE.  Depending on the server you play their might be battlegrounds or arena popping all day long.  In this sense, I get back to the gamestyle, gameplay and mechanics I mentioned.  Certain people may like a particular model that Blizzard used in one of the expansions of World of Warcraft and now just linger around that for PvP encounters.  I, myself, could pvp all day on Wrath 3.3.5a and be content.    There is so much to explore and interact in this open world setting.  With the advancement of the expansions, private servers have a wide variety of features to offer.  This could be enhanced stats, custom instances, custom races and classes, PvP only servers and many more different varieties.  There is even a couple DayZ style mods being worked on as we speak to be released for the private server sector.  Whatever World of Warcraft left behind, the bread crumb was extensive and people are picking up the pieces and remolding the loaf into their own vision."

wowservers,3cdvxz,Welcoem,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:26:56 2015 UTC,I agree. I run the largest guild on Dalaran and I am sick of the bugs I see. I have 3 80s and the bugged quests in NR are really awful. Not to mention the level 80 dungeons which always have bugged bosses that one shot you or have bugged mechanics (Nexus giant boss).

wowservers,3cdvxz,sirhalos,3,Tue Jul 7 10:14:48 2015 UTC,"You are stuck in combat and the only way to get out of combat is alt+f4 (cmd+esc for Macs). It usually occurs when you aggro something but it doesn't have a path to attack you, which results in you being stuck in combat. For example in Blackfathom Deeps when entering the chamber room to fight the orc necro boss you will aggro the nessie type of thing under it, but they won't be able to come and attack you. Another example is the Razorfen dungeons when you are higher up but aggro something on a lower level, but it doesn't have a path to attack you and you are stuck in combat (this doesn't mean it keeps trying to follow you the whole time). In both cases you shouldn't be aggroing those mobs and even if you did you should be able to drop aggro once you are out of range. This seems to work just fine if you get aggro and then run out of range. This case seems to occur if you get aggro and fight something and during your fighting you get aggro from another mob that doesn't have a path to fight you."

wowservers,3cccxu,newslooter,2,Mon Jul 6 20:27:04 2015 UTC,World pvp was really strong in vanilla.  From watching streams Nostalrius seems to have pretty active world pvp.

It'll take you a while to get to 60 and whilst levelling you can do tons of world pvp. When you get to 60, some people will outgear you no matter what, but there's always players with crappier gear, or people who just aren't as good players as you.

Other notable servers such as Atlantiss, Dalaran, Gamer-District and etc are good but don't fit in what you want from the XP rates so  the choice is clear unless you speak fluent Russian in which case you can consider WoW-Circle alongside Warmane.  In the end, it's you who will be playing it so do what you think is best."

wowservers,3c8r2o,helldeskmonkey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:00:07 2015 UTC,"I somewhat agree with that statement.  Why add to the imbalance?  The reason Stormwind was rushed so easy is that the population is becoming increasingly unbalanced on Dalaran.  At this time, I believe it would be best to promote Alliance versus Horde for that server.  Not only if they are more Alliance there will be more PVP but also more Wintergrasp, more skirmishes, etc.  If anything....people that come to Dalaran should be rolling Alliance to even the ratio back up.  Although he's 70/30 is a little off it isn't off by far.  It is closing in on an 60+/40 imbalance last time I checked."
wowservers,3c8r2o,dezzil,2,Mon Jul 6 00:16:01 2015 UTC,"It's not really that imbalanced. The population is well in the hordes favour but not by a margin that ruins the server. The alliance killed all the horde leaders relatively unchallenged recently too, and we control wintergrasp more often than not, at least at EU times."

(i.e insta 80, arena focused, battlegrounds, possibly custom stuff) or just a realm that is in PvP mode?  If it's the later, most WotLK servers are in PvP mode. Try Gamer-District, 7x, pretty well populated, well scripted, has Wintergrasp and there are Battlegrounds 24/7. Arena season just ended yesterday but there's another coming soon I guess.  If it's the former, there aren't that many realms, there's Blackrock which is in Warmane, former Arena-Tournament, and there's KargathWoW that for all I know might be already gone."
wowservers,3c975l,mixd3,2,Mon Jul 6 09:39:39 2015 UTC,I think he means arena/bg servers and that's Blackrock and Kargath WoW. Theres also WoW Legends by drainerx but not sure about it atm

wowservers,3c6xha,KnaxxLive,0,Mon Jul 6 15:44:15 2015 UTC,"Keep watching videos of individual bosses. Make sure you pay attention to the details as there might be some subtle tips (for important parts such as when to taunt off the MT) that are key to the fight.  After you watch or read an in-depth guide, I would go over to wowiki (or perhaps a more reliable source) and read over that for a more broad view to make sure you understand the important parts and get a general feel to how the boss works.  I'm not too sure on the consumables for a tank in wotlk, but I would try and bring the essentials such as stamina flasks/food.  A big part to being a successful tank is being vocal with your raid. Let them know when you're about to pull, what to kill first, etc. Normally your main tank/raid lead will cover this, but it's just as much your job as it is theirs.  The biggest thing in my opinion is just knowing the boss tactics. If you understand how the fights work, you'll be fine."

If that isn't a large enough server for you then you may want to checkout Warmane's Wrath servers or Nostalrius vanilla server.  Both have larger populations than Gamer-District.

They both, during peak EU time, are around the same.  Perhaps, this ghost town idea comes from the fact that the /who on Dalaran only shows population for the faction side you play on.  Which makes it seem they are a lower population realm.  Not sure why they do this when all other realms want to show exactly how many people are online(and some even add a little to those numbers to make them even seem bigger)."

wowservers,3c61z4,dungeonjay,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:01:31 2015 UTC,Sure.  Its based off a voting event each month and the amount of time the X4 stays active is up to how the voting event went.  At least that was the way its been the last few times I saw it.  All my toons on Excalibur are 70 that I play so I don't pay as much attention to that anymore.

You don't want to do a x1 server so that limits you further.  Try Excalibur or Feenix for TBC and for Cata I agree with Autism...has to be Atlantiss.

Has more non-English speakers on the realm than English but the split is like 70/30(which leaves enough to social with).  It is similar to Excalibur.  The core is actually a better core than what Excalibur runs on.  Just the limited English speaking killed it for me.

There hasn't been a server that nailed everything in one expansion perfectly. Yet. And I doubt there ever will be to be honest.  The reason that developers focus on one area before going onto the next is because they're usually volunteers with their own separate lives & jobs and it's a small team most of the time.  I think you're looking for custom servers, but those are usually pretty shitty and are almost always pay to win. Because most people don't have a pocket development company of the same size, magnitude, and skill as Blizzard.  And most players don't want to download a trillion terabyte patch-whatever.mpq file just to be able to play on a server."

wowservers,3c1zvx,GGABueno,6,Sat Jul 4 00:49:51 2015 UTC,"Having never played wow before let me explain that as the expansions progresses sometimes it changes the landscape, quest hubs and the storyline.  The first three expansions kept pretty much all the main ""continents"" in place with the same quests.  So, if it was me.  I would look for a decent complete Wrath server to do this on.  You have a couple really viable choices here as follows: Dalaran - Great endgame Raid scripting Decent overall quest scripting completeness Slow leveling(to actually enjoy the quest lines in an appropriate level range) but it can be sped up with a friend and using RaF tool at x3 experience Going into releasing ToC content    Gamer-District: Increased xp rate(x7) with interchangeable xp rate(back down to x1 if you want) Great overall scripting ICC released content     Warmane: Variable exp rate(soon, they have a x7 and they are launching a x1) Quest scripting available Raiding/dungeons etc. ICC released content    Out of all of them Dalaran is probably the most focused on endgame content scripting(raids) then any of the other two but isn't fully released into ICC(which is the last raid available for the Wrath expansion).  This is okay and shouldn't be a consideration when I tell you that ICC released servers primarily only focus on the very last raid and it is hard to find Naxx/Ulduar(previous raid tier content leading up to ICC) raid groups unless you try to make them yourself.  In this essence, I believe that Dalaran is the more PVE-oriented server but that isn't saying the other two don't PVE raid all the time as well but you will hit the pivotal ending of the content a lot faster and skip some of the middle playing on ICC fully released servers unless you specifically try to form a group of like-minded people to raid older content on that expansion."
wowservers,3c1zvx,dungeonjay,5,Sat Jul 4 05:09:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the extensive explanation!  I think either Dalaran or Warmane are the way to go, is there anything that any of them lack? Like dungeons?  Unfortunate that WoW private scene lags behind the actual game that much! I hoped I could at least face Deathwing, and the game is already on Warlords of Draenor (which looks really cool too)... Maybe playing on Ragnarok private servers spoiled me, WoW seems to be much trickier."
wowservers,3c1zvx,dungeonjay,2,Sat Jul 4 05:23:25 2015 UTC,"Well you can.  You could also play on a Cata server like Atlantiss or Warmane itself.  The experience of questing would be more complete on Atlantiss but the population will be higher on Warmane.  The thing is, there is a major event that happens in Cataclysm that reshapes the world and you would lose some of the quest lore/raiding lore that you could experience first on a Wrath server.  So, the main reason I suggested Wrath is the world isn't destroyed by Deathwing yet....after you play through Wrath(chapter 1,2 and 3 in the series) then chapter 4 is Deathwing on a cata server.    That being said....Cata is the pivotal highest to go in an expansion and have any remaining decent qualities or virtues left....MoP isn't scripted well enough nor is Warlords of Draenor at least in the private server scene."
wowservers,3c1zvx,Ba11in0nABudget,-1,Sat Jul 4 06:33:07 2015 UTC,"If you're looking to face Deathwing that would be the cataclysm expansion, which there are very good servers to play this on. Namely, Atlantiss WoW is the absolute best Cata server. The scripting there is top notch all across the board. The only down side is, unless you're an EU player the population is kinda crap. Still though there is plenty of people to do stuff and enjoy the game."

I agree with several others that Dalaran will provide the most complete exp if you are ok with retail progression of xp (1x unless RaF). But skimming over these posts I did not see the one thing pointed out to you that you need to keep in mind.   You said ""I'm not interested in pvp in any form"". The only hitch to Dalaran is that all the servers it has in both realms are PvP servers. Meaning that in Contested areas (Redridge, Duskwood, Stranglethorn Vale, etc) you will be auto flagged for PvP (due to it being a contested area) and attackable by other faction players if they are in that area. Now that said, I have quested my Alliance character up to level 30 and have done all the quests inside those contested territories without seeing an enemy player but once or twice. However, there was a time that an enemy priest was griefing low levels by mindcontrolling the quest giver NPCs when you tried to turn in quests and would gank you if you ever started helping the guards attack them. This is in no way a daily norm that I have seen...but the possibility does exist in the fact that no Dalaran realm server is PvE strictly."
wowservers,3c1zvx,Cardshawrk,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:49:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for the warning! I'll keep that in mind.
wowservers,3c1zvx,Beefstaek,3,Mon Jul 6 18:28:09 2015 UTC,"Hey pal, I will tell you the same I just wrote here: http://redd.it/3c1tvx  Which is: Hey mate, I'd highly recommend you Dalaran, best raid scripts I've seen on a private server, with 1,8k-2k players online peak hours and x1 rates (you can use the x3 exp rates with RAF system tho). You can take a look to the raids here: https://www.youtube.com/user/DalaranWoWcommunity No server has their Ulduar, OS, Naxx...etc quality. There is a high PvE activity every day."
wowservers,3c1zvx,Cardshawrk,0,Sat Jul 4 00:51:26 2015 UTC,I believe warmane's cataclysm has all the endgame raids and dungeons so that is something to consider.
wowservers,3c1zvx,Beefstaek,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:40:40 2015 UTC,warmane is ok for pvp but for pve experience it is one of the worse ones. dungeons and raids work sure but they are either bugged to shits or boss abilities have simply been turned off so ppl can kill them and get the loot.  if you want really good pve experience you go to one of the better known x1 xp projects their pve stuff is properly fixed
wowservers,3c1zvx,oscar956,0,Sun Jul 5 08:03:34 2015 UTC,"You see and that is where lordaeron comes into play, so far from what I am seeing on that realm it looks like warmane actually did something called catched up, a few things still off still but according to them on their devlog they have all of their development team working on that realm. I am currently messing around on their PTR and that alone is already pretty damn impressive, can't say yet if its exactly like dalaran-wow in quality, which according to some people is just trinity core copy pasted but from I have seen so far it is pretty impressive, real question is will it hold up at end game content because that first impression I got was pretty damn strong."
wowservers,3c33lr,hunzisak,2,Sat Jul 4 08:13:34 2015 UTC,not that i am aware. you could probably start one and advertise it. it would make sense to have one to help with population growth.

wowservers,3c32dw,ukidono,0,Sat Jul 4 09:05:01 2015 UTC,You can't use Outland Enchanting or JC recipes until level 300?  He has to do the last 10 points from 290-300 on old world recipes.    Edit  In Wrath they changed it for the Wrath professions being lower than max level trainable.  You could pickup Wrath professions at 350 and start using cobalt bars/infinite dust/NR gems to craft material.
wowservers,3c32dw,dungeonjay,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:58:15 2015 UTC,I didt get it. I could have just wait till wotlk content and start from 350? Or should I just wait to reach lvl 70/80?
wowservers,3c32dw,AbareKiller,2,Sun Jul 5 11:26:52 2015 UTC,"You pretty much screwed yourself over mate. Ench and JC are two of the most expensive professions to level without gathering alt.  The fastest way to max a profession is to buy a kit from a seller (varies from server to server. This was a big thing in retail), followed by buying all the mats required listed in a guide (can be less expensive if you have an auction addon to scan for bargain, but it'll take longer), but some server don't have a big enough economy to fuel this.  Your best option right now is to just level to 80, disenchanting whatever you don't need or from dungeons, then level an alt (DK are very helpful as they start with fast riding and 58) with double gathering, or gathering + crafting. The more crafting profession you have the cheaper enchanting is to level, but levelling crafting is expensive by itself."
wowservers,3c32dw,AbareKiller,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:53:57 2015 UTC,"You're right, what you don't know is that I'm leveling two characters at once using multiboxing. The other one has mining, so I get quite a few gold by selling mats. But still I'm not sure what to sell and what to keep for myself (for example I could sell Fel Iron bars, but I know I'll need to prospect a lot of ores to get gems). As of now I'm kinda stuck since I cannot use outland mats as other have said. I think I'll just level to 80 and then see if I'll have better finance."
wowservers,3c32dw,KnaxxLive,2,Sun Jul 5 11:25:17 2015 UTC,"Mentioning that in the first post would be better.  Make a DK now, and level LW (+ skinning if needed). Get LW to 290 and make the cheapest item from rugged leather that you can. Rugged Leather are easily farm able in blasted land from boars and such. Why LW? Guarrentied drop from animals instead of having to farm humanoid for cloth, doesn't share resources with JC.   Disenchant them for illusion dusts. Moving into outland, if you can regularly get dungeon groups, continue with enchanting, else just do JC.  As for JC, you don't need azerothian diamond. You can do Emerald Lion Ring from 290 to 300 with Huge Emerald, which is easier to get. Either way, on your mining alt, just run around getting Thorium and prospect them."
wowservers,3bzc8u,stoneharry,9,Fri Jul 3 11:03:26 2015 UTC,"This looks genuinely interesting, is there any quests to do or is it grinding? Also what client does it run on?"
wowservers,3bzc8u,Xallog,2,Fri Jul 3 11:21:45 2015 UTC,"As far as quests go I am quite undecided. Most of the development work I have done thus far has been to develop the core systems that will power the server and to start creating spells and visuals.  At the moment I am thinking it will be primarily grindy with some greater quests. One thing I forgot to mention in the original post is that all scourge zones are FFA flagged (free for all PvP). Quests could involve eradicating the scourge from part of a zone, helping npc's that have become stuck/injured and escorting them to safety,  killing a death knight, killing one of the 'leader' scourge. Leader referring to our scourge system whereby elites will spawn many normal scourge that follow the elite around randomly and spawn/die overtime constantly, so you have roaming small armies.  The main concern I am fighting at the moment links into this - how to keep the content enjoyable without being too grindy, how to keep spells balanced such that everybody doesn't chose the exact same options, etc. As much as I would love every single thing to be scripted, it becomes incredibly time consuming and filler content will be required in places.  edit: The client required is listed in the technical specification. We are using 3.3.5a as a base. We have the Blizzard patching system fully implemented so there will be no need to go through the hassle of installing MPQ's and setting realmlists."
wowservers,3bzc8u,Xallog,2,Fri Jul 3 11:36:53 2015 UTC,Have you thought about bonus objectives like used in WoD?
wowservers,3bzc8u,Xallog,2,Fri Jul 3 11:40:50 2015 UTC,"From what I remember, the bonus objectives just pop up when you enter a zone and are usually something like: 0/30 Horde slain, 0/5 bombs detonated...  We could implement this by having a quest auto accepted when you enter the zone that says the objectives, and it would be stupidly easy and quick to do. But this feels grindy. I think only through starting to actually write the game content chronologically can we see what the right balance is.  For the beta we are planning on only having Elwyrn Forest and Stormwind, one capturable city and one infected zone. The zone is the starter zone for all races and will have many scripted events and a lot of content possible to complete. First impressions are important so we want to spend a lot of time on this. A level cap of 10 will be used for this. Stormwind will remain a level 10 capturable city, and future content will be released for higher levels. It progresses chronologically like this, and does mean that a higher level player can come and probably recapture Stormwind when it resets after a week by himself (we are unsure if we want to prevent this)."
wowservers,3bzc8u,Xallog,2,Fri Jul 3 11:45:38 2015 UTC,Does that mean that there's a level cap that will increase over time? Kinda like on kronos etc where once you beat the content more will be released

The limitation here being I haven't actually figured out a way to automatically inject it yet. Both the Battle.net 2 protocol and Warden should implement module sending and it should be as simple as disable the RSA signature check, but the Warden implementation is pretty vaguely documented and it is hard to figure out. It should also be possible to just modify the binary to load an additional module, but I do not know how to do this."

wowservers,3bzc8u,TheAbyssDragon,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:39:13 2015 UTC,"Death Knights will not spawn in cities. Death knights strength is based on the dying players level, so it would be quite hard to grief (or at least time consuming).

We are aiming to introduce a lot of 'escape' type spells and also ways to trap players. Ranged attacks will be weaker. The spells that have a lot of utility will have a very long cooldown. This encourages multiple characters being played at once, provides a potential safety mechanic if you screw up, and prevents people just escaping easily every time. I've already introduced a few spells with 1 day cooldowns.  Bearing in mind that way more spells will exist than you can ever obtain - you have to pick and choose which ones you want. You could build entirely damage without any utility if you get offered the right stuff.  edit: Did you say one health? It's 1 life, as in, if you die you can't run back to your body. You have a lot of health points."

wowservers,3c14sz,dungeonjay,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:27:19 2015 UTC,Then what would you recommend for Vanilla and TBC for example?
wowservers,3c14sz,dungeonjay,5,Sat Jul 4 03:30:11 2015 UTC,"Well.  Each server has its own unique characteristics that differentiate itself from the other.  Release of content, xp rate, donate shop, vote shop.  As long as you find a server with a good peak over 1k+ it will still feel large enough because you will be stepping into a community unlike what Retail is like now.  You will recognize names, find a good guild(usually) one any of the servers.  But, if you are looking for constant pop on pvp/arena the choices are very slim and limiting.  Each vanilla server offers a different experience though for sure.  Kronos, Nostalrius, Valkyrie, Rebirth.  However, only two of those are over 1k pop Nost or Kronos.   TBC you have Excalibur, Hellground, Vengeance, Smolderforge(instant 70), Feenix.  Only a couple of those break 1k population.  Just what I'm saying is there are options to consider and you may want to browse through them until you find one that fits exactly what you are looking for to call home."
wowservers,3c14sz,IIIIIIIIIIlIl,5,Sat Jul 4 04:54:04 2015 UTC,Warmane has the biggest population for WOTLK at 3k players.

wowservers,3c14sz,Air_chandler,-7,Sun Jul 5 08:08:31 2015 UTC,I believe 30% or so of their population is currently being faked according to dodgykebaab's latest review so not quite true statistics.

There is gear that anyone can get and there is donor gear: copper, silver and gold. VIP players get copper gear for free in dungeon. Those that are not VIP or don`t donate can still get items that are on pair or stronger then copper items.So you can have copper and stronger gear without the need of being donor/VIP.

wowservers,3by0xu,grizzlytroll,3,Fri Jul 3 02:28:16 2015 UTC,I think they are getting greedy.  The reins are slipping so they are holding on tighter.  More expansions with a sooner release date.....less time actually fixing the problems within the expansion and instead trying to quickly brush it under the rug.  This wasn't a successful expansion in terms of player experience but it was successful for Blizzard's deep pockets.  They will listen to the community and remove garrisons.  They will continue to simplify the UI more.   I also think the days of seeing large content expansions is swiftly coming to pass.  The next few years will bring apart Blizzard attempt to hold onto a dying dynasty by releasing expensive content back to back in a desperate attempt to garner out as much money from the faithfuls before they close down the servers....just an opinion but I expect we will see WoW on retail for about another 5-7 years and then they will announce the door closing until there is nothing but the private server scene.

They will eventually just downsize their team to accommodate the decrease in players. They said themselves they expect at minimum another 10 years of content being made for the game. Then, even if the population has dropped bellow a million it will remain very profitable to run servers but stop adding new content (I expect, around this time, for blizzard to release servers for all the older expansions, to keep the people left from being bored of the last piece of content released)"

wowservers,3bweev,Autismmprime,18,Thu Jul 2 18:26:20 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of comments that base the assessment of playing on older expansions as purely nostalgic reasoning.  If the fundamental gameplay, class mechanics and structure of the expansion pleases the player then that goes well beyond nostalgic purposes.  Since each expansion is adapted and updated and ever changing(sometimes for the worse) then it is only a natural precursory examination to see that players are playing on what ruleset they like the best.    I will give the basic prime example:  Dungeons & Dragons.....    There are still players that like the original Dungeon and Dragons rule-set and play world.  There are people that greatly enjoy the 2nd edition.  Then the 3rd.  Etc. etc.  My personal favorite ruleset was the first AD&D rules and the one that I enjoyed the most.  We are seeing this happening in the World of Warcraft setting.  For Dungeons and Dragons, it became availability of materials.  It is a lot harder to obtain old player's handbooks, compendiums and DM campaign settings because of they have stopped printing the material.  This problem exists somewhat in the private server section as well, as development and scripting plays a huge emphasis on our ability to enjoy the content of those expansions.  As time progresses, however, private servers will improve where it will still become harder and harder to find material on AD&D(My favorite) and less people likely to play with because of that not being available.    Where am I going with this? As time progresses, private servers will continue to have a surge and growth of playerbase since the material on hand isn't going away and they will have easy access to sample and delve into the later expansions.  The main barrier being lack of information on playing on private servers as a whole has limited and stunted this growth.  This barrier is slowly dissolving."

wowservers,3bweev,Air_chandler,2,Thu Jul 2 19:03:12 2015 UTC,Yeah pretty disappointed with the wod expansion which has caused a huge blow to the wow (retail) community which has caused a rise of pop for private servers shown through the rise of nostalrius. If the next expansion is as bad as wod blizzard would make a massive loss which is all the better to see the growth of the private server scene.
wowservers,3bweev,Beefstaek,2,Thu Jul 2 18:41:04 2015 UTC,there would be actually 1 thing that would bring me back to blizzard (did quit like 2 months ago after 10 long years)    if they added progression servers for every expansion and then just wiped them every 2 or 3 years and start new.  that would be one reason for me to quit pservers alltogether because you would then have servers with the actual and proper code
wowservers,3bweev,DrearyYew,2,Thu Jul 2 19:03:26 2015 UTC,"To me, it's Blizzard admitting indirectly that WoD was a failed expansion, and that they want to put it behind them. While people make Blizzard out to be completely out of touch with their playerbase (which has some merit, but is a complete exaggeration), they actually take the community feedback strongly into their decision making. The negative reaction to most of WoD has pushed them to either try to fix what they have created (which would be nearly impossible) or to put it behind them and start fresh with a new expansion.  Blizzard had to take risks going into WoD, and they did, but they just happened to fail. Blizzard has learned their lesson, and I expect a strong coming expansion.  A bit off-topic, but when stuff like this comes up, people always point to Cata as where things started to go wrong. The top complaints people have about the game are how the pvp balance is terrible and catering too much to the casuals. If that's the case, wouldn't WotLK be the more appropriate expansion to hate? WotLK was where we first started to see 'easy' heroics and raids. I can't comment too much on the state of WotLK pvp balance, but Cata's pvp balance was actually really good. Cata's opening tier of Raids and Heroics were also incredibly difficult and fun. IMO, Cata was one of, if not, the best expansion Blizzard has put out in the gameplay sense. I guess people just love the story of WotLK (myself included) so they don't want to point the finger at it. Just my 2 copper."
wowservers,3bweev,manbearkat,4,Thu Jul 2 19:31:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, WotLK was a great expansion, but it was when a lot of things that would hurt the game later on were created. Heirlooms, LFD, etc. You just didn't feel the effects until Cata and onwards."
wowservers,3bweev,AbareKiller,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:44:49 2015 UTC,"WOTLK started the casual train, but Cata marked when casuals truly took over WoW. First tier of Cata was hard, but it got nerfed 2 patches in a row because of complaints from the playerbase."
wowservers,3bweev,Beefstaek,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:39:25 2015 UTC,"yea well i guess this time they will be able to meet the expansion deadline they have set for themselves few expansions ago, after the icc fiasko(and ds after that and soo after that) they said no more 1 year long raiding content without new stuff, now it seemes they have just cut the developement in half for an existing expansion and pumped the recources into developing new addons.  but honestly since cata nothing surprises me anymore what blizzard does"
wowservers,3bweev,dungeonjay,2,Thu Jul 2 19:00:44 2015 UTC,it's sad :( Now it's on the shoulders of the devs working on private servers to keep me enjoying WoW...
wowservers,3bweev,wrath-wow,2,Thu Jul 2 19:03:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  More the reason to support them in these endeavors on whatever server you choose to play on.  Doesn't have to be monetary and can be as simple as word of mouth movement.  But, if we are going to continue to enjoy the game as we liked it back in (insert your expansion here), we will need to help them continue this to achieve our own playing goals."

wowservers,3bx4yz,only777,4,Thu Jul 2 21:48:03 2015 UTC,"To say they have the most working end game isn't really fair.

Edit: I didn't miss the point of the topic I just wanted to be sure to point it out so that anybody who reads this doesn't think warmane has better pve than Atlantiss."
wowservers,3bx4yz,Deflexure,5,Fri Jul 3 22:41:47 2015 UTC,"I agree mostly, but saying that Warmane has more working content than Atlantiss is a missunderstanding; Warmane has more OPENED content which is in terrible shape and has nothing to do with the proper game. Just compare the class scripts - Atlantiss has some minor issues, but EVERY glyph, EVERY spell is usable, while in Warmane you have critical bugs in core mechanics of specs and that ruins the experience for some classes. PvE content is something you can't even compare - if you ever been to Warmane's Firelands AND Blizzard's Firelands you will feel the difference. Atlantiss is pursuing the quality, while Warmane ONLY quantity (as of now at least). So the real choice is: if you want to rush through content pick Warmane, but if you want to taste the actual game: pick Atlantiss."

In reality the greatest server is where your friends are playing, after all you can have a 100% retail like private server but without a friend it might as well all be broken."
wowservers,3bx4yz,Cardshawrk,2,Fri Jul 3 00:46:14 2015 UTC,"I think it comes down to the fact that a lot of people don't really care if a level 11 quest works or not and some people just like the end-game raids and PvP.   In the end, you also have to realize that for some people, a private server is more than ""10 quests working or raids"". It's about their friends, family and the people they meet there. I know people that met on the ex-Molten and got married and they play today on Warmane.   The community is everything in the end, and it doesn't matter much if the server is 99% scripted if their community is a bunch of hateful people that piss on everything and think their server is the best because of the Hogger script.  I wish every private server well in terms of development but I wish more that you meet friends there and make connections rather than just kill 8 out of 8 mobs.

They have shown their awesome and constant work and it concluded on a crazy population increase: 200 player at first, 2.000 players online now. Freaking well deserved.  Aaanyways, I won't trust Molten/Warmane never, bad quality FOR YEARS, bad management, thousand of players characters weren't safe (100% of the characters DELETED TWICE) after years of progression and they lie constantly.

wowservers,3bu0ye,dungeonjay,6,Thu Jul 2 03:39:59 2015 UTC,"Here is my opinion on it, from player perspective and from developer perspective. I'm active around in the tbc scene since I started playing and developing wow, it have been more like five to six years.   There are a bunch of pretty decent tbc privat out there. The main problem is that 95% of the decent developed ones are national local server such as back2basics (german blizzlike tbc server - up to 1k ppl at peak), twinstar.cz or hellground. On twinstar and hellground you will be treated as scum if you are non polish or cz. THERE IS NO GOOD international blizzlike tbc server (or highrate) that can offer the quality that above servers can.  TBC is the only patch that is no longer supported by any open source project. I don't count projects such as cmangos-one and oregoncore in because those are dead a f or lead by people that have no clue how to code or actualy try to fix existing bugs rather then backport stuff from 3.3.5 or x.x.x branch and break even more things.  Most tbc source codes are terrible coded and if you are not willing to spent a year reading code and actualy try to understand how things work you can't fix a single major bug. We don't have anything like spell scripts, SimpleAI and so on. But also people don't put effort into backporting those things.  Only tbc servers that can offer class mechanic fixes / spell fixes are the ones that hire paid devs like Feenix (still shit), Twinstar and Smolderforge.  About CC: The have seriouse issues with random bugs such as armor disappearing, players getting teleported randomly around, sometimes everything breaks, the thing is that they don't even know what triggers those bugs and IT CAN TAKE MONTHS to debug such things. If they don't manage to find the bugs we will never see a release from it. Otherwise from that they are doing a good job but trust me, every pvp player will hate this server because it will feel so laggy because of the spell delay system they implemented.  For a players point of view: I hate leveling, every highrate server or instant server has a shit concept. If you wanna pve: check out national local servers. If you wanna pvp: check out Smolderforge"
wowservers,3bu0ye,robinsch,3,Thu Jul 2 07:33:50 2015 UTC,If you take a look above the water it's fine. Deeper mechanics don't work at all.
wowservers,3bu0ye,robinsch,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:17:32 2015 UTC,"Can you go into a few specifics on the deeper mechanics you're talking about?   Admittedly, I know nothing about coding/scripting/etc. But, I've started playing on Excalibur within the last couple months and, although I don't have a lvl 70 character or done much instancing, it seems pretty good, by and large. I haven't come across bugged quests, although I've heard from others about a couple they encountered. The main problems I've seen are 1. random server disconnects that affect a wide group of people. and 2. enemies that are stuck out of LoS or inside a tree and will occasionally reset combat.  I'm happy with the server, in general, since it's free and I haven't put any money in it. But, if there are real issues in end-game, I'll be disappointed. I don't do BGs or PvP much, so those issues bother me less."
wowservers,3bu0ye,arxe,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:44:40 2015 UTC,"That is the TBC server I currently play on myself but it does have issues.  Most are minor but I do agree if you spend time on there you will notice it.  I, also, agree that Smolderforge offers the best PVP experience so far for TBC just that it dies out as a NA populated server and the only time I can catch matches is if I play during EU time.    I wasn't aware that there isn't any good open source projects available for TBC and that is a good reason why it seems like the step-child of the current three expansions that are most polished available.  Since most private servers are ""community"" projects with the idea of someone still cashing in I can see how this would be extremely hard for competitors of each other to actually offer their fixes and make a better universal code like Wrath has experienced."

If these so called Kronos fanboys would like to have 8k players on the server they play on, they'd just switch to realms with awesome pop like Nos, right?    You'd think so, but apparently it's LAGGY (almost level 41 on that server and I live on the East Coast US. It's really not bad unless the population hits 9,000+ Sure there are crashes once in a blue moon but you really have to account how many people are playing at that moment.) and BUGGY (I've only seen a handful of quests that don't work so far, and they're all in Desolace.) and yadda yadda some other bullshit.  The real factor we all have to take into account here is that these kronos fanboys have invested so much time on their characters on a realm, which is time that they'll lose forever if they go to Nostalrius. They covet the popularity Nostalrius has, so they try to do whatever they can to get some of it. I've seen some kids here go so far to say that Nostalrius, a server that obviously won't receive any benefit from more population other than paying more for better hardware because they don't accept donations, fakes their population count by some absurdly large number.  Ten minutes of playing and you'll see that population really can get to 9,000. However, character transfers makes no sense because it is absurdly easy to fake that I have a level 60 with full t3 or whatever on Nostalrius and get a level 60 with full t3 or whatever on Kronos."

Well for Europeans players the population is great, not lacking in the slightest. For NA players, its a different matter."
wowservers,3bsvdp,Struckd,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:37:30 2015 UTC,"Having a large NA player base for any private server has been a substantial problem for quite some time.  I believe it mostly delves into the area of fear mongering.  You see it on the Battlenet forum boards or other forum boards when this is mentioned.  They still bring up the lawsuit from four years ago as a pinnacle of why they shouldn't play on private servers.  Until this stigma(at least that is what I consider it) vanishes and players understand the quality, and ability to actually play on these servers without fear of losing their accounts on Battlenet(which unless you are blunt about it and state in Trade on Retail it doesn't happen), then the NA playerbase will still remain relatively small and huddled together in the servers that have already harvested their playtime."

That happened literally ONCE on Nostalrius after Sodapoppin advertised the shit out of it. Since then, it's been back to 7k maximum peaks. It starts lagging at close to 6k though.

Also, from 11 PM GMT Friday to 11 PM GMT Sunday, they hold Double-exp weekend in which EXP rate increases to 14x. I happened to be on such weekend when I was around lv45ish, Searing Gorge quests were awarding 88k EXP each and mob kills around 5k EXP (not rested). Add to that, you can also get referred by someone who plays there already and get 2x EXP until Lv60. That means that under Level 60 and during the weekend, you'll be getting a 28x EXP rate.

Automatic quest tracking was added in 1.12 (the client vanilla servers uses): Automatic Quest Tracking has been added to the game and is turned on by default.

Then again, i have only been ally on both servers and leveled to 60 on both.  I did all the quest exactly the same and Kronos had 99% of the quest working but nostril only had 70%.

So, if you want to figure out how to fix population issues... maybe figure out what's causing people to join, start a char or two, and then quit shortly thereafter.

wowservers,3bs6du,Aodhyn,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:31:56 2015 UTC,"For whatever reason Nost won the majority of the vanilla population playerbase.  It cost a lot of servers the ability to showcase their work because of population numbers.  Unfortunately, at this moment, it is a losing battle for supremacy in the vanilla market.  So, for whatever it is worth the vanilla experience, ""as it once was"" is shattered either way you go simply because one is way too overpopulated and all else are underpopulated.  Average server size should be around 2k-3k people period.  That is the prime Vanilla experience and no one really offers that."

When you do a /who on Dalaran you are only viewing one side of the population and it is not setup like Nost and showing a total.    I live in NA (east) as well.  Here is a list of servers to consider: 1.  Dalaran(Wrath) 2.  Excalibur (TBC) 3.  Nost(Vanilla) 4.  Warmane(Variable expansions)    Two of those use a fake population count to enlarge their population numbers but it is a small percentage.  Dalaran and Excalibur do not.    You play on Nost.  Which is a great populated server for NA players.  Hands down.  I like Excalibur.  Good NA pop'd server as well.  Dalaran isn't bad at East Coast night-time as well man.

So, since the servers handle mostly Windows OS based clients and is supported by many older versions, I am going to hazard a guess that they are using some form of object-oriented language (such as C++, C#, .NET, etc.). It would also need to be a Windows-friendly language such as the above as well to account for DirectX integration for graphics texturing, shading, etc.   My theory is that it is probably a combination of languages handling different aspects of the game (Core game engine, UI, graphics rendering, etc) that is compiled and run from the servers. I do not want to discourage you, please by all means look into how to learn these things if you want to help out.

wowservers,3bhy73,7Thega,2,Mon Jun 29 13:00:17 2015 UTC,"The reason that the hairstyles are missing, are most likely because that nearly all WoD models except for Gnome Male and Tauren Female, have a polygon number past 65535. WOTLK doesn't support a polygon count past 65535, the only other expansions that does is MoP.  The feature where the faces change expression depending on the face, is not working either.

wowservers,3bkkyc,tacalacataca,2,Tue Jun 30 12:54:29 2015 UTC,Probably because the server is already well established to the point people want full epics to do heroics.  And it's totally pay to win.

Most karazhan entry raids are inspected at A'dal and looking for people not in greens with blues and socketed enchanted like you give a damn about your character.  If you played on there you would know this.     Also, this is ridiculous about Excalibur and the P2W.  Gamer-District offers better gear in their payshop and I see people speaking about how great that server is left and right.

I have seen that firsthand on that server and a few others as well.  Elitism at its best.  I found enjoyment on Excalibur by going with a good decent guild on both faction sides.  Usually, or what I recommend, is find a guild that has a number of 70s but is new and looking to progress.  Usually this works out the best."

wowservers,3bkkyc,dungeonjay,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:02:40 2015 UTC,"Probably because scripting and class mechanics are sub-par, even worse than Feenix. It feels like a glitchy default mangos core with some bandaid fixes applied to raid content.   I have PvP'd on there and watched others play PvE. I have also done both on Feenix, which was almost just as disappointing.  That being said, OP should wait for a half-decent TBC server to come out."

wowservers,3bj66z,Agent17,2,Mon Jun 29 18:04:14 2015 UTC,"The thing is, Truewow has 400-480 peaks and Dalaran WoW has 1900 player online peaks, plus the raid scripting is by far much better on Dalaran. However, it also depends on if you like the progressive system or not, Dalaran is an eternal progressive server which is done to bring the old days back, this is great in my opinion. And Truewow has everything opened, which means just level 80 and step into ICC (again, the raids aren't as good as Dalaran's).  Since Dalaran has improved a lot the leveling experience and overall world scripting, I'd rather suggest this server for all kind of players unless you hate the x1 rates, in which case I'd recommend GD."
wowservers,3bj66z,mewcat4,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:22:01 2015 UTC,"Here is the thing.  Truewow is offering transfer's from Retail.  If you played and leveled up to at least lvl 80 with a couple screenshots you are in business on that server.  This is a big positive.  However, they do not have a working Wintergrasp.  Both are about the same in terms of scripting.  One has ICC fully released and the other is a ""true"" progressive realm where you have to accomplish tier raiding to progress.   So, I'd put some thought into either but I would definately take Truewow up on their offer if you have that available to at least give it a trial run.  Currently, I play on Dalaran at this time having spent some time on Truewow and felt that was the move for me.  Everyone is different."

wowservers,3bj66z,mewcat4,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:51:01 2015 UTC,"Yes.  But, what I am saying is that Truewow offers the opportunity for a straight to 80(if he has a retail account) to let the OP try it himself.  I play on Dalaran as well and the winner for me wasn't the raid scripting but that it had a working Wintergrasp.  So, everyone likes different things.  Also, Truewow is fully released ICC version and Dalaran isn't.  There are variables here to present to him.  I always feel it best to present the differences between the servers on how they are offered first.  There will be enough people saying this is better or that is better that I don't need to fill that in."

wowservers,3bjh93,dungeonjay,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:53:24 2015 UTC,You will hear several suggestions but if questing is important I would steer clear of any expansion MoP and above.    The best questing I have found is Gamer-District with Dalaran being a close second.  Warmane doesn't focus on quests but their Wrath base server will have most quests working as well.  This is just suggestions in Wrath expansion and all are populated.

wowservers,3bj5vj,Struckd,2,Tue Jun 30 00:00:25 2015 UTC,"I doubt it, there are a few good TBC servers already out there. They just havent done the whole spiel which CC, Kronos and Nos have done. Which is work offline, advertise, hype it up and release, to get those initial players.  Vengeance could easily steal the scene if the developers decide to take it offline for 6 months and hype it up. In doing so that might also spur CC into doing something...the reason why CC is lax is because it has no competition...so its just taking its time and sucking up all the love. A kick up the arse with a serious competitor can easily turn the whole scene around."

They're like Nostalrius/Kronos if they never came out.   I'll check it out when it eventually releases, but I'm happily playing on feenix atm. Excalibur is pretty good too as I'm leveling up there atm."
wowservers,3bj5vj,Air_chandler,3,Mon Jun 29 18:28:33 2015 UTC,Concerning bread'n'butter departure from the project is high speculation but is probable since the last contact he had to the community was last Christmas and his lack of presence in corecraft irc which is deeply concerning. However concerning if corecraft dying? Yes it is the hype for the server has significantly decreased over the massive disappointment for target goals for the server release being missed with a possibility we will have to wait longer for the server perhaps into next year when Shiro previously predicted for no longer than early 2015. We also see from the corecraft forums that activity has fallen from devs communication and community members with posts consisting only of frustration and off topic nonsense which is not helped by many boycotting corecraft members going off joining nostalrius and Kronos.

There is definitely a sharp decrease in development of custom projects. AC-Web used to have tons of listings of new servers back in 2008, now you can check there maybe once a month at most and still stay in the loop.  You could argue that we now have the knowledge/ability to do far more sophisticated things than in 2008, so it takes longer to make new servers, but there aren't many new developers entering the scene. Everyone at the top treasures their knowledge too much to help anyone anymore, and those at the bottom are too intimidated by all of the complexities of a private server. All you have to is check ac-web and see someone ask for help only to be told off, or told something they also obviously don't understand.  As a side note, I hope your project is going well. Looks solid. You're the only developer I even bother keeping up with anymore. I gave up a few weeks ago on development because I hit a wall with my weak knowledge c++."

wowservers,3bi65q,ricsi046,5,Mon Jun 29 13:41:56 2015 UTC,"""dalaran like realm""  ROFL, first, they arent and wont be dalaran like, main reason: RAIDS and instances quality. On molten raids will be bad, as always, and Dalaran has hyper polished raids... molten-warmane wotlk raiding sucks A LOT, after you have played servers like Dalaran or GD, you cant go back. even if they improve them somehow it wont reach dalaran and GD quality in years.  The people who have played molten and then dalaran or GD know what Im talking about.  They call it ""Hardcore""...wtf, no rdf and no p2w shop UNTIL you have done some raids... that is just ridiculous. So... now hardcore means just freaking blizzlike but without RDF like dalaran did for much time? they are just hyping the players with those words.   If you want a hardcore raiding realm, go dalaran, if you dont want to spend the time leveling, go GD even tho this is p2w, id rather go there than warmane after show MANY TIMES that WE CANNOT TRUST THEM.  bye bye"
wowservers,3bi65q,sharespirit89,-1,Mon Jun 29 13:02:19 2015 UTC,"Since when were warmane raids bad? They are some of the best scripted instances available at the current time across multiple expansions. A good example would be dragon soul for cata, and icecrown citadel for wotlk. Does dalaran even have ICC yet? And why did dalaran not have RDF? Because they could not script it yet or lacked a proper development team to get that done? I highly doubt it was because it was intentional. At least with Lordaeron they put that clearly in everyone's mind as that is how the realm will be. Also since molten merged with arena tournament to form warmane I HIGHLY argue that your claim is truthful, especially since warmane has the best pathing now compared to any other private server."

Dalaran had RDF opened on Kirin Tor even before Algalon's release, with ALL the raids released, for your information. And ICC, was insanely better than warmane's (back on Kirin Tor, imagine how it will be now on Algalon...).  Stop inventing.  You should inform yourself before start trashtalking a good server.

I can pm you the link as Im not sure if its allowed to post it here. But yea- Dalaran was fully functioning instantly after downloading. The only change is to set the realm which has a easy 3-step guide on dalaran site. Edit: im sorry i didnt answer the question compleatly, but I would say your best bet would be that."

wowservers,3bfee5,c0keh,2,Sun Jun 28 20:58:05 2015 UTC,the vanilla clients are usually the same. so you can download it from whereever you want. so you can also download it from kronos for playing on nastalrius.
wowservers,3bfee5,Autismmprime,4,Sun Jun 28 23:28:54 2015 UTC,"Nost and Kronos.. Both are good IMO. I had a hard time decising... For me playing in NA nost had some lag on my end when it was busy and there were almost too many people.. So I tried Kronos, had no lag, and not as busy but still seemed to be enough people.  But both are pretty solid. I head later in the game Kronos has fewer bugs/broken quests etc than Nost. But as I am not that far on both I cannot confirm. To me it doesn't seem like you can go wrong with either. I have no idea why people bitch and complain about either, or bash on the one they don't play. makes no sense."
wowservers,3bfee5,Knusperkeks,2,Sun Jun 28 21:01:10 2015 UTC,"I leveled on both Nostalrius and Kronos (11 on Nos, 10 on Kronos) then made the decision to stay on Kronos together with my buddy. I play Warrior, he plays Paladin. So far there hasn't been a single quest which isn't working properly. We're using the 'VanillaGuide' addon to progress through the leveling process. We played 24 hours over the course of 2 days (weekend) and got to lv 21.  I've been playing wow since 2004 (closed beta) until the first raid tier of cata got nerfed into the ground, and Kronos gives me an authentic experience which is closer to vanilla wow than any other server. I did play a bunch of classic servers, but this one is the only one I can truly recommend.  For what it's worth, I vote for Kronos."

Having 3x the max population is also not vanilla.   As for Kronos, the mounts are almost non-existent; if someone wants to spend $40-50 to get a cosmetic mount, have at it. Most that have bought a mount buy the old model epic mounts anyway. Character auction isn't as bad as it sounds; practically no one ever sells 60s. Just 30 and below. It has not impact on the game. The lowered respec cost is to encourage pvp as well as pve and is a side effect of the lower population. Low pop means less gold in the world."

wowservers,3besp5,shamirrele,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:03:28 2015 UTC,"Guys, just disregard this thread, OP is a notorious Kronos Fanboy or something round these parts. Although some of the points do have truth to them."
wowservers,3besp5,Pvt_8Ball,2,Sun Jun 28 23:51:11 2015 UTC,"It will never lose the population it has due to people 'waking up'.  It's a first come first serve in terms of population in this sort of vanilla industry of servers, regardless of the scripting. The only way Nost will ever lose population is naturally over time."
wowservers,3besp5,conorbg,4,Sun Jun 28 18:19:30 2015 UTC,"Thread not about Kronos, but from playing Both Kronos is for sure higher quality and you have to be retarded to deny that. But Nost has the population so most people coming to a new vanilla server will see that and go there regardless. If Kronos had some more people it wouldn't even be debatable that it is the better server."
wowservers,3besp5,Autismmprime,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:09:54 2015 UTC,"Sure, technically Retail WoW is higher quality than Nos also. But the reason I won't play Retail or Kronos is because there is an option for people to purchase characters which I believe greatly diminishes the fun of leveling."
wowservers,3besp5,toinetoine,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:24:55 2015 UTC,I see your point there. can you actually purchase them on kronos or just trade?

wowservers,3besp5,TheTruthAboutKronos,-5,Mon Jun 29 15:16:01 2015 UTC,"If there is a difference in quality, it's barely noticeable. The mind control bug which I reported ages ago, is still not fixed, and the server does have it's share of quest bugs.  However, a more compelling reason to join Kronos over Nost is perhaps the fact that Nost admins aren't known for arbitrarily banning its users for nono reason, as the developers of Kronos did(and furthermore, cencored my posts on their forums to try and avoid their mistakes). It's absolutely pathethic, really, that the server admins are willing to go to such lengths just to cencor me and their mistakes on their forums."

I was hearing about some bugged quests in desolace when I popped in. I only completed the kodo taming quest, which was fine, but I was too low level (32) to try any others."

wowservers,3bcxyo,rememberlol,-1,Sun Jun 28 18:11:48 2015 UTC,"This server wont succeed, the idea seems good for few people, but it has tons of things wrong thoughts and the people who is playing will notice them and leave. Not to mention the lack of testing and proper preparation before the server launch... not even the raids were properly tested! For the love of christ, you are supposed to be progressive and that is the main thing to do!  It'd be nice if you stop spamming so much to everyone looking for a wotlk experience, since your server is a custom server with different objectives and targets. Also stop spamming with the server every few days please...   I love TBC, and will never join you, I want a TBC experience, not a bad designed and poor prepared one. I bet the players who like Vanilla or WoTLK think in the same way. The admin has cherry picked things as his will, that is not blizzlike nor genuine, it feels more like a really poorly designed server with just few locked things."
wowservers,3bcxyo,pancinamio,5,Sun Jun 28 13:02:34 2015 UTC,Depends on each individuals definition of succeed.  I personally am playing on it for the time being and while yes molten core could have used more polishing before launch its not that big of a deal as it's not advertising a blizzlike experience.  I like the premise and so far the leveling has been good and the community helpful.
wowservers,3bcxyo,Rustoak,-8,Mon Jun 29 00:50:08 2015 UTC,So this server is like Nostalrius but with 6k less players?
wowservers,3bcxyo,acuuuu,10,Sun Jun 28 10:20:39 2015 UTC,No? It runs on a WotLK client so it's quit different.

wowservers,3be65i,pikunul,3,Sun Jun 28 12:01:40 2015 UTC,It would be dumb to have transfers to a Vanilla server. It's far harder to level in Vanilla as opposed to any other expansion.
wowservers,3be65i,H4Xx0R-PC,2,Sun Jun 28 12:18:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly, people could just level a characer on Atlantiss for example and transfer it."
wowservers,3be65i,zipzo6,0,Sun Jun 28 13:38:24 2015 UTC,Then make it only from nost. The only thing stopping me from playing on Kronos is the time I've put in leveling my characters. Losing days of played time with no reward is discouraging to say the least.
wowservers,3be65i,alexhjelm,3,Sun Jun 28 14:00:59 2015 UTC,The reward would be being a lvl 60 on Kronos instead of being a lvl 60 on Nost.

wowservers,3bbfp8,huskymuffintop,-2,Sat Jun 27 21:06:21 2015 UTC,"You have a point. It's trying to grow a feeling of security. It's still PR though, just like it was PR after the first character wipe (and before the second) when it was told backups were being done daily.  I just fail to understand why would anyone give Molten a third chance. Anyone with a memory at least. And this is... dubious! Storing your local data doesn't serve of anything... what if their database changes schema, as most servers that regularly update do? What if the encryption keys are wiped like I've wrote above? It's just PR, and I'm sick of seeing PR when their realms are in a deplorable state."

wowservers,3bbnvx,Suntys,3,Sat Jun 27 18:32:59 2015 UTC,WotLK -> Dalaran-WoW. Cata -> Atlantiss.  Atlantiss has character transfers from other private servers (other server has to be 8x or below rates atm) so I think the population might grow.
wowservers,3bbnvx,Hatchera,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:22:08 2015 UTC,How this transfer works? is it available in other realms?
wowservers,3bbnvx,choolete,2,Sun Jun 28 00:23:34 2015 UTC,"The transfer works in such a way that you can transfer a max lvl character from a x1-x3 (x8 for 1 week currently: temporary as it may be though) from a vanilla/tbc/wotlk/cata/(and maybe mop) server. The character will be on atlantiss as a lvl 80 with starter gear, bags, mounts and things like that."

wowservers,3bbnvx,KnaxxLive,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:33:10 2015 UTC,The character you transfer is max lvl from vanilla/tbc/wotlk/cata(and maybe mop)  After the transfer it will be lvl 80. You'll have to get to 85 yourself
wowservers,3bbnvx,BrandonzThrowaway,2,Sun Jun 28 13:08:43 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend Dalaran-WoW, peaks around 1600-1900 players depending on the day and the quality is marvelous.

For the haters, i play on Dalaran-wow now just because some friends but used to play on GD and i stand behind the fact that GD has better scripts. Dalaran just gets up-voted cause its ""Blizzlike(x1)"" and for Progression patch releases which isn't much cause it will one day be icc grind like any other server"
wowservers,3bbjg3,Sniprep,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:26:55 2015 UTC,"Except, not everyone wants to only farm ICC. Best patch on wrath was 3.1. You won't ever do ulduar when you can get ToC gear and never even think about stepping into naxx unless you want an achievement or trinket."
wowservers,3bbjg3,KnaxxLive,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:35:38 2015 UTC,Can you explain what is meant by progression patch releases?
wowservers,3bbjg3,KnaxxLive,2,Sun Jun 28 09:18:58 2015 UTC,"Surely.  Progressive patch releases means that even though the server is on the last patch of the expansion (3.3.5a for WotLK) all of the content is not playable until people complete the previous content.  For example, in Wrath, the first raids open were Sarth, Naxx, and EoE (and VoA, but that is always relevant).  The server would not let you do any other raids until you have beaten them all.  A little while after several groups beat the content, they would allow people to enter Ulduar.  I think Dalaran even forces you to have the achievement for these raids even IF they are letting others into the next patch of content.  After that, they will let people go into ToC.  After that is ICC and updated Onyxia.  This is really beneficial for Wrath Servers, because it means that older content is still relevant.  Wrath had a huge problem with that after patch 3.2, NO ONE was stepping into older content.  You would run the daily heroic, VoA once a week, and ToC (dungeon) Heroic every day, and ToC Raid and be done.  They had a Justice and Valor point system for a reward for each heroic, so you could basically buy better gear than that which would drop from the older raids, just for doing heroics.  ToC was insanely boring and several people quit during that time period.  They gated that raid by only releasing a boss each week, but we were still downing them after only a few attempts every Tuesday.  It was easy, and boring.    Progressive servers fix this problem by making you need to run old content.  Ulduar was the best raid ever made, in my opinion, and doing it and Naxx every week was pretty fun.  As well as going in to do Sarth 2D or 3D, and EoE made the game fun for a lot of us.  Once the 3.2 patch hit, the only option was to run heroics, and do a one room raid."

Do not trust people who say stuff like ""not even tbc raids are out - server is soo shit!"".  Part of the realm is, that it is a progressive realm. Things are being rolled out over time, and they have a Dedicated Test Realm, where all fixes are tested by players before being applied to live realm. Thanks to this, all of the released heroics/fixes are of excellent quality, probably best you have seen.

Bigpwnd, the dev at Arena-Tournament/Warmane worked on this type of stuff a while back when implementing a replay feature for arena matches.  What he did was to save specific packets that the server received from the moment the arena starts to when it ends, then store it on the server with an id and letting anyone watch that arena match ingame at any time later on. It looks exactly like it would if you would be spectating the match live.  Quite an amazing feat, I'm not sure how difficult it was to create it but you might have an idea of that"

About the replay system it's mostly knowing what opcodes to save, add a timestamp to them, create a new session / player class that will display all the actions.

wowservers,3b8yjn,Iwasapirateonce,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:20:05 2015 UTC,"Pretty much a lot of these exploits/tricks depend on the quality of the server-side data validations.  For example, up until retail Cataclysm, and on many wow private servers, the global cool-down timer was stored client side (on the users game client).  Obviously this was easily hackable, and by injecting new values into the variable, effectively the GCD could be reduced to 0 (in practice the game would parse spell commands about every 50ms).  Now most emu cores store the GCD server side, and retail does the same.  Some less well updated cores only apply a server-side validation to prevent the GCD going below 1s, which again means the end user can push the variable down to this value but not any lower.  I think Mangos-Zero has server side GCD tracking implemented, which means I don't see how GCD hacking would be possible."

It's a feature that could keep players interested in playing the game by switching classes, races, or even just professions if anyone cared about that."
wowservers,3b7azk,Struckd,3,Fri Jun 26 15:33:24 2015 UTC,Its also a feature for players who wish to join the server but not go thru the x1 leveling. So they buy a level 30-60 to help levitate some of the leveling...if they are lucky enough to see one pop up.  All in all account buying/trading happens on all private servers and retail servers. Kronos is just brave enough to acknowledge it and smart enough to use it to support the server.

Can you eliminate charecter trading at all? NO, it can't be controlled even with the most drastic measures. Simple ""supply and demand"" will always find a way to make it happen.

wowservers,3b8dha,forgers,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:10:32 2015 UTC,"The sticky at the top should help you narrow your search.  I will say the general rule of thumb is the later in the expansions you go, the less likely everything is working properly.  My understanding just from reading this sub is that Cata or later servers are generally not currently recommended if you want everything functioning and Blizzlike.  I would stick to WotLK if that is what you are thinking.  And remember it isn't retail.  Are you playing with friends?  If not, maybe scout a few servers out for yourself.  WoW inevitably turns into a large time investment (...just me..?) and private servers can each have their own eccentricities.  Finding a good match can be a matter of personal taste and can save yourself some long term stress or starting over again later. . .  Or just play on several servers!"
wowservers,3b8dha,Xossdk,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:36:53 2015 UTC,Thank you for the answer. I am planning on playing with friends. Im scouting on ahead just to figure out where exactly. I was looking at Warmane (Molten) and Dalaran. Maybe you have experiance with any of these yourself. Both of them seem to be functioning really well. So the biggest question would be the p2w factor. I wonder which one has less of it. Would you happen to know?

The server is about 2 months old, so its still fairly new and population continues to grow.  I find the community to be very friendly and I expect you'd be made to feel welcome.  It is a x1 server, and donations/vote points are only good for cosmetic items.

Nostalrius seems full/verging on overcrowded (more so than retail servers were), and from what I'm reading Kronos is better scripted at the higher level instances stage. It sounds like if people just gave Kronos a chance before blind picking Nostalrius (as everyone seems to do, myself included) then it would be the better choice. But that's just my opinion"

However, the population on Nostalrius is like 7-8x as high as Kronos at peak times so in terms of longevity I think nost is the better option.

Also excalibur gives you a free epic (s4, t6, doesnt matter but no weapon) when you hit 70 and that's a turn off for me. Excalibur has a better population but is laggy from time to time. Excalibur has been online for so long that you'll encounter ppls with full s4 /swp gear and they have high expectancy. asking to be za geared for kara is not out of the ordinary. In the same context feenix just released s4 and they will release swp in the future.

There is already other places for this - subreddits on private server X, ownedcore and 2-3 other sites. There isnt much threads per day but it still will be annoying to have 10 for account trading. There was a site for traiding molten accs only, 90% of all threads where scam and they banned a lot of ppl. A guy that has 20$ to spend on a private server acc can donate for instant level too."
wowservers,3b43d1,Nuber132,5,Fri Jun 26 05:49:55 2015 UTC,I'm for account trading here on this subreddit. I personally have a 47 Mage on Kronos but it's getting kinda boring so i'm thinking of trading with my account with someone on Nost or on Kronos but with a different class.  It's only a lvl 47 char but i had to put in over 120 hours because its vanilla. Of course i will not relevel vanilla all over again and casually put in 120+ hours just to get a char of about the same level. So account trading is perfect for such a matter. I see no reason to forbid it. It actually helps more the community than damage it
wowservers,3b43d1,Viiccee,3,Thu Jun 25 21:50:29 2015 UTC,"I am for account trading, people who account trade wouldn't otherwise level on a server, if someone wants to trade a dalaran account for a atlantiss account it is no loss for either server as neither of those people would have gone through x1 rate leveling again and they both would have gained active players instead of dormant accounts.

I Don't know what's going on with Kronos' pop, some say it's growing, some it's not, but I do know that people are leaving Nost because of all the problems the high pop brings. There's even a thread on Kronos forums about this, and constant complaints on Nost forums. Or if they're not leaving, then they've stopped playing there. Heck, I'm one of those people.   I always recommend to try them both. If you feel you want to play with billions of other people, go with Nost. If you want a bit more tighter community with less weaners and a better quality server overall (not just my opinion), go with Kronos.   One advice I'd give you is if you're worried about the future of the server and feel like Kronos will die in the near future, yet you hate being ganked every 5 minutes and fighting for quest mobs, I'd still go with Kronos. I'd much rather enjoy the game now than speculate whether you can enjoy it as much as you'd like, and the way you'd like, in 6 months."

wowservers,3b32by,Mephea,0,Thu Jun 25 17:47:24 2015 UTC,"What you're describing is more like the pvp on Kronos (although no vanilla pvp server exists where there's no high levels ganking lowbies).  Finding a person on Nost who has levelled through pvp zones EU times and says ""had a little bit of pvp"" is like finding a grain of salt (edit: salt, not sand lol) on a beach.

wowservers,3b32by,dungeonjay,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:03:37 2015 UTC,"You're right about the ganking, of course! What I meant is that on retail - even in STV or Tyr's Hand - you'd not have to constantly fight. You wouldn't be forced to be able to fight 30 seconds after resurrecting around your corpse. I played on the german Kel'Thuzad (pvp) server back then."
wowservers,3b32by,Pvt_8Ball,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:15:36 2015 UTC,Original Vanilla landscape(unless on a PVE realm) was constantly a battle in open world pvp and questing.  TBC didn't clear up world pvp mainly because Outland was an even smaller version of the continents of Azeroth.  It wasn't until Wrath and the landscape was so immense and varied that World pvp simmered down some.  That being said....Nost is a struggle to quest in the hot spots.  I have a mid-40s character and STV was not fun for me.  I should have just leveled in dungeons and steered clear of it.
wowservers,3b32by,Onarm,5,Thu Jun 25 22:32:01 2015 UTC,"Ok Roll backs are rare on both Kronos and Nos these days  Nos has alot of players, but it's too much IMO, gameplay is decent but the server is good up to about 5000 players then I/O lag gets past a certain point, they have recently improved the server lag and I guess it will get better in the future too, but never the less, the server lags with that many people, and don't confuse this with ping, ping is simply just one form of lag.  On the other hand there's Kronos, Kronos is no doubt better scripted and what not, I noticed the some of the path finding for mobs that follow a pre defined path on Nos is abit wierd (they sorta zig zag like they are on a grid), but it's fine on Kronos, Kronos is just lacking the numbers that's all.  If people just played on the better scripted server instead of going to the server that already has alot of players, Kronos would probably have more players than Nos.  Me personally, I'm kinda keeping my distance until things mature, both servers have problems in regards to population."

wowservers,3b32by,kemdog,4,Thu Jun 25 16:12:52 2015 UTC,"Realtalk? Being level 25 on Nos?  1K isn't a longterm server. Especially with Nos attracting everyone right now. While Kronus might be better scripted ( I see people on Reddit saying this, but so far Nos has been the best scripted server I've seen/is basically perfect, so I have no idea how Kronus could be better. ), Nos has the pop to last.  And that's kind of the issue. The problem with all these servers is they have a strong start of 1k-2kish, then eventually everyone remembers why they hate vanilla WoW and they go down to 500-1kish. And then with so few people online ( average vanilla server back before TBC held 2.5k people ), the smaller faction loses more and more people, leading to the larger faction losing more and more people, until it's basically a ghosttown.  Nos will lose people. It's inevitable. But it'll probably drop down at max to 2.5k, making it exactly like the old vanilla servers. And that means it's currently the best out of any WoW vanilla server around when it comes to potential longevity. Because when people on Kronos also start remembering why they don't like vanilla WoW, that'll hurt the server far more then it'll hurt Nos.  Outside of that, I've been playing now for 5 days and haven't seen a single rollback on Nos. While leveling 1-10 was difficult due to all the people, getting from 10-25 was just fine, with very few people stealing my kills. And people have become rather friendly and used to it by now, so what usually ends up happening is everyone groups up whenever you need a specific mob killed. This also means you always have people around to help with quests, so the more difficult vanilla quests can be grouped, leaving less time for pointless grinding.   If you want to play vanilla WoW right now, today. I'd say go Nos. It has the least chance of dying. If you don't mind waiting another few months to see how things shake out, then I'd say wait a few more months to see how things shake out. But I imagine all that's going to do is showcase Kronos with an even smaller pop, and leave Nos as the only server for you still, just with less people to level up with."

wowservers,3b1ptj,Nuber132,0,Thu Jun 25 07:48:25 2015 UTC,"The most played servers that I recommend and have seen recommended are as follows:  Vanilla - Nostalrius and Kronos (both 1x) TBC - Excalibur (2x, 4x for a few days a month) WOTLK - Dalaran (1x) Gamer-District (7x, 14x on weekends)  Cata expansion and beyond servers are all shit.  Pure unadulterated horse shit, anyone who says differently is a knob.  You're welcome, and my advice is try them all and pick the ones you like.  As far as wow circle and primal wow, I can't handle a server full of russians, so that rules that one out, and I haven't tried Primal, but I do not like progressive realms that go through expansions using a later build of the game, ie, 3.3.5 to do vanilla, and a year later it goes to TBC, and a year later it becomes WOTLK, reason being, they are not how they were in retail, at all.  It's just impossible.  And therefore they suck, according to me : )  Good day sir.  (dodgykebaab does youtube reviews BTW, and he is usually pretty accurate, although, he seems to love leveling way WAAAY too much, as someone who played the shit out of each expansion (minus Cata forward) I can tell you right now that I'd rather staple my dick to my neck and do sit-ups than level on a 1x server ever again, I've literally done every quest in this game multiple (by multiple I mean like 10x or more) on both sides and ya, 1x servers are not for me...)"

Dungeons are well scripted overall and mobs behave normally, but most ""speak to ......"" quests simply don't work. It's mostly a PvE server but there is some 2v2 arena players and there is Too Barad every few hours. Wintergrasp works too but there isn't anyone doing it. A big disadvantage are the often disconnects and server crashes though. Every instance is open but I think Icecrown has some issues."

It is commonly expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, as in 16:9. For an x:y aspect ratio, no matter how big or small the image is, if the width is divided into x units of equal length and the height is measured using this same length unit, the height will be measured to be y units.  In, for example, a group of images that all have an aspect ratio of 16:9, one image might be 16Â inches wide and 9Â inches high, another 16 centimeters wide and 9 centimeters high, and a third might be 8 yards wide and 4.5 yards high.

They have the WOTLK Talent trees but you are limited to level 60 and vanilla content for now. I just started there and I enjoy it so far but I think end game up until we are able to get level 80 will be unbalanced. Overall the community is pretty good and I haven't ran into many server issues.  If this is what you're looking for let me know and I can explain more."
wowservers,3b1ish,RockWork,3,Thu Jun 25 13:20:57 2015 UTC,"If you check through some previous posts your will see Primal Wow's name come up. Its a server that is starting from Vanilla and progressing through to Wotlk. If you are looking for something straight to 80 then it isn't for you, but the raiding scene has just started on this server and its high quality, albeit with a low pop. Also the wotlk talent trees are implemented and make specs like arms warrior more viable for vanilla raids which is a nice twist."
wowservers,3b1ish,iolheal,3,Thu Jun 25 06:03:12 2015 UTC,"second this, my whole guild (mostly) just moved over from emerald dream which is dead as balls. The wrath talents (while limited to 31 point cap talent from vanilla) are a lot better/more balanced especially for hybrids such as warriors, priests and druids for leveling, plus leveling items are not nearly so shitty. So far leveling to the 20s has been pleasant, fun, not too easy but not frustrating at the same time.   One thing I find interesting is that using the 3.3.5 client but limiting the game to vanilla content, is that no one has been there before- it's a familiar game, but there is no precedent, no cookie-cutter builds, and a lot better class balance, honestly, than the typical 1.12-based servers."

wowservers,3azbn9,coolfangs,2,Wed Jun 24 22:03:12 2015 UTC,You should state base for convenience (na or EU). The general census is: 1. Excalibur for tbc 2. Dalaran wow for wotlk (mileage may vary but since you are interested in progression it's your best bet). 3. Atlantiss for cata  I do know that Excalibur is way progressed so I don't know how easy it is to catch up. As far as atlantiss I have absolutely no idea. Dalaran has recently released ulduar but requires previous tier cleared to enter along with gear requirements.
wowservers,3azbn9,jimgdews,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:06:28 2015 UTC,"Hey. I'm looking for a NA server, or at least I'm on the east coast of Canada so whatever has a reasonable ping. Sounds like Excalibur isn't overly worth it and that it would be better to wait for Corecraft. Comes down to Dalaran WoW or Atlantiss I guess!  Do you know if there are guilds clearing the raids prior to Ulduar to help me gear up? Atlantiss is also very intriguing."
wowservers,3azbn9,dungeonjay,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:08:44 2015 UTC,"NA population actually is strong on Excalibur during that playtime.  The best populated TBC realm you will find in NA evenings.  Dalaran also has a high NA population.  Atlantiss, however, really doesn't but there is a couple NA guilds on there that you could hook up with.  Excalibur is fully progressed but because of the design of TBC in general you cannot skip to the nitty-gritty.  You have to do heroics, you have to raid Karazhan, etc....natural pecking order to things....mostly"
wowservers,3azbn9,jimgdews,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:40:29 2015 UTC,Well I currently play on primal wow since I don't have the time any more for raiding and wanted something relaxed that provided the old leveling experience. General NA players play alot less privates for some weird reason. You have to search YouTube reviews for both atlantiss and dalaran and also check this sub for further opinions. Both of them will do you just fine tbh. I personal detest the new azeroth after cata so much that it makes me almost puke. Talk note of the XP rates though because 1x may frustrate you somewhat if endgame is what your main interest is.

My suggestion for speed leveling is do both sides of beginning NR quests while que'n for dungeons.  (by the end they will be green quests and you will be speed clearing them) and then progress to Zul'Drak since you will be 74+ by this time and wrap up on Sholazar basin for speed leveling.  Total time depending on how you play should be about 2-3 hours a level.  If you use an inn for rested experience between game sessions it will speed this up for you.

I only have extremely limited experience with Dalaran WoW, but from what I saw it seems pretty good, although it is the first time ive played on a private server so i dont have much to compare it with. Last night whilst i was levelling to 10 there were about 856 people online on the horde side. This was around 8pm GMT, and the population started going down around 10 GMT.  Although from the little ive seen Dalaran does seem good, from the bit of reading I have done i'm led to believe that GD has a higher population at EU times. I'm not sure how true or not that is though.   Sorry I realise i've just written a big wall of text with nothing of much use in it. Either way, im looking for the same answer as you :)"
wowservers,3axkb8,Phawkesy,7,Wed Jun 24 12:00:56 2015 UTC,"I'll try to be unbiased...  Rates: GD is 1x-7x, Dalaran is 1x  Scripting: GD has a better overall scripting, Dalaran has better raid scripting (though I don't agree with this from the last time I played on Dalaran, but I keep hearing about it)  Population: GD peaks at 1500 at EU times, dies down at NA times. I'm not sure of Dalaran's population at EU times, but it's surely more active at NA times.  PvP: Both of them have Wintergrasp, though it's working better on GD, and GD overall has better working classes/more PvP activity. I don't recall if Dalaran Seewers is released on DalaranWoW, but it's released on GD as well. There's more world PvP on GD as well, at least in Tanaris/STV (which is awfully annoying if you're just trying to level). On Dalaran PvP is more of a side activity than anything anyone focus on. 3v3 never happens, 40 man BGs are rare (whenever they pop they usually end early due to insufficient people).  PvE Content released:  GD has everything released, every raid, every dungeon.  DalaranWoW is at 3.1 patch, with everything released up to Ulduar.  Custom stuff:  GD has 'popular place portals', transmogrification (opt in feature), arena spectator, instance resets for vote points (can't reset end game raids though), and a pay shop with end game gear  Dalaran-WoW has a progressive raiding system, where to enter the next tier you need to complete the previous one (i.e to enter Ulduar you need Naxx achievement). There are also gear restrictions in place. You can also pay for levels.  ""Community"": (hard to be unbiased here)  Stay out of /global on GD, it's a cesspool. There are nice guilds with nice people, and most chats are civil and even helpful... but not global chat.  From when last I played in DalaranWoW, it was low populated and people were very friendly. However, at least at the time, there was this feeling of fanaticism, if you talked about a bug you've crossed while you were playing you were told to 'shut up and keep playing, nobody cares, server is perfect'.  I hope this is helpful.. I've played both servers, and I currently play on GD"

I saw that earlier and wasn't sure.   Also, people say ICC isn't released yet, but their website and everything says they have the only working 100% ICC. Any clarification here?"
wowservers,3axkb8,dungeonjay,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:23:44 2015 UTC,Something like that man.  You have to finish Naxx 10/25 before doing Ulduar.  ICC isn't released.  It is a pretty nice system in design.  You should also have no problems finding a guild raiding on beginning tier content.
wowservers,3axkb8,mixd3,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:13:55 2015 UTC,"And raids are better scripted, yes.   Could you expand on this? Do you play on GD? What are the differences that make you say this?  Genuinely interested btw, might be that Dalaran improved since I last played"
wowservers,3axkb8,dungeonjay,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:52:07 2015 UTC,"Hey Mixd3.  I play on both a lot man.  Dalaran is great and they have made some improvements.  Raiding is good.  The population is building.  Even seeing pvp beginning to happen(not on Gamer-District level but it is happening).  They have fixed a ton of quests there but....I have quested extensively in Northrend on both and Gamer-District still has an edge in this department.  Although, if you haven't noticed...GD is losing population mainly because of that interface forum that people just don't understand.  I must tell five people a week on here how to log in to GD properly.  It is like the owner is his own worst enemy on population..."
wowservers,3axkb8,Altair1776,2,Wed Jun 24 15:42:53 2015 UTC,"Gamer District x7 is the most fun leveling I've ever had in WoW, retail or private server. The combination of great scripting and faster xp is the perfect combination for me. Others prefer the x1 experience of Dalaran.   I think that's the main question you need to ask: do you want x1 or x7 leveling? Both are good servers (I consider GD a great server)."
wowservers,3axkb8,Anesthesize,2,Wed Jun 24 15:16:31 2015 UTC,"Basically: pick GD if you want to clear everything fast and run ICC, Dalaran if you enjoy the feeling of progression and having a challenge even in lower raid tiers. GD also has a bigger pop for pvp but has donation gear."

wowservers,3awuag,Takeki,2,Wed Jun 24 03:43:00 2015 UTC,"The dungeons, the items, the bosses, the balancing, and the abilities of these classes."
wowservers,3awuag,SunRiseFromHell,3,Wed Jun 24 03:44:53 2015 UTC,"Ok, cool. Thanks for the questions.    Dungeons   Considering there's no client modding the dungeons generally take place inside other ones, but not without some kind of twist. There's a dungeon on Wartide called Thunderhorn March, which technically takes place in Razorfen Kraul, but because a large portion of Thousand Needles was instanced into that dungeon, I was able to put all of the mobs and bosses in what appears to be open world thousand needles. You and a party have to march through thousand needles and up the great lift, all the while fighting tauren soldiers. There are 9 very unique bosses along the way, and some cool events including one where a Night Elf summons an ancient to tank ~30 tauren mobs for the party. Quite a lot of fun. Another notable dungeon is the random roguelike one which takes place inside Scholomance. Every group that goes into this dungeon will have a completely different experience. Every pack of mobs is random down to their appearance, spells, size, health, tactics, and amount. In addition there are random crates all around that will drop random things including the gear tokens and vanity items. There are also 3 consistent bosses in Scholomance Halls that have fully scripted encounters that are the same each time. This dungeon is a lot of fun because you never know what you'll get, and it's a good challenge for a 3-person group. (some parts are solo-able for geared characters).     Items  There are heaps of Custom items, but the endgame gear is a scaled down version of raid tier 1 & 2. The legendaries and a host of other items are custom, though. I plan to add many custom endgame items in future patches, but I thought the vanilla sets were very fitting for he first tiers (when the server is released content patches will arrive as with retail).    Balancing  Balancing is a big challenge, and I'm going to need a lot of testers for it to become a reality. I'm open about the fact that the classes are not yet balanced.    Class Abilities   I could go on here forever, but I'll just give a few examples. Each class uses abilities that exist already in the game, but I've found a way to give them custom scripted effects. For example, the Void Knight can summon rifts that he can then teleport back to, which is not something that existed in the base game.  The classes are based on special resource systems for the most part. As an example, the primalist has a rage bar that caps at 250. When that cap is reached, the primalist will transform into a huge elemental for a short period, granting effects and a new appearance based on the player's spec. Another example being the Gladiator. The glad has a rage bar too, but his aim is to keep it balanced. If he keeps it balanced for a certain period of time, he will gain a short buff that causes attacks to ignore armour. If he hits 0 rage or reaches the cap, however, he will take 25% of his max health as damage and be stunned for 4sec.  The Rune Priest has a rune bar that caps at 10. His powerful spells require runes to cast. The rune priest can gain runes by smashing the rune crystals that periodically appear around them. The monk has energy and mana. His primary attack (Smash) has literally no cooldown or global cooldown, its only limitation being that it costs energy. This means the monk can save up energy to release a VERY fast string of punches. Smash also generates mana which can be used to fuel a stun attack. The Cleric has mana, and his basic spells consume it. When he reaches 0 mana he can use a powerful attack which will cause his mana to regenerate quickly, thus also disabling this powerful attack. The necromancer, beastmaster and primalist are all pet classes.   These are just very basic overviews of the classes, going into detail would take a very long time considering the complexity and sheer amount of them."

wowservers,3ay4vs,acuuuu,2,Wed Jun 24 13:04:53 2015 UTC,Okay.....barring the discussion on there the initial comment that pikunul said is pretty accurate.  Excalibur has a more dominated NA population as well so the population peaks higher longer.  Hellground is pretty populated but I think mainly with german?  There are a few english guilds there.  Feenix's archangel is extremely fast leveling and you will have more 70s on there give or take because of this.  Scripting is a toss-up.  I would have to say Excalibur is better.  Wow-Circle is mainly russian don't play on it and Last Wow is a core copy from 2007?  I've heard people say it is not that good...never played there don't know.  Vengeance Wow is pretty solid on scripting(low population) and may or may not have Karazhan(the first raid) released yet.  I know they were working on it and have it on their timetable.
wowservers,3ay4vs,dungeonjay,0,Wed Jun 24 15:50:43 2015 UTC,"I would only recommend either Feenix or Excalibur, unless you can speak/understand Russian, than WoW Circle may be your best option.  If you want a lively amount of players, it's either Feenix or Excalibur. I would suggest you taking a look at: https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/3a74u9/tbc_feenix_or_excalibur/  Or if you don't want to do so, short version: Excalibur for PvE focus, Feenix for a mix of both, as it has a little less population to support PvE, but has more PvP activity (you can tell by arena ladder)."
wowservers,3ay4vs,pikunul,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:36:30 2015 UTC,"Feenix is somewhat unstable, seems to have 4 or 5 crashes a day on most days (the server is back up within a few minutes at most however).  Just something to take into account."
wowservers,3ay4vs,Iwasapirateonce,-1,Wed Jun 24 13:49:05 2015 UTC,"I've been playing there recently and that's a straight up lie, unless you are talking about the past, which in that case, you'd be correct."
wowservers,3ay4vs,pikunul,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:52:41 2015 UTC,"Applies to a few months ago.  Also from a few streams I have watched recently, the server seems to have periods of high instability (this is possibly confined to certain periods of the day).  Perhaps refrain from the up-front accusations of deceit and lies?  It's such attitudes that damage the private server community as a whole add add the the general aura of hostility on this sub."
wowservers,3ay4vs,Iwasapirateonce,0,Wed Jun 24 13:57:43 2015 UTC,Could you name the streams and maybe some vod links to show the high instability?  I would heed your own advice and not spread lies if you aren't up-to-date with the server you're wanting to talk about.
wowservers,3ay4vs,pikunul,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:04:53 2015 UTC,"Sure, here is a link to Weedyxify's twitch vod page.  twitch vods  Again I will refute your last statement and reiterate my original point, my statements are based on experiences playing from several months ago but also from watching twitch streams over the past week/week and a half, where the server clearly goes down at several points.  While I no longer play on tbc servers or Feenix in general, the above gives me credence to make statements on the stability of Feenix during the times I discussed. You need to redefine your definition of spreading lies, although in addition I would add your general attitude could do with an overhaul."
wowservers,3ay4vs,Iwasapirateonce,0,Wed Jun 24 14:13:45 2015 UTC,"When you make a statement about something, you normally want to back it up with facts. You can't just go jump into a court case and say ""he is guilty because I said so!"", you need proof.  You still have yet to provide factual proof of recent high instability. I asked for some vod links that show me and the people who will read this the ""high instability"" that (supposedly) took place. What that implies is linking a specific vod along with the time and place of occurrence.  Weedy also plays on a multitude of TBC servers. Are you sure these 'crashes' that took place were on Feenix?  I also don't care if you like my attitude or not."
wowservers,3ay4vs,pikunul,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:42:30 2015 UTC,"Also Weedy does indeed play on multiple servers, but these particular incidences happened on Feenix.  The fact that you take the absence of itemised evidence from my original statement as justification for calling me a liar is just further reinforcement of your complete lack of rationale and perspective, and general toxicity.  Someone who had even a fragmented understanding of etiquette would have posted saying they disagree with what I posted and ask for evidence.  The fact that you just went straight in an accused me of being a liar/being out of date is just completely farcical, and quite frankly renders any future ramblings from you redundant as far as I am concerned.  Final tip, don't start mumbling about court cases, you clearly lack any understanding of how debating/refuting in the real world actually works.  I wonder if you outright call people you disagree with on the street liars?  I would like to see how that works out for you."

Also, I think it would be nice to eventually make special videos dedicated to each expansion. For example, if want x expansion (Vanilla, TBC, WotLK, Cata, MoP, etc.) what is your best options (or options if there is no clear winner the pros and cons of each option could be detailed). You could probably start with WotLk since it's the most popular private server expansion (or so it seems).  Anyway, thanks for your hard work and congratulations for joining this subreddit's moderation team."
wowservers,3axus5,dungeonjay,2,Thu Jun 25 17:45:43 2015 UTC,"Truewow doesn't have as much content released.   It is missing several key elements at the top end of the server.  It also is a slower leveling experience with x1 rates then GD's x7.  Either one you pick will be an enjoyable experience just keep in mind that they are two different types of Wrath servers and will offer something unique you can't get out of any other.  But my opinion(just my opinion) having quested extensively on both, I feel Gamer-District has the best scripting of any Wrath private server overall.  Meaning, a server may have be a little bit better in one area but fall below in several other spots....GD has a high mark across for everything(Raiding, Pvp, Questing, Working Mechanics, etc.)"
wowservers,3axus5,mixd3,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:34:14 2015 UTC,"Gamer-District is a lot better scripted. TrueWoW doesn't have a functional Ulduar/HoR/ToC, and a lot more class bugs if you compare both the bugtrackers."
wowservers,3axus5,mixd3,2,Wed Jun 24 12:13:14 2015 UTC,"One thing I hate about Gamer-District, but that has nothing to do with the quality of their server, is that their website is simply hideous. It just pushes you away from the server immediately."

wowservers,3axrn2,samw99,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:52:56 2015 UTC,I dont think any MoP server worth it right now. I tried freakz then warmane and after 10min i just deleted my game. Seems like there wont be a good one in next 1-2 years.
wowservers,3axrn2,dungeonjay,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:46:59 2015 UTC,I've had a look at MoP servers here. My impression is: while you can already have some fun on them mainly in PvP they are not very well scripted yet. Many dungeons are not even open on many servers.
wowservers,3axrn2,SunRiseFromHell,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:56:11 2015 UTC,"Warmane's MOP will have the best raids/dungeons and the pvp section is always popping.  They have one highly populated MoP server and I suggest playing on that.  Barring playing MoP now, Atlantiss will have a MoP realm released sometime in the next year or two that will definately be worth checking out.    Note  Warmane's MoP realm will have a crap ton of bugs all throughout but if we are just talking end game content since it is increased xp then they will have a lot of that available for you."

wowservers,3avvli,DwarfBody,2,Tue Jun 23 22:37:35 2015 UTC,It sounds like a neat concept! I think I'd give it a try but I think you'd have a lot of difficulty finding even 32 players that all want to start at the same time. You would probably need scheduled games once or twice a day to get a big enough population for each game
wowservers,3avvli,krugmik,2,Wed Jun 24 01:14:08 2015 UTC,"That'd be neat, I'd probably give it a whirl."
wowservers,3avvli,sloasdaylight,2,Wed Jun 24 02:08:49 2015 UTC,"That sounds pretty cool, I'd definitely give it a try."
wowservers,3avvli,Craptola,2,Wed Jun 24 02:15:42 2015 UTC,"Hey, cool idea. I was coding the same on 2.4.3 emulator and client, a bit more limited but here are some things that might inspire you.   I've used phase system to make the area ""instanceable"" (backported phasing system from WOTLK to TBC) Players can queue with a command or gossip npc, storing player object in a set. Sending SMSG_BATTLEFIELD_STATUS so they can check their queue status (edit the opcode so remove players from set when they use leave opcode etc.) Using SMSG_SUMMON_REQUEST to summon players to their starting location when the Hunger games pop up If they decline SMSG_SUMMON_REQUEST (CMSG_SUMMON_RESPONSE) then remove them from the game and send invite to next person in queue"
wowservers,3avvli,robinsch,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:23:43 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a cool way to do it. As of right now, I plan to handle most of the queue/join/setup with a custom out-of-client launcher - hopefully this ends up with the player not having to open the wow client until the game is very close to starting.  As I mentioned in another comment, I'm almost certain that I'm going to start up separate servers for each running game (And when a player logs in, only send the realm data for the server he signed up for, and only if the game hasn't already started). Theres obviously some overhead to doing this (Like would it be necessary to keep things like map data for each separate process, or would it be worth it to do the work to split this into its own separate process used by all running games on the machine?). As a bonus, this is also a good solution to any scaling issues, as I don't see any reasons why multiple running games couldn't run on separate machines.  Another benefit is that I dont have to do any summoning to a starting location, since I'll be creating entirely new characters each time a server starts up, I can simply create the character at their starting location (and keep them locked there until the game starts).  And maybe I'm missing something that I'm going to smash into later on, but it seems like I can save a fuck-ton of database transactions since I don't intend to store any character data, but simply recreate new characters at the start of every game.  It seems like you might know a thing or 2 about this stuff, so if any of this is making red flags pop up to you, I'd love to hear about it. Or just thoughts in general."
wowservers,3avvli,schaka,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:59:36 2015 UTC,"You'd have to do something about that character creation. People want their interface to be setup etc (including bars). So ""pre-created"" characters would then serve as a template. I think you are too limited with the way the wow client is constructed. There's no DotA esque interface where your mouse does all the work and you have 4 preset keybinds.   Robinsch is probably right in saying that client/server communication should for the most part happen directly ingame, so that the character you log in on becomes your ""interface"" to the actual game."
wowservers,3avvli,schaka,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:53:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah okay, thats a fair point. I guess the biggest issue is if players wants to use heavily modified interfaces. Actionbar hotkeys and layout could very easily be solved (since the server pretty much sends this data when the player logs in), but I'm not sure how that would work with custom action bar addons etc.  For interface setup, I'm almost certain that wow would automatically copy this across games since your character and server name would always be the same, although that might just be straight up wrong."
wowservers,3avvli,robinsch,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:21:09 2015 UTC,"As long as it stores data as is, there shouldn't be an issue. Meaning if you don't pre-set where hotkeys land on the bars.   There are 6 different bars in the default UI, all of which are being re-used by addons like Bongos and Bartender. I also know Bartender has extra bars (7-10) and you can set up custom bars, so I don't know about those tbh. I suppose they get stored in your WTF folder, so as long as account/server/character stay the same, nothing would change there either."
wowservers,3avvli,schaka,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:21:24 2015 UTC,"Starting up a new world for each ""battleground"" is not a good idea, you could basicly do the same result on one realm with 1/100 resource usage of your idea. Also I would give the player a normal character that they can talk with inbetween queues, you can have 2 character spell maps where you itr through on battleground join and leave and also restore action bars (just like dual spec system).  If you need any assiastance on server side code just msg, I've been deving for 6 years in emulation scene."
wowservers,3avvli,robinsch,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:47:54 2015 UTC,"You seem to have way more experience with this than me so maybe I'm missing something, but it seems like the majority of resource usage comes from loading LOS/Pathing data, as well as all of the world data. But since the play-area is fairly limited (Lets say an upper bound of like 8-10 zones), the amount of data needed to be kept in-memory is very low, and I'm fairly certain that this data isnt modified in any way, so I can imagine a few optimizations to be had there as well (Shared memory across all running servers maybe?)  The way I see it, the biggest benefits of keeping each game server seperate:   Since the server only lasts for something like an hour (or less), pretty much any long-term memory related problem becomes a non-issue as the entire process memory gets freed after use If a game server crashes, worst case scenario is that 1 game server is lost, but the rest keeps going   Does this sound completely wrong to you?"
wowservers,3avvli,gargoyle_boy,2,Wed Jun 24 21:03:12 2015 UTC,"When you say game server, do you mean the mangos game server instance in its current state or something you envision, similar to how Blizzard handles clustering.  Because, as a layman, I doubt you could optimize this I enough to rid yourself of all the overhead of running another full server instance."
wowservers,3avvli,schaka,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:35:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, by game server I mean separate mangos game server instances (although obviously reduced to the ""small"" amount of data needed).  I do kinda think its a bit too early to make any final server-architecture decisions like these, especially while working on gameplay related features (of which theres still plenty yet to be done). But its great to know that there's helpful people out there with good knowledge of the how the emulators work - I'm absolutely certain I'll run into problems at some point or another :)."
wowservers,3ax1oq,yzak,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:46:10 2015 UTC,All you have to do is get 200 ilvl in pretty much every slot from doing heroics and earning reputation and then run naxx/OS/EoE/VoA.
wowservers,3ax1oq,I_dump_dumplings,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:10:55 2015 UTC,"It depends on which server you're playing, but Gamer District has x7 rates and a command to reset heroics which makes the following strat more viable:   ilvl 264 neck, cloak, and ring purchased with honour. Non-arena-rating gear in general. You can easily farm 75k from a single WG session, with each ilvl 264 item costing ~50k.  ICC rep farms for an ilvl 277 ring. There should not be a gearscore requirement to join unless you're dealing with a 5th-rate raid leader/jerkwad.  Between the pvp and icc rings you should be set. However, if you have gold to sink, you can purchase an epic ring of the Kirin Tor for ~7k and pay for the successive upgrades in ilvl, to a maximum of 251. Highly contraindicated.  FOS/POS/HOR normal and heroic will give you the best possible 5man gear available; reward badges of triumph for each boss kill; and yield a chance to drop Battered Hilts (ilvl 251 quest weap). Elaborating on the first point, you'll get ilvl 219-232 instead of the max of 200 from conventional heroics.  Badger your guildies for craftable epics or make your own. It's considered polite to help farm the mats in the former case. Wintergrasp elementals are typically your best bet, especially when the area's controlled by your respective faction.  Save your badges of triumph for the ilvl 245 head and shoulder slot equips, or a trinket. All three will last you until ICC10/25. :) Do VOA10/25 whenever you get the chance! The gs requirements are pretty lax since they're easy raids to begin with."

wowservers,3ax1oq,coolfangs,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:28:44 2015 UTC,Pretty much grind RDF for badge gear till your geared enough for Naxx/OS/EoE. (you said heroism points so I assume you're playing on Dalaran).
wowservers,3ax1oq,dungeonjay,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:14:04 2015 UTC,"yes. but with these points, the gear I buy seems very subpar"
wowservers,3ax1oq,coolfangs,2,Wed Jun 24 09:27:22 2015 UTC,Thats because it is the stepping stone gear between heroic dungeons and doing like Naxx.  You are farming the lowest tier vendor.  Which is fine because of the progression on Dalaran and how you go about gearing up.  You will also want to make sure and grab the right faction tabards as you heroic grind to get certain lvl80 pieces from them as well as inscriptions for head/shoulders.

If you're choosing between DalaranWoW and Gamer District the populations are fairly equal (1.5k peaks if others were telling the truth about the former), however there're a few custom scripts which make GD more rewarding. i.e. heroic instance resets, icc resets purchased with voting points, a portal to population/questing hubs, RaF for x14 rates, etc.   IGN is Lucern.

wowservers,3athrg,huskymuffintop,7,Tue Jun 30 06:49:04 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad you said all of this. Unfortunately this community seems very bitter and hateful, all I tried is to point to the good sides of the servers I play on and I got downvoted, insulted and laughed at. And the people that shared my opinion got called the same. Nowhere did I in my original post where I simply recommended a server, insult or shame anyone.   The subreddit should have a rule where non-constructive criticism (server x is shit) should be forbidden because it doesn't contribute to the discussion, it simply makes it worse or at least the mods should control the flow of discussion by making everyone's voices heard and equally respected."

wowservers,3athrg,AspiringgMage,-1,Tue Jun 23 12:21:05 2015 UTC,"When you ask the masses what server is the best do you think they will all agree upon this?    You have to look beyond the message and see the trend.    Are more than one person saying this about so and so server?  Are more than one person telling you the advantages to playing on this server?  Why are they telling me this is a good server and that is a bad?  Some of the people around here that make suggestions have been playing on private wow servers for years and may even know some of the backdrop and history to how the GMs treat players or how the Devs develop.  Is it a catch and grab server?  I stand by this as truth to the testimony.....new servers(especially with cash shop incentives) hold little interest to me initially and should be wary of and definately not invest money or time into unless they can show they are a foundation and not a server that will bail in one or two months.    So, the suggestions go around with the servers we know aren't leaving us and then it comes down to what those servers offer and the variety of gameplays held within.  That should be up to the player to decide beyond statistically information of how many people play and what features does it have."
wowservers,3attvq,ShaankZ,4,Tue Jun 23 13:34:28 2015 UTC,"To answer your questions:   They are WotLK based, especially for paladins that's much less painful than in vanilla. Like most mechanics, Spell power also works like in WotLK. I would say class viability is a mix between vanilla and WotLK. Due to the WotLK mechanics, classes should be better balanced. But especially ret paladins will miss abilities due to TBC/WotLK talents not available. It will still be viable enough to join dungeons/raids if you don't care too much about topping the dps meters. Due to the demand for this, primal will be working to scale them back so they can also be played during the vanilla phase. Yes, even though it's 1x rates. They are based on 3.3.5 so it will be much faster than the Vanilla grind.   Generally this server will play the Vanilla content with the enhanced mechanics and UI from WotLK, while still keeping the raids challenging. Don't forget that it will move to TBC content when we're done with vanilla!"

However they're not doing it via website counters, they do it via simulated bots which replicate players, it can even be modified to an extent so they move and write things but they're not real players.  This is usually used as a form of a stresstest for private servers but Nostalrius uses it to fake population.   Here's an example: https://github.com/jackpoz/BotFarm Botfarms like these can be found and made easily. That's why they censor everything, this phase is critical for them because they need to fool the users. This is why you see their forums' active users are very small numbers.  Their actual population is around 1500-2000 players which isn't bad but certainly not 8k-9k like they advertise, their core and server can't even handle that many players."

Without cluster load balancing private servers can't pull off big numbers and even with it they can't get more than 5k-6k, they certainly cannot get those numbers. Even retail servers start to have issues when they go past 10k players.  A guy asked for explanation so I just did it, there's no need to be rude."

wowservers,3auva2,Ambassador_Buta,4,Tue Jun 23 20:37:12 2015 UTC,He just said it was manipulated with bots.
wowservers,3auva2,mind_puttee,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:39:18 2015 UTC,"So when I get ganked (every 3 minutes each by different players), it was a bot? When it takes me 5 seconds to find a group for a dungeon (Every time), are all 4 of those people in my party bots? When I play battlegrounds (queue times nonexistent for 10-29 and 20-29 btw), they're all bots? My guild is full of bots?  So far, 34 levels in, I haven't suspected a single player I've met so far a bot. Every zone is simply crawling with activity. Every quest is a PvP battle. Like I've said, 1500-2500 real player estimate sounds like a jealous Kronos fanboy.   I just really have to ask. If Kronos is such a glorious server, why do these kids feel like they need to whine about the prosperity of other servers? Heck, they even say that 1500-2000 players filled up a vanilla retail server back in the day. Why bother trying to attract more players?"
wowservers,3auva2,Ambassador_Buta,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:48:30 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't know, I also haven't said that the bots are acting as players, I've said that they could make that happen if they wanted to. Possibilities are endless, if you want to, you can look at the code a bit of what I linked as well.   But those numbers are simply not possible, there's a reason why big servers make multiple realms instead of having one big realm. (in case you don't get it, no matter how many optimizations you make the framework simply can't maintain and handle that many players)  Again, no disrespect, just pointing out the truth and answering the OP's question. I don't play vanilla servers and I'm not biased in any form, I just happen to know a bit about how this is done."
wowservers,3auva2,mind_puttee,0,Tue Jun 23 20:53:59 2015 UTC,"Ah, so it's super bots then.   But those numbers are simply not possible, there's a reason why big servers make multiple realms instead of having one big realm. (in case you don't get it, no matter how many optimizations you make the framework simply can't maintain and handle that many players)   The server lags when the population gets over 6k. And when it got up to 9k not too long ago it was admittedly unplayable for me. Are you trying to tell me the devs are just shitting bots all over the realm so players can enjoy visceral 5 second cast delays? There is a reason why a bunch of people on the forums ask for a second server (Even though they're not getting one)  The actual reason multiple realms exist is for shit like 14x rates on one, 1x rates on the other, instant max level on the last. It was the case with Molten, Feenix, and pretty much every other popular server."
wowservers,3auva2,Ambassador_Buta,3,Tue Jun 23 21:01:14 2015 UTC,"No, existence of realms has nothing to do with the rates. There first has to be a population demand and then you make new servers, only then you can think of the rates and similar things.  I'm again not trying to be disrespectful or insult you in any way and there's no need to be offensive about the subject alone. What they're claiming is just impossible, it simply is not financially and hardware-related feasible but it's okay if you want to believe them, you can do that.   I personally don't think faking population is a bad thing. Some servers use it as a way to drive players to the proper realm. (example of let's say 2 exactly same realms, and you add 10% of population so people go to that realm and like that you can control population e.g wow circle)."
wowservers,3auva2,mind_puttee,-2,Tue Jun 23 21:10:48 2015 UTC,"What they're claiming is just impossible, it simply is not financially and hardware-related feasible but it's okay if you want to believe them, you can do that.   Blizzard maintains hundreds of realms, all of them with the ability to handle more/equal players with 0 lag, although they're a multi billion dollar company. Why can't 16 developers in France find the money to maintain one? One or more of them can't possibly be rich? Nostalrius doesn't accept donations, so that's a very real possibility.  And then what would happen to the server if 9 thousand unique players did connect? Would it just be laggy to shit? Unplayable delays? Constant disconnects and crashes? All three of those happened to me when the /who said that 9,000+ people were playing. What didn't happen, however, was a black hole forming and destroying the world as you seem to be implying."
wowservers,3auva2,Mephea,4,Tue Jun 23 21:17:13 2015 UTC,"Blizzard made this game, 16 developers in France did not even make the framework they're working on. Credit to those magnificent people who made MaNGOS from which everything is based on, is never given. The lag and delays that you felt were probably around 4k-5k players (theoretically calculated, probably even lower), on 9k way more serious issues such as restart loops, big downtime would happen. It would be exactly like a DDOS attack which would bring the realm down in a matter of moments.   I'm not a Kronos fan as others implied in this thread, I just happen not to be one of the sheep this whole industry is trying to fool with numbers. Numbers are not important (you won't interact with 1% of the entire playerbase), play the game and have fun."

wowservers,3auva2,Ambassador_Buta,2,Tue Jun 23 21:55:31 2015 UTC,"Have to say that even though it's obvious that Nost is absolutely full of players, I've never believed the numbers there were accurate.  I started there on the second day it was open, and I'm pretty sure /who already said there were way over 4000 people online. So...day 2, most people still in the 6 starting areas of which 2 are shared between 2 races, so that's, what, 1.5k undeads and humans? Sure."
wowservers,3auva2,mind_puttee,-3,Tue Jun 23 22:22:26 2015 UTC,"Oh, please don't get me wrong. I did say that the population is rather large but it's not the entire number. Their population is around 2k and it's quite enough to have a well played server but the numbers which they're showcasing is simply impossible for any private server without extensive and extreme cluster load balancing which they don't have. (only retail has this, this is very expensive btw)  I don't mean this as disrespect towards anyone, I just happen to know a bit about the subject."
wowservers,3auva2,Ambassador_Buta,3,Tue Jun 23 20:45:31 2015 UTC,"I just happen to know a bit about the subject.   You must be very experienced in overpopulated private servers. There simply was no other server in the past that ever surpassed 2,000 real players.  Anyway, with my knowledge of actually fucking playing on the server I can assure you that every zone is simply bustling with activity. 2,000 players is such a low ball shot when low level battlegrounds exist.  Unless Nostalrius uses super bots!!!!!!!!!! that can run dungeons (matter of seconds to find a group for anything) with actual people, hold conversations, and offer a good challenge in PvP (ganks everywhere). And spam chuck norris jokes in Barrens chat."
wowservers,3auva2,mind_puttee,-5,Tue Jun 23 20:57:13 2015 UTC,"I think you're a bit angry, for reasons that I don't know. You should not be angry, this is common practice in this 'industry'. I've said it in this thread that it is not possible for any private server to have more than 5k-6k, not 2k and I've listed the reasons why. If you want to get more intricate in the subject, read up about MaNGOS from which everything derived.   Cheers!"
wowservers,3auva2,schaka,3,Tue Jun 23 21:02:42 2015 UTC,"5-6k does indeed sound like a reasonable estimate of Nost's population. And in fact the population hovers around that number for most of the day. However, when it surges up to 9k (rare) it does become unplayable. How it would become simply 'impossible' does not compute."
wowservers,3auva2,material_methods,-4,Tue Jun 23 21:06:57 2015 UTC,"I really do wish you were telling the truth but knowing how things work, it simply isn't feasible.

wowservers,3auva2,Struckd,2,Tue Jun 23 21:18:09 2015 UTC,"Aw man, you are actually so pathetic. You have no fucking clue what you're talking about. Nostalrius does not fake their nubmers. If they do, then ONLY the total number in /who is faked and nobody has been able to tell.   I have enough understanding of how bots work (having written them myself) and a decent-enough understanding of mangos core structure to tell you, there are no bots. Actually play on the server and experience it for yourself, or just crawl back into whatever hole you came out of.  Everyone who has played there will tell you, every player interaction they have had was real. Because that's what happens.   Having played servers who legitimately had 2000-3000 people online at the same time, I can tell you, Nostalrius at a regular peak time (6-7k in /who) looks much different than that. It is vastly more populated.   If you don't think a team of 16 developers could, over the course of a couple years (which is how long Nostalrius has been out, as it was a French server before) do some major refactoring to Mangos, you're even more of an idiot than you pretend not to be. Just look at the work breadandbutter and shiro have done on Corecraft. From network refactoring to rewriting pathing and so much more than that. These are POSSIBILITIES that Nostalrius HAS. I'm not saying they have necessarily done that.  But from actually playing on the server I can tell you: View distance is small as fuck, sometimes you will not even see mobs seconds after they started attacking you. Pathing is clunky and player/mob positions are updated with huge delay. Grids are, as far as I can tell, very small and nowhere near the size Blizzard used on their official realms. Spells will sometimes take 2-3 seconds before being casted because the current batch of player actions isn't being executed quickly enough (hardware too weak for that many players). There are no checks in place as to whether a player is currently incapacitated when he starts a cast, only when the client sends the action to the server, not when the server actually executes it - because that would require more procressing power etcetc.  All of these things contribute to how many players they can hold (or can't, because it gets laggy and unplayable around 6k).   tl;dr if they are faking population, it's only the total number as I can say with certainty there are no generated bots PS you can shove your false sense of calmness and superiority up your ass :)"

wowservers,3au97k,pikunul,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:14:34 2015 UTC,"There is no ""nostalrius equivalent"" of ANYTHING. I'm also just going to copy/paste my point of view of the two most popular TBC servers as I can't be bothered rewriting it again and again  Archangel (Feenix): MH/BT Top-End raids right now, along with ZA just recently released. Peak of ~1.5-2k (hard to say since no counter). x14 rates. End-Game is fairly well scripted, such as dungeons/raids, but the leveling experience is fairly slacking but I suppose that's what the high rates are for. Can donate for any and all gear, but t6+ gear is $200 per piece so very very expensive (glaives are 700 for 1).  Excalibur: All TBC content released including SWP. Peak population of 2k. x2 rates with x4 monthly vote events. End-Game is well scripted, along with most of the leveling quests/dungeons, etc. Few custom things such as cross faction raiding, world chat, etc. Can donate for gear, just not SWP items, and for fairly cheap prices. A big downside to this is you could once donate for glaives, so there are a lot of rogues running around with them when you clearly see they should not have them.  If you wan't more information regarding the two, you can read over a few days old topic here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/3a74u9/tbc_feenix_or_excalibur/"

I've started messing with a custom class here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkLe-tYcUz0  Although I am basing some spells off existing spells, I am using custom spell visuals as well which I believe I am probably the first (?) to do.

wowservers,3arb42,only777,11,Mon Jun 22 21:44:33 2015 UTC,"Because the post accuses me of deleting other threads I feel obligated to take a stand on the problem.  That's right. I am moderator of /r/atlantisswow. What is more, I play on Atlantiss! As a matter of fact I have also account on Warmane, Monster WoW, WoW Circle, Wow Reach (before it was closed). I like Cataclysm and I check every cata server. I have made a 'wow' CSS style for reddit and applied it for /r/hellscreamwow and /r/atlantisswow. Atlantiss stuff later asked to get mods there, but they didn't deleted me as a mod.   I like Atlantiss and recommend the server, that's the fact, but I have never used my super-mod-power to delete/promote any post regarding any server. In fact I was much less active mod than /u/sudin and thanks to him this reddit is clean. And so did /u/sudin removed the post. Probably because it turned out into flame war, but that's only what I suppose, I think he should take a stand as well.  Reddit keeps moderation log for ever from last 2 months* and everyone can check what I do here. Well, everyone who has mod of course. Here are screenshots from last month:  1 2 3  I know screenshots can be easily faked, but so can confirm other mods and so could confirm any other person who become a mod.   my bad, I though it keeps whole log   Tl;dr, That's right, I play on Atlantiss, but I have never used my powers to promote/defame any server."
wowservers,3arb42,Hyptu,7,Mon Jun 22 22:48:40 2015 UTC,"Uh, the reason the thread got deleted has nothing to do with you mate, that OP account was created that day. As per the loooong standing rule of no posting by flash made accounts, it was I who removed it."
wowservers,3arb42,sudin,-5,Tue Jun 23 05:54:13 2015 UTC,"So it was a removed by a moderator and I get downvoted for saying that?  it's only natural to think that you're doing something and i'm surprised the members of this place haven't actually said anything before, if you were a subreddit mod on warmane's/monsterwow's/wowfreakz' subreddit everyone's story would be different and everyone would be yelling at you. You shouldn't be moderating a neutral community with being so deeply affiliated with any staff of any server, especially because you posted and linked promotions of that server, it's not right and should be frowned upon, i can't believe that others can support this"
wowservers,3arb42,huskymuffintop,3,Mon Jun 22 23:09:39 2015 UTC,I don't know why the thread got removed either but you have to realize we aren't on Warmane forums here.  This is about private servers and not everyone is going to think Warmane is the top private server in their eyes.  You may have strong feelings about that community just as I have strong feelings about the way they have their system setup.  People may not like the cash shop or the increased xp.  They are working on a non-cash shop x1 wrath server.  That is the most interesting thing I've heard about Molten(Warmane) from them since the Moltdown and AT merging.  But you have to keep in mind....not all of us like Warmane and if you post on here expect a lot of the community here to tell you exactly why they don't like it.
wowservers,3arb42,dungeonjay,-2,Mon Jun 22 23:45:26 2015 UTC,"i've said it once and i'll say it again, this is not about warmane, it's about having different opinions, i've expressed mine in a polite, correct way and i got insulted and then when others chimed in the thread got removed, that's not the proper way of doing it. you said it yourself ""this is about private servers"" it shouldn't be all about atlantiss then and it sure as hell shouldn't have an atlantiss guy as a mod, it's just wrong, even this dodgykebaab thread got removed for some time and it was put back, sheesh"
wowservers,3arb42,huskymuffintop,4,Mon Jun 22 23:58:24 2015 UTC,"I can't see why it matters if he moderates a neutral community even if he plays on a specific server. It hasn't been proven he is some corrupt, almighty power-tripping moderator who uses his powers to shame competition (Warmane).  Just because a majority of the community feels one server is better than the other, doesn't mean you people should start ridiculous accusations."
wowservers,3arb42,pikunul,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:22:14 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter if he plays on the server, it matters when he is given the tools to do so with deep affiliation with staff of some server, this place was already used for promotion of their programming school and a few other things, that shouldn't be the case   if you don't trust me, go ask developer communities and trinity/mangos devs that made all of this possible, they'll tell you that every single private server is GREEDY, not one is exception, they all use free software with their additions for the single purpose of making money and anyone that believes otherwise is fooling themselves, putting a staff member or someone affiliated to control a neutral community will never end well  and no exceptions should be made also your accusations are shameful, putting warmane in that context, why? i dont know a single server, including warmane, that went somewhere else and shamed someone else or attacked anyone, as matter of fact i dont see any server doing anything to anyone else.   fyi i play monsterwow and warmane, monster on cata and blackrock on warmane, if people on there knew what you write here they wouldn't agree either, typical circlejerk"
wowservers,3arb42,huskymuffintop,7,Mon Jun 22 23:36:55 2015 UTC,"Monster-wow also falsifies population like Warmane.  Dishonesty doesn't stretch far for many.  I try my best to give an unbias answer to the OP of the thread.  I have defended Warmane in the past as well.  If the OP is seeking a profile that matches Warmane I will direct them to it immediately because I believe in the growth of private servers no matter which server it is.  Warmane does have a quality about it; Raiding and pvp.  Beyond that it doesn't exist.  So for ""overall quality"" I don't recommend that.  For raiding, I prefer Dalaran.  Why?  It is true progression.  Warmane lays all the cookies out from the jar.  Some people don't want that.  Everyone will have a different opinion.  Some people like to level, some like to do random dungeon finder as they level....hell some people like to fish and that matters to them(I'm looking at you dodgy on this one).....  What you have is opinions and maybe it is the first time you have seen outside the forum threads on Warmane about private servers since that forum is heavily moderated as well.  It is the simple truth of the matter.  I, also, am upset the thread was deleted since it was the first major discussion I have been involved in about Warmane in awhile."
wowservers,3arb42,dungeonjay,0,Mon Jun 22 23:55:20 2015 UTC,"I don't see anything wrong with this reply, you expressed your opinion. You should not be downvoted to hell and insulted and then after that your answers disappear like they never existed. That's just disrespect and it's plain wrong. I've already responded to only777 who wrote a similar post, it's fine if people don't like the way warmane does things (their new x1 realm should probably change that too) but it's not fine when they downright insult the people that like it that way and especially it's not right when that thread gets deleted after.  Threads like that should be moderated in a way (contest mode maybe?) that everyone gets to express their opinion without feeling threatened and that's the way it should be, not tucked underneath the carpet because that makes you look worse than the supposedly horrible forum moderators on warmane (i wouldnt know tbh, i came there from AT and i'm loving it so far, more people and good pvp)  i don't think i will discuss this further, i've made my points and the moderation log shows that I was right, censorship shouldn't be a thing anywhere and certainly not on neutral ground, i'll express my concerns to the moderators of this subreddit and show them how they can improve (if they care enough to listen), that's all"

wowservers,3arb42,Hyptu,-3,Mon Jun 22 23:42:39 2015 UTC,"It seems you are not reading what I wrote either, you should not be in the place of power, despite your intentions and your moderation log goes only to some extent. We all play private servers but we all should also know what they are, they're all people that use free software and other people's years of hard work that is a copy of other people's decades of work all for the purpose of cash, money, bling.   Atlantiss is not an exception, nor is Warmane, not a single private server is an exception to this. i know what you're thinking already, education purposes? Don't make me laugh, it's evident that you can contribute to these projects without making any dough. im not trolling, im simply pointing out facts and even this subreddit had more people from other servers they would be thinking the same thing. you shouldn't be a mod here, it's that simple"
wowservers,3arb42,huskymuffintop,6,Mon Jun 22 23:48:00 2015 UTC,The only thing I have ever seen Hyptu comment on Warmane consistently when asked about it is that the scripting for quests is not up to par.  That is not a lie.  That is the truth.  He tries his best to put all the information out on the table.  He is also the one that created the header that lists Warmane and their rates.  If he was so hell bent on anti-Warmane issues I'm sure they would not be listed on that header.

wowservers,3arb42,jmanofcoop,5,Tue Jun 23 00:20:04 2015 UTC,"That is the power of reddit.  To upvote or downvote.  We are surrounded by our peers.  This same thread could be discussed about other servers on here like mentioned when dealing with Nost vs Kronos or Vengeance-wow vs Excalibur.    Private servers are not charity events aside for the rare handful.  It doesn't take rocket science to figure this out but what does matter is how they are donated to.  A lot of people do not like cash shop for gear.  And when I say a lot, I mean a lot.  Nost 9k population should speak volumes about it.  Why?  Because 90% of the Nost vs. Kronos on here always comes down to Nost doesn't have a cash shop but Kronos has a character auction therefore it is P2W.  Excalibur versus Vengeance goes around and around with the P2W aspects.  Believe me when it comes to Warmane and this discussion 90% of the time cash-shop is thrown around.  Atlantiss has freakin vanity stuff for sell.....vanity?  Yes, the more people that play on it the higher percentage(what 1-5% of the population might donate to the vanity shop).  If you ask me, that sounds a lot like someone just barely being able to keep the server costs going and maybe a little pocket change in the process.  Warmane offers the full monty....top to bottom.  What do you think that is about?  Sounds a lot more than just paying server costs and a little reimbursement   Gamer-District does the same.  It is definately a P2W server and that gets discussed a lot and I recommend GD a lot.  You are just in a sub-reddit with a community that doesn't think P2W is all that great.    I get downvoted a ton for mentioning Warmane for pvp or Excalibur but it doesn't stop me because I'm going to suggest what is best for the OP thread and not lie about it or try to please everyone around me.  This subreddit isn't corrupt it just is largely a community that doesn't believe in P2W shops and most like a pure leveling experience.  We have a few regular trolls but then what forum board doesn't?  We also have very opinionated members.  But most of us agree and you can call it a circlejerk or whatever man but don't come into a group of friends and start calling us out for corrupt.  Slinging mud doesn't sit well with someone you just met and especially if that someone is more than one person.  That is life."

wowservers,3arb42,pikunul,4,Tue Jun 23 01:58:14 2015 UTC,"I feel the moderation of this subreddit is fine and don't think there is corruption going on.  However, even if I play on Atlantiss myself (I was disappointed with WoD and tried Atl after Dodgy's video. I tried all popular MoP servers as well for example, but their scripting is still pretty bad compared to Atl in my opinion.) the echo chamber effect in this subreddit makes me a bit uncomfortable at times: About every 3rd post recommends Atlantiss and Dalaran.  I guess that is somewhat to be expected in a subreddit with a rather small population with strong opinions where literally everybody has an interest in seeing his favourite server growing.  I do believe that the recommendations are justified because the servers are good, but I wish the topics were a bit more varied than ""hay guyse! Which server is gud? Pls halp!"" - ""Atlantiss!"" ""Dalaran!"""
wowservers,3arb42,samw99,-5,Tue Jun 23 10:03:01 2015 UTC,"Why do you lie? As a matter of fact Atlantis is one of worst Cata servers right now with bugged class spells and no endgame.

I've seen the rule but I'm wondering why it was  it enforced in the past. The moderation log is there and you can find countless threads made by new accounts that remained + you have the ability to disapprove a post before it gets public so I wonder why this one exactly?    I see that people are passionate about their servers and that is fine, I've said it before and I'll say it again, everyone has their cup of tea and there is no need to call anyone liars or insult people just because it doesn't go along with general opinion.

I say this, don't let the gear shops intimidate you.  Most people don't have the cash lying around to blow on items in these stores and only a very small percentage of the population donates on these servers."

wowservers,3asmae,dungeonjay,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:17:18 2015 UTC,"I don't see Character auctions as P2W but others might.  I think it is a migrating of control that is assumed of a character that still has functionally acquired gear, gold, etc.  It is an interesting situation, however, as you will not know if someone you used to hang out with sold their character and then you start talking with them which could put you in a compromised position if they are dishonest(ie...saying they need gold, etc.) since you would be willing to help an old friend but a total stranger you wouldn't.    Edit for clarity  Kronos has character auctions on their website if you didn't know."
wowservers,3asmae,BrandonDekelver,2,Tue Jun 23 17:26:51 2015 UTC,I would either go cataclysm (atlantiss x1 but x3 with raf) or wotlk (Dalaran or gamer district)
wowservers,3asmae,alibaba4715,2,Tue Jun 23 04:37:50 2015 UTC,I would like to say if you're interested in trying vanilla then there's no harm in giving Kronos a go. There's none of the early level ballache fighting for mobs with loadsssss of people and there's a good amount of dungeon groups and WSG going at lower level. I'm 26 now and have found people for all group quests and dungeons as well as had no problem with queuing for PvP either. Was about 1k people on last night when I checked. Give it a go and see what you think maybe.

wowservers,3apvwc,Corix,3,Mon Jun 22 22:45:47 2015 UTC,"Leveling feels more like 3.3 at least up to 40, you will miss your 20 level mount though alot. After 40 I cannot know since you are talent limited. It feels refreshing trying to come up with a build for 60 though. The endgame content is going to be tweaked to accommodate the class fixes and balances. I really hope they pull it off tbh. We shall see..."
wowservers,3apvwc,jimgdews,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:48:04 2015 UTC,"Oh, so its 3.3 talent trees? Thats kinda disappointing, but not unexpected."
wowservers,3apvwc,Freqd-with-a-silentQ,2,Mon Jun 22 23:50:41 2015 UTC,The talent trees are limited and you cannot put points in any talent beyond the 31pt one that the specc had in vanilla. So shamans can't dual wield for example. They can stormstrike though and put 4 totems down at once. Trying to come up with a spec is extremely entertaining.
wowservers,3apvwc,jimgdews,2,Tue Jun 23 12:47:24 2015 UTC,"You dont have feral druids with mangle or paladins with crusader strike in vanilla. You can only get the 31 pointer talent, so it's not that far away from vanilla actually.  Of cause there are some issues, since specs were balanced around lvl 80 and 41/51 pointers. I am looking forward to see how it will work out."
wowservers,3apvwc,trmpah,2,Tue Jun 23 12:55:11 2015 UTC,"Except for the bast changes they'd made to lower talents throughout Vanilla, Bc and LK. Just one big example would be Blood and Thunder, a low level talent for warriors that very much changes the gameplay. It might be interesting, might be worth playing, but it is not Vanilla."
wowservers,3apvwc,Freqd-with-a-silentQ,2,Tue Jun 23 20:29:56 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty cool thing about this server, you don't automatically know which talents or specs are the best choice.

wowservers,3apvwc,vitsippa,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:09:19 2015 UTC,The talents that were added in TBC and WotLK are not available so the tree is quite similar to Vanilla.
wowservers,3apvwc,Roelv1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:20:20 2015 UTC,I just started on the server and the end game fixes/balances are the one thing I worry about. If it's too easy it will be just like current retail but with twinks and thats what it seems like right now. I think they need to tweek the XP requirements up a little to slow down leveling and really focus on tweaking bosses.
wowservers,3apvwc,RockWork,2,Tue Jun 23 11:27:35 2015 UTC,"Talent trees are limited up to the 31pt taken that respectively was in vanilla, i.e. leader of the pack for feral druid while improved or the rest on that tier is disabled. Shaman can't dual wield for example. Some classes though have very good talents early on in the trees so they have some advantage but its not exactly complete. All specs lack crucial talents atm so the whole package is very interesting."
wowservers,3apvwc,jimgdews,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:44:47 2015 UTC,"the quality-of-life improvements of wrath with only vanilla content has been extremely fun so far.   no JC or scribing, no blood elves or draenai or DKs (thank god), the only thing that's really missing is 40-man onyxia and Naxx which unfortunately might not be possible to implement; overall I think it's a great idea and I'm having a blast playing there so far."

Yet they don't speak of anything related to the vanilla content, where's the information about the state of content, PvE, Class fixes? Simply being a 3.3.5 client with a light/soft taste of vanilla isn't good enough. Back during TBC, 80% of vanilla servers ran with the TBC client and core, because it was more developed than Mangos Platinum, and the same with WoTLK core when it was more developed. This isn't a new concept, but a very old one. And won't get anywhere, even the lack of marketing shows how incompetent the project's team is. Where's the showcase videos? Show us how classes or working, show us the state of the PvE content, the quality of your scripts. This is lackluster more than anything, and won't get anywhere, even with Dodgykebaab's help.

wowservers,3apzh0,ko11enberg,6,Mon Jun 22 15:49:08 2015 UTC,"Just browse through http://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/37b5ir/wow_private_servers_list/  And never ever try MoP and WoD. As example for why not: there are only 3 good Cataclysm realms and only 1 of them is marketed towards EN community (much smaller pop than those 2 non-EN). Anything above Cata on private scene is shit.  And a second important rule that mostly works (at least for TBC/Wotlk/Cata) is: try servers with 1x rates first. Yes they take longer, but they SHOULD have more polished experience with instances/quests and even in the endgame content."
wowservers,3apzh0,Suntys,5,Mon Jun 22 15:59:03 2015 UTC,GD if you want to play endgame wotlk or want high rates. Dalaran for low rate progressive wotlk. Atlantiss for cata. Those are your three best options.
wowservers,3apzh0,survivethisyo,3,Mon Jun 22 18:16:23 2015 UTC,"Personally, Wotlk >> Cata and I think the average server quality of each also agrees with that. I think the main thing to keep in mind is that if all 5 of you choose diverse roles it will only take another 5 of you do to 10m raids. This means server pop shouldnt be too much of a concern unless you plan to get into super heavy 25m hardcore stuff where specific specs of classes is a must. Dalaran and GD are the two big wotlk servers right now, but Primal Wow is also a nice upcoming server with a population that is small, but growing. Dalaran has RAF which would make leveling much faster too and is 'progressive', so I'd choose that over GD, but have a look at Primal Wow - its quite social and people are active and committed despite the small pop."
wowservers,3apzh0,iolheal,2,Mon Jun 22 23:25:33 2015 UTC,5 ppl is easy on any server that has RAF system.

In addition to very good scripted quests they have greatly scripted dungeons(all of them, the older ones and the cataclysm ones), even playing by one person there is no problem with low-lvl rdfs even in US timezones, there is a few raiding US guilds.      It is progressive realm, actually opened raids are from t11(first cata tier) and t12 is already tested and in month(or two) will be released(older raids also works, just Sunwell from tbc is closed).      Only problem with Your request would be ""arena scene"", because most of the population is EU and most players are PvE concerned, but even Wintergrasp is scripted.  AND Hogger quest is scripted blizzlike :D ah... they have also RaF system, so normally you play on x1 rates, but with RaF you can have x3 and NO! p2w  **Everything what I posted is only my subjective opinion!**"
wowservers,3apzh0,Drizztu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:55:55 2015 UTC,"You could try PrimalWoW. It's low pop at the moment, but is steadily growing (max. players online has hit 100 last weekend, our ""famous"" reviewer Dodgykebaab recently advocated it). Low pop shouldn't be a major problem anyways, I expect you will roll a tank/heal/3 DD setup? The server has a nice twist to it, it's 3.3.5 core, but currently all non-vanilla content is locked (i.e. level cap is 60, Outland and Northrend are closed, etc.), so it is simulating vanilla, but with RDF and other improvements from the newer patches. They plan on releasing BC and WotLK progressively over the next years."

Try both out, in fact, I'd recommend the 5 of you level on BOTH and then decide once you've tried out some endgame and checked out the PVP etc.  I know that GD has active PVP for sure but has a more EU timeslot for active players.  Every cata and above server I've tried is fkn garbage.  Sorry, but that's just how it is.

Same question for the massive aggro radius, it's abnormally large and level doesn't seem to scale properly with it. Is it any better at 80?   It was bugged at all levels back when I last leveled a few months ago.   As a geared 80 you just stop caring, and it doesn't bother you that much.

I found like 3 bugs total while playing there, and all 3 involved instance bosses that just had a minor glitch, still killable, still 90% blizzlike.  Dalaran is good too, but GD takes the cake IMO, plus, everything is open and available and working.  Just takes more work to find a solid guild, but, they do exist."

There is no harm in trying both and then sticking with the server you prefer...why not level to 15-20 on Kronos then make your own decision.  Early on in the game the scripting between Nos and Kronos is very similar...that changes, and the gap widens quite dramatically as you get on to level 45-60. Where Kronos is very well scripted in the end dungeons, considerably more then Nos.  The advice I always give is try both and choose where you had the most fun. The population is not getting lower, it is in fact growing. www.kronos-census.com, do a weekly average from the numbers on that website. You can see over the week that the average population is slowly growing."

Also if you are from Europe Nostril lags and have a good 1-10 seconds delay in spells and other actions.  US people dont see this because they dont play on peak time."

wowservers,3anh7k,wowserver,2,Tue Jun 23 06:07:10 2015 UTC,I Wonder if u actually Read  the forum link u posted . It just says that they set up the server to dynamicly adapt to the player number on the server to reduce lag. Which means that server lag is reduced for the price of view distance and player rendering. So basically on peak times its still not too good.
wowservers,3anh7k,Fizzy90,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:41:00 2015 UTC,"""Good news for you, our team managed to identify and fix one of the major causes of lag that some players have encountered (responsible for ~60% of the lag spikes during peak times for these players).  A dynamic load mitigation system has also been setup. It means that the server will automatically tune performance settings depending on the detection of players delay (for example, one of them is the view distance which will become greater up to 50% when a performance increase is detected). Other issues related to server performance have been found and will be addressed to continue improving the in-game experience: stay tuned for more information!""

They may be a x7 but you can level it at a x4 by changing the xprate.  Gamer-District already has solid scripting and questing.  There is nothing to be gained from playing on Monster's wrath.  If anything an increased x4-x5 with no cash shop but vanity would have much more appeal to the gaming community.

wowservers,3ak5fa,CaptainButtmad,3,Sun Jun 21 10:48:45 2015 UTC,Dalaran has a higher population now than Gamer-District and a larger NA following to sustain a higher overall population but it does have a faction imbalance.  Which in the end doesn't matter much since pvp is lukewarm over there.  It all comes down to it being a progressive x1 server.  They peak around 200-300 more people than GD but everyone is progressing differently.  At 80 the alternating arena sets make it interesting but there isn't as many 80s as GD since GD is increased xp.  If you are looking for raiding/dungeons than Dalaran is a lot better but if you are looking for the total package I lean toward GD(only if you are EU as NA the population falls below 300)

I would be careful about information that you take from/u/IIIIIIIIIIlIl he seems very against dalaran.  I'm not saying you should play on dalaran. gamer district and warmane are good options a depending on what you want. But this guy is just putting out misinformation just to attack dalaran it seems.   He is right about horde being favored though.  Edit: if it is purely population you are after then warmane is where you want to be.  But you sacrifice a lot for that high pop in terms of bugs. If you only care about pvp then it shouldn't matter as much as long as classes aren't too bugged.

wowservers,3akgox,Autismmprime,6,Sun Jun 21 02:07:29 2015 UTC,"I've said this before, but people's logic here when it comes to choosing a server just makes about 0 sense. You guys, and everybody else who plays on private servers, play on all kinds of shitty servers for whatever reasons, but when it comes to TBC, nothing seems to be good enough ""because of Corecraft"".  With Wotlk, seems like Dalaran's easily the best scripted server, yet people here sometimes complain about its population. With Vanilla, Kronos is the best scripted server, yet again, people here complain about the population and flock to other server(s) for different reasons. But TBC? All of a sudden the quality of the server is what matters?  Best part is, what's happening with Wotlk and Vanilla is all based on peoples experiences actually playing on those servers, yet with TBC, it's all hearsay and hype. I mean...???  insert Jackie Chan meme  As for OP, unless you really want to play vanilla (slow levelling, world pvp, being poor, lvl 60 end-game and whatever else), I'd just play on a TBC server. Vanilla's great in its own right, but it still has the same quests as TBC, just that the end game happens elsewhere. But then again, experiencing vanilla is not such a bad thing."

wowservers,3akgox,schaka,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:18:14 2015 UTC,"I've played Excalibur and Lastwow (both TBC) and my only complaints with those servers is that they offer items for real money. Last I looked, Lastwow had very low population, so it's likely going to go extinct. Excalibur has a good population, 2x exp (so it's faster than live, but leveling still takes some time), but again, it's annoying to see people with full Sunwell gear and you know they've never set foot in there. Edit: I will say that on Lastwow, it was poorly scripted and some fights were really not working well. And at least on Excalibur you can't buy legendaries, whereas on Lastwow, you'd see people with glaives plus green gear, which was stupid.  I'd like one without a cash shop, but have been unable to find one so far.   As far as Vanilla, I've played Nostalrius a bit, and that's a 1x server, so leveling takes a WHILE.   Edit: Thanks to dungeonjay for clarity. Apparently you can't buy full sunwell gear on Excalibur, so that's good at least. No legendaries either. It's better than nothing, but I'd still like no cash shop at all."

It is still a cash shop server but not a server that offers the best in slot gear to be bought.  They also offer a free epic that you can select when you ding 70.  At one point, over two years ago, they offered best in slot items in their cash shop but moved away from it as they themselves saw that this was a direction they didn't want to take.  They do offer a lot best of vendor rep items/recipe items you can purchase which is OP enough if you ask me.

wowservers,3akgox,dungeonjay,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:15:02 2015 UTC,"If you didn't find an issue with LastWoW except for donations, you should probably stop playing WoW.

The core is absolutely horrible, no game mechanics are working as they should. Damage and healing modifiers are fucked, etc. This server is absolute trash and doesn't even deserve being mentioned here.  Even Feenix is like the promised land compared to LastWoW."
wowservers,3ajmpe,My_Fox_Hat,3,Sat Jun 20 21:04:42 2015 UTC,I would stick with a good 1x rate server so you get a good wow leveling experience. As for class I would suggest a class that can do multiple roles so you can decide if you like dpsing tanking or healing the most.

wowservers,3ajmpe,AbareKiller,2,Sun Jun 21 05:04:46 2015 UTC,Well only someone that knows you could answer that. Each expansion has pros and cons that don't apply to everyone. It also depends on your time availability. You also need to decide if you can handle pvp servers. I personally adore tbc but all the servers are further along progressed or dead. For starters I would suggest either primal wow or dalaran wow because even though cata is alot more noob friendly you would miss out on alot of the lore and quests that made most of us fall in love with the game. Plus wotlk classes are too overpowered for the azeroth and tbc content. So it is a fun experience without being too time consuming.
wowservers,3ajmpe,jimgdews,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:45:28 2015 UTC,do you think the classes are overpowered for Tbc and vanilla?
wowservers,3ajmpe,choolete,2,Sun Jun 21 04:59:23 2015 UTC,Well try and level any class up to 20 in any wotlk server and then do the same in a vanilla or tbc one. The wotlk removed cc by buffing classes dramatically. The class balance fixes render the experience up to lvl 70 at least a faceroll

Or find another nice and helpful person - there're plenty of them on the early expansions :)"
wowservers,3ajmpe,nimeral,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:57:12 2015 UTC,"Atlantiss or Dalaran . I would suggest WoTLk because it is a good medium... not too dumbed down like cata started to do, and not too unforgiving like BC and Vanilla.. then from there.. choose which direction you want to head next."
wowservers,3ajmpe,Autismmprime,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:14:26 2015 UTC,"Play WotLK.  Cataclysm is a really boring expansion that saw a lot of lost players.  WoW really did peak in Wrath.  The mechanics aren't difficult to understand, and since the leveling was reduced you won't have a problem getting up to max easily.  Join Dalaran WoW, that expansion is talked about a lot on here."

It will give you a crash course in the feel and playstyles of the expansions then you can pick a leveling expansion to enjoy all the content in.  (and yes, it will be a hard crash course but you will learn fast there and find out which expansion feels right for you without having to level up on multiple different expansion platforms to figure it out)"
wowservers,3ak5at,Redviperyn,5,Sun Jun 21 00:07:25 2015 UTC,Pretty sure warriors have always been the best boss tanks and pallies the best aoe tanks with the other classes being between the two?
wowservers,3ak5at,tacalacataca,3,Sun Jun 21 02:45:46 2015 UTC,"From my experience from retail and private is that its the 'extreme' mitigation spells. Warriors are very nice at reducing the overall damage they take by effective blocking and other such mechanisms but compare them to dk's or prot pallies in how they can survive super heavy bursts and they are inferior.   Also their rage generation is mostly from taking damage. If they are offtanking and are not taking solid continuous damage they can have trouble doing enough damage to have high aggro, also if a mob spawns their control mechanics are worse than dks or pallies ( compare taunt/charge to chains of ice+ dg  or stun undead + both pallies taunts in icc).  I think warriors are viable tanks, but its much harder to play one."
wowservers,3ak5at,iolheal,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:13:20 2015 UTC,"In privates, it depends a lot on how well the class is working. Often enough the avoidance formulas are wrong, aggro generation isn't correct, or certain tank classes have hidden bonuses.  I remember a Death Knight bug where they would gain a huge amount of armor (multiple times the intended) from items that have a 'green' armor bonus, for example.  On private servers, it really depends on the context of how well classes work. Outside of private servers... well, that's another story"
wowservers,3ak5at,mixd3,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:43:30 2015 UTC,"They're viable, but they don't excel at anything. On top of that:  -They take the most damage per second  -Sunder is useless cause it can be done dps warriors.  -No Improved Demoralizing Shout  -His two stuns are not very useful on most encounters  If you're raiding hardcore progressively, warriors are just not your best choice."

Honestly unless you're in a minority timezone i would stick with kronos.  And for the most part if you disliked the crowded nature on nost, while it does get less crowded, the amount of world pvp is intense, you will be ganked a lot, til around lvl 30 you will have to group with people to get the named mob tag and then you reach lvl 52 where you become green to lvl 60s.  I will continue to play on nost since the fact that the server can handle the huge population is great, but if you're EU and you only want to raid, i would stick with kronos."
wowservers,3aijog,yolkol,2,Sun Jun 21 01:35:50 2015 UTC,Honest objective answer:  Nost is going to have a hard time following deadlines for having their manpower tied up fixing other issues because of such a large population.  That doesn't mean they won't get around to it but that their plate is full.  Kronos will more than likely hit all their launch activities as planned because of this.  That doesn't take into account other matters for instance as their own timetables and happenings in the lives of these developers on these servers.

I queue for a battleground at 10-19, 20-29. 5 seconds to 5 minutes later the queue pops. BG gets filled up within 30 seconds after that.

Also, Kronos does not peak at 700-800 players. That number you see is per faction. So 1500+ players peak (I've seen up to 1.1k per faction). Which is amazing for a private server.

wowservers,3af4af,ruvvy9,3,Fri Jun 19 16:51:18 2015 UTC,"Population is 1.5-2k at peak times, but it's hard to say for sure as there's no official counter.   There's T4 pugs/kara's running all day, as there are T5 pugs, but 90% of them are GDKP's of T6 guilds. Highest current End-Game is 5/5 MH and 9/9 BT, with ZA just recently released. All of the raids work well, although ZA is a bit buggy as it is new.  Donations are far and few between. It's true you can donate for any and all gear, but have you seen the shop prices? It's anywhere from 100-300 euro per piece, with glaives being 700 for 1. Needless to say, it is nothing like Molten.  The worst things about Feenix that I have experienced in the past were the amount of Ddos attacks/crashes and how poorly they were being handled. Now, the server rarely will crash once per day, and even has 2-3+ days without a single one.  TLDR: ""Feenix is absolute trash, but Excalibur has even worse P2W and game mechanics/scripts. Therefore, Feenix is the better choice (also has more PvP activity) and you can level faster without wasting all your time."" Quoted from a similar thread."
wowservers,3af4af,pikunul,2,Fri Jun 19 18:19:27 2015 UTC,"Everything the above poster wrote is true, and I agree with.  My experience with feenix en-totals may 2014 - may 2015 on Feenix TBC/Vanilla Pve and PVP, in my objective opinion Feenix's AA server is meh.    The server is simply a vanilla coded core with outlands added, and a few bandaids slapped on it.  Pathing is bugged, unique tbc content like khadgar's elemental follow and talk shattrath quest doesnt have a prayer of working, ect.  It has the population, because Feenix has other, better worked servers which draw sideways population (vanilla to tbc).   In general, thanks to feenix's fairly decent vanilla servers, AA is playable.  For example the chess event will never work and is missing but most of kara is doable. PVE is playable, though in PVP higher experienced players can take advantage of the bugs. The admins don't spend a great deal of time on AA, as in their eyes the bugs of the server are a nonissue as the server still has population.    Personally on AA I leveled 14x, got to 70, geared out and raided somewhat,  and said meh this isnt worth it, went played something else.  Feenix's AA is playable because no amazing pve/pvp TBC realm has emerged, and Corecraft is finding out how hard it is to code a server with two people. (so suprised!)  Also worth noting, Feenix is run by a propaganda spewing megalomaniac named a%hairne who bans anything disagreeing with his worldview and prefers to stick his fingers in his ears rather than fix known problems, so you can imagine some there are transparency issues with the leadership.  Most of the GM staff are decent people however. (or were before he ran them off)"

wowservers,3af4af,only777,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:58:32 2015 UTC,Really? What turned me off from Excalibur was how cheap their pay-to-win prices are. At least on feenix the items are far more expensive which means it's less likely people will pay for items.   I thought I'd hate anything not x1 xp rate but getting to level 70 in a few days was very enjoyable with their x14 rates.  Can you explain why you suggest Excalibur over feenix?  P.s. I love your YouTube videos
wowservers,3af4af,only777,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:24:56 2015 UTC,The team behind Excalibur are far more active in terms of bug fixes and quality scripting than Feenix.  Plus the Feenix team is as corrupt as shit.

wowservers,3afeb6,Bastardometer,2,Sat Jun 20 04:59:30 2015 UTC,"Nobody wants to leave behind their characters on Nost/Kronos. They put too much work into them.

wowservers,3afeb6,jetsfan07,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:10:36 2015 UTC,"Not everyone has/play characters on those realms. Ascension has been online much longer than those two. No one just won't join a server with no hope.  For PvE'rs it's either Ascension relaunch fresh or Stormrage releases. There was some rumors about Nostalrius PvE realm but I don't know anything about that, their PvP server/community is shitty enough not to recommend it, but if it's true there's going to be a guaranteed high population.   There is also Primal-WoW, but it's a bastardized version of vanilla with WotLK but that server at least has a chance for a bright future."
wowservers,3afeb6,ahelfcmnaofsdgchracm,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:09:27 2015 UTC,"lol @ Freud  Well I can say that judging by first impressions, the only major exception with regards to population is Nost.  There seemed to be a lot of new players around the starting areas, however within my first 20 minutes the server went down twice.  People were also talking about rollbacks recently in chat.  Perhaps bad timing on my part, but a bad first impression regardless.   Kronos had about 30 people on alliance side but no one in starting zone.  I was able to snag one person to start up on Ascension and the only downside so far is the low pop.  Looks to be about 20 people on now, so not exactly dead - since most free servers that aren't FUN, instant cap, or high rates tend to have lower pop as well.  Some things to consider.  I think it's just that vicious cycle of no one wanting to join a low pop server.  Perhaps it's a difference in how Ascension is advertising, they seem to be more low key?"

And they launched with 300 players and call it a success, as hilarious as it is sad. To have such low standards or set such a low bar. It's quite literally stock TC, except for some improvements in pathfinding, but that's all, from what I've observed and has been confirmed by a staff member from within, who said stock TC is good enough to launch with. Just look at the videos they've created to promo the server with, it's a laughing stick in comparison to other projects. This is incredibly underwhelming for as stated having this golden opportunity, but they threw it away with miniscule effort in both development and marketing. A shame, more than anything.

wowservers,3adbow,Redviperyn,3,Fri Jun 19 04:43:59 2015 UTC,as a tank you have to know what the raid encounter entails youtube tankspot videos and they will help you understand each encounter. naxx will be your first raid. just farm heroics and use badges to buy feral tank gear. or get healing gear if you would rather do that. also download deadly boss mods it will notify you of things during encounters while raiding. other than that just farm heroics and get gear then you will be ready for naxx but try to prepare the best you can
wowservers,3adbow,tacalacataca,3,Fri Jun 19 04:52:30 2015 UTC,"this is good advice. Heroics will get you ready for raiding and watching videos is a must if you are going to tank.

You can pull up their vidoes on Youtube just by adding tankspot and Naxx or Ulduar or w/e.  But, the first raid is Naxx.  You can probably pull up a full raid from beginning to end on some video since streaming videos on youtube became really popular around 2008."

Some things are limited like jc/inscription not being in vanilla etc. Currently, the realm has a small server pop though.  I've been messing around on private servers for a while now and I dont think I've seen anything as radical as changing the resource for a class (mana to focus). Perhaps the closest thing to that would be some servers which have their own custom classes that incorporate 'newer' features like worgens, monks, etc on older servers, but from what I have seen they are very buggy and not worthwhile."

wowservers,3ackh7,Cover25,2,Fri Jun 19 00:38:05 2015 UTC,If you are NA and this is your playing time Dalaran will be the most populated of the two Cover mentioned but both are very enjoyable for the scripting compared to Molten(Warmane).

wowservers,3ach06,IIIIIIIIIIlIl,3,Fri Jun 19 00:31:58 2015 UTC,That report is garnered for one playing side?  Not total population of both factions.  The /who doesn't cover horde and alliance together nor does that scan.  You have to log on both sides to do it properly or just /who and add (alliance number) + (horde number)....  Right now...rounded down numbers on those factions at 8:40 Eastern Standard time there are 535 horde + 350 Alliance.  Roughly 900 people online combining both factions.    Update  10:30 Eastern Standard Time Horde (450) alliance (320)  Still almost 800 people on at this time.  It chugs along pretty good for NA timezones but it will continue to drop off to somewhere around 350-500 people before picking back up.

wowservers,3ach06,dungeonjay,-2,Fri Jun 19 14:49:14 2015 UTC,"Definitely not 800-900.   The times you listed there's probably a good 400/450 total, and that's being a bit generous.   Still enough to do everything you would normally do (besides pvp), but just a lot slower."
wowservers,3ach06,IIIIIIIIIIlIl,2,Fri Jun 19 00:25:31 2015 UTC,I can agree with what Pikunul says.  The population combined isn't much more than 500 12:00 am Eastern standard.  Definately more popping than GD though fer sure.  Gamer-District(my other favorite wrath server) bottoms out to like 250 by 10am Eastern Standard.
wowservers,3abnts,lolbob2,2,Thu Jun 18 20:06:02 2015 UTC,"If you're not into endless grinding Vanilla is probably not for you. However I do recommend trying out a server with 1x exp first. It's the way the game was designed to play out, and ""spoiling"" yourself with super fast leveling is not gonna help you learn neither the game nor the class you're playing. Regarding servers to choose from, look at the stickied post at the top of this subreddit. It losts most popular servers."
wowservers,3abnts,Snabeldraken,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:12:39 2015 UTC,"The leveling process isn't what I'd call meaningful learning experience. It's tedious and very few concepts of end game concepts are introduced, if at all any. Spend 20-30 minutes reading and memorizing what each ability does for your own class, while taking mental notes of what other classes have, is probably the best way to learn the very basics."
wowservers,3abnts,bossmodexyz,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:34:49 2015 UTC,"I agree and disagree. The actual questing to maxlevel won't make you ""ready to raid"", but the game is so much more than just raiding or arena PvP. Reading the tooltips of a class's abilities doesn't make up for actually trying them out for yourself, learning the layout of the world or the importance of the other players around you.  The Leveling process also acts as a way of introducing you into the world and it's inhabitants. By the time you've hit max level there's a good chance you will have figured out that npcs with staffs are probably spellcasters, which types of mobs you can pull several at a time, what zones are filled with what kind of gathering nodes etc...  There's pros and cons to both low and highrate servers, but if your goal is not just to down all raidbosses of your expansion, but actually enjoy all aspects of the game, leveling at 10X will probably leave the player with alot of unanswered questions."

WoW circle truly is 99% Russian players, no english guilds whatsoever, some english players but it is rare, almost no chance of raiding there.  Monster Wow = Mediocre WoW, uses the same core warmane does just a little bit more fixes.  Atlantiss is the best cataclysm server by far, the 1-85 experience is flawless almost all the scripted quests i came upon worked near perfect, leveled while queing RDF popped pretty fast and done plenty of dungeons on the way, really worth investing your time in a server like."

wowservers,3a755c,ugathanki,11,Wed Jun 17 19:23:51 2015 UTC,"I'm currently playing on this server and I am having a great time. I think that the server takes the better features from wotlk and adds them to the vanilla game. Things like RDF, dual spec, more viable talent trees, but nothing too game breaking like jc and inscription, which are being released at their relevant patches.  Only problem is the population which fluctuates between 40-80 depending on the time, but the server isn't very old and the population has been noticeably growing in the last week.  Im and OCE player and my ping is around 300-400 so that shouldnt be an issue for NA players either. If you do play this server join horde as it is underpopulated, but crossfaction grouping is helping that temporarily."

You don't need days to setup TrinityCore either. You still need a good amount of time to 'install' a repack since the database doesn't really setup itself. You'll still need MySQL or whatever backend the server is using, you'll still need share data (maps/vmaps/mmaps)...  If you know what you're doing, then go ahead, use a repack. But don't deny it's unsafe."

wowservers,3a74u9,Tiberiuss7,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:52:53 2015 UTC,"Archangel (Feenix): MH/BT Top-End raids right now, along with ZA just recently released. Peak of ~1.5-2k (hard to say since no counter). x14 rates. End-Game is fairly well scripted, such as dungeons/raids, but the leveling experience is fairly slacking but I suppose that's what the high rates are for. Can donate for any and all gear, but t6+ gear is $200 per piece so very very expensive (glaives are 700 for 1).  Excalibur: All TBC content released including SWP. Peak population of 2k. x2 rates with x4 monthly vote events. End-Game is well scripted, along with the leveling quests/dungeons, etc. Few custom things such as cross faction raiding, world chat, etc. Can donate for gear, just not SWP items, and for fairly cheap prices. A big downside to this is you could once donate for glaives, so there are a lot of rogues running around with them when you clearly see they should not have them.  Both are pretty stable in terms of crashes, although I'd probably give Feenix the medal for that one as Excalibur has had a few issues dealing with the recent population gain."
wowservers,3a74u9,pikunul,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:21:15 2015 UTC,Also as far as i remember they (Excalibur) give a free epic (no wep) when a player hits lvl 70. It's a total turn off when you see ppl freshly 70 with green items and t6/brutal shoulders or KJ helm

wowservers,3a74u9,Silez,0,Thu Jun 18 03:46:25 2015 UTC,"I have a few 70s on Feenix and have ragequit due to DDos and I blew a gasket when the servers were DDosed while I was in Gruul which took FOREVER to get a raid together for. People with lvl 16 greens in heroic blaming me (the guy in D3) for why the group is doing bad. I also dislike the Feenix Staff and I have considered Excalibur despite the fact that I hate lvling but I have good character knowledge in a few classes from Retail Experience and I play on Smolderforge (instant 70 PvP) for fun. If Feenix and Excalibur are the Top 2 TBC servers to date, any chance there's something else out there that might be better? Maybe even a server thats new with Season 1 pvp and T4 Progression woth a future T5 and S2 content Release and so on? I personally like to prepare myself with the right gear for what content I'm on but Feenix and Excalibur players tend to complain you being D3 in Heroic and they expect a T6 Tank, Heal or DPS which is spoiled for some players and I can understand but they have greens in heroic...and some of their pieces aren't even TBC greens... I kinda expect the player version of my rant but the DDos are what drives me nuts on Feenix and so much of the server is bugged even after so much time this server has been open. I believe this server has been around for at least 6 years too with same bugs"
wowservers,3a74u9,Escoliarth,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:01:29 2015 UTC,"I can assure you the Ddos issue isn't really a factor anymore. It was solved long ago. The stability has gotten a lot better and sometimes goes on for days without crashing. I can't really attest to the bugs part, but with new devs being added, bugs seem to be being fixed on a timely manner now (long overdue but at least they're getting somewhere now).  As for other TBC servers, people seem to like this server called Vengeance-WoW. It's a x1 rate TBC server that aims to be blizz-like with progressive dungeon/raid release, although most people seem to dislike it as the population is rather low."
wowservers,3a74u9,pikunul,2,Thu Jun 18 13:05:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this info. I have been hearing more of vengeance and am interested in it despite the population of the server.

wowservers,3a6nf9,Boogahboogah,2,Wed Jun 17 17:21:22 2015 UTC,"Use the first spec while you're hit rating is still under 195. anything over 205 hit rating is excess hit rating so then I'd use the second spec I put. Hit rating cap for all TBC Raid content is 195 for Fury warriors and you need your hit cap as most your damage will come from white damage (normal attacks). I used these in Retail TBC and they worked for me.  First Spec: http://calculators.iradei.eu/talents/warrior.htm?330050013020000000000005500300250501015312510000000000000000000000  Second Spec: http://calculators.iradei.eu/talents/warrior.htm?330050013020000000000005500300450501025012510000000000000000000000  The Spec explained...  In the Fury Tree: Must haves are Cruelty, Dual Wield Spec, Enrage, Sweeping, Flurry, Bloodthirst, Improve zerk stance and Rampage. Must have Precision while working on hit cap. The rest are personal preference. You can use your 5 points from Booming Voice into Commanding Presence or Unbridled Wrath as well. I like to max my Improve Cleave because as melee DPS like to be spoiled with max improve on battleshout for raid dps, you are judged by your damage output, not raid in general so Cleave with 3/3 improve helps me keep top damage in aoe fights when used with Whirlwind and Sweeping Strikes should be used to stack the damage. You don't need Weapon Mastery because if the server is well scripted, your attacks aren't dodged if you're behind the enemy or on its sides and you shouldn't be in front of the boss to begin with as a DPS. YOu're also almost never disarmed during raids so this talent is overall useless in PVE DPS terms. Imp Slam is arguable. If you use this talent, learn to time it well with your hits. I personally prefer using this as 2H arms but that's me. Others like using it as it's another attack to have but I personally like seeing my rage bar higher to use my primary spells more often. Try it out of you like and choose for yourself. I personally don't roll with it.  In the Arms Tree: Deep Wounds and Impale are Must haves! Crits = Bleeds and Impale makes those Crits hurt more. I like Anger Management for the rage gen and the Imp Heroic Strike Talent is useful to keep your rage bar from starving but you usually want to just use heroic strike as a rage dumper for excess rage. Prioritize WW, BT, Rampage and Especially Execute. Iron WIll helps your uptime on damage. I figure deflection is best spot to put my extra talent points that I needed to get to deep wounds and impale but you can put them into improved charge if you like. I don't believe in using Rend or Overpower as Fury because that will make you have to stance dance to put them in good use and that just dumps your rage and you NEED Rage! You should be sitting in Berserk Stance for the duratiuon of the fight anyways as PVE Fury DPS. Hope this helps"

wowservers,3a1e8s,NoobFor3ver,5,Wed Jun 17 11:35:00 2015 UTC,"I think it should be mentioned that it's still a very young server. Only a bit over 1 month of uptime so far and most of the people are still leveling up and doing low level dungeons and such. This is especially why I was attracted to this server even though the population is low. The online peak has been growing daily and you shouldn't be afraid of its low playerbase especially if you are interested in the server being progressive and new without people running around in full epics and such. Obviously the idea doesn't sound very good for everyone but for those that it does, definitely give it a try. I just got to level 30 and I've encountered 0 quests being bugged so far. Only thing that I found slightly ""annoying"" is the pathing of mobs in some zones like the cave in valley of trials."
wowservers,3a1e8s,ceh789,2,Tue Jun 16 15:35:43 2015 UTC,"Pathing issues seems to be a real problem on most non-vanilla servers and it is definitely something that I tend to test out in the first few levels.   Unlike other servers I have played on like Atlantiss, the line of sight pathing actually isnt that bad at all. It seemed problematic in some of the more crowded mines in Elwynn Forest but I didn't have any mobs pathing through trees to get to me. In fact I could easily mess with caster mobs but ducking behind large trees and losing their LOS on me negating their attack.  Mobs will jump (not go through) fences instead of going around like you see on Nost and Kronos which seemed a little ridiculous there tbh. It was easy to abuse that unrealistic pathing there.   Also, you are right I should had drawn more attention to the fact that the server and population is very very new. As I sit here now, there is less than 20 people on right now over level 40. :)"
wowservers,3a1e8s,emenems,2,Tue Jun 16 21:09:29 2015 UTC,"It is a very young server and I'm enjoying that part of it quite a bit, personally.    As you said there are a few minor annoyances - i.e. pathing particularly in areas over caves (i.e. Searing Gorge).  Quest buggyness is very low - I'm currently ~25 quests shy of Loremaster on both continents and haven't run into any yet that are bugged and cannot be fixed immediately using the Quest Completer tool on the website - which frankly, is a lot more than I can say about quest buggyness when I levelled in retail Vanilla!  Like I said above - if you want to give it a try on Horde side, feel free to send me a tell (Fishie) and I'll set you up with some bags."
wowservers,3a1e8s,ceh789,2,Tue Jun 16 23:55:09 2015 UTC,Interesting POV - personally I don't think I have ever viewed a changelog on a server.

Also, remember that we have Dungeon Finder - you'll see a lot in world chat people saying 'need 2 DPS for DF around level 25' or similar then see that group in a dungeon 2 minutes later.  True to the pure Vanilla experience, no, but people seem to be liking it.  We're getting to know each other despite using DF because there just aren't enough of us for people to be jerks to each other and get away with it."

wowservers,3a1e8s,bobdolejritis,4,Wed Jun 17 05:21:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's 1x.  But that's WotLK 1x where experience requirements are lower, quest rewards are higher and there are more quests.  1-60 takes roughly 48 hours played."
wowservers,3a1e8s,KnaxxLive,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:24:22 2015 UTC,I was going to ask this question myself.  Does this server have the XP crunch that both TBC and WotLK implemented?
wowservers,3a1e8s,bobdolejritis,-2,Tue Jun 16 22:22:27 2015 UTC,"I know, it's still too long.  I have a buddy who is at over 100 hours played and is just now lvl 71 (I realize it can be done faster but I play in short spurts like he does, so it would take me probably that long as well).  Considering I have MAYBE 3-4 hours per week to play, it would take me 5 months just to hit 80, and that's just for one character  NOPE...  I usually like to have two toons , one for tank/heals PVE, and one for DPS PVE / PVP.  That means I would have to spend nearly a year just to get two lvl 80's on Dalaran, and not even geared 80's....  I did that nonsense in retail, never again.  The alternative is to play on GD, level to 80 in 8-12 hours on a weekend, spend 4 hours getting rep up, getting rep gear to get into heroics, and within a week being able to enter starting raids, on a server that is of equal quality.  Much preferred.  Your downvotes only prove the level of fanboi ness here.  I'm sorry that I don't have 3 hours every night to level, it's my CHOICE to not put that much effort into a single character.  Some of us go outside...."
wowservers,3a1e8s,KnaxxLive,0,Wed Jun 17 16:33:00 2015 UTC,"Then do that?  Or just join an instant level cap server where you don't have ""to be bothered"" leveling at all."

wowservers,3a1e8s,IIIIIIIIIIlIl,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:49:31 2015 UTC,"You asked why I don't play on instant servers, I responded that they are not as high of quality, then you said this ""You really aren't making sense. You pretty much said you don't like leveling, so I suggested an instant level cap server. I comprehended everything you said.""  which shows that you apparently did not comprehend everything I said, or you would not have, once again, recommended sub par instant servers.  This sinking in yet?  Here, I'll simplify it even further, IF there were instant lvl 80 servers, that were as polished as Dalaran or GD, I would DEFINITELY play there, but EVERY single instant server I have played on, either had ridiculous custom content, or had buggy instances  /  raids.  Until the time that such issues are resolved, and an instant server exists that does not have these problems, I will reside on GD.  If Dalaran ever ups their XP rate, or adds a 2nd higher xp rate server, I would consider switching, because I do like the fact that Dalaran doesn't have the custom portals or P2W items like Frostmourne...  Better?  As a side note, I don't HATE leveling, I just hate spending more than say, 12-24 hours leveling a character.  Which 7-14x servers seem to hit that sweet spot where I don't feel burned out, and I don't feel like I'm reliving 2008 all over again.  Hopefully this helps clarify whatever the disconnect is that you're bumping into in this conversation."

wowservers,3a1e8s,ceh789,-2,Tue Jun 16 14:22:30 2015 UTC,"Even tho it sounds ""unique"" the system, I don't think is planned enough and they are rushing in something that they have no experience.  I was checking the forums from TW and I have read also other ""announcements"" here from this server. It had a development of a week, and during that time, the owner already changed a lot of things and made custom a lot more.  It is not really trustable seeing how the owner and the team are letting die their other server, and promoting a new one, because now it is their new candy, because they have seen how the words progressive and blizzlike sells out on pservers.  My 2 cents: 1)  if he really cared about this project he could at least programmed it a bit more time, checking the pros and cons + show some interesting stuff, like their raids or something. 2) they made wrong spamming about this server, they think because it worked out with the other server they had, but now their other server is slowly dying, it seems that they do not remember they have people because the have merged with other servers, and they already flew away when they saw the reality.  So how can we trust this ""long project"" when their basic one is not really finished, and now they are letting it die? People will not invest in something for 6 years, when they will have no proof it gonna last and what they will find, if their scripting is the same, then is not worth it, if they said it has more scripting or a different one, it is a lie, simply because no one can script or adjust even the vanilla raids properly in 1 week.  Peace!"
wowservers,3a1e8s,Cover25,3,Tue Jun 16 15:03:07 2015 UTC,"This entire post reminded me of the American Dad skit, with the two Swedish brothers that ""almost"" know how to speak English.  : D  English translation of the post above this one:  According to reviewswow4u, the owner of this server had a previous server that he/they never fully completed.  Then they merged with another server, and then apparently gave up on it and started advertising this new server without showing any real proof that it would be any better than the last server.  He also claims that they are adding more and more customizations that they had claimed would not exist, and that the entire server was developed in the timespan of a week.  After this he urged everyone here to be highly skeptical of this new server, assuring us it is all lies, and nothing will be as promised.  He then said ""peace!"" and that was the end of his post."
wowservers,3a1e8s,GianSeehra,2,Tue Jun 16 16:25:32 2015 UTC,"I have played here and I sort of agree. The server launched just like that without any previous announcement and the main dev was happily doing dungeons and leveling with other players instead of attending to bugs. First impression was this is just some 14 years old kid spur of the moment server. Made me doubt the longevity of the project. First there wasn't to be Onyxia and Naxx, now it has been discussed these could technically be scripted in. There wasn't RDF, then there was, then rewards were removed. Stuff is just made on the go, that's quite a oversight.  All the balancing around instances and raiding has been done after the release with players being the testers. Some of it is shoddy workarounds, like keeping some instance doors open because they haven't been scripted right, or nerfing all the players who are in Azshara to make Azuregos harder even if they are just questing. And Azuregos was made hostile because it had reset problems in the middle of fight as neutral. The nerfing reaches to all lvl 60 instances which breaks many addons because they show normal values for your spells and abilities and not the nerfed ones and even the scale of the nerfs have changed drastically, so there never had been any kind of testing prior to launch.  There is no denying any of this. Despite the negativity of my post so far, I don't mind this. Actually gives some kind of vanilla uncompleteness feeling. The main dev is a good guy and does his GM duties and fixes things. This is a custom server with a refreshing idea, but the customization has a logic behind it with not room for any ""fun server"" stuff."

wowservers,3a1y4r,choolete,2,Tue Jun 16 22:44:18 2015 UTC,It's mostly that there isn't a good TBC server out there at the moment.
wowservers,3a1y4r,Aodhyn,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:23:29 2015 UTC,Well the 1-58 questing will not be scripted so not really. But I guess they are only scripting TBC content.
wowservers,3a1y4r,LordRukia,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:03:51 2015 UTC,It's gonna be nightmarish. If you had played TBC you will know. I even remember that they had not implemented the accelerated mobs spawn if many people were in the same area. The best method is find 4 more people and run the first 2 instaces till 62. You will get to honored with your faction there (without any quests which will make getting to revered and more really easy) and you will get ahead of others by going to Zangarmarsh.

wowservers,3a326s,narutoperk,2,Tue Jun 16 21:01:41 2015 UTC,I did it in past. Sometimes doing it now too but its to hot. I remember in my old guild half of the raid was drinking always and guild master got rly pissed cuz of that. People was talking more about real life stuff than raiding. Also loss reactions etc so we started to wipe a lot. I was on guild in feenix where half of the raid was on drugs... That was even worse than drunk raid. Raid leader was on meth once and gave half of the items to wrong ppl without even know about that. Next day he was mad about that.
wowservers,3a326s,Nuber132,2,Tue Jun 16 21:11:30 2015 UTC,Its not funny its retarded... maybe u have fun but other ppl in raid have to carry u because u are playing worse and u can wipe raid (on some bosses).

You can always go back to Nost if things get better, but in that case, at least you had some fun while waiting. And no, I don't consider it a waste of time to play on different servers. If I'm having fun, I'm having fun, that's enough."
wowservers,3a0mle,Mephea,5,Tue Jun 16 09:34:51 2015 UTC,"On peak times there is usually a game of WSG going on all low end brackets. Especially 10-19 and 30-39.  I am currently leveling a char through the 40s and have not seen a BG pop...but thats usual since a lot of people without mounts do not want to PvP at that point.  60 is alive and well with quite a few WSG going all the time and ABs too. The PvP scene is alive and well on Kronos especially at higher levels.  If you are looking for World PvP...it has quite the annoying presence as well especially inthe more popular zones, I am at least engaging with an ally every hour or so with my 40 in STV, Badlands and Swamp of Sorrows.  The best piece of advice is to dive in and give it a try. As has been rightfully said, you won't loose that character on Nos, if you leveled 20 levels on Kronos and felt it was a waste of time ... that other character will still be there, and quite possibly the annoying lag that made you leave in the first place. So really you don't have much to loose :)  Last note: If anything the population is growing.

Kronos satisfies both of your issues with Nost. We have enough people (and slowly growing) that at most levels and certainly at 60 finding dungeon groups and catching BG queues is not an issue. The population is very health for EU and is growing for NA.   The server has legs due to the allure, promise and so far successful delivery of blizzlike raiding content. The raiders aren't leaving. Many of us PVP as well.   Considering your limited play, making the switch now is a great idea. AV releases early next month and BWL comes out in August. By the time you reach Max level the evidence will be on the table. If the raid is bugless and ""the most polished iteration of BWL on any private server to date"" Kronos will be here to stay until Kel'Thuzad is dead many times over."

Regardless, the lag that's much less should make melee PvP a lot more enjoyable."
wowservers,3a0mle,sour_sp,2,Tue Jun 16 16:14:42 2015 UTC,"I don't. I'm not melee and haven't needed to sit down and test. Based on kiting experiences I would say it is, but don't hold me to that.   Yeah, the latency is similar to the point you wouldn't notice. But, the server is so unresponsive on Nost. I played for a little bit there, it reminded me of 25m raiding in MoP how there was ""input lag"" from all of the periodic spells and ground effects constantly going off which bogged down the system.

The vast majority of WoW's game logic is server-side, and is not released with the client. For this reason, each private server has to implement their own scripts, aka ""how this world works"". This covers everything from behaviour of NPCs, skills, quests, raids and so on."
wowservers,39wesn,_RaoulDuke,6,Mon Jun 15 10:59:36 2015 UTC,"Very nontechnical basic description of scripting.  Fight scripting usually deals with phases and mob abilities/spells. Take Onyxia for example. She has quite a few phases once her health drops to certain levels. Scripting makes sure she performs the correct actions/emotes/walk path/flight path at the correct time or health percentage.  Quest scripting is similar. Take escort quests for example, scripting escort quests means making sure the escort NPC is walking the right path, at the right speed, engaging mobs the correct way, using correct abilities and saying the correct speech lines/emotes at the correct time. Other quests has events like Ammo of Rumbleshot or Curego's Gold, which require scripting so the correct speech lines or mob spawns or events happen.  Of course live servers work the same way, they design the scripts, events, abilities and everything else and have hundreds of people working on the game so scripting feels seamless and flows nicely. Private servers try to recreate these scripts so close as possible...its never going to be 100% because we just don't know the script lines used by Blizzard and have to make it up ourselves, if we did...that would make life much easier and we would have loads of blizzlike private servers"

Little bits and pieces we take for granted could takes ages to put together and make sure it works perfectly...since a lot of things dev's put into their server tends to be buggy/or bugs something else in the game...so to make everything work in cohesion is a massive feat.

Maybe you're not even controlling your own character, but flying a bird along a cliff in the Howling Fjord to collect eggs and dodge other birds and so on.   very easy quests may not even need scripts, just some entries in the creature/loot database normal quests may use SmartAI Scripts (SAI) but I've also heard that Atlantiss for example wants to implement LUA for their server side scripting as well complicated quests may use C++"

D) Shadowform + Imp. Inner Fire meant I had over 40% physical dmg reduction. Throw a PW:S on top of that and melee doesn't hit anywhere near as hard anymore.  E) Priest trinket broke stuns.  Priests could stomp all over rogues with just a smidgen of luck, and usually beat them even without it unless the rogue went all out and blew all his/her CDs. The only rogues that were a legitimate threat to Shadow priests were the ones who opened with Garrote and then exposed your armor, playing against you like it's a DPS race. Undead Rogues were the only class I legitimately worried about as a Nelf Shadowpriest. Had I been a dwarf they would have been easier, and if I were an UD SP I wouldn't have worried about rogues at all except during a duel."

About their scripts. I belive only AT is fixing now, class balance etc, molten is fixing 5-6 stuff only (this is how they did it in past). Major stuff like quest scripts (specially legendary one), DoT mechanics, ratings, arent going to get fixed. If only 20% of community know for this bugs its ok, we can hide them under the carpet. Before someone tell me u cant fix legendary quest chains, this is from changelog on atlantiss (Fix chaining, add quest npcs and other fixes to few first quests for Teracgosa Legendary Staff). If they fix old raids and dungeons their server will crash a way more, more scripts = bigger chance to crash something. They still lie about release dates, what happen to their wod? Release date was 24 march 2015... It is same cash cow. Just people refuse to invest time into an other server. About MoP i understand them, all mop servers right now are crap."

I don't personally think they have that many people donating to their cause.  I actually see population decline there.  Warmane is not the old Molten in more ways than one.  They actually closed and merged an expansion server?    I hear grumbling(nothing official) that AT is not happy with the merge and they may well just leave.    The house is not settled there.  The foundation is cracked and who knows when Kaer might land in the basement.  Personally, I think their hand is in too many cookie jars over there.  They just can't focus on the immersion aspect and that is my personal opinion why the servers are declining in population.  This especially being the case because when compared to other servers their's are better(especially in the Wrath/Cata market).   Maybe not MoP because all are shit.    tl;dr - They are barely staying above water financially.  I don't think people are donating money that much and the population is declining."

It also is x7 xp which means you level extremely fast.  They have the option to allow you to do x1 if you want with a .xprate change command.  They have open communication and trade between horde/alliance and as you level you can do cross-faction dungeons with RDF.  This function ends as soon as you get to Wrath content.    Dalaran features: No /who for other side. No mailing between horde/alliance except boas. Custom progression with raid tier blocking(Meaning having to finish Naxx before you can enter Ulduar). Rotating pvp gear based on season(cannot gear pvp out of season). Cannot enter raids out of ilevel even if you finished Ulduar and return to Naxx to help a guildmate get past the progression barrier.    Dalaran feels more like the blizzlike experience to me since I play on both.  But both have their pluses and minus I presume.  Conclusion, both have custom content/interfaces.

It has a progressive system where you need to clear previous raid tiers before entering next ones. Meaning you can't enter Ulduar without having done Naxxramas.

If you want to play WotLK Blizzlike, I'd recommend either Dalaran-WoW (1x, progressive, well scripted, decent pop), True-WoW (1x, everything released, medium pop) or Gamer-District (7x, everything released, very good scripts, decent pop)  Though, check the sticky: https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/37b5ir/wow_private_servers_list/"

Otherwise, you are just spinning the wheels over there.  I go with Mixd3 on Wrath servers.  Dalaran or Gamer-District because frankly if they had launched when Warmane launched one of those two would be the dominant king in Wrath by comparision on scripted servers.    Warmane's servers have been hard reset less than six months ago and they are re-scripting it back to where it was.  Their wrath servers are their best examples(cata and mop realms are just level to top and pvp)for scripting but that is because 85% of the code is already written on the core they use and are reworking.....they have probably the most accurate class mechanics for pvp , however."

Having an additional site to visit for the same subjects is not that compelling to alot of people, this is one of the reasons reddit is so popular, as there's subreddits for basically anything. All on one easy to navigate website.  While having a dedicated webpage for you own content is a good way of making it easy to access if someone is looking for it, it actually makes it harder for people to come across it, as common searchterms will lead to bigger sites, liked ownedcore and Reddit."
wowservers,39spjy,fewmore1,8,Sun Jun 14 11:42:23 2015 UTC,"If it was a TBC server, yes, I would. If it was cata, probably not as I don't think they could provide better quality than what Atlantiss already does. If it was MoP, no, just because I don't enjoy that expansion."
wowservers,39spjy,pikunul,2,Sun Jun 14 11:53:18 2015 UTC,"I've never had the chance to play TBC because I discovered WoW quite late, but if Dalaran opens a new realm I'd definitely play on it. Currently playing their WOTLK."
wowservers,39spjy,ghandi91,2,Sun Jun 14 12:03:42 2015 UTC,Honestly I think it's very unhealthy for any server to be running a TBC server due to Corecraft. They should probably invest in either a Cata server or merge teams with Atlantiss and run side by side.

wowservers,39subq,grizzlytroll,3,Sun Jun 14 12:52:12 2015 UTC,"I play on Atlantiss and I'll just go ahead and give you my overall opinion on the server.  I started from scratch, on my paladin and absolutely stomped through the vanilla content with little to zero issues what so ever. Every single instance was working at top tier level and I was just straight up in awe. There's plenty of people queuing for rdf's so the queue times obviously aren't that long, even without the 1000+ players at peak times. It seems like there's a lot of PvE constantly going on, people looking for people to join raids, etc.  In terms of PvP, I'm not too sure. I'm currently level 65 on my death knight and there's been a few world pvp encounters but not much, even then, people tend to leave each other alone and level. It might be different at lvl 85, though. The server's uptime is pretty good, there's the occasional crash/dc but that happens on every server. It comes right back up after. Ping is great if you're from europe, so is the population, but I'd imagine that the US wouldn't be too bad at all.   The staff are constantly working on scripts and fixes, and I believe they're currently working on Firelands.   Overall, awesome server and you won't regret playing on it. There's no other cataclysm server or in that matter any other better scripted server over all. Sure, there's minor issues like the odd quest that doesn't work, but they've done their best at making it completable by auto-completing some of the bugged quests.  If you roll Alliance, feel free to add me, name's Gusk :)  EDIT: Just to clarify, this is in no way a biased reply. I've played on lots of other servers, Nost, Vengeance, Warmane, etc and this server just beats them in terms of scripting."

After that we are gonna have only water and air in our planet. Then, we just boil all the water we have in order to leave only the air. After all this process, we are gonna be called Planet Air.  Now why did I choose air instead of water or earth? Well, because then we would be flying around the core of Planet Air. We would be able to orbit it, which would be like flying. We would always be falling and stuff  There is your idea!"

On Nostalrius there are constantly battlegrounds. Atleast on 10-19 what im on. I already played on Kronos and the pvp community dissapointed me and more deeper, the problem with the battlegrounds, you can even read the discussion about that in the kronos forum. (Current PvP problem and possible solution - topic) Anyway, its important that you dont miss parts of the gameplay you had on retail back then. And pvp is the most important thing, without it the server will be shit. The amount of population Nostalrius has allows to be anonym, what im saying is that you dont face the same people every battleground like on Kronos. That means there is always some mixed classes / specs in each or every 2 battleground where you have to think of new strategies, because not everyone plays the same way. On kronos its pure shit, people keep quitting and getting dissapointed. You can find that all on the kronos forum."
wowservers,39sxp1,Gaboda,3,Sun Jun 14 14:02:49 2015 UTC,I think what we are seeing on Kronos(pvp for example) is very similar to Dalaran's pvp problem.  You really need a stable 2k+ population at all times to have a viable pvp structure in slow leveling/progression.  Since everyone will be at all ranges of levels playing on that server.  Dalaran is finally starting to crack a population high enough to sustain some pvp versus the x1 leveling.
wowservers,39sxp1,dungeonjay,3,Sun Jun 14 14:15:23 2015 UTC,"Listen to this guy if you think pvp and being on an overpopulated realm are the most important things to you. However, not everybody thinks ""pvp is the most important thing, without it the server will be shit"".  As for the OP, you could spend a week weighing the pros and cons of each server, but tbh, they're both good servers, and the only thing I'd consider is the population. There's good and bad things that come with having 9k players on a vanilla server and if that sounds appealing to you, then go to Nost."

A cash shop with a tier below gear that you can buy.  The pvp is active and the raiding/dungeons is active.  I rate the server the best current TBC server to play on otherwise I'd stick with Dalaran.
wowservers,39ssw5,dungeonjay,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:58:30 2015 UTC,"I'm curious what you mean by ""tested excalibur ... but is not the same"" do you care to expand on this?  In my humble opinion, the perfect balance (polish vs. easymode) of WoW was somewhere between TBC and Wrath. Unfortunately, Wrath was a tad too easy - this is when the no-CC-AOE-everything-speedrun dungeons begun, which (again in my opinion) was the death of the game I loved.  But at the same time I love so many things about wotlk - northrend, the art, dalaran, the dungeons, dungeon finder, achievements, etc.  I always disliked the end-game zones in TBC, all of outland except for to some extent Zang and Nagrand were ugly and boring. However, my all-time-favorite dungeon is Karazhan.  All that being said, the server i'm on right now is TBC"

It wasn't so much that it was no crowd control aoe as it was extremely OP'd healers and tanks handling content that was originally released at the beginning of the expansion.    I think the same could be applied to a healer and tank fully decked out in sunwell gear going and running a heroic ramparts in TBC.  They are going to blister that heroic badly and let the dps have free reign(just no RDF tool is available for speedy dungeon reque'n)"
wowservers,39ssw5,dungeonjay,2,Sun Jun 14 17:21:53 2015 UTC,"true, but in wrath the steamroll occurred in lower dungeons and lower gear levels. In TBC steamrolling usually happens when someone is out of their environment."
wowservers,39ssw5,vitsippa,2,Sun Jun 14 18:20:04 2015 UTC,"I think there were several factors on this involved.  Inscription for enchanting scrolls, boas, changed talent structure.  It wasn't necessarily the content got easier but the ability to defeat the content became that much easier with the available gear selection.  Whatever the case.  I do, however, agree that content as a whole became less challenging from multiple factors near the end of the wrath expansion."

wowservers,39s3xd,Ambassador_Buta,-1,Sun Jun 14 08:15:44 2015 UTC,"I like their way of thinking, focus on one expansion of the game before taking on the next.  But really this is silly if you're looking for 'vanilla', the multitudes of balance patches/hotfixes since from 1.12.1 to 3.3.5a will ensure that you are not having much of a vanilla experience. Unless all that you thought was missing from vanilla were barbers. Just find a vanilla server lol"
wowservers,39s3xd,Ba11in0nABudget,3,Sun Jun 14 06:23:33 2015 UTC,I think the idea is it's a progressive server. It will start in vanilla Content and slowly release content into Wotlk. Considering of course they get the population for it. I think it's a cool idea.
wowservers,39s3xd,trmpah,5,Sun Jun 14 06:34:53 2015 UTC,"Considering how much better balanced the classes were in wrath (when compared with vanilla), buffing the raids to counter the higher dps, hps, hp and better abilities is an interesting way to go imo.  There is already a wide array of well populated blizzlike 1.12 servers out there, so it's refreshing with a different approach."

wowservers,39s3xd,Cover25,-2,Sun Jun 14 14:58:40 2015 UTC,"3.3.5 capped at 60 is too unbalanced. I've played on a server like this before (Kronic WoW) and the pvp aspect at 60 was awful, roll a caster and you win basically. Also for PvE being 3.3.5 the classes were much stronger than 1.12.1 with various skills and items having different stats, whatever the case may be we cleared MC with maybe 15 people? Which is fine, 40 man is kind of ridiculous these days but just an example of how OP some things were, a 40 man raid taken down by 15 people at 60.  No doubt this is a refreshing outlook on servers but at the very least on the pvp side of things it doesn't work. Make a mage or shadow priest and you are a god."

wowservers,39s3xd,Rezenik,1 point,Sun Jun 14 08:31:33 2015 UTC,It all depends on the way they progress.  They are already doing custom gear for lvl60 pvp.  It says that it won't be as good as raid gear but since they are running on a 3.3.5a wrath core then why not add resilence?  Takes care a lot of what you are talking about and balances out the pvp at level 60 within the Wrath structure.
wowservers,39s3xd,dungeonjay,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:17:29 2015 UTC,"Resilience doesn't magically balance PvP at 60, balancing PvP at 60 takes an immense amount of balance changes."
wowservers,39s3xd,IIIIIIIIIIlIl,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:10:55 2015 UTC,I feel the opposite considering I had a twink 60 in retail back on the wrath patch.  True 60 twinks fought a lot in AV back then and it seemed a pretty balanced scenario.  Especially when you would encounter dk twinks thinking they were god and run across a properly geared 60 twink back then and suddenly they were against an even matched foe.  I don't know....we would really have to see how it plays out to really know.

I recommend reading this link: https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/379ngp/kronos_nostalrius_a_battle_for_supremacyor/ - It pretty much gives the low down on all features Kronos offers as well as the controversial ones like the Character Auction (which is not as bad as people make it out to be)  Copied from that link:   A quality bug tracker   https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?latest=fixreports and https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?issues   A personally owned, quality armory. Here's my character sheet to give you an idea.   http://armory.twinstar.cz/character-sheet.xml?r=Kronos&cn=Zipzo    A Boss Kills directory that shows every single up to date boss kill on the realm from any guild, where you can look at stats ranging from DPS, to healing, the loot that dropped, absorbs, overhealing, the avg ilevel of the raider/s. You even get graphs, and kill time. This creates an awesome sense of competition between guilds, because you can compare your kills to other guilds kills, or your DPS to that person of the same class in another guild. This feature deserves a lot of recognition for how amazing it is, and how much competition it can spur. Anybody remember competing for spots on World of Logs? This brings that experience to Vanilla. Go take a look, click ""details"" on any kill to bring up all that aforementioned stuff.   https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?latest=bosskills  Most importantly, it helps officers/raid leaders to manage their raiders in an environment that in its natural form, didn't have many great ways for you to monitor your raiders performance. With this tool, you can do it in-depth as if it were retail.

To elaborate on that, our development staff's ideology is to make completely original content that is fun and enjoyable to play, reasonably challenging to complete and rewards players based that difficulty, conceptually community driven ideas and above all, in some shape, way or form be tied to World of Warcraft's vast lore. We want our custom content to feel new and exciting, but at the same time we don't think deviating entirely  from World of Warcraft's fundamentals as a game would be very enjoyable to the majority of World of Warcraft private server players. People play World of Warcraft because they enjoy the game  and what it's about. Although our server is still young in it's development, we already have a fully functioning, very difficult world boss created that has yet to be defeated. Although it's  not much  yet, our Lead Developer has more than an entire expansion's worth of lore, concepts, bosses, new features and quality of life adjustments to the game planned for implementation.    With this in mind, it is important to note that all content created isn't set in stone. Everything is open to community feedback and will be adjusted based upon popular opinion. World of Immortality is going to be place where there will be something for everyone. Be it the casual player that can only log on maybe once or twice a week or the hard core raider that is willing to spend countless ours crunching away at a difficult raid boss, there will be something for everyone to thoroughly enjoy regardless of how long they stay with our server. We want to succeed where countless other servers have failed and create a truly enjoyable community mixed with the most awesome in-game content ever seen that everyone will want to be a part of."

wowservers,39q2t9,Panda_Estevez,2,Sat Jun 13 18:44:48 2015 UTC,"This is kind of unrelated, but for some reason as I was laying in bed I thought back to a couple years ago when I would play on Wowbeez. I want to say it was post BC, it's been so long it's hard to remember. I played horde side on the high rates server.   I used to have a pretty large guild called Legendary. We had a couple hundred members with our red and white tabards, given a lot of them were alts, it was still a good sized group.  I remember a couple people specifically, but I don't remember their names or their character names, but I do remember the good times we had. Running raids or just hanging out at our little spot right outside of The Barrens dueling.   But over the years one girl stuck with my specifically and it's always bothered me. She was young, older than me though. I was in my early teens and she was in her late. She played a Blood Elf, and everytime she came online she would send me a whisper saying ""hey:)"" and we'd meet up in Org to do whatever. Raid, pvp, or just sit on a roof and talk. I made her the highest rank I could in my guild. We did everything as a group. She told me about her life in Europe, about her plans for school, about random things that happened in her day. She was the closest thing I've ever had to a friend online, she was my friend.   I remember one day she told me she had to have surgery soon and she was scared, but she never said for what. She said she'd be out for awhile, but she'd be back as soon as she was able.   I'd come on everyday and check my friends tab to see if today was the day we played again.   Finally one day, I want to say about a week later, I got an update.  She didn't make it.  She never told us, but she was having an open heart operation and the risk of dying was high, but it was a necessity.   It's weird because I don't play WOW anymore. I haven't for years. But still, sometimes I think about her.  I just wanted to get that out there. I've never told anyone. She, and Wowbeez, gave me memories I haven't forgotten. I'll miss them both."

wowservers,39proe,dungeonjay,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:13:04 2015 UTC,No.  You had to do arena to get gear or donate for gear.  They have merged with Molten(Warmane) and now a full set of wrathful is even more expensive on that server since it is by the piece instead of full sets that AT used to offer.

I was far more into the story of the game back then, but wasn't a huge fan of the raids with the exception of Ulduar and Lich King. Cata was my favorite time for PvP mostly because it was when i really started to get into it and got my first gladiator. For raiding I would have to say WoD. I love Blackrock Foundry, and most of the fights in Highmaul, and from what I have done in the PTR Hellfire Citadel is going to be just as if not better than the other 2 raids. Everything else about warlords sucks ass, but the raids are good.  If i was to choose a best overall it would be wotlk for me. I was able to raid without giving the game my life, and the story was quite immersive and had me wanting to explore and enjoy the content. Still though every expansion had its strengths and weaknesses and I have enjoyed all of them in their own light."

wowservers,39o4l4,trmpah,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:26:27 2015 UTC,"For me it's TBC.  It had the perfect mix of elitism from vanilla (that was beyond my reach) and accessible, rewarding content that kept staying rewarding way into the timeline.  Also, people were still forced out in   the world to farm materials, which made for awesome PvP hotspots like Tyr's Hand in vanilla times.   What also made tbc great in my book was that the community from vanilla carried over - getting revenge on a rogue in Nagrand 1.5 years after he/camped my back for hours in stv and wpl was incredible. Also the reputation people built on both factions lived on, and really came in handy while the heroics were tough.  One thing I disliked about TBC was flying mount. World PvP the first two weeks of Outland was incredible. As more and more people got flying, world PvP outside  the few farming spots at elements died out - I would have loved that flying either had a cooldown, or that Outlands had been designed without flying mounts in mind."

It was nice at the beginning until Blizz caved into the casuals and nerfed heroics etc. The story was absolutely horrible as well with Deathwing.. no one cares about him and you never really saw him or seen his influence like we did with the Lich King. I guess his influence would have been destroying old world but that hatred was more focused towards Blizz as a design flaw. The pvp was downright atrocious in my opinion, but it didn't help that I played rogue and frost mages were unkillable gods... I pretty much ragequit that entire xpac."

After few months in last november or december they suddenly without announcement pulled the plug from it and their WotLK realms. Little did I know they had done this before and kept it very secret.   They started immediately with a new ""Grom Gaming"" (or Grom something) brand with fresh WotLK realm(s?) with donation shops of course.  I was trying to google more about the Grom because I haven't been following them at all since what they did last year. Seems they have erased that brand from the annals of history too.

wowservers,39fdo3,GiqAtlantiss,3,Thu Jun 11 10:20:14 2015 UTC,"If anyone is really interested in learning programming and loves wow, then learning how emus work is a fantastic route into programming, partly because emu development encompasses a plethora of different types of programming and languages.  Its definitely best to learn programming by doing stuff that you enjoy."
wowservers,39fdo3,Iwasapirateonce,4,Thu Jun 11 11:23:27 2015 UTC,I disagree - the programming standards used in the emulation scene are quite poor often. Not a lot of the code is documented. It is a HUGE code base to work with. You are introduced to quite difficult concepts straight away.  Work on a more traditional approach when learning to program and then apply what you have learnt to the emulation scene.
wowservers,39fdo3,stoneharry,3,Thu Jun 11 12:23:58 2015 UTC,"If you dive straight in with no direction or previous experience, then yeah it could certainly be overwhelming.  But if you start small, say changing simple mechanics or experimenting with class/spell scripts (with some guidance), then I think it can be extremely productive.  Heck even spending a few days just reading over the code and figuring how the classes and functions interact can be insightful.  Learning the mechanics of the emu, such as how the database interacts with the core, can give a really good introduction to the field of study.  I agree that documentation and practices are often very poor (although some teams do a good job on this), but then again going in starting small can help rectify some of these issues.  Setting up a server, experimenting with compilation and databases, even if you are not actually committing code, it's a great exercise to see how big projects are structured and set-up.  Then one can go about looking into mechanics piecemeal (Obviously you would want to read up on the languages/syntax/methodology on the side.  It really depends on how Atlantiss devs go about this, if they genuinely want to help get people involved in the coding scene, and are not about getting quick fixes but rather long term coding support, then this could work out well for those involved imo."
wowservers,39fdo3,Iwasapirateonce,2,Thu Jun 11 13:15:35 2015 UTC,"I think you are over simplifying some things. What is a database? What is a class? What is a loop? Why use classes when you can just procedurally write it? These are things that my students struggle with coming into university. It takes a long time to get to grips with the very basics with no prior experience.  I learned programming though messing around with scripts for games, which was a very slow but valuable and entertaining process. I agree it can be done, I just think it is better to learn the traditional directed way. I learnt a ton through university.  edit: How to learn programming is a discussion that has existed for decades and will continue to be debated for decades to come. There is no right answer, I am just giving an alternative view."
wowservers,39fdo3,stoneharry,3,Thu Jun 11 13:55:15 2015 UTC,"I certainly agree with you that there are many ways to learning programming (I was a student myself until recently).  I do know a fair number of people (I partially include myself) who learned a lot once they started experimenting with programming on things they have a strong interest in rather than exclusively progressing through structured teaching.  I think part of the reason for this is when you have a strong interest in a subject, it becomes easy to just sink a ton of time into learning, something that can be hard to do when you don't have a strong level of engagement with a challenge."

Back in 2.4.3 when I did both give database updates and script updates to the Ascent scene? How bout when I gave spline fixes to Chero at Kronos because he couldn't get it working, even though he's ""competition"" simply because I felt like it.  I've done more than my fair share for the 1.12 and 2.4.3 scene in the open. Meanwhile you still have yet to see jackshit from any currently running 1.12.

Most of current developers were once Atlantiss content fixers.The staff earns no money, all donations are used to pay for the running expenses. Atlantiss have been around for over 3 years now. The running costs have been paid by our Head Admin from his very own pocket for all these years. Some might grow tired of that and whilst the server is growing bigger and bigger every day the costs will be even bigger.

All the fixes that you make belong to you, so if you want to make your fixes public you can do that, but not everyone wants to do that.   Till Skyfire existed and ArcCore I myslef kept sending them my fixes, we sent to Skyfire mechanics such as casting while running, overriding spells, two whole zones with scripted quests and NPCs, I think also two 5 man instances from Cata (HoO for sure cause I sent that myself and Skyfire removed my name from the script and made it ""theirs"") so yes we do / did contribute to the public repos out there.  We wont make our core public, because this core is the work of many people and not all of them want their work to be public. If any Dev wants his work to be public he can do that, but he cant do that with code that doesnt belong to him. Also if we released our core we would see 20 new servers that will start using our core claiming that it is theirs and after getting XXX dollars the server will disappear. Do you really want that?

A half of current atlantiss development staff are the original devs who founded the server (and only one of them is doing any actual work on a regular basis, one is playing around with their mop realm which won't be even online for at least one and a half year, and one barely does anything at all)  The other half used to be regular players which wanted to help improving the server they played on so they became CFs and later, devs. But sometimes people just quit. They either burn out, get bored or just don't have the time anymore. They have to replace them somehow, and they offer free training in hope the trainee would later become a dev. Nobody is forcing anyone to do anything. Also keep in mind atlantiss refused even taking money from donations for 3 years.

That's not the problem.  The problem is, if you've ever worked at a server, it's not hard to guess what they spend vs what they're making. I've seen a server with a peak of 350 make over 5k a month, only based on mostly level donations and a few other small things, no gold/items/etc. Their actual cost was around $800. (Server, Webserver, protection). It's extremely hard to believe Atlantiss has no extra funds to hire a real developer or two instead of trying to get free help.  That being said, I could be entirely wrong about Atlantiss, and maybe they have some restrictions on income I don't know about like some servers do, which then I could understand wanting help from their community.  Regardless, I hope the best for Atlantiss. I'd really like to find a decent Cataclysm realm.

I know the ""running cost"" argument, and I also know the money actually made.  That being said, an ""open project"" should then release it's source to the open, since it wants unpaid and free help.

Our current core is a reworked 4.0.6 core which initially took off Skyfire project which died over 2 years ago, what our server is offering is a hard work of people such as the ones we are currently looking for.

Costs are getting larger due to increment of online players, and donations on our server are completely optional, you can not vote at all and have same features which are available for donations. Make sure to get to know our server and its history before writing out false accusations."

wowservers,39ewn1,Paouky,7,Thu Jun 11 17:40:37 2015 UTC,"Why dont you ever review the server's bugs and scripting? I feel like all you do in your reviews is show what everyone can see on the first 5 min. It's not really a review, its a PREVIEW."
wowservers,39ewn1,Paouky,-2,Thu Jun 11 10:51:40 2015 UTC,If I went bug hunting I'd be on the server for years. Imagine trying to test out every spell for every class? It's not possible. I show what needs to be shown and let the players make the decision on the server. 95% of the time the server will have a bug checker and people would leave comments about the server on the video
wowservers,39ewn1,nimeral,7,Thu Jun 11 11:06:29 2015 UTC,"Dodgekebab always points out the bugs, but you don't have to point out EVERY bug. Playing for a few hours will give you an idea. If you see 2 quests bugged in Elwynn Forest, already encountered some guy stuck in a tree and your fireball wasn't shooting correctly, obviously you can state that the server isn't in a good condition. Asking players on the server's forums about the server's stability and bugs is also enough, and it's stuff you NEED to tell in a review.   Anyway, In my opinion, if you don't go a little more in-depth in your reviews, they are not more than previews, and should be titled that way. I doubt adding ""P"" to one of the words in the title would change anything about your viewers and subs, but it would certainly be a more correct term."

The few 'custom' servers like HeroesWoW that offer new playable races and leveling roads prove to be hugely popular and always have been in huge demand. They are just shit.

But the phrase ""it's easier to hate than create"" couldn't be more true when it comes to the format that me and that Turkish meat do.  The reason I started reviewing private servers is because when I started (back in 2011) I saw a gap in the market for moderately produced private server videos! As I've seen friends try and make videos on mainstream games, and I've always seen them fail. As SO many people are now doing it.  Over the years I've definitely adapted my style.

Altought the population atm isn't what it used to be, it's still way better than most other servers with decent scripting. In regards to content, if I recall correctly most every quest (like 95+ or more) works, every instance and raid is scripted from vanila to wotlk, ruby sanctum and icc25 hc are fully scripted (again if i recall correctly). There are always guilds looking for players to join them in raiding and there are always people doing pugs. Not to mention the reset system they implement: you can reset your save on every raid / instace at the price of vote points. Can't say much about the PvP 'coz Im not a PvP player tho everytime I wanted to join a bg or go for a match of WG there were always players.

wowservers,39f1vn,dungeonjay,5,Thu Jun 11 13:16:47 2015 UTC,"Gamer-District has a couple guilds that do some progression....usually raiding ToC to ICC.  All their raids are scripted decently, but Dalaran has better raid to raid scripts.  Both are equal in terms of guilds that raid and finding a group on there.    Dalaran is a true progression realm.  You have to clear Naxx before Ulduar, etc.  It is a very interesting server and with RaF you can get x3 experience.    Gamer-District imo actually has a lower population because Dalaran has a strong NA following as well and late night into EU you will still find around 700-1000 people on where GD will fall off the map below 250 people.    That being said, Gamer-District has more pvp-oriented people and you will find more arenas and battlegrounds happening during EU prime then you will on Dalaran at the same time.  So, it really is a toss-up.  I suggest since GD is x7 you and your friends can play on both really.  It isn't that hard to raid on GD and still raid on Dalaran and both will give totally different experiences."
wowservers,39f1vn,mixd3,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:22:21 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, haven't played Dalaran in a while. What makes Dalaran's raid scripts better than GD's? Do you have some specific examples?"
wowservers,39f1vn,dungeonjay,5,Thu Jun 11 13:47:33 2015 UTC,"Sure.  It mainly comes down to blizzlike encounters with the bosses.  Gamer-District still has some glitches and hiccups on Ulduar.  I can't compare ICC or ToC because Dalaran is just releasing ToC.  All I can judge is Naxx and Ulduar scripts and when you compare them to retail Dalaran's are 95% there where GD is around 85% there.  The verdict is still out on whether Dalaran will have better raid scripts on ToC and ICC.    Should be noted  -  That isn't saying that Gamer-District isn't a great server in the same regards.  I think they have class mechanics, questlines and pathing better scripted than Dalaran.  Even the regular dungeons are better scripted.  At least from what I've seen.  Actually, if I was to rate overall server scripting quality from top to bottom then Gamer-District is better.        Raids:  Dalaran 9/10, Gamer District 8/10 Other content:  Dalaran 7/10, Gamer District 8/10"

wowservers,39ex3i,IIIIIIIIIIlIl,2,Thu Jun 11 07:09:26 2015 UTC,Warmane is incredibly pvp oriented and it is x7 rate to leveling is fast and x7 honor .
wowservers,39ex3i,Silez,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:46:30 2015 UTC,"7x honor, how so? It's 1x if you ask me..."
wowservers,39ex3i,dungeonjay,2,Fri Jun 12 13:15:51 2015 UTC,I like Mortal Cata.  Instant 85.  Decent server.  Other than that everything else is definately cash shop P2W.
wowservers,39ex3i,Altair1776,2,Thu Jun 11 12:59:03 2015 UTC,"Warmane and Mortal are the two choices. Warmane has an instant 85 server (Warsong) but its population isn't nearly as high as their x7 server (Neltharion).  Both Warmane and Mortal allow you to buy gear. Both have bugs, but Mortal seems buggier than Warmane ever since AT merged with Warmane- class abilities on Warmane seem pretty good since then.  I play on both but prefer Warmane- it has a much bigger population and the pvp aspect isn't that buggy (compared to questing)."
wowservers,39ex3i,Argothman,2,Thu Jun 11 15:37:39 2015 UTC,"Is the PVP population on Neltharion better than on Warsong? I find that Warsong always dies in the evening (US east), and is pretty small even at better times."
wowservers,39ex3i,Altair1776,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:00:19 2015 UTC,"Neltharion has a much higher population. Not sure how you'd quantify the pvp population, though. I am a pvp'er and much prefer Neltharion- just feels like a regular, active Blizzard server, population-wise."
wowservers,39ex3i,Argothman,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:14:45 2015 UTC,"Can you get BGs in the evening? Also, are BGs relatively balanced across factions?  I'm considering leveling a warlock on the server if it's good."
wowservers,39ex3i,Silez,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:52:44 2015 UTC,"Yes you can queue during the evening. However, there an imbalance because more alliance queue for BGs. Alliance almost always win AV because alliance always starts with a full team of 40, while horde starts the game with only 10 players.  If you want instant BG queues I recommend making a horde."
wowservers,39ex3i,Bestesbulzibar,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:22:26 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure that Atlantiss is in the eu but it is a 1x server. But its not pay to win.
wowservers,39be0l,Aywaar,3,Wed Jun 10 16:47:16 2015 UTC,"Hey.  Unfortunately my friend if you go upwards in expansions on private servers the more buggy it becomes.  There isn't a MoP expansion(Lvl90) that has functioning dungeons for lower level content and working raids correctly ""or"" quests at least in a complete sense.  It is just a bunch of crap.  The closest you can come past Wrath is the next expansion and there is only 1 server that has a lot scripted and that would be Atlantiss.  It isn't instant lvl85 or even increased xp.  It is a x1 server but it does have RaF and if you team up with someone that way it will enable you to experience at x3 rate."
wowservers,39be0l,dungeonjay,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:43:42 2015 UTC,"Bah, I was afraid of that.   Maybe in a couple of more years there wll be a ""full rip"" kind of version of the game  Thank you for the fast reply."
wowservers,39be0l,dungeonjay,3,Wed Jun 10 17:51:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  The way it works is they have to manually rewrite the code.  So, there will never be a ""full catch up"" perfect server.  They are playing catch up the whole time.  In a couple years you may find yourself with a decently scripted functioning MoP server.  We just now are seeing the development of Cataclysm really.    Note Added It isn't even on the same core that Blizzard uses so that is a ton of rewriting"
wowservers,39be0l,Blujay12,2,Wed Jun 10 17:53:50 2015 UTC,"I'll level with you on atlantiss if you wish, just PM me whenever"
wowservers,39be0l,notbad112,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:33:01 2015 UTC,"Well here's my 2 cents. Play on retail, if you purchase the full game, with WoD you get an instant level 90 character, you don't even have to play till 100 if you only feel like soloing old content, and if you solo old raids/dungs you can easily make 40k (eu) or 20k (us) gold to purchase gametime, as far as i remember soloing every raid till mop (dragon soul and firelands incl) you can make anywhere from 10 to 20k."
wowservers,39cxv6,calinoi,5,Wed Jun 10 22:43:58 2015 UTC,"Now....if you want a progessive server with great scripted raids....decent pvp(Raid intensive server but pvp is picking up) and a nice working dungeon/raid from previous expansions(Vanilla, TBC) then I suggest Dalaran.  It runs on a 3.3.5a version of Wrath."

wowservers,39cxv6,dungeonjay,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:56:23 2015 UTC,Yeah.  Most definately.  It has a stronger EU population and peaks around 1.5-17k.  You can also use RaF tool with a friend if you want to increase the x1 to x3 as you level.

wowservers,397ljt,bellasahbella,3,Tue Jun 9 20:54:07 2015 UTC,"It is improving.  Sometimes Wintergrasp takes precedence over the 80s bgs because the pvp community is smaller than the pve one that exists.  Every 80 that dings that is into pvp is making that a stronger community on Dalaran.  If you are a pvper....actually I think you are needed more to help flesh out the community more than a raider.  I feel, as a whole, that the scene is slowly churning to something better.  The last six months have been pivotal as the population has acquired a surge of new characters and not everyone wants to raid all day."
wowservers,397ljt,dungeonjay,2,Tue Jun 9 21:13:56 2015 UTC,how many people are online/around usually? I used to PVP in molten wow which was quite big at the time
wowservers,397ljt,pikunul,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:43:08 2015 UTC,"The peak population is anywhere from 1.5-1.7 now I believe, with the lowest around 400 (Late NA times).   If you're migrating from Warmane (ex molten), you'll notice a pretty big difference in bg queue times/arena activity. I would recommend starting anyway as the population is increasing at a pretty rapid rate which means PvP activity should also pick up."
wowservers,397ljt,pikunul,2,Tue Jun 9 22:03:04 2015 UTC,"thanks for your replies, I wouldn't go back to warmane anyway because I want to PVP but feel the 1x experience at the same time, plus the server is progressive which means I can also try different sets instead of going top item level right away.."

wowservers,3988o3,Charos77,-1,Wed Jun 10 00:22:54 2015 UTC,I am 99.99% sure it is not allowed. Trading is a form of selling. You're  selling your account for a different one.
wowservers,3988o3,pikunul,2,Wed Jun 10 00:39:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know about others but I see trading like me having an apple and you having and orange and we swap, and selling as I have 2 apples and you give me 50 cents for one. The use of money being the factor that changes something from a trade to a sale. Of course its up to the mods to make the distinction or not, or to decide whether the distinction is even relevant."
wowservers,3988o3,Charos77,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:45:53 2015 UTC,"I'm sure one of the reasons selling is not allowed is because they don't want this sub to turn into a mini ownedcore.

wowservers,396m7t,anderu,5,Tue Jun 9 17:05:07 2015 UTC,Meh....increased xp rate is awesome for people that don't want to relevel or don't have time to relvl.  GD has great scripts bar none.  I recommend it a lot over Warmane for pvp.  It doesn't have a NA population or fit a lot of what people are looking for when asking questions on here.  The donation shop does put off some people since it is basically on par with Warmane.  Probably why the population has never increased and really taken away from Warmane's population or had more people try it out.
wowservers,396m7t,dungeonjay,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:27:23 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, I personally never thought donation shops were that big of a deal since you can get the gear through the game regardless, but I can see people not wanting others to be ahead just because they had money to spare, and the point about Warmane and donation shop being on par which can deter their players was something I never thought about before."
wowservers,396m7t,dungeonjay,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:36:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah...the players on Warmane that might be interested in an exact copy might look toward GD more if it didn't have the same cash shop setup.  You know, a GD with a Dalaran cash shop.  Cept since it is x7 might as well make the donation epic flying with level 80 and some coins and a full set of BoA to augment gearing.  (Just to be competitive to what it would offer if you donated like Dalaran in timeframe/scale).  That way I believe he(the owner of GD) would still get reimbursement on running the server and maybe finally see GD pop tip back over 2k like it was a couple years back."
wowservers,396m7t,coolfangs,2,Tue Jun 9 17:50:27 2015 UTC,It comes down to the increased xp rate and the availability of P2W gear.

wowservers,396m7t,mixd3,0,Tue Jun 9 18:07:46 2015 UTC,Does that really make sense with instances like ToC5/FoS/PoS/HoR? Where you immediately get gear which is good enough to enter ICC?
wowservers,396m7t,Craptola,2,Tue Jun 9 18:11:29 2015 UTC,But the five mans are also gated based on your raid progress. IE you can't enter ToC until you've completed ulduar.
wowservers,396m7t,mixd3,0,Tue Jun 9 18:49:15 2015 UTC,Isn't that silly? You progress from a 10/25 raid to a 5 man gear-up which has worse gear?
wowservers,396m7t,Craptola,3,Tue Jun 9 19:00:29 2015 UTC,If anything it reduces farm time as you only have to complete the raids once to unlock the 5 mans. It may not be ideal but it's definitely better than having all raids bar ICC obsolete.

I started the guild 7 months ago in anticipation of the ""2014"" release and we've grown pretty large and have been playing various projects in the mean time. I think a very well scripted, populated, brand new TBC server is extremely appealing. BC is my fav and I'd love to start from the beginning when Kara is actually current progression. All these other BC servers are old and poorly scripted in comparison. So we will continue to be patient rather than play BC elsewhere."
wowservers,395mk2,periphery3,2,Tue Jun 9 16:33:35 2015 UTC,Vengeancewow is about to release Kara if you are bringing a guild for clearing.  They have a small playerbase but from leveling to 40 and doing a few of the dungeons it is spot on.  Might want to check it out.
wowservers,395mk2,periphery3,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:41:43 2015 UTC,Problem is leveling from 1-70 1x rates. I am done with that. Got to 37 on vengeances vanilla server and 42 on nostalrius and just burned out. Corecraft accelerated/instant 58 makes it appealing as well for those who have leveled enough 1x over the years.

I'd say while some fun can be had on MoP servers in PvP, the PvE side of the game is nothing to write home about yet.  As a non-russian speaking PvE player you could take a look at Pandashan (6/9 heroics, 4 raids available). Warmane has 5/9 dungeons and 3 raids (MV, ToeS, half of ToT). Freakz has all 9 heroics, but no raid is completely scripted yet and there are still a lot of other bugs (but their MoP realm is only 1.5 months old). WoW Circle might be something if you can speak russian, but when I last checked, there were only 22 other people in the english chat channel on a server with thousands of russians... there's just nobody you can talk to."

wowservers,393amu,Vpos,0,Wed Jun 10 16:11:52 2015 UTC,I don't care about population that sit in city and do nothing. I am talking about scripts and about people that are coming last few months and both are AWESOME. I see BG's on all levels and on 80 they pop like crazy now even with 330 people online. I am talking about at least 20 BG's for 80 level and there were live 5. This topic was Dalaran-WoW is growing so don't know what the hell are you talking about or what are you trying to tell.
wowservers,393amu,pikunul,2,Tue Jun 9 11:52:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not advertising another server or anything of the sort. I actually really enjoy playing on Dalaran, I was just commenting on something you stated that was blatantly wrong.  Even people who play Dalaran-WoW know it's not the best option for PvP, but that can change with population. People won't leave the server over this discussion. You can rest easy, pal."
wowservers,393amu,dungeonjay,2,Tue Jun 9 13:41:51 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with pikunul.  The pvp scene is growing and more players will increase the activity.  The more people that leave Warmane , get bored of Nost or retail and discover this gem of a progression server the more opportunity for the pvp side to pickup as well.  Population is on the rise.  So fingers crossed."

wowservers,393amu,Cover25,2,Tue Jun 9 16:03:38 2015 UTC,two bugs i ran into were vergog the dervish not spawning and the murgle boss in WC just stuck in the water...kinda sad but hopefully they will get to it. oh and sometimes you get glitched underground and there is the combat bug.
wowservers,393amu,ACNL,2,Mon Jun 8 23:47:01 2015 UTC,"He spawns but it just takes him some time to. I think his respawn timer is off.  The WC boss was a little off scripting last I checked, but nothing was off too much.   I've never been glitched underground, so I can't offer any input in that..  For the combat bug, I've noticed if you either give it some time it goes away on it's own, or if you kill a different mob (doesn't need to be associated with the mob(s) when out of aggro radius of the original mob it seems to fix it for my priest.)  Max recorded peak is 1780. I can EASLY see this server peaking 2k by the end of the month without any sort of difficulty"
wowservers,393amu,Cover25,2,Tue Jun 9 00:53:51 2015 UTC,"im all for dalaran but to so easily dismiss the combat bug (you have to relog most of the time) is ridiculous. WC boss is still fked up like OP said. he just stands in the water. if you are a warrior and you charge a mob on a hill, you do sometimes go underground. verog should spawn right away after u kill the mobs around the area. he doesnt. these bugs are not opinions. they are facts. im only lvl 25 and im sure there are more. still, nothing game breaking and the community is good and the devs do try."

wowservers,394ybz,Zaranazer,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:08:34 2015 UTC,"Exactly, everyone has their issues. If you lagg on Kronos and Nos is more stable for you then great. Though  that is the first I have heard of it being a problem for people.  Whilst I did not lag on Nos to begin with, I do so now. I only leveled a toon on Nos for the pre-nerf AV and PvP...end dungeons and quests weren't that enjoyable to do because of one reason or another, so I just stuck with PvP...now PvP is not fun to play due to the lag so I have put all my concentration into Kronos.  If it is the other way around for you then there is no problem with that. Thats the great thing about having the choice of two quality servers, if one doesn't work out, there is another available."
wowservers,394ybz,Struckd,-2,Thu Jun 11 07:36:29 2015 UTC,"Not sure if any of them have the D2 chain/ZG out currently, but if none of them do, I would assume Nostalrius would have them released sooner as the server launched 1 month before Kronos."
wowservers,394ybz,pikunul,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:33:01 2015 UTC,"Not true, Nostril will have them like 6-7months later if even at all. Look at there timelime, Nos said they will release BWL 1.5months ago and still havent even started develop it."
wowservers,394ybz,alexhjelm,3,Tue Jun 9 08:39:27 2015 UTC,"Whilst we already have a solid, confirmed release frame from Kronos on the release of AV and BWL...nothing from Nos yet apart from DM.

wowservers,394ybz,Struckd,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:14:08 2015 UTC,"Kronos told us they will release their server in september 2014, then in december 2014 to finally release it in march 2015 because of Nostalrius release.  They proved in the past that they can't respect the timeline they give, what make you think they will respect it this time?"
wowservers,394ybz,wowserver,2,Wed Jun 10 05:17:56 2015 UTC,"Because this time there is another factor involved and that is Nos. They respected their final release date. The community has tested BWL in the beta test. We knew it was almost ready to release it was just a matter of when.   They have been pretty spot on with their bug fixes, server updates and staying in touch with the community. If anything delaying the release is now a fade in the past and they have more then made up for it."
wowservers,394ybz,Struckd,-1,Wed Jun 10 07:20:47 2015 UTC,"We did get a release timelime from Nostril but they lied to me and the other players there!  Here are some lies, Dire Maul will open 1 month after Molten Core & Onyxia Lair content is cleared. Regarding raids, Black Wing Lair will be available 2 months after Molten Core & Onyxia Lair content is cleared."
wowservers,394ybz,alexhjelm,4,Tue Jun 9 11:48:20 2015 UTC,"I never said we didn't get a release timeline. I said they have started on the development of BWL.  I think the whole vanilla community knows that Nos was not ready for their release, that was evident of large amount of bugs in the starting zones and the late release of content that is nowhere close to their original timeline. However, it was also not precedent that they would have an insane amount of people to deal with, so many in fact that it has taken all their attention away to actually developing the server."
wowservers,394ybz,Struckd,2,Tue Jun 9 12:35:19 2015 UTC,"Indeed. It sounds like people actually think they did it on purpose, give people a timeline then don't stick to it just to fuck with people. Are people actually this daft? It's hard to believe.  Plenty of developers delay their games because x and y. There is always something unforseen coming up, especially if your server gets x 5 bigger than you thought."
wowservers,394ybz,Zaranazer,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:19:45 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say they did it on purpose...but I would say they were very lax on their release expectations to entice people into their server. That is the nature of private wowservers and business's.  In essence the release expectations they announced have not been met and that is frustrating to players. What is even more lazy is that the dev team have not addressed those concerns. Most of the players frustrations would have dissipated if they just regard their error and explained the possibilities of the future...which they haven't...and that has kept the players expectations in limbo and has allowed for criticism.
wowservers,394ybz,Struckd,-1,Tue Jun 9 14:14:04 2015 UTC,The population management proved to be a much larger problem then they thought.  However they were able to create an entirely new system of handling that large of a group of players.  This is the reason that people continue to flock to Nost.  The devs have proved they are more than capable of developing their server beyond that of just implementing new content.  They have proved that they can improve on network issues as well.
wowservers,394ybz,KnaxxLive,3,Tue Jun 9 15:40:20 2015 UTC,It dont handle the people at all.... ITS LAGGING!

wowservers,39492b,Silez,2,Tue Jun 9 03:43:46 2015 UTC,NA timezone with population on a Cata server?  Not happening my friend.  Especially one as well crafted or put together like you are looking for.  You have a choice....either try to help build atlantiss NA population which would be nice or switch to Warmane and power level to 85 to run half-ass dungeons for pve because they still have a decent population at that time.  (Raids are getting scripted and are coming around on there though and you can definately pvp.  Other than that I don't have much more I can say about Warmane's Cata atm)
wowservers,39492b,dungeonjay,2,Tue Jun 9 15:18:58 2015 UTC,Unfortunately there are no good Cata servers with a high population. Take Atlantiss and sacrifice a large population. Take Warmane and sacrifice good scripting.

I live in the US, and I find the population on Atlantiss to be enough to do RDF from time to time on off peak. And I play as a tank healer and DPS at once. I usually don't wait longer than half hour."

wowservers,392nx0,svn,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:41:47 2015 UTC,This actually seems possible since the population on Neltharion can drop to as low as 1000 players online for their off-peak (~500 per faction). That's not too far off.
wowservers,392nx0,Silez,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:50:42 2015 UTC,What about Horde?
wowservers,392nx0,coolfangs,0,Tue Jun 9 14:14:34 2015 UTC,"Ratio is around 55%/45% Horde to Alliance on Dalaran. Horde has peak numbers of 800-900.  Alliance has peak numbers of around 100 less than that.  So, lowball it.  800+700 is 1500 at peak.  It is getting more active on pvp as more people make that choice to get away from cash shops for gear servers.  I'd say it has had about a 30% increase in the last two months.    Molten numbers have to be shaved.  Like right now is peak for both and Dalaran is sitting around 1600 and Warmane wrath server says 3420.  Considerable difference but they add around 1k players to their total.  Kaer has said as much.  So....2420.  That is around 800 more people.  The gap is closing in......Dalaran pop is increasing while Molten population is going down."

From the multiple census videos and what not is how i based those numbers.   It is the only halfway substantial proof of the matter.  As far as population of Dalaran I was right on the money at the time I talked about peak and this post earlier today.  It has risen and they even had over 900 horde on the weekends during peak twice now.  You log over to alliance and they had 725 that same day at that same time.  900 + 725 =  1625..... of course that was the weekend and we are just now seeing those surge in numbers of almost 200+ from where it was a couple weeks ago.

I'd like one too, but that's how it is.  The server owners have all decided that PVP is the way to go, it's their coin and you and I are out of luck.  Honestly, I think the only real solution if you're serious is to form a local population of english speaking people yourself.

wowservers,38yy13,Ambassador_Buta,-1,Mon Jun 8 03:33:35 2015 UTC,I'm taking into account how everything outside of the heroic raids was a fucking cakewalk.
wowservers,38yy13,aneq,2,Mon Jun 8 03:47:40 2015 UTC,"Okay, but what else is to the game? Theres pvp - its difficulty relies mostly on your opponents. And theres the non-endgame content, which was never that difficult in the first place. It took much more dedication to level up your character, but it was mostly due to levelling being incredibly time consuming, not necessarily being difficult. Cata took much of the grind out of the game. It didnt make the game easier, just less time-consuming."
wowservers,38yy13,anarchism4thewin,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:58:38 2015 UTC,"Cata took much of the grind out of the game. It didnt make the game easier, just less time-consuming.   Jesus not this crap again. Open world Mobs were dramatically less powerful in Cata compared to earlier incernations of the game. That means easier. It's not a difficult concept to understand."
wowservers,38yy13,Ambassador_Buta,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:31:31 2015 UTC,"Except in cata they handed out Ruthless sets like fucking candy, so pretty much the only difficulty you got out of PvP was if your class was shit that patch or not. Since I played feral druid at the time I just completely stomped everything except mages & healers.  There wasn't really any reason to leave your capital city anyway except for actual difficulty raids after max because you could just queue LFR (fucking joke), LFD (all heroics were pretty much a fucking joke except for ZG because nobody cared to open the Dungeon Journal to take a look at the mechanics), and battlegrounds with the click of a button.   And getting to level 85 took absolutely no time at all with all the heirlooms they had in the game at the time along with the easiness of the quests. Especially with battlegrounds giving you fuckloads of EXP too, the neutered version of Alterac Valley they had at that time basically was free level-ups when you could start queuing it. Where you got the idea that it took any dedication to get to 85 at that time is baffling.  Literally the only difficulty in that entire expac was the actual-difficulty raids.   Now why you wanted someone else to reiterate why Cataclysm was such a casual ezmode expansion that was pretty much universally shat on, I don't understand. I'm back to Vanilla and enjoying it."
wowservers,38yy13,aneq,0,Mon Jun 8 04:20:18 2015 UTC,"I must've worded it poorly, sorry. Obviously i meant that it took more dedication before cata to get your char to max level.   The points you made were mostly valid of course, but how does being in capital 24/7 translate to game being less challenging (or taking less 'skill'). In pvp difficulty varies based on class and opponents, but surely cata wasnt the first and only xpac with imbalanced pvp.  As for the ruthless sets, it was always like this since they introduced arena seasons. The gear from previous season was available for honor.  I understand why you're unhappy with cata, but there is a difference between something that is difficult and something that is time consuming. Cata had many faulta but I dont think lack of difficulty was one of them (but again I don't even consider gearing up and levelling to be in the 'difficulty' category, to me its just grinding before the real game starts)  Enjoy your vanilla grindfest"
wowservers,38yy13,Ambassador_Buta,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:47:02 2015 UTC,"The points you made were mostly valid of course, but how does being in capital 24/7 translate to game being less challenging (or taking less 'skill').   Because there was no reason to interact with any other players in an 'MMO'. There was no sense of adventure if there was literally no point in getting off your flying mount, or even to leave your capital city. You could go anywhere important with the click of a button, LFD/LFR/BG queue. Being in capital 24/7 doesn't necessarily relate to challenge, it relates to what type of audience Blizzard was aiming for when they designed this expansion.   As for the ruthless sets, it was always like this since they introduced arena seasons. The gear from previous season was available for honor.   Cataclysmic wasn't hard at all to get either. I think there was some weekly cap or some bullshit to how much Conquest points you could get which was the only reason why 100% of PvPers werent in full Cataclysmic in one night of doing arenas.   I understand why you're unhappy with cata, but there is a difference between something that is difficult and something that is time consuming.   Vanilla was time consuming and difficult. I don't know where you're going with this. Cataclysm was time consuming only because of weekly caps on Valor/Conquest. It was not difficult.   Cata had many faulta but I dont think lack of difficulty was one of them (but again I don't even consider gearing up and levelling to be in the 'difficulty' category, to me its just grinding before the real game starts)   If you're judging difficulty of an expansion to be its hardest-difficulty raids, then WoW is really fucking hard. Sadly, that's doesn't make sense. It became a casualland themepark across the entire board and Cata is where it started to happen the most.  Cataclysm does have its good points though, with some pretty cool boss mechanics and fun dungeons. That's pretty much it. The patch it released with though was fucking great, because dungeons were damn near impossible till the casuals cried. That fun didn't really last too long.   Enjoy your vanilla grindfest   Gladly. Hopefully Cataclysm emulators will be up to par with that of Vanilla cores of today (in terms of bugginess, quality of scripting, stability) within the next ten years."

However, I was in a nice guild in retail at that time and it was active and tight.  World pvp was intense in Cata leveling zones if you were on a populated server.  However, again....community was about dead by this time.  No sense of who was who.  I, however, did travel out of the capital cities a lot in Cata as I just stated world pvp was intense on a populated pvp server in those hotspots.  It did open the doors to my most favorite pass the time on wow enjoyment and that was trashing lvl70 raids solo.....that I can say without a doubt was the best part of Cata."

So once you are beyond 5 levels of the current mobs you are fighting go to a large patch of them and start farming away.  You do this every 5-10 levels until you reach around 35....at 35 if you are dead-set on getting some gear you are now high enough level to farm either stockades(alliance), chasm(horde), shadowfang keep, deadmines.  Not to mention that your first aid probably sucks or some other profession is lacking...this is catch up time.  You get some lvl20ish gear and that with leveling and talents sustain you until you hit lvl 58.  At lvl 58 do the initial quests around hellfire to get lvl60ish gear.  Once geared proceed....at lvl68 do northrend beginning quests to get gear.  Etc."

I'm Canadian and was looking for a vanilla server to start playing on. I debated between Nos and Kronos for quite some time but eventually decided to go with Kronos. I can tell you that so far I have not been disappointed. I've only been playing on the server for about 2-3 weeks or so and reached the 30's so I can't talk about the higher end stuff. But here are a few helpful observations I can share:   So far Kronos seems to be extremely well scripted (I did play on a TBC private server years ago and it was horribly bugged). Haven't ran into any bugged quests (yet) Population is nowhere near as high as Nos, which is great since you can easily quest without fighting over mods/drops. (Krono's pop is increasing but is still well within a very comfortable number) Kronos tries to be as close to Blizz-like as it gets, so no bonuses to xp or gold etc.. Finding a group has not been difficult though that will usually vary depending on roles. As you're a group of 4 then it shouldn't be an issue at all Kronos has zero p2w (which was a major seller for me) Hasn't been a ton of trolls from what I've seen. Trade chat is generally quiet, most of the banter seems to happen in the /world channel Players are mostly friendly and willing to group if you do end up finding yourself after the same mobs Ping has been pretty good for the most part, and very little downtime. The devs spend a lot of time keeping a quality server Regarding your friend with the mouth, if he is coaxed into a war of words I don't think there's much to worry about. But if he was to go into world chat and start spewing nasty things then that would be the only thing I'd worry about.   I play horde side so if you all do decide to head to Kronos then I'd be happy to help any way I can"

Generally everything you can get for donations is also availabe for voting points and hence free.  The Population is fairly low, but compensates by being extremely friendly and helpful and since you're not that interested in lategame it might not be a problem that raiding is kinda stuck lately.  There are little to no downtimes and the leveling experience as your main interest is really good there. At least I really enjoyed it.

Aside from that, the content of our shops were decided by the community due to the lack of population, most (if not all) rare materials are still to be farmed the usual way. As well as the rarest Vanilla mounts."
wowservers,38wdwi,AscDude,4,Sun Jun 7 13:38:21 2015 UTC,"I can totally understand your concerns especially when it comes to things like Essences from the shop. On the other hand it costs about 6 days of voting to purchase any high level materials. The only mounts sold there are the old epic mounts for 50 days worth of voting, which is a great way to make them obtainable. Because that's classic experience. Don't let that be a reason to stay away, it's hardly affecting gameplay at all."
wowservers,38wdwi,geologygoldfish,3,Sun Jun 7 15:01:55 2015 UTC,"Spoken like someone who's never logged into Ascension.  The vote and donation shops are exactly the same.

Maybe vote shops ruin the experience for you, but there is always the option to not use them at all.  Cheers."
wowservers,38wdwi,dungeonjay,2,Sun Jun 7 16:36:46 2015 UTC,"That argument is invalid, as geologygoldfish has pointed out already, you obviously haven't played on the server. This means you're judging a book by its cover. To clear things up: all players, not 'some', can get the same items in the donation shop from the vote shop. The only difference is the ratio of the virtual currency, which is 1:4, meaning the vote shop prices are x4 higher as that of the donation shop. Conclusion, players do not have to donate to get the same items. The vanilla experience is still very much present, but then again, each individual experiences a game differently. I'd still welcome you with open arms to try out the server."
wowservers,38wdwi,jetsfan07,2,Sun Jun 7 17:22:12 2015 UTC,"If ruining the experience of vanilla content is a vote shop or donation shop that doesn't sell gear then play on the servers that don't but don't bring up the point on here that it ruins your experience?  They aren't changing it.  They, unlike other servers, may want to have help continuing the server going and feel that players that donate or vote should be rewarded with something.

What you have is an oversaturated marketplace and when that happens it will be hard to break away and really make decent coins.  If you are only lvl19, just worry about leveling and experiencing the game for the first time and keep in mind that the server you are playing on is very overpopulated which may dilute the experience of what you are involved in."
wowservers,38uowq,dungeonjay,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:30:00 2015 UTC,"I myself didnt farm gold intentionally but i know from others and how famous somse things were. People would farm the Orb that transforms you into the opposite faction at the Dire Maul arena which has the highest drop chance from one of the 3 random bosses. Also Silithus texts were hot in there i remember and well lots of BoE blues and epics on AH also Runecloth went well i think the most common price was 1g 30s for 1 stack. Some were farming the engineer thing i forgot its name, its required to make a rep-bot and it takes time to get i dont know more because i sadly was so much into the game i really didnt care about golds :D"
wowservers,38uowq,Gaboda,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:58:35 2015 UTC,Just playing the game well earn you gold. Skinning/Herbalism/Mining can help but it just slows your leveling down so i recommend doing it after you are 40-60 because mounts help. There is no need to worry about gold at your level my only advice is to try not to buy anything from the auction house while leveling try to be self sufficient. That's the biggest mistake people make is buying gear while leveling. It just doesn't make sense you will replace it soonish anyway. You start getting decent vendor-able items mid 30s. You will probably have enough gold for your mount mid 40s maybe earlier if you save well. The only guide I can recommend is the vanillaguide addon (https://code.google.com/p/vanillaguide/downloads/detail?name=VanillaGuide.1.04.2.zip) if you follow that it is the move efficient for leveling. So ya if you really are into trying to make some money as a lower level I think atleast skinning is your best bet. Not sure about the most in demand items but devilsaur leather is up there.
wowservers,38uowq,kemdog,1 point,Sun Jun 7 08:54:34 2015 UTC,A minor but often overlooked point I will add is always efficiently manage your bag space.  Going from 1-60 in vanilla you can make a lot of gold by vendoring trash items and junk.  Make sure you are not regularly destroying large quantities of these items due to lacking bag space.
wowservers,38uowq,Iwasapirateonce,1 point,Sun Jun 7 11:20:34 2015 UTC,"I can give you some ideas about how I start on a new sever:   Create a second character for trading right away. You don't have to level it, just walk to the next town with an auction house and park it there (sell items in bag and throw away the hearthstone to make room in inventory). Send all goods that potentially sell in the auction house from your main to this trade character through the postal system. You save a lot of time, it's easy to keep your inventory clean and you can sell tons of items you find on your daily adventures. Invest your money in bag space. The first (and only) thing you want to spend money early, is bags. First buy some cheap 6 or 8 slot bags in the auction house - later upgrade to 14 slot bags (usually good bang for the buck). The more space you have in your inventory, the more valuable items you can collect while leveling (and sell them at the auction house). Don't buy expensive equipment early on. You level so quickly, that it's a waste of money. Save your money for bags - and for a mount when you reach lvl 40. (more inventory space + increased movement speed = more stuff you can do/collect per hour = more stuff to sell). As soon as you reach level 5, choose two gathering professions to make quick money. (You might have to walk to the next city to learn them, but it's worth doing this excursion early). I usually go for skinning plus mining or herbalism. Both, mining and herbalism work with indicators (dots) on the minimap to show you where recourses are located near you - it's not possible to activate this for both, (mining and herbalism) simultaneously. So you either have to switch between these two gathering professions manually, or choose one of them and go with skinning as a second profession. Later in the game (lvl 60) you can switch to more useful professions for your class. Right at the beginning, gathering professions a great way to make money at the action house.   The above tips are obviously no rocket science or secret farming strategy. But I wish I had this advise 10 years ago. I'm currently leveling a new character on a German private server with low population. I'm at lvl 29, I have roughly 50 gold in my pocket and a full set of 14 slot bags. No active farming or grinding - just normal leveling, gathering resources on the way, sending (almost) everything to my trade character and selling it on the auction house.*  (*) I'm using some add-ons to help me with my gathering and trading: Auctioneer, Gatherer, Informant, Enhanced tooltip, ctmailmod (mailing multiple items to your trade char)  Best of luck and have fun!"
wowservers,38uowq,Smoking_Blue,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:03:16 2015 UTC,"Herbs at max lvl in vanilla sell for a lot on Nostalrius right now.   Mountain Silversage, Dreamfoil, Black Lotus and Icecaps sell for very much cause the need for them to create flasks in raids.   Elemental Fire sells for a lot right now cause of Greater Fire Protection Potion.   But as others already have said, focus on leveling first and see if you want to play on the server on max level and if you can stand the population."
wowservers,38uowq,biffsteken,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:31:54 2015 UTC,"1, 2, 3, 5: Gold shouldn't be your focus while leveling. As others have said, don't buy gear from the AH at low levels. Your focus should be on questing/dungeoning and getting XP. You'll get your own reasonable gear from doing these things.   Make a lvl 1 bank alt and run it to stormwind/ironforge. send it a little gold to buy some small bags. Then mail that character every single green or blue item you pick up. Also send it all the tradeskill mats that you're not going to use. Including cloth, raw meats. Everything that isn't grey. Google ""wow 1.12.1 auctioneer"" download and install the addon. Scan the auction house daily to build up a database of price averages for the server. Auction absolutely everything. Your bank alt will start to accumulate gold soon. By the time you hit 40 you should have more than enough for your mounts if you've sold everything you found while levelling.  This addon includes informant and enchantrix to show you information about what items are used for just by mousing over them and what it's disenchant mats value is (on average).  The ultimate way to make mad bank in wow is auction house trading. Buying underpriced goods and marking them up. Run auctioneer scans daily and you will eventually get an reasonable idea of what things are worth. Farming is for chumps.  4: Not sure what you mean by hotspots. Ironforge and Stormwind will always be busy. Darnassus tends to be a ghost town due to its remoteness. Ironforge became the alliance hub in retail due to having a short flight to menethil for cross-world travel and being fairly close to blackrock mountain for various instances/raids.  6: db.vanillagaming.org is a vanilla mirror of wowhead and is a great resource for searching for info on any quest. Generally quests with vague instructions will have some helpful person in the comments section on that site giving instructions on how to do it.    Google ""vanillaguide 1.04"" this is an addon that provides an in game text-based leveling guide that tells you where to go at what level and which quests to take and which to skip for maximum leveling speed."
wowservers,38uowq,MotherSammy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:13:07 2015 UTC,"Nonetheless, I have started playing on a Vanilla server called Nostalrius   Good choise. You will not regret it.   and I had a few questions that I was hoping could be answered by an experienced player who played WoW in its glory days before the expansions came out.   Alright.   As a level 60 character, what is a reasonable amount of gold that one can acquire per hour, playing solo? And, at which locations (for both horde and alliance) should they be training in order to do so?   That depends. Some items value is based on their market value. Some items fetch a good price at vendors. The best place for ""fetching good price from vendors"" would probably be the 44-46 rock elementals in badlands. However, given the population on this server, I would estimate them to be heavily farmed. Wich is why, the second best place is probably SM unless you manage to find some item that you can farm fairly well that fetches a good place on the market. Tyr's Hand is another popular location probably as well, but given the population on this server, it is likely being already farmed as well."

wowservers,38u2ny,dungeonjay,2,Sun Jun 7 06:12:45 2015 UTC,"Having experienced both, Dalaran wow does not have the PVP advantage, but has the least amount of bugs I could find. I leveled a druid and a priest to 80, I could count the amount of bugged quests on two hands.  On Gamer's Disc there were several bugs in outlands that stopped me from questing in Terrokar. The 7x speed allowed me to skip the zone however.  I believe that's the intention of the high xp, it allows people to skip zones with a lot of bugged quests.  PVP Wise: Gamer's Disc  PVE Wise: Dalaran WoW  Population Wise: Dalaran WoW is growing at a faster rate than Gamer's Disc. GD has been experienced some stagnation while DW continues to break through records.  Least amount of bugs questing: Dalaran WoW  Raid Scripts: Dalaran WoW"
wowservers,38u2ny,Cover25,2,Sun Jun 7 16:36:53 2015 UTC,"Interesting... I have found less combat bugs, less dungeons messing up.  Like the recent bug on Dalaran where if you leave a dungeon and its group but were the last member then reque for a dungeon it transports the entire new group plus you to that dungeon even if it is finished or halfway cleared.  Or an entirely broken dungeon like The Violet Hold which messes up a lot.    I have done an extensive amount of questing for Gamer-District on my main and haven't encountered anything but maybe a small handful of broken quests, then again, I haven't completed the entire questing areas yet.  I have noticed that if GD has a broken sequence in the quest(dialogue, interaction) instead of pushing it through like Dalaran(example: DK starting area) and attempting to have full dialogue interaction they shortcut a lot of the cinematics and maybe even remove some key elements to linear the quest.  Having leveled two 80s on Dalaran and five on Gamer-District I do think that the questing in Northrend is more polished on Gamer-District.  But, then again, Dalaran's focus has been on raiding scripts since the beginning.  They are slowly working on those problems and I feel given time Dalaran will catch up.  Gamer-District server has been running for many years now while Dalaran-Wow is a couple years behind."
wowservers,38qlog,synze,3,Fri Jun 5 23:59:50 2015 UTC,I've been lurking this red for about week looking for a <TBC server that's not pay to win in NA. Vengeance is the only server in NA worth playing but no one plays it. WHY? how is this server not full of people? you guys like the packet loss from playing over seas on top of your extra 100 latency? Your only other option is pay to win full of bugs Warmane. Did something happen with Vengeance that senpukued it's self or what?

Even for guilds if you want to join some conversations and you have a language barrier, guild won't simply go full english mode in guild chat just just because few persons.

My wish would be beeing the one who decides what action will be done if there is a discussion of people who want to keep the bugs inside the game and those who want to bring back the fun of the game as it was back then. Its always hard to make decisions and people lack communication because most times they think reputation is something important. Its not, because the only reason why you open your mouth is you want to support. There are so many servers beeing hosted just to make people pay. Im experiencing people saying if you throw more of the same stuff in the game the issue will be solved. This is wrong, superficially and really dumb, that person should not have the allowance to talk on that specific discussion anymore. I think the best team will be those who can figure out whats the issue and how to solve it and for what. But its right that there are monkeys in groups who keep trying to abuse stuff and benefit their own needs. I wish i had the chance to help a server but it will definitly require some stuff that they wont like and i dont think private servers wont go anywhere. It doesnt have a future. People who are in power(DEVs and other members of the Hosting team) mostly are not interested in Warcraft, they seem like just want to help out or show skills, nothing about whats roleplay.

But onto WoWEmu topic, WoWEmu was just too popular, funservers, scripts and stuff... everything was so easy in LUA...  I've been playing on WoWEmu servers but I've been also scripting own scripts for it."

wowservers,38nlzq,samw99,5,Fri Jun 5 12:57:38 2015 UTC,"It's like saying. If you like something and you've been at it for awhile you shouldn't continue with it. Like for all the wow players that've played since the start.   You're building up a quite broken world image with that mentality and what has the server to do with this post?  Anyway, a neat brief history about it IMO. More posts like this and less negative attitude serves us all good. Peace!"
wowservers,38nlzq,Sobific,5,Fri Jun 5 13:46:54 2015 UTC,"With retail wow being rapidly destroyed by horrific game design decisions, I think it's more important than ever that there exists a plethora of high quality varied private servers.  It will be the private server community that keeps World of Warcraft alive, not Blizzard (especially if the current trajectory of the game continues)."

Many of the great game designers that made wow great (fun) (Vanilla, TBC, wotlk) have now left the game.    The current designers are a pale reflection of the originals, and with the exception of raiding seem to be driving the game swiftly into the dirt.  The worst thing through is the sheer arrogance that Blizzard show to people who idolize their previous expansions.  ""Trust me, you don't want to play that"".  A good designer learns from his mistakes and can look to the past for inspiration, the current designers obviously never got this moto."

wowservers,38q64a,pikunul,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:54:54 2015 UTC,No. No one ever mentioned anything close to Runescape. Is Runescape a survival game? No. Does it require complex crafting systems to achieve progression through a harsh survival environment? No. Not anywhere near close in any way shape or form. Runescape is absolute shite and always will be.
wowservers,38q64a,pikunul,0,Sat Jun 6 05:18:35 2015 UTC,"Never said it was good or bad, but what you originally stated is basically what it would turn out to be.  Don't think what you stated is possible either way. The game is either an MMO, or it's a survival game. Ark is the closest you'll get to your idea."
wowservers,38q64a,Iwasapirateonce,2,Sat Jun 6 06:11:06 2015 UTC,"The interesting thing, is a H1Z1/DayZ type wow experience could be done.  We have all the mechanics and tools required to produce it.   The entire world map (or a continent) would be turned into a free for all pvp zone.  All mobs (or most) would be replaced by zombie mobs, and we would massively buff their agro range so they would have a tendency to horde.   We could implement call for friend mechanics on the mobs so that If you kill individual zombies close to the horde they will tend to mass. Players would have the option of killing each other on sight, or to group up and form teams. Item/consumable upgrades would be found in strategic locations, chests and the like, in houses, old cities etc. All players could have a stacking debuff applied to them at all times called hunger, a debuff that would only be removed by eating/drinking.  After a while the damage from it would be very high and force an urgent trip to obtain food, or face swift death by starvation. A similar mechanic like fatigue could be introduced, and it would stack up when the player is moving, forcing them to rest or sleep at intervals to recharge. The only mechanic I am unsure about is player looting, but I am sure that some devs somewhere have figured out an eloquent solution.  Maybe on player death a small chest is spawned containing their items?   The more I hypothesise about this concept, the more I like it :)  TLDR: We could easily turn wow into a great survival game  Heck, I would even consider teaming up with a few devs to make this happen."

They have capped off the talent tree and only allow you what was available in vanilla but it is off the wrath talent tree.  They have a small pop right now but I've been checking it out and it is growing.  Like right now there is 30+ people on.  They are using the same core that Truewow uses as they are friends or what not.    http://www.primalwow.org/    It should be noted they have blocked off Outland and Northrend and only have vanilla content available minus I think Naxx because of it being a Wrath core.

wowservers,38odrm,sepy007,3,Fri Jun 5 15:03:49 2015 UTC,"Obviously my answer will be very subjective, so I can only give my opinion:  For pure pve, I think 3.3.5a progressive server is your best bet, wotlk just has a great variety of raids to choose from (skip TOC obviously)  TBC also has strong pve, although in my opinion the wrath raids are more impressive from a visual/lore perspective and overall more fun.  For pvp, I would say wrath and tbc are evenly matched.  Wrath has better class diversity and more comps in arena, TBC has a more balanced battleground experience and the classes can be more fun to play (slower pace overall).  Dueling and 1v1 is also better balanced in TBC.  Sadly there is not a catch all tbc or wrath server that has highly active arena and battlegrounds. (or if there is, I have not found it yet)  Vanilla has pretty decent raids.  They are a lot easier in terms of mechanics overall, but require insane amounts of guild organisation and preparation (consumables).  If you want a really hardcore, engaging experience where the server community and the world feels much more alive, then a 1.12 vanilla server may be the choice for you.  Vanilla wow is definitely the purest MMO.  Just be prepared for a lot of grinding.  In my opinion, don't bother with insta lvl 60/ super high exp rate vanilla servers.  They damage the ingame economy and take a lot away from the overall experiencing (vanilla is not about just rushing to 60 and spamming big raids, it's a proper RPG experience where developing characters take a fair amount of time)."

wowservers,38odrm,KnaxxLive,2,Sat Jun 6 00:24:59 2015 UTC,"I would try several at once. For 1.12 I would go nost. This gives you a large population with the ability to level and have fun in vanilla without trying to get to 60 as fast as possible. Also, since you are leveling other characters you can capitalize on rested xp to lessen the grind.   For 2.4.3 I would go Excalibur. They have a good server and 2x xp rates to get you up to max level faster.  The server is decently scripted as well.  Gamer district for 2.4.3 has x7 rates that go to x14 on the weekends.  For 3.3.5a I would do a progressive blizzlike server to dabble with the pve. Getting in on one on with naxx as current content would be preferred. Maybe even one with a smaller population as well. You'll be able to join the raids and guilds, and there are many guides for this expansion since it saw the largest sustained subscriptions. You can find pre raid gear guides all over the place."

They seem to work pretty good and more people are getting 70 every week so I think when kara comes out there will be atleast a couple of raids already at it the first week :>  As you mention, the low population might be a problem with running low level dungeons because of the huge level difference between the online players. But, in my experience there's always some really friendly high levels that can run you through them for the quests without any hesitation.   So I'd say, even though the population is a bit low at the moment, the amazing community makes up for it! Peace."

There are mobs littered everywhere just standing still.  These spawns and their behavior is non-blizzlike.  Some of the quests have the wrong ""trigger states"" where they are part of a chain and can be accessed before a previous quest is completed.    The scripting is not quality and while the leveling experience isn't halted by anything, I felt like I was playing a private server instead of a legitimate server like I do when playing either Kronos or Nost."

We are doing this for community and as a hobby like we've done before on open source community.  Without rt current community what we are doing would not be possible and we appreciate all the feedback and input we can get towards improving the experience.  We've had some misunderstandings before and therefore we receive a lot of negative feedback here on this subreddit.

Get Incite and Improved Thunder Clap. After that take Improved Revenge and fill out the rest of the talents in the third tier. All of the talents in the fourth tier are pretty shitty for leveling. Anticipation is good too.  It's mostly about thinking yourself what's good. For example Improved Bloodrage just gives 15 more rage every 40 seconds, which isn't very useful in my opinion."

wowservers,38i9md,ImDooly,3,Thu Jun 4 11:53:32 2015 UTC,When you create a forum name you will need to change your realmlist to gamer-district in your wrath client and log-in using the forum name/password you setup.  Once you have done this it will activate your forum name.  After you have spent a few hours playing the game the forum changes over to the proper area(it is restricted until you have the hours invested in gameplay).  There you will then access and see everything you are speaking of.

wowservers,38h7ph,tacalacataca,5,Thu Jun 4 04:45:38 2015 UTC,"This quickly devolved into a Dalaran Vs GD thread.  For those that are interested in trying either server and are unsure. The major difference here in my opinion is that one server is at a 1x leveling rate, and the other is at an 7x/14x rate.  Whichever one you find better is up to you. Just because someone here hates 1x rates or heightened rates doesn't automatically make the other server bad."
wowservers,38h7ph,Viewtastic,2,Thu Jun 4 16:13:52 2015 UTC,"Gamer-District isn't progressive.  You level to 80.  Buy some gear off the auction house or pvp some to get into heroics until you are geared enough for ICC heroics then ICC farm to ICC raiding.  That is their progression.  Dalaran is a true progressive wrath server.  Actually, it is the ""most"" progressive wrath server I've ever seen as it has limitations on gear and progression until you finish objectives(ie... clear Naxx 10, Naxx 25 to advance)"
wowservers,38h7ph,dungeonjay,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:56:11 2015 UTC,"Pretty much how I feel every server is, though I remember true progression being something like.   Hit 80 Buy some cheap ass gear off AH, crafted blues mostly. Run 5 man Trial of the Champion Normal until fully geared Run 5 man ICC dungeons normal until fully geared Run 5 man ICC heroics a few times. ICC 10-25 man and up.

wowservers,38h7ph,halpz7,2,Thu Jun 4 14:18:12 2015 UTC,"Then that sums up how long ago it was that you played on their servers.  Things take time to establish.  If scripting a server was easy everyone would do it.  Since they have released and worked on their progressive server it is a lot better than their previous realm.  I understand first impressions but if you haven't touched their servers in over a year you can't form an ""as it is now"" opinion.  That would be like talking smack about Molten about how they were before the Moltdown and the character wipe.  They have a different focus now and are rededicated to their servers since they almost lost everything.  Things change my friend.  Perhaps, you should give Dalaran another try now."

That was listed on their forum.  So the Kingslayer should have been removed.  The transfer was setup to allow you to transfer your 80 and basically that was it in a nutshell.  So you wouldn't have to relevel up from 1-80.    Edit  As far as GM response time.  You aren't the first to have sentiments against how long it takes them to reply to tickets.  I think they are understaffed IMO.
wowservers,38h7ph,dungeonjay,4,Thu Jun 4 14:37:32 2015 UTC,Dalaran-WoW has a lot better scripts/class balance than GD. DW's population is also growing as a fast rate while GD's is stagnating or decliining.  After playing both on end level chars in raids/PVP. I can easly say that DW is far superior to GD.

wowservers,38h7ph,Cover25,2,Thu Jun 4 15:10:59 2015 UTC,"I have also raided on both servers, and would say raid scripting is slightly better on Dalaran, but class scripting is slightly better on GD.

Also doing Wintergrasp on Dalaran, defending vehicles couldn't leave the keep due to broken teleporters, and players could drive the keep cannons around the map."

This situation is even less drastic when you think that most of these servers with cash shops(Excalibur/Gamer District) have been around for years.  They are old servers.  People will have legendaries and max equipment in slot even if they never dropped a dime in the cash shop.  I feel bad for the new kid on the block but I've been there and done that.  It doesn't take long to get geared decently or fully without investing a cent into it on those two servers I just mentioned.  Just have to be able to take the punches until you can return the favor.    You want to talk about cash shops that have unobtainable gear that you have to purchase even after max slotted gear.  Those servers or games are the true defination of P2W.
wowservers,38h7ph,dungeonjay,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:38:24 2015 UTC,"Call it whatever you like. I'm simply arguing that people that decide not buy gear are directly affected by those that are ""p2w"" ""pay to advance""."

So, you have to purchase packages to unlock content to unlock gear.  Yes, people that don't pay for the games they play will suffer a penalty in some form or another.  Even Rift, acclaimed as one of the best F2P games available, has a gear shop in place for pvp gear.    That is the advantages of subscription model.

Id argue there is a certain point where this no longer remains true. Its one thing to say, here is a level 80 in say full T8. Than it is to say, here is a level 80 in full T10+ gear with shadowmourne.  Its no longer ""pay to advance"" when you can buy a piece of gear for real money that literally takes months to farm. Thats strictly pay to win at that point. ""Pay to advance"" is like skipping to the level 80 content, or getting mid-range gear as soon as you hit level 80.  Being able to buy a full set of absolute end-game gear that takes people nearly half a year to farm is not a ""pay to get ahead"" it is a ""pay to win.""  Just because you can obtain something in game, doesnt make buying something in the cash shop any less pay to win."

The two servers I deal with(Gamer-District and Warmane) a full set like that will run over 200 Euros.  I make 50k US dollars a year.  That is a decent salary and I'm saying that I would not drop that much money on 1 toon.  People have different priorities, I'm sure, but how many are we talking about?  1 in 10.  1 in 20?  See where I'm going.  The percentage of people that actually do this is so much lower than the whole percentage of population.  As I commented in a later post....all they are gaining is time invested...time spent in.  On old servers that have been around the block for several years this kind of cash shop matters very very little.    Edit  That is also saying that it is a difference and T8 to T10 is a huge difference in gear."

At any point in time, Blizzard can come to them with a cease and desist and they have to oblige if my knowledge serves me properly.  Mostly, blizzard doesnt care though, because private servers dont typically make a lot of money. As such, blizzard doesnt feel like they are losing out. People who play pservers are either subs, or they are never going to sub, so why should blizzard care?  It'd take a lot more money to shut down servers than it would be to just say fuck it, unless that server is making a lot of money.

Bottom line: overall MoP servers are about 40% blizzlike in my opinion, like: not even half of the stuff you remember from retail is properly implemented. Especially pre-MoP dungeons and raids are in many cases not even open. If you're a new player or looking for well-scripted servers I'd recommend Vanilla - Cata servers. If you're an experienced player specifically looking for MoP content and don't care about low level content, I think you can have some fun on MoP servers already, but they are not even remotely as polished as previous xpacs.  I didn't take a look at Panda-WoW, but judging from their forum about 90% of the posts seem to be in russian. So I think Panda-WoW will have the same problems as WoW Circle for english speakers: you'll have nobody to talk/play with and you won't be able to search items in the AH without knowing the russian translations."

wowservers,38dtil,manbearkat,4,Wed Jun 3 16:59:21 2015 UTC,"The main criticism against Kronos is that it's no way nearly as populated as Nost. It's around 1k-1.5k peak Euro time, but that's not too bad considering that's what your average Vanilla server pop was back in the day.  Haven't hit 60 yet but it's not difficult to find groups for dungeons. People are very social and are willing to add you to their friends list to group up again later. The people are a lot more mature too in my experience (compared to retail, haven't played long enough on Nost to make a comparison).  I've never heard of GDKPs before really, but I'm sure that you could try to find stuff about them on the forums. The server is like 2 months old though so things are still in the formative stages in my opinion."

wowservers,38dtil,dungeonjay,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:07:38 2015 UTC,Let us go on the low side and say just for server storage and nothing else tied to it.  With their current lag problems we also know they are at almost peak compacity for the bandwidth they are paying for per month.  I'm going low and saying under 500 US a month.  Probably around 450.00.  And that is just to pay the server bill.  Nothing else tied to that.
wowservers,38dtil,retsudrats,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:30:32 2015 UTC,"Im going to go out on a limb here and say you have no idea how to run a server....  You assume they are ""lagging"" because of bandwidth issues? You should probably go about thinking again. See, unlike your client, if the server lags because its unable to handle the processes, than its going to correspond to things standing still and so on.  For you, as a user, if your processor/ram/video card cant handle the game, you get fps lag. If the server's processor/ram cant handle the game, you get latency issues as the server literally locks up to finish these processes.  With 10k users online, you arent running into bandwidth issues(what people dont realize about this is, WoW's server hosting hardly takes up bandwidth.) Its literally something like, MAYBE 10KB/s at the most.   What the servers are running into, are hardware limitations. There isnt enough hardware power to calculate 10k player actions, damage dealt, damage taken, gold change, etc, and than spit that out.   This isnt minecraft, where the server has to relay EVERY BIT OF INFORMATION. This is WoW, where the client handles EVERYTHING. Models, mobs, items, etc are all handled by the client. That thing called a ""Cache"" yeah it helps with that. All the server does, in terms of bandwidth, is update positioning information. Apart from that, all the millions of computations are handled by the hardware internally before being sent out as a final result.  Bandwidth literally doesnt play a noticeable part in WoW server development, at least not to the extent that hardware does. Otherwise blizzard servers would be able to handle more than 10k people on average."
wowservers,38dtil,alexhjelm,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:51:47 2015 UTC,"When I wrote that I saw that I didn't add hardware for latency issues.  I know the difference between latency and bandwidth....it does extend to the limb I climb on.  I just didn't go back and edit the post.  Maybe I should have but I didn't.  Yes.  This isn't Minecraft and I understand our clients contain the information.  All the bandwidth does is provide the movement of our characters in that world client to server.  No, I have never ran a server but I do have an estimate of their costs associated to from just having the power of looking it up for personal interest.    Perhaps, instead of arguing the point of bandwidth to hardware the real issue is cost and exactly what I was addressing.  The cost of maintaining and running their server.  The cost of hardware.  The cost of electricity.  The cost of utilities tied to having that server housed ...even their own house if that is where it is located.    I may be on a limb but it is really sturdy and has a good foundation and I thank you for clarifying any errors I may have made in my last post."
wowservers,38dtil,jsDoughctor,2,Wed Jun 3 22:11:37 2015 UTC,"I remember looking at a server a few years back that had anywhere from i believe 5-10k people running about 16gigs of ram. I dont remember the processor specs, but even this was back when I was still in highschool, its safe to assume they werent too over the top.  Depending on some of the companies you go to, you can get decent dedicated servers for cheap.  Nfoservers offers a dedicated with an Intel Xeon E3-1270(quad core 3.4ghz), 16gigs 1333mhz ram, 1TB HDD, 30TB bandwidth all for about 150 a month.  If anything, I'd say that would be enough to handle at least 5k players...Hardware wise. As for the bandwidth, I dont know the exact extent of WoW's badwidth consumption, but I'd assume 30,000 GB of bandwidth a month wouldnt come close to being used.  Nfo's does say though that its ""able"" to host 250-300 connected players at once, but its only an estimation, and not a hard restriction. I feel like that number though is grossly underestimated for something like a WoW server.  Either way, thats a pretty decent machine for 150 a month. Two of those would be 300, and all of the server costs would be completely covered. With a total population of 10k, I dont see 300 dollars in donations being a problem at all. People just assume that because there arent things like donater items that clearly no donations will be had. Its simply untrue, people are more than willing to give to a project they spend time on, to keep it running.  This is all speculation, I dont know what Nos is running right now, but considering servers 10 years ago were a lot more expensive and worse than they are now, Id reckon we arent looking at needing something SUPER expensive..."

wowservers,38dtil,Nephilim-GM-Sevren,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:16:15 2015 UTC,"You're somewhat right, but 10KB/s is completely off.  Something more realistic would be 10 packets / sec / client in a solo situation. In a raid, probably close to 100 (that would be 2-3 noticeable change per player per second, seems realistic, and some for the mobs / mechanics). Maybe 30 on average?  Now for packet size, I don't know about WoW traffic but I'd imagine it'd be like TIMESTAMP|HEADER|DATA, something like 16bit|16bit|0-256bit. An example would be:  165345|PLAYER_MOVEMENT|PLAYER_ID,NEW_X,NEW_Y,NEW_Z (16bit|16bit|16bit|32bit|32bit|32bit)  That would put realistic packet size around 100B.  30 packets / sec x 100B would be 3kB/s, per player.  10'000 players would result in 30MB/s up/down.  Even that isn't a problem at all. Any good hosting in Europe offers 1GB/s up/down, which is way more than what you need.  Maybe another dev who has knowledge of the code / ticking system could provide actual numbers."

wowservers,38dtil,kemdog,0,Wed Jun 3 21:16:30 2015 UTC,"Greetings  I am Senior Gamemaster Sevren from NephilimWoW.  We are a relatively new server, based on the 1.12.1 patch (Classic WoW), however we may expand to other expansions in the future.  We currently have two realms, Crossroads, which is a 1x rates blizzlike server, and Carnage, which is an instant 60 PvP server.  Unfortunately Carnage is not quite ready for full release, you can play on it if you want, although we believe that it is not ready for players.  Crossroads is ready to play on, with no major bugs that would harm your experience, as a matter of fact, a member of staff was able to level to 60 without experiencing any issues.  We believe that we can provide an experience better than Nostalrius or Kronos.  We have a dedicated staff team which includes 8 people which are located in different areas of the world, and therefore at least one person will be online to help you at any time of day.  So what are you waiting for, come and join us today.  link: http://nephilimwow.org/news  -Thanks for reading this  Senior Gamemaster Sevren"

wowservers,388odr,dungeonjay,2,Tue Jun 2 17:24:54 2015 UTC,"Going off of what Struckd said:  Activision Blizzard is a very large company with a long management structure.  This makes it very difficult to get funding for any project.  When something like this is proposed, if it does not meet a certain profit goal, then it is not worth the cost no matter how cheap it will be.  Looking at a factor of 100k signatures on this proposition, this number is less than 1.4% of current subscribers.  Sure, there will be others that join once they are officially announced, but they cannot predict the number of users, nor the amount of time they will subscribe to this additional service.  Additionally, without knowing the amount of subscribers there is no way that Activision Blizzard will make this service free for current subscribers.    Let's look at the cost estimation for this project.  In order to have 5  developers on this project, they will have an approximate billing rate from anywhere from $150-$200 an hour.  This is billing rate, not pay rate.  This accounts for the upkeep costs of computers, building space, electricity, software licenses, etc.  To pay that for one year, assuming 40 hours per week at 50 weeks per year (vacation, etc.) at $150/hr this comes out to $1.5 million.  This is the cost of developers to produce a functional Vanilla WoW client and server based on the original, with some changes and bug fixes.  Or, this is the cost of them adding new graphical content, or making the server progressive, or what have you.  Now, that would be great if 5 developers can do it alone, but they can't.  Since this is a large corporation we need to factor in additional services.  In order to present this as a good idea to the company, you need a minimum of 2 engineers - 1 software and 1 hardware - you need a minimum of 3 business/account folk - 1 for proposals, 1 for budgeting, and 1 for cost analysis.  These will cost a similar hourly rate, with the business/accounting folk costing a bit less, say, $120/hr.  For 3 months of research and time this comes out to $330,000.  Factor this with the $1.5 million for developer costs it comes out to $1.8 million.  Now, we need to consider the external development costs of the project.  In large corporations, there are other people that need to be paid in order to facilitate your work.  We are talking IT for both computing issues and server upkeep, multiple management layers each costing more than the next, multiple levels of change boards that need to approve the things going on, etc.  These costs add up a lot over the course of the project.  Even if they were to form an additional avenue for these servers to go down, they would still need to pay in order to create processes and workflows specifically for these one-off projects.  This can definitely exceed $2.5 million in total and I would not be surprised in the slightest.    In order to make up for this $2.5 million they would need to have 41,667 additional subscribers for 6 months at $10 per month.  Again, this does not take into account upkeep and bug fixes.  And, this is only to break even.  In order to have a profit, they need at least 100k for 6 months.    These numbers are smaller than they should be as this was an EXTREMELY rough estimate done with the bare number of people at the lowest billing rates and it did not account for several other things including continual maintenance.  Sure, if blizzard is able to hold on to their subscribers for over a year or two they can turn a profit.  However, risking $2.5 million over the course of a year and a half with only turning profit several months after is abysmal for a company the size of Activision Blizzard.  This is a company that can produce a single pet at $10 a piece and make $2.2 million off of it in less than 2 months.  This takes an art, a modeler, an animator, and a programmer maybe a month to make.  This cost working for an entire month is $100k which is an extremely high estimate.  They will not ever make legacy WoW servers."

wowservers,388odr,dungeonjay,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:36:31 2015 UTC,Blizzard needs a real money cash shop in order to have a viable business model. They have no interest in exploring vanilla/progression servers like EQ is doing because they won't make the money they need in order to make it profitable.  Cash shops just don't work with the vanilla community and a Blizz server with one will not be popular. Kronos is as 'blizzlike' as you can get it and look at their numbers compared to the no-cash-shop Nostalrius
wowservers,388odr,material_methods,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:37:27 2015 UTC,"You honestly believe that the character auction is the reason kronos didn't have the population?  The hype was for Kronos and their vanilla server.  They were the ones promoting it and Nostalrius did some behind the scenes developing.  Saw that Kronos was about to launch and began campaigning beside them.  They rushed their product out first and the hype that was building for Kronos at the time dying for a ""blizzlike"" vanilla experience jumped onto Nostalrius because it launched first.  Not to mention that the other 1k contender Rebirth just went into a downward spiral just around this time right before the hype wagon.  Kronos got worried and tried to push their product out and it wasn't a 100% ready.  Had a bad beta test and the deal was sealed.  Nostalrius launched, gained the 4k waiting playerbase that is also waiting on Corecraft patiently and it was all but over for the massive playerbase that was expected of Kronos.  Population builds population.  Even that being said Kronos still has a respectful 1.5k EU population and pre-Nostalrius that isn't what we call around here a bad server.  I don't really play on either but I definately follow the trends and that is exactly what I see.    Note added  All this also following a massive disappointment in WoD and a surge of retail players that are awakening to what private servers have to offer which in part I am thankful that Nostalrius has provided.  The hype has carried so much momentum that it trickled into the conversations of the retail player much as Molten did back in their heyday."
wowservers,388odr,dungeonjay,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:13:46 2015 UTC,"You honestly believe that the character auction is the reason kronos didn't have the population?   Yes.  I think your hypothesis is right: people joined Nost at first because they came out first. Thing is, since Kronos has come out, a majority of the new vanilla players are joining Nost over Kronos. Nost had a launch population of ~6k, but now it's at 9k this weekend.  Kronos has better scripting, less crashing, a more responsive dev team, faster patches, and a company running the thing that has been around for a while. The only thing Nost has going in its favor is no cash shop  Vanilla WoW has no cash shop. Any server that has a cash shop is a fundamentally ""non vanilla"" experience. People want that classic WoW feeling again"

There are Dalaran-WoW and True-WoW which have good scripting, there's Warmane which is mainly interesting for PvP players...  Since you already have a MoP realm which seems not to have too many players (When the website said 700 I saw 240 with my census+ addon ingame) and a lot of unavailable content (only about 20 of 64 pre-MoP dungeons open, 0 of 27 pre-MoP raids,...)

wowservers,384ofo,Struckd,3,Mon Jun 1 23:02:22 2015 UTC,"Too late? The server's been out for like 3 months, so no it's not too late.  If you still think it is though, look at it this way. The 60's there are still doing the first tier of raids, because nothing else is out yet, and there's a chance that it won't even change during the time it takes you to get to 60. That's exactly how it would've been if you'd started at server launch, with the only difference being that now there's just going to be more lvl 60's.   Probably over 80% of the people there are still levelling anyway."

You need to think about end game and there will be many more guilds on Nos raiding. Yes more guilds will have raids on farm in a few months but that could make it easier for new 60s to get gear because the others will already be decently geared. Then also there will be new guilds just starting there raiding so you have either or.

I much prefer DW as it has superior scripts and a better community. The skill of people in DW is also higher than that of GD, from what I've experienced.

wowservers,382elj,tmofee,2,Mon Jun 1 17:10:19 2015 UTC,I agree with this. Blizzard reviving a classic server would signify to them a defeat and a failure regarding all the core gameplay and design changes that WoW has undergone since the golden era (vanilla thru wotlk)  But a classic server would be popular. Look at runescape for example. Now more than 50% of rs players play on the Old School server. But blizzard and activision dont want to send the message that their fans would rather play a 10 year old game over their new shitty WoD.

wowservers,384x7d,hvemklomater,21,Mon Jun 1 21:51:30 2015 UTC,"If what you say is true, it's a massive disappointment, not only for the Nostalrius community, but the vanilla community as a whole. Server competition forces servers to give their players the best experience possible over the other server, and if there is only one server remains, a lot of that motivation is gone.  However, even if you were a Nostalrius staff member, which I will believe you were, what's to stop you from slandering Nostalrius just because you are mad? It is apparent that your separation from the Nostalrius staff was not a friendly one, so it is entirely possible that what you are saying here is just to get back at them because you are mad or disappointed with the project. It's ok, 99% of us would do the same thing in the same situation. So with that said, and with the complete lack of proof on anything you have stated here (outside of the proof that you were once a part of the Nostalrius project, which is shaky at best) there is absolutely nothing that you have said that can be trusted. Maybe what you say is true, but we can't believe a word of it until we see it for ourselves.  One day, you may be the person that we look back at and call a prophet because ""he saw all of this coming and tried to warn us"". However, for now, you're just the disheveled dirty raving lunatic on the side of the street yelling at us about the apocalypse that is coming where millions of dinosaurs piloting a spaceship invade the Earth and kill us all. Unless you can actually back anything up, that's all this is.  EDIT: Before the Kronos fanboys downvote me, just try to have some sense of logic about this. I understand that you believe Kronos is the superior server and that more people should play on Kronos, but the downfall of Nostalrius would only make Kronos a worse server. Would Kronos be capable of supporting 10k players at peak times? Is a 10k playerbase what you want on Kronos? Is a complete lack of competition something you want for Kronos? The answer to these questions should be no, so you should hope for the success of Nostalrius, as it preserves your own community, and it keeps the competitions going between the Kronos and Nostalrius teams to provide the best vanilla experience. When servers compete, the playerbase wins."
wowservers,384x7d,DrearyYew,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:21:57 2015 UTC,"The ideal situation is that a large chunk of Nost switches to Kronos, as detailed in my previous long thread.  The funny thing about this situation is that the vanilla community is actually doing this to themselves. They have the power to right the ship and balance out two well running realms, but because of the lemming/sheep-like mindset of just going where everyone else is, Nost will continue to deteriorate as a result of overcrowding, and Kronos will continue to miss out on those players who can't make informed decisions.  Kronos isn't helping itself either, what with avoiding the reversion of the cross-faction mount debacle for example and doing basically no advertising and trying to win by word-of-mouth.  As a Kronos player, I won't down vote you, I will up vote you for thinking in the grand scheme but your thoughts are a bit narrow. You think only in a one-or-the-other circumstance, where as the most optimal situation would be that both share the population.  It's a petty situation where ultimately, the community itself is ruining their own experience."

You make a shady jump-cut to a character that doesn't exist. I don't even know what point you were trying to get across by showing a guild roster other than simply showing their IGNs.    I'll hand it to you that all my interactions with staff have been aloof and I have seen a lot of <GM> Pottu especially inserting their own personal beliefs into their moderation, and I don't doubt that the staff is corrupt but again, there needs to be proof.    I can also tell you that raids such as BWL, AQ, and Naxxramas are NOT scripted already but rather a work in progress - don't expect them to be released in the near future.   With their progressive realm style, BWL is scheduled for the end of the month, it won't matter if it's not done yet so long as it's done by then. AQ is at least four months away and Naxxramas probably year. These things don't matter so much.

People forget way too fast that only 6 months ago nobody even thought conceivable a private server getting over 3k pop and still remaining stable.

wowservers,384x7d,Sokolati_,3,Tue Jun 2 09:36:29 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call Nostalrius stable, exactly. Frequent disconnects / realm crashes happen when the population exceeds 7k concurrent players.  The core simply cannot handle this many players; it's nothing to do with the server, hosting, or administration but the code itself. Like you said, nobody even imagined private servers would ever exceed 3k concurrent players so it was never accounted for.   All Nostalrius needs is a second realm, perhaps making it PvE to placate the masses and give those who are not interested in the WPvP aspect an alternative to ""You agree to be killed when you log in."""

The NA population on Kronos is lacking compared to Nos...But not by enough to make the experience unenjoyable...there are more then enough NA players to easily make dungeon groups, do elite quests and do raids. Kronos has a few NA guilds that raid regularly.  The ping will be slightly less on Nos...but 20-30ms...which is absolutely nothing.  I have a 60 on Nos for the pre-nerf AV that the dev team have promised to be out now...but is not. I don't do end-game dungeons on Nos because in week 3 I would say 60% of the dungeons I did were unable to be completed because one reason or another (completed by killing the majority of bosses not just the end boss). Apparently quite a few of those issues I experience don't exist anymore...but quite a few still do.  The population of Nos is a lot of fun. There are some scripts that Nos has that have not be implemented on Kronos and vice versa...but overall Kronos does have quite a large amount of events and dungeons scripted, close to perfect, that have yet been implemented on Nos, you can tell the different just by questing and your interaction with mobs.  Kronos does have more features that are available compared to Nos. Both now have a bugtracker...but Nos is visbilly more confusing, unorganised and less detailed then Kronos. Kronos also provides a database linked the game, so you can be 100% sure drop rates and NPC/mobs available in the game. Kronos also provides an armoury, honor standing table and Boss kill tracker. All which is detailed in the link I posted above.  The advice I always give is try both. Whatever is the more enjoyable experience. Stick with it."
wowservers,382g0a,Struckd,3,Mon Jun 1 15:42:23 2015 UTC,"Nost has some delay and objectively somewhat worse scripting. The big thing that sets them apart is the population. On Nostalrius you may find leveling to be troublesome because of the number of other players. Kronos' population is much more reasonable (around 1.5k at peak as opposed to Nost's 6k+), but you should still not have any problems finding dungeon groups.  Overall I think you'd have a better experience on Kronos. The population is actually TOO large on Nostalrius, IMO."

Kronos' population is smaller, making leveling much more enjoyable, and dungeon and raid groups are still available, just not as many.  If you're an NA player, however, Nostalrius' ping will be about 20-30ms faster than Kronos, and Kronos is severely lacking in the NA playerbase department, which will make it pretty difficult to find a raid team or even raid pugs appropriate to your time slots. Unless you are bringing a good amount of people with you, you'll have to play on Nostalrius if you're NA."

Kronos will use 1.12 AV, Nos will use pre-1.7.1 AV.  I rolled my melee warlock on Kronos because of the smaller population, then got banned for no reason. So I think you can say that admins are definitely more very dicky and unreasonable on Kronos.  But yah, it's up to you what you choose. If you are looking for serious 60 lvl end game, I would recommend Nostalrius, especially so if you're NA. If you just wanna do, fun goofy stuff like a melee warlock and make a name out of yourself on the server, I would probably choose Kronos(not anymore though, since im banned now)."

wowservers,382g0a,emenems,-3,Tue Jun 2 09:51:31 2015 UTC,No but your ability to buy multiple characters with multiple trade skills gives you an advantage over someone who would have had to level them himself  Obviously zero cash shop is a big deal for the vanilla community; it's one of the reasons Nost is so popular right now and why it's population is growing while Kronos is stagnant
wowservers,382g0a,material_methods,3,Tue Jun 2 10:01:17 2015 UTC,I still dont get that 'win' part but i respect people who dont like character auctions. Ps. Last time when i checked there was only one character on auction house and it wasnt even lvl60
wowservers,382g0a,emenems,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:27:23 2015 UTC,"p2w would be buying a server created rogue with glaives on a TBC server, not buying a lvl 60 char who somebody else levelled. It's funny how people keep saying Kronos' char shop is 'p2w', but nobody says anything about buying a char on any other server, just because you can't do it legitimately.   Nost is popular right now because it's popular. They won the competition for players the second they decided to go online a month before Kronos. Or do you honestly think that pretty much every new vanilla player decides to go on Nost because of things like the character auction? Really?"
wowservers,382g0a,Mephea,0,Tue Jun 2 21:05:30 2015 UTC,"Why else would people play on Nost, other than the no-cash-shop?   Nost's population has gotten to the point at peak times that it is most definitely a detriment (8.5k). Kronos has better scripting, less crashing, a more responsive dev team, faster patches, and a company running the thing that has been around for a while.   Since launch, Nost's population has gone up by 2-2.5k at peak times. Why would the Nost population go up so much if the only reason Nost is populated is because they came out first? If Kronos and Nost had the same feature set, you would expect people to leave Nost and trickle over to Kronos. Any new vanilla player would go to Kronos. This didn't happen, even after the Kotaku article. The Kronos population is stagnant.   The only real difference between the two is the cash shop. I'm sorry but it's true. The real money cash shop is not a vanilla wow experience and people are seeing that"
wowservers,382g0a,material_methods,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:30:14 2015 UTC,"There's also cross-faction mounts, which according to other people, is the reason people don't go to Kronos, not the shop. Kronos' population started going down after day 1, and I don't remember seeing many kodo's running around elwynn during the first weeks.   Why would the Nost population go up so much if the only reason Nost is populated is because they came out first? -  Thousands of people rolled on Nost, spent a month levelling, Kronos came out and they didn't want to reroll (Nost is good enough for anybody wanting to play vanilla), new people look for server, hear about Nost's pop and watch their streams and they roll on Nost. Have a read through that new thread about Nost here. Everybody's praising Nost because of the population and how it makes the server awesome for them.   I personally play on Kronos because I feel it's better quality server and I don't like Nost's population and the issues that comes with it (fighting for mobs, reduced draw distance and lag). Those two features on Kronos have never really bothered me, as they don't affect my gameplay. I'm also guessing it's the same for everybody currently playing on Kronos. Since pretty much every new vanilla player rolls on Nost, I find it hard to believe that the people on Kronos atm are the only aspiring vanilla players left in the world who don't mind the shop or the cross-faction mounts yet dislike Nost's population and its issues.  Since when have people been choosing the highest quality server anyway? Isn't it the same thing with wrath servers, where everybody praises Dalaran's quality, yet there's thousands and thousands more players on Warmane? That's what happening with TBC servers as well. There's no Nost or Warmane- like TBC server, because everybody's waiting for CoreCraft to happen and then they'll roll there. And they're doing this because of CC's reputation, the hype, and because they know everybody's going to roll there."

Honestly if 2-3k players went over to Kronos I would be ecstatic. This isn't happening though - the Nost population is increasing by 2k since launch and the Kronos population is stagnant.  Ask yourself this: if the only reason Nost is so highly populated, why haven't more people left for Kronos? Why did Nost get a Kotaku bump after that article, but Kronos didn't?  Kronos has better scripting, less crashing, a more responsive dev team, faster patches, and a company running the thing that has been around for a while.   I'm saying that the vanilla wow server population does not like their cash shop and Kronos needs to change their shit up in order to actually hold Nost's admins to the fire.

No, the main reason is because Nos launched earlier. And advertisement policies differ. And Nos pop was bigger from the start - it itself matter.  I don't think that many people care about the shop where nothing ingamish is actually sold. I don't even think many people care about anything except population. That's how Feenix grew - simple ""snowball""-model.  I'd like to have the Kronos auction closed, at least because it would stop P2W cries and exaggerations. But I'd also like Kronos to go well, and it's impossible without some money. Anyway, it worked on Twinstar for ages, and I don't think Kronos will ever abandon it just because it seems that some people play on Nos because of the Kronos auction.

wowservers,3830f8,Suntys,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:16:51 2015 UTC,One thing Warmane got pretty much right is the spell queue which was implemented by Blizz in Cata (which ironically probably would be more appreciated by PvE players since PvP guys probably mash their buttons as hard as they can anyways instead of pushing them only once per GCD).  I think up to now only Freakz and Warmane have/had that implemented and Freakz recently switched from Cata to MoP where they don't have it yet implemented again.

It also helps that I feel like I'm giving the middle finger to the incompetent Blizzard developers who have made pvp such crap in the last couple of expansions.  I prefer playing intelligently designed Cata classes with some subtle, non-gamebreaking bugs over the dumbed down classes we have on live, no matter how well scripted. My survival hunter on retail doesn't even have scatter shot or kill shot. That has way more impact on my enjoyment of the game than any bug on Warmane.

Plus, the server itself seems to be a cheaper model than the one on Warmane, it seems to have trouble processing way fewer players than Warmane's.

The scroll wheel on your mouse may be useful here :) I have played on Gamer District a while ago and the only positive for me was speedy leveling which made me feel like I was making good progress on my character. Otherwise it didn't have much population to write home about and extreme gear requirements end game. Avoid
wowservers,38061i,matthewcl375,2,Sun May 31 21:50:27 2015 UTC,The not much population to talk about comes from a particular timezone.  If you play EU evenings the population is over 1.6k then dies off fast as NA evenings come.
wowservers,38061i,dungeonjay,8,Sun May 31 23:51:49 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for a retail WotLK experience, you should roll on Dalaran-WoW. Dalaran has x1 rates, whereas Gamer-District has adjustable xp rates between x1-x7. I believe GD's shop has a few pay-to-win options too.  However, the end-game on Dalaran is quite PvE focused, whereas GD has scenes for both PvE and PvP. I think Dalaran's PvP situation is improving, but at the minute I'd say GD's is better for PvP.   The population on GD is a little higher than Dalaran's. IIRC Dalaran's population peaks around 1.2k, and GD peaks around 1.5k. If you're an EU player, you have a choice but from what I hear Dalaran has a better NA population.  To me, the quality of scripts on both GD and Dalaran are pretty similar (although I haven't played much on either server). However I think the general consensus is that Dala's scripts are slightly better.   It's pretty much up to you. Both have their pro's and con's."

Gamer District have very good scripting and coding, but they sell (expensive) pay to win gear. People running pugs in the chat are asking for 6k GS for VoA, which is hilarious. It's like that on Warmane too, who also sell insane gear for real money. On those high XP rate servers no one wants to help a new player farm up a set of decent gear, so buying gear for money becomes almost a requirement.  Dalaran-WoW has excellent coding/scriping in my opinion. I came across no bugs while leveling in old content, and in Northrend the bugs are minimal. Nothing game breaking. Supposedly a couple of quests don't work correctly, but I haven't been unable to complete any yet. Dungeons work great, etc. Gamer District has surprisingly good coding for a increased xp rate server, but there's almost no North Americans, which is why I don't play on it."
wowservers,38061i,thewallofsleep,1 point,Sun May 31 22:49:16 2015 UTC,GS is the one thing that I hate about Wrath. Back on retail only the best raiders had 6k. Now on P2W servers any idiot can get it.

wowservers,37zktz,Blitz-Lexikon,2,Sun May 31 19:21:40 2015 UTC,really? rebirth is better? then how come it's pop is so low?
wowservers,37zktz,Galahad_Lancelot,3,Mon Jun 1 23:57:07 2015 UTC,"They've had some issues with server reliability, basically. Not long ago there was a long downtime which ultimately led to a rollback of a couple months. Since then there have been few problems with stability."
wowservers,37zktz,Blitz-Lexikon,2,Tue Jun 2 04:45:32 2015 UTC,They are slowly bouncing back in population also.  I popped on a few days ago and there were 102 online which was nice to see.  The server is indeed much more stable than when they were undergoing near constant DDOS attacks - it looks like they've figured out how to properly mitigate those.

wowservers,37zktz,nimeral,3,Mon Jun 1 10:52:20 2015 UTC,I played Valkyrie before TR and have to say TR has better scripts/pathing/all that stuff... both good servers though!
wowservers,37zktz,YaxTheRogue,0,Tue Jun 2 02:12:39 2015 UTC,"/r/rebirthwow and /r/wowservers' both have significant population overlap, so there's going to be a fair bit of bias going on."
wowservers,37zktz,CaptainButtmad,6,Mon Jun 1 15:26:42 2015 UTC,"Nostalrius is too overpopulated if you just want to experience questing.  I would say go with Kronos, Rebirth or Valkyrie.  But, I'm not taking anything away from Nostalrius and the massive playerbase there.  In the end, all four of those vanilla servers are great in their own ways."
wowservers,37zktz,dungeonjay,5,Sun May 31 19:28:18 2015 UTC,"Leveling-wise I believe Kronos and Nostalrius are somewhat equivalent. Many argue that Kronos is a bit better than Nostalrius at the end-game though.  If you want a good questing/leveling experience I'd say Kronos is your best bet. Although Nost's population can be a great thing, it can be kind of annoying when you have to compete with a ton of other people for quest items."
wowservers,37zktz,Tatortotts,3,Sun May 31 19:12:51 2015 UTC,"Nostalrius peaked over 9000 today, not that great for leveling in that aspect. Overpopulated areas and ganking. :( I play nost, but recommend new players to go Kronos. Nost is too full, Kronos needs more. Win/win."

wowservers,37zktz,nimeral,2,Mon Jun 1 10:49:34 2015 UTC,"the fake population rumors ended up just being bugged census data.   But it's not surprising, WoD has been a terrible expansion and with the 3 million subscribers who resubbed for the old wow that they loved only to be let down, there was a desire to expierence the original game again.  I think it's also worth mentioning that nost was a lot better than the alternative vanilla servers when it came out. You have a buggy mess of feenix or the unstable and uncertain future of rebirth. And valk which i can't really comment on.  If you switched the time when nost and kronos came out, kronos would have the population advantage that is for certain."
wowservers,37zktz,yolkol,2,Tue Jun 2 15:15:35 2015 UTC,"This is actually a good point to bring up, and I think it's pretty fascinating what happened with these servers. Nost didn't stick to the traditional advertising methods of just targeting existing private server players, but reached out to disgruntled retail players instead. They launched exactly as the 'romance period' with the current raid tier wore off on retail, and then used viral marketing strategies targeting the players who came back to WOD for the vanilla experience. The campaign was successful enough to where big name streamers have had to discuss the server, and even Blizzard has had to acknowledge it's existence. After people like Asmongold made videos discussing Nost, even if it wasn't an endorsement of the server, more players heard about it and the ball continues to roll. It was an untapped market, and they did an absolutely incredible job selling their server to it."
wowservers,37zktz,CaptainButtmad,2,Mon Jun 1 15:22:23 2015 UTC,"So, most of them came from retail? That explains a lot. At least it teaches Blizz a lesson... Or not."
wowservers,37zktz,nimeral,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:02:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Blizzard has said they don't think it's worthwhile to make vanilla servers, but a bunch of my friends from retail moved over to Nos to play. Hopefully the whole experience brings more people into the private server scene, seeing as there are plenty over perfectly deserving servers that should have more players."
wowservers,37zktz,CaptainButtmad,2,Mon Jun 1 16:17:45 2015 UTC,"Got you. Yes, it'd be good if people won't be scared by p-servers anymore. They're definitely not as bad as they were at 2008 or something."
wowservers,37zktz,nimeral,6,Tue Jun 2 11:37:56 2015 UTC,"Kronos is also said to be a little better in details. NPC speeches, actions etc.   But I'll try not to turn this thread into another endless holywar. Because nothing (especially Feenix) definitely can't competite with this two servers."
wowservers,37zktz,nimeral,2,Sun May 31 19:18:00 2015 UTC,"Im not arguing wether this is the case, but in contrast to that what you just said, one thing I definitely noticed between these two servers is that Nostalrius has zeppelin speeches while Kronos does not."

wowservers,37zktz,Thezanthex,1 point,Sun May 31 22:02:39 2015 UTC,Rebirth has the best scripts around. I tried Nost and Kronos.  I logged in with a ton of people. I was in a guild that was maxed out and was finding it painful to level.  I took a few days off and came back to find out I was kicked from the guild - that's not my style of community.  Rag was exploited very early with nost too. I'd say anyone looking for an authentic vanilla experience hop on Rebirth. The folks are friendly and the server is more stable than ever. I get 100 ping in NA
wowservers,37zktz,alexhjelm,1 point,Sun May 31 23:02:43 2015 UTC,You're gonna get varying opinions between Nostalrius and Kronos on this one. I personally prefer Nost but that's me.

If you wish to play on a server with all of them released, please do, but keep your biased opinion on the server to yourself especially if you haven't even ran those released instances on vengeance to compare to others.  *calling other people stockholm syndrome victims sure shows how mature you are.

wowservers,37zs9p,Struckd,1 point,Sun May 31 23:21:42 2015 UTC,"Nice setup. Really professional looking and smooth.  The format/setting of the reviews itself is a bit...sparse and 'elongated'...if thats the word to use...basically you use too much space for too little information. Theres alot of scrolling and the pictures take up a large amount of unnecessary space in the centre. You try to use the pictures to show off the server whilst giving sparse context. I do like how you cover all the bases...what the server is, how its hosted, the rates, population, ticket support etc.  What is kind of missing is your opinion...did you have fun? What kind of player is the server aimed for (PvE/PvP)? Is it worth spending time on? What was your experience? How easy was it to setup an account? etc. (for example)  Also flesh out your rating system. you gave 4/5...well...where did that number come from? why 5? you added up your thoughts at the end but I feel like it wasn't enough to justify the score. If you are going to use a score system have each point mean something like...5 Points - One for stability, one for devs, one for bugs encountered, one for population and one for content (for example)  Also a scoring system doesn't quite work since private servers come in a MASSIVE range...for example, the twink server v-quality you gave a 4/5...well how about Nostalrius? Would you give it a 4/5 as well? In what world would those two servers be ever close to comparable but still both deserve a 4/5? When they are targeted to different audiences and one requires huge amount of work done to it then the other.  All-in-all I think it looks like a great setup, you have the basis for a great website/review site here and with some more work it could be something special.  Score: 4/5. Well Done"

I'll be straightforward with you guys in regards to the population of our server, we're lacking the advertising bit for sure due to the fact 3/4th of the staff is occupied tracking bugs and fixing them for the players whom currently are already part of our community. We're but a small team working on the project, though we're aware of the population issue.  There is, however, nothing wrong with the content of our server. It's not particularly popular either, but once you get the hang of how things work on Ascension, you'll have a blast.  In the near future I'll be appointing advertiser positions to people whom are interested in helping us spread the world, this will be done in a voluntary manner. Aside from that, a new website is in the making behind-the-scenes and will replace our current one soon.

Warmane has a large population and might be something if you're looking for some PvP. However at the moment it's very unstable, you have lags and sometimes 10 DCs in 10 minutes."

wowservers,37zzv7,thewallofsleep,4,Sun May 31 21:12:15 2015 UTC,"No.  Blizzard have no way of verifying that a person playing on a private server has a Battle.net account for them to ban, nor would they waste their time doing so if they did have that ability."
wowservers,37zzv7,Struckd,2,Sun May 31 22:59:15 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard of anyone that has had their account banned/removed from them because they played on private servers.  Then again no one has gone on the forums or to a Blizz employee with their account and said ""I play on private servers, retail sucks""  There is no way Blizzard can connect your account with your private server account unless you shout it from the rooftops. Sure in their rule book they can rightly remove your account from your possession...but that doesn't mean they are going to...especially if they find out you pay on a random private server (which they never will)"
wowservers,37zzv7,dungeonjay,2,Sun May 31 21:49:22 2015 UTC,Make separate folders...one for the expansion you want to play(throw it in your download section).  When you setup your account name/password don't set it as your WoW retail email login.  Launch the game on that server from Wow.Exe in the client folder you created and you will be on the gravy train.  No way for affiliation unless you blatantly promote that server over trade in retail.

wowservers,37zzv7,Silez,1 point,Mon Jun 1 09:34:08 2015 UTC,"I believe they might as well be aware of every instance of WoW.exe running at any given time, as the client receives data from battle.net regardless of realmlist settings. You can see this from an emergency maintenance message that appears in client logins even if they supposedly have nothing to do with Blizzard server authentication.   And if your client is receiving data because you can't block its internet access, who's to say it's not sending as well.  In any case, Blizzard wrote and maintains the code, not private servers, so it's not that kind of a long shot."

wowservers,37yebp,kingchocobo,2,Sun May 31 13:14:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know about Vanilla, but for WotLK, Warmane/Molten and Gamer District have x7 rates.  Gamer District goes up to x14 on weekends (!!!). I'm not sure where you're from, but I'm from the US, so my opinion is colored by my experience playing at NA times. Warmane has absolutely awful coding and scripting.  Mobs running through walls and terrain.  Mobs bouncing up in the air when you hit them, etc.  Bad pathfinding, and so on and so forth.  Their population is very large though, which is why they are popular.  They even have a sizeable NA player base. Gamer District has great coding as far as I can tell.  They have A LOT of pay to win items on their store though.  They aren't cheap either.  A full set of gear would cost a couple hundred Euro.  The player base is also pretty much entirely European, so a North American player wouldn't find people to play with.  I haven't tried a TBC server, but apparently Excalibur is really good, and has x2 rates.  The XP gain in Vanilla content was increased a bit during retail when TBC launched, so if they are applying x2 to that, it shouldn't be too terrible.  It'll still be slow, but not Vanilla slow.  Someone who has played there should be able to give you a better idea of how long it will take to level 1-70."

By this time Kronos's self advertising did slow which allowed Nos to fill the gap.

wowservers,37zu6v,Dmzone123,3,Sun May 31 20:15:53 2015 UTC,I'd rather see a progressive server than yet another skip straight to ICC server. Problem with these servers is once ICC is available no one ever does Ulduar and Naxx anymore. You might find the occasional ToC group but that's about it.
wowservers,37zu6v,coolfangs,1 point,Sun May 31 21:17:40 2015 UTC,"I wonder if there has ever been atleast one progressive private server that made it to ICC :P all the ones I knew of died well before that.  Progressive is the way to go, seven years of ICC have taken their toll already."
wowservers,37zu6v,Heyharrer,3,Sun May 31 21:59:07 2015 UTC,Dalaran looks like the type of server that will stay as long as we continue to get fresh faces and some of them donate to keep the server going.
wowservers,37zu6v,dungeonjay,3,Sun May 31 23:45:29 2015 UTC,I'm fully confident Dalaran will make it to ICC.
wowservers,37zu6v,coolfangs,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:03:19 2015 UTC,"I think I'd like to see server where every raid from vanilla to WotLK has item drops and bosses scaled to ICC level, with a weekly rotation of which raid has bonus loot drops. Then you'd have a dozen different raids that would all get play time."
wowservers,37zu6v,belte,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:35:55 2015 UTC,"Same with Progressive Servers, you are forced to do only one instance (ToC) while waiting for ICC"
wowservers,37zu6v,Ahuna,0,Mon Jun 1 10:44:56 2015 UTC,"Primal-WoW is progressive.  Uses the WotLK client ... but currently we're just starting to hit level 60 and clearing the Vanilla content.  They plan on a 6 year project (2 Vanilla, 2 TBC, 2 WotLK), not sure if that is ""too"" progressive for you though."
wowservers,37y453,lolzerite,3,Sun May 31 11:08:21 2015 UTC,"I play on Dalaran and I'm from the east coast as well.  I'm a Horde mage level 71 (I'll PM you my toon name).  I see a reasonable number of people online during the evenings, and definitely more on weekends.  Apparently the NA population is decent overall.  Gamer District has nearly zero NA population.  I tried it for a couple days and the population dropped from a couple thousand during the day (NA time) to a couple hundred during the night (NA time).  Basically, once it's peak NA time (6pm-12am), many of the Europeans aren't playing anymore. Another thing about GD is they sell (expensive) pay to win gear.  People running pugs in the chat are asking for 6k GS for VoA, which is hilarious.  It's like that on Warmane too, who also sell sick gear for real money.  On those high XP rate servers no one wants to help a new player farm up a set of decent gear, so buying gear for money becomes almost a requirement.  Also, to weigh in on the other comment, Dalaran-WoW has excellent coding/scriping in my opinion.  I came across no bugs while leveling in old content, and in Northrend the bugs are minimal.  Nothing game breaking.  Supposedly a couple of quests don't work correctly, but I haven't been unable to complete any yet.  Dungeons work great, etc. Gamer District has surprisingly good coding for a increased xp rate server, but there's almost no North Americans."
wowservers,37y453,thewallofsleep,3,Sun May 31 13:48:13 2015 UTC,"The person asking for ridiculous gearscore for VoA is just an example of a bad.  You are 100% spot on for population in the evenings vs day if NA.  I play on GD(NA player here), but only when I can play during the day...usually a day off.  Otherwise, the population is down around 300 in NA evenings.  I would like to see an increase in NA population on that server but at the same time I think Dalaran is starting to draw enough NA population to make that the go-to evening NA server for Wrath."
wowservers,37y453,dungeonjay,2,Sun May 31 17:54:05 2015 UTC,"We can hope.  Nostalrius seems to pretty much have the Vanilla Blizzlike thing down and a lot of NA players have flocked to it.  Let's hope that he buzz from that server has more NA players interested in private servers overall and wanting to check out a Wrath server.  My favorite times in the game were during Wrath, so that's what I want to play.  I consider a perfect middle ground between Vanilla and what WoW became starting with Cataclysm (specially the last patch of Cataclysm)."
wowservers,37y453,thewallofsleep,2,Sun May 31 18:14:15 2015 UTC,Playing on the East Coast myself I can tell you that Gamer-District has a lower population during that playtime.  Dalaran is steadily getting better population in off-peak hours.  Just help promote it like I have been doing.  Six months ago the population on Horde/Alliance in East Coast time was like 350-400 combined.  It has grown double that.
wowservers,37y453,dungeonjay,2,Sun May 31 13:46:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I used to play on Warmane back when it was molten. The community was ridiculous. I'll admit I donated for gear back then but that was out of necessity to be able to get into pugs.   The coding on Dalaran is very good. I'm 74 atm, and I have hit quite a few broken quests, but nothing gamebreaking, and I'm rather excited for the raids. That was one of the main reasons I ended up quitting molten, aside from the community. There were plenty of bugs and ways to exploit it, as well as class bugs, that just made it lame.   Good to hear about the population, and I figured it'd only go up from here, especially when TOC releases. Thanks for the response everyone, and if you wanna add me, I'm lolzerite ingame!"

wowservers,37xn1l,coolfangs,2,Sun May 31 06:59:26 2015 UTC,"It's currently on Ulduar, with ToC planned to be out in the next few months. However it is set up so that you have to do the previous tiers before it'll even let you do the later tiers. So to do ICC, you gotta do ToC, and to do ToC, you gotta do Uld, and to do Uld, you gotta do Naxx."
wowservers,37xn1l,Snicktor,2,Sun May 31 07:05:03 2015 UTC,"yah it has lower pop but best scripting out there with all bosses working, and its progressive in that you have too do naxx ulduar obsidium too get too icc"
wowservers,37xn1l,Netw3,2,Sun May 31 07:05:38 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that it's low pop. It's an established but kinda obsolete idea. Dalaran now has a pretty steady population of 1.2k, which is low if compared to molten, but more than healthy for a server."
wowservers,37xn1l,dungeonjay,3,Sun May 31 11:42:50 2015 UTC,"You won't find a server that is on Naxx/Ulduar other than Dalaran.  They are just now getting into the ToC phase.  The population is healthy for a wrath server.  It does not offer Transmog.  If you want to speed up the process of creating a DK you will need to create a class and pay out some cash to get him to instant 70 so you can create a DK on their server.  Otherwise, you will need to level another toon to the appropriate level before you can create the class."

wowservers,37umxw,DrearyYew,3,Sat May 30 16:38:53 2015 UTC,"I think you read what I wrote all wrong.  The competition (Nostalrius) has a much longer release schedule. Dire Maul just released today, where it was available at launch on Kronos (which I highly disagree with since it invalidates a significant amount of MC gear, but that's a whole different topic).  It still is all a matter of opinion. If you want to see the content on a faster track, go for it, Kronos seems to be offering that. If you want the server to have a longer lifetime where your time and effort will not be invalidated as quickly, Nostalrius offers that. There is no right or wrong, it's opinion. I prefer Nostalrius' release track to Kronos', and that's just my opinion."
wowservers,37umxw,zipzo6,4,Sat May 30 17:03:52 2015 UTC,"It's Molten Core...nobody is riding that high on life over their MC loot, and I have a lot of it trust me.  Nostalrius has no track...the track they offered was already invalidated and thus you have no track to speak of..."
wowservers,37umxw,WoWProjectKronos,3,Sun May 31 00:22:52 2015 UTC,"As has already been said, the content has been announced after considering the requests of the community, while keeping the servers long term interests in mind. We also concur that BWL is less likely to be cleared in such time, as mechanics are a lot less forgiving. This will have a natural slowing effect on the servers future content releases.  In regard to the Dire Maul gear: I would suggest that Blizzards poor itemization at the time of release was the cause for this, which is why many classes can still be more than comfortable in their pre-raid blues when entering BWL.   The effect of having Dire Maul released has been negligible at best, as we are seeing content cleared in roughly the same sort of time period as they are on your own server. In total elapsed time, from server release to Ragnaros dying, there is a matter of days between the two.  In closing, Kronos is not going to be done and dusted any time soon."

Other tiers will simply take much longer to get on farm status for many guilds than it took for T1, that much should be pretty obvious, so I wouldn't be very concerned about pace. Having a bunch of guilds farming C'thun in order to spur Naxx release hype isn't going to be as easy as it was getting a bunch of Rag clearing guilds. I'm not sure I understand why people don't see that."

A huge % of people won't even clear AQ40. It's likely a chunk of people won't see the end of BWL. Molten Core is simply the lowest common denominator of raids, so it's understandable it gets cleared fast by a large raiding population.  As a result, the life of a server (Kronos) is not going to be dependent on the raids made available, or even the population-wide clear %."

wowservers,37w8kw,Struckd,1 point,Sun May 31 08:17:34 2015 UTC,"I actually dont really agree with this post. I think the idea that you need to undergo the grueling horrible x1 or x2 grind to ""l2p"". I think high rates like x15 actually help you learn your class through leveling but allow you to get to endgame more quickly."
wowservers,37w8kw,peteymcfly,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:37:48 2015 UTC,But without the gear to support your level..that is a really inefficient way to learn your class...not to mention it makes professions obsolete until 60...and thats a grind and a half since you wont be leveling them while leveling yourself...but doing it outside leveling because you outlevel everything.
wowservers,37w8kw,Struckd,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:04:18 2015 UTC,"I dont personally find gear to matter that much during leveling. Sure you outlevel your gear, but WoW is not a very hard game to play - it just takes a lot of time. I dont see what you mean by inefficient. Even if you outlevel your gear you can still learn a class's mechanics by questing 3-4 levels below.  But youre right that if a server doesnt also boost its profession rate then it does leave professions pretty screwed up. But all im saying is that you dont need to grind quests and horrible exp rates for days to learn how to play a class well. In fact, leveling on a high rate teaches you class mechanics just fine. Ive done it several times before and i dont think its inefficient."
wowservers,37w8kw,peteymcfly,3,Tue Jun 2 15:14:58 2015 UTC,"What expansion? :)  For WOTLK I'd say Gamer-District is perfect for you. It's 7x XP rates, other rates increased aswell such as reputation & proff. but not epic drop rate :P. On weekends it's 14x XP rate so it's even faster, it has an active PvE community & it's an international community.  Umm for Cata / MoP I guess Warmane (?) I havent really played Cata & MoP Private servers but they got high XP rates, good population & PvE content available (Atleast on the Cata server, dunno bout the MoP one)."

wowservers,37w3zp,Blujay12,4,Sat May 30 22:01:21 2015 UTC,I downloaded my 3.3.5a client from warmane: https://www.warmane.com/download. Just change the realmlist to 'set realmlist logon.dalaran-server.com'. Works fine with Dalaran-WoW and Gamer-District.
wowservers,37w3zp,pawddy,2,Sat May 30 22:09:27 2015 UTC,Ok thanks man
wowservers,37vfuq,dzsudzak,8,Sat May 30 18:57:33 2015 UTC,Dalaran-wow.  You can do the RaF tool and get x3 xp rate.  Dungeon finder works and it has a mostly polished questing/leveling experience.
wowservers,37vfuq,dungeonjay,5,Sat May 30 19:40:31 2015 UTC,"Seconded on Dalaran (WOTLK), most of the questing stuff works really well. Nost and Kronos both have decent questing stuff, both are Vanilla, however, Nost's population is close to 8k at peak times, so the world PVP is unavoidable and the competition for quest objectives would make the experience a bit painful. Kronos is about 1.5k at peak, and is a bit more easy on the leveling experience because of that. Atlantiss is also fun, and is Cataclysm and they have a quest map on their website to avoid bugs. Peaks at around 1.2kish."
wowservers,37vfuq,CaptainButtmad,3,Sat May 30 20:13:52 2015 UTC,"For leveling experience I recommend You Atlantiss, I love leveling there, almost every quest is working blizzlike, all dungeons work. And leveling in Cataclysm is easier than on previous expansions(definitely easier than vanilla). I just started leveling 16th character on Atlantiss(already have 8x85, 3x80+, 2x70+, 1x60~, 1x40~) and I'm sure that I will make a lot more in future, because leveling on Atlantiss is fun (-).

wowservers,37vfuq,Elizahbeth,0,Sun May 31 03:48:17 2015 UTC,i can recommend https://wow.freakz.ro/ they recently updated from cata to mop and rdf works all the way up to level 90 with all mop dungeons. you can also set your own leveling rates.
wowservers,37vfuq,Ahuna,-3,Sun May 31 14:13:54 2015 UTC,"Primal-Wow (http://www.primalwow.org/) is quite fun.  It's a PvE server using the WotLK 3.3.5 client but is ""progressive"".  Currently, we're just leveling up to 60 where we will be capped until all Vanilla content is cleared.  Then they increase the cap to 70 and allow you to enter Outlands ... etc. Relaxed, laid back and friendly overall."

wowservers,37v3g3,denghoul,3,Sat May 30 17:24:13 2015 UTC,"Generally means experience.  There are 3 types of rates: Gold Rate, Exp Rate and Drop Rate.

Meanwhile the WotLK servers are all highly populated.  Might have something to do with the addition of DKs and Lich being the last decent server type that added any content. I havent heard to much about cata, let alone mop, having servers that are 90% working as intended.  Personally prefer wrath, as dual wield, frost DK tanking is by far my most treasured experience."
wowservers,37thyz,aneq,3,Sat May 30 08:24:45 2015 UTC,"Nah, just corecraft hype. It was nolst/kronos dickriding before it was released and there was a lot of bugs and disconnection problems. People like wrath because it was easy but you don't get branded a Cata baby (even though current tier Cata is a lot harder, bar maybe Dalaran because of their forced progression system)."

wowservers,37thyz,synze,1 point,Sun May 31 17:51:55 2015 UTC,Surprised to see more love for Cata than MoP. I usually hear people complain how awful Cata apparently was (even though I though most of it was great).
wowservers,37thyz,aneq,2,Sat May 30 10:24:29 2015 UTC,Everything before Dragon Soul was super fun imo.
wowservers,37thyz,762x39mm,3,Sat May 30 14:11:29 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. Dragon Soul was a huge disappointment of a raid. All the other tiers in Cata were great. Would also love to see a private server do pre-nerf heroic dungeons, those were a blast."
wowservers,37thyz,Thundercats_Hoooo,0,Sat May 30 16:32:57 2015 UTC,"And the fact that inbetween the release of Dragon Soul and the expansion was extremely long.   Dragon Soul was released 30/11/2011  MoP pre-patch was released 28/08/2012  NINE MONTHS of just facerolling! It was just incredibly boring, cause of how easy the raid became after some time."

wowservers,37rgxi,Grimhorn,4,Sat May 30 18:26:05 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting post, because it's about 50/50 between truth and misinformation. I'll try and address the main points.  Mob movement has never made raids unplayable, although it did make them more difficult until it was fixed a while back.  Community it seems is a matter of taste. I can't speak for the allies, but the Horde are great.  Patching, as you say, is back to about once a month now, GMs had their hands full just keeping the server from being DDOSd a while back, so not much work went on the actual game mechanics.  GMs using GM powers to ""help"" raids isn't a thing. If something bugs out they will fix it, but since the BWL gate fixes went in I can't remember needing GM assistance in a raid at all on Horde side.  The lead GM did vanish with donation money, forcing the server to be restored from backups, but discussion of it has never been forbidden.  Scripting is better than either Nost or Kronos, quest RP, RP events in instances, boss mechanics etc.   Mobs do have issues with pathing around water, and this carries over to hunter/warlock pets.  Raid coding is light years ahead of Nost at least, the first rag kill on there the main tank only had 140 fire res XD. There is no botting in raids, at least on Horde side, this is just a lie, and of the three guilds clearing 40man content, only one has to multibox heavily, others just tend to bring alts to buff with and collect gear that would otherwise be DEd.  There was a big gap between MC and BWL a few years back, which I assume was due to the heavy DDOSing by the pay to win servers.  ""100 people at peak"" is also a straight up lie.  Rebirth is a small server, but it has enough pop for raids and pvp, and has a better track record than any other vanilla server for uptime and never wiping player data.  It's been bigger than several actual live blizz servers in the past, and I don't see why it wouldn't be again."
wowservers,37rgxi,SgtAngua,2,Fri May 29 21:31:32 2015 UTC,"I was going to grace your posts with an actual response but seeing how you keep lying through your teeth about many subjects I'll just address few main points to clarify them.   We never forbade any discussion about any topic. That is a blatant lie and goes against our very conduct where we've always been for discussion of all topics without limitations. The only posts we've removed have been those of blatant advertisement. What you mistake as ""forbidding topics"" is our admittably slow response to the donation drama and long silence but that was solely because we tried to the end get into contact with Freaky whom arranged entire situation before coming out with all the information we had, which we did in our forums. We never removed any GMs for ""wanting transparency"". This is simply another blatant lie. What drama occured happened months after one GM by his own choice resigned and that was cleared up with him. I'm personally still friends with him to this date. I have no idea whom is this other GM you even talk about. Some of us partake raids as players of the server yes, but we're very much forbidden to have any interaction with the raid we're in with our GM characters. There is no ""helping out"" of anyone under any circumstances if we've taken part in a raid.  Bugs. Well, as personal moral standard I will not speak against other realms but the claims in regards of these are quite ludicurous and quite clearly showcases an agenda present here (amongst with many of the other lies presented).   It'd be considerate of you to refrain saying ""100% of the stuff I say is correct"" when it's either all out lies or very coloured description of cases."
wowservers,37rgxi,Judgement_therebirth,2,Sat May 30 01:18:45 2015 UTC,"I call spade a spade. There were lot of factually incorrect information in your posts made by intent, thus lies. We've never opposed constructive criticism however.  Now lets start deconstructing this message.   "" Anytime anyone posted up mention of what happened before you graced us with any sort of response got deleted. And yes, you apparently know who I'm talking about in regards to the GM who left. A few people screenshotted comments and posted them up in the comments on other submissions, but they of course were pulled.""   The comments he made was when he was absolutely smashed out and he himself deleted his own messages from reddit next day after sobering up. Whetever any screenies of his comments were removed was because of this as he himself obviously didn't want spew the drama after getting out of the drunk-state. Any discussion surrounding it however was never deleted, we simply didn't respond until we ourselves had the full picture in our hand which took time because considering Freaky's history as sole supporter and creator of server we gave him the benefit of the doubt. And this was still long after he had quit being a GM, he was never removed from the position by us as you blatantly said.  2 Bugs. Once again I can't really address this because I have no intentions to trash talk other servers but claiming we're behind is very untrue. There were some recent issues with pathing as we did fixes for it, those have been hotfixed quite fast after finding out the issue.  As for being well informed, considering how flawed your information presented here has been that is quite peculiar thing to say. We've been nothing but honest of our service ever since Freaky made his leave and we had to struggle through the mess that was left behind."
wowservers,37rgxi,Judgement_therebirth,4,Sat May 30 10:39:43 2015 UTC,"he gets hit with a 'YOU SHOULD PLAY ON REBIRTH' post.   This provides an example of how you exaggerate/distort.  The original commenter has played on the Rebirth and is only lvl 24.  He never said, what you just quoted.  He simply said this is the server they play on and they like it, because of said reason.  They even listed the downsides.  It's quite modest.  It's impressive spinning, but say what you wish. The readers can see how you twisted things in this short thread and make their value judgements on your perspective."

I'll confirm the multiboxing, and it is kinda sad honestly.  But I do have to say that the community I've met so far on rebirth was the friendliest I've ever seen in an MMO. And the scripts I've seen so far simply outclassed the other server I played on (ED)  Probably come the summer I'll decide to return to Emerald Dream (buggy as shit, got to level 43 and some dungeons have completely broken/unreachable bosses) or try out one of the higher pop servers if Rebirth can't get more population by then, as it feels empty most of the time."
wowservers,37rgxi,Ambassador_Buta,-1,Sat May 30 14:39:35 2015 UTC,"Removing crossfaction chat helped a ton with the community, but a bit of the general salt never really left. Nothing like zoning into Redridge to be greeted by an entire thesaurus of racial insults combined with suggestions as to what I should do with a male goat. It's a step up from Emerald Dream in that at least Uldaman and Zul'farrak sort of work, but the world itself is dead and Emerald Dream is only slightly better. I'd really suggest Kronos if you're looking for that middle of the road population, it's closer to what Emerald Dream was post-crash with NA peaks at 600ish, and EU peaks at 1500. I've been enjoying the population on Nostralius a lot, but it can be overwhelming. Rebirth isn't a bad server per se, but the management is as bad as, if not worse than Feenix. It was a big deal when Rebirth made it to 4 months without having weeks or months of downtime, and every patch generally kills the server off for a few days. It's just that right now both Feenix and Rebirth are collapsing under the weight of the newer servers."

Of 3400 players who were logged in (according to their website) only 23 were in the english chat channel, and only 4 of them had names I could actually read instead of ?????????, one of them being me.  You couldn't search items in the AH unless you knew their russian names.  I haven't tried their WotLK realm but I imagine that the situation is the same: as a russian the server might be pretty nice, as an english speaker not so much."

wowservers,37pg7b,coolfangs,1 point,Sat May 30 00:59:18 2015 UTC,"If it is an installer, then just install it to a different location.

wowservers,37pray,Craptola,3,Fri May 29 13:00:04 2015 UTC,"Perfect server for you is Atlantiss. They are currently on Tier 11, soon Firelands with T12 will be released, but I am sure you will manage to level to 85 before FL are released.  They haven't nerfed bosses themselves, but they had to nerf spells with patch 4.3.4.   Scripting is really good, population is enough to play dungeons and raids ;-)"

Although a few polish guilds have 13/13 heroic and are on farm mode, there are a lot of NA  and EU guilds still progressing t11 since the server was mostly polish for a long time. The guild I'm in, The Nemesis Order, on alliance, is 7/13 hc and we're looking for a full bwd HC clear today.   One piece of advice though, a lot of aoe/void zone type mechanics like fire are visually bugged and have a slightly bigger area than what it looks like.   Also, the server has working Recruit a Friend so keep that on mind if you want to level fast (multiboxing in PvP is a no-no but great for leveling)  Feel free to add Deflexure on alliance side if you want hooked up with some gold for training and bags.  EDIT: 13/13 heroic guilds are pre 4.3.4 core upgrade as Nefarion is currently bugged and can't be killed."

wowservers,37mkrl,15liam20,3,Fri May 29 06:49:46 2015 UTC,There was a bug in dungeons where you would stay in combat even though you'd cleared the mob groups which meant you had to wait for a GM to clear it for you. I also found non-patrolling pats linked to groups making the pulls impossible.

wowservers,37mkrl,X-Savior,6,Fri May 29 23:15:07 2015 UTC,This has been discussed on other posts but there is lots of casual players who are playing but waiting for Raids to release.... so just looking at online population in no way actually reflects the servers population. This is the problem... vicious circle... people do not join because not many people online... not many people online because people do not join.  As soon as people just come and start playing the sooner others will come also... It is a weird chicken and the egg scenario.  online player size does not reflect your player experience either... everyone who has come has had no trouble finding people and joining guilds.

wowservers,37mmtn,CaptainButtmad,2,Thu May 28 21:50:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've done all of the content there and it's pretty much 100%, especially after the recent big fix patch. It's considered to be the most blizzlike of the WOTLK servers out there. The only 'custom' part is that the server's raid progression requires attunements through the achievement system. Basically, you need the T7 naxx completion achievement to do T8 Ulduar, and the T8 Ulduar achievement to enter T9's TOC, and T9 TOC's to do ICC. Just 1 of each boss killed on normal, and you can't get emblems of Triumph until you've cleared Ulduar, and Emblems of Frost until you've done TOC, so as to keep the content fresh indefinitely. Has a pretty healthy population of 1.2-1.6k online at peak, and 400-600 on at NA times. I'd recommend it."

wowservers,37o2bm,dalaraz,2,Sat May 30 15:35:10 2015 UTC,"Imho people have just been brainwashed to think that CC is the only TBC server worthy of their time, and that nothing else should even be considered (props to their advertising and hype they've been building).   It's pretty clear from reading these forums that people would rather wait for CC for an x amount of time than play on a different server, without even actually knowing how good CC is, or even knowing how good CC is compared to other servers."

wowservers,37o2bm,coolfangs,2,Fri May 29 11:06:18 2015 UTC,"Well that's just it. There isn't another TBC server that's hyped up to be what CC is, but that doesn't mean all the available TBC servers are shit. Take Vengeance for example. I don't remember reading any negative comments about the server quality here or in game, yet it's still pretty darn quiet in there.  Another example is the whole Nost vs. Kronos thing. Majority of vanilla players go crazy over how amazing experience Nost is, how they love the high pop and how it makes them cry of Nostalgia. At the same time, Kronos is the one with better quality, and even more blizzlike population, but all those gets easily ignored. (my point of saying this isn't to start a server battle, I don't have any hate for either of the servers, just pointing out peoples mentality when it comes to choosing a server).  And the funny thing is, if you were to ask people why they don't play on Vengeance (or Kronos), I can guarantee they'd say it's because of the low population. Yet, if you were to ask the same people why they're so hyped about CC and waiting for it like it'll be the next best thing after slic...steak, they'd say it's because its quality is supposed to be better than 'blizzlike'."
wowservers,37o2bm,Mephea,2,Fri May 29 14:21:23 2015 UTC,"If Kronos had managed to get out sooner, it would have been the leading server. Nostalrius scripting is just as good or almost as good as Kronos, and they got a month head start. There was no hype for Nost until a release date was announced for it, and all the people hyped for Kronos switched over. The same thing will happen if another TBC server ever comes out with competing quality."
wowservers,37o2bm,coolfangs,0,Fri May 29 18:54:01 2015 UTC,"Most TBC servers are pretty buggy, and some are pay to win. Corecraft is being advertised as a extremely well scripted server(thats why theyve been working on it for so long). They usually do their tests randomly from what i've seen"

If you don't mind this then I'd recommend Heroes-WoW, as they're based on the wotlk system but have increased level cap to 255.

wowservers,37ndrx,Sheda56,4,Thu May 28 22:25:21 2015 UTC,"Since you are new player, I strongly recommend you a low rate server: x1 (if cata+), max x2 (if vanilla, the burning crusade, wrath of the lich king). I think everyone should level a character with low rates at least once.  First thing to choose is not a server, but expansion. Classical WoW from 2004 is called vanilla, The Burning Crusade was released in 2007, then Wrath of the Lich king in 2008, Cataclysm (2010), Mists of Pandaria 2012 and Warlords of Dreanor in 2014.  WoW has changed a lot since 2004. Some people will say: for the worse, others: for the better. One thing is sure: since Cataclysm WoW is much more casual than it used to be. In vanilla even fight with normal mobs was a challenge, now it is no more.  If you want to feel true '04 WoW experience, try  Kronos WoW or Nostalrius. Both are vanilla x1 servers. Or you may want to start with wrath, which still contains a lot from classical WoW, but already has some changes so that it is easier (e.g. DF - dungeon finder - a tool which automatically search for a group for a dungeon, previously you had to look for people with chat). Or you may start with Cataclysm server, which has completely revamped 1-60 content. It is up to you. I do not recommend MoP servers because all of them suck and will discourage you as a new player ;-)  Try each expansion if you are not sure what you want :)    Once you choose an expansion you have to choose a server, check the list of all popular servers divided by expansion with rates."

wowservers,37ndrx,swarmed100,2,Tue Jul 21 07:22:47 2015 UTC,"You really should not start on private server if you are playing first time. While you still gonna get awesome first impression of the game, no matter what expansion it's gonna be, you gonna be dissapointed in private servers community and bugged quests/instances/raids/etc.   I suggest you to play on retail first, at that point WoW is awesome for a new player. Also i highly recommend you to not listen to people who suggest vanilla servers, because of their nostalgic feelings, it is gonna be awful for a beginner."
wowservers,37ndrx,thewallofsleep,3,Fri May 29 09:51:41 2015 UTC,That depends on what kind of player you are. I started played WoW in wotlk. I played retail for some time and switched to a private one after that. (back when private servers didn't lag two expansions behind )  I'm now playing on Kronos and I love vanilla wow. I never played it so I don't have nostalgic feelings. In my opinion vanilla is better for players who want a challenge and a nice community. There's a real 'us vs the horrible environment' thing in vanilla. Meanwhile wotlk is easier but there's less community and it just feels dull outside of ICC. But that's just my opinion of course :)

wowservers,37kacx,Ventoia,3,Thu May 28 13:06:37 2015 UTC,"I'm currently playing on alliance but I have not been on there too long myself so I may not have a perfect idea, but I will try to help if I can.  From what I have heard in guild chat and forums, dps classes are most needed, mainly hunter and warlock from the look of things. Tank warriors also seem to be in need (someone mentioned on gchat the other night that there was only one tank specced warrior, but that may have been because of warrior tanking being a bit buggy until now). While on the other hand there seem to be an abundance of paladins and shamans so those might not be the best classes to pick.  With that said however usually when people ask everyone says just play the class you will have the most fun playing since the community is small at the moment, its quite inclusive and i'm sure people will find a space for you in groups no matter what you play. Also there are quite a few 70s that are inactive at the moment, waiting for the raiding content to be released from what I have been told, so what classes seem short now could change when actual raids start up.  If you are unsure still or you were planning to play Horde, the best thing to do probably would be to just make a temporary character join the guild you want (with the low pop I dont think there are any real requirements for any guild at the moment other than be respectful to each other) and ask what class they think would be best to play."

So I'll beat around the bush and ask what makes you believe that you can provide a better experience than Nostalrius or Kronos?  Although the servers are new, they seem to be settling down nicely and proving an above par experience in the vanilla scene. People like to bash one or the other, but both seem to be without fault for the most part. Not saying that a third server couldn't fit in, but I'm curious as to what makes you stand out from what the other two have to offer.

The staff at NephilimWoW understand that people have invested time into Nostalrius or Kronos, and we are not saying that they are bad servers, they are actually in the top tier of vanilla servers, that is why we compared our server to theirs. The reasons we consider ourselves better than the other two servers mentioned are plentiful, but include; No major bugs (as mentioned above); and a dedicated and friendly staff team (including 8 members, which is willing to grow). We also have our ""Carnage"" realm which, although it is not complete, will be able to provide an experience that is completely different to Nostalrius and Kronos.   Thanks for commenting -Senior Gamemaster Sevren"
wowservers,37lzrc,gokdoi,1 point,Thu May 28 17:51:23 2015 UTC,"I always hate to say things like this, but...  Leveling with low rates on new servers is always a gamble with many disadvantageous odds.  To play, I have to spend around one month on leveling (more or less, bear with me for a moment). There could be other five, or ten, or a hundred players doing that at the same time. I have to hope that they won't give up halfway, that the staff team won't get bored of the project, that the hosting expenses can be paid properly. Basically, that I won't wake up one day and see all the effort I put into the server vanish into thin air.  This happens with a great number of servers.  Now, Nos and Kronos have a number of players that gives a sense of security, perhaps a false one, but still. No extremely highly populated server has ever closed down for trivial reasons.  You are asking us to gamble on your server being successful, on players to prefer playing with a lower population compared to the thousands that are now playing on two really fresh servers.  You might put more effort on your server, have an all-around perfect scripting, but it would still be hard to look forward one/two/three months and say that you will still be there.  That said, it's not fair to compare a 1x leveling experience to an instant 60 one. There is a whole world between those.  If I had to level up with 1x rates on your server, sadly, I would not do that for the reasons I explained above. If the exp rate was more ""forgiving"", say 5x, I would. I might be lazy, but I value the free time I have.  I might sound rude, and I am sorry for that, but that's what I think.  With that said, best of luck. The private server scene always benefits from new, fresh blood.  EDIT: adding this as an afterthought: while it's commendable that you are opening more realms to cater to more kinds of players, it also ends up splitting both the players and the staff between the two. Even if you hire more staff and advertise more, there will always be one realm that gets the spotlight and one that will stay behind. I'd suggest to focus on only one ""ruleset"", one specific type of server, build a loyal community around it, then see how many among them would be interested in a new, different realm. Once you have a community, you can cater to them in the ways you deem right."

wowservers,37i827,conorbg,6,Wed May 27 20:44:25 2015 UTC,Vengeancewow is stationed in Canada.  If you live in NA the latency should be wonderful.  If you live in Western Europe the latency should still not be a problem and under 130ms.  I have been slowly leveling a toon on there for the last month(when time from my other projects permit it) and from what I have seen it is a notch above any of the other big ones in terms of questing and scripting.  I'm an excab fan but I know that excab isn't the best scripted.  From what I have seen Vengeancewow is the best scripted(of content released) TBC server out.  They have a small dev team but are consistent in bringing out content that is scripted in regular basis.  There is updates to their progress on their main page.  I believe they are currently working toward Karazhan being released as the first raid tier and that is the bulk of the work they are focusing on now.  As far as smoothness of character motions you shouldn't have a single problem.  It runs as smooth or better than Hellground's TBC.  Hope that helps.

Hope people actually read this and understand MoP servers really don't exist in a workable state and it is a disgrace to that expansion to try and play on them.  Come down an expansion and join Atlantiss then the server would be bustling like Nostalrius's vanilla server.  That my friends...would be epic.

wowservers,37h8a9,brukidm,1 point,Wed May 27 17:31:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good thing with Atlantiss is the fact they have already showed they can create good server (cata) and they can reuse 1-85 content, that's a lot (compared to Feenix which can reuse only 60-70 content).  What surprise me most is the fact Molten (Warmane) have some things from their cata to reuse on mop (well, quests on cata still sucks but at least dungeons and raids), but they don't do it..."
wowservers,37h8a9,Hyptu,0,Wed May 27 18:45:10 2015 UTC,"I think the level of scripting is not comparable to any servers which are frequently recommended here (Dalaran, Atlantiss, Nost/Kronos ...).    Yet I think if someone's curious for the new class/race in MoP it might be worth taking a look. But don't expect anywhere near blizzlike levels of scripts yet. Mobs are there, but they often don't do anything but auto attacks and quests are often either ""kill 20 x / collect 10 y"" or set on auto complete.  New players I'd advise to take a look at the servers of previous expansions first, they are much more refined overall while the MoP ones at the moment basically are only ""half a game"" or less. If you're a veteran player specifically looking for MoP content I think you might use them to kill some time until a decent MoP server comes around or they become better."

wowservers,37hswf,TheKall55,7,Wed May 27 19:05:27 2015 UTC,"I've played level 40s on both servers. Nostalrius is very, very difficult to level on because of the population. Not only is it hard to tag mobs, it's hard to survive the opposite faction because vanilla servers were never meant to have so many people in one zone at once.  Kronos is much less buggy, it feels more streamlined, but the population is close to 5x lower. That's good and bad. It's hard to find groups for some dungeons, particularly as a DPS, but it's so much easier to quest and much more bug free. If you roll tank or healer on Kronos, you'll have a great time."

wowservers,37hswf,notgunnahappen,3,Wed May 27 19:26:34 2015 UTC,"Having played on both, have a 60 on kronos and currently still leveling on nost (so I can't comment on its endgame) I'll try to be as balanced as I can.  PROS  Kronos: The server is exceptionally well scripted and I found it to have generally a better community. On the PvE side of things everything is great, even with the NA populaiton taking a huge hit with the recent bans it will likely recover enough for raiding.  Nostalrius: The population is huge, BGs are abundant even during the leveling brackets, the scripting is great even if it isn't on par with kronos.  CONS  Kronos: The population is basically in crisis, it's not only low, but it's dropping. A friend and I recently quit due to the low population causing a lack of BGs. They are virtually non existent during the leveling brackets now, and at max level only WSG pops and only during peak EU hours, even then I was waiting upwards of an hour horde side (alliance might have shorter ques.) AB never happens, ever, and at this rate I can't see AV happening when it's released either.  Nos: The population is as much a con as it is a pro. It's useful for BGs and dungeons, I have never been unable to find a group. But when questing it's a curse, constant competition. For kill quests it's less of an issue as you can group, but for drop quests it sucks. By far the biggest problem caused by the population is the systems they've put in place to deal with the load on the server, namely, the reduced server side draw distance. Normally a mob or player wont render until you're right next to them. This was alleged to be a temporary fix when the devs were asked about it (https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=45&t=4235&start=10) but here we see a fix promised ""within the coming weeks"" on a post that is over 2 months old."
wowservers,37hswf,Craptola,3,Wed May 27 22:07:50 2015 UTC,"Leveled at kronos 2 days ago at EU peaktimes... 230 people online and   I couldn't find anyone to help me with hogger. One has too many players, (but you can find dungs, group quests) but one has too few.  Nostalrius isn't that bad leveling though, but most big quests have a shitton of players doing them, try doing side quests. Like there are way less people in silverpine/loch modan than there are in westwood/barrens."
wowservers,37hswf,amwulf_,2,Thu May 28 12:44:45 2015 UTC,"I'm going to try and be as objective as possible but it's worth noting that I actively play on Kronos, and not Nostalrius. However, I did cap on Nostalrius before deciding to switch. With that in mind, I'll try to address all of your questions thoroughly.   The rates on Nostalrius are actually somewhat buffed for drop rates on quest items. The shimmering flat zone quests, for example, are completed easily comparatively to Kronos where you might find yourself struggling to get your last scorpid meat (or whatever it's called). Many of the random drop quests are very noticeably ""hard"" in the sense that it feels the way it used to in retail, but on Nost the drops are noticeably more forgiving. That being said, I have absolutely no proof of this in numbers, just experience, but it's worth noting that the Baron Rivendare mount and the Eye of Sulfuras and some bindings dropped in the first 2 weeks of people hitting 60. Many believe that to be a bit hard to believe that was left up to RNG, I personally think that something may be up with the drop algorithm somewhere, but like I said, I can't prove it, I only have my experience with the questing on the way to 60 and there is a very definitively noticeable difference in drop rates of rare items. World PvP does happen but with now a litany of 60s running around, depending on your faction, it's likely you'll spend more time getting ganked by a higher level who's seeking honor away from long BG queues. This is quite a loudly voiced issue on Nostalrius simply because of the population being so extremely over-crowded, but less so on Kronos (due to, obviously, a lower population). I can't speak to the current situation of lower level dungeons as I've yet to level an alt character since my first one, but I absolutely had no issue while leveling finding dungeons (but I was also part of the first wave). I can tell you that I often see groups for low level dungeons in world, but that's a pretty anecdotal claim so I'll just let you take that with a grain of salt. Kronos is lacking in NA players (especially compared to Nost), and we'd love to correct this, but don't be misled by the sentiment. I raid in <CORAL>, an NA region/time zone raiding guild and we have cleared all of t1 content (including Azuregos, though we've yet to land a kill on Kazzak due to horde spys), so there is definitely an active NA community. Many players from other regions play a lot on Kronos even during NA hours, so you will still see them on during that time window too. I no longer need 5 man dungeons but I can attest that although occasionally I had trouble finding a tank for my runs (lvl 60 dungeons)when my guildees weren't around, I still managed to get my full pre-raid BIS without too much hassle (and I primarily only play during the NA peak window). Just got to make friends, and be a good person, and people will group with you regularly, which is what the vanilla experience was about. Kronos is sort of in a situation where you have to test yourself. Can you make friends/allies/contacts for the dungeons/profession needs you require? If that's not a thing you desire to do, Nost is probably a better pick as they will serve you up a silver platter of players simply by asking in world once, basically akin to the dungeon finder. There are so many people on that realm that you generally don't have to spend any time getting to know anyone to get anything done, but this may not be so on Kronos. You'll become close with people you level/quest/run dungeons with and you'll see them often all the way up. I was running 60 dungeons with some of the same people that I ran stockades with when I hit 60, it was a pretty cool and surreal experience. Ultimately if population is your main, most important factor in making the decision, Nostalrius is clearly the winner, and asking for advice would seem sort of an empty request in that regard because it's pretty well known that Nost as numbers. All I can do is tell you the reason that I left Nost for Kronos...the experience was not Blizz-like in the most important way : the community. The population is simply too large, that it essentially felt like a strange ""scenario"" server, like if Blizzard way back in the day had said ""Let's see what happens if we put WAY too many people in a server meant for a 4th/fraction of that amount of people and see what happens"". Like it's some kind of weird experiment. At 60, Arathi Basin will pop if you form a raid for it. The PvP-focused players are a bit more numerous on horde side, so they tend to always be queued in all of them, it's really the alliance side that is still sort of beginning to put their PvP shoes on and actually get in queue (remember, the realm is still super new, lot of people still not even 60 yet). I know this from experience as I queue'd AB pretty much all morning today with my pre-made. I very commonly see 2-4 Warsong Gulchs running at lvl 60, but I'd highly recommend getting to know some of the better pvpers on alliance side (if you are alliance) instead of solo queueing because your experience will likely be better. We have a pretty good time steam rolling pugs, and an even better time swinging the flag back and forth against the more well-known horde premades. If 60 BGs are something that's important to you, definitely do not worry there, again, as long as you're able to be friendly and you aren't too vindicated on queueing solo all the time.   Kronos to me is way more similar to my real, retail vanilla experience, and I even played on a pretty medium - low pop realm back then, and I can say from that experience that I wouldn't take back my choice to switch no matter what, because the nostalgia has been so much more real since rolling here.  So that is my personal experience and my personal reasons for enjoying Kronos more, but I will not end this post without clarifying that...hell some people just like to see tons of damn people everywhere they go in an MMO and that's all that matters. I felt the same way when I started on Nost, but it didn't take long for me to realize that wasn't exactly what I was looking for in a back-to-vanilla experience, I had essentially missed the point of what really made vanilla, vanilla to me. I was blinded by the excess amount of people, but then I realized...I only care about my guild, who I'm raiding with, who I personally meet and play with, so seeing a ton of people taking up space everywhere was actually not as important to me as I thought. I found all of that on Kronos, so that's where I'll stay.  Good luck in your travels, whichever you decide to pick, my friend, whatever you do, pack it in, because the leveling is gonna be a doozy!~  <CORAL> will be doing our weekly full MC clear tomorrow during NA prime-time hours if you wanna get an idea of the raid scripting for Ragnaros or any of the other bosses. You can hang out, chill with me as I raid and tell terrible jokes, and get a feel if maybe even we could be the right guild for you in the end. Don't be pressured, just swing by if you're curious! I also stream now a lot when I'm in premade PvP, so if you wanna watch me backstab poor clothies with perditions blade, you can do that too!  http://www.twitch.tv/zipzo62"

wowservers,37fmk7,dungeonjay,-1,Wed May 27 17:02:34 2015 UTC,"enjoying   What is to enjoy in a vanilla server anyway? After playing some later expansions, the only thing about vanilla you're going to actually enjoy is your memory of it. (that is, if you actually played vanilla, most of the ""vanilla was the best & hardest"" crowd didn't) Game was objectively worse, and let me quote https://izco.wordpress.com/viable-specs-in-wows-history/ here :   Vanilla: 8-9 specs reliably viable. Burning Crusade:  11-13 specs reliably viable. Lich King: 23-26 specs reliably viable.   The game didnât get easier. The game got better.  And yes, I know people have different tastes, and a lot of people have really enjoyed vanilla (me included), but for the love of god there was nothing really 'hard' in vanilla. Everything was extremely time-consuming, that is all. If anything, the actual gameplay was easier because there wasn't even a half of mechanical depth we have today."

wowservers,37fmk7,anarchism4thewin,0,Wed May 27 20:29:00 2015 UTC,"And? Doesn't change my point in any way. Vanilla was just time-consuming. It will take you longer to kill a mob or properly pull a group of mobs with crowd control so you won't die horribly. In the end it's just grinding you will steamroll through anyway sooner or later. What I'm talking about is the endgame. Con fucking gratys, you put much more effort than you would on some later expansion. Enjoy levelling your toon and gearing it up on a vanilla server you're currently playing on. Once you reach max level you will see my point stands true. Majority of vanilla endgame content lacks mechanics, and is mostly a tank and spank with a twist. Those fights might be difficult because you need gear for that. Where do you get this gear you might ask? In other dungeons or raids which are very similar in construction - simple fight, needs numbers. Oh and needs gear too. There was a reason why blizzard almost completely revamped 1-60 content in cataclysm. It was way below standards set by wotlk and tbc.  I'll give you that, vanilla was not easy. But it wasn't because it was difficult. It was just time consuming and nearly all meaningful content was poorly designed. I'd rather have a short but fun levelling process and engaging endgame over a boring endgame preceded by mindless grindfest. http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4796800840 - read this up, this sums it up pretty well. I had a lot of fun during vanilla but it was mostly due to community and the 'fresh game' feeling. Not because of the game. The game was pretty bad"
wowservers,37fmk7,aneq,0,Wed May 27 21:12:43 2015 UTC,I had a lot of fun during vanilla but it was mostly due to community Not trying to context out of everything you said but I think this is the pivotal point being engaged here.  Private servers don't have cross-realm ques.  We know the playerbase.  We are familiar with each other.  That is what playing on these servers brings back that wow has lost.  I'm not speaking of mechanics or how hard a game is but that feeling you had of being part of a community inside a game.  Retail has lost that and no taking away flying or revamping will bring that back until they go back to the root of the problem and that is cross-realm integration.  It brings back a social aspect that the game was driven by and gained fandom for.

wowservers,37dhqa,periphery3,1 point,Wed May 27 05:00:46 2015 UTC,"Any information about your guild guys? How long are you planning to raid in naxx, do you have any plan? There is already one guild who cleared naxx in first week and already moved to ulduar. Also what is your raid time?"
wowservers,37dhqa,ranraf,1 point,Wed May 27 05:18:28 2015 UTC,Shartacus.shivtr.com is our corecraft site with a gamers district section if you'd like to check it out. We don't know everything just yet but we aren't going to just clear naxx once and move on. We cleared naxx 10 twice on a server called Kingsbourne and then it closed after less than 3 weeks of up time. But Thorix or Sargy in the guild would be the ones running the raids
wowservers,37dhqa,periphery3,1 point,Wed May 27 15:24:49 2015 UTC,Also if you aren't a shaman that would be great. Seems to be a lot of them on this server

wowservers,37dhqa,Cskato,1 point,Wed May 27 10:49:03 2015 UTC,"Thorix, Sargy or Hendo."
wowservers,37dhqa,periphery3,3,Wed May 27 15:25:15 2015 UTC,"There are a couple guilds on either faction that do ""scaled raiding"" with that ilevel gear.  I believe there is only two.  I think Dodgy mentioned one of the guilds in his video.  I'll pull that out of the shoe closet for you to investigate on. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6YjmA7nMBQ    Otherwise, if you want a more gear appropriate to raiding server I recommend Dalaran."
wowservers,37dhqa,dungeonjay,2,Tue May 26 21:04:08 2015 UTC,"Pug based, not really. However, there's always a chance to find a guild that helps their new members get some gear.  World chat only does ICC and VoA, asking for 5.2k gs."
wowservers,37dhqa,brukidm,1 point,Tue May 26 21:09:14 2015 UTC,"I just loaded up this server and was pleased with the scripting and the population.  Apparently they are pretty even faction wise, though allegedly Alliance has slightly more.  I like that it's 7x but you can downscale it.  I'll likely use that feature when I get to my favorite zones so I don't outlevel them and can actually enjoy the old stories.  Dalaran-WoW is a very nice server, but the population is a bit lower, which is probably due to the 1x true Blizzlike experience.  I seem to find that true Blizzlike servers seem to be more popular if they are Vanilla or TBC content."
wowservers,37e1zl,everettham,4,Tue May 26 23:12:07 2015 UTC,"You can buy anything (aside from pvp gear) on Feenix's servers. However, things are EXTREMELY expensive. Glaives are 700 euro (for 1, 1400 for both). End-Tier items are around 75-200 euro for 1 piece (some even costing more).  As with any Feenix server, there will be the rare donator with 1 or 2 items, but it won't be anything close to P2W servers such as Molten. It won't even be noticeable.   Although, shop items probably won't even be able to be purchased for awhile after release."
wowservers,37e1zl,pikunul,2,Wed May 27 00:15:59 2015 UTC,"Feenix donation isnt cheap at all :D I just downloaded MoP yday and logged on warmane to test if everything is working ok. Around me there was 4-5 ppl in Belf starting area, all with PVP gear from donation. Which rly can turn ppl off from their server. I even made a SS of this."
wowservers,37e1zl,Nuber132,2,Wed May 27 04:29:20 2015 UTC,"Feenix never sells gear of inaccessible content and waits for players to progress to the level of content before making it available through donations. Like others have said: the prices for the best high-end content gear is ridiculously high (700-800 euros per piece at the moment I believe, don't know for certain though), making it only available for a few people while others have already acquired it through raiding. So you cannot access any gear through donations alone and the items that make a 'real difference' will be rarely bought. < Like this on all their servers besides Emerald Dream (only faction and race change available, 50 euro per)."

wowservers,37e1zl,tehosiris,0,Wed May 27 11:46:56 2015 UTC,"i read that a long time ago. I played on feenix too since opening of Warsong (noone was 60 yet). I made a lot of friends and had fun too. There was no donations for 2-3 years. Got banned once for lets say hacking, 5 times in forums (last time was ingame ban because i got banned 3 times for 1 month), but i still like their servers as not something impresive but not that bad too.

wowservers,37e1zl,Nuber132,0,Wed May 27 13:05:38 2015 UTC,"Judging from your posts, you appear to have a short temperament. I understand that you will have a difficult time finding any private server that can meet your demands and toxicity. :(  I believe that your manner of downgrading free development projects without providing any real arguments shows a lack of respect and I see myself fortunate that you will not be part of my gaming experience. Good luck and I hope that the community from your preferred servers can see you from a better side though! :o)"
wowservers,37e1zl,charizardpok,0,Wed May 27 13:50:56 2015 UTC,"I did not play on the same Feenix as you I suppose? :p I found my vanilla Feenix experience pretty enjoyable tbh. Nost, VG, and Kronos are the only other available private servers that I believe are of a comparable script quality but they have not shown their later content release yet so I prefer to refrain from comparisons tbh. The 'Feenix has been out for longer and thus should be superior'-argument isn't really relevant as the other projects (claim to) have been in development for a few years as well. All 4 projects are doing an astonishing job with their vanilla servers!"
wowservers,37e1zl,charizardpok,0,Wed May 27 13:38:31 2015 UTC,"An answer to all your remarks:   You will not get censored if you do not violate their ToS. I believe their set of rules are fine: http://www.wow-one.com/forum/6-terms-of-service/ . Only thing I am 'meh' about is their stance against mentioning other projects. There is an item shop available on their homepage under 'Gift shop' after being logged in covering all purchasable items besides a select few that can only be bought at ridiculous amounts (like the legendaries at 700-800 euros) but then again you can request information about them and they will answer you swiftly. Compared to most other projects, Feenix' prices are very high rendering it inaccessible for most and their x1 server is donationgearfree, which people can choose to play on if they do not like donatable gear at all. You can only use donation points to race/faction change on ED (x1 Feenix' vanilla server).  They do not treat bug abuse/hacking lightly as can be seen on their staff assistance page: http://www.wow-one.com/forum/127-staff-assistance/ Development is ok tbh, I understand people would love a working chess event but afaik, the only private server that got it fully working is corecraft that is not even released yet. You can see that their development goes at a steady pace here: http://www.wow-one.com/forum/32-1121-changelogs/ and http://www.wow-one.com/forum/110-243-changelogs/   The link you provided does not provide any questionable content?

wowservers,37e1zl,tehosiris,1 point,Wed May 27 17:01:12 2015 UTC,"I've had a look at their forums yesterday and I have to say that their rules sound a bit strange to me.  You will get rewarded if you ""burn"" ""salty players"" who are saying something against the server?  Â    We are declaring a war on salty players. Community is allowed to be dedicated to their cause, as long as it does not damage the nice community and atmosphere.  Considering the new - lenient and easy-going GM support, players are encouraged to flame, troll and burn any other salty player. Any player making a screenshot/video of a great ""burn"" will be rewarded based on their contribution (Small visual gifts - RP and rare mount rewards)  Salty player examples:    Players who complain/whine after losing a pvp or pve battle. Feenix server has to be taken as-is, the whole server is exactly same for everyone, most things work. Players who degrade server due to a loss/boredom. Attention seekers are welcome to join the night's watch. Or burn. God syndrome - players who believe that are better than everyone else. While in most cases they plainly suck, complaining about anything - even godlike players shall not be salty. Burn them! Advertising players - it is extremely easy to prove that our realms are better than any other, don't provoke a discussion - burn them for what they are.    Whining - this is not retail, yet, the best working realms available. Degrading - it is also aimed at you, implying that players who stay are stupid. Defend yourselves. Godlike - plainly not nice people seeking attention.

As far as I know they're the only server which has every 5man dungeon and all raids (besides Sunwell and Dragonsoul -> Firelands being on the PTR right now) scripted (not only some mobs doing auto attacks, but a pretty close resemblance to the original scripts).  Leveling up whith dungeons was fun - as a european I had nearly instant invites as a tank/healer and 5-15 minute queues as a dps. At NA times it will be harder to find dungeon groups while leveling, I guess, but at end game there are at least 2 NA guilds alliance side (and surely there will also be horde guilds) which are raiding at NA times and I think they're also recruiting."

wowservers,37dbzh,proteinbarskek,3,Tue May 26 20:12:51 2015 UTC,"People are happier to work for the sake of a project if they can get something out of it, however small this ""something"" might be. In other words, people are less motivated to do something that requires skill and patience for nothing in return.  Then again, it's all up to the single developer. Some do it simply because they like doing it, and if they are also playing on the server, some in-game prizes would be enough to satisfy them. Then there are those that would not move a finger without getting paid for it.  If a server is taking in money from donation, those should be split among hosting expenses and developer/gm payments, in appropriate measure.  If a server makes a principle out of not taking money from players, then they would have an easier time finding people to develop for them for free. Quality depends on the single developer's skills and strength of will."
wowservers,37dbzh,Heyharrer,2,Tue May 26 20:36:27 2015 UTC,"But the devs etc. are not paid like for a full-time job anywhere on the private server scene, or am I wrong? More like pocket money from parents. (well maybe Warmane can pay some core developer heavy cash, but other projects? hardly the case)  What is your thought on that?"
wowservers,37dbzh,Suntys,1 point,Tue May 26 21:33:59 2015 UTC,"I believe a great part of people donating to private servers do so with pocket money from parents, so that's what a server would mainly get by. Considering general hosting expenses and some buffer for unforeseen happenings, there's not a lot left.  But still, the amount of time your usual dev spends on developing is hardly comparable to even a part-time job. Unless the dev really enjoys what he is doing, and even then it's his own choice.  Doubt anyone can afford to make a living out of developing for private servers :) it's more like earning some few, fast and easy (assuming a dev can easily do what he does) money for himself. It's the same reason as to why artists get money from drawing commissions. Or many other things... you get what I mean, I guess."
wowservers,37dbzh,Heyharrer,1 point,Tue May 26 21:41:29 2015 UTC,I think it's the opposite. A great part of people donating to private servers are older and have their own income sources. Many of the pay to win servers have expensive items. The servers that don't have any pay to win definitely get most donations from older players.
wowservers,37dbzh,KnaxxLive,1 point,Wed May 27 13:05:07 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Gamer District has a nice payroll going on their small staff even though it is flagged under something to do while I'm going through college.  Excalibur definately has paid positions but how much I really can't say.  Kronos is a paid position server.  I mean, when I say paid I can't elaborate but some of these servers the dev team is making some nice bank even as a side-job that they may only spend 10-12 hours a week working on."
wowservers,37dbzh,dungeonjay,3,Tue May 26 21:37:01 2015 UTC,"I can understand you may think that it would only take 10-12 hours a week to develop. But I can guarantee you any successful server has developers who probably spend closer to 30-40 hours a week on it, as if it's a full time job. To some people, like myself, developing is our free time and is just fun. It is almost impossible to get enough work done in 10-12 hours a week if you want to make significant changes the way Kronos and Nost do. They absolutely have a staff combining over 100 hours a week on the server.  You'll always have some people who actually need the money, and therefore will ask to be paid. Then you'll have the people who are cocky and will only help people if they're paid because they don't want to share their knowledge. Then there's people like me (and many others), who just want to build something for fun."

But I have a bit of free time nowadays (that's why I can try to get back into wow :P) so I don't mind adjusting my play times to when they peak.  It's a 1x server, and I know those are traditionally more PVE oriented. But I've played on other 1x servers and still had fun with the PVP. That's why I thought I'd ask here first, just to see if the PVP on Atlantiss is completely dead or not."

I've talked about servers I've played on retail. They don't care, they know people play them, just don't make a ticket about it, advertise one, or talk about it in trade chat on retail.   Also don't use the same information you use for retail, because shady devs/owners may use your information against you to get your WoW account. Rare, but possible. I also suspect some private servers will send you those fake e-mails about changing your retail password, after some testing I did with a throwaway e-mail account."

wowservers,379ngp,Bestesbulzibar,-1,Wed May 27 17:06:08 2015 UTC,So its not only 0.5 - 10 seconds delay? the drawdistance is like 20yards?
wowservers,379ngp,alexhjelm,1 point,Wed May 27 23:33:05 2015 UTC,Yup the draw distance for mobs and other players is abysmal. It got so distracting by it couldn't even level my character beyond lvl 5.

Now look at Kronos twinhead and then at at Nost bugtracker and see the huge difference. Make your own opinion.  I donÂ´t care much about armory/forum/etc. but healthy,organised,easy to use bugtracker is the top thing a project should have."
wowservers,379ngp,Suntys,5,Tue May 26 02:00:28 2015 UTC,"Nost bug tracker is hard to use (comparatively to kronos' or simple just posting on the forum[which gets ignored]),  but for some reason I don't think their devs care.  Nost bug tracker also has a waiting time to be approved to post on it... most people probably give up waiting and just don't post their bug.  As far as Kronos vs Nost... Kronos' population is too low, and I think that hurts more than a high pop. I got bored on Kronos always soloing, not getting dungeons, as I leveled. Then there was this whole incident where an entire guild got banned. Half those people didn't deserve bans, and didn't even want to join that guild, but being US time zone they had no other real choice."
wowservers,379ngp,Miv333,3,Tue May 26 14:23:31 2015 UTC,"It's important to remember when talking about Kronos's population that if you're US time zone, your observation of population will be heavily skewed. It's true that Kronos lacks a robust NA population but EU-wise saying the population is ""too low"" couldn't be further from the truth.  What we need is balance, good cycle of players from all regions on both realms."
wowservers,379ngp,Suntys,4,Tue May 26 15:57:34 2015 UTC,"Compare it to Atlantiss.eu ...  Atlantiss.eu is promoted heavily and praised beyond belief here on reddit and nobody is saying ""yeah they are going down/the pop is bad"" with their 400 US peaks and 1000+ EU peaks.  So why would you say something like that about any other server? ... seems biased to me."
wowservers,379ngp,wowserver,1 point,Tue May 26 16:21:03 2015 UTC,"Well I don't know anything about Atlantis nor have I seen anyone talk about it here so I'm unable to comment to your references, all I can say is that when I play during EU hours it's quite bustling. My words are slightly anecdotal but you could probably get a census running person to tell you the same."
wowservers,379ngp,Suntys,-4,Tue May 26 21:58:42 2015 UTC,I'm confused do you prefer using a Bugtracker or play the game?
wowservers,379ngp,proteinbarskek,5,Tue May 26 18:06:14 2015 UTC,"I believe his point was, because kronos' tracker is better and more active, the kronos playerbase cares more for a polished experience, while nost players are content with a broken game because population."
wowservers,379ngp,alexhjelm,3,Tue May 26 18:49:56 2015 UTC,"Of course not :)  But for me personally, it is the biggest part of the project apart from the game itself."
wowservers,379ngp,triplewub,12,Tue May 26 19:02:04 2015 UTC,this is an example of a good advertisement for Kronos. Not posts from fanboys like Alexjhelm.

wowservers,379ngp,Somnu,2,Wed May 27 00:08:37 2015 UTC,"Actually, I am doing this on my own free will. I was never asked by Kronos Team at all. I just enjoy dealing with people. I am sorry that you have a negative outlook on this as I don't feel like I have done anything rude or mean to anyone. : /. However, If you play on Kronos feel free to send me a pm or a ticket to discuss why you happen to be upset on this matter. If you play on Nost that is fine as well I am just happy everyone here has similar interest in the vanilla community. I am not here to steal players, I am only here to help put the word out to try ours. I wish you guys luck on Nost as well for recruiting.  /u/triplewub  <3 Gurky"
wowservers,379ngp,Somnu,0,Wed May 27 02:12:24 2015 UTC,Personally I think Nostalrius is a cesspool which contains the worst community.  The problem? Moderators are way too lenient and treat trolls and racists with respect. Pathetic Admin to community relationship on Nost really.   I'm genuinely sure Kronos is better but for me personally I don't have the time for Vanilla or WoW in general.

And we all know the drama involving dodgeykebab being payed by kronos/feenix to turn a blind-eye to all the bugs at kronos launch and not show/mention them in his video review.  Now, on thread - Yes people should start on kronos since nostalrius peaked 8k players last night and it was really stable, but I doubt they can keep it up like this for much longer. So a bit of balance would benefit both servers."
wowservers,379ngp,only777,7,Tue May 26 10:52:22 2015 UTC,"1) I have no alt accounts on reddit.  2) there never was a shit storm over payments that never happened to pay for a review that was pretty much as positive as nostrils.  The only people that said this are the fucking bellends like you who go full retard when someone says something nice about a rival product.  3) well done for showing people how neurotic you really are, by accusing someone of being me because they said something nice about Kronos.  My advise to you is to stop going full retard.  If you see someone saying something nice about Kronos.  It's probably best to not comment in the thread because chances are, you'll say something that makes you look madder than mad jock McMad from Mad castle.   Dodgykebaab"
wowservers,379ngp,Somnu,-10,Tue May 26 06:29:14 2015 UTC,"Mate you have been fucked with so hard it's not even funny. Did you even read my post ? I encourage people to go play on Kronos, I believe it's the best choice atm for new players. With that being said it's only fair to maintain a neutral standpoint and be objective about both servers, something you failed to deliver in your most recent review.  I actually used to enjoy watching your video reviews until I saw the kind of spastic kid you were from your posts on reddit, especially on the threads about kronos vs nost. How you got so worked up about them is beyond me. Maybe in a few years you'll grow out of this phase, but for now let's leave it at that."

Your just pretending to take the high road in this thread because you've been called out so many times for the rubbish you post.  I don't care that now you want to bitch at me for jumping on your post.  When you try to spread your bullshit lies about paid reviews, you damn right in gonna come after you.  the nostrils team shut your thread down on their forum when you started talking your lies on there, so you take to here to start your crazy tin foil hat ideas."

wowservers,379ngp,lindz444,3,Tue May 26 18:11:27 2015 UTC,There seems to be enough population on the 2 popular vanilla servers to fill up a couple more servers... Might even fill up kronos
wowservers,379ngp,username123454,3,Tue May 26 09:55:54 2015 UTC,"While I'd love to play on Kronos over Nost, as a PST player, I just don't feel it is at all feasible. With 100~ alliance players on during PST prime time, there would need an influx of several hundred before the server is even an option.  I am tired of the lag on Nost and camping mobs to complete quests, but at least I can find a group."
wowservers,379ngp,Struckd,2,Tue May 26 06:18:38 2015 UTC,"I think a guild or two committing to making the flip (or rather even a number of newly planned guilds with members rolling anew) would be a decent start to fleshing out the NA hours. A couple hundred people is literally just a couple of guilds. Sadly it's a bit of a snowball effect, low numbers at US times makes US players roll Nost, and thus the problem doesn't edge closer to being resolved but rather stagnates for Kronos, and gets worse for big N.  In the mean time Nost inches closer and closer to instability. How many people before it's too many for you? Then when you quit I imagine you just quit period without trying Kronos...it's such an unfortunate cycle."
wowservers,379ngp,Mephea,1 point,Tue May 26 15:37:55 2015 UTC,"Instance servers don't have the same problem as world servers so raiding guilds don't have to deal with the same lag as those leveling up in the open world. Guilds have no incentive to move servers.  Maybe Kronos should open up server transfers for a certain amount of time. Or maybe if Nost implemented queues to limit the number online (though they seem pretty happy having 8k people on and terrible lag).  It is a snowball effect, I agree. But it is REALLY hard to stop the snowball from gaining momentum."
wowservers,379ngp,c0keh,1 point,Tue May 26 16:00:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is hard to stop the snowball effect. You'd have to do something drastic like ban all your horde NA 60s... oh wait Kronos already did that."
wowservers,379ngp,proteinbarskek,0,Tue May 26 16:18:32 2015 UTC,"a 2 week ban for exploitation. Sure a bit drastic, but at least they are clear at where they stand. I am happy to see they don't put aside their morales for the sake of population"
wowservers,379ngp,Struckd,4,Thu May 28 17:52:42 2015 UTC,"Great and very thorough post and I hope a lot of people take the time to read it. Reading biased posts about either Kronos or Nost is getting tiresome so this was a nice change from that.   I play on both server's as well, and though I haven't reach 60 yet (I'm getting close!) I find myself playing less and less on Nost due to the population.   Yesterday I logged on when there was, strangely enough, exactly 8000 people online just to send a quick mail to a guildie. It only contained text, and it took close to 10 seconds for the mail to be sent after I clicked ""send"". My own buffs seemed to work without delay, but I can understand where all those complaints about the delays are coming from."
wowservers,379ngp,Bifpride,3,Tue Jun 2 10:22:44 2015 UTC,"sometimes it takes 5 minutes to send a mail (with an item). especially when you're trading things to banking-chars, this is very very annoying... but the high pop hype is making everyone quite dizzy atm so nobody cares."
wowservers,379ngp,biffsteken,3,Tue May 26 07:07:30 2015 UTC,its a fucking snowball effect... that's amazing and stupid simulatenously. I never thought Id be annoyed by high population
wowservers,379ngp,alexhjelm,4,Tue May 26 09:43:00 2015 UTC,"Fantastically written. Well done.  Two quality vanilla servers can only benefit the vanilla community as a whole. As you rightly said...we aren't a single server community, but a vanilla community"
wowservers,379ngp,GMGurky,6,Tue May 26 16:10:16 2015 UTC,The shitty bug tracker and no database is a major drawback of nostalrius for me.
wowservers,379ngp,Kroztonic,-2,Tue May 26 14:05:47 2015 UTC,"But now the flaming begins again, this subreddit is known to have a really extreme feel for Kronos compared to Nostalrius.   But how can a bug tracker be your biggest drawback for Nostalrius? The bug tracker works but it is not flawless, but isn't the GAME the biggest thing to look for when searching for a server?   Nostalrius and Kronos are very close to eachother as scripting goes, but as OP says, the population are causing issues.   I'm not disagreeing that people should consider joining Kronos instead of Nostalrius at the moment, but the drawback that you are explaining are so insignificant (in my opinion)."
wowservers,379ngp,HKoolaid,3,Tue May 26 05:53:37 2015 UTC,"You can see this, https://report.nostalrius.org/plugins/tracker/?group_id=101  Nos has done ( 692 open / 940 total ) - 248 fixes since they launched the tracker at 2015-03-21  In the same time Kronos have had 990 reports that is correct and they have fixed 321 of them.  Kronos have had 5116 reports on vanilla since they opened the tracker and have 2964 fixed issues of them.  I would guess Kronos has alot of small issues reported in these 5116 reports that not even anyone would care of on other servers but to see that Nos only have 900 reports would say there is atleast 6k more bugs on the server no one have even reported.  More bug reports = more fixes = better server."
wowservers,379ngp,Mephea,3,Tue May 26 22:03:12 2015 UTC,One of the best posts I have seen! I wish everyone luck on what ever server you play on! I hope to see you in game soon! Enjoy your Vanilla Adventure! GM Gurky <3
wowservers,379ngp,biffsteken,3,Tue May 26 23:05:32 2015 UTC,Very awesome read there zip! Hopefully this will bring some numbers. Unfortunately I haven't had much motivation to play on Kronos recently except for raids. Also I don't like vanilla druid much but have put so much time into the toon that it seems wasteful not to play.
wowservers,379ngp,HKoolaid,5,Tue May 26 03:17:08 2015 UTC,"Despite the fact that my guild is on Nostalrius and has no plans to move, I would never consider moving to Kronos unless cross faction mounts are removed entirely from the game and from every person who acquired one. This kind of thing destroys immersion and screams out that you are on a private server. The one thing that Nost does much better than Kronos is to truly act like vanilla with as few corners cut as possible."
wowservers,379ngp,HKoolaid,2,Tue May 26 14:14:45 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you when it comes to the mounts, but I've said this before, and I still think that it's true, that the only difference between those 2 servers when it comes to being as much blizzlike as possible, is the fact that Kronos has changed certain things to be less blizzlike (such as those mounts, though afaik it was a mistake), whilst Nost hasn't fixed certain things to be more blizzlike.   Considering EVERYTHING I don't think one server is more blizzlike than the other."
wowservers,379ngp,hizOdge,2,Tue May 26 20:12:36 2015 UTC,"whilst Nost hasn't fixed certain things to be more blizzlike.   That's a very vague argument, everything isn't perfect on every server, but what have they been ignoring/not done yet? Any examples?"
wowservers,379ngp,HKoolaid,-2,Tue May 26 21:19:20 2015 UTC,"Sure I'll agree with you there. But I think people are forgetting a key point. Both servers are brand new.  I will say that Kronos is at a higher level of polish than Nost right now but will that always be the case? The nost team is as busy as the kronos team at releasing fixes and content. Maybe some would say that nost is dragging, especially with content. I would agree but I would bet that the population has really forced them to change their agendas from content to optimization. Once that can get a little better then they can come back to content.  All in all it boils down for me to hope for better quality to come around with nost than to go with a known entity of planning to be different in key areas. One can change, the other can't."
wowservers,379ngp,username123454,4,Tue May 26 22:14:31 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree with you on the cross-faction mount debacle.  In this case, the system was actually exploited to obtain them (not maliciously, it just didn't stop the people from acquiring them that way), and it wasn't originally intended to allow it, but I've made several cases for why this is a bad thing for Kronos.  The argument is for how slight or severe that effect is, however, and it's worth pointing out that my immersion hasn't really been affected by the availability of this improperly utilized function. Not very man people donate in the first place, and when you see it more or less just makes it easy for you to spot someone who supports the server.  I will try to raise more points in the thread on the matter, and I may even use your comment above, if that's OK?"

Pretty much everything that makes vanilla wow what it is. I am excited to be able to get back to 1.12 itemization, however I am glad that the team took the time to quirkily relive how vanilla felt.  Some things ruin immersion for you. Others ruin it for me. You aren't wrong when you don't like something, but neither am I. And you can't list a set of differences and somehow have it come out that factually one is worse than another."
wowservers,379ngp,Raijs,-1,Tue May 26 22:45:41 2015 UTC,Dude he didn't say you were wrong for liking it. He said you were wrong for saying Nost acts like vanilla much better than Kronos. It is literally the opposite of that per what hizOdge said.
wowservers,379ngp,c0keh,0,Tue May 26 23:15:37 2015 UTC,Umm that's what I was getting at. Blizzlike has a very different meaning to different people. You can't say how much more or less something is blizzlike as if there is a scorecard. -10 blizzlike points for respec cap change. - 20 blizzlike points for cross faction mounts. Ooh -50 points for 1.4 itemization! You think Kronos is more blizzlike? Great. I disagree. How can I? Maybe because the things that is different with Kronos matters more to me than what is different with Nost.
wowservers,379ngp,material_methods,4,Thu May 28 17:48:52 2015 UTC,"It's a shame to leave out Rebirth as an option, it really is a great server and it'd be awesome to raise the population. Especially since Nost is getting ridiculous, I tried to level there recently but had to stop, the combat lag and fighting for respawns was just not enjoyable."
wowservers,379ngp,material_methods,1 point,Fri May 29 18:45:23 2015 UTC,"I think that if Kronos wants an influx of people, they need to open up for the possibility of transfering your characters from N to K. Most people don't find it particularly fun to grind gold, levels and recipes all over again. I'd rather just quit playing all together than to level yet another character to sixty on yet another server (been too many in the past years)."
wowservers,379ngp,material_methods,1 point,Wed May 27 10:08:47 2015 UTC,The only reason I'm not switching to Kronos (I found Nostalrius first) is because I leveled to 26 as a Warrior. And the first few levels was hell and I've put much time into it so i dont really feel like rerolling =/  And leveling in vanilla takes ages.
wowservers,379ngp,material_methods,5,Mon Jun 1 07:08:21 2015 UTC,"tho its much smoother (-> easier) on kronos. less players, less lag (and less bugs) are shortening the levelling time."
wowservers,379ngp,Struckd,-1,Tue May 26 11:43:11 2015 UTC,"Sorry but the pay-to-win shop on Kronos is the breaking point for me. It's obvious that this is a no-go for a lot of other people too, since Nost is so much more populated.  The difference between Nost and all the other vanilla servers is the cash shop.  People will downvote but numbers do not lie: Nost is winning and will always win because people that play vanilla wow servers want to get away from the pay to win real money auction houses."
wowservers,379ngp,raptorak,6,Tue May 26 20:07:20 2015 UTC,"First of all, this isn't a competition, nor have I made any claims that Kronos somehow has more people than Nostalrius. It's a certified fact that Nostalrius is overcrowded, and Kronos is undercrowded. Everybody already knows that.  Second of all...pay-to-win shop on Kronos? No such thing exists! If blatant lies and falsehoods like this are the reason ""a lot of other people"" are refusing to rely on Kronos as a viable 2nd server than there's a lot of misunderstanding that needs to be cleaned up! Either that or you should maybe do a bit more research before you say such foolish things."
wowservers,379ngp,GMGurky,-2,Mon Jun 1 23:38:45 2015 UTC,"I can pay to have an unfair advantage in leveling a character. Sorry but that is a pay-to-win cash shop.   The population doesn't lie: people see through the 'kronos is just a player auction house, not pay-to-win' facade and would rather play on Nost.   Trust me, I wish this wasn't the case and that Kronos did not have a pay to win shop, because I would probably be there right now. However, the cash shop is just completely against what vanilla wow is all about."
wowservers,379ngp,raptorak,4,Tue Jun 2 08:30:30 2015 UTC,"Um, Nost has people buying/selling accounts too. Retail WoW has always had that. I just don't see the validity in your argument...simply hypocrisy..."
wowservers,379ngp,raptorak,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:30:48 2015 UTC,"Retail WoW never had a built in character auction house. There were websites that did it, sure, but the actions were never sanctioned by Blizzard.  Why else has Nost gone up to 8k from 6k at launch, even after the release of Kronos? People do not associate cash auction houses with the vanilla experience. The cash shop is the #1 difference between the two servers and people have chosen"
wowservers,379ngp,GMGurky,4,Tue Jun 2 14:49:28 2015 UTC,"Blizzard doesn't sanction private servers either, so the argument of whether Blizzard sanctioned it or not is irrelevant because if that mattered that much to you, you wouldn't be on a private server in the first place.  Nost is populated because they released first. Nearly a month early the day Kronos announced they were coming out in a month.  One could say it was a strong tactic, nobody is claiming that they don't have the lions share of the players but the difference in quality between the two is obvious to someone who has played extensively on both."
wowservers,379ngp,notbad112,-2,Tue Jun 2 17:57:04 2015 UTC,"Nost is populated because they released first. Nearly a month early the day Kronos announced they were coming out in a month.   Nost coming out first explains the first surge of players, but it doesn't explain every vanilla player that has played Nost over Kronos after Kronos has come out. Why is Nost surging to 9k while Kronos is stagnant?  Kronos has better scripting, less crashing, a more responsive dev team, faster patches, and a company running the thing that has been around for a while. The only thing Nost has going in its favor is no cash shop  Vanilla WoW has no cash shop. Any server that has a cash shop is a fundamentally ""non vanilla"" experience. People want that classic WoW feeling again"
wowservers,379ngp,biffsteken,4,Wed Jun 3 14:06:56 2015 UTC,"The population they possessed due to that first surge of players, obviously.  People generally pick based on population alone, sure sometimes there are other factors but in basically most cases, people just pick which place is more poppin'. It's a snowball effect, Nost took a huge amount of waiting players, and as a result many future players chose Nost, and as a result, future players continue to choose Nost.  People want a big population. Saying that the only reason Nost continues to grow (to the disadvantage of Nost itself) is not having a donation system (which they do, they just don't give anything for it) is dimwitted and shortsighted."
wowservers,379ngp,notbad112,2,Wed Jun 3 17:49:50 2015 UTC,"And whats the unfair advantage?  An advantage is having an edge that no one else has/can achieve through normal means. You can't buy gear or items that change stats in the cash shop at all. You cannot pay to have an unfair advantage.  Now if you are talking about buying a character from the Auction House...then you need to check the meaning of advantage. A person can use real money to buy a level 60 character if he is insanely lucky. That character has not come out of thin air, it has to be leveled and geared by normal means by someone else first. There is absolutely 0 advantage. That character might have died by your hands in one instance and killed you in the next. The only different is that the character has changed hands, nothing more."
wowservers,379ngp,proteinbarskek,0,Thu Jun 4 00:27:23 2015 UTC,"Does Kronos also have a lot of bots? I joined Nost yesterday due to its population and being completely new to WoW. I love big populations, and the whole ""competing for mobs"" and such is not an issue for me like it is for some. I play tons of games on their release date, so it's something I've grown accustomed to.  That said, you bring up the lag. I still haven't had ANY lag on Nost yet. I've played 8-9 hours now and no problems.  My issue is the massive number of bots. I'm only level 8 right now, and have seen more bots than I can count. Yesterday there were 10 level 8+'s farming level 2-3 mobs. It was obvious they were bots because all of them were overlapped and all stayed overlapped through movements. That makes it pretty obvious, since there's no way 10 players would move at such precise timing that they could stay overlapped throughout fighting, moving and looting.  Bot-wise, I think this is a huge contributor to Nost's population. I have counted around 100 bots just from the very first area now, and about 250 or so players. If this is equal to how the rest of it is, we can attribute at least 2-3k of the ""online players"" to being bots. And apparently (based on what others have said in-game) there are tons of bots farming dungeons as well."
wowservers,379ngp,notbad112,5,Tue Jun 2 10:29:02 2015 UTC,"Not very many Bots Here, I am a Bot Banning Fool ;)  <3 Gurky"
wowservers,379ngp,alexhjelm,4,Tue May 26 07:29:49 2015 UTC,"Yes I've also read testimony from those who don't appear to have any issues with lag or delay, and I must say my friends would be jealous as they're whinging constantly about it, they are just too invested in their characters to switch.  I won't say bots don't exist, because inevitably people will try to use a bot program but what I will say is I have actively been involved in bot ban processes, both in respect to suspected players in my own guild and people out in the world.  Perma-ban is the verdict doled out to anyone caught botting, and we have very active GMs who are relentless for that sort of thing.  Gurky, who is a GM that posted below has worked with our guild on a few cases, and I have seen first hand how he bans bots constantly. A quick check of the report forum will show you an idea of their punishment frequency for botting and other things (the ones reported by players that is).  That's another thing that has been positive about my Kronos experience, the GMs are easy to reach and communicable. There's even an IRC where you can pop on and the lead developer himself will usually be sitting in there open to chat about anything. We've reached out to him for several issues in the past to great success, and the lead developer himself has even hung out in my stream.  It's all of this that has really bolstered that ""tight-knit"" community feel being on Kronos but we could dedinetly stand to see some more players (mostly in terms of NA region players)."
wowservers,379ngp,notbad112,2,Wed May 27 02:17:20 2015 UTC,"To confirm, your post is all in relation to Kronos, and not Nost, correct?"
wowservers,379ngp,alexhjelm,2,Tue May 26 07:41:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm referring specifically to my Kronos experience. I'm trying to avoid addressing any Nostalrius issues I may/may not have as this isn't about that, it's about how I can help to fix the vanilla community at large while at the same time benefiting both Kronos & Nost so that everyone is happy."
wowservers,379ngp,notbad112,1 point,Tue May 26 08:05:34 2015 UTC,"Got it. I was just a little confused reading through, as Kronos was referred to after most of the positive things were shared (so I wasn't sure if you were saying Nost has an active GM group that bans bots or not). I've also noticed that Nost has a lot of gold selling spam. One person was spamming chat for at least 2 hours today without a ban.  I think what I'll likely do is sort of ""split"" between the two. If I roll an alt, for example, I'll do it on Kronos. This way there's two servers to pool players from, and it helps out both at the same time."
wowservers,379ngp,proteinbarskek,4,Tue May 26 08:09:56 2015 UTC,"During my undercover on various ""Botting Sites"" I have learned that Nost does in fact ban bots as well, as for how often I have no clue as I don't play there or GM there.   As for Kronos I at the very least a Bot a Day, people tend to be relentless on topics such as this. I have come up with a couple 100% flawless techniques to catch and confirm these characters botting. Not to toot my own horn but I have gotten very good at this : ]. Botters Beware!   <3 Gurky"
wowservers,379ngp,notbad112,0,Tue May 26 08:30:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah i noticed the same thing on nost, besides the fac that they fake those numbers. and no, i haven't encountered any bot on kronos."
wowservers,379ngp,proteinbarskek,1 point,Wed May 27 02:23:15 2015 UTC,Is there really any real evidence that can support the claims that people are saying there are fake players?   I have not been noticing any at all while leveling my other toon.
wowservers,379ngp,notbad112,-1,Tue May 26 07:39:54 2015 UTC,"Well, besides the fact that they showed that they have this implemented on their server and used them before, i can tell you with all honesty that i used to work for a mangos server in the early days. What i can tell you is that mangos or any other emulator will have problems besides 4k players, to understand this you have to imagine that everything you do on your character, movement, key strokes, spells, and so much more (thousands of data is sent and received from the server) now imagine 8k players doing that. It's an unimaginable web of data, checks, ifs and factors. Even if you have the hardware for it, the server won't be able to sustain it. Now, you can say that maby they got some miracle and worked really hard to make this possible, but the fact is that they have certain mangos known bugs that are still there, untouched, someone with the capability to make an emulator to sustain 8k players should be able to make the server 100% bug free. That's my 2 cents, if you want more info on how mangos is working you should check their source code and you'll understand."
wowservers,379ngp,raptorak,1 point,Tue May 26 22:06:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to say they don't bot. But I don't think the staff wants to keep overloading their server with more ""bots"" when the pop is over 6k and rather starts degrading the experience."

New spells never replaces old one (when it comes to spell ID, not classes etc.) but I guess they have removed old unused spells from client so they can be no longer used.  Old talents - very difficult to do with WoD client. My idea is to create an addon which would simulate old trees, but it would take a lot of time.  Old Azeroth - while you can disable flying mounts and script old quests, the map would be still from WoD.  To sum up: even if you could recreate vanilla a bit in WoD, it would take a looooot of time and I think the result wouldn't be satisfying."

We are a relatively new server, based on the 1.12.1 patch (Classic WoW), however we may expand to other expansions in the future.  Unfortunately for you no vanilla server can do the new UI style, as it is client-side.  We currently have two realms, Crossroads, which is a 1x rates blizzlike server, and Carnage, which is an instant 60 PvP server.  Unfortunately Carnage is not quite ready for full release, you can play on it if you want, although we believe that it is not ready for players.  Crossroads is ready to play on, with no major bugs that would harm your experience, as a matter of fact, a member of staff was able to level to 60 without experiencing any issues.  We believe that we can provide an experience at the same level of Nostalrius or Kronos.  We have a dedicated staff team which includes 8 people which are located in different areas of the world, and therefore at least one person will be online to help you at any time of day.  So what are you waiting for, come and join us today.  link: http://nephilimwow.org/news  -Thanks for reading this  Senior Gamemaster Sevren"

wowservers,37aqgx,coolfangs,2,Tue May 26 06:36:17 2015 UTC,"Just looked into it, they are also releasing a new WoD server. While I'm not too confident it'll be very good, it surely can't be worse than what's available now. Kinda strange though that they are jumping right over Wrath and Cata."
wowservers,37aqgx,coolfangs,0,Tue May 26 06:40:33 2015 UTC,"Ye, the admins have said that their WoD is flawed but that they wish to release both WoD and MoP as to provide devs with new challenges. They claim their MoP is better than all available alternatives!  I do not see how WoD private servers can be really good as the emulators are new and they will have a hard time running new content. The current WoD emulators are set in an early expansion patch so I don't know whether they will even be compatible for future content. Feenix' MoP is in 5.4.2 though, so that shouldn't be an issue ;) ."

wowservers,37aqgx,Nuber132,2,Tue May 26 07:07:59 2015 UTC,Do we know rates already?
wowservers,37aqgx,coolfangs,1 point,Tue May 26 07:39:55 2015 UTC,I heard they have 3x rates on PTR. So probaly will be between 3-7x may be.
wowservers,37aqgx,Hyptu,0,Tue May 26 07:42:46 2015 UTC,I don't understand the point of having 3x rates on MoP/WoD. Leveling is already ridiculously fast at 1x on those xpacs. How much faster do you need it to be?
wowservers,37aqgx,Nuber132,1 point,Tue May 26 10:18:03 2015 UTC,"I am sure developers are too lazy to script all quest :) With rates x3 you can do 1/3 of quests per zone, then quests ""kill x mobs"", ""collect y items"" are enough to hit 90."
wowservers,37aqgx,Nuber132,1 point,Tue May 26 10:34:49 2015 UTC,"Well, I know of no private server in which every single quest functions correctly. So are all private server developers lazy? :P Or is it simply an enormous task? :)"

wowservers,37aqgx,Laaaaaaas,2,Tue May 26 11:23:41 2015 UTC,Ofc but they cloud give the reason which is behind their vote.
wowservers,37aqgx,Laaaaaaas,2,Tue May 26 12:03:23 2015 UTC,"it's an enormous task.   to put it simply, lets say there's a bug in a quest. we don't know what the exact source of the bug is. now we need to check the creature and all of it's rows of data to make sure that it is flagged to behave correctly. then we make sure the creature actually has/gives the quest if it's supposed to. then you check the quest for mistakes, typos and check the flags on it. if all of that's good, then you have a bigger problem, maybe an item for example. now you check the item, if the item drops properly, etc. now what if it's not the item, but instead a problem in the core with the scripting? now you have to look through potentially dozens of files to see which one could be the source of the error, change what you think is necessary and rebuild the server (~10 min to rebuild depending on PC). if it doesn't work, you have to repeat the process over and over.   that is why even the bugs that seem so simple are actually not very simple at all. creating a blizzlike server that isn't on the WOTLK patch is very hard, because WOTLK is the only public private server core that is worked on in a very big community, thus it is very blizzlike even if you don't know how to develop"
wowservers,37aqgx,Nuber132,1 point,Tue May 26 13:16:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly! :o) People have ridiculous expectations from private server developers. Many projects have a staff full of people who do their best in providing gamers a pleasant return to the WoW they loved. If you see projects are doing their best, encourage them! It's easy to trash-talk other projects and it is an extremely competitive world but remember this: the popular private servers are subscription free and depend largely on altruism of its community and staff. Reading your message makes me believe you are experienced/involved with development, good luck!"
wowservers,37aqgx,Nuber132,0,Tue May 26 13:29:51 2015 UTC,Yes.  It is an enormous task.  Wrath servers have the best core to initially work with and there is a ton of scripting that still needs to be done on there to bring up the complete quests there as well.  Closest completely scripted quest server I've seen so far would have to be Gamer-District...but it is wasted since it is a x7 server.
wowservers,37aqgx,coolfangs,2,Tue May 26 17:35:54 2015 UTC,"Are there any like ""what you gonna play"" poll so we can see how the class distribution and stuff looks for tomorrow? :)"

wowservers,378ibg,GentlemanGengar1,8,Mon May 25 19:13:24 2015 UTC,I'd recommend staying away from Warmane. Consider looking into Dalaran or Gamer-District. Much better scripting.
wowservers,378ibg,coolfangs,3,Mon May 25 19:57:56 2015 UTC,"Why didn't you just farm the material?  Thats what I did.  You're level 80  and it is TBC content?  Hopefully, you are level 80 because if you are doing a first time toon there god bless your soul if you changed the xp rate(then I'd understand the struggle).  My advice...level to 80 and use that toon to gain capital.  I make 20g a day on JC'n from the honor I gain from just doing battlegrounds."
wowservers,378ibg,dungeonjay,2,Tue May 26 15:59:44 2015 UTC,"You are really exaggerating there.  You run stratheholme a few times....sell the greys and auction off the unwanted like righteous orbs which fetch a decent penny for people looking for crusader enchants for their boas.  When I said 20g...I literally meant 20,000 and that is just from farming battleground honor and converting to gems to cut for my JC.  But if running a dungeon five times is too much to invest in leveling your enchanting when you are at 80 then there isn't much more that needs to be said about their economy.  One Final Note/Edit  It is a x7 server.  I would not suggest stop progressing for lack of leveling professions on that server either.  I was just like you did enchanting first.  I stopped at around TBC content for that gold gap you are talking about.  I leveled to 80 and then focused on what I needed to do to max that profession out.  I imagine all increased xp servers are the same in trying to accomplish that."
wowservers,378ibg,dungeonjay,3,Tue May 26 18:51:35 2015 UTC,"Dalaran-wow is exactly what you're looking for.  x1 rates, fully scripted and almost all quests working.  Wintergrasp works, all dungeons and raids (at least wotlk ones) work, and there's usually a couple hundred people on. The best part is, it's progressive, and right now Ulduar is open, Naxx, VoA, EoE, but not ToC or ICC. Server uptime is excellent, and RDF (random dungeon finder) works extremely smoothly.  there's a donation and vote shop but no end content gear can be bought.  You can buy mounts, pets, etc, and level 60/70 end content gear, but who cares about that?  You can also buy a level 70 character for ~$15 but that's not a really a big deal and most people choose to level their characters manually anyway. Here's the link: http://www.dalaran-wow.com/ If you choose dalaran, go on Algalon, not Kirin-Tor."
wowservers,378ibg,taffyrooster,1 point,Tue May 26 19:06:44 2015 UTC,Why do you say Algalon and not Kirin Tor? I've read up on the server differences in the past but it seemed rather confusing
wowservers,378ibg,Transylvanian,1 point,Tue May 26 19:46:14 2015 UTC,"Kirin Tor was the first realm opened. Now that Algalon is here, it is the main realm and Kirin Tor is dead."
wowservers,378ibg,Vektor12,1 point,Tue May 26 03:53:53 2015 UTC,"Basically, Kirin tor is 3.3.5 wotlk with every instance opened. This means that people will be running icc maybe toc to gear up but the others are old news. Algalon however is progressive so currently they only have Naxx and ulduar and both are run frequently. The population on Kirin tor is also pretty bad, but Algalon (imo) is amazing. My in game name is Ayutheus, hit me up if you log in! :)"
wowservers,378ibg,taffyrooster,3,Wed May 27 07:10:47 2015 UTC,"WotLK is my favorite expansion, I 've tried most of the servers, and Gamer-District is definitely the best. Warmane for high pop, bugs, lazy devs, shadowmournes everywhere and no wintergrasp. Dalaran-WoW for the best progressive PvE WotLK, but low pop and little PvP. Gamer-District for very good PvE, very good PvP, working Wintergrasp, with population around 1000-1500. Donation here is more expensive than usual, so you don't see many donators"
wowservers,378ibg,lazycalm2,6,Wed May 27 18:44:31 2015 UTC,"Low pop? Dalaran-WoW had 1.5k people on today. It's NOT lowpop, it's more of medium pop.  Avg population is from 500-1.5k+"

I'm all about some Dalaran but I have to have an unbias approach when dealing with scripting and GD has a notch up on Wintergrasp in that department.  Both are functional, which in itself, speaks volumes about those two servers.  If we are discussing raiding, I lean toward Dalaran being more accurate."

We are a relatively new server, based on the 1.12.1 patch (Classic WoW), however we may expand to other expansions in the future.  We currently have two realms, Crossroads, which is a 1x rates blizzlike server, and Carnage, which is an instant 60 PvP server.  Unfortunately Carnage is not quite ready for full release, you can play on it if you want, although we believe that it is not ready for players.  Crossroads is ready to play on, with no major bugs that would harm your experience, as a matter of fact, a member of staff was able to level to 60 without experiencing any issues.  We believe that we can provide an experience at the same level of Nostalrius or Kronos.  We have a dedicated staff team which includes 8 people which are located in different areas of the world, and therefore at least one person will be online to help you at any time of day.  So what are you waiting for, come and join us today.  link: http://nephilimwow.org/news  -Thanks for reading this  Senior Gamemaster Sevren"

So this time around I decided to inform myself beforehand: I took the stats from Excalibur's main page in order to get a rough estimate of the active class distribution.

If you look on paladins for example, I could bet you an estimate of 40% are retributions and maybe 25% holy/ 35% tankadins. This is why Pure dps-classes always feels like there is more of them around, but statisticly they aren't. I would say endgame holy paladins is still needed, the best way to inform yourself if you want to do BT/SWP or other endgame is to check the servers forum for guild recruitment pages and go from there."

wowservers,376mpu,denbighlord,4,Mon May 25 08:49:48 2015 UTC,"I'm trying a bunch of MoP servers right now, and while I was disappointed in every one of them one way or the other, I have to say that Warmane has the best scripted Pandaren starting area in my opinion. And they have a large, english speaking population.  I'm sure Warmane has a bunch of problems (lags, server crashes, pay2win, scripting of other zones/instances...), but it may be that as far as MoP servers go, the one-eyed man is the king among the blind here. Cata on the other hand is not worth it, I think, Atlantiss has better scripts."
wowservers,376mpu,samw99,2,Mon May 25 12:19:06 2015 UTC,And now imagine that it will stay like that until next expansion comes out and then they will focus on new expansion. Sad truth.
wowservers,376mpu,Vpos,2,Mon May 25 13:41:26 2015 UTC,WoW Freakz has better scripting than warmane.
wowservers,376mpu,SandMan560,1 point,Mon May 25 15:49:53 2015 UTC,"My impression of Freakz' scripting of the Pandaren starting area was also very positive, as good as Warmane's.   After playing a day more on Freakz my impression was that they still have quite a way to go though. Basically no mob I've encountered up to level 35 did anything else than auto attacks, while WM has had the spells right of the mobs I've seen so far.   The dungeon finder of Freakz ports you into the dungeon, but you can't get back. When the RDF ports you into the Scarlet Monastery you'll fall to your death and die. Then you ressurect in Westfall, the group disbands because you can't get back and you have a 30 minute dungeon deserter debuff.  Wailing Caverns was very good already, but the Deadmines were not blizzlike at all... there were just some mobs in it doing auto attacks, but no scripts.  And so on. I think the server is pretty good already if you consider the fact that they're only a month old, but they seem to have quite a way to go still.  They also have custom content like instant flight paths (=teleports), x-faction dungeons and LfR, portals in all big cities, they're pay2win (but basically every MoP server is). And I think they don't have too many english speakers. I've tried to find an english guild, but apparently there are only 2 on the server (alliance side).  So I think Freakz is a server to keep in mind because they seem to be very active and have about the same level already as some MoP servers which exist much longer, but right now I'm thinking that Warmane might be the one-eyed king of the MoP servers so far for english players. (They all suck still compared to earlier expansions, but these might suck a little bit less than others.)  I also want to have a look at Monster and then I'll make a post about my first impressions of MoP realms, I think.  I'm personally hoping for Atlantiss MoP, but that one is probably still a loooong time away."
wowservers,376mpu,samw99,1 point,Mon May 25 16:27:36 2015 UTC,"For me the thing that made WoW freakz better than warmane is that I am still a very new player and I have never played retail since I can't afford it. Since Warmane was the most populated server I decided to play there, but I'm more of a lore person and when you level that fast you just can't get a grasp on what you are doing. I reached lvl 77 for 4 days as a person that hasn't played WoW before, skipping entire zones. WoW freakz was more appealing because of the custom rates, and yes there is a difference between the scripting. On warmane quests are either well-scripted or don't work at all, while on freakz most of them are completable, but as you said the custom features turned me off of the server, So I decided to go back to Cataclysm. I'm playing on atlantiss curently and having a blast."
wowservers,376mpu,SandMan560,1 point,Mon May 25 16:41:59 2015 UTC,"True, I'm also mainly playing on Atlantiss right now.  The MoP servers are disappointing compared to Atlantiss (and also compared to the other servers recommended here like Dalaran, Kronos/Nost etc. I guess), but I wanted to find out which MoP one sucks the least."
wowservers,376mpu,samw99,0,Mon May 25 16:51:43 2015 UTC,"On warmane quests are either well-scripted or don't work at all   I just saw on the forums that on warmane apparently the majority of low-level (Classic-Cata) dungeons are closed, and all low-level raids are closed as well.

wowservers,376mpu,Janusse,2,Mon May 25 10:55:29 2015 UTC,"no other server compares when it comes to pvp in my opinion, and of course the population. I enjoy the high-ish rates for leveling and the voting points system is way less confusing than any other server I've tried to play on. people talk about it being P2W but that's honestly only if you have loads of money. each PVP/PVE piece is minimum of 24 Donation Points and you can only buy either 22 for $20 or 33 for $30 so basically every one is going to cost you $30. if you think most people have the means to drop $30 per armor/weapon piece, I believe you're wrong. that's hundreds of dollars. it's not like you can spend $50 and be full pvp/PVE geared.  I look at it like any private server is going to have bugs, but if you want pvp and population then warmane is your best bet. people circlejerk for atlantiss and dalaran and those types of servers but tbh I've never felt the appeal of leveling 1x with 500-1000 other people on the whole server max. now if you wanna play vanilla it's a whole different story bc Nost blows Warmane out of the water with pop."
wowservers,376mpu,Zeyz,1 point,Mon May 25 11:31:51 2015 UTC,"I donated once to skip ques, there was a thread in their donation section (yes there is such, visible only for ppl that donate), there was a thread with ppl that donated enought money to play on retail for 10 years.

wowservers,376mpu,Nuber132,2,Tue May 26 23:05:54 2015 UTC,"yes there is a donator section just like there is a subreddit for people with reddit gold. $30 isn't a lot to people, $30 isn't a lot to me but to fill up 14 slots that's something like $430. that is a lot especially for only one character. and regardless, you can't buy skill. someone undergeared for their skill level can kill someone who is overgeared for their skill level any day of the week."

Don't waist your time, you will end up being spent a lot of time hoping something to change but things will be the same always. It't been like that since they open their servers and still didn't changed. It wouldn't be problem if they opened it one or two years ago but they open it 6 years ago... :/  That's major reason why they are one of worst servers out there."
wowservers,376mpu,Vpos,1 point,Mon May 25 15:53:35 2015 UTC,"I only play warmane. The population is highest, and yes it is buggy. Lots of mobs get stuck in ground, there is an exiting combat bug, but I haven't seen it much after level 80, not sure why.  I have only had issues completing a handful of quests, and it is hard to know when something is bugged or not sometimes (like is this boss mob going to respawn or not??), but overall, finding a group and playing with others is actually possible, unlike other servers I have tried. I've been on Molten, now Warmane, for about 2 years."

wowservers,376nno,jmorfeus,7,Mon May 25 09:41:51 2015 UTC,"Play both and choose yourself. Thats the best advice anyone can give. I play on Kronos most of the time because I support their development philosophy and their playerbase is just great.  I use Nos to PvP because of their pre-nerf AV. I don't really PvE on Nos because of the patch they are running. A lot of quests on high level zones have not implemented yet because they are running patch 1.4...they will be implemented in the future but by that time I won't need to do them.  Both provide a great vanilla experience, Kronos a less buggy one especially between 45-60, however the population of Nos is very attractive.  As Mephea suggested its not difficult to invest a bit of time in both and then choose...there is not a time limit and you can take as much time as you like to level. Get to level 15-20 on both so you can run a few dungeons and see how the quests in a few zones are then make a decision.  If you care at all about which server each individual person plays on. I have a 60 on Nos, but I am leveling quite a few characters on Kronos and spend most my time there...its just a nicer place overall to spend my time"
wowservers,376nno,Struckd,2,Mon May 25 09:27:04 2015 UTC,"Well I have played to 30 on both servers, and I can say Kronos is better scripted without a doubt, although the pop isn't there yet, if more people were to bite the bullet, the pop probably wouldn't be a problem."
wowservers,376nno,Pvt_8Ball,2,Tue May 26 00:20:11 2015 UTC,"I'd have to recommend nostalrius if you are at all interested in BGs. I recently dinged 60 on Kronos and the population makes it very difficult. My experience of horde side was that WSG only really popped at peak times, at about half hour intervals, however, I never got into any of them. I would see them pop up but the que must have been full of premades or way more people than in the alliance que. Arathi basin never once popped and given this I find it difficult to believe that AV would ever happen once that was released.  The PvE side is better at least for EU players. I know the US PvE scene has taken a bit of a hit with the recent ban of the biggest US raiding guild. I can confirm the the scripting on Kronos is a good as people say it is, it's a really well scripted server with very few bugs. I've only just started leveling on nos so I couldn't really compare the two but kronos has set the bar very high in that respect."

I wouldn't even want to play on private servers if official servers were an option.  For some reason though you failed to mention quality and lack of bugs.

And until somewhat very recently, they pretty much didn't, and they still aren't close to the original Vanilla quality either on Nostalrius and Kronos, but at least Nostalrius has the population, wich makes it great.  Population is also a big thing. One of the things wich makes Nostalrius great is the HUGE population. When you find a group quest, you're almost certainly able to find someone to do it with."

wowservers,376ooc,Cornholi,2,Mon May 25 12:14:31 2015 UTC,"As someone who started playing on private servers mostly after Nos, honestly I think it's the lack of authenticity and bugs. Even though I enjoy Nost for what it is, and it's supposed to be among the cream of the crop of Vanilla servers, the non-Blizzlike scripting and pathing and monster behaviour often puts me off.  I tried some private server before and there was a huge lack of population. I remember quitting because of the lack of population then. I got to level 10? warlock hordeside and quit.  Heck, even Kronos, who is supposed to have quality scripting, is not 100% perfect like Vanilla. Sure, the pathing and everything is Blizz-like but exactly like Blizz? It is not. The feel is just not the same, and it lacks the population.  So yeah, there you have it. Quality and previously, population. Plus the fact that private servers can go down under at any time and, in some instances, pay to win. Speaking of wich, Kronos has already reset and relaunched 2 times.  I even contemplated on not rolling on Nost because of this, but I told myself, if I get to 60 and have some fun AoE grinding as a Paladin, it'll be worth it. Im still 50, but will be getting 60 later on, but so far it has been a blast."

wowservers,376ooc,jee2582,1 point,Tue May 26 06:50:11 2015 UTC,"A few people in a guildchat and i discussed exactly this some days ago. They do the games for the new kids (New generation you could say?) SO that means their brain is fresh and dont know about vanilla tbc wotlk for example and they just create new meanings for all those things you can do on offical servers. This way, people who played Vanilla or TBC dislike pretty much what they are doing with the game. And the new kids can very easy, just very simple accept the game is it is. But they will probably dislike it aswell after some years of changes that hit their efforts aswell... I think there are more Kids than adults available on this planet to pay for their game, what a joke this humanity right? They need to find out how many can pay for their game :). Also one obvious factor that more kids than adults are playing, is because most adults will start working.  One additional note i want to make: Removing content where people spent effort in gathering things, is the same that they dont appreciate your effort. If they did, they would find other solutions. Capitalism and Communism is the same, just like Alan Watts already said. Or i think it was him. You know its like a God comes down to Earth and saying: ""You lived your life for 60 years, gathering all the money, building the house, buying that car? Well i will take all that away and i will put you in a small house and you will start with nothing"". This is the same thing. I think there is this thing that, If you pay for their game you become one of them and some parts belong to you aswell. The more you pay the more belongs to you. Im not a student so i dont have the perfect word for that."

wowservers,376ooc,potcorn,1 point,Mon May 25 22:34:55 2015 UTC,"Iâm one of those who always played retail even if I knew private servers existed.  The main reason is that MMOs are a huge time investment, and since private servers are kept up by the good will of some people instead of a company you pay for a service, I fear the loss of everything Iâd put into it.   True that Blizzard can decide any time to shutdown the game, but that's very unlikely to happen because companies are all about business so as long as they can make a profit out of it the game will be up and running 24/7 with support given to customers as it's been so far.  This is why I have been on retail so far regardless of all the bad things happening (hope that answers your question :)), and while I can only speak for myself, it's not unreasonable to think there may be other people feeling the same."

Vanilla leveling is very slow and often takes months to get to 60. And Nost is a very populated server which means you often are competing for mobs.
wowservers,376yfs,coolfangs,0,Mon May 25 20:06:54 2015 UTC,"Greetings  I am Senior Gamemaster Sevren from NephilimWoW.  We are a relatively new server, based on the 1.12.1 patch (Classic WoW), however we may expand to other expansions in the future.  We currently have two realms, Crossroads, which is a 1x rates blizzlike server, and Carnage, which is an instant 60 PvP server.  Unfortunately Carnage is not quite ready for full release, you can play on it if you want, although we believe that it is not ready for players.  Crossroads is ready to play on, with no major bugs that would harm your experience, as a matter of fact, a member of staff was able to level to 60 without experiencing any issues.  We believe that we can provide an experience at the same level of Nostalrius or Kronos.  We have a dedicated staff team which includes 8 people which are located in different areas of the world, and therefore at least one person will be online to help you at any time of day.  So what are you waiting for, come and join us today.  link: http://nephilimwow.org/news  -Thanks for reading this  Senior Gamemaster Sevren"

wowservers,375w0x,coolfangs,3,Mon May 25 03:52:59 2015 UTC,"Retail, everything else is crap if u want to play wod."

wowservers,375w0x,dungeonjay,1 point,Tue May 26 17:22:51 2015 UTC,"Ashran is the only option. I recently leveled a character there, the end game content is quite scripted - a few bosses work, the garrison works, new BGs as well. I am in touch with the Staff there, the developers are passionate and hardworking. Give it a try. >I have never played Wow before up until about 3 days ago and so far I've played a Vanilla server for an hour, a Wrath of the lich king server for an hour and I've played the starter edition for the retail version for a while."

Then I think we have to wait for a completely new server. Atlantiss will release MoP in the future (still long time), it may be interesting since they have already content 1-85 working very well, then developing MoP will be easier.  Few WoD servers have already appeared, but it looks like only two still exists - Ashran and Hellscream. While Ashran is like most MoP servers - focus only on end game, mostly PvP, Hellscream looks interesting, because the team seems to know what they are doing, check their changelog, they want to script whole content. Of course it is very difficult and long task, but maybe in few years it will be the best WoD server (For me it is already the best wod)"
wowservers,376vt0,Hyptu,1 point,Mon May 25 11:28:02 2015 UTC,They just acquired fresh sniffs from the WoD expansion.  And really good ones from what I heard.  It will be interesting but if judging by the response some developers are talking about we may be seeing some vast improvements on Pservers in the WoD profile sooner then the other two(Cata/Mop).  WoD may even become smoother and better to play on then those cores sniffed out for Cata and MoP.  Kinda like how Wrath is the best scripted/worked out expansion because of the positive return from information obtained during this period of time.
wowservers,376q4z,pancinamio,2,Mon May 25 09:36:34 2015 UTC,I for one hope they don't. Part of the attraction to a new server is that everyone has to start from scratch. No twinks and no mains that come gank you for hours!

wowservers,3748y7,Gaboda,1 point,Mon May 25 10:23:16 2015 UTC,"Just a random question about this because there's just something I don't understand. Why do people get so easily excited about an upcoming server, or the hype surrounding it, when there's already perfectly good servers in existence?   I mean take vengeance for example. People don't play there because it's low pop server, and instead of going there to change it, they are more excited about a server that isn't even open yet, and have no idea about the quality or how many people are going to end up playing there.  Same with CC. Rather than playing on current servers, people are willing to wait for x amount of weeks/months/years for CC to open just because it's hyped everywhere.  I just don't get it."
wowservers,3748y7,Mephea,1 point,Mon May 25 00:17:16 2015 UTC,"Irrational herd behavior =p . And the scrpit-state of x1 TBC feenix will be the same as the currently available realm, so they actually do know the quality. Btw, what content is currently available on vengeance? May wna try it out if it has some raids!"
wowservers,3748y7,charizardpok,1 point,Mon May 25 06:27:21 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I think they haven't even started releasing the raids yet due to the population. There's literally less than 100, or even less than 50, people on at peaks (whenever that is, the server's in Canada as well).   So the way I see it, it's a perfectly good server just waiting for people to join so they can start releasing the raid content."
wowservers,3748y7,Mephea,1 point,Mon May 25 09:03:55 2015 UTC,"I am sceptical about the argument 'more population speeds up content development'. What about BGs/arena? If there is no raiding, what is the vengeance community doing to enjoy themselves? Judging from your comments, it looks to me that the owner of vengeance might have been better off to stall its release until more content was available. Due to competition, the private server scene does not offer projects many chances. People usually try out a project, play a little on it and if they do not like it, move on to another project."
wowservers,3748y7,charizardpok,1 point,Mon May 25 09:56:12 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, what I know about their raids is only what I've read here. Afaik the server just more or less appeared out of nowhere, and because they didn't build a hype before the release people are just ignoring them. Which is exactly what puzzles me.   If more population doesn't affect the speed of the development, or the rate at which content is released (which is more what I was talking about), then what does? And I mean that there's little to no point releasing BT if there's not enough people to enter the first 25 man raid.   If people try a project and leave it if they don't like it, there should be very little reasons not to like vengeance. Only things I can think of is the population and possibly the fact that you have to start at lvl 1. But at the same time, I'm sure CC would get just as many players on their server regardless of what lvl you'd have to start."
wowservers,3748y7,Mephea,1 point,Mon May 25 12:24:13 2015 UTC,"Kronos vs. Nostalrius has shown that people do not value quality as the main determinant in their private server choice.   Due to the interest of the reddit community, I started delving into Vengeancewow to see whether I could get hooked into it.  https://www.vengeancewow.com/forum/announces/wildhammer-tbc-realm-progression-plan-t556.html : Currently there is no single raid released apparently and it will take some time before the project will see any.   The project leader looks like a nice guy but without anything to do, I fear that it will never become truly popular. I personally do not like private servers that work with a long term content release planning (of zones that are not scripted yet), because these plannings are most often not met, crushing people's expectations. (Example: content release on Nost.) This is currently happening on Vengeancewow. X-Savior put Sethekk Halls on 1/05/2015 release date, instead it went to PTR on 23/05/2015. This isn't a large delay but it simply proves my point. Very long run script promises are in my opinion a cheap way of creating hypes.   ^ All of this is purely personal opinion though : -) ."

It just isn't going to happen. Nost players are also extremely skeptical of the administration scandal involving an NA guild on Kronos, it's just not something they want to deal with.  Also, Dire Maul is incredibly well scripted on Nostalrius, it just hasn't been released. The test server confirms that. Unlike Kronos, Nostalrius didn't launch with DM open, which is a good thing. DM gear is on par with MC gear, it shouldn't be available at the server launch."

wowservers,376j9m,Algathal,2,Mon May 25 07:57:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know what to say, I am 100% agree with Ghandi91. Mimiron's thing, I don't know what are you talking about, played Ulduar 25 pug this Friday, 10 the Sunday and again, yesterday's night again 25 with the main: we didn't have Mimiron's teleport open by default, it enabled as always, with the first pull.  You know there is only one developer mate? You know he has been correcting things since a the big patch? (if you know anything about development, you should know tons of things can be broken). Tons of things have been fixed with this patch, and those which got broken are being fixed within hours. Ulduar is almost exactly as it was before the patch, I only noticed Thorim's chain lighting and as I read on the bug tracker it had been fixed 3 hours ago!  But listen mate, Lothloryen, the developer, wrote the day after the patch that if anyone finds a bug on raids, he would really appreciate a report on his mail, since he was working on it day and night. If you really liked once the server, why the hell haven't you written him or even on the bug tracker such reports? No... you must write here and talk the shit out of the server, what you have done, its awful for a server that have offered the best scripts ever. They have one failure; they are correcting things every day (with daily maintenances), and you can't bear with that, you think this is Blizzard? Even Blizzard have awful releases. And a private server with 1 developer, with the best scripts loses all your support because of it?   There, the dev asking it on the forums: http://www.dalaran-wow.com/forums/algalon/information/topic/5415/raid-issues  Well, I am really disappointed. I didn't experience for example that vezax trash bug, and I am sure he doesn't even know about it. My guild master wrote him with some issues and they got fixed that same night!  Do you even know how Github works? THEY CAN'T DELETE GITHUB POSTS, so why are you saying they delete bug report threads from the bug tracker? They can't..."
wowservers,376j9m,uos65,1 point,Mon May 25 10:34:50 2015 UTC,"Very well, let me make a few things clear.  1) No, I didn't know there was only one developer. However... Doesn't that only make it more important -to test the freaking patch on a PTR- before releasing it in a completely broken state? Nobody's playing on Kirin Tor anymore, for god's sake. Just use that.  2) After checking in with my guild master, I heard that he has sent an e-mail to the dev a few days ago. We went inside today and discovered the Mimiron portal still being active somehow and the barrier again not vanishing even after wiping ourselves. So we might have actually screwed outselves out of doing Mimiron this week. As for the Vezax trash coming through the floor, that also still happens.  3) I'd welcome daily maintenances, I just don't believe they're there. How many fixes have I seen so far? None. I remain unconvinced.  4) If they can't delete Github posts, then could you explain to me why an issue I posted ""vanished"", and why a guildie had to make a list with jousting bugs three times because it ""vanished"" twice?"
wowservers,376j9m,ghandi91,1 point,Mon May 25 11:56:24 2015 UTC,"This is not true, I have seen them on the bug tracker working A LOT to fix some things. In fact, most of them got fixed! I have been playing every day since the patch, and some of the issues you mention are totally untrue. EVERY DAY in the morning were maintenances with lots of hotfixes either for raids, or other things (check the bug tracker). Its not been more than a week, the patch got released the 19th and I can say, it had tons of good things. If you add what they fixed until today, the server is very fine right now. Many lies or lack of information in your thread, which in my opinion invalidates your arguments.  About the lag, a guild mate and me checked the server routing and the problem wasn't with dalaran wow, there was an issue on Europe lately with network routing and there were some packet loss."
wowservers,376j9m,Thalabon,1 point,Mon May 25 09:12:44 2015 UTC,"You might be right about the lag, I have no way to check if you're wrong.  However, I have experienced all of the problems that OP adresses in the past two days. They haven't fixed any of these, and I haven't seen any fixes yet aside from the Mimiron teleport being open by default. Yes, the bugtracker may show a lot of solved issues, but how old are those? And how relevant are they compared to big problems like the end-game raid malfunctioning?  Keep in mind, moderation hasn't always been that bad. It's just rapidly been getting worse."
wowservers,376j9m,samw99,1 point,Mon May 25 10:12:03 2015 UTC,"I don't play there, but as far as I understand it, the following happened:  A new patch was implemented 1.5 weeks ago which broke some stuff and made the server lag.  I guess that they had a test realm for the new patch, but the thing is: normally very few people (if any) are interested in properly testing stuff. They just play on the main realm and expect a perfect patch to be implemented right off the bat. Unfortunately if only a couple of people test stuff on the PTR, a lot of bugs may stay unnoticed. Lags may only show themselves with thousands of players, but not with 10 guys on the PTR.   So the devs only have 2 choices:     not implement anything until it is tested thoroughly, but since people are not interested in testing, it means: never implement anything new implement new content when you don't get any bug reports on the PTR any more. Since no software is perfect this probably means that there will be more issues on the live realm, which you have to fix later.   To me it seems #2 happened and you're unhappy about it. That's understandable, but often necessary in my opinion, otherwhise you could never implement anything new on private servers.  As for the staff: Demanding proofs for bugs is good practice, every server does this or should do it. Do you rather want your devs to dedicate their time to actually fix bugs, or to try to validate bug reports which might not even be true? Often confirming or disconfirming bugs is a time consuming process where you can't simply look something up in the server code, but have to actually test a lot of stuff ingame which may take hours. Do you want your devs to take hours of their time to actually fix bugs, or to say: ""We tested Onyxia for a couple of hours this evening and are fairly confident that she does not do more deep breaths than before, unless it's a rare class/talent/glyph combination your raid had and my GM char didn't have. Than we're out of luck.""  As for your screenshots of loot bugs and hackers: I don't know your server, but on Atlantiss the rules are: ""no hacker reports on the forums, send them to the support email adress."" and ""no replacements of lost items or gold"". I think the reason being in both cases that screenshots can be manipulated easily and thus are no solid proof, and the server itself doesn't track loot in case of server crashes etc. But if the GMs would start refunding one guy, thousand other guys would come and say: ""hey, why did you restore the items for X, but not for us? That's unfair!"" I guess that's a can of worms they just don't want to open, and it may be the same for your server."
wowservers,376j9m,Thalabon,1 point,Mon May 25 09:13:11 2015 UTC,"The problem however, is that there wasn't a PTR to begin with. They just worked on it and uploaded it without giving the community an opportunity to thoroughly test it. And it very clearly shows. Aside from that, they've had 9 months to develop it; Delivering it in such a poor state is nothing short of unacceptable.  As for the staff, it's good to demand proof for bugs. But these days, they still neglect to handle tickets even if there is proof. And that is becoming an increasingly big problem on the entire server.  As for the hackers, threads about those on the forums are deleted on the spot, and there is no other place to report them. So, GM tickets are the only way. Seeing those kinds of tickets get neglected as well makes me feel really uncomfortable with the moderation we have on this server."
wowservers,376j9m,sleepingz,-1,Mon May 25 10:09:07 2015 UTC,I agree!

They have their website unsynced with algalon and they promissed to do it for more than a year ago.   Its sad because raids are REALLY good there, but with that staff and PvP completely broken... its just not the right server for me, and for a lot other players i guess."
wowservers,376j9m,Thalabon,-2,Mon May 25 08:20:12 2015 UTC,"I wish I could upvote this more than once.  I usually flame Molten and retail and support Dalaran-WoW, but this week after the patch has made it really difficult for me to continue supporting this server. I missed out on loot because the my ticket got deleted as well, and I'm experiencing the same issues with the dueling daily quests in the tournament.  It's such a shame. I expected so much more from the staff considering how good Ulduar used to be, only to be met with crippling dissapointment."
wowservers,376j9m,Zaranazer,0,Mon May 25 08:36:37 2015 UTC,So lets just forget everything good about the server and focus on one negative patch. That sounds fair.
wowservers,376j9m,Thalabon,1 point,Mon May 25 10:21:26 2015 UTC,"Well, it definitely has been one doozy of a bad patch. But even besides that, the moderation is just so terrible that I just can't help but compare it to Molten.  I mean, my tickets about loot bugging out get discarded even with screenshots as proof, and meanwhile Horde players can freely abuse the ticket system to get free gear by submitting tickets without proof. And yes, a friend of mine -actually did this-. SUCCESSFULLY.  Or how about the time that I got banned for a week because I said that the GM's might be Horde biased for enabling transfers to them (the bigger faction, horrible idea) and not fixing Tenacity for all this time? Do you want to justify that?"

A wide variety of players submitting reports for the most minor things...and they arent just a line of useless text, most are detailed reports with evidence and solutions to back it up. It does help that the bug tracker is a lot more detailed and organised. The amount of duplicate bug reports on the Nos bugtracker is insane...its very confusing  I prefer Kronos because of the quality playerbase. I have no had trouble finding a group for elite quests or dungeons (i currently have a level 48 and level 26...searching for groups happens very quickly). I do have the fortune of playing in the EU though.  Nonetheless despite my preference, Nos is a solid server. I did have fun leveling on Nos...I was lucky enough to not hit a lot of the problems leveling players have now...however I have avoided most high level dungeons because of a few bugs that occur that won't allow my group to finish the instance.

When I speak to an Innkeeper on Kronos, and I see the option to form a dungeon group, I'm instantly reminded of the fact that I'm playing on a private server. Apparantly that was a feature in retail! I just have no memory of it ever being there!  It's the same thing with the donator rewards. It's of course great that they don't offer gear or gold.

wowservers,372upt,Arthas_Greyjoy,5,Sun May 24 10:08:26 2015 UTC,"This was introduced by Blizzard to hide the number of players on their servers, they showed 50 people max.  In answer to this the CensusPlus addon was developed which breaks the search queries down into smaller parts (looking only for /who r-""Worgen"" c-""Priest"" l-""90"" for example).  If some servers show their real numbers per /who command that's not blizzlike (but it doesn't hurt).  If you want to test your server, download CensusPlus and let it count. In the CensusPlu.lua file change this line   local MAX_WHO_RESULTS = 49;                       -- Maximum number of who results the server will return   to the number of results on your server. If it returns 49, setting it to 48 should do the trick. If it still doesn't count correctly, you maybe have to change line ~ 710 from   if ((CensusPlus_WHOPROCESSOR == CP_libwho) and (not complete)) or ((CensusPlus_WHOPROCESSOR == CP_api) and (numWhoResults > MAX_WHO_RESULTS)) then     into   if (numWhoResults > MAX_WHO_RESULTS) then   or in LibWho-2.0.lua    self.Total, num = GetNumWhoResults()    to    num, self.Total = GetNumWhoResults()   But that depends on your server and game version. Just let Census+ run once in verbose mode and see if the results check out, or if it only reports 49 max level players, for example. Then something is obviously wrong and you'll have to change a line or two in the lua files."
wowservers,372upt,samw99,1 point,Sun May 24 10:26:53 2015 UTC,Nice. I agree with you that it doesn't hurt to display the total population. It kinda helps to get a sense of how many people are playing.
wowservers,372upt,meYesterdayCorded,1 point,Sun May 24 10:57:37 2015 UTC,Why would Blizz want to hide the population?
wowservers,372upt,samw99,1 point,Sun May 24 21:44:48 2015 UTC,"Players are very interested in population numbers of course because they are an indicator for the success of an MMO. They want to play the game and on the server a lot of people play, which is only natural in my opinion.  The thing is: Blizzard as well as all other MMORPGs are doing their best to hide and obfuscate their real numbers.  Most other MMOs don't say anthing at all.  Blizzard doesn't tell us the actual subscriber numbers in the US and Europe (this is what most people would care the most about). Instead, they tell us numbers like ""10 million people"" but that's not only real subsciptions as we know them, but also every guy in an asian internet cafe who paid 9 cent for playing one hour of WoW.  That's the big picture.   On a smaller scale: If Blizzard showed us the real population number on one server, it would be easy to collect them from all servers. This would give you an idea how many people are playing WoW right now, and this is something Blizzard wants to avoid because it would show us how few people are actually still playing in our region (without the inflated asian numbers).  On an even smaller scale: People don't want to play on a dying server, they want to play on large ones. If pop numbers were readily available, most people could easily verify what they may be only suspecting: that they're playing on a ghost realm.  Short term that may be even nice for Blizzard because people would pay a lot of money to transfer their chars from ghost realms to the biggest servers around, but these imbalances lead to problems: More ghost realms and lags, DCs and hour-long queue times on the overpopulated servers. And when the next content patch comes around and more people log in, the highly populated servers will be nearly impossible to play on.  As I said: there is a way via Census+ to get the population numbers of your realm, but it takes a looong time. Like 30+ minutes on a high-pop realm if you scan both factions."

wowservers,371h7u,supermegacactus,3,Sat May 23 23:57:11 2015 UTC,"how long ago did you play on a tbc private server?   Because chances are, the quality will be much better than what you remember. The private server quality grew a lot during the years. I remember playing on some mangos tbc server couple of years ago and being glad that my warlock has one talent tree that has ~85% talents working. Right now, the pservers have much more quality overall.  As for atlantiss, you can smoothly go to max level questing only, most zones are pretty well scripted. Class abilities work pretty good. Every ability works fine, but some minor details and obscure interactions might be bugged, its a private server after all. T11 raids work pretty well. One boss is unkillable because of a major bug on heroic mode (nefarian) but other than that PvE works pretty fine. (But it's not like the raids are easy, only 4 guilds actually cllear all the available heroic raids and those bosses are available for at least half a year now) 5 mans could use some bugfixing , but 5man content is meant to be steamrolled through anyway, so I think it's good that the developers focus on releasing new raid content rather than on improving 5mans.  TL;DR : Everything probably works at a better standard than you remember, if you pick atlantiss you'll have absolutely no trouble levelling up through questing, spells work amazingly good for a private server, and meaningful pve content is really well scripted."
wowservers,371h7u,aneq,1 point,Sun May 24 00:47:04 2015 UTC,"Hi and thanks for answering,   how long ago did you play on a tbc private server?   Actually, not so long ago! I started wow back in 2009, on a crappy serv, but then I came back on a better server (already not bad at all at the time) and played from 2012 until 2013. So yeah, it's nice to know I won't be disappointed if I choose a pre-cata one, but I never tried Cataclysm.   if you pick atlantiss you'll have absolutely no trouble levelling up through questing, spells work amazingly good for a private server, and meaningful pve content is really well scripted.   Awesome! I was afraid that all the non ""go kill me 10 wolves"" quests would not be scipted.  Since you seem to know what you're talking about, what are your thoughts on this xpac? i.e. the opinion I've heard the most is ""it was good in the beginning then it went to shit"", but I still don't know why."
wowservers,371h7u,aneq,3,Sun May 24 01:15:51 2015 UTC,"Its bit complicated, but ""it went to shit later"" actually sums it up pretty well. Everyone was complaining about how easy everything was in late wrath, so the entry tier of cataclysm was made significantly more difficult.  But the general consesus among most of the people was that the changes were good, people welcomed the harder content. I remember a run in Halls of Origination after a warlock's imp broke cc on a trash pack and in turn wiped the party. Warlock apologized and said ""guess the imp is still playing Wrath"". Healing was also revamped. People were so used to healing using only 1, low cast time spell, and in cataclysm healing was changed completely. Because of that, people were oom instantly, and caused a wipe after a wipe. Some people were quick to learn, some were not. Raid encounters also weren't forgiving which in turn made them really pug unfriendly. The unification of raid size difficulty also had a part in this. In Wrath 10-man had weaker loot and was generally easier than 25-man. This changed in cataclysm when 10-man recieved the same loot and difficulty. 10-mans ended up being more difficult than 25-mans in some cases because you've got  much less room in terms of raid setup. (for instance on a certain boss in Bastion of Twilight you need an additional tank on heroic mode. In 10man you actually sacrifice 20% of your dps to do that since the raid setup changes from 2/3/5 to 3/3/4, thus requiring your dpsers to do more dps per person to beat the boss before enrage) Other thing was, blizz implemented some QoL changes, so the game was actually less time consuming (for some people having easier entry level gear = easier game, I personally don't think that time consuming means difficult).  Now let's sum it up. Game got a bit harder, especially in the healing departament. The casual 10-mans from WotLK are gone, replaced by much more difficult raids. There is much less content (much of the resources went into the 1-60 zone revamp) and game is bit less time consuming. The casuals who are the majority of wow subs have nearly nothing to do in the game after they reach level 85. The casual 10-man guilds needed to either step up their game or have a very frustrating experience. Wrathbabies start crying in the forums, and since they make up the majority of the playerbase (remember how the subscriber count skyrocketed during WotLK?) blizzard has to adjust for that in their design philosophy, so they don't lose customers. The final boss of the next raid tier was pretty amazing though (seriously check it out : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez1pRo1sywY ), the rest of the tier was pretty meh. As was the tier later. While heroic ragnaros was pretty OMG kind of difficult, they difficulty of the dragon soul tier was pretty much ""annoying"" kind of difficult. They also introduced LFR, which is a 3rd difficulty (below normal) that is meant for people using LFD tool. Basically AFKfest and really hard to wipe on it. People who can't raid are finally able to enjoy some of it, yay. I overally liked the xpac thats why i play it again on a priv server.  I feel the hate isn't justified, but I would agree that it turned worse later on. For non-raiders the the xpac was pretty mediocre though."
wowservers,371h7u,AbareKiller,2,Sun May 24 02:25:21 2015 UTC,This pretty much. And the heroic people are doing right now on Atlantiss are already post nerf. 4.0.6a brought in a bunch of nerfs to Cata heroics to tone down the difficulty

wowservers,371h7u,gokdoi,3,Sun May 24 14:04:03 2015 UTC,"I'd choose Atlantiss also, I'd say it's about 85% blizzlike. You will occasionally note differences to retail (""why is this caster not moving?""), but overall their scripting is great. All dungeons from level 15 to 85 work more or less blizzlike. They didn't simply put some mobs in there which do nothing but auto attacks, nearly everything is scripted. All old raids but Sunwell are working, too, I've read.  Classes are very good. There are some small things here and there, but if somebody reports an important bug it often gets fixed on the same day.  I'd say it's a matter of perspective: compared to retail you will note differences. But compared to other servers where many quests are set to auto complete, some dungeons don't work at all and others have mobs in them but they do nothing but auto attacks Atlantiss scripting is fantastic."

It has rates x1, but you can get x3 if you play with a friend (Recruit A Friend)"

wowservers,371tj8,Hamishator,3,Sun May 24 01:54:51 2015 UTC,"It's a neat idea. I had the idea about a server where everyone starts the same level and the same gear (low) and then there're instantiated matches - battlegrounds, arenas and dungeons like you described - you get better gear during the fight for taking objectives/winning matches/completing time challenges/killing difficult bosses and you're just getting rank like in moba's. The idea is that you have the same conditions to fight whether you just joined today or playing the game for years. Or playing casually.  Outside of the matches/bgs/arenas/dungeons, you still keep your original low gear, although you can transmog(only visual change) it to whatever you achieved to obtain in the matches. That way you can still be ""progressing"", showing off your gear, but only as a visual enhancement.  Oh only if I had the time to program such thing."

We are a relatively new server, based on the 1.12.1 patch (Classic WoW), however we may expand to other expansions in the future.  We currently have two realms, Crossroads, which is a 1x rates blizzlike server, and Carnage, which is an instant 60 PvP server.  Unfortunately Carnage is not quite ready for full release, you can play on it if you want, although we believe that it is not ready for players.  Crossroads is ready to play on, with no major bugs that would harm your experience, as a matter of fact, a member of staff was able to level to 60 without experiencing any issues.  We believe that we can provide an experience at the same level of Nostalrius or Kronos.  We have a dedicated staff team which includes 8 people which are located in different areas of the world, and therefore at least one person will be online to help you at any time of day.  So what are you waiting for, come and join us today.  link: http://nephilimwow.org/news  -Thanks for reading this  Senior Gamemaster Sevren"

The one thing you must decide is the content to play. Love first parts of a game chain, beginning of a story? Choose Vanilla AKA Classic WoW. While most popular and casual-hardcore balanced expansion is WotLK. While everything after Cata is a very-very boring and simple-as-for-complete-idiots (for a long time after start), there're some nice things for newbies there as well. Awesome Worgen starting campaign, for example. But that's 0.001% of the game, so I won't recommend Cata+ just because of it.  Personally I would really like to see newbies in my guild (<Roar>) on Kronos (Vanilla) - as many as possible - but that's rather far-from-subject answer :D"

The newer one (posted in February) looks like it actually works but based on the comments and stuff from the second one, it seems like the same crap I downloaded. It has the colors and looks but has 1000 bugs.  Reading further I found this.   Your ElvUI Download for 3.3.5a is actually TukUI. Even though made by the same author they are quite different UI's. I've been looking for 3.3.5a version for ElvUI and was so excited to see this. So disappointed now.   Taken directly from the comments, which is exactly what I remember. TukUI is great but took way to much work in LUA settings outside of the game to get to work properly so I never liked it. The way I see it, the first official working ElvUI for 3.3.5 (other than the original) is this new one posted in February. Again though, thank you for the links.  And thank you for the hostility when asked a simple question."

I vote for TBC as well - really good lore connections with Warcraft III, more specs become playable, raid size adjusted so more people can actually raid...   The one thing which is really bad in WotLK is that one patch is killing the previous, IMHO. And flight-mount-for-everyone is not good too.  But I play Vanilla atm, since TBC p-servers are said to be not better than so-so, and also I've ran all TBC in a fan 70-80 guild on retail in a MoP days, so TBC adventure is a bit spoiled for me."

wowservers,36y8by,jetsfan07,0,Sat May 23 17:36:10 2015 UTC,"That actually does sound pretty cool.  It's going to require a lot of balance between character and environment.  Vanilla WoW would be near impossible to complete with this mechanic because dying at level 20 would mean losing near 10+ hours of playtime.  The biggest thing would be making it easier to get back to where you were.  Here are the design considerations:   Make the dying process not as harsh - In a permadeath game, making the player feel as though they lost dozens of hours of work is not a way to entice them to come back after dying.  For example, if you die in DayZ, you are only a few hours or so from getting most, if not all, of your progress back.  This entices players to come back after death. Making death fair - In Vanilla WoW, death can happen frequently that feels like it isn't your fault.  A mob respawning behind you can join your fight and you can get overwhelmed very quickly resulting in a death if you aren't a class capable of kiting or healing.   Here are some changes that I, personally, would make considering both of the two above principles and preserving the mechanics of WoW:   Eliminate Player Levels - This allows no barrier to getting back into the game.  While it sounds harsh reading it alone, consider the below mechanics before dismissing this. Gear Based Progression - All of the stats are solely from gear.  Each zone has a range of gear balanced with the monsters that guard it.  If you follow the natural progression of the game, the gear you get at the end of a zone should be slightly better than the initial gear you get from the next zone.  This gives players a choice to either stay in the same zone to get a bit overpowered, or leave the zone for a greater challenge in the next.  This allows players to go back to a previous zone if they are struggling or stick it out and hopefully not die. Questing System Rework - Since experience points are no longer required, the number of quests can be reduced.  This allows for larger, bigger quest chains that have a story build up and climax.  i.e. ridding the centaurs from the barrens.  You first have to investigate what is going on, make preperations, poison the food supply, take out several generals, and then kill the leader.  The quests leading up to this can yield smaller rewards, such as patterns, buff food, or potions, while the main quest results in a piece of gear that makes the player a lot more powerful. More Dynamic Loot - Adding a lot of rewards to finding chests or killing rare mobs on a spawn timer.  This is pretty self explanatory.  The loot gathered from this should not overpower the player, but only give them a slight upgrade to make seeking them out worth it in order to tackle more difficult quests. All Trainers Cannot Teach All Spells - Zones should have elite trainers in them that teach the player advanced skills.  Since there are no more levels, there is no way to gate the abilities you gain.  They should be added to a reworked skill tree, or have several of them as a reward to a quest from a ""grand master trainer"" where they all have similar goals (King Raptor Head, Elite Bear fur, etc.) that make players work together despite class differences. Remove Spell Levels - Make them all scale with stats instead of raw power.  For example, your fireball now does 1.3x your int instead of X amount of damage.  There is no need to make spell levels, althogh this is not as simple as stated and has to be done on a case by case basis.  However, it allows for a fully gear based progression system. Open Profession System - Make the player only have to choose between tailoring, leatherworking, and blacksmithing.  All players can now create buff potions, gear enchants, and engineering recipies.  This lets players that put the work in to these professions have an easier time of dealing with their current gear setup.  It lets the player make content easier based on how much they prepared for an encounter.  If I have good gear already, maybe I only need a protection potion as a cloth wearer to make up for armor loss while fighting melee oponents, or if I have a melee focused class I can create bombs that slow or stun the mob in order to catch up to them at range, etc. Redo Profession Levels - Squash the overall amount of levels so that even if the player is new they can make a lot of items, but if they invest a lot of time into their profession they feel rewarded for that.  Death Tax for Bank Loot - Allow players to signify an alt, or any other player, to get their cache of items back after death.  Tax the inheritance so that the returning players still have to put in effort in order to get back to where they were, but still have resources to get back faster.  This has to be balanced on the amount of gold the player has, it is almost like an exponential where if you have 500 gold you keep 250, but if you have 1000 you only keep 350-400.  This gives people with large amounts of gold a chance to get back into the action with a new character without making them overpowered too quickly and still giving death weight.   There are a lot of other things that need to be done, but I don't feel like typing anymore.  Please feel free to add or comment on any of the changes.  This is only for discussion, but I am interested to see what others have to say."

A person can answer a specific question about a specific quest or spell, maybe, but the OP will require months of training in order to comprehend what is actually being done.  You can't just download mangos core, compile it, and then start asking quesitions like this.

MoP: I've tried to find a decent MoP server myself in the last couple of days, but so far all I've encountered were lacking in one regard or the other. I'd say they're about 60% blizzlike right now.

I'm slowly leveling a toon on there but I have my main servers I play on now and that is just a side project to experience it and see how it progresses in case one day it does consistently get more population.  Problem is that there are highly populated TBC servers already.  The reason Nostalrius and Kronos landed as much population on their vanilla opening was due to a whole slew of problems associated with the competition.  Rebirth going down, Feenix being Feenix, Valkyrie being too custom.   Vengeance just didn't have that same flow going for it.  Competition is too strong."
wowservers,36vzdp,dungeonjay,5,Fri May 22 17:40:56 2015 UTC,"It's low pop because it's low pop.  It's a great server though with a good dev team. The community is small but friendly, it's unfortunate that the size has been such a deterrent. It sounds counter-intuitive, but in a lot of ways the social aspect of the game is even better (to me) on Vengeance than with a giant population, since everyone knows everyone and relies on eachother for the limited number of mats/professions/etc.   If you value great scripting and a friendly community over sheer numbers, it's absolutely the best TBC server out there right now. It's also a great time to get started since Kara is gearing up for release and there's no real endgame rush right now. Level up at your leisure, join some heroics. No pressure just lots of fun TBC stuff."

wowservers,36vsof,coolfangs,6,Fri May 22 15:42:06 2015 UTC,Yes but I am afraid that wouldn't really be viable on the dev side. Staying on the same patch will make sure we can provide a better quality world with more bug fixes. There is a lot we have already done to make the world more similar to how it was during Vanilla. This also makes sure we have something unique to distinguish from other servers.
wowservers,36vsof,Silez,1 point,Fri May 22 16:28:46 2015 UTC,This is true since legacy content is made easier after every expansion. The experience just wouldn't be the same.

wowservers,36vsof,demerda,1 point,Fri May 22 17:54:34 2015 UTC,"Yes. Crestfall. We've been working at preparing it sometime. We've built a framework that supports 1.12 to 6.x (Yes, it's actually in-game with WoD). We've been working to present 1x progression on a non-mangos emulator, and plan to have it running in beta for 1x Soonâ¢(We're working to finish 1 - 20 content at least, maybe 1 - 30, before the beta). We will also be progressing as the player base progresses. If MC is on farm, it won't be more than a few months till BWL. We won't be splitting up the content based on the actual splits Blizzard did with patches. The only things that will ""take longer"" will be the actual expansions as they will need to be tested on PTR as that time closes in.  -- Edit -- I just noticed you're only using a 335 client and not progressing through each client individually like us, so technically you are the first of your kind(I believe?)"
wowservers,36vsof,srb1630,1 point,Sat May 23 08:48:10 2015 UTC,Interesting but we will indeed be on the 335 client so it will be different. We also wouldn't move on to Cataclysm as our target audience believes WoW went downwards from there.

wowservers,36ve7l,krugmik,1 point,Fri May 22 14:20:10 2015 UTC,"This is correct.  It gets especially faster when you can AoE grind, but until then go crush a few seasons of a TV show."

From there, you can fill out Prot or go back into Holy for Divine Favor. I prefer a 21/25+5 build because it gives me the freedom to tank, heal, and PvP. It plays to the strengths of the class.  I don't think Ret is a good leveling spec because it's too gear dependent and SoC has an unreliable proc rate. In fact, I don't think Ret is a good spec, period.

wowservers,36ukp4,phorecast,2,Fri May 22 06:29:17 2015 UTC,Which expansion do you want to play?
wowservers,36ukp4,_RaoulDuke,1 point,Fri May 22 06:30:42 2015 UTC,I've never played WOW before so I have no idea.  Whatever you think would be the most fun.
wowservers,36ukp4,_RaoulDuke,8,Fri May 22 06:31:50 2015 UTC,"You will often hear in this sub that the newer expansions made the game easier/more casual/babymode. To clarify this, here is a quick (inclomplete) overview of what we mean:  Vanilla: The original game (Lvl cap: 60). Slow leveling, mounts available at lvl 40, epic (=faster) mount at lvl 60, but at a huge cost. You will spend a lot of time searching for questgivers and quest objectives (both ingame and on the internet). No flying mounts, lots of traveling involved because flightpaths (= fast travel) are sparse, you have to actually ride to the dungeons to do them. You have to find a parties for quests/dungeons by asking in chat. Battlegrounds (large scale PVP from 10v10 to 40v40) are available from NPCs in the capital cities. Raids are up to 40 man.  Burning Crusade (TBC): First expansion (lvl cap 70), introduces a new ""continent"" (Outland) where flying is possible at lvl 70, the old world is unchanged (no flying there). Adds meeting stones to dungeons (allows summoning players so only two people have to go there), and party finder to innkeepers. Leveling from 60 to 70 is streamlined, questgivers are now displayed on the minimap. Arenas (small scale PVP from 2v2 to 5v5) are added. Maximum raid size reduced to 25.  Wrath of the Lich King (WOTLK): Second expansion (lvl cap 80), introduces new continent (Northrend, old world remains still unchanged. Adds the RDF (Random Dungeon Finder), that allows you to queue for dungoens anywhere in the world. When the group is ready, you are teleported to the dungeon, when the dungoen is finished you get teleported back to where you were before. Arguably the biggest convenience change, as you can now theoretically can lvl to 80 without questing. Mounts are available at lvl 20.  Cataclysm: Third expansion (lvl cap 85). Some new areas, but no real new continent. Old world is overhauled, resulting in leveling from 1-60 becoming much faster, as questing is streamlined and you have more flightpaths. Quest objectives are shown on the map (no more searching/exploration). Flying is allowed everywhere. As classes became too complicated (each expansion added talents and skills) they are overhauled by removing/changing skills and simplifying the talent trees.  In the end, what you find fun, is up to you. Vanilla is very enjoyable, the things described here as ""inconvenience"" are a big part of the gameplay and the feel (e.g. riding through hostile territory to get to a dungeon). But I can understand people with being fed up with being ganked on their way as well.  I wont go into Mists of Pandaria (haven't played) and Warlords of Dreanor (no servers yet). I left out some minor changes, e.g. fishing anywhere, no more obscure trainer locations (hello Uldaman) and many more. This should give you an overview of what to expect non the less. Please feel free to add any major changes I forgot."
wowservers,36ukp4,Mephea,3,Fri May 22 09:45:22 2015 UTC,"Good reply, but, come on man. You clearly don't like vanilla do you? Or at least the 'inconvenience' factors in it?  I liked 'having to' search for quest givers, made me explore the world instead of following some preplanned questing route that's in Cata.   I also didn't feel like I 'had to' ride to dungeons to do them. That was just more exploring I got to do. And my first experience with RDF was one of those late Wrath instances that were in that Arthas' citadel. We wiped, respawned miles away and I didn't have a clue where the instance was. Hated it.  Anyway, just rambling, my bad if I misunderstood what you said."

wowservers,36ukp4,_RaoulDuke,1 point,Fri May 22 10:00:35 2015 UTC,"I actually do like Vanilla quite a lot. Might be the way I wrote it down, I tried to be objective. The interpretation should be with the reader.  E.g.:   You will spend a lot of time searching for questgivers and quest objectives (both ingame and on the internet).   I didn't say this is good or bad. This is what I actually did when I first played Vanilla. I didn't even know Thottbot existed, and this was ages before Jame's guides were available, so I spend ages looking for quest loot (which didn't sparkle...). You get to explore the world and you have to read the quests. You actually feel a sense of accomplishment when you finally complete a quest.  In Cata, I would switch of my brain while leveling, just going into criuse control.  I just wanted to do a quick writeup explaining the ""the new expansions are easymode"" that is thrown around a lot in this sub. I have edited my previous post."

wowservers,36ukp4,dungeonjay,2,Fri May 22 11:41:25 2015 UTC,"Right.  But MMO was just dawning into mainstream at that time.  Look at the mmo's on the market today.  Easy to quest, easy to level, updated pathing, streamlined dungeons.  Some are even just capital city port to dungeon style mmos(Neverwinter MMO, DnD MMO comes to mind).  IMO, each mmo that comes out takes the best ideas(usually) and tries to implement them even if they aren't the best MMOs for other reasons."
wowservers,36ukp4,KnaxxLive,1 point,Fri May 22 14:10:28 2015 UTC,"Except that none of these even scrape the subscriber base that WoW had in Vanilla.  It shows that people were more willing to go to that MMO despite there being many others in the market.  Granted, Vanilla WoW is older and follows many older design principles, but it still holds up extremely well as a game.  I am truly thankful to the people at Nost (and Kronos, though I don't play there) that they are willing to go against all odds to provide us with an insanely accurate emulation of, what could be, the best game of all time.  I could go into what makes a game a great game, but then my post would be entirely too long and I have to get back to work."
wowservers,36ukp4,dungeonjay,2,Fri May 22 14:20:57 2015 UTC,"They also landed the playerbase first.  It was a new era of gaming online.  Everquest was around but it didn't get the hype because Blizzard had set the foundation for great games before such as Diablo which made a port onto the Playstation which increased the overall knowledge of Blizzard as a company.  PC gamers knew about Blizzard way before World of Warcraft came out.  That hype surrounded it from previous works; Starcraft, Warcraft, etc.  It also helped that we entered a new age of affordable PCs right around that time.  Every single family owned a PC in their house.  This paved the way for a lot of people to start looking into PC gaming.  The recipe was right, the storm came in and that name was Blizzard.  So, I ask you this question.  We take away World of Warcraft....it doesn't exist.  Blizzard never made it.  Out comes in 2015 the Vanilla Blizzard MMO.  Does it see the same popularity surge?"
wowservers,36ukp4,KnaxxLive,1 point,Fri May 22 14:51:50 2015 UTC,"I can't answer this particular hypothetical question.    The trends in gaming have differed over the past 10 years.  From the way they are played to the way they look. Knowing this, Blizzard would not have released Vanilla WoW today.  Also, trends in MMOs would not be set and we can not consider the effects of other MMOs on the 2015 version of Vanilla as the entire MMO architecture would have changed.  It's almost like a butterfly effect.  We can agree that WoW was a great game in 2005.  It really set the stage for the future of MMOs, albeit they are all pretty shit, but it still founded and set core design principles.  You can ask this same question about any other game though.  Would street Fighter, or Mario Kart still be considered a good game and see popularity surge?  They both did the same thing that WoW did.  They set the standard for their genre and without them we would not have all the spin off games today."

wowservers,36ukp4,dungeonjay,4,Fri May 22 09:01:28 2015 UTC,"I'd stick with Dalaran. Imo a good choice. You get to do all the old quests (pre cata) without being ganked every 2 minutes, and afaik the population is about 1k during EU peak time."
wowservers,36ukp4,dungeonjay,2,Fri May 22 09:22:48 2015 UTC,Dalaran is a great starting expansion.  Look for a friend to level with so you can do the RaF tool and get x3 experience rate.
wowservers,36ukp4,Dirtnose,2,Fri May 22 14:14:31 2015 UTC,"You already have several suggestions listed for you.  Depending on how much time you have to invest and play on the game may dictate which version to play.  Here is the short list to understanding that:    Vanilla- Longer time to level, raiding/dungeons takes longer, have to que in capital cities or certain way points for battlegrounds    TBC - Added meeting stones for summoning(speed up dungeons/raids a little), leveling slightly easier, still have to que in capital cities for battlegrounds      Wrath - Added Random Dungeon Finder(matchmaking for dungeons and battlegrounds), easiest leveling experience.      The reason I don't suggest higher is because if you pick any of those three expansions you will get to enjoy the original wow lore.  Once you go beyond that the world has changed and the questlines are different."
wowservers,36ukp4,dungeonjay,2,Fri May 22 14:05:37 2015 UTC,"Go and play on retail if you have never played WoW before.

wowservers,36ukp4,Dirtnose,1 point,Fri May 22 14:48:35 2015 UTC,I can't agree with that sentiment at all.  The main reason being that WoD is not World of Warcraft.  That MMO they have you paying for is a mediocre version of what WoW was about.  The reason they just bleed out almost 3 million subscribers in less than 3 months should speak volumes in itself.  Those lingering subscribers are too attached to their characters to let go(I would say 75%).  But that isn't to say there isn't room for your statement to be just as valid as mine.  Just my opinion on the current state of the retail version.
wowservers,36ukp4,dungeonjay,0,Fri May 22 18:00:43 2015 UTC,"""I can't agree with that sentiment at all. The main reason being that WoD is not World of Warcraft.

OP has never played the game before, he should play the retail version and form his own opinion before playing on a private server. I prefer current WoW to Vanilla WoW, everyone has different tastes/opinions.  ""The reason they just bleed out almost 3 million subscribers in less than 3 months should speak volumes in itself.""  That's for lack of content, specifically end game content. Patch 6.1 was a joke and the huge breaks between patches has caused this massive drop. Again though, OP has never played the real thing before, so he has all of the content (5 expansions worth) to experience for the first time. He won't be at end game WoD content for at LEAST a few months, and even then he still has ALL the other expansion content to enjoy. He should at least give it a chance."
wowservers,36ukp4,DrearyYew,1 point,Fri May 22 18:05:39 2015 UTC,They also ruined profressions.  Ruined farming old raid content.  Lowered drop rates.  The list can go on to what I feel like they have done wrong.  If the OP wants to try out retail then that is his ever right to do so.  I'm just not going to not tell the OP that it isn't water downed WoW that he will have to pay for.
wowservers,36ukp4,DrearyYew,2,Fri May 22 18:23:04 2015 UTC,"Vanilla - Nostalrius  TBC - Nothing worth your time at the moment, check Corecraft when it eventually comes out  WotLK - Dalaran for PvE or Gamer District for PvP  Cata - Atlantiss  For a new player, I would recommend Cata, it is probably the most new-player friendly expansion, especially since Cata completely revamped the 1-60 leveling zones. Behind that I would recommend WotLK, but I would avoid Vanilla at all costs unless you really enjoy the grind. If you have played other modern MMOs, a lot of the game mechanics of vanilla will feel extremely dated and archaic. With that said, there is still a ton of fun to be had in Vanilla, and the community you get out of vanilla is bar none.  Of these servers, Nostalrius is the most populated, and it looks like it will be for a long while. The only thing I could see that would surpass it would be the Corecraft release."
wowservers,36ukp4,Mephea,2,Fri May 22 06:59:37 2015 UTC,"I also don't think OP would enjoy a small population that is incredibly fragile given Nostalrius' overwhelming success over Kronos. Ganking and getting ganked are a huge part of the Vanilla experience, and while it sucks to be on the receiving end, it only makes it that much better to get to max level and return the favor if you see fit. Kronos' population just isn't capable of providing the full experience. I would definitely take Nostalrius' oversaturated experience over a less fulfilling experience."
wowservers,36ukp4,AbareKiller,4,Fri May 22 08:47:46 2015 UTC,"You know, whatever you consider 'full vanilla experience"", is not necessarily what everybody else thinks. To me it means doing whatever there is to do in azeroth, and if I hit 60, I don't feel like I've missed something if I didn't get ganked 150 times along the way. In fact, it's the exact opposite, but that's just me.  For some people playing with 7.5k other players enhances the experience, for some people it ruins it."
wowservers,36ukp4,Vpos,3,Fri May 22 08:56:45 2015 UTC,"Realisticly, Kronos actually has the better ""real vanilla experience"", as max server pop was around 2k in retail. 7.5k players like on Nos creates a lot of problem, as the spawn rate remains retail like, while the population is tripled, which creates a shit ton of bottleneck in an already slow leveling experience.  Inb4 Kronos fanboi claims. I don't play on either server"
wowservers,36ukp4,nimeral,1 point,Fri May 22 09:43:23 2015 UTC,"You can play on many server as other people described here, they are great but you will never have that experience as on retail.

Just keep in mind they add conveniences the higher you go up in those three expansions and your gameplay will be drastically different from each."

Cata(4 expansion) is more new player friendly but you will get good WoW feeling with 3(WOTLK). Anyway, every server has bugs, some more than other so expect them and I would agree with dungeonjay on serers. If you don't mid language you can go WoW Circle. Its the biggest WoW private server with decent scripts on some servers."
wowservers,36ux36,Somnu,-4,Fri May 22 15:40:24 2015 UTC,Join kronos our population is slowly dying since most retards go where the rest of the flock is and play on nostalrius. I heard that nostalrius is so bugged that 90% of quests over lvl 30 don't work. Kronos is much better cause we have instant 60 option via character auction if you get bored with leveling.  Our population is low because we don't use bots to inflate our numbers.
wowservers,36ux36,Mephea,3,Fri May 22 13:12:33 2015 UTC,"Can people please stop spreading rumours like this? I tend to recommend Kronos for people purely because the quality is higher and because I don't think ""the more people the better"", but saying 90% of quests past lvl 30 are bugged is just bs.

You will get a base gear and level assessed off what you have accomplished in Excalibur.  You won't get the same gold transferred as well.  There are several variables here.  You just cannot pickup the same character and toss him around these servers.  (Not usually; there have been exceptions).  I wish you luck in your adventures but really you will probably need to make a character on each expansion server and play it out.

You can either choose to play on their 7x rates community servers (peaks 3k+), or on the instant 80 realm, which peaks at around 800 (purely arena/bg and widely considered more competitive).  The overall scripting (raids, questing, other pve stuff) is rather lackluster, but it is your best option for PVP."

In the same way that there are many brands selling the same product, thus there will be many servers of the same expansion."

wowservers,36rmq7,Cover25,2,Thu May 21 22:08:09 2015 UTC,If you really cared about the WOTLK community you'd join your devs with another great organisation. Your plan involves taking people from other servers which never really works out well.
wowservers,36rmq7,DrearyYew,2,Fri May 22 01:46:41 2015 UTC,"The only real alternative I see is waiting until Dalaran's progression cycle has ended after ICC has been open for a while, then releasing your server. The problem with this is that Dalaran can just as easily open a brand new WotLK progressive server, which would not only generate massive amounts of hype if they get the word out properly based on their track record, but would also continue to improve on their already nearly flawless scripts.  I know this isn't what you want to hear, but honestly your best bet is to try to join one of the other development teams. Dalaran is the gold standard as far as WotLK servers go, and if you're committed to WotLK development, I would try to get in on it.  However, you could use your server as a side project to help your resume to get into one of the bigger name projects. If what you are able to create is strong enough, you could easily find yourself on a larger development team.  We also really don'y need any more 3.3.5a servers, there are new 3.3.5a servers that pop up every day.  I wish you the best of luck."

wowservers,36rfui,Blujay12,1 point,Thu May 21 18:13:51 2015 UTC,"Greetings  I am Senior Gamemaster Sevren from NephilimWoW.  We are a relatively new server, based on the 1.12.1 patch (Classic WoW), however we may expand to other expansions in the future.  We currently have two realms, Crossroads, which is a 1x rates blizzlike server, and Carnage, which is an instant 60 PvP server.  Unfortunately Carnage is not quite ready for full release, you can play on it if you want, although we believe that it is not ready for players.  Crossroads is ready to play on, with no major bugs that would harm your experience, as a matter of fact, a member of staff was able to level to 60 without experiencing any issues.  We believe that we can provide an experience at the same level of Nostalrius or Kronos.  We have a dedicated staff team which includes 8 people which are located in different areas of the world, and therefore at least one person will be online to help you at any time of day.  So what are you waiting for, come and join us today.  link: http://nephilimwow.org/news  -Thanks for reading this  Senior Gamemaster Sevren"

wowservers,36oguz,Ichiwalley,2,Wed May 20 21:44:15 2015 UTC,"I'd just go with a mage. Makes up for lack of gear with the control you get with frost spec. And surely your son would like gnomes?   If you want to go with a dwarf, then I'd recommend a rogue. Shadow priests are good 1vs1, but imo rather easily countered if you just know what you're doing (like using viper sting as a hunter instead of serpent) and fighting multiple people / in a group can be difficult because of mana problems (absolutely drives me nuts as I rolled a priest on Nos, but what can you do).   But, I don't personally really like vanilla rogues either. They go from being awesome if they have all cd's and get first hit, to absolute shit if they don't get first hit (I know stealth blahblah) and have no cd's.   How about a hunter? Easy levelling and you could be a dwarf as well.  But whatever you choose, don't forget engineering. And damn, you're making me want to lvl on Nos with the same attitude :).  Edit: Just read your last sentence again. So do you want to be ""the alliance world pvp hero. When shits poppin' off, I want to be there and save the day"" or go horde and join the ""ganking, griefing and general douche baggery""?"

wowservers,36oguz,dungeonjay,1 point,Thu May 21 20:56:21 2015 UTC,Spec as a priest healer....raid to get the gear you need then switch to either disc or shadow.  You will be an unstoppable death dealing survive anything machine.  To be an effective shadow priest you will need gear....it is gear dependant but the dps is low in raid settings and you will be hard pressed to find a spot to raid in...disc priests also don't have the healing burst power of a full on holy healer.  Probably wanna spec something like 21/30/0 to begin with.
wowservers,36oguz,dungeonjay,2,Thu May 21 00:32:12 2015 UTC,"As a spriest you will destroy anyone less geared than you(usually) in vanilla.  But, since you would be rolling a heal class, I suggest going for the best gear you can get as a healer at first from raiding.  From your statement, you want to be able to take more than one person at a time.  The spriest becomes extemely OP the better the gear and you will find yourself surviving against 2 or 3 people at a time."
wowservers,36oguz,dungeonjay,1 point,Thu May 21 12:39:25 2015 UTC,"I play spriest, lock and rogue on vanilla servers.  Sometimes a paladin just for reckoning bombs in pvp.  Out of all of them(can't speak for mage since I don't play it in vanilla), I found that the rogue needs the least amount of gear attention to kill a player(as long as you follow your cooldowns correctly).  I enjoy the spriest the most because of the ability to do a little healing as well.  I think it would come down to preference.  What style you want to go with.  A blue/ZG spriest will do just fine in most normal world pvp settings to answer your question."
wowservers,36oguz,LlamaOfGod,1 point,Thu May 21 12:51:10 2015 UTC,"World PvP on Nost boils down to killing undergeared/underleveled players in overcrowded zones. As such, rogue is your best bet.

We currently have two realms, Crossroads, which is a 1x rates blizzlike server, and Carnage, which is an instant 60 PvP server.  Unfortunately Carnage is not quite ready for full release, you can play on it if you want, although we believe that it is not ready for players.  Crossroads is ready to play on, with no major bugs that would harm your experience, as a matter of fact, a member of staff was able to level to 60 without experiencing any issues.  We believe that we can provide an experience at the same level of Nostalrius or Kronos.  We have a dedicated staff team which includes 8 people which are located in different areas of the world, and therefore at least one person will be online to help you at any time of day.  So what are you waiting for, come and join us today.  link: http://nephilimwow.org/news  -Thanks for reading this  Senior Gamemaster Sevren"
wowservers,36l6uh,Nephilim-GM-Sevren,0,Wed May 27 11:48:38 2015 UTC,"It depends what your after and what expansion you prefer.  If you want well developed content then you're looking at Kronos for Vanilla, Dalaran-WoW for WotLK and Atlantiss for Cata. However each of these are 1x.  I'm currently playing Dalaran and having a blast, as if I'd just joined WoW. I love it."
wowservers,36l6uh,FreakishHero,1 point,Wed May 20 07:51:39 2015 UTC,"Excalibur is one of the best scripted TBC servers. though last weeks it have had a lot of new players joining from other private server and hitting server-cap (2k) during peak hours. With that increased number there have been some laggissues and some server-shutdowns, but soon they will have that fixed again so it can go back to normal. It's never down for more than 5-10min"
wowservers,36l6uh,Neyvon,0,Wed May 20 13:08:09 2015 UTC,what is are the best ones?   Who knows. They all lie about /who results. I've seen servers claim 50k+ players logged on at once. Vanilla is a small world compared to TBC/WotLK. It can't fit more than 3k players.  Do you want to trust your character with a server that would lie?  At the end of the day they're all equally bad. It's the unfortunate truth.
wowservers,36l6uh,hdgh63263,2,Wed May 20 05:48:22 2015 UTC,"Nostalrius has a steady 6k, no queue or anything"
wowservers,36l6uh,arcalite911,-2,Wed May 20 12:17:48 2015 UTC,Which is why it's totally unplayable unless you like competing for quest mobs.
wowservers,36l6uh,LlamaOfGod,3,Wed May 20 15:03:38 2015 UTC,I'm level 23 on nostal and having a blast! If you're having difficulty join a guild with players similar to your level or join a party to down the quests faster.
wowservers,36l6uh,daberu,2,Wed May 20 21:46:56 2015 UTC,I find that playing solo in vanilla was very very hard...the more the merrier!
wowservers,36l6uh,arcalite911,0,Wed May 20 16:52:09 2015 UTC,I never did the cata thing so I started a warlock on atlantiss. It isn't bad at all. The servers though seem to go down every few hrs or so other than that I haven't found anything to complain about.
wowservers,36l6uh,Infernoplex,-1,Wed May 20 06:04:47 2015 UTC,"I've only recently got into private servers and tried both nost and kronos. Nost has a huge population but there are a lot of bugs the second you start poking the surface a bit. Kronos feels more ""healthy"" for a lack of a better term."
wowservers,36l6uh,alexhjelm,-1,Thu May 21 04:17:36 2015 UTC,"It is http://www.kronos-wow.com/ for sure, no other server can ever compare."
wowservers,36ksse,Acisao,6,Wed May 20 02:52:53 2015 UTC,"I can't go 5 minutes without getting ganked. I'm okay with wpvp, but the population on Nost is just ridiculous."
wowservers,36ksse,Silez,4,Wed May 20 14:45:48 2015 UTC,Molten. Sadly the population is the only thing going for it.
wowservers,36ksse,Cyndikate,-4,Wed May 20 05:21:54 2015 UTC,Sounds just like Nostralrius
wowservers,36ksse,mixd3,2,Wed May 20 11:45:50 2015 UTC,"should I tell people how Kronos had a raid-ID reset bug so a few guilds could do Onyxia and MC more than 1nce a week? And over 40 lv60s got banned due to Kronos's raid bug and players being able to exploit it? Oh wait, I just did... Kronos fanboys need a taste of their own medicine"
wowservers,36ksse,proteinbarskek,1 point,Wed May 20 22:38:42 2015 UTC,Wasn't that nostalrius? and what? O_O How can those idiots ban people with their already dead population?
wowservers,36ksse,skyracer500,1 point,Thu May 21 18:31:18 2015 UTC,"nope... on Kronos, there was an NA guild named Volatile (which was really an amalgamation of several smaller NA raiding guilds). This raid guild was Horde. I don't know how Kronos does it, but somehow MC reset so the guild could do it more than once a week. The guild made a ticket, the GMs didn't respond to it (one said he didn't see it at all), and the Kronos team decided to ban over 40 lv60 players for 2 weeks and also take away some of their gear.   Google ""Twinstar forums: Id like to share a story, a Kronos story."" There was a lot of drama on the server's foums due to the magnitude of the ban (and supposed injustice of the GMs)"
wowservers,36ksse,proteinbarskek,2,Thu May 21 19:55:35 2015 UTC,I really don't get this at all anymore. I have a level 60 on nost finally and I really don't see what is wrong with it. Everything I have done works even scripts such as the final encounter of sunken temple or the rend fight in ubrs.. It's all there. I have yet to do a raid besides onyxia (which also worked perfectly) but do people really still say that the server is bad?
wowservers,36ksse,phausen,2,Wed May 20 16:02:02 2015 UTC,It's just Kronos shills. People will always hate on a server doing better than the one they prefer.
wowservers,36ksse,pikunul,1 point,Wed May 20 16:34:10 2015 UTC,Ignore them lol. Level 50 here and I've only experienced a couple bugged quests over many days of playing.
wowservers,36ksse,Link_Unit,0,Wed May 20 18:10:12 2015 UTC,At least Nostalrius is better.
wowservers,36ksse,Cyndikate,2,Wed May 20 15:41:46 2015 UTC,"Does not exist.  Populated wrath servers are as follow: Gamer's District, Warmane, Dalaran and Truewow(lowest pop of all four I mentioned)."
wowservers,36ksse,dungeonjay,2,Wed May 20 16:01:47 2015 UTC,"Nost population is not ""good"". It's bloated and 100% unblizzlike. Takes a lot away from the experience."
wowservers,36ksse,wulgpwns,4,Wed May 20 07:08:04 2015 UTC,"No, it would still be too much on a PvE realm. Questing on Nostalrius is a nightmare because there are too many people competing for the same limited pool of quest mobs."
wowservers,36ksse,LlamaOfGod,1 point,Wed May 20 11:12:07 2015 UTC,Get to the upper levels. There's really nothing bloated about it.
wowservers,36ksse,skyracer500,2,Wed May 20 14:42:18 2015 UTC,It can definitely be annoying...
wowservers,36ksse,leetdemon,1 point,Thu May 21 18:31:55 2015 UTC,... Not sure if serious...
wowservers,36ksse,GigaForced,1 point,Wed May 20 08:24:52 2015 UTC,"Dalaran-WoW has 1k pop. Not super good, but it's the best scripted wrath server currently."
wowservers,36ksse,Cover25,4,Wed May 20 14:28:18 2015 UTC,And 1k is during peak hours. I just checked myself and currently (5am server time) it has 550 online.
wowservers,36ksse,WilliamMelvinHicks,3,Wed May 20 03:44:12 2015 UTC,I come from eu-bronzebeard so for me Dalaran WoW is pretty satisfactory. Around 5-10 minute queues in RDF as a DPS. Pretty standard. The server is flawless though.
wowservers,36ksse,FreakishHero,-1,Wed May 20 04:24:21 2015 UTC,"To say its flawless is a OTT compliment in my opinion. Nobody seems to recognize simple faults with the server? The damage is way too high, People were doing 5-6k in Naxx,EoE and VoA before Ulduar was even out? When I leveled there Northrend was practically broken. I think I got about 100-150 quests at most done in the whole of NR? Population isn't as big as people make it out to seem. It's a good server, but flawless? Come on"
wowservers,36ksse,Zylias2,2,Wed May 20 07:49:31 2015 UTC,"5-6k in Naxx pre ulduar is legitimate. I know because I was doing 6.3k on patchwerk, pre ulduar, on a feral, during retail. I do agree though, that the server isn't flawless, it does have it's quirks. Didn't have many issues leveling however. But yeah, it's not perfect, but, I do think it's easily the best 3.3.5 server."
wowservers,36ksse,BoxerBriefly,1 point,Wed May 20 13:27:20 2015 UTC,"Hmm I know when it was happening people were quite shocked, there was up roar on the forums asking for damage to be toned down, but what do I know lol, it seems in this forum if you lay out one truth about a private server all these tin foiled hatted white knights come at you with "" uh stop shit talking the server""  Btw, I'm not calling you one of them but just saying"
wowservers,36ksse,Zylias2,2,Wed May 20 14:43:39 2015 UTC,How did you get 150 quests down in Northrend Lol? I've done 328 quests on my hunter that im currently leveling in northrend. And I can provide screenshots if you like to. Stop shit talking the server.  Also the pop is 1K+ every day with a min of 500~.
wowservers,36ksse,Cover25,0,Wed May 20 15:32:08 2015 UTC,I think I leveled sometime in June 2014 so maybe its fixed. Hope it is fixed. It doesn't seem that active I popped back in about 1-2 months back and didn't seem like 1k nearly
wowservers,36ksse,Zylias2,2,Wed May 20 15:23:58 2015 UTC,"So you're basing your opinion of the server that's changed dramatically after a year of it's launch? That's like saying you don't cell phones because they are all flip phones.  Also to base upon your 'claim' about server population.  http://imgur.com/8Wz7mPi&fsN4YC8  Not even during peak times either.  http://imgur.com/E1rWlA6,gQCFWYr#0  Closer to peak times. Not there yet.  http://imgur.com/DLBZIb3,iNw6Mls  Peak"
wowservers,36ksse,Cover25,1 point,Wed May 20 15:31:04 2015 UTC,Warmane
wowservers,36ksse,pikunul,0,Wed May 20 16:15:44 2015 UTC,"Warname is the worst server. They dont have 20% scripted content from whole WoW. Go and see for yourself. Came back here in two or three years and tell us what's changed.... they will brobaly ""fix""... pets! LoL"
