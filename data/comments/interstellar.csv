interstellar,3e5s78,memebuster,3,Wed Jul 22 04:36:13 2015 UTC,"Well, the idea was to get humanity out of earth, because it will no longer be sutiable for humans. The ""dust"" was killing all crops and would eventually kill corn too. I assume they would have a supply room of corn and a corn farm on such space station, meanwhile they were on route on their new home. The new home was meant to be suitable for them, in all aspects to sustain life. New home, new soil, plant crops, food, oxygen."
interstellar,3e5s78,name-classified,2,Wed Jul 22 04:38:10 2015 UTC,"As other commenters pointed out; the corn was the LAST crop that was now unsustainable. After that, there is no more food. The idea was to find a planet suitable for humans to repopulate and start over. However that was plan B. Plan A was to find a way to traverse gravity and harness it so that human beings could leave earth and make the trip without losing time in doing so. The future humans figured this out when they created the wormhole and built the tesseract for Cooper to relay the equation that solves the gravity problem to Murph that ends up saving humanity all together.  At least... I think thats how it happened."

interstellar,3dq922,jo1993,3,Sat Jul 18 14:27:35 2015 UTC,"The 4th dimension is time and humans Live in this dimension we cannot escape we travel in a straight line. Hypothetical 5 dimensional humans would be able to view time in its true form, all happening at once.   Imagine a being that spends its life traveling down a 2D line and thinks that the world unravels as he travels along this line. but they don't realize that they actually live on a 3D cube that already has a final form and is made of many 2D lines at once."
interstellar,3dq922,sto-ifics42,6,Sat Jul 18 21:07:41 2015 UTC,"This implies the existence of a ""first"" timeline. There was no first timeline. Future humanity created the wormhole and Tesseract to allow present humanity to survive and beget future humanity. Repeat ad infinitum.   This only appears odd from a strictly linear 4D perspective of time (our current view). Interstellar is a movie about higher dimensions, where time works in seemingly paradoxical ways. The events listed above are logically consistent, and form a closed timelike curve consistent with Kip Thorne's work on wormholes.  A more eloquently worded explanation of the above by another unknown Redditor."
interstellar,3dq922,mexter,3,Sat Jul 18 17:39:58 2015 UTC,"Best guess. The wormhole is made by gravity, which can interact between dimensions. They don't go back in time, but rather interact with it via gravity in the same way that we pick up a 3d object and move it somewhere else.  The film doesn't give quite enough information to rule out a paradox, but heavily implies that events happen the way that they happen. For example, Cooper could have tried to change the message from earlier once he realizes he's the ghost, but doesn't. It doesn't occur to him to try, so far as I can tell. So things play out exactly as they did in the beginning.   The others aren't saving humanity. That already happened. They operate on a different dimension and don't think about it in those terms. I'm trying to think of analogies, but they all so far require timekeeping in a conventional sense and I want to eat breakfast."
interstellar,3dq922,stealthymangos,2,Sat Jul 18 14:38:07 2015 UTC,"We are living in 4 dimensions, 3 coordinate dimensions and one time dimension. We are trapped, forever in the present in the time dimension, but we are able to manipulate things in the 3rd. So, if we move into the 5th dimension, it would make sense that we would be able to manipulate this time dimension ( the 4th). It is not a paradox in this version of time travel. In the 5th dimension were able able to say I am always alive, always dead, and always on the computer because my timeline is right in front of me. In this dimension effect can come before cause. The wormhole was always there, because the bulk beings always existed.  Edit: More clarification."
interstellar,3dq922,catchpen,2,Sat Jul 18 16:21:36 2015 UTC,"You have to look at time differently from what we are used to to understand that part of the movie. In a single timeline universe, what happened in the past or present time shows what they did or didn't do in the future since the past already happened.   Example: we know that no-one will create a time machine in the future and go back and kill Hitler before he grows up because we all know he lived well into his adulthood.  Other movie franchises like X-men and Star Trek change the past to create an alternate future; Interstellar doesn't go by those ""rules"" and actually it seems more believable that way."
interstellar,3dq922,skituate,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:14:08 2015 UTC,I don't have an answer. There's a ton in temporal mechanics that I simply don't understand. In Star Trek we call that a temporal paradox.
interstellar,3dq922,analmango,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:35:19 2015 UTC,Self fulfilling paradox. Look it up. Basically it's like the terminator paradox where the original technology to create the machines that would try and usurp humanity was never invented. All technology comes from the terminators that were sent to the past from the future hence they create a self fulfilling paradox.
interstellar,3dq922,austheboss26,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:35:42 2015 UTC,"This is my biggest problem with the movie, but I think I understand why Nolan put this seemingly impossible paradox into it. If the future that Interstellar portrays is an accurate representation of our future we can really see the desperation and the lengths to which humanity must go to save itself.  However, our salvation in the movie entirely depends on (for lack of a better term) an act of God, a true miracle in the form of a worm hole. In all reality our situation on earth is much more desperate than in Interstellar because God doesn't just open up portals to other solar systems, we are truly lost and doomed to die on this rock unless we act now."
