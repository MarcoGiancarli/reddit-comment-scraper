Pixar,3e353n,naynaythewonderhorse,22,Tue Jul 21 16:26:25 2015 UTC,"I hope that this film follows the lead of WALL-E and has large sections that are free of dialogue, as this trailer suggests. To me the ability to convey feeling and elicit emotions in the viewer without dialogue is what separates animation as an art form.  I echo the concerns of others, though, about the character design of the main dinosaur. Hopefully I will come to love him once I see the film."
Pixar,3e353n,dabbling,6,Tue Jul 21 17:53:40 2015 UTC,Had the same Wall-E discussion with my husband last night.  I still contend that Wall-E had some of the best story telling of the last half century and echoed all the best parts of the classic Warner Bros and Disney animated shorts and features.

Pixar,3e353n,MidwesternTransplant,11,Tue Jul 21 19:45:30 2015 UTC,"Still not sold. I don't like how derpy, and undetailed the main dinosaur looks compared to the rest of the environment. It seems very incongruous. Might be because they had to do so much re-writing, they needed to draw new scenes and didn't have time to put the detail into it.   I have high hopes but am still worried. Anything that gets delayed this long with so much re writing is rarely a good sign."
Pixar,3e353n,TheRaven476,15,Tue Jul 21 16:36:59 2015 UTC,"This trailer justifies the animation style. Particularly since this trailer exposes that there will probably be very little dialogue in the film. Expressions will drive the film, and animated dinosaurs can express in ways that realistic dinosaurs can't. Plus, it looks really good in motion and in close-up, which we didn't get before."
Pixar,3e353n,ElderCunningham,3,Tue Jul 21 16:41:54 2015 UTC,"The reason for little dialogue in the trailer is probably because they're still redubbing everything.  IIRC, they fired the voice cast and hired a completely new one not too long ago."
Pixar,3e353n,dabbling,5,Tue Jul 21 17:34:40 2015 UTC,"Source? Don't mean to question you, just genuinely curious. I haven't been following this film's development especially closely."
Pixar,3e353n,ElderCunningham,6,Tue Jul 21 18:03:44 2015 UTC,Here you go.  One of the many sources I found.
Pixar,3e353n,TheAmazingJesusC,0,Tue Jul 21 19:13:46 2015 UTC,"They don't ""redub"" Pixar movies (save for a line in ""A Bug's Life"" that was dubbed.) The animation is done last, after all the voices are recorded."
Pixar,3e353n,redhawkcircles,3,Tue Jul 21 18:08:42 2015 UTC,"Actually, /u/ElderCunningham is right in this case.  The original voice cast was fired a month or two ago and replaced.  While some of the animation was done later, a good portion was redubbed by a new voice cast."
Pixar,3e353n,Quizlebeck,4,Tue Jul 21 19:10:35 2015 UTC,"The new voice cast was announced recently, they were not replaced recently. The current cast has been with the project for almost a year now. No redubs necessary."
Pixar,3e353n,redhawkcircles,5,Wed Jul 22 00:00:17 2015 UTC,"The original voice cast was NOT fired a month or two ago, but as early as last may. Pixar NEVER ""dubs"" lines, and always records the lines first. Except for ONE line in a bugs life that was changed from ""screw up"" to ""mess up"" after the film was already done, to avoid a PG rating."
Pixar,3e353n,IrishRam,3,Tue Jul 21 20:26:47 2015 UTC,you seem very angry about this. Did you read the link that /u/ElderCunningham posted?
Pixar,3e353n,illogical_cpt,0,Tue Jul 21 21:44:25 2015 UTC,"No, I'm just frustrated that the word ""dub"" is being misused. Yes, they replaced the cast and the lines were re-recorded, but they weren't ""redubbed"" or ""dubbed over."" which implies that they are pasting voices over the already completed animation, which only happened once in a bugs life.  I'm just saying that the lines were recorded a while longer than just a month ago. Animation always happens last in these movies, and the lack of dialogue is inherent to the movie, and not a result of production problems."

I guess a movie about emotions should convey emotions well, but it felt so relatable. Even for people that have never gone through her experiences, you could understand and empathize on a whole new level. It took a few days of someone's life and broke them down so intricately, that the connection to her feelings was insanely powerful. It didn't have to hit home to be moving; it was moving on its own. It was so perfectly done."
Pixar,3d2eet,TheJesterTechno,8,Mon Jul 13 23:00:52 2015 UTC,".5. Toy Story- Buzz realizes he's a toy  .4. The Incredibles- Syndrome and Mr. Incredible's dialogue after he is captured. It may seem like an odd pick, but that particular scene highlights the characters of that movie incredibly well. We see Mr. Incredible's care for his family, we see how far Syndrome will go, and we learn a bit more on Mirage.  .3. Inside Out- Riley sees her SF house for the first time. This scene made me cry, watching the childhood optimism and expectation being constantly shattered, it was intense  .2. Monster's University- Mike fails to scare the camp kids. IMO, this is the 2nd realest Pixar has ever gotten. At this point, Pixar delivers a gut punch to every young adult and teenager in the theatre. Not all dreams come true the way you want them to. We aren't all great at everything, so we best find something we can do and move on.  .1. Toy Story 3- Toy Story 3's ending. This is the most real Pixar has gotten. It's all about letting go of childhood, and is brilliantly done."

Pixar,3d24a8,GENTOOO,3,Mon Jul 13 05:27:53 2015 UTC,"Worst to best Pixar Movies  Cars 2: I haven't actually seen it, but I don't think anyone would argue with this based on what I've heard of it.  Cars: Wasn't at all a bad movie, it was just too childish. It was like if George Lucas directed a Pixar movie.  Brave: I actually really liked this movie. However, it was forgettable.  Finding Nemo: This is probably the most controversial pick for me. Finding Nemo was a great movie. It will go down as an eternal classic and I will show it to my children, but it was a bit too serious for my liking.  A Bug's Life: Again, great movie, but unfortunately this movie was brought down by the movie Antz coming out at the same time. Although A Bug's Life was vastly superior, it still made the idea seem to be unoriginal, even though it wasn't.  Toy Story 2: Toy Story 2 was the most forgettable out of all the Toy Story movies. The trilogy will go down as classics, but Toy Story 2 will have the same fate as Ocean's 12. Good movie, but the worst out of the 3.  Toy Story 3: I absolutely loved this movie, but I think that had to do mostly with the fact that it was extraordinarily nostalgic.  Monsters Inc: Now it gets really hard. From now on it all comes down to which I would prefer to watch right now. Monsters Inc is an amazing movie, but it isn't as fun to watch for me as the rest of these movies.  Toy Story: Gah it's so hard to not say that all these movies are my favorite. Toy Story just isn't that funny, and I like funny movies.  The Incredibles: I have watched this movie more than any other Pixar movie. Due to this, it has become less and less interesting to me. I am super excited about Incredibles 2 however.  Up: This movie has my favorite soundtrack ever. I love Michael Giacchino and the soundtrack from Up was his best work.  Ratatouille: This movie is the most mature out of all of Pixar movies in my personal opinion. It's funny, has a great story, a great soundtrack, and a good message.  Wall-E: As a sound-designer myself, Wall-E is amazing for me to watch to learn techniques and get ideas. Another great story, relatively funny, great message and another really good soundtrack.  Monsters University: Okay, this is probably my second most controversial pick. This movie was HILARIOUS, and as I said earlier, I love funny movies. Other than that, it's definitely not the best, but I would watch this again and again.  Inside Out: This movie has EVERYTHING. It's hilarious, has a phenomenal soundtrack composed by non other than Michael Giacchino, has an amazing story, a great message, and is just overall a slam dunk. I want to go to the movies right now to go see it for a fourth time."

In ""Finding Nemo,"" did you ever expect the film to end without the father-son reunion?"
Pixar,3d24a8,StagnantBalance,5,Mon Jul 13 01:53:36 2015 UTC,"In hindsight, no, but for first time viewing (where it really counts) pixar manipulates you well enough for you to think there is a very legitimate threat. But in order to manipulate you must have a solid character that the audience can relate and get behind. You have to get the audience to care for the main character in order to get the audience to think disaster may actually strike, and get out of the predictable stance that plagues typical animations. Merida wasn't an interesting nor relatable character which directly effects how predictable the story line is to a first time viewer."

Brave is like half-way through my ranking, so not my favorite, but that's because the story wasn't super original."
Pixar,3d24a8,LilPotato911,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:54:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly. For many films its all about getting you to feel tension. Most moviegoers predict everything will turn out hunky-dory by the end, which is true 80% of the time, our predictions are usually met. But if we feel nothing for the characters, or the danger they're in, then we aren't invested and don't care.   Let's say Toy Story began with the third one, and hopped right to the climax. We all know the toys aren't actually going to die, but because we didn't set up all the time getting to know and enjoy them we don't really care about the peril they're in and the fear they're experiencing."

(Need I explain myself?) The Incredibles (Superheroes? Omnidroids? Edna? Syndrome? Need I say more?) Finding Nemo (everything about this film is incredibly, and I truly think it objectively it is Pixar's finest film)   However! My favorite is definitely going to be Inside Out. I adore everything about this movie, it's setting, it's characters, the message, the writing. Plus, it is the only Pixar movie to make me actually cry, and that was ONLY when Riley ran back home and broke down in front of her parents; as someone who went through what she did and was greatly affected personally by such a move, I was able to connect greatly with this film and now I think it's going to go on to be one of my personal favorite films of all time."

Pixar,3d3jlh,Gunner2893,9,Mon Jul 20 00:27:53 2015 UTC,"I don't really think it's too worrying.  As one of the quotes mentioned, it's definitely for kids 8+, and I'd even go as far to say that kids ages 10-13 would appreciate it, too. It's just some parents think that their kids, no matter the age, will be cool with watching any animated G or PG movie.  Perhaps, I think, Pixar could go for a bit of a change in marketing strategy.  Rather than saying ""this is a family movie"" which too many people instantly translate as ""this is a kid's movie,"" they should say ""This is a movie for everybody!""  Maybe Pixar is trying to buck the whole idea that just because it's animated and from Disney means it's for kids.  Maybe they're trying to say ""Hey, G and PG movies can tackle really mature, complex issues without resorting to violence and swearing!"" Obviously I can't know that for sure, but it is possible.    Regardless, Minions had the added benefit of excessive, in-your-face marketing.  Like seriously, I think you would have to be living in the most strict Amish community or literally live under a rock in the middle of Alaska to have not heard about Minions.  Pixar was more conservative about their marketing, by contrast, and not as many kids were begging their parents to let them go see it because a lot of them were probably way more hyped about Minions than Inside Out.  Also, this is the same animation company that went to almost obscene marketing measures in promoting The Lorax a few years ago.  Plus, Minions is primarily based around more mindless slapstick humor that tends to draw more kids than the more cerebral humor that Pixar likes to employ.  Plus, what kind of kid wouldn't want to see a movie featuring their favorite characters of the Despicable Me movies?  The word I keep hearing is that a lot of people just remembered the Minions from those movies because they were so bizarre and provided a lot of the comedy. With that in mind, Minions had a fanbase already in place after the Despicable Me movies did so well, and those fans made the Minions so popular that a movie just became inevitable.  Also, Minions had an additional benefit of having already been released for a month outside of the United States, (June 11th in London was the earliest release date) so no, they didn't make $400 million worldwide in just one weekend.  It's been out about the same total amount of time as Inside Out, and made almost the same amount of money.  It's possible that Minions might get more box office revenue, but given Pixar's track record of raking in the Oscars (I will bet money on Inside Out winning Best Animated Picture unless The Good Dinosaur gives me reason to think otherwise) it should win out in the long run with DVD sales.  I think that the only thing that's going to make me worry about the future of Pixar is if they release about two or more box office bombs in a row.    TL;DR, Minions benefited from a pre-existing fanbase and excessive marketing, two things Inside Out didn't have.  It's going to take a lot more than one movie to put Pixar in any kind of trouble."

Minions is cute and funny, and I don't find it surprising that they blew up at the box office, but it's just a goofy comedy film.   And just to add my own experience in the theater, when I saw it with my buddy opening night the theater was packed with all ages, including many very young children. When Bing Bong died and Joy started crying in the Memory Dump you'd better believe I heard a huge amount of those youngsters sniffling. I think 'Inside Out' is much like the show 'Adventure Time', where it's simple enough on the surface for kids to enjoy but there's complicated layers for the adults to enjoy."
Pixar,3d3jlh,cocobandicoot,5,Mon Jul 13 18:08:35 2015 UTC,"You're right. I'm just concerned because, when I went to go see Minions on its opening night, I went in with high expectations. Despicable Me and its sequel had set the bar higher for Illumination and Sony, after all. Yet, halfway through the movie, I realized that Minions was so poorly constructed plot- and character-wise that I really started wishing I had spent my money to see Inside Out again. The jokes relied far too heavily on slapstick, and weren't even that funny.  It's just disappointing to see a lower quality film earn more over a film that clearly had so much heart and soul put into it."
Pixar,3d3jlh,popthabubble,4,Mon Jul 13 18:48:03 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with the direction Pixar is going. I feel that most of their revenue is generated through merchandise. They make a lot of sequels, but even those are usually decent. As long as they continue to make quality movies, they won't lose touch.  Adult themes in animation are scarce, and its kind of refreshing to see.   And with the all-encompassing ad campaign of Minions, it's no surprise it became so popular. They're. Everywhere."
Pixar,3d3jlh,Andrew0085,3,Mon Jul 13 23:57:42 2015 UTC,"I would just say it was a matter of marketing. Pixar doesn't generally do a whole lot of ads, while Minions was EVERYWHERE."

Pixar,3covu9,Krut_2,2,Thu Jul 9 16:17:21 2015 UTC,The answer is there is absolutely no indication that the doors in Monsters Inc travel through time and the only reason that idea is exists is to try and make the theory work.
Pixar,3covu9,icorrectpettydetails,0,Fri Jul 10 10:47:31 2015 UTC,"No, it's in the theory because it makes more sense. In Monsters Inc, they go back to Mary's room several times over the course of two days. Every time they go to that room, it's in the same condition, and it's in the middle of the night. There's no indication that Mary's parents are even wondering where she is.  This is despite the fact that they go back to her room at different times in the day, starting with after their shift and then the next day at lunch, when Mike gets nabbed by Randall.  If time is moving parallel, then this is a massive plot hole. If they're moving in time, this cleans up that plot hole along with the whole feigned ignorance of human children being toxic."
Pixar,3covu9,jonnegroni,2,Fri Jul 10 17:38:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not in a position to watch through the film and examine the details, but their shift ends at 6 and they have lunch about midday. That's only a time difference of 6 hours, which since Boo's room is dark inside with an external light source, means it could be at any time during the night. There's no reason to say it's the middle of the night in both cases, it could be a dark late evening in one and early morning in the other.     There's no indication that Mary's parents are even wondering where she is.     What would you expect to see? The only room of their house we see is Boo's room, which if they're looking for their daughter after seeing she's not in there, they have no reason to be in anymore. For all we know they're in the other room talking to the police about it."
Pixar,3covu9,icorrectpettydetails,0,Fri Jul 10 18:21:41 2015 UTC,"That's only a time difference of 6 hours   No, it's a time difference of 18 hours if you factor in the end of their shift the previous day (when Boo and Sulley meet), and then lunch the next day. And it's still dark 6 hours later? That makes no sense whatsoever.    For all we know they're in the other room talking to the police about it.   Fair point! I just think it would be strange that the room would be untouched, as if they haven't looked for her."
Pixar,3covu9,jonnegroni,2,Mon Jul 13 17:31:11 2015 UTC,"Lunch is at around noon, end of shift is at 6. That's a six hour difference between 12 and 6pm. If it's noon in Monsters Inc and that corresponds to late evening in Boo's Room, then 6pm in Monsters Inc corresponds to early morning in Boo's Room.     And Boo's room is hardly dark. Shadowy, but there's always a strong light shining in through the window. Unless there's some sort of clock in that room (which I don't remember seeing and as a small child, I doubt Boo owns one) I don't know how you can pinpoint any specific time, and dawn/dusk both seem like plausable times of day for any time they enter."
Pixar,3covu9,icorrectpettydetails,0,Mon Jul 13 17:47:03 2015 UTC,"No, you keep leaving out the day before. It's not just noon and 6pm we're comparing. We're comparing 6pm the previous day, noon the next day, and then maybe around 6pm or even later that same day.  And Boo's room is dark in every scene, you can't really contest that it's ever daytime when we see it. But it always looks like it's the same type of dark, suggesting that they're just going to the same moment in time, as if none has really passed."
Pixar,3covu9,jonnegroni,2,Mon Jul 13 23:51:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not leaving out the day before, I'm only focusing on the actual time when the enter the room, which is 12pm and 6pm in Monsters Inc's own timeframe. They could be several days or years apart, it wouldn't matter, because they still only ever go to Boo's room at around 12pm and 6pm.     12pm in Monsters Inc = early evening in Boo's Room 6pm in Monsters Inc = early dawn in Boo's Room     Which since there's a light source coming from outside in both time periods, is consistant with the times in the film.    Not to mention, every other time they pass through to the human world, time passes the same in Monsters Inc. If time went faster or the timelines were out of sync, it would have been impossible for Mike and Sulley to get back to stop Randall. They would have absolutely no guarantee of getting back to HQ in anywhere near the correct time."
Pixar,3covu9,icorrectpettydetails,0,Tue Jul 14 00:05:40 2015 UTC,"But they enter the room the day before. You have to factor that in too. For the sake of argument, let's say it's at least 9:30pm on Day 1 when the monsters snag Boo. First of all, that's already weird because it's not late enough at the end of their shift for it to be that dark out, but whatever, let's just say it's a time zone thing.   We see the room again at 12pm the next day, which means it's been 18 hours. 9:30pm plus 18 hours places Boo's room at about 3:30pm in the afternoon when Randall capture Mike at lunch. But it's still completely dark? That's the issue."
Pixar,3covu9,jonnegroni,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:10:36 2015 UTC,"No, because you're missing my point. The actual length of time between the two entries into Boo's room don't matter because one day is more or less the same as any other day (with some allowences for seasons and whatnot). As I said before     12pm MIT = early evening (Boo's Room time) 6pm MIT = early morning (BRT)     If there's a 1:1 ratio, then this will always be true. If you enter twice in the same day, it'll bring you out at times 6 hours apart. If you enter at noon on one day and 6pm on another, it'll be 6 hours + however many days you waited. If you enter at 6pm on one day and 12pm on the next, which they do in the film, it will be 18 hours apart in an actual timescale, but a clock will still show times 6 hours apart, just in the reverse order. Days go in circles after all.  So, if there's a constant ratio of time flowing between each world, then all that's required of Boo's Room is to have the same light level at two times six hours apart, and since Boo's Room has an unspecified light source outside, this is easily plausable. It's not 'completely dark' as you said, there is enough light to see clearly and distingish colours, the only time you can say it isn't is full daytime. There's no need to get time travel involved at all. It doesn't solve any problem and only brings in new problems which have no answer."
Pixar,3covu9,icorrectpettydetails,-2,Tue Jul 14 19:13:56 2015 UTC,"You're making this assumption that it's early morning at 6pm MIT, but that just doesn't fit what you actually see. Seriously, for the life of me I can't understand where you're getting this idea that an unspecified light source means it's just before morning.   There's no need to get time travel involved at all. It doesn't solve any problem and only brings in new problems which have no answer.   You haven't stated any ""new problems."" The reason I believe it's the case is because the idea that children are toxic is a huge plot hole when measured up against the rest of the film. I've already stated all of this."
Pixar,3covu9,jonnegroni,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:26:25 2015 UTC,"He never said it was daytime, he said it was anytime between dusk and dawn."
Pixar,3covu9,Namenobdnagar,3,Tue Jul 14 21:18:27 2015 UTC,"Why would you make the leap that they are time portals? They are just doorways between the human and monster worlds.  As for why the monsters think children are deadly. ..who knows why that started, but since Boo clearly isn't toxic it shows everything they have been told about the human world is suspect."
Pixar,3covu9,nihilance,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:27:46 2015 UTC,The 'time portals' idea (I don't even like calling it a 'theory') is entirely made up for the 'Pixar Theory' to work. There's nothing in the film that indicates time travel.

Pixar,3covu9,Vaccino,2,Thu Jul 9 22:00:30 2015 UTC,"The time portals thing is definitely the weakest part of the Pixar theory; it's like the dude didn't really like or care about Monster's Inc but he came up with a really ""clever"" idea and then couldn't honestly reflect over whether it made any sense in the context of the story."
Pixar,3covu9,LiteralHeadCannon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:05:22 2015 UTC,That's most of the crap in that theory. It's some stuff from the films with a load of stuff pulled out of his ass.
Pixar,3covu9,Namenobdnagar,0,Sat Jul 11 10:19:54 2015 UTC,I think it makes sense.  http://www.pixartheory.com/
Pixar,3covu9,Vaccino,3,Thu Jul 9 22:01:49 2015 UTC,"The idea is that it's not common knowledge. Only the higher up monsters and the CDA actually know monsters are going back in time. Why?   Because if monsters knew they were tampering with history, they could ruin it. That's why the idea of kids being toxic is such a perpetuated myth. That's why there's a child detection agency, even though it's clear among Waternoose, Roz, and the CDA agents that kids aren't a true threat.   When you think about it, it makes way more sense that they're going back in time. Waternoose's comment about ""kids these days"" is intentional. They have to move through the timeline parallel, because they can't just go back to the same points in history over and over again. They'd run into themselves.   And the monsters are getting to the point where kids are less scared. But I don't think that's what the real crisis is. Sulley and Randall are the top scarers of all time, but there's still an energy crisis? That doesn't make sense unless the people in charge of MI understand that they're running out of time before kids disappear from the timeline via WALL-E/Cars/etc.   So there's no real blackout, just a panicked reaction to their version of Climate Change.   And to respond to LiteralHeadCannon, YES I absolutely care about Monsters Inc. That's why I've seen it nearly a hundred times."
Pixar,3covu9,jonnegroni,2,Thu Jul 9 22:24:21 2015 UTC,How would not knowing about time travel make it safer? Surely telling them they were going back in time would make them more careful about not disrupting the timestream.
Pixar,3covu9,Namenobdnagar,0,Fri Jul 10 18:23:33 2015 UTC,"Because disrupting the time stream isn't directly in their best interest. A monster could screw up and just shrug his shoulders saying, ""Oh well.""   But if you spin it so that making a mistake and bringing something over is immediately detrimental to their health, then you ensure that monsters keep their hands to themselves for their own sake.   This would also prevent ambitious monsters like Randall from cheating after hours and stealing children...if Waternoose hadn't been in on everything, of course."
Pixar,3cmtkz,LilPotato911,7,Thu Jul 9 03:14:02 2015 UTC,"I think it fully depends on how well it was done.  I feel like it lends itself more to a TV series sequel than one movie (with each episode dealing with a different emotional issue as Riley goes through her pre-teens and teens). However, if they made that it'd probably be outsourced to some smaller studio and be put on Disney Channel rather than directly controlled by Pixar. I don't know if I'd trust anyone but Pixar to write any follow-ups.  Alternatively, small 22 minute specials like they've been doing with Toy Story could work."
Pixar,3cmtkz,OtakuMecha,2,Thu Jul 9 04:48:32 2015 UTC,Get it on Netflix
Pixar,3cmtkz,Lozzif,2,Thu Jul 9 13:35:45 2015 UTC,"Obviously, they could make a sequel and it would be a solid movie (it is Pixar, after all). But I would rather see them do the occasional ""shorts"", as they have been doing with Toy Story. It would allow Pixar to take the reigns and still give us all high quality entertainment yet while not stretching out our watering down the great storyline of the original movie. Netflix would be great, but the show might get exhaustive after one or two seasons, in my opinion."
Pixar,3cmtkz,thorshine,2,Thu Jul 16 21:29:25 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree the shorts and specials would probably be the best way to go.
Pixar,3cmtkz,OtakuMecha,2,Thu Jul 16 21:32:53 2015 UTC,"I guess if they make a sequel to inside out, it would have to be in another's mind"
Pixar,3cmtkz,jpae20,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:48:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's what they should do; they should stick to someone familiar, like Riley and her emotes, otherwise audiences would feel alienated. Changing the person doesn't really alter anything about the mechanics of the mind world anyhow"
Pixar,3cmtkz,Chris-P-Creme,2,Thu Jul 9 04:07:16 2015 UTC,"This film could do so well with a sequel. They did such an amazing job creating a relatable and shapable premise for thoughts and emotions that there is a huge open world of possibilities and directions that the studio could take. The film was amazing, and even still I really feel like they only scratched the surface with the concept. It doesn't even just have to be in Riley's mind, though they could easily make another film with that setting.   I also believe that several animated shorts based on the minds of different people would be amazing. I really hope Pixar considers that."
Pixar,3cmtkz,NightFire19,2,Thu Jul 9 06:05:12 2015 UTC,"I would love it if they made a short-film that dealt with what would happen if one of the emotions ""accidentally"" pushed the Puberty button. As far as a sequel I think the film could have a sequel, but I'd be skeptical about seeing it knowing that most of the great ideas were put into the original."
Pixar,3cmtkz,BestNameEver_,2,Thu Jul 9 11:09:02 2015 UTC,"I've been pondering this as well. The way the movie is set up (the exploration of Riley's mind was a parade of inventiveness, but can't simply be repeated) doesn't lend itself well to a sequel. As others have said, a series of 20 minute episodes would work best and could still be highly emotional, but they'd need to be in the hands of Pixar."
Pixar,3cmtkz,AdeonWriter,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:00:12 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm hoping for, like what they did with Toy Story or DreamWorks did with Shrek. Hell, I'd settle for a legit 2D animated series. I mean the particle effects on the Emotions won't be nearly as exaustive that way, and they'd probably be able to get all the voice actors, as they're all TV stars"
Pixar,3cndaq,Abdul-Rahollotasuga,3,Thu Jul 9 06:31:45 2015 UTC,"The song was as much a part of the story as the pictures.  Since Iz has passed, it would not really make sense to include one of his songs."
Pixar,3cndaq,Snoracks,3,Thu Jul 9 16:33:52 2015 UTC,"Iz is awesome, and I bet they probably would have hired him if he hadn't passed on. :( But they probably wanted that particular song, not somewhere over the rainbow."
Pixar,3ck1tl,LilPotato911,17,Wed Jul 8 14:55:15 2015 UTC,An emotional part was when Riley was on the bus and she couldn't feel anything. I thought it was a fitting metaphor for depression and it really hit home for me.
Pixar,3ck1tl,doubleplusfabulous,8,Wed Jul 8 21:22:35 2015 UTC,"One major misconception many people have is that depression is just ""feeling sad all the time"", and I am really grateful that Pixar collaborated with many psychologists to bring across the idea that depression is a state of not feeling."
Pixar,3ck1tl,NightFire19,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:11:06 2015 UTC,"It's nice to see a decent amount of modern animation tackling depression. Big Hero 6 did it pretty good as well. The episode ""Breezy"" from Adventure Time is a criminally overlooked masterpiece of animation in my opinion. As far as I know, it was the first animation to accurately display depression (Finn says ""I don't really feel anything). It also shows Finn trying to cure it by having ""make outs"" with as many princesses as possible. The ending scene is also wonderfully open to interpretation. It's really nice to see all these animations differentiating sadness and depression, something I never really understood until seeing Breezy."
Pixar,3ck1tl,BestNameEver_,6,Sat Jul 11 16:51:28 2015 UTC,Just for clarification: Joy turns to Sadness is referring to when Sadness took the controls and Riley confessed to her parents.   Just in case people got that confused with when Joy became sad in the Memory Dump
Pixar,3ck1tl,purplenelly,7,Wed Jul 8 15:57:55 2015 UTC,"For me the saddest moment was when Riley cries and hugs her parents, but I don't feel like ""Joy turns to Sadness"" is an accurate description."
Pixar,3ck1tl,OtakuMecha,5,Wed Jul 8 16:54:55 2015 UTC,"For me it was around when she said ""I know you wanted me to be happy but..."" or something like that."
Pixar,3ck1tl,purplenelly,5,Wed Jul 8 17:55:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly. I just can't watch an eleven year old girl burst into tears like that without crying myself, especially when they make it look so realistic."
Pixar,3ck1tl,Vaccino,2,Wed Jul 8 18:00:52 2015 UTC,"I felt that that was just the overall title of the scene, due to the soundtrack haha."
Pixar,3ck1tl,theroboticdan,2,Wed Jul 8 17:02:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah without a doubt that has to be the saddest scene. I'm surprised people thought Bing Bong fading away was sadder. I mean yeah it was a sad scene, but watching Riley just break down in tears and hug her parents was definitely the saddest part. I tried holding in the tears the second time I saw the movie, but it was impossible for me."
Pixar,3ck1tl,Swoove,8,Thu Jul 9 22:07:18 2015 UTC,"Not the winning answer for most but for me it was Goofball Island. Dad comes into the room and doesn't know what to do to make things right. He tries out the old monkey thing that used to work and instead of it fixing things, she resents it. Now all aspects of her core that are associated with being a goofy kid are tainted and fall apart. She puts aside childish things and happy memories to dwell on her anger. It was watching her childhood personality die. :("

As a dad of a 7yo girl, the Goof Ball Island was the saddest for me because I know it is inevitable to some extent. 😞"
Pixar,3ck1tl,woltdosnoy,2,Wed Jul 8 22:53:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed on that, it'd be interesting to see what age groups were affected the most by a particular scene. Like as legally an adult, who went through exactly what Riley went through at her age, Joy turns to Sadness was a scene that definitely hit me the most"
Pixar,3ci1q7,RjakActual,9,Wed Jul 8 01:54:38 2015 UTC,"Nah, she was like 2 or 3 at the time; it'd be a faded memory, then we'd all cry"
Pixar,3ci1q7,LilPotato911,3,Wed Jul 8 14:51:24 2015 UTC,Wow that's WAYYYYY better. Seeing Sully and Mike as dark globes in the bottom of Boo's subconscious? That says SO much more.  I'm tearing up just thinking about it!!
Pixar,3ci1q7,EpicVico,3,Wed Jul 8 19:14:29 2015 UTC,But that would ruin the pixar theory !
Pixar,3ci1q7,RileyRichard,13,Sun Jul 12 15:11:55 2015 UTC,"YES. That would have been amazing! It would have fit best as a post-credits scene as I feel if they put it in the movie or during the credits, it would feel too much like shoehorning in a reference for the sake of it.  Still an awesome idea though!"
Pixar,3ci1q7,kingzilch,4,Wed Jul 8 03:11:12 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of Boo appearing (and I did spot Mary Gibbs' name in the credits under 'Additional Voices'), but I don't think seeing that core memory would work for this particular story.  Unlike most Pixar movies, with their talking toys, superheroes, or sentient robots, the world of Inside Out is meant to represent our comparatively mundane, non-fantastical world.  To explicitly acknowledge this whole other world of monsters with teleportation technology would place the movie in a whole other, fantastical world, which would raise issues beyond just how to deal with broccoli on pizza.  Does that make sense?  Think of it this way: Look at Marvel's Daredevil series on Netflix (I just finished season 1, so it's fresh on my mind).  Yes, it takes place in the same fantastical world as the Avengers (which they acknowledge), but it's a much more grounded story about organized crime in Hell's Kitchen.  It wouldn't fit the story of Daredevil if he suddenly crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgard with the Hulk."

Pixar,3cczkq,OtakuMecha,10,Tue Jul 7 00:11:33 2015 UTC,"WALL-E. Up's sentiment comes from Carl and Ellie's relationship, but much of this central idea is ignored once their adventure starts in South America. While the rest of Up is definitely playful and fun to watch, it kinda loses sight of Carl and Ellie. I like how WALL-E continued to build the romance between the two robots throughout the movie."

They're both complete stories, and the ""great parts"" of both of them are not complete stories.  (Imagine if the first ten minutes of Up were a short.  It would be by far the most depressing thing Pixar has ever produced, and no, you can't say ""well they already produced it and it's already the most depressing thing they produced"", because Up is about moving on.  The Married Life sequence without the rest of the film would just be depression for the sake of depression - pointless.)"

And the year before that, there was no nomination for Tangled, when there were enough noms for a Shrek spin-off, etc. The past two years with Frozen and BH6 winning have made-up for it, but it seemed as if Disney Feature Animation was on a hot streak a few years before the Academy even started noticing them.  Any year that there's anything noteworthy done in hand-drawn animation, it at least gets a nomination. And any year that there's anything decent done in stop motion (such as an Aardman release), it gets a nomination. That means in years when someone releases a hand-drawn film and someone else releases something done in stop motion, there's only 3 nominations left for all the other features, and I think that is a big part of why films like The Lego Movie get snubbed sometimes. I don't think anyone cared that The Lego Movie was made in Australia, I think there were only 3 nominations available after the non-CG work got its inevitable nominations."
Pixar,3cb0ss,JereA,2,Mon Jul 6 23:39:38 2015 UTC,"I truly only started watching the Academy Awards a few years ago (I don't recall exactly what year) so my opinion might not be the best informed. These last two years when it came to the best animated feature I was disappointed at the results. There were so many good films nominated, but the winners felt like ""bandwagon winners"" to me (Frozen and Big Hero 6). It disappointed me to see films like The Wind Rises, Song of the Sea, and The Tale of Princess Kaguya (films that innovated so much in storytelling) to lose out to films whose largest impact was that they were popular. I don't know, maybe I'm being nitpick, but that's the way it feels to me."
Pixar,3cb0ss,uncletravellingmatt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:35:36 2015 UTC,"When the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature was introduced in 2001, it was interesting to see Shrek win the first year, then Miyazaki's 'Spirited Away' win the second year. So, Disney Feature Animation had to wait until 2013 to win their first BAF Oscar, but Miyazaki took one home in 2002.  I don't always agree with their decisions. In 2006, the very forgettable ""Happy Feet"" won. I'm not too surprised that Cars got beaten (it wasn't Pixar's best and Pixar had just been winning them for Nemo and The Incredibles) but even Monster House was more interesting IMO."

I mean, I was enjoying it, yes, but the world of the emotions felt just a bit too complicated to me.  They had to explain everything they saw.  But I will say that the emotional high (and low) moments of this movie were fantastic.  Some of the best Pixar highs and lows so far."

I'm someone who loves studying the brain and psychology and such so I was just fascinated by the details they put in and how much they actually got right. The whole movie I was both appreciating that they did the research and placing myself mentally into how it would feel to have my brain/emotions doing whatever was happening on screen.   It led to being one of my all time favorite movies."

Pixar,3ccjim,neoslith,2,Tue Jul 7 01:18:02 2015 UTC,"But what about the movies makes them your favorite?  Is it the story? The writing? The characters? The setting? The score? The animation?    My favorite film of all time has to be Back to the Future. I love films with time travel and BttF is just so unforgettable. It's every kid's dream ""Would I be friends with my parents at the same age?"" and the more detailed answer of ""How did you and mom meet?""  Couple that with a brilliant score and even more amazing actors and you got a great sci-fi comedy (plus with minimal special effects)! It's spawned two sequels, a number of games, and put a couple names on the map. It really helped Michael J. Fox's career even more and brought some newcomers like Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson.  Then you got a great name behind it: Steven Spielberg. Don't get much bigger than that. And the great direction of Robert Zemeckis. The movie is a great snippet of time from the 80's and the 50's. It will always be remembered for it's zany situations and all around great story.    When I hear Cars 2 I think of how it caused Planes to be created and the inflated marketing cow it became. Larry the Cable Guy is funny in his Blue Collar Comedy Tour and he was a good side character to Lighting in the first film. But Cars 2 was simply pandering to the kids and all the little children who love Hot Wheels and car toys.  I'm trying to remember anything about the film and it just comes back to stuff I saw from the trailers.    So now I ask you, /u/Cyndaquilfan123, what makes Cars 2 a good movie?"

How do you feel about them when you watch them now?  Cars is an okay movie in my opinion, although a little bland.  I actually just finished Cars 2 for the first time, which is what led me to this thread, and I really didn't enjoy it.  How did 12 year old you like having so much Mater?

The Joy of Credits:  This track includes several motifs.  I like the jazz feel."
Pixar,3c9mgn,MigMigg,2,Mon Jul 6 16:11:05 2015 UTC,"I like the main theme from Bundle of Joy and how it shows up in other parts of the soundtrack (such as Team Building and First Day of School, then triumphantly in The Joy of Credits).

Pixar,3c789v,deltora,8,Sun Jul 5 15:06:22 2015 UTC,"Well first of all, it's a kids movie, so that wouldn't fly. Second of all, arousal is a mix of Joy and Disgust (and possibly fear?), so it doesn't fit the bill as a core emotion."

I was hoping Disgust (social) + Anger = envy. Self-loathing could drive jealousy and/or envy.  One way that this could be improved is if Disgust were split into the two aspects described in the film's intro - social disgust and environmental disgust.

In the film we see the workers run the machine in order to make sure no pure ideas are stuck inside that could potentially have an effect on the big idea worth processing. Basically the first stage is the visual representation of examining an idea, because Sadness, Joy and Bing-Bong are complex ideas with different components the stages themselves the abstract thought machine i think is meant to break things down so that they can be reformed into the understanding of a concept. This best way this can be visually represented is essentially reversing an animation or drawing process. First you start with a complex thing, break it down into smaller parts make it into simple shapes, then lastly the pure portion is simply a 2D image."

Pixar,3bq33l,GENTOOO,4,Wed Jul 1 08:09:00 2015 UTC,"For me it has to be the The Incredibles.  It has the kind of score that legitimately makes the movie better.  Unlike a lot of movies, you notice it and in many places pay equal attention to it as you do the images on the screen, but it's never distracting, if that makes any sense."

Pixar,3bq33l,ExpendablePancakes,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:47:17 2015 UTC,What I like about Wall-E's soundtrack is that Thomas Newman was exactly the right composer for the movie. He has this signature style which mixes a softened version of Steve Reich's minimalism (which some describe as Trance music played by an orchestra) with a sort of cheerfulness which evokes images of mid-20th century American suburbia as well as a sense of wonder which is present even in his sadder pieces. This is pretty much the perfect combo for a movie about a curious robot exploring a technocratic utopia.

Pixar,3bpm2c,TheRealHandSanitizer,5,Wed Jul 1 06:40:11 2015 UTC,"Of course. Sometimes you need to be sad in order to be happy. That's the moral of the story. Joy isn't the only one with the colors of other emotions on her.   Disgust is primarily green, but she wears purple lipstick, shoes, and also a purple ascot. Purple is of course fear's color. It fits because in order to keep away from poisons you have to fear them just a little."

I am having a hard time telling if her tongue is Purple too or Pink/Red.  Anger has Yellow flames, Purpleish pants and it looks like the zig-zag of his tie has a Blue tint to it (possible Green).   Fear has Blue stripes on his sleeves and a Red tongue  Sadness has Purple glasses and a Red Tongue"

Pixar,3bmxri,ourowndevices,6,Tue Jun 30 14:48:32 2015 UTC,"I believe that the ""memory dump"" is described as a place where memories go to be forgotten - ""Nothing ever comes back from there.""    This would mean to me that Bingbong, the construct, is gone, never to remanifest in Riley's life.  However, I suspect the memories would remain, but possibly altered.  I don't base this on the events in the film, but rather how Pixar operates.    Pixar has a tendency to operate within real-world parameters when they tackle a story that takes place in the real world (Nemo's scene in the EAC, for example).  It honestly depends on how Pixar wants to value Bingbong in Riley's life.  If she was a lonely child whose only friend was a cotton-candy-elephant-dolphin-cat, then I would imagine Bingbong would be as important as someone's childhood friends, and thus, like time times many of us had with childhood friends, the memories would stick. However, based on Friendship Island, we know that she was not a lonely child and had strong friendships with real people.  The real-world parameter for imaginary friends is a tough one for me to tackle as I never had an imaginary friend, but I imagine memories of imaginary friends for a child with human friends are retained similarly to other early childhood memories that aren't strongly valued.  That being said, I know many of my early childhood memories aren't actual memories, but vague recollections of how I felt at the time.  I can be reminded of those feelings when a parent references an exact thing that happened, but I won't remember that particular event.  For instance, I know I went to Disney World when I was really young.  My parents have referenced individual character meet-and-greets, but all I remember is a wash of Disney characters and feeling really happy that I was getting to see them.   I think this could be a possibility for Bingbong if Riley didn't place a huge importance on him in her life.  The memories stay, but instead of being a visual replay (as all of them seemed to be), they would convert to cloudy memory orbs where the clouds roughly resemble Bingbong.    Then again, I could simply be a crazy Pixar story theorist that reads too much into their story process (something I previously thought impossible given their emphasis on story over there)."
Pixar,3bmxri,musiqman,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:18:27 2015 UTC,"Then again, I could simply be a crazy Pixar story theorist that reads too much into their story process   Hahah, I definitely felt like that a little bit while we were arguing about it. To be fair though, it was an incredibly dense concept and story.   That being said, I know many of my early childhood memories aren't actual memories, but vague recollections of how I felt at the time.   Sometimes too for me it's difficult to tell whether I actually have a memory from childhood or I've just been told a story from my childhood so many times that I've started to form a memory around it."
Pixar,3bmxri,robobreasts,4,Tue Jun 30 22:58:58 2015 UTC,"I think you're right.  She was 11 years old, and Bing Bong was still running around in her mind.  She's too old to ever think about Bing Bong as a real person in her mind ever again.  He's gone in that sense.  But it's not like her parents will ever say ""remember you're imaginary friend, Bing Bong?"" and she'll say ""Huh?  What are you talking about?""  She will still have memories of him.  If she last interacted with Bing Bong at age 3, then probably by 11 she wouldn't remember him at all.  That she DOES indicates it was a long-term, notable memory.  That's not going to just vanish because she had some emotional trauma about moving.  Bing Bong is gone, but the memory of him remains.  All those memory bubbles in long term storage?  He's definitely in some of those.  I remember a stuffed cat I had when I was a kid that I treated like a person.  I don't do that anymore, but it's not like I've forgotten I ever did."
Pixar,3bmxri,Cosmic2,7,Tue Jun 30 23:23:15 2015 UTC,"I believe you are correct.  As you said, the imaginary manifestation of Bing Bong was destroyed when he faded away in the memory dump.

Pixar,3bmxri,OtakuMecha,2,Mon Jul 6 09:10:16 2015 UTC,"I think you are incorrect because he was imaginary. He was never actually there for those memories so it would be much harder for her to visualise (as in he's not actually seen in those memories) and now that he's been forgotten its for good. If she could just remember him through the memory orbs theres then no reason Bing Bong would ever be at risk of being forgotten. If simply showing a memory of bing bong was possible then he would be remembered and re-appear, but he isn't visually part of those memories so he's gone for good :c It makes his sacrifice a lot more meaningful though."
Pixar,3bmxri,pretty-little-liar,2,Tue Jun 30 15:19:24 2015 UTC,"I think he still exists as a memory deep down in her mind. It was just him that got erased, not all the memory orbs involving him.  It was meant to show how we grow out of our imaginary friends when we get older and don't ever go back to playing with them. It can never be the same. But I'm sure if you really sat and thought hard enough, you might be able to remember them as a fond memory. But you don't believe in them in the same way you did as a kid."
Pixar,3bmxri,FalconLorenzo,2,Tue Jun 30 15:51:54 2015 UTC,"That's exactly how I felt about it. Bing Bong's death was more about her outgrowing her friend.

Pixar,3bmxri,naynaythewonderhorse,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:55:25 2015 UTC,"I think that if he were purposefully dumped, all of the memories concerning him would have also been forgotten - however, since it was accidental, all the memories that allowed him to remain intact in her memory would likely still be in long-term storage."

Riley was like, 3. 4 at most. I remember only a few vague things about that time, and I honestly couldn't say if I had an imaginary friend because I frankly don't remember.  The fact of the matter is that as people get older, memories, even memories of people fade away. This was my interpretation of the core memories being lost. Notice how they ALL happened when Riley was around 4 or 5.   No matter important it was to her, scoring a goal when you are 4 (or younger) isn't the kind of thing that sticks with you forever. And definitely something that gets muddled as you grow older."

Pixar,3bfuo0,dongsuvious,4,Mon Jun 29 02:27:26 2015 UTC,"Because, you missed part of the point of Toy Story 3: It wasn't an ending. It made references to every possible after life for a toy, but it was not an ending. It was a new beginning.   I'm sure you're thinking: Bullshit. But, having an ending where the toy's simply said ""This is it. This is the end."" Goes against everything the movie is about.  Going to college is a scary thing. You're stepping up in the world, unaware of what lies beyond. As a teenager seeing Toy Story 3, graduating a year after it came out, I too thought my childhood was over. It wasn't until afterwards, that I came to realize that the movie wasn't about childhood ending at all. It's about the wrongful conclusion as adolescents perceive, whereas college is a signal for the end of childhood.  Think about the movie from the Toy's perspective: Throughout the entire thing, THEY are convinced that Andy leaving them behind is the end. The audience too, becomes convinced of this. The toys even go as far to accept that it is the end. But, in spite of everything the ending never comes. Sure, they say goodbye to Andy, but they simultaneously receive a new life through Bonnie.   I'm not sure if it was intended or not, but think about the message from here without Toy Story 4: Well, your childhood ended after Toy Story 3. No use ever trying to be a kid again. That time is passed. No, that's not a good message, and Toy Story 4 helps with that."
Pixar,3bfuo0,dongsuvious,3,Mon Jun 29 03:41:17 2015 UTC,"I havent seen the movie since it came out, but I thought the idea of childhood being eternal was shown by the end and all the shorts that came out afterwards.

Being forgotten, destroyed, preserved,lost, or grown out of. But smarter people than me work at pixar, so Im sure this comment will look foolish in a couple years."

Pixar,3bg9y5,horrible_jokes,5,Mon Jun 29 02:39:58 2015 UTC,"Robert Plutchik's theory says there are eight basic emotions. Five of them are the ones featured in Inside Out. The others are trust, anticipation, and surprise. Surprise was apparently planned to be in the movie, but was cut for being too similar to fear. Trust and Anticipation could still be used, though. I don't know about anticipation, but Trust would have to have an awfully soothing voice. Morgan Freeman? Julie Andrews?"
Pixar,3bg9y5,Yoyti,3,Mon Jun 29 12:03:59 2015 UTC,Maybe for teenagers there are temporary emotions that Kind of flick in and out during different times
Pixar,3bg9y5,redpanda4916,3,Mon Jun 29 00:17:32 2015 UTC,"They based the movie on the work of Paul Ekman, who has established six fundamental emotions based on decades of research conducted by observing the faces of people who lived in precivilized societies on remote South Pacific islands.  These six emotions are   Happiness Sadness Anger Disgust Fear Surprise   According to Pete Doctor, Surprise was cut because it was felt that Fear already covered that ground.  More recently, Paul Ekman has released a list of basic emotions not expressed through universal facial cues.  These are:   Amusement Contempt Contentment Embarassment Excitement Guilt Pride in Achievement Relief Satisfaction Sensory Pleasure Shame"
Pixar,3bg9y5,Cepinari,8,Mon Jun 29 20:32:59 2015 UTC,I was thinking like the character of love. Any actress could probably do it.
Pixar,3bg9y5,Howseh,6,Sun Jun 28 23:36:36 2015 UTC,Love is more or less a sub-category emotion of Joy though. I just found this which might interest you. http://www.copypress.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Wheellarge.png Robert Plutchik theory of emotion and his wheel of emotions categorises emotions. Whats cool is that the five emotions in Inside Out are all on the same level and also are the ones IMO that would be easily made characters' out of.
Pixar,3bg9y5,Cepinari,2,Mon Jun 29 07:59:18 2015 UTC,"I don't see love as an emotion, more like a connection.  Love makes you feel emotions, but those emotions aren't love in and of itself."

Pixar,3bg9y5,neoslith,2,Thu Jul 2 00:36:39 2015 UTC,The only one I can think of them adding is Addiction.  It's not seen in others because they didn't show any one with addiction.  It's a pretty dark turn though.  Jim Carey could pull it off since you would need someone to be the life of the party and the scary one who will let no one else at the control panel.
Pixar,3bg9y5,OtakuMecha,0,Thu Jul 2 21:26:48 2015 UTC,I think as a teenager there should be TWO new emotions.  Love and Anxiety.    Though it might make for a more interesting movie if Puberty forces the core emotions to merge. Like Joy and Anger get mixed together and become Love.  Then Sadness and Disgust mix together and become Anxiety.
Pixar,3bg9y5,neoslith,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:17:09 2015 UTC,Yeah I feel like most other emotions can be explained as aspects or mixtures of the core 5.  They somewhat touched on that when Fear and Disgust tried filling in for Joy as someone on /r/movies pointed out. Disgust disguised as Joy = sarcasm. Fear disguised as Joy = denial.
Pixar,3bg9y5,OtakuMecha,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:31:11 2015 UTC,"Like, I can see two of the emotions dominating the control panel.  Like Riley falls for Steven. Joy sees all the good things about him that make her happy, but Anger see all the things that annoy him.  The other emotions sit back while Anger and Joy create Love.  ... I'm sure there's a better way to say that, but that's how it came out."

Pixar,3beh6m,galaxiim,6,Sun Jun 28 13:55:52 2015 UTC,Good thinking although the advertising marketplace isn't nearly as lucrative as you might think. The money they make producing a commercial might be at most $1 million and even if they made a new commercial at those rates every single week (52 per year) — which they couldn't because not only would it take a huge amount of effort but there's not enough of the right clients that could both afford Pixar and have a brand that fits their style — that's $52m/year. Toy Story 3 had made $1.3 BILLION since it's come out. So it would take Pixar 25 years of making a commercial every week at record ad rates for them to make as much money as they do from their movies. (source: I work in advertising and media) (edit: spelling)

Pixar,3axgnk,The_Swarm_Hut,8,Wed Jun 24 17:44:13 2015 UTC,"The thing to remember about Inside Out is that it is purely abstract movie. The reason they couldn't send the core memories up the tube is because the memories couldn't exist without Joy or Sadness.  The reason Fear couldn't get sucked up the tube is because that's not what Riley wanted. Their whole world purely exists to cater to who Riley is. Even if a part of her wants to get rid of her Fear, she knows she couldn't do it. It's also important to note that Joy and Sadness did not get jump into the tube. They were pulled in. Riley didn't want to rid herself of them, it just happened. With regards to the dump, I don't think it's a matter of time, but how long she retains it. Even if something is forgotten doesn't mean you don't have a super duper vague memory of it.  Joy and Sadness absolutely know how to read. They learned to read with Riley, how could they not. Following Bing Bong was a choice. They knew exactly the dangers of the situation. But Joy decided to take the optimistic approach and hope nothing terrible happened to them.  An absolutely genius movie."
Pixar,3axgnk,BetweenTHEmetaphoR,3,Thu Jun 25 21:36:31 2015 UTC,1. I read that the writers themselves realized they'd wrote themselves into a plot hole but needed for it to happen. So they pretty much said to just go with the idea that she was afraid of the other emotions messing up. She was pretty anal retentive so it makes sense she would think only she could do it correctly. 2. I thought it was just because everything was going crazy in the mind at that point and there was no real place for the balls to go so the whole thing broke down. It was right when Riley was shutting down so...metaphorically everything else was.  3. Bing Bong was already sort of defeated when you meet him. He knows that Riley doesn't play with him anymore and he's really sad about it. He'd already had that little break down where Sadness comforted him. I think that's why he started to fade away quicker. He knew Riley did need him. His rocket ship wasn't alive so it just faded naturally. 4. I just assumed that was Bing Bong who couldn't read. Joy just didn't care because it was the quickest way and puberty is kind of a weird word that a kid might not know.   At least that's what I got from what I could see of the movies through my tears.

Pixar,3axgnk,DownHereWeAllFloat,2,Sat Jun 27 16:05:57 2015 UTC,"That's kind of what I felt after watching them send a memory straight up from long-term and it was like, Joy. Just launch your mem's. Why don't you communicate to HQ to wake her up, when you know somebody watches Dream Station every night?? Ok come on, this train creates and erases the track as it moves, yet the personality island falling down can derail the train of thought!?? How can the song-powered rocket not have enough power to fly to the cliff, but it has enough power to fly 3x in a row?? Joy, just float on Sad's cloud!!!  I guess Joy and Sadness's traverse back to HQ just felt really forced and fabricated, nothing felt natural. More like, ""Now we need something else to ruin their plan, what can we do to push them off the path yet again?"" I wish they had spent more time patching up the small plot holes peeking through. Fantastic movie regardless. I kind of hope for a second movie about puberty......"
Pixar,3axgnk,sincerely-yours,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:30:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with that plot-hole, but it's excusable because it leads to the funniest part of the movie. I have a feeling that there are parts of the movie that are left purposely ambiguous. Those parts aren't necessarily driven by the characters actions, but by things that need to happen due to Riley's state of mind. For example, Sadness doesn't know WHY she felt the need to touch the memories at the start. It just happened. Or, why the classroom memory became a core memory. It just happens, and the mind does do things on its own. Fear can't leave, because that's not what was supposed to happen. Honestly, it gives the movie more metaphoric value.  You see at one point that the Wagon was a tangible object. Thus, it becomes more of a memory of an object and less of something imaginary. Again, metaphorically, Joy had to get out of the hole. Joy seems so preoccupied by her goal to even care or notice some things."
Pixar,3axgnk,naynaythewonderhorse,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:51:36 2015 UTC,"It would be other story, if memories were returned to headquarters without Joy and Sadness. Story of more active but more feared, angered and disgusted Riley. And if they returned with memories, there wouldn't be a story.   About Bing Bong I want to say, he really is interesting case. He (and his rocket ship) is not a memory. I see him like some mind function or feat, maybe psychic mechanism, underlying the creation of imaginary friends, something from subconscious. Maybe his jumping out and fading is metafor for letting go childish mindset. Also, if oblivion supposed to dissolve memories, maybe he didn't vanished completely. One does not just stops being childish forever."
Pixar,3axgnk,EndorPK,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:04:29 2015 UTC,"In case you didn't notice, at that point in the film Joy was a Control Freak hell-bent on maintaining her iron grip on Riley's brain.  She also could've been worried that the other Emotions could affect the Core Memories the same way Sadness did.  Just because they had never done it before didn't mean that they couldn't.  Joy and Sadness got dragged along with the memory balls when the system automatically engaged.  Fear attempted to use it in a manner completely unrelated to it's function.  Also because it was funny.  It could be argued that the rocket was an extension of Bing Bong, thus it didn't begin to degrade until he did.  Bing Bong couldn't read because Riley imagined him before she could.  Joy was optimistic and desperate, and Sadness had no spine due to a life of passive-aggressive bullying and abuse."

Pixar,3avpv1,JangoSnow,3,Tue Jun 23 21:52:50 2015 UTC,Yes! This is so true....
Pixar,3ax3uf,orangemonkey21,7,Wed Jun 24 05:09:09 2015 UTC,"My theory:  They did this in order to help the audience distinguish between the parents' and Riley's headquarters in the scene.  The audience is flying between 3 characters and 13 emotions a ton of times in about 2 minutes, and it just helps us to realize who is thinking what instead of having to zoom into each brain each time.   It's one of those things that you don't realize when you watch it, but I'm sure they were very concerned about it being confusing when making the movie. I think their solution was very inventive, simple, and effective."
Pixar,3ax3uf,9YearOldNameCalling,15,Wed Jun 24 06:01:15 2015 UTC,"How about this:  Until puberty, both male and female bodies are chemically the same. However, as Testosterone and Estrogen start pumping in larger volumes, the gender sex hormones, physical sex characteristics start to develop.  So once Riley starts producing more Estrogen, all her emotions will turn feminine."
Pixar,3ax3uf,neoslith,4,Wed Jun 24 07:46:01 2015 UTC,"I noticed the Puberty on the console looked like an alarm, perhaps a warning to the emotions that BIG changes are ahead!  It would make sense if anger and fear start turning feminine for Riley.  That would be an interesting sequel: male anger gets even more angry as he become she, and ends up switching demeanor from red anger to icy rage.  Have a boy go through it too and his female sadness, joy, and disgust have to figure out masculine forms of the same.  That would probably push the envelope a bit too far even for Pixar though."
Pixar,3ax3uf,MrFiregem,7,Thu Jun 25 11:39:09 2015 UTC,"I remember in an interview, Docter said that he just made it that way to have a more diverse cast and hoped 'no one would notice'."
Pixar,3ax3uf,expecto_pastrami,7,Wed Jun 24 09:49:49 2015 UTC,"When asked about the genders of the emotions, Pete Docter said, ""It was intuitive. It felt to me like Anger's very masculine, I don't know why ... Sadness felt a little more feminine and Mindy Kahling as Disgust felt right ... with Mom and Dad, we skewed them all male and all female for a quick read, because you have to understand where we are, which is a little phony but hopefully people don't mind!"""

Pixar,3asuvr,theclawww,3,Tue Jun 23 12:04:05 2015 UTC,"Read the article.  It's based on research by Dr. Paul Ekman, in which Logic/Reason is an emotion.  he has a lot of research and published documents detailing his studies and what constitutes an emotion."
Pixar,3asuvr,KingBubblie,3,Tue Jun 23 15:08:53 2015 UTC,"That's kind of strange though because when I look up Dr. Paul Ekman, whenever I see a group of six emotions, it's joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. It's weird they were going to replace surprise with logic because this group of six is pretty prominent in Ekman's research."
Pixar,3asuvr,windkirby,3,Sun Jun 28 20:38:42 2015 UTC,"I think they made a good call cutting reason. It's not really a core emotion, but a more complex one. It seems to me that reason is more a mild mix of Fear and Disgust. The former applies the necessary caution to consider that your initial impressions of something might be wrong, which is dangerous, while the latter is in charge of determining what is right based on your observations, in the same way that she dictates taste. That's not to say that they're solely responsible, there's a lot of work going on outside HQ, but those two together make up skepticism.  Incidentally the reason that ""logical"" thinking seems cold and unsympathetic is because it's dictated by the two distancing emotions."

Had she not interfered with Sadness changing the core memories to blue and hadn't tried to block the blue core memory of Riley crying in class, everything would have been fine.   Hell even Bing Bong would still be rattling around in Riley's mind and not forgotten forever."
Pixar,3asgxb,nihilance,8,Tue Jun 23 05:04:43 2015 UTC,"While it looks like that's the case, both of those events catalyzed (or were part of) a maturation or emotional development that would have happened anyway. Joy was kind of an asshole, but that was just a representation of the fact that happiness  is the dominant emotion when we are young, but secedes to allow for sadness and fear to take control some of the time. This is because when we are just happy, we are vulnerable because we take everything for granted and trust everything. When we start to have the necessity for those other emotions, they will surface in one way or another, so to sum up this little essay, Joy was far from a bad guy because she caused events that would have happened regardless and needed to happen."

Pixar,3asgxb,spivliv,3,Sat Jun 27 20:39:03 2015 UTC,"I explained this in another thread, so I'm just gonna copy/paste it here:  You can't control emotions. You can try to make yourself feel one thing but your true feelings are still internal. Nobody is happy all the time, that's not healthy. You can try to hide the sadness but it's still there. As someone who suffers from depression the movie really hit home. There are a lot of times when I just don't feel anything or I'm overcome with sadness. The point of the movie is to show that there isn't always just one single emotion. Your emotions are there to help keep a balance and knowing how to properly express them. Joy was the one making everything harder. She wouldn't let Riley be Sad or Upset. Joy was the one ruining everything by ""Always making Riley happy."" She wanted to be the head honcho and keep Riley smiling. But that's the thing with people; we're not always happy. It's okay to feel sad. It's okay to feel angry. It's good to let out your feelings and not keep them bottled up. Joy would always repress Sadness and that's why this whole thing turned into a disaster"
Pixar,3avabc,The_Swarm_Hut,5,Tue Jun 23 20:01:53 2015 UTC,"There were two posts recently, don't remember if they were here, that sorta go against this. Apparently Logic was supposed to be a surprise 6th emotion but ended up getting cut (he was orange).  And during the scene where Fear and Disgust tried to be Joy, Fear became denial and Disgust became sarcasm."
Pixar,3avabc,Kingofthered,-1,Tue Jun 23 20:11:00 2015 UTC,They didn't become them. They just acted like them. Joy crying in the Memory Pit doesn't make her Sadness (please don't take that as rude).
Pixar,3avabc,Kingofthered,2,Tue Jun 23 20:27:08 2015 UTC,"Not at all!  And I suppose I don't mean they BECAME them outright, but the effects they had on Riley when they attempted to be Joy were undeniably Sarcasm and Denial.   It is an interesting point that Joy can be sad, but it took an awful lot of stress to cause it. Wonder what could make the other emotions change their tone a bit, or if they have their own little emotions."

Pixar,3avabc,BroadcastStew,2,Wed Jun 24 22:03:37 2015 UTC,"Good theory. If this were real I don't think sarcasm would be the new emotion though. I think it could be...   Love: Since she is going through puberty after the movie she could have a crush. This is pretty unlikely though because if they were to introduce love it would probably be pink or something like that  Mischief: Maybe this is too close to joy but it seems to fit orange quite well  Greed: Orange represents greed in the emotional spectrum so I thought I would add it in   These are most likely all wrong but I thought I would give my opinion  However the reason I don't think a new emotion would be introduced is because in the movie we see in the minds of other people including adults and they don't have a sixth emotion so it wouldn't make sence for just Riley to gain an emotion and if everyone gained a new emotion it would make less sense.  Anyway, thanks for that theory :)"

Pixar,3aqos6,popthabubble,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:32:38 2015 UTC,"The article stated that in the selections shown, the rendered environments looked like ""Ansel Adams photographs,"" so I can safely assume that will be properly satisfied.  As said above, the removal of the comedians from the final film cannot hurt it.  By refocusing the story on the two main characters (played by largely unknown young actors) and focusing on telling a story visually (the director previously made the short Partly Cloudy, which was engaging both in its look and the feelings it evoked), they've already distanced themselves from the pitfalls of Ice Age, which hired mostly comedians to act and relied on watered-down comedy bits that would have been equally at home in an Adam Sandler film of the last decade.  Unrelated to the main topic:  I thought about the contrast between The Croods and Brave and found myself preferring the former.  They're similar:  period pieces about overprotective parents wanting what's best and having to learn to accept their limitations and ultimately step out of the way.    However, in my view, the The Croods succeeded where Brave failed.  Grug saw the error of his ways on his own and grew as a person, even offering himself as a sacrifice to save his family, knowing his way and his time had passed.  Elinor, on the other hand, didn't really seem to come to any realization on her own, and it took her daughter using a pretty cruel (if not completely intentional) trick to get her to that point.    And, of course, both How to Train Your Dragon movies blew Brave away, without question."

Pixar,3aqos6,LiteralHeadCannon,0,Tue Jun 23 00:45:20 2015 UTC,"The most impactful parts of the best Pixar films aren't due to their dialogue, with few exceptions (Ego's review from Ratatouille, being an example of one).  Toy Story - Buzz trying to fly in Sid's house. Woody knocking Buzz out the window. The montage as Woody is slowly ""replaced"" by Buzz.  Toy Story 2 - Jessie's backstory. /thread  Finding Nemo - Marlin's interaction with the last, tiny, scarred egg while the unborn Nemo looks terrified.  The Incredibles - The hulking form of Bob, once a powerful superhero, confined in that tiny car, the color desaturated from the image, a look of exhaustion and depression on his face as a stark contrast to the fun and colorful sequence in the opening.  WALL-E - The entire opening third.  Toy Story 3 - The gang holding hands as they descend into the hellish fires of the landfill furnace.  Andy playing with Bonnie.  Up! - The opening sequence.  Inside Out - Riley's face in any scene.  Spoiler  Some of these scenes include dialogue, but it doesn't improve them.  It's incidental to the visual storytelling that takes place, and these scenes would be equally powerful without it."
Pixar,3aqos6,LiteralHeadCannon,2,Tue Jun 23 16:49:30 2015 UTC,"God, I hate people who undervalue screenwriting in the name of promoting visual storytelling.  Yes, the moments you describe are great film, and good visual storytelling is vital to them.  No, the ones that involve dialogue would not be ""equally powerful"" without dialogue.  If a film would be ""equally powerful"" without something... why is it there?  To appease people with inferior taste?"
Pixar,3aqos6,LiteralHeadCannon,-1,Fri Jun 26 07:39:29 2015 UTC,"In taut political thrillers, heist movies, period dramas, and clever comedies dialogue is very important. I aspired to be a screenwriter at one point and I love well crafted dialogue. However, I also believe in economy of storytelling and the notion of ""show, don't tell.""  An example of dialogue diminishing what could have been an amazing piece would be the DreamWorks animated short for ""Home"" that came out last year. In the hands of a better filmmaker, the entire story could have been delivered without a word of dialogue as hopeful aliens tried to find a new world to inhabit.  Instead, dialogue marred the film and I was annoyed and bored.   Compare with the best of the Pixar shorts, ""Lifted,"" ""Presto,"" ""Geri's Game,"" and a slew of others without a single word spoken. Do the ""Mater"" toons stand up anywhere near as well?   Necessary dialogue when written well is brilliant. Ricardo Montalban chewing scenery in The Wrath of Khan as he delivers lines like, ""He tasks me. He tasks me and I shall have him! I'll chase him 'round the moons of Nibia and 'round the Antares Maelstrom and 'round perdition's flames before I give him up!"" is delightful and amazing to behold.   However, too many screenwriters take themselves too seriously, see themselves as too important. It's thanks to the Damon Lindelofs of the world we have unnecessarily complicated plots and structures and contradictions and awful films like Prometheus and the terrible Star Trek reboots.   The opening scene of Star Wars features no dialogue but immediately establishes the power and reach of the Empire and the fleeting, tiny hope of the Rebellion as a tiny ship is chased by an enormous Star Destroyer. We didn't need awkward and stilted conversations about political machinations or board room scenes from the floor of the Imperial Senate to drive this home. Sixty seconds. Bam. Done."

I'm not explaining all of these, just the ones that I have something to say about.  .10. Finding Nemo- If you ask me, this is one of the most juvenile films Pixar has made. The humor doesn't come from witty dialogue and clever satire. It comes from silly voices and frenetic action. That's not my cup of tea.  .9. Toy Story 2- Something about this film just rubbed me the wrong way. The introduction of Woody's roundup gang and Zurg felt like retcons. I didn't like that they gave these characters their own universes.  .8. Monsters Inc.  .7. A Bug's Life  .6. Inside Out- Good movie with good emotions, but Joy and Sadness's story seems really similar to other kids adventure movies.  .5. Monsters University- Damn Pixar, you know how to wake college students up with a dose of reality don't you. This has to be the ""realest"" film that Pixar has made.  .4. Toy Story  .3. Ratatouille  .2. The Incredibles- This movie just gets better and better every time I see it.  .1. Toy Story 3"

But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends. Last night, I experienced something new: an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau's famous motto, ""Anyone can cook."" But I realize, only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist can come from anywhere. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at Gusteau's, who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in France.

Not only is it a meaningful echo to the 2nd movie when Mr. Potato Head saved them, but also the Aliens were always the ones who accepted their fate and thought that they were controlled by a higher power (the claw) and to see them once and for all take matters into their own hands and decide their own fates and the fates of their friends, it just showed real growth and made me really damn happy) Cars 2: I'm sorry...I just can't do it.  Brave: ""There are those who say fate is something beyond our command. That destiny is not our own, but I know better. Our fate lives within us, you only have to be brave enough to see it.""-Merida (She is right thought -- our destiny is what we want it to be. We don't have to become victims of what we feel the cards have been given to us) Monsters University: ""I act scary but most of the time, Mike, I'm terrified""-Sully (That's really the truth behind a lot of people. For as scary as they may seem at times, they're really just terrified) Inside Out: Spoiler"

I think it's interesting, however, that the official Disney blog mentioned the previous cast by name. That's not usually the way this sort of thing is handled.

Pixar,38wj0a,Sora3Ben,6,Sun Jun 7 18:36:05 2015 UTC,"I'll try, though just to preface, this is what I believe they're saying. And also, another preface, some of these rules, to me, can be bent or broken for a bit for the story  13) Making your character this person who has no opinion and just kind of goes with the flow, wouldn't seem to be all that interesting as a character. If you can't get them riled up or anything, how can you get them to really do anything then. Opinions and beliefs are very important to the motivation of having the character do something. This one ties into rule 6 well.  18) Now that I'm thinking about it, 18 seems weird to me as well. Not sure how to reply back to this one.  21) Kind of like rule 13, you have to make the character relatable. You also have to make sure that the trouble they get into and how they go around trying to solve it is a way that people have to relate to.   Now, I'm not saying all characters should have no opinions, but they should by the time the story is over with. There have been a few characters without opinions, Scott Pilgrim for what I think is an example. And same goes for even a character saying ""Cool!""

Pixar,38w232,kkheart20,10,Sun Jun 7 08:46:52 2015 UTC,"Pixar was an private company, owned by George Lucas then Steve Jobs, for years before Toy Story, and put out their own short films.  For Toy Story, they entered into a distribution deal with Disney, but remained their own company.  They went public immediately after Toy Story was released.  When Disney acquired Pixar, a major point of the merger was that the Pixar Studios maintained their independence, had control over their sequels (squashing the in-progress ""unauthorized"" Toy Story sequel), and that no other movies that they did not create were labeled as Pixar.  This is why the ""Planes"" movies are not labeled as Pixar, although they are clearly part of the Cars world.  John Lasseter and Pixar President Ed Catmull took over leadership positions in the Disney company.  At this point, Pixar acts like an independent company, but happens to be owned by Disney.  P.S.  It is mostly a leadership book, but I highly recommend Creativity, Inc. by Ed Catmull."
Pixar,38w232,RainbowRoadMushroom,4,Sun Jun 7 11:23:11 2015 UTC,"Disney owns Pixar, and distributed Pixar films even before they did own Pixar. They are all technically Disney movies. Perhaps one could argue movies since the purchase of Pixar are more Disney than those before, but regardless Disney owns the rights to them all now. In fact, before Disney bought Pixar, they owned the rights to Toy Story and had a different internal studio working on their own version of Toy Story 3 due to a disagreement with Pixar. This version obviously never saw the light of day, but some general info has leaked and is mentioned in a few Disney books and documentaries."

Pixar,38w232,TISparta217,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:27:37 2015 UTC,"It basically comes down to whether or not you believe Disney's ownership of Pixar, an independent studio, makes post-acquisition Pixar films ""Disney"" films.   Disney surely isn't about to allow Pixar to produce something truly out of line with the Disney brand, and everything Pixar produces will be integrated into the Disney world (literally and metaphorically).  That ownership surely influences Pixar, albeit subtly.   On the other hand, if the question is ""who physically made The Incredibles"", the answer is Pixar.   I think you could argue it either way, or even just call the result a ""Disney-Pixar film.""    Regardless, your friend shouldn't jump down your throat about it.

SO this awesome new dino movie where the meteor doesn't hit and they dino's live on might be a problem. Assuming it is set in the same universe in a different time, something would have to kill the dinosaurs sometime before.. Brave I guess? That could be another few billion years, so there's a good possibility something ELSE will kill em all in the Pixar universe. Sad to think about but unless the dinos evolved into human looking lizard people and secretly filled all previous Pixar movies, were out of luck trying to connect it to the theory. I'll have to wait until I see the movie obviously but those are my thoughts! If you read this far you deserve a prize, but I'm not gonna give you one."

It's kind of strange to think that there are two Pixar movies coming out this year."
Pixar,388f0p,beeradthelaw,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:34:11 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about? The film was announced officially at the same D23 as Inside Out, and was later removed from the 2014 line up. (""The Untitled Pixar Film that Takes You Inside the Mind"" and ""The Untitled Pixar Film about Dinosaurs"") We really didn't get anything on Inside Out until December, so aside from the delay the ""lack of information"" is about the same as it was for inside out.  Additionally...there WERE leaks regarding the film in both the Up B-roll clips from 2009 (which pure speculation until the aforementioned D23) and a poster that was leaked last year, which came out BEFORE the Inside Out trailers, and characters were shown off."

Pixar,388f0p,ClassicUnderacheever,8,Tue Jun 2 16:18:43 2015 UTC,"What worries me is the main character's model looks out of place with the environment.

Pixar,388f0p,klaykid123,5,Tue Jun 2 21:58:02 2015 UTC,Wouldn't that apply to Up and The Incredibles too though?
Pixar,388f0p,BadLuckMichael,13,Tue Jun 2 22:02:15 2015 UTC,I think UP had smoother and more brightly colored environments with textures and models that mimiced the art style. Nothing was hyper-realistic like The Croods. This trailer shows a Toy Story looking dinosaur coupled with Brave environments. It looks out of place right now.

Pixar,388f0p,BadLuckMichael,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:12:11 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing. But after Peter Sohn took over as director he put nature as the main antagonist. So maybe that's the reason for the photorealism; maybe it'll come into play storywise.

So pumped for this!"

Indiana Jones/Han Solo could be a possibility since they own those characters now, but I just don't see it happening. If they were going to go that route, they'd just use one of their Marvel Characters since they're more well known.  Plus, with Roger Rabbit, that was well before Disney purchased Marvel."

Pixar,36gpzm,weewhomp,1 point,Tue May 19 16:45:24 2015 UTC,"It does matter. I can tell you right now that Pixar will NEVER put Batman or any other DC character into one of their films, unless Disney buys DC as well. Even if they did, it would still be very highly unlikely, because Pixar enjoys creating their own characters and doesn't need to rely on Batman to get people to go and see their film. He wouldn't be a main character, just a reference (going back to the part about Pixar wanting to create their own characters), so having him in there for a minute or two wouldn't really boost ticket sales.  I'll let you enjoy your idea of having Batman in TS4, but in reality, it's never going to happen."

That's 5 other superhero movies in that calendar year, almost all of which will be very special-effects heavy.

Pixar,33ia1f,theshahshahid,6,Wed Apr 22 19:11:51 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting perspective but I think it paints too light a picture of the lives that the humans on the Axiom are living. Conveniently it ignores the physical detriments that happen when in space for so long, and the fact that while they are ostensibly a social culture, they see only what comes to them on a screen. It is a very curated environment, one in which they have no opportunity for challenge or discovery. Having one's needs met and presumably all pleasurable experiences available all the time doesn't make for a fulfilling life, and I think that's part of what the movie is trying to communicate.  Interestingly put but ultimately I think it's a misrepresentation of what the movie's message is."
Pixar,33ia1f,rainbowdarling,3,Wed Apr 22 19:58:58 2015 UTC,"It’s tricky because the movie is clever about how it makes you hate BnL     Is it? I never hated BnL and I never go the idea we were supposed to either. They gave people everything they wanted but never thought about the consequences of what they were doing; they weren't supposed to be villains, they were trying to be heroes (well, a corporate version of a hero anyway. As companies go, they were pretty damn good.) People on the Axiom got everything they wanted, but only because they never even knew the stuff they were missing. They didn't even notice they had a swimming pool on the ship because it wasn't one of the things that got pumped into their minds from the viewing screen.     The humans we see have [...] romantic relationships,      Uh... no they don't. We only see two humans interacting in anything approaching a romantic encounter and they're the ones Wall-E first interacts with. There are children, but given the sedentary lifestyle they have it seems likely that's all taken care of by robots as well.     Though we see shots of life rebuilding itself peacefully, won’t humans just make the same mistakes again and damage Earth completely this time?     The Axiom still works, they're not fighting for survival or anything. There's still no shortage of resources.  This all seems like a poorly thought out idea by someone who missed the point of the film. Plus it's by the guy who made the ridiculous Pixar theory so no wonder."

He was told ""We like your stuff but we think you need more experience"" a lot. He sent his portfolio to pixar a year before they contacted him and gave him the job offer to do character designs for Monsters University. He mentioned that Monsters Inc was one of his favorite movies of all time and meant a lot to him, so it was insane for him to be working on the sequel."

Pixar,335uec,low_ho_fosho,5,Mon Apr 20 06:07:55 2015 UTC,It got me really excited to see it in theaters. Inside Out provides such a creative interpretation of how our minds and emotions work. It looks really promising and features a bunch of great voices. Amy Poehler as Joy is so perfect.
Pixar,335uec,The_Swarm_Hut,2,Mon Apr 20 08:01:25 2015 UTC,All of the trailers so far have been amazing!  Thanks for adding to the excitement and sharing!  I'm even more excited now!
Pixar,337p0h,cartoonmind,5,Mon Apr 20 08:14:44 2015 UTC,Another silly criticism. This idea of emotions/characters living in somebody's head is as old as time.
Pixar,337p0h,Portgas,1 point,Tue Apr 21 09:33:51 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head, there is a Star Trek: TNG episode which includes a similar premise about an archaeological artifact (every person containing dozens of internal personalities) at the beginning of the episode.  Inside Out is a not a new idea, but then neither was Toy Story. (though, I think Monsters, Inc. might actually be one of the more original Pixar concepts)"
Pixar,337p0h,Chris857,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:35:22 2015 UTC,They might as well accuse Pixar of stealing the idea from The Numskulls.

Pixar,32s9p3,Dommeister,5,Thu Apr 16 11:57:12 2015 UTC,"The director of the short (Josh Cooley) stated a month back that the short is supposed to go on the blu-ray, but those are usually unrated. The fact that Disney screened it to get a rating from the MPAA clearly shows that they are currently mulling around with the idea of making it theatrical, probably in the event that Inside Out is a huge hit.   Usually insiders are already furious doing research on how they think the film will do, so this is a great sign of confidence. I'm not sure, but this could go attached to The Good Dinosaur, which still has yet to get a short announced."

They're always testing some new technology and what better way to test it than to show it in front of millions of people?  I'm ridiculously excited for Inside Out. I was almost this excited for Brave when it came out and I loved that movie (though it did not exceed my high expectations, it still was an amazing Pixar movie!).

I never knew about the accidental deletion which I just looked up, but there was also that point later when they decided the film wasn't good enough and to rewrite most of it.  ""After the deletion and restoration of Toy Story 2, the team was likely hoping for an uneventful path to release, but it was not to be.  In the Christmas of ’98, after the release of A Bug’s Life and the promotional tour was done, John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter and legendary story man Joe Ranft all came to the production team to take a look at Toy Story 2.  It was not a good film. They dedicated the winter vacation to re-writing the project almost entirely from the ground up. Production shut down on December 15th and came back after New Year’s in January, when the story team re-pitched the movie""  Source: http://thenextweb.com/media/2012/05/21/how-pixars-toy-story-2-was-deleted-twice-once-by-technology-and-again-for-its-own-good/  You probably knew about all that though considering you knew about the deletion...

Pixar,2znqvn,thezebulonian,1 point,Fri Mar 20 13:13:49 2015 UTC,"Monsters University Japanese trailer actually revealed the climatic scene in the human world. And it was HALF the trailer.   So I was surprised this wasn't too bad, but there's definitely some stuff from late on in the movie there. I always get the vibe that Japanese trailers are crafted to hinge on cliffhangers, and the only real way to mine that out of a movie is to show a bit of it where the movie is at its highest point of tension, therefore crafting the best ""cliffhanger"" situation.  Similar to how the MU trailer pondered how Mike and Sulley will get out of the human world, this trailer also (translated) asks, ""What will be the fate of Riley?"" as she walks away, forelorn.   They're weird like that."

Other than that I'm really excited for this movie and can't wait to see how sad and funny it will be because we can already see in one of the seen that the little girl was crying in class and my guess on this is probably depression or most likely a mental breakdown."

Gary Rydstrom: It was going to be a romantic comedy about the last two of a species that are forced together. What's nice about ""Strange Magic"" is that I got to do a love story. I realized that love stories are hard to tell. That's what I was working on with ""Newt"" -- trying to do a good, old-fashioned romantic comedy. There were a lot of ideas there... Again how many times can a story be told about two unlikely characters getting together... But ""Strange Magic,"" which was George's idea, not mine... But it's too unlikely characters getting together and I could get the feeling that I enjoyed with ""Newt,"" I could get from doing ""Strange Magic.""   And that was all that was said."

Its the perfect way to have the series end on a high note with us still being able to check in on our favorite characters once in a while.   That being said, I hope Toy Story 4 gets shelved (I'm still holding out. 3 was shelved for a while). But I am eagerly awaiting the Incredibles sequel they announced at the same time."

As long as they don't try to retread the same ground, there is lots more to cover."

Toy Story is the second best profitable next to Cars because it's easy to make a bunch of actual toys/junk out of, hence Toy Story getting its 4th movie and Cars getting a 3rd. I personally don't have high hopes for it, but like stated by others, I'm not the target audience anymore. At least this movie will bring the new era of children into Toy Story."

First, for people who don't really have top-notch showreels of cutting-edge computer graphics and animation work yet, they have the Pixar Undergraduate Program (the PUPs for short) where you are basically in class during most of the summer learning from employees and do a group project, but aren't really thrown right into doing production work and real job assignments like an intern. I don't see PUPs recruitment on Pixar's website now (although I might have missed it) but when I google for it I see copies of the info on other sites like here Second, there's the main internship program they take interns into different departments, an for an animation internship you should show that you are an awesome character animator, for a production internship you should show that you can lead and organize things, for a TD internship you should have impressive technical skills in computer graphics although art skills are a plus for them too. Third, they have a top-level sort of internship for people who already have graduated so they aren't enrolled as students anymore, called a Residency, which is something where after the Residency ends they review your work and if all goes well offer you a full-time job.   Actually all of these can end up leading to a full-time job at Pixar. They all are ways that some employees first got their foot in the door. Also, all of these are really competitive -- think about how good you'd have to be to get an internship at The Daily Show or any other place where thousands of college students would all love to work, and that's the scale we're talking about."

Brave was a good movie and I was happy to finally see a female lead in a Pixar movie, but it was a tad predictable and lacked the Pixar spark if you ask me (just personal opinion on this one, I want to emphasize again that I do think Brave is a quality movie!). MU was direct-to-DVD quality in my opinion. It was a standard college frat movie with no originality. I simply can't agree with you on any level that it was a great movie. Unfortunately, I've grown very cynical about Pixar movies especially with the new glut of sequels. Looking at future Pixar movies, you find Finding Dory, Toy Story 4, The Incredibles 2 (okay, obviously I'm actually excited about that), and Cars 3 (really?!). I love Pixar for their insane amount of original stories, which generally doesn't include sequals. I loved Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3, but I hated Cars 2 and felt very meh about Monsters University.

I still enjoy both, but I am so much happier when my son picks University. It was really good, and I'm sorry that you don't like it much.  Granted I also feel that both Planes movies are better than Cars 2, even if all three should have been direct to DVD. And while it's not made by Pixar the film was co-written and executive produced by Pixar chief creative officer John Lasseter, the director of the Cars films. To me that's like complaining that Halo 4 wasn't made by Bungie, even though the lead design team was made up of the same people that made Halo 1-3.  Also, to be fair to Pixar in regards to sequels. The sequels wouldn't be made if there wasn't a demand for them. People have been begging for a Nemo sequel since its release, including the actors.

That money will put keep the studio in the black which will let them experiment. Brave was an experiment (a successful one, all opinions aside) and I think MU was one too.   (Honestly,  MU could have had more work done on the story, but I think they really wanted to do a sequel, but did not want to include Boo, just to annoy us and maybe Brave was a bit predictable, but I still love it to pieces).   Don't fret. Non-sequels are coming our way and I don't think that they'll continue this less-than-Pixar's-standards rut."

Pixar,2qbmmn,wilymon,16,Wed Dec 24 23:56:02 2014 UTC,"I'm not so sure about the how, but Pixar isn't trying to use celebrity voice actors to sell their product. DreamWorks is. That explains the why, anyway."
Pixar,2qbmmn,gomarky,3,Thu Dec 25 05:46:04 2014 UTC,"Everything at its foundation is about making the best story possible: Their process, their dedication to honest feedback, their unending desire for detail + artistry, their leading edge technology and, yes, their voice talent. As you can see, their voice talent is one of a mix of elements that go into that precious goal of creating a fantastic story.  More importantly (and more to the point of your question), this story-centered approach is in its cultural DNA -- from the writers to the artists to the technicians to the marketing department and so on. It's a simple central concept, yet difficult thing to engender into an entire company.   Most companies are like Dreamworks where the departments are not unified around a central cultural belief. So, you'll find situations like theirs where they promote the voice talent and not the story.  Take a look at all of the trailers that Pixar has ever done. Most of the time, the trailer is a small story in and of itself. The only time a Pixar trailer ever sounds like it's marketing something is when they say things like, ""From the creators of 'Finding Nemo', 'The Incredibles', etc."" Again -- they're referencing other stories because THAT is what is important to them. THAT is what they are dedicated to."
Pixar,2qbmmn,banksnld,2,Thu Dec 25 06:57:32 2014 UTC,"manages to avoid that (with the exception of Mike and Sully, but even there it works)   Don't forget Woody & Buzz Lightyear. :)  And John Ratzenberger - he's in every one, and it's usually easy to pick out his voice. ;)  But then, on the other end of the spectrum - I didn't realize that Patton Oswalt was the voice of Remi in Ratatouille until years after it came out."
Pixar,2qbmmn,ARayofLight,3,Fri Dec 26 03:53:48 2014 UTC,"I think you have some positive reinforcement right now from this, because if you look at some of their other movies, some of these actors stand out bright as day.  Toy Story has some clearly recognizable voices in it.  Both Tim Allen and Tom Hanks are quite easy to spot in their respective roles in the movie.  In fact the character models for Buzz Lightyear and Woody had their faces patterned after their voice actors.  Wallace Shawn as Rex has one of the most recognizable voices in character acting, and John Ratzenberger of course became the studio's gag.  Kevin Spacey in A Bug's Life, Samuel Jackson in The Incredibles (let's not forget Wallace Shawn again as Mr. Incredible's boss at the beginning), Owen Wilson and Paul Newmen in Cars, Christopher Plummer in Up (another character model which looks like the voice actor), Ellen DeGeneres in Finding Nemo, with enough star power that they're making a sequel all about her character now--  almost every movie they've ever produced had some voices that were very recognizable and obvious.  I think the only one where that wasn't the case for myself was WALL-E, with the exception of the John Ratzenberger gag which is ever constant, and that's because the main leads were robots who spoke via pitch.  You already mentioned Monsters Inc./Monsters University, but I disagree.  The characters have always been very clearly voiced and are recognizable in their roles immediately."
Pixar,2qbmmn,might_be_a_troll,2,Thu Dec 25 15:12:35 2014 UTC,Part of it is character design. Dreamworks likes to work the look of the actor into the character design (Look at Shark Tale) and it kind of makes it just seem like cartoon versions of the actors.

Toys are replicas of real things, mostly, so the idea of ""living toys"" is an acceptable fantasy. They also are aware of their position in service to humans. Cars defies this logic. There are no humans in Cars land, so what is there purpose? Wall-E was better attempt at this idea.  I think Lasseter's love for toy cars influenced  his sensibility. Cars as a one-off may have stood as a noble experiment, but the sequel showed that they really believed cars were ""human like.""

All that magnifies the jokes for me. The TV specials shoot for much heart, while the shorts go for jokes.   Partysaurus Rex: Uses the idea of bath time and pool time toys to their best potential, noting how those toys are often armless, establishing a class system of sinkers and swimmers and rocking a frenzied but perfectly paced game of escalation with a simple bathtub set. If it had a little more heart, it would be perfect, but Rex's story of acceptance is pretty close. 9/10  Small Fry: Set in a fast food place, a totally fitting location for a Toy Story, this short serves as showcase for a ludicrous number (almost too many actually) of oddball pint-sized characters and has an incredible amount of fun tickling your brain, reminding you of all of the truly strange single-action plastic pieces that probably graced your bedroom thanks to hamburger joints. Mini Buzz is particularly hilarious. Between sympathizing for those poor Happy Meal Toys that are stuck in the plastic display instead of going into kid's meals and poking fun at a ball pit, Small Fry nails location right away. The short also delves into the psyches of casually discarded toys more than any Toy Story before it. At least in previous films toys were adopted into a new community like the daycare. Drops the ball at the end having Buzz go to-and-fro the restaurant with too much unexplained ease. 8/10  Toy Story That Time Forgot: Plays on the idea of that one friend who had EVERY toy because their parents spoiled them. It felt new to use the ""complete set"" to transport the toys to a land-within-a-room, with a brilliantly haunting box-canyon. It was also a good excuse to revisit all of the accessories and buttons surrounding action figures that Buzz couldn't in the first film. The short does well to play on the idea of virtual games slowly replacing physical toy time, and has fun with the concept of making your toys be whatever you want them to be when at play, then exploring the repercussions it might have on the toy's feelings. Seeing Rex get giant arms fit great, though they missed a beat allowing him to play the video game for a little bit. Best heart of any short yet, just some of the dino playset moments dragged. 8/10  Toy Story of Terror: Plays with the idea that a toy left in its box for too long might acquire a phobia. Kind of became a retread of Toy Story 2 with eBay toy selling. We got a Pez dispenser and GI Joe homage that were decent but not incredibly memorable. Motel was a so-so location and the lizard didn't add much. TV run time made it feel a bit stretched, however. 5/10  Hawaiian Vacation: Missing almost all of the deeper concepts that make the other shorts great. Just lots of visual gags trying to make a bedroom look Hawaiian. 2/10"
Pixar,2o4d3f,spoilerfilm,3,Wed Dec 3 22:23:06 2014 UTC,"Hawaiian Vacation wasn't that bad.  Something I noticed is that in That Time Forgot, the toys slept when they aren't supposed to sleep. Also the stuffing taken away from the monkey during the battle was returned when bonnie came back :S"

However, when Bonnie and Mason come over and play, we see Angel Kitty on the skeleton car, sans trumpet.  So what happened? Is Angel Kitty... gone?"

Pixar,2n70n1,Redtutel,9,Tue Dec 9 20:52:33 2014 UTC,"I think it would be nice if they aged them with the movie, similar to what Toy Story 3 did. I would love to see what the kids (especially Jack Jack) could do with a couple years practicing their powers."

The original writer clearly has no idea what makes the Toy Story franchise so appealing. Not toys going on a Brave Little Toaster adventure to figure out the concept of ""work"", but to learn to cooperate to fulfill their desires to serve the humans as they see fit.

You could also focus on the problem that lots of older parents face: Jack-jack is now moving into being a teenager, his powers are still uncontrollable and now more volatile, his parents are a bit too old and tired to know how to help him cope, while his older siblings are caught up in their own lives."

The twist is that the now pre-adolescent Jack-jack is torn, because this new super villain has been coming through his closet every night to tell jokes! Basically its one of the monsters from the Monster World who wants to take advantage of super powered humans to take over both worlds.  The emotional conflict would stem from the fact that Bob feels like he's no longer his son's hero and is losing him to the villain. Of course by the end the family is reunited and fights together to banish him back to whence he came."

Pixar,2lioom,Ninjabackwards,18,Fri Nov 7 08:55:25 2014 UTC,"I posted this in another sub, about why I don't think it hurts the message of the 3rd movie at all:  Part of the point of Toy Story 3 was that it WASN'T the ending. The entire movie sets itself up like an endgame, but it calms down in the end, to tell you that it's not. All the Toys (especially Woody) convinced themselves that letting go of Andy would be the end. But, in the end Woody is able to discover that letting go of someone you care about ISN'T the end, but instead...it's a new beginning. Like moving on to college.  Seriously, think about it...if Pixar was to stop at 3, what kind of message would that send? Especially to the fans of the originals who went off to college after 3? ""Well, that's it. Your childhood is over. You can never go back to the things you loved. You have to pass them on to the next generation.""  No. Pixar isn't like that. Your ""childhood"" never needs to end. You'll always be a kid inside. Pixar understood what Toy Story 3 was trying to say, and it finally makes sense with the announcement of 4. Toy Story 3 was NOT and was NEVER intended to be the end. It was intended to be a new beginning. The Toy's being given to Bonnie is the transition into this.  ...The Toys, the Audience, even Andy are convinced of the end. But, they learn to move on to new things. If Pixar stopped at 3...this message would be lost, and maybe it was. Hopefully, Toy Story 4 will take this route and try to push this idea of a new beginning."

Pixar,2lioom,Tarijeno,7,Thu Nov 6 22:49:01 2014 UTC,"But I'm not saying I walked away from that movie thinking ""Gosh, it feels like the series is over."" I'm saying that the characters in the movie literally grew up and moved on. The ending of the film was presented as an ending to the series.  Tacking on another sequel makes about as much sense as Terminator 3, 4, and 5. I mean sure, it's kind of cool to see Arnie walking around as the Terminator for another couple of movies, but Terminator 2 ended the series. The chip was destroyed. Judgment day was averted.

Pixar,2lioom,Mordkay,2,Thu Nov 6 22:26:46 2014 UTC,My biggest grievance with this is simply the very last scene in Toy Story 3 where it goes to those iconic clouds. Unless 4 also ends with those clouds I will start burning things.
Pixar,2lioom,Lukeazade11134,1 point,Fri Nov 7 04:38:50 2014 UTC,"This is great news, TS3 ended Andys chapter beautifully, and now with Bonnie there is a chance to explore new stories.

Pixar,2lioom,ArcadeGoon,1 point,Sun Nov 9 20:59:40 2014 UTC,"If the characters stay the same, I disagree with this idea. Toy Story 3 was a really great way to end the serie. The meaning of the last movie will be lost if they really do a Toy Story 4 with Buzz, Woody and the gang. I think the TV specials and the short episodes were more than enough.  However,I wouldn't be angry if they do Toy Story 4 with a totally different cast of characters."

Pixar,2ljyw7,softcore_robot,6,Fri Nov 7 05:34:03 2014 UTC,"I thought it ended pretty perfect - as they designed it. Id have to assume, given their track record of being OCD on all their movies, a sequel to a perfect trilogy was an incredibly hard sell internally. The idea must be so good that it got everyone on board.  I love Bonnie and the new gang so I hope it gives everyone more screen time. I just want Combat Carl included. We'll have to wait and see. It's win-win for us."
Pixar,2ljyw7,cutlass_supreme,3,Fri Nov 7 19:50:56 2014 UTC,Toy Story 4 is going to make Toy Story 3 look like it doesn't matter.
Pixar,2liy25,hawaii5bro,5,Thu Nov 6 23:35:17 2014 UTC,"I think the only actually bad film they've made so far is Cars 2. I am concerned at the current upcoming slate, and question the necessity of sequels to so many films.  However, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt until I (or reviewers) have seen them though. It's possible they've had a genius idea that they can execute wonderfully to produce a great sequel (a la Terminator 2)."
Pixar,2liy25,kerbal314,3,Fri Nov 7 01:20:50 2014 UTC,"Honestly, the only sequel that make sense ( or at least sounds interesting) is Incredibles 2 and that's because it's a superhero movie and those characters can be developed further quite easily without too much worry of making a bad movie.  But Finding Dory and Toy Story 4 sound like cash grabs because those movies felt like they had an end and didn't need expanding. Maybe Pixar's management has changed enough where instead of making a cool movie, it's now about making the most money where ever possible. Regardless, it is slightly worrying."
Pixar,2liy25,carrotstix,2,Fri Nov 7 01:24:32 2014 UTC,"We've still got Inside Out coming out next year, which looks like it might be amazing. Then the Good Dinosaur, and Lee Unkrich's 'Dia de Los Muertos' film. It's not like they're making nothing but sequels."
Pixar,2liy25,Dommeister,2,Thu Nov 13 11:20:54 2014 UTC,"I like Monsters University MORE than Monster's Inc. Maybe it's that I watched it while I was in college, but definitely struck me a lot closer.  Hardscrabble is a WAY better ""villain"" than Waterneuse, and I loved the characterization in that movie.  That said, it's really hard to compete with Boo.  Anyway, I too am a bit worried about Pixar. Finding Nemo is one of my least favorite Pixar movies, so I really don't want to see a sequel. I was never interested in Cars, and Toy Story 4 undermines the series amazing closure. Inside Out doesn't really seem like my cup of tea either.   The only two upcoming Pixar films I'm excited for are Incredibles 2 and The Good Dinosaur. I have complete faith in Brad Bird's directing chops, so Incredibles 2 isn't hard to get excited for. Good Dinosaur is being directed by a guy who has done a lot of work with Bird, so there is reason to be excited for that too."
Pixar,2liy25,Fluffydipper,1 point,Fri Nov 14 19:26:34 2014 UTC,"Well, the only reason they weren't making sequels before was because Disney did not allow it due to some contract. I think the Pixar team is just experimenting now since they have free roam to make sequels as they please."

Pixar,2kjl8b,velkro16,3,Tue Oct 28 05:43:19 2014 UTC,I saw this article in /r/anime but I chose the comment on the this subreddit because I really feel that if these guys get together Pixar is going to make this thing really take off and not trigger. I didn't want to get down voted off the subreddit. I love trigger but I don't want to see a Pixar film Triggerfied. I think there more to Trigger animation than the crass and over the top elements they at to their beautiful animation.

Pixar,2k6zxm,briquet42,3,Fri Oct 24 13:28:04 2014 UTC,I've been loving Disney's 3D re-releases so far. Finding Nemo was spectacular. Can't wait.
Pixar,2k6zxm,aircycle,2,Fri Oct 24 18:14:37 2014 UTC,"I can't wait either, but the ""10th Anniversary Re-Release"" idea doesn't seem to be what's happening. The Incredibles came out November 5, 2004 -- if they were releasing it next week it would already be promoted and on theater schedules.  Maybe instead they'll wait to release it a year or two before Incredibles II comes out (whenever that is), so they can promote the sequel by keeping the franchise fresh in people's minds. If I2 isn't even in production yet, and Brad Bird is still working on Tomorrowland, I suspect we'll have to wait a few years for this to hit theaters. (If I'm wrong about this, let me know, and I'll go buy tickets for the upcoming screening...)"

This marks the first time that Illumination Entertainment made a sequel film.  Steve Carell, Russell Brand, and Miranda Cosgrove reprise their roles as Gru, Dr. Nefario and Margo, respectively. Kristen Wiig, who played Miss Hattie in the first film, voices agent Lucy Wilde, while Ken Jeong, who played the Talk Show Host, voices Floyd Eagle-san. New cast members include Benjamin Bratt as Eduardo (aka El Macho) and Steve Coogan as Silas Ramsbottom, head of the Anti-Villain League (AVL).  The film premiered on June 5, 2013 in Australia,  and was theatrically released in the United States on July 3, 2013.  The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, and was nominated for Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and for Academy Award for Best Original Song (for ""Happy""), losing both to Disney's Frozen. Grossing over $970 million worldwide against its budget of $76 million,   the film became the second-highest-grossing animated film of 2013, the third-highest-grossing film of 2013, and broke a record as the most profitable film in the 100-year history of Universal Studios.   A prequel/spin-off film, Minions, focusing on the little yellow henchmen before they met Gru, is set to be released on July 10, 2015.  A third film, Despicable Me 3, is scheduled to be released on June 30, 2017.

My rankin of it would almost definitely change upon another viewing.   Monsters University I think is just an all around better movie. The characters are better developed, and I was more engaged with the plot.   This is one I was expecting. Incredible a is great, but I feel Pixar could've done better. When I saw Up, my expectations were below zero. So when I saw how great they both were, Up won due to increase in expectation. Even now, I know its a weird thing to say among the Pixar community, but but like Up better than The Incredibles."

I've been excited for it since it was announced a few years back.  if i recall correctly, it was back when Newt was in development, pixar called Pete Doctor in to help get it back on track but he was like ""no, i got a better idea,"" so they cancelled Newt and started working on Inside Out.

Its really disheartening, especially as an animator that wants to work in this industry."
Pixar,2aeq36,VikingCoder,6,Fri Jul 11 15:48:31 2014 UTC,"The only polite thing I can say about it is this:  Catmull recognized that most studios hire people, finish one product, and then fire them.  And then do it all over again when they get the budget for the next film.  Recognizing this, they tried at Pixar to make a studio where people could have steady jobs, etc.  But that should have been explained to the employees.  Like, ""We'd like you to reject higher offers from other studios, because we think you'll get fired there, later.  It's your choice.""

Pixar,27p5ml,theanswar,2,Mon Jun 9 14:51:08 2014 UTC,For me it was time and pacing. The movie is something like 90 minutes long (that's short) and yet there seemed to be so much filler time...
Pixar,27p5ml,williampace,2,Mon Jun 9 15:10:23 2014 UTC,"1.On the technical end of it, the original director Brenda Chapman had to step down for whatever reason leaving Mark Andrews with different story ideas. Since about half the movie was set in stone at that point, the changes in the story weren't as flowing and didn't work as well. 2.The scene where Queen Elinor as a bear stays still to avoid being seen at the castle. It's a silly joke that doesn't follow the story and really doesn't follow Pixar's way of telling a joke. It's childish and didn't really work. 3. Lack of supporting characters. The plot called for most of the movie to follow Merida and Elinor and didn't really develop the supporting characters past initial character types that they came off as. Although Merida was a well written and acted character, she wasn't interesting enough to carry the movie herself. --That being said it was a good movie, but a good Pixar movie is like going to a restaurant with three Michelin stars and saying it was ""good."""

Pixar,268w7o,Epikmunch,1 point,Sun May 25 05:33:23 2014 UTC,"Sorry, should have explained. I watched an advanced screening of it. It was cool, because John Lasseter, the director of Planes 2, and writers were in the audience jotting notes down. Then after, we had to do a Q&A, to which they recorded all of our concerns about the movie.  Lasseter seemed SUPER serious, nothing like what you see behind the camera. It was very weird.  As far as Planes 2, and I can't give away much info, the plot has NOTHING to do with a race. There's some darker tones to the movie, because it's based around teams that control forest fires. The head of the team doesn't like Dusty for about 90% of the movie, even risks his life to save him, and ends up getting burned from the fire. There's a lot of tropes(rookie wants to do a job, messes up, saves the day at the end), but there are some solid jokes(including a Howard the Duck joke, which was an extremely obscure joke), and over all, a fresh take in the ""Cars/Planes"" universe."

""During a time when many of Seattle's older neighborhoods were being replaced by new steel buildings, industrial concrete structures, and big-name chain stores, Macefield's actions stood out as a symbol of resistance. She even became known as a sort of folk hero, the face of old Seattle during this period of rapid change in the city. According to some of her friends, however, the truth was that the elderly woman just didn't want to leave her home at her age. Macefield, who had an exciting past of working as an undercover agent during WWII and caring for war orphans in England, wanted to spend the rest of her days in peace and quiet in her home.  ""In 2008, Macefield passed away at the age of 86. Her house was left to Barry Martin, the supervisor of the surrounding construction project who had become an unlikely friend and caretaker to the stubborn homeowner. Martin sold the house to a real estate coaching firm for $310,000. The firm currently has plans to elevate the house and build a public square underneath it as a tribute to Macefield's legacy.""

So the second one is going to have references and callbacks even jokes that might directly relate to the film that was made first. Sure monster's university takes place first chronologically but monster's inc is really the best way to be introduced to the characters and the monster world in general.

Pixar,22dcxr,briquet42,2,Sun Apr 6 20:52:46 2014 UTC,This seems as though it will be a worthwhile read.  I'll enjoy reading about Disney Animation Studios AND Pixar - a rare glimpse inside both empires.
Pixar,22beq7,softcore_robot,11,Sun Apr 6 02:23:22 2014 UTC,"I think he would have done well, but not well enough. A person can have all the technical knowledge but if not paired with enough natural talent, there will always be a limit to their success in that talent. He was incredibly clever, and a hard worker, but not a scarer.   I am more surprised that Hardscrabble et al went right to ""you should leave the program""  instead of telling him to join the scarer assistant/manager program because MI clearly has need for them and Mike is obviously perfect for the job. But outside the scare program, can design, and door creation we didn't see details of any other major."
Pixar,22beq7,ubergeek0,6,Sun Apr 6 03:01:37 2014 UTC,"Had Mike and Sulley not been on her bad side when she made the call on whether to keep them in the scaring track or not, Hardscrabble might have been more inclined to suggest Mike try a major where his knowledge would be put to good use. As is, she sees Mike as a troublemaker who needs a dose of reality. He's the kid who's never been told that he has no chance at being a scarer because he wants it so badly and tries so hard. And Hardscrabble, as a former scarer herself, seems to share the bias seen over much of the campus: that scarers are the elite and nothing else really matters.  But I completely agree that Mike would have pulled off a personal best, but not a 6.0. I think it would be a very different movie if I left feeling that Mike was capable of pulling off a top level scare. The movie is about Mike figuring out a different path to his dream after realizing that he is not physically cut out to be a scarer, no matter how hard he tries. And that's a story with any number of real world parallels, probably more than the story we usually see about a character overcoming all odds to succeed at a dream. A kid can know basketball inside and out: every rule, every play, every strategy. But if he's naturally short and slow, he's unlikely to become an NBA pro."
Pixar,22beq7,inkandpixelclub,1 point,Sun Apr 6 18:12:41 2014 UTC,"I am more surprised that Hardscrabble et al went right to ""you should leave the program""  instead of telling him to join the scarer assistant/manager program   This is where the story felt a little thin. What functions M.U. served could have been defined a bit more. If the scare program was exclusive to a special minority, what are the other students doing. What is the function of giant monster or underwater monster?   Without the larger context you don't get a sense of the odds Mike was up against. There is obviously information to be learned but Hardscrabble basically says looking scary is a prerequisite.  I was half expecting the Revenge of the Nerds plot where OK proves to everyone that different is good, but instead everything is setup for Mike and Sully's relationship. This is total knit picking, but the third act ending dilutes any message of overcoming adversity or following your dreams. Honestly, I'm not sure what M.U.'s take-away is other than 'college is not for everyone'."
Pixar,22beq7,BeefPieSoup,1 point,Sun Apr 6 09:33:22 2014 UTC,"There was a hint of a wider world. Scaring is treated as a specialist occupation in the energy industry which is seen as an elite status group, but there were surrounding supporting roles in that industry and probably outside of it. For example, can design and door design were taught at the university, and we know that there was an astronomy club, for example, and chemists and biologists. We see monsters who are teachers, and librarians, and mailroom workers, and toxic waste handlers. I think it was implied that there was a whole range of occupations but the focus of the movie and both Mike and Sully's interest area was definitely scaring.   this is total knit picking, but the third act ending dilutes any message of overcoming adversity or following your dreams. Honestly, I'm not sure what M.U.'s take-away is other than 'college is not for everyone'.   It did that very much on purpose. Every kids film ever has always been about, ""you can do absolutely whatever you want and I guess if you didn't get there it's because you suck and you didn't believe in yourself hard enough, because life always works out perfectly when you truly believe"". MU subverted that completely; the message instead was ""sometimes, no matter how hard you try and how much you want it, you're just gonna suck at something or it's just not going to work out quite the way you wanted it to. And that's okay, it's not your fault, you just need to figure out some other way to live your dream using the skills you do have, or set a new goal for yourself"". Maybe that's not a super happy message, but it's a necessary message and I so wish a film like this had happened when I was growing up. Because it is something that all people will learn eventually, whether they like it or not, and it's nicer to learn it like this than it is to learn it the hard way. College isn't for everyone. Some dreams will just not work out. AND THAT'S FINE. Why are we so reluctant to give kids this important and reassuring advice?"
Pixar,22beq7,goldenstate5,5,Mon May 5 09:57:24 2014 UTC,"Dan Scanlon confirms in the commentary that they cheated as much as possible visually to make it look like Mike could've done a genuinely huge scare in the contest (and make it look like it seems from his POV), but that you could deduce upon rewatch that it probably was just a mediocre scare.  It doesn't matter that he was handed a tough door (that was mainly done to raise the stakes of the finale, giving us something yet again that we didn't see in the original)... the girls weren't scared of Mike. They're little girls, and Mike can't even scare them. The point is nailed down pretty precisely."
Pixar,22beq7,onedrummer2401,1 point,Sun Apr 6 09:04:34 2014 UTC,"Commentary! I totally forgot that was a thing, I gotta chk it out.  What's interesting is had the movie ended before the tampering scene, would that be a satisfying ending? To me, Mike's scare looked good but didn't feel earned, mainly because you don't have anything to compare it to, it was his first onscreen run. Granted, It wasn't their intention to prove Mike was scary and create two endings. Elaborating on techniques and examples would have gone a long way to show what Mike and OK were up against.  I've officially overthought this."

This theory could actually be an ulterior storyline that the writers had in mind, but left up to the viewer's imagination. Side note- does anyone else think Ratatouille is very under-appreciated? I know it made plenty of money and is rated very well with critics, but people hardly ever talk about it- especially when talking about their favorite Pixar films. It's in my top 3.  That last scene with the critic's monologue gives me goosebumps and makes me cry every time I see it.

Pixar,212qlu,PEEnKEELE,3,Sat Mar 22 19:15:53 2014 UTC,"There are a few things to take into account here. How do you explain: Remy's family and backstory? There is too much overlap. Also, I am sure you are aware of gusteau's ghost/remys conscience in several parts of the movie. Just that part for me makes it more plausible the way pixar presented it, they are seperate characters. Think about the relative age of the two. This means your theory includes some kind of spiritual reincarnation, which to me is a bit far-fetched. I'd be interested to hear some rebuttle cause I fucking love ratatouille and any discussion about it makes me a happy camper.   another note about the internet famous pixar theory, although it is apparent that there are a lot of Easter eggs in most movies from the other ones, why can't that just be what it is, an Easter egg. I think that its a nice tough for example to see dug in ratatouille or to have to look for the pizza planet truck, and other pixar fans probably appreciate those little things too. But again I think that is extrapolating too much and it takes away from the individual genius of wonders like ratatouille. I could be wrong, though. I have a feeling if any long term connected complicated intertwining story was going on, the merge with Disney probably slowed down or eradicated any thoughts of that. a lot of the original creative team have left :/  Anyway thanks for propagating some ratatouille discussion! I get so excited to reply to these posts. Wish we had a ratatouille sub :P"

Pixar,20tbph,FirePhantom,15,Wed Mar 19 14:47:34 2014 UTC,So I think that viewers have come to expect so much from Pixar that it's created lower reviews and ratings. Their first 10-15 was so damned good that now we expect something incredible every movie. In reality the lower rated movies are still really good. I admit that I even gave these lower ratings on the first viewing because I wasn't awe struck like I was the first time I saw Toy Story or Finding Nemo. Our expectations are set very high for Pixar and we as viewers hold them accountable for that whether we admit it or not.    Edit: Smartphone grammar mistakes. Aka reading is hard. Stay safe out there folks.
Pixar,20tbph,uncleBING0,4,Wed Mar 19 15:10:55 2014 UTC,"I fully admit it.   But Pixar did it to themselves.

Pixar,20tbph,SuperVoodoo,6,Wed Mar 19 16:22:24 2014 UTC,My joy at the announcement of a sequel to The Incredibles was mixed with horror that they're making yet another in their Cash Cow Car franchise.

Pixar,20tbph,1upthebumnoharmdone,5,Thu Mar 20 03:21:05 2014 UTC,"How the hell is Brave rated around the same as Monster's U? Don't get me wrong, MU was ok, but Brave was a mile better.   EDIT: explaining my opinion   Brave felt like Pixar trying to do Disney and Wreck-it Ralph felt like Disney trying to do Pixar.   I find the twist refreshing, personally. I thought they were both really solid movies, oftentimes due to the mixing of the two styles.   In Brave, that meant we had stuff like:   modernised gender roles  fleshed out in-movie lore  the 'Pixar' storytelling method   Mixed in with:    That 'Disney Princess' classic animation style (side note: I thought the transition from traditional cell animation to CGI was really well done)  strong focus on/development of condensed groups of characters leaning toward Disney's highly stylised aesthetics    It's a strong feature of truly talented creative types, that they are more receptive to changing their work and style - and I personally think that's something that's clearly showcased with these two films.   I feel the complete opposite. MU had me hysterically laughing, to me Brave felt like a very bland recycled movie from the Disney vault.   Fair enough, I'll try to explain my points of contention, such as they are.    The secondary characters were disappointing: In MI, we had Roz, Waternoose, Celia, The Abominable Snowman, Fungus, Smitty, Needleman, Phlegme - you get the idea. MU's support characters simply don't hold a candle to that stellar line up  As with many prequels, it struggled to add to the audience's understanding of the characters - while it was nice to better see how Mike fits within the partnership and Sully's evolution into the down-to-earth, kindly soul we all love, it didn't have anywhere near the same scope of the original, with the nuanced exploration of different relationship dynamics present  MI was a goddamn emotional rollercoaster. MU much less so.   The villians simply weren't as scary (this one probably doesn't need any explanation for folk who have seen the film).    Like I said, I didn't hate MU. It just didn't hit me very hard."

It happened at Disney Animation twice when the Nine Old Men retired and after the Disney Renaissance. John Lasseter and Ed Catmull are still in charge so I think the leadership is still strong. Even though they are struggling, they are still making average Pixar films, which outside of Pixar are still great films overall."

Pixar,20tbph,gwendolynnn,1 point,Tue May 20 08:31:03 2014 UTC,"The brain trust effectively doesn't exist anymore.  Of the original 4:  Joe Ranft is dead, and I truly believe his death marked the beginning of the decline of Pixar.  I think he was the only person who could have both stood up to and stood in for post-Disney John Lasseter - more on that in a minute.  When John Lasseter took over Disney Feature Animation, the driving creative force at Pixar suddenly disappeared.  Every major story decision still had to be run past him, and he was relied-upon to fix major story issues, but he simply didn't have the time or the focus to do it anymore - you may notice that the quality of Disney Animated films took a major uptick not long after the Pixar merger, beginning with Bolt, and including, in particular, Tangled, Wreck-it Ralph, and Frozen, while Pixar's string of critical successes faltered - especially Ratatouille (more on that in a minute), Cars 2, Brave, and Monsters University.  Among other things, Pixar for years claimed that it would never make a sequel unless the story demanded it.  Toy Story was a trilogy; it needed to be made, and each successive film was at least as good as the one that came before it.  Monsters Inc didn't need a sequel, and the sequel didn't measure up.  Cars sure as hell didn't need a sequel; Cars 2 was made for purely financial reasons; the Cars franchise is the second biggest licensed merchandizing film franchise ever, behind only Star Wars.  Cars 2 was not a story that needed to be told.    Ratatouille:  Jan Pinkava was thrown under the bus.  His story wasn't coming together as well as it needed to, but rather than putting in the time and the effort to fix it, JL stayed head-down at Disney (to be fair, Disney needed him), and Jan was left swinging in the breeze.  Brad Bird was bribed with a live-action film (which sadly got canned by.. Warner?) to come in and save it.  Brenda Chapman suffered the same damned fate as Jan over Brave.  They wouldn't help it along; they let the director go down with the ship, then brought in someone else to fix and finish it.  Hell, even Bob Peterson got shafted on The Good Dinosaur, and he's personally bearing the self-imposed brunt of the guilt over the recent mass layoffs at Pixar Emeryville, and the closing of Pixar Canada because of that.  This is the first year in a decade that Pixar hasn't put out a feature.  And poor Newt.  Pixar's first outright cancellation.  Again, the help that was needed simply wasn't available from the powers that be.  Ironically(?), the current Brain Trust includes both Gary Rydstrom (Newt) and Bob Peterson, as well Brad Lewis who is primarily a producer.  I don't know what the hell they're trying to do over there anymore, but it sure as hell isn't ""tell stories that need to be told"".  Pixar is struggling to stay alive right now.  Their primary mission for the last 6 or so years has been to keep the Disney accountants at bay.  They've lost their focus, and the last couple of years and possibly the next 2 years are completely pivotal to the survival of the studio, and I sure don't know how that's going to work out."
Pixar,20tbph,ShaquilleOHeal,1 point,Tue May 20 09:15:30 2014 UTC,"Broadly I agree with your comment, especially the impacts of John Lasseter's new position and Joe Ranft's death on Pixar, however there are a few points of contention I'd like to illuminate:  Firstly, Ratatouille was in no way a critical failure. I firmly believe that it's an excellent film and if you have a look at the Tomatometer table it clearly shows that it was well received.   Secondly, and this isn't so much something I disagree with as something I feel you have neglected, Pete Docter. The first person at Pixar to direct a film, beside JL. He carries great influence and is helming Inside Out, which I hold high hopes for. It may very well buck the trend.   Undeniably though, Pixar has suffered a distinct lull in quality. I just don't think that will necessarily continue to be the trend. Or at least I hope."
Pixar,20tbph,PhylisInTheHood,1 point,Tue May 20 10:31:01 2014 UTC,"You're right, Ratatouille is in fact one of my favourite Pixar films.  My point about it is that JL, et al, let the original director fail.  It was the first Pixar film to be made without the usual influence of the brain trust, and it started the trend.  (Technically it was the second - The Incredibles was the first.  As completely AWESOME as it was, it wasn't a Pixar film; it was written and directed by Brad who was brought in from the outside with the Incredibles already laid out shot-for-shot).  As for the future 3 of the next 5 (I can't remember if The Good Dinoaur has been cancelled outright or not) announced films are sequels: Finding Dory, Incredibles 2, and Cars 3 have all been announced.  Money first, story second.  I left Pete out because I have nothing to say about him.  He's a great guy and probably my favourite Pixar director.  He is the only member of the original braintrust who didn't wander off to do other things (bar Joe, of course).   [Pete] is helming Inside Out, which I hold high hopes for. It may very well buck the trend.   Whiiiich trend is that?  Remember my original comment?     Sad trend, unfortunately. They've given up their focus on placing the story ahead of everything else.   to which you replied:   I think that it's not quite fair to say at this stage. [etc]   I think even you agree that it really is a trend.  I don't think they will ever return to their glory days, and that's not entirely their fault.  At this point, it is more important to them that they make money to keep Disney at bay than it is that they make lasting stories.  I mean - they're still way better than Dreamworks (though Dreamworks has been stepping up its game at last), Blue Sky, etc, but it was never about being better than anyone else, it was about story.  It was always about story, until... it wasn't."

Hasn't Bird been working on a story for a potential Incredibles sequel for years? I hardly think this is an official announcement that the film is greenlit, rather a quote taken out of context.  Similarly Kevin Feige at Marvel Studios said last month: ""The notion of exploring [Black Widow's past] even further in her own film would be great, and we have some development work with that."" So of course every fansite ran the headline, ""Feige CONFIRMS Black Widow Solo Movie!""

Pixar,20qfke,leavingforgood,2,Tue Mar 18 18:55:34 2014 UTC,"i've made comments before on reddit about how i didn't think Incredibles 2 was likely.   Yes, Incredibles is one of the most entertaining films to come out of Pixar, and it certainly seems as if it would get a sequel. Its got a great universe, characters, actors etc etc. The genius behind the whole thing, Brad Bird has spoken to making a sequel. He says hes got ideas just not a whole story. Pixar will not make a sequel unless its got a story. Right now, Brad Bird's hands are tied with Tomorrowland. its got a 2015 release date. Incredibles came out in 2003. So even now, its a little delayed for a sequel. We'd need a 2016-18 release date on an Incredibles 2 for it to make any sense, and 14 years is pushing the envelope. As I said, Bird is busy with Tomorrowland, and a Pixar movie normally takes 4 years to make. So unless he's working on it side-by-side with Tomorrowland (and i doubt he is, he's trying to get into the Live-Action stuff after the success of MI: Ghost Protocol), I dont see it happening. Of course you could argue maybe its in the hands of another director! and if someone else is working on it now it will be out at the latest 2018 making it all possible! But i strongly doubt it. Sometimes sequels are handed off to another director. But The Incredibles was written and directed by Bird. I dont think he'd hand it off to someone without telling us. Of course, I'd love to be proven wrong.   thank goodness i have been proven wrong. Turns out he is working on it side-by-side in a sense. Im guessing a late 2017 or summer 2018 release date.  im super excited for an sequel to Incredibles. Cars 3.. eh we'll see. would be cool for it to be a third installment of both Cars and Planes and it make it one big and actually good movie."

They introduced a load of characters who could have been great, but Mater took up most of the film. It even felt like the characters from the first film only got a couple of lines each. sigh"

Pixar,1yyklf,thatsmyaibo,8,Wed Feb 26 04:09:34 2014 UTC,"I feel like this is a much stronger argument that its counter-argument.   In 1, there were only 4 house models, they just changed the colors to give variety, so I can totally see them reusing hat models."
Pixar,1yyklf,Not_Steve,6,Wed Feb 26 08:44:29 2014 UTC,"Pixar reuses items in all their movies. The hat is no exception, especially because it really fits with Jessie's character. For all we know that hat was at some point just a popular kids accessory. Pixar does an amazing job with story telling and setting up great characters but this is just reaching for something that just isn't there."
Pixar,1yyklf,uncleBING0,2,Wed Feb 26 20:51:54 2014 UTC,"The first comment on the article hits the nail on the head-- the Art of Toy Story book is evidence enough, but the other points are incredibly weak.  So what if Toy Story 2 wasn't intended when Andy's hat was first animated? You don't think the writers could have * gasp * come up with the link AFTER Toy Story 1? Crazy.  Jessie might not recognize Andy's mom as Emily because she just looks older. Besides, the author assumes Jessie knows Andy's mom's first name-- why? I feel like the toys would relate more closely to Andy's point of view and know her simply as ""Mom,"" or ""Andy's mom,"" in fact I think they refer to her as the latter in at least one movie (Ham perhaps?).  The final point about it all cheapening Jessie's abandonment issues relies on the fact that Jessie recognizes Andy's mom as Emily, which I don't think happens. I think she could still be Emily and it doesn't have to mean a personal catharsis for Jessie.  That's what Easter eggs are-- things for fans to find that make them go WHOA. And this sort of link is exactly the fun kind of thing I like to find. It doesn't always have to be true or not, who cares.  Relevant subreddit: /r/Headcanon"
Pixar,1yyklf,xostormystormsox,3,Wed Feb 26 19:10:40 2014 UTC,"I love finding Easter Eggs, but to build a story that was not intended by the artists that created it actually takes away from the story.   Lost seemed like it was built for these kind of fan theories. Pixar always gives us goodies people find years after a film's release but never something that changes the whole mythos of their intentions."
Pixar,1yyklf,xostormystormsox,2,Wed Feb 26 19:25:44 2014 UTC,"I feel that, but I honestly don't think the point that the Emily-Mom link cheapens Jessie's fear of abandonment makes sense at all. That theme in the movies (2, 3, and TSoT, anyway), is one of my favorites. In fact, what it adds for me is a character trait in Andy's mom that meshes even more with how the films play out. In 2, she picks out some toys to get rid of (yard sale) while Andy is away (at cowboy camp). I don't remember exactly her attitude in 3, but the film's conflict lies in the fact that it's time to go to college, get rid of your toys, Andy. Andy's mom and Andy contrast in that they share a different connection with their (specifically cowboy/cowgirl) toys-- she grows out of them in her teenage years, it takes Andy much longer (possibly due to the proposed link of Woody and his father?)"
Pixar,1yyklf,kenba2099,2,Wed Feb 26 19:34:50 2014 UTC,You would think she would recognize Jessie while putting her up for adoption... Why wouldn't she keep Jessie and woody for family toys sake either.

Pixar,1yt996,iAaronK,23,Mon Feb 24 18:07:13 2014 UTC,"I'm going to repeat roughly what I said about this on r/disney. The first time I saw Toy Story 2, I was afraid that Andy's mom was going to turn out to be Emily, and I was relieved when they didn't go that route. So many movies would be unable to resist putting a neat bow on everything and having some forced scene where Andy's mom picks up Jessie and reminisces fondly about how she had a Jessie doll when she was little, but she donated it when she left for college. But that's not what the movie is about. Toy Story 2 hinges on the idea that kids grown up and outgrow their toys and get rid of them! an idea that is continued into Toy Story 3. If the audience doubts for a second that this is how the world of the movie works, if they start to believe that toys will eventually find their way back to their old owners who remember them fondly or even regret abandoning them, it all falls apart. Woody's choice doesn't mean anything if we think he doesn't really believe that Andy will someday outgrow him and discard him. Jessie lost Emily for good. She can move on with a new kid, but she can't go back to reconcile with the old one.  I do think it's entirely possible that Andy's mom was a Woody's Roundup fan and the hat could have been hers as a kid. There were probably any number of hats made just like the one Emily had. But the evidence that she is Emily is purely circumstantial."
Pixar,1yt996,inkandpixelclub,6,Mon Feb 24 18:44:48 2014 UTC,"You make a good point. The first time I read the article I was a little skeptical and thought he might be reading into things too much. I definitely agree though that it's inconsistent with idea of ""letting go."" I will say though that assuming the writer is correct and Andy's mom is Emily, then I think it's all the more impressive on Pixar's part that they don't force it, that they keep it subtle (again, assuming the theory is true). Mostly though the article just interested me whether or not I believe it."
Pixar,1yt996,CoffeeJedi,3,Mon Feb 24 20:19:21 2014 UTC,"I think both you and the post are right in your own way. Andy's mom doesn't literally have to be Jessie's former kid, but thematically she was equivalent and it still works on a storytelling level."
Pixar,1yt996,toomuchmonkey,2,Tue Feb 25 00:18:39 2014 UTC,I now wonder if that was what happened in an earlier draft. I know that John Lasseter re-wrote pretty much all of Toy Story 2 in a weekend because the plot wasn't working. Maybe they were still stuck with old animation and that's why Emily looks similar to Andy's mom.
Pixar,1yt996,softcore_robot,3,Mon Feb 24 22:12:44 2014 UTC,"These Pixar theories are getting out of hand.  A consistent element in Pixar storytelling is  that humans are generally irrelevant compared to everything else. The toys, fish, ants, cars, rats, monsters and robots are dimensional characters, while the humans are props. There are exceptions (like Brave) but Pixar generally avoids human drama in favor of anthropomorphism. Even in Brave...bears!  Interestingly, the Incredibles and Up! feature humans as main characters, but isolate them  in remote locations, away from human contact. I believe reducing humans to props is intentional, because it helps remove audience bias from the storytelling to increase empathy.  Humans generally are present just to move the story forward, mostly creating chaos for the main characters. Some more than others.  So is Andy's mom really Emily? No, because Pixar doesn't care enough to define that detail, it's irrelevant to the story.  What really needs an answer is why Bullseye doesn't talk."
Pixar,1yt996,Not_Steve,2,Tue Feb 25 07:59:03 2014 UTC,"Also consider that someone close to Andy knew Jesse's real name. At the end of 2, he calls her Jane, but in 3's play sequence (and when Andy gives her away), she's referred to as Jesse. Andy uses both the real name and the play aliases of the other toys (""this is Hamm, but he's also… Evil Dr. Pork Chop!"") Did Andy's mom correct him with Jesse and Bullseye's name?  However, if Andy's mom was really Emily, don't you think she would have urged Andy to keep his toys in 3, after feeling regret of giving up her own Jesse doll? I'd urge my kids to keep their closest toys as I feel remorse over not keeping some of mine.   My conclusion: Mom is not Emily, but does know who Jesse and Woody are. I do like the thought that Woody once belonged to Dad (and Dad ripped off the ribbon from his Jesse hat that was passed down to Andy). Maybe because Dad left/died, Mom is trying to sway Andy into a different genre (from westerns to Sci-Fi) because it hurts her."

Pixar,1xy5cb,iamriot,14,Sat Feb 15 01:29:28 2014 UTC,"Last year I flew in to play SF Sketchfest and I was going to stay with some friends in Berkeley.  The night before I flew out I looked at the Bart map to figure out how I was going to get from the airport out to Berkeley when I saw that Emeryville was smack dab in the middle of the two.  I called Pixar and they told me that they don't offer open tours.  I sighed and reluctantly accepted my fate.   After I told them about my disappointment my friends took me to a diner (owned by Mike Dirnt of Green Day) which was right across the street from the Pixar HQ.  Seeing the gate was pretty cool and you could see the ball and the lamp but the coolest thing was the giant seagulls perched around the building.  Seeing those seagulls made me change my plans and wake up early the next day because if nothing else I'd get a sweet shot of them.    I had heard about the store that was only open to employees and had shirts that weren't available for sale anywhere else.  On the Bart I formulated a plan to go to the security gate and ask the guard if he knew of any employees who might be cool enough to do me the favor of buying any shirt from the store for me.  I sprung my plan into action and the security guard very nicely told me that since it was a little after 10 am, most of the cool people had already come in and anyone coming in now would most likely be an executive who may or may not have security on autodial.  I stood by the gate peeking into the next few cars that came up and I felt like an infamous NYC street window washer waiting to pounce on someone who didn't want to be bothered.  So I quickly gave up and convinced myself that the trip was still worth it since I'd get better pictures of all the cool stuff in the daylight.    I was a little disappointed as I walked around the campus since I was expecting more cool, easter eggs around the building but the seagulls seemed to be it.  I got a little past half way around the campus when I passed two guys smoking.  After about 10 steps past them something clicked.  People don't stand and smoke outside of buildings unless they work there.  I stopped on a dime and pulled a 180.  I started the conversation by saying, ""Hey guys can I ask you a weird question?"" They said, ""sure.""  ""If I give you money will go into the company store and buy me a shirt?""  They started asking me where I was from and why I was in the Bay area.  It turned out that one of the guys had taught right by where I live and lived not too far from where I grew up and went to high school.  They very politely said that they'd do it but they'd like to finish their cigarettes.  I said absolutely, please take your time and handed them a $20 and a business card, hoping that the card would humanize me a bit more, and continued to walk the rest of the campus.    After an excruciating 10 minutes of walking and waiting I doubled back to the smoking spot feeling a little disappointed by the lack of more easter eggs.  My heart sank as I saw the two guys who looked like they hadn't budged an inch since I left.  Not wanting to feel like I was hurrying them along since they were doing me a massive favor I slowed down my pace until I made out something in one of the guy's hands.  I picked up the pace and was greeted with the sentence, ""Oh hey man, bad news, the company store doesn't open until 11.""  It was about 10:30.  ""But you can have my shirt that they gave everyone who worked on the sets for Brave, there are only 12 or 13 in the world.""  There are a handful of times at best that I've been speechless in my life.  ""Oh and here's your money too.""  I ineffectively tried to convince them to keep the $20 and to use it for lunch but they insisted.   ""it took Bravery (the capital B is an editor's choice) for you to go up to strangers and ask for something."" That day even further cemented my unbridled love of Pixar.   Here are some pictures if anyone is interested. Imgur  tl:dr They don't offer tours but swing by the campus, good things may come of it."

I had just come out the other side of an insane divorce and my ex husband was given visitation rights; he had never had my son unsupervised before. Despite the parenting classes he had gone through and the change that seemed to of come over my ex I was terrified of the first visitation. Then this line came up, ""How do you know something bad isn't going to happen?"" The question that kept circling around and around in my head. Then dory ' s answer: ""I dont"" and it was true; but I had to do it. And I found comfort in the truth of the matter; there's nothing I could do and couldn't do it was entirely up to trust.

Pixar,1veaej,inkandpixelclub,14,Tue Feb 25 01:16:36 2014 UTC,"My guess is that it's at least partly what Disney wanted. Much as we might want to believe that Oscar nominations are decided by the judges seeing all of the eligible films in and particular category and choosing three to five of the very best, there's a lot of behind the scenes industry politics involved too. Studios do lobby for nominations for their films and send out screener copies to ensure that the judges see the films they would like to be nominated in a particular category. What Disney seems to do sometimes is out all of their muscle behind the film that they think is most likely to win. There have been cases where they've had two films nominated: one from Disney Feature Animation and one from Pixar. But usually, Disney will pick one horse to back.  Speaking of horses, I'm guessing that Disney pushing their new Mickey Mouse short ""Get a Horse!' is why Pixar's ""The Blue Umbrella"" didn't even make it onto the previously announced ""long list"" of potential animated short film nominees."
Pixar,1veaej,chicken1672,9,Thu Jan 16 23:07:03 2014 UTC,"Fun business tid bit I learned a few months ago!  Steamboat Willie Mickey Mouse was created in 1928. The copyright should have expired in 2003, but Disney has been fighting tooth and nail for years and years to keep extending copyright laws, so they can continue sole ownership of Mickey Mouse, rather than letting his image go into public domain.  Have you noticed that they changed the Disney Logo at the beginning of movies to Steamboat Willie? Did you notice that they used both the original look of Mickey and his friends as well as a new 3D CG look in ""Get a Horse!""?  Yup, just trying to re copyright all of their images so we can't use it in public domain. Its not a ""Oh cool they're using the old stuff again how fun!"" its ""WE OWN THIS AND YOU CAN'T HAVE IT SO NAH!""  Getting it screened at the Oscars puts their claim to a copyright more legitimate."

They want the win for Frozen."
Pixar,1veaej,chicken1672,3,Fri Jan 17 00:43:26 2014 UTC,does Disney decide which movies they send in for nominations or something like that? is it possible Lassater or somebody else made the call to not even allow MU to qualify?
Pixar,1veaej,johncosta,7,Fri Jan 17 00:45:05 2014 UTC,"They don't pick which movies to submit, but they certainly pick which films to push for. Film companies will advertise their films in magazines and around the LA area for the academy's consideration, and my guess is that frozen was pushed harder for than MU because Frozen has a better change of winning."
Pixar,1veaej,robobreasts,3,Fri Jan 17 00:52:58 2014 UTC,"ermmm no your work has to be submitted yourself. The Academy Awards are just like any other festival.  I can believe that they are pushing Frozen harder to A. take a step away from Pixar. Their business model and practices are just mind boggling. and B. they want to be able to put on the Broadway posters ""Academy Award Winning!"". MU wasn't pre-designed to go to Broadway, whereas Frozen very obviously was."
Pixar,1veaej,hollykins,1 point,Fri Jan 17 01:48:19 2014 UTC,"I guess what I meant was that there's no way Monsters University wasn't submitted.

Pixar,1v736a,inkandpixelclub,8,Tue Jan 14 17:54:59 2014 UTC,"Muntz is not a good guy, to be sure, but I'm not sure the points you make are terribly unique among Disney and Pixar villains. There are plenty of villains who attempt murder of children - the Queen in Snow White, Frollo, Shere Khan (who's capable of communicating with Mowgli, even though they're different species), and Shan Yu and his men (remember the doll?) among others - and adults. Destruction of property probably happens to often to even count.  What I think makes Muntz interesting and particularly bad is his fanaticism. Going with the definition where a fanatic is someone who doubles his efforts while losing sight of his goal, Muntz is a perfect example. He's become so obsessed with capturing the bird that he's lost sight of everything else: his reputation (which may not have even been that badly tarnished), the purpose of exploration, and regard for life, including those he once did care about. In the beginning of the movie, we are told and shown that Muntz treats his dogs like family. So the line that always gets me is when Muntz says ""I've lost so many dogs."" He's putting the only family he has on mortal peril on a regular basis in pursuit of his obsession.  Muntz works so well as a villain in his particular film because of how his obsession parallels Carl's. Carl eventually learns to let go and value his future and relationships with others over physical reminders of the past. Muntz never does."

If you didn't go to college then you'll have a glimpse into what type of life students go through. This film is a snippet of some students life. It captured the essence of a students voyage through college quite well.   How many students go to college and find their major not fulfilling? Hundreds if not thousands change majors and this encapsulates that idea quite well.   I was on the verge of energetic tears during the film.   I am a student. This is probably why I loved it so much. It just resonated with what was happening in my life, someone understood me. Hopefully, things work out for me like it did for Mike.  As a parent I can see why people would like Monsters Inc. over Monsters University. For me they both are great movies in their own way."

Take a moment to hug your kids, or kiss your spouse, or enjoy your friends, because those things, those people, that love, is where life's greatest adventure lies. If you go looking for your adventure somewhere else, you'll miss the fact that it was always right there in front if you in every minute of what you thought was a boring life.  It is, as far as I'm concerned the most beautiful message of any of the Pixar films."

I think anyone who ideally sits on a couch watching Lost and content with a 9-5 they care nothing about won't look back on their life and think that was the great adventure.  But those who strive for greatness and to find adventure will probably look back on their journey and point to that as the ""real"" adventure."

Slapstick humor with the little brothers and daughter/mother bonding montage were certainly endearing, but not special. It was also very heavily focused on Merida and her Mother with other characters functioning almost exclusively as comic relief and/or plot device. The witch, for example, was quirky, but couldn't even hope to compare Edna.  I still don't think Pixar is going downhill. Up and Toy Story 3 were absolutely top notch, with Monsters U barely behind. Still, I'm glad they're taking their time. If they take an extra year, I'm sure the content will be that much better."

Pixar,1pznfd,zdennis24,8,Wed Nov 6 00:30:08 2013 UTC,"Animator here.  Interesting thoughts, but I take issue with a few things.  I'm going to be pretty tough on a few points, so don't think I'm trying to be rude or insensitive... I just know what I'm talking about.  Technically, animation's golden age spanned the late 1920s to the late 1960s in America.  There were a lot of highly successful and artistically progressive studios active during this period, including Disney, Warner Bros, MGM, UPA, Fleischer Studios, Universal, Hannah Barbera and many others.  THIS was truly the Golden age that dwarfs the period the article describes as being 1988-2010.  ""The Lion King introduced emotion into the landscape of animation that was later refined by…""   I'm sorry but even if we're only talking Disney, films like Pinocchio and Dumbo and Bambi were not at all lacking in that department, and that was before the 40s really even got started.  Bambi dealt with some serious shit, and I'm certain there were not many dry eyes in theaters.  Spielberg's ""An American Tale"" was about Jews fleeing the anti-Semitic Cossack pogroms in 1880s Russia and having a shit time in America where no one cares about you.  Now THAT'S emotion.  Every element of that film reinforces the emotional context of the hardships immigrants faced in leaving their homes overseas and trying to make a go of it in America.  As a kid, I was BARELY aware of all the social and historical allusions being made in that film, but it didn't fail to hit its emotional center.    ""You still were getting that cinematic experience that directors had established in live actions years before but now they were moving them to a different medium and executing them just as well. Directors like Brad Bird, Hayao Miyazaki, John Lasseter, and Andrew Stanton were pushing the envelope and making animation something not just for kids but a medium that adults could watch and get an experience that differed from their kids.""  This is also somewhat inaccurate.  While it is true that those directors endeavored to further the medium, people like Ub Iwerks in the late 20s were pioneering cinematic techniques that allowed for animation to mimic the film language of live action cinema.  Furthermore, much of the animation in the Golden Age actually was for adults.  While this article makes some great observations about princess characters and the like, the author seems to have ignored the actual hayday and golden age of animation in America, before television rose and provided competition to animation that was almost exclusively theatrically released.  The author, in considering this golden age to be 1989-2010, has chosen a period in which 90% of the animated movies produced are 3D animated features.  If anything, this period is a resurgence of interest in animation after the medium was already sliding off the public's radar and most people just thought it was only good for Saturday morning cartoons, selling action figures, and nobody was interested in feature length animated films.  Perhaps the author merely misused the term ""Golden Age"", and really just wanted to highlight a very solid specific period in American animation.  if this is the case, its a far more excusable mistake to make.  It certainly was a great era for animation, but it couldn't stop the slow death.  As an animator, I've had a lot of illusions stripped from me.  This magical world of artists getting together and making their ideas into beautiful films has been replaced by the reality that Walt Disney was a bastard, animators have always been treated like shit, and Brad Bird passed off other people's ideas as his own as he rose to fame.  Even Lasseter and friends have taken credit for the contributions of people like Joss Whedon, who literally saved Toy Story from going down the drain and failing to even be completed.  Even today, my friends at places like Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks and Blue Sky paint a very different picture of what it's like to work in a studio environment.  It is no wonder that there just aren't as many great animated movies in the past five years as there once were.  But take heart in the fact that the medium can never die.  There is a sea change coming in the film and animation industry, and this ""too big to fail"" medium could come crashing down as budgets skyrocket and returns drop.  This will open a way for the next movers and shakers, and I think we will see this happen in the next ten to twenty years.  There's a lot of great minds out there making independent work, and when Hollywood leaves an opening for them, we will see some serious giants step forward.  Good article, even if a little inaccurate and limited in scope."
Pixar,1pznfd,Camiam321,-3,Wed Nov 6 01:41:36 2013 UTC,"I am the author and I appreciate the points you made. I can agree with you on maybe making it a ""renaissance"" rather than ""golden age."" I'll go by each point and try and explain my reasoning.  I put that The Lion King introduced an emotional quality because matching emotion with the great strides that animation made to make it utterly beautiful to watch was what I meant. I agree that Dumbo, Bambi, and others carried an emotional weight but they don't match the quality that was displayed in some of the movies I mentioned, in my opinion. Don't take that as me thinking that they're bad but I'm looking at the innovations in animations that maybe put Lion King above those classics.  About the directors, I understand that there were people prior to these more modern names that made just as large an impact. The reason I appreciate the work that these men did goes back to the whole renaissance idea. They brought so much out of animated movies that was lacking in the years prior. Even in sequels, they were going above and beyond what the rest of Disney was cranking out in the form of direct-to-DVD sequels. While I guess these men were innovators or directors that paved the way, they still are immensely important for crafting the movies they did.  I will admit, I know more about the era I wrote about more than the ""actual Golden Age"" in that case I would love to learn and see more about that period so I could gain a better understanding for my next piece.  I wasn't trying to devalue anything prior to 1988 or make the period I wrote about anything better. I was just analyzing this period for what it was, a great period of animation, and wanting to instigate discussion on what people think of the current state, which in my opinion, is struggling. I have loved some animated films but as a whole I have seen a steep drop-off in quality due to more sequels and money grabbers. Now I will say though that animated shorts, both by professionals and amateurs, have taken large strides and have overtaken features as being incredibly original and amazing.  Thanks for the critical points though. It helps!"
Pixar,1pznfd,Camiam321,0,Wed Nov 6 04:12:18 2013 UTC,"Good points. Good article. I am always glad for people being critical of animation. As much as I love the medium, and as many fine things still being produce by talented artists and storytellers... The industry has homogenized itself, and that is not a conducive environment for progress.  I think that's why places like Pixar can't make risky moves, struggle with their formula, still make the board of selectmen happy."
Pixar,1pznfd,dhusk,5,Wed Nov 6 05:17:34 2013 UTC,"As an animator, it really annoys me when people associate the entirety of animation with either Pixar or Disney. It annoys me more when way too many people copy their style.   Animation is on a recent upwards turn, with more and more animation skills being requested every day in games, movies, tv, education, science, medicine and many other fields.  It seems really stupid to say animation as an industry is going down because Pixar made a few bad movies."
Pixar,1pznfd,13Zero,3,Mon Nov 11 15:46:05 2013 UTC,"The Golden Age of Animation was 1933-1959, the era of classic Disney, Warner Bros, Max Fleischer, and other pioneers.  I thought this was generally accepted by most Animation scholars/enthusiasts.  The animation Dark Age (at least for North America) was from 1959-1989.  A huge unending wave of crappily written and animated drek fostered on the public, pioneered by former greats Hanna and Barbera and imitators such as Ruby Spears.  The few bright spots (Rocky & Bullwinkle, The Jungle Book, Gummi Bears, and others) weren't enough to pull the medium out of its self-induced mediocrity.  Most animation experts I've read also agree on this terminology or something similar.  The 'era' that followed (1989-present) is a little more murkily defined.  There's the Disney Renaissance, the more general American Animation Renaissance, the Silver Age, the Modern Age, and (post-1995) the Digital Age.  There probably won't be a formal name for it until afters its fully over.  But 'Golden Age' has already been long since taken."

No matter how huge a fan, the amount layers and rendering it would take, solely based on the artists speculation would not be possible. Plus the four characters shown clearly display a caliber of design that could only be Pixar. I promise. If anything I bet it's a leak of a potential poster design.

Although the Brave story wasn't that great I thought the characters were decent and the animation was beautiful, which I think was the main aim.

Pixar,1o1d68,hwentworth,-1,Thu Oct 10 19:31:51 2013 UTC,The reason I'm shooting for Dreamworks.
Pixar,1o1d68,hwentworth,-1,Thu Oct 24 21:37:35 2013 UTC,"I disagree with most of this. I don't think they're in more trouble than any other studio - in fact they're probably better off than most - and I don't think they're mishandling anything.  Every film - animated or live action - has story issues. Take a look, you'll see that many films have 4 or even 5 screenwriters. (And those are the only ones that get credited!) For instance, Toy Story had 4 ""story by"" credits AND 4 ""screenplay by"" credits.  Director replacement is something that Pixar does. (Ratatouille, Cars 2 - partially) They have far more access to the production than we do. In all cases I trust the Senior team's decision making because that's all I can do. I'm not sure why they decided to replace Pinkava on Ratatouille. Same for Chapman and Peterson. Nobody except those actually involved REALLY know.  Idle workers are a shame, but Pixar has made it clear that the story is paramount. If they wanted to push films out, they'd do it. They're demonstrating, and have demonstrated in the past, that they're willing to wait to make sure they release something of which they'd be proud.  New hires don't always work out.  Closing Pixar Canada is sad news, that's for sure. No other way to say that. I was never really convinced of the need of a second studio, especially with WDAS and DisneyToon Studios up and running. Always seemed forced. What I am surprised at, however, is why the 100 - or at least some of the 100 - weren't offered positions in Emeryville or at WDAS. Unfortunately, the animation industry has always been plagued with situations like this. Even Walt himself.  All businesses shed talent. The key is tracking down and refining new talent. Always fun to track the directors of Pixar shorts as they move along (Mark Andrews, Teddy Newton, Peter Sohn, etc, etc.)  But hey, just as yours was your own opinion, all of this is my opinion. That's just how I see things. I think Pixar will be making entertaining films for a long time."
Pixar,1o1d68,hwentworth,0,Wed Oct 9 18:45:31 2013 UTC,"Businesses make purely financial decisions all the time. The only way the entertainment industry is different is that large groups of people often lose their jobs due to a production ceasing or delaying. This has been happening in the animation and film industry for years. Not that it's expected, but it's certainly not unprecedented.  The rest is just a waste of our time. I see what you're saying and I generally disagree. Needless to say, you disagree with me. And maybe you're right, since you were there."

They are willing to push back their movies to ensure that they are putting out the highest quality films possible.  Rather than just pushing them out the door to profit."
Pixar,1mnrvm,johnsorci,2,Wed Sep 18 19:51:54 2013 UTC,An 18 month delay is pretty crazy when you think that a lot of movies basically go from concept to release in that time frame.
Pixar,1mnrvm,Dorkside,2,Thu Sep 19 07:21:22 2013 UTC,I've heard in a number of interviews from Pixar directors that they work on their movies for over 3 years (from concept to completion).  I believe the average is 4.  Although most studios work in an 18 month time frame.
Pixar,1mnrvm,johnsorci,1 point,Thu Sep 19 13:25:27 2013 UTC,"It's what used to make them great, now they make predictable subpar sequels."
Pixar,1mnrvm,donniedisney,1 point,Thu Sep 19 12:52:46 2013 UTC,"I would have to disagree with you. Though there is a thin line between a good sequel and horrific one, I don't think Pixar has crossed that line, and who knows if they ever will. Toy Story 2, in my opinion, seems like it came a bit too soon, however, they were probably needing fast funds as it was in the beginning stages and TS2 introduced quite a few important characters that really set TS3 up for a larger success. As for Cars and Cars 2, I have never seen them. I don't really have any desire to see them, though I may at some point. I have heard that Cars 2 was pretty bad. And finally, Monster's University was an outstanding prequel in my opinion. MU could stand as it's own movie, but MI and MU really do strengthen each other. I'm excited to see where they take the Finding Nemo idea with the new Finding Dory. Nemo was a great concept and the art was stunning. I do think that it has the potential to tip either way, but that's why we leave it up to them and they make it great. :)"
Pixar,1mnrvm,Capnaspen,0,Thu Sep 19 13:16:35 2013 UTC,Cars 2 is terrible. Monsters inc. and Nemo don't need them. They are becoming a sequel factory.  They fired Brenda Chapman from the movie she created and are doing the same now with Bob Peterson. Disney is playing too large if a role in their creative process. They rely almost entirely on Pixar now because their own animated films are forgettable.
Pixar,1mnrvm,donniedisney,6,Thu Sep 19 15:00:59 2013 UTC,"I guess it makes sense and I would definitely prefer a well done movie to a rushed one, but it makes me kind of sad that next year will be the first time since 2005 that no Pixar movie has come out.  Although I survived 2011 when I didn't go see Cars 2 so it will probably be fine"

I had a hunch one of them would be delayed or even cancelled. yes 18 months seems like an insane amount of time. but this movie has felt so far away, with no trailer yet. but as Ed Catmull said, people don't remember when you delay a movie but they do remember a bad one.  So this is all for the best, but i am bummed. my greedy self wants a pixar movie next year, hope this is worth the wait.

A Bug's Life  Monsters University  The Incredibles  Cars  Ratatouille  Cars 2 (Still a great film though!)
Pixar,1mk9w9,pottyaboutpotter1,4,Tue Sep 17 21:17:24 2013 UTC,"I like Brave. Everyone is down on the recent films because expectations are so high. At least Brave isn't a sequel.

The great thing about Pixar films is that they appeal to both kids and adults. That's where I think Brave fell down; it was a good kids film, but not that enjoyable for adults like most of their other films. It just missed that humour and charm that makes Pixar so good."

I've realized I'm kind of a weirdo in Pixar fandom in that I really, really love Finding Nemo.  I still think it's the most visually stunning film they've made, and the story is so well developed.  So it would be higher.  Monsters U. would be lower, below all the TS's.  Cars 2 would be last, Brave would be next-to-last.  I was really underwhelmed by both of those.  Up would be much higher on my list.  Another beautiful film will incredibly well developed characters."

I think the bottom three of Cars 2, Cars and Brave is pretty nailed on for most Pixar fans though.  Monsters University just made me laugh, probably more than most other Pixar films.

Pixar,1li2do,getonmydick,4,Sun Sep 1 04:25:47 2013 UTC,"This is becoming a bit disconcerting. Pixar has become the standard bearer for artistic integrity, yet this is the fourth film on which Pixar has removed a director, four films out of what will be a total fifteen when The Good Dinosaur comes out. Though filmmaking, particularly animated filmmaking, is a very collaborative process, many of the best Pixar films seem to have been born from the personal experiences of the people who directed them, making it extra upsetting to see a film get taken away from its original director.  All that said, we as the audience will have a very hard time determining whether taking Bob Peterson off of The Good Dinosaur was the right move. If we like the finished film, we'll probably assume that it was and if we don't, we'll probably assume that it wasn't. But we have no real way of knowing whether the film that Bob Peterson would have made would have been any better or worse than the one we'll end up with. Even if we get some details about what Bob Peterson might have done differently, it's difficult to impossible to know what would have happened to these ideas in the filmmaking process.  Despite my worries, I have to admit that sometimes the movies that come from a change in directors have been good. (Ratatouille being the best example I can think of.) Sometimes people do get too close to a project that they're working on and really do require someone who hasn't been working on t for months and months to step in and say ""This isn't working; here's what we need to change."" But if this keeps happening, if Pixar keeps throwing directors off of their films and replacing them, it's going to start raising questions about how Pixar makes movies, particularly if one of these films isn't a box office hit."
Pixar,1li2do,inkandpixelclub,2,Tue Sep 3 00:25:46 2013 UTC,Does anyone know who it is gonna be? Perterson was one of my favorite directors at PIZAR...  Why did this happen? Did he not want to be part of it? Was he fired?

Pixar,1li2do,donniedisney,1 point,Mon Sep 2 02:25:31 2013 UTC,"It might be similar to The Emperor's New Groove then, where the first director wanted a story that was too big, and they had to change the story to keep it smaller and more focused on character. (If you haven't seen the Sweatbox Documentary, I highly recommend it.) It's possible that Peterson had been dreaming about this for too long, and the scope he set was too wide. That seems kind of tragic to me.  I hope he gets another shot, somehow. He's very talented."

Pixar,1kdxjl,Submariner739,8,Thu Aug 15 00:24:36 2013 UTC,"The way I've always seen it is that WALL-E units were programmed entirely for function with no real personality or capable AI, but through time something changed and Wall-E gained a personality and sentience, something which was fairly unique to robots in the movie.  My reasonings:   This solves the horrifyingly grim issue of Wall-E salvaging body parts off of other WALL-E units. Wall-E is unique; this means he could take the treads of another unit and have it be like car parts, but another unit taking his treads would be like ripping off his leg and not both equally the latter. Sentience is unique in this case. The other robots who have personalities appear broken to the other machines and are sent to be repaired/contained. Sentience is again unique, if misunderstood. I don't know how to spoiler tag from Alien Blue, but the ending speaks a lot to this idea. Think love and personality and stuff. Sentience is unique and robots who gain/have sentience have a ""soul"" of sorts. While ""personalities"" are programmed to be friendly to people, is it just a outward facing UI type of thing, or is it deeper? I think the former. Sentience is deeper than a programmed facade. If Wall-E is unique, was this a gradual change or a defect at creation? Sentience is unique, but the point at which it began could be gained through time or instantly through serendipity.   Flaws with my reasoning:   We don't get to see how other EVE or WALL-E units act other than Wall-E and Eve. Are they really unique? A lot of my argument requires sentient robots to be very unique. Since it's just a show, it's hard to say what the inception and catalyst would be for robot personalities to form. There is no point in time where sentience can be delineated. What is sentience, anyways? Is it a soul? Can it be simulated or emulated by these robots? Would we be able to tell if it was just an imitation? There is no way to prove my argument without proving these, which is a much more difficult task (I'm not a solipsist, but I am taking everyone else's word that they are real...)   tl;dr - Wall-E and Eve are sentient beings and have personalities, which is an extremely rare and unique trait for robots. They weren't programmed to be this way, but through fate, accident, or time, they became sentient."
Pixar,1kdxjl,drivec,4,Thu Aug 15 06:15:56 2013 UTC,"I think it would be through AI but I think it was due to a learning algorithm and lots of time.  Because the plan was that the humans were only supposed to be away for a few years or so while it was cleaned up by Wall-e's all over Earth. But the humans abandoned that notion and stayed in space for a few hundred years (or so - I haven't watched the movie for a while, shame on me).  So I think with those hundreds of years, he learned a lot of things and he (it?) seems to want to continue to learn (dancing from the TV show, picking up objects to store, eventually learning about what the Earth was).  So his learning chip seems to be fully functional after all that time (not like his worn hardware),  but having feelings on the other hand is a little different. I think it had to either be part of his programming to have basic feelings (which could be a complete waste of time because his main purpose was to just stack rubbish piles).  I'd say at some point his learning ability gave him opinions and feelings. But it's all a bit ambiguous..."
Pixar,1kdxjl,jimmypopali,2,Thu Aug 15 02:30:42 2013 UTC,"I believe it is like what was already said here, but here's a different theory.  What if robots just are sentient when they're bulit in this reality.  They could have it as a part of them to help get their directives done.  It could just normally be a side process like say a robot is going into a semi-dangerous place, the sentient process would tell the main system not to go there and the robot would leave.  In that case the robot's main system would never directly feel the fear.  This is the ehhhh part of it.  The sentient processes would communicate as a network to other same model robot sentient processes.  As the other WALL-E robots die off the network gets smaller and the sentient process needs to do more work on it's own.  While the sentient process overworks itself it becomes more part of the main system.  WALL-E is probably the most secluded robot in that reality giving him the most of a personality possible.  This might be the case with all of the robots.  M-O seems to experience emotion more as he's separated from his cleaning ""team"" Example: When they are about to leave the waste area at the end of the trash chute, WALL-E invites him and he squeals with joy.  EVE starts to fly around on Earth happily right after the ship left.  I personally don't think it's this way, but it's just an idea."

Pixar,1jy3ds,Shadowmirror,8,Thu Aug 8 09:47:09 2013 UTC,I'm hoping for a Brave play set eventually. A Bug's Life would be good as well.
Pixar,1jy3ds,pottyaboutpotter1,3,Thu Aug 8 10:16:42 2013 UTC,"I know that they are basing the characters as toys so that size doesn't matter but I think it would be really weird and funny seeing Flick the same size as Mr. Incredible. Though I would too like to see a Bugs Life set, Bugs Life is a great movie but is so underrated."
Pixar,1jy3ds,pottyaboutpotter1,3,Thu Aug 8 11:39:36 2013 UTC,"I personally hope that they add more of the Toy Story characters like Rex, Hamm, Slinky and Mr P. although less likely I would also really like to see Finding Nemo and Wall-E playsets."
Pixar,1jy3ds,johnsorci,6,Thu Aug 8 09:49:26 2013 UTC,Finding Nemo may be likely with Finding Dory out in 2015. I'm not sure how they will implement it.
Pixar,1jy3ds,Matimoo,6,Thu Aug 8 10:14:47 2013 UTC,"Yeah the playset would be easy to do because they could just swim through the landscape, but in toy box mode, maybe they could have those plastic bags."

Pixar,1ic73z,hwentworth,7,Mon Jul 15 13:41:11 2013 UTC,He helped to found Pixar.
Pixar,1ic73z,louisc,11,Mon Jul 15 17:25:01 2013 UTC,He purchased Pixar from Lucasfilm for $5 million and then invested another $5 million into it. An incredibly wise investment.
Pixar,1ic73z,BravoNavo,6,Mon Jul 15 17:27:45 2013 UTC,Incredibly wise. As a result he became the largest shareholder of Disney stock after the Pixar buyout.
Pixar,1ic73z,captainrex,3,Mon Jul 15 17:37:31 2013 UTC,I imagine Lucasfilm regrets that sale.
Pixar,1ic73z,ComedyWeekly16,9,Mon Jul 15 17:41:23 2013 UTC,"His role with Pixar was very interesting. He bought them and helped guide them as a studio, but he was very hands off with their work because it was a whole other world to him that he didn't quite understand. It sounded more like he was a mentor to them than a boss or anything else, and watching Bloomberg's Inside Pixar special that came out earlier this year, you can see that they're still heartbroken over the loss of Steve.  I think the doc is up on YouTube, though I think it was mostly focused on John Lasseter."

Pixar,1i4ken,Matimoo,4,Fri Jul 12 10:05:19 2013 UTC,"Some of those connections are stretched pretty far thin in my opinion.  However, I still enjoyed reading it.  It's an interesting theory, and would be awesome if Pixar did intend all that."
Pixar,1i4ken,johnsorci,3,Fri Jul 12 12:47:41 2013 UTC,"It's just a theory,and a very interesting read.  I love that still people fell the need to call it out for being forced or anything,it's not meant to be real,it's just a fan theory about animation movies for Christ's sake,of course is flawed,and he had to force some of those connections.  It's like some people need to always be the smartest,logical person in the room who will trump every argument."
Pixar,1i4ken,throwvirginaway,6,Fri Jul 26 22:21:52 2013 UTC,Mind blown.  Amazing read.
Pixar,1i4ken,raunchyfartbomb,2,Fri Jul 12 02:41:54 2013 UTC,"Nice idea, really strange execution."
Pixar,1i4ken,hwentworth,2,Fri Jul 12 13:57:50 2013 UTC,The same thought occurred to me recently - do all of the Pixar movies take place in the same world? This is a really interesting take on that question.
Pixar,1i4ken,ComedyWeekly16,4,Fri Jul 12 02:35:54 2013 UTC,"Yes, all Pixar movies take place in the same universe.. Technically excluding Cars, that's a world of its own"
Pixar,1i4ken,Cazberry,2,Fri Jul 12 14:59:21 2013 UTC,"But he had an explanation for that as well. Far-fetched like everything else, but an explanation nonetheless. It could seem like a different universe because it's one of the only times Pixar have shown us the AI side of the universe."
Pixar,1i4ken,ComedyWeekly16,1 point,Fri Jul 12 19:45:57 2013 UTC,"Yeah, but you have to admit that is really far fetched.. Especially given the fact that they are adding to the universe, take Planes for example.."

Pixar,1i4ken,ComedyWeekly16,1 point,Tue Jul 16 18:07:40 2013 UTC,"see.. thats the same thing thats been bothering me about Planes.. its the pixar art style, takes place in a pixar established universe.. I'm sure it has similar writers, directors, animators, etc. why is it the disney brand name?"
Pixar,1i4ken,willster816,1 point,Tue Jul 16 18:33:58 2013 UTC,"Actually all that u mentioned writers, directors, animators they are all different. They are Disney animators and directors unlike Pixar which had their own team I.e. John lasseter, it is not Pixar made it is just inspired by their work."
Pixar,1i4ken,ComedyWeekly16,2,Tue Jul 16 18:44:05 2013 UTC,"Lasseter usually works on Disney animation films as well though.. So I sort of just assumed, and if thats the case, to avoid future confusion the art style should be altered"
Pixar,1i4ken,willster816,1 point,Tue Jul 16 20:49:22 2013 UTC,"I know it should be, but that art style is what brings in the cash"
Pixar,1i4ken,ComedyWeekly16,1 point,Tue Jul 16 21:29:43 2013 UTC,"Thats an excellent point, thanks for clearing all of this up, I knew Planes wasn't under the pixar brand name but I had no clue why"
Pixar,1i4ken,CoffeeJedi,1 point,Tue Jul 16 23:25:45 2013 UTC,"I assumed that the Toy Story movies are one universe along with any future movies about inanimate objects living under the noses of unsuspecting humans (which strangely, would include the Disney distributed but not produced ""Gnomeo and Juliet"", ahem, moving on).  Universe 2 is the ""talking animal verse"", this includes A Bug's Life, Finding Nemo, and Ratatouille. Animals can all talk to each other, but not to humans. They act basically like ""real"" animals, but with an added layer of culture (families, schools, bars, circuses, etc) not seen in real life. The upcoming ""The Good Dinosaur"" will probably fit here too.  Universe 3 is the ""science fiction/fantasy verse"", encompassing Monsters Inc, The Incredibles, Up, Wall-E, and Brave. So anything found in a comic book exists here, magic, superheroes, airship adventurers, dimensional portals to alien worlds, spaceships, etc. Yeah, there's a kind of bleak ending with Wall-E, but that's par for the course for comic book universes, half the time they get wiped from the timestream anyway.  Cars and Planes has it's own thing, and I can't figure out the timeline for this one... when did the first Cars appear? Because if the town founder was an old Model A, what were his parents? Covered wagons? Steam trains? Do cars even have parents? Am I over-thinking this?"
Pixar,1i4ken,withoutanopinion,2,Fri Jul 12 20:26:44 2013 UTC,That was some shit.
Pixar,1i4ken,Cazberry,3,Fri Jul 12 08:26:51 2013 UTC,"The bit about the tree confuses me, because it's the same tree you can see in Up and Toy Story. Wich means it's clearly not in the future the author is describing.   picture"
Pixar,1i4ken,brinkel,2,Fri Jul 12 10:21:02 2013 UTC,"I don't know, they look like different trees to me. They're bent completely different ways the branches are way different."
Pixar,1i4ken,PabloMcfly,3,Fri Jul 12 19:38:16 2013 UTC,It looks like the tree is being viewed from a different angle in each movie.

My sister actually thought they were going to get scare jobs right away after their performance at the camp so personally, I thought it was awesome that they had to start at the mail room. It actually reminded me in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying -- except for the fact that they didn't suck up to get to the top, they actually WORKED!  Overall, I really liked it. But for me, Monsters Inc. will always be my favorite. The bathroom scene with Boo will always be my favorite."

Pixar,1gr4pm,thebethunetheory,2,Sat Jun 22 00:37:34 2013 UTC,"It just didn't connect with me like the other ones did. I thought it was a good movie and the story line was entertaining, but every other Pixar movie had a heart warming/audience connection moment that really gave me goosebumps, and I didn't feel that with The Incredibles. It was funny and action-packed, but I just didn't ""feel it"" as much as I did with the other movies. But that's not to say that no one else did and I know it is a favorite for many people! Just my personal feelings.  EDIT: To add also, Cars 2 is the only Pixar movie I ""don't like."" I enjoy the rest."

Pixar,1ghk4f,unfortunatejordan,3,Mon Jun 17 11:21:00 2013 UTC,"I kinda agree with one of the top comments from the TIL thread:   His point wasn't that these were the set rules that they must abide by; he was only making a point that a story in animation could be anything, and that they shouldn't limit themselves in their process. Of course, they wanted to be different from Disney, but Disney was successful for a reason, and they didn't have to be anti-disney just for the sake of being anti-disney.   Pixar's philosophy is much bigger than just ""not Disney"", that just misrepresents what the writing process is about. Most good studios try and set themselves apart from others, not because they are 'right' and others are 'wrong', but because it's just a good idea to make something different that stands out, as opposed to something that's been seen already and blends into the background.  From ""The Pixar Story"":   Lasseter - We did not want to do a musical. We did not want to do a fairytale. We did not want to do what Disney was, from Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast and all those films. They had their thing going and we wanted to be different.   Oddly enough, it was Disney that was trying to meddle with Toy Story to make it more adult and less 'kiddy', quite against the Disney 'rules' that originated with Walt.   Lasseter - There was this desire at Disney to make Toy Story edgy. Make it like, something for adults.  Schumacher - Jeffrey Katzenberg, who at the time was chairman of the Disney studios ... would always in a story meeting be pushing for what he'd call ""edge"", which really was code for snappy, adult, the edge of inappropriate and not to feel too young."

Nor can you hate on one were even the plot line has yet to be released.  One can argue that Wreck It Ralph is just Toy Story but with video games. And The Lion King is Kimba the White Lion. Don't tell me that Disney hasn't adapted from films that have already been made (Alice in Wonderland was first made in 1904. Peter Pan? 1924, theatrical squeal in 2003. No one's made a movie about Rupunzel? 1983 with  Shelley Duvall). There were a number of Disney sequels released theatrically, but Dreamworks has had more.

Pixar,1cp3sn,philycheezestake,1 point,Sat Apr 20 08:19:09 2013 UTC,"All I can really say is, ""What do you want, darker and more edgy animations will always get swept under the rug"". That's pretty much what his ranting is about. So what if we have heard stories like this time and time again, it's the subject matter that we're aiming for. Example, Monsters Inc. (which he hated to a T), it was just monster living just like us, but that was not the point, in order to get the story across we can't dwell on something that will take longer to explain. And kids simply will get lost in it and never understand the ending or moral if they did get lost in understanding how their world works. We have to familiarize our selves things we know, and kids require more than adults.  Maybe Pixar isn't the best animation studio, but they still know how to work around the red tape well enough in order to get the message out and pleasing to the audience. Brave was a great example of this. They could have done more and did feel kind of short, but it still felt like a great movie. You appreciate the cultural beauty of the movie, through the background designs and characters.  And who gives a crap about borrowing from different elements, you can't halt inspiration. We all know about The Lion King, who cares, their way of telling the story and presentation was simply wonderful. I just don't find his argument valid, because you can't hate on a kids movie, that brought adults to the theaters.  And I feel he does a 180 on his apology. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PFHL8cPqys"

John is truly a kid stuck in an adult's body. Lee loves monkeys and the shining. Brad is a maniac/mastermind genious. Andrew is all about stories. And Pete loves tender, emotional moments and meditation on introverted/lonely characters. Thus, I know that this movie is gonna be the biggest tear-jerk of all time."

I'll hold off my doubts until after seeing Monsters University, since all we really have for reference is the Toy Story sequels (amazing) and Cars 2 (the opposite of amazing.)  Also, I thought the purpose of the Vancouver campus was to make these sequels / money-making projects, so that Emeryville could focus on exciting new stories, and they would release two features (one original, one sequel) a year."

Pixar,1bit18,AlterMatey,5,Wed Apr 3 11:53:01 2013 UTC,"True, and they both sound like really cool ideas (from what I've read so far). But Pixar has gone from releasing just two Toy Story sequels from 1995 through to 2010, to releasing a Cars sequel and a Monsters Inc prequel within two years of each other, and announcing a Finding Nemo sequel release for two years from now. I'm not surprised that Pixar fans are becoming a little uneasy.  I'm choosing to withhold judgement. The Toy Story sequels were amazing, so they massively outweigh the apparently awful Cars 2 (which I have avoided watching because I think that Mater is by far the worst character that they have ever come up with). Monsters University looks great as well, so as long as the advertising isn't misleading, I willing to overlook the sequels as long as we still get a couple of new ideas between each one."

It's too early to make a snap decision about whether or not a Finding Nemo sequel is a bad idea. But I can understand why people would be getting edgy; Pixar has been planning a lot more sequels recently than they used to.  Personally, Finding Nemo is one of my least favourite Pixar films. I enjoyed it, but it was nothing special, in my opinion. So to me, this announcement isn't exciting in the slightest."

Pixar,1bit18,Burst15,1 point,Tue Apr 2 18:40:19 2013 UTC,"I'm another who really isn't keen on the sequels that seem to be happening lately. Looking at all of Pixar sequels, the Toy Story ones were amazing, and in my opinion they even surpassed the original, Cars 2 was worse than the original, and seeing as Monsters Inc is my favourite Pixar film I'm really happy about MU, however I feel a prequel, or even a sequel, wasn't really warranted. Alas, I'm not complaining about that, because I love MI.  However, not only am I annoyed about Pixar making another sequel, I'm annoyed that it's a sequel to Finding Nemo. How on earth did that film need a sequel? I'm fairly sure the story ended when they cough found Nemo...   I'm glad they're not rehashing the story though, else that would have been terrible and certainly would have made me lose a lot of respect for Pixar. At least Finding Dory is a different idea, but still, I really don't feel like the world of Nemo and co needs revisiting. The film was fine as it was.  Personally I think the only films in the Pixar canon now that warrant a sequel are The Incredibles, or A Bugs Life (I would love to see their world being recreated with the technology we have now. It would look stunning). Anyway, we'll see. Maybe Pixar will surprise us all with Finding Dory. If it's as good as, or even better than the original, I'll be happy. Anything less and it'll just feel completely pointless to me."

Pixar,1awhsp,throwaway56790,20,Sun Mar 24 05:52:30 2013 UTC,"I disagree. Not because I think Pixar can do no wrong but because I think people simplify this movie. It wasn't about a rebellious teenage girl who didn't want to get married - it was about the relationship between a mother and her daughter, and how important that is, despite generational differences.   Also I haven't seen any other movies about this? Most of the movies I have seen involving Princesses are basically, ooh how is she going to end up with the Prince, because obviously woman can't live happy fulfilled lives otherwise. There have been Disney movies that have been better with this and had strong female characters (Mulan, Princess and the Frog) but the girl still ends up with the guy in the end. I love Brave for not falling prey to this and for offering girls a strong female role model without the underlying assumption that they need a 'Prince' to complete their life."

Pixar,1awhsp,ImRafix,5,Sun Mar 24 13:27:12 2013 UTC,"Sewing was actually a total misinterpretation on Merida's part. The witch didn't say 'sew up the tapastry'. She said 'Heal the bond'. Eleanor didn't turn back from a bear when the tapestry was fixed, she turned back when Merida broke down and took responsibility for her actions (She'd previously gone through the film blaming other people for her motives and actions). The bond was not the tapestry. The bond was between her and her mother.   As for the bond with the four kings, well yes there was the stone tablet which caused Merida to make her assumption in the first place but the fact that their kingdom fell to ruin also indicated that the bond between Mordu and his brothers was never healed.   Another reason I loved this film so much is the fact they didn't go and overtly spell all of it out in the end."

From what I've heard, when they make a sequel, it's whenever they have ideas, they don't just force things, nothing is planned, so it's very possible that they've just had an influx in ideas on where to take existing IPs.   In any case, I am looking forward to Monsters Uni., Toy Story 3 was a serious tear jerker, and Cars 2 was iffy (kinda like Brave in that sense).  That's cool though, you seem mature for your age, at least, more so than I and many others were at that age (and still are)."

Pixar,1aqfci,flapcats,6,Thu Mar 21 16:46:27 2013 UTC,"Data files for an animated movie are way smaller than the actual movie itself. A fully rigged character (at that time) could have been just a few megabytes in size.  All the characters, props and sets exist as one-off data structures that get instanced throughout the scenes (ie, referenced not duplicated) and the files containing the keyframes of the animation aren't too big either, especially if they contain mostly rig transform keys as opposed to explicitly cached vertex deformation.  To explain that idea, if you're animating a CG hulk back in 1999, you're setting keys on the skeleton inside of him, position, rotation, scale and the time at which these keys occur. This makes for a small data file. In 2012, in the Avengers movie, they ran full muscle and tissue simulations on the hulk which require a fantastic amount of data for every point in his mesh which quickly can add up to hundreds of megabytes, if not a few gigabytes of data for every shot. A lot of work to get right, looks dope, though. Source of comment"

Pixar,19oou9,Spenceticle,5,Tue Mar 5 03:51:30 2013 UTC,"My understanding is that Bob Iger put John Lassetter essentially in creative charge of everything at Pixar, Disney Animation, and Imagineering. I think they called him ""chief creative officer.""  So basically, since he was a founding member of Pixar, he knows how to let them work best and I think typically does so."
Pixar,19oou9,armourdave,1 point,Tue Mar 5 04:15:18 2013 UTC,"Virtually none.  In fact, Disney Feature Animation effectively reports to Pixar.  Disney does, however, have virtual all of the financial control, hence the sequels."
Pixar,19oou9,mudclub,1 point,Sat Mar 9 16:55:55 2013 UTC,"When Planes was announced, I recall reading that it was being done by Pixar's studio in Canada.  It was intended to go directly to video at the time.  Now that it's going to be a theatrical release, it seems to be a Disney effort.  I find that suspicious.  They're trying to protect the Pixar brand at the expense of the Disney brand.  Pixar said they wouldn't do DTV sequels, and so they're not.  However, last time they did do a DTV film it was Toy Story 2, and it made the studio.   This tells us two things: Planes is shit, and Pixar knows that however successful the Cars franchise was with kids, it's a poison pill in the long run.  They think that Disney as a brand can survive the tarring and feathering, but that it's more important to repair Pixar's somewhat tarnished reputation.    Full disclosure: I didn't care for Brave at all.  I thought Wreck It Ralph should have won the Oscar, and the feminist slant (to a film they tore from what would have been their first female creator/director, no less!) was enough to rule the day for the Academy.  Feh."
Pixar,19oou9,sybersonic,1 point,Tue Mar 12 21:00:37 2013 UTC,Planes is shit.     I couldn't agree more. As soon as I saw the trailer I thought this. It is something that is spun off from the greatness of Cars. Plane and simple. (no pun intended)

Pixar,19601f,nopicnic,13,Mon Feb 25 03:59:25 2013 UTC,"Well Monsters Inc. lost to Shrek in 2001, and Cars lost to Happy Feet in 2006. Also, Cars 2 was never nominated. So I don't know if the Academy always favors Pixar.  Brave did have the better animation. That might have something to do with the voting, much like how cinematography has a lot to do with the success of other Oscar-winning films.  Brave also dealt with the social issue of gender equality and that may have something to do with its winning as well."
Pixar,19601f,maxwood,1 point,Mon Feb 25 07:16:15 2013 UTC,"That's interesting, Shrek was excellent even if Monsters Inc is probably just as good. Cars isn't my favourite but then again Happy Feet wasn't spectacular either.  Seems like two very close calls I think."

Pixar,192vtb,OliverAnd,7,Sat Feb 23 14:50:39 2013 UTC,"The Pixar Story is a fantastic documentary. I've watched it multiple times and can't get enough of it.   One book that I can think of is To Infinity and Beyond!: The Story of Pixar Animation Studios. I've never read it fully, but plan to buy it someday. It has interviews, storyboards, concept art, and more."
Pixar,192vtb,dietcokee,4,Sat Feb 23 15:15:30 2013 UTC,I read The Pixar touch a couple of years ago and it was good.  There's also a huge To Infinity and Beyond book that has a lot of pictures and history.

I mean, it might turn out decently, but Pixar should really take a cue from Ghibli (you know, that other great modern animation studio) and always emphasize new, original content over its newly-acquired chronic sequel-itis."
Pixar,18gbgm,dhusk,7,Wed Feb 13 20:08:14 2013 UTC,It really might turn out decently. Dory is probably my favorite Pixar character. But I absolutely cringe every time another Pixar sequel is announced. They promised us this wouldn't be the result of the Disney acquisition.
Pixar,18gbgm,animationguy,9,Wed Feb 13 22:27:58 2013 UTC,"I don't understand the problem. You cannot possibly tell me the Toy Story sequels were not brilliant movies. I have heard nothing but acclaim for Toy Story 3 especially.  The only sequel they've had which was 'bad' was Cars 2, but given that Cars was their weakest offering before that, I am not surprised it was less than stellar. Out of 13 movies, Pixar have only let us down once. The Finding Nemo sequel probably won't be out until 2017, so let's just cool our heels."
Pixar,18gbgm,animationguy,1 point,Wed Feb 13 23:06:50 2013 UTC,"I agree with all that. And obviously Pixar isn't going to be able to maintain a perfect (or near-perfect) track record forever. But, to me at least, announcements of sequels seem like a greater risk for something less than the ingenuity and genius we've come to expect from Pixar than do announcements of original stories like Brave, The Good Dinosaur, or even Newt. Any one of these could turn out to be a dud, but when it's a sequel/rehash/franchise it seems like the deck is stacked against you from the start.  But as I said, it could turn out great. Toy Story 3 did - certainly in the last reel at least. And the decision to do Monsters University instead of Monsters Inc. 2 fills me with hope that it will also be satisfying. All I'm saying is more sequels make me nervous. And every time someone mentions The Incredibles 2 I want to claw my brain out. It's perfect just as it is. Don't go changin' it."
Pixar,18gbgm,animationguy,4,Thu Feb 14 01:00:57 2013 UTC,"I can see your point and, of course it's completely valid. Announcement of a sequel does seem a bit more like resting on their laurels than a new creative endeavour. I think they would make sure they have a good concept before deciding to make a sequel. I think Cars 2 has definitely shown Pixar they cannot just rely on previous success.  One thing I don't understand, and this is true for all sequels and not just Pixar, is why do some people feel as if the sequels taint the original in some way? There is a part of me which would love to see a sequel to The Incredibles, but I just don't understand how that would be changing anything about the original."
Pixar,18gbgm,suehtomit,2,Thu Feb 14 01:26:00 2013 UTC,"I understand what you mean about the original, and I suppose it's different depending on your mindset. For me, I can't forget about the sequel and treat it as a totally separate story. It becomes a different chapter in the same story and now it's a bigger story. So if the sequel is a cheap rip-off and disrespects the characters that reflects on the original (at least, for crazy people like me). Obviously that's not something Brad Bird would ever do, but if there's never an Incredibles 2 then we can guarantee it won't happen.   Sequels walk a very difficult line between giving the audience more of what they want (and expect) vs. forging new territory. (Which is what the original did, which is why the audience loved it, hence a rather hairy Catch-22 that is seldom resolved in a satisfying manner.) Pixar doesn't put out 2-3 movies a year like Dreamworks and doesn't automatically consider each new movie the launch of a franchise. I respect that and I think it accounts for a lot of their success. Hopefully they'll continue to navigate the sequel minefield well, but when it comes to my favorite movie of all time, the film that made me want to invest years and thousands of dollars into seeking a career in animation myself... well, I guess I'd rather not chance it. Leave well enough alone.   tl;dr: I like The Incredibles an awful lot. Also I am a crazy person."
Pixar,18gbgm,suehtomit,1 point,Fri Feb 15 00:45:31 2013 UTC,"You're not a crazy person. That makes a lot of sense and I appreciate you taking the time to explain it. I just sometimes to struggle to understand both sides of a discussion. Thank you for not being one of those people who actually explains instead of having a knee-jerk reaction thinking I want to start an argument. I am always interested in learning more.  For what it's worth, I don't think you're wrong. I don't think each title needs a sequel. I am a bit wary of a sequel to Finding Nemo, but I have confidence in Pixar to not let us down.  My problem is that the movie might simply be good. Maybe it is unfair of me, but I hold Pixar to a higher standard than many others. I don't want a Pixar movie to be good. I expect them to be amazing. It's one of only two things I expect from a Pixar movie. The other thing is John Ratzenberger."
Pixar,18gbgm,suehtomit,1 point,Fri Feb 15 01:39:10 2013 UTC,"Problem is, unless they change the name, chances is that it's gonna suck.   Take a while to think. Finding Nemo 2.   Nemo gets lost again? But this time, it'll happen without the plot of an overbearing father and instead, a completed character arc already.   Monster Uni might work out pretty well, seeing that it's a prequel, so there's plots to be dug out from there."

Pixar,17lx86,mosby_18,5,Thu Jan 31 04:07:23 2013 UTC,"FYI, Attribution is a nice thing to do.  To wit, a designer named Louie Mantia made that (and has many other nice wallpapers)  http://mantia.me/wallpaper/andys-room/"

Pixar,16mkso,ihateirony,1 point,Wed Jan 16 00:55:43 2013 UTC,why do you say that?
Pixar,16mkso,philycheezestake,1 point,Wed Jan 16 02:59:07 2013 UTC,"I you ask me, Wall-E and C3PO seem more awkward and uptight, whereas R2D2 and EVE are more adventurous and mischievous."
Pixar,16mkso,ihateirony,0,Wed Jan 16 09:19:42 2013 UTC,"Dude, Eve is definitely more uptight. She spends half the movie trying to get Wall-E to go back to earth while Wall-E basically causes all the mischief all over the ship. Not to mention Wall-E and Eve's speech are about the same. Wall-E mostly emotes with beeps and noises while Eve can actually say a few different words (and in different languages too)."

Pixar,16mkso,ihateirony,1 point,Wed Jan 16 09:39:24 2013 UTC,"It's my favorite Pixar movie, there was a time where I would watch it obsessively haha I just think there are more parallels between Wall-E and R2 than with Eve, but it's all subjective"
Pixar,16mkso,philycheezestake,1 point,Wed Jan 16 10:13:27 2013 UTC,"It is subjective, but you're probably right! I don't have a clear enough memory to argue the point, so I've to defer to the person who seems to!"
