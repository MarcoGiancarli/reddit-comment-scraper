investing,3e45c8,fireandnoise,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:48:28 2015 UTC,That's true enough. But if you learn all your investing knowledge from subs you aren't the most savvy of humans.  I learned the basics here then moved on to blogs from people that had achieved success investing.  You don't know if the stranger online is a retired millionaire or a middle manager drowning in debt.  Judging by the amount of speculation masked as investing I'm going to bet the latter.
investing,3e45c8,vagina_fang,3,Tue Jul 21 22:33:43 2015 UTC,"Wait, no degree?  So what was all that talk about financial education?  You learned the basics on reddit and then moved to blogs?  Better take that youtube degree off your wall.  You're delusional.  And just look at these quality comments: ""full retard"", ""This sub is good if you know nothing..."" elitist despite your clearly limited financial education.  You think you can predict Apple's stock price?  Go ahead, make a prediction.  Calling someone else's prediction ""full retard"" is a cop-out not financial expertise.  What a joke.  Following your comments is hilarious.  Best entertainment in a long while."

If apples numbers were put in place of ANY OTHER COMPANY, the stock would have exploded.

investing,3e45c8,purpl3_dinosaur,18,Tue Jul 21 20:58:53 2015 UTC,"Apparently three things:   iphone(6) sales missed the revised estimates by about a million.

I have no clue."
investing,3e45c8,miscsubs,2,Tue Jul 21 21:03:21 2015 UTC,"Pretty much a mixture of these factors at this point.  Guidance was very slightly revised downward for the next quarter.  Everyone is shitting themselves that this means no one is buying phones but there's a million little inventory and supply chain factors that could explain a small downward revision like this.  iPhone sales were bumped up by analysts over the last week to around 48-50+ million units by a lot of analysts, clearly they fell short of the low end of that but were still still higher than the 46ish million units most people had things pegged at two weeks ago.  There's a lot of concern over China and I would expect that where a lot of the questions in the conference call are going to be focused, trying to eek out some color there about what sales were like the past month.  It's concluded at this point but I prefer to read transcripts anyways.  Apple beat pretty handily by most metrics and had extremely strong revenue growth in all its markets.  Margins were healthy and despite all the outcry guidance was revised down maybe 2%.  Unless they're noticing a ton of softness or the Chinese market absolutely collapses it's underpriced by about 12-13%.  I had sold my shares around $126 when things in China started looking grim to lock in a gain and offset some losses I've taken on oil drillers.  Rolled calls over the course of last week and rode that wave up.  Bought 5 calls at a 140 strike for the 24th just in case they managed to slam it out of the park so that's all I'm down this week on earnings.  We'll see how much it slides in the next 2-3 weeks.  I'll definitely be a buyer at 115, still think the company is undervalued but usually when the market shits on AAPL after earnings it trends downward a bit more for a few weeks afterwards.  Might revise that after reading the CC transcript too to see what exactly is causing them to revise guidance.  TL;DR still not the end of the world and Apple isn't entering perpetual decline."
investing,3e45c8,ObservationalHumor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:38:55 2015 UTC,"The issue is price vs. expectations.  So lets say there is value here.  Is there value at 140?  How about 150?

Many of the loans are extremely long term, with high interests to high risk customers. It is dubious they can finance the rates for so long. If you later then start mass-repossessing cars, they are not going to be worth as much as the loan (cars deprecate in value over time contrary to houses) so that is a part write-off there, and the flood of used vehicles would then hurt the actual business of the car companies, as well as make the reselling value of that fleet of used and repossessed SUVs fall further when they all sit there on the lots.  Also think about such things as cash-conversion cycle and so on. The more the companies sell against their own financing arms, the more they ship out good cars at full value that they paid the materials and work for and in return only blow up a figure on paper on the other side of the conglomerats balance sheet. What do you finance the new cars of tomorrow with that you need cash now to build? I think besides the perhaps questionable structure of the loans they might actually be financing and lending themselves deep into a hole if they are not very careful. I recall the story of.. what was it Greentree? The trailer financer? I have my doubts the car makers have it 100% under control and all planned out."

investing,3e2r3a,aron2295,7,Tue Jul 21 19:11:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, it returns good dividends too! If you invest in a Fiesta ST or Focus ST you get a free weekend at Ford Octane Racing Academy :-)  all kidding aside as a car guy here's how I see Ford.  Their economy offerings are amazing and continue to look great in the future.  They have a decent interior with kind of an eh feel to some of it, but overall it's a good economy interior, tons of features and tech.  Most of all they are amazingly affordable cars.  Their performance cars are great too the new designed mustang is one of the most beautiful ones in decades, and one of the nicest fastest cars you can get for that money.  Their affordable performance market will continue to perform as it is growing as well with the upcoming Focus RS, with the WRX/STi stagnent, and the Lancer Evo gone, and the Mazdaspeed 3 god knows how many years away from relaunch it's the car everyone who used to want a WRX will want.  Everyone loves what ford is doing right now, they took some cues from their days with Aston Martin mixed it with some reliable affordability and are making decent cars.  Fords faults it completely and entirely lacks a decent luxury vehicle offering.  Sinking Mercury was the wrong move, they should have spun it into a BMW/Audi competitor, sporty luxury.  If they took some of what they are doing with their affordable performance cars and mashed it with a rock solid luxury interior and just ran the brand with a small sedan / coupe, a nice quick larger sedan / grand coupe, and maybe a niche roadster or something they could hit it out of the park.  There were some quick mercury's way back in the day they could ""borrow heritage"" from as well.  By dissolving the Mercury brand and selling aston/landrover they put lincoln in a weird place.  Lincoln is trying to cover both young and old crowds when it's arguable an old people car, and it's hard to shake that image.  Nothing they offer suits any of the luxury segments well enough to sell a car well, and I hope someone at ford is reading this.  Lincoln is a car for old blue blooded Americans who want a luxury barge that feels like their living room on wheels, and basically forces you to drive slowly and smoothly despite having decent power, it will NEVER SHAKE THAT IMAGE, EMBRACE IT.  Slap those ""Made with pride in detroit"" stickers on them.  What they offer now no one wants and the sales figures show that.  You want lincoln to be the affordable alternative to a Mercedes.  A solid luxury offering is really their real setback, and I don't know how into electric they are besides offering a few hybrids and I think an all electric focus or fiesta but it's something they should be working on as everyone else is.  If they were to announce a new sporty luxury marquee and let lincon do their thing, you'd see a nice increase in that stock price.  edit: If the Lincoln continental launches like the concept looks, and that's the direction they take that brand in, they'll be doing better.  But cars rarely live up to the concepts..."
investing,3e2r3a,tjandearl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:18:55 2015 UTC,"from the latest update, the Conti is gonna be based on the Fusions FWD platform. In the car world, if its luxury, it NEEDS to be RWD or ""true"" AWD. Not that fwd biased awd. Im a huge Ford guy but yea, i think they just need to get rid of everything except the Navigator and even if they dropped the Navigator, i doubt anyone would miss it too much. They need a big, RWD sedan thats has that American confidence, not European subtleness with a powerful motor that allows you to chill out on the highway in its big leather seats but makes a statement when you pull up in it that youre ready to get to work. They also need a personal luxury coupe that has a little bit of sport in it. While i think it should take on the Infiniti G series and BMw 6 Series type of cars. And a smaller sedan thats again, rwd or awd and gets younger buyers into the brand."

There are thousands of analysts out there who do not beat the market, and they work upwards of 40 hours a week trying to do so. If they can't beat the market with that much effort, why should you be able to? I'm not trying to put you down; like you said, you're new to stocks.   It's actually quite easy to get average returns on your investments, and they often are much better than 'average' implies. Invest in a S&P 500 Index fund, and do not sell it. You become well-diversified  (you are invested in 500 large companies in different sectors) and you will see positive results. If you invested that $1000 30 years ago and did nothing, it would be upwards of $12,000.   So in summary, my suggestion is to find an S&P Index to invest in and ride the market. While you do so, read some books on investing to make sure your investment strategy is does not rely on speculation about future stock market trends."

One metric that isn't used much that I like to estimate is the % of overall shares of a particular company that the fund holds (not the % it represents of their own portfolio) . This may give you an even better sense of their conviction in the business.

If you are using 13-F filings, make sure the fund has very long holding periods to account for this. Even then, if there is market-moving news, you wont really know their position until the next report.

A: Among other things, Form 13F filings must include:   the issuer name of all Section 13(f) securities (which should be listed in alphabetical order); a description of the class of security listed (e.g., common stock, put/call option, class A shares, convertible debenture); the number of shares owned;  and the fair market value of the securities listed, as of the end of the calendar quarter.

My former fund is also looking to launch these products and it really should be meant for sophisticated investors.  I do believe many funds can be replicated to factors though :) The taper tantrum starting May 2013 showed how many funds had exposure to FX carry strategies. 2/20 isn't worth it!

Shallower OS integration. Cannot use Siri, while on Apple music you can just say ""play me X song"" or ""play some indie music"". Apple refuses to provide 3rd party access to Siri. Phones come with music apps already installed, as do computers. Spotify is forced to strongly make the case that they are superior. Apple music curated playlists (which it inherited from Beats, who pioneered it) works better. Spotify has been playing catch up.   It's going to be like 3rd party browsers on mobile.

The purpose of a money market fund is to provide a better return than holding cash, but with less interest rate risk and default risk than bonds. The securities that a money market fund buys are extremely liquid and creditworthy. A money market is basically a place to park your cash for a very small return while you decide what mutual funds or ETFs you want to buy.  Right now, interest rates are so low the difference between taxable and tax-exempt money market funds is negligible. But in more normal times, taxable funds have a higher yield than the tax-exempt funds, because what investors care about is after-tax returns.   Which type is better depends on an investor's marginal income tax rate. Imagine that a taxable money market fund yields 4% and a tax-exempt money market fund yields 3%. If your marginal tax rate is 40%, you would choose the tax-exempt fund, because your after-tax yield on the taxable money market fund would only be 2.4%, 3%*(1-40%). But if your marginal tax rate were only 15%, you would choose the taxable money market account because your after-tax yield would be 3.4%, still better than the tax-exempt money market fund."

investing,3e29a2,ZosoGG,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:55:18 2015 UTC,"I have a question about options trading. I am a noob. I understand that options are not margin able, but what can I do in a specific instance where, for instance, a call option terminates in the money and I have the right to buy say $10,000 worth of the underlying, and the current market price will make that stock worth say, $15,000 (the numbers don't really matter). Now if I do not have the money to purchase the $10,000 worth of the stock, is there any way I can still borrow the required amount from my broker (etrade), sell the stock immediately for a profit, then return all the money I borrowed, no harm done? I thought about opening a margin account for just this reason, but I don't think that I should have to open a margin account just for this silly reason as I am not actually trying to use risky leverage. Also if you could let me know if the call exercise could just be a cashless exercise so I would avoid having to borrow money in the first place that would be helpful. Thanks"
investing,3e29a2,GigaPat,2,Tue Jul 21 16:17:56 2015 UTC,Completely new to options myself so take this with a grain of salt. Once an option terminates you no longer have the option and are unable to do anything with it. Make sure to exercise before the end. Additionally if you are in the money on the option you can sell the option itself and make your profit there instead of by buying and sellign the stock. Hope this helps.
investing,3e29a2,DarkAutumn,2,Tue Jul 21 17:57:47 2015 UTC,"It depends on what your goal is.  If you wanted to own the underlying stock, then yes, you need to either have all the money required to exercise the call, or have a margin account so you can do that.  If all you are looking to do is make a profit and not own the underlying, you can simply sell the call option to close.  You will collect a profit selling an in the money call option.  Just don't leave it to the last minute, do something with that option Friday morning at the latest."
investing,3e29a2,ZosoGG,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:57:51 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks for the response, that makes a lot of sense. If I may ask a couple follow up questions: 1. Is the price of selling the option going to be comparable to the amount of profit I would make if I just exercised the option? Obviously this depends but just a general question. 2. I already asked etrade this and they werent much help and hopefully you can shed some light on it. In the situation I gave in my original comment, lets say that me choosing to exercise the option and purchase the stock would make me borrow so much money comparable to my assets that my equity would fall below the minimun etrade requirement of 25%. Even though this would put me in violation of their policy, i would immediately sell the stock for a profit and thus return my liabilities to 0 and no longer in violation. Would this be allowed? This is why I asked specifically if an exercise of an option could be an automatic thing (aka, buy and sell the stock immediately, digitally). Anyway hope that makes sense and dont feel obligated to answer if you dont want to lol"
investing,3e29a2,DarkAutumn,2,Tue Jul 21 18:12:11 2015 UTC,"You can always find out and see.  Just look at the bid price on the option chain for the one you own.  Compare that to the current stock price - strike price.  Selling the stock will likely result in more, but not too much more money (the intrinsic value of the option should mostly account here).  Plus you will likely pay more trading fees to sell the stock as well, cutting into your profits. I'm not sure.  You likely will be in violation of their trading policies since it takes 3 days to settle sales of stock anyway.  However, that's just pure guesswork.   Since this is a LOT of your capital (percentage-wise), I would just sell the option and not risk it, even if you lose a small bit of the profits."

investing,3e29a2,DarkAutumn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:51 2015 UTC,"Keep some of that in savings.  No matter what you need to have an emergency fund of 3-6 months income in savings in case you lose your job/etc.  However much that is, you need to NOT invest it.  This keeps you from selling investments for a loss (or taking on CC debt at a high interest rate) when the unexpected happens.  For the rest...  Basically you are running into the problem with safety vs returns.  You want liquid assets, very safe, very limited risk, and yet you want your money to make decent returns.  That's basically not possible.  Your options would be something like a money market account, with introductory rates you might be able to find 0.5-1% returns for 6 months.  The absolute most risky you could do (given your criteria) is something like Short Term Bonds, which you can cash out at any time.  Only 1.5% returns (or so), and you CAN lose money investing into short bonds, but the risk is the lowest you'll get other than money market account/savings.  Other than that, don't expect much if you need liquid assets and no risk.  If there were money to be made doing that, everyone would instead of stocks/etc."
investing,3e29a2,oxslashxo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:15 2015 UTC,"So let's step away from that, let's say I can set aside some money,  5k, that I won't touch for at least two years, what should I look into?"
investing,3e29a2,DarkAutumn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:39:22 2015 UTC,"With that amount of money you should look into an all-in-one fund (it's diversified for you).  My personal favorite would be one of the Vanguard LifeStrategy funds, since it has low cost.  Take a look at the various offerings there, and take a look at how asset allocation affects risk.  Personally I put my money there for a while until I had built up enough to diversify it.  Keep in mind that two years is kinda pushing it.  The real risk here if you picked ""Moderate Growth"" or ""Growth"" (or a similar fund with the right balance) is that in two years (or however long) you need the money but the fund is down a good amount...which eventually would go back up and higher when the markets rebounded...but that could take years and you had to withdraw the money at a loss before that happened.  Something like ""LifeStrategy Income"" has much lower returns, but also lower risk if you pulled out the money early.  Something like ""LifeStrategy Conservative/Moderate Growth"" is probably ok for you if you can stand to hold the fund for longer than 2 years during a downturn.  If you want something MUCH more risky you could just invest purely in the SNP500 (see Vanguard's SNP500 fund or similar funds), but you're completely in stock then and could gain or lose a lot if you cashed out ""early"".  (And I still don't recommend this.)  The whole idea behind a long time horizon is the market will go up and down, but you only realize those losses when you sell your shares of the fund.  If you can afford to tie up that 5k for a longer time than two years (and have the stomach to not sell it if the value of it halfs on paper), then you can afford something more risky.  If you can't, DON'T put your money into something you can't stomach the swings on or bet it on a lot of stock if you withdraw in two years."

investing,3e29a2,Careless_Con,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:05:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice!  Can I ask why a Roth IRA and not a regular IRA?  Isn't the benefit of a traditional IRA the immediate tax deduction upon deposit and (supposing the planned goal of having very limited income at retirement) reducing the tax bracket at which the withdrawals from the IRA would be taxed?
investing,3e29a2,sthussey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:15:12 2015 UTC,I think it depends if you truly want very limited income at retirement. I personally use a Roth IRA now (35 y/o) as I hope to have a fairly comfortable retirement and I have lots of years for those Roth contributions to grow tax free. I need to run the numbers at some point to see if it is advantageous to switch contributions over to a Traditional IRA when my time horizon gets short enough for the taxes on the gains to be less than the immediate tax deduction.
investing,3e29a2,Careless_Con,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:09:29 2015 UTC,Is there a difference between IRA and Roth IRA growth once the money is already in there? Aren't the differences entirely on deposit or withdrawal?
investing,3e29a2,sthussey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:50:31 2015 UTC,"You're exactly right. It is entirely on deposit and withdrawal. You pay taxes on every dollar you deposit for a Roth IRA, you pay taxes on every dollar you withdrawal with a traditional. If you start saving at 25, most of the money you withdrawal will be from growth not contributions. So overall tax liability tends to be less w/ a Roth when you start early. If you are starting at 50, your principle at retirement may be mostly contributions so it may make sense to save the taxes while you are working in order to increase how much you can afford to contribute."

If you were to invest that same $1000 but, phase those purchased in by intervals of $250 and sell all at once, you would need the stock to increase in value by 5% to break even.

This isn't for everyone. Many people like to pay for hand holding and professional advice.   You should be getting some sort of quarterly report about where you've invested, how those investments are performing (including a baseline), and agreed upon targets for rebalancing, risk tolerance, contributions/withdrawals. In a perfect world, this report would include fees related to your asset management but almost no one does this :/  Perhaps all this info can be found in your online portfolio. I personally like the idea of quarterly reports more. It's a set time that can be dedicated to finance management. Online portfolios have the option of instant access but often become forgotten for both you and your financial advisor. Getting things on cruise control is great but why are you paying someone to do nothing?"

Until then, its a big burning bill.  As for why using someone else... as my original OP said I was pigeonholed into it. I could always leave, but that would be very complicated. I would love to start to learn how to do it myself - and my manager I believe is going to help me do this in a smaller account that we'll be making more aggressive trades with? I'm not exactly sure.  I'm simply unsure what would happen if I took the money and went elsewhere like vanguard and managed it myself. My home is in a trust, I am the sole trustee, but there is a trustor. The trust is managed by this same manager, so if I up and leave, then I'm worried about the home. It's family, so I shouldn't be worried, and the thought I am kind of sickens me.....  I would like to start learning how to do it myself though for certain... But there is quite a bit of a complicated setup that needs to be done initially so an adviser probably isn't the worst idea."

investing,3e2uui,getyashinebox,8,Tue Jul 21 15:12:36 2015 UTC,"A Roth 401K has the same tax treatment as a Roth IRA, but less flexibility on withdrawals.  If you have no Roth IRA, it probably makes sense to start one.  If that is instead of some or all of your contributions to the Roth 401K, that still makes sense.  You can't transfer money that you already contributed to the Roth 401K until you leave that job.  Then it probably will make sense to transfer it to a Roth IRA.  But maybe not, and anyway worry about that decision when you are near leaving the job, not far ahead of time. If you work at one of the very few companies whose 401K plan offers better mutual funds than you can get in a Vanguard Roth account, it still may make sense to get a Roth IRA opened and get a few thousand into it, but then go back to contributing to the Roth 401K.  But for normal 401K plans (typically a bit worse than a Vanguard Roth IRA) your priorities would be: 1) Enough in the 401K or Roth 401K to get the max employer match. 2) $5500 per year in a Roth IRA 3) The rest in the 401K or Roth 401K.    A Roth 401K tends to be used for money you will transfer over to a Roth IRA when you leave the job and would prefer to have in a Roth IRA sooner if you could.  As compared to a Roth IRA, the Roth 401K is a little less effort for you and, not subject to the $5500 per year limit (A separate $18K per year limit applies to the sum of your 401K and Roth 401K contributions).  The Ro9th 401K also has no income limit, so high income individuals can use the Roth 401K without the complexity of a ""back door"" Roth.  So a Roth 401K is a very nice option for many people, but generally a slightly worse choice than a Roth IRA to the extent that you have such a choice."
investing,3e2uui,jsf67,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:38:23 2015 UTC,Very good post but can you elaborate on why a Roth 401k is worse than a Roth Ira?
investing,3e2uui,humjaba,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:07:50 2015 UTC,"1)  You can withdraw contributions tax and penalty free at any time from a Roth IRA.  But not from a Roth 401K.  It isn't good retirement preparation to withdraw early from a Roth IRA, but having the ability to in case you need it is an advantage. 2)  A Roth 401K has required minimum distributions starting at age 70.5, but a Roth IRA does not.  So if you want to save your most tax advantaged assets to use last or leave to your heirs, you can do so with a Roth IRA (of course you can convert a Roth 401K to Roth IRA to gain that benefit). 3) You can invest a Roth IRA in a wide range of possible forms or select low expense ratio funds from Vanguard etc. With a Roth 401K, you can only select from the investment choices pre selected by your employer.    I didn't mean to imply there is a big difference, just that the small differences tend to favor a Roth IRA when you are choosing between the two."

investing,3e2s6x,Negotiation,3,Tue Jul 21 14:52:18 2015 UTC,"Correct- Say a hedge fund invests in Japanese equities (actual stocks, not futures). You are a U.S. Investor. Let's say Japanese stocks are flat over the period and the yen appreciates by 2x against your home currency, the USD  If the fund is denominated in USD, you give the fund USD and they convert the USD to yen and buy Japanese stocks. After the period, you want to redeem. They sell stocks, get back the same amount of yen they started with, and then convert back to USD. Because the yen doubles in value, they get back twice the USD and you made 100% on your investment.  Now say the fund is denominated in euro. You have to convert your USD to euro and give to the fund. The fund converts to yen, buys Japanese stocks, etc. you redeem at the end of the period. They convert back to euro at JPY/EUR, you convert back to usd at EUR/usd - the euro exposure cancels and you are left with the 2x JPY appreciation.  Edit: note this is only valid if the fund is investing in stocks, futures for example don't carry currency exposure on the notional. Also many hedge funds hedge out currency risk explicitly, so you need to be conscious of this"

investing,3e2s6x,1assman,2,Tue Jul 21 19:05:21 2015 UTC,"Sure- so you don't have to post the full notional for a forward or futures contract, just some small margin (at most a couple percent of notional ).  So if you want to buy 100% of nav in currency hedged Japanese equities, you might buy something like 95% in stocks, buy futures for the remaining 5% (to save cash for the forward, only posting say 10% of that as margin), and then sell a forward with notional 95% nav (since the futures doesn't have fx exposure; and only posting some small % of that as margin). Then you have 100% of the nav in japanese equities,  0 in currencies,  and still a little free cash (you are using 95% + futures margin + forward margin)"

The share price is up 6% right now since the speculation ended and the stock doesn't seem to have a clear trend. The Japanese economy is still ""recovering"". Just way too many uncertainty/unfavorable indicators for me to think about buying this stock. Just my opinion though."

investing,3dxumd,purpl3_dinosaur,100,Mon Jul 20 12:44:36 2015 UTC,"Is PayPal really sustainable over the long term though? Hear me out.  Think about all of your internet purchases you've made over the past year. If you're like me you use eBay a lot less than you used to and instead use sites like amazon or walmart.com. PayPal's business model relies heavily on eBay and on getting retailers to accept their fees in order to add them to their sites.  But if you look at the current state of money processing programs, the cost are going down dramatically and soon I don't think it's impossible to imagine that they're going to be virtually free. Two examples of this already happening in the personal sector is with services like Venmo and Snapcash, which offer free and instant transfers of money.  I just think that PayPal soon won't be able to justify its high fees when much cheaper options become widely available.   Disclaimer I don't know a ton about the inner-workings of PayPal, and I am saying all of this as a consumer speculating on what I see from my own personal experience."

investing,3dxumd,tristanryan,3,Mon Jul 20 19:37:46 2015 UTC,"Okay I could agree with that, but what I think makes Paypal a risky investment over the long-term is the fact that I don't believe their product is superior to any of their major rivals.

I just think that PayPal soon won't be able to justify its high fees when much cheaper options become widely available.   I am sure they will adjust to the market.

PayPal, Google, Stripe, Amazon, and almost any other payment processor all charge the same entry level rate of 2.9% + $0.30  I am only familiar with PayPal and Stripe but I am assuming the rest also offer volume discounts. In the case of PayPal, you only need a monthly volume of $3,000+ to receive a rate of 2.5% + $0.30 and only $10,000+ for 2.2% + $0.30  None of the other merchant services have this easily accessible volume discount pricing.

Sure, they can get a Square reader or use Venmo, but these are not secure solutions.  Fraud is a HUGE issue (you can even ask PayPal in the early days) and real businesses can't rely on flimsy solutions.  They need secure, enterprise grade payment solutions and certain companies like PayPal and Stripe are considered best-in-class.    Transaction fees will probably decrease and put pressure on payment processors but in my opinion the market is just too massive still, and will continue to be for the coming decade."

I'll just use Amazon prices to get a price match at Target, Best Buy, Walmart, etc.    I like using PayPal as a buyer but would never use it as a seller."
investing,3dxumd,Put_It_All_On_Blck,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:22:20 2015 UTC,"I think the big issue is everyone is now fighting for a slice of the cardless payment pie, ranging from mobile companies like apple and samsung to your standard credit card companies.  Being the man in the middle is very profitable for the little amount of work they do, and anyone can jump into this field assuming they have the capital and reputation.  Paypal doesnt have the security of companies like boeing, intel, mcdonalds, etc. Where it will take decades or more to dethrone them. Obviously bitcoin lost its momentum and is no longer a contender, but the fact that it posed a threat to paypal in just a couple years is a reason why people should be wary of going long on paypal.  Im a bit biased though as I feel like paypal has shit support when things do go wrong, and wouldnt mind seeing the company go under, but I think my point still stands."

Is that something we're supposed to have here? I know we have Kickapoo, which is like Mountain Dew but more Malaysian, and founded earlier, and with less caffeine and more cane sugar.

In terms of ""Uber of X"" companies, I think MOST will have a tough time and really only exist today because its a bull market and capital is freely available.  If you look at the previous generation of marketplace businesses, i.e. Zillow, GrubHub, OpenTable, there are about a dozen interesting businesses that went public and are worth a lot of money.  My guess is that there will be a similar number of successful on-demand companies and the rest will go away.    Homejoy was very early to the category and went after a really, really tough problem.  It is typical in the venture business for most of your bets to not pan out.  Homejoy was actually a lot bigger than most of the on-demand start-ups around today, but ultimately it had a few issues: 1) too operationally intense, 2) legal issues with 1099 workers, 3) tough to manage huge base of cleaners whilst delivering quality service, 4) competitive space.

Bonds have averaged 3-4% through the last few years and the expectation is that rates will increase thus increasing returns.  Add in 20% equity allocation and performance slightly lower than historical averages is perfectly reasonable.

investing,3dy9r5,Laxman259,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:47:05 2015 UTC,"Here you go. I think the analysis in the paper relies a bit too much on the historical return record (the future is more uncertain, which they don't account for), but I like how they factor the current market valuation into the allocation decision. Certainly worth comparing their approach to a target date allocation.  Retirement Risk, Rising Equity Glidepaths, and Valuation-Based Asset Allocation, 2014, Michael Kitces and Wade Pfau  Executive Summary:  This research investigates two types of dynamic asset allocation strategies (predetermined equity glidepaths and valuation-based asset allocation) for retirees using U.S. historical data. We analyze fixed asset allocations, traditional declining equity glidepaths, rising equity glidepaths, accelerated traditional and rising glidepaths, valuation-based allocations tethered around a fixed allocation, and glide paths with valuation-based overlays. With U.S. historical data, it is difficult to beat a strategy which maintains a consistently high allocation to stocks (especially as measured by terminal median wealth), to the extent that a retiree’s risk tolerance allows for this, and subject to the caveat that high stock allocations cannot always be expected to do as well in the future. However, when we consider retirements beginning in varying valuation environments (as defined by the level of Robert Shiller’s cyclically-adjusted price earnings ratio relative to its then-current historical median), we find the potential for different dynamic allocation strategies to help retirees sustain higher spending levels with lower average stock allocations in certain situations. When retirements begin in overvalued market environments (which reflects the situation for new retirees today), an accelerated rising equity glidepath has shown much potential to provide downside risk protection for retirees by minimizing equity exposure when an adverse market event would have the greatest impact. In other valuation environments, historical worst-case scenario sustainable withdrawal rates were highest with valuation-based asset allocation strategies, which maintain a midrange average stock allocation but adjust higher or lower when markets are deemed undervalued or overvalued, respectively."

The intro chapters are the most useful, and free on that link.)  Two of the safest ways to start options trading is selling covered calls for profit/income (or to get a premium to get rid of a stock you no longer want) and selling cash-secured put options to buy stocks you want to own at a discount (depending on how you define ""discount).  You could spend a day learning this stuff, but unlike stock, options trading is not something I'd recommend just JUMPING right into.  Instead this is one of those times I highly recommend using a trading simulator (CBOE has a virtual trading platform capable of options trading...investopedia's can't do a lot of options trading).  Even if you don't actually start selling covered calls or cash-secured puts, you should spend the time practicing it.  Personally I like Fidelity's tools for browsing options chains (at minimum you want a good stock price probability calculator to figure out your chances of hitting or missing your strike price).  There's probably better out there though.  I unfortunately haven't found a good place to find historic option pricing data.  One good way to learn would have been to look back in time an option chain/volatility/etc, for a day, decide what your orders would have been for that week/month, then go see what the stock price was and how you'd come out.  All of the places that have that data seem to want to charge for it though.  =("

investing,3dyu5v,AbsolutBooth,7,Tue Jul 21 06:57:13 2015 UTC,"This is a very interesting one cause it is definitely going to create some major shifts in the next decade.  I see each of the effects you list as stones hitting the water.  There are innumerable ripple effects off of those.   Fun brainstorming time!  Decline of individual ownership = Aftermarket car modification market dries up.  End of parking garages and much smaller parking lots.  Cars will no longer need to spend the vast majority of their time idle.  They can be constantly spreading out to anticipate demand.  The first true ""Car sharing"" company will arise in a way that allows you to simply open the app and request a car at your front door in X minutes.  Large parking garages will then be converted to more usable space.  Less driving/ Much more efficient driving (and presumably more electric vehicles) = Fewer gas stations(especially in central locations as convenience no longer matters), less gas consumption, less maintenance and repair.  Result: Gas/Service stations close costing many jobs per city, but opening up very valuable land.  Bus, truck and taxi drivers are all unemployed.  Gas refining companies suffer.  Oil futures decline.  Middle East destabilizes even more, but the US no longer needs to care.  Fewer deaths / accidents = Insurance cost declines and likely becomes tied to the vehicle rather than a driver.  Less work for body shops.  Result: Insurance costs to manually drive (assuming its even allowed) will be prohibitive. Huge drop in lawsuits benefit the court system but cost thousands of lawyers/ insurance adjusters their jobs.  Other insurance lines likely increase in cost.  But more people survive, so that's nice.  Smaller Police forces = I hadn't really thought about this one before but it definitely makes sense.  Along with this comes less money from tickets (speeding, red light, DUI, parking, etc) so city revenues will take a hit.  Could mean that property or sales taxes will go up as the city tries to make up budget shortfalls.  It will certainly be interesting to see which companies make the most of it.  I doubt many of them exist right now.  Self driving cars are definitely going to be a revolution."

On one hand you have less need for a personal parking space so inner city living would be more attractive but on the other hand driving will be safer-->increased speed on highways-->can live far away from the city with the same commute time
investing,3dyu5v,pbnotorious,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:21:01 2015 UTC,"I always think about it from an inner city perspective (but that is just as much personal bias as anything else).  It definitely makes living a ways outside the city more attractive if you know that your commute will be the same everyday (vs currently where accidents and random traffic can cause tremendous variations).  Not only that, but one of the worst things about not living in-city is that it makes going out so much harder (i.e. don't want to have a few drinks then drive X miles).  I could certainly see it increasing sprawl but also increasing (or at least not hurting) the amount of business coming into the city."

investing,3dyu5v,twistedfunnyguytv,3,Tue Jul 21 18:15:17 2015 UTC,I hold XSD a semiconductor etf. Self driving cars are going to require a ton of processing power as well likely the ability to communicate wirelessly with a network.  This means powerful computer chips.  Texas Instruments is already making some of the processors behind the computer interfaces in existing vehicles.  Bonus is that a lot of self driving technology is/will crossover into drone market as well.
investing,3dyu5v,miscsubs,3,Mon Jul 20 18:05:32 2015 UTC,"A point I'd like to shed light on, from /u/backwoodsofcanada :   Oh man the self driving cars thing is just sickening.  For starters, that technology is way further off than a lot of people realize. Everyone's just jerking themselves off while imagining that conventionally controlled cars are going to be illegal by like 2020 and we'll all be getting shuffled around in these Google Apple Tesla automated bore machines like it's the Jetsons or something.  I live in a rural ass area. Half the roads around me are dirt roads, and more than half of them aren't mapped on any kind of GPS or Google Maps or anything, as far as technology is concerned they don't even exist. There are probably hundreds if not thousands of simular communities in North America alone, sure this might be fine on some big highway or in a city but out in the country the technology would simply just shit itself and not know what to do. We need driver controlled cars.  Then there's other issues that nobody ever brings up. Are these self driving Google cars going to be capable of driving in a blizzard? When there's two feet of snow on the road, you need to use your intuition, you need to use your familiarity with that road to know where the shoulders are and where the lines are and shit like that. In whiteout blizzard conditions a self driving car would shit itself, I mean you're not even supposed to use normal cruise control if there's snow on the road, how the fuck do they expect a fully self driving car to work?  And then there's the fact that for these self driving cars to actually be safe and successful, all the cars on the road are going to need to use the same technology and be able to communicate simultaneously. What would that mean? All normal cars are suddenly illigal? What about classic and historical cars? What about motorcycles? And, while the sports car market is small, it must be at least reasonably big, otherwise things like SRT and M Division and AMG and Corvettes and all that other great stuff wouldn't be able to exist, they wouldn't make cars like that if they didn't turn some kind of profit or sell at all. Those people will not give up their cars without some kind of fight. Plus there's all the other automotive hobbies out there, they'd basically need to outlaw things like classic cruisers or run whatcha brung drag racing or rock crawling Jeeps, all that stuff would get its ""street legal"" title stripped.  And then we have countries like India and Russia where their traffic situation is just a cluster fuck free for all, it would probably take generations to stomp out the issues that those kinds of places have before they could even consider standardizing self driving cars over there.  I know I'm probably preaching to the choir here, but this is just a huge pet peeve of mine lately on reddit. I mean the technology isn't just around the corner, it's still several decades away at best, there are a ton of issues with the whole concept that people are just straight up ignoring, if you bring any of those issues up you just get bombarded with people telling you to go back to the 18th century, and of course if you ever even have the audacity to say that you actually enjoy driving cars and having car related hobbies you're literally the bane of the human race and are holding back our technological advancements... man its just a piss off, all it is is a bunch of nerds wanting to jerk off and read comic books every day on their daily commute instead of actually driving. I'll admit that boring ass traffic would be a nice time to have a self driving car, but the concept of having all cars being self driving cars is just basically not going to happen any time soon.  If I said that whole speel on a defult I would get my ass handed to me by a giant blue downwards pointing arrow."
investing,3dyu5v,nuovo_donna,2,Mon Jul 20 22:48:26 2015 UTC,"Aside from economic barriers and feasibility, the technology is also not quite there.  First - I'm sure a lot of you read about the Google photo app's blunder. It marked black people in pictures as apes. Most blamed this to the training algorithm being incomplete or unsuitable, but there's something deeper than that. We are quite far from understanding perception and cognition. If a simple app, which I'm quite sure has been trained on at least multiple black faces cannot distinguish a person from an animal, how are we sure a moving vehicle in outside conditions will distinguish important objects, or signs, or someone signaling ""slow down?""  Google's cars are doing great in a controlled environment but I really don't think we can program a computer to do something we don't quite understand that easily.  For what it is worth, one of my professors in college (waaay back) is a pioneer in computer vision and I recently came across one of his talks. He didn't talk about self driving cars but did talk about how much more we, as humans, have to learn about us, the human minds. He thought our computer overlords were not near ready yet to take over."

Look at the success of pilot programs with self driving cars in the wild.   As for blizzards and dirt roads, those are edge cases (in the US at least) and the obstacles will be overcome in the future."
investing,3dyu5v,nuovo_donna,2,Tue Jul 21 00:05:45 2015 UTC,"While I appreciate a good nay saying as much as the next person, there are some rational answers to these objections:   rural areas   Most people don't live in rural USA, and ever year it seems that less do.  People have been migrating back to cities for years now.  So even if the technology never makes it out to the rural areas it will still have enormous economic effects in the areas where it is practical.   classic cars, and carophiles.   I don't expect owner piloted cars to become illegal any time soon.  I do anticipate that in any urban area it will eventually become economically infeasible to own them for a lot of people.  As it becomes apparent that owner/pilots are creating most of the accidents (if not almost all of them) then insurance rates are going to multiply for those who want to drive themselves.  They'll have to.  More people will try and go naked, and LE will up their game and be able to tell remotely that an uninsured driver is piloting their car.  Then, they'll lose their license to drive and one less pilot on the road.  States might well impose higher than traditional registration, and sales taxes to purchase and legally drive conventional cars.  As services and repair places start going out of businesses then prices will likely rise for those that remain due to lack of competition.  It's simply going to become too much of a hassle for people to want to self drive, in the same way that it's currently too much of a hassle for people who live in cities like NYC to own their own cars.  Some do, and some always will, but it's a hassle and an expensive luxury.  While it might be true that full saturation could take decades, I expect major moves to happen faster than that and it will accelerate.   developing nations   I doubt they'll be able to jump on it the same way that they for example jumped on cell phones.  This tech requires well developed and fairly standardized infrastructure which they lack whereas cells actually permitted them to skip a lot of infrastructure improvements.   But what does this objection have to do with the US?  We have hundreds of millions of cars here currently."
investing,3dyu5v,bobskizzle,3,Tue Jul 21 00:53:22 2015 UTC,"Actually insurance wouldn't rise, it would lower as the propensity of even bad drivers to wreck would be lowered at least indirectly. The direct costs wouldn't increase unless the self driving cars are obscenely expensive or something. Remember insurance is just risk of insurable events * cost of those events + profit margin. That equation won't change because of these cars."
investing,3dyu5v,investinggoals,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:44:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure their likelihood of wrecking would go down.  Things might be more predictable, and to some degree autonomous cars might be able to make up for some of the careless failures of pilots by avoiding collisions.  But I think the ultimate goal would be for traffic pace to increase as well as traffic density.  Faster traffic together with the same paced brains will be a tough playground."
investing,3dyu5v,garf22,2,Tue Jul 21 04:27:49 2015 UTC,"Definitely true, however that's really a regulatory change (which would be welcome) that would necessitate higher standards for manual driver's licensure."
investing,3dwzzs,chrisgelb,155,Mon Jul 20 05:59:58 2015 UTC,"Trueish. First you dream of flying. Then you look for the right airplane and find that there's nothing quite right in the market. So you borrow and beg for every penny to build a sub $100,000 supersonic personal jet. You create a chart showing that the market for this is only slightly smaller than the market for hamburgers.   When you have enough money for the prototype sans engine, you push it all off the edge of the cliff and build as fast as you can. Friends see you falling and think, ""man that looks so much cooler than my job."" They happily jump and start building.   Shortly, realizing you had no concept of the enormity of the task, you start screaming ""help"". Strange men wearing impossibly crisp blue button downs and khakis, with perfect hair, who have no actual experience creating a successful company, will start complimenting you on how smart you were to use the radically new ""Agile Cliff methodology. They follow you down in very nice business jets and start shouting strange chants with obscure opaque language that will supposedly summon great fountains of money. All you have to do is put a drop of blood on the contract, give up 51% of your company, 3 of 5 board seats and agree to use half the money to buy products you don't understand and aren't ready for from their ""portfolio companies. With the blood and signature they move you into a building with 10 other companies falling at slower rate. You now have 12 months til death. And they tell you to stave off death for another year you need to stop working on the plane in six months and go out hat in hand begging for 10x as much money at a 10x valuation.   Nine of the ten companies hit the ground hard. The living fall into one of three categories: 1 H1B visa violators, thrown immediately out of the U.S., 2. Deeply depressed normal folk who sleep for two years and wonder why the fuck did I leave my solid job in accounting to work with these dipshits? 3. The executive staff who are proudly complimented on how elegantly they hit the ground. The blue shirts assure these folks that, ""we invest in teams, in people. One little failure just put you much closer to success. Call us with your next idea.   The one company that doesn't hit the ground has piles of software they will never need and one prototype plane that technically does fly, but the features necessary to bring it to market are cheaper to get by buying the leading competitor in the space.  You still have a million bucks in the bank and enough gas to stay aloft for nine months. You're fucked, until your sleazy partner says, ""we did not fail. Once we understood the space better we decided that there is a greater need for an airplane crash video app. As of this moment I decree us the leading predictor of cliff jumping deaths and airplane crash videos for new media. He holds up the contract he just signed with his Aunt's knitting blog for being sole supplier of death and dismemberment content for the entire knitting world. After an excruciating pause everyone around the table agrees that a ""pivot"" sounds much better than saying, ""we were naive and stupid and failed completely. But we are immensely smarter than we were.   Bizarrely the Pivot press release gets picked up by ten times as many tech rags as even heard of your first attempt. They use the word pivot awkwardly and endlessly in such an ungainly fashion that you realize that they are too young to have seen the Friends episode where Ross moves a couch. If they had seen it they would never have said the word again.   And the true entreupeneur begins to climb that cliff again. Because he knows he is Syssiphus with better ideas and the laptop he stole as he left the plane. ""For I will jump again, I have no choice, it is who I am.""  Tl;dr Most Entreupeneurs are naive and foolish and fail painfully. Occasionally one sort of succeeds and gets great press coverage. One out of every 100,000 succeeds so fabulously that it makes the whole category of work look incredibly cool. But you are a nerd and should never listen when told you are cool."

investing,3dwzzs,nkohari,20,Mon Jul 20 15:04:51 2015 UTC,"I've co-founded two startups (one acquired) and was CTO of a third.  If you are feeling pessimistic about this company, do not commit to it. It's normal to feel trepidation, but ""giving in to optimism"" is not good enough. When my wife and I started our first company, we had a conversation where I said:   This can't be something we talk each other into doing. If we do this, it has to be because we both believe in it.   If you feel like you're being cajoled or convinced, say no. It doesn't matter that these are your friends. Don't commit to something because you're afraid to let them down. If they get upset, too bad for them.  A huge part of starting a company is convincing the market that you have something valuable, and if you aren't fully convinced yourself, that's going to be incredibly difficult.  That said, it's good to know what the challenges are, but staying completely focused on them is a dangerous path that ends up leading you in circles. I think entrepreneurs need to have a healthy dose of naïvety. You have to be able to believe that against all odds and despite all competition, you will be successful. You'll never win a race if all you see are the hurdles.  Anyhow, if you do decide to commit to the company, I would offer two pieces of advice:   Make absolutely certain that all of your co-founders are in at the same level of risk. (Or, at least their equity stake in the business should match the risk they're taking and the work they're putting in, and everyone is comfortable with what everyone has.) Be sure that each founder has a well-defined role, and that any overlaps between skill sets are compatible.   For example, if one founder is going to keep their day job just because they have a family and a mortgage, but another founder is going to quit and work on the startup full-time, the former should have less equity than the latter. Otherwise the founder who is living on ramen and Cheeto dust is going to end up despising the person with the full-time job.  About role clarity, when there's a clear overlap in skills, agree on who is in charge of what, or how you will mitigate any disagreements. The hierarchy that exists in well-established companies won't be there to make the decisions for you, so you'll have to work it out amongst yourselves. Everyone needs to be able to have mature, sensible discussions about difficult topics.  Hope all that is useful. Feel free to PM me if I can help."
investing,3dwzzs,hmbemis,4,Mon Jul 20 11:39:19 2015 UTC,That is very insightful! Even though I haven't shared any details of this project it seemed like you clearly understood my situation and every point you have written just hits the bulls eye. How is that possible? Thanks so much for offering your time for a PM I would absolutely like to learn from you. I will definitely PM you I just need to gather my thoughts to keep it concise.
investing,3dwzzs,LateralThinkerer,5,Mon Jul 20 13:00:03 2015 UTC,"I agree it can be true, but I disagree it is always true.  There are plenty of entrepreneurs who do not risk their ruin by taking the leap.  They either have reserves, an available backup, or some other mid-plan escape to allow some sort of recovery or softer landing.  There are also plenty of entrepreneurs who start their flights from the ground... or begin assembling long before they're ready to leap."
investing,3dwzzs,walloon5,2,Mon Jul 20 16:46:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm up for jumping off cliff and building my plane on the way down but let me bring my parachute first. I remember an African proverb, ""Only a fool will test the waters with both feet."""
investing,3dwzzs,13speed,3,Tue Jul 21 00:58:58 2015 UTC,"Occasionally one sort of succeeds and gets great press coverage. One out of every 100,000 succeeds so fabulously that it makes the whole category of work look incredibly cool. But you are a nerd and should never listen when told you are cool.   Or should at least understand the concept of survivorship bias."
investing,3dwzzs,jaebigdong,2,Mon Jul 20 14:52:39 2015 UTC,"I know of an engine inventor type who was working on efficiency, formerly was an IT guy. Sold everything, sold his house, didn't save for his daughters college (he was an older gent) - spent her college money on his invention. It was a good idea, I think it had something to do with adding water vapor or urea(!) something strange like that to diesel engines - which I think is an actual real thing.   He did have patents, and a working prototype is my understanding, but passed away before he could recoup all of his costs... Sort of a sad tale for his family.  I think entrepreneurship is really hard, and I wish you luck. See if you can find a place to share space and costs and ideas with other entrepreneurs.  Probably the hard part is making your ideas work and getting some paying customers."
investing,3dwzzs,Planning4growth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:59:08 2015 UTC,"Small quantities of diesel exhaust fluid (DEF, purified Urea) are injected into the exhaust upstream of a catalyst, where it vaporizes and decomposes to form ammonia and carbon dioxide.   Just recently adopted for the US market, Europe has had DEF motors for years now. The ammonia is the desired product which in conjunction to the SCR catalyst, converts the NOx to harmless nitrogen and water."

investing,3dwzzs,moumouren,2,Mon Jul 20 19:17:31 2015 UTC,"I'm relatively young (27) and started my own company when I was 25 with 3 other people, maybe I can shed some light on my experience. Starting a company with others is basically like getting married to them without the sex benefits. Everyone will have their own opinion on how things should go, and it will strain on your relationships. Imagine there is a boat, who is going to steer it? Everyone? There may be times that people will feel like they are putting in more work then others and that isn't a fun issue to deal with. Who is going to do what, how do you hold them accountable? How will the company be split up? what happens when there is a disagreement? What happens when one person wants out? These are things that need to be decided before you get too far into the project, it is much more difficult to decide these things down the road....Are you comfortable asserting yourself when others have a strong feeling to go one way with a company but you don't think that's the right choice? This will happen.   Yes, I agree, part of it is making a dive and having faith in what you're doing. But I think it is more of a calculated dive... Have a plan, an Operating Agreement. Fully describe what will happen in every possible event that could ever arise during the lifetime of  your company. Starting a project is hard work, keeping the path and everyone on the same page is even harder when you have multiple people driving the boat.   Best of Luck."
investing,3dwzzs,lxr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:58:15 2015 UTC,This is so true. Everything you said is already happening at this point in our project. Balancing a good interpersonal relations while maintaining boundaries I have never thought would require a lot of skill to cultivate. But I have seen it as a good practice of maturity and discovering how to best interact with people on a business level. It's a good learning process all in all.
investing,3dwzzs,Franks2000inchTV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:54:14 2015 UTC,"No doubt, you will learn a lot! The experience you will gain will be priceless, just be smart about what you're getting in to, and have an exit plan in case it goes south.   Best of Luck."
investing,3dwzzs,Hanshen,4,Tue Jul 21 14:29:22 2015 UTC,"It is in every conceivable way. With small businesses you're starting from the bottom up with an arbitrary goal, without any meaningful way to quantize what you set out to achieve. You're basically running on hope. With a big business, or at least an SME in a dominant local position, you can say with reasonable certainty that we'll make X dollars on Y date. With a small business you're at the mercy of the business gods, e.g. big retailer moving in and draining demand, economic crisis sapping the pockets of your would-be customers, fire started two blocks down blocking the street, bad publicity from unrelated event halfway around the world, Paypal blocking your account for 90 days, etc. Ever heard stories of Greek mortals trying to defeat the gods of Mount Olympus? It's not an inaccurate representation. With business, it's more about luck and persistence than it is about actual finance.  You hear a lot about the heroes who survived; you never hear about those who died in vain. Dead men tell no tales."
investing,3dwzzs,stanwal,2,Mon Jul 20 06:31:25 2015 UTC,"I think nowadays it is for sure. But soon, the more successful entrepreneurs will show that there is a lot more process, design process, that can lead to results other than wildly guessing at the next 'big app'. And I think then it will more closely resemble building a few different planes and jumping off a cliff and picking which one flies the best."
investing,3dwzzs,mayola29,2,Mon Jul 20 06:59:40 2015 UTC,"It is entirely accurate, except that I would add ""and you don't know if you have all the right parts until you build it."""
investing,3dwzzs,risingstars,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:46:17 2015 UTC,"There is quite a lot of literature regarding effectual thinking that certainly backs up this sort of approach.   Of course in reality you need a mix between testing things as you go along and being open to change, and effective planning. The difficulty is finding a balance between both these things. In other words to try to not get bogged down entirely with your plan to the detriment of adaptability, and similarly to not rush into something in a foolhardy manner."
investing,3dwzzs,zenwarrior01,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:22:08 2015 UTC,I suppose this is true because youll never really know what's gonna happen with your business.
investing,3e0bb6,B_Witt,6,Mon Jul 20 23:44:46 2015 UTC,"DO NOT invest with the ELP. You will pay sales loads on the American Funds products of 5% or more, as well as ongoing fees that are far too high, resulting in poor performance. Go to Vanguard, or even Schwab or Fidelity and purchase low-fee index-tracking ETFs or mutual funds. You can do it. Don't let the ELP scare you into thinking it's too difficult for a novice to handle with just a little learning.  Ramsey's personal finance advice is generally good. But his investing advice is so bad it makes me angry."
investing,3e0bb6,FreeCashFlow,2,Tue Jul 21 01:13:48 2015 UTC,"My common sense told me that it would probably cost more than it is worth. I'm not an expert, but I think I am pretty smart and good with numbers (I'm an Engineer), so I figured I could do it myself.   I doubt that their advice would result in a 5% increase over my own choices, so ultimately I'd lose money with their fees and all that.   Thanks fo the input."
investing,3e0bb6,JonnyHall,2,Tue Jul 21 01:20:59 2015 UTC,I doubt that their advice would result in a 5% increase over my own choices   Its worse than that. Actively managed funds have 2% expense ratios and average practically zero returns in the long run.
investing,3dymsa,ineedsleep_,6,Mon Jul 20 16:29:14 2015 UTC,I'm curious how people like Robinhood comparatively
investing,3dymsa,whenmattsattack,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:34:50 2015 UTC,So far I've found Robinhood pretty sufficient for trading infrequently and with investments that you don't mind t+3 settlement dates.
investing,3dymsa,Jeffrey_Forbes,2,Mon Jul 20 17:06:31 2015 UTC,"I hate the 3 day delay, but not badly enough to pay commissions elsewhere. Don't really mind the lack of research etc because it's not like a broker is going to give me more than I can get between Bloomberg and Factset at work anyway. I'm praying they export transactions cleanly at tax-time."
investing,3dymsa,josiahstevenson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:23:04 2015 UTC,The ordering process is obnoxious. Market orders tend to always go for higher than what they display the price as. Sometimes lower. The net value charting is nice. The charts for stocks could be vastly improved.  Can't complain because it's free.
investing,3dymsa,shill2u4mehehe,3,Mon Jul 20 18:18:44 2015 UTC,I use limit orders based on pricing and bid asks from elsewhere anyway.

investing,3dymsa,shill2u4mehehe,2,Mon Jul 20 18:16:23 2015 UTC,"I have a IRA/Roth IRA and a trading account with Merrill edge, I am quite happy with it. I get 40 free trades a month and it supports a lot of Vanguard funds as well.   As I also have Bank of America account, its super easy to transfer funds back and forth."
investing,3dymsa,teshindaflesh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:50:25 2015 UTC,"I opened a ROTH with Merrill edge but for some reason I can't buy VTI or any of the vaguard etfs I want to. Which ones do you have in  your portfolio?   Also, will you transfer to vanguard later on so that you don't have to pay commission for each trade you make?"
investing,3dymsa,wolfshirtx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:58:30 2015 UTC,"Weird, I can find VTI and looks like I am able to submit a trade to purchase it. I did not actually go through the motion of purchasing it so I don't know how relevant our experiences are.    http://imgur.com/RoEDs5V  I don't have any ETFs in my portfolio but I have the following mutual funds in my portfolio.  VEIPX  VGHCX  VHDYX  VISVX  VWESX  The commission is bad but not tooo bad - ~$20 a vanguard trade... But I am ok with it as I don't usually short.  I have seen an average of 26% growth between the five mutual funds over the last four years so I am not too worried about the commission, I load 3-5000k into each fund once a year and I have not pulled any money out yet. The convenience of all my investments being in once place makes it easy for me to manage them."
investing,3dymsa,teshindaflesh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:55:52 2015 UTC,"Oh interesting, I may have been doing something wrong then. I have a self directed roth IRA if that matters. I've been thinking about switching to vanguard so I dont have to pay fees on vanguard ETFs but the minimum is what is stopping me. May i ask why you are invested in mutual funds over index funds?"
investing,3dymsa,wolfshirtx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:05:05 2015 UTC,"It's totally a personal preference... I know all the research out there shows that index funds usually out perform mutual funds, here are the reasons why I choose Mutual funds.    I feel a level of comfort that someone is actively buying/selling The expense ratio is less than .2% Rated as 4-5 out of 5 on Morning star   Once again, its totally a personal preference."

investing,3dymsa,teshindaflesh,2,Tue Jul 21 18:24:09 2015 UTC,I use tradeking and it's working out fine.  I trade 20-40 per year. so not that much.
investing,3dymsa,investinggoals,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:32:34 2015 UTC,"Something like Robinhood is fine for the very casual investor.  For anything more substantial, I would recommend the major platforms like Fidelity, TDAmeritrade, or Schwab.  Using these platforms will ensure decent liquidity.  What I mean by that is sometimes it can be hard to find certain securities on other platforms.  There may not be enough shares to short of a particular stock, or you may not be able to buy certain stocks altogether.  Also, international trading can get tricky with smaller platforms.   If you're actually day trading, then you will want more sophisticated tools.  That is probably a topic for another post.    Hope this helps."
