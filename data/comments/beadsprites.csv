They are available at most any craft store (I get mine at Michael's) or hardware store; they are essentially very long wooden sticks that you can cut to whatever size you need. I have some photos of the only big stands I have made, one without a dowel and the other with one. I find the taller the piece is you need the dowels, otherwise you should be fine; my one without a dowel doesn't fall over. Hope this is helpful."

But even so, I'm pretty sure OP isn't even the person running the Instagram they linked to.  They are just sharing something cool they found, which is pretty relevant to this sub.  What's the problem?"
beadsprites,3e0zkf,Klovar,6,Tue Jul 21 03:04:00 2015 UTC,"Just be careful ordering from China. If you get off-brand beads, they sometimes are very poor quality and won't melt together with other beads. Most of us buy from eksuccessbrands. If you buy more than 6 bags at a time they are $1.99 per bag, and they often have 20-25% off coupons. They also offer free shipping over $60."
beadsprites,3e0zkf,FancyPhalanges,3,Tue Jul 21 05:14:02 2015 UTC,"If you're just starting out, I wouldn't recommend the Chinese bead route. There's a lot of inconsistencies with the beads, and that's if they even send you the right colors. I've seen many instances where people ordered those big mix orders and got several colors missing, duplicates of other colors, etc.   Just go with Perler in a big mix bucket or a bunch of singles. Can't go wrong there."
beadsprites,3e0zkf,Jandrem,2,Tue Jul 21 17:38:11 2015 UTC,"Sweet. Thanks for sharing your experience and advice with me. I'll be messing around with a 16 color 4K starter kit tomorrow, once Amazon delivers it. :)"
beadsprites,3e0zkf,crimsonfrog,2,Tue Jul 21 18:59:07 2015 UTC,Perler stuff from Amazon is good too. I don't recommend buying beads from Walmart. I have not heard good things about those beads.
beadsprites,3e0zkf,crimsonfrog,2,Tue Jul 21 19:21:56 2015 UTC,"I agree, don't order from china. I get all of my beads from either eksuccessbrands.com or I go to my local michaels craft store or Jo-ann fabrics. Though I prefer to order from eksuccessbrands because it is cheaper. The quality is much better and the beads melt evenly and I only get about one defective bead per 20k. I have been doing this for about a year now and I really love it. I prefer smaller projects to bigger ones, just because it is easier to iron. If you are just starting out in the world of perler beads, I would suggest checking out videos from youtube.com and also subscribing to r/beadsprites, if you arent already. Feel free to ask me questions anytime, my inbox is always open. I will try to help as much as I can. Have fun!"
beadsprites,3e1lwy,erinncart,3,Tue Jul 21 06:50:21 2015 UTC,"If you are looking for easy, any NES or SNES game really is fantastic for getting sprites, you can copy them right out of the games. Go to google and search "" 'x' perler"" (x being your item you want to make) and there should be a ton of projects in images. If you can't think of anything just google images ""perler projects"" there will be even more things to choose from. Hope this helps you out, good luck."

beadsprites,3dz9zu,KungFuKao,3,Mon Jul 20 19:10:09 2015 UTC,"When we did it we did raise the price by a bit, but we judged it per type of piece and eventually adjusted pieces we noticed weren't selling.  The 60/40 seemed pretty standard from the places we talked to, we were able to talk one place into doing 70/30, which was nice.  We decided to sell at 2 different places and neither of them made a tremendous amount of sales per month so keeping up the stock wasn't a real issue.  At the same time, neither really catered to a nerdy crowd, they were more so just craft shops, so you'd have a leg up on us there. We did it for a few months but to make the profit margin we wanted it ended up not being worth the time, it became a chore and we stopped enjoying it.  I think we ended up making like 60-100 bucks per month  for the 5-6 months, which included Christmas time, between the 2 shops.  So it all depends on what your time is worth and how much you have.  The semi-passive income was nice, just didnt hold up for us.  One boardgame shop bought a large amount/vareity of stuff from us at a ""wholesale"" price we agreed on (I think it was $50 store credit and $100 cash).  This was by far the best experience we had with a third party seller.  If you can talk the shop owner into something like this, I would recommend it.   Removes the risk from you, and he can tell you if he ever wants more.  We took a hit in the profit per piece but made up for it in volume and knowing it was already money in our pocket."

beadsprites,3dwr58,Bgoodfinger,2,Mon Jul 20 06:28:11 2015 UTC,"What's the tape for exactly? I use parchment paper and trays, and I just hold the tray flat so they don't fall off... Maybe I don't understand the question."
beadsprites,3dwr58,InvincibleAgent,3,Mon Jul 20 08:25:55 2015 UTC,"The tape is for people who prefer to do ""flat melt"" typically. Flat melt requires a lot of heat for a longer period and has a higher chance of warping a board. Also, when flat ironing, the beads wont seal shut all the way (in my experience) on a board. So you remove the beads with tape and iron them that way."
beadsprites,3dwr58,BloodyBenton,2,Mon Jul 20 13:08:03 2015 UTC,"I've tried scrubbing with a bristle brush, using various 'sticky remover products', using various kitchen cleaning products, scraping with knives and scissors, soaking in hot and cold water - with and without detergent.  Never been able to completely get everything off.  Some people recommend painters tape and I think I'm going to try that next."

beadsprites,3dwr58,herswansong,2,Mon Jul 20 12:56:41 2015 UTC,"I will typically take the tape off before I'm done ironing while its still hot, this leaves the residue warm and easier to just wipe off with the non-stick side of the tape I just removed. Failing that I saw some one mention GooGone, I used to use this at work and can attest that it will take off just about any stuck on crud."
beadsprites,3dwr58,BloodyBenton,2,Mon Jul 20 13:10:25 2015 UTC,"Goo Gone should work as someone else said. I had a problem with tape residue and I just switched brands of tape and I got it from a different store. I think the problem was the tape being old or stored incorrectly. If/when you buy more, I suggest buying it from a hardware place or somewhere that sells a lot of tape so the stock is always fresh. I got my bad tape from a local craft place."

beadsprites,3dfmy0,nave10pikmin,4,Wed Jul 15 22:05:42 2015 UTC,"Never would I have thought that I would get so upset over the death of a person I did not even know. But, the contributions to the world given by this man have made my life so far. Mr. Iwata would wake me up in the mornings for nintendo directs, make me wait outside of the Target at 5 am for a useless plastic amiibo toy. The best times in my life are spent playing nintendo with my friends and family. So with heavy hearts as fans we let Mr. Iwata go. We will miss the great times he gave us and the dumb please understand and directly to you jokes that we love so much. Rest in Piece Satoru Iwata. The 3ds game is for scale, and the white bar along the top is made from half clear beads and glow in the dark beads, when put in the dark it shows 1959 - 2015.  I shot a video of making this sprite, but I don't have much skill in video editing and I need to first find a way to edit the parts together and speed it up into a time lapse, if anyone has any tips, feel free to let me know.

beadsprites,3dcgdk,Castbros,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:16:41 2015 UTC,"I believe it mostly helps with the flat melt method. It provides ventilation so that the beads fully close when ironing. If you do not poke holes you can get inconsistent results, which would ruin the look of the flat melt."

I shrank a few screenshots to get some ideas, but most of them were at least partially or mostly obscured by the player character or the environment.  So I kind of winged a sprite in paint.net and then further tweaked it as I was beading.

beadsprites,3d5ohk,KoriJ2012,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:50:37 2015 UTC,I use the Rowena travel sized iron. It's a lot lighter than the standard iron but still heats up pretty quickly. Obviously it will take longer to iron projects out but my wrist wasn't a fan of the hulk of an iron I was using previously.   http://www.amazon.com/Rowenta-Travel-Ready-Stainless-Soleplate-1000-Watt/dp/B001RNOQIQ  I tend to hard/flat iron my projects so if I'm already spending ages ironing I may as well save my wrist some grief. It has a nice smooth point at the top which is super handy for sealing the holes and getting smaller sections.   The larger rowenta irons are amazing as well but they are far more expensive and honestly way more you would ever need.   A friend of mine uses this one and has had it for years and loves it.   http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B001RJTQ8U/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?qid=1436923174&sr=8-2&pi=AC_SY200_QL40&keywords=retro+iron&dpPl=1&dpID=41KyGl1tMNL&ref=plSrch

beadsprites,3d1c51,heartsbrand,3,Sun Jul 12 18:37:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you. For me, the biggest thing was finding the right temp on my iron. The one I own is an ancient GE one from the 80s.  Most of the suggestions I see say that you should start on a low heat and work your way up, but I've been cranking mine almost all the way up. When I was doing it on a lower heat only certain colors were melting and only after a couple minutes of smoothing the sprite over with the iron.  They start melting evenly around 10 seconds in and it's just about applying even pressure all the way around on the highest setting. The first couple times I got a couple of dents from pushing too hard in different spots, but if you just keep it even you should be good.  Practice, dialing your iron in, and the tape method are the three biggest factors. Just make sure that you punch a hole for every bead in the tape so the heat can vent or you'll end up with holes and bleeding in your sprite"
beadsprites,3d1c51,adderyn,2,Sun Jul 12 18:52:27 2015 UTC,So how you did it was put it on the highest setting and put even pressure? How long did you iron it for in total?
beadsprites,3d1c51,Scratchums,3,Sun Jul 12 22:14:07 2015 UTC,Yes. It usually only takes a minute. No more than two.
beadsprites,3d1c51,paul-jenkins,2,Sun Jul 12 23:01:19 2015 UTC,Oh.  I didn't realize this was a thing.  When I was little and my mom ironed my projects she would always do it this way and I'd get upset because she'd just melt them out of shape.  But apparently you can get a sweet spot going.  Neat.

beadsprites,3d1c51,paul-jenkins,8,Sun Jul 12 19:35:56 2015 UTC,"Just so you guys are aware, use parchment paper. Wax paper melts from the ironing and may be the reason for wrinkles."

The paper that comes with the perler boards and bead jar always gives me creases with a flat fuse. The Reynolds stuff comes as a roll and not folded up in a little square. As long as I make sure it's flush against the beads I don't get the creases.

Each pixel is carefully placed, and scaling down would probably lose that detail.  In your sprite, for example, look at Slash's face. Chin: 1 pixel thin, mouth outline: 1px, teeth: 1px, mouth outline: 1px, cheek: 2px, mask: 2px, eyes: 1px, mask: 1px, forehead: 1px.  You can't shrink any of that without losing proportionality or content."

beadsprites,3clqyh,Zotaku,2,Wed Jul 8 22:04:35 2015 UTC,"I would say it depends on method.  If you want the beaded look, usually you'd want the iron set to a nice middle range, just enough so you don't fully melt the beads.  If you want the full melt look, crank that baby to the max.  That's the only way I do it and that has been the best result.  And I will say, masking tape method isn't that bad when your used to it.  Just flip the design before you start and bam!  It's in the orientation you wanted.  It's an easier method plus when you get good at it, you can do projects that are larger then the amount of boards you have or your workspace."

beadsprites,3clqyh,mouka,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:44:58 2015 UTC,"Depends on how big the sprite is. I keep it on low for smaller sprites, but I turn it all the way up for bigger ones.

I haven't made a ton so far, but here's what I have made:  • NES Mega Man  • NES Needle Man  • Jiji the cat (Kiki's Delivery Service)  and my favorite so far,   • Set of 4 coasters with cork board backing of Adventure Time characters Finn, Jake, B-MO, and Princess Bubblegum. These were a housewarming gift for my friends who just moved into their new home.

Have you had any issues with it? Maybe I will do a tutorial of it next time."
beadsprites,3ckydv,BravesB,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:54:54 2015 UTC,"It was a little tricky to get the hang of and I sort of combined techniques I saw in multiple videos explaining how to do the masking tape way. But I feel so much better once they're on the tape now because I have much more freedom with the iron.  As beginner's luck would have it, I didn't have any issues my first time trying it. But then on my second attempt (one of the coasters) I accidentally let the tape slip from my fingers as I was trying to place it and it fell down and grabbed a portion of the beads. So I had to pull it up and use my tweezers to grab them off the tape and place them back on the pegboard. This happened like three more times on the same sprite, lol. Don't know what it was about that time, I just had butter fingers I guess.   I did learn that after completing the sprite on the board, it's good to go around the image with a tool of sorts (I used a simple toothpick) to push the rows and columns of beads as close together as possible before laying down the tape. That way the melt will be as straight and even as possible since once the tape is holding it, there really is no way for the beads to move around. I picked up that tip from one tutorial on YouTube and it helped the creation look a little better. I also ended up using that toothpick to poke the holes in the masking tape which is absolutely necessary or else the beads will get air bubbles trapped in them while ironing and it will look bad. I didn't learn this from personal experience, just heeded the advice of everyone else who had made the mistake before me.  tl;dr: Overall, no major issues with the method other than my own inability to hold the tape well enough that one time it kept slipping from my fingers."

beadsprites,3cg8v6,Bgoodfinger,4,Wed Jul 8 12:42:47 2015 UTC,True. There were a lot of concerns about doing this as a team. A couple of strategies that worked really well for us were:   build a cardboard wall around the table to catch beads leave enough space around the table so that people could move freely without hitting the table with their legs or their chairs working with less colours = less chance for error most of our team members filled in the colours. We only had a few team members doing the outlines. do the outlines first. it allows more people to fill the rest of the image

beadsprites,3cgr2h,Player4our,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:02:38 2015 UTC,You can find them all with a simple search.  Now to decide which one to do first...
beadsprites,3ciipe,kinyutaka,2,Wed Jul 8 04:24:28 2015 UTC,"I did a little bit of research on this with the idea that I would offset the cost of my hobby so that I could continue making stuff without draining my bank account every month.  Really, the (admittedly hypothetical) conclusions I reached were as follows:   Pendants are probably the way to go. The idea being you wait until you've done a couple big pieces and then use the spares to put together some small pendents that you could probably sell for about $3-$8 depending on venue and subject. They require so few beads and they plates are so cheap this is you best bang-for-buck deal. A decent profit can be pulled from single boards for about $25 but again, this is totally dependent on venue and subject. You might be able to do some video gamey stuff and sell it on etsy for that much, but just keep expectations realistic because you're asking people to pay a pretty hefty chunk of change for a novelty with a picture that's going to be bordering on the super-niche, depending on what you do. By contrast, your average street art vendor will sell prints the same size for a third of the price and be a zillion times more accessible and the time:production ratio is wildly different so it becomes a lot more sustainable. If you're really doing this solely for profit the, again, I think it's important to manage your expectations. Your best bet is to do it for fun, first, then see if you can find some place where you can advertise assembly of the things and then what you could do is set up deals with people who don't have the free time to buy the pieces for you and then you bill for the time after you're done at a fair rate. Again, finding someone who would be willing to pay you even minimum wage for a project that could take hundreds of hours is going to be a very, very unlikely scenario, so I'd go ahead and propose whatever you want to charge for, but don't be surprised when they suddenly aren't as interested in having a pixel hobby piece when you quote them $1200 for a 15-board piece. Realistically, people will probably bite for closer to 1-2 bucks an hour.   It all comes down to finding a market, which really isn't going to be easy. Most of the perler vendors are making small pieces with a couple hundred beads that take relatively no time to make for a few bucks compared to pixelhobby, which is going to be a 2k bead minimum and extremely time restrictive. Even after I got used to the process my record for a really low-color-count, mostly single color board that was part of a bigger project was 4 hours. Boards with a lot of variation and double-checking required can take over 8 hours even when you're 100% confident in your pixeling skills just by virtue of the fact that even with all that detail a couple pixels wrong could cause you to totally derail and force you to pull up a couple hundred beads to fix it(it's extremely rare to get to that point, but it's not impossible when you're zoned out watching netflix).  So my suggestion is just do it for fun, and then when you're bored slap together a few single board projects and throw them on etsy and see if someone bites. But I would definitely not think of this as a major income source."
beadsprites,3ciipe,CardboardDecoy,0,Mon Jul 20 17:06:53 2015 UTC,"That is a fair point. I wouldn't want to try and make it my sole income in any case, just an addition to existing stock, both as completed pieces and selling supplies to others."
beadsprites,3ciipe,CardboardDecoy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:37:03 2015 UTC,"Totally a solid idea. Especially the selling supplies bit, I'd ask PH if they have any retail deals because that would be an awesome item to carry."

I would say it depends on how much you make because if cost it a main factor, don't forget you'll need boards for every creation.  That on top of the more expensive beads might snowball pretty quickly"
beadsprites,3ciipe,oakley_fan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:27:52 2015 UTC,"That is included in those prices.  I did a test pattern using a picture I had lying around, the order would have cost $17.95, including shipping, so I'd have to charge at least $20 to make it worth it.  A $15 price point would only be viable if I plan and order for batches of products (occasionally, I wouldn't have to buy new beads because I'd have some left over from other projects).  Basically, would you be willing to pay more for the higher quality images available from PH?"

beadsprites,3cfftz,Bluebead,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:25:44 2015 UTC,"I don't live in Germany, but I live in Europe. I think it is better if you're going to buy Hama to buy them directly from the Hama website (if you can't find them cheap in stores in germany that is - where I live, I always find beads in the kids section). The main beads I normally use are from Hama (I love their quality and their 6000 packs) then when I need more interesting/different shades I buy Perler from Perler! as much as I love perler, they do melt slightly differently from Hama beads so keep that in mind.   I have also heard people talk about how much they love Artkal which you can get (buy the S brand) from Aliexpress. I've never tried them, but plan to eventually.   Nabbi has some interesting colours too, but so far I've found Nabbi beads (where I am at least) to be the most expensive, and I can only seem to find them in stores. Those who buy Nabbi what sites do you buy them from (EU)?  Edit: Should have also mentioned that the last time I ordered from the Hama website I got the package within 3 days, which was brilliant. Hope this helps."
beadsprites,3cfftz,BubblesDaMonkey,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:25:51 2015 UTC,"I buy Nabbi/Photo Pearls through Creative Company. They have the cheapest prices I have found.

beadsprites,3cfftz,weirdey,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:19:16 2015 UTC,http://www.cchobby.de/ this site sells Nabbi/Photopearl beads (bags of 1100 bottles with 3500 and bags of 6000 beads in single colors.) the official Hama beads website sells from 1k up to 6000 of single colors as well which I highly recommend. http://www.hama.dk/  Buying in bulk saves the most money I've found.  So I usually restock my most used colors through these 2 websites. As the toystores in my area dont stock anything but small bags of SES or Hama brand beads(and very limited in colors)
beadsprites,3cfftz,Bluebead,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:14:54 2015 UTC,How do Nabbi beads melt? More like Perler or more like hama?
beadsprites,3cfftz,weirdey,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:57:43 2015 UTC,"I use Photo Pearls which are made by the same company as Nabbi. I guess they are the same stuff as Nabbi, only the colour palette is somewhat different. Photo Pearls are much harder than Hama and doesn't melt as much. I've heard that Hama and Perler are about the same, but don't have first hand knowledge.  If you are interested, I have some pics on my blog on how Hama and Photo Pearls melt together."

I have no idea who the original artist is though, and make that very clear on my Instagram page and would love to know who came up with these.  But yeah, they're originally thought to be coasters. I already have a set of awesome retro mario coasters, and these star wars faces are a bit big, so I figured they'd be way more badass framed. Totally work as coasters too though. :D"

beadsprites,3cdtdd,wermy426,3,Tue Jul 7 03:20:18 2015 UTC,"I only do the full melt method with the masking tape method, so I'll give a few pieces of advice.  It sounds to me like you had some warping during the melt, which can often come about when you use your pegboards to poke holes in the back of the tape.  I believe your problem could have arised from the way you were ironing.  When I typically do it, I have the iron on the highest setting and I move from one corner and move around the project, moving in slow circular motions while apply medium pressure.  A big help is to go over the entirety of the project a few times, then to start focusing on specific spots.  I speculate that your iron may have lost heat as most irons have a auto-cooldown after being horizontal for about a minute.  It honestly just takes a bit of practice, but stay vigilante!  Work slow, heat evenly and apply pressure.  That way the beads will fuse flat together and if you go for long enough, you should get that nice, flat melt."
beadsprites,3cdtdd,Player4our,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:28:35 2015 UTC,"I am in the market for a new iron and never thought about the horizontal timer as mentioned here. Is there a particular iron that you use, or is the one everyone recommends the standard?"

beadsprites,3cdtdd,Player4our,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:15:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions.  I did use my pegboards to poke holes in the tape - why does that cause warping?  So you start in one corner and just work your way around?  Do you do that one corner completely or just go around several times until the entire edge is done and then do the center?  One big thing I noticed while I was in the process of destroying my creation was that the reynold's paper kept bubbling up in the center, which I'm sure didn't help things.  Any thoughts on that?  Thanks again."
beadsprites,3cdtdd,Jandrem,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:48:48 2015 UTC,"It causes warping because the tape gets pushed into the holes, causing it to be more taut then normal.  This can be remedyed simply by only doing small sections at a time and straightening it out over the process.  What I tend to do is go around the entire project to start, to get everything warmed and starting to melt.  then I focus on one end then work to the other.  Since the whole project is partially melted, there is a better chance that it will stay straight.  It can also help keep the paper down on the project."
beadsprites,3cdtdd,JohnnyGo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:03:00 2015 UTC,"Ok I see what you're saying.  So either poke holes one at a time or sort of massage them after using the peg board to poke holes, to allow the tape to loosen up a bit?  Thanks again for all your suggestions - I know it all just takes practice but I'm really enjoying hearing from folks who have already figured it out.  :)"

beadsprites,3c56p1,exusmc,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:08:13 2015 UTC,"There is a new method called ""taping"" that you might be interested in using on the next larger pieces.  Any masking (white, not clear) tape will work.  What you do is tape the whole piece, one strip at a time, as it sits on your boards.  Once that is done, take a pencil, or something with a point on it, and poke holes in EVERY bead through the tape.  This will allow the heat to transfer safely.  Turn over and iron.  Make sure to use the tips in the other comments about putting something heavy on it afterwards too, to keep warping minimal."

So 36k in pixels, tedious, relaxing, fun, and the end result is well worth it, I am addicted to these little pixel beads, next project will be almost twice the size, 30 base plates, 60k in beads :)  more pix  http://i.imgur.com/YLDUZo3.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/teaIxLS.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/IwyrDw5.jpg  and pixel hobby website  http://www.pixelhobby-usa.com/  & finally, link to /u/kylemccoy Perler Bead version, thanks Kyle  http://www.pixelartshop.com/uploads/9/2/0/8/920811/1728133_orig.jpg  Thanks for looking."

I am using the masking tape method (don't forget to poke holes!) and setting the iron on medium heat. This process takes a bit longer, but I am very happy with the results. Slow, low heat, ironing takes awhile and the tape melted on Samus a bit. The solutions I've found are to move the iron to different areas constantly to keep from heating the beads too much and giving it at least a half hour to cool down under a book.   Thanks to everyone on this subreddit who has given me inspiration and provided helpful tips!"

It is... A test of my tree-like patience, beadspriting with a one year-old on my lap, but it just makes the end result that much more enjoyable.  I realize my work is still very amateurish, but each of these pieces was a learning experience, and I feel like I'm getting better with each pass.

beadsprites,3bvoj2,smurfbesser,5,Thu Jul 2 15:09:36 2015 UTC,"Yep, +1 for the masking tape method.  Here's what I posted in another thread about this, if you want to fix it:  I had the exact same issue as you. I fixed it by (I know it sounds funny) microwaving uncooked rice inside a cloth sack (you can use an old sock or whatever too). Microwave it for a couple minutes and it'll remain scalding hot for quite a while. Set it on top of the warped board, covering the whole thing, and set a heavy book on top of it (heavy enough to push all the warped sides down). Leave it there for an hour or so. Make sure it's completely flat for this. Take off the rice pack after an hour or so, and put the book back on it to let it cool down completely, and you should be all set. I've used this method on 3 or 4 VERY warped boards, and they are now as flat as a brand new one."
beadsprites,3bvoj2,wermy426,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:42:02 2015 UTC,I was just thinking about how could I reheat it and then press it down ha! Thank you for this awesome advice I will defiantly be doing this and using tape method from here on forward.
beadsprites,3bvoj2,killerolav,6,Thu Jul 2 16:15:09 2015 UTC,"This is one of the reasons I use the tapingmethod, no risk of ruining your boards.   I've got some slightly warped boards that I can use just fine, not sure if this one's actually useable though.   They're not very expensive, so I would just pick up some new boards and not iron the beads directly on the boards."
beadsprites,3bvoj2,Player4our,2,Thu Jul 2 15:13:12 2015 UTC,I will have to look into the taping method. I suppose I can just barely melt the beads take them off the board and finish too while I practice the tape method.
beadsprites,3bvoj2,Phaeda,3,Thu Jul 2 15:33:08 2015 UTC,"The tape method is actually super, super simple.  Just put tape on the beads, rub it down, and lift.  Then poke holes through the tape and iron!  I wouldn't iron straight onto the board anymore, but there are plenty of tutorials to look at.  But practice makes perfect, so try out a few tiny sprites while you learn how to do it."
beadsprites,3bvoj2,Erekai,2,Thu Jul 2 15:47:44 2015 UTC,I just watched the video on the sidebar and it looks rather easy. Looks like I will be picking up some masking tape.
beadsprites,3bvoj2,Player4our,2,Thu Jul 2 15:55:07 2015 UTC,"I'm a firm 'taper', but one thing that happens that you should be made aware of before a project is that sometimes the tape won't come off the back after ironing. Depending on the project this could be an important factor in deciding whether to tape or to iron in situ."
beadsprites,3bvoj2,Boshemo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:29:51 2015 UTC,Oh that is some very good info... I am wondering what if taping to start and when you turn it over to do the back maybe use parchment paper instead? Thoughts?
beadsprites,3bvoj2,evpamplemousse,2,Fri Jul 3 15:29:36 2015 UTC,"Don't iron directly on top of the tape.  The purpose of the taping method is to be able to easily transfer your sprite from your board so you don't ruin your boards by ironing them onto them.  It goes essentially like this:   Build sprite Tape it up Poke holes in the tape (to create somewhere for the hot air to go) Remove sprite from board and flip over Apply parchment paper, iron one side Optionally remove tape from the other side, then apply parchment paper, and iron.   I've never had tape stubbornly stick to my sprite when I'm taking it off.  But I do take the tape off when the sprite is still warm/hot, just gotta be a little careful that the beads aren't too soft that they warp/distort when you're pulling the tape off.  For reference, I use ""Duck"" brand thick masking tape."
beadsprites,3bvoj2,Erekai,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:46:27 2015 UTC,Thanks! I did those steps exactly which makes me happy that I'm on the right track. I appreciate you taking the time to reply back.

beadsprites,3bnh3b,kylemccoy,4,Tue Jun 30 17:06:40 2015 UTC,Here is my portrait that I did a bit ago. Also have a youtube of it but I need to make the quality better. Poor lighting killed the video quality.  Pictures of it canvased. one| two|  At work so I can only really get an instagram of it. I'll imgur the pictures later if I remember
beadsprites,3bnh3b,Rolodex_Propaganda,2,Tue Jun 30 18:07:31 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, I've seen that one. Nice work, my friend! Way bigger than any of mine lately. Insane amount of detail. Mad props to you."
beadsprites,3bnh3b,Rolodex_Propaganda,2,Tue Jun 30 23:39:53 2015 UTC,Holy moly. That kinda gears me up to keep creating. Keep up the good work!
beadsprites,3bnh3b,Arkimund,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:53:40 2015 UTC,Looks gorgeous! Once I feel comfortabe enough (about to get started working with beads for the first time) then I will eventually surprise my girlfriend making a portrait :-)   Thanks for the inspiration!

beadsprites,3bkps1,wermy426,2,Tue Jun 30 00:44:55 2015 UTC,Looking good!
beadsprites,3bkps1,Pizzaguy276,2,Tue Jun 30 16:23:04 2015 UTC,For working with only 6 colors I like it. I used the ironing paper that came with my pack of boards and I think I'll be using the Reynolds from now on to avoid those nasty creases.   Wish I could have gotten every hole to close but I didn't want to ruin my first attempt.   Now I just want a way to have every color possible without spending money...
beadsprites,3bkps1,Player4our,3,Tue Jun 30 00:42:53 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately impossible :D   But if you want every color, take full advantage when sales become available, especially on the EK site."

beadsprites,3bjstv,UnLeadedApe,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:46:52 2015 UTC,Thanks you guys. This was my first attempt on a large beadsprite. :D
beadsprites,3bjstv,Sennafan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:56:49 2015 UTC,Where did you get the sprite from?  I've been looking to do that exact one for some time now.
beadsprites,3bm8f0,StrawberryCake88,3,Tue Jun 30 10:26:54 2015 UTC,"You could also try wearing some rubber gloves, like your doctor or dentist might. When I make my sprites I don't use my hands a lot, I prefer to use tweezers. That could be another possible solution. I do enjoy some good cross stitch though, I just don't have the steadiness of hand for it."
beadsprites,3bm8f0,I_am_Mr_Anteater,2,Thu Jul 2 04:15:57 2015 UTC,"That's weird. Perler beads are pretty much just dyed plastic, right? Do you have allergic reactions to other plastic products? What exactly is the reaction you're having?"
beadsprites,3bm8f0,theevamonkey,3,Tue Jun 30 14:23:03 2015 UTC,"Dyes themselves can cause allergic reactions. Although, it is odd. Maybe the silicone/oil they use in production is what OP is having a reaction to."
beadsprites,3bm8f0,Cotterbot,2,Tue Jun 30 22:11:05 2015 UTC,I'm no doctor  Try rinsing the beads before you use them?
beadsprites,3bm8f0,GrammerPants,2,Wed Jul 1 04:39:05 2015 UTC,Could be fun :) What kind of Pokemon would you be interested in? I'm waiting on an order of beads to come in but I would be up for a trade.
beadsprites,3bm8f0,reddittailedhawk,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:31:55 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply. I was thinking of 3-6 figures from Pokemon, probably Emerald. Maybe one of the main character, a Pokemon sprite, a berry tree and some NPCs? Would that be considered a big order? I want to put it on a wall to look like a screen shot."
beadsprites,3bm8f0,reddittailedhawk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:35:10 2015 UTC,"All good, still waiting on the order but it should be here very soon. That's definitely doable, and a cool idea. If you want to give me the specific sprites you want, I could probably get a start on them with the colors I have. What would be a fair trade on your end? I know next to nothing about cross stitching, so I don't know how long it would take. Beading doesn't take me long and I find it relaxing, is it the same for you? I'll talk to my partner and see what he's interested in. Beading is something we got into together, so yeah. He'll be helping."
beadsprites,3bm8f0,erinncart,2,Tue Jul 14 00:48:34 2015 UTC,"I'd love to trade Pokemon sprites! Just let us know what Pokemon your prefer/what kind of sprite (ex: overworld sprite, icon sprite ect.)  ALSO, tweezers are a good solution to NOT touching the beads. You could get a pair of tweezers that's a pretty decent size or Perler has their own tweezers. Good luck, friend!"
beadsprites,3blj68,pn2013,2,Tue Jun 30 04:58:24 2015 UTC,"Looks great!  I am by no means an expert and am still trying to perfect the flat-melt method, but I have found that slightly lower temperatures can help avoid the bleeding of the black beads into adjacent beads, and a bit more pressure can help get rid of the little dimples.  Seriously though this looks great, especially for a first attempt.  :)"
beadsprites,3blj68,wermy426,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:16:52 2015 UTC,Thank you for the kind words and good info!  I'll try a lower setting on my iron to see if it helps with the black beads. I wasn't sure how hot my crappy iron needed to be.  Now I just have to decide which style of melting I prefer.
beadsprites,3blj68,wermy426,2,Tue Jun 30 19:32:17 2015 UTC,"Flat-melt, all the way.  ;)"
beadsprites,3bk4fi,cfbrunner,4,Mon Jun 29 21:43:46 2015 UTC,Absolutely fantastic my man.  How'd you properly pixelate the image?
beadsprites,3bk4fi,Player4our,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:48:12 2015 UTC,"Would also like to know about this please, thanks!"

beadsprites,3bk4fi,wermy426,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:13:05 2015 UTC,Awesome!  Nicely done. I bet that was scary to transfer to masking tape and iron. :)
beadsprites,3bk4fi,DarkCirno,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:58:15 2015 UTC,That's awesome! How did you flip it over?

beadsprites,3bilzd,racpg,4,Mon Jun 29 15:06:01 2015 UTC,"It looks great!   I don't want to be a nay-sayer, but you'll really like it better if you can fix that gap before you iron. I know how delicate that is, maybe you can trim off the separating tape with an xacto knife or something."
beadsprites,3bilzd,rowr,3,Mon Jun 29 16:28:04 2015 UTC,Oh definitely! I'm going to make sure there are no gaps before ironing but I was waiting until I finish the last section before making sure everything is perfect.
beadsprites,3bilzd,Jennabi,2,Mon Jun 29 17:08:29 2015 UTC,"Super adorable! Look, she's cheering you on telling you that you can do it--you can iron it!"
beadsprites,3bilzd,DenverNugs,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:11:30 2015 UTC,Congrats! Looks really good. I'm doing my first today as well once the mail comes. :)

beadsprites,3bl0sn,wermy426,2,Tue Jun 30 02:11:25 2015 UTC,"Go slow, start on one area and get that finished, put weights on that part and continue with the next part and repeat the process till you've ironed it all and its all weighed down. You'll probably have to go in for another run over the whole thing if anything is still bending or if there are still holes you want to close up."
beadsprites,3bl0sn,Stralor,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:52:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips!  If I do it this way, one area at a time, will I still be able to get a nice smooth finish?  Or will I get some weird spots after a spot cools off/shrinks some, if that spot gets re-ironed?"
beadsprites,3bl0sn,Stralor,2,Wed Jul 1 14:20:46 2015 UTC,"if you try to iron the whole thing in one go, edges will start to curl.  You can always go back in and iron some more as long you're not ironing on a really high setting. The shrinking isnt as much as an issue as the curling is. You can just reiron stuff after its cooled down if you see spots not melted enough to your liking. You just cant unmelt spots."
beadsprites,3bl0sn,Stralor,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:33:10 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks again!  One more question for you (assuming you use the masking tape method): do you iron on a hard flat surface, or with something like a thin towel underneath the beads to allow air to more easily escape?"
beadsprites,3bl0sn,FancyPhalanges,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:45:54 2015 UTC,"No towel just on a big wooden table.  I iron it the way ive explained it earlier, then when it's cooled off i peel off the tape and put the weights back on.  It will lay flatter easier that way.  I use a large flexible cutting board to flip it over.  I don't go for a full close on my beads, as the brands I use don't really close up that well."
beadsprites,3bkxg6,xojesh93xo,4,Tue Jun 30 01:44:26 2015 UTC,"I haven't sold anything, so I'm not sure I'm a good source, but it sounds like a lot of people buy booths at craft shows, or start etsy stores.    I would be careful about copyright infringement though.  I thought about selling some sports themed beadsprites, did some research and the fines are pretty steep and licenses are really expensive."
beadsprites,3bkxg6,EpOxY81,3,Tue Jun 30 02:40:06 2015 UTC,"I tried an etsy, it failed. Unless you're gonna be able to market yourself everywhere, all the time, it will be tough to build enough.  I still use my Facebook page, letting people contact me for items or commissions. But, my best sales came from getting a table at a local comic con. Find one of those!"
beadsprites,3bkxg6,TheDWProfessor,2,Tue Jun 30 04:02:18 2015 UTC,How would I find if there is one around me.  And the etsy thing makes me feel like the supply there is much higher than the demand.
beadsprites,3bkxg6,StaciaMarine,3,Tue Jun 30 04:11:56 2015 UTC,"I looked up ""Art shows in [my state]"" and checked out if there was anything in my area. I was surprised to see how many there were! I have an Etsy shop too, but I have yet to make a sale since I don't really have the time or money to advertise myself.   Good luck!"
beadsprites,3bkxg6,EpOxY81,2,Tue Jun 30 04:23:03 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice!
beadsprites,3bkxg6,TheDWProfessor,2,Tue Jun 30 04:30:50 2015 UTC,"I guess I will have to do some research as well.  I thought about etsy but the shipping and everything seems like it might know be with it.  With the cost to post, transaction fee and shipping"
beadsprites,3bkxg6,reddittailedhawk,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:45:42 2015 UTC,"If the etsy store is free... you'll never know until someone buys something (or doesn't).  Just build those costs into the price and see if anyone bites?  I sold non-beadsprite things on ebay before and was surprised how much people were willing to pay for shipping.  (or how much they would be willing to pay when I bundled it and said ""free shipping!"")"
beadsprites,3bigys,smurfbesser,3,Mon Jun 29 14:24:41 2015 UTC,"So this is the first project I have done in about 10 years and I have some questions! I definitely need to make a smaller pot this in and I want to paint it appropriately to but I do have some questions going forward.   1) Do you find that some colors take longer to melt than others? For instance the red and pink seemed to take quite a bit longer than the white to melt but maybe I was just ironing wrong....  2) It might be hard to see in the picture but I noticed some lines horizontally across the top really melted area is that caused by the edge of the iron?  3) I really like the hikingdave site  for making patterns but I'm confused about the pattern instructions. I left a pattern as actual size to see what it did and it when it says Row:1, Column: 1 is that 1 whole peg board?"
beadsprites,3bigys,triculious,3,Mon Jun 29 14:40:20 2015 UTC,1) Yes. Old advice yet still useful: use as little heat as possible. Takes longer to iron but delivers a better result IMO.  2 & 3 I can't answer as I'm at work and can't open those links.
beadsprites,3bigys,triculious,3,Mon Jun 29 15:01:47 2015 UTC,What setting do you use on your iron? I think mine has 4-5 options
beadsprites,3bjkg3,duckduckling,3,Mon Jun 29 19:18:42 2015 UTC,"I did a pokemon wall with the 18 starters as my first perler project.  About a year later, I redid the sprites now that I have my own style and finesse.  I gave the old ones away to people I knew.  I would suggest that.  See if anyone would like to have them.  Otherwise, find some other use, like a coaster for your bedside table or a thing to fix a wobbly table leg"
beadsprites,3bjkg3,Player4our,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:36:05 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I'm a bit embarassed to give these away since they totally suck!   Thanks for the suggestions, I giggled thinking of using my bad Dragonair sprite to fix some table. That would look funny."
beadsprites,3bjkg3,Player4our,3,Mon Jun 29 19:41:16 2015 UTC,"I guarantee if your mom got it, that thing would be on the gosh darn fridge so fast"

beadsprites,3bjkg3,wermy426,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:57:21 2015 UTC,"That is the best idea...every time I try that though, I end up giving away the better sprite, because I think ""ah what the hay, I'll just make myself another newer.. better one. I want them to have the good one"" haha."
beadsprites,3bjkg3,possessednayru,3,Sun Jul 5 23:03:34 2015 UTC,"I give them to my kids.  The good ones go up on the wall, the duds go to them to play with.  They don't know they are duds - they love 'em.  :)"

beadsprites,3bjkg3,Erekai,2,Tue Jun 30 02:07:53 2015 UTC,If they are overironed (depending on how much) I either give them to my almost 2 year old to play with or I use them as coasters!

You can then put it into paint or anything similiar and use the grid option, which should put it into pixelated form.

It looks like a column was duplicated (last column ""in,"" first column ""out""... was that intentional because it looked better?  to make it more like you could see into the portal?  or just an accident?"

Check out the blues in his pants, they don't match up with what would be the two adjacent columns you're describing.    Actually the way I did it was building the Mario sprite across two boards going off of one sprite image, and then taking those two boards apart when I wanted to separate it.  So no, there are no duplicated columns.  Hope this helps! :)"

You line up the beads on the pegboard(s), iron the beads to fuse them together while they are on the board(or alternatively, do the masking tape method to get them off the pegboard to iron; instructions for that are in the links to the right sidebar) then you could mount it on to the wood. The beads won't fall part after you've fused them together with an iron so you peel them off the pegboard(s)/masking tape. Hope that helps! 8D"

beadsprites,3azc7b,precursormar,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:49:10 2015 UTC,"So what did you wind up buying?  I want to start beadspriting, but figuring out what to buy seems really overwhelming lol."
beadsprites,3azc7b,JJTheJetPlane5657,2,Thu Jun 25 01:57:05 2015 UTC,"I think my first buy was just the 16 pack set of 4000pcs that came with white, black, light pink, red, raspberry, plum, purple, lavender, orange, cheddar, yellow, prickly pear, dark green, sky blue??, cyan, and periwinkle, got an individual bag of 1000pcs of black, and a pack of four pegboards. The set isn't too bad for starting out on small stuff, if you ask me. My listed purchases let me make all the Pokemons shown except Chingling and Milotic, Treeslime, the funky octopus, Gudetama, and a King Babble Slime (not pictured) that I gave to my brother. All small Pokemon sprites can be made on just one pegboard but if you're starting/planning to do larger stuff, might as well get a pack of 4 or more.    BUY LOTS OF BLACK! Beadsprites that take roughly 4 pegboards to make generally take 500+ black beads for outlines. Black is practically needed for everything so it doesn't hurt to stock up on them or end up like me currently with maybe 300 left and not sure if I can make something large from them (probably not unless I get really creative with colour substituting @_@;;).     I was also kind of crazy and bought a mixed bucket of 11,000 beads and I really don't recommend that unless you really want to sort all that. Pro of that is you get to sample a bunch of colours, con of it is sorting can be painful on your back and neck (if you're hunched over a bed like me to do it lol) if not incredibly boring to do as well.      All in all, it really depends on what you think you'll be making and what size you're starting off with. I personally like to have a rainbow of colours just in case but a friend of mine thinks sets are a waste and she general just has fleshy/earthy tones. I prefer making monsters/creatures so I don't use much fleshtones but she prefers making humans more so she doesn't, I guess, need such a huge variety of weird colours.      Sorry to ramble! I hope that helped! 8'D"

I know this is COMPLETELY irrelevant to the purpose of this subreddit, but can you help me understand why people like Adventure Time? My wife and I have watched and love Metalocalypse and Rick and Morty but we're having a hard time getting into Adventure Time. It feels like mostly non sequitur humor that isn't particularly clever. Admittedly we've only watched the first few episodes... does it get more clever as the series progresses or is it a type of humor that only hits certain people? The few episodes that we actually like are the episodes with Marceline (sp?) and her father and the episode with the Snow Golem and the Fire Wolf...those we like, but the first few episodes have fallen flat. Help? I feel like I should like this show but haven't gotten drawn in yet."

beadsprites,3at3gt,l1quidhobo,6,Tue Jun 23 08:03:17 2015 UTC,"In my personal experience, I try to rework the sprite to connect it orthogonally. It won't really connect diagonally, and I don't like the look of clear beads to hold it on."
beadsprites,3at3gt,NSNick,3,Tue Jun 23 10:23:56 2015 UTC,"In a situation like that, I wait until I have the piece taped up and ready for ironing, then manually move those beads closer to the nearest bead of the sprite, but still diagonal as intended. Then I press the moved bead(s) down on the tape and iron the piece as usual."

beadsprites,3anq8b,iJLedge,2,Mon Jun 22 03:20:49 2015 UTC,I definitely do that.  Less arm movement.
beadsprites,3anq8b,Kwolek2005,2,Mon Jun 22 04:22:37 2015 UTC,You can't see in the video because it's so sped up but when filling in colours I actually drop like 4 or 5 beads at a time into it and move them into place. I find if you drop loads it takes just as long to get them onto the pegs properly and fill in the gaps as just doing it a few at a time.
beadsprites,3anq8b,iJLedge,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:26:56 2015 UTC,Yeah there's a point where too many dropped beads makes it too tight to move around .

beadsprites,3anw6g,minyooongi,3,Mon Jun 22 01:33:51 2015 UTC,"Hey something I know about.  :)  I had the exact same issue as you.  I fixed it by (I know it sounds funny) microwaving uncooked rice inside a cloth sack (you can use an old sock or whatever too).  Microwave it for a couple minutes and it'll remain scalding hot for quite a while.  Set it on top of the warped board, covering the whole thing, and set a heavy book on top of it (heavy enough to push all the warped sides down).  Leave it there for an hour or so.  Make sure it's completely flat for this.  Take off the rice pack after an hour or so, and put the book back on it to let it cool down completely, and you should be all set.  I've used this method on 3 or 4 VERY warped boards, and they are now as flat as a brand new one.    Hope this helps!"
beadsprites,3anw6g,wermy426,2,Mon Jun 22 17:37:30 2015 UTC,"For the boards, you can try warming them up (like, use a throwaway amount of beads and iron them), and then while the boards are still warm, place them under some heavy books and leave them there for a  day or so.  It might work, depending on how warped your boards are.  For the masking tape method, I generally don't poke holes, but I don't flat iron, so air can get out the same side as long as I pick up or move the iron frequently.  If you are flat ironing, or just in general wanting to close up the beads, I usually poke holes so that the air has somewhere to go. If you do poke holes though, you still have to make sure your piece moves around or lifts up enough to let the air escape out the back - if it's always pressed flat against a table, it's the same effect as not poking the holes: nowhere for the air to go."
beadsprites,3anw6g,ummeiko,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:55:06 2015 UTC,I watched a video that suggested doing your ironing on a towel.  So it's relatively flat and is breathable.
beadsprites,3anw6g,EpOxY81,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:03:13 2015 UTC,What I like about sprite-ing is you get to do it your own way. Make a few small projects that you don't overly care about and try different methods. You will find what you like. As far as the warped boards I don't know if they can be fixed. That being said I would just send away for some new ones so you don't have to ever question if a seem (seam) is off because a board is warped.
beadsprites,3anw6g,Airhof,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:07:26 2015 UTC,"i've heard of people flattening the boards by putting things on them for a long time... but I've never done it myself.  I suppose you could also try heating it up  a little and then putting something heavy on it until it cools down.  For poking holes try, after taping it, tape it to your table.  Then, flip the board over and use it to poke the holes.  Don't try to do them all at once, but work your way from one edge, like 5-6 rows a time, to the other.  It works pretty well for me and it seems to be a lot faster."
beadsprites,3anw6g,EpOxY81,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:04:23 2015 UTC,"This. Poking the holes one by one with a pen or something like that takes forever, use a board to poke the holes!   I can't imagine poking 60,000 holes in the biggest piece I've done by hand... :)"
beadsprites,3anw6g,killerolav,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:00:44 2015 UTC,"I think you're right on the money about poking holes being most important in flat ironing.  Myself, I prefer the ""double-sided partial-iron"" method, and so poking holes isn't vitally important, but I do it regardless.  It's not so bad if you use another board to poke the holes.  What I usually do is poke 5-6 holes in the corner, and then 5-6 more holes in a few additional places around the sprite just to make sure that the board stays aligned.  It goes pretty quick and it's worth the effort.  As for the warping of boards, I have warped a couple of mine and I honestly found it far less effort to just get new ones.  Granted, I live pretty close to a few craft stores that sell them, so it was easy for me to replace them instead of heating them up, putting heavy things on them for days (or who knows how long) at a time.  My time is more valuable than that, so I just replaced them :P"

I do the masking tape method and it still ends up that way, so I don't think ironing on the board has much to do with it. But I would suggest the tape method anyway, especially if you want full melts later on because I used to full melt and I ruined a ton of boards because of all the heat and pressure needed for it."
beadsprites,3ajt5q,Player4our,2,Sat Jun 20 22:06:24 2015 UTC,How do you get them to melt so evenly without messing everything up? Do you use the masking tape method?
beadsprites,3ajt5q,Tylervp,2,Sat Jun 20 22:38:50 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised how often i'm asked this.  Yes, I do the masking tape method, so I make each design in reverse.  To get the full melt look, I set my iron to the highest setting it will go too and when I melt, do fast circular motions and apply a little pressure.  It definitely took a couple tries to really get it down pat, but the full melt makes them actually look like sprites which I really prefer compared to the hole look."

beadsprites,3allac,killerolav,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:28:01 2015 UTC,you could add a border of clear beads to counteract that though
beadsprites,3allac,codetracker,2,Mon Jun 22 05:52:55 2015 UTC,Because I have to use Hama beads I have no real choice. So open holes here.
beadsprites,3allac,weirdey,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:52:08 2015 UTC,That is literally the only reason I haven't gotten Hama beads.
beadsprites,3allac,Player4our,2,Sun Jun 21 20:23:48 2015 UTC,Shipping Perler beads to Germany is  way too expensive...
beadsprites,3allac,weirdey,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:38:15 2015 UTC,ohhh.... that's terrible
beadsprites,3allac,Player4our,2,Sun Jun 21 21:58:37 2015 UTC,"I partial iron both sides, so that the beads are still... beads, I guess.  Unless the piece is very small, then I will sometimes flat iron.  Maybe it's because I do a lot of large pieces, and a consistent full flat iron is very hard to pull off.  Or maybe I just suck at flat ironing.  But overall, I like the beads to have more of the rounded, beady look to them."
beadsprites,3allac,ummeiko,2,Sun Jun 21 22:30:12 2015 UTC,"I prefer to flat-iron one side as much as possible, and leave the other side raw. That way, I get the best of both worlds. The only look I don't like is the partial fuse of both sides, because it's never perfectly even and having some more open than others bugs the crap out of me."
beadsprites,3allac,Zounder1002,3,Mon Jun 22 06:29:54 2015 UTC,"A lot of people prefer that.  But I actually prefer a partial iron on both sides, for the open bead look.  Not to mention it makes the sprites much more durable."
beadsprites,3allac,Erekai,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:53:39 2015 UTC,"I'd actually say the latter.  When you have the full fuse, it's basically impossible to break them apart.  But I think both ways are pretty strong, so durability should be roughly the same either way."
beadsprites,3allac,Player4our,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:23:01 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, I don't mean ""durable"" as in ""hard to break the beads off.""  It may be hard to rip them apart, but they're still floppy and flimsy.  With a partial iron on both sides, the sprites are super firm and sturdy.  But hey, it's a personal preference.  I've ironed several sprites with the full fuse method, and after a few of those, I've decided I don't like it as much as the partial iron method."
beadsprites,3allac,Erekai,2,Sun Jun 21 22:35:22 2015 UTC,I can agree with that
beadsprites,3allac,Player4our,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:05:11 2015 UTC,"depends on what i'm making.  if I'm making a video game sprite, I think the full-fuse looks more... ""accurate""  For other things, sometimes the beaded size gives more... roundedness?"
beadsprites,3akdbm,wermy426,3,Sun Jun 21 01:31:38 2015 UTC,I hope this plays in your head every time you pick up your keys
beadsprites,3akdbm,Erekai,2,Sun Jun 21 14:56:52 2015 UTC,That. Is. So. Fucking. Rad.
beadsprites,3akdbm,Kakkal,2,Sun Jun 21 01:34:34 2015 UTC,Thanks!
beadsprites,3akdbm,Player4our,2,Sun Jun 21 01:45:56 2015 UTC,What's the setup?  Is it being pushed from the wall a bit to hold the bowl?  If so what with?  This is super cool
beadsprites,3akdbm,ariesfiretiger86,3,Sun Jun 21 01:43:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I cut a sheet of acrylic roughly the same shape as the bead creation, hot-glued it to the back to give it some rigidity and strength.  Then I got an L-bracket and glued that to the acrylic sheet, coming over the the top of the statue's hand.  Then I glued a little dish to the L-bracket, and attached a picture-hanging bracket to the back.  So it's all one piece and can be moved pretty easily."

beadsprites,3ah3kf,blairr,2,Sat Jun 20 05:46:07 2015 UTC,"I had this on my to-do for so long, but I couldn't find a way to reduce the blues down.  There's about 7 blues/bluish purples and the wings make him almost 5 feet wide if I remember plotting it out.  Any idea how you plan on stabilizing it?"
beadsprites,3ah3kf,The_Real_Slack,2,Sat Jun 20 05:25:15 2015 UTC,he's roughly 41x33. i bought a canvas that i plan on having a friend paint to glue him to and hang him on.

beadsprites,3ah3kf,Trestanray,2,Sat Jun 20 06:18:51 2015 UTC,"Holy hell, sir. This is fantastic. Do you mind posting the colors you used for this?"

beadsprites,3ah3kf,Anithera,2,Sat Jun 20 16:10:02 2015 UTC,You should make a mini tyrael to tag along with him!  http://orig00.deviantart.net/cd2d/f/2009/314/0/c/tyrael_diablo_2_bead_sprite_by_serenaazureth.jpg  Found that. Forgot how to format links.

beadsprites,3aek4s,Mitoni,5,Fri Jun 19 17:55:35 2015 UTC,"Wow, well done!  May I ask the dimensions, roughly?  57k beads is just so many that I can't quite picture how large that must be.  That's just insane, haha, and it looks great!  Do you have any tips for someone attempting a large piece for the first time?  Mine is only 9k-ish beads, but it's bigger than anything I've attempted before.  It's all taped up, but I've been delaying the ironing part because I'm afraid to ruin it now at the very end.  Also, what did you mount this on?  Fill me with your knowledge, oh Great One!  :P"
beadsprites,3aek4s,Bgoodfinger,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:31:49 2015 UTC,It's 155 cm wide and 91 cm high :) so it's really big :D   When it comes to the ironing.. just do it :) this was my first big piece that i ironed in one go as well ^ suuuuuper nervous! Took me three hours to complete! I only ironed the backside.. thought it looked a lot cooler like that :) I mounted this on a laarge piece of plywood. used tons of glue that stick to both wood and plastic and a not tiny amount of tiny nails randomly around the board where the glue didn't do the trick :P I am certain that you project will look awesome!
