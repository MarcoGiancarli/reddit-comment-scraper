Scrubs,3d8lw5,hoodie92,3,Tue Jul 14 12:14:38 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, the ep makes a big deal out of Janitor's roof toilet, and it ends up being an obstacle that both Fox's character as a sufferer of OCD & all-around germophobe and Elliott must overcome. In Elliott's case, using the roof loo gives her the courage to be able to be cool under pressure when the copter lands with the intensive care patient. Basically if she can get over that (being a nervous poo-er, and all), then she can get over her fear of screwing up when a life is on the line."

Scrubs,3cuftz,blindsquirrel1550,169,Fri Jul 10 21:36:54 2015 UTC,"Well.  Firstly, she dates turk knowing that he's immature and a bit goofy. Then spends the next however many episodes trying to change him and telling him he is wrong for being who he is.  She is judgemental of others, she tries to convince Cox to break up with Jordan just because she doesn't think they connect in the right way.  She convinces turk to kick JD out of their shared apartment, despite it being JD who originally found the apartment.  Once they get engaged she is constantly saying the wedding is all about her and that turk doesn't matter.   During the wedding planning she almost ruins turks career by uninviting his boss without even consulting him on it.  She makes massive deals out of things turk does that are entirely within character for him to do.  She views sex as a weapon to get her way with turk as she is constantly threatening to take it away from him, also implying that a woman couldn't want sex just for herself, she also uses it to bribe him into doing things he has said he doesn't want to do.  Once married she begins to change everything to the way she wants ignoring turks wishes and actually at one point says that she makes all the decisions and only let's turk make ones that don't matter, so it's always up to turk to be the one compromising instead of her.  She also basically bribes/forces turk into having a baby by getting rid of all her birth control and being like ""we are having a baby"" regardless of whether turk feels ready.  She also states that he doesn't even have to show up in raising the kid until it's time to teach him or her sports.  A statement put to lie when she later at the janitors wedding complains at him for never doing anything with the kids. She also once the baby is born stops paying attention to turk, prompting turk to ask why she has to be such a mommy all the time, to which she responds because she is a mommy all the time. But she is also a wife all the time, and for the most part it seems is either dismissive or ignoring turks needs and wants.  In general she is manipulative and judgemental and not that nice of a person."
Scrubs,3cuftz,Sm314,56,Fri Jul 10 23:07:49 2015 UTC,Ya... Those are some pretty convincing reasons...
Scrubs,3cuftz,Joeleus,16,Sat Jul 11 00:11:17 2015 UTC,Don't forget though that JD an d Turk are complete dicks and are really immature. The simple fact is that a lot of her behaviour can be attributed to the fact that Turk is so childish. She was there to support Turk when he needed it. Is pretty much everyone's crutch. Yes she does it for her own reasons but thats like real life. People often do the right thing for the wrong reasons  Tl;Dr carla has to be that way cos of the characters surrounding her. If she doesn't all those adult babies would kill themselves
Scrubs,3cuftz,Spinetablet,15,Sat Jul 11 09:41:42 2015 UTC,"I call bull. She knew exactly who Turk was when she got with him.

Scrubs,3cuftz,Joeleus,0,Sun Jul 12 11:23:26 2015 UTC,I said she does it for selfish reasons. Yes she's controlling and she does it cos she likes it. However Turk also knew who he was marrying.

Scrubs,3cuftz,Strikeoutboy,7,Sat Jul 11 06:47:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's really weird. I don't have time right now but I'll link to the episode later.   EDIT: It's Season 4, Episode 18. After the scene with Dr. Cox's car, Turk explicitly tells JD, ""It was my idea."""
Scrubs,3cuftz,MrBoobieBuyer,33,Sat Jul 11 09:28:00 2015 UTC,"Also, she ragged on JD for not wanting to date Alex until her saw her. Yet, she made Turk undress in the on-call room before she would give him a chance. And then she just fucking walked out.  And, she bitched at Turk for not sacrificing beer and exercise when she was pregnant. But she didn't quit eating sweets when he was diagnosed with diabetes.  She berated Lloyd the delivery man for making harmless joke.  She was a complete bitch to Elliot despite her being new to the hospital just like JD.  She lied about Rowdy and didn't fess up until she was pushed into a corner by the Janitor.  I'm sure there's plenty more I could hate on her about, but it's been a while since I've seen the show."
Scrubs,3cuftz,fattyoncrack,16,Sat Jul 11 02:18:37 2015 UTC,"She made Turk give up beer after he was continuously rubbing it in her face and the Lloyd thing was actually part of the episode. The episode was showing that everyone in the hospital could make jokes about each other and be comfortable with having a joke at their own expense, except for Carla. I believe by the end of the episode she was more okay with being the butt of a joke."
Scrubs,3cuftz,CykoTom,4,Sat Jul 11 04:26:33 2015 UTC,Carla had character flaws that she tried to work on as her character developed.  This was pointed out a couple times in the series run.
Scrubs,3cuftz,fattyoncrack,5,Sat Jul 11 10:53:11 2015 UTC,"I mean, every character did. They lived and they learned and we were lucky enough to watch the it happen."
Scrubs,3cuftz,astralrenascence,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:56:21 2015 UTC,"The problem with these examples is that this is how the started out. These situations were the beginning of the show, where the problems have arisen. By the end of the show, she and everyone else learns a lesson on better treatment or even being more respectful to one another. The entire show is literally centered around everyone learning how to grow up.   I personally don't feel that Carla is nearly as bad as everyone sums her up to me and as one of the previous users on this thread mentioned, all of the characters have their own sets of flaws and quirks. Carla just happens to have a bossy and emotional personality. That is her character. And the other characters come to understand and accept this throughout the show because they care about her, but you can't expect every character to act perfect all the time. That would make for a boring show.   Also, despite being characters on a tv show, they are all HUMAN. And are very well represented as humans by the constant mistakes and bad decisions and momentary blunders they make."

Scrubs,3cuftz,xxDeeJxx,4,Sat Jul 11 14:12:30 2015 UTC,"Don't forget when turk had to give surgery to the lady that wanted to do hypnosis instead of anesthetics.  Turk, a surgeon who's spent the last 8 years in school + (3 at this point?) as a practicing surgeon doesn't want to because he thinks it won't work.   Carla then says basically ""I think you should do it because I believe in hypnosis, and since we are married my have to think my opinions are right"".     That one upset me."
Scrubs,3cuftz,Starburstnova,4,Sun Jul 12 06:16:33 2015 UTC,"Well.  Firstly, she dates turk knowing that he's immature and a bit goofy. Then spends the next however many episodes trying to change him and telling him he is wrong for being who he is.   When did she ever try to change him? She was exasperated with his antics, sure. But I don't ever remember her trying to change him, except by pointing out when he was being disrespectful.   She is judgemental of others, she tries to convince Cox to break up with Jordan just because she doesn't think they connect in the right way.   I'll give you that she can be a control freak who wants the best for her friends and sometimes meddled where it wasn't her place. I don't think she was ever really judgmental. She knew Jordan well and was making a well informed judgment. They'd already been divorced and she knew how it was, and she just didn't want her good friend getting put in a bad situation again. She lightened up about it when they were happy, mostly.   She convinces turk to kick JD out of their shared apartment, despite it being JD who originally found the apartment.   Why does everyone always say this? JD could have stood up for it if he wanted it that badly. And Turk didn't want to leave. JD got the place for himself and Turk. He had no problem with Carla moving in. It's easier for one person to move than two. If it wasn't the best option for the situation, JD probably wouldn't have given in so quickly.   Once they get engaged she is constantly saying the wedding is all about her and that turk doesn't matter.    Because Turk didn't care. He never had any input. And she even got him a big screen TV so he could watch the game, which he did actually care about. Turk forgave her for that. Wedding planning is stressful. Didn't Turk intervene only after JD put ideas in his head?   During the wedding planning she almost ruins turks career by uninviting his boss without even consulting him on it.   He said she could uninvite people and they barely knew the boss at the time. It made sense. Maybe she could have asked, but honestly I think it was the boss that seriously overreacted. Why should she even care?   She makes massive deals out of things turk does that are entirely within character for him to do.   ...Like when? Besides acting immature and keeping him in line? Which later in the series, you see he really appreciates that shit their relationship. She helps him learn there's a time and place for goofing off.   She views sex as a weapon to get her way with turk as she is constantly threatening to take it away from him, also implying that a woman couldn't want sex just for herself, she also uses it to bribe him into doing things he has said he doesn't want to do.   Usually only if he's acting like a man child. He's not entitled to sex, either. I don't recall her implying that a woman can't enjoy sex. Is it so terrible that her life doesn't revolve around sex? Turk doesn't have to give in. Sue her for knowing he cares about sex more than whatever she's asking of him. It's ultimately his choice. Sure, it's not the coolest thing to do, but damn if it isn't effective on him. If he had that big of a problem with it, he wouldn't stay so obviously it's not that big of a deal.   Once married she begins to change everything to the way she wants ignoring turks wishes and actually at one point says that she makes all the decisions and only let's turk make ones that don't matter, so it's always up to turk to be the one compromising instead of her.   She doesn't ignore Turk's wishes. She even concedes to getting scooters instead of a car. Then guess what? Turk realized she was right and traded them in. Turk trusts her judgement. Yet again, if it really mattered that much or he right she was making a wrong decision, he'd fight her on it more.   She also basically bribes/forces turk into having a baby by getting rid of all her birth control and being like ""we are having a baby"" regardless of whether turk feels ready.   She was coaxing him into the idea. She could have handled it better, but so could he. Sneaking her birth control? You realize that this situation was 100% included only for comedic effect, right? She eventually convinces him through communicating like adults and then he's totally on board.   She also states that he doesn't even have to show up in raising the kid until it's time to teach him or her sports.   So? Did anybody expect her to actually mean that? She does, for the most part. Her point was that she was okay with being the main caretaker.   A statement put to lie when she later at the janitors wedding complains at him for never doing anything with the kids. She also once the baby is born stops paying attention to turk, prompting turk to ask why she has to be such a mommy all the time, to which she responds because she is a mommy all the time. But she is also a wife all the time, and for the most part it seems is either dismissive or ignoring turks needs and wants.   This is a fair point, but is something that happens in real life a lot. Raising children isn't a walk in the park. It can be difficult to juggle the two. They work it out through talking.   In general she is manipulative and judgemental and not that nice of a person.   Manipulative, a little. But not as bad as some of the other characters. And almost always with their best interests in mind. Judgmental, no. And she is mostly nice. Where are you getting this?"
Scrubs,3cuftz,DraperWhite,-11,Sat Jul 11 15:15:11 2015 UTC,"First point: care to give an example of a way she tries to change turk and telling him he's wrong being who he is?  Second point: you've never told a friend that he/she probably shouldn't be dating a certain person because the relationship is toxic? It's not being controlling, it's being a good friend. And that Dr Cox,/Jordan relationship early on was extremely toxic.   Third point: lol one that always gets mentioned. That was more lazy writing (hastily make up a reason for a jd subplot) than it was carla being a bitch for the sake of being a bitch.  Fourth point: well... Weddings are usually more important to women than men. Besides, im pretty sure that big screen tv for the NBA playoffs wasnt for her.  Fifth point: Turk can be extremely.immature, its normal for a person to want their partner to grow as a person.   Sixth point: usually for comedic effect. And thats kind of a really ridiculous reason to hate a character. A tv wife withholding sex for plot purposes... We've never seen THAT before.  Seventh point: Exageration of One od Catla's flaws? Yeah... No other charavter does this on scrubs.   Eith point:Turk is at fault too. Carla is nearing her 40's and turk shouldn't have proposed if he didn't intend to have children when it was clear thats what shes wanted.  Ninth point: its a joke man... Come on.

Scrubs,3cr2qv,blackpuppy9,44,Fri Jul 10 02:25:03 2015 UTC,"Mostly a copy and paste of a comment I did in a previous posting.  It took six episodes to name Dr. Cox fully, in the pilot script his name is Phil, on his badge in press shots it's Paul.  Roy from The Worthless Peons has been played by two different people Philip McNiven (Regular The Blanks member) and Robert Beckwith.  Elliot was meant to be a dude chick, but Sarah Chalke simply couldn't pull it off, Eliza Coupe's Jo eventually became that character.  The Scrubs writers wanted to do an episode where they prescribe medical marijuana to the patient as pain relief, NBC nixed the idea so they went with getting her a Male Prostitute so she could lose her virginity in My Rule of Thumb instead! Male Whores Fine, Weed Bad!  Death is in J.D. last fantasy in the corridor in My Finale, they just never focus on him, he can be seen in one shot. Pretty sneaky Death.  A major influence on the earlier seasons is the book The House of God a fictional account of an early '70s medical intern, lines from the book are quoted in first season, it was suggested reading for the writing staff then.  Fans of Clone High knew Janitors first name for years.  The pilot episode is shot in two different hospitals, the one that features the most in the episode that was pulled down after the pilot was shot and retakes shot in the hospital that became Sacred Heart for the next 8 years.

Scrubs,3chmu3,burnsssss,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:28:40 2015 UTC,Thats so interesting because I liked Carla (mostly - I liked her personality and attitude but I hated how she tried to change Turk / change JD and Turk's relationship) but I fucking HATE Dr. Cox. He's so god damn annoying his rants are stupid he's a complete tool to everyone. I have no idea why anyone in the show puts up with him at all like seriously he treats everyone like crap and jokes about their flaws
Scrubs,3chmu3,Relkihelix,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:35:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on nearly all points. I never liked Carla, but I also think that Judy Reyes is a terrible comedic actor. I also didn't really like Ted, and found some of the ways that they totally ignore his mental illness a bit off. You spend 8 years in a hospital and none of your work colleagues, who are all medical professionals, even seem to a give a shit about it? Seemed weird. Yes, I know that there's plenty of other points to go ""yeah okay, but what about..."" but Ted annoyed me the most. His storylines seemed a little too out of place and a little shark-jumpy for me.  Also, I'm going to get down-voted for this (and probably for above too), but screw it, it's the truth: Just don't watch Season 9, it's complete rubbish and shits all over the previous 8 seasons worth of work."

Dr. Cox, was always awesome, and brought so much joy and pain, and yes, he is a fantastic actor. But I say, don't ruin your experience of the show by diving into Season 9, it's really not worth it at all. It really doesn't have a point."
Scrubs,3chmu3,EmCClapyohands,-1,Wed Jul 8 04:15:25 2015 UTC,"For me the best way to sum up Season 9 was that it's like the producers left their keys in the ignition and a bunch of whiney kids came in took off driving it. The saving grace is JD, Cox, Turk and Elliot all jumped in as it took off speeding away out of control so that not too much damage could be done.  Simply put, it's an awful experience."

Scrubs,3cdu0w,GrapeJuicex,83,Tue Jul 7 03:26:10 2015 UTC,"No. You're hearing Cox's inner monologue, as this version of Ben only exists in Cox's head. He rationally knows JD did nothing wrong, but he breaks down and can't emotionally handle Ben's death.  Ben died 20 minutes after Cox left the hospital. There was nothing that could have been done, it was just poor dumb luck that he became JD's case moments before he died."
Scrubs,3cdu0w,Troolz,39,Tue Jul 7 03:29:38 2015 UTC,"Nope. In a later episode Dr Cox tells JD he has yet to kill a patient  -SPOILERS-  In season 4, episode 4, My First Kill, J.D is paralyzed by fear of getting ""his first kill."" Dr Cox lies to J.D and tells him that he killed Mrs Carter by neglecting to get blood cultures in order to get J.D. to loosen up and have the courage to complete a procedure. Then, later in the episode, Mrs Carter is readmitted to Sacred Heart after crashing her Trans Am into a snack bar and a community pool. Dr Cox is there to admit he lied and tell J.D that he is sure to kill soon.  Dr. Cox: Ooh, did I trick Newbie? [laughing] I did, didn't I! And now of course he has to live in fear of when he will kill. When, when, when when when when when when when when?  J.D.: You know what, I don't appreciate lying.  Dr. Cox: Come on. I know you're scared. A lot of times you feel like a little girl in a big gal's body. But here's the dirty little secret: Fear is good. It keeps you from becoming a crappy doctor. Trick is you just can't let it paralyze you. But don't you worry about a thing, there, Newbie. You're a sure thing to get a kill. In fact, should be any day now!"
Scrubs,3cdu0w,boringnamehere,18,Tue Jul 7 05:01:49 2015 UTC,"The crappy doctor line reminds me of when Dr. Cox tells Turk ego is good for you:   Ego is good, you dumb-ass. It's the reason that guy wants you to be his surgeon, it's the reason that she is borderline attracted to you, and it's the reason she so desperately wants to marry you. Bottom line, in medicine, half of pulling it off is believing you're the biggest, smartest bad-ass of a doctor to ever walk these halls."
Scrubs,3cdu0w,hxrsmurf,4,Tue Jul 7 16:14:56 2015 UTC,"This is a little off-topic, but did JD ever kill anyone in all 9 seasons of the show? I can't think of anyone off the top of my head. All of his patients who died were people who would have died anyway."
Scrubs,3cdu0w,crono09,3,Tue Jul 7 20:07:48 2015 UTC,"Nope. In a later episode Dr Cox tells JD he has yet to kill a patient   JD didn't kill Ben, but this isn't exactly evidence - there are loads of instances of inconsistencies between episodes, characters changing views even within the same season, etc."

Scrubs,3cdu0w,CykoTom,147,Tue Jul 7 21:23:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you watch closely you can see JD strangling the life out of Ben in the background around the five minute mark. Real fucked up shit."

We tried to resuscitate him but there was nothing we could do. I'm sorry.   This is what JD says to Dr Cox around 9 minutes in. You're meant to think it was his patient, Mr Taylor, with the irregular heartbeat. Of course you later realise this was Ben.  The point is that Ben had a sudden heart attack and died. It was no one's fault. Heart attacks are pretty damn fatal."
Scrubs,3cdu0w,hoodie92,12,Tue Jul 7 14:39:50 2015 UTC,"No. Adding to what others have said....  The screw up is Cox's. The screw up is letting Ben travel the globe and not go see a doctor. He is the only one in Ben's life with an influence on him, but he let him go.   Now, its not a major screw up due to the nature of his sickness, but Cox sees it at one."

By calling the episode that, it went along with the charade of the old man with the heart problem was the one that died. Cox telling ben ""The kid screwed up"" was a tell. I think the writers did everything they could to keep that ending something you didn't see coming."

Of course, they don't ask him to move out until midway through season four, so at least three years have passed since that date.  Maybe I'm looking too much into this.

Also I think Ted might be one of my least favorite characters on the show.

The characters were funny (except Lucy imo) and having Cox and Turk around was awesome. I think that, aside from its fatal flaw of being called Scrubs, it suffered a lot from poor writing. A huge part of why we all fell in love with Scrubs was it's ability to balance the comedy and character drama with the exploration of very real, deep stories. None of us can forget Ben's death or Cox's breakdown after losing 3 transplant patients. The season 9 cast lacked a depth that was present in the original cast. I think the only time s9 got close to the same feeling of Scrubs was the episode where Cole took the fall for Lucy. The premise of med school isn't as relatable for an audience as being a doctor and I think it kind of put the writers in a position where they can't create the same depth and complexity in the stories and had to rely more on the humorous storylines. Ultimately I enjoyed season 9 a lot but it wouldn't have gone far as a spin-off without major changes anyway."

Jordan comes in to the hospital for her Ultrasound to reveal the sex of the baby. Turk's recently divorced brother comes to stay for the weekend. Meanwhile, an old friend of Kelso, Dr Townhend (Dick Van Dyke) puts a patient's life in jeopardy, causing Kelso to question his obsolete methods as a doctor."

Scrubs,3bptx9,The_Third_Three,6,Wed Jul 1 04:57:05 2015 UTC,It's a damned good episode.
Scrubs,3bo4tk,blackpuppy9,28,Tue Jun 30 19:53:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, according to the extras on the dvds he did most of his stunts.    Also here: Funnyman Zach Braff has been told to ease off comedic stunts in his show SCRUBS after rupturing a disc in his back.     He says, ""It'll heal. I have been doing most of my own stunts on Scrubs, and this season I'll probably have to back off while it heals."
Scrubs,3bo4tk,marcosdpr,24,Tue Jun 30 20:48:27 2015 UTC,They used them for some stunts.  In the episode My First Step (S2E7) they use stunt doubles for the bungee jump scene.  Those doubles later got married to each other.  It is clearly Braff at first in this stunt but almost certainly not him completely engulfed in flames.  I remember from the DVD commentary that they mention their fondness for a certain type of pratfall because it was easier to have stunt people take the fall then have the actor pop up (I think they called it a cowboy cutaway but I can't find that term anywhere else).
Scrubs,3bo4tk,tikael,7,Tue Jun 30 21:14:46 2015 UTC,"If I remember right, that's called a ""cowboy switch""."
Scrubs,3bo4tk,TraceurZer0,2,Wed Jul 1 04:06:08 2015 UTC,Yeah they've done it a few times. One that comes to mind is when Kelso gets kicked out of a moving car in front of the hospital.
Scrubs,3bo4tk,Xixii,6,Sat Jul 4 23:40:47 2015 UTC,There was a few things about the actors loving to do their own falls but it was the baby stuff. The major stunts were never the actors
Scrubs,3bo4tk,clarity6406,2,Tue Jun 30 20:11:52 2015 UTC,"I actually saw this today. When Turk, JD, and Carla have their scooter gang, ""turk and jd"" are stunt doubles. I'm fairly certain JD is a woman.   It's S4E1(Shitty quality and you can't see them).. but this is hilarious hahaha"
Scrubs,3bo4tk,hax0rmax,5,Wed Jul 1 03:02:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. I don't have evidence, I've just paid attention during stunt scenes, and it always looks like they try very hard to keep the faces unclear or out of the shot."

Scrubs,3bo4tk,9me123,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:32:49 2015 UTC,It's pretty clear in a whole lot of the slapstick stuff that it isn't him.
Scrubs,3bo4tk,mindsnare,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:41:05 2015 UTC,I actually don't like actors that insist on doing all the stunts themselves. They risk to damage the whole production of the film / series and therefore also he jobs of people working on it.   Stunts should always be done by professional stuntmen not some actor that wants to look badass because he does his stunts himself.
Scrubs,3bo4tk,CalimeroX,16,Tue Jun 30 20:32:07 2015 UTC,"Sometimes the actors are trained and can also be stunt doubles themselves. Just because theyre actors doesn't mean they're not smart or skilled enough to pull off their own stunts, and it's not always about boosting their egos."
Scrubs,3bo4tk,jordan_bar,2,Tue Jun 30 21:42:25 2015 UTC,"I know that, but if a person is playing the main charakter of a movie, even though he is a trained stuntman himself, it would be better to use an extra stuntman. If something happens to the main actor the whole production is troubled."
Scrubs,3bo4tk,CalimeroX,3,Wed Jul 1 17:58:19 2015 UTC,"Danny Trejo once said, that he would rather use a stunt guys because he doesn't want to risk the people on the crews job to just show that he has big nuts"
Scrubs,3bo4tk,Wongafied,2,Wed Jul 1 16:56:05 2015 UTC,"And I think that's just right. Doesn't matter if an actor is also a stuntman. Stunts can always go wrong, and if that happens it damages the whole production.  An extra stuntman can be replaced, the main actor of a movie not so much.."

Scrubs,3basuy,CreamyGoodnss,15,Sat Jun 27 15:10:59 2015 UTC,Just an esthetic decision. And I decided that each character was interesting enough on their own not to be associated with others characters. in my humble opinion.
