CatastrophicFailure,3e2h6d,shapu,10,Tue Jul 21 18:22:51 2015 UTC,Can someone explain what happened here? Because I am very confused...
CatastrophicFailure,3e2h6d,ThatAstronautGuy,54,Tue Jul 21 15:18:25 2015 UTC,"Everything vibrates. Think of your car, the vibration through the steering wheel, comes from the steering, comes through the tires, from the road. EVERYTHING vibrates.   Now think about a helicopter. There are a lot more vibrations, and you know at what Frequency (hz) that things vibrate at. When you measure vibration in a helicopter, you can trim vibration down to a single component that is vibrating at a certain hertz / frequency. Even down to the smallest gear in a gearbox or engine. Its that precise. We even group components that vibrate at a certain frequency together. Say, 1R - For every rotor blade that passes over this component, it vibrates one cycle, 5R - Something that vibrates either 5 times per blade (or more likely) 1 cycle per blade. Things like sponsons etc will be 5R. Every blade that passes over them, causes one that perhaps has attachment bushes worn, will vibrate. Then we also look into Drive Shaft Vibrations (1S), Tail Vibrations (1T) and everything else in between. If you want me to bore you, I can go into further details!  Now, to remove vibration from an aircraft, you make sure you don't have anything vibrating the same frequency, and do your best to limit the vibration through anti-vibration mountings, Active Response Struts and the like. Anything to reduce fatigue on the pilots and equipment. We even have equipment that senses what the vibration will be, and put in a counter vibration to counteract it. Meaning a smooth as possible flight.   Although, sometimes it doesn't always work out like this. Occasionally, all those vibrations make a certain frequency, which matches the other frequencies. You can feel this. It feels horrendous. Your eyeballs nearly shake out of your head and you can not focus on anything. Not even the cockpit screens in front of you. Imagine being drunk and the room spinning. Times that by about 50. There we are. Disgusting.   The vibrations that match don't get better, they get worse. This causes all vibrations to rapidly increase, leading to the weakest component to fail. Whether its a rotor blade that's at the end of its life, or a transmission system. This leads to a catastrophic failure of a flight critical component.  You can get around Ground Resonance - Immediate reduction in Nr (Rotor Speed) or immediate Take Off are the best options. Anything to change the frequency of the vibrations. That's why, whenever a helicopter goes for a Ground Run with its rotors engaging or rotating, it has to be in a flight worthy condition. Just incase it has to take off.   For added bonus points - That video from Boeing from the chinnook - They weren't looking for Ground Resonance(IIRC). They were having issues with the transmissions system that runs between the two rotor disks. It just happened, and they left it to run as it's rarely captured on film. It's a great training aid. The ground resonance started because of incorrect Tyre pressures. Yep, Tyre Pressures. If the aircraft had not been chain lashed to the ground, it would of probably jumped up and corrected the vibration a little, stopping the destruction. But hey, it's only $30,000,000+ right? Ha!  I hope I've made that as clear as possible, Vibration Theory is a pretty big subject, looking at Sine Waves and peaks on graphs and things. I hope you understand it a bit better. Anyway, Vibrations = Bad (sometimes!).  source - I'm a Helicopter Flight Engineer!!  Edit : I found the side video of it, and it greater shows the oscillations in the airframe (watch the back end!), the speed at which they build, and just how dangerous things out of balance can actually be.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RihcJR0zvfM"
CatastrophicFailure,3e2h6d,Phoenix492,4,Tue Jul 21 17:17:07 2015 UTC,The related video of the little Schweizer helicopter suffering from ground resonance (starting around 5:40) conveys a little of how much it must suck to experience from in the cockpit.

CatastrophicFailure,3e2h6d,TotesMessenger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:16:03 2015 UTC,Is that why radial airplane engines always need to have an odd number of cylinders?
CatastrophicFailure,3e2h6d,BuckyDuster,3,Tue Jul 21 22:05:42 2015 UTC,"From wikipedia:  Four-stroke radials have an odd number of cylinders per row, so that a consistent every-other-piston firing order can be maintained, providing smooth operation. For example, on a five-cylinder engine the firing order is 1, 3, 5, 2, 4 and back to cylinder 1. Moreover, this always leaves a one-piston gap between the piston on its combustion stroke and the piston on compression. The active stroke directly helps compress the next cylinder to fire, making the motion more uniform. If an even number of cylinders were used, an equally timed firing cycle would not be feasible.[1]"

CatastrophicFailure,3e2h6d,madagent,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:20:00 2015 UTC,"So, in a short form: Something was screwy in the heli, they let it run (as part of?) trying to figure it out, things started vibrating at the right frequency, and bam, Catastrophic Failure.  Things vibrating at the right frequency, more or less, magnifies any shaking from the vibrations. As more things hit that frequency, the more it magnifies.  Since it was tied to the ground, the vibrations in the heli wouldn't have ended themselves, leaving it in a position generating that key frequency, so a relatively large part of it hit that frequency, and it tore itself apart."

CatastrophicFailure,3e2h6d,PingPing88,4,Tue Jul 21 15:39:26 2015 UTC,Ground resonance is an imbalance in the rotation of a helicopter rotor when the blades become bunched up on one side of their rotational plane and cause an oscillation in phase with the frequency of the rocking of the helicopter on its landing gear.    I know some of those words
CatastrophicFailure,3e2h6d,originalusername99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:02:04 2015 UTC,"That makes so much sense.  If a couple blades are allowed to operate closer together, youll get an offset lift force that rotates around the craft creating an oscillation. Now I need to learn why helicopters even have drag hinges.  Down the wikipedia hole I go  edit: neat.  it's just a way of dealing with conservation of angular momentum when the blades bend under load and change the effective radius of the blade within the plane of rotation.  Without the hinges, the blade would try to bend the rotor head."
CatastrophicFailure,3e2h6d,electricheat,3,Tue Jul 21 22:25:29 2015 UTC,"Props rotate at resonant frequency for the helicopter chassis, helicopter vibrates more and more strongly as the vibrations are reinforced by the rotation, helicopter breaks.

The reason it came up is because we were purifying the hydraulic systems because there was water contamination.   The reason they have us do that is because a flight back in the day crashed after the pilot's claimed to have lost control of the aircraft (the flight controls are hydraulic) and they crashed in a field. The investigators only explanation of how the flight controls might have locked up in this situation is water contamination in the  flight control hydraulic system. My platoon sergeant who is a real guru about these things, firmly believes the reason for the crash is that the pilots lost their orientation in the clouds and didn't realize they had gone inverted. After the crash they decided to lie to save their jobs, and say the controls locked up.  Anyway that aircraft was partially rebuilt but never made airworthy again, (I think the crew was grounded too) and then later used for testing like in the video you see here.  TL;DR I had to spend hours purifying hydraulic fluid because officers lied.   </rant>"

During the instrumented hydrostatic collapse of a decommissioned US diesel submarine at a depth of 1000-feet, the velocity of the intruding water-ram was measured as about 1650 mph (Mach 2.2).

Edit:     Based on imagery of the wreck, the water-jet created by the initial breaching of the THRESHER pressure-hull nearly instantaneously tore that structure, both longitudinally and vertically into six major sections. The velocity of the water-jet at the calculated collapse depth of 2400-feet (1070 psi) was about 2600 mph (Mach 3.5). Thus, the condition of the wreck also supports the conclusion the pressure-hull collapsed in less than 100 ms; there was no gradual flooding of a still-intact pressure-hull."

Had the us sunk Kursk Russia would not left the evidence on the sea bed, they would have recovered the nose and gone through it with a fine toothed comb. Torpedoing another nation's warship is an act of war, after all, being able to prove a US torpedo sunk one of their subs during a war game would have given Moscow carte blaunch to march across the iron curtain and the bering strait with everything they had.  They never did that, so i doubt the Kremlin ever suspected a us torp. A collision perhaps, but not an aggressive act, and going to war, potentiallu thermonuclear war given the two parties in question, over a naval fender bender isnt something any nation wants to do."
CatastrophicFailure,3dxzhm,CarbonKat,2,Tue Jul 21 06:04:44 2015 UTC,"Putin is too intelligent to go to war with the US. It was much more of an advantage to ask for money and close that whole ordeal. You must not be familiar with Russian engineering. Might I remind you which nation has the safest space record? Which nation is the only one who can, in 2015, send humans in space? Those torpedoes are used by the Chinese ( the least safety oriented country of all) and Iran ( not a lead exemple of safety codes and regulation I think) and not a single problem ever happened. In the Game of geopolitics, war is not always the option, like USA seems to think. Russia proved that greatly by making sure the US was by gonna bomb Syria and help ISIS too much at the same time two years ago. I'll look for a source, but I don't think the USA even denies having submarine in the area, just that they weren't involved in the Kursk doom. After all, the Memphis or Toledo I don't remember, was having ""long scheduled maintenance"" in Norway 3 days after the sink.  The Kursk was firing a dummy torpedo. The coincidence that this dummy torpedo was the one to leak h2o2 blowing up other torpedoes seems a bit far fetched to me.  Russia absolutely knows it cannot beat the USA in regular war, and understood it was kind of a sad misunderstanding. Nobody can beat the USA at regular war, but now, everyone knows you just have to wait for them to come to your home, and do some nice and cheap guerrilla that you can hold for years to beat them.  I sure hope no president in his right mind would start sending nukes for a hundred lost lives.  Remember when that American frigate gunned down a civilian jetliner by mistake? Did war happen? And when a soviet mig-25 intercepted a Korean airliner and shot it out if the sky because the craft veered off route and entered it's airspace? Nobody thinks it was a malfunctioning American made torpedo  that exploded in this plane. And nobody went to war either.  What is better? A useless submarine that you built just to keep industry aloft and try to make your economusee survive as well as 118 sailors, or the money and economical support of powerful USA?  I'm not the one to believe ""conspiration"" theories but this one seem logical to me! And its not even a conspiration, just an honest mistake, but you cannot tell a whole nation that its lives are just worth a mistake."

CatastrophicFailure,3dwg7e,Aspergers1,4,Tue Jul 21 00:58:32 2015 UTC,"Hoses are incredibly strong, especially hoses rated to withstand high pressure. I'd say those hoses are rated for quite high internal pressure which means they would be very thick rubber with some sort of internal braided metal structure. The tank on the other hand is only thin metal, and because it has a large surface area with no ribbing or anything to really reinforce its shape, it doesn't take much to collapse it under a vacuum. Think about how hard it would be to suck the air out of a empty coke can until it implodes - not that hard..maybe even possible with the human lungs. Now take a garden hose with one end blocked off and try the same test. The smaller, more thicker garden hose would require a much greater vacuum to overcome its structural integrity. There's a lot more science going on above but that's more or less why the tank lets go before the hoses. The more worrying question to me is, why is there no relief valve to stop this sort of thing happening? I mean, the trucks whole purpose is to suck..you'd think they would have safety measures to stop this sort of event happening.  Edit: Spelling"

These things make little to no sense from an evolutionary perspective! If these weakpoints exist, and evolution hasn't done much to get rid of them, that means that we must have refrained from attacking these points in fights, which is weird!

I added rule 5 in the sidebar earlier to try to tame some of the submissions people were making. I'm thinking that those posts could simply be tagged as NSFW to serve as a filter, unless someone has a better idea. My biggest dilemma has been where to draw the line, people died in the Hindenburg video though you can't really see it. Other videos might depict people being seriously injured but not actually fatal injuries."
CatastrophicFailure,3dpeg9,flaillomanz,16,Sat Jul 18 05:04:34 2015 UTC,"May I add my opinion to this potential debate?     Just remember that there will be all sorts of people of varying sensitivity reaching this sub since it has been trending recently.  Please note also that any mention of a filter herein simply hides the thumbnail of the submission and prefaces the submission title with the reason for it being filtered. Additionally, the titles I made up for these are not meant to be taken as-is, since they are somewhat inaccurate.  Potential filters are as follows:  A ""GRAPHIC/INJURY"" filter for incidents with clearly visible human injuries (a tame example would be this submission, notable due to the whiplash causing the ground crew to go head over heels.) which have been proven as nonfatal.    A ""DEATH"" filter for content where there was loss of life which is not 'seen' on camera.     A ""NSFW-DEATH"" filter on anything which actually shows people dying or dead, where bodies can be seen onscreen, or where a casualty is glimpsed during the catastrophe.    Sometimes it may be difficult to choose a category. For example, this submission clearly shows at least one man falling free of the tower, but it is only a few blurred frames. I'd personally call this one ""NSFW-DEATH""."
CatastrophicFailure,3dpeg9,confluencer,2,Sat Jul 18 07:29:11 2015 UTC,How about just these two:  [GRAPHIC] = your first one  [NSFL] = your second one  [NSFL] [GRAPHIC] = third one
CatastrophicFailure,3dpeg9,confluencer,2,Sat Jul 18 09:43:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think the ""People died/were seriously injured but you can't see it"" filter is necessary.  For example, if it's a video of a helicopter breaking in two pieces, it's obvious that's a very dangerous situation, even if no one was injured in that particular video.  Say a fireworks factory explodes, maybe people were injured, maybe not... this sub isn't about that and we don't need to know - we're just here to see the fireworks.  As long as no one was obviously seriously injured/killed, it doesn't need a filter.  I suppose the counter-argument is that some people might not be ethically comfortable with enjoying a video where people are known to have been hurt, but I think that there are situations that are always dangerous and potentially lethal and, as /u/Yebrah said, 'large industrial machinery breaks down people are going to get hurt. It isn't if, it's when.'  So a 'you can't see it, but it actually happened this time' video tag is just particularly gruesome in and of itself.  I hope this sub won't become about the gruesomeness and stays focused on cool things breaking in spectacular ways, (and the danger is self-implied and/or discussed in the comments).  So I suggest only two filters.  A 'Graphic Injury' filter, as /u/flaillomanz did, and a 'Graphic NSFL' filter."

I mean, it's fine if the narrator tells you, because you watched a video of an incident that was inherently dangerous.

CatastrophicFailure,3dpmjc,FreeToEvolve,6,Sat Jul 18 13:58:29 2015 UTC,"My guess would be that they were ahead of the explosion.  Likely the huge fireball was caused by the wings, which store the fuel, and engines getting torn off by all the trees and then combusting.  However, the fuselage would have far more inertia due to its massive weight and would also go through the trees with far less resistance than the wings.  So the fuselage is probably pretty far ahead of where you see the fireball in the video, which saved the lives of those passengers."

I knew right away what was burning; I frequently passed that welding supply company going from I-35 southbound to I-30 eastbound and sometimes thought ""Man, if that place ever caught fire..."". What horrified me was that the SPCA's main animal shelter was very close to the site of the fire. (The building received minor damage, and the staff had evacuated the animals to the opposite side of the building; they were frightened but unharmed).  We all stood gawking out of the windows at the inferno, saw at least one burning tank land on the Jefferson street viaduct, saw them eventually close the interstates, which really tied up traffic.

CatastrophicFailure,3dnxgd,DarkTheEpic,6,Fri Jul 17 21:31:05 2015 UTC,"I have some background information on this.   It was being serviced by an independent company (not Vestas). The way you stop a wind turbine is by turning the blades out of the wind, in this case just the tip of the blades. This is the only way to stop a turbine. Now, inside the nacelle (the house on top) there is a parking brake, its a brake disc with a hydraulic caliper just like a car, just bigger. You engage this when the turbine is at a complete still so you can service it without the small movement from turned blades. It can't stop the turbine.  These guys engaged the internal brake before the turbine was completely stopped, causing a whiplash effect along the blades and causing the tip of the blades to fall off and thereby removing the stopping power. They left the turbine.  It ran for several hours and the final failure was probably due to the main bearing failing cause the hub to angle the blades into the tower. Even though they are only glassfiber and the tower is steel, it was enough."

CatastrophicFailure,3dm3ty,SaintNickPR,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:52:26 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make any sense, not when you state it like that.  I'm no crash investigator, but there are several scenarios that can unfold:   One of the rotor blades or other shrapnel destroys the tail boom. This seems to be all too common. As the main rotor disintegrates, it instantly removes most of the load on the gearbox's output shaft. The turbine has no time to react to this, and instantly overspeeds. As the tail rotor is driven through a variable speed pick-off from the gearbox (usually), the tail rotor is instantly subject to huge torques that work to overspeed it. Due to its inertia, and the aerodynamic forces if it has enough time to spin up, the tail boom reaction (drive countertorque and aero reactions) will go off limits and cause it to crumple and/or the tail driveshaft will break up and slice the boom.   If there wasn't a turbine overspeed and the rotor didn't touch the boom, the tail would have survived."

CatastrophicFailure,3dm3ty,HotTyre,3,Fri Jul 17 16:28:10 2015 UTC,Common commercial long line operations. Helicopters are often used to transport heavy or awkward things. Wires are almost invisible to pilots especially since the pilot was operating so low and with high obstructions its safe to say he was probably focused on watching where hew as hovering.   Proper ground crew briefing is essential when operating around helicopters for this very reason. The aircraft crew got lucky how the helicopter crashed with the cockpit in the up position.

CatastrophicFailure,3dneo8,Murralis,13,Fri Jul 17 18:08:13 2015 UTC,"At approximately 1:36 AM on April 26 1986 Reactor #4 of the V.I. Lenin Nuclear Power Station suffered a meltdown during a test. The explosion was caused by a flaw in the reactors design (overlooked by all staff and engineers) as well as the overseers incompetence.   The white grain on the photo is not because of the older camera. That is the result of large amounts of radiation tampering with the film. This picture was taken by a helicopter pilot the morning after the explosion.  If you would like to learn more about arguably the worst man-made disaster in the history of the planet I would suggest:  /u/R_Spc's Imgur album it's easy to read and pretty short. It goes over a brief history of the area pre and post disaster!   As well as ""Chernobyl by Andrew Leatherbarrow"" for a more complete and longer work. It can be read in it's entirety here and is a great read on not only the meltdown but also the authors personal visit to the reactor and the nearby towns of Припять (Pripyat) and Чорнобиль (Chernobyl - The reactor took on the name from the town post-meltdown)  Edit: Also a big shoutout to /r/Chernobyl!"

A helicopter pilot came in to observe the scene cause he heard there was an explosion. He took many pictures before flying off. At this point most of the scientists still believed the reactor to be in-tact (despite numerous eye-witness stories that it wasn't), and they believed the radiation to be nowhere near as severe as it was.

The crash was captured on video and was shown repeatedly on news broadcasts throughout the world.[1]  The subsequent investigation concluded that the crash was primarily attributable to three factors: Holland's personality and behavior, USAF leaders' delayed or inadequate reactions to earlier incidents involving Holland, and the sequence of events during the aircraft's final flight. The crash is now used in military and civilian aviation environments as a case study in teaching crew resource management. It is also often used by the U.S. Armed Forces during aviation safety training as an example of the importance of compliance with safety regulations and correcting the behavior of anyone who violates safety procedures.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Fairchild_Air_Force_Base_B-52_crash"

CatastrophicFailure,3dm5w7,hurenkind5,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:07:09 2015 UTC,It killed 12 but all those guilty were given promotions.
CatastrophicFailure,3dm5w7,Millsy1,5,Mon Jul 20 15:42:54 2015 UTC,Nowadays we have much safer options for that job like the V-22 Osprey.
CatastrophicFailure,3dm5w7,Doofe_N7,4,Fri Jul 17 15:55:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure i'd call the V-22 that safe, given it's pretty spotty track record."
CatastrophicFailure,3dm5w7,Doofe_N7,6,Fri Jul 17 16:03:00 2015 UTC,"It had a lot of accidents in testing, but since hitting the fleet it's actually had like the second or third lowest incident rate among Marine Corps aircraft, and the best safety rate among rotary-wing aircraft.  http://lexingtoninstitute.org/v-22-is-the-safest-most-survivable-rotorcraft-the-marines-have/?a=1&c=1171"
CatastrophicFailure,3dm5w7,hasslefree,2,Fri Jul 17 16:10:49 2015 UTC,Yeah? Do you have figures on that? Because statistics can be mighty misleading sometimes..
CatastrophicFailure,3dm5w7,Doofe_N7,4,Sat Jul 18 00:31:24 2015 UTC,"http://breakingdefense.com/2011/08/the-v-22-safer-than-helos-effective-worth-buying/   The redesigned, retested Osprey’s safety record is so good that it’s actually the safest rotorcraft the Marine Corps flies, based on Class A mishaps per 100,000 flight hours. Those are official Naval Safety Center statistics.  while the Marines and Air Force have flown their V-22s for roughly 20,000 combat hours since 2007, not one has been shot down   http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a7663/how-safe-is-the-mv-22-osprey-8036684/   The Osprey has logged more than 100,000 flight hours in some of the most inhospitable conditions imaginable with a safety record that's actually considered the safest among Marine Corps rotorcraft.   http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/world/middle-east/article24748960.html   The rate for Class A flight mishaps – those that involve death or permanent disability and/or more than $2 million in damage – is 1.48 per 100,000 hours of flying time since the aircraft was declared operational in 2007, according to Marine Corps spokesman Capt. Richard Ulsh."
CatastrophicFailure,3dm5w7,hasslefree,2,Sat Jul 18 00:57:59 2015 UTC,Thank you.
CatastrophicFailure,3dm5w7,Millsy1,2,Sat Jul 18 01:03:31 2015 UTC,"The Osprey is a good example of poor public opinion that continues despite correcting the problems.    That said, I'm still never flying in a DC-10 or DC-11 -_-"
CatastrophicFailure,3dm5w7,SpiderPigUK,3,Mon Jul 20 15:41:57 2015 UTC,"Huh, TIL. I guess it hasn't really got over the stigma just yet."
CatastrophicFailure,3dm5w7,Thunderstorm912,2,Fri Jul 17 16:13:30 2015 UTC,"So, what was this mean to do exactly?"
CatastrophicFailure,3dm5w7,SpiderPigUK,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:04:34 2015 UTC,"Goal was to reduce the need for a long runway for takeoff/landing. C130 needs close to 1200 feet for landing, this would reduce it to a much lower distance."

This pilot was known for being a bit of an ass and had nearly crashed on multiple occasions prior. You can find the investigation's report online. (On mobile so I didn't try to look it up...)"
CatastrophicFailure,3dpbp9,SmartToaster,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:15:54 2015 UTC,"The entire events surrounding this video are incredibly interesting reading.  The main fault of the crash is pilot error, but there is a bunch of things that lead up to the crash that make this a case that is actively taught in military training even today."

CatastrophicFailure,3doafn,team-periwinkle,6,Sat Jul 18 02:25:52 2015 UTC,"It looks like OP went out and found the worst possible copy of this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4WPSZojtyE  Which is a series of destructive tests being performed on a decommissioned ski lift in Winter Park, CO. Apparently they were replacing the lift, and basically let a bunch of engineers perform tests on it and film the results. I think it's targeted at the ski lift manufacturing industry.  The whole thing is pretty awesome, though.  EDIT: Apparently the full video I linked was submitted to this sub a few days back; here's the post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/CatastrophicFailure/comments/3dc5sm/chair_lift_destructive_test_goes_wrong/"

CatastrophicFailure,3doafn,deedoedee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:33:20 2015 UTC,A lift operator once told me that if you are ever on a lift that rolls back more than 5 or 10 feet.   Jump.
CatastrophicFailure,3dmjgu,sphks,3,Fri Jul 17 14:07:17 2015 UTC,"Yes this was pretty tragic. At first it seemed like an 'innocent' fire at a fireworks storage facility. People were coming from all around to watch, like the disaster tourists they were. We were watching it live on TV. People in their houses were mainly scared that the fire would go out of control and their house would catch on fire as well. Little did they know about the explosion that was going to follow, that was going to completely level an entire neighborhood. Despite the level of destruction 'only' 23 people died, including 4 firemen.   Before people wonder, why is there a fireworks storage facility in the middle of a residential area? If I'm not mistaken, it's actually the other way around. The big question is, why was there a residential area build around a fireworks storage facility? Most likely, because it was cheap to do so.     edit: woops, wrong pic."
CatastrophicFailure,3dmjgu,Dicethrower,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:20:52 2015 UTC,"Holy hell, that explosion near the end reminded me of threads"
CatastrophicFailure,3dmjgu,sneakygingertroll,3,Fri Jul 17 20:18:56 2015 UTC,"The explosion destroyed over a hundred acres of city. 200 houses were reduced to rubble, 1500 damaged to the extend that they were declared unfit for people to live in. Because of the long period between the initial fire and the ultimate total destruction of the fireworks warehouse most people had left the immediate area, and 'just' 23 people were killed and a thousand injured.   Yeah, it's just like some shit movie from hollywood."
