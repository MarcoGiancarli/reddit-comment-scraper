ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,Gohte,4,Tue Jul 21 00:32:23 2015 UTC,AlphaEpsilon1 for Mod 2015
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,SonnytheFlame,9,Tue Jul 21 00:52:35 2015 UTC,I'd be happy to mod. The SLP would love some representation in the modding of this reasonable and unbiased sub.
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,radicaljackalope,5,Tue Jul 21 00:54:00 2015 UTC,I'm honestly not sure how (or why) party affiliation should have any bearing on mod status.
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,Eilanyan,4,Tue Jul 21 00:07:38 2015 UTC,"Because it historically has been to prevent partisan bias, 1 mod per major party. Now it appears we are following that but only if we exclude the one (or two, again I think SLP are too inactive) they don't like."
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,radicaljackalope,2,Wed Jul 22 01:10:29 2015 UTC,"I am still pretty new here, but this doesn't feel like a pressing need or something worth fighting over. I have not seen any cause to assume partisan bias in mod activity. I would say it should be based on need and merit, and honestly wouldn't flinch if there was even less representation.  If we start from the position that mods will be biased, we are going to have a bad time. And logically, what could a mod from party A even do if they felt the mod from party B was being unfair to party A? Retaliate against other members? That would be a clear abuse of their position."
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,Eilanyan,4,Tue Jul 21 00:18:48 2015 UTC,"It's so if a Lib mod bans a Dem member the comittee deciding if its appropriate has a Dem on it so if it was for being ""a statist"" it can be more fairly discussed."
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,radicaljackalope,8,Tue Jul 21 00:20:05 2015 UTC,"I guess I am just under the impression that punishment should be based on rules violations and not partisan issues. My, admittedly unexperienced, guess is that a relatively diverse mod team as there apparently is, they should be able to segregate out partisan abuses of power from legitimate rules violations.  Maybe it is naive, but I tend to assume people are reasonable on my better days."
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,Gohte,3,Tue Jul 21 00:28:43 2015 UTC,"If mod bias exists, it exists in the form of unconscious lenience against members of one's own ideology. As far as I understand it, mods talk to each other before bans are handed out.  I got banned for busting sick moves on the Libertarian party, Septimus was attacked for mod bias because he used to be in the GLP and I got a relatively shorter ban than Smitty did, but it turned out that DNKTL decided how long to ban me.  Just keeps things in check.  That said, the ideologies in the ALP are decently represented by the Democrat and GLP mods, but I would suggest a SLP mod to specifically represent Eilanyan."
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,NateLooney,4,Tue Jul 21 00:34:24 2015 UTC,Try to keep language professional please.
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,Eilanyan,3,Tue Jul 21 00:38:09 2015 UTC,"so if it was for being ""a statist"" it can be more fairly discussed.     Bans for political views are unethical and wrong. Bans are only used in the case of violations from the subreddit rules."
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,NateLooney,3,Tue Jul 21 00:42:11 2015 UTC,Like how I've been called a fascist three times and insulted differently another 2-3 times by same person... Are Sept and DK not online?

ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,radicaljackalope,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:58:58 2015 UTC,"Some people think that every Party should have a mod so that there is no ""Mod Bias,"" i.e. no Republican mod could mean unfair treatment towards Republicans with no possible recourse. I think this concern isn't necessary as long as we are confident and wise in how we pick our mods, but I can understand why some see it as a needed feature."
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,oughton42,2,Tue Jul 21 01:00:01 2015 UTC,"Understandable, sure. I don't see how ""no bias"" would logically follow, though. For the perception of fairness, however, I could certainly see the appeal."
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,radicaljackalope,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:03:45 2015 UTC,It came mostly when the old Republicans (pre-exodus) were whining about Septimus' alleged mod bias which was completely unjustified as he was not affiliated with a Party and there was no sign of treating GLs better than the Republicans.
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,ben1204,8,Tue Jul 21 00:21:09 2015 UTC,"Ah. Without the context and without being there, it is obviously impossible for me to judge. But from where I sit now, I have yet to have the impression of favoritism or impartiality."

From the ALP to the world (2): We hope you understand why we may feel unrepresented in the mod team. We're a growing party with an active base. We'll live either way, but we hope you recognize that our intuition of unfairness isn't entirely unfounded."
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,leftdigiteffect,6,Tue Jul 21 00:07:08 2015 UTC,Do you have no moderator position? With /u/Morallesson even the Distributists have one.
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,WellHeresMyFourthAcc,3,Tue Jul 21 00:10:25 2015 UTC,"We don't have one at the moment. It's not likely to present a huge issue, as the mod team is a primarily fair and hardworking council. But, since the mod team doles out punishments and has significant decision-making power, we feel that equal party representation may be the most fair option."
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,Eilanyan,6,Tue Jul 21 02:40:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about the first two, but from what I can tell these are great choices. /u/risen2011 and /u/NateLooney have always come across to me as respectful, professional, and above the partisan bickering. Glad to see them as moderators."
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,risen2011,2,Tue Jul 21 11:24:43 2015 UTC,"Risen literally is doing partisan bickering in this thread and in global greens response, and in talks with my party..."
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,Eilanyan,4,Tue Jul 21 13:38:25 2015 UTC,I don't think jokes are an example of partisan bickering. :|
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,WellHeresMyFourthAcc,2,Mon Jul 20 23:54:47 2015 UTC,"So I make jokes about the horrors of Soviet regimes and their allies, that's fine? I mean we can laugh about how underrepresented fascists are."
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,Eilanyan,6,Mon Jul 20 23:56:00 2015 UTC,"So I make jokes about the horrors of Soviet regimes and their allies, that's fine?   I didn't realize you were joking when you claimed my party was a bunch of Stalinists and Maoists with no room for libertarian socialists like me (and everyone else who showed up to correct you and request that you stop making that claim repeatedly). That makes much more sense.  (As you can see, I'm personally not above the partisan bickering- I just get tired of seeing people lie about my party and then try to claim the moral high ground.)"
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,WellHeresMyFourthAcc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:57:21 2015 UTC,"You can join all you want and I've made sure ads from our party say Libsoc may find GLP more suitable. But hey, is not like the literal trolling Gohte is doing, in this thread no less. Or the press thread where he just got banned for a week."
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,Eilanyan,6,Mon Jul 20 23:59:18 2015 UTC,"Good thing Gohte's not a mod, then. There are some of us who prefer roles where we're more likely to encounter clash- like me, and possibly you. And others who're willing to play the more ""matured"" roles- the ones who spend their time trying to type out professional-ish responses to open letters or spend debate threads (like real politicians) also talking about how much they respect others and throwing out platitudes. I'm saying that I find the two mods in this new expansion that I know of to be more of the second group, and I believe that picking members of that group over more aggressive people like me is a good decision on the part of Septimus."
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,oughton42,6,Tue Jul 21 00:05:39 2015 UTC,"So we just so happen to only have a ""fair representation"" of good people from all the parties but mine and the fascists (that didn't win a seat and is far less active). Okay, I will challenge that but it's logical. Except then I would say Risen is overly aggressive and partisan for that role."
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,risen2011,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:06:59 2015 UTC,"I think Risen has proven themselves to be one of the most mature members of the GLP, and really of the whole sub. I mean, we can argue about some members of the Party but I'm confident that Risen will be a good mod. Heck, one of the first things Risen did as mod was yell at me for making a joke."
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,Eilanyan,4,Tue Jul 21 00:13:43 2015 UTC,"Now I am yelling!  Nah, it's cause the other mods seemed to find a bit of a problem with the comment. Also the James Madison comment erred on the side of unprofessional."
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,WellHeresMyFourthAcc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:15:14 2015 UTC,"Unless there's some mass deletion do I need to post every interaction with him to show why this is not the case. Yes he is amazing compared to Gohte who IMO should be permabanned, but he is no /u/DidNotKnowThatLolz or general ""impartial"" person."
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,Eilanyan,3,Tue Jul 21 00:19:17 2015 UTC,"So we just so happen to only have a ""fair representation"" of good people from all the parties but mine and the fascists    I don't think this is like /r/harrypotter where you need someone from every party on the modteam. The modteam's job is to be non-partisan- I'd be disappointed in /u/risen2011, for example, if he used his moderator role to further the interests of the GLP (and not the interests of the simulation as a whole).  That said, I'm not happy that there isn't any ALP (or even SLP) representation on the modteam. But I don't think that Septimus needs to artificially add that- his main goal should always be to find good mods first and foremost. If they just happen to belong to a certain party, so be it.   Except then I would say Risen is overly aggressive and partisan for that role.   From my perspective, he isn't. Even when he wrote our official response to the Global Greens (I'm glad he took that initiative), he wasn't fond of being particularly aggressive. In fact, he told quite a few of us to ""tone it down"" when we suggested additions to his response; his main goal was to respond to the issue, not attack the Global Greens. Believe me, if he wanted to be aggressive, there was a lot more he could have said- but he didn't.  I'd say the most aggressive part of the response was the tu quoque where we called out some GG member parties on having less environmental legislation than us- and I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say it, but that section wasn't risen's idea and it took a bit of convincing on others' part for it to be included in there after being toned down.  So from my perspective, risen isn't someone who I think is going to hold our party's interests above those of an orderly and well-run simulation. I bet that if I started breaking the rules, risen wouldn't hesitate to ban/suspend me."
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,risen2011,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:25:48 2015 UTC,Except that is how the modding has been done and is blatently being done here with 4 different party represented that weren't before. The only reason we didn't have Lib or Republican mod anymore was cause the former Lib mod went inactive and the party in general was inactive and Rep mod quit sub then his party left it. This is goes back to when GLP was a new party.  I'm sure he could have been nastier. Just cause he was only a 7/10 on the nasty scale doesn't mean it was nice. Especially in his responses to me.
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,Eilanyan,2,Tue Jul 21 00:23:12 2015 UTC,would say Risen is overly aggressive and partisan for that role.   I'll respectfully disagree.
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,Gohte,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:19:15 2015 UTC,That is fine. I do hope though that if I have to challenge the convenient letter of the law that there were no ALP (or SLP cause GLP is all over them now) members chosen you will not be deciding if you are fit to be a mod. Bit of conflict of interest.

ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,Eilanyan,6,Tue Jul 21 00:03:16 2015 UTC,How is that relevant to the user we are discussing?
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,Gohte,3,Tue Jul 21 00:05:58 2015 UTC,I can have my opinion on the party and that was not violating subreddit rules. I also held the ads from party to more open views them my own. If that comment needs to be reported and was missed by mods then I will be open to hearing the case against me and punishment. Should I expect that more often now their is now a mod that has gotten into many a fight with me?
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,NateLooney,2,Tue Jul 21 00:07:47 2015 UTC,but not ALP   What are you talking about? There's already a Democrat on the mod team.
ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,Eilanyan,6,Tue Jul 21 00:08:59 2015 UTC,"Like when we try to make the moderators more fair, by adding distributists but not ALP?

ModelUSGov,3e0b4c,Timanfya,5,Tue Jul 21 00:10:39 2015 UTC,So it's only convient it was one per party not represented and included a junior like MoralLesson (who I think would make a great mod).

On top of all of that it looks very professional.  While I don't think this ruling is a good thing and that it ruled out a great section of the bill, perhaps we can pursue these measures at the state level."
ModelUSGov,3dsid7,rangerheart0,3,Sun Jul 19 03:05:11 2015 UTC,perhaps we can pursue these measures at the state level.   Subsidiarity is a good framework to use in general.
ModelUSGov,3dsid7,MoralLesson,2,Sun Jul 19 03:06:13 2015 UTC,Yeah the Supreme Court is simply doing an amazing job.
ModelUSGov,3dsid7,DidNotKnowThatLolz,9,Mon Jul 20 01:35:10 2015 UTC,"It's a shame the court rejected this incredibly important, helpful,  and beneficial section of the law."
ModelUSGov,3dsid7,TheGreatWolfy,11,Sun Jul 19 01:20:45 2015 UTC,"Although this decision is unfortunate, this does seem to be a proper and substantiated interpretation of the Due Process clause. This particular provision may have to be pushed for at the state level instead."
ModelUSGov,3dsid7,Panhead369,3,Sun Jul 19 01:45:00 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I think this could work in the favor of the 100% publicly-controlled hospitals. By having the partially-public hospitals remain subject to owner control it creates incentive for the workers in the 100% publicly-controlled hospitals to out-compete them. This should create a certain esprit de corps and unity among the workers who will work harder to provide a higher level of service than that provided at the partially-public hospitals. Additionally, if the 100% publicly-controlled hospitals really do provide a higher level of care than those at the partially-public hospitals then we should expect the partially-public hospitals to die out and be replaced with 100% publicly-controlled hospitals anyway."
ModelUSGov,3dsid7,BobJoe25000,2,Sun Jul 19 20:38:43 2015 UTC,"The thing is the (poor) patients will continue to be hurt by private hospital administrators, and doctors and nurses will continue to be overworked and hurt by the hospital administrators. Also fully public hospitals will have to serve the poor who can't afford to fully pay, and will also have to hire more workers, so they will be less profitable, even if it will hurt the poor and the workers. Public hospitals are not guaranteed to win in a free market, let alone our market controlled by big money interests even if they provide better service."
ModelUSGov,3dsid7,TheGreatWolfy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:06:30 2015 UTC,"I see where you are coming from and I think those are all legitimate criticisms however in this case I would rather have a plurality of systems under a variety of management types since I believe this will allow for increased options while still ensuring that everyone has some degree of medical care.   Yes, there will be some adverse affects to this dual system however who is to say there wouldn't be problems under a 100% public system. Consider the following:    Without significant incentive workers may not have any reason to work harder. If they have no competition then they may lapse in their care.  The poor may still be hurt under a 100% public system. If economic planners do not put hospitals in places where there are poor or rural people or if they do not provide sufficient support and emergency services then the poor will still be harmed. A private-public system may make up for these deficits when the state refuses or is unable to provide these services. A public system may not provide sufficient options. For example, if a patient is in need of a rare, cutting-edge, or extremely special type of operation under a 100% public system that patient may not be able to find a hospital which is sufficiently equipped or whose workers are sufficiently trained to provide the service. Under a private-public system there may be a hospital out there whose specific niche in the marketplace is to provide this service.  Those who prefer a religious hospital would be under served with a 100% public system and the existence of these institutions may present a First Amendment issue.    I am not saying that this system is perfect but it provides options and incentives."
ModelUSGov,3dsid7,BobJoe25000,2,Sun Jul 19 23:19:31 2015 UTC,"The law wouldn't apply to entirely private hospitals which eliminates concerns 3 and 4. I don't understand number 2. Insufficient support in poor and rural neighborhoods is a symptom of capitalist greed. I do share concern for number 1, which is why I advocate for power to be shared between the workers and a technocratic board appointed by elected officials."
ModelUSGov,3dsid7,TheGreatWolfy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:36:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think the section was a bad idea, but I would have to agree that the court made the correct decision that it was a violation of the Constitution.

ModelUSGov,3dsid7,jaqen16,4,Sun Jul 19 19:33:32 2015 UTC,"Because of the lack of a severability clause in the law, does that mean the whole thing is invalid? Also, both the majority opinion and the concurring opinion are quite good."
ModelUSGov,3dsid7,MoralLesson,3,Sun Jul 19 01:12:00 2015 UTC,Only the parts designated by the Supreme Court are now invalid.
ModelUSGov,3dsid7,Panhead369,2,Sun Jul 19 01:15:31 2015 UTC,Only the parts designated by the Supreme Court are now invalid.   That appears to be a new precedent in this simulation then -- severability clauses are unnecessary.
ModelUSGov,3dsid7,MoralLesson,3,Sun Jul 19 01:18:44 2015 UTC,"If you or anyone else would like to take the rest of the bill to the Supreme Court as a result of this decision you may, and the Court will decide what its precedent will be.

ModelUSGov,3dsid7,MoralLesson,4,Sun Jul 19 01:51:04 2015 UTC,I don't think that's 100% clear. Perhaps it would be better to check with the Court using what /u/Panhead369 suggested.

ModelUSGov,3dsid7,superepicunicornturd,8,Sun Jul 19 05:12:46 2015 UTC,"It does not matter how beneficial the law is. The supreme court does not and should not care if the law is good or bad, meaningful or useless. It cares if it is constitutional. If you want a law passed, write it so it adheres to the constitution.  The supreme court is not elected, first of all, and as I believe Scalia pointed out numerous times in his dissents, it is not representative at all of the US.   Don't blame the justices for doing what was right. Blame the writers of the original bill for either not writing around the constitutional limitations or not using proper wording."

Maybe this wasn't the best place to comment, but I feel like that's a big issue."
ModelUSGov,3dj521,kingofquave,2,Fri Jul 17 19:15:53 2015 UTC,"There was a cover-up by local ordinaries, and that's why there are bishops and priests in American (and other nations') jails and one on trial in the Vatican.

ModelUSGov,3dj521,MoralLesson,2,Fri Jul 17 19:57:36 2015 UTC,"But the fact that this keeps going on is the problem.

ModelUSGov,3dj521,kingofquave,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:38:43 2015 UTC,"But the fact that this keeps going on is the problem.   It's not like it actually is. I haven't heard of any bishop covering up cases that wasn't from 1950s-2002. Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis have made it a huge part of each of their pontificates to end this problem, institute safeguards against future abuse, and bring perpetrators to justice. If you ask anyone who works or volunteers in a parish, we've all been practically forced to take courses on spotting child abuse and reporting it.   There were thousands accused.   If you look at the Jay Report, significant numbers of accusations could not be substantiated and a larger number of accused priests were dead by the time the accusations came out. We can't really put people behind bars without sufficient evidence (you know, presumption of innocence and all) or when they're dead.   That is a huge problem and it's because the Church covers it up.   Yes, as I said, there were bishops that covered this up -- and several have stood trial and gone to prison, both in the United States and abroad, including in Vatican City itself.

So you don't think gay couples deserve the right to be recognized by a governing body as married? How is that not having anything against them? It's straight up homophobia.   I can't see how you think we are against women.   Maybe the fact that you're all bible thumpers and the bible isn't exactly the most women-friendly.   Liberal social ideology is the driving force behind their objectification.   Well it's a damn good thing the GLP isn't a liberal party.

You've clearly never heard of distributism and need to look it up.   Leftist. Price controls are a leftist economic position, from minimum wage to ""curbing CEO pay.""   There are no price controls there -- look up basic minimum income. It's a more economically efficient, more flexible way to eliminate extreme poverty when compared to traditional welfare, and it also eliminates the possibly of falling through the cracks or discouraging working more due to perverse incentives. It was advocated for by conservatives and Libertarians like Friedrich von Hayek and Milton Friedman. I also said nothing of ""curbing CEO pay"" -- you pulled that out of thin air. In fact, I think most people should be business owners -- whether by owning a small family business or shares in an employee-owned stock company."
ModelUSGov,3dj521,MoralLesson,2,Sat Jul 18 00:45:38 2015 UTC,Interesting.    How about distributism's approach towards the economy?
ModelUSGov,3dj521,the9trances,3,Sat Jul 18 00:47:24 2015 UTC,"How about distributism's approach towards the economy?   Distributism -- sometimes known as the economic policy where everyone is a capitalist -- is the audacious idea that every man should own his own source of wealth production instead of getting all of his wealth by working on the property of the rich or the factories of the state – every man should have the means to support his own family. Every farmer should own his own land and machinery, every plumber his own tools and truck, and every software developer should own his own office and computer. When large-scale production is necessary or more efficient, we support cooperatives and employee-owned stock corporations. We call for banks to be replaced by credit unions. We want the ownership of the means of production to be private and widespread -- not accumulated in the hands of a few capitalists or the government.  Because of the divisiveness of unions, we call for their replacement with guilds. In most instances, this happens by making the workers and the owners the same -- based on the idea that most families should own their own business. These various businesses and professionals would act together for their own benefit -- sharing innovations, training new comers, and regulating their industry. In the instances of small family businesses that have employees outside the family, it would be a gathering of the employers and employees across that sector to innovate together and share ideas, regulate the industry, recognize each other's contributions, and the like. The guild can set common standards for the treatment of workers -- improving their standards and simultaneously ensuring that merely helping employees will not diminish competition in other areas (for they could all be on voluntary, mutually-reached agreement as to the treatment of workers across a sector, decided upon by employers and employees together but still compete on the basis of quality, services, costs, and processes).  We support technical skills being taught through apprenticeship systems established by local and regional guilds. Do you want to be a lawyer? Study under some lawyers. Do you want to be a chemist? Study under some chemists. While I admit this is not possible for every field, it is for most. Currently, universities charge exorbitant rates for simply learning skills – and skills that are often disconnected from the job you want. That is wrong. Apprenticeship systems, besides offering better skills and building connections and communities, are also much cheaper. Universities should be maintained for the pursuit of knowledge and research, not for training employees. It should be a joy to go to history class – and you should not have to stress about grades in a general education course you don’t care about. Universities should be a pastime for most – not the training ground.  The most “liberal” thing about us is probably our environmental policies for we do advocate for broad taxes on environmental degradation and resource exploitation – so that the market can be corrected for the negative externalities such things impose. We support aggressive state-level renewable energy mandate and renewable energy tax credits. We also would like to see an expansion of local recycling programs and legislation to discourage the use of ridiculous amounts of plastic in packaging."

ModelUSGov,3dj521,MoralLesson,5,Thu Jul 16 19:05:54 2015 UTC,"Unless my conception (pun intended) of marriage is different then yours, banning all sex except among married couples would result in net less sex (Well assuming ban is actually followed which LOLno it won't be)."
ModelUSGov,3dj521,Eilanyan,4,Thu Jul 16 19:28:57 2015 UTC,Also not looking to ban sex outside of marriage -- even if I do think it is wrong.
ModelUSGov,3dj521,PresterJuan,4,Thu Jul 16 19:29:43 2015 UTC,"So ideally, net less sex would happen. Sounds like limited sex to me. You are not welcome to my sex party :("
ModelUSGov,3dj521,Eilanyan,3,Thu Jul 16 19:31:18 2015 UTC,"No, ideally, married couples would have more sex, and there would be more married couples. Thus, there would be an increase in sex."
ModelUSGov,3dj521,PresterJuan,4,Thu Jul 16 19:33:47 2015 UTC,10% of the population wouldn't be able to be married and you are really expecting that not only will the other 90% get married but also constanly have sex despite having 12 kids to take care of because no contraception?
ModelUSGov,3dj521,MoralLesson,3,Thu Jul 16 19:37:26 2015 UTC,"sexpartisan   Censor that, please."

ModelUSGov,3dj521,Leecannon_,2,Thu Jul 16 22:02:35 2015 UTC,Don't worry. I found it amusing.
ModelUSGov,3dj521,Gohte,2,Thu Jul 16 22:05:58 2015 UTC,No one is running ALP in the Ohio River area so do I vote in another one or vote GLP?
ModelUSGov,3dj521,Leecannon_,11,Thu Jul 16 22:09:03 2015 UTC,don't listen to septimus just vote GLP
ModelUSGov,3dj521,Gohte,3,Fri Jul 17 02:03:42 2015 UTC,Are you not running for reelection?
ModelUSGov,3dj521,Leecannon_,8,Thu Jul 16 18:21:25 2015 UTC,"This simulation raises my blood pressure so I decided to not take any position that ties me down here in case I decide to take breaks, which I have wanted to do before.  /u/oughton42 is running for my seat."

If that means GLP, Distributist, Democrat, whatever is fine. I would say though to not vote Fascist, Republican or Libertarian (maybe there's some centrist Libertarian, not seen one yet). They are the exact opposite of ALP, so while you can totally vote for them no consequences even we somehow found out your vote, it means you may fit a more right-wing party."
ModelUSGov,3dj521,Smitty9913,8,Thu Jul 16 21:14:52 2015 UTC,Or how about you just stop telling people who to vote for?
ModelUSGov,3dj521,Leecannon_,2,Thu Jul 16 21:30:57 2015 UTC,How exactly do you think a campaign works?
ModelUSGov,3dj521,Toby_Zeiger,2,Thu Jul 16 18:57:56 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that there is not a campaign.

ModelUSGov,3dhvkj,Smitty9913,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:49:48 2015 UTC,Sorry this is a couple days late.  I would say I am fine with the principle of the bill but it needs to to be rewritten as well as some sort of provision for the cost to be made up elsewhere.
ModelUSGov,3dhvkj,19t,3,Sat Jul 18 23:57:33 2015 UTC,Thank you for the great work this term Mr. President! Does anyone know if we have continual approval rating reports?
ModelUSGov,3dhvkj,MoralLesson,2,Thu Jul 16 21:06:09 2015 UTC,We do but the last one ended last week I think. I do believe they will be starting up again. However it would be nice to see how people feel about the closing.

ModelUSGov,3dfy2u,IBiteYou,3,Fri Jul 17 16:45:27 2015 UTC,I really don't understand why you continue to be pissed off. You quit and now have what you want in a 2 party simulation (which interestes me BTW). You could of stayed and worked with us Republicans to fight the GLP but you did not so you really have no right to complain about the state of our simulation.
ModelUSGov,3dfy2u,raysfan95,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:10:15 2015 UTC,I'm not pissed off in general.  I just find it really remarkable that Lort is back as an isolationist Democrat.  I did resign my post as a Senator.  I don't regret that a bit.  It was the right thing to do.   You could of stayed and worked with us Republicans...   Were you in the party when I was in the party?  Because I don't recognize your name.  I've popped in here every now and then as I said I would when I resigned my position.   to fight the GLP    I wish you luck.  I really do.  Good luck.   you really have no right to complain about the state of our simulation   It's more and more of a soap opera every day.

I don't know if it was discussed before, but if this subreddit happens to grow a lot over the next year, say to 20,000 members or more, are there plans to make a bigger house and senate, with more states and districts? Maybe if it gets large enough, we could accurately model the United States geographically? Although with the state Constitutions, that might not work out, maybe just the higher number of districts would work."
ModelUSGov,3dfy2u,DidNotKnowThatLolz,4,Fri Jul 17 00:08:00 2015 UTC,"We've already increased the size (doubled) of the House, and are going to increase the size of the State legislatures in accordance with this growth."

ModelUSGov,3da0a6,rangerheart0,11,Tue Jul 14 17:40:29 2015 UTC,"Mr. President,  I cannot find any laws or amicus curaie written by your nominee. Indeed, all I can find is that he or she has jointly written, with another member of the model ACLU, the questions presented to the Court in ACLU v. United States (which he or she would have to recuse himself or herself from anyways).  Thus, can you provide the public with demonstrations of legal knowledge by the nominee (or can the nominee give some examples)? I'm presuming it was demonstrated in private messages, and so I believe you, but I'd like to see it verified."
ModelUSGov,3da0a6,MoralLesson,6,Tue Jul 14 19:16:32 2015 UTC,I too noticed this.
ModelUSGov,3da0a6,superepicunicornturd,9,Tue Jul 14 19:19:53 2015 UTC,"I find it objectionable that the nominee is currently serving as a petitioner in a court case of significant consequence for this nation. Since the nominee is incapable of making an unbiased judgement in said case, the decision would have to be made by only two justices, with the nominee recusing himself from the case. Considering the importance of the case, I fail to see how this could be considered acceptable by the President or Congress as a whole."
ModelUSGov,3da0a6,AdmiralJones42,2,Tue Jul 14 19:50:49 2015 UTC,We would definitely have to figure out something with this. Maybe the previous justice would be willing to serve with this case in specific.
ModelUSGov,3da0a6,Smitty9913,4,Wed Jul 15 00:02:04 2015 UTC,Like I said you picked someone who agreed with you. There were much. Egged candidates but you choice a left wing one bad sue you said you would.
ModelUSGov,3da0a6,Glitched_Stupidity,2,Wed Jul 15 02:24:32 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain /u/rangerheart0 already addressed this, saying that the candidate's views should be similar to the justice they're replacing. Biases are not supposed to be present in the court, unfortunately, humans are affected by them whether they want to be or not. Choosing someone of similar views keeps the court balanced against bias."
ModelUSGov,3da0a6,Smitty9913,2,Wed Jul 15 06:01:24 2015 UTC,"To an extent yes. In speaking with the previous justice the court is currently consisting of a conservative, and a centrist. Previously the third spot was taken up by a socialist, however a left leaning liberal would have been best to balance it out. Even so I tried to get an independent member to be the AJ whom I trusted to be unbiased. When that didn't pan out I went with the option which I thought would balance it out the best.  If The court had consisted of a socialist and a centrist I would have appointed someone of conservative views. To balance out the court. It adds an extra layer of protection against bias. People can complain and accuse me of underhanded dealings, that is fine. People have been doing that since I was elected and it is good to be cynical and critical of the executive branch. However I hope that people realize that I am not a liberal, I do not wish to push liberal views. If I wanted to be underhanded I could have done it way more to my benefit than this."
ModelUSGov,3da0a6,Smitty9913,7,Wed Jul 15 12:09:11 2015 UTC,It should be about experience not political views
ModelUSGov,3da0a6,Logic_85,2,Wed Jul 15 14:06:15 2015 UTC,All of the people considered were working on a degree in political science or related area of study. That was the first thing I did to weed out candidates was ensure that everyone had enough experience.
ModelUSGov,3da0a6,qrhoo,4,Wed Jul 15 16:15:00 2015 UTC,You made it clear that you would be biased.

ModelUSGov,3da0a6,risen2011,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:17:58 2015 UTC,Exactly what part of this 'reeks of backhanded dealings'? You present no evidence but seem to have an issue with the choice.

ModelUSGov,3da0a6,evanb_,3,Tue Jul 14 18:18:04 2015 UTC,"Yes he is! I think he has to withdraw his nomination from the house if he accepts, right?"
ModelUSGov,3da0a6,MoralLesson,2,Tue Jul 14 18:22:13 2015 UTC,I believe so.
ModelUSGov,3da0a6,evanb_,2,Tue Jul 14 18:33:39 2015 UTC,"Actually, I don't think there's anything specifically outlining that a justice may not hold any other public office. I could be wrong though, maybe this should be a case that the court hears.  Edit: Grammar"
ModelUSGov,3da0a6,MoralLesson,2,Tue Jul 14 18:51:12 2015 UTC,"He could still run for Congress while being confirmed, but he cannot serve in Congress and the Supreme Court simultaneously. Moreover, even if it were allowed, he'd then either have to abstain on every vote in the House or recuse himself in every vote in the Court."
ModelUSGov,3da0a6,dakpluto,4,Tue Jul 14 19:01:13 2015 UTC,Could you cite the part of the Constitution where this is made explicit?
ModelUSGov,3da0a6,OrledgeJ,7,Wed Jul 15 01:04:29 2015 UTC,"Article 1, Section 6, Clause 2:   No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office."

ModelUSGov,3da0a6,ben1204,2,Wed Jul 15 12:13:22 2015 UTC,"Assuming you are correct, that means the reasonable thing to do would be to remain on the ballot, then if he gets elected he can serve in the House until the nomination is confirmed, then he would have to resign in order to take up his mantle as an Associate Justice. Assuming he is elected in the first place of course."
ModelUSGov,3da0a6,AdmiralJones42,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:29:00 2015 UTC,I have requested that my name be taken off the list of eligible candidates for Congressional office. I no longer wish to run for office in the House of Representatives as I feel my abilities would be of better use in the Court system. This is why I accepted the humbling honor of being nominated to the Court.
ModelUSGov,3da0a6,DidNotKnowThatLolz,2,Wed Jul 15 01:47:57 2015 UTC,Good choice. I congratulate the president for picking an associate justice.
ModelUSGov,3da0a6,AdmiralJones42,3,Wed Jul 15 17:39:50 2015 UTC,"Not completely sure how I feel about this yet, but congratulations to /u/taterdatuba for the nomination nonetheless."
ModelUSGov,3da0a6,DidNotKnowThatLolz,2,Sat Jul 18 04:19:03 2015 UTC,I can say that he helped us out greatly in preparing our lawsuit against the death penalty. I hope the Senate will vote to confirm.
ModelUSGov,3da0a6,AdmiralJones42,6,Tue Jul 14 23:08:13 2015 UTC,This reason is exactly why the Senate should NOT vote to confirm. The nominee is clearly not impartial in perhaps the most important case that is currently before the court and is completely and utterly compromised in terms of judicial integrity.
ModelUSGov,3da0a6,dakpluto,3,Wed Jul 15 02:49:20 2015 UTC,He can recuse himself from the case.
ModelUSGov,3da0a6,ben1204,3,Wed Jul 15 04:05:54 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter. The President asked the potential nominees to write briefs on that specific ACLU case in order to gauge their legal knowledge, and then proceeded to nominate one of the petitioners of said case, which is strange to say the least. Additionally, having one out of three justices forced to recuse themselves from a very important case makes a mockery out of the Supreme Court as a whole. If we had a 9-person bench this maybe wouldn't be as big of an issue but leaving such a monumental case in the hands of two people is patently absurd. Partner that with the very suspicious nature of this selection and I would sincerely hope that the Senate chooses not to confirm the nominee."

ModelUSGov,3d6ia6,PenCap_Anthem,3,Tue Jul 14 14:34:27 2015 UTC,"On the 16th through some of the 19th (3 PM to 3 PM EST), there will be a Google Form poll and an accompanying thread where you verify that you've voted (to ensure that one account gets one vote). For the Senate election, you will be voting for candidates (First-Past-The-Post); for the House election, you will be voting for parties (D'Hondt).  Like the real United States, Model United States is divided into regions- except here it's Districts (for House seats) and States (but only four of them). You can pick during each election which State and District you reside in (for example, I reside in the Central State in the Ohio River District and will be running and voting from there). I'd recommend consulting your party to figure out the grand electoral strategy before deciding where you'll be voting/residing from."

ModelUSGov,3d6lbm,superepicunicornturd,5,Mon Jul 13 22:56:18 2015 UTC,"Without delving too much into our processes, I'll say that there's no specific order planned for when decisions will be announced."

ModelUSGov,3d6lbm,ElliottC99,3,Tue Jul 14 17:55:14 2015 UTC,"Not via the Court.  We have to remain impartial, so cannot advise one side or the other.

I don't know why you, being apart of the Greens party, would be advocating for that."
ModelUSGov,3d2it9,Sooky88,2,Mon Jul 13 01:49:03 2015 UTC,"D'Hondt favors larger parties, Saint-Laguë has been found to be very proportional.  EDIT: Source   Not only is the Sainte-Lagüe method shown to be the most proportional method of the 11 formulas considered, but in practice it yields results nearly equivalent to those with the Hare and Droop LR methods, previously considered the most proportional"
ModelUSGov,3d2it9,HolaHelloSalutNiHao,3,Mon Jul 13 01:49:50 2015 UTC,"As I said, your method favors smaller parties and uses a more complicated formula.  Edit to reply to your edit: It all depends what you perceive as 'proportionate'. I have seen a set of votes from both methods that show disproportionate results. As I said, one favors the larger parties and one favors the smaller parties."
ModelUSGov,3d2it9,Sooky88,2,Mon Jul 13 01:51:52 2015 UTC,"Not sure how V/2s+1 is that much more complicated than V/s+1.  And it favors small parties less than D'Hondt favors large parties, although they do favor in different directions. It's impossible to get a perfect system of proportionality. But Saint-Lagüe, although slightly biased towards the small parties, comes closer to proportionality than the D'Hondt."
ModelUSGov,3d2it9,HolaHelloSalutNiHao,2,Mon Jul 13 02:01:28 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the volume of votes too.   Not sure how V/2s+1 is that much more complicated than V/s+1.   I did not say how much more complicated, an extra step does make something 'more complicated' which were the exact words I used.   And it favors small parties less than D'Hondt favors large parties, although they do favor in different directions. It's impossible to get a perfect system of proportionality. But Saint-Lagüe, although slightly biased towards the small parties, comes closer to proportionality than the D'Hondt.   I do not agree with the D'Hondt being less proportianate of the two, I think they both have their flaws and favor different things in different scenarios."
ModelUSGov,3d2it9,Sooky88,2,Mon Jul 13 02:06:18 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the volume of votes too. True, that is an important factor to consider. But after a while, the effect of the volume of votes begins to deteriorate.  I did not say how much more complicated, an extra stop does make something 'more complicated' which were the exact words I used.   I would argue it's not an extra step, it's a number change. The added complexity of it, assuming there is one, wouldn't be significant anyway. There are calculators which can perform these calculations.   I do not agree with the D'Hondt being less proportianate of the two, I think they both have their flaws and favor different things in different scenarios.   Again, here's my source. It uses election data from over four thousand local elections and tests the results if they were calculated using the PR systems, then ranks them according to how much the results diverge on average from the true proportion. St.-Laguë diverges the least.  By the way, this is a surprisingly civil debate for the internet. Thank you!"

Do we accept making parties a formal part of the political system and giving them more control over individuals or the risk of over-representing certain interest groups?
ModelUSGov,3d2it9,HolaHelloSalutNiHao,3,Mon Jul 13 04:24:00 2015 UTC,I prefer not making parties quite as formal as a proportional method makes them. I much prefer the ease of running as an independent that STV gives.

Quite the opposite, we very much want them to be able to know what is going on in the courts and we frequently advocate for an end to poverty and for free education for all. In fact, one of the things we all agreed upon in our discussion, was that we supported the idea behind your bill and that we want to see it rewritten and resubmitted.   Since you're so insistent that I can't speak for myself, the following is my short personal position that I wrote while waiting for an official position to be made available:  This Bill cut government revenue with no proposal of how to offset the loss. While I and the other GLP representatives support the general motion, we would like to see it rewritten in such a way that the government will not lose revenue."

ModelUSGov,3d2hfq,pepsibluefan,6,Wed Jul 15 14:53:19 2015 UTC,"You might want to fix formatting. It took me a while to figure out that the heading of Subsection 1 was ""Frequency"" as I was really trying to figure out what a ""Frequency Congressional Election"" was.  Edit 1: I think Senate and Presidential elections should use Instant-runoff voting not First-Past-The-Post elections.  Edit 2: I don't think we should include the current map of districts if the moderators are free to change them at will.  Edit 3: Use Articles, Sections, and Subsections so you don't have the awkward ""Firstly"", ""Secondly"", ""Thirdly"" phrases dealing with Senate elections.  Edit 4: Article I, Subsection 5 -- Advertisement is spelled wrong.  Edit 5: Your current policy for voting is, ""To vote in any election, the reddit account voting must be, at least, 3 months old on the day of voting or have joined a party before the announcement of the federal election date."" However, I think /r/modelparliament has a great system where you have to register to vote several weeks in advance of the election -- it really cuts down on brigading, I'm sure.  Edit 6: Your current policy for the ""Join a Party"" thread is, ""You may not respond to membership inquiries in the Join a Party thread unless you are a recruiting member of the party to which the applicant requested membership, a moderator, or are paging a recruiting member of the party to which the applicant requested membership."" However, I feel like that unfairly leaves off when people ask questions about platforms or what such and such parties stand for. I think the rule should really be against poaching members who have clearly stated who they want to join (e.g. If someone states they want to be a Republican, then the Democrats should not be trying to convince them otherwise). Since poaching bans are already in Article 6, you can probably just delete that aforementioned portion.  Edit 7: The majority leader or president pro tempore of the Senate as well as the Press Secretary should be approved submitters by default.  Edit 8: ""SUB SECTION 3: Outside subreddits Any outside subreddit, that centers around /r/ModelUSGov, is required to have at least one moderator from the moderation staff of /r/ModelUSGov."" I feel like such a rule unfairly burdens lobbies and inter-party cooperation subreddits. The main party subreddits can have this requirement, but not any subreddit that tangentially touches on /r/ModelUsGov.  Edit 9: I feel like there should be something mentioning that filibusters happen in the Senate only.  Edit 10: I like the removal of the Clerk provisions, but I feel like any petition thread should have special oversight or protection from /u/timanfya. I also feel like it should make mention of any successors to /u/timanfya, should she ever resign her post.  Edit 11: I'm glad the moderators can no longer amend the constitution at will.  Edit 12: You need something authorizing a broader ability to obtain standing in the courts since none of us can be personally injured by bills.  Edit 13: I think removing a member of Congress for not voting should either a) be left up to the party b) only occur if those non-votes are consecutive or c) be coupled with an allowance for proxy voting by a member of their party for when members of Congress are on vacation."

You'd have to found a party right after an election and hope it grew enough in 3 months to match the others -- and this will become progressively more difficult as all established parties are bound to grow not shrink (or at least most are).  Edit: For instance, let's say the Progressives manage to become a party right after this election. Then they will need 100/(8*1.5)% or 8% of the vote in the very next election, and while that sounds like nothing, if this subreddit even continues to grow at the same rate, then that means we'll have about 3600 subscribers by the next election, so that 3-month old party would need as many as 300 votes to continue existing."

I support workers being able to unionize and demand a fair wage, as this will have to be the way wages are regulated with the absence of the state. What I don't support, though, is the firing of the workers if they choose to go on strike or demand a better wage. This isn't necessary because if the wage is actually unfair, then the workers will send a message to the business owner that their wage is crap."

We also have no intentions for nationalization or worker's councils. Moreover, socialism is very materialistic -- and we specifically reject the philosophical stance of materialism."

ModelUSGov,3d0pc6,anarchitekt,7,Sun Jul 12 23:55:46 2015 UTC,'Libertarian' refers to any anti-authoritarian ideology and was first used by a communist to describe himself in the 19th century. 'Libertarian' referring to the very specific U.S. brand of hardcore classical liberal has only arisen in the last few decades.
ModelUSGov,3d0pc6,HolaHelloSalutNiHao,3,Sun Jul 12 23:56:23 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Wikipedia is your friend. :)  Libertarian socialism and libertarian Marxism are strains of socialist thought that believe that a stateless, classless, and moneyless society (i.e., communism) should be attained through anti-authoritarian means (which distinguishes us from Marxist-Leninists). It's kind of like how many pacifists believe that military means can never bring peace; similarly, we believe that authoritarian means can never end oppression.  As far as the Non-Aggression Principle goes, I believe it's grounded on the notion of ""self-ownership,"" which itself is grounded in ""ownership"" and thus relies on a capitalist framework. Since socialist ideology generally calls for the rejection of such notions, no, libertarian Marxism does not share libertarian capitalism's grounding in the Non-Aggression Principle. However, like all socialists, we believe that humans deserve freedom from all forms of oppression and aggression, including (but not limited to) the theft of their labor.  While we both presumably believe in human worth and would disagree with fascists/etc. who claim that humans are the property of their ""nation"" or race or some other group, our viewpoints rely on completely different political, ideological, and epistemological frameworks.  As far as situationism goes, even though you didn't ask: it's an expansion of Marx's analysis of the capitalist mode of production which believes that capitalism has permeated all aspects of our life and ultimately caused us to become degenerates. Its core idea is the ""spectacle,"" in which humans abandon authentic interaction and instead express themselves through objects and consumption. If you'd like to check it out, there's a film version of one of its core works available on YouTube.  Cheers, comrade!"
ModelUSGov,3d0pc6,WellHeresMyFourthAcc,2,Mon Jul 13 03:55:30 2015 UTC,"how can a moneyless society be enforced if all individuals of a given enclave or union unanimously decided that money will be used in their particular society?  Though I wholeheartedly disagree with Stalinists, they are the most logical of this strain of thought, as authoritarian rule and wiping out workers who disagree with their viewpoints could effectively function. Without authoritarian enforcement, I believe Libertarian Marxism would then simply exist in enclaves within a freely Capitalist society.  I see no problem with Libertarian Marxism in that context. Those that voluntarily live in a separate community without money or any sort of order should be allowed to do so. Then again, Lib Socs should then be opposed to the Authoritarian Green-left mainstream who then seek to push upon these policies against the unwilling free people?"
ModelUSGov,3d0pc6,Libertarian-Party,4,Mon Jul 13 04:08:05 2015 UTC,"how can a moneyless society be enforced if all individuals of a given enclave or union unanimously decided that money will be used in their particular society?   Good question. Communism isn't something that needs to be enforced; it's something that will happen as a long-term consequence of socialism (workers control the means of production -> workers now control what they produce -> means of production are no longer restricted through the actions of capitalists -> workers now produce what they want -> workers freely trade what they produce, and due to decreased scarcity (no more empty homes surrounded by homeless people, etc.) begin distributing excess production based on need/etc. rather than based on a goal of maximizing profit -> due to this abandonment of the profit motive, money is no longer needed since workers don't feel any compulsion to amass capital). Essentially, after a point where artificial scarcity is mostly eliminated, money will no longer need to exist and will be abandoned. However, if workers in some situation do find themselves needing money to simplify exchanges, they can create ad hoc currencies to do so- just like how workers in direct democracy can appoint ad hoc delegates if the need arises.  Again, there's complex theory behind this so I'd recommend you read the literature instead of debating here, because in that scenario we'll mostly be discussing questions that have already been answered.   they are the most logical of this strain of thought, as authoritarian rule and wiping out workers who disagree with their viewpoints could effectively function.   I disagree with that view. Really, the only authoritarian consequence of socialism that you could argue is essential would be the elimination of wage slavery, which likely would have to happen through law (just like slavery). That, in conjunction with a few other similar measures, would almost serve to guarantee worker control over the means of production as control over the means of production could no longer be used to exploit some humans for their labor. This, again, is something you can learn about more from literature than from arguing with me here. Like libertarianism, socialism has a very large body of literature- and just as I found it best to learn about libertarian viewpoints by reading libertarian literature with an open mind, I believe socialist viewpoints can be best understood by doing the same with socialist literature.   I believe Libertarian Marxism would then simply exist in enclaves within a freely Capitalist society.   I find this interesting because this actually does happen in the status quo- workers collectives like Mondragon aren't the dominant force within the capitalist framework, but they're still pretty widespread. Although there's a lot of criticism coming from libertarian socialists like Chomsky (as well as MLMs), I personally believe that workers' collectives are the best means of achieving socialism and eventually communism. Ultimately, as a legislator, I will be focused on promoting their development and (primarily) eliminating barriers to their existence (which arise as a natural consequence of the capitalist assumptions in our present legal framework). I also don't think that socialism is something you can force to happen- ultimately, it's about empathizing with the proletariat and helping them seize their own destiny instead of determining for them what's best.   Those that voluntarily live in a separate community without money or any sort of order should be allowed to do so.   :) This is why I think it would help to read the literature. It's not about living in the sort of communities that existed in the US around the 1890s and now end up producing (good) silverware. It's all about worker control over the means of production, and everything else is going to be a consequence of that and doesn't have to be artificially brought about. So a libertarian Marxist community within a capitalist framework would simply be a workers' collective where those who produce have a say in the direction of the collective and what happens with what they make, nothing more and nothing less.   Then again, Lib Socs should then be opposed to the Authoritarian Green-left mainstream who then seek to push upon these policies against the unwilling free people?   We're part of the mainstream. I'm surprised you hadn't seen any libertarian socialists out here in the wild yet, since I think we're actually the majority (or at least not too far behind the MLMs in number and activity) in the party. We're far from rare birds, in Model World or in real life, and we definitely have a voice in the big-tent leftist GLP."

ModelUSGov,3d0pc6,DidNotKnowThatLolz,6,Sun Jul 12 20:52:13 2015 UTC,"The USSR was not communist. By definition. Socialism is another matter entirely, and is highly arguable (some consider it state capitalist, others consider it state socialist).   What you must realize is that communism & socialism are not one ideology. There are many variations, many types. As Mr. Richard D. Wolff put it: ""People who talk about socialism haven't been paying attention. Socialisms, there are.""  I myself don't believe in the central planning of the USSR nor do I believe in a gift economy. I believe in a market economy; albeit a market economy containing public ownership and management of productive capital.  Also, would you please define communism and socialism?"
ModelUSGov,3d0pc6,HolaHelloSalutNiHao,3,Mon Jul 13 04:01:24 2015 UTC,Most of the Green-Left are Marxist-Leninists. The USSR was founded in part by the efforts of Lenin. How can we not call the USSR Communist?
ModelUSGov,3d0pc6,I_miss_Chris_Hughton,3,Mon Jul 13 04:33:35 2015 UTC,"You're confusing ideology with practice. Let me put it this way: Can you genuinely call the Model US Communist or Socialist right now, just because a socialist is president? It's a government headed by a communist or socialist, not a communist or socialist country in itself (""communist country"" is an oxymoron, but anyway)."
ModelUSGov,3d0pc6,HolaHelloSalutNiHao,3,Mon Jul 13 05:21:23 2015 UTC,"How was the USSR not communist? Revolution, centrally planned economy, nationalization of resources, etc."
ModelUSGov,3d0pc6,anarchitekt,3,Mon Jul 13 05:44:39 2015 UTC,"Centrally planned economy and nationalization of resources are not features of communism. You can have a planned economy with socialism. You can have a centrally planned economy with capitalism too; see Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.  Communism is a classless, stateless, moneyless society, as defined by every single communist ever.  The USSR never claimed to be communist-only socialist.  The USSR was a state; Communism is stateless (anarchic).  Call the USSR socialist if you like, but don't call it communist. That is simply incorrect."
ModelUSGov,3d0pc6,DidNotKnowThatLolz,2,Mon Jul 13 05:46:37 2015 UTC,"Communism is a classless, stateless, moneyless society, as defined by every single communist ever.   Pretty sure this strays into the area of 'true scotsmen', or at least the lack thereof"

It's where you use an incorrect requirement to unnecessarily exclude something from a categorization.  It is not where you say ""No true Scotsman doesn't have some form of heritage originating from Scotland, or otherwise identifies with the Scottish ethnic, cultural and national identity!"" because that would be the definition of a Scotsman and therefore not an example of a fallacy to say such a thing.."

ModelUSGov,3d0pc6,JayArrGee,3,Mon Jul 13 06:23:25 2015 UTC,"Communism is a form of socialism. However, the USSR was not communist. It was a country ruled by a communist party.

The USSR was not stateless, classless (arguable) or moneyless. Ergo, the USSR was not communist."

Hell, there's even the Whip to make sure that people vote the way the party wants. And rather than compromsing, these parties are clawing tooth and nail to extremes, espeically the Green-Left. We need a 'United' States along with open-minded centrists to make sure that all we can vote for isn't just extremes. The Democrats may not be the most left-sided party in the world, but they are a left-sided party. And they've had their own spurts of refusing to compromise. So it's left to interpretation."

ModelUSGov,3d0pc6,DidNotKnowThatLolz,3,Sun Jul 12 21:27:52 2015 UTC,"Okay, you've never whipped a vote before.  You're still towing a party line.  When it comes down to it, you have to be to the left on every single issue that appears. There's no fluctuation, and you can only reach the middle. If America decided to reach to the right on an issue, you're stuck on the party line rather than the American line. You don't represent America, you represent a party. Your ideological stand relies on what your party wants, not what America wants. I stand wherever America stands, if the argument can provide the reasoning needed."
ModelUSGov,3d0pc6,theSolomonCaine,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:18:49 2015 UTC,"So you will just sway and pander whichever way the voters go?

ModelUSGov,3d0pc6,DidNotKnowThatLolz,2,Mon Jul 13 05:35:48 2015 UTC,"""if the argument can provide the reasoning needed""  I'm not swaying and pandering on voter whim, I'm following the reasoning that this country needs. If the American people can prove that their way is the better way through facts and absolutes, then I would be more than willing to take their side. What I'm saying is that I want an open mind to all sides of the argument and the side of America that provides facts and absolutes can definitely take my vote. However, if there aren't enough facts and absolutes, then we need the middle ground. And I also agree that America needs strong leadership to usher in a new era of prosperity. However, a party that is frozen to a certain set of ideals isn't what we need. We need centrists and open minded people who are willing to find out what America needs rather than what a party wants."
ModelUSGov,3d0pc6,finnishdude101,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:38:12 2015 UTC,Just because someone is a part of a party doesn't me their mind cannot be changed by information and facts.    What I'm saying is that I want an open mind to all sides of the argument and the side of America that provides facts and absolutes can definitely take my vote.   I'd also argue that not everything can be solved purely by logic. Specifically social issues are brought to the hearts and minds of voters using emotion. Things like abortion and gay marriage can't be decided using any sort of numbers. People decide their opinions on those matters based on when they believe life begins inside the womb or what they believe marriage is.    We need centrists and open minded people who are willing to find out what America needs rather than what a party wants.   A party strives to pass its legislation because they believe it is what America needs.
ModelUSGov,3d0pc6,theSolomonCaine,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:51:11 2015 UTC,"I didn't say your mind couldn't be changed, I just said you were stuck with ""towing the party line"". The point of being apart of a party is that you agree with their values. If you start changing the values that you joined the party for in the first place, then you really don't match with that party anymore. Or you just suck it up and vote the party way on that issue/topic.   And it's obvious that some problems are qualitative over quantitative, but that doesn't mean people can't have logical arguments. Take for example the gay marriage situation. I've heard that because it relates to a religious motive, and government isn't supposed to involve itself in religion, it doesn't make sense for the government to regulate it. And that's logical and sensible. Same idea with abortion. I've heard that allowing it up until the third trimester is a sensible idea, and based on my own research I've decided that it seems the best option to fit both sides. Social issues are not solved by numbers, but by logical arguments. And while there can be more than one argument, listening to all of them and making an informed decision as a result is the best idea rather than sticking to one opinion only.  Yes, a party attempts to pass legislation because they believe it is what America needs. They want their ideals to shine through to legislation because they want it. Just because they believe it is what America needs doesn't mean it actually is what America needs. The only way to find what America needs is to listen to all sides of the argument rather than using a party constitution as framework for legislation."

ModelUSGov,3crezi,MoralLesson,3,Fri Jul 10 04:18:18 2015 UTC,"You make several good points. I'll respond to them in order.  In terms of the defense budget, I do know cuts are possible. Though I requested a small raise from the previous administration's allocation for DoD, it was only because that budget ($500b.) was made without a great deal of review or an established committee. I believe cuts in the defense budget could be done, and, considering the debt crisis, should be made. The $512b. I requested still represents a 7% decrease in the defense budget in real life.  As to what areas of our could be cut the most, I would say reducing our foreign presence abroad would be a huge help. While military bases in Europe (particularly the United Kingdom and Germany) are relatively inexpensive and mutually beneficial both to us and the country in question, much of our involvement in the Middle East could be curtailed to provide logistical as opposed to offensive support to the countries/organizations which we support actively there. I also am of the opinion that the development of certain technologies are not a good use of funds; the F-35 Lightning is one example. Though it is an effective aircraft, it did not need to be developed, or, at the very least, could have been developed far more slowly and in a different fashion. We can also save money by continuing and improving old programs, such as the A-10 Warthog aircraft, instead of developing new ones. DoD salaries (not for enlisted men and women, but for employees) can also be reduced; I work for the Department of Defense as an analyst in real life and am familiar with the numbers.  I believe the only area that needs growth is our cyberwarfare defense systems. Some specifics to focus on would be separating the power grid from the Internet, or, in terms of defensive stability, improving the current power grid or energy infrastructure as a whole.  In terms of 'justifying' the budget, one has to look at many concerns. First of all, cuts can be made, which would reduce that statistic. However, the United States can, and should, remain a military superpower. The number of potential combatants against us worldwide is large, and we need to maintain an independent defensive posture against the countries. (By ""independent,"" I mean a scenario in which case we do not rely on foreign aid or investment to help us in a defensive conflict.) Our military spending also stimulates the economy through research and manufacture of military technologies, as well as trading and/or exchanging research and technologies with our allies. Finally, the size of the US, both geographically and population-wise, necessitates a large military budget. However, as I mentioned, this number (and therefore statistic), can be looked upon with a critical eye and cuts can be made.  Also, you may want to post these comments in the WHPress thread to which this post is linked, so everybody can find it easily. I'll permalink to our current string in the comments there.  Small edits: grammar for clarification."
ModelUSGov,3crezi,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:35:19 2015 UTC,I think defense contractors should probably be a part of any cuts.
ModelUSGov,3crezi,MoralLesson,2,Sat Jul 11 13:17:25 2015 UTC,"I apologize for taking so long to respond. Certain defense contractors are indeed inefficient or even guilty of war crimes and should indeed have their contracts terminated immediately. However, a few are not only 'cheap,' or cost efficient, but provide only infrastructure or construction benefits that free military resources to perform other tasks. I believe these contractors should be kept on. I have a list of specific companies which I could share portions of."

Bill 058: I support the open movement of people. Restrictions on immigration are ridiculous. I am unfamiliar with the current system, so I can't say whether or not this is a step in the right direction.  Bill 062: The Communist Control Act violated the first amendment.

It is an attempt to recognize a country before they have even declared their own independence. I urge lawmakers to support B.067. People should be able to request what information a site has on them and pay the site not to collect and store their information. I am glad to see the passage of CR.003, even without the amendments I think it should have had. I hope the President signs B.062 as it repeals an unconstitutional violation of free speech and free assembly. I urge the President to sign B.058 as it provides people who know nothing but America and have proven themselves productive to have a path to legal status and citizenship. I urge lawmakers to pass B.064 as it increases transparency in the federal judiciary -- always a good thing! I am glad to see the defeat of CR.004. While I want the United States to have better relations with Latin American nations, that resolution was absolutely the wrong way to go about it."

If our government was actually run by the overwhelming demographic that runs this government we would have the same issues.

ModelUSGov,3cmbq1,AMatterofTrust,2,Thu Jul 9 04:32:43 2015 UTC,"The problem is that here people want to make sweeping reforms based on ideology, in a page, and many of the people writing these bills do not have a background in law or economics.   In reality, the world is much much more complicated and intricate than many of the bills would have you believe, and the wording is never specific in these bills. Which in some respects is a sacrifice we would have to make, because while many people in Congress have a legal background (many people criticize this, I don't because I see a value in having lawyers write legislation) most of Reddit does not.   I think that the sacrifices we do not have to make is those that fail to take into account realism or the complexity of our world and its people. Do not attempt, in  few passages, to reform the entire tax code. Do not raise the minimum wage to ridiculous amounts or remove it all together. Make reasonable change that can supposedly be easily implemented by federal agencies. For example, don't attempt to reform the entire student loan mess, take on a small issue that can be extremely debatable yet doable (like allowing and encouraging investors to fund kids to go to college.) Do not attempt to reform the entire prison system, take on a small issue, like a more conservative action of increasing the number of social impact bond programs, or a liberal action of imposing regulation on the private prison industry. I think this Congress can emulate realism and it is important that it does so lest we end up passing legislation on ideological grounds without accounting for the realities of governing something, making our simulation more of a ideological slap fight and not a true simulation of government, in which we can all learn something and enjoy.   Just a few thoughts on this simulation and realism."
ModelUSGov,3cmbq1,Smitty9913,2,Thu Jul 9 03:02:11 2015 UTC,I agree i just wish there was a tad bit more realism.  My bills also have legal code with the correct wording and coding anyways.

ModelUSGov,3cmbq1,OldTimeyPugilist,6,Thu Jul 9 02:01:30 2015 UTC,"If I'm understanding this correctly the complaint is that since some (I'd imagine a large number) of us participating in this simulation are neophytes to these processes or don't have ample backgrounds in law or economics, this ruins the enjoyment for many of you?  I genuinely ask this. I've become very interested in politics and looked at this as an opportunity to learn in a fun environment. I even ordered a textbook today which was referred to me by a friend who - if you enjoy realism - you would love (or hate).  I'm new. I get it. This was my first attempt writing a bill, but I am dedicated to learning through genuine helpful critiques and I'm enjoying myself. That said, if I am making this less enjoyable for a number of you, I will take my leave.  I would rather up the quality of realism for those upset than selfishly sit around being resented and I sincerely mean that, so please, tell me what I can do that'd be best."
ModelUSGov,3cmbq1,oughton42,6,Thu Jul 9 04:06:02 2015 UTC,"I honestly wouldn't worry about striving for realism too much. The people who make those complaints either don't realize or are simply ignoring the fact that real-life bills are hundreds -- if not over 1,000 -- pages long, that congressmen have dozens of experts in economics, law, etc. writing these bills for them, and that we don't have access to those resources nor the time (or need) to utilize them.

If you are going to help the mentally ill, then do it in a way that touches on many aspects. More psychologists and psychiatrists aren't going to solve the problem. You do know that a lot of homeless people are mentally ill right?  I believe we need to reform the entire bill to counter act what President Ronald Regan did. We need to bring back mental ward hospitals and involuntary hospitalization. What you got to realize here us that most mentally ill homeless people are incapable of making decisions on their own. Thus, we need to have the power to be able to help these people. Also, the sad reality is that a lot of these cases on the street are rejected by their families. The families cannot take care of them or they simply walk off into the street rejecting help.  We should reword the act to reflect these issues. Then we should also reform the act to apply to our police officers. Yesterday it was reported a teenage boy who has autism was beaten by police officers and punched in the face. All while he was screaming for help to his family. He did nothing to warrant such force, and the New York police department has a huge lawsuit being put against them.  We should write into law that police have mandatory training in interacting with people with special needs. Please hear me out."

I urge him to sign it.  I am glad to see that B.057 failed. While it had a great idea, it was too horribly written to become law.  Without amendments, B.065 is too vague to be good law. I urge lawmakers to vote against it.  While B.066 does not do enough to train public employees to recognize when people need to be referred to treatment for mental illness and while it should be state-implemented (not federal), it is a good first step, so I recommend supporting it."

ModelUSGov,3chwiq,MoralLesson,13,Wed Jul 8 01:11:13 2015 UTC,"While I completely support a right to self-determination for the Kurdish people, I think we should let them declare their independence from Iraq (and any other nations) before we recognize them as a separate and sovereign entity. Moreover, much of Kurdistan is also in Turkey, Syria, and Iran -- which this bill seems to forget.  Again, I'm not so sure I can support giving the Kurds $25 billion in weapons. If we are going to give them aid, why not ask what they want? Maybe they would feel economic aid is more valuable. By giving them a certain type of aid without consulting them, I feel like we are imposing our beliefs as to what they need onto them.  Also, your preamble is more of a title, your bill title in the title of this post is a good short title, and Section I is more of a preamble.   it's territorial integrity    its territorial integrity*  It's = it is  Its = possessive form of it"
ModelUSGov,3chwiq,da_drifter0912,6,Wed Jul 8 01:27:46 2015 UTC,"If we recognize their sovereignty before they declare independence it could give the impression that the US will intervene with military action to protect the new nation, even if we don't intend to do so."
ModelUSGov,3chwiq,alesiar,3,Wed Jul 8 01:53:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed. We need not sour ourselves and our current position in the region any further by taking sides like this. We, the United States, are in large part responsible for the mess that is ISIS, and while I believe the Kurds have made demonstrable progress, the fight for self-determination is fundamentally a fight they must wage for themselves, and is not an excuse for us to start insinuating that the American military machine is once again revving up for another self-righteous, messy slugfest in the region."
ModelUSGov,3chwiq,AGreyShirt,5,Thu Jul 9 01:26:17 2015 UTC,I am on the exact same page with you.

We shouldn't invest in Iraq, but further our own efforts, not other's efforts which will maybe accomplish our goals by proxy.

ModelUSGov,3chwiq,Libertarian-Party,5,Thu Jul 9 16:02:48 2015 UTC,Have you heard about the YPG and PershMerga? They were the terrorists of the 90s. The kurds only happen to be on our side because their interests align.  And do people not recognize that Turkey's lands are part of Kurdistan's claimed lands? A nation with US Military bases?
ModelUSGov,3chwiq,_DeadPoolJr_,2,Wed Jul 8 02:09:51 2015 UTC,"That is perhaps the biggest challenge that would be faced if they do decide to form a complete independent state. Since the land that they live on is spread through different countries, and none of them I believe would be willing to give any of it up especially if it would help the US in that region. Turkey at the moment I believe is in a delicate state, turn between being a NATO member who we do sell weapons to including the new F-35, and their current climate of wanting to be the dominate power in the region, along with their recent political climate that could cause problems in the future. When looking at this when it comes to Turkey I believe we most also consider the climate in Europe as well since the issue with Russia makes Turkey an important/strategic ally since they control access to the black sea, and military size compared to other NATO states. To anger them in this way could make them drift away from us and cost us down the line.   For other countries, Iraq I think would be simple manner since they have acted as a autonomous region for a while now, the main one would be Iran that would cause the biggest headache in my opinion for a variety of reasons.    First they have just gotten Iraq under their influence something that they have wanted to do for some time now, to let it get smaller is something they don't want to see happen to their new prize, and could be seen as the US trying to hinder their influence in the country. They would never give up any land to begin with the US wanting to help in the establishment just makes it worse. The fact that we want it is good enough a reason for them to deny it, and hinder it at any opportunity. If we were to get them to agree which I highly doubt it would have probably been accomplished by some serous backroom politics, and the price we would have to pay for something like this is in my opinion too high.   Plus the Kurds have to first want to establish a state on their own before we can support, and recognize it."

But they first need to go through many factors of nation building before they can.  Right now, there is no such so called ""Republic of Kurdistan"", not yet. And without a huge global, international collective, we can't move things along. The United States can't be meddling in the affairs of other nations, including ones that do not exist yet."
ModelUSGov,3chwiq,Jkevo,4,Thu Jul 9 01:08:39 2015 UTC,in the end the continues meddling in the middle east by western powers has had an over all destabilizing effect maybe we should stay out of the region and let it self stabilize.
ModelUSGov,3chwiq,thesuperrad,4,Wed Jul 8 17:15:42 2015 UTC,"I support the Kurdish struggle for self-determination and I believe we need to find a way to support the PKK fighters against ISIS extremists.  I do not believe, however, that unilaterally recognizing Kurdistan as a state and dumping $25 billions of dollars worth of armaments in their lap is a wise move, especially without any regard to the fact that the PKK is currently a designated terrorist group by the government and when our current strategy of assisting the YPG fighters by providing air support seems to be working.  Let's keep providing air cover to the YPG/YPJ forces in their fight against ISIS. Perhaps we can explore the option of negotiating the removal of the PKK from the foreign terrorist organization list, which Turkey may be more amenable to since their cease-fire with the PKK in 2013.  I also find the Preamble lacks any acknowledgment of how the U.S. destabilized the region through the most recent Iraq War but now I may be nitpicking."

How about passing a resolution promising to recognize and protect their independence if they do declare it?  We should amend this bill rather than veto it. A veto will be seen as yet another betrayal by our Kurdish friends. We should also amend the bill to offer aid Kurdistan requests rather than dumping it in their lap.
ModelUSGov,3chwiq,mocosuburbian,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:39:04 2015 UTC,Exactly.
ModelUSGov,3chwiq,DangleMyStash,2,Wed Jul 8 15:43:50 2015 UTC,"... I'm not seeing the benefits of this. The Kurds in Iraq and especially in Syria don't want independence, they want autonomy over their own land within their respective Syrian and Iraqi states. Additionally, Turkey hasn't yet entered the war but is threatening to do so.  Actually, if you browse through the articles on r/syriancivilwar , you'll see that giving the Kurds independence would spell disaster for a lot of citizens in Syria and Iraq (Turkey has repeatedly threatened Syrian Kurds that it wouldn't allow a Kurdish state on its borders at any cost, and an independent Kurdish territory in Iraq would strain the already tenuous relations between Iraqi Kurdistan and Iraq.)  edit: I forgot to mention that our relations with Turkey would be absolutely ruined by this move, since Erdogan and many other Turks seriously hate the Kurds (and for good reason, because of what the Kurds have inflicted on Turkey with the PKK)   It would be better if we continue backing the YPG, Rojava/Syrian Kurdistan's military branch, until the war is over. From there, the US can negotiate the status of an independent Kurdistan with Syria, Iraq, and possibly Turkey and Iran."
ModelUSGov,3chwiq,CapitalMarketServant,2,Wed Jul 8 16:34:00 2015 UTC,"How could we recognize Kurdistan as its own independent nation without offending or stirring up controversy with the nations surrounding it, especially before the Kurdish have made any similar statements of independence themselves? We shouldn't recognize them as a nation until they've at least come out and stated their desire for independence and their intention to work towards the creation of a sovereign Kurdistan. And this is very much a possibility. Recent reports have stated that an independent Kurdistan by 2030 is very possible. The US doesn't need to jump the gun and proceed to stick its nose in other countries' business. Kurdistan will come out for independence when it wants to. Then we can recognize them.    I'm also opposed to sending more arms into the Middle East, let alone $25 billion worth. As was already stated by /u/tinymovingtarts in their post, it's actions like these that have resulted in weapons falling into the wrong hands and helping groups like ISIS to form in the first place. I think a discussion needs to occur over better solutions to the ISIS problem that don't include flooding the region with more incredibly advanced weaponry."
ModelUSGov,3chwiq,mewtwo245,2,Wed Jul 8 16:37:45 2015 UTC,"I believe it is evident based on the comments thus far that this bill is premature, as Kurdistan has yet to declare its own independence. I'd like to echo the sentiment of others, believing that Kurdistan should one day be an independent nation, but only on a time frame that is advanced by its own people.  Additionally, the $25 billion aid package seems to be an arbitrary amount. Is there a reason for $25 billion versus $5 billion or even simply 5 dollars?   Lastly, the source of these funds seems to me to be unclear. Are these funds coming from an already appropriated foreign aid amount or will it come from a new tax? Are we assuming our military will be donating these weapons and technologies or will the government be buying them from contractors?  Overall, I am glad to see that similar concerns have been raised so far, and I hope that this discussion will result in a stronger bill in the future to support Kurdistan after it has taken its first steps to becoming a sovereign state."

I think by recognizing an independent Kurdistan while violence continues in the region it will only serve to undermine and weaken Iraq. Something that can't be afforded during the current crisis against ISIL. I think for the time being any monetary aid should be given to the central government in Baghdad and allow them to distribute it as they see fit in the fight against ISIL. I think that the best thing we can do as a nation is aid the Kurdish advance by sending military advisers, drone striking strategic targets, and offering air support to the Kurdish Forces."
ModelUSGov,3chwiq,ProfessorHenn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:09:38 2015 UTC,"While I support an independent Kurdish state, I second /u/MoralLesson in saying that the state should declare its sovereignty from Iraq, Turkey, Syria, and Iran itself.   However, I do not believe that the United States should impose its military beliefs onto a new nation. While the spread of democracy is important, we don't want to create a state that essentially has our beliefs imposed onto it in return for support and aid.   We also need to remember that Turkey is very against the idea of a Kurdish state, and Turkey remains one of our better allies in the region. I won't take a stance on this, but it should be known that if the Kurdish state becomes underpowered or falls apart, we may have lost a key ally when writing this bill.  I believe that we should let the Kurds choose what aid they need, whether it be military or humanitarian."
ModelUSGov,3chulw,MoralLesson,9,Wed Jul 8 00:55:09 2015 UTC,"Wow, I think this is a first where every bill went as I wanted:  B.058 is great because it is only fair to treat people who have been in America since before they could remember and whom are productive citizens as citizens. It was passed.  B.059 is pointless because the ASTEROIDS Act was never even passed (and if it was, I'd likely support it anyways). It failed.  B.060 is blatantly unconstitutional in several regards. It failed.  B.062 repeals what is little more than an unconstitutional violation of free speech. It passed.  CR.003 recognizes a historical fact (though I would have also liked a provision stating that we recognize that the Turkish government does not currently support genocidal policies, and that we were committed to working with Turkey to combat present and future genocides around the world). It passed."

ModelUSGov,3cflsc,Xarasystral,10,Tue Jul 7 18:25:43 2015 UTC,"I am sorry to have offended you. I assure you that this is not because I am trying to push a personal agenda. I am just trying to appoint someone similar to prodigiousguy who had to resign. As well as trying to have justices who evenly represent all the different ideologies we have on modelusgov. The fact that justices are biased makes this necessary.  I will not nominate anyone who I feel will try to legislate through the court. I will make sure they are well qualified, and have a desire and enthusiasm to make the court system in this simulation successful.  I assure you that I am considering all applicants regardless of their ideology. I already have a few that are being considered who are very different than justice they are replacing."

ModelUSGov,3cflsc,ModelDenizen,16,Tue Jul 7 19:02:20 2015 UTC,My litmus test for Supreme Court Justices is whether they will follow the Constitution. Not whether they believe in Green or Blue or Red or any other color or revolutionary stance. It would be ideal for the President to understand and respect the historical role of the Supreme Court.
ModelUSGov,3cflsc,Epic_Mile,4,Tue Jul 7 18:37:09 2015 UTC,I third this.
ModelUSGov,3cflsc,pepsibluefan,4,Tue Jul 7 20:04:35 2015 UTC,I agree with this. They should be assigned based on if they will follow the constitution. Other qualifications are important but what party they belong to is not one of them.

ModelUSGov,3cflsc,DidNotKnowThatLolz,6,Wed Jul 8 15:52:44 2015 UTC,I'm disappointed to see Bill 051 vetoed even after support from many members of Congress. I will be initiating a veto override in the House.
ModelUSGov,3cflsc,DidNotKnowThatLolz,4,Tue Jul 7 18:21:59 2015 UTC,I was initially going to sign it and it wasn't until after my Attorney general pointed out the flaws that I decided against signing it. I would urge you to try and rectify the issues that the bill has before initiating a veto override.
ModelUSGov,3cflsc,Logic_85,3,Tue Jul 7 20:01:11 2015 UTC,"With this session of Congress ending very soon, I feel that it is very important that this bill passes as is right now. Any serious problems with the bill can be quickly addressed through amendments to the bill in the next session of Congress.   In failing to pass this bill now, we risk protecting the lives of Americans from potential gun violence. Though this bill is not my ideal vision for gun legislation, it is certainly a step in the right direction. In addition, when the bill was introduced we amended the bill vigorously in order to quell concerns many members had with the bill."
ModelUSGov,3cflsc,DidNotKnowThatLolz,2,Tue Jul 7 20:55:59 2015 UTC,I don't see why we should pass a bill just to amend it to work later.  Why not write a bill that will work and pass that one?
ModelUSGov,3cflsc,Logic_85,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:40:50 2015 UTC,How exactly should the current bill be changed.
ModelUSGov,3cflsc,dakpluto,2,Wed Jul 8 17:44:07 2015 UTC,"The focus should be on the quality and quantity of background checks, and on ensuring mental health issues are appropriately addressed in those background checks.   A 9% tax isn't necessary when states like WA have instituted universal background checks with no additional taxes.   Asking two agencies to oversee appeals to background checks is a fiasco. We have a hard enough time getting appeals through one agency (just look at the VA--there are still Vietnam vets appealing their cases through the VA). You can't just assign an agency to do 95% of the job of congress and wash your hands of the results."

ModelUSGov,3cfjwc,tinymovingtarts,9,Tue Jul 7 14:58:05 2015 UTC,"My only worry is that much of the internet will become pay to use, since often websites let advertisers and ""data crawlers"" use their website for information to cover the costs of running a website.  Without this income, many websites may very well need to charge people for any service they may provide, making the internet much less of a free space than before.  It may also hinder the internet data industries in the USA, considering that if anyone requests their information to be taken down (an obvious valuable asset to any data company) and they must comply, the profit in such business could be questioned.  Foreign companies may spring up to cover this, taking a booming net industry away from the USA.  I feel that this bill only goes to infringe upon the rights of companies; while one should be able to know what information a company may have about them, the right to take this away from the company should not be given."
ModelUSGov,3cfjwc,coldcraft,4,Tue Jul 7 15:36:45 2015 UTC,"I considered that when writing the bill. I think that most people genuinely don't care that their data is being traded, and that's their right. For people who do care about their data being traded, it guarantees an opportunity to protect their privacy. Data collection would still be totally legal under the bill (and continued as-is by default), but should anyone want to opt-out (with or without a fee),  they can.  I don't see this as a threat to business because the vast majority of people don't care about their data being collected and sold. It would likely have an impact, but not such that I would expect it to actually impact a business's ability to conduct business.  Basically it boils down to the option of protection, but not a requirement."
ModelUSGov,3cfjwc,tinymovingtarts,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:58:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I suppose many people don't care in the first place.  It just depends on how many people would be informed, and how opinions would change."
ModelUSGov,3cfjwc,coldcraft,2,Tue Jul 7 22:58:42 2015 UTC,"I think it pretty evenly places the responsibility in that regard on the companies as well as the consumers. At least, that was my intention. Thank you for the feedback."
ModelUSGov,3cfjwc,P0in7B1ank,3,Tue Jul 7 23:11:37 2015 UTC,"By leaving data mining as an opt-out, a very large percent of the population will continue to have their data used. I see it having just about as much effect on data collection as Adblock has on advertisements. It will have an effect, however it will hopefully be negligible to businesses. I forsee it even having less of an impact than adblock, because the average citizen doesn't have data collection being thrown in their face like advertising. Most people won't care, and this will appease the people that do."
ModelUSGov,3cfjwc,tinymovingtarts,3,Tue Jul 7 16:36:10 2015 UTC,"While I do agree with you partially, I think that adblock isn't quite the same as this, since adblock is a third party add-on, though I must admit that I'm not quite sure of it's popularity.  However, data collection has been a neglected topic,  a majority people not even being that aware of what is being collected or if anything is being collected in the first place.  If awareness is raised, and people see the choice between the data mining, more people may say no than expected.  This could go either way, and while the first date of penalty (January 1st, 2017) provides a good amount of testing time and warning, I think first requiring people to be aware of what is happening would be a better start, and then going from there, which has no risk, as opposed to the risk that this could be damaging to business."
ModelUSGov,3cfjwc,P0in7B1ank,2,Tue Jul 7 16:52:57 2015 UTC,"You make a good point, It would be nice to see a ""Trial Run"" of this before it happened."
ModelUSGov,3cfjwc,Zombones,2,Tue Jul 7 17:04:22 2015 UTC,I agree corporations will just start erecting paywalls all across certain and probably important parts of the web and that's rather unacceptable. As much as I hate data trolls I'd rather have my information sold to advertisers and keep large parts of the web free.
ModelUSGov,3cfjwc,Eilanyan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:50:32 2015 UTC,It's opt out...
ModelUSGov,3cfjwc,ExpiredAlphabits,4,Thu Jul 9 16:13:18 2015 UTC,"Section 4. Data trading must be opt-in, not opt out. It's a small difference, but one with a drastic effect. In an opt-out system, the user's data is traded until he realizes that there is an option. By the time he opts out, his data has already been traded and his privacy compromised. Ideally, trade of another person's information would be outright illegal. This bill is certainly a start toward that end."
ModelUSGov,3cfjwc,raysfan95,4,Tue Jul 7 15:41:48 2015 UTC,I support this bill in its current form. The opt out system allows users to protect their privacy while at the same time avoiding the possibility of a pay for use internet that could result from an opt in system.
ModelUSGov,3cfjwc,ExpiredAlphabits,2,Tue Jul 7 16:33:19 2015 UTC,"Opt out doesn't let users protect their privacy. Look at two cases of a user installing a program. In opt-in, before the program starts, there will be a checkbox asking him whether he wants to opt out. If he opts out, he doesn't lose his privacy. In opt-out, that box won't be there at instalation. There will be a checkbox buried in the settings menu that is already checked, compromising privacy. Software moves quickly, and in the seconds that it takes a wary user to dig through the menus, his data will already have been sold. The user would have to track each and every company his data was sold to and request the data be removed. Considering the speed of computers, recovery of lost privacy is an impossible task. That is why sale of data must be opt in."
ModelUSGov,3cfjwc,coldcraft,2,Tue Jul 7 18:11:49 2015 UTC,"I think making the collection opt-in would cause the paywalls that others have suggested. Cutting off the revenue stream entirely would kill a lot of OCPs. I would support making an amendment to add that the opt-out has to be easily accessible before using the product. Making it opt-out would continue the business as-is, while allowing someone the opportunity to work to remove themselves from the trade. It's not perfect, but a lot of damage has already been done and this offers a step to repairing it, albeit it little by little."
ModelUSGov,3cfjwc,ExpiredAlphabits,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:20:54 2015 UTC,"Why should a person work in order to not take part in a trade? If a person doesn't want their privacy compromised and their data sold, they shouldn't have to work for that. That would be like if my car was sold unless every day I logged into a website to opt out of the sale. Denial of that sale should be implicit. In an opt-out system, the acceptance of the sale is implied. This goes against the entire notion of capitalism, that if a deal is poor for one person, they don't have to opt-out. Capitalism is opt-in. Every deal should be opt-in. Sale of personal data must be opt-in."
ModelUSGov,3cfjwc,SgtNicholasAngel,3,Wed Jul 8 02:35:26 2015 UTC,I agree with /u/tinymovingdarts. I would rather have data be sold (although more could be done to regulate it) than have every website be pay-for-use.

ModelUSGov,3ccpm3,ExpensiveFoodstuffs,4,Tue Jul 7 03:01:25 2015 UTC,"1) I'm worried about the stability of Iraq and Afghanistan when US troops are there. There is nothing that will destabilize a country like an imperialist occupation, as the history of the region has shown. The people of Iraq must take control of their country, and I will do whatever I can to ensure this happens.  2) I'm not worried about overpopulation. With a rationalized, socialist economy the United States will have the capacity for many millions more. However, we cannot build socialism in one country. Thus my foreign policy will emphasize that we export our revolution across the continent."

Its there to secure the imperialist interests of the American bourgeoisie and prop up the weak and corrupt rule of the Iraqi and Afghan bourgeois puppets. The withdrawl of American forces is a prerequisite to the Iraqi and Afghan revolutions, which I will support as best I can from Congress.  2) There are already millions crossing our southern border. It practically is an open border. These people are forced to live a life of danger and illegality by our Government. We must welcome them out from the shadows and recognize them as fellow workers, youth, fathers, mothers etc. As a part of the working class they should be building the future of this country and leading it. Millions more will come, and a socialist United States would welcome these refugees from capitalism. Though we can do this, our revolution will fail if it is isolated.

I would say my stances lean somewhat liberal, but I do take some varying stances on other issues. Following is a list stating my views on some key issues, feel free to reply with any questions about any stances I take.  Employment/Jobs: I believe in investing our citizens' tax dollars back into our economy, but I do believe that it is also up to some of our private companies to take the initiative in creating fair paying jobs for our people. I would support tax cuts to businesses that create full time jobs that pay a fair, living wage and provide quality healthcare to its employees. Additionally, I would support an increase of the minimum wage so that it more closely reflects an actual living wage in our great nation.  Schooling: I would support more government funding going towards funding our schools and using more money to make college more affordable to our students. We must bring an end to mountains of student debt in our country.  Healthcare: I believe that all of our citizens should be able to afford to take care of themselves, and we shouldn't live in a country where people are afraid of the potential costs of simple medical procedures. I would, again, support tax cuts for companies that provide full, quality healthcare to its employees that don't leave our citizens on the hook for enormous medical bills.  Civil Rights: I would support advancements in rights for all of our citizens, and bring an end to discrimination in our country. I believe the first place we need to start is ending employment discrimination for gay people. Right now, there are still plenty states where there are no anti-discrimination laws protecting LGBT employees in this country. This has to come to an end.  Women's Rights: I believe that a woman's body is her own, and no one else's. If elected, I would support repealing laws that limit a woman's right to have an abortion or even minimize her access to birth control. I believe that when a woman talks with her doctor, those two should be the only people that have an opinion as to what happens with her body, and any woman should have the final say as to what happens with her body.  Additionally, I would implement an ""Open Inbox"" policy where I would field PMs from the constituents of my region whenever a new bill is proposed, and encourage an open dialogue and create a better flow of ideas between the government and the people.  I hope to have your vote come election time, and I can't wait to represent you great people."

Additionally, any Democratic representatives are chosen by their party, not by the voters. So they would be more inclined to tow a party line, whereas I would act as a direct representative to the people who elected me."

I am currently running as an Independent Centrist and wish to restore the government to it's constitutional limits! I believe my past positions in Model Government make me qualified for the job and I am a veteran member of the subreddit who is willing to challenge the disgustingly far left status-quo. In my tenure in the Central State Assembly I have supported an Article V Convention, submitted bills advocating for more devolved government and individual rights such as the Model Town Council Act, the Cannabis Legalization Act, the Gardener's Bill of Rights, and the Police Reform Act. I have voted down attempts to expand government such as expansion of the income tax in the Central State. In my time as a Representative in /r/MUSGOV I have been appointed Deputy House Whip, joined the Republican Liberty Caucus, and shot down advances to expand gun control and affirmative action. As for personal initiatives I have taken outside of political office, I am also co-chairman of the /r/ModelPotatoLobby which fights for the rights of farmers promoting free trade and growing and grazing rights. My personal views in short are that I'm socially liberal/libertarian and fiscally conservative. I would describe myself as a laissez-faire capitalist, I support full abortion rights for women into the third trimester, gay rights, the legalization of most drugs and the decriminalization of all drugs, implementation of a flat income tax, a non-interventionist foreign policy, limiting the death penalty and lowering military funding to balance the budget.

ModelUSGov,3ccpm3,SomeRealShit,4,Tue Jul 7 00:30:25 2015 UTC,You should label yourself as a Independent Moderate Libertarian but not a Democrat. No Democrat whether in this simulation or IRL would support a flat income tax. Even the most centrist of Third-way Democrats (the centrists of the IRL democrats) nor the Blue dogs (because they are social conservatives) would support your positions. Economic Libertarianism is antithesis to THE core governmental economic belief that has kept the democratic tent up since the New Deal. The idea is that government has a central role in guiding society and in the economy (the degree changes on how left to right you are but it is a core belief).

Although I keep a liberal-sided mindset on many issues, I also pride myself on keeping an open mind. I encourage any and all citizens to question and discuss my views so that I can keep that open mind for the benefit of the public. As a great man once said, ""Opinions should be kept in a box. Throughout your life, you should discard old opinions and bring in new ones as applicable."" But enough of the useless mumbling, let's get to the views shall we? Feel free to comment and ask further questions about any platform.  Reform the Education System  The education system has been broken for a very long time, and many people are aware of that. However, legislation has failed to appear that would create a solution for the innumerous faults. Fixing the education system should've been a top priority ever since the first appearance of problems, since it is responsible for training our future leaders and innovators. Legislation such as the No Child Left Behind act, the Race to the Top program, and Common Core, instead of fixing education and promoting student progress, have created a standardized testing initiative which puts a state test based on inneficient test creators and useless facts over valuable material. However, while reforming the educational take, we also need to put focus on affordable higher education so that those who have the mental ability, have the financial ability. While these acts have attempted to serve their purpose, it's time to reform education.  Promote ""Green"" Energy and Decrease Oil Dependency  The climate scientists have spoken time and time again. The constant abuse of the ozone layer and the environment will come back to haunt future generations if we refuse to start making changes now. While the exact statistics of remaining oil is left to debate, it is a fact that our oil resources are not infinite, we will eventually run out. When we run out, the U.S. will fall into chaos unless we have a plan for when it does. The U.S. should begin introducing larger subsidies for clean energy and begin introducing legislation such as MPG standards to reduce the effect of greenhouse gases and lower the amount of oil purchased and imported.  Find the Middle Ground on Taxation  The middle class have spoken out for more taxation on the richest 1% of society. The richest 1% have spoken out against imposing more taxes and ""punishing"" the rich for their success. The solution? Find the middle ground. It's a given that taxes always have to be adjusted to fit the budget, but not overblown as to drive away investors, businesses, and grind the middle class. In the current global economy, taxation is a major factor in keeping domestic businesses, and that will never change. So in order to avoid overburdening the middle class, and overtaxing/driving away the 1%, we must encourage informed and widespread debate about taxation to eventually reach the coveted middle ground where taxation and the budget can be sufficiently sustained.  Decrease Military Funding  The military budget of the U.S. is larger than the next 5 countries combined. Some may make the statement that such a ""controversial"" country should maintain a military to promote our peacekeeping image and be well ready to defend. While that statement may hold true, some cuts should definitely be on the table for the military budget. Arguably the most important sector of the U.S. budget, education, goes on to be only 6.2% of the federal budget for 2015. Even cutting $100 billion from the military budget would still hold us higher than the next 5 countries combined. We need to start re-imagining the budget to add money where we need it, by taking it off where we constantly overspend.  Feel free to ask questions about any position I have taken, or request an explaination on a position I didn't explain."
ModelUSGov,3ccpm3,theSolomonCaine,2,Tue Jul 7 03:46:14 2015 UTC,What kind of reform do you propose for education system in order to help our young people in America?
ModelUSGov,3ccpm3,da_drifter0912,2,Tue Jul 7 04:55:29 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you asked.  Cut Inefficient Education Related Acts and Prevent Future Inefficient Programs  I could ramble all day about all of the negative repercussions that the No Child Left Behind act and Race to the Top has brought to the American education system. My answer is that we completely do away with inefficient federal regulation dealing with education. This means repealing NCLB and preventing programs like Race to the Top from even making their way into any form of respected legislation.   Cut the Department of Education and Withdrawl the Federal Education Budget  The Department of Education was established in 1980 to ""strengthen the federal commitment"" to education and ""supplement and complement the efforts of states"". However, instead of actually performing this task, the Department of Education has become an intense bureaucracy with high administrative costs. In 2007, the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program had administrative costs equal to 8% of the grants given out. On top of intense bureaucracy and high costs, the Department has failed to produce any significant results. Cutting both the Department of Education and inefficient legislation removes the glass ceiling from each state. Instead of conforming to federal standards and being forced to fit a quota, states will be able to once again experiment and find their own standards and ways to improve education, without hampering restrictions and constant testing initiatives. However, another cut that needs to be made is student loans, the remainder of the education budget. Recently, the Federal Bank of New York conducted research which had some interesting results. This research has come out to say that federal student loans are actually a hinderance when it comes to college. Federal student loans are actually driving up the cost of education rather than making it easier for students to pay. In order to wipe out the federal education budget, we must also remove federal student loans which are increasing tuition and allow students to rely on other institutions for loans."
ModelUSGov,3ccpm3,theSolomonCaine,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:26:22 2015 UTC,"And you don't think that those students will be subject to even higher interest rates borrowing from private creditors? Additionally, what about the students whose parents can't co-sign? What are they supposed to do but simply accept that there is no way for them to get higher education?   It is telling that you have said a lot about what you don't like about the higher education system and nothing about what you would replace it with."
ModelUSGov,3ccpm3,BobJoe25000,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:15:59 2015 UTC,"The higher education system is in a very difficult situation which cannot be fixed by the mind of one person. Studies have been produced showing that Federal Student Loans are causing an increase in tuition, but here's the thing, enrollment isn't increasing along with the higher tuition. Federal Student Loans are causing a definite problem, and to be honest, I cannot tell you the answer. But I can tell you that Federal Student Loans will permanently damage the ability for lower income children to head to a higher education if we do not fix them. As like other issues, we need to contact experts such as economists and the latter and figure out a definite solution that will work."
ModelUSGov,3ccpm3,theSolomonCaine,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:22:49 2015 UTC,"What are your stances on pertinent social issues like abortion, same-sex ""marriage"", and the death penalty?"
ModelUSGov,3ccpm3,MoralLesson,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:17:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the question.  Abortion  I hate to be so cynical, but sometimes it's just a requirement. Before a baby is born, it acts as a parasite to get the nutrients it needs. Who harbors these nutrients? The mother. The mother is the one who either willingly, forced, or unexpectedly gained the unborn child. If the mother believes for any reason that the child shouldn't make it to the world, being the parasite that it is, she has every right to have an abortion. That's the bottom line.  Same-Sex Marriage  While same-sex relationships get a mention in the bible, marriage doesn't. And rightfully so, the etymology of the word marriage traces back to 1300. So the point here is, marriage is not a concept owned by Christianity. Freedom of religion doesn't mean conforming to religion, and that's what our government is trying to get away from. The government should have no hand in promoting or denouncing any religion, and the same-sex marriage ban was rooting in Christianity. Removing it was another towards becoming a religion-neutral government.  The Death Penalty  One of the most common complaints with the death penalty is false incrimination. However, false incrimination becomes a lesser possibility as we go through the U.S. due process system. Yet, some people are still false incriminated, even after due process. On top of that, there is the moral question of whether the government killing a citizen with full intention is correct. I believe that it is possible to abolish the death penalty, but that would force a full reform of the prison system and law code, which could possibly be too costly and time consuming. Therefore, the only thing I believe we can do is retain a high criminal standard for using the death penalty."

ModelUSGov,3ccpm3,theSolomonCaine,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:27:19 2015 UTC,"I am /u/FlamingTaco7101 running for the House of Representatives from the South Atlantic region. My views are aligned with the Whig party. My largest issue with current government is frivolous spending.  Campaign Poster  Economy  The economy is at the center of my campaign.  Employment  First in the economy is employment. My belief is that tax money is necessary to fund the economy. A large percent of funds should go to keeping the economy stable, after all, there is no point in tax without a stable economy.  Benefits  I believe worker benefits should be variable based on the work being done. There should be government ratings for every type of employment, agreed upon by a board of representatives.  Social Issues  In the case of woman's rights, I believe a woman has the same opportunity to participate in all the same areas as men. I also believe abortions are to be given to a woman based on her ability to support a child. Unhealthy, mentally unfit women should be given abortions, whereas healthy, stable women should not be given abortions, and instead be suggested to give their child to an adoption agency.  Education  At the heart of the nation is education. Education relies on students being well educated and provided for. An important part of education is also low costs.  Tuition  Student tuition should be kept the same. However, colleges should pay a tax to the government dependent on student population and test scores.  Crime  To keep a nation stable, one must always consider crime. A nation's police force is responsible for criminal justice.  Police Funds  Tax dollars should be divvied between a nation's police forces dependent on police effectiveness and criminal population.

ModelUSGov,3c90o0,SeptimusSette,6,Mon Jul 6 00:54:33 2015 UTC,"My biggest opposition is that this may just flood mental health fields rather than increase awareness and knowledge.  I'd prefer increased research funding compared to payment for tuition, considering that this may create many ""hack"" psychiatrists who could simply be doing it for the free education and a lucrative field.  An awareness campaign would naturally create interest, compared to just throwing money at anyone willing to study for the degree."
ModelUSGov,3c90o0,tinymovingtarts,5,Tue Jul 7 01:17:09 2015 UTC,I am unable to find a peer-reviewed post-analysis of the cited National Alliance on Mental Illness study.  My concern is the definition for mental illness was too broad for the study.
ModelUSGov,3c90o0,LibNE,4,Mon Jul 6 15:13:02 2015 UTC,"I feel like this program should be state-implemented and not federally so. Moreover, I feel like there is not enough training for public employees to recognize the mentally ill. It is great to provide mental health care, but the people who need it also need to be recognized. You should also look into strengthening the power of courts to recommend someone to a mental health institute."
ModelUSGov,3c90o0,MoralLesson,3,Mon Jul 6 01:04:17 2015 UTC,"This is a great point. I believe states could individually do this in a more efficient manner than the federal government. Yeah, this may lead to some states being less efficient at providing mental care, but over time this will change."

The number of psychiatric hospitals versus units has been declining at a steady rate since 1995.  In terms of units, there was a significant dip between 2004-2006 with a slight recovery before a massive plunge.  As of 2010, less than 450 psych hospitals checked in with approximately 285 units available. To put that into perspective, in 2003, there were roughly 475 hospitals with about 525 units available.  The only way I'd even consider someone behind a bench recommending commitment is if he or she had a firm background in psych and at least one other psych professional could diagnose the person in question.  I can understand looking at this bill and saying ""Wow! This is a lot and to put it out there so quickly!"" We are a nation that needs help now and putting the tools into the hands of our children and those who want to return to school is a major step towards that."

I think taking smaller steps to address the problem of mental illness would be more likely to succeed in the long run than rolling out this huge initiative which would go into effect less than six months from now.

While I understand the concern regarding states taking the lead on this, I can't help but express how much I feel the acknowledgement on a federal level would show our commitment to our citizens' well being.  I think all members, regardless of party, can agree that we want a nation of healthy Americans with a high quality of life.

My suggestions are   Cut the school funding a little, and instead put that towards lowering the cost of medication, because it has been a notable problem in keeping with treatment for many individuals Make pamphlet screening tests widely available, and mandatory for employers to give on a annual basis. These screening pamphlet's have shown to be one of the easiest ways to weed out mental illness. Give employers a small tax break for this, just enough that they make money enough for the hassle and cost."
ModelUSGov,3c90o0,mojo45678,3,Mon Jul 6 01:32:38 2015 UTC,"Wholeheartedly agree with number one, this bill could help the mentally ill along with those treating the mentally ill as well if we lower the cost of medication."

For example, a 30-day supply of a very helpful drug known as Depakote can run 200-300 dollars out of pocket.  I like the idea behind No. 2, but there does need to be protection for employees as /u/ScaryRed and /u/coldcraft suggested."
ModelUSGov,3c90o0,OldTimeyPugilist,2,Mon Jul 6 13:43:56 2015 UTC,"Protection is fairly easy i feel. There are plenty of places to make anonymous tips about employer wrong doing, and every checkup, physical or mental, will ask if they have taken a screening pamphlet recently. We can then levy punishments by taking away the tax break to top it all off."
ModelUSGov,3c90o0,mojo45678,3,Mon Jul 6 16:53:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with both points, but I think number one should go a little further.

However, if you had that opportunity and were told not only are we going to help you gain this education through a reduction in financial burden, but you can also gain valuable experience via a program which will give you even MORE relief and actual experience giving care, why wouldn't you take that deal?  We're not discussing the mentally disabled here. There are people working every job imaginable with mental illnesses that we cannot see.

Even the claim that 1 in 4 Americans has a mental disorder could be off depending on what the definition of ""mental disorder"" is. Additionally, I have concerns with the government subsidizing certain careers, as others in this thread have echoed.   I would not protest an awareness campaign, but as another user in this thread posted, a program like this already exists.  It's a no for me."

The NHSC specifically says medical, dental and mental/behavioral health clinicians can get up to $50,000, so I feel $40,000 is a good compromise if we really want to move in that direction."

ModelUSGov,3c90o0,OldTimeyPugilist,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:07:43 2015 UTC,"I would rather have psychiatrists receive the tuition reimbursement after licensure as a board-certified psychiatrist, rather than while they are a student.  The bill is also vague here: ""The NHSC will assist any student who is studying to become a psychiatrist, psychologist or is entering a psychiatric research field by giving them $50,000 towards any loan forgiveness in a lump sum.""  I could argue that a biology undergrad student is studying to become a doctor, but he's not in a formalized study in a MD program at a med school. One could also argue that a psychology or biology student at an undergraduate institution is studying to become a psychiatrist. Are we going to offer this reimbursement to undergrad students, regardless of what their professional or educational careers look like after they receive their bachelor's degree?"
ModelUSGov,3c90o0,thesuperrad,2,Tue Jul 7 23:49:00 2015 UTC,"Good question. The idea behind the two-year period before any reimbursement comes is to ensure the student is studying the proper material to become a member of the psychiatric community.  The idea is to tie the commitment of the student with the knowledge that their debt will be significantly lowered.  That being said, we're on the same page in terms of wanting to know the commitment level. Even a determination of specialty during Master's education seems appropriate to me.   The key is to give a sense of relief to the student during their education. The question you and I are posed is at what point does that happen? If we can come to an agreement, I'd be happy to amend the bill."
ModelUSGov,3c90o0,OldTimeyPugilist,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:35:09 2015 UTC,"What do you define as mental illness? Would things such as ADD, and ADHD fall under it? Would things like even depression even fall under it? What of those that had a history, but no longer suffer from it?I would think that instead of psychology, work in the bio-medical field would be much more beneficial. Would those that are in college now be eligible, or would you need to be a freshmen starting in the fall?  Also what happens to the money if the person changes their major, drops-outs, or goes to a institute that doesn't require as much as 50K? I could see this being abused where one would just switch their major to get the 50k, and then afterwards switch it right back.  I don't like the section three where they can get up to 70% of the cost back for basically doing nothing but picking a major, especially since they would get it from a program that they didn't even sign anything with. Why not give it to those that are actually deserving of it that show an actual interest in the field; have a high GPA, or make them have to do things like internships at the NHSC to learn how things work?  I cannot support it in its current form."

We have a skills crisis when it comes to other medical professionals that needs to be addressed first. There needs to be a focus on legislation that will make education more affordable for medical doctors. The only portion of this bill that I agree with is the 70% refund but that should be for individuals that have completed their second year of medical and registered with the NHSC only. We need to be stewards of the economic well being of the country as well as for the health of the citizens."
ModelUSGov,3c90o0,davecat20,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:28:30 2015 UTC,"I feel that a better option to raise mental health awareness would be to mandate training for educators and emergency services personel (like EMTs and Police Officers who frequently interact with the mentally ill), and to require all schools, public and private, to provide a minimum level of education on mental health issues.

ModelUSGov,3c90i4,SeptimusSette,5,Mon Jul 6 00:53:00 2015 UTC,"I feel like the idea proposed in the preamble and the actual sections of this bill delineate two different things.

ModelUSGov,3c90i4,MoralLesson,5,Mon Jul 6 01:02:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the bill is so vague that it doesn't seem like it would accomplish anything. Is there a committee that could detail the tax system and report on how the principles of this bill could be implemented?"
ModelUSGov,3c90i4,da_drifter0912,3,Mon Jul 6 01:33:34 2015 UTC,Hmm I agree. I like the idea behind but it seems extremely vague. Especially for something like taxation you really want to go the extra mile and avoid vagueness.  Consider section 3. What constitutes appropriate appeals? What is the appeals process - who do I complain to? And so on.

I can only see this becoming a mess of anti-government / anti-tax people complaining and overloading tax preparation companies en mass."
ModelUSGov,3c90i4,Seattle_man_123,2,Mon Jul 6 01:50:56 2015 UTC,that's a really good point. I'd say you'd need to create an entire new agency for this however that would make this bill impossible to pass since I highly doubt any right wing conservative is willing to create more bureaucrats. Head back to the drawing board on that part since it seems to operate under the notion that everyone plays fair

ModelUSGov,3c90i4,President_Dweezus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:41:30 2015 UTC,Which is a good thing. There needs to be a check on what is usually unchecked. Directly by the people.   This won't turn into the Tea Party challenging taxes every day because they simply won't have a case. But it will prevent the IRS and political leaders from abusing the IRS and targeting specific groups.
ModelUSGov,3c90i4,TheWarlockk,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:33:59 2015 UTC,Right now everyone does their own. How would 10-30% of taxpayers (I think that's insanely high but whatever) deciding to do it themselves overload the system? Is still less then status quo.
ModelUSGov,3c90i4,Eilanyan,5,Mon Jul 6 20:41:03 2015 UTC,"Section 2: (Income Tax for Individuals, couples, and businesses) State/IRS computers calculate and prepare a tax return form based on how many hours/salaries/pay the person made in the previous year, then it's a matter of signing the form if and when the person agrees to it.   The IRS currently does this for people when people don't report their taxes.  It is almost always wrong.  This bill ignores so much about what makes our tax system great.  What about deductions for children?  The IRS has no idea how many kids you have unless you tell them.  What if you adopted a child and need to alter your deduction?    What about charitable contributions and deductions for those?  The IRS does not track that throughout the year.    What if you bought a house and want to deduct the interest from the house?  What if you sold your house and bought a new one?    You are proposing a ""Big Brother"" style of IRS that knows everything about you so they can just do your taxes for you, when the average person doesn't have a complicated tax situation.    This would not help anyone with complicated tax issues, such as small businesses, because the IRS cannot reasonably prepare a tax return for a small business due to the complexity of the business."
ModelUSGov,3c90i4,Logic_85,3,Mon Jul 6 16:20:43 2015 UTC,"I just feel like this will lead to many citizens feeling that the US Gov is overcharging them, and it will only take one failed appeal for the system to become the butt of controversy.   Answer me this: Why do we need this? Yeah, taxes are a drag once a year, but that's it: once a year. After that you have 365 more days until another drag. I highly doubt we need an entire agency also acting as our tax preparers.  Will this also take into account any tax breaks? Any credits? Donations?   Will this stop companies from participating in tax loopholing?"
ModelUSGov,3c90i4,Xarasystral,3,Mon Jul 6 01:35:22 2015 UTC,"This would only create a mess of people who oppose what their taxes are.  I feel that calculating taxes let people understand their taxes, removing this only creates doubt and paranoia.  How would this take into account charitable donations that may be made through out the year?  Overall I feel the bill is kind of ambiguous, ambitious, and overall too unplanned."
ModelUSGov,3c90i4,tinymovingtarts,2,Tue Jul 7 01:35:25 2015 UTC,"I'll repeat exactly what I said during the in-party discussion   This doesn't do much to describe the actual numbers behind the system, do tax brackets change? Does the percent of income per bracket change? Also if you're going to allow someone to challenge the tax and submit their own estimate, at what point do you stop? Or are millions of Americans going to have to find 3rd party tax Arbitrators? That sounds like it would make things more complicated."

ModelUSGov,3c90i4,ExpensiveFoodstuffs,2,Mon Jul 6 04:52:08 2015 UTC,"I think the bill should be amended to an ""opt-in"" system instead. Specifically, I think the current process of filing taxes should be the default method and the new, simpler method proposed in the legislation would be something individuals could voluntarily enroll in.   Also, Section 3 is way too vague. It's unclear how the appeal process would actually work."
ModelUSGov,3c90i4,LyraShae,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:51:04 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of simplifying the tax process, but I fear that this might be taking it a step too far. Some people like to feel that they are in control of their taxes, not that the government is in control of them. Also, I don't like the idea of everyone's tax situation being boiled down to a few questions. Yeah, for some citizens, it is that simple, but some major hedge fund managers with hands in many corporations should not have the same tax filing process as a 15-year old kid bagging groceries at a grocery store."
ModelUSGov,3c90i4,kalving,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:53:39 2015 UTC,"I feel any reform to the Income Tax Act should come in the form of leveling the field between the rich and the poor.

ModelUSGov,3c5237,Danotto94,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:32:34 2015 UTC,Why don't we eliminate the root cause for why have an intel network in the first place e.g. not promoting warfare anymore?
ModelUSGov,3c5237,jogarz,3,Mon Jul 6 14:35:02 2015 UTC,"If you think intelligence networks exist to ""promote warfare"" you're sorely mistaken. The CIA is very important for counter-terrorism. It helps America stay in the know about what's going on under the surface of everything. Decisions should be made with as much information as possible, and the CIA helps us get that information.  Plus, how will Middle School students do their geography projects without the World Factbook?"
ModelUSGov,3c5237,Danotto94,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:44:46 2015 UTC,I'm not saying it promotes warfare but rather it's a result of it. It really seems like you agree with the NSA's immoral spying. The World Factbook has non-privacy-invasive facts AFAIK which is different.
ModelUSGov,3c5237,jogarz,2,Mon Jul 6 14:48:24 2015 UTC,It really seems like you agree with the NSA's immoral spying.   Way to jump the gun. I say this at all. You do realize the NSA and the CIA are different organizations with different roles. You're stereotyping and strawmaning me.   The World Factbook has non-privacy-invasive facts AFAIK which is different.   That was a joke.
ModelUSGov,3c5237,SolidBlues,3,Mon Jul 6 15:06:29 2015 UTC,"Or still allowing assassinations?   It's not like passing this would actually stop that. It's already ""illegal"" internationally."

ModelUSGov,3c5237,locosherman1,3,Sun Jul 5 02:33:00 2015 UTC,What would you like done instead of an apology? Reparations? I would agree with reparations.
ModelUSGov,3c5237,Gohte,3,Sun Jul 5 00:04:23 2015 UTC,It implements action to stop it in form of fining and charging business interests. I agree that it should be more specific and add more ways to actually implement action.   It really doesn't. It's written more in the form of 'someone should do something about this' than in the form of taking action. This bill in its current form is useless and ineffective.
ModelUSGov,3c5237,Eilanyan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:58:59 2015 UTC,"Was told by mods this could not be massaged into a bill with teeth as that is realm of executive branch.

ModelUSGov,3c5237,MoralLesson,8,Sun Jul 5 00:04:26 2015 UTC,"As much as I would like the United States to reach out to Latin America and stop unnecessary coups, this resolution has no force. What I'd prefer to see is the President reaching out to Latin America, more of our foreign aid budget going to Latin American countries rather than Pakistan, and a Congressional resolution supporting more cooperation and state visits. We can learn from Latin American nations just as they can learn from us."
ModelUSGov,3c5237,Epic_Mile,2,Sun Jul 5 23:14:22 2015 UTC,I agree completely.
ModelUSGov,3c5237,risen2011,5,Sat Jul 4 22:34:53 2015 UTC,"This bill is like putting a band-aid on a bullet wound. This country has hurt so many people in so many ways due to our imperialistic policies in Latin America.   They don't need an apology, they need reparations!"
ModelUSGov,3c5237,risen2011,3,Sun Jul 5 03:08:05 2015 UTC,"Reparations are unnecessary and unneeded.    No, we have a responsibility to fix the damage that we have done.    We need to stop the source of the problem by stop conducting the actions. In addition, we need to seriously look at the drug war as it has massive effects on Latin America.   True, but still that's not nearly enough to ensure that the effects from American imperialism in Latin america cease to exist."
ModelUSGov,3c5237,oughton42,2,Sat Jul 4 22:58:56 2015 UTC,"These Latin American countries (as well as others elsewhere) were completely wrecked by American Imperialism. It's therefore the responsibility of America to pay for its crimes; whether or not the specific generation responsible is still alive is irrelevant, we have a moral duty to help fix the countries that American interventionist policies have done immense damage to."
ModelUSGov,3c5237,oughton42,2,Sat Jul 4 23:54:34 2015 UTC,"If my father killed someone, do I have a moral duty to pay the victim's family?   You most certainly do if you're directly benefiting from the ""murder,"" as the U.S. benefited from the subjugation of Latin American countries.   Likewise, if the USA pays, then so should the European powers.   I agree, I never said they shouldn't have to.   We have no way to accurately see how much damage we have done to these countries. Then we also have problems of damages that do not have monetary price. Imagine how much we destroyed in terms of life, cultural values, etc.   That doesn't mean it shouldn't be done. We can't just ignore our moral responsibility because it might be a bit difficult.   Even then, the first priority needs to be stopping US imperialism. Then, and only then, should we be debating reparations.   Is there some reason we can't do both?"
ModelUSGov,3c5237,risen2011,2,Sun Jul 5 00:14:30 2015 UTC,"I refuse to accept any bill that has reparations. It is an affront to our own people to force them to pay for damages that has been caused since before they were born. Unless any of us were adults during the 1950's, I do not see why we should pay for the imperialism that the Eisenhower administration carried out in Guatemala.   You seem unaware that the United States actively funded the Contras and other right-wing Latin American groups well into the 1980s. I'm sure many people were adults then.   I do not see why we should pay for the imperialism that the Eisenhower administration carried out in Guatemala.   We should because we have a moral responsibility to. The imperialism that Eisenhower carried out on Guatemala made this government even stronger and more powerful in global affairs. It is this government who should have the burden. Would we increase taxes for this purpose? Absolutely not, instead we should take it out of the DOD, the main department responsible for imperialism.    We must stop imperialism, but to pay for actions that none of us had anything to do with is disgusting in my opinion.    Didn't you just admit that this government tried to overthrow a democratically elected Guatemalan government. This imperialism has everything to do with us. We are one of the main causes of discontent in Latin America. To do nothing is truly disgusting.    Reparations wont do anything unless we stop imperialism first.   True, but this bill doesn't do that. Reparations should be paired with DOD cuts and limitations on the DOD's, CIA's and NSA's reach."
ModelUSGov,3c5237,AMatterofTrust,6,Sun Jul 5 00:25:35 2015 UTC,"This bill is incredibly vague. Also you want for the US not to support capitalism in Latin America? And how does this support human rights abuses? It effectively prevents the US from helping out the government of Colombia, which I would argue, is to the benefit of the Colombian people. The Colombian government is capitalist, the rebel group employing human rights abuses is FARC, so section 2 effectively causes human rights abuses.   What is wrong with pushing through policies supporting capitalism?Are you implying groups supporting communism were any better? FARC? Communist insurgencies in El Salvador? The current government in Cuba? The current government in Venezuela?   Also, which cooperation committed fraud, murder, treason? Can you name one? Which cooperation committed a crime???I do not understand the purpose of section 3, if somebody is compliant in murder, they get charged under current rules. If you are implying that we charge cooperation for laws that do not even exist yet, as it appears you are, this bill is very bad.   Also, constitutionality issue, Congress has no power to do any of the above. **That power rests with the executive branch, the president is the commander in chief.  What does section one mean? Mass death or destruction do you want to prevent the USA from assisting Latin America in war efforts as it assists Colombia and other nations? Doing so, I would argue, causes more death and destruction, around two years ago the CIA assassinated FARC leaders, which has had more effect on peace than years and years of war.   In short, this bill is vague and misguided, and based on reactionary and politically biased thinking, without regard of the delicate reality of the situation in Latin America. I urge strongly a no vote."
ModelUSGov,3c5237,Gohte,5,Sun Jul 5 00:35:54 2015 UTC,Are you aware of the extensive history of American hegemony in Latin America?
ModelUSGov,3c5237,AMatterofTrust,3,Sun Jul 5 00:44:12 2015 UTC,"Yes. But taking absolutist positions (A is absolutely bad, B is absolutely good) is heavily false. I gave examples showing A is not absolute. I am aware of counter-examples, I am simply pointing out both exist. Nothing I have said denies the history you are putting forward. But what I am saying is like all history, thee are multiple points of view, especially with an area as large and diverse as Latin America."
ModelUSGov,3c5237,Eilanyan,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:49:25 2015 UTC,"This bill doesn't take any absolutist positions at all. It doesn't even mention socialism or the socialist movements in Latin America. It merely recognizes the massive crimes of the United States in that continent, like funding death squads who committed genocide and beheaded villagers, like supporting a general who led a coup against his own country's elected government, like engaging in drug trade to continue funding brutal militias. I don't see what's so controversial about this bill."
ModelUSGov,3c5237,IGotzDaMastaPlan,2,Sun Jul 5 00:41:00 2015 UTC,"Ironically by making this CR so uncontroversial, we have been lambasted by all sides >_>"
ModelUSGov,3c5237,evanb_,9,Sun Jul 5 00:14:23 2015 UTC,Section 2 seems very politically biased. Would it still be legal to install officials who push Socialism?

ModelUSGov,3c5237,oughton42,3,Sun Jul 5 14:50:27 2015 UTC,"This bill is dangerous for America as well as Latin America. Not only does section 1 severely limit US power abroad, buf section 3 is too vague. Essentially any contact between corporations and foreign governments would constitute a violation of section 3 causing, for example, the act of the negotiation of tax rates for opening manufacturing facility punishable by treason."
ModelUSGov,3c5237,shwag945,3,Sun Jul 5 15:30:50 2015 UTC,"This bill shines a very accusing light on, what seems to be, only the United States.  Many of these countries in Latin America, like Guatemala to name one, seemed to already be internally corrupt before any american company or government intervention occurred.  To say the state of these Latin American countries is solely due to the U.S. is not telling the whole story.  What about Spain's involvement in the initial setup of many of these countries?"
ModelUSGov,3c5237,SomeRealShit,4,Sun Jul 5 23:52:57 2015 UTC,"Yes yes yes. This can only be improved by applying it globally. End U.S. Imperialism.  Edit: It should be noted that I do agree with my comrades that Reparations are also necessary. While I obviously believe the U.S. should admit its enormous track record of interfering in the matters of other nations and end its revisionist policies of its own history, it is ultimately little more than an empty gesture. This does not mean, however, that it shouldn't be done."
ModelUSGov,3c5237,Gohte,3,Mon Jul 6 01:33:31 2015 UTC,"Isn't giving reparations the same thing as extending U.S. Imperialism by one payment? The only difference between the final payment of U.S. support to client states and reparations is a note that says sorry.    There is no guarantee the money will actually go to victims of anti-communist rebels and dictators. The money could very well just go into the pockets of corrupt officials. Really depends on the country.   What matters way more than words or money is actions. Those actions are to improve future relations. Recognizing the interests and voices of the Latin American countries. For example, the U.S. re-establishing relations with Cuba has dramatically improved relations across the board in Latin America."

ModelUSGov,3c5237,NicholasNCS2,2,Sun Jul 5 06:00:41 2015 UTC,"There seems to be some confusion on this. This was originally a bill that included reparations and ending the War on Drugs but was too massive in scope. This draft was trying to understand the realities of American imperialism and capitalism, but not to denounce capitalism in its entirety. Reparations and ending War on Drugs was too broad for this bill idea, and after submission was told this could not be enacted as a bill but as a CR. The ALP want's these ideas to have sharper teeth but we don't have the executive power to do so."
ModelUSGov,3c5237,ryanhat,2,Sat Jul 4 22:18:11 2015 UTC,"Great idea. End all intervention.  Also, ending all foreign aid would be a good amendment."

Those crimes will depend on the situation but can include but are not limited to treason, fraud, accomplice to murder, etc. As determined by attorney General.   This is incredibly confusing. What is meant by ""intervening in local politics""? Further, who are you referring to in regards to ""the heads of corporations""?

Certain sections of the bill seem incredibly strange, though, such as this:   Section 2: Stop exporting human rights abuses through installing compliant officials that push through policies that support capitalism.   Needless to say, I am by no means pro-capitalist, but it's not up to us to make a bill preventing capitalist officials from taking office. If the workers vote for a pro-capitalist politician, there isn't much us leftists can do except agitate.

Look through that thread that announced the Silver Legion, and /u/AlphaEpsilon expressed himself in a perfectly mature manner, despite the petty insults and uninformed accusations of other parties. He made it clear we did not support racial theories, rather that we merely would have National Socialists in our party. https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelUSGov/comments/3bxzjj/silver_legion_party_announcement/csqmp0p  One member in this thread had the audacity to state that Alpha wanted war over cooperation with other parties. What utter revisionism. Alpha said this in an introductionary thread in the Fascist sub:   Therefore, it is absolutely necessary that we respect them and do not use slander, cursewords, etc. against them. They want to look like fools and talk down to us, so be it, I strive for us to be seen as mature members who can and will always put up a good debate on every legislation, news piece, etc.   Unfortunately on one or two occassions he lost his cool, but I think it wrong and misleading to imply he was notably immature, for in comparison to the baseless accusations of the so-called Green-Left he was a saint.  He was silly to dupe like that, although the shadowban has now been lifted so I wonder how far the accusations in this post are true. If we wish to be a fascist party though, we should have a shred of honour, and that honour would mean not kicking our ex-leader when he was down, who was the major driving force behind the foundation of our party, and the bringing together of it.   I know the other parties will declare this all nonsense, but I see no obvious examples of serious misbehaviour in the announcement thread, nor do I think it fair to compare that silly PM with the endless hounding of a moderator by a certain party. To my fellow party members, you have disgraced yourself by such a pathetic apologetic manner to those who want us dead."

ModelUSGov,3c1c0b,Caterpiller101,3,Sat Jul 4 15:01:44 2015 UTC,"While those may be insults, I believe it will have arisen out of an infuriation with the constant insults of Nazi and racism, amongst other things, from the Green-Left. They said the same sorts of things that you say Alpha said.  If we must be quite so limiting in this, I would request you avoid the use of a curse word.  And, the fact remains that, as long as the Green-Left harrassed a member to the point he deleted his account, and as long as the behaviour of the Green-Left forced the creation of /r/MUSGOV to escape the behaviour of the Green-Left, Alpha will be a saint compared to the Green-Left."

And settle also says that he sent insulting messages, and there are Skype logs of it. He has a ton of shit against him, it's no wonder that he got banned.  Until the green-lefts do behavior that leads to their banning by an unbiased mod, they will be better than him.  Also, everyone here is simply saying that he sucks, not every fascist.

My concern is that the moderators are acting trigger happy with the Silver Legion, but not with others. It is my view that either we must apply the rules more casually, or we must be exceptionally strict with them. As it is, it appears as though there is exceptional strictness against Alpha (initially, since his initial ban was not related to the brigading), but rather more casually to the rest.  In that sense, Alpha has not behaved in a manner out of line with the rest of this model world, and as my once leader I will defend him vehemently on this front."

I actually intend on running for leadership of the party, and intend to focus on inter party diplomacy, and especially working with the Communist Party.

ModelUSGov,3c1d8w,kalving,9,Fri Jul 3 23:44:51 2015 UTC,"1.It shall now be required that the mother of a child who enters labor and delivers a child is given a mandatory minimum paid leave of four weeks.   Why only 4 weeks? As you mentioned other countries:   Switzerland: 3 months (Father: 0 weeks) Norway: 10.5 months (Father: 10 weeks) European Union: 20 weeks Sweden: 450 days (Mother or Father can choose how many of those they want each) etc.    1.Salaried employees shall recieve a minimum seven days of paid vacation time.   Other countries have 4 weeks and more   1.It shall now be required that an employee receive seven days of paid sick leave a year, this time does not have to be used consecutively, this time does not accumulate and must be used before the end of the year.   That sounds like 7 days of paid vacation. What if I get the flue and am home for a full week? Can I then only get sick for 2 days without running to a professional?  I would rather like to see 2 days without the approval of a trained medical professional and after the 3 day it is mandatory to have approval of a trained medical professional. Without any restriction for 7 days per year."
ModelUSGov,3c1d8w,bluefisch200,3,Fri Jul 3 21:50:34 2015 UTC,"I agree that these specific  leaves should be extended more than proposed. In regards to maternity leave, I believe that both the mother and the father should get a sum of days as this gives both parents the most freedom to choose how to take care of their children. In regards to sick and vacation leave, 4 weeks or maybe slightly less should be set aside as ""free"" days. The requirement to see a medical professional after a set amount of days is also a good incentive to both make people generally healthier and also get people able to work again as soon as they can."
ModelUSGov,3c1d8w,NarwhalNerd,7,Sat Jul 4 04:41:44 2015 UTC,"I like this bill a lot, although I think the paid maternity leave doesn't provide enough money with the amount being 50% of their average income. Other than that, this is great."

ModelUSGov,3c1d8w,da_drifter0912,4,Fri Jul 3 23:45:37 2015 UTC,"After a second reading of the bill, I would also like to address Section 5. I feel as though harsher penalties should be placed upon those who violate the EEOC laws. Specifically, for larger businesses. According to the US Census, businesses with 5,000 employees or more consist of 1/4 of the total business workforce. This means the bigger businesses grow exponentially with regards to employment numbers. As a result, I feel they should have to pay more for violations, as the larger companies should be role models for the public. Below I have a revises list of fines.   For employers with 500-1500 employees, the fine is $400,000. For employers with 1500-2500 employees, the fine is $500,000 For employers with 2500-9999 employees, the fine is $650,000 For employers with more than 10,000 employees, the fine is $800,000, and personal compensation to the employee harmed, in the form of extra time off ranging from 7-14 paid days off from work.   I really like this law, and with a few improvements would happily support it."

I get this means it must be offered, but must it be accepted? I see serious problems when the owner of a small buisness or someone who simply cant be replaced at their job must take a month off. This would severely harm many buisnesses. My own argument against also includes whether it can be opted out of, as it could create a ""culture of opting out"", something also awful. So while I support this idea behind the bill, I cannot support it until the wording is clearly defined by the legislation."
ModelUSGov,3c1d8w,TurkandJD,4,Sat Jul 4 04:32:02 2015 UTC,"Mandatory to be offered; not mandatory to be taken by the employee, that's why vacation time accumulates."
ModelUSGov,3c1d8w,mistermonr0e,2,Sat Jul 4 11:50:51 2015 UTC,I think it should be mandatory as it benefits the health of the whole population. It will save money which usually is needed because people get psychological or physiological illnesses' due to not taking vacations. I think it should not be mandatory to take it every year if the worker doesn't want to but at least every second one.
ModelUSGov,3c1d8w,bluefisch200,3,Sat Jul 4 06:06:55 2015 UTC,"I still don't know, theres a fine line between the wording that could create situations like, ""Oh God, if I take a month off my business will go under"" or ""Oh God, if I take a month off I'll never get that promotion, or they'll fire me""."
ModelUSGov,3c1d8w,TurkandJD,2,Sat Jul 4 06:15:07 2015 UTC,"In many European countries this is reality. And they do just fine. My father worked for a very big financial company in Switzerland and was forced to take at least 3 weeks of his 6 weeks of vacation.  Maybe we can enforce a certain amount (like you have the right for 4 weeks but have to take at least 2) for employees and allow small business owners (who need to work) to get an exception from the rule (as they usually are not the ones who create bad working conditions).  The cost created in the healthcare system due to Burnouts and so on is substantial. I know people may want to work more but they are hurting themselves and in the end all of us due to the cost their illness creates.  For example in Germany where worker rights are much better than here:   In a 2012 interview with Agence France Press, von der Leyen estimated that worker stress costs German businesses 8 to 10 billion euros ($10.5 to 13.1 billion) in annual output due to workers taking time off or retiring early because they're so run down.   http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/30/worker-burnout-worldwide-governments_n_3678460.html  The employers will ask employees to cut down on vacation in a while. Why not? You can lure them with higher wages or promotions.  Me must see the long-term problem for all of society and not the short-term problems which employers (I would exclude really small businesses [1-5 people] here which may actually face problems) say they face (what they actually face is less profit but we can not sacrifice humanity for profit, we are humans and not robots)."

In particular, think about both seasonal employees as well as employees who have worked less than a year.  Section 4. Do you believe there will be any cost for hourly employees here? A consequence of this could be a perpetual cycle of seasonal workers. Employees hired for 5 1/2 months at a time, let go, reinterviewed, and rehired. Perhaps incentivizing both the hiring and the retention of employees should be encouraged.  Section 5. What was the inspiration to tying tax credits to yearly revenue? It would make a bit more sense to tie these credits to payroll. It would directly incentivize hiring and retaining employees. Those tax credits will impact more than half of all employer firms in the US. The impact on the nation's debts will not be negligible.

If a employee works 8 hours a day, 6 days a week, that is 48 hours per week 48 hours a week times 45 weeks is 1680 hours a year 2.5% of 1680 hours is only 42 hours.   The salary workers receive a minimum of 7 days. The wage worker receives less than a weeks work of pay. I support bumping this up to 3.5%, making the minimum amount of vacation hours 50.4, which is equivalent to 7.35 days of labor. This ensures an equal amount of vacation days for wage workers and salary workers."

While I'd like to see each state pass legislation analogous to this rather than having a federal law, I think this federal law would be completely constitutional.  Under the majority opinion in United States v. Lopez (1995),  there are three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power:   The channels of interstate commerce The instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce Activities that substantially affect or substantially relate to interstate commerce   Since workers are persons in interstate commerce and since the absence of workers substantially relates to and effects interstate commerce, I would say that current case law would hold this act as constitutional."

Admittedly, some of our prior cases have taken long steps down that road, giving great deference to congressional action. The broad language in these opinions has suggested the possibility of additional expansion, but we decline here to proceed any further. To do so would require us to conclude that the Constitution's enumeration of powers does not presuppose something not enumerated, and that there never will be a distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local.

ModelUSGov,3c1dtc,ExpiredAlphabits,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:19:05 2015 UTC,"The problem really isn't the cross breeding. What happens is that if one area of land is planted with these seeds, and through natural process they create seeds of their own. Once those seeds blow in the wind, get brought around by animals etc., wherever they land and start growing the owner of that land is breaking the law. By shortening the patents to ten years you give companies who create these seeds plenty of time to profit from it, and then after ten years those seeds are able to be traded just like how they have been traded for thoousands of years."
ModelUSGov,3c1dtc,AGreyShirt,2,Sat Jul 4 02:51:38 2015 UTC,"They are not breaking the law. I dislike that this myth is so prevalent. Any unintentional cross-pollination is covered under, by most courts, fair-use.

Still, the idea of this bill is to protect farmers when they accidentally grow patented crops through natural processes. I'm all for that. The problem is that in protecting those farmers, you'd also be dealing a major blow to the good people who designed those plants. In our system of capitalism, the good people who did that work deserve the profits of that work. Reducing the patent length deprives them of those profits. If they don't receive those, then they have less incentive to do more work in the future. Those beneficial crops aren't grown, and everyone loses out in the long run. This is exactly what Libertarians talk about when we say that the government shouldn't intervene. Intervention is a delicate touch, and where the situation requires a needle, you've opted for an axe.

There will always be colleges that research genetically modified seeds, and the big businesses that do it now will continue to do research.

ModelUSGov,3c1dtc,ExpiredAlphabits,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:46:44 2015 UTC,"We wouldn't be slashing all chances of profits. This gives these companies ten years to profit on their designs.

ModelUSGov,3c1dtc,ExpiredAlphabits,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:26:12 2015 UTC,"There is more to the bill than protecting farmers from lawsuits. As I stated previously, the bill would also protect the trade of seeds which has been going on for centuries.

Proof will have to be provided for such a statement. The court cases that farmers were sued in intentionally selectively breed their crop to have the patented genes.

ModelUSGov,3c1dtc,Zombones,0,Sat Jul 4 12:11:28 2015 UTC,"""Getting rid of these patents allow more research to be done""  No it does not. Explain why that would be the case?  ""If we dont diversify the GMO crop soon we WILL have a mystery disease wipe out the crop one day""  GMO crop is not a new trend. Diversification problems is not a new trend with GMO's. Lack of diversification has been going on since the green revolution, and in that time, no ""mysterious disease"" has appeared. GMO's do not increase this lack of diversification any more than the green resolution already has, and we see the effects of the green revolution. More crop, people get put out of hunger, farming economy's can exist in today's global economy, ect ...  Seed Farms exist, that seems to be an aceptable solution for seed diversification. Additionally, GMO companies have undergone regulation specifically related to diversification already, and they typically produce more than one crop.   What you do not take into account is that food production today is NOT diverse, very few types of maize, for example, are used. GMO's do not accelerate this trend or slow it down. I don't see why having GMO companies produce multiple crops or encourage funding for seed banks does not work. Eliminating patents or reducing them is a bad solution."

What I am saying is that there is not reason to target specifically GMO crop when lack of diversification is a pre-existing problem. And as I said, seed banks exist. GMO companies produce more than one crop, as well as a variety of insect-resistant and pest resistant crop.   And, based on that, it is far more likely today that some mysterious disease will wipe out crops than it is with GMO's ... and diversification does not change. Yes, it is a problem. If GMO's disappeared from existence it would be just as much of a problem. So why are you targeting GMO's specifically?"

I'm aware. We shouldn't have tried imposing our own government upon the countries of Iraq and Afghanistan. Though their governments were rather repressive, especially so when it came to the Taliban occupied regions of Afghanistan, it is ultimately up to the people living in those regions to fight, both metaphorically and literally, for the government form they'd prefer to have, if they're dissatisfied with the current one.

Encouraging nationalism only encourages divisiveness and building walls around communities rather than embracing our differences and working together. Nationalism is one step away from separatism, racism, and apartheid.   I was wondering when racism was going to get thrown in there. Regardless, there are two varieties of nationalism: civic nationalism, the kind that originated in France, and ethnic nationalism, the kind that originated in Germany. I, personally, am in favor of civic nationalism. Civic nationalism entails service to one's nation, regardless of ethnicity or cultural practices. This form of nationalism does not increase divisiveness, as it's inherently inclusionary. You don't have to be a specific color or race to participate. And America most certainly does have cultural heritages that unite the population. Independence day, memorial day, and thanksgiving are examples of shared traditions across color and ethnicity. As well, you should look into the concepts of Civic/Political religion. It is readily apparent that America is united under those ideas, considering how often the Constitution, the Founding Fathers, and other documents of our heritage are brought up, and the reverence that is held to such items.   And believing that you're superior thanks to the choices made by others is an extremely lazy way to look at life. The success others have had may have given you the chance to succeed, but until you do it for yourself, you're taking credit for others' work.   This is a complete and total misrepresentation of what's being said. I do not believe America to be superior to other nations simply because it's America, nor do I believe myself to be superior because I'm American. When talking about accomplishments, I'm talking about the actions that the United States has performed as a nation, not the accomplishments of individuals in it. Being a nationalist entails celebrating the good deeds that your nation has performed. This isn't to say that one should ignore the faults or wrongdoings of his/her nation. A nationalist is someone who looks at these wrongdoings, recognizes them for what they are, and works towards preventing such a thing from happening in the future."

Also, I am a devotee of Christopher Hitchens, and therefore an anti-Theist.  What should be highlighted is that we value economic reform, first and foremost, to increase the productivity of the citizenry via improvement of living conditions and access to health & education. We, the party, believe that the Corporatist model of economics, coupled with Economic Nationalism and Meritocracy, is the gateway towards these improvements.  America is a multi-ethnic nation, and we value every citizen, much like an HR manager would value each employee, except we cannot fire anyone, but improve them if they have an ailment or aren't pulling their expected weight by catering to their needs (whether it's treatment of mental or physical health, or environmental assistance, etc.)  I hope this clears everything up."

ModelUSGov,3bxzjj,oughton42,5,Fri Jul 3 21:47:52 2015 UTC,"My view is going to be unpopular here, so I'd best lay out the ground on which I stand; I am a Distributist, a member of the party. I believe in small businesses, cooperatives and guild systems, I believe that everyone should have 'Three Acres & a Cow', or enough of their own land to live on. I believe in federalism and devolution, but I also believe in a strong and capable state. I firmly believe that everyone should have the right to say whatever they please.  This being said, what with rejecting both capitalism and socialism, I have explored the third position in depth. Distributism is just another part of the third position, the handful of ideologies that reject the existing dichotomy, that also includes Fascism. Having done my research (whereas I doubt many anti-fascists here have aside from reading a wikipedia article or two), let me correct a few things here.  Orthodox Fascism, the kind proposed by Benito Mussolini and Giovanni Gentile, holds no place for racism. A quote from Mussolini from 1933 goes like this: ""Race! It is a feeling, not a reality: ninety-five percent, at least, is a feeling. Nothing will ever make me believe that biologically pure races can be shown to exist today. ... National pride has no need of the delirium of race."" The Falange, which is still in existence despite its origins before the Spanish Civil War, were also anti-racist, because of the multicultural and multi-ethnic nature of the Iberian Peninsula. Furthermore, the British Union of Fascists was also not a racist party, as Mosley recognised the need to hold the disparate cultures of the British Empire together.  Furthermore, on the subject of misogyny, while many parties of the time (not just third position parties) were telling women to stay in the home instead of working, the British Union of Fascists was the first party in British history to make equal pay for men and women a policy pledge. The Falange still releases posters rejecting homophobia and the objectification of women, and rejects the larger Neo-Nazi movements of the rest of Europe on the grounds of being uncultured and unnecessarily violent (source here ).  Of course, several Fascist parties were anti-semitic in spite of this otherwise anti-racial tone. However, so was the rest of western society at this point (it was not until 1945 that the west realised the error of their ways having seen the aftermath of Nazi Germany's 'final solution'), so I don't think that any more mud can be laid at the feet of Fascism for being a part of a social norm.  I can't defend the use of the Silver Legion name, and I won't defend National Socialism or racialist policy (but here's a thing racialist policy =/= racist policy. Look it up) because I disagree fundamentally with both of them. However, the majority of these people are Fascists, and I see nothing wrong with them holding their views. Fascism is internally democratic and meritocratic, it is not at all racist in its orthodox form, and at least it engenders a community spirit. I see more merit to Fascism, Corporatism and that ilk than I have ever seen in the ideologies of Socialism, Communism and Anarchism, which all seem to peddle the notion of a utopia that I only see in the Morean sense of the word 'utopia's' literal translation being 'no-where place', never existing and never to be in existence."

Each and every human being is completely different from one another. We all have different qualities that obviously set us apart from one another. I can go on and on for a list of qualities that each person has. My point being is that you cannot force person A who is has a different set of needs, desires, personality, etc. to be equal from person B who also has a different set of needs, desires, personality, etc. It makes perfect sense on paper, but it is not practical in any sense. Furthermore, the whole concept of the individual fits as a gear within the larger structure of hierarchy which contains other gears which makes a culture/society function.

It seems to me as if you're coming from a position where Culture is the natural order of things in the sense that it has always existed; that it almost comes from a child rather than being prescribed onto them and then reinforced by their experiences.  Also, when you say that culture is not only based on material conditions, but also on the pre-existing traditions of a society, you must continue that logic down the chain -- where did those pre-existing traditions come from? This is what I mean by the constant change in culture, the dialectical process -- it's never constant, as material conditions and social relations change, so too does culture.   But there isn't necessarily anything wrong with the notion of thinking of lesser states or thinking down on other countries. What can they do to prove you wrong? Beat you in a war? From there, it is merely hypothetical's so I won't bother.   The trouble with this mindset as I see it is the general subjectivity of the notion of superiority. If you're process to determine the superiority of your nation is to insist the other nation prove you wrong, that is an unscientific analysis; it is the duty of the one making the claim to determine proof, the nation must prove their own superiority. Furthermore, the winner of a war (if that is the experiment a nation chooses to test their claim) is not necessarily the superior culture, they just have a better military. Since there is no way to prove the objective superiority of any Nation, we must question whether the notion of National superiority is at all valid.

In my reading, I've perceive most cultural changes as results in third party forces. Sometimes practical, most of the times, impractical or even unnatural.   Firstly I would disagree with your notion that culture is self-sustaining, and that change is only the result of outside interference. While there certainly exist conflict outside of the Nation, there are also significant conflicts and contradictions within the Nation that drive cultural change. The people comprising a Nation of reasonable size do not always agree with each other, and when that internal conflict grows and is eventually resolved, the culture we have at the end is different from the one we had at the beginning. I would challenge you to find a Nation that has remained constant even without outside  interference. During the long Japanese isolation, for instance, culture changed from within -- not as much as it would have had there been outside influences also creating conflict, but it changed nonetheless. Even with completely closed borders we see that culture is not self-sustaining, nor some ideal resistant to change."

ModelUSGov,3bx25j,qrhoo,2,Fri Jul 3 16:36:43 2015 UTC,With all due respect. YOU ARE SO WRONG on this. This picture (NSFW) disagrees with you.: http://www.israpundit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/ravished_armenia.jpg Armenian women were raped and crucified because they were Christians  You have no clue what you are talking about Christians were not tolerated in the Ottoman empire towards the 1910s and the end of that empire.
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,tweakdeveloper,2,Fri Jul 3 05:27:49 2015 UTC,"I wasn't aware that other Christian groups weren't tolerated during this time.  I thought that because tolerance was extended under the Dhimmi and Millet systems, it carried over into the twentieth century.  I'm sorry that I was using incorrect information."
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,qrhoo,2,Fri Jul 3 16:25:54 2015 UTC,One reason why we need to recognize it is this. our people don't know because we ignore it.
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,ExpensiveFoodstuffs,5,Fri Jul 3 18:22:36 2015 UTC,"I have conflicting feelings about this bill. This is odd, but I'm going to argue with myself here:  One one hand it should be noted that the current Turkish President has apologized for the ""inhumane"" treatment of the Armenians, but has stopped short of calling it a ""genocide."" Turkish leaders have become increasingly sympathetic to the calls for justice from the international community. I truly believe that Turkey will one day acknowledge that the events of 1915 was a genocide. I worry that this bill will negatively effect our relationship with Turkey and Israel (who had also refused to use  the 'g-word'.)  HOWEVER it has been 100 years since the genocide, so if Turkey isn't willing to call it a genocide yet when will they? Should we not call a spade a spade? Perhaps this is what the international community (mostly those who don't call it a genocide) needs to get the ball rolling.   At its core this is an issue of justice vs convenience. It would be far more convenient to reject this bill and let it die. However the right thing to do is to acknowledge that the ""Events of 1915"" were in fact a genocide, and we, as a nation, should be willing to pay the price for telling the truth."
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,locosherman1,3,Thu Jul 2 22:49:54 2015 UTC,I worry that this bill will negatively effect our relationship with Turkey and Israel (who had also refused to use the 'g-word'.)   The majority of Israeli's do recognize the Armenian Genocide but for diplomatic reasons (alliance with Turkey) they won't recognize it.

ModelUSGov,3bx25j,ExpiredAlphabits,2,Fri Jul 3 05:45:41 2015 UTC,"I think the message that Turkey would receive isn't the message that you're trying to get across. The genocide is an embarrassment for Turkey. Instead of trying to heal, learn from it, and not make the mistake again, this statement just points fingers and places blame. If Turkey and America were people, this would just lead to a shouting match and the two leaving the room angry, never to speak again. Instead, this should be written with a tone much more hopeful for better future, one where America, Turkey, and Armenians can live in peace and harmony. The focus should rely more heavily on fixing grievances, not causing more. I ask that you change the wording to reflect a more positive and helpful attitude."
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,qrhoo,2,Fri Jul 3 06:07:34 2015 UTC,Please hear me out: I'm not sending a message to Turkey alone. I'm telling the world that we don't accept anyone commiting genocide. We need to be the change we want to happen. Turkey and Saudi Arabian and other nations will not start treating their people as people if we don't start making it clear. 12 NATO allies recognize it and give speeches every year without being afraid of Erdogans reaction. Turkish nationals and press are imprisoned if they dare mention it in public.  Thank You!

The actual effects of issuing such a statement, especially considering the wording of this bill is incredibly antagonistic towards the Turkish government, are inevitably going to be negative. What occurred was a deplorable act on part of the Ottoman Empire/Turkey, but this bill will only cause a rift between Turkey and the United States.

The same could be said about the Holocaust. Either they knew it happened, or they didn't know about it, so why talking about such thing?  America recognizing an event as a genocide would mean a lot to families of those who died in 1915, and to Armenians all around the world.

ModelUSGov,3bx25j,qrhoo,6,Fri Jul 3 06:02:15 2015 UTC,"I cannot support this as from a practicality standpoint, a strong relationship with Turkey is worth more to the American public than a political statement. Our relationship with Turkey, the largest Islamic liberal democracy, is already being agitated and there is no need to further the agitation. As much as I want to support this, I cannot."
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,locosherman1,5,Thu Jul 2 23:33:38 2015 UTC,"This is a great move the U.S. should make. We have an obligation to recognize the terrors committed by the Ottoman Empire, that Turkey seems content to ignore and repress. What principles can we claim to have if we aren't willing to recognize a genocide for the sake of simpler diplomatic ties?"
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,qrhoo,4,Thu Jul 2 22:02:27 2015 UTC,This is the only common sense answer and it baffles me that many people in our congress refuse it.  Millions of Americans march every year and some congressmen refuse to hear them. Thank you so very much fellow representative and I hope to see your Yea in the vote in two days.
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,mewtwo245,4,Fri Jul 3 06:35:03 2015 UTC,As an Armenian American I'm very happy to see this bill. I hope that we all do what's right and speak out against Genocide because those who forgot history are condemned to repeat it.  I also think that this bill should also recognize the Genocide of the Ottoman Greeks and Assyrians.
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,qrhoo,5,Thu Jul 2 22:40:37 2015 UTC,It does. I'm from Assyrian parents who came here for religious freedom and economic opportunity.  Please contact each of your party's representatives in the house to vote for it.
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,69ingPutins,2,Fri Jul 3 06:03:19 2015 UTC,Will make sure to! I'm very happy to see this bill being introduced. All my great grandparents were survivors of the Genocide some of them being the only survivors in their families. I really hope this passes.

Just one thing, as u/IGotzDaMastaPlan already said, in Section 1 the word ""Million"" is lost. You got that right in the Preamble:   more than 1.5 Million Armenians   but you lost it somehow   which resulted in 1.5 Armenian men, women, and children"
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,qrhoo,2,Thu Jul 2 23:59:32 2015 UTC,THANK YOU
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,Epic_Mile,2,Fri Jul 3 05:30:24 2015 UTC,we would be angering  Turkey with this bill. We shouldn't anger our strongest islamic ally. The soviets did the exact same thing years ago anyway.
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,Epic_Mile,2,Fri Jul 3 00:43:22 2015 UTC,"This is wrong on so many levels. I don't care if Canada did it, we must recognize it. 12 NATO allies also recognize it. Our people march in millions in the streets from NYC to LA. Who do you want to listen to? Your people and 12 (Germany, Turkey, and France included) allies? or Turkey?"
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,qrhoo,2,Fri Jul 3 06:30:10 2015 UTC,"As a republican I fully support this bill and believe it should go in effect immediately. There is no downside to this bill as these poor Armenians were driven a from what they called their homes, raped, and killed. We should all support this bill, even though it has nothing to do with the United States of America"

ModelUSGov,3bx25j,OldTimeyPugilist,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:25:29 2015 UTC,I have a problem with this bill because we would be calling out a longtime ally of ours that have helped us tremendously in our Middle-Eastern conflicts I think it would be a very dangerous move to pass this bill.
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,locosherman1,2,Fri Jul 3 01:52:07 2015 UTC,"that have helped us tremendously in our Middle-Eastern conflicts   also have been helping ISIS. I don'y care what they think, it won't change anything they're already doing, and if their government itself dares to publicly aid a terrorist group in response to us recognizing it then Turkey will have bigger problems on their hands than us recognizing a century old genocide"
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,NicholasNCS2,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:08:05 2015 UTC,So your answer is to recognize it and when there is backlash walk around with a big stick I remind you Turkey has bases with U.S Nuclear War-Heads in them these provide tremendous strategic capability to us.
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,locosherman1,2,Fri Jul 3 14:44:03 2015 UTC,"Do you honestly feel that if this bill passes, a country which has been aiding ISIS will feel so slighted that our simple acknowledgment of past atrocities will be the last straw and somehow negatively affect any U.S. bases?"
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,SomeOfTheTimes,2,Fri Jul 3 15:42:07 2015 UTC,I most certainly do like many before me have mentioned blaming Turkey for The Ottoman Empires atrocities is like blaming Germany for Nazi Germany
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,BigCommieNat,2,Fri Jul 3 16:35:09 2015 UTC,Germany takes responsibility for the actions of Nazi Germany just as Turkey should for its predecessor government.
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,zxz242,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:08:53 2015 UTC,I completely and utterly disagree with that entire statement. Show me a document where Germany takes responsibility? Turkey is hardly responsible the difference in the states is tremendous one a democracy the other a monarchy one an imperialist this bill would do nothing but hurt the relations with a long time partner and ally
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,HippeHoppe,3,Fri Jul 3 23:01:45 2015 UTC,"Strafgesetzbuch section 86a specifically goes into detail about denazification efforts after the fall of Hitler's Third Reich.  Several symbols, let alone dress, flags, etc. are illegal. Germany recognizes that Nazification severely damaged its country in a variety of ways.  Simply ignoring a part of history doesn't make it irrelevant. Compassion for our fellow human beings is what is right and I believe that's the basis for this bill."
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,locosherman1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:08:46 2015 UTC,Strafgesetzbuch section 86a is referring to Nazi symbols how does that    plenty of countries have done that as there a sign of hate that isnt taking ownership for it
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,HippeHoppe,3,Sat Jul 4 02:18:09 2015 UTC,Chancellor Angela Merkel didn't seem to have a problem doing so.   Holocaust reparations on behalf of Germany have been rather large in scale  These aren't the actions of a nation without a guilty conscience.
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,locosherman1,2,Sat Jul 4 02:42:44 2015 UTC,"Are you saying that Germany does not condemn the actions of Nazi Germany? They have taken full responsibility for it and it is shown in the way they educate their children about the crimes of their grandparents/great grandparents and any Nazi/Far right propaganda is forbidden.   Turkey in the same way should condemn the crimes of their grandparents/great grandparents just as Germany has and educate their children about it.  They are doing the exact opposite. They are jailing anyone that speaks of the Genocide or speaks against their government are jailed for ""insulting Turkishness."" Hell not long ago, it was illegal to speak Kurdish in Turkey.   This will not strain our relations with Turkey at all. Turkey will only make baseless threats. Twelve other NATO allies recognize the Armenian Genocide and have there ever been any lasting effects? No.  I am tired of seeing the Genocide Denial apologism in this thread. Genocide denial is the last stage of Genocide."
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,HippeHoppe,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:47:32 2015 UTC,"Just because you condemn something doesn't mean you are directly responsible the only one at fault for Germans atrocities is Hitler and the harsh reparations put on them after World War One. Also I would like to add most German schools barely touch on WW2. I just think we shouldn't be poking are heads into this after such a long time it happened yes and it was very sad, but with that being said I think it will do to much harm to the relationship with Turkey that is direly needed for future help not only in the Middle-East,but also keeping Russia at bay."
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,locosherman1,2,Sat Jul 4 03:06:21 2015 UTC,"Germany goes through the Holocaust extensively. They take schoolchildren to Concentration Camps on field trips.   Turkey is the successor government of the Ottoman Empire therefore they are responsible. No one wants to hold Turkey accountable to anything, just for them to call it what it was which was Genocide. The term Genocide was coined for the Armenian Genocide.  And as I said before, this will not strain our relationship with Turkey. Turkey will not just stop cooperating with the US just because they recognized the Armenian Genocide, Turkey is making baseless threats because they fear that if the US recognizes the Genocide then they would be pressured to recognize it themselves. Twelve other NATO allies have recognized the Armenian Genocide.   This will not hurt any of America's imperialistic goals in the Middle East."

ModelUSGov,3bx25j,AMatterofTrust,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:02:19 2015 UTC,"I support this bill.  Turkey, as a state, must pay Armenia reparations for the blood on its hands."
ModelUSGov,3bx25j,qrhoo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:16:52 2015 UTC,1) Recognition of the Armenian genocide will do nothing to ameliorate its consequences. There is no positive material consequence achieved by this legislation.  2) The legislation may adversely impact US relations with Turkey. This would hamper the US's ability to negotiate in good faith with the Republic of Turkey in a dangerous time when Turkish support for ISIS (and corresponding lack of support for Kurdish rebels) is a major crisis which the US should exercise its diplomatic influence to change.  I oppose this bill on purely consequentialist grounds.
ModelUSGov,3bx1oz,SeptimusSette,23,Thu Jul 2 21:21:21 2015 UTC,"I don't support communism, but this act just doesn't make sense. Outlawing an entire political party is ridiculous and goes against everything this country stands for."

That's Smitty only you have to multiply it by a million."

With out such a method, it becomes impossible to properly regulate such a carbon tax (what do you tax, how do you tell how much gas one uses? How much of material they burn? Does it apply as a sales tax? ect ... without such a mechanism, it will hand to much authority to agency's who will enforce such legislation.  While this bill does admirable goals, there are better ways to implement them. I urge the representatives, vote no on this resolution. Yes, you may want a carbon tax, admirable, and I support such an effort, but do not do it through a bill which will compromise our security through unclear enforcement mechanisms, by giving the agencies authority to decide if it is a sales tax, tax upon burning, how one can even tell any of this, (measuring energy bills of every person in the states?) and if it is put in place, how expensive would it be.   I would urge a no vote, a carbon tax bill can be passed instead that has a positive effect, not negative, on our nation."
ModelUSGov,3btvug,Logic_85,2,Thu Jul 2 03:14:08 2015 UTC,"As I noted on the original bill, the bill allows the government to tax exhaling by humans. The co2 tax is not a good solution, alone. Put it together with sloppy bill writing and you get something horrible."

ModelUSGov,3btvug,AMatterofTrust,2,Thu Jul 2 08:22:27 2015 UTC,"It does not specify selling, nor is the grouping ""objects emitting CO2 when burned"" a good grouping. I noted in the original bill that a wooden desk fits that category. Why not just say ""fossil fuel?"""

Additionally, the bill reads ""All energy forms that produce CO2 when burned will be taxed with US $11.50 per metric ton CO2 they produce when burning."" What does that mean? What is an energy form? The bill does not specify usage, at all. If the government wanted to define a wooden desk, as an ""energy form"" it can. I don't see how this bill takes into consideration that nearly everything on the planet has some carbon in it, making it an ""energy form.""  The bill is vague.

ModelUSGov,3btvug,dakpluto,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:56:57 2015 UTC,"I don't want to just spout out the ""free market will fix it"" argument   The free market will not fix it unless it is given an incentive. Carbon taxes and other taxes on pollution and resource exploitation are a large part of how you get the market incentivized. You have to include environmental degradation into the cost of doing business -- supply and demand alone will not suffice.  To argue this case, I would firstly like to dispel a common superstition by pointing out that the private sector is not perfectly efficient -- many large corporations like General Motors and Verizon are extremely wasteful. Indeed, as a general rule, the larger an entity is -- public or private -- the more inefficient it will be (this general rule falls apart when things are small, and you can learn more about this by looking up economies of scale, but within our economy of massive corporations, their size lends to their inefficiency in most instances).  Secondly, the private ""free"" market (I put free in quotes because any decent market that is not relying on reputation needs governmental enforcement of contracts) left to its own is virtually never the most efficient, even theoretically. This is for several reasons, but chief among them are public goods and externalities – or a cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit. There can be both positive and negative externalities relating to both the production and consumption of goods and services.  A good example of a negative production externality would be pollution from a factory – the factory owner is not considering the cost of that pollution when deciding to make a product, and yet it affects the rest of the population by increasing lung disease, lowering air quality, and contributing to global climate change. A good way to correct for such a negative production externality would be to implement a carbon tax so that the total societal cost of the pollution would be borne by the factory owner, so that he must consider it when making his product. Without the carbon tax, there will be dead-weight loss in the market, as the factory owner will overproduce his product.  A good example of a positive consumption externality is vaccines -- for if I am vaccinated against the flu, then I have reduced the chance of you getting the flu as you can no longer get it from me (or there is at least a reduced chance). Thus, vaccines should be encouraged through subsidies, and without those subsidies (or a similar mechanism) the market would not consider all of the societal benefits of vaccines, under-consume vaccines, and thus cause dead-weight loss in the market.  Now, I mentioned public goods earlier. Public goods are things like national defense, lighthouses, et cetera which are non-rival – meaning that if you consume the good, I can too – and non-excludable – meaning that if I am consuming the good, then I cannot stop you from also consuming the good. The private market also under-produces public goods, as people are inclined to free ride. For instance, if I asked you how much you would pay to help support an already existing defense system, you might very well say nothing or say half the amount you really mean. Thus, in the production and supplying of public goods, the government is more efficient than the private sector. Now, when the government attempts to supply private goods (I'm leaving club goods and common resources out for simplicity's sake) -- or ones that are rival and excludable -- it is always going to be less efficient. This is part of the reason why Rawlsian economics suck so badly.  There is also a distinction to be made, in terms of efficiency, between national public goods and local public goods. Local public goods will tend to be more efficient than national public goods because, according to Charles Tiebout, you can have shopping, competition, and entry and exit in the market for local public goods. For instance, if your city has a terrible police force and terrible schools, you can move to a neighboring city -- thus the city has incentive to provide good services. However, you are less inclined and less able to move from the United States to France if you do not like how federal programs are run.  Now, a carbon tax fights negative externalities in the market, making the market more efficient. Subsidies for renewable energy encourage positive externalities in the market, making it more efficient. Green systems of transportation are quasi-public goods, and their provision by local government will likely be efficient. If you at all care about the market solving global climate change (and not simply heavy-handed regulations), then you NEED to be on board with taxes on pollution and environmental degradation, with subsidies on green energy, and with green public goods. You cannot act as if the private sector is perfect – even in theory."

ModelUSGov,3bshm5,SeptimusSette,10,Wed Jul 1 20:01:11 2015 UTC,"A few issues here  First, the Constitutional one.  ""No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.""  (Article I Section 9).  I question whether this statute would meet the Constitutional requirement that the money be drawn in accordance with ""Appropriations.""  I am leaning towards the potential that it would meet that requirement, but others may disagree.  Second, a statutory issue.  The annual budget is made after the President submits a request for funding to Congress, and Congress approves the appropriations (Budget and Accounting Act).  If the previous year's budget is ""rolled forward,"" does that meet the statutory requirements of the passage of a budget that is submitted by the President and approved by Congress?  Third, a functional issue.  Say we have a budget that provides $10 million in subsidies to oil companies.  An environmental agenda takes a good chunk of the seats in Congress and pushes for an environmentally friendly budget.  Others in Congress can block the passage of ANY budget and effectively extend the prior years budget (along with its subsidies to oil companies) and effectively negate the entire budget process."

ModelUSGov,3bshm5,AMatterofTrust,6,Wed Jul 1 20:30:56 2015 UTC,"I see a few potential flaws associated with this. What about programs set to expire the next year? How are they accounted for?   Without a detailed way to manage these programs, a budget simply could not transition from one year to another (making a decent amount of sense). And if they are critical to the nations future, I do no want to leave those programs up to party politics, which does exist, but this bill introduces more.   In short, while the bulk of the budget can stay, there are some things that simply have to be changed year after year, otherwise the budget does not make any sense, i. e. funding programs that no longer exist, or not respecting changes in the environment of certain legislation.   One of the main problems I see with this legislation is that it requires a complete government takeover, control of house, senate, and president, to change a budget, to something more fitting for the environment. It removes incentive to compromise, dooming our nation to outdated legislation instead of positive compromise. Situation changes year after year. Using last years budget, without making necessary changes as every continuing resolution does, is terrible for our country.

ModelUSGov,3bpnkx,scotladd,3,Thu Jul 2 14:24:08 2015 UTC,"Well, first off, there is no Constitutional Right to be free from persecution and unfair treatment. Things in life happen that is unfair. The problem is ""fair"" is subjective. Someone with bad credit thinks it's unfair they can't buy a house but someone with a credit score 15 points higher can.  Children are persecuted at school by their peers all the time. Drivers on the road persecute each other on a daily basis. My ex-wife persecutes me.  There is no guarantee that things won't happen.  What this bill does is awards protections under the full weight of federal law to a ""class"" of people who we cannot definitively identify. Anyone can claim to belong to this class. If my job terminates me tomorrow, all I have to do is claim I have an internal gender identity issue, and that's why my boss fired me. And now my boss has a real problem on his hands. He could lose his job. The company is now vulnerable to a lawsuit and my boss may be liable as well. Yet no one can prove what I say is untrue.  As for the second paragraph, I do get irritated when the white knights rear their heads and start flinging around accusations like my concern for civil rights isn't evident because I don't agree with a dangerous bill.  Imagine someone suing for age discrimination, but never being asked how old they are. Or what of the current SCOTUS challenge to affirmative action. What if the plaintiff never had to actually prove she was white, as she claims?  This bill just creates a protected class out of thin air from a class which cannot currently be tested for, proven, or demonstrated. That's wickedly dangerous. How exactly is one supposed to officially identify? Are we going to create a list? that's even more dangerous.  This is a bad idea."
ModelUSGov,3bpnkx,coldcraft,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:36:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying people have a right to never have their feelings hurt. I'm saying that people who genuinely struggle with their gender identity deserve just as much protection against discrimination as someone who doesn't.   The problem I have with your argument is that you're assuming a scenario where your boss is required to prove a negative, which isn't how our court system works. If you can prove that's why you were fired, then you might have a case. But since you can't, you'll probably get a counter-suit and potential criminal repercussions. Hell, even people who can prove discrimination sometimes lose. Companies know that, and have lawyers on retainer for exactly that. Your whole assumption is that allegation = judgement, but that isn't the case."
ModelUSGov,3bpnkx,scotladd,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:48:57 2015 UTC,"Apparently you have never seen a suit like this first hand.  Typically, a claim backed up by a single witness is all it takes for a judgement. Especially in a sympathetic court."

If this bill is signed into law employers will always be looking over their shoulders for fear of frivolous lawsuits when making personnel decisions. Sure, big corporations may be able to stomach this but small businesses won't be able to simply absorb the inevitable increased legal costs associated with personnel moves.

But this doesn't prohibit use by States, so long as no claim of national sovereignty is made, and other countries aren't excluded from said celestial bodies, as indicated by Article I:   Outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, shall be free for exploration and use by all States without discrimination of any kind, on a basis of equality and in accordance with international law, and there shall be free access to all areas of celestial bodies.   Furthermore, on page 56 of the Outer Space Treaty, point 2 states:   States are free to determine all aspects of their participation in international cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space on an equitable and mutually acceptable basis. Contractual terms in such cooperative ventures should be fair and reasonable and they should be in full compliance with the legitimate rights and interests of the parties concerned as, for example, with intellectual property rights.   As it says, those involved with the treaty are free to determine all aspects of their participation in international exploration. Congress has determined that the best way to facilitate this international cooperation is to pursue commercial ventures involving the mining of asteroids. Point 4 of the Treaty in question backs this up even further when it says:   International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned, including, inter alia, governmental and non-governmental; commercial and non-commercial; global, multilateral, regional or bilateral; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development.   Our Congress has determined, rightly so, that the most effective option is to engage in commercial ventures. The materials and research obtained through this outer space mining will be disseminated through international trade, benefitting pretty much any country that requires metals. (i.e. pretty much every nation). I'm afraid that this bill would simply prevent the United States from taking advantage of the bountiful resources that our solar system is bound to offer through asteroids."

ModelUSGov,3bp0pc,ThatAssholeYahweh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:00:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the delay, I was away. Anyway, this is pretty much the text I submitted to our party sub when I proposed the bill:  So basically it is a bill that allows private corporations and businesses to extract natural resources from asteroids and other rocks up there. It ""discourages government barriers to the development of economically viable, safe, and stable industries for the exploration and utilization of asteroid resources in outer space"" and ""promote the right of United States commercial entities to explore and utilize resources from asteroids in outer space (...) free from harmful interference, and to transfer or sell such resources"" this applies even to ""a foreign entity that has voluntarily submitted to the subject matter and personal jurisdiction of the courts of the United States”.  It's also perhaps the first step towards ""planetary free trade"".  If the exploitation of these natural resources were found out to be necessary, it should be carried out by the government, not by private corporations.   Furthermore, the most vulnerable sections of the Outer Space Treaty (UN) are:   the exploration and use of outer space shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries and shall be the province of all mankind.   I would argue that exploitation of resources by a private company isn't for benefit nor in the interests of all countries   States shall be liable for damage caused by their space objects   So what if a private corporation causes damage to an asteroid? Who's responsible? Perhaps the state for letting the corporations exploit that asteroid? Or no one, so then corporations could literally blow space rocks up for their own amusement (and profit)?   States shall avoid harmful contamination of space and celestial bodies   I would consider that letting a corporation mine an asteroid is harmfully contaminating that celestial body, especially if it's a massive mining that's going on.  Our policy in outer space should be based on peaceful, international co-operation between governments and national/supra-national space agencies; not on letting transnationals and other corporations exploit asteroids for their own benefit."
ModelUSGov,3bp0pc,Brenin91,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:04:01 2015 UTC,Can the member respond to the previous posts about the law this bill intends to repeal? The other members and citizens have said that the particular law has not even been enacted by Congress.
ModelUSGov,3bp0pc,barackoliobama69,3,Thu Jul 2 12:43:31 2015 UTC,"The Asteroids repeal act does not violate this treaty. Other comments specifically point out why, in detail in relation to the legal aspect.   ... So, removing that argument, why exactly would you want to repeal it? What purpose is there to repealing it? If there exists rare earth deposits in asteroids, why would one limit space exploration to get it? And it is wayyyy to early to test the effects such legislation will have without space mining being a thing yet! Again, I am curious as to why one would want to repeal a bill withut first testing its effects, and as far as I can tell and as far as the history of economics is concerned, there are few, if any, because this as far as I can see will only encourage space exploration.   Also, note, without private exploration, there would be few incentive for private enterprise to consider advancing space technology. The green party, as well as republicans, want to do this, no? One cannot rely on NASA forever, or to the extent demanded of it, without private enterprise helping it. To say otherwise is to doom space enterprise as a whole.   Also, if rare earth minerals, in space, are useful, for smartphones, or devices, why on earth (see what I ... nevermind) would one limit the exploratio to gain there minerals. I am sorry if I do not see any negative in ""exploiting"" spaces natural resources. I urge the representatives and senators to vote no on this bill."

Morality and economics are not things to be separated. Moreover, whether or not to deport someone from the land they have come to know is first and foremost a moral question.   This is not to mention that the economic impact of undocumented immigrants has had several positives: the IRS estimates that more than 6 million undocumented immigrants pay federal income taxes, and the wealth of America is increased by about 1% because of undocumented immigrants. Granting legal status to undocumented immigrants also lowers their costs.  All of this, however, is a side track, as this bill solely focuses on people who were brought here as children illegally, want to stay in America and be productive citizens, and have proven that they can be by graduating college or serving in our armed forces."

I would subtract the refund from the taxes payed. The cost of the programs they used, since the report you stated said the majority of them lacked higher education, and worked more physical jobs I would assume at least some tried to get assistant.

ModelUSGov,3bnoxo,SoSelfish,5,Tue Jun 30 20:29:10 2015 UTC,"As it stands, the largest contingent of illegal immigrants in the United States are from Mexico. My opinion may vary from others in the Republican Party, but I believe it to be beneficial to the United States to grant temporary residential status to Mexican minors. Currently, the most common situation for illegal Mexican immigrants is that they seek opportunity in the United States because of the lack of opportunity in their home country. The majority of these immigrants (not limited to minors, mind you) return to Mexico after earning a fair bit of income in the United States. They may stay for 6 months or two years, but most plan to return to Mexico. With that being said, I believe that a stronger Mexico would be beneficial to the United States. The DREAM Act seems to be headed in the right direction, but I fundamentally disagree with granting these minors permanent residency. I believe it would be mutually beneficial for the United States and Mexico if young Mexicans had the opportunity to be educated in the United States, and then return to Mexico in hopes of creating meaningful change and reform within their country.  In its current state, I would vote nay on the DREAM Act, although I believe that other paths should be explored in order to improve the current relation between the United States, Mexican immigrants, and Mexico.  My other criticism of the DREAM Act is that much of the language is completely subjective and possibly unenforceable.  P.S. I'm new here, and I don't think that I have actually gotten ""accepted"" into the Republican Party yet, although I have requested to. Just thought I'd start out with this post because this subreddit seems great!"
ModelUSGov,3bnoxo,ExtremelySexyMan,6,Tue Jun 30 18:37:16 2015 UTC,"First of all, this grants permanent residency, not citizenship. There is still the naturalization process.   Second, all terms used are pretty tightly defined.  Third, as /u/MoralLesson stated, should we be sending immigrants back to countries they no longer identify with? Countries they may have left at such a young age, they may never have identified with?  Also, I'm confused as to your criticism. The DREAM Act doesn't force anyone to live in the United States that doesn't want to. Shouldn't there be an option for those who wish to become Americans, or should people return to place ""without opportunity"", as you put it?"
ModelUSGov,3bnoxo,qrhoo,2,Tue Jun 30 18:48:44 2015 UTC,"First of all, this grants permanent residency, not citizenship. There is still the naturalization process   That was a misread on my part, apologies.   Second, all terms used are pretty tightly defined   I stand corrected.  I believe you misunderstood my point. I think the intentions of the bill should be to help immigrants receive an education rather than granting them residency. I think the DREAM Act as it stands will encourage more illegal immigration. A bill that, instead of granting residency gave them an opportunity to receive an education is much less likely to cause an increase in illegal immigration. I do not believe that it should be the place of the United States to offer residency to these people, but granting them opportunities that put them on an equal playing field to their peers is a necessary step. By offering education to these immigrants, if they do wish to go through the naturalization process and become a citizen, they will be in a much better place to contribute to society than if they were simply granted residency."
ModelUSGov,3bnoxo,SoSelfish,3,Tue Jun 30 19:10:28 2015 UTC,I think granting them residency will ease their applications for schools and universities though.
ModelUSGov,3bnoxo,jb4427,2,Tue Jun 30 19:16:56 2015 UTC,"I do not believe that it should be the place of the United States to offer residency to these people   Honestly, I think this is the main crux of the issue. Whatever alternative you're offering is simply not going to satisfy, because many people (myself included) believe they should be able to become residents. And I think the requirements here are stringent enough (military service, college education, years working) such that we know the people we are offering residency are in a good place to contribute to society."

ModelUSGov,3bnoxo,scotladd,2,Tue Jun 30 19:59:48 2015 UTC,"(You double posted, but I'll just answer this one.)  This bill grants temporary residency upon passing high school (among other things), which obviously many qualify for without falsifying information. So, one would join the military or apply for student loans with their temporary residency status.  I think your question about vacating the country is having unrealistic expectations. After living in the United States five years, do you expect an eighteen year old to leave behind their family and network behind, leave their country behind, and just start over someplace their family didn't want them to be in the first place?"
ModelUSGov,3bnoxo,dakpluto,2,Tue Jun 30 20:47:01 2015 UTC,"If thats what the law says then, yes, thats the expectation. Otherwise one is violating the law because it is inconvenient to follow it."

ModelUSGov,3bnoxo,dakpluto,2,Wed Jul 1 18:00:33 2015 UTC,"As I said in a post in this thread this morning.  I don't expect them to vacate. But I do expect them to submit peacefully and immediately to immigration for registration and background checks. Upon successful completion of those checks they should be issued a court date, which they must show up for and request a stay of deportation pending DREAM application acceptance.  Those not willing to submit, or appear are most likely not someone we want in this country."
ModelUSGov,3bnoxo,scotladd,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:04:58 2015 UTC,"Those not willing to submit   There is so much in those 5 words that explains why there is so much fear from immigrants, especially young ones, to come forward."
ModelUSGov,3bnoxo,dakpluto,2,Wed Jul 1 18:08:58 2015 UTC,"See therein lies the problem. Like it or not, they are breaking the law. They are expected to submit to the will of the law. As you are, and as I am as well. If I have a warrant issued for my arrest, even if the warrant is unjust, the expectation is that I will submit to the will of the law. That's how order works, and that is what is expected of them if they want to be considered law abiding residents of this country.  I can rephrase it to ""If you are not willing to obey the law"" if that is more amicable."
ModelUSGov,3bnoxo,scotladd,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:19:07 2015 UTC,"The problem lies in that the ""crime"" was committed not by them, but by their family.  They were brought over at an age where they are not responsible for the action.  They have most likely lived their lives as any other citizen as this country.  Then to tell them ""I'm sorry, you need to submit yourself to the system for something that was done to you as a child""...there is an inherent issue in that.    Their presence may be a violation of the law, but it doesn't mean THEY broke the law. That's a little legal philosophy to ponder.  To say that on their 18th birthday they have gone from victim to criminal....I have a major issue with that.   And I am sure if suddenly discovering that you were illegal, you would also have a major issue with the sudden realization that you are technically a criminal and I highly doubt you would just stroll down to Immigration skipping along without a care."
ModelUSGov,3bnoxo,dakpluto,2,Wed Jul 1 18:35:07 2015 UTC,"Here is the rub:  Once they realize they are in the country illegally, they do not stop being illegally in the country. They do not go from unwilling participant (I wouldn't call them a victim anymore than I would call someone who accidently buys a winning lottery ticket but meant to purchase different numbers a victim) to citizen just because.  In the eyes of the law they are still prosecutable, and still breaking the law. The fact that they know they are here illegally but still refuse to submit...there is an inherent issue with that.  If my brother runs a red light and is caught by a traffic camera in my vehicle, am I allowed to skip the court date, once I receive a summons simply because my status as a criminal is unfair?  No. I am still required to appear for court and defend myself.  They should be as well. I have no problems staying their deportation and allowing them residence and not penalizing their path to citizenship. But asking them to appear and submit to a background check is only reasonable. Otherwise, we may very well award residency (and lets be honest, citizenship is what this bill is really meant to provide) to those who may be nefarious individuals.  Just because they were brought here illegally by their parents, as a child, does not mean they get a free pass. We need to verify they are who they say they are. If they are truly peaceful, law abiding hard-working or hard-studying citizens, there should be no reason to not walk into an office, get your fingerprints taken, sign up for your court date and go on about your business.  That is what I would be required to do, why are they not held to the same standard? My 16 year old son would also be held to that same standard. Why not these children?"
ModelUSGov,3bnoxo,scotladd,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:54:06 2015 UTC,"We are not talking about a $100 ticket though.  A better comparision, your brother runs the red light in your car, and you are presented with the option of run and try avoid prosecution, or go to court with the understanding that 95% of the people that go are put in jail for life for running that red light.    That's a more valid comparison to what these people face today.  That upon the knowledge that they are illegal (and understand not every illegal knows at 16 or 18 that they are illegal) they understand that if discovered or turn themselves in they become part of a system where virtually nobody ever actually gets the right to stay.  They could be thrown back to the country of their birth, and may not even speak the language of that country.     The other issue is one of distrust...passing the DREAM act will help these people begin to trust the system more and be more open to approaching the system about their status, but there will still be much fear.    I guess in all this back and forth the underlying question is this...if someone's only crime is not coming forward about their status, should that automatically exclude them from the some or all of the protections of the DREAM act?  That is the question I would like to address and answer."
ModelUSGov,3bnoxo,dakpluto,2,Wed Jul 1 19:10:48 2015 UTC,"I think you are misunderstanding me.  I have no problem allowing them residency, or protections. I am not saying deport them, in fact I have mentioned staying their deportation several times. I only ask that they submit to background checks and the legal system as any other resident or citizen of this country is asked to do.   Once their application is approved and such, dismiss all deportation proceedings, but you cannot give them a pass, ""just because"". Equality under the law is part of what makes this country work.  Show up, get fingerprinted, get your court date and go home. Show up for court (which is I think what we are really arguing about) and you are fine, and awarded residency.  Don't show for court? Issue a warrant and exit the country upon detainment. I see no problems with a compromise such as this."
ModelUSGov,3bnoxo,AMatterofTrust,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:17:05 2015 UTC,"I understand what you are for, I'm stating that this is not currently the law of the land, hence the massive distrust of the immigrants currently here, that will not disappear overnight because of this law passing.  So again, ultimately, if the only thing they are guilty of is not coming forward, especially in the early periods, should that automatically disqualify them from all protections if this law should pass?  It is an issue that I believe should be discussed and addressed before a vote on this bill happens.    Second is the issue of how do we establish that the person KNEW they were illegal? It obviously would not be fair to arrest and deport someone for not coming forward if they never knew (which many have not known because they were so young when they came over)"

ModelUSGov,3bnoxo,SoSelfish,2,Wed Jul 1 14:11:13 2015 UTC,"Unfourtanetly, I cannot approve of this Bill. My first problem is the first point of Section 3. This section looks to allow people who have arrived before the 18. However, what this have to do about minors? If a person arrived with their parents, at age 4, and have been in the country for say 6 years, they are only 10. The residency would only last until age 16, would they deported at age 16 as stated in Section 4?   Furthermore, what about the idea of parents? A child needs a legal guardian, and if those parents are over 18 then they might need to go through the (unclear and needing development) ""multi-stage process for attaining permanent residency"", which, if they don't have good moral character, might lead to deportation."
ModelUSGov,3bnoxo,ThatAssholeYahweh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:30:08 2015 UTC,This bill is only for those who have passed high school for the reason not to give their parents amnesty. The legal situation for parents of these children and for young children has not changed.

It gives us some organization while also enforcing a degree of accountability. However, I think this should be joined with a much more comprehensive bill that also outlines how we plan on protecting and administrating over the border. If the two are dealt with in together, I think they would complement each other and help American move on as a nation.  Second, I think this bill ignores the fact that minors are usually tied to their parents. If they get some kind of legal status despite being here illegally, then the parents must too, or will the state care for them? I don't think anyone would accept breaking up these families, but if this bill passes in it's current state, parents are not also guaranteed similar rights in order to remain with their child. If this bill is revised to include parents, then we reward adults for entering America illegally, using their children to stay."

Why are we not taxing environmental degradation and resource exploitation as a whole? There seems like there ought to be more incentives to plant and protect forests and water ways in this bill as well. This bill seems too narrow to me.    50% of the income generated will be used to improve the public transport system.   How? Will this include electric or hydrogen powered buses or taxis? More areas to walk and bike?   70% of the subsidy for public transport has to be used for green public transport systems.   What is ""green public transport""? Does this include bio-fuels?   25% of the income will be used to buy or fund companies that produce or research electric vehicles as well as to subsidize such products.   What about research into better battery or other energy storage? What about firms which are not companies that research electric cars? This seems to discriminate unfairly against cooperatives and LLPs.   25% of the income will be used to buy or fund companies that produce or research nuclear or renewable energy sources as well as to subsidize such products.   What is a ""renewable energy source""? Does this include deep-earth geothermal, which is not always renewable? Does it include biomass or hydroelectric dams?   Any energy forms that are burning fossile fuels and are subsidized will lose their subsidy.   This might hurt attempts to eliminate coal in favor of natural gas in the short-run, which would not be good.  All in all, the intentions are good, but it is poorly defined, not well fleshed-out, and far too narrow."

ModelUSGov,3bjx1s,jb4427,3,Tue Jun 30 01:31:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed the tax should be much higher in order to give enough of an incentive for people to reduce their  carbon emmissions. Also, would the funds be administered to federal programs only?   It would be good to encourage the states to enact their own reforms. Let's include a reward that would give states that meet a target reduction of carbon emissions get more funding from the tax to supply their green energy programs more, while adding additional penalties for states to meet the quota."

ModelUSGov,3bjx1s,MoralLesson,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:29:09 2015 UTC,That's too high. We can't just impose a tax that large on everyone.
ModelUSGov,3bjx1s,jb4427,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:38:54 2015 UTC,"Actually, Congress can impose that large of a tax. Moreover, when coal burning alone costs the United States $350-500 billion per year, I think it is safe to say that $75/ton is not too much."
ModelUSGov,3bjx1s,MoralLesson,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:46:08 2015 UTC,"No, they can't. Corporations would flee to Russia and China. The average American would be stuck with an additional tax burden of $1485. Maybe eventually the rate could climb, but that's a big tax to suddenly give people."
ModelUSGov,3bjx1s,jb4427,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:52:00 2015 UTC,"Corporations would flee to Russia and China.   And cease operating in the United States completely? I don't think so. Several other countries have instituted high carbon taxes and didn't suffer some great economic crush. China is in the process of introducing a carbon tax, and India already has one.   Maybe eventually the rate could climb, but that's a big tax to suddenly give people.   I'm fine with doing this gradually, but we need to realize that the end-game numbers are going to be around $75-100/ton or even higher. Since nations like France, Denmark, Ireland, and much of the rest of the EU have carbon taxes around $15-$25/ton, I'm fine with starting at $20/ton. However, and again, this will need to be raised within the decade -- and to $75-100/ton in no more than another decade or so."
ModelUSGov,3bjx1s,MoralLesson,2,Wed Jul 1 17:18:15 2015 UTC,"Plenty would leave. The US simply has a larger corporate constituency than other countries with carbon taxes, and it would affect the economy a lot more than the example I'd been using of Sweden.

ModelUSGov,3bjx1s,jb4427,2,Wed Jul 1 17:38:03 2015 UTC,"I would be fine with $20/ton. Maybe $15 for corporations. Then increase incrementally.

ModelUSGov,3bjx1s,MoralLesson,3,Wed Jul 1 17:47:08 2015 UTC,The amount should probably be dependent on the source.  $11.50 may be a good tax for individual consumers but industry/business sectors should have a much higher cost.
ModelUSGov,3bjx1s,fuelgun,0,Tue Jun 30 05:13:16 2015 UTC,"I think exactly the opposite. The tax should be higher on individuals (many of whom use a car as a luxury) than corporations (who may need to emit some carbon to run their business). The Swedish system has businesses paying 50% of the individual tax on carbon emissions, and that may be why the tax has not had any economic repercussions."
ModelUSGov,3bjx1s,jb4427,5,Tue Jun 30 11:13:49 2015 UTC,"I feel like ""all energy forms"" needs to specified a bit.  Are we taxing the sale of all products that emit CO2?

And in terms of what I'm doing,  aside from being a political activist, I get all of my energy from solar, and I'm not rich we have a sort of lease deal where we only pay $60 a month, while we also get about $10 at least last month from selling energy to the electric company. I dont have zero impact because I need to also balance it with being realistic about ways I can cut down, but if you do adhomin attacks on people you should at least know if your right."
ModelUSGov,3bjx1s,TheGreatWolfy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:46:26 2015 UTC,"Firstly I'm not using ad hominem. I never made an attack on your person or character in an attempt to discredit your argument. If you're going to call me out on using a fallacy at least make sure I am actually committing a fallacy and that you know what the fallacy is. Second I only used aggravated language to make a point, your posts do come off as kind of sensationalist so I went even more sensationalist to show you it's kind of unrealistic. You also helped make my point a bit... You said yourself that you are solar because of a sort of deal you have, which leads me to believe that without that deal you wouldn't have solar. You know why? Because it's pretty goddamn expensive. I looked at plans last year for solar with the whole craze of solar roadways to calculate costs, the ones that I looked at had plans for 20-30 year payback plans, where a solar power in x amount of years will pay for itself. Now I'm sorry, but you may know that you want to live in your house for the next 30 years but I'm 20 and haven't finished college yet, I don't even know where I'm going to get a stable job or a girlfriend, let alone a home for almost half my life. So for a good chunk of the population green alternatives are just not viable because they're too damn expensive or require a level of commitment most aren't willing to make. You know what would change that? Free market. You build a fluorescent bulb and it costs $5 per bulb current incandescent bulbs go for $2.50... You sell it and make a decent amount of money off of it, you're not touch but you at least broke even, price of your bulb is a bit too high for the common person, only those who are radical green party will probably buy them. Joe Schmo then creates a bulb that's more cost efficient, he sells it for $3.50. Still a little high but more people buy it because it's not as pricey as yours. Then you build one for $2.50, now it's split 50/50 between buying your bulb and the incandescent bulbs. Then Joe builds one for 99 cents. Suddenly the incandescent bulbs are too expensive and the people flock towards the more every efficient option. Government never had to get involved, never had to pass a law and people are suddenly going green by choice. That's how free market fixed this. Government has no business forcing us to buy energy efficient options by teaching the hell out of what they don't want us to buy.  I agree with you in part. We need to be more conscientious of the world, but you're going about it the wrong way. Forcing people into compliance will never get people on your side and see your perspective you have to make it so people want to agree with you, want to support you. Keys not get government involved, let them take a financial break, that need to cut spending anyway. Keys think about ways we can fix this ourselves so we can turn to v the government in the end and say ""we did this ourselves, we made this country better on our own."" It'll feel like a better achievement to do it of our own volition than having some feds step in and say you must do this."

It would be far more effective for it to be taxed on a sliding scale, where the greatest offenders pay the highest tax. If there were thresholds and deeper penalties for repeat offenders this bill would have much sharper teeth. As presently constituted it would be more of an annoyance than anything else. Furthermore, what relief is there for companies that have made an effort to reduce their CO2 production? If a company were to cut emissions by 5% in that first year, the net gain in tax would be effectively zero as the tax is due to increase by 5%.

We can't just through money at windmills and hope to save the environment that way. If so much money moving from one heavily guarded market to a younger one, we have to guard dispensing of those funds. Lastly, the idea of just funding more pubic transportation isn't detailed enough. Public transportation is usually handled by counties or cities, so to work so far down the ladder of government to develop a rather local arm of municipal services implies bulky and inefficient bureaucracy. There should be room for the states if this is to be pursued at all. In general, this may be too dramatic a solution to implement in a country that is still coming to grips with the realities of climate change."

Also, to quote Laudato Si', Paragraph 171:   The strategy of buying and selling “carbon credits” can lead to a new form of speculation which would not help reduce the emission of polluting gases worldwide.

By taxing not only GHG emission but sales of resources that can emit GHG when burned we make products like gasoline or oil worth less for the seller and in the end we will make those markets less lucrative then low-GHG emitting products.

However, I think this bill has some potential in it. I just have a couple of questions:   All energy forms that produce CO2 when burned will be taxed with US $11.50 per metric ton CO2 they produce when burning.   Why $11.50? Can we differentiate an individual and a company? If yes, shouldn't the companies that produce CO2 contribute more money to the tax?   50% of the income generated will be used to improve the public transport system.   So, is it distributed to each State in order to fund public transportation, or is public transport system going to a federal problem now?  If I understand correctly Public Transport System in Los Angeles is no concern of New York, and vice versa. I just wonder how it is going to be organized. I'd like to see some clarification in here.   70% of the subsidy for public transport has to be used for green public transport systems.   Where does the other 30% go?"
ModelUSGov,3bjx1s,thehillshaveaviators,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:11:52 2015 UTC,"How is the amount of metric tons per individual used is supposed to be measured? People drive cars, people use electricity, of all forms, people buy gas, people cook on barbecues. Are they taxed in the form of  sales tax, where people pay a tax on top of say, buying charcoal, but that introduces other problems such as things that would never be burned such as wood.   Applying a carbon tax on wood can be detrimental because people do not burn it, and taxing it will hurt the wood industry, hurting wood farms and hurting the global warming effort (people grow less trees, use other materials).   I do not think this is necessary or effective in fighting the global warming, from cars, because there are alternatives, (increase the gas tax, which this will basically function as anyway, with my idea of the only possible implementation I can see) or give credits to people who use electric cars.   Though economically they have the same effect, I would also propose a cap-and-trade program instead of a tax, especially a tax like this which gives bureaucratic organizations way too much authority in how it is enforced. Additionally, this cap and trade program will function on industry, because I see little effect in applying it to people, who often have no choice in using electricity, driving, ect... and thus is not elastic enough to generate the effects you are expecting.   Should this pass, it wound also be recommended that other restrictions in place currently, whom are ineffective (such as the regulations in place against the incandescent bulb), because they are wholly ineffective, this program substitutes for them, and doing so will benefit the average American person and American cooperations."

ModelUSGov,3bg41w,Eilanyan,4,Sun Jun 28 23:52:52 2015 UTC,I hope we can work together on economic issues and bring about equality and worker ownership to all people :)
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,MoralLesson,3,Sun Jun 28 23:57:35 2015 UTC,worker ownership to all people   I'd call it ownership by families more than ownership by workers.
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,Eilanyan,4,Mon Jun 29 00:16:12 2015 UTC,"Well you are talking to the ""Labor"" party"
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,MoralLesson,3,Mon Jun 29 00:21:13 2015 UTC,I'm just resisting the tendency to single the worker out from his or her family -- for the two cannot be separated in the economic realm so easily.
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,Eilanyan,6,Mon Jun 29 00:27:08 2015 UTC,Screw single workers?
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,coldcraft,5,Mon Jun 29 00:47:26 2015 UTC,I believe distributionists feel that families (defined by them as one man + one woman + kids) deserve more rights than individuals.
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,MoralLesson,5,Mon Jun 29 10:18:46 2015 UTC,"No, as even single people's economic state influence their parents, siblings, and other relatives. I think casting aside extended family in favor of only the nuclear family is a mistake. However, I mean, if the poor guy or gal is literally an orphan without friends who aged out of the system, then yes, just owned by him or her."
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,kingofquave,5,Mon Jun 29 01:08:15 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! I have some questions.  I know that distributism is sort of based on Catholic teaching, and although many of you aren't Catholic, I was wondering how conservative compared to the Church are you on social issues? Are you for same-sex marriage or nit? pro-choice or pro-life? and please tell me some stances on other social issues. I'm interested because I had never heard of distributism before this. To me, it's kind of the opposite of the Libertarians, maybe statist almost. I'm not sure though, so please explain."
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,MoralLesson,3,Mon Jun 29 01:24:42 2015 UTC,See here.
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,WellHeresMyFourthAcc,3,Mon Jun 29 02:05:27 2015 UTC,"I was wondering how conservative compared to the Church are you on social issues? Are you for same-sex marriage or nit? pro-choice or pro-life? and please tell me some stances on other social issues.   This is all addressed in the manifesto -- I even linked you to the section on society in this post -- linked in the opening post, so I'll refrain from delving into again.   I'm interested because I had never heard of distributism before this. To me, it's kind of the opposite of the Libertarians, maybe statist almost. I'm not sure though, so please explain.   It's a break from the rigid political spectrum and political compass most are familiar with, so it can be difficult to place and is why you're having such trouble placing it to begin with.  Economically, it believes that everyone should be a business owner. Rather than having the means of production accumulated in the hands of a few capitalists or in the hands of the government, everyone should own property, land, and a business (or be an owner-worker in a cooperative or employee-owned stock corporation). Private property is a good thing, but the economy should be at the service of humanity.  It acknowledges that the lowest level of government (or society) capable of solving an issue should be the one to do so. It believes the family is the foundation and basic unit of society -- rather than the individual (classical liberalism) or the state or other form of collectivism (many socialist and fascist ideologies).  I'd suggest starting with our manifesto and the Wikipedia article on Distributism. A decent Youtube series has also been forming on the topic. Good works on the subject include Rerum Novarum, Laborem Exercens, Quadragesimo anno, and Chesterton's Three Works on Distributism. There are several others.  Notable proponents include G.K. Chesterton, Hillarie Belloc, Dorthy Day, Pope Leo XIII, Pope Francis, Pope John Paul II, José María Arizmendiarrieta, and Vincent McNabb."
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,Toby_Zeiger,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:07:32 2015 UTC,"Ah. So private property is still owned by individuals rather than the collective. I was confused about your stance at first, since it sounded like the ""I want to distance myself from Stalin"" version of worker control of the means of production."
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,jogarz,3,Tue Jun 30 21:58:00 2015 UTC,Questions are welcome!
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,Toby_Zeiger,3,Sun Jun 28 22:40:01 2015 UTC,"Could you tell me what ""Just War Principles"" are?"
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,MoralLesson,3,Sun Jun 28 22:58:23 2015 UTC,"War is a last resort to be used when other, peaceful options have either failed or are clearly impractical.  The good that it is believed will be produced (or the evil that it is believed will be avoided) by victory must be greater than the evil that will presumably be caused by the war itself.  Finally, on the topic of victory, there must be some reasonable hope of it, no futile wars allowed.   Edit: I messed up number 2's wording and made it sound the opposite of what I meant. It's fixed now."
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,Eilanyan,2,Sun Jun 28 23:04:13 2015 UTC,"Ok, thanks"
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,MoralLesson,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:10:20 2015 UTC,It's actually detailed in our manifesto under foreign affairs.
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,Eilanyan,3,Sun Jun 28 23:07:27 2015 UTC,"/u/morallesson as well. Who do you feel is your closest ally, at least ideological in /r/ModelUSGov? Biggest opposition?"
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,MoralLesson,2,Mon Jun 29 03:28:32 2015 UTC,"We really have some common ground with every party. On social issues, we probably have the most ground to share with the Republican Party. On fiscal issues, we probably have the most in common with the Labor and Democratic parties. On security issues, the Libertarians seem to match up with us decently. We share the least with the Fascists."
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,Eilanyan,5,Mon Jun 29 04:41:00 2015 UTC,"totally not implying something about GLP through omission    :P  Every party is to some extent against the national security state, I don't see how Libertarians are special in that regard."
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,rangerheart0,2,Mon Jun 29 04:42:41 2015 UTC,"totally not implying something about GLP through omission   I mean, on the economics we're closer to the ALP and the Dems than the GLP. I know there are things like gun rights, reforming prisons and substance abuse laws, and electoral system changes we can agree on with the GLP, but there isn't a ton.   Every party is to some extent against the national security state, I don't see how Libertarians are special in that regard.   I suppose. It's hard to know when neither the GLP nor the Republicans publish a platform on here. It is funny that -- no matter where they are on the political spectrum -- every politically active person opposes the crazed security state that has been built; it should really say something."
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,HolaHelloSalutNiHao,4,Mon Jun 29 04:51:17 2015 UTC,"GLP had platform last election, I just can't find it. GOP is new GOP and need time."
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,Libertarian-Party,3,Mon Jun 29 04:56:57 2015 UTC,We are currently working on a new one.
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,MoralLesson,3,Tue Jun 30 12:52:49 2015 UTC,"I mean, on the economics we're closer to the ALP and the Dems than the GLP.   Hmm? We both want abolition of capitalism and see it as exploitative. It's just that Distributists see the family unit as the basis of the economy and society, while Socialists see workers and laborers as such (not the government, thank you very much).  Also, I'm probably going to sarcastically call you the Christian Democrats from now on, since that's a term I'm usually more familiar with than distributism."
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,ExpensiveFoodstuffs,3,Mon Jun 29 14:46:18 2015 UTC,"Our party's platform is being redrafted as there is constant waves of new members. Hopefully your questions can be answered soon.  My only question with your platform is the abolition of banks. Care to elaborate on this, and the reasoning behind it? thanks."
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,Eilanyan,2,Mon Jun 29 05:07:43 2015 UTC,"My only question with your platform is the abolition of banks. Care to elaborate on this, and the reasoning behind it? thanks.   Basically we want to replace them with credit unions for the reasons outlined in our manifesto."
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,MoralLesson,2,Mon Jun 29 05:15:49 2015 UTC,"There is a sense conveying its 'none of the above'. Distributism at its core is an overhaul of society and the economy. Sure we'll definitely find common ground with other parties, but we don't fit on the traditional political spectrum."
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,Eilanyan,2,Mon Jun 29 14:12:13 2015 UTC,"We are against Capitalism, Socialism/Communism, and Fascism/Nationalism, so we really have no allies.  However, we overlap, at least a little bit, with almost all the parties, so bi-partisanship should not be a problem."
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,MoralLesson,4,Tue Jun 30 05:19:18 2015 UTC,What is your stance on issues facing transgender individuals?
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,Eilanyan,9,Sun Jun 28 23:59:45 2015 UTC,"The party has no official stance at this time.  However, personally – and I only speak for myself here – I believe they need help, and that society is looking at this issue the wrong way. People suffering from believing they are born the wrong gender need some type of psychiatric assistance – it may not exist yet – I don't know – and if it doesn't then research should be developing such assistance. I know our understanding on how biological sex impacts neurological development is poor – and is one of the many areas where our nation, our states, our communities need to fund scientific research in.  However, it seems crazy to me that we should go along with the ideas in someone’s head who thinks they are something else. I mean, if I concluded I should be a lion, would society start recognizing me as a lion and help me to get surgery to become a lion, or would they conclude I have a mental illness – and mental illnesses need to lose their stigma and be treated socially like a broken arm or a bad case of influenza – and try to find a treatment for me? I imagine that people who wish they were the other sex are usually being attracted to an imagined idea of what being the other sex is rather than the actual reality of being the other sex. Indeed, no one can truly ""feel like an X trapped in a Y"" because they have never been an X to begin with. They must only be feeling like their imaginations of what it is like to be X pictures. Because of this, I generally think it is a bad idea for people to seek sex realignment surgery – though in instances of gender dysphoria it could be the best course, I really do not know.  That said, these people sincerely believe they were ""born into the wrong body"". We need to be sensitive to that and be loving and compassionate in our interactions with these people, and to get around the pronoun sticklers, we should just be calling the person by their preferred first name and not using any pronouns. They need strong friendships and strong communities to love them, help them, and be there for them – just like any other individual."
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,MoralLesson,4,Mon Jun 29 01:05:57 2015 UTC,"I can't really support increasing research when it's already clear, because the answer sounds crazy. Even Iran has got this issue mostly right."
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,Eilanyan,4,Mon Jun 29 01:08:53 2015 UTC,"I can't really support increasing research when it's already clear   When the American Physiological Association cannot even render a conclusive answer to its cause and has passed recent resolutions requesting more funding into its causes and treatments, I say we have more research to do."
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,Danotto94,7,Mon Jun 29 01:19:50 2015 UTC,The APA is a political organization that is kicking the can down the road. It was virulently anti-gay when that was popular and pro-gay when public opinion shifted.
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,MoralLesson,3,Mon Jun 29 01:23:37 2015 UTC,"Do you have an organization to recommend that is non-biased (e.g. not the Transgender Institute of America, if such a thing exists) and relies on actual peer reviewed research?"
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,Danotto94,7,Mon Jun 29 01:25:49 2015 UTC,"The research under APA is generally quite good, so really anything like a JSTOR. Is just the board members who decide the issues tend to be the old crowd, with different views and whose research was done earlier. Is similar with the list of ""disorders"", which is why things can be put on, put off or never touch the book."
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,MoralLesson,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:53:54 2015 UTC,Why can't we just let them be who they want to be?
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,ExpensiveFoodstuffs,2,Wed Jul 1 01:21:27 2015 UTC,"For the same reason we just do not abandon people suffering from suicidal thoughts to killing themselves, people suffering from anorexia nervosa to starving themselves, people in deep heroin addictions to their addiction, people suffering from schizophrenia to illusory worlds, or masochists to their self-mutilation and cutting.  Most mental health professionals recommend therapy for internal conflicts about gender identity or discomfort in an assigned gender role. Gender dysphoria is a recognized medical condition. That should tell us something. We should not start ignoring the consensus of the medical community because it deals with sex. People go crazy whenever sex is involved, and we need to quit it."

ModelUSGov,3bg41w,echisholm,3,Wed Jul 1 01:58:46 2015 UTC,We support all efforts to create a safe nation for transgender people. I'd support any efforts that attempt to curb homelessness and prevent employment discrimination against those of us who are transgender.  In accordance with solidarity they will receive equal treatment under the law; and shall in no way be excluded from the ownership of wealth production.

ModelUSGov,3bg41w,MoralLesson,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:55:01 2015 UTC,"Hi!  I had some economic and educational questions.  I noticed the idea of a large scaling taxation system based on current ownership and workforce size.  My question is:  How will the system react to certain forms of industry that demand high workforce and resource use, like say, defense work, or large industrial equipment manufacturing and distribution?  Certainly, burden of taxation (in my humble opinion) needs to be proportionate to earnings, but wouldn't creating such a steeply moving curve lead to large industrial collapse?  How would we, say, continue to operate shipyards, that require miles of land and hundreds upon hundreds of people?  A question also about education.  You propose something like the libertarian idea of school vouchers, funded by state and federal level.  Would that also be something akin to competing systems, or more used as a means of creating aggregate collectivist educational programs, based at the community level?  That is, would the parents just take the money and build something from scratch, so long as it conformed to state/federal guidelines, or would pre-existing institutions start to become a more competitive environment for voucher income?  Wouldn't that eventually lead to a schism of intelligentsia based around donations, and end up with a similar situation comparable to our current educational woes?  How would intensive and distributed services be handled, like interstate and international commerce, mail distribution, and defense?  Would those remain the jurisdiction of the Federal level, or be re-distributed to state and local jurisdiction?  What lines are drawn between actions that are best left to the lowest level of governance, and those that demand subsuming authority and being diverted to a higher authority?"
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,puregamer55,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:13:53 2015 UTC,"Firstly, read our platform. I can tell you didn't because you didn't question the apprenticeship system for education or our corrections ideas.

My question is: How will the system react to certain forms of industry that demand high workforce and resource use, like say, defense work, or large industrial equipment manufacturing and distribution?

They could do either.   Wouldn't that eventually lead to a schism of intelligentsia based around donations, and end up with a similar situation comparable to our current educational woes?   No, such a ""schism"" already exists as many areas have public, private, and parochial schools already. We'd simply be allowing poorer parents to also choose the private and parochial variety.   How would intensive and distributed services be handled, like interstate and international commerce, mail distribution, and defense?   Mail and defense would still be federal, as now. The defense budget needs to be decreased, however; and the Post Office needs several reforms (e.g. fewer delivery days).   What lines are drawn between actions that are best left to the lowest level of governance, and those that demand subsuming authority and being diverted to a higher authority?   If the lower authority can competently handle it, then it belongs to them. Read up on subsidiarity."

ModelUSGov,3bg41w,ben1204,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:12:16 2015 UTC,"The current union system comes from an us vs them mentality between workers and owners. How does your guild system remove that mentality and improve relations between the two groups?   In most instances, this happens by making the workers and the owners the same -- based on the idea that every/most family/worker should own their own business. These various businesses and professionals would act together for their own benefit -- sharing innovations, training new comers, and regulating their industry.  In the instances of small family businesses that have employees outside the family, it would be a gathering of the employers and employees across that sector to innovate together and share ideas, regulate the industry, recognize each other's contributions, and the like. The guild can set common standards for the treatment of workers -- improving their standards while ensuring helping workers does not diminish competition in other areas (for they could all be on voluntary, mutually-reached agreement as to the treatment of workers across a sector, decided upon by employers and employees together)."

Your party is at the ideological extreme of the left -- it is not as if you can examine platforms without significant bias.  Also, Karl Marx has negative credibility in my mind.

As I don't claim to approve of everything Marx says just because it is Marx (after all I don't follow anyone blindly) his work is scientific and especially in comparison to the basics of the church (Bible/Quran/and so on) worlds away.

Moreover, if you think science is the only means of coming to know things then you have fallen into the error of empiricism -- which relies on philosophy outside of the scientific method to prove that the scientific method is the only means of coming to know reality, meaning it is self-defeating.  Moreover, faith is not blindly accepting something in the absence of evidence. Doesn't it at all alarm you that until recently it was accepted by all Western thinkers -- including Locke, Newton, and countless others -- that the existence of God was certain and could be rationally proven? Have you read Aquinas's or Anselm's proofs for God and actually understood them in the context of Aristotelian metaphysics -- or do you just blindly follow secular philosophers who build up straw-men and knock them down?

Hawkins ends his conclusion with:   The conclusion of this lecture is that the universe has not existed forever. Rather, the universe, and time itself, had a beginning in the Big Bang, about 15 billion years ago.  Which leads to the failure of the Cosmological Argument because time began with the big bang.

ModelUSGov,3bg41w,pseudojewboy,2,Tue Jun 30 16:38:50 2015 UTC,I'd like to see this supposed scientific evidence for secularism   Please read again. In addition you can easily read up on the arguments for secularism (which need evidence and not secularism itself).
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,MoralLesson,3,Tue Jun 30 16:54:56 2015 UTC,"Secularism is an idea. It does not claim something. The arguments in favor of secularism may well be backed up by evidence.   Secularism is not an idea to be proved or disproved -- that is my point. What is an argument in favor of secularism?   Empiricism does not claim that is the only but rather the main way to obtain knowledge.   If that is the position you are taking, then you admit there are ways of obtaining knowledge besides the scientific method.   The conclusion of this lecture is that the universe has not existed forever. Rather, the universe, and time itself, had a beginning in the Big Bang, about 15 billion years ago.   We know. Father Georges Lemaître -- a Catholic priest -- developed the Big Bang Theory. It is not some affirmative argument (at least not one with any merit) for disproving God. Moreover, cause and procession can occur outside of time, so the lack of time means nothing to this. Hawkin's is attacking Paley's terrible Intelligent Design arguments; he is not even beginning to go after Aquinas here.   This is highly unlikely , see previous argument   I see you didn't understand it then. It is not even claiming that God must have created the universe. The overarching claim is that because something exists now, there must be a God -- because existence, here and now, is contingent thus something self-subsistent (the act of sheer being, possessing all the positive attributes) must exist. If you are curious about it, Aquinas devotes several hundred pages to why this must be the case in Summa Contra Gentiles.  You could visualize -- by very imperfect analogy -- that the universe (or even the multiverse if M-""Theory"" -- which cannot even be tested -- is correct) is like a song and God is the musician. If he were to stop playing -- even if the song itself is eternal, which it is not -- then the song would cease.  Aquinas, by reason alone, did not think you could prove that the universe was not eternal -- though he held that the universe was not eternal. Thus, the entire way you're attacking his argument is flawed. And I admit, Aquinas's arguments are not ones you can simply read on Wikipedia and understand. You need significant background into them. If you're truly interested, I'd recommend The Last Superstition or Aquinas by Edward Feser.   am very sorry but that is just not true. There are many ideas for that question, God is one of many.   Except God is the necessary answer. You see, if we appeal to anything other than God, such a thing cannot be necessary and and self-subsistent, and thus must have an actuality that caused its potentiality to actualize."

Not really, I only admit that there can be other ways. As far as we know there is basic Logic but I am sure that every preamble made to use such logic has to be founded in empirical evidence at some point.   Moreover, cause and procession can occur outside of time, so the lack of time means nothing to this.   It is actually pretty important. Because when we loose time as a dimension there can be cause and procession but it is not necessary.   because existence, here and now, is contingent    But here I disagreed with you, so for me (and many others) the argument fails at that point already.   though he held that the universe was not eternal.   Again, it is not necessary for it to be eternal. And if God is eternal, why couldn't the multiverse (should it exist) be?"
ModelUSGov,3bg41w,MoralLesson,2,Wed Jul 1 05:29:15 2015 UTC,"Okay than we even agree on something (well hopefully more but this is something) :)   I really don't think we do. You have to accept secularism blindingly, which you do, without any reason to accept it. I mean, there is no positive way to argue that we should accept secularism -- not a single direct argument.   Not really, I only admit that there can be other ways. As far as we know there is basic Logic but I am sure that every preamble made to use such logic has to be founded in empirical evidence at some point.   You've just fallen right back into the error of empiricism. You cannot prove any mathematical theorems by the senses, for instance. That alone should help you to realize it is wrong.   It is actually pretty important. Because when we loose time as a dimension there can be cause and procession but it is not necessary.   How is it not necessary (not that this is even needed for the argument for an Unmoved Mover at all)? Aquinas's premise is that because something -- anything at all changes (or moves) -- there must be an Unchanged Changer (or, in more precise philosophy, an Unmoved Mover -- as the definition of motion has narrowed over time). His starting premise is not that ""everything that exists has an explanation of its existence.""   But here I disagreed with you, so for me (and many others) the argument fails at that point already.   You see, you need to really read it in context -- as I've said before, because you're dismissing it on grounds that make no sense when you actually understand it. It makes a lot more sense when you know what potentiality and actuality are, when you realize essentially ordered chains of potentiality cannot infinitely regress (and don't confuse them with accidental chains of motions, which theoretically could), and thus realize there must be something that is fully actualized without any potentiality -- namely, God. Moreover, that being fully actualized, without any potentiality, must mean that God possesses all of the positive attributes in their fullest (e.g. omnibenevolence, omniscience, et cetera) and is not just another being -- even a supreme being -- but the sheer act of being itself.   Again, it is not necessary for it to be eternal.   I never said the universe is eternal. I said it doesn't matter if it is or is not -- if the theory of multiple Big Bangs and Big Crunches is true or not, the arguement still stands.   And if God is eternal, why couldn't the multiverse (should it exist) be?   The multiverse could exist -- I merely stated the fact that there is no way of us knowing if the multiverse exists because we cannot test M-Theory.  Notice I said:   that the universe (or even the multiverse if M-""Theory"" -- which cannot even be tested -- is correct)   Anyways, I'm done arguing with incorrect notions of Aquinas's argument. Go read The Last Superstition or Aquinas by Edward Feser. Afterwards, you could attempt Aquinas's Summa Contra Gentiles."

First, I like the idea of proportional taxation based on corporate income, but I can imagine a lot of corporations won't.  What sort of checks/benefits will your ideology provide to ensure corporations don't simply re-organize to another country with more equitable taxation?  If executive benefits and bonuses are internally organized, how would you, as a party, work to reform this standard, and move away from a quarterly income/revenue bonus tied system to a more balanced and growth friendly change to say, year-to-year cashflow increases, or some other more stable metric?  Let's say that power distribution (if not necessarily production) is federalized.  What sort of guarantees will we have that things like regulatory standards and the like are met, when the entity responsible for enforcing them is also the same that 'owns' the agency that is to be regulated?  Or, if left to public control, how is the revenue to be disseminated; rebates, investment into social projects, or utilized in part as a means of infrastructure maintenance/blended between all three?  How will intellectual property and invention rights be handled?  Will the creator/inventor still maintain some sole rights to income derived from their work, or will it become publicly available immediately?  What sort of incentives do you have planned to prevent innovative 'brain drain' from affecting the economy?  If you're planning on changing national focus for power generation away from coal/gas/oil, are you also willing to loosen restriction on new, safer, and more productive nuclear power generation, like LFTR and Molten Sodium reactors?"

Also, at least in the first trimester and possibly in the second, it does not have a mind developed enough to think like a human or feel pain."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,Leecannon_,10,Sat Jun 27 16:20:07 2015 UTC,But it's much different than a tumor. Tumors don't develop into beings. They don't develop life. They don't develop emotions. If anything they are the opposite. They take away life. They take away emotions. You're comparing apples to oranges.
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,ConquerorWM,9,Sat Jun 27 17:51:59 2015 UTC,So then using a condom should be crime by your logic because it prevents a potential life. Same with birth control. And maybe even cellibacy.
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,lsma,7,Sat Jun 27 17:54:32 2015 UTC,"Preventing something from happening is quite different from derailing it mid-journey.  When you use a condom, you are not destroying anything that could be a human."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,ConquerorWM,6,Sat Jun 27 19:52:04 2015 UTC,But derailing it while it is being created is not the same as destroying it after it is finished.
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,lsma,3,Sat Jun 27 19:56:53 2015 UTC,"So at what time is it ""finished""?  Birth?"
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,ConquerorWM,5,Sat Jun 27 20:24:35 2015 UTC,"Or when the baby has developed enough to have a body structure similar to that of a human in my opinion. Unlike, some I do believe that you shouldn't have an abortion late in pregnancy, but I do believe it's ok earlier."

ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,pseudojewboy,3,Sat Jun 27 22:17:07 2015 UTC,The Supreme Court's decision on Roe v. Wade essentially defined viability to be 24 weeks and onward. Hence the restriction on abortions after the 24th week.

The Supreme Court used a wonky trimester system in Roe v. Wade, with restrictions in the first trimester facing strict scrutiny and restrictions in the second trimester having less scrutiny.

ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,ConquerorWM,4,Sat Jun 27 17:59:21 2015 UTC,"You just make yourself sound more and more ridiculous. Preventing something from ""potentially"" happening is not a crime, especially when that thing is not required of you in the first place. You are not required by law to have children, and have the right to sexual privacy. That is a gross violation of people's personal freedoms and right to choose their path in life."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,Leecannon_,2,Sat Jun 27 18:02:01 2015 UTC,"This law is a balance I think. I understand your argument, and I disagree with most of them. You don't have to have a child. The government isn't going to force you to. You have the right to do what you want in the bedroom to a degree. But if you choose to not use contraceptives and birth control, you shouldn't have the right to end a life so you can continue on do whatever you want."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,ConquerorWM,7,Sat Jun 27 18:19:15 2015 UTC,"Many abortions are due to failure of birth control. Anyway, I believe in abortion in at the very least the first trimester, because it doesn't even have what makes it human, a brain, and can't feel pain. Plus, even if you make abortion illegal, people will still try to get them through other means. In countries where the practice has been banned, more people die because the abortions are messy and often botched when they are not legalized and regulated."

Souls, are a religious argument, so if you use that as the basis for this bill, then it is unconstitutional.

Um...  we still have different DNA.  Human DNA has specific differences with chimp DNA.  Sure, they are similar, but if you gave a scientist a piece of human DNA and a piece of chimp DNA, he could tell the difference.   This seems far-fatched. Please give me an example of what you are referring to.   Instead of trying to find specific medical conditions where someone has lost contact with their receptor nerves and experiences a debilitating mental handicap, I will just ask you this:  If someone with a debilitating mental handicap has lost connection with their sensory nerves, would you support their termination at their family's discretion?"
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,ConquerorWM,3,Sat Jun 27 21:35:56 2015 UTC,I don't consider the DNA argument pertinent here because it still lacks the characteristics of a human.  The mental handicap thing differs widely based on specific circumstances.

But I don't think a zygote is a human being until it is viable, so they are not special nor do they have special rights."

As for potential to impact the world, and to accomplish I must ask this: do babies have this? I mean, I guess they can when they are all grown up, but they're no different from fetuses in this regard."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,ModelDenizen,6,Sun Jun 28 00:54:43 2015 UTC,"Saying that a zygote is a human is like saying a tumor is human   No it's more like saying an apple seed is an apple.   A tumor is    a swelling of a part of the body, generally without inflammation, caused by an abnormal growth of tissue, whether benign or malignant.   A zygote is much closer to a human than a tumor is a human.  I don't agree with this legislation but no, I don't agree with your assertion either."

ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,ConquerorWM,2,Sat Jun 27 18:41:23 2015 UTC,I was expecting someone to use that argument and was simply trying to preempt that because I've heard it so many times. With all other arguments the metaphor is bad.

ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,MoralLesson,12,Sat Jun 27 21:52:02 2015 UTC,"This is a good bill, I hope it passes. I would fight for it if I was in office"
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,Eilanyan,10,Sat Jun 27 17:47:35 2015 UTC,"SUPPORT THIS BILL  Life begins at conception. This is a fact, and there is no arguing against it, lest you reject biology. Indeed, as the right denies the science of meteorology to defend its climate change denying, so too does the left deny the science of biology to defend its slaughter of innocent children.  A zygote possess all of the characteristics of life. This includes homeostasis, organization, metabolism, growth, reaction to stimuli, consisting of cell(s), and everything else. This cannot be denied without rejecting biology. Indeed, in Merriam-Websters,  conception is defined as ""the fusion of gametes to initiate the development of a new individual life or organism."" Thus, life begins at conception.  Now, is a human zygote human? Of course! It possesses human DNA, it has human parents, and it is a member of the human species. It is completely and utterly ontologically human. End of story.  Now, the left -- and even some on the center-right -- will try and make exceptions for murdering children -- including arguments from viability or from disregarding the right to life of the child because of rape, incest, danger to the mother, or bodily autonomy. While the last of these is completely self-defeating (what about the bodily autonomy of the child, after all), I will address the rest of these poor exceptions which should not be accepted either.  Firstly, while rape is an abhorrent crime and a grave tragedy, it by no means lessens the right of the child growing in the womb to life. Why punish the child for the crimes of his or her father? If your father robbed a bank, should you have to do the jail time on his behalf? While I cannot imagine the psychological trauma and great pain caused by rape, it by no means gives the mother the right to kill her child. Moreover, if we are going to allow people to kill others merely because they went through a horrific incident in life, we would likely have to give free reign to orphans, the families of murder victims, and a whole host of other people. A great evil was committed against those who were raped, but it by no means gives them license to kill – let alone a license to kill their very own child.  Incest is an extremely weak basis – for it is based either on the worry of genetic issues or on the taboo of incest alone. On the latter, we should not permit murder merely because of the violation of a social taboo. On the former, that means we would have to admit that every person with a disability is somehow less human or has no inherent right to live. The existence of a disability – mental, physical, or otherwise – can, by no means, be a basis for their lessening of value or the justification of killing them. Otherwise, under such a concept, such greats as Franklin Roosevelt, Hellen Keller, and Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah would have not only been less than human but would have had no right to live.  As for the child posing a threat to the health of the mother, this is perhaps the easiest to position to understand. Nonetheless, it is still an error. If there is a deathly sick man around you, who will likely give you his fatal disease, do you have a right to kill him to prevent yourself from getting it? I would argue that this is quite parallel to the arguement made by those who advocate for this exception to a ban on abortion. How can one truly justify the murder of an innocent person? Nonetheless, under the principle of double effect, it is permissible for there to be procedure aimed at saving the life of the mother which unintentionally results in the death of her unborn child. The key is that we are not attempting to actively kill the child when the principle of double effect is used.   Now, some will argue that even though an unborn child is a living human person, you are justified in killing it because it does not yet possess rights. These people will generally predicate these rights on one of the following: a) the ability to feel pain b) sentience c) sapience or the ability to engage in rational thought d) birth e) being viable outside of the womb. The first one is obviously problematic – people with certain degenerative nervous issues (think congenital analgesia) are unable to feel pain. Are they any less human or deserving of rights because of it? That would be a dubious position to take, for then all one would have to do in order to morally kill you is numb you beforehand or kill you in a painless manner. The second – sentience – is also a poor metric, as people in comas or passed out are unable to feel or experience the world around them. Imagine if someone born with congenital analgesia goes blind and deaf while losing the ability to taste and smell; do they, by virtue of losing their senses, cease to have a right to live? That would be preposterous! As for sapience or the ability to engage in rational thought – while a sleeping person or one in a coma is, at least temporarily, unable to engage in thought, neither is an infant or someone with severe mental impairment. However, neither such situation causes that person to forfeit their right to live. Of course, the fourth reason – which is only rarely cited – is perhaps the weakest of them all, as there is practically no difference between a human person the second before they are born and the second after – and then you have the very ambiguous time of when they are being born to work with.  Many will argue that viability outside of the womb is the key to the right to live. However, taking a growing embryo out of its mother’s womb – removing it from its natural environment and placing him or her in one hostile to their existence – is little different than dropping a person in the middle of the ocean a mile under water – it is not that person’s natural environment and they are wholly unable to live there. Some will argue that the embryo’s dependence on the mother is the key here, but children do not cease being dependent upon their parents for many years after they are born. Moreover, there are some fully grown adults who, due to a lack of white blood cells or other deficiencies in their immune system, are unable to leave sterile environments lest they die. Removing them from their environment would be equally as fatal as removing the embryo from his or her environment – the womb of their mother – yet no one argues that they have no right to live! Indeed, all of us, as humans, are dependent on the existence of oxygen or even the very Earth for our existence too – remove one and we perish. Merely because a person is reliant on a specific environment or dependent (indeed, is not everything but God contingent on something else anyways?) on someone or something (e.g., food or a specific medication) for their existence does not eliminate their inherent right to live.  Thus, I hope I have clearly demonstrated why every living human person – from the moment of conception until natural death – has the inalienable right to life (among several others which I will not expound upon here).  Again, I urge everyone to vote in favor of this bill.  Edit: Downvoting is against the rules of the subreddit. I was at 11 upvotes, and I am now at 9."

ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,kingofquave,10,Sun Jun 28 12:07:18 2015 UTC,Under no situation will I vote yea on this bill.
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,lsma,24,Sat Jun 27 17:12:02 2015 UTC,This is unnecessary and will destroy a woman's right to choose for herself.  A unicellular zygote is not a person.
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,locosherman1,17,Sat Jun 27 16:07:58 2015 UTC,"This is unnecessary and will destroy a woman's right to choose for herself.   A woman still has the right to choose.  Zygotes don't form on their own.   A unicellular zygote is not a person.   It has the potential to be a human.  Under normal circumstances it will be a human.  And we see many places in law where potential is just as good as actuality.  It is wrong to give someone a gun if they could potentially go berserk, wouldn't you say?"
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,scotladd,6,Sat Jun 27 20:00:07 2015 UTC,What about in cases of rape and teen pregnancy? Or when birth control doesn't work?
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,locosherman1,9,Sat Jun 27 20:33:42 2015 UTC,Rape (verified via rape kit) I would accept.  Teen pregnancy is a negative ghostrider.  Failed birth control is a no as well.
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,scotladd,5,Sat Jun 27 21:48:47 2015 UTC,"Why not teen pregnancy? Do you really expect a teenage girl to go through all the social trauma that comes with it? It's a life changing event especially at a young age like that and they deserve a second chance.  And people who used birth control took all the proper precautions to not have a pregnancy...  Just for the record, I'm for all abortions in any case within the first trimester, I just find it strange that even in special cases the ""pro life"" crowd can't see any expections."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,locosherman1,9,Sat Jun 27 22:40:13 2015 UTC,"A child's Right to Life outweighs the difficulty of making a teenage girl endure social trauma. Again, just because the mother's life may be uncomfortable, does not mean she can kill a child to ease her social woes. Otherwise why not legalize vigilante murders of school bullies? They are making someone go through social trauma aren't they?  As for the people who used birth control that's great, but they are still trying to kill a child. A mistake is supposed to end someone's life?"
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,Libertarian-Party,7,Sat Jun 27 22:44:01 2015 UTC,"But it's not exactly a child though is it? It's really just a cell at conception. How can life begin there? Going by your definition of when life begins, should birth control/condoms also be considered murder? Because you are blocking a childs right to be born?"
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,105Hummel,2,Sat Jun 27 22:50:29 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting thing, in terms of your last sentence, I think this may be specifically related to using ""Plan B.""   Plan B is of course taken the day of or day after unprotected sex to ensure that there will be no pregnancy, in general dubbed ""the morning after pill.""   I personally do not believe the morning after pill can be considered abortion because sperm take usually 2 days to travel up the filopian tubes, and etc. Therefore chemicals such as Plan B would prevent conception, but NOT end it."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,Libertarian-Party,2,Sat Jun 27 23:00:34 2015 UTC,"Plan B pills don't touch anything but sperm. I'm not sure if they slow it down, block it, or kill it — but it definitely just affects sperm."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,scotladd,2,Sun Jun 28 06:21:09 2015 UTC,"right, therefore I am completely supportive of Plan B, and Plan B would NOT be affected by this legislation."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,pseudojewboy,3,Sun Jun 28 06:54:22 2015 UTC,And there are special cases I would allow:  Rape verified via rape kit  Incest verified via DNA  Immediate clear and present danger to the mother's life  massive debilitating birth defects
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,scotladd,3,Sat Jun 27 22:48:39 2015 UTC,"Rape verified via rape kit   Not all women who are raped go to the police or hospital in time for a rape kit, because they are terrified of what their rapist might do or are too ashamed to admit it at first. What about them?"
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,pseudojewboy,2,Sat Jun 27 23:04:38 2015 UTC,"No verification, no abortion. If you are determined enough to kill the baby, them you should be required to prove the rape.  If you cannot be bothered to endure the rape kit, why should the child be asked to forfeit its life?"
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,locosherman1,3,Sat Jun 27 23:12:21 2015 UTC,But a woman might not even know she has conceived within the short amount of time a rape kit can be performed. This point of view sounds very patriarchal and harsh towards victims of rape who are often incredibly traumatized and not thinking clearly.
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,scotladd,2,Sat Jun 27 23:17:47 2015 UTC,So only in extremely serious cases?
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,locosherman1,2,Sat Jun 27 22:51:40 2015 UTC,Yessir.
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,Libertarian-Party,2,Sat Jun 27 22:53:11 2015 UTC,"So going by your definition again, you're still killing the thing, aren't you? Is that not considered murder?"
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,locosherman1,2,Sat Jun 27 22:59:49 2015 UTC,"I'm confused. So if I said having a younger brother would be a huge financial hassle so I killed my brother because I didn't feel ""comfortable,"" is that okay?  If a mother decides to ""abort"" an infant child because she recently lost her job and can't support him, is that legal?  It's the same issue here. Inconveniences don't magically make it alright to murder your children. Bring them up for adoption.   On the other hand, I definitely believe the government (state or federal) should be given more resources to tackle this issue. Though most social programs are bloated and a waste of money, the foster care system is one that can only benefit from increased funding and care."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,Libertarian-Party,2,Sat Jun 27 22:58:05 2015 UTC,No it wouldn't be ok since it's already born and has a life. In that case it is murder. Not when it's just a tiny little cell.
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,locosherman1,3,Sat Jun 27 23:01:37 2015 UTC,"""just"" a tiny little cell.... that grows up to be a full human.  honestly infants are not people. They can't even talk, walk, feed themselves, change their own clothes, or pay taxes. It's just a tiny little collection of cells. Legalize abortion until age 15. We'll call it Unwinding.  On a more serious note, if a fetus can be removed and live outside the womb, why the heck isn't it considered a person with a life? Why the hell do we support late term abortions in many states?"
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,Logic_85,2,Sat Jun 27 23:06:16 2015 UTC,"An infant has feelings, emotions, and whatnot. I'd say it's human. That thing that begins when the sperm meets the egg has none of those.  Late term abortions are a whole nother argument."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,Gohte,2,Sat Jun 27 23:10:46 2015 UTC,"So does a fetus. It can feel at about 4-5 weeks, and cry at abut 12-14 weeks."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,MoralLesson,2,Sun Jun 28 15:40:41 2015 UTC,"honestly infants are not people. They can't even talk, walk, feed themselves, change their own clothes, or pay taxes. It's just a tiny little collection of cells. Legalize abortion until age 15. We'll call it Unwinding.   The thing about Libertarians is that I've seen pretty much this exact sentiment on /r/anarcho_capitalism so I wasn't sure if you were serious or not until the end."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,locosherman1,5,Sun Jun 28 06:24:41 2015 UTC,What about the child's right to live?
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,MoralLesson,3,Sat Jun 27 22:13:35 2015 UTC,It's not a child yet though is it?
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,locosherman1,5,Sat Jun 27 22:33:53 2015 UTC,"It's not a child yet though is it?   Yes it is. Life begins at conception. Basic biology teaches us this. The left is as bad with biology as the right is with meteorology, it appears."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,pseudojewboy,4,Sat Jun 27 22:50:48 2015 UTC,In what way does basic biology show that?  A cell does not display anything human about it.   To me this argument doesn't seem scientific at all. Peoples opinions on this are all just a matter of religous belief.
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,MoralLesson,6,Sat Jun 27 22:56:53 2015 UTC,Peoples opinions on this are all just a matter of religous belief.   Bingo.
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,locosherman1,3,Sat Jun 27 23:08:36 2015 UTC,In what way does basic biology show that?   A zygote meets all of the characteristics of life. Conception is also when new organisms start. I don't know what more you need.   A cell does not display anything human about it.   I presume you're not made up of about 40 trillion cells then? My mistake. I don't know where I got the crazy idea that human bodies are made up of cells.   To me this argument doesn't seem scientific at all.   Then I take it you don't accept much science.
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,MoralLesson,2,Sat Jun 27 23:00:11 2015 UTC,That's different though. No one denies that it's when an organism begins to form. But the argument is wether or not it is human or not. Wether or not it is considered murder.
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,puregamer55,4,Sat Jun 27 23:06:11 2015 UTC,"No one denies that it's when an organism begins to form.   Okay, so a zygote is alive. We can agree on that! Yay! A lot of people in this thread have been attempting to deny that fact with crazy mental gymnastics.   But the argument is wether or not it is human or not. Wether or not it is considered murder.   A zygote has human DNA. It has human parents. It is a member of the human species. It is ontologically human. So, it's pretty clearly human. Ergo, killing it is murder."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,pseudojewboy,5,Sat Jun 27 23:15:18 2015 UTC,"A zygote is the result of two human human parents reproducing and therein conceiving through the human fathers sperm, and the human mother's egg cell. This creates the zygote. The zygote according to genetics, has a human genetic code. The zygote is an individual organism of it's own and possesses biological functions of it's own. The zygote, I reiterate is a cell that is gravely different, than ordinary cells of the body."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,jogarz,2,Sat Jun 27 23:16:12 2015 UTC,"A unicellular zygote is not viable, therefore it is not alive by any definition of life other than a religious one. I think it is the right who misunderstand biology."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,lsma,3,Sat Jun 27 23:06:48 2015 UTC,"Children are simply humans that aren't fully grown. Fetuses are no different: they are humans that are not yet fully developed. All humans have a right to live, no matter what stage of life they're at.  You're right it's not a child yet, but that doesn't mean it isn't human. Childhood is one stage of many in human development."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,locosherman1,3,Sat Jun 27 23:21:21 2015 UTC,"A woman's right to choose is not only bogus because she has a choice 90% of the time, but also because the child has rights as well.  And this brings us back to how you define a human being.  Arguing that outlawing abortion is against a woman's right to choose is meaningless."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,Libertarian-Party,3,Sat Jun 27 21:45:31 2015 UTC,It is a womans right to chose wether or not she wants/she can go through pregnancy. The little thing that is made when the sperm meets the egg is not a child. It's not even human yet.
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,Danotto94,2,Sat Jun 27 22:43:04 2015 UTC,"then you get into the issue where a live human is aborted at 38 weeks because there is no definition of human life by the government except post birth. Which makes no sense.  Please tell me why it's okay to abort a 30 week ""fetus,"" when most babies at 30 weeks can be safely removed prematurely and survive with medical support and life support to be a healthy person?  Defining life at conception is a great start, and the most logical conclusion (non political)  that there can be."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,ModelDenizen,10,Sat Jun 27 23:02:34 2015 UTC,"I would like to remind people, especially newer members, that downvoting is against sub rules."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,bluefisch200,3,Sat Jun 27 16:42:08 2015 UTC,Trolls don't care.
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,scotladd,6,Sat Jun 27 22:55:44 2015 UTC,I am absolutely not in favor of this legislation but as a quibble   A unicellular zygote is not a person.   Isn't a very strong statement. How long does a zygote stay unicellular?
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,Eilanyan,3,Sat Jun 27 16:11:47 2015 UTC,"Î think that is only an argument against this:   ""Conception"" will be defined as the moment of fusion of the human sperm and human egg.   and    The government shall define life to begin at conception."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,Brenin91,4,Sat Jun 27 16:51:23 2015 UTC,"The Constitution issues us the Right to Life. There is no ""Right to Chose"" stated anywhere in the Constitution. Our Rights end at the point where they cost someone else their life. Letting a woman end the life of another person because it may be inconvenient for her to be pregnant at that time in her life, or it may ruin her GPA, or her parents would be mad if they found out, or she doesn't want to be tied to the father for 18 years etc. is monstrous and inhumane.  The only viable circumstances should be in cases of rape or incest (verified via rape kit or DNA test respectively), massive debilitating deformity, or if the life of the mother is in immediate clear and present danger.   Anything else is murder, plain and simple."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,scotladd,8,Sat Jun 27 21:47:21 2015 UTC,"Personally speaking, I don't think it's quite fair to say there should be no limits on abortion (like 8 month abortion where there are no health risks). But this is a nightmare, is not even going by when there is a zygote but when there's a chance, maybe, in a few weeks something might start happening.   ALP is entirely against this bill."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,Xarasystral,7,Sat Jun 27 16:11:48 2015 UTC,"Given all the discussion on this heavy issue, I would just like to say that I am glad that this bill has been brought in and has caused such passionate discussion on both sides.  That being said, it was President Reagan who said ""I've noticed everyone who is for abortion has already been born.""  We tell ourselves all the time that my rights end where your rights begin. However, the most fundamental of these is the right to life.  Without life as a foundation for all other rights, then we are left with absolutely nothing.  Life is the foundation upon which all of our other rights are built.    Even our founders recognized this, stating in the Declaration of Independence that we are endowed by our creator with unalienable rights, and that among them were ""Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.  Note which one came first, and you will find very quickly which one all others are built upon.  Therefore, the right of life for all humans, even those not fully developed, is paramount if we are to claim to be a guardian of freedom and liberty."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,lsma,2,Sun Jun 28 04:11:30 2015 UTC,Here Here!
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,ConquerorWM,13,Sun Jun 28 17:28:52 2015 UTC,"I mean.. What is this? Is this a futile attempt to (sneaking of course) overturn the rights of women to choose abortions? I will never vote Yea on this, even if a subsection was dedicated to giving golden bars to every member of congress."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,lsma,4,Sat Jun 27 17:16:31 2015 UTC,Why is it a woman's right to terminate something that has the potential to be a human being?
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,ConquerorWM,4,Sat Jun 27 20:01:46 2015 UTC,"Because it is not yet a human being and much closer to being an animal or plant, as it lacks sentience or morality."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,scotladd,2,Sat Jun 27 20:07:59 2015 UTC,"Sentience?  Can you define that term for me?  And do you really think that someone is not human unless they have morality?  I would think you as a GL would be a moral relativist.  In any case, there are people without consciences who still hold the right to life by law."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,bluefisch200,5,Sat Jun 27 20:20:21 2015 UTC,"""Sentience is the ability to feel, perceive, or experience subjectively."" A zygote can't feel anything, nor can a baby for the first few weeks of pregnancy. And yes, I do believe that every human has an innate sense of right and wrong. I don't fit your normal left wing stereotype."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,lsma,3,Sat Jun 27 20:25:41 2015 UTC,"Yet you are comfortable overturning the child's Right to Life?  Why is her ""right to choose (something not guaranteed anywhere) superseding the child's Right to Life?"
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,ConquerorWM,12,Sat Jun 27 21:55:17 2015 UTC,This is totally against my believes.   What you describe is not life. It is not thinking or feeling pain.   As this sounds like a way to forbid abortion I can not see how to support this bill. Abortion should be possible until the can feel pain and it should be paid for by the state.  Edit: make first trimester to the point the fetus can feel pain
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,lsma,5,Sat Jun 27 16:19:15 2015 UTC,So you define life as thinking and feeling pain?  That is rather unscientific.  So you are dead while sleeping?
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,ConquerorWM,8,Sat Jun 27 19:53:21 2015 UTC,"You both are thinking and can feel pain while you sleep. I've been woken by pain before. In terms of thinking, where do you think dreams come from? Edit: Also, it has not developed sentience nor a feeling of morality or anything, so what separates it from an animal?"
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,MoralLesson,5,Sat Jun 27 19:58:51 2015 UTC,It is not an animal or a plant because it has both a human DNA and the potential to be a fully formed human person.  You can't feel or think in a coma.  Do people in comas cease to be people?  Are they dead?  Is it OK to kill them?
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,ConquerorWM,9,Sat Jun 27 20:23:46 2015 UTC,"It is not an animal or a plant because it has both a human DNA and the potential to be a fully formed human person.   You know what else has human DNA? Sperm. So when sperm is wasted, is that murder? Additionally, you keep talking about what it could potentially be. If it's not human yet, then why can't you kill it?   You can't feel or think in a coma.   Someone in a coma still has a partially active mind. They just don't have certain parts of their brain functional."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,jogarz,3,Sat Jun 27 20:29:44 2015 UTC,"You know what else has human DNA? Sperm. So when sperm is wasted, is that murder? Additionally, you keep talking about what it could potentially be. If it's not human yet, then why can't you kill it?   Sperm does not contain DNA, actually. It contains RNA.  Moreover, sperm is not alive as it does not meet the characteristics of life, which a zygote does. A zygote is a person -- it is a living organism and it is human. What more could you need to be a person?"
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,ConquerorWM,5,Sat Jun 27 22:24:03 2015 UTC,"Sperm does not contain DNA, actually. It contains RNA.   Sorry, forgot about that. But you still get my point.   What more could you need to be a person?   Everything other than DNA that makes a person actually function as a person: Organs, sentience, etc."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,bluefisch200,3,Sun Jun 28 01:34:35 2015 UTC,Do you agree that bacteria are alive?
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,lsma,2,Sat Jun 27 23:01:32 2015 UTC,Yes.
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,bluefisch200,3,Sun Jun 28 01:31:32 2015 UTC,"I never defined life as thinking and feeling pain but I said that without those attributes you will not understand that you die. It is the same thing as if you would be hooked on a machine without brain activities. At the moment it is up to your family members or someone else you gave those rights to end your ""life"". The same comes with a fetus. Except that the fetus never experience life, the human on the machine did. Your brain is working while you are asleep, pain is only something your brain creates. So yes, you can experience pain while you sleep (even if you are not under physical pain actually)."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,lsma,6,Sat Jun 27 20:24:06 2015 UTC,"Why is brain activity required to be alive?  If the family knew for certain that the person hooked up to the machine would pull out of his brain-deadness in a few months, would they be acting correctly to terminate the guy?  If his wife was tired of him, if he was ""unwanted,"" does that give her the right to terminate him even if it is a medical fact that he will regain consciousness?"
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,bluefisch200,3,Sat Jun 27 20:30:38 2015 UTC,"If the family knows that for sure they will most likely not terminate the life of the person. And they should not be capable of doing so if it is known for sure that the person will regain his consciousness.   That is however not similar to a fetus. The unconscious person had a previous life, he has social relationships with other people. A fetus is only a few cells without any previous conscious life."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,MoralLesson,3,Sat Jun 27 20:37:40 2015 UTC,"May I ask why you have to have had a previous life?  You are saying that someone needs previous social relationships in order to have the right to life, right?  You need to have given something to society in order to be worthy to live?"
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,bluefisch200,4,Sat Jun 27 21:42:23 2015 UTC,"That is all just coming from you.   If I end the life of someone who has social relationships I am hurting the people at that end.   In addition we are here talking about someone who experienced life and will experience it again one day again. The fetus never experienced life, he doesn't know what life is, he doesn't even have any organ (working or not) that is capable of recognizing life as we do it.  You can try to turn this around as much as you want. A fetus is no human, he isn't even an animal but only cells without any consciousness. A human without brain activity is however a human. His brain stopped working but it worked at some point. And we can at one point be sure that it will work again and record more information.   If the human at the machine never would have experienced life before and it wouldn't hurt anyone if he would stop existing we could surely terminate his life."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,MoralLesson,4,Sat Jun 27 22:10:52 2015 UTC,"This is totally against my believes.   So? Same-sex marriage was just rammed down our throats against our beliefs and your side of the debate said it doesn't matter.   What you describe is not life. It is not thinking or feeling pain.   So, let me get this straight, a person in a coma with congenital analgesia is not alive? That's pretty harsh.  Face it, your definition of life is worthless. Look up the life cycle of any animal -- it starts at conception. Humans are no exception.   As this sounds like a way to forbid abortion I can not see how to support this bill. Abortion should be possible until the can feel pain and it should be paid for by the state.   It is to outlaw killing babies. I'm glad you noticed."

ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,MoralLesson,4,Sat Jun 27 22:25:23 2015 UTC,"And yet it doesn't matter if we remove a body of cells or not.    You're dodging the question because you know your definition of life does not hold water and that life does in fact begin at conception. Cells make up all living things -- including you and the children murdered by abortion -- so your clever use of terminology really doesn't help your case.   There is nothing that ever recorded anything. Nothing that is worth to preserve. It is an empty canister without space to fill.   I don't even know what you're trying to say here. I'm guessing you're trying to dehumanize the human baby in the womb so you can justify allowing someone to kill it, though.   No, it outlaws removing cells.   Cells that happen to be a human person -- just like how your body is ~40 trillion cells. Is taking all of your cells apart and killing you kosher then too?"

I'm guessing you're trying to dehumanize the human baby in the womb so you can justify allowing someone to kill it, though.   It is a fetus without any brain activity. It is as problematic to remove those cells as to eat a plant. Except that the plant is not produced by the mother who is the person that has to make a decision. She is the one who has to decide here.   Cells that happen to be a human person -- just like how your body is ~40 trillion cells. Is taking all of your cells apart and killing you kosher then too?

Why is brain activity the defining characteristic of being alive? I mean, biology says it isn't a necessary characteristic of being alive.   The fetus is only a constellation of cells that can not record a single moment of his existence.   Firstly, the fetus can and does grow and react to stimuli -- so it clearly records and responds to its existence. Secondly, there are numerous species with as little intellectual capacity as a new unborn child. Shall we exclude them from the animal kingdom now too because you've had a new epiphany as to what life is that completely goes against scientific consensus?  You base your entire argument off brain activity, and yet that has nothing to do with being alive. I realize it might inconvenience some sex lives to outlaw abortion, but I think ending the murder of innocent children is worth that."

I realize it might inconvenience some sex lives to outlaw abortion, but I think ending the murder of innocent children is worth that.   It has everything to do with brain activity. Before the brain starts operating you are not understanding anything your body reacts to. It is not necessary to care about such cell constellations.   Yes that may sound hard and go against your believes but it is nothing to care for."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,jogarz,2,Sat Jun 27 23:04:45 2015 UTC,"How do you record something if you do not have the necessary tools to understand and save the data?   DNA is literally data, so it does record information -- from the very moment of conception. Also, the zygote (and single-celled organisms like many bacterium, for that matter) uses the information encoded in its DNA to manufacture proteins, so it clearly has some understanding of it.  This is not to mention that newborns have no intellectual understanding whatsoever, so you must also exclude children under a month or so from being alive and being worthy of human dignity by using any stricter definition than I have.  Not that mentally ""recording information"" has anything to do with being alive. You can scream that it does all you want, but it still doesn't change the scientific consensus on when life begins (and I take it you didn't actually read the characteristics of life, lest you would have know this).  So, can we stop murdering children already, or are you going to propose legalizing infanticide up to a month post-birth using your strange and non-scientific definition of life?"

You can scream that it does all you want, but it still doesn't change the scientific consensus on when life begins (and I take it you didn't actually read the characteristics of life, lest you would have know this).

Just because something is not self-aware does not mean it is not alive. Bacteria don't have any brain activity either, and yet we consider them alive.   It is as problematic to remove those cells as to eat a plant.    Plants are not human. They will not grown into humans, they do not have the human genome. Fetuses have both.   Except that the plant is not produced by the mother who is the person that has to make a decision. She is the one who has to decide here.   Again, plants are not human for reasons stated above. Fetuses are. Humans are afforded special rights by our legal systems other living things aren't, primarily, the right to life. That is the most basic of all human rights.   Except that my cells have reached a state where brain activity and feelings exist and where I actively experienced and recorded my surrounding. The fetus is only a constellation of cells that can not record a single moment of his existence.   Not being able to record memories or to think does not mean one is unalive. Again, bacteria can do neither, and we consider them alive. Hell, many fully-grown humans can't record memories either."

ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,driveLikeYouStoleIt,5,Sat Jun 27 16:50:05 2015 UTC,Murder of a pregnant woman constitutes a double homicide. The government has already deemed that life (at least) in utero is viable (see Lacci and Conner's Law).  Life is life whether it's wanted or unwanted. It's time to utilize a definition of life that is compatible with the findings of modern embryology and biology. This bill does just that.
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,ExpensiveFoodstuffs,5,Sun Jun 28 04:02:17 2015 UTC,To those who are worried that this bill is a violation of women's rights be mindful that the pro-choice movement is a later development of 2nd wave feminism.

Why would a zygote be considered ""alive"" (for the purposes of saying it is a human with full Constitutional rights) but someone who ceases to live is still ""alive"" for an hour and a half once they cease to live? Why is a zygote ""alive"" when it will not have a heartbeat for weeks, yet a man whose heart ceased beating 85 minutes ago is still ""alive""?   Even if this was not a bald attempt to restrict a woman's right to choose, it should still make you scratch your head. If your concern was honestly the injustice against the most vulnerable citizens then bring forth legislation directed at those truly suffering. Address hungry children living in poverty, homeless veterans forgotten once used, or minority groups with limited access to education and opportunities that end up incarcerated at embarrassing rates."

You are not automatically dead when you're heart stops beating.  Look it up.  You can last up to an hour and a half from when your heart ceases to beat or longer under certain conditions.   Why is a zygote ""alive"" when it will not have a heartbeat for weeks, yet a man whose heart ceased beating 85 minutes ago is still ""alive""?   Having a heartbeat is not the definition of life.  However, it is a good identifier to see if someone is dead, as no one has lasted longer than two hours without a heartbeat."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,sviridovt,2,Sat Jun 27 20:04:52 2015 UTC,"Then not to battle over semantics and get combative, but then would an unborn person not be alive until they have established a heartbeat and kept it for longer than two hours? If they are a person at conception, but no one has been alive with 2+ hours without a heartbeat...

The government shall define life to end after a time of one and one half hours (1 hour, 30 minutes) after the heart ceases to beat.   Why such long time? We know of no way to bring someone back to life even after 15 minutes from heart ceasing to beat. As soon as brain dies, the person is irreversibly gone.

Will the puritanical theocrats be willing to take the actions, such as providing free, or low cost birth control to low income people, that will actually prevent abortions? Will they consider that their policies of mis-education, are a primary factor driving unplanned births?   Will they consider that sexuality is one of the few pleasures the the working class can enjoy, simply because it one that they can at least afford?   Will prohibiting abortion make it go away, or just make in go underground, where it can be performed by untrained exploiters, looking to make a quick black market buck?

If the individual carrying the baby defines life as occurring post birth, then she should be allowed to have an abortion because in her eyes it never existed in the first place. There should not be a bill which so blatantly oversteps the individual's right to choose when life begins, and infringes upon the opinions of so many people. Even in this thread alone it is possible to see the wide range of views, and any definition that you give is ultimately going to leave a large number of people unhappy."

Yes, as human beings we are responsible for our choices, but I cannot back a piece of legislation that not only could force severe psychological trauma on the mother, but if life is defined as ""at conception"", resulting in a high risk for a murder-suicide spike.  A woman knowing she has to carry a child to term against her will is going to up severe depression rates in this country. Forcing women to carry upon conception is also going to result in an unnecessary burden on our social programs for children in the CPS system, dropped off at hospitals, etc.  I have absolutely no problem with early abortion and will fight tooth and nail to back their rights to determine what happens as a part of their bodies within a certain period of time.   We have doctors and scientists to help determine when these actions are safe for mother and what can officially be identified as an unborn child and I see absolutely no reason to deviate from the status quo."

It is wrong to force a human into a bad situation. If a couple or a single woman decides that they cannot financially or emotionally support a child, then it is unfair to both the parent(s) and the child.   In my opinion, it is common sense that an embryo is not a human. It cannot think, feel, make memories, or biologically support itself. With that said, by the 21 week mark (the point at which the fetus' brain begins to develop) the pregnant female should be forced to make a decision to abort or to keep the child.   Additionally, the strain that is placed on the parent often results in a single female being unable to work, unable to support her child, and the burden of this child and mother falls on the government."

ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,da_drifter0912,3,Sun Jun 28 00:01:38 2015 UTC,Science defines life as beginning there. We don't see that such a kind of life is already worth to be defended by law as if it would be a human being.   But I know that discussing with you only results in you claiming that fetus are the same as other similar organism except for their DNA.

ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,pseudojewboy,2,Sat Jun 27 20:08:08 2015 UTC,"Let's not assume we're right, this is easily one of, if not, the most controversial debates in contemporary politics.  First off, do I think we should kill non-breathing citizens? Could you rephrase that? To me, a non-breathing citizen is a dead citizen, therefore cannot celebrate his/her rights.   Scientifically, nothing magical happens at birth. We could go into debate about laicism and social development, but I worry it'll veer away from the topic. We consider a natural person a citizen the moment it is born, not before. Otherwise, should a fetus be considered a citizen of a nation because the woman is in that nation? Are fetuses considered American if they were conceived on American soil but born on foreign land? A fetus is not a citizen.   My true motives behind this argument are protecting woman's right to choose, not whether I consider a fetus a citizen. It's absurd that the majority of the politicians in charge of keeping/making this procedure legal/illegal, will never have to face the situation.   But let me ask you this, if you're so keen on protecting that ""life"" and future citizen, I'm guessing you're also eager to provide social care for the child, right? I mean what if it's born into poverty? We need to provide social health and education programs for it and it's guardians until it turns 18y/o.. right?"
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,scotladd,3,Sat Jun 27 21:07:31 2015 UTC,"That's what a citizen is entitled to after all, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. As to how those social health and educational systems, among other programs are implemented, whether they are run by the government, private organizations, or a combination of the two is another matter. For our party platform, we would support programs that would help support the mother throughout a pregnancy if she nor her family could afford it.  And even then, there are existing programs to allow for adoptions to occur, no questions asked. So even if after the support is given, the mother still does not want to keep the child, the mother may give the child up for adoption."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,HIPSTER_SLOTH,2,Sat Jun 27 23:47:08 2015 UTC,Would you rather kill the child than provide social support for it? Then why not euthanize orphans? It would be cheaper than supporting them by this logic.

The sperm and egg have in fact formed a unique human life seen from its genetic code. This can be known through the fact that the cell from which was created can grow. That is right, the cells continue to become something more, being a constant chemical reaction. That sounds like a life to me, as I cannot life to something that just depends on exterior appearance."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,intel4200,2,Sat Jun 27 20:49:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't agree with section 1 of this bill. I believe a zygote should only be considered ""alive"" if it can live on its own when removed from the mother. I think the current law restricting abortions to 24 weeks gestation is reasonable.  I think that removing the autonomy of our female citizens to protect the possible future life of an unwanted child is morally and practically wrong. What kind of life is there for an unwanted child being raised by a poor, teenage single mother? One likely full of suffering and the perpetuation of the mother's dire position. Not to mention that taking away our own female citizens' right to choose for the sake of an unknown result is tyrannical and patriarchal.  I strongly oppose this bill and all other attempts to outlaw abortion."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,qrhoo,2,Sat Jun 27 22:10:27 2015 UTC,"Considering multiple children have been born at 21 weeks, 5 days should invalidate the 24 week restriction on its face."

ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,MoralLesson,2,Sun Jun 28 02:42:56 2015 UTC,"I was elected to fill u/Isma's seat and I support this bill! I believe that abortion is murder and should not be allowed unless in three cases, rape, incest, or if it constitutes a danger to the mother's life."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,ConquerorWM,2,Sun Jun 28 20:43:32 2015 UTC,"While the fundamental thesis of the bill (that, strictly speaking, life begins at conception) is not necessarily wrong, I worry that the implication of this legislation would lead to unacceptable state restrictions on both reproductive rights and scientific progress. It is true that a zygote is, in the most rudimentary sense of the word, 'alive', and perhaps even a 'human being' of a particular type. We may even accept that, as a human being, this unconscious substance is a person with rights. However, even accepting this conclusion, it does not logically follow that, for instance, the killing of this person is always and everywhere morally unjust.  This is not because the fetus is 'incapable of reason', because, under normal circumstances, it is assumed that this fetus will grow to a stage of maturity at which is may have a consciousness capable of the power of reason. That this power is not as yet so proximate to the fetus as it is to an adult human being does not mean that the fetus does not possess it in a more remote way, and is thus entitled to all the same rights of personhood that we accord to mature rational persons. By means of analogy, a man asleep is not currently exercising the power of reason, but this does not mean that he is deprived of it - only possesses it more remotely.  A fetus, as much a human being as an adult, may nonetheless be justifiably killed by an abortion because its continued existence imposes an involuntary aggression upon its host: a mother has not entered into an explicit arrangement with the fetus by which the fetus is entitled to the use of the mother's body, so the mother is within her rights to remove the fetus through the least violent means available, just as a homeowner is entitled to remove a burglar from her property with the least coercion necessary. At this time, inducing labor may be quite dangerous and, at some stages, even impossible, and, in these cases, abortion may be the least-coercive means of retaining bodily rights. To that end, a fetus may be a living person, but its killing may also be justified.  I urge others who may agree with the central thesis of the bill (the proposition that a fetus is alive) to nonetheless vote against it on the grounds that it will set a dangerous legal precedent for the eroding of abortion rights. I would instead urge my fellow representatives to submit a modified version of the bill which provides for this standard of abortion rights. Such a bill could suitably regulate the circumstances under which embryonic experimentation may take place: only those human lives which are incapable of maturing to the state of maturity (reason) at which rights are assumed may be considered non-persons, legally speaking."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,lsma,2,Sun Jun 28 21:39:13 2015 UTC,"Forgive me if this has already been asked, but how does this bill cover the 5-6 weeks between gestation and the first heartbeat? The first fetal heartbeat does not occur until ~6 weeks after fertilization. With the wording of this bill for 6 weeks a woman has what amounts to be an immortal being in her. By your definition of when life has ended, the fetus cannot possibly die."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,ExpensiveFoodstuffs,2,Tue Jun 30 01:42:53 2015 UTC,"History has shown that when the government try's to legislate morality, it fails horribly. This bill is no different"
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,scotladd,2,Sun Jun 28 17:50:01 2015 UTC,"All laws are based on morality. We outlaw murder (which abortion is a version of anyways) because it is immoral. We outlaw theft because it is immoral. We outlaw rape because it is immoral.  Now, you'll say ""we outlaw those things because it harms someone"" but that itself is a moral stance -- as in it is immoral to harm someone. Moreover, since life begins at conception, having an abortion or killing the embryo is harming someone (and murdering them to boot)."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,lsma,2,Mon Jun 29 16:32:41 2015 UTC,"Hear, Hear!"
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,scotladd,6,Wed Jul 1 04:59:34 2015 UTC,"I have a question: As a libertarian, shouldn't this bill which effectively bans abortion go against your strong beliefs in personal freedoms and against a government which makes choices for its citizens?"
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,Smitty9913,3,Sat Jun 27 15:55:57 2015 UTC,"I would like to point out that it does not trample on anyone's rights, but only supports the rights of the child."
ModelUSGov,3bb9kl,lsma,4,Sat Jun 27 16:24:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Claiming the ""right"" to choose an abortion is counter intuitive to the debate because we believe no such right exists."

ModelUSGov,3bc7tm,puregamer55,3,Sat Jun 27 22:07:31 2015 UTC,It's not a ruling but rather a petition for the Court to hear the case.
ModelUSGov,3bc7tm,MoralLesson,2,Sat Jun 27 22:11:58 2015 UTC,"Okay, I got you."
ModelUSGov,3bc7tm,puregamer55,0,Sat Jun 27 22:12:36 2015 UTC,I agree with this very much as well. Recreational Marijuana being fully legal will cause a lot more trouble than people may think. There are way too many negative side effects that people refuse to acknowledge for prolong usage of THC.

ModelUSGov,3b7on2,bwowm,2,Tue Jul 14 04:30:45 2015 UTC,I think that the moderators prefer you to use your real political view.

I decided to join the Democrats and form the labor left-wing. When the Greens came along it was obvious that it would become the de-facto communist party. I didn't enjoy myself very much in the MHOC CP so I elected to stay out of the Greens. I decided to have some fun and test your mettle by putting obstacles in the way of the GL: a right-wing labor leadership, a reactionary coup, a babbling right-wing press. While none of these took great toll on the GLs I had fun. That fun is over and I'm tired of being negative. So I've decided to relaunch myself with views closer to my IRL ones."

ModelUSGov,3b7on2,jacoby531,2,Wed Jul 8 21:11:33 2015 UTC,"Marxism-Leninism-Maoism (MLM, or just Maoism) is a revolutionary communist philosophy that takes concepts from Mao Tsetung Thought and uses them to build upon Marxism-Leninism (what you called 'Stalinism'). The characteristic concepts of MLM are the mass line organization of the vanguard party, the Protracted People's War strategy of revolutionary warfare, and the cultural revolution theory of maintaining the revolutionary socialist state against internal bourgeois threats and ensuring that the socialist state remains for the people.  Maoists consider it a higher stage of Marxism-Leninism.  tl;dr MLM expands on Leninist revolutionary theory."

Then representatives of that party fill the seats.   So 'campaigning' isn't for yourself, but for your party. Except inside your party, then it's for yourself.

ModelUSGov,3b7on2,Leecannon_,2,Fri Jul 3 20:33:33 2015 UTC,The state elections are after the federal ones
ModelUSGov,3b7on2,raysfan95,2,Fri Jul 3 23:13:24 2015 UTC,"Ok, well I want to get involved. I want to represent the state of Nevada. I side with the democrats for most issues. I want people to ask me questions on literally anything. Here is an over view of my beliefs:  I am pro-choice when it comes to abortion. I believe however that abortion should not happen later then 3 months. It is the god given right of every woman to decide what to do with their body. That is my stance on abortion.  I support the legalization of the same sex marriage. As far as I see it; it doesn't hurt no buddy and just gives the average American more choices and their rights expended. Religious views should have no bearing on weather someone should get married or not. Separation of church and state applies here.  I believe that businesses should not deny service to a customer based on their religious beliefs. I don't believe this demands further explanation.  I strongly believe that welfare recipients should not be tested for drugs. A kid has no choice in which parent they where born into. Most people who go to welfare need it to feed their kids. If the parents are rejected welfare because they are tested positive for drugs then the kids get to starve.   I believe we can't do enough to protect the environment. Its not just about protecting the environment but its about protecting lives not only in America but the whole world. There is a fine line to walk on when working on these issues however. Reasonable measures should be taken to protect the environment and the rights of the companies to serve the American public. There is a lot of improvment and work that can be done in this area.  I also believe our national parks and reserves around the nation should stay protected by the federal government. I see no reason why our beautiful lands should be stopped being protected.  I strongly believe people purchasing a gun should be required to pass a criminal and safety background check.  Again, just ask me any questions and I will answer them in a timely manner. I would love to serve the American public. Please consider to vote for me."

It's political suicide in the US to be an anti-Zionist, or really to support the Palestinian people in any way.

ModelUSGov,3b128q,ryanhat,3,Thu Jun 25 02:50:10 2015 UTC,"Geez, /u/sheppio734 hasn't voted in six of the last ten senatorial votes."
ModelUSGov,3b128q,Sheppio734,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:29:39 2015 UTC,"I have been on vacation for a while, and have been unable to vote."
ModelUSGov,3b128q,yolomatic_swagmaster,2,Sun Jun 28 01:17:29 2015 UTC,"The additions of section II, sub sections IV and V address my only concern. I can now fully support this bill."
ModelUSGov,3b128q,Eilanyan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:13:51 2015 UTC,"While are platform is under construction, the American Labor Party fully supports J009 and B051.   I can't really comment on B050, given it had quad-partisan confusion.  I personally have no position on J010 but party may in the future."
ModelUSGov,3b128q,d4rkph03n1x,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:50:48 2015 UTC,"The bill is agreed to and will be sent to the President for his signature or veto.   You mean ""her""?"
ModelUSGov,3b128q,MoralLesson,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:59:51 2015 UTC,The previous question on final passage was ordered on the House Floor for JR009 New Equal Rights Amendment. The yeas stood at 10 with 7 representatives not voting.   It's strange to have that many representatives not voting.
ModelUSGov,3b128q,MoralLesson,2,Thu Jun 25 03:47:19 2015 UTC,It certainly was the first time it has happened.
ModelUSGov,3b128q,Eilanyan,0,Thu Jun 25 03:49:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would have passed if they voted either. I mean, a lot of people pointed out the problems with how it is worded."
ModelUSGov,3b128q,MoralLesson,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:50:44 2015 UTC,How would it not pass if was 10 to 7 in favour?
ModelUSGov,3b128q,Eilanyan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:00:12 2015 UTC,Joint resolutions require 2/3 to pass.
ModelUSGov,3b128q,MoralLesson,0,Thu Jun 25 04:03:59 2015 UTC,"How would it not pass if was 10 to 7 in favour?   Constitutional amendments need a two-thirds majority to pass. 17 House members x (2/3) = 11.3333 votes, which rounds up to 12. Meaning, if everyone voted, they would still need 2 more votes."
ModelUSGov,3b128q,Eilanyan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:05:13 2015 UTC,"2/7 sounds easy, and wasn't it the GLP mostly who didn't vote? It's their amendment.   EDIT: 3 GLP didn't vote. Easy supermajority."
ModelUSGov,3b128q,MoralLesson,0,Thu Jun 25 04:08:27 2015 UTC,Where did you find who did and didn't vote and how they voted?
ModelUSGov,3b128q,Eilanyan,2,Thu Jun 25 04:11:11 2015 UTC,"Spreadsheet in the Getting Started thread, is hidden in hyperlink in one of the small paragraphs before the bill list."
ModelUSGov,3b128q,MoralLesson,0,Thu Jun 25 04:13:31 2015 UTC,"I found it! Thank you! That needs to be more prominent!  Also, I'm not so sure. Out of the 7 that didn't vote, 4 are Republicans and 3 are GLA. Of the three GLA, 2 of them have not been voting much as of late."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,SeptimusSette,13,Wed Jun 24 19:06:20 2015 UTC,I welcome our comrades. Even though you inhabit social democrats I believe that you will be a good support against the right-wing parties.
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,bluefisch200,3,Wed Jun 24 19:25:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you comrade, looking forward to our debates in the future."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,ElliottC99,8,Wed Jun 24 20:12:41 2015 UTC,"At this point exactly, what would differentiate this new grouping from the Democratic Party? I'm new here, but is the Democratic incantation here significantly more moderate than its RL counterpart? Or am I missing something?"
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,jblum88,4,Wed Jun 24 19:41:04 2015 UTC,"I believe the Democrats are centrist to social democrat, American Labor is social democrat and democratic socialist, and the Green Left is socialist, communist, etc."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,jacoby531,9,Wed Jun 24 19:53:20 2015 UTC,That is accurate. American Labor intends to bridge the gap between GLP and democrats.
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,lledargo,4,Wed Jun 24 20:32:32 2015 UTC,What separates Democratic Socialists from the GL-Socialists? Do you expect GL defectors? I was under the impression that they tried to accept all forms of socialism and communism.
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,PresterJuan,10,Wed Jun 24 21:14:35 2015 UTC,"It should be said that there is a current widespread disagreement on the meaning of the word 'democratic socialist' within leftist communities and it seems to be that it's drawing the same meaning as 'social democrat' which is to me distinct and not at all in the realm of anticapitalist politics. This has gotten especially bad with the Bernie Sanders campaign, where you have social democrats identifying with a man who calls himself a socialist but has not expressed any anticapitalist interests. As a result you have democratic socialists and democratic 'socialists' that are better described as social democrats due to their support of the Nordic model and welfare capitalism over actual socialist measures and goals. We have legitimate DemSocs in the GLP, but they tend to radicalize (see /u/risen2011) and we have in the past denied membership to people who identify as DemSocs.   I see the ALP as a collection of Social Democrats (whether they identify as that or not), and actual Democratic Socialists that for whatever reason were or would be uncomfortable with the more hardline socialists in the GLP (/u/Eilanyan as an example)."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Gohte,3,Wed Jun 24 22:07:54 2015 UTC,"Ah, thanks!"
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,PresterJuan,3,Wed Jun 24 22:10:24 2015 UTC,I agree we need better terms as I find there is conflict between old school Social Democrats (reform from capitalism to socialism) and new school Social Democrats (reform capitalism with elements of socialism to make it soft and fluffy).
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Eilanyan,6,Wed Jun 24 22:13:14 2015 UTC,"I feel like both of our parties could work together on recruitment and education to make sure the right people go to the right party. Even outside of model government, it's important that the word 'socialist' doesn't get misappropriated to modern social democracy."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Gohte,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:16:16 2015 UTC,That should be your motto.  We will make capitalism soft and fluffy!
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Eilanyan,2,Thu Jun 25 01:31:54 2015 UTC,"Eh, the membership is anti-capitalist to capitalist like 7 v 1.   We could make socialism soft and fluffy and then market it in 10 different colours with 1 rare gold one randomly put into 1/1000 orders!"
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Zeria0308,3,Thu Jun 25 01:33:56 2015 UTC,"We do accept all anti-capitalists. That said, we tend to be more radical due to who makes up the party, so some leave when they realize the unevenness in terms of party makeup."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Eilanyan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:26:55 2015 UTC,Both parties accept revolutionary and reformist democratic socialists but which side is dominant differs.
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Eilanyan,5,Wed Jun 24 21:31:44 2015 UTC,As Labor Leader (sorta) AMAA about the party. I can confirm we are not going into coalition with the SNP.
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Smitty9913,3,Wed Jun 24 21:04:16 2015 UTC,Rewddit world rules say you can only be a member of one reddit world community
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Eilanyan,4,Wed Jun 24 21:37:58 2015 UTC,Can only hold one government position. You can be a member in as many as you like.

ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Smitty9913,2,Wed Jun 24 22:14:04 2015 UTC,This applies to both members of party subreddits and actual elected members.

ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Eilanyan,2,Thu Jun 25 01:20:01 2015 UTC,Good to know that

ModelUSGov,3azfyt,SolidBlues,2,Wed Jun 24 22:34:53 2015 UTC,Brilliant    I can confirm we are not going into coalition with the SNP.   Remember in US they spell things weirdly ;)   As Labour Leader
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,JerryLeRow,6,Wed Jun 24 21:10:21 2015 UTC,Remember in US they spell things the best way   FTFY ;)
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Eilanyan,4,Wed Jun 24 21:18:16 2015 UTC,At least we're not as split up as the Knesset :D  Just a formal question: Was this party a fraction of the GL before?
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,JerryLeRow,4,Wed Jun 24 19:46:09 2015 UTC,The party is mostly newcomers to sub in general. I'm only one with ties to GLP and KrabbHD is a social democrat in Model Riegstag.
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Eilanyan,2,Wed Jun 24 20:49:48 2015 UTC,Riksdag. But good to know. Thx
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Gohte,3,Wed Jun 24 20:55:37 2015 UTC,I concede german to you but I doubt you can beat my Canadian French!
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Eilanyan,3,Wed Jun 24 20:57:58 2015 UTC,That's Swedish mate.
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Gohte,3,Wed Jun 24 21:00:45 2015 UTC,Then I'm way off as he's in the Model German sub.   I was thinking of old german diet building. My bad.
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,SoSelfish,5,Wed Jun 24 21:01:25 2015 UTC,"That would be Reichstag, and they definitely don't say that one anymore.  You're thinking of Bundestag."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Oslovite,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:04:38 2015 UTC,No.
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,SoSelfish,3,Wed Jun 24 19:48:16 2015 UTC,"How many members does one need to be a ""grouping"" vs a ""party?"" And is there any benefit to being a grouping?"
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,SoSelfish,7,Wed Jun 24 19:26:10 2015 UTC,15 members makes a party. Candidates of a grouping must run as independents.
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,hippiefish,3,Wed Jun 24 19:28:42 2015 UTC,Thanks to you too!
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,ryanhat,6,Wed Jun 24 19:31:49 2015 UTC,"5 for grouping, 15 for party. Grouping gives you better advertising ability, flairs, and a subreddit."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,HammerAndPotato,2,Wed Jun 24 19:28:05 2015 UTC,Thanks! That was fast.

ModelUSGov,3azfyt,ProfessorHenn,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:08:55 2015 UTC,Still to be determined. Something along the lines of Traditionalism/Third Position/Mosleyite Fascism.
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Eilanyan,3,Fri Jun 26 19:55:36 2015 UTC,"I wholeheartedly welcome the Labor Party. We may have our differences, but I hope we may foster cooperation between the Labor and GreenLeft in order pursue a brighter future for working-class Americans."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Eilanyan,3,Thu Jun 25 01:52:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you, and I won't forget who helped start the party."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,ProfessorHenn,4,Thu Jun 25 03:10:28 2015 UTC,More and more parties. Brilliant.
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Smitty9913,3,Wed Jun 24 19:08:51 2015 UTC,"I think we will sit at seven and not really expand past that. The seventh would be the distributists.  There was once a whisper of a Muslim interests party, but the person never got back to me."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Gohte,3,Wed Jun 24 19:10:39 2015 UTC,"Still, 7 > 4 + 1 if you count Independents."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Smitty9913,2,Wed Jun 24 19:11:24 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily want more parties, I just want the entire spectrum covered, with as little overlap as possible. That being said, I love the idea of niche parties like the distributists, and would like to have more parties like them."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Gohte,3,Wed Jun 24 19:12:59 2015 UTC,Exactly. Niche parties. They're fun!
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,PresterJuan,2,Wed Jun 24 19:15:54 2015 UTC,"Using r/MHOC as model, imo we are only missing an equal to the Lib Dems (mainstream) and Pirates (niche)."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Gohte,2,Wed Jun 24 20:53:02 2015 UTC,Mhoc has 10. 10>7 and they have independents AND non-partisan (not really lol) Lords.
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,PresterJuan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:48:33 2015 UTC,Hush. :P
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,SolidBlues,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:16:42 2015 UTC,Muslim interests party? Now that would be suprizing
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,PresterJuan,3,Wed Jun 24 20:09:21 2015 UTC,I think it'd actually be pretty interesting.
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Eilanyan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:10:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, it actually would. I wonder what they would hope to get? Also we are making a bill on PACER will your party support it?"
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,PresterJuan,2,Wed Jun 24 20:15:47 2015 UTC,Also we are making a bill on PACER will your party support it?   You'd have to be more specific than that. PM me with more details if you want support.
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Eilanyan,2,Wed Jun 24 20:17:38 2015 UTC,"I wonder what their unique positions would be. I think we have somewhat of a religious appeal in the distributists, not sure if we'd diverge much."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,MoralLesson,2,Wed Jun 24 20:50:09 2015 UTC,Distributism is uniquely Catholic isn't it? I could see why an Islamic party would want to form.
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Eilanyan,3,Wed Jun 24 21:02:19 2015 UTC,"It's from Catholic tradition but there are members who aren't (/r/distributism's founder and some in that sub). I just guessed we would be the socially conservative alternative to the centrist/left parties. But I see the near Catholic majority being intimidating, it'd be cool if they started their own (or, ya know, joined us)."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,MoralLesson,2,Wed Jun 24 21:32:54 2015 UTC,Why Distributist as your name and not Christian Democracy?
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,da_drifter0912,3,Wed Jun 24 21:20:05 2015 UTC,"CD is probably broader in its meaning while also restricting us to only Christians. Most want social conservatism, but I don't think we all do. Distributism is more the economics of it all."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,ExpensiveFoodstuffs,3,Wed Jun 24 21:40:29 2015 UTC,You can be a CD and progressive on social issues. Pope Francis is basically that.
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,ElliottC99,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:42:44 2015 UTC,How so?  I think social conservatism is key when describing CD.
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Eilanyan,2,Wed Jun 24 21:57:51 2015 UTC,"Well, at minimum, there are CDINO parties in Europe."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,TheRhodan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:16:00 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize opposing abortion and same-sex ""marriage"" is now being ""progressive"" on social issues. :S"
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,PresterJuan,2,Wed Jun 24 21:49:03 2015 UTC,"Okay, but relatively he is. Atheists go to heaven, lgbtqia are not demons, etc  The CDU in Germany is not conservative on social issues."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Eilanyan,5,Wed Jun 24 21:50:57 2015 UTC,"Nah, he just gets more publicity and uses a more positive tone.   Atheists go to heaven   The fact that non-Catholics and even non-believers can go to heaven has been a doctrine of the Church for centuries, if not millenia.   lgbtqia are not demons   I mean, here is what the 2nd edition of the Catechism, as published under Pope St. John Paul II in the 1980s, has to say about homosexuality:   The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Zombones,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:57:04 2015 UTC,"More parties, more excitement."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Eilanyan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:40:10 2015 UTC,"Muslim Interest Party would be great. I'd assume that platform would be Pro-Palestine, socially conservative, and fiscally ambiguous. I'd also love to see a Modern Whig Party in the future (they exist IRL). The more parties the merrier."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Zombones,2,Fri Jun 26 03:01:54 2015 UTC,Come check us out at r/modelamericanlabor We want to offer an alternative the GLP and Democratic Party and fill the gap in between the two.
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Eilanyan,6,Wed Jun 24 20:16:03 2015 UTC,Well also provide free online snacks and beverages in our online lobby attended by online butler monkeys (out of service til 2097)
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,intel4200,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:50:48 2015 UTC,"As a ALP member, I can confirm this."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,ElliottC99,2,Fri Jun 26 07:14:11 2015 UTC,"Man, their flair is killing me. Everyone else has white text, they have burgundy surrounded by white."
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,barackoliobama69,3,Wed Jun 24 22:28:34 2015 UTC,It looks the same if you invert your browser so is white text on black background.
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Eilanyan,2,Wed Jun 24 22:37:46 2015 UTC,Can someone explain the ideological differences they have with the democrats
ModelUSGov,3azfyt,Eilanyan,3,Wed Jun 24 23:37:30 2015 UTC,"The Democrats range from social democrats to bluedogs. Our party is Social Democrat in the more classic sense (transition from capitalism to socialism through reform), though a few members are in favour of small-scale or state capitalism and capitalist soc-dem could join in future.   As an example, the Dems want to protect Worker's Rights. We want to expand them. Dems want to keep NATO, we want to reform it. Dems support a gradual increase in the minimum wage, we want it to be $15 yesterday. Dems support welfare programs, we support basic income. Dems want a two state but want to support Israel first and not say its apartheid. We see it as apartheid but do want to work with UN, Israel and Palenstine to find a solution including possible sanctions but not near what GLP would want."
ModelUSGov,3az7eb,SeptimusSette,7,Wed Jun 24 18:03:57 2015 UTC,I also find no reason for this. Surely someone more knowledgeable with the laws of the land is better to run the country than someone who runs the security of the land?
ModelUSGov,3az7eb,ProfessorHenn,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:45:51 2015 UTC,I agree with this as well. The Secretary of Homeland Security is at the end of the line of Session in our government for a reason other than it's late creation.
ModelUSGov,3az7eb,JayArrGee,6,Mon Jun 29 00:19:58 2015 UTC,I must disagree with this for the sole reason as there is no valid reason for the change. The presidential like of succession is rarely used and when it is it is not used to the extent that this would even matter.
ModelUSGov,3az7eb,JosephJCain,5,Wed Jun 24 18:55:53 2015 UTC,"Note 1: I'm trying to think through the consequences of changing the order of presidential succession. Even if the added benefit would only be relatively small, isn't that still better than what we currently have? Sure, the likelihood of having to go so far down the list is incredibly low, but we can't plan for surprises. If the change would barely change anything and make us a little safer, I have trouble seeing why we shouldn't.  Note 2: If we're figuring out how the succession should be established in the first place, I think it should range from the office with responsibilities and power closer to that of the president to offices more suited to emergency situations. If we're going so far down the list, we can't be in a good spot.  Note 3: Maybe we shouldn't touch this at all because it was decided upon as a compromise so that we don't all of a sudden start vying for different positions to be in different places in the list."
ModelUSGov,3az7eb,yolomatic_swagmaster,4,Wed Jun 24 19:39:54 2015 UTC,Note 3: Maybe we shouldn't touch this at all because it was decided upon as a compromise so that we don't all of a sudden start vying for different positions to be in different places in the list.   I tend to agree that this would open a Pandora's box of amendments jockeying for rearrangements of the line of succession. Nor do I see a particularly strong argument why DHS should jump 10 Department heads to immediately after the Attorney General. There does not seem to be a reasonable justification for this particular location for the Secretary of Homeland Security in the line of succession.
ModelUSGov,3az7eb,ModelDenizen,3,Wed Jun 24 21:01:49 2015 UTC,Agreed.
ModelUSGov,3az7eb,da_drifter0912,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:45:36 2015 UTC,Greatly agree.
ModelUSGov,3az7eb,ydoc5212,2,Sat Jun 27 05:27:40 2015 UTC,United States Code Title III Section 19
ModelUSGov,3az7eb,jacoby531,2,Wed Jun 24 18:56:36 2015 UTC,"I feel like if there was a situation where someone after the Attorney General but before the Secretary of Homeland Security had to act as President, that person would work with and take advice from the Secretary of Homeland Security anyway, making this unnecessary."
ModelUSGov,3az7eb,intrsurfer6,2,Wed Jun 24 19:48:34 2015 UTC,"I can't see any significant reason for this change. If we're using the line of succession to that extent, the government is still going to be drawing from all areas of expertise just the same.   Whoever is in the position of President will likely need the Secretary of Homeland Security as a safety net even more while tackling such an emergency scenario."
ModelUSGov,3az7eb,OldTimeyPugilist,2,Wed Jun 24 22:34:56 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't necessarily be opposed to this. I agree with the point that were something to happen that would kill off that many high-ranking members of the government, something is going wrong and Homeland Security may very well be the one to deal with it.  However, there must be strict regulations on their powers and there needs to be a time limit; perhaps one year, as well as needing to be immediately recalled by the People of they desire. I feel that this could easily be used to create a dictatorship, and that there must be provisions to prevent that."
ModelUSGov,3az7eb,oughton42,2,Wed Jun 24 22:51:32 2015 UTC,"While I'm pleased to see /u/jacoby531 didn't attempt to bump my current position back in favor of the Secretary of Homeland Security, this bill seems unnecessary.  This line of succession is rarely referred to in practice, and the people filling these positions all have the ability to lead in time of crisis.  To begin placing one before the other leads me to believe there could arise risks for impropriety in the Congress."
ModelUSGov,3az7eb,Logic_85,2,Thu Jun 25 17:06:33 2015 UTC,"I am opposed to this bill for two major reasons:  1. In the history of the United States, there has never been a case where presidency has been handed over beyond the Vice President, and therefore the chance of progression going down far enough for the eight person in line to become president is extremely unlikely.  2. The Secretary of Homeland Security is responsible primarily for defense of US borders, something that is not and is unlikely to be threatened, as such a person who is related to issues that are more prominent in the presidential position (such as the secretary of commerce), would be more suitable for the position."
ModelUSGov,3az7eb,sviridovt,2,Thu Jun 25 23:54:59 2015 UTC,I would say that the Sec. of Homeland Security is unneeded in the first place. The line of succession in fine the way it is.
ModelUSGov,3az7eb,ryanhat,4,Fri Jun 26 11:46:07 2015 UTC,"I, for one, find no reason for this. This would simply be saying that someone who specializes in security is more qualified to be the President than someone who specializes in the Interior or Commerce. However, that idea is questionable as expertise in many areas is important to the presidency. Nonetheless, even if it were true that specializing in security makes someone more qualified for the presidency, then why is the Secretary of Homeland Security being placed behind the Secretary of the Treasury?  I, for one, say that the traditional order -- based on when the agencies came into existence -- should be maintained. I would also favor the elimination of the Department of Homeland Security and the return of its agencies to their original places.  Lastly, the presidential line of succession ought to be extended beyond the cabinet. After all, most of the time, the entire cabinet (and everyone in the line of succession) is in Washington, D.C. That, in all honesty, gives us a fragile line of succession -- especially against nuclear or biological attacks. I would thus favor keeping the line of succession as is and then adding onto it the governors of the states in order of population according to the previous federal census."

I voted for /u/Those_Crazy_Reds because while I disagree pretty strongly with him on North Korea, he is a competent leader and will do a good job as a member of the CC.

All this while making no attempt to follow through with a Constituional Convention, that was set up to allow members from each party to work together to craft a new and improved Constitution.  I think the machinations of /u/SeptimusSette are clearly evident here."
ModelUSGov,3avfhn,da_drifter0912,5,Wed Jun 24 21:39:30 2015 UTC,"The previous constitution had the same provision in it about the Head Moderator. The CC was stalled because we were busy, but now that school has ended for all of us we are able to fully commit. The CC is still being used right now and all of the members have the opportunity to give their input. No matter how much members may dislike Septimus for his beliefs he has put in a lot of time into being a mod. I dislike people suggesting that this is all just a power grab. The only reason he is head mod at the moment is because he was one of the most active mods before lorts departure and 3 of the other mods left."
ModelUSGov,3avfhn,da_drifter0912,3,Tue Jun 23 23:00:39 2015 UTC,"That still doesn't justify giving a head moderator, one individual, the power to change the constitution at will at any time. The head moderator should have considerable powers to make sure the the subreddit runs smoothly, but giving that much power would make it prone to abuse.   Why should the head moderator be given the power to change the constitution at any time? Things such as the list of the parties currently involved with this subreddit shouldn't be on a constitution. That is what a guide is for. The constitution should simply outline the rules of the simulation and is it. That would make the one instance in which giving the head moderator the power to change the constitution at will, unnecessary.  That's what real life constitutions do in countries with representative governments. They do not spell out minutae nor state the current parties. They outline the rules to which everyone must follow and give the basic structure of the government.   Would the head moderator be a member of a party while in his/her role? That would give a party an extraordinary amount of power over a subreddit that is supposed to simulate the US government. You need clearly state within the constitution the neutrality of the head moderator for this to work, and make sure that person remains so.  If there are amendments to the constitution that would make destroy the nature of the r/ModelUSGOV simulation, then there could be entrenched clauses built into the constitution to prevent such a thing from happening. Then the head moderator would be empowered to ensure those clauses are not removed."

When talks stalled, because there was no order, I sent you a message addressing this and even offering suggestions for how to move forward.  However, you ignored this, as I have not received a reply to that message, (17 days and counting).  Instead you decided to make a Constitution on your own, that gives you all the power.  You never reached out to the members of the CC in order to motivate them either.  So your claims that you were frustrated with the lack of progress are resoundingly hollow.  It seems to me you were rather happy with how the process was going so you could ramrod your own version through."

It is also a compromise in that it changes nothing drastic about our electoral college except in the format in which we vote. At the end of the day, it will still be the electoral college that votes in our president.   I have also accounted for any possible ties in the bill.

ModelUSGov,3ar2mq,Epic_Mile,4,Tue Jun 23 16:19:33 2015 UTC,At first look this seems to be pretty solid and well written. Are the moderators willing to implement this as well?
ModelUSGov,3ar2mq,Logic_85,3,Mon Jun 22 20:55:15 2015 UTC,yes.
ModelUSGov,3ar2mq,Epic_Mile,5,Mon Jun 22 21:24:54 2015 UTC,"So this is a good change, one that we need. If you haven't, I encourage people to watch this video by C.G.P.Grey explaining the system.  FPTP is just a bad system. It forces voters to choose between a candidate they agree with 90% of the time but who has a 40% chance of winning versus one they agree with 65% of the time, but has a 75% chance of winning, all to prevent the candidate they don't want from winning. We can give people the chance to vote honestly and not strategically, and while elections still may not turn out differently, we can get numbers the numbers and the votes to shift the conversation towards how the electorate really believes, and not how the system wants it to be."
ModelUSGov,3ar2mq,Logic_85,4,Tue Jun 23 00:04:31 2015 UTC,"Section II:  ...  Sub Section IV: A voter is required to fill out the ballot with at least one candidate ranked. They may fill out the ballot ranking as many candidates as they would like.   Sub Section V: If all of a voter's candidates have been eliminated their ballot shall be considered an ""exhausted ballot."" An exhausted ballot shall not be considered a part of the total number of votes.    Proposed amendment in order to allow voters to rank a minimum of one candidate, but fill out only as many as they would like. Sub Section V is just explaining what must be done with a ballot if all the candidates chosen on it have been eliminated. Their ballot is no longer considered a part of the total number of votes in further rounds. This is so that a majority may be obtained.   For example: Lets say there are three candidates. A gets 45% of the vote, B gets 35% and C gets 30%. C gets eliminated and the votes are once again distributed. However, many of the people who voted for C gave no other option and therefore their ballot is considered ""exhausted."" In the second round (where C is eliminated) A has 48.5%, B has 47% and exhausted ballots make up the rest. Candidate ""A"" must be the winner since there is nobody else to eliminate, yet they do not technically have a majority. Therefore exhausted ballots are removed so that A can be officially declared the winner. It is more of a technicality than anything else."
ModelUSGov,3ar2mq,yolomatic_swagmaster,2,Tue Jun 23 21:57:56 2015 UTC,"A good example is as follows  1st round: 1000 votes total  A: 400 votes  B: 350 votes  C: 250 votes  C gets eliminated.  50 of the voters for C did not provide a #2.  50 of the voters provided A as their #2, and 150 provided B as their #2.  Round 2: 950 votes total (subtracting the 50 exhausted votes)  A: 450 votes  B: 500 votes  A has 450/950, B has 500/950 (a majority) and wins."

ModelUSGov,3ar2mq,yolomatic_swagmaster,4,Tue Jun 23 22:35:50 2015 UTC,"The only issue I have with this is that I have to rank every candidate on the ballot as opposed to only choosing those candidates I actually support. If the bill could be amended to let me stop when I want to, I'd be completely for it."
ModelUSGov,3ar2mq,OldTimeyPugilist,3,Tue Jun 23 01:10:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. I feel there comes a point, after candidate #2 or #3, that I stop caring, and can't rank anyone else. It's not a deal breaker for me, but I think that part should be amended."
ModelUSGov,3ar2mq,bluefisch200,2,Tue Jun 23 04:14:17 2015 UTC,"Actually, now that you mention it, the caring is really important for elections with more than a few candidates. Imagine having to fill out the ballot completely. You know for sure who you want, so you rank them easily, then mark the lesser of two evils, and then see a few more you don't recognize. Because you don't know who they, you just fill out whatever, perhaps unintentionally aiding a candidate you would dislike more than your typical rival. It might be too far down the list to matter, but this misplaced support depends on the amount of candidates and the interest of the voter."

Sure, I could have voted for someone else for #3, #4, etc, but I have the choice of not doing so.  If 1000 people vote for #1 and he goes out, then my second choice gives #2 only 1500 votes and he goes out, then the next round of calculations will have one less vote in the system to account for - mine.  I still get to see that I voted (seeing the totals for both #1 and #2) and know that I voiced my opinion.    I think a lot of people would likely only give one choice in an election (especially dem vs republican) and forcing them to put a ""#2"" next to someone they don't like is going to deter voting altogether."

I don't see any reason why people HAVE to place candidates in order from best to least--especially when it is hard enough to get one good candidate out there in the first place."

ModelUSGov,3ar2mq,Epic_Mile,2,Fri Jun 26 12:34:37 2015 UTC,The bill seems to me to be well thought out. The Implementing of the Runoff Voting would fix many situations we currently have.   I think that we should implement a system that requires a certain number of voters in order for a legislation to pass or and election to be viable. We are having too many people elected by too small a group of people.
ModelUSGov,3ar2mq,SoSelfish,3,Mon Jun 22 22:20:44 2015 UTC,"Another potential outcome of this amendment being passed is higher voter turnout. Since new parties have a greater chance of being heard, people may be more inclined to vote since they may finally find a party that properly represents their view. In real life, I think the Libertarian Party is a party that many people agree with, but most people do not vote for since they know they will never win. In IRV many people may decide to put the Libertarians as their first choice and then Rep/Dem as their second choice."

ModelUSGov,3amck2,ExpiredAlphabits,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:41:06 2015 UTC,Outlawing organizations eliminates incentives for these companies to improve their behavior. Should you be interested in this path I would recommend considering creating a program in which private military contractors would face momentary penalties and reduced contract workload until behavior improves. This is a very ham-fisted approach to the problem of Private Military Contractors.  There is also the problem of shell companies being used in order to redirect contacts back to the listed PMCs.
ModelUSGov,3amck2,ModelDenizen,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:20:51 2015 UTC,"There are a number of other loopholes such as shell companies being used in order to rediect contracts back to the PMCs that are explicitly named in this bill. Also, if you read Section 3 you will see that all money from these contracts goes back to the DoD so there is not even much flexibility there - since I imagine eliminating these contracts will have financial penalties (early termination of contracts) and leave strategic holes in our defense and foreign policy. I think this potentially a catastrophic mistake."
ModelUSGov,3amck2,ModelDenizen,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:44:29 2015 UTC,"Yes that is true that we may have to wait out the contracts to avoid breaking any early termination   That language is not currently in the legislation so that would need to change.   if you were to cut off any affiliation or future deals with these types of companies it would solve the problem   So you want to ban the DoD from contracting out to / working with any company that has been 'affiliated' with PMCs? Or this 'type' of company? Are you effectively suggesting we outlaw private military corporations overall?   And yes the money would go to the DoD and I trust them to filling the gap of these companies leaving the US's side.

Fascism in all of its forms are contrary to the forces that promote the freedom of the individual. We are not governed by people, corporations, or governments. We are governed by laws. A stronger, more powerful government will be able to accomplish its will more fully, there is no debate about that. However, government should not serve to carry out the will of a person, corporation, or even itself, as contradictory as it might sound. It serves to protect the rights of each individual, and in our republic it does so through writing laws.   Even if the members of other parties cannot identify with my rhetoric, I hope we can stand together against this new wave of fascism that threatens our great nation."

ModelUSGov,3agu23,ThatAssholeYahweh,12,Sat Jun 20 02:24:58 2015 UTC,democratic fascist   These words are contradictory.
ModelUSGov,3agu23,ThatAssholeYahweh,9,Sat Jun 20 02:33:21 2015 UTC,"This is so true. If you use the google dictionary and search fascism, the entry is:   ""an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization.  synonyms:   authoritarianism, totalitarianism, dictatorship, despotism, autocracy; Nazism, rightism; nationalism, xenophobia, racism, anti-Semitism; jingoism, isolationism; neofascism, neo-Nazism ""a film depicting the rise of fascism in the 1930s""  (in general use) extreme right-wing, authoritarian, or intolerant views or practice.""  Fascism is incompatible with democracy."
ModelUSGov,3agu23,Eilanyan,3,Sat Jun 20 03:01:26 2015 UTC,"Could you go in to more detail on this?  What sort of hierarchies would you like to establish, if not racial ones?  What does fascism mean to you, in the context of achievable policy in /r/ModelUSGov?"
ModelUSGov,3agu23,ThatAssholeYahweh,4,Sat Jun 20 03:18:58 2015 UTC,"To make this abundantly clear: fascism in and of itself does not entail racism of any form. Nazism does. Fascism emphasizes a national rejuvenation, along with nationalism and collectivism. As well, a corporatist system is advocated for, where a corporation (group of people authorized to act as a single entity and recognized as such in law.) can collectively bargain with other corporations in order to reach common ground. Such systems are seen in Sweden, the Netherlands, and Germany. Fascist corporatism is essentially corporatism, except corporations are expected to act in the nation's interests--if not, they're liquidated and their associated industries are nationalized.  Nazism puts a racial spin on the whole ""national rejuvenation"" thing. I, personally, do not agree with nazism, as any person with adequate knowledge of biology should. Also, for those claiming that democracy is incompatible with fascism, stop. Speaking to my former socialist comrades, you should recognize that there's more than just bourgeois democracy. Do you not advocate for the abolishment of it, to be replaced by a True Democratic SystemTM ?  To quote from Wikipedia:   In the fascist and quasi-fascist regimes that governed Italy, Romania, and Spain from the 1920s to the 1970s, authoritarian democracy was promoted as an alternative to liberal democracy, multi-party based democracy was dismantled and replaced by corporatist representation of state-sanctioned corporate groups that would unite people into interest groups to address the state that would act in the interest of the general will of the nation and thus exercise an orderly form of popular rule. Italian Fascists argued that this authoritarian democracy is capable of representing the different interests of society that advise the state and the state acts in the interest of the nation. In contrast, fascists denounced liberal democracy for not being a true democracy but in fact being un-democratic because from the fascist perspective, elections and parliaments are unable to represent the interests of the nation because it lumps together individuals who have little in common into geographical districts to vote for an array of parties to represent them that results in little unanimity in terms of interests, projects, or intentions, and that liberal democracy's multi-party elections merely serve as a means to legitimize elite rule without addressing the interests of the general will of the nation.   Now, of course this is all the ideal situation (i.e. theoretical) and as shown in Italy and Nazi Germany, militaristic elements, which already composed the government, pretty much ignored those who spoke against them.  Personally, I'd describe myself as a constitutional fascist. I believe that a central authority, not necessarily an individual--though it could be--, should be restricted to a certain point (i.e. no discrimination against ethnic groups, imprisonment without just cause, etc.). As well, there should be ways to remove said individual/group of individuals from power, should they be acting against the interests of the nation.  If anyone has any questions they'd like to ask, feel free."
ModelUSGov,3agu23,BradlyDavison,11,Sat Jun 20 03:21:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have a question: weren't you a market socialist a few weeks ago? What on earth happened?"
ModelUSGov,3agu23,ExpiredAlphabits,4,Sat Jun 20 03:23:27 2015 UTC,"Indeed. I expanded my reading, and thought about what I consider important, feasible, etc. I decided that fascism made sense to me. Though, as I've made clear, I'm not a jingoist hell-bent on military conquest or other such nonsense, nor do I believe in the superiority of certain races.  As well, the one thing I have qualms with, within fascism, is the emphasis on emotion and feelings. I disagree with such notions. One should not base a world view on sudden outbursts of emotion, as Mussolini and Hitler did."
ModelUSGov,3agu23,ThatAssholeYahweh,6,Sat Jun 20 03:24:07 2015 UTC,How would you treat the current multinational corporations? They almost never act in the US's interests but have legal protection against takeovers by the state.
ModelUSGov,3agu23,ExpiredAlphabits,3,Sun Jun 21 02:23:29 2015 UTC,"That's a bit of a grey area. To make this clear though, corporation refers to more than just an actual business. In this case it does refer to a business, but in other situations it may not.    have legal protection against takeovers by the state.   Eh, I assume you're referring to international law? In cases such as these I doubt one could just outright nationalize said company. The key thing to remember, though, is that these corporations are ran by people. These people can be persuaded to aid the state. The United States is already the world's leading economic power, so I doubt it'd be too difficult to encourage this.    They almost never act in the US's interests   I wouldn't say that. Outsourcing is a net positive over time, and actually leads to worker allocation in areas that the United States is more suited for (look up research by the OECD or NBER for examples). I can't really think of a corporation that actively acts against the United States' interests, to be honest.  Also, to elaborate on my views above:  I'm not militaristic. Military service, I believe, should be encouraged, if not required for a certain period of time (a draft of sorts, but one can also provide non-military service in a works program, if they so wish), but I'm relatively non-interventionist.   Essentially, I believe in the ethos of ""Liberty in private, obligation in public"". One's thoughts, feelings, or opinions should not be restricted in private, nor should people be ostracized for their ethnicity or sexual orientation. But in return for these freedoms, citizens should provide service to the government, and put it before themselves in public settings. This should be logical, as the state does provide services to the public (or at least should)--education, sanitation, transportation, etc."

ModelUSGov,3agu23,ExpiredAlphabits,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:29:05 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to honestly understand what your opinion is, and would appreciate correction here. Is it that your party believes the state should have leaders, democratically elected, who hold full power over third party corporations? Do those leaders also hold full power over speech, press, and private affairs?"
ModelUSGov,3agu23,ThatAssholeYahweh,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:43:13 2015 UTC,"Is it that your party believes the state should have leaders, democratically elected, who hold full power over third party corporations? Do those leaders also hold full power over speech, press, and private affairs?   We are a blanket fascist party, so this is going to vary by the individual. Now, I personally advocate for what is mentioned above: authoritarian democracy. I favor a strong executive with nearly unlimited powers, but still bound by a constitution and elected democratically by party members. In regards to the whole ""third party corporations"" there is no distinction, really, between the state and industry within fascism. Private and public industries are expected to serve the state, and institutions that act against the state are nationalized. This doesn't just apply to businesses, but what we'd call interest groups. For instance, let's say we're looking at the educational system. As many know, there are various teacher unions in different regions, each with their own set of rules, etc. Within a fascist state, these teacher unions would be effectively ""nationalized"". There may be a Primary Education Corporation, comprised of primary school teachers, etc. Whenever you hear us say corporation, and we aren't talking about a business, just think of it as a state-sanctioned union. The government, ideally, will listen to these various corporations to guide their decision making.  Feel free to ask for more clarification."
ModelUSGov,3agu23,ExpiredAlphabits,2,Sat Jun 20 03:13:39 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot of sense, and under a benevolent ruler, it would work superbly . How would your system prevent corruption?

Democratic elections can be easily fixed or nullified, so how would the few at the top be prevented from taking advantage of the many at the bottom?   Frequent plebiscites I think would do the trick. A bi-annual or tri-annual plebiscite would be held. Now, in my mind, the government would be comprised of representatives from the various interest groups, and during the bi-annual/tri-annual plebiscite the members of these various interest groups (i.e. corporations) would essentially have a vote of confidence in their leader, and there would also be a plebiscite among the members of the party currently in power, to decide if the nation's leader shall be kept. Obviously, if the leader has committed criminal actions or has otherwise engaged in unacceptable conduct, I see no problem with corporations holding an emergency plebiscite to remove their leader.  As well, by encouraging class collaboration and emphasizing service to the government, I would think that incidences of corruption would be reduced--who would want to be socially ostracized as a traitor to not only their nation, but their fellow citizens? Further, I have no qualms with mass surveillance or spying, but any spying targeted at a specific citizen should only be allowed with a warrant."

ModelUSGov,3agu23,HolaHelloSalutNiHao,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:12:20 2015 UTC,"Well, in the case of the entire government being downright corrupt and operating against the interests of the people, then I would assume that another emergency plebiscite would be held. Perhaps during this emergency plebiscite, government officials/party members are placed under temporary detainment until the plebiscite is over. Perhaps a super majority should be required to completely dismiss the entire government, with a simple majority dismissing only the president and his ministers/cabinet?"

No, you've gotten it mixed up a bit. The corporations only have advisory power. They can't force the leader to do something, they voice their needs, and they can collectively bargain with their employers (e.g. Oil Worker's Corporation bargains with Exxon Mobile over acceptable wages, while the government mediates) As well, elections would be restricted to a single party or, at the very least, parties who differ incredibly little and who are all fascist, by and large. Now, obviously, if model fascists were ever to gain enough power to win the presidency, etc. (which I don't think would ever happen) I wouldn't support such measures since it would mess up this whole simulation.   A system where corporations are owned by a democratically elected governing body is called a Socialist Republic.   You're mixing up the definitions. Corporations, in this sense, aren't referring to businesses, but groups of people who share a common interest, a job, etc. Private ownership of the means of production would be allowed and encouraged, so long as it serves the state, unlike in a socialist government.   You, sir, are not a Fascist; you're a Socialist. Quit this Fascist Party nonsense and go back to the GLP.   Nonsense. Socialism is firmly in the internationalism and worker solidarity camp. I'm a nationalist, along with being supportive of rather restrictive measures in terms of civil ""rights"". As well, I've already pointed out that I'm in favor of a leader with near unlimited power, and there's my whole belief about how citizens should volunteer in the military or a works program after they graduate college.

ModelUSGov,3agu23,Danotto94,7,Sat Jun 20 20:21:13 2015 UTC,"true, but that detracts from the main point I was making. The system of Capitalism first appeared as a more efficient system of bartering, in which currency (whether in seashells, rocks, or salt, or gold) were exchanged in lieu of only bartering and trading with items, as this took away from the inequality that many bartering trades had. Rudimentary Capitalism is thousands if not tens of thousands of years old. This is my point. I say this of course, with salutations to the more rational socialist members of the GLP."

This person then has the potential to either lose his currency or gain more and have more goods to give to others, buy more goods, or pass down to his heirs. And ta-da, capitalism."
ModelUSGov,3agu23,Libertarian-Party,11,Sat Jun 20 20:38:29 2015 UTC,Capitalism means private ownership of the means of production. That has nothing to do with free-markets that can be just for trading personal property. Do you know what the difference between private & personal property is?
ModelUSGov,3agu23,BradlyDavison,3,Sat Jun 20 15:49:00 2015 UTC,"so you're telling me the GLP and communists don't want to affect the personal property and assets of a person? Personal property also includes businesses and corporate shares. For many, this is worth more than anything they have.  The fact that the means of the production is now controlled by a monopolistic union instead of board of trustees takes away these ""personal"" assets for people."
ModelUSGov,3agu23,sad_pat_buchanan,8,Sat Jun 20 15:55:01 2015 UTC,If those assets were obtained through stealing surplus value then IMO they should be confiscated.

I just hate the fact that under communism there's no chance to truly thrive financially and buy the goods we want, etc.   Wages increased significantly for workers in the Soviet Union and Albania in the period when those two countries were socialist; prices of goods in turn decreased. As a result workers had greater purchasing power, not less. Hence this assertion has historically been proven false.   And yes, I agree that hate speech should not be allowed, but their opinions in general should be.   How exactly do the opinions and speech differ?

Take college professors: college is supposed to be a place where a student's beliefs and values are questioned; obviously, a non-white, non-cisgendered, or queer professor is going to offer their students a different viewpoint than a white, straight cisgendered professor.

While there are minor things that a cisgendered professor might have in common with his or her cisgendered students, a persons individual identity is made up of much more than the social construct of a gender identity as a whole. For example; I have a short temper, am tall, and have traveled throughout southeast Asia. I am also cisgendered. Bob on the other hand is cisgendered, struggles with dwarfism, is a born again Christian, but has never left California his whole life. We both identify as the gender we were assigned at birth, but bring vastly different life experiences to the table. It is very unlikely that students will encounter a professor who has significantly similar life experiences even within their own gender identity.

ModelUSGov,3aen43,Logic_85,4,Fri Jun 19 19:04:28 2015 UTC,"Here is the wording from a similar bill proposed in 1975:   This bill would have prohibited discrimination on the basis of  ""affectional or sexual preference,” which the bill defined as having or manifesting an emotional or physical attachment to another consenting person or persons of either gender, or having or manifesting a preference for such attachment.    Would wording along these lines be better?  I have to note that Title VII refers to employment, and an employer can still refuse to hire someone based upon criminal history in a background check, such as pedophilia or incest, so this bill would not require hiring of such, as it is presently worded."
ModelUSGov,3aen43,schultejt,5,Fri Jun 19 19:11:39 2015 UTC,"That sounds better, and just because someone is committing one of those acts doesn't necessarily mean that they have a criminal record."

A person can claim ""innate bias"" descrimination and it is simply he said/she said. There are a million different what-if situtations where someone could claim identity bias without the bias present. The courts would simply have to accept their word they identify as they claim. The alternative would be to require those claims to be registered ahead of time, which is an untenable position.

If a woman wants to be a man but is born a woman, more power to them. Fortunately for lawmakers and enforcers, you can generally see the fruits of ones preferred gender sometimes physically, but also in ones expression of their gender. Unfortunately, there is a vocal minority of people who discredit the trans community by pretending their genders are ""too complex to understand"" or ""deanfromsupernaturalgender."" Under this law, people would be able to claim their rights are violated when they get fired for making car sounds at customers when they call themselves ""autogendered.""

What you internally identify as cannot be."

ModelUSGov,3aen43,scotladd,2,Sat Jun 20 07:26:55 2015 UTC,"The issue at hand is really the addition of the word ""internal"" to federal law. Unless I am mistaken, there are only about a dozen states with existing laws such as this and I only know of one case (Smith v City of Salem) where any court has provided precedence. We arent codifying the law, we are taking provisions supported by less than 1/3 of the states and instantly expanding them to all states by making them federal law."
ModelUSGov,3aen43,Logic_85,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:47:58 2015 UTC,"The EEOC enforces the provisions of Title VII. The EEOC has its own court (administrative law court) and applies the law of title vii to cases nationwide. All states are subject to title vii.   Under this power, they have ruled that title vii extends its protection to people discriminated against for sexual preference or status as a transgendered person. This is federal law we are dealing with, not state law. We are codifying the rulings of the EEOC (a federal administrative body) into the law they enforce.  State law has absolutely nothing to do with it."
ModelUSGov,3aen43,scotladd,2,Sat Jun 20 18:48:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you are adding ""internal"" to the wording. Which, unless i am mistaken is not currently within the scope of the EEOC to enforce. I am concerned by simply adding the word, and not specifying how internal identity is definitively proven, demonstrated or tested for, the bill is problematic at best. I am also concerned that if the definition as to what qualifies for internal identity is left up to the EEOC, then a list may be created. Requiring protected classes, or leaving protected classes open to future requirement to declare is a dangerous thing."

ModelUSGov,3aen43,ConquerorWM,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:26:37 2015 UTC,"If they don't identify as such publicly then they wouldn't be discriminated against for it, unless people just assume their gender identity or sexual orientation."

The EEOC has ruled that employers cannot discriminate based upon sexual orientation or gender identity, but application of these rules across all applicable employment situations is still tenuous and uneven.  Codifying these rulings will bring stability to this area of employment law and guarantee the absolute right to be free from discrimination for what we understand to be innate characteristics, such as gender identity or sexual orientation."

ModelUSGov,3aen43,jelvinjs7,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:25:33 2015 UTC,"Overall I like these amendments, and the ideas behind them. Though, as others have mentioned the wording is a bit broad. Why don't you add a section saying that, ""The term gender identity or sexual orientation does not include a mindset that makes the person preform acts that are non consensual, include minors under the age of consent, or that include one partner that is currently not allowed to preform such actions based on relation to the other.""

ModelUSGov,3aen43,jelvinjs7,2,Sat Jun 20 04:34:38 2015 UTC,That is the reasoning for the broad definitions. I wanted to avoid listing 100 different gender/non-gender assignments and just use gender identity as a broad category.

ModelUSGov,3aen43,Sheppio734,3,Sun Jun 21 04:29:51 2015 UTC,"I wanted to piggyback and say a couple things:  What locosherman1 said about the words ""transsexual"" and ""transgender"" is right. Just to not leave this out though: the word ""transsexual"" is not appropriate for most conversations. It is seen as offensive, due to being overly clinical, and for having been used as a pejorative in the past. In the midst of legal wording, I think it just comes off as duly clinical and not necessarily offensive.  Suffice it to say, the LGBT community strongly prefers the word transgender. You can say ""transition"" or ""surgery"" to indicate steps taken to physically transition from one sex to another. There has to be a compelling case to use the word transsexual, and I think adding to this bill for the goal of protecting rights can be seen as important enough of a reason.  Also, ""queer"" can be used as a person's orientation when lesbian, gay, or bisexual don't fit. For example, someone who is exclusively gay/lesbian, except falls in love with a specific person of the opposite sex. Or someone who is consistently attracted to the opposite sex, but only sometimes attracted to the same sex. These people might not feel the label ""bisexual"" applies, but that ""queer,"" being broader and more inclusive, does apply. It can also be used as an alternative word for any of lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual or transgender, due to being inclusive of any and all of them."

ModelUSGov,3aen43,Jkevo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:22:02 2015 UTC,"I see some people here using pedophile in the wrong sense;  Pedophile  noun  a person who is sexually attracted to children.  A pedophile is not someone who will be having intercourse with children, that would be a molester and a molester of course does not fall under sexual orientation and gender identity. Just like straight, gay, bi, or any other orientation a pedophile does not chose to be attracted to children. Therefore should not be discriminated against while being hired for a job. But these people do have the choice to act on these feelings and attractions just like any other human. If they choose to do so they then cross the line to being a molester where they should be in prison not getting a job. Because of this I support this bill because it will give more protection over minorities including pedophiles, people should not discriminate pedophiles because they are just normal people and they should be seen as that. We are all normal until we act on a bad thought."

ModelUSGov,3a68h8,Logic_85,7,Thu Jun 25 17:22:09 2015 UTC,"Or be subjected to segregation or discrimination    By whom? Private individuals or the government? I firmly believe that we should treat people as individuals, and equal protection under the law is crucial for that (i.e. a white person and a black person should both get treated equally by the government).   Where this law loses me is the implication that nobody anywhere shall discriminate. This is subjective, unenforceable, and, ironically, a gross infringement on the rights of all Americans. Will employers be forced to hire those who are mentally disabled to the detriment of their business? Will participants in the marketplace be compelled to conduct business with those they personally find reprehensible? Am I, as an individual, responsible for making sure others around me are ""enjoying"" their rights? How does one quantify ""enjoyment""?   The problem this bill seeks to rectify can easily be solved in the free market without the government pointing a gun at anyone's head. Take the business in Indiana that refused to participate in something they found reprehensible (a gay wedding), and how they got inundated with bad ratings on Yelp. If the public took issue with that business' stance, then not only will people freely choose to conduct business elsewhere, but also a new demand arises, and a new profit exists to be won.   It is misguided, impractical, and morally wrong to try to name all of the untouchable aspects of individuals that must be accepted. Live and let live."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,HIPSTER_SLOTH,11,Fri Jun 19 19:44:27 2015 UTC,I don't see why anyone would/should vote against this.
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,ehbrums1,2,Wed Jun 17 15:35:24 2015 UTC,Agreed. There's no reason it shouldn't pass.
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,barackoliobama69,5,Wed Jun 17 15:49:50 2015 UTC,Filibustering...?!
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,bluefisch200,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:23:47 2015 UTC,What I meant to convey was: there's no reason for anyone to oppose this. Not that people wouldn't.
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,barackoliobama69,2,Wed Jun 17 16:52:49 2015 UTC,I know... it was more of a joke because that is what Smitty usually says.
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,bluefisch200,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:56:52 2015 UTC,It's a solid proposal. I predict it will be passed unanimously; I see no real argument other than some tricky wording but that can be easily amended.

ModelUSGov,3a68h8,Logic_85,2,Wed Jun 17 16:16:14 2015 UTC,I was one of the main writers of this and would look favorably on amending this to read as you suggest.

ModelUSGov,3a68h8,Danotto94,2,Wed Jun 17 21:49:35 2015 UTC,"Using ""religion, absence of religion..."" would cover that just as broad as including ""type of religion."""
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,Logic_85,2,Wed Jun 17 22:21:37 2015 UTC,I don't think agnosticism/atheism are types of religions though but ok.

ModelUSGov,3a68h8,KlingonLinux,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:51:46 2015 UTC,Also fine.
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,Danotto94,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:54:42 2015 UTC,The Supreme Court has ruled otherwise.
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,Logic_85,0,Thu Jun 18 06:14:12 2015 UTC,agnosticism/atheism are types of religions    I would argue they are.
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,MoralLesson,4,Sat Jun 20 17:39:23 2015 UTC,"I have a problem with the statement ""No person shall be subjected to segregation because of mental health."" My concern is that this is similar to mainstreaming , where mentally challenged children are placed in regular classrooms. It causes too much damage. The teachers aren't equipped to give the mentally challenged students the attention they need and the education of healthy students is sacrificed. If the amendment is altered to remove constitutional enforcement of mainstreaming, I can support it."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,ExpiredAlphabits,2,Wed Jun 17 19:13:55 2015 UTC,Mainstreaming is a product of underfunding. This bill isn't going to force mentally deficient students into classrooms of students with more developed mental capacities.
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,ehbrums1,3,Wed Jun 17 19:42:11 2015 UTC,"The text ends segregation. As it reads, it's too easy to interpret that as ending segregation of classes based on mental health. I would be happy if this came with a preamble that specifically stated that mainstreaming is not the intention."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,ExpiredAlphabits,4,Wed Jun 17 21:18:07 2015 UTC,"At this point, I think it's more than clear that this amendment needs to be rephrased in multiple ways."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,barackoliobama69,2,Wed Jun 17 22:56:36 2015 UTC,True.
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,ExpiredAlphabits,3,Thu Jun 18 03:10:36 2015 UTC,Does this mean those who are here illegally will not be denied equal protection of the law?
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,Lukeran,5,Wed Jun 17 16:31:25 2015 UTC,"The way the law is now they are not be denied equal treatment of the law - but that doesn't mean they are not subject to the law, which often prescribes deportation."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,Logic_85,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:37:19 2015 UTC,"The language could be a little clearer on this. There should be a difference between how we treat people in general, people who are here legally, and citizens. Obviously this distinction shouldn't be used to discriminate against someone's basic humanity."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,yolomatic_swagmaster,4,Wed Jun 17 16:49:18 2015 UTC,"I don't see the need for a distinction. I think this amendment was meant to protect all people from discrimination in matters of law, not to change the way the law applies to certain people."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,barackoliobama69,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:08:10 2015 UTC,"I know the word ""discrimination"" has a certain connotation to it, but I mean in this in a much smaller sense. For example, an Italian doesn't have the right to vote in our democracy, but should she be associated with criminal activity, she should have the right to a lawyer and due process. In any case, the minor differences should be established with careful attention to abuse. Edit: Grammar."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,yolomatic_swagmaster,3,Wed Jun 17 17:17:56 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from, but nothing in this bill gives non-US citizens the right to vote. All it says is that people are to be equally protected under the law, and I don't think it should matter enough to make a distinction whether that person is a citizen."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,barackoliobama69,2,Wed Jun 17 17:25:00 2015 UTC,"If ""protection under the law"" implies protecting one's rights, then there should be a definition of who has what rights. This amendment doesn't even describe citizenship as a prerequisite to such protection. If you are a citizen, you should get equal protection under the law despite any of the mentioned qualities. If you aren't a citizen, you still shouldn't be discriminated against, but you certainly don't have rights to as much as citizens would. You would exist under a different legal category, but that category should in no way erode the strict justice we maintain for citizenship."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,yolomatic_swagmaster,3,Wed Jun 17 17:39:29 2015 UTC,"I vehemently disagree. All people should have the basic rights defined in the Bill of Rights. The right to participate in our government is another matter, but this bill isn't meant to affect how that right applies to non-US citizens."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,barackoliobama69,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:45:26 2015 UTC,"Hmm. You know what? I agree. All people should have the basic rights defined by the Bill of Rights. This might be a discussion for lower levels of government, or maybe even a political philosophy to just be aware of, but in as far as this amendment deals with the broadest sense of what people can and cannot do in our country, I think you're right.  Edit: Wait. Is ""equal protection under the law"" limited to the Bill of Rights?"
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,yolomatic_swagmaster,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:55:30 2015 UTC,"I doubt it, but this is another place where more clear wording would be nice."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,barackoliobama69,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:46:04 2015 UTC,"In that case, I agree up to the Bill of Rights. Everything else is a bit hazy."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,yolomatic_swagmaster,2,Wed Jun 17 19:21:52 2015 UTC,I agree with you.
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,Lukeran,2,Wed Jun 17 17:49:46 2015 UTC,The other things in the bill of rights don't seem to draw a distinction between citizens and non citizens. I don't see the need for this one too.
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,rangerheart0,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:29:15 2015 UTC,"That's true. Is it an implicit understanding, or is it just ironed out in regular old legislation? I still think it's a loophole that should be dealt with, but maybe it isn't big enough of an issue to cement in the constitution."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,yolomatic_swagmaster,3,Wed Jun 17 17:45:44 2015 UTC,As some of the others have pointed out a bit of it is worded a little awkardly. Otherwise this is a fantastic amendment. Also maybe we should add economic status to the list.
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,rangerheart0,2,Wed Jun 17 17:27:09 2015 UTC,If you could get easier to understand and better worded that would be good.
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,Smitty9913,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:44:50 2015 UTC,"Including economic status opens the door too much on welfare issues, but otherwise this is a strong amendment."

Why do you include ""enjoyment""?  I find this law vague at best, and at purposefully misleading at worst.  Besides the general problem that this law will be used to force employers to "" diversify"" their workforce, it is not very well written and neither will it accomplish it's purported goal."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,lsma,7,Wed Jun 17 17:05:01 2015 UTC,"force employers to "" diversify"" their workforce   I don't think it will force diversification any more than the current status quo - all it does is ensure that people aren't denied their rights on the basis of these basic elements.  If employers don't want to hire someone because they are a bad worker, employers still have that right.  Although I do agree that the language you pointed to is ill-phrased.  Perhaps you could propose an amendment?"
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,Logic_85,2,Wed Jun 17 17:18:20 2015 UTC,"The Bill of Rights already guarantees its rights to everyone.  Rights are, by definition, applied to every citizen equally.  If someone is being denied their freedom of speech, it doesn't matter why, it is still against the law.  You are going to be prosecuted for trampling on peoples' rights regardless of why you did it, be it because of their race, creed, or the cut of their jib."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,lsma,5,Wed Jun 17 17:31:07 2015 UTC,"But their isn't really an anti-discrimination right listed in the bill of rights. There's free speech and religion and whatnot, but that's a bit different. I think this amendment is unique enough to be considered."

ModelUSGov,3a68h8,lsma,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:44:07 2015 UTC,"I see. In that case, I agree that the language should be more clear. I assumed this amendment would prevent discrimination when it comes to jobs and such. I think that kind of thing should be added to this amendment."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,barackoliobama69,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:49:52 2015 UTC,"The next bill addresses discrimination in employment.  That isn't exactly an issue for an amendment to the Constitution to address, since employment is a private affair, not specifically under the umbrella of Constitutional issues."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,Logic_85,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:30:25 2015 UTC,Okay. I was unaware of the next bill.
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,barackoliobama69,5,Wed Jun 17 20:41:21 2015 UTC,I don't quite see how this amendment would lead to diversification in the workforce.
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,yolomatic_swagmaster,2,Wed Jun 17 17:42:27 2015 UTC,May I ask why you think it will not accomplish its goal?
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,rangerheart0,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:26:32 2015 UTC,"Because it's goal is already accomplished.  Rights already apply to everyone equally.  That's what makes them rights.  It is like making a law that forbids the robbery of convenience stores.  Sure, is a great sentiment, but robbery is already against the law, so this isn't really, adding anything.  This law is just a throw away, a big sign that says ""we are the GLP and we love minorities,"" while not actually changing anything.  It is pure politics."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,lsma,5,Wed Jun 17 17:37:32 2015 UTC,"It seems like we are on the same page that people have a right not to be discriminated against. However discrimination for many of the groups protected under this amendment is not disallowed by the constitution, and in many states as well as federally is not disallowed through legislation. This amendment both constitutionally disallows that discrimination, and allows congress to pursue legislation to disallow it.   There is also the issue of many minorities not enjoying equality in many different respects. It is appropriate in this regard to pursue legislation to rectify that."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,rangerheart0,2,Wed Jun 17 17:49:29 2015 UTC,"Are you saying that private companies shouldn't be allowed to hire/fire who they please, regardless of their reasoning?   The bill's wording is very vague, so it's hard to tell."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,thmsm,2,Wed Jun 17 23:46:42 2015 UTC,"The bills wording is very vague because it is not really a bill but is intended as a constitutional amendment. Congress would need to legislate the specifics.   I am saying that this proposed amendment would give congress the power to legislate those specifics, however they may look.   I do not think a company should be allowed to just arbitrarily fire people based on a group that they are a part of. Unless it can be reasonably considered to affect their performance at work."

I do not think a company should be allowed to just arbitrarily fire people based on a group that they are a part of. Unless it can be reasonably considered to affect their performance at work.   I don't know if I like the idea of an amendment this vague. It gives a lot of room for creative, and potentially otherwise overbearing interpretative legislation.   I think any company should be able to fire whomever they please, no matter what the reason. It's their business, after all.

ModelUSGov,3a68h8,thmsm,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:24:01 2015 UTC,I don't follow.
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,yolomatic_swagmaster,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:33:45 2015 UTC,I based this of the XXI Amendment of the Constitution of Connecticut. That is where this phrasing comes from. It could use some clarification.
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,laffytaffyboy,2,Wed Jun 17 18:50:02 2015 UTC,The XXI and V amendments to the Constitution of Connecticut prohibit discrimination in general based on sex and mental or physical disability respectively.  This amendment disallows discrimination in the exercise or enjoyment of his or her civil or political rights.  There is a big difference.
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,lsma,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:35:16 2015 UTC,"Amendment XXI reads:   Article fifth of the amendments to the constitution is amended to read as follows: No person shall be denied the equal protection of the law nor be subjected to segregation or discrimination in the exercise or enjoyment of his or her civil or political rights because of religion, race, color, ancestry, national origin, sex or physical or mental disability.   While the exact definition of this may need to be cleaned up, that quote is taken word for word from the Amendment. There is no difference, let alone ""a big difference."""
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,laffytaffyboy,2,Thu Jun 18 03:43:13 2015 UTC,"If it just read:   nor be subjected to segregation or discrimination in the exercise or enjoyment of his or her civil or political rights because of religion, race, color   Then that would ban all discrimination.  However, keeping that clause just means that you will be punished for violating someone's rights if you are doing it because of their race, religion, etc. alone.  As opposed to how the law is currently, where you will be punished for violating someon's rights no matter what the reason."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,lsma,2,Thu Jun 18 16:21:39 2015 UTC,"Is this amendment meant to counter an issue like a private bakery refusing to sell wedding cakes to gay couples?  After reading it a few times, I am having trouble discerning what issue this amendment is supposed to address."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,Lukeran,3,Thu Jun 18 18:28:52 2015 UTC,"I think it just addresses problems across the nation that arise because of inequality.  So, yes your example would be solved with this bill."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,TheRandomRedditUser,3,Fri Jun 19 01:50:07 2015 UTC,"If that is the case, I really do not feel comfortable with this amendment proposal.  It has the potential to allow regulations that I believe go far beyond our government's jurisdiction."
ModelUSGov,3a68h8,Lukeran,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:28:01 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is perfectly within our jurisdiction. The governments job is to protect the people and many are threatened, assaulted, or even killed because of there believes, lifestyle, or physical characteristics."

ModelUSGov,3a68h8,MoralLesson,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:44:16 2015 UTC,"First off: Stawman Fallacy.  Second: Businesses don't deserve religious freedoms. They're not people.

(I would never do something like this) People deserve to be treated like every other person. Not cast aside, left to fend for themselves.  Finally : Why should, in your example, the same-sex couple have to sacrifice their freedom of belief and not the establishment?"

Thus, how will we prevent public bathrooms from becoming mixed-gender (that is a type of segregation, after all)? How will we prevent paraplegics from joining the military (that is a physical disability)? Does this mean the severely mentally disabled will be able to possess firearms (no discrimination on the basis of mental disability when applying the Second Amendment, right)? Wouldn't this attempt to codify same-sex marriage (this, of course, is a metaphysical absurdity) into the Constitution (clever and underhanded backdoor, I must say)?

ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,yolomatic_swagmaster,5,Tue Jun 16 20:10:19 2015 UTC,New to the sub. Does this model US have a constitution? Is it the same as the regular one?
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,jacoby531,4,Wed Jun 17 00:44:02 2015 UTC,"The US constitution is still used, but it can be amended."
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,laffytaffyboy,3,Wed Jun 17 00:48:22 2015 UTC,Which amendments passed?
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,AtomicSteve21,11,Wed Jun 17 01:07:24 2015 UTC,We have two that need to be ratified by the states.
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,DidNotKnowThatLolz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:42:41 2015 UTC,Where can we find these amendments?
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,barackoliobama69,2,Tue Jun 23 23:57:45 2015 UTC,It is CC:001 and JR 007. You can find them either in the state subs or here in the main sub.
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,barackoliobama69,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:02:12 2015 UTC,"None, so far, iirc."
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,barackoliobama69,4,Wed Jun 17 01:44:40 2015 UTC,I'm also new. Could someone clarify how voting works here? And can you vote outside your party?
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Adjal,2,Wed Jun 17 20:56:29 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by voting? If you are referring to votes on bills, then the answer is that only elected representatives and senators can vote. As to ""voting outside your party,"" I am not sure what you mean."
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,DidNotKnowThatLolz,5,Wed Jun 17 21:37:34 2015 UTC,"Sorry for not being more clear. I meant voting in terms of representatives. So if I'm a member of the democratic party, If I think someone from another party would be better for a certain position, there's no strict obligation to vote for the democrat, right? Sorry if the question sounds stupid, I'm just a bit mixed up about how it works in Model US gov."
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Metaxum,3,Wed Jun 17 22:54:25 2015 UTC,Most everything works like it does in real life. You are not obligated to vote for any one party or person even if you are registered for a certain party. You may vote however you wish.
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,HIPSTER_SLOTH,3,Wed Jun 17 22:55:48 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot!
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,DidNotKnowThatLolz,2,Wed Jun 17 22:57:27 2015 UTC,Are there primaries for the parties? I'm from WA and you have to declare a party to participate in its primary (and can only vote within that party).
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Dan-Morris,2,Sat Jun 20 08:36:47 2015 UTC,Yes there are usually primaries within parties if two people want to run for the same position.
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,DidNotKnowThatLolz,4,Sat Jun 20 15:32:34 2015 UTC,"Just a quick question, I find this all very interesting, and I hope to get involved.  Like the actual us government is there room in this sub reddit for lobbyists?"
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,DrMMalik,13,Fri Jun 19 23:22:33 2015 UTC,Haha can you imagine? A sub where model us politicians are bribed and influenced by reddit gold and mod positions upon retirement feels like a good parallel to real life.
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Rowland446,3,Sat Jun 20 02:52:01 2015 UTC,There are a few lobby groups such as the Liberty Lobby and the Labor Lobby.
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,MoralLesson,2,Sat Jun 20 02:39:38 2015 UTC,How do I start my own lobby group?
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Rowland446,2,Fri Jul 3 02:19:23 2015 UTC,Lobbies have no official capacity so any member can go ahead and create a lobby group.
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,BlackTacitus,4,Fri Jul 3 02:33:06 2015 UTC,"Is it possible to vote, discuss, and run for elections while remaining independent with no party affiliations?"
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,DidNotKnowThatLolz,3,Sat Jun 20 07:03:53 2015 UTC,Yes
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Adjal,4,Sat Jun 20 12:26:32 2015 UTC,New to the sub. Is there a preferred model political spectrum test used by this sub?
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,bollvirtuoso,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:27:42 2015 UTC,"There is not. However, if you state enough of your beliefs, then I am sure we can point you to a party that you fit in with.  Also:   The Republicans are like the real Republicans, though I think they have more moderates than the real-life party does. The Democrats are very big-tent and range from Blue Dog Democrats to Bernie Sanders-esque Democrats. You can read the Democratic Platform here. The Libertarians are much like real-life Libertarians. The Distributists hold economic principles in line with Distributism (every family should own their own business) and are social conservatives in a lot of ways. You can read the Distributist Platform here. The American Labor Party consists of social democrats and democratic socialists. You can read their platform here. The Green-Left Party consists of socialists, communists, and those who generally oppose capitalism. The Silver Legion Party is a fascist party and are comprised of fascists, traditionalists, social corporatists, theocrats, and national socialists.   We also have some independent groupings, if none of those sound appealing."
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,DidNotKnowThatLolz,2,Tue Jul 7 22:41:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I found one myself, but went ahead and looked into everything myself. I have everything taken care of."
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,2222lil,3,Wed Jul 8 17:32:42 2015 UTC,How do I start my own party?
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,DidNotKnowThatLolz,2,Fri Jun 19 01:55:44 2015 UTC,Another member asked this question. Read the comments in this thread.
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,2222lil,2,Fri Jun 19 02:11:34 2015 UTC,Here's the part of this thread where that's addressed.
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,DidNotKnowThatLolz,3,Sat Jun 20 08:40:54 2015 UTC,Who is your SCOTUS?
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Eilanyan,5,Sat Jun 20 16:27:54 2015 UTC,They can be found at /r/ModelSupCourt
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,DidNotKnowThatLolz,3,Sat Jun 20 18:30:10 2015 UTC,"I'm a little confused on the map. I live in Michigan so am I part of the Northern River District? If so, is there a subreddit for it?"
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Eilanyan,2,Mon Jun 22 00:03:58 2015 UTC,"Michigan would be the Northern River District. There are no subreddits for districts, but there are subreddits for states. You can find Central State at /r/ModelCentralState."
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,DidNotKnowThatLolz,3,Mon Jun 22 00:19:54 2015 UTC,So is the Central State comprised of the Northern River and Ohio River districts?
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,kingofquave,3,Mon Jun 22 00:21:17 2015 UTC,Yes
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,MoralLesson,3,Mon Jun 22 00:22:48 2015 UTC,I think /r/modelamericanlabor should be added to the list of small parties and the fascists removed and added to official list as they are now official.
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,DiscardedJoker,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:41:57 2015 UTC,They are still only an independent grouping.
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,DiscardedJoker,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:29:18 2015 UTC,"They got 15, what else is there? Granted I doubt anyone is willing to put in the effort to herd those cats."
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,ZWQncyBkaWNr,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:31:21 2015 UTC,"The party is still in its infancy. It needs some sort of platform, leader, etc."
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,DidNotKnowThatLolz,3,Tue Jun 23 21:34:43 2015 UTC,"Maybe you could update this so that it includes our three new parties as parties and not just groupings. This would help new members.  Also please mention that the Green-Left Party is also for anarchists, and a broad-tent Leftist party. Also, applicants are no longer reviewed by a party vote. Now they take a survey, and our Internal Affairs Committee votes on their admittance."
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Leecannon_,3,Tue Jul 7 23:44:55 2015 UTC,Maybe you could update this so that it includes our three new parties as parties and not just groupings.    Please.
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,laffytaffyboy,2,Wed Jul 8 18:46:40 2015 UTC,"How do you began to get involved in elections? How does running work? Do you just participate in bill discussions and then your name is entered? How do people vote for the people ""running""?"
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Leecannon_,2,Wed Jun 17 21:14:19 2015 UTC,"Elections take place every few months. Anybody on reddit can vote. Last election we had ~350 people vote.   The next election will take place in about a month. There will be a period when independent candidates and parties can submit who they are running and where. Afterwards, the campaign begins and soon after that the election.   Hope this answered your questions."
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,laffytaffyboy,3,Wed Jun 17 21:36:41 2015 UTC,"Yes it did. Thank you so much, you've been very helpful!"
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Leecannon_,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:57:33 2015 UTC,Is there a list of all the positions available? Could I run for state senate? How do the state governments work so far? Would running for state senate be a good way to get started?
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Smitty9913,2,Tue Jun 23 07:21:09 2015 UTC,Right now the states are a simple unicameral legislature with a governor. In the future we may expand them. I would say that running for a state legislator seat is a good way to get started.
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Leecannon_,2,Tue Jun 23 16:24:55 2015 UTC,Can I create parties?
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Smitty9913,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:02:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you will need at least 15 members to be officially recognized."
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,laffytaffyboy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:06:39 2015 UTC,do I just post it on the subreddit or how do I start it?
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,oughton42,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:07:48 2015 UTC,I'm not entirely certain. The mods should see this in a fairly short amount of time and they can give you a better answer. I think you should start by creating /r/Model(US)[party name here]
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Leecannon_,2,Thu Jun 18 04:14:18 2015 UTC,But how do I spread the word?
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,oughton42,2,Thu Jun 18 04:15:09 2015 UTC,If you need help I can help you out with the press.
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Leecannon_,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:35:58 2015 UTC,"Alright, should we pm?"
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,testmypatience,2,Thu Jun 18 13:15:48 2015 UTC,Yup feel free to PM with what your party is about and what it's hoping to achieve. When can discuss later from there.
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Bowbreaker,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:11:27 2015 UTC,I'd start by contacting /u/Smitty9913. He's in charge of /r/ModelUSGovPress and might write a short article if you ask. You could also write and submit the story yourself.
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Gohte,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:21:29 2015 UTC,"First you should create a sub where you guys can organize publicly, until you gain official party status. /r/ModelDistributists is a good example. You can advertise on other subreddits or try to get members already in /r/ModelUSGov to join your party. Like /u/laffytaffyboy suggested you could talk to someone in the press and I'm sure someone would be happy to write about it. You do need a minimum of 15 members and some activity to show for it.  Hope this helps."
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Bowbreaker,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:32:35 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, what sort of Party did you have in mind? Also, welcome to the sub!"
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Gohte,2,Thu Jun 18 04:58:27 2015 UTC,"A more moderate party that contains both republican and democratic ideas, one based on transparency, and truth. A group that fights corruption, and is willing to face political consequences for doing what Americans want. A group based on the needs of the people, not the needs of a politician"
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Eilanyan,2,Thu Jun 18 12:40:18 2015 UTC,"With the influx of new users, you may make some progress. Good luck!"
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Leecannon_,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:45:33 2015 UTC,Thank you!
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Curt04,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:47:05 2015 UTC,Send me a pm. I think you would like the group I am forming.
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,DidNotKnowThatLolz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:57:02 2015 UTC,"The Party also needs to fit an unfilled ideological area. We will not accept another Communist party, for example."
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,surgingfishtank,3,Thu Jun 18 09:59:47 2015 UTC,"If the current Communist Party has a platform that is wholly incompatible with another communist's ideas couldn't they then form a ""true"" communist party just like in real life?"
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Leecannon_,2,Sun Jun 21 06:01:15 2015 UTC,"We're a broad-tent socialist party by definition, there shouldn't really be any reason for someone to want to start another party."
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,DidNotKnowThatLolz,3,Sun Jun 21 12:54:52 2015 UTC,Who knows. My country has a dozen socialist parties. Clearly there is reason for such a thing. What if someone's problem is exactly the broadness of the tent. I'm only speaking hypothetically here but if 15 people disagree with where the ModelGLP is heading then wouldn't it be normal to form a new party? And I don't see how any law would forbid that.
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,kingofquave,2,Sun Jun 21 17:09:12 2015 UTC,"I mean sure, but we accommodate every view. Every party decision is made through weekly General Assemblies, where we vote on party motions, bill ideas, and new member admissions. We're a democratically organized party and we all recognize that we have to stay unified to exert any kind of real power here."
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,ElliottC99,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:14:18 2015 UTC,Could give us at /r/modelamericanlabor a shot :D
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,ElliottC99,2,Tue Jun 23 17:39:41 2015 UTC,Moderates?
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,ElliottC99,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:39:36 2015 UTC,That would be fine.
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,DidNotKnowThatLolz,2,Thu Jun 18 12:58:16 2015 UTC,Just curious about something after looking around here and in the other model subreddits...it seems like because of this place being so massively dominated by Democrats and Green-Lefts that everyone else has just given up and left because they stand no chance at all. I mean I guess this shouldnt be a surprise for reddit but what really is the point if there is no debate for anything?
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,ElliottC99,6,Fri Jun 19 06:51:44 2015 UTC,"I would say two things, the GLP have differing views that the Democrats on several topics, and the Republicans had a majority in congress in the past, so with good advertising, they could do it again."
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,MoralLesson,5,Fri Jun 19 11:22:35 2015 UTC,"Republicans once held a super-majority in the Senate and a majority in the House, so anything is possible."
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,Daeurth,2,Fri Jun 19 14:19:28 2015 UTC,How do I get a party flair?
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,ElliottC99,2,Mon Jun 22 01:29:01 2015 UTC,Edit flair on the sidebar should work.
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,DangleMyStash,2,Mon Jun 22 01:30:51 2015 UTC,"Do current events IRL, like the Charleston Shooting, Nepal Earthquake, and Hurricane Sandy affect MUSG?"
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,DidNotKnowThatLolz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:59:38 2015 UTC,"As of right now, no. We do occasionally create a fake event in order to create some activity on a subject. Recently that was our gun debate."
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,DangleMyStash,2,Mon Jun 22 16:29:47 2015 UTC,I was just looking at the flairs. What is the silver legion party?
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,AndyBatch,2,Fri Jun 26 02:30:16 2015 UTC,Fascists
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,MoralLesson,2,Fri Jun 26 02:41:08 2015 UTC,Can you add /r/modelamericanlabor and /r/modeldistributists to the offical parties list.
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,AndyBatch,2,Wed Jul 1 20:40:02 2015 UTC,They are already on the sidebar. Do want it to be changed somewhere else?

ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,kingofquave,2,Wed Jul 1 21:23:05 2015 UTC,"Basically I feel the Silver Legion, Distributists and American Labor lose out on potential members because they aren't mentioned as official parties."
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,pavpatel,2,Sat Jul 4 16:48:12 2015 UTC,They are all featured on the sidebar and have announcements on the front page.
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,mocosuburbian,2,Sat Jul 4 21:58:25 2015 UTC,"In this subreddit, one of the best ways to get involved is to join a party. This will give you access to party subreddits, as well as better access to elections. The parties are as follows: The Republicans, who generally follow their real life leanings. The Democrats, who are generally a little bit to the left of their real life leanings. The Green-Lefts, who are socialists and communists. Note that the GLP approves all new members by a party vote, and generally do not accept self-professed liberals. The Libertarians, who follow real life leanings.   Add the three new parties to this text"

ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,pavpatel,2,Mon Jul 6 16:52:32 2015 UTC,Can someone explain how the election process works?
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,DidNotKnowThatLolz,2,Mon Jul 6 12:09:36 2015 UTC,"So, to really get involved, I just participate in the bill discussions and progress from there?"
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,TigerMonarchy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:40:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, and I would also suggest joining a party or starting one of your own. However, it is not a requirement and there are some rather well-known independents, like our Attorney General, /u/Logic_85, and the House Candidate, /u/Hlafward."
ModelUSGov,3a2nrv,DidNotKnowThatLolz,2,Tue Jul 7 22:35:17 2015 UTC,"Awesome. I've always classified in a slightly left of center standpoint, and have primarily voted in a left standpoint. So I'm probably a typical Democrat. How do I join?"

Not so sure about the Fascists.   Additionally there seems to be a new Progressive Party ( /r/MUSGProgressive ) that you could advertise for similarly to  what's already been done for the Distributists/American Labor/Fascists  EDIT: basically American Labor has 50something members now and the Distributists probably have less although still a large amount SO U P D A T E T H E P A G E PLEASE WE ARE LEGIT PARTIES"

Also, is there a more detailed description of the differences between American Labor and the Green-Left Party? I know I should do the research and figure it out myself, but I am really new to this interesting subreddit.  If you could help me identify the best party, I consider myself liberal in almost all policy issues. I am pro-marriage equality, pro-choice (I highly recommend using contraceptives before having to resort to that, though), unsure about the TPP (I agree that it sends jobs overseas, a negative, but the whole plan might have positive benefits, though I don't know enough about it to make a good judgement on it), for raising taxes on the wealthy, for raising the minimum wage, for universal health care, expanding social security, moderately reducing the United States' military spending, etc. My views highly align with Bernie Sanders (The candidate I support for the Democratic nomination). From the little I know, American labor seems the best for me, because I don't think I fully fit into the socialist and communist view (I may misunderstand socialism, though, it has some very attractive qualities, I am just not highly educated on it).  Could you also give me a general idea of the number of redditors in each party? The subreddits for the parties are private.  Also, can people ever change parties?  EDIT: I found the dudaone websites that explain the party platforms well."

ModelUSGov,39z5n0,thmsm,2,Tue Jun 16 00:51:02 2015 UTC,"It is interesting that you chose those specific states, which actually have quite the spread in firearm fatalities per capita.  Tennessee's rate is 14.81 per 100,000 people, almost double that of California, which, at 7.97 per 100,000 people, is ranked 40th lowest in the nation.  According to 2007 numbers, gun owners make up 43.9% of the TN population, yet only 21.3% of California's. Looking at the list of states with the highest firearm fatalities per capita, in descending order;    Foo Bar Text    Rank State Rate   1 Louisiana 18.91   2 Mississippi 17.80   3 Alaska 17.41   4 Wyoming 16.92   5 Montana 16.74   6 Oklahoma 16.60   7 Alabama 16.34   8 Arkansas 15.72   9 South Carolina 15.09   10 West Virginia 14.99   11 Arizona 14.91    It is clear that states with the highest firearm ownership rates have the highest gun deaths. This plays out in on a country basis, too. The US is by far the most heavily armed nation in the developed world, with 88 guns per 100 citizens. It's rate of gun homicides is approximately 7x the OECD average, and it isn't even close."
ModelUSGov,39z5n0,MultiKdizzle,3,Tue Jun 16 13:26:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not arguing that states with fewer guns have less gun crime, I'm arguing that gun ownership has little effect on the entire violent crime rate.

ModelUSGov,39z5n0,MultiKdizzle,6,Tue Jun 16 14:13:47 2015 UTC,"I believe what u/thmsm is saying is that the violent crime rate is independent of gun ownership.  Of course the gun crime rate will be correlated to the availability of guns, but the point is that more guns ≠ more crime.  A person who wants to commit a violent crime will find some other weapon if guns are not available."

Yes knowing politics is what the Athenians did. The representative democracy is not fair.

They are not in anyway less worthy of doing so then you congressman.  People in direct democracies have shown countless times that they can decide in favor of minorities. Just look at the recent decisions in Switzerland. The majority (around 70%) decided to not tax the inheritance of the wealthy (about 2%).  In the end those people have voted for what they seem just. Moving the talks we have at the dinner table, the talks we have at work, the talks of politically interested people, to the political arena of this country is the only right thing to do.

If you are only concerned with Honey Booboo then you won't be voting at all (just my guess but most likely true).   Talk to your extended family. How many of them have in-depth knowledge of politics beyond the names of certain representatives? How many of them derive all of what they know about politics solely from news sources on television? Although Marc Dice is a crazy, conspiratorial cretin, he does make it abundantly how scant knowledge about politics actually is here in the United States with his videos questioning people about political events/people.    Really? My voice is important after I elected my representative who can do whatever he pleases, who can vote in favor of big companies or be forced to vote against something because there are other representatives forcing him.   My mistake, I shouldn't have used that sentence there. What I was trying to point out was that direct democracy is a double-edged sword, and I don't think you're taking into account the flaws that are inherent to it, at least at our present time. People, by and large, aren't knowledgeable about politics. Implementing direct democracy, I don't believe, is going to change this."

Nobody says that the right to vote was distributed in a fair way.    Talk to your extended family.    My mother, my father, my 2 little brothers that are still underage...all care very much about politics. In fact the only person I know that is not that involved is my girlfriend. But she doesn't even know the representatives she could vote for, she simply doesn't care.   Implementing direct democracy, I don't believe, is going to change this.   If you can't put anything up for discussion and voting as a citizen you don't care as much as if you are directly involved and you have the possibility to rule yourself.   Not really. As I pointed out, unless the Supreme Court is involved in some way, Initiatives could be passed that are unconstitutional.   If that wouldn't happen today, would we need the Supreme Court to look at cases that have to do with violating the constitution?

You're missing the point. This bill has literally no procedure for an event in which the Initiative being passed is unconstitutional. There are procedures in the event that a bill passed by Congress is unconstitutional.   What we could do is grant the Congress the right to send an Initiative to the Supreme Court.   That would work. Though, this bill will need to be amended, if it isn't unconstitutional in and of itself."
ModelUSGov,39wziz,ThatAssholeYahweh,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:21:01 2015 UTC,I think having a mandatory Supreme Court hearing isn't a bad idea. Perhaps only if a referendum passes?
ModelUSGov,39wziz,cameronc65,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:46:02 2015 UTC,"Well, no, a Supreme Court hearing should be held before voting for the Initiative occurs, otherwise it kind of defeats the purpose of the vote if it's just going to get overturned."

ModelUSGov,39wziz,Logic_85,4,Tue Jun 16 20:13:48 2015 UTC,"How exactly is this constitutional? If I recall, states that have referendums have provisions in their constitutions that allow for them to be called by the people. Before this bill can be considered there should be an amendment in place to make it legal"
ModelUSGov,39wziz,intrsurfer6,3,Mon Jun 15 23:48:05 2015 UTC,What's unconstitutional about it?
ModelUSGov,39wziz,cameronc65,4,Tue Jun 16 11:54:55 2015 UTC,"What's unconstitutional about it?   The Constitution makes no mention of referendums, so my first thought is to conclude that the power of referendum, not given to Congress or any other federal branch of government, is reserved to the states via the 10th Amendment.  However, Congress is granted enumerated powers, powers that are very broad, including the power to tax, spend, regulate interstate commerce, etc.  It stands to reason, then, that by granting these powers to Congress, these powers are not given to the states by the 10th Amendment, even if by referendum, because a referendum on taxation would be an attempt to take power from the legislative branch, in violation of the Constitution.  Additionally, the Constitution provides for what is effectively referendum at the state level with Constitutional Convention.  Congress is also required to pass new amendments by referendum through the states, three-quarters of which must approve the new amendment.    Looking to similar proposals, the National Initiative for Democracy has advocated for a national referendum by CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.  Overall, it seems that most people agree that a bill granting referendum powers is unconstitutional.  Unless you are aware of other facts that I have not considered, I would say this bill is unconstitutional, and should not even be put up to a vote."
ModelUSGov,39wziz,Logic_85,3,Tue Jun 16 20:04:58 2015 UTC,"You say exactly what I mean: this bill should not even be considered until a constitutional amendment (which I would not support) is introduced and enacted. /u/bluefisch200 has a good plan here, but needs to make it legal before introducing it and allowing debate."
ModelUSGov,39wziz,intrsurfer6,2,Tue Jun 16 22:01:02 2015 UTC,"There's nothing in the constitution that allows for referendums or initiatives; unless there's an amendment that provides for them, this can't be legal"
ModelUSGov,39wziz,intrsurfer6,2,Tue Jun 16 12:22:33 2015 UTC,"There's plenty of things that the constitution doesn't explicitly allow for, that doesn't make it unconstitutional."
ModelUSGov,39wziz,cameronc65,2,Tue Jun 16 12:43:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but this is different from other things; The Constitution specifically gives lawmaking powers to the congress. If we were to change that, which this bill would do, we would need to amend the constitution to allow for other ways to make laws (through initiative, referendum, etc.)  It's like if someone wanted to ban flag burning; They would need to amend the constitution to ban it, because the courts have decided that flag burning is a right under the first amendment. If they were to get a law passed, it would be ruled unconstitutional, because it's infringing on a power granted in the constitution"

ModelUSGov,39wziz,Danotto94,3,Mon Jun 15 15:14:10 2015 UTC,"I am new to this sub, so you'll have to forgive me if I break any norms, this being my first policy-related comment. My biggest problem with this bill is that I am afraid that it could become a mechanism for the small minorities of each party to hijack policy. Civic participation is very low right now in our Republic, and it is well known that the most politically active on either side of the spectrum are at the extremes. While there may be a strong barrier to getting a referendum onto the ballot in terms of signatures required, that can be overcome with lots of money and devoted volunteers. Once it is on the ballot, as long as 51% of THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO VOTE approve of it, it will become law. Seeing how low voter turnout is, except for those on the far extremes of their ideology, especially in non-Presidential elections, I would be afraid of the referendum process being used to advance radical legislation."
ModelUSGov,39wziz,hhaaahah,5,Wed Jun 17 23:45:22 2015 UTC,Well said.
ModelUSGov,39wziz,DidNotKnowThatLolz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:35:55 2015 UTC,"Fearing that people don't care about their own future and giving them the possibility to vote are not something that should contradict each other.  If we face the fact that after voters can initiate initiatives the political interest isn't growing then we have to work against that problem. Because if they don't care they won't care for their representatives either. It should be our duty to involve them. In addition, with the possibility to vote the interest automatically grows.  And even the person with a lot of money and a lot of volunteers still needs the people who sign his initiative. If the people actually don't care they will not sign it and it will not even be considered.  However I understand the concern that money could buy advertisement or that you could mislead the public with names that sound beautiful but have nothing to do with the initiative itself. Here again it should be our duty to see the problems that arise  correct them. For example we could force advertisers to show the sponsor of the ad not only as a footnote but at least for 5 seconds at the end of the ad in big letters.  All in all, giving the people their rights and removing the middle-man who is easily influenced by other factors which lead him to vote against the interest of his supporter is just.  If problems arise we should not run away but fix them."
ModelUSGov,39wziz,bluefisch200,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:58:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with you in principle, but I simply do not believe that this resolution fixes any of the problems you yourself just agreed with.   My other issue with this is the signature threshold. 10%, while on par with most state's referendum policies, is too high for all but the most well funded and organized movements to achieve. However, if you lower it to something like 1 or 2 percent, then it will, in my opinion at least, be too easy for radicals to gather the signatures. 2% of the United States is about 6.4 million people. I don't think it would be too difficult for, say, National Right to Life to gather 6.4 million signatures to put strict controls on access to abortion. This measure simply has too many loose ends."
ModelUSGov,39wziz,hhaaahah,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:39:22 2015 UTC,"Don't think that just saying that a problem may arise is the same as accepting that it will arise.  The threshold is already amended to 2%. And I think that is just fine.    National Right to Life to gather 6.4 million signatures to put strict controls on access to abortion.   So should they. If this is what over 50% of the voters prefer then we (I guess as a democrat you are as opposed to such ideas as I am) seem to be in the minority.  It is our job, the parties and the congress, to pick the people up and let them vote. It can not be solved in this bill, that is nothing you can enforce. You have to work on that by showing the people that their voice matters.  People DO care about voting when they see that they can change something. The DO NOT care when they can only elect some representatives.  If this measure has to many loose ends then I will have to talk with certain countries that somewhat manage to not fail completely in establishing this. It doesn't matter how many people there are, it is only important that the people know that their voice is heard and then they will come."
ModelUSGov,39wziz,bluefisch200,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:47:03 2015 UTC,"Don't think that just saying that a problem may arise is the same as accepting that it will arise.    This isn't theoretical, we've seen it happen at the state level all the time. Every election year, you see on the ballot many good ideas, but also many, many terrible ones. Legislating is a complex issue, which requires stakeholder input as well as legislators and staffers who are knowledgeable on the subject matter."
ModelUSGov,39wziz,hhaaahah,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:52:03 2015 UTC,"which requires stakeholder input    I can't see how anyone is a more important stakeholder then someone else.   legislators and staffers who are knowledgeable on the subject mat   Once again I ask you if I should tell other countries that they don't function.   Legislating is a complex issue And a corrupt one with a lot of involvement from people who only look out for themselves. People even get killed because that can alter the outcome. In a half-direct democracy that can't happen.   A great comment from Georg Lutz (Professor for political sciences at the University of Lausanne/Switzerland) in regards to an imitative to allow pre-implantation genetic diagnostics:   Are some issues too complex to be decided by voters?  G.L.: That’s a very big question! There are many ways to frame that – as a very general question on whether people in general are fit for direct democracy. I don’t think [pre-implantation genetic diagnostics] is any more difficult than other questions – sometimes voters have to assess what impact a certain measure will have on the future of the economy, which isn’t a particularly easy task either. And in Switzerland there is this strong belief that people are generally capable of taking such decisions, even when they are fairly complex.  Studies show there is a huge variation in people’s general and specific knowledge on all kinds of issues: there’s a small group that is reasonably knowledgeable and a lot of people who aren’t. But you don’t really need to have a fully informed decision in order to make a reasoned decision. You can just rely on some basic values, which give you guidance; you can also rely on the recommendations of the parties or certain interest groups such as the church or organisations and institutions that you feel close to.    Again, if you allow someone to vote he will get interested and he will try to understand as much as he needs. Stopping people from influencing the voters in a unfair way is something we have to resolve with further Bills (if actually necessary as you can't know everything)."

What happens when someone in a wheelchair is denied purchasing a gun? The cost of these appeals is immense, on both the citizen and the government. Some of these cases will likely hit the court of appeals, but the money from this bill will not fund those actions.   Outside the funding issue, there are serious issues with constitutionality--congress is giving a huge amount of power over to the executive here by giving them the prerogative of defining mental illness and violent crime, things congress should spend more time working on instead of passing the buck to agencies.   The efficacy of the bill is also in question. How effective will this be? This only stops people from buying guns from an FTL. Private sales will still happen. Illegal sales will still happen. There comes a point when there is too much burden on the citizen and the only people obtaining guns will be those who do so illegally.   This bill has the right idea but the wrong execution."

That means directly democratic neighborhood armories, training, and use with the consent of the community.

ModelUSGov,39o2ph,Eilanyan,4,Sun Jun 14 02:34:14 2015 UTC,"Many of you have pointed out your concerns for Section 4 and violent criminals. How does this amendment sound?  Section 5: Those who have committed a violent crime in the past must undergo further steps in order to obtain a weapon.   Sub Section 1: Former violent criminals must obtain a weapons license from their state.  Sub Section 2: Former violent criminals must register their guns to a federal gun registry that keeps track of weapons owned by former violent criminals.  Sub Section 3: Prior to release from prison, The Department of Corrections shall be qualified to deem any violent criminal fit or not fit to own a licensed weapon.   Sub Section 4: If they are deemed fit to own a weapon, then the former inmate may purchase a weapon so long as they follow the procedures listed in this section.  Sub Section 5: If they are deemed not fit to own a weapon, then the former inmate is not legally allowed to purchase a weapon. This decision may be appealed by the person in question every 2 years, until they are deemed fit to own a weapon by the Department of Corrections.  This allows former criminals to obtain weapons, but makes it much harder for them to obtain one and keeps track of who owns what guns. This allows for additional oversight. Additionally, it ensures that those who pose the greatest threat to society such as murders are not given the ability to purchase a weapon straight out of prison."

I don't like the idea of a federal gun registry at all. However, I could support this bill if sub sections 1 and 2 were revised to reflect state's rights (the ability to set their own standard on gun registries and weapons licensing), or removed completely (my preference).   Either way, it's good progress from the original bill."
ModelUSGov,39o2ph,cmac__17,4,Sun Jun 14 08:44:15 2015 UTC,If we give the power for registration to the states there will be those who will not due so. That leads to high risks.

ModelUSGov,39o2ph,Lukeran,3,Sun Jun 14 22:21:50 2015 UTC,Many of you have pointed out the issues with Section 4 and mental illness. How does this amendment sound?  Section 4: .....  Sub Section 1: .....  Sub Section 2: A severe mental illness shall be defined as an illness that causes someone to be unable to care for themselves on a daily basis and/or causes someone to lack the sense of right from wrong.  Sub Section 3: Illnesses that fall under this definition shall be qualified by the Department of Health and Human Services.  Sub Section 4:  A violent crime shall be qualified by the Department of Justice.  This makes it less vague and ensures that people with minor mental disabilities will not be disqualified from owning a gun. This section is mostly aimed at making sure those with severely unstable mental conditions such as schizophrenia are not able to obtain a weapon.
ModelUSGov,39o2ph,thmsm,4,Sun Jun 14 02:30:38 2015 UTC,A severe mental illness shall be defined as someone who is unable to care for themselves     I don't think you mean to define a severe mental illness as a person.

ModelUSGov,39o2ph,TheRealRailguy,2,Sun Jun 14 02:49:43 2015 UTC,"Is that how we are going to define severe mental illness?  From a contextual stance, that does not make sense.  If the person does not have the mental capacity to take care of themselves then how can they possibly have the prowess to plan and carryout a shooting or any other crime?  It might be better to just list the mental illnesses that describe the content of section four, sub section two.  This would dissolve any question of interpretation of what is allowed and not."
ModelUSGov,39o2ph,oughton42,4,Sun Jun 14 22:32:08 2015 UTC,"I don't want to define specifically what mental illnesses because I am not an expert, so that is why I left it up to the DHHS. In addition, I don't want to list a whole bunch of mental illnesses only to discover after the fact that maybe one that should be there is missing or one that should not be listed is there. This allows the list of ""severe mental illnesses"" to be altered without creating an amendment to the law."

ModelUSGov,39o2ph,oughton42,2,Sun Jun 14 02:55:08 2015 UTC,"I see no problem with denying guns to people that have been convicted of a felony; states disenfranchise felons from voting in elections, even though they have a constitutional right to vote. It makes sense that we can restrict guns to law abiding, mentally sound citizens.   However, before we move toward background checks for guns, maybe we should consider finding a faster way to conduct the checks; that way, if a law abiding, responsible citizen wants to buy a gun, they can do it as fast as possible. In the end, lets give the guns to the responsible people and keep them out of the hands of criminals and mentally ill people. If this could be done, I would vote yea"

ModelUSGov,39o2ph,TheRealRailguy,3,Sat Jun 13 19:03:54 2015 UTC,"No.  Just no.  You're using the same logic that so many people in this country use, including racists.  Statistically people of color commit a larger proportion of crimes than white people.  Does that mean we should assume all people of color are criminals?  Of course not.  So why is it ok to say that because statistically ex-violent felons commit a higher crime rate, it is ok to take away their rights that are guaranteed by the Constitution?  They've served their sentence, its absolutely ridiculous to punish them more.  And as far as people with mental issues are concerned, the same principle appliess.  Unless a court rules them mentally incapable of handling their own affairs, then you have no right to deny them access to firearms, even if they are statistically more likely."

That's a despicable response.  There is massive difference between African-Americans ""being more violent"" (gonna need a citation on that), and those who willingly commit violent crimes and who have certain mental conditions that would make them unsuitable for gun ownership. One could argue that some violent offenders are victims of state oppression (and some certainly are), but we must be careful about making the path the gun ownership so simple for the truly violent and mentally unfit.

It's simply and utterly foolish to assume that because American blacks may be correlated with higher crime rates (and if so, it's due to immense injustices on behalf of the State and society overall, not some farcical and racist ""natural disposition""), they are comparable to people who have actually committed violent crimes."

I don't think you looked at the facts. Blacks are correlated with a higher crime rate. It's a statistical truth.   As for your second point, I believe in redemption. Why should someone who has done their time be subjected to different laws than the rest of us? Using your logic, if ex-cons must be prohibited from exercising their constitutional rights because of their correlation to violence, shouldn't other demographics with the same correlation be treated the same way?

Going by that rule, you're left with two demographics (blacks and ex-cons), each with a correlation to violent crime.

See: http://www.systemiccapital.com/40-reasons-us-jails-and-prisons-are-full-of-black-and-poor-people/  Still you don't seem to understand that blacks are not equivalent to convicted criminals. Whatever percentage of blacks may be convicted of violent crimes (and what number of those aren't victims of the racist system), that number is csrtainly lower than the 100% of violent criminals. There is a difference, even from your statistics, between those correlated with crime, and those who have actually committed a violent crime.  We must realize that the current criminal justice system is punitive, not rehabilitative. Until such a time where that isn't the case, we must rely on strict rules and psych evaluations before handing guns to demonstrably violent people. I know you like to mention people who simply ""made a mistake,"" but what -- under the current system -- is to prevent them from making a ""mistake"" again?"
ModelUSGov,39o2ph,thmsm,3,Sun Jun 14 04:46:07 2015 UTC,And yet we find your party religiously adhering to a document written a mere 59 years later...
ModelUSGov,39o2ph,risen2011,2,Sun Jun 14 20:33:39 2015 UTC,"I have to ask, which?"
ModelUSGov,39o2ph,Eilanyan,3,Mon Jun 15 00:38:27 2015 UTC,Black population is also over policed and over convicted. Also love to control for poverty.
ModelUSGov,39o2ph,thmsm,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:02:50 2015 UTC,"Sure, in the very same vein that formerly convicted criminals are over policed, over convicted, and impoverished. That doesn't mean anything or change my point."
ModelUSGov,39o2ph,risen2011,2,Sun Jun 14 02:09:19 2015 UTC,"Again, equating that over policing based on skin colour is like over policing based on past criminal actions."
ModelUSGov,39o2ph,NewMcw,2,Sun Jun 14 02:14:15 2015 UTC,"The reasons behind why they're over-policed or more violent are irrelevant in this specific debate.   The question is, based on a strong correlation between a group and violence, is it right to restrict the constitutional rights for everybody who falls into that demographic?"
ModelUSGov,39o2ph,sneakypedia,2,Sun Jun 14 02:33:43 2015 UTC,"Those convicted for violence are more likely to commit due to personal issues on top of any societal pressures. There is nothing inherently more violent about being black.  Again, the difference is key if we are talking about restrictions. Having said that I agree with our Libertarian friend that people who are out served their time so I think it should restrict as part of probation. Though I would go much farther on gun control/restrict constitutional right then the GLP or Dems."
ModelUSGov,39o2ph,TheRealRailguy,2,Sun Jun 14 02:36:21 2015 UTC,"Typical misrepresentation of an opponents argument.  I really don't see this conversation going abywhere, considering you've starting off your response with a logical fallacy, but I'll oblige.  I made no comparison between the parties, I simply compared the sensationalist ""for the good of the community"" logic. I did not call Blacks ""more violent"", I said that statistically the majority of crimes are committed by them.  The issue boils down to this: you and many others are willing to take the CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS away from people because you think that it would benefit the community.  Well America is not built on a ""good of the community"" socialist ideal.  It is built on the ideal that every individual has rights.  Government's job is not to enforce what is good for the community, but solely what is good for the individual by protecting the indivuals' rights."

ModelUSGov,39o2ph,bluefisch200,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:46:31 2015 UTC,"It's #ThrowbackThursday, I guess.  And as I stated up and down this thread, it's foolish to compare violent criminals with black Americans in regards to how we afford them rights to own deadly weapons. One group is composed entirely -- literally 100% -- of proven, demonstrably violent people. The other is a group of people who, due to wide-spread poverty and societal abandonment, rigged statistics, and systematic racism pervasive in the U.S. ""Justice"" system, are associated with higher rates of crime -- the key word being associated, i.e. not true to every individual.  Saying our rhetoric is the same is such a surface-level analysis that completely misses the deeper points in the argument. What you're saying doesn't even have merit; it's a low-effort attempt to dismiss my arguments without actually dealing with them."
ModelUSGov,39o2ph,TheRealRailguy,2,Thu Jul 9 14:56:45 2015 UTC,"No. Just no. You're using the same logic that so many people in this country use, including racists.   Pardon me, did you just equate a member of the GLP to racists? That's very unprofessional of you.    So why is it ok to say that because statistically ex-violent felons commit a higher crime rate, it is ok to take away their rights that are guaranteed by the Constitution?   I'm sure the founding fathers wouldn't be to happy about a murderer getting out of jail and acquiring a large amount of weapons.  I didn't say ANYTHING about statistics.   They've served their sentence, its absolutely ridiculous to punish them more.   In the interest of protecting people, it's absolutely not. These people have committed violent crimes, and with the way the criminal justice is centered on punishment, they probably haven't reformed themselves. Would you like a violent criminal committing another violent crime with a weapon? I don't think so. We cant allow people who have betrayed the trust of society once to do it again.    And as far as people with mental issues are concerned, the same principle appliess. Unless a court rules them mentally incapable of handling their own affairs, then you have no right to deny them access to firearms, even if they are statistically more likely.   No. Gun ownership entails a gigantic amount of responsibility. If a person has a serious mental disorder, they are almost certainly unable to accept the responsibility of being a gun owner due to what gun ownership entails. Would you like mentally ill people to have guns?   In my hometown of Pittsburgh PA, a mentally ill man went in to our local psychiatric hospital to shoot his doctor with a gun. The man killed a nurse and wounded seven other people. His actions put all nearby hospitals and the nearby university on lockdown. My family members work at that university. It was a very scary day for me and many others in this city. That basically proves why we should not enable the mentally ill to own guns. Their medical condition will almost certainly preclude them from using that gun in a safe, responsible manner."
ModelUSGov,39o2ph,bluefisch200,2,Sun Jun 14 00:57:17 2015 UTC,"It's so easy for you and many others to use sensationalism to promote fearmongering.  The question is not whether you want mentally ill people or ex-felons to have guns.  Whether you want them to or not they have a CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT to own them.  Taking them away from them because as a group they are more likely to commit crimes is exatly the same logic as racists and other people who put down groups of people are.  And by no means am I calling you a racist, I am simply pointing out that the stereotype logic you use is the same as racists do."
ModelUSGov,39o2ph,thmsm,3,Sun Jun 14 15:54:13 2015 UTC,"It's so easy for you and many others to use sensationalism to promote fearmongering.    That's very strange coming from a libertarian. However, incedents like mass shootings happen every 64 days nowadays. I wouldn't call that fearmongering but I would call this a reasonable response.   Whether you want them to or not they have a CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT to own them.   And felons have the constitutional right to vote. However some states don't let them. The same thing applies to felons and guns. You can't just interpret the constitution at face value.    And by no means am I calling you a racist,   Equating a person to a racist is not calling them a racist.    I am simply pointing out that the stereotype logic you use is the same as racists do.   No it's not. The reason that racial minorities tend to commit more crime in this country is because they've been repressed for centuries. The reason that felons shouldn't have guns is because they've already committed a violent crime and they have shown that they are capable. We do not want to give guns to those who are going to harm innocent people."
ModelUSGov,39lk3w,Smitty9913,5,Fri Jun 12 16:09:17 2015 UTC,"Ok, it's going to be a lot harder to do it now but I find these acceptable. Just an FYI guys my filibuster was much longer than 2.5 hours long. I like the new rules though."

ModelUSGov,39lk3w,Smitty9913,2,Fri Jun 12 17:33:02 2015 UTC,Four out of six voting for cloture makes 66 2/3% - exactly the current (real) senate requirements.  I think these rules work well.

ModelUSGov,39lk3w,MoralLesson,3,Fri Jun 12 19:42:35 2015 UTC,So it should be 5 senators
ModelUSGov,39lk3w,Smitty9913,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:44:07 2015 UTC,That would defeat the purpose of a filibuster.
ModelUSGov,39lk3w,MoralLesson,2,Sat Jun 20 19:39:39 2015 UTC,"No, you would need 5 senators irl"
ModelUSGov,39lk3w,Smitty9913,2,Sat Jun 20 19:53:36 2015 UTC,"You're right. It's just weird because the number for an absolute majority and a three-fifths majority are the same. Honestly, I think the Senate should just vote to do away with filibusters in here."
ModelUSGov,39lk3w,MoralLesson,2,Sat Jun 20 19:55:10 2015 UTC,No filibusters are an important part of our system. Anyways I'm the only one who has ever done one.

ModelUSGov,39lk3w,hitbyacar1,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:03:38 2015 UTC,I thought we had six?  Hang on...  Yep you are right - eight senators total (sorry I must have been distracted when I posted that earlier).  So a 2/3 cloture vote would require 5 1/3 senators - the question is should we round up or down?
ModelUSGov,39lk3w,hitbyacar1,2,Fri Jun 12 19:49:55 2015 UTC,A cloture does not require 2/3 vote. It requires 60 senators. I rounded down since it may be hard to get all 8 senators to be present during a filibuster.
ModelUSGov,39lk3w,risen2011,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:21:17 2015 UTC,"Cloture requires 3/5 of all voting Senators iirc, not necessarily 60 senators"

ModelUSGov,39lk3w,laffytaffyboy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:26:32 2015 UTC,Ah I was under the impression that it took only 3/5 of the senators voting on the motion for cloture
ModelUSGov,39lk3w,bluefisch200,2,Sun Jun 14 18:33:11 2015 UTC,"If I can propose a new rule.   Filibusters can only be done during the discussion/amendment period of a bill. The discussion period will end after the regular amount of days or until the senator stops filibustering, whichever is longer."
ModelUSGov,39lk3w,bluefisch200,3,Fri Jun 12 18:17:18 2015 UTC,"What about bills that come from the House? The way it works now is that once a bill passes the House they go to the Senate immediately for vote. Seeing as how most bills start in the House, this could be an issue."
ModelUSGov,39lk3w,bluefisch200,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:25:48 2015 UTC,"Well the thing is, we could have the senator filibuster if we are given notice on the day the house bill passes. The end voting period for the bill would be delayed until four days (or however long it is) until the filibuster ends."
ModelUSGov,39lk3w,bluefisch200,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:31:57 2015 UTC,"I feel this is a reasonable adjustment. It is clear that enough people wanted to end the filibuster, but simply weren't aware or could not figure out how. I hope this reduces confusion in the future."
ModelUSGov,39lk3w,SolidBlues,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:23:30 2015 UTC,I don't understand this. Filibusters were always conducted before votes were happening. Voting period never begun until they ended. They are an instrument to win time to talk to members of the majority and were never allowed while voting.  And if I am not mistaken a Senator can not ask to speak while the presiding officer is speaking. As the presiding officer is speaking all the time while voting a filibuster can not happen while voting.
ModelUSGov,39lk3w,SolidBlues,3,Fri Jun 12 23:14:30 2015 UTC,May I ask /u/DidNotKnowThatLolz why we do not follow the real rules for filibustering where it is not possible to start a filibuster in the voting period but only in the time before?
ModelUSGov,39lk3w,Gohte,2,Tue Jun 16 12:01:07 2015 UTC,It's simply easier to have it during the voting period.
ModelUSGov,39lk3w,Smitty9913,2,Tue Jun 16 16:26:20 2015 UTC,But it leads to the possibility to talk longer than the voting period is and in that way let bills fail.  That is something that can simply not happen in the real Senate. So I would argue that we have to alter the rules to allow filibustering but stop it from being capable of letting bills fail.
ModelUSGov,39lk3w,Smitty9913,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:30:12 2015 UTC,Cloture can be invoked at any time during a filibuster and a bill doesn't fail until cloture has failed.

ModelUSGov,39iz5k,Logic_85,3,Fri Jun 12 06:19:35 2015 UTC,Anyone could sit here and completely lock this sub down if filibusters are allowed to be conducted like this. Filibusters conducted during the voting period of a bill while you're sitting at a computer copying and pasting paragraphs from articles you search while watching a movie or playing a game in another window should not be permitted at all in this simulation.
ModelUSGov,39iz5k,Gohte,2,Fri Jun 12 06:22:08 2015 UTC,"That is the point of a filibuster. Real filibusters are just as devoid of content. If we don't have filibusters in this simulation, we risk throwing out a tried and true debate method from the real us congress. I don't see any reason to prohibit filibusters."
ModelUSGov,39iz5k,Logic_85,6,Fri Jun 12 06:26:20 2015 UTC,"Because if I wanted to, all I would have to do is open up Netflix and make sure that I post one sentence from the Wikipedia article for Vladimir Lenin every few minutes. People could do this for literally every single bill, and it's a mindless activity that someone could keep up for hours. There are pressures in a real filibuster that don't exist while I'm sitting in my comfy computer chair with the entire world of entertainment at my fingertips, my bathroom right outside of my room, and food a few meters past that. A single person could shut this subreddit down with the current system.  I'm not saying that we prohibit filibusters, but they need to be seriously revisited and reformed, because what was allowed to happen tonight was a total joke, regardless of whether or not the bill would have passed without it."

Even if it makes sense for filibusters to happen during the voting period for this sub, it has never been explicitly stated and therefore the assumption will have been that the filibuster would take place during the debate and amendment period.  What we really need is an actual set of rules regarding how and when filibusters and clotures can occur."

ModelUSGov,39iz5k,DidNotKnowThatLolz,3,Fri Jun 12 05:31:19 2015 UTC,"So... There was no possibility of us invoking a cloture then? If the rules of bringing an end to a filibuster are unclear, why did we allow it in the first place?"

ModelUSGov,39iz5k,Smitty9913,3,Fri Jun 12 05:10:46 2015 UTC,"There is more happening than merely a bill being passed or not. Smitty, if you take the time to scan the thread, has now been encouraged by a filibuster that had no chance of being shut-down, and occurred at a wildly inappropriate time (ie, after the voting period had begun). We will now have to deal with his attempts in the future to stage a filibuster at the innapropriate time, and risk losing bills that should have been filibustered before they went to vote.  When are you all going to fix it? Also, no bills will be passable, period, until this is fixed."

ModelUSGov,39hqan,WJacobC,8,Thu Jun 11 20:09:15 2015 UTC,"I am hugely in support of increased NASA funding. I'm interested in discussion around the objective requirement, but I'm very happy with the sentiment that NASA needs more funding to do more great things.   I am unconvinced, however, that a federal law mandating a minimum percentage of spending, along with a set yearly objective requirement is the way to go.   Finally, the preamble seems emotionally charged and needlessly judgmental of past policy. I would prefer if it simply stated the goals of the act."
ModelUSGov,39hqan,bluefisch200,6,Thu Jun 11 20:12:56 2015 UTC,"I am on the same side here.  I think having a minimum percentage doesn't make much sense. It should rather be easier for NASA to get approval for their requested budget that they claim to need to reach their goals.   I am however not sure on how to do that.  As a fact, the negative attitude towards NASA, even from the citizens of our country comes from the fact that they think that NASA consumes up to 20% of the yearly federal budget.  We should work on that and improve the views from the people in regards to NASA."
ModelUSGov,39hqan,Logic_85,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:29:10 2015 UTC,"Here is an alternative for amendment:  Preamble: Research and exploration by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) promotes the sciences and increases technological availability to the masses.    Section 1: NASA shall:  (a) Provide its goals and objectives for research, travel, infrastructure, exploration, and training available to the Congress every year through testimony before Congress.  (b) Provide Congress with an estimate of the budget required to accomplish the goals and objectives stated.  (c) Such testimony shall take place in the ninety days preceding Congress's passage of a fiscal year budget.  Section 2: Congress shall:  (a) Appropriate funds sufficient to provide NASA with the ability to pursue 90% of its stated goals and objectives.  (b) In the event of a declared war or depression, the amount stated in subsection (a) may be reduced, but not to be reduced to less than 50%.    Section 3: Effective date  (a) This bill shall take effect for the Fiscal Year 2016."
ModelUSGov,39hqan,bluefisch200,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:12:24 2015 UTC,Is it much different from today? I mean today NASA probably also has a proposal and the congress will deny or agree or alter the proposal.  I mean it sounds nice and all but it doesn't differ much (correct me if I am wrong) from what we have right now. I believe the congress usually approves budgets for periods of multiple years with clear assignments of that budget to what NASA has to develop.
ModelUSGov,39hqan,Logic_85,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:33:06 2015 UTC,"It isn't much different from today, but it gives a lot of the control back to NASA, and guarantees them a certain level of funding, which they can use to plan for the future more efficiently.  This way, they aren't faced with planning a mission to Mars for 20 years, only to have the rug pulled out from under them at the 18 year mark."
ModelUSGov,39hqan,bluefisch200,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:34:49 2015 UTC,It pretty much forces congress to give NASA 90% of the funding needed. I like that.

I would imagine either a fine or some sort of limit/decrease on the budget for the next year but it isn't clearly defined."
ModelUSGov,39hqan,JerryLeRow,2,Sat Jun 20 03:05:30 2015 UTC,"Good intention, but:    2/3 vote on the objective? A simple majority should do. Why even the senate's vote? Senators who have no knowledge about NASA and its capabilities? No, rather let a board decide about it."
ModelUSGov,39hqan,MoralLesson,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:50:23 2015 UTC,Who would select the members of this board? Would we be having an extra-legislative body wielding the power to directly appropriate money from the treasury?
ModelUSGov,39hqan,JerryLeRow,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:10:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, assign NASA-technocrats to the board. Not politicians, who might be political technocrats, but have no knowledge about NASA's activities, its organization, its processes etc."
ModelUSGov,39hqan,MoralLesson,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:39:08 2015 UTC,These appointments can never be preserved from politics. Who appoints these boards? At some point the people making these appointments will be connected to the political branches.
ModelUSGov,39hqan,JerryLeRow,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:58:15 2015 UTC,What if you simply let the NASA employees vote for some?
ModelUSGov,39hqan,MoralLesson,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:39:48 2015 UTC,Employees of NASA would have a strong incentive to elect people who want to make the budget as big as possible. Just because NASA is awesome doesn't mean it won't have the same tendencies as other agencies.   I honestly think the best route would be for the Congress to appropriate a sizable amount of the federal budget (e.g. what would amount to about 2-3%) to NASA for the next ten years to give it a large and stable funding source -- and also make it the norm that NASA's funding bill lasts for 10 years. The Congress can give it additional monies during each 10-year time frame whenever NASA can show it is needed for a major goal (e.g. manned mission to Mars or a new space telescope).
ModelUSGov,39hqan,JerryLeRow,2,Sat Jun 20 19:46:25 2015 UTC,"Wait a minute, they and the NASA head don't partake in the general budget negotiations, this is up to Congress. They distribute the funds, so your argument seems to be invalid."
ModelUSGov,39hqan,MoralLesson,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:58:07 2015 UTC,"I asked   Would we be having an extra-legislative body wielding the power to directly appropriate money from the treasury?   You replied   Yes, assign NASA-technocrats to the board. Not politicians, who might be political technocrats, but have no knowledge about NASA's activities, its organization, its processes etc.   Thus, I figured your intent was for the size of NASA's budget to be decided on by this board (not how their budget would be dispersed)."
ModelUSGov,39hqan,JerryLeRow,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:02:00 2015 UTC,"No, appropriate in a sense of: the treasury gives them the money which Congress approved, not more, not less. The board would then set up the budget within the organization, but only the expenses side."
ModelUSGov,39hqan,MoralLesson,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:21:20 2015 UTC,"I like that idea, especially if the director gets to be ex-officio on it. It wasn't communicated all that well originally, though."

ModelUSGov,39hqan,Logic_85,2,Thu Jun 11 23:33:39 2015 UTC,"Just a quick note: preambles of bills are not an open invitation to jump up on a soapbox. It should explain the purpose and goal of a bill, or the problem a bill intends to solve. Emotional words, such as ""betrayed"" or ""crippled"" are very unprofessional and make a bill very difficult to take seriously."

ModelUSGov,39hqan,Lukeran,2,Mon Jun 15 16:39:29 2015 UTC,"They both do have contracts together.  I am just wondering how making NASA a major space player again will affect those business relationships.  Will the jobs originally allocated to SpaceX, or any other space organization, be carried out in house by NASA?  If this is not the case and NASA outsources contracts similar to how it does now, raising NASA's budget just so they can pay an outside organization would make things more expensive than they need to be."
ModelUSGov,39hqan,Eilanyan,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:53:13 2015 UTC,"Objective thing seems like bad idea that is just going to gridlock the money. Other departments don't get % based budgets, so I don't think we should start here unless is new norm."

ModelUSGov,396bgq,Oslovite,4,Tue Jun 9 19:07:54 2015 UTC,Canada wanted to leave NAFTA back in Clinton days and the sentiment is certainly not dead up north.

To simply leave NAFTA would be detrimental to both our economy and the economies of our allies.

ModelUSGov,396bgq,WJacobC,3,Tue Jun 9 19:34:03 2015 UTC,"A replacement would be better, certainly."
ModelUSGov,396bgq,Logic_85,5,Tue Jun 9 22:10:25 2015 UTC,That's what we are working towards. There's no reform thorough enough to fix all the things wrong with NAFTA.
ModelUSGov,396bgq,Oslovite,2,Tue Jun 9 22:12:35 2015 UTC,"The bill shouldn't just repeal NAFTA, then.  It should repeal and replace NAFTA.  Repealing and leaving us with a dearth of law on the subject of trade between the US, Canada, and Mexico is anarchy."
ModelUSGov,396bgq,Logic_85,4,Tue Jun 9 22:15:36 2015 UTC,We can't replace NAFTA through a bill. That requires an international discussion with Canada and Mexico.
ModelUSGov,396bgq,Oslovite,2,Tue Jun 9 22:16:45 2015 UTC,But you can repeal it with a bill?  Hmm.
ModelUSGov,396bgq,Logic_85,5,Tue Jun 9 22:18:25 2015 UTC,We are not repealing it. We are leaving.
ModelUSGov,396bgq,Oslovite,3,Tue Jun 9 22:19:37 2015 UTC,"NAFTA is a Congressional-Executive agreement.  If you say that Congress is taking action to ""leave"" NAFTA, you set yourself up for an admission that NAFTA is a treaty--which the President has the first word on.    If you are saying that Congress is acting under its power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and repealing the provisions of NAFTA as they apply to the United States, then Congress is acting Constitutionally.    It isn't just a question of semantics, it is a question of power.  Does Congress have power to do what you are proposing they do?  The answer is yes, but I don't believe that power is in the form you seem to think it is in."
ModelUSGov,396bgq,Logic_85,5,Tue Jun 9 22:26:53 2015 UTC,"Well, since Congress has the power to do so, I don't see any problem concerning the legality of this bill."
ModelUSGov,396bgq,Oslovite,3,Tue Jun 9 22:29:50 2015 UTC,"I think it would be irresponsible to simply fully withdraw from NAFTA. This would have adverse effects on our trade with the countries involved and hurt lots of businesses. I'd be willing to discuss amendments to NAFTA that make trade more fair and responsible so that it does not hurt American workers. However, in its current state, I cannot support this bill."
ModelUSGov,396bgq,DidNotKnowThatLolz,2,Wed Jun 10 03:50:04 2015 UTC,Agreed on all points.
ModelUSGov,396bgq,WJacobC,2,Wed Jun 10 04:15:45 2015 UTC,"Again, we can't amend NAFTA on our own. The plan is to leave it, and propose another TA to Canada and Mexico."
ModelUSGov,396bgq,Oslovite,1 point,Wed Jun 10 08:47:08 2015 UTC,I agree with /u/DidNotKnowThatLolz. This bill seems like a solution to a scenario that has not happened.  There must be talks of amending NAFTA with the nations involved or talks of actual alternatives to it before this bill should even be considered.
ModelUSGov,396bgq,Lukeran,2,Wed Jun 10 21:56:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's wise to just unilaterally back out of a trade agreement designed to work with more than one party. If there are truly detriments to NAFTA that are affecting our country, Instead of just withdrawing from NAFTA, we should meet with the other signatories and try to correct them. In short, I will vote no on this bill."

ModelUSGov,396bgq,schultejt,2,Tue Jun 9 21:35:17 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'm sure there's no problem in replacing USA for United States of America.  Why exactly do you say the preamble is poorly written?"
ModelUSGov,396bgq,Oslovite,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:14:19 2015 UTC,The preamble is more of a policy-rant than a statement of what the law intends to do.
ModelUSGov,396bgq,Logic_85,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:23:21 2015 UTC,Well it enumerates the reasons why the United States should leave NAFTA.
ModelUSGov,396bgq,Oslovite,7,Tue Jun 9 22:24:18 2015 UTC,"NAFTA was disguised as a free trade agreement   Policy-based argument for which you provide no evidence   it overrides the rights of workers, consumers, and the future generations who cannot ""vote"" in the market on environmental issues   The same - what do you mean they can't vote?  The entire point of our economy is that people ""vote"" with their wallets.  Additionally, there are plenty of other laws addressing the environmental issues out there.   union organizing is essentially impossible   Also not justified by evidence - this is a very vague statement and adds nothing to the bill.   Corporations can operate internationally, but unions can't   Corporations operate internationally by subjecting their foreign operations to foreign law.  Unions can do the exact same--a union in the US cannot operate in Mexico, but a union can be formed in Mexico in accordance with Mexican law.    there's no way for the work force to fight back against the internationalization of production   So, globalization is bad?  I know it is a dicey issue but I wasn't aware of any party that took that stance.  What does this bill do to help workers at all?  If anything, it takes away from workers because of the job losses this bill will cause."

You lost an election on ModelUSGov, and you're all such sore losers that you decided to make a scene and try to eviscerate this subreddit by moving a bunch of people over and banning anyone that doesn't fit your economically liberal views.  And hell, I'm fine with it. Do what makes you happy. But Jesus Christ, stop coming over here to advertise your subreddit, stop coming over here with this melodramatic nonsense about how you're protecting the will of the people from the totalitarian socialist communist evil GLP regime! You're a bunch of sore losers who made a big fuss about going off to another subreddit because you didn't like that people different than you won an election. Drop this nonsensical pretense of fostering competition or protecting democracy when you're doing the exact opposite on your subreddit. No alternative parties are allowed to form, non-Democrat or Republican independents are not allowed to hold office, and many GLP members, including myself, were banned after making one comment or none at all and weren't given reason.

Also, the people of many territories have collectively voted to maintain territories under US military protection many times, as they then have semi autonomy over their island while not having to pay federal US income tax.

ModelUSGov,38tog8,Eilanyan,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:59:46 2015 UTC,"One of the ways the party has proposed so far (let's be honest, it's just me right now) is to make all new cars manufactured to be ""Flex Fuel"" (most already are or can be software altered to be so) and to have gas stations offer at least 2 different fuel types. That is increased regulation but is using market forces to lower prices and promote alternative (cleaner) fuel. It is using regulation to breka up the gasoline monopoly."

ModelUSGov,38tog8,utdude999,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:17:52 2015 UTC,"Because some cars are flex fuel but are intentionally disabled in software and theres almost not cost in making cars flex fuel so it is reasonable expectation.

ModelUSGov,38tog8,Duncs11,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:32:37 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, there are plenty of flex fuel cars on the road, and most cars are being made that way today.  The real restriction I've seen to having ethanol at the gas stations is that you need a seperate ethanol tank, and that can cost around $60,000 to install, which many gas station owners do not yet feel market pressure to install."

I know Puerto Rico does, but others don't (American Samoa, for instance). I'm glad this bill addresses that facet for some, but it needs to be consistent--don't force American Samoa but give the rest a vote.   However, I see that this bill begins with the removal of infrastructure from many military areas, I.e. Wake island. Does congress have power to shut down these facilities? The president is the commander in chief, and all congress does is appropriate funds to the military. These base closures have nothing to do with this bill and should be removed and debated separately."

I know that /u/laffytaffyboy's amendment (which I hope will be submitted soon) does precisely that and more, and will certainly get my full support."
ModelUSGov,38gx3j,Logic_85,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:23:10 2015 UTC,It could easily be done with a textual edit of Title VII - not requiring an entire amendment to the constitution.
ModelUSGov,38gx3j,laffytaffyboy,2,Thu Jun 4 19:25:19 2015 UTC,"While it could have been done with an edit, I think including equal rights regardless of sex (or gender, or sexual orientation) as a constitutional right issymbolically more important as well as supplying a solid reference for any Supreme Court cases that may arise.  Sorry if my spacing is off, I'm on my phone and it likes to remove and add random spaces."
ModelUSGov,38gx3j,Logic_85,2,Fri Jun 5 00:13:25 2015 UTC,"I won't argue with you there--if we want to make it an amendment and include sexual orientation/gender, I'm all for it. I just think if we are going to pass it we should do it right, and this amendment does not do it right."
ModelUSGov,38gx3j,TheRealRailguy,2,Fri Jun 5 06:04:09 2015 UTC,"Are these constitutional ammendments, and if they are, when and how should states vote on them?"
ModelUSGov,38gx3j,ExpiredAlphabits,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:40:03 2015 UTC,Yes they are. If they are passed by both the House and Senate by a 2/3 vote then 3/4 of the states must ratify the amendment. In order for a state to ratify the amendment it must be passed by the state legislature.
ModelUSGov,38gx3j,ExpiredAlphabits,2,Thu Jun 4 15:20:53 2015 UTC,Passing this absolutely destroys the verisimilitude of the simulation. Passing this will break ModelUSGov.
ModelUSGov,38gx3j,ExpiredAlphabits,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:14:42 2015 UTC,Well we are passing it as a constitutional amendment and not just a change in sub election rules. It's perfectly realistic as long as we do it through the structure of the US Government.
ModelUSGov,38gx3j,utdude999,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:41:19 2015 UTC,"There are certain aspects of the Constitution that this sub shouldn't change. On the extreme end, if the sub removes the executive branch, this sub ceases to be a simulation of the RL constitution. Changing the way citizens vote for representatives, while not as drastic, still ruins the link between this sub and the RL constitution. In short, if we change our model of what the constitution is, then we stop modeling the actual constitution. When we do that, we ruin the accuracy and relevance of the simulation."

ModelUSGov,389gk7,WellHeresMyFourthAcc,2,Tue Jun 2 21:27:00 2015 UTC,"THE UN IS OUT TO GET US, I TELL YOU!"
ModelUSGov,389gk7,Toby_Zeiger,11,Sat Jun 20 12:59:47 2015 UTC,Wouldn't this be violating the very UN charter we helped create? I don't want the United States to be forced from the UN due to some absurd attempt to score political capital.
ModelUSGov,389gk7,DidNotKnowThatLolz,9,Wed Jun 3 00:48:23 2015 UTC,"This will do nothing but alienate us with other nations within the UN. When working together with other nations on a peacekeeping mission, it is important that every soldier within the UN trusts each other."
ModelUSGov,389gk7,ehbrums1,13,Wed Jun 3 05:28:14 2015 UTC,I see this as nothing more as an extension of the American Service-Members' Protection Act and should be absolutely opposed. The United States needs to stop believing that they are justified in playing by a set of rules different to that of the international community.
ModelUSGov,389gk7,utdude999,6,Tue Jun 2 20:22:17 2015 UTC,"Hear, hear!"

ModelUSGov,389gk7,Hlafward,7,Tue Jun 2 20:55:09 2015 UTC,This feels like some nutter-butters Alex Jones legislation.

ModelUSGov,389gk7,RadioNone,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:17:25 2015 UTC,"Hey everybody, just doing my occasional browse through the subreddit.   This bill is very poorly formatted, could someone explain it to me? I gathered that it prohibits the US military from serving under any other foreign organisation, from the UN, to command under an international coalition, or something along those lines.  (It's late, the bills poorly formatted, so I can't be bothered to read it in huge detail)."
ModelUSGov,389gk7,schultejt,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:32:53 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that this bill is a replica of an IRL bill.
ModelUSGov,389gk7,RadioNone,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:53:44 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but am I right about the content?"
ModelUSGov,389gk7,schultejt,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:16:39 2015 UTC,"I believe the last section has to do with it being the burden of the military to prove that a disobeyed order was lawful rather than the duty of the accused to prove that it was unlawful.  The other sections, I believe, do not prohibit soldiers from serving under a foreign officer/wearing UN/foreign insignias, rather they protect soldiers who signed up to fight for the United States from being forced by the government to fight under another countries flag.  This could range from UN peacekeeping missions to the extreme of the government renting our troops out to foreign nations, much like the Hessians were rented to the British in the American Revolution."
ModelUSGov,389gk7,SomeRealShit,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:55:19 2015 UTC,"I like this bill, our armed forces swear an oath to the Constitution and should not be compelled to wear the symbol of any organization besides America."
ModelUSGov,389gk7,WellHeresMyFourthAcc,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:08:59 2015 UTC,This bill simply calls for the undoing of most of the work done by post-WWII American governments in the realm of international diplomacy. Isolationist attitudes disguised as constitutionalism are not the way to go. This is also not an issue of involuntary servitude any more than being specifically assigned a role within the US military is.

ModelUSGov,380rhr,Nightwinga,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:14:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not as much as I used to though. This subreddit looks pretty cool. The server got a few upgrades and is poised to get a few more, so I think I'll start to play more again."
ModelUSGov,37ybi8,SeptimusSette,6,Sun May 31 12:42:31 2015 UTC,"I share /u/Eilanyan's concern that while this gives Congress the power to regulate money in campaigns, there's no way to be sure that Congress actually does. Still, even giving Congress the power is a big step forward.  Also, how will this be implemented in the simulation?"
ModelUSGov,37ybi8,jacoby531,2,Sun May 31 13:59:54 2015 UTC,Congress could not pass the Disclose Act. Trusting the same corrupt system to regulate itself is a pointless effort and disappointing considering the measure is using a constitutional amendment to do so.
ModelUSGov,37ybi8,Eilanyan,6,Sun May 31 15:10:38 2015 UTC,Give the same people who get the money to control how much they can get is a terrible idea.
ModelUSGov,37ybi8,Eilanyan,4,Sun May 31 13:27:41 2015 UTC,So we're going to let the people who accept campaign donations be the ones to regulate how much they can receive? seems an awful idea
ModelUSGov,37ybi8,ehbrums1,5,Sun May 31 17:29:02 2015 UTC,"Prior to the decision in Citizens United, there was already limits set in place in campaign finance. Only within the past ~15 years have we seen the floodgates open when it comes to campaign finance. I'd like to think that if this were passed (IRL) there would be enough support from both sides to make reasonable limits on campaign donations. In the context of the simulation, there certainly is support to limit campaign contributions."
ModelUSGov,37ybi8,DidNotKnowThatLolz,3,Sun May 31 20:30:36 2015 UTC,"Put the power of state elections in the hands of the states, I like the idea"
ModelUSGov,37ybi8,SomeRealShit,2,Sun May 31 20:04:29 2015 UTC,I would like to see public financing of elections. How would this affect this topic?
ModelUSGov,37ybi8,ben1204,2,Sun May 31 17:08:53 2015 UTC,Congress has more power to implement public financing but also more power to block it.
ModelUSGov,37ybi8,Eilanyan,1 point,Sun May 31 18:17:35 2015 UTC,"The states would be able to enact public financing if they so choose, as could Congress for federal elections."
ModelUSGov,37ybi8,Didicet,2,Mon Jun 1 05:37:56 2015 UTC,When should this be submitted to state legislators to be voted on?

ModelUSGov,37ybi8,DidNotKnowThatLolz,2,Thu Jun 4 15:42:20 2015 UTC,I love the idea of this amendment
ModelUSGov,37ybi8,Eilanyan,3,Sun May 31 16:42:49 2015 UTC,You really should be commenting as your main account and not this alt.
ModelUSGov,37ybi8,Eilanyan,1 point,Sun May 31 20:40:03 2015 UTC,Not quite sure what is meant by vote. Does this not override Congress?
ModelUSGov,37ybi8,laffytaffyboy,1 point,Sun May 31 20:05:50 2015 UTC,"Yea, this doesn't go to congress. It should either be ratified by 3/4 of the state's legislators or by 3/4 of state conventions."
ModelUSGov,37ybi8,cmac__17,1 point,Sun May 31 20:18:46 2015 UTC,"You see, my fear here is that if one party were to have a majority in both houses, as well as the presidency, or a supermajority on both houses, then they could effectively ""starve"" the opposing candidates out of financial backing enough to perpetuate their own power.  As such, if this is to pass in its current state, I would have to rule against its constitutionality."
ModelUSGov,37ybi8,Didicet,5,Mon Jun 1 02:55:42 2015 UTC,"It would be an amendment of the constitution, preventing it from being unconstitutional."
ModelUSGov,37ybi8,Zachrist,5,Mon Jun 1 05:38:54 2015 UTC,"If passed it would be part of the Constitution, so it would not be possible to rule it unconstitutional."
ModelUSGov,37ybi8,DidNotKnowThatLolz,3,Mon Jun 1 08:09:56 2015 UTC,"If the ruling party were to ""starve"" opposing parties, would they not be doing this to themselves as well since they are also limiting the amount of money they could get?"
ModelUSGov,37ybi8,cmac__17,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:13:30 2015 UTC,Depends on the legislation they passed.

ModelUSGov,37x46x,oughton42,1 point,Sun May 31 04:36:12 2015 UTC,"That's a good question. BSDDC would have been the tiebreaking vote (and they almost certainly would've voted nay or not at all). We don't have a new Speaker yet, so since their is no one to cast the deciding vote, there's probably no way to break the tie. The single late vote was a yea, but that doesn't mean anything."
ModelUSGov,37x46x,oughton42,2,Sun May 31 04:40:32 2015 UTC,This is correct. There is no way to break the tie so the bill fails.
ModelUSGov,37x46x,Gohte,2,Sun May 31 20:18:07 2015 UTC,"Finally, you can see the voting results here."

ModelUSGov,37ijzs,IBiteYou,5,Thu May 28 01:24:09 2015 UTC,That comment you replied to has nothing to do with you at all. Your reply was purely antagonistic.
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,lsma,5,Thu May 28 01:29:57 2015 UTC,No.  Just honest.
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,bluefisch200,7,Thu May 28 01:32:23 2015 UTC,"I started model stuff right in the middle of this drama.  I have chosen MUSGOV, because I think party caps are necessary.  I hope MUSGOV is not stigmatized for the rest of its existence just because of this misunderstanding."
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,oughton42,3,Fri May 29 02:10:29 2015 UTC,"MUSGOV is not part of the official model world. If you like unrealistic caps that do not exist in the USA than never mind, if you like an interesting sub where we do not just copy what happens IRL and actually simulate something ModelUsGov is where you go."
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,Eilanyan,6,Fri May 29 06:34:13 2015 UTC,Perhaps we could temporarily increase the subscriber limit of subreddits that can be advertised to in order to get a quick growth? Obviously this would be just for the Republicans so the other Parties can't abuse this.
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,DidNotKnowThatLolz,3,Wed May 27 22:13:42 2015 UTC,We are doing something about this.
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,Eilanyan,4,Wed May 27 22:15:04 2015 UTC,"It was my understand that the seceding party was leaving /r/ModelRepublicans behind as well. Why does a new one need to be created? (I note there is a subscript so will edit/delete if that answers question). Also, is there a special state law for why IBY seat is automatically going to Republican and not governor appointment?"
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,Libertarian-Party,6,Wed May 27 22:04:04 2015 UTC,Mods do not have control of that sub.
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,oughton42,2,Wed May 27 22:05:29 2015 UTC,2adamstoon is claiming that they will use it for MUSGOV.
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,johker216,5,Wed May 27 22:06:30 2015 UTC,"Okay, that is strange as MUSGOV Repubs will now have two similar subs but that's not my business."
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,Eilanyan,7,Wed May 27 22:07:53 2015 UTC,The reason I stay in this sub is due to my commitment to Maintain the libertarian party which is not allowed in the other simulation.   Unless you are implying the Republicans join the libertarians. I'm all for that
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,DidNotKnowThatLolz,4,Wed May 27 22:10:54 2015 UTC,"Unless things get really desperate, I think we should continue to keep the Libertarians separate, too. As the situation is now, there's no reason to lose two parties."
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,WJacobC,1 point,Wed May 27 22:40:00 2015 UTC,"The only issue we'll have with former Republicans joining the Party will be an internal inconsistency of the party platform. This isn't a major issue at all, because it will help us to unify our views (the main reason for our failure during the last election) and carve a niche out that will help us to attract members of the other parties. I will take issue, however, if there is no Republican Party left; their existence is necessary to a free and open simulation that allows for members of all views to have an actionable voice."
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,cameronc65,4,Wed May 27 23:05:09 2015 UTC,How will this affect legislature?
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,WJacobC,2,Thu May 28 12:54:36 2015 UTC,At the moment we are going to be focused on making sure all seats left vacant by this are filled.
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,cameronc65,5,Wed May 27 22:33:21 2015 UTC,"This is unfortunate, but I look forward to future successes of the Republican Party. Hopefully we can find resolution to this situation, rebuild the party, and continue to enjoy the simulation."
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,Timanfya,6,Wed May 27 22:51:04 2015 UTC,Are you and Connachttheblue going to stay and rebuild?
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,IBiteYou,6,Wed May 27 22:14:53 2015 UTC,I believe so. We both wish to continue participating in this simulation.
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,WJacobC,3,Wed May 27 22:25:32 2015 UTC,That would be great.
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,2adamstoon,6,Wed May 27 22:28:59 2015 UTC,It is a great shame that your subreddit was taken and the entire contents removed. I will work with /u/SeptimusSette to help you rebuild.   The appalling actions of the old republicans pour great shame onto MUSGOV.
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,Timanfya,5,Wed May 27 22:30:17 2015 UTC,Why do you seek to try to blame MUSGOV for what the Republicans here decided to do?  Many folks on MUSGOV were not remotely involved in it.
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,2adamstoon,5,Wed May 27 22:30:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you, this entire situation is rather unfortunate."
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,keypuncher,8,Thu May 28 00:45:25 2015 UTC,"It is a great shame that a mod does not recognize that we first tried to talk to you about it, yet some mods ignored our concerns.   This led to a vote which was nearly unanimous... 16-1 in favor of leaving."
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,CrossBowGuy237,5,Wed May 27 22:33:39 2015 UTC,"The vote contained 17 votes - you have more than 17 members.  By all means those 16 that wanted to leave should leave.  But taking the subreddit, forcing all members into the other place and deleting all of the content is disgraceful."
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,keypuncher,3,Wed May 27 22:41:30 2015 UTC,"This is why people that don't have much information about our party should hold an opinion like that.  If you've noticed that is actually the most active we have been in a while. We usually have a lesser number of people that truly are active, and the rest are just the people of the old...  In keypuncher and my tenure, I'd say this is the most active we have been... You will probably say... ""Well you've done fairly well in the elections."" That's the result of advertising."
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,CrossBowGuy237,4,Wed May 27 22:42:43 2015 UTC,"Most of the members gave up after it became obvious that the mods had decided to make this simulation nothing like a simulation of the US government at all.  I am among them, and only popped my head in occasionally when specifically asked to.  I warned at the beginning of my participation in ModelUSGov that there were glaring problems with the way it was set up - rather than fix them, the mods chose to make them an order of magnitude worse.  As moderators of the subreddit, that is certainly their right - but it doesn't mean that everyone is going to go along.  The shutdown of the Republican Party in this simulation is not as sudden as you think it is."
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,IBiteYou,3,Wed May 27 23:17:53 2015 UTC,Are you aware that there are other ways to play simulations?
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,CrossBowGuy237,7,Wed May 27 23:45:04 2015 UTC,"Are you aware that there are other ways to play simulations?   Sure - but if you bill a simulation as a US Civil War simulation and then introduce ICBMs and space-based weapons systems, and talking polar bears as a third faction, the people who joined expecting to take part in the strategy of a US Civil War are going to lose interest and wander off."
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,IBiteYou,2,Wed May 27 23:50:51 2015 UTC,I guess you could think of it as a communist super pac supporting the Green Party.
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,Timanfya,4,Wed May 27 23:54:51 2015 UTC,Are you aware that there are other ways to play simulations?   Like pretending to be one thing and then suddenly morphing into something completely different?
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,IBiteYou,3,Thu May 28 00:06:20 2015 UTC,"Touche for yourself, acting your age, then acting my age."
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,DidNotKnowThatLolz,4,Thu May 28 00:46:30 2015 UTC,"Could you elaborate?  What appalling actions?  The contents of the subreddit belonged to the party, which voted overwhelmingly to secede.  Why would you think that the ""new"" Republicans should have access to any of the old content?"
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,Timanfya,9,Thu May 28 00:52:07 2015 UTC,"Deleting the contents of a subreddit that belongs to this subreddit.  There were 17 votes, you have many more members than that. You've physically denied people in that subreddit the right to participate in this proper model government because you've taken the sub and removed mod permissions.  There are already 3 Republicans from your time staying here - you've deleted their content."
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,IBiteYou,5,Wed May 27 22:41:04 2015 UTC,"Deleting the contents of a subreddit that belongs to this subreddit.   You HONESTLY think you were entitled to people's comments?  You were entitled to the content?  It's not enough that a leaker was sending screenshots of our content to people?  Why do you think that the content was property of yours?  Why do those 3 Republicans ... two of which are probably people that were banned...and if you would like to discuss why, I'll be happy to in a pm...why do those three people need the content of the subreddit?"
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,IBiteYou,7,Wed May 27 22:44:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you are not using it anymore what is the problem?"
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,Timanfya,3,Wed May 27 22:49:01 2015 UTC,Exactly!  They've cleared the subreddit of all contents and are telling people to join the other republican subreddit --> http://www.reddit.com/r/MUSGOV/comments/37iip3/welcome_members_of_the_republican_party/  It is disgraceful.
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,IBiteYou,2,Wed May 27 22:54:01 2015 UTC,"What, exactly is disgraceful?  That the mods would seek to protect the private communications of Republicans from being leaked screenshot by screenshot to other people by deleting the content?  And I don't know why you are so angry at me.  I didn't know it was going to be done... but I don't blame people for doing it.  As I said above, I did not have full permissions as a mod, only ""access."""
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,Timanfya,3,Wed May 27 22:57:48 2015 UTC,"I, personally, had no idea that the content was going to be deleted until it was done.  Do you want your communications within the Democratic Party subreddit to be distributed to everyone?  Because we DID have a leaker who was sending screenshots to folks outside the party.  Considering this, I am not at all surprised that someone made the decision to delete the content.  Also ... I do not have the ability to do anything like that.  Though I was listed as a mod, I only had ""access""... not full permissions."
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,evanb_,4,Wed May 27 23:05:58 2015 UTC,The members of the subreddit are entitled to the contents of the subreddit.    Why are you still here?
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,ConnachttheBlue,3,Wed May 27 23:03:58 2015 UTC,"The members of the subreddit are entitled to the contents of the subreddit.    The members of the subreddit voted quite overwhelmingly to remove themselves from ModelUSGov.  As it stands, content was being leaked to people outside the subreddit.   Why are you still here?   Why not?  I'm being accused hijacking the subreddit when I didn't even have full permissions.  I had no idea the content was going to be deleted, I'm just not surprised that it was.  If you'd like to ban me, then you are free to do so.  As it stands, I've already resigned my Senate seat.  I thought that was the honorable thing to do and frankly, it was a long time coming.  I slept so well last night."
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,cameronc65,6,Wed May 27 22:50:30 2015 UTC,No they didn't.  The vote was only up for a very short time and it was conducted by an incredibly bias mod; who knows if the results are actually truthful. After this behaviour I certainly wouldn't trust him.  What magical devices do you think we have that allow us to find out who was behind the leak?  You don't need full permissions to delete the content and remove mods below you.
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,Timanfya,2,Wed May 27 23:09:15 2015 UTC,The subreddit wasn't taken.
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,cameronc65,5,Wed May 27 23:12:16 2015 UTC,"Definitely. At this point, nothing can stop me from participating."
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,Canadianman22,4,Thu May 28 00:44:33 2015 UTC,Great!
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,cameronc65,3,Wed May 27 22:32:46 2015 UTC,Good to hear!
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,Canadianman22,4,Wed May 27 22:33:22 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I agree with IBiteYou's seat going to a Republican. When we lost your seat due to special circumstances we weren't afforded an automatic return of it to the GLP.
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,risen2011,9,Wed May 27 22:37:05 2015 UTC,"While I am no longer Governor, I fully support my former fellow Governor /u/Zachrist from the Western State being given their RIGHT as Governor, elected by the people, to select any member they feel will be represent their people.   The precedent was set when I selected a member to replace the outgoing senator, and it would be unfair to change it now.  As I see it, the mods have 2 choices:  1) Allow the Western State governor the free reign I had to choose anyone they wish, regardless of party affiliation.  2) Overturn my selection, de-seat the individual I appointed, implement the new rule of governors being required to select a member from the outgoing senators party, and force all Governors to select appropriate members.  EDIT: Added Governors name"
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,cameronc65,3,Wed May 27 22:27:39 2015 UTC,"Wow, I'm glad to see your backing on this."
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,IBiteYou,3,Wed May 27 23:30:40 2015 UTC,"How could I not? Sure I am not a huge GLP fan and vice versa but I am a massive states fan, and the realistic nature of states is that the Governor of the state is given the authority to appoint without requirements such as party. The only restriction (At least on me and IRL) is that the person selected is a resident of that state. If that rule is no longer in effect, then the Western State Governor /u/Zachrist should not be forced to do something while I was not.  I absolutely stand with the Governors on this, and their right to appoint anyone they wish.  EDIT: added Governors name"
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,cameronc65,5,Wed May 27 23:35:55 2015 UTC,"IBY's s seat should be given to a person of the governor's choosing in order to maintain consistency on this subreddit. However, all other vacancies should be allotted to republicans."
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,IBiteYou,7,Wed May 27 23:40:55 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, why not maintain the order we've established? Give the senate seats to their governors, give th house seats to their parties."
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,IBiteYou,5,Wed May 27 22:44:56 2015 UTC,The only reason that the seat is being promised to a Republican is to encourage Republicans to stay here and try to get appointed to it.
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,Gohte,4,Wed May 27 22:47:09 2015 UTC,Does this mean all the Republican seats will be maintained?
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,cameronc65,3,Wed May 27 22:41:56 2015 UTC,I have no idea what will happen.  I'm just speculating that the promise is a carrot to encourage Republicans to stay here.
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,cmac__17,3,Wed May 27 22:44:15 2015 UTC,When I resigned I did so with the full expectation that the Governor would appoint an anti-capitalist.
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,ben1204,7,Wed May 27 22:45:22 2015 UTC,My only concern is figuring out how the hell we're gonna explain this in-character

ModelUSGov,37ijzs,Hlafward,2,Thu May 28 11:50:28 2015 UTC,We are reaching out to republican representatives to find out.
ModelUSGov,37ijzs,houinator,3,Thu May 28 03:06:43 2015 UTC,"Good Godchild, this sub looks so hateful. I think I would participate more if there was less drama. But then we'd lose authenticity."

ModelUSGov,37imzc,cameronc65,1 point,Thu May 28 17:45:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, it will be open for submissions for a few days."
ModelUSGov,37imzc,Timanfya,6,Thu May 28 18:45:52 2015 UTC,We need to do something more clear than the join a party thread - if we advertise we don't want to lose subscribers because of unclearness.
ModelUSGov,37imzc,Timanfya,4,Wed May 27 23:12:35 2015 UTC,I think we should add party platforms to the wiki and add a link to them in the sidebar. I will be talking to the other mods about this.
ModelUSGov,37imzc,Eilanyan,2,Wed May 27 23:15:57 2015 UTC,That's a great idea.
ModelUSGov,37imzc,Timanfya,5,Wed May 27 23:24:22 2015 UTC,You are actually featured on the MHOC advert already :p
ModelUSGov,37imzc,Xarasystral,5,Wed May 27 22:26:46 2015 UTC,Ours will have /r/ModelUSGov front and centerUS>Britain

ModelUSGov,37imzc,WJacobC,3,Wed May 27 23:16:57 2015 UTC,It's a good start! I think you should add something about debating and legislating so that it is more clear what we do here. I think a very good example is the MHOC ad.
ModelUSGov,37imzc,ConnachttheBlue,2,Wed May 27 23:19:37 2015 UTC,That MHOC ad is fantastic.
ModelUSGov,37imzc,cameronc65,1 point,Thu May 28 03:16:25 2015 UTC,"From a design standpoint, I think a simpler ad would be more effective. It's an excellent starting point though!"

ModelUSGov,37imzc,autowikibot,3,Wed May 27 22:26:22 2015 UTC,Very good idea.
ModelUSGov,37imzc,Zachrist,3,Wed May 27 22:33:24 2015 UTC,How much does an advert cost?

ModelUSGov,37gft3,Logic_85,4,Wed May 27 23:08:49 2015 UTC,"This proposed amendment seems simple, elegant, and will prove useful in defending the equal rights of the citizens of America."
ModelUSGov,37gft3,WJacobC,2,Wed May 27 15:56:26 2015 UTC,Agreed.
ModelUSGov,37gft3,cameronc65,3,Wed May 27 17:43:46 2015 UTC,"I think this would be good, However I think it needs to include sexual orientation and gender identity.  Other then that I think it is a fantastic amendment."

ModelUSGov,37gft3,laffytaffyboy,2,Wed May 27 14:34:47 2015 UTC,"Can the ""New Equal Rights Amendment"" submitted by the GLP be read as well? The proposed amendments are very similar and I believe it will be better to debate them both at the same time."

ModelUSGov,37e38r,SeptimusSette,2,Wed May 27 00:36:35 2015 UTC,"Well, best of luck in law school. Wanna get into Congress one day /u/bsddc ? ;)"
ModelUSGov,37e38r,2adamstoon,2,Wed May 27 07:42:38 2015 UTC,"Ha ha, one can only hope!"
ModelUSGov,37e38r,SeptimusSette,1 point,Wed May 27 19:30:11 2015 UTC,Dunno if this motivates you ... or this.
ModelUSGov,37e38r,2adamstoon,2,Wed May 27 19:40:23 2015 UTC,Gohte was banned.
ModelUSGov,37e38r,Timanfya,2,Wed May 27 21:32:25 2015 UTC,What was this?
ModelUSGov,37e38r,IBiteYou,2,Wed May 27 21:59:43 2015 UTC,GOP member saying the mod (Sep) were banning GOP posters but not members of their own party.
ModelUSGov,37e38r,Timanfya,1 point,Thu May 28 04:52:27 2015 UTC,Off topic
ModelUSGov,37e38r,IBiteYou,1 point,Thu May 28 05:19:01 2015 UTC,"Actually no, I had to post it in here somewhere because a mix would refuse to post our official declaration from our Party."
ModelUSGov,37e38r,jacoby531,4,Thu May 28 04:48:28 2015 UTC,"Note to the Republican chair, I will need access to your subreddit now that BSDDC has left."
ModelUSGov,37e38r,IBiteYou,9,Thu May 28 11:16:30 2015 UTC,"Timanfya has access to the subreddit and he is a mod.  If that is not sufficient, when a Republican mod is chosen, that mod can have access to the subreddit."
ModelUSGov,37e38r,Timanfya,5,Tue May 26 23:38:19 2015 UTC,"/u/Timanfya is not a mod, he is an advisor."
ModelUSGov,37e38r,IBiteYou,5,Wed May 27 00:15:45 2015 UTC,"Alright, when a Republican mod is chosen, that mod can have access to the subreddit."
ModelUSGov,37e38r,SeptimusSette,6,Wed May 27 00:32:04 2015 UTC,Septimus is not part of a party and he is a neutral head moderator.   You cannot refuse the head moderator rights to the subreddit.
ModelUSGov,37e38r,IBiteYou,4,Wed May 27 00:32:55 2015 UTC,"Septimus may have cast off his ""official"" membership in a party, but he is very much still a green/left.  The agreement was that the mods who got access to the subreddits would be mods from the political party."
ModelUSGov,37e38r,Timanfya,6,Wed May 27 00:44:16 2015 UTC,"Nonsense. He gave up party membership, it doesn't matter what you believe because he has.   He's now the neutral head moderator of thus subreddit and needs access to the party subreddits in order to ensure that everything is going on as it should."
ModelUSGov,37e38r,Didicet,3,Wed May 27 00:45:52 2015 UTC,"It's not nonsense at all.   He gave up party membership, it doesn't matter what you believe because he has...   Will he be voting in elections?  I'm sorry to be butting heads with you... but Septimus specifically has been the focus of concerns about mod bias in this simulation.   He's now the neutral head moderator of thus subreddit   He's the head mod now?  Seems like a couple of weeks ago he was just a clerk.  When was the head mod announcement made?  Did I miss it?  Was there a vote?  Because really, there should have been a vote on something that important.   needs access to the party subreddits in order to ensure that everything is going on as it should   Well, I'm sorry... but you must also consider that our party was recently targeted BY Septimus here on the main subreddit.  We're a tad skeptical.  Maybe we can either settle for the fact that two members of the current mod team here have access to the subreddit, or we can make the choice of a Republican to be a moderator really quickly.  As Septimus said... I guess we'll just be unofficial for now."
ModelUSGov,37e38r,2adamstoon,5,Wed May 27 00:47:26 2015 UTC,I believe Septimus became the head mod when lort deleted his account.
ModelUSGov,37e38r,cameronc65,2,Wed May 27 00:52:11 2015 UTC,"Why not BSDDC?  But the point is... there was no announcement that we had a new ""head mod"".  There was no vote or discussion.  And again ... two people over ------> there in the mod team have access to the Republican subreddit."
ModelUSGov,37e38r,cameronc65,4,Wed May 27 00:56:36 2015 UTC,"What does it matter if he votes in elections? I vote in all mhoc elections does that make me a biased speaker?  Septimus is the guy who runs the whole thing, of course he is the head mod.   Where were you targetted by him?"
ModelUSGov,37e38r,Gohte,2,Wed May 27 01:04:45 2015 UTC,"Septimus is the guy who runs the whole thing, of course he is the head mod.    He literally demoted himself to clerk a couple of weeks ago.  Then Lort got chased out by green/lefts.  I dunno, maybe he gets to be head mod simply because everyone else has left.... but last I knew, he was not ""head mod.""  I guess it is good to know now that he now, ""runs the whole thing.""   Where were you targetted by him?    http://www.reddit.com/r/ModelUSGov/comments/371p8o/mod_statement_on_uconnacttheblue_and_uwjacobc/  He wrote this without knowing all of the facts involved in the situation.  We are discussing it here.  http://www.reddit.com/r/ModelUSGovPress/comments/37bffa/interference_in_party_business_and_selective_rule/  Now ... I don't know if you are a biased speaker.  Do others in the MHOC say or think you are a biased speaker?  Because there are a number of us in this simulation who have felt that Septimus has been a biased mod."
ModelUSGov,37e38r,cameronc65,1 point,Wed May 27 00:57:20 2015 UTC,Your subreddit will be considered unofficial until then. There needs to be an active moderator with access.
ModelUSGov,37e38r,cameronc65,5,Wed May 27 01:02:49 2015 UTC,That is entirely unreasonable and you know it.  Both Timanfya and Rorytime have access to our subreddit.  You are a green/left.  Your green/left colleagues would NEVER put up with allowing a Republican to have access to their party subreddit.
ModelUSGov,37e38r,HammerAndPotato,5,Wed May 27 00:34:02 2015 UTC,Septimus is not part of a party and he is a neutral head moderator.   You cannot refuse the head moderator rights to the subreddit.
ModelUSGov,37e38r,jsmith18486,5,Wed May 27 00:40:23 2015 UTC,"He may be de jure unaffiliated with a party, but unofficially, I have major doubts as to his impartiality.   As well, it seems odd he automagically became the supposed head mod. I would prefer you become the official head mod."
ModelUSGov,37e38r,oughton42,4,Wed May 27 00:44:24 2015 UTC,I hope to be able to address this issue tomorrow.
ModelUSGov,37e38r,idYdtHY,2,Wed May 27 01:04:23 2015 UTC,What does that mean?
ModelUSGov,37e38r,Gohte,2,Wed May 27 00:43:29 2015 UTC,Probably not - I'd suggest deleting it.
ModelUSGov,37elg7,SeptimusSette,8,Wed May 27 01:39:23 2015 UTC,"It's going to be hard to find a replacement that will be quite the force of nature you were.  Best of luck to you, /u/IBiteYou."

ModelUSGov,37elg7,laffytaffyboy,4,Wed May 27 02:19:09 2015 UTC,"No.  I was not banned.  I just can't post here on the subreddit, which is where I might have placed my resignation announcement."
ModelUSGov,37elg7,IBiteYou,5,Wed May 27 02:20:30 2015 UTC,My bad.
ModelUSGov,37elg7,laffytaffyboy,2,Wed May 27 02:21:02 2015 UTC,No problem.
ModelUSGov,37elg7,IBiteYou,3,Wed May 27 02:21:28 2015 UTC,I think she simply meant she could not post it in this sub.

ModelUSGov,37dnw3,SeptimusSette,8,Tue May 26 21:33:59 2015 UTC,I really appreciate the mods being open and transparent with the actions they take and the reasons why.
ModelUSGov,37dnw3,WJacobC,6,Tue May 26 22:03:40 2015 UTC,I like the overview of mod actions.
ModelUSGov,37dnw3,cameronc65,3,Tue May 26 21:42:58 2015 UTC,Capitol Club is seriously threatened with extinction.
ModelUSGov,37dnw3,JerryLeRow,3,Wed May 27 07:44:39 2015 UTC,And the bombshells keep coming. Hopefully Mod situation will resolve quickly and fairly.

ModelUSGov,37dnw3,SomeOfTheTimes,6,Wed May 27 00:29:24 2015 UTC,You were banned from the party for suggesting that we cheat by creating alts in other parties. I will not be lifting the ban as of now. If you wish to appeal the ban I would talk to the head mod.
ModelUSGov,37dnw3,DidNotKnowThatLolz,1 point,Wed May 27 01:18:22 2015 UTC,My ban was successfully appealed by the head mod. That is why I'm asking to be let back in. How else would I be commenting here?
ModelUSGov,37dnw3,SomeOfTheTimes,3,Wed May 27 01:29:57 2015 UTC,"I didn't know you were banned from the general subreddit. However, you still suggested cheating, so I will not be letting you back into the party. This is a party ban and not a general ban, so you may still participate in this subreddit. Again if you think this is unfair, I would speak to the head mod."
ModelUSGov,37dnw3,DidNotKnowThatLolz,1 point,Wed May 27 01:58:15 2015 UTC,I was banned from both for the same reason. Does the ban not get collapsed when the head subreddit is banned?
ModelUSGov,37dnw3,SomeOfTheTimes,7,Wed May 27 02:06:59 2015 UTC,It's at the party's discretion as to whether they'd like to let you in or not.
ModelUSGov,37dnw3,cameronc65,1 point,Wed May 27 02:09:18 2015 UTC,Ugh. Seriously? I was banned for making a suggestion.
ModelUSGov,37dnw3,SomeOfTheTimes,3,Wed May 27 03:18:58 2015 UTC,"I mean, theoretically the party can ban you for whatever they want. The sub can't, but the parties can. You'd have to work out your want to join again with them."
ModelUSGov,37dnw3,cameronc65,1 point,Wed May 27 03:20:59 2015 UTC,Ugh. Anyone want to add me to their party? I'm a hard worker who writes good bills!
ModelUSGov,37dnw3,SomeOfTheTimes,3,Wed May 27 03:59:03 2015 UTC,"Well, ""good"" bills are subjective unless you mean good prose. I think the Dems are party most likely to accept someone focused on admin then ideology."

I can not support this, it is too complicated and our Founding Fathers did not want the Government to have political parties involved, let alone in our Constitution.

ModelUSGov,375cr5,dreasdif118,11,Mon May 25 00:50:44 2015 UTC,"A popular vote would make everyone's vote equal, unlike the electoral college, which is extremely disproportional."

ModelUSGov,375cr5,jacoby531,3,Mon May 25 01:11:02 2015 UTC,That was the point of having both the House and the Senate. The House gave the power to the bigger States and the Senate to the smaller ones so it would be balanced.

If a candidate got every vote from every person living in every one of the USA's 100 biggest cities, all the way down to Spokane with a population of 209,000, they would only have 19.4% of the total vote. If a candidate campaigned the way you described, they would lose in a landslide."

ModelUSGov,375cr5,IBiteYou,1 point,Mon May 25 17:19:16 2015 UTC,"Certainly. However, the writings of Marx are far better than those of, say, James Madison, who had this to say about the purpose of the government of the United States:   The man who is possessed of wealth, who lolls on his sofa or rolls in his carriage, cannot judge the wants or feelings of the day-laborer. The government we mean to erect is intended to last for ages. The landed interest, at present, is prevalent; but in process of time, when we approximate to the states and kingdoms of Europe, — when the number of landholders shall be comparatively small, through the various means of trade and manufactures, will not the landed interest be overbalanced in future elections, and unless wisely provided against, what will become of your government? In England, at this day, if elections were open to all classes of people, the property of landed proprietors would be insecure. An agrarian law would soon take place. If these observations be just, our government ought to secure the permanent interests of the country against innovation. Landholders ought to have a share in the government, to support these invaluable interests, and to balance and check the other. They ought to be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority. The senate, therefore, ought to be this body; and to answer these purposes, they ought to have permanency and stability.   It certainly ""transcends time,"" as you so say it, and certainly not in a good way."
ModelUSGov,375cr5,laffytaffyboy,3,Mon May 25 19:29:19 2015 UTC,"I very much admire the Founders for what they put in place. They were not perfect men by a modern context, but they were good men in their time.   If we want to go into personality, I'd like to remind you that most of them were slaveowners.  That aside, admiring them is one thing and governing according to their wishes (more like one's interpretation of their wishes since they're long dead) is another. The latter is dogma. I believe it was Thomas Jefferson who wrote that the constitution should be rewritten every 19 years so that new generations wouldn't be held back by the laws of the previous one."

As were many men of their time.   governing according to their wishes    You mean The Constitution?  The supreme legal document of the land which has, occasionally, been amended as required?  Governing according to the Constitution is dogma?  I don't think so at all.   In an 1816 letter to Virginia lawyer Samuel Kercheval on the subject of calling a convention to revise the state's constitution, Jefferson stated that a constitution should be revised every 19 to 20 years. Jefferson's proposed time period was based on the era's mortality rate. Since a majority of adults at any point in time would likely be dead in approximately 19 years, he reasoned, a new generation should have the right to adapt its government to changing circumstances instead of being ruled by the past.   As I mentioned, there is a process for amending the Constitution."

Things have changed immensely in that amount of time; their worldviews are no longer relevant."
ModelUSGov,375cr5,IBiteYou,2,Mon May 25 19:04:28 2015 UTC,"Of course. As were many men of their time.   There were also abolitionists at the time. My point is that there is no reason why they should posthumously dictate the policies of the United States today, and certainly not because of their personality.   You mean The Constitution? The supreme legal document of the land which has, occasionally, been amended as required? Governing according to the Constitution is dogma? I don't think so at all.   There should be a constitution. That's not what I'm saying. It's this ""let's do what the Founding Fathers would have wanted"" response that is a dogma. Amendments don't change the fact that it's the same constitution.  Jefferson also wrote to Madison on the notion of rewriting the constitution every 19 years:   On similar ground it may be proved that no society can make a perpetual constitution, or even a perpetual law. The earth belongs always to the living generation. They may manage it then, and what proceeds from it, as they please, during their usufruct. They are masters too of their own persons, and consequently may govern them as they please. But persons and property make the sum of the objects of government. The constitution and the laws of their predecessors extinguished then in their natural course with those who gave them being. This could preserve that being till it ceased to be itself, and no longer. Every constitution then, and every law, naturally expires at the end of 19 years. If it be enforced longer, it is an act of force, and not of right.   Source  Not just revising the constitution, but rewriting it altogether."
ModelUSGov,375cr5,Gohte,1 point,Mon May 25 03:26:35 2015 UTC,"It's this ""let's do what the Founding Fathers would have wanted"" response that is a dogma.    I think De Toqueville wrote very eloquently on the possibility of the tyranny of the majority.   Amendments don't change the fact that it's the same constitution.   Once you amend it, it is not the same Constitution.  It's amended.  That is what Jefferson meant, I believe.  He used the 19 years number because of life expectancy at the time.  He said that the Constitution should be revisited and amended, if necessary.  He did NOT mean that 19 years after the Constitution was written, it was invalid.  Now... I understand that many in your party despise many of the things in the Constitution since it sets up the very state that you loathe, but Jefferson was not suggesting a major rewrite of the Constitution every 19 years."

ModelUSGov,375cr5,laffytaffyboy,5,Mon May 25 01:27:41 2015 UTC,"Because, they wrote the Constitution to guarantee rights to the citizens and that must be lived up to. Also, we should not overhaul our system with another that would not work."

ModelUSGov,375cr5,Zeria0308,5,Mon May 25 01:00:39 2015 UTC,I completely agree with this concern. It is not clear enough for it to be instituted yet.

Does this not mean that the method (or manner) of vote counting could be changed by legislative measure?

ModelUSGov,375cr5,Zeria0308,6,Mon May 25 01:06:35 2015 UTC,Yes you are exactly right. This type of overhaul can not be written into a short paragraph like this Amendment does. It would be very long.
ModelUSGov,375cr5,IBiteYou,1 point,Mon May 25 01:10:01 2015 UTC,"Does this not mean that the method (or manner) of vote counting could be changed by legislative measure?   For Representatives, yes. See also Foster v. Love, 522 U.S. 67 (1997):   The Clause is a default provision; it invests the States with responsibility for the mechanics of congressional elections, see Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 730 (1974), but only so far as Congress declines to pre-empt state legislative choices, see Roudebush v. Hartke, 405 U.S. 15, 24 (1972) (“Unless Congress acts, Art. I, §4, empowers the States to regulate”). Thus it is well settled that the Elections Clause grants Congress “the power to override state regulations” by establishing uniform rules for federal elections, binding on the States. U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U.S. 779, 832—833 (1995). “[T]he regulations made by Congress are paramount to those made by the State legislature; and if they conflict therewith, the latter, so far as the conflict extends, ceases to be operative.” Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371, 384 (1880).   For presidential elections (here section 1) no.   Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.

ModelUSGov,375cr5,jacoby531,3,Mon May 25 09:45:37 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue in my opinion as the writer of this bill with section 2 was merely the phrasing. Explaining a mixed-member proportional system concisely was difficult for me, and a change to this amendment that made it clearer what I meant by section 2 would be something I would readily accept. For those confused by it, I have an example explaining it:  Let's suppose there are ten total seats, 5 constituent and 5 party. The first part of the election works the same, whoever gets the most votes in the constituencies win the constituency. Let's assume for example that 3 GLs won and 2 republicans won. Now let's assume that three parties ran, dems, gls, and reps. GLs got 40 percent of the party vote, Dems got 29 percent, and Reps got 31 percent. Since the Dems have the least seats relative to the party vote they are added first. Their seats are filled up until its even or they are overly represented. So when 3 seats are added the Dems are now overrepresented. Since the GLs now have the least seats relative to the party vote they gain until they are over or equally represented, and it continues from there until all seats are full.  I'd like to note that this system has worked in the one of the houses of the German Parliament, the Bundestag, and in New Zealand in its legislature."
ModelUSGov,375cr5,IBiteYou,2,Mon May 25 01:18:30 2015 UTC,I think the issue is that it shouldn't be a constitutional amendment.

I'm opposed to the Electoral College, but if I heard a convincing argument in its favor, I would change my mind.  Also, unless I'm mistaken, this amendment wouldn't replace the Electoral College with a popular vote. It would replace it with a preferential voting system.  You're in favor of the EC because you don't want some regions to have more influence than others in a presidential election. I completely understand where you're coming from, but the EC doesn't solve that problem. In fact, it greatly exacerbates it. With the EC, candidates only need to campaign in a handful of 'swing states' where the elections are close to the detriment of everyone else. That's because the EC gives votes to states, not people. Winning the popular vote in California by 51% is no different than winning 100%. You win all of California's electoral votes in both cases. That is a terrible situation if you're a Republican in California because your vote doesn't really matter.  If the EC were really a system all about giving more power to the small states, then it's not doing a very good job.

Also, unless I'm mistaken, this amendment wouldn't replace the Electoral College with a popular vote.   Then this needs rewording, because it states:   The Electoral College will be disbanded and a popular vote will be used to decide the winner of the presidential elections.

Effectively, I have said that I will never agree that a popular vote is a good way to elect a President.  That's what I said.  I also explained why in a few comments.  Instead of accepting that I will never feel that a popular vote is a good way to elect a President, you decided to get personal.  Look.  Folks are going to have views and opinions.  You expect people to respect yours.  So, I guess that every time I see someone argue something I don't agree with, I can just say, ""You lack open-mindedness!""  That will surely advance discussions and relations in this simulation, right?"
ModelUSGov,375cr5,cameronc65,2,Mon May 25 22:42:44 2015 UTC,"I take your point. Perhaps I was a little too eager to call you closed-minded and for that I apologize. I absolutely respect your opinion, even if it seems like I don't.  I don't want to prolong this argument, but perhaps I should explain where I'm coming from. In your initial comment, you stated your opinion and offered only one sentence in support of it.   The electoral college was set up so that people in certain regions would not have more political pull than people in other regions. It is equitable. I will vote against this bill.   When someone challenged your opinion,   If that's what it was set up for, it's failing spectacularly. Because of the electoral college, people in Vermont have 3 times more powerful a vote than those in Texas, and people in Wyoming have 4 times more powerful a vote than those in California.   instead of addressing the points they made, you simply restated your opinion   I think abolishing it and going to popular vote will be a disaster.   and said that your ""mind really will not be changed on that.""  Now, maybe you would have elaborated had someone prompted you further, but from where I'm sitting, you came across as someone who wasn't interesting in meaningful discussion on the issue. You knew you were right and ignored a fair criticism of your opinion.  I'd be very interested to hear your response to /u/jacoby531's claim that ""people in Vermont have 3 times more powerful a vote than those in Texas, and people in Wyoming have 4 times more powerful a vote than those in California."" Doesn't that show that the Electoral College is not the ""equitable"" system you claim it is?"
ModelUSGov,375cr5,idYdtHY,4,Mon May 25 23:07:48 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I thank the GLP for pursuing multi-partisan reform. I can certainly see the merits of this amendment, however I feel it is too broad and simultaneously too vague in Section II to pass. My recommendation is that the Amendment is itself amended to contain only Section I, and that Section II is discussed in its own right at a later date. That is, of course, unless the GLP is unwilling to submit only one without the other."
ModelUSGov,375cr5,cameronc65,1 point,Mon May 25 02:43:41 2015 UTC,"Hear, hear!  I agree with your point about vagueness. I also think we should consider electoral reform for presidential and congressional elections separately."
ModelUSGov,375cr5,cameronc65,5,Mon May 25 18:10:18 2015 UTC,"I'm happy to see that consideration is being given to abolishing the Electoral College. It's an extremely unfair and outdated system.  The fundamental problem with the Electoral College is that it gives votes to states, not people. Supporters of the EC argue that it discourages candidates from focusing all their efforts on large population centers to the detriment of rural populations. That's a perfectly reasonable concern. However, if that's the aim of the Electoral College, then it's been largely unsuccessful. The EC encourages candidates to spend more time in swing states, not small states. As it stands now, candidates spend time and money in only a handful of states and largely ignore the rest. When was the last time you heard about a candidate holding a rally in Wyoming?  The popular vote isn't perfect either. That's why I'm also pleased to see that this J.R. would replace the EC with an instant-runoff system for president and a mixed-member proportional system for representatives. In the next draft, I'd like to see the subsections describing those systems clarified."
ModelUSGov,375cr5,cameronc65,1 point,Mon May 25 05:25:26 2015 UTC,This. Current elections are focused on 7 states while rest of country is ignored.
ModelUSGov,375cr5,laffytaffyboy,6,Mon May 25 06:15:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The Electoral College is an extremely bizarre and disproportionate system.

ModelUSGov,375cr5,idYdtHY,6,Mon May 25 18:22:11 2015 UTC,"Proposed Amendment from the GLP starting after Section 2 Subsection 1:  SUBSECTION 2: The House of Representatives will use a system of mixed-member proportional representatives. In this system, each voter is given two votes.  SUBSECTION 3: The first vote is given directly to a constituent representative. This part of the election will be known as the primary election.  SUBSECTION 4: The second vote is given to a party. This part of the election will be known as the secondary election.  SUBSECTION 5: The share of votes a party received from secondary election will be compared with the share of seats the party has from the primary election. If the share of seats a party has from the primary election is lower than the share of votes they received in the secondary election they will get as many seats as they need to have parity between their share of seats and their share of votes. This procedure will begin with the party that has the biggest difference between the share of seats and the share of votes.  SUBSECTION 6: If a party has a higher share of seats in comparison to their share of votes the size of the House of Representatives will be increased until the party with the biggest difference between the share of seats and the share of votes reaches parity between their share of seats and their share of votes."

ModelUSGov,375cr5,jacoby531,2,Mon May 25 22:55:49 2015 UTC,I'd like to make a further amendment to subsection 6:  SUBSECTION 6: If a party has a higher share of seats in comparison to their share of votes the size of the House of Representatives will be increased until the party with the biggest difference between the share of seats and the share of votes reaches parity between their share of seats and their share of votes. A party will only gain seats from the secondary election if they have at least five percent of the vote in the secondary election.

ModelUSGov,375cr5,Smitty9913,2,Mon May 25 02:19:24 2015 UTC,"The sentiment of this bill is exactly what the US needs but..  Section 1: You have contradicted yourself three times in 1 section on what voting system is used. Under a 2 party system in real life, all would yield the same result but under a 4 party system, could all yield different results.   Popular vote mentioned in SS1: Whoever gets the most votes wins. IRV explicitly mentioned in SS2: If one person doesn't get a majority, then the 2 candidates with the most votes qualify for the run off and whoever gets the most votes in the run off wins. AV which you have described in SS2: Voters rank candidates and the candidate with the least highest choice votes gets eliminated and votes redistributed until someone gets a majority.   Hypothetically   1st preference GLP: 40%, DEM: 25%, GOP: 20%, LP: 15%  2nd Preference GLP-> DEM, DEM->GOP, GOP-> DEM, LP->GOP  3rd Preference: LP->DEM  Under popular vote: GLP would win (40%)  Under IRV: GLP (40%) and DEM (30%) qualify and then DEM wins 60%-40%  Under AV: LP eliminated thus second  round GLP (40%), DEM (30%), GOP (40%). DEM eliminated and GOP win 60%-40%.  Section 2: Will there be a qualifying quota to be allowed to get any national seats? Especially as you could get independents running.   Useful reading"
ModelUSGov,375cr5,jacoby531,2,Mon May 25 12:17:13 2015 UTC,"Based on all I had previously read, instant runoff and alternative voting are the same thing, and works according to what you called the alternative vote. When I said popular vote I merely meant vote by the people, not a single vote method. I'll change the mention of instant runoff voting to alternative vote when I clear up section 2.  Thank you for that article as well, I'll incorporate that into my revised version of section 2, including a quota for qualification."

ModelUSGov,371p8o,Zachrist,1 point,Tue May 26 20:24:41 2015 UTC,"No... there really isn't a big difference.  People look at Reddit profiles all the time.  When you are a mod of the subreddit for your high school, it is public.  It's public information.  It is right on your profile."

ModelUSGov,371p8o,Zachrist,1 point,Tue May 26 19:06:48 2015 UTC,"someone dug through these two people's histories and posted where they went to high school and college   No.  I believe the case was that where they went to high school, one account was a mod for the subreddit for the high school.  That was in the profile.  No one went into post history.  As for where they go to college, I believe that was something that was brought up by one account himself and was never mentioned until he mentioned it.  So no.... no one went way into anyone's post history."

The Western state is what you are referring to, not Northeast. I can't see your link since I am suspended, but it looks like it refers to the thread where /u/WJacobC and I signed up for cabinet positions. I haven't voted in any election there, so I don't know what that refers to... I don't really know how both of us being cabinet members in the Western state is a crime. Please explain.  Third. Yes, /u/WJacobC and I know each other in real life. I didn't want to expose any personal information about him, so I spoke only for myself, and spoke only the truth.  Can I have an example of a ""[statement] that [was] almost the same and which no one else thought of?"" I don't understand what you mean.  And for the comments within minutes of each other. Well, it makes sense: we found out about the new subreddit at the same time. And there's proof:  http://imgur.com/9J81PYy  Anyone, if you have any questions, please PM me!

ModelUSGov,36wtip,DidNotKnowThatLolz,2,Sat May 23 20:10:56 2015 UTC,Well we learned that a) inactivity literally cost us a key bill b) Democrats love them some imperialism and c) Great Speaker is Great
ModelUSGov,36wtip,JerryLeRow,3,Fri May 22 21:02:25 2015 UTC,I personally thought the cut to the military was too drastic. Second I thought closing down all foreign bases was irresponsible considering the threats we face abroad especially in unstable regions like the Middle East.
ModelUSGov,36wtip,evanb_,3,Sat May 23 16:48:18 2015 UTC,"Russia actual borders or almost does some of those hotspots yet manages with a fraction of budget, per capita or otherwise."
ModelUSGov,36wtip,cameronc65,1 point,Sat May 23 17:23:52 2015 UTC,"Their proximity to the region certainly helps to reduce the cost. Plus, they do not have as many bases as us worldwide, let alone the Middle East."

It's sad that this may require us to work longer, but I am not sure of any other solution to this problem.   Can you tell us what changed your mind?"
ModelUSGov,36wtip,jsmith18486,2,Sat May 23 18:29:40 2015 UTC,Some of the other discussions in the thread changed my mind and made me realize there are other options for dealing with social security.

ModelUSGov,36wtip,schultejt,2,Fri May 22 19:53:44 2015 UTC,My apologies for my inactivity. When I was internally elected I didn't know when I was going to be added or confirmed to the House to vote on things so haven't voted on anything but one bill.

ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Gohte,2,Sun May 24 00:53:14 2015 UTC,I'll think about it.
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Smitty9913,2,Sun May 24 00:54:45 2015 UTC,Make a press post; don't clog the comments.
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Smitty9913,2,Sun May 24 01:08:19 2015 UTC,"Here is what I told /u/Smitty9913 in modmail:   Two of /u/wJacobC 's most used words (I'm talking top 5 most used) are ""awesome"" and ""yeah."" Meanwhile, they don't scratch the top 50 words on /u/Connachtblue . The same is true in reverse for /u/ConnachtBlue 's top words (lol, ya, etc). These are year old+ accounts with thousands of karma. The dedication necessary to keep the most used words different would be crazy."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,ehbrums1,1 point,Sun May 24 00:56:25 2015 UTC,Top words yea and ya. And I'm now thinking they might be friends. But it doesn't disprove the lies that I linked to

ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Smitty9913,5,Sun May 24 02:51:48 2015 UTC,This is not a sarcastic manner at all. I know from the months before even the first elections to my time as house minority leader to Senator and Republican Whip that what I'm saying is true and fair. I recommend to you to say this to the greens who are always sarcastic.
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,ehbrums1,6,Sun May 24 03:01:21 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but your comment adds nothing to the discussion except insult. It is my belief that members our party should hold themselves to a higher standard, and debate ideas rather than attack people."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Smitty9913,3,Fri May 22 15:26:24 2015 UTC,"I am debating like I have been for 6 months. There was no attack on anyone. I represent the people who voted me in. I don't think you were a member of the party back then,"
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,ConnachttheBlue,4,Fri May 22 15:31:41 2015 UTC,"I understand that you have been in office for a while, sir. With all due respect, that doesn't make you right."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,IBiteYou,5,Fri May 22 15:43:08 2015 UTC,"I'm saying I represent the views of my party. One new face isn't going to out way the large majority of other views, citizen."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,ehbrums1,3,Fri May 22 16:25:18 2015 UTC,Is the senator saying he doesn't care about the opinions of his constituents?
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,oughton42,3,Fri May 22 16:28:24 2015 UTC,I'm saying quite the opposite actully.
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Smitty9913,2,Fri May 22 16:34:25 2015 UTC,"Sir, we aren't debating views here. I believe it is very fair to ask the most publicly visible members of our party to discuss in a professional manner. Personal attacks are not part of the Republican platform, so please don't claim to represent the majority of the party by using them.  Also, with all due respect, I believe you meant ""outweigh."""
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,WJacobC,4,Fri May 22 17:30:25 2015 UTC,At this point ... I am going to say that if you have issues with members of your party... it is better to send them a pm to discuss.  I have done so in the past.
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Smitty9913,3,Fri May 22 16:34:36 2015 UTC,"funny, when GLP members have different opinions you lot like to make a big deal about it..."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,IBiteYou,2,Fri May 22 18:12:23 2015 UTC,"I really respect what you're doing. It takes serious guts to stand up to a ""senior member"" of one's own Party. It's time we begin to change to tone of this subreddit."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,risen2011,2,Fri May 22 18:33:37 2015 UTC,Maybe it's time for people in your party to do the same
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Smitty9913,3,Fri May 22 17:17:10 2015 UTC,"Your language, while it may not have specifically been an attack, carried a derogatory tone that has the potential to inspire more argument."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,ehbrums1,3,Fri May 22 17:30:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, but you can have your opinions"
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Smitty9913,2,Fri May 22 18:54:22 2015 UTC,"There is nothing against the rules about having ""a derogatory tone"".   Sometimes bills are such that we may be derogatory about them because we genuinely think that they are bad.  I assure you that if you post a bill that is conservative in nature, you will see plenty of derogatory comments."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,ehbrums1,2,Fri May 22 18:56:35 2015 UTC,"Could you actually provide an argument for once? If you don't like it, fine. But I'm sure things would be a lot more productive if you would make an argument instead of just denouncing things as ""crazy""."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Smitty9913,3,Sat May 23 02:09:18 2015 UTC,I don't like this bill because it adds taxes to every American. Why can't we get rid of this tax?
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,ehbrums1,2,Fri May 22 14:09:12 2015 UTC,Why can't we get rid of this tax?   Because then we would be recreating the landed gentry...
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Smitty9913,3,Fri May 22 14:21:21 2015 UTC,"No, no it wouldn't. One day when the members of your party start making money they will think ""why did I pass laws that make sure my children don't get what they deserve?"""
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,ehbrums1,2,Fri May 22 14:31:56 2015 UTC,1) I make my own money  2) you say they won't get what they deserve. What did they do to deserve it? Is being born all they need to do to deserve everything their parents actually WORKED for?
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Smitty9913,3,Fri May 22 14:36:51 2015 UTC,2) Yes it is
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,cameronc65,2,Fri May 22 14:41:54 2015 UTC,So you're saying that having wealth and property are human rights?
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Smitty9913,5,Fri May 22 14:47:22 2015 UTC,Not human right but a right. Nothing wrong with inheriting money
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,cameronc65,3,Fri May 22 15:23:12 2015 UTC,"Well if you're saying that everyone should inherit wealth when they're born, is that not saying that having wealth is a right by birth?"
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Gohte,2,Fri May 22 15:31:33 2015 UTC,I would like to remind the recently unbanned member to keep this conversation professional. Implications that certain parties members are unemployed could lead to an uncivil discussion.
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Smitty9913,3,Fri May 22 15:35:57 2015 UTC,I'm not saying that any party is unemployed at all. I'm saying that most people on the party haven't come of age to have a job yet.
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Gohte,3,Fri May 22 15:12:55 2015 UTC,"That is far from the truth. Even if the party was comprised of 16 year olds, they can all work."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,ehbrums1,3,Fri May 22 15:19:34 2015 UTC,Full time jobs
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Logic_85,3,Fri May 22 16:32:41 2015 UTC,"Regardless - employment status, or the ability to be employed, or age even, shouldn't be used as a point of argument. Especially if the criticism of their ability to reason directly assaults your ability to reason."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,schultejt,3,Fri May 22 17:30:04 2015 UTC,And how do you presume to have any knowledge of the demographics of my party?  It absolutely blows my mind how you can follow us around from here to MHoC spamming meaningless jabs at our members on every single comment we make (and even those by others) and you have the audacity to hit save on a comment calling us children.
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,ConnachttheBlue,2,Fri May 22 19:37:52 2015 UTC,"The demographics survey, evidence that is out in the open.   And I, calling no one a child. I am only in high school so it would be besides the point."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Smitty9913,3,Fri May 22 16:55:33 2015 UTC,"You mean the survey that didn't compare age to party affiliation? The survey that I personally didn't participate in?  Why do you feel like you have to make stuff up Smitty? Can you not come up with any other coherent argument besides ""the GLP is full of children who have never worked""? It sounds like you're parroting things you've heard your grandfather say about communists and honestly you're doing an intellectual disservice to yourself by resorting to this type of argument."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Smitty9913,3,Fri May 22 17:34:00 2015 UTC,You're only in high school? See you just have your believes because you're young. They'll change once you grow up.  Two can play at this game
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,ConnachttheBlue,4,Fri May 22 17:42:20 2015 UTC,The jump from 40 to 65% seems excessive.
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Zachrist,5,Fri May 22 18:35:18 2015 UTC,"Thats only because you don't realize that the people in that bracket are the evil bourgeoisie, who must be beaten down until they are no longer better than us."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,cameronc65,7,Fri May 22 13:55:08 2015 UTC,"Sir, decorum, please. I would appreciate it if you represented our party in a professional manner."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,2adamstoon,3,Fri May 22 14:32:23 2015 UTC,What party are you a member of?
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,cameronc65,3,Fri May 22 15:00:13 2015 UTC,"Your party should ask for civility. Remember lort and Plurizor? Your party chased them out. Before your party was here everything was fine and dandy, now it's not. And speaking of maturity, your party doesn't have it. Remember that if a memeber of your party did this he would be ""purged""  /u/oughton42 because you deleted your comment"
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,2adamstoon,3,Fri May 22 15:40:36 2015 UTC,"If that is what you believe, sir, I urge you not to descend to their level. We can build a party with a strong and professional reputation in the eyes of all members of this simulation if we are able to put aside our differences and debate the issues rather than attack people personally."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,cameronc65,3,Fri May 22 15:50:31 2015 UTC,You and I are going to get along just fine in /r/ModelWesternState.
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,oughton42,3,Fri May 22 16:30:03 2015 UTC,I believe Pluralizer was actually shadowbanned.
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Smitty9913,2,Sat May 23 05:48:52 2015 UTC,"Actually, he deleted it."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,ConnachttheBlue,2,Fri May 22 16:30:16 2015 UTC,Are we sure of that?
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Smitty9913,2,Sat May 23 01:49:30 2015 UTC,I was notified by him that he deleted his account.
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,ConnachttheBlue,2,Sat May 23 02:03:17 2015 UTC,Did he say why?
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Smitty9913,1 point,Sat May 23 02:04:38 2015 UTC,"Lort's decision was his own, and if there is blame to be had, I would say there are plenty of people from every party with which the blame can be shared. It's foolish to assume it's all due to one Party.  Second, pluralizer was shadowbanned. It had absolutely nothing to do with us.  I deleted my comment because I wasn't happy with how it sounded when I read it again. It was unclear and poorly worded, in my opinion; I am the greatest critic of my own writing, oftentimes more than I really need to be. I am not embarrassed or ashamed of the content within."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,schultejt,3,Sat May 23 02:06:28 2015 UTC,I'm blaming it 90% on your party
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,ConnachttheBlue,3,Fri May 22 16:35:51 2015 UTC,"Here is a link to my platform, sir."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Gohte,5,Fri May 22 17:32:16 2015 UTC,"I've read it, and please don't call me sir."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,schultejt,2,Fri May 22 16:31:12 2015 UTC,Thank you for taking the time to read it. Would you prefer Senator? I believe that as a citizen I must give due respect to the office.
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,schultejt,2,Fri May 22 17:29:41 2015 UTC,That would be fine
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Gohte,3,Fri May 22 17:39:50 2015 UTC,What is unprofessional about my post?  I am explaining why the Communist Party sees this Bill as fair and equitable.
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,schultejt,4,Fri May 22 17:41:48 2015 UTC,"Frankly speaking, blatantly satirizing of another person's views isn't an explanation, as you claim, it's a personal attack. I believe that our party should have higher standards for debate than that."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Gohte,3,Fri May 22 15:43:40 2015 UTC,Thank you for what you're doing here.
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,schultejt,3,Fri May 22 16:24:03 2015 UTC,"That's odd, last time I checked there is no Communist Party in this legislature..."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,cameronc65,2,Fri May 22 16:57:43 2015 UTC,"My Grandpa used to have a saying:   You can call a turd a piece of gold, but it is still a turd"
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,IBiteYou,3,Fri May 22 16:43:38 2015 UTC,"Ok... I'm pretty sure that's against the subreddit rules, but to address your absurd point, we are not the ""Communist Party"". The real-life CPUSA is a communist-in-name-only revisionist party that backs the Democrats in elections and hardly participates in any struggles for workers' rights. We, on the other hand, are a big tent party of radical leftists who do not back the Democrats and many of us are either currently involved or are planning to be involved in real-life struggles against neo-liberalism. So, I ask you again, which Communist Party are you referring to?"
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,IBiteYou,2,Fri May 22 16:58:48 2015 UTC,"The one that masquerades as a Green party.  When was the last time a member of your organization submitted a bill that had anything to do with the environment.  Pure and simple, your party's actions have proven itself to be a Communist Party.  You may claim to be something else, but your claims do not change what you really are."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,cameronc65,2,Fri May 22 17:13:00 2015 UTC,"The one that masquerades as a Green party. When was the last time a member of your organization submitted a bill that had anything to do with the environment.   It's the Green-Left now, in case you haven't noticed. We obviously have major differences from the real-life Greens; every party in this Congress has major differences from its real-life version. Nevertheless, we do have plans regarding environmental issues and President rangerheart and the cabinet are participating in an international climate change summit.    Pure and simple, your party's actions have proven itself to be a Communist Party. You may claim to be something else, but your claims do not change what you really are.   We're not, though; we're a socialist organization. The party also has democratic socialists and other non-communists as members. The party is not engaging in revolutionary struggle (which would be quite difficult to depict in a model government even if that were the case) and doesn't have a paramilitary wing the way communist parties in other model nations do.   We're not hiding anything either; the President is a libertarian socialist, the Vice President is a Maoist, I'm a Marxist-Leninist, we're already open about these things. If the party itself was communist, we would have said so."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Gohte,2,Fri May 22 18:55:06 2015 UTC,You and other members of this government from all of the three other parties have rarely made an attempt to give us a legitimate conversation and instead have stuck to mocking communist caricatures and belittling our views since the day /u/rangerheart0 was elected. It would be appreciated if you could take a second and not make a joke of every single debate.
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Gohte,3,Fri May 22 19:10:47 2015 UTC,"I'm still not sure what part of anything I said was a joke.  You are a communist party.  You do see this bill as fair and equitable, correct?  You believe it is fair and equitable because it takes wealth from the bourgeoisie class who have unfairly profited from the proletariat, correct?"
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,IBiteYou,3,Fri May 22 17:00:31 2015 UTC,"We are not a communist party. We are a broad tent socialist party. There is a distinction and I'd be happy to try to explain it to you if you like. There are plenty in the GLP that would object to being called 'communists'.  This comment is right, but the parent comment seems to make a joke of it. We have (what we to believe) are legitimate grievances with class society and the capitalist mode of production, and the members of my party have spent a lot of time reading the vast amount of literature that serves to outline this problem and propose solutions and it feels insulting to cheapen it to 'beating down the evil bourgeoisie because they're better than us'. This kind of gross misrepresentation of socialist ideals has been perpetuated by members of the liberal parties since we showed up in the last elections and the party as a whole has gotten rather tired of it."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Xarasystral,3,Fri May 22 19:01:41 2015 UTC,"I would argue that it is not a ""gross misrepresentation"".  You think that the bourgeoisie class is evil. You see that they have more than you, and you have decided that this is unfair and that you must take from them until you and them have the same.   Do you believe that the means of production should be held in common?"
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Logic_85,2,Fri May 22 19:07:52 2015 UTC,"You see that they have more than you, and you have decided that this is unfair and that you must take from them until you and them have the same.   I think that may be a bit of a misrepresentation. It's not necessarily that they have more - it's how they gained that more."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Zachrist,2,Fri May 22 19:27:02 2015 UTC,Legally?
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,risen2011,3,Fri May 22 20:26:53 2015 UTC,"We are not a communist party. We are a broad tent socialist party.   This is the issue.  Ok.  What is your official platform?  Maybe if we could see that it would help us to determine what exactly you stand for, because when you talk about killing capitalists and the fact that the CPUSA is not communist enough for you, we will be likely to fill in the blanks."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Logic_85,3,Fri May 22 22:49:29 2015 UTC,"You're right, we need to create and publish a platform."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Zachrist,2,Fri May 22 22:49:08 2015 UTC,See my post.
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Logic_85,2,Fri May 22 22:59:55 2015 UTC,"This is our platform as of a few months ago. It's due for an update but it gets the point across. I can answer any questions you have.   because when you talk about killing capitalists   I think we've been over this.   CPUSA is not communist enough for you, we will be likely to fill in the blanks.   I should say that it's not that the CPUSA isn't 'communist enough', it's that they're not communist at all. They publicly endorsed Barack Obama and are nothing more than the left-wing of the Democratic Party.

ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Smitty9913,4,Fri May 22 23:17:12 2015 UTC,"I sort of like this, as it is increases taxes on the ultra-rich, but just so I know I'm reading this right: It only applies to inheritances?"
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,dreasdif118,6,Fri May 22 23:22:24 2015 UTC,"No, this taxes the estate (the entity that exists when someone dies and kind of takes their place) not on the inheritances themselves.  So if I died and had a farm worth $10 million, my estate would need to pay about $3,945,800.  The push-back comes when my only asset is my farm, and my estate (guided by my surviving spouse/kids) have to make the choice of selling the farm to pay the taxes, or mortgaging off part of the farm to pay the taxes, etc.  That is the big reason why the estate tax is frowned upon, it negatively affects those with individual, valuable estates.  Same issue comes when someone has not much in their estate (house, few cars, etc) but they happen to have a valuable painting worth $2-3 million.  Suddenly the estate has to either sell the painting to pay for the estate tax.  Personally, I hate to see families faced with the decision of ""what to sell"" of their deceased father/grandfather, because of the high amount of estate taxes."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Eilanyan,6,Fri May 22 14:28:37 2015 UTC,"So if I died and had a farm worth $10 million, my estate would need to pay about $3,945,800.   Fortunately, only 20 small farms and businesses on average are subject to the estate tax each year.  And those who do are able to pay the estate tax over a 15 year period with minimum interest, making a mortgage unnecessary.  Political rhetoric about land-rich, cash poor farming families being crushed by the estate tax is a myth, and an old one."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,dreasdif118,3,Fri May 22 17:37:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your informative response, governor!"
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Eilanyan,1 point,Sat May 23 06:36:52 2015 UTC,"That's because most estates subject to the tax take steps before the death of the owner to avoid the tax by setting up a trust or some other device. There are tons of farms and estates that would be subject to this, but instead they spend $10,000 on an attorney to plan out of any estate taxes at all.   Raising the tax only incentivizes more people to make plans that avoid the taxes."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,IBiteYou,2,Sat May 23 13:03:30 2015 UTC,"There is special $1.1 million deduction for inherited farms if the farm is continued to be used for farming for 10 years and the heirs are directly involved in the farm's management. With that deduction, The Department of Agriculture estimates only 0.6 percent of farms would be subject to the estate tax.  Tax dodging happens, but once you're talking about this many millions, you simply aren't talking about small family farms anymore."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Eilanyan,1 point,Sat May 23 14:16:55 2015 UTC,"but once you're talking about this many millions, you simply aren't talking about small family farms anymore.   This is anecdotal but my in-laws family farm is worth $5-7 million, and because it is leased out it doesn't fall under that exception. Instead of paying tax, it was put in trust for descendants. $0 tax paid at death of the owner."

Also, there is no reason for this increase. So I will vote nay on this bill.   Edit: Since I was on mobile reddit when I wrote this comment, I did not see the first section. So, my problem is mainly with Section 2 and like I said before, I don't know why we need the increase."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,Eilanyan,4,Fri May 22 14:46:07 2015 UTC,Small business that is being taxed after the first 3 million? Doesn't sound small to me. Nor what makes small business special that it needs to be exempt from paying into the society that created it?
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,IBiteYou,3,Fri May 22 14:41:07 2015 UTC,"Well the point of this bill from what I've understood is that it is trying to make society ""fair"" by taxing the rich. But, taxing small business owners' inheritances to their next generation is taking away the money they earned."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,rangerheart0,3,Fri May 22 15:42:53 2015 UTC,"While it can be fun to point to the lack of effort in moving money around; isn't every tax a tax on money ""earned""?"

ModelUSGov,36v6sp,risen2011,2,Fri May 22 20:53:52 2015 UTC,"Well when you have wealth that persists down lineages it can create a sort of landed aristocracy, where people are born into being rich, and people are born into being poor and it sort of stays that way.   That is a very sort of feudalistic idea, even when we are in a capitalist system it is something we should try to move past."

I would not say that we have any perpetually poor class in the sense of the feudal system.  What we have is a nation built on the idea that ingenuity and work can, ultimately, wind up being something that makes you as rich as you might like to be.  There are no limits on what you can achieve, save that taxation that already exists.   even when we are in a capitalist system it is something we should try to move past.   Let's be genuine and honest.  The poor in American do in no way have it as bad as the poor did under feudalism.  It is using the engine of capitalism that we have vaulted to being a nation that is large and relatively wealthy and this wealth is already something that provides for those who may be poor."
ModelUSGov,36v6sp,risen2011,2,Sat May 23 01:22:57 2015 UTC,"I do not have a problem with this.   Fair enough. I am going to have to respectfully disagree.   Now social mobility is definitely something to consider. However we also need to take into account that a.) our social mobility is much worse when compared to many other first world countries b.) Hard work and ingenuity do not guarantee moving across classes. Typically you need some sort of start up capital, which for many is very hard to come by. It is incredibly hard to do this when one is having to work long hours in order to feed a family at a low paying job.   Let's be genuine and honest. The poor in American do in no way have it as bad as the poor did under feudalism.   Nowhere did I say that they did. However hereditary systems of wealth and poverty are indeed a feudalistic idea. Just because those people stuck in poverty in our country aren't serfs slaving away in fields with a life expectancy of 30 years doesn't change the fact that they are stuck in a system of poverty."

(Or in the absence of a will, their spouse/children/closest family member)  Taking money away from large estates will not make the poor people any richer.  It will just bring everyone who has more money than you down to your level while the State hoards all the money for itself and its cronies.   Poor people might not start with a lot but they have every opportunity in the world to become rich themselves.

ModelUSGov,36mx6i,Xarasystral,3,Fri May 22 04:38:12 2015 UTC,"This bill is merely a first step in updating our currency. We can't just immediately get rid of the penny, the nickel, replace the dollar bill with the dollar coin... etc.  We have to do this in steps."
ModelUSGov,36mx6i,cameronc65,3,Wed May 20 17:24:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed here, we should do this in segments. Eliminating the penny is a pretty big step already. We should do something with the nickel and dollar in a separate bill."

ModelUSGov,36mx6i,Oslovite,1 point,Mon May 25 02:30:18 2015 UTC,Why would we replace the dollar bill with the dollar coin? Just asking.
ModelUSGov,36mx6i,cameronc65,2,Wed May 20 18:48:53 2015 UTC,Coins have a longer life than bills.
ModelUSGov,36mx6i,Oslovite,1 point,Wed May 20 19:36:44 2015 UTC,Why not use plastic bank notes then?

ModelUSGov,36mx6i,cameronc65,1 point,Wed May 20 20:47:02 2015 UTC,"I meant for the 5, 10, and 25 cent coins. Why not make them polymer too? Wouldn't they be (potentially) cheaper than metal coins?"

ModelUSGov,36mx6i,NateLooney,2,Wed May 20 22:21:44 2015 UTC,I would also suggest further amends to remove the nickel from production and circulation.
ModelUSGov,36mx6i,cameronc65,3,Wed May 20 18:54:28 2015 UTC,"While I agree - I think we should implement this first, and focus on other coins, bills, and what not in later bills."
ModelUSGov,36mx6i,ben1204,2,Wed May 20 20:27:33 2015 UTC,1). Are there any cheaper metals the penny can by made with?  2). Will the consumers be harmed by price rounding?  3). Would it be possible to make any new pennies made worth 2 cents instead? That will cover the cost and the rounding will be friendlier to consumers.
ModelUSGov,36mx6i,IBiteYou,2,Wed May 20 19:00:36 2015 UTC,OK.
ModelUSGov,36mx6i,cmac__17,1 point,Wed May 20 20:09:22 2015 UTC,"I support this, but if at all possible, i would like to see the penny kept in some form, possibly by reducing cost of production rather than ending their circulation?"
ModelUSGov,36mx6i,richhomieram,7,Wed May 20 16:29:34 2015 UTC,Why? The penny has no purchasing power.
ModelUSGov,36mx6i,cmac__17,1 point,Wed May 20 17:55:47 2015 UTC,"It's more of a nostalgia thing. Like going into a old-style penny candy shop (yes those still exist, there's one about 15-20 minutes from me IRL), and being able to use small coins to buy good, sometimes hand-made candy and sweets. I don't know, its the little things like this."
ModelUSGov,36mx6i,utdude999,3,Thu May 21 00:11:04 2015 UTC,"An appeal to tradition is a terrible argument for a problem that costs us gross amounts of money per year. This will be the new normal within a generation or two, most people in the sub haven't ever had the opportunity buy something with only pennies that couldn't be bought more quickly with larger denominations."
ModelUSGov,36mx6i,cmac__17,1 point,Thu May 21 07:57:57 2015 UTC,"Like i had said, i would prefer it if it were feasible to reduce the cost of production. If that is not possible, then i'm okay with ceasing production."
ModelUSGov,36mx6i,schultejt,1 point,Thu May 21 15:27:28 2015 UTC,How much money is this actually going to save?
ModelUSGov,36mx6i,Xarasystral,3,Wed May 20 16:34:53 2015 UTC,"In 2011, the production cost of a penny was 2.4 cents per coin. With nearly 5 billion pennies minted that year, the U.S. spent almost $120 million to produce less than $50 million of circulating currency.   Source"
ModelUSGov,36mx6i,schultejt,2,Wed May 20 17:23:44 2015 UTC,"Poor wording on my part. What will be the costs of taking them Out of circulation, how much money will companies lose since they are rounding prices down/consumers lose since prices are going up. How will this hurt the mining business as we no longer need the raw materials etc."
ModelUSGov,36mx6i,cameronc65,2,Wed May 20 19:07:45 2015 UTC,"Well - the hope is that the rounding will equal itself out. The integers that round down and up are equal, so the cost increase or decrease in that way should be negligible.  Additionally, if we make 5 billion pennies a year, that would take around 97.5 million pounds of copper. Apparently, the US mines about 1.15 million metric tonnes of copper a year, which is around 2.5 billion pounds. I'm not sure if all the copper in pennies comes from the United States or not. Let's assume it does. That means that of the 2.5 billion copper mined in the US, about 4 percent of it goes into the making of the penny. So it's not negligible, but it's not staggering either. (I should have made a joke about chump change here.)"
ModelUSGov,36mx6i,Xarasystral,1 point,Wed May 20 19:51:30 2015 UTC,"First of all, the companies won't be effected at all. The rounding is solely either going to add to sales tax collected or reduce from. It's not going to reduce from the amount companies are making.  As far as sales tax changes:  Assume all numbers have an equal chance of happening (1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9). Now say there are a total (just for instance) of 8 million transactions a day. Now, split up these eight numbers into equal 1 million transactionary segments. Under the current bill (possible amendments notwithstanding), 1, 2, 6, and 7 will be rounded down. This results in a loss of $60,000 total of sales tax daily with rounding. As far as 3, 4, 8, 9 being rounded up, This results in a gain of $60,000.  The changes are non-existent or rather, negligible.   Remember also, this only changes cash transactions. Card transactions will still have the 0.01 or 0.02 not being changed, etc. I assume in today's world that the majority of transactions are card."
ModelUSGov,36mx6i,schultejt,1 point,Thu May 21 02:28:34 2015 UTC,But that's not the way this bill is written.  The state and county government's will still want the amount in taxes that they are owed.
ModelUSGov,36mx6i,Xarasystral,1 point,Thu May 21 02:51:59 2015 UTC,"And the amount in taxes are not going to change.  However, I can see how we may need to edit the verbiage in order to show that the rounding solely affects sales tax."
ModelUSGov,36mx6i,schultejt,1 point,Thu May 21 03:54:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I'm not sure the national government will be able to dictate to the States, how they manage their taxes."
ModelUSGov,36mx6i,Xarasystral,1 point,Thu May 21 04:01:37 2015 UTC,"They're not, which is why the states themselves are already able to decide how their taxes are spent. This isn't telling anyone how to spend their taxes, just setting guidelines on how the new lack of a one cent piece will change transactions. As I showed with my math, amounts of taxes aren't being altered, rather, the taxes will be collected just a bit differently. This is fully in the realm of the ability of the federal government."

ModelUSGov,36id2l,lovelybone93,2,Tue May 19 23:18:11 2015 UTC,You can change your flair to reflect your status.
ModelUSGov,36id2l,lovelybone93,2,Wed May 20 01:03:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I look forward to serving my country and helping bring America and her workers prosperity."
ModelUSGov,36dxmt,SeptimusSette,21,Mon May 18 16:58:34 2015 UTC,"This is all within the law and it should be Inforced immediately.   Not so sure about that. The Act only applies to the CPUSA, or ""any successor party whose object is to overthrow the government of the United States"". (This text is taken from the bill itself)  This is clearly not the case. The call is unjustified. It goes against the freedom of association.  Also, yay for political persecution. I thought you were the champions of political freedom."
ModelUSGov,36dxmt,Oslovite,13,Mon May 18 17:09:36 2015 UTC,We don't want to overthrow the government... WE ARE THE GOVERNMENT!
ModelUSGov,36dxmt,risen2011,5,Mon May 18 17:58:28 2015 UTC,"I believe the law relies on van den Haag's understanding of communism as antithetical to democracy — “There is no place in democracy for those who want to abolish [it] even with a peaceful vote.”  While I don't agree with the measure, the electoral success of the party has nothing to do with it."
ModelUSGov,36dxmt,evanb_,6,Mon May 18 19:41:47 2015 UTC,Which is still not relevant - overthrowing government and democracy are not the same thing - and neither apply.
ModelUSGov,36dxmt,WineRedPsy,5,Mon May 18 20:20:03 2015 UTC,It's extremely relevant to understanding of the CCA and the thought of the time.

ModelUSGov,36dxmt,WineRedPsy,6,Mon May 18 17:24:23 2015 UTC,One could make a very strong case to the GLP being the successor party to the CPUSA so I would tread lightly...

ModelUSGov,36dxmt,Varroun,4,Mon May 18 21:17:58 2015 UTC,Same
ModelUSGov,36dxmt,jsmith18486,6,Mon May 18 21:32:53 2015 UTC,"As much as I would love to imagine the GLP as a successor of the 1940s CPUSA under Bill Foster, I assure you that that isn't remotely the case.   We have not inherited the CPUSA and our political program does not call for the overthrow of the US government. Our party includes revolutionary socialists, myself and Gohte as examples, but that isn't relevant in this case since it's not the view of the party. We also have some democratic socialists who have themselves commented here."
ModelUSGov,36dxmt,notevenalongname,19,Mon May 18 22:11:35 2015 UTC,"This is the kind of drama that everybody was complaining about the last couple of days...    Anyways, this is not ""all within the law"".  The Communist Control Act (Pub. Law 83-637) amended 50 U.S.C. §§ 781 - 798 (the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950).  The largest part of those provisions was repealed by Section VIII of the FRIENDSHIP Act (""Act For Reform In Emerging New Democracies and Support and Help for Improved Partnership with Russia, Ukraine, and Other New Independent States"") of 1993 (Pub. Law 103-199). It struck out most references to communism (except in the title of § 783 (b)); the only provisions retained are parts of §§ 783, 796 and 797, all of which are related to disclosure of classified documents.  Ergo, nobody is violating the law.  Edit: The link to Pub. Law 103-199 was broken."
ModelUSGov,36dxmt,Zachrist,4,Mon May 18 19:23:32 2015 UTC,Thank you for your reasoned response to this.
ModelUSGov,36dxmt,IBiteYou,2,Mon May 18 20:02:55 2015 UTC,"Even if it WAS within the law, I think it wouldn't fly in the simulation.  One can argue as to the wisdom of the move, but the the people running the simulation allowed the GLP to participate in an unlimited fashion knowing full well that they are an anti-capitalist, communist/socialist party."
ModelUSGov,36dxmt,evanb_,16,Tue May 19 19:16:40 2015 UTC,I can not support this measure. The CCA of 1954 is unconstitutional in more ways than one.

ModelUSGov,36dxmt,Xarasystral,12,Fri May 22 04:39:59 2015 UTC,"Look. This is absolutely ridiculous. This is your attempt to unseat the current political party in power by claiming, what? An antiquated law that really isn't helping you at all?  This is the same response you've seen with the tea party, claiming Barack Obama isn't a natural born citizen and therefore should be impeached and arrested. This is the same response you've seen with those claiming that George W. Bush bought a couple of officials in Florida to swing the vote his way and therefore should be impeached and/or arrested. Your party's (and some of mine, even) response to the GLP currently being in power is no different than RL politics.  All that this is, and I mean, in its entirety, is your attempt to create some reason to explain why your party is currently not the one in power. You want to swing the tides of ModelUSGov? Get more people in your party to participate, get more people to vote for you, ETCETERA. This is how big boy politics works."

ModelUSGov,36dxmt,Hlafward,3,Tue May 19 00:56:29 2015 UTC,"This is a joke. According to this, any person who cares about the well-being of his fellow workers (i.e. the majority of people) and their subsequent participation in organizations to do this should be incriminated and imprisoned. It sounds awfully like a McCarthyist/neofascist dream that you have, Smitty, to call for the impeachment and practical imprisonment of any members or supporters of this Party. However, the Communist Control Act of 1954 only calls for the illegality of the Communist Party and its constitutionality has not been so deemed by the Supreme Court. If anything, you should call for a ruling in turn by the Supreme Court for a ruling to deem said constitutionality in this Model Government."
ModelUSGov,36dxmt,kingofquave,3,Tue May 19 18:52:54 2015 UTC,This is frankly absurd and should be ignored.
ModelUSGov,36dxmt,Varroun,3,Tue May 19 01:18:27 2015 UTC,"Here is the full text of the law, as it stands today:   The Communist Party of the United States, or any successors of such party regardless of the assumed name, whose object or purpose is to overthrow the Government of the United States, or the government of any State, Territory, District, or possession thereof, or the government of any political subdivision therein by force and violence, are not entitled to any of the rights, privileges, and immunities attendant upon legal bodies created under the jurisdiction of the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof; and whatever rights, privileges, and immunities which have heretofore been granted to said party or any subsidiary organization by reason of the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof, are terminated: Provided, however, That nothing in this section shall be construed as amending the Internal Security Act of 1950, as amended [50 U.S.C. 781 et seq.]   (Emphasis mine)  Seeing as we haven't seen an attempted overthrow or attempted overthrow by violence, I don't see any way we can enforce this law.  Besides that, the following sections of what remains of the CCA requires finding, by a jury, of membership in the communist party.  Seeing as we have no evidence of a violent overthrow, and no evidence of any of the requirements needed to be found by a jury to rightfully convict anyone of such, I find this complaint and request to enforce this (unconstitutional and antiquated) law meritless."

It fails to give a voice to virtually half of the political spectrum. Is it so unreasonable to try and do better here?  And for what it's worth, I don't think the GL has been completely dominant and unwilling to compromise. We've worked countless times with other Parties (even the Republicans and Libertarians) on solutions and compromises that work for everyone. There is a bill up for vote in the House at this moment that is a compromise between Green-Left, Democrats, and Republicans. We've clearly shown a complete willingness to work within the system, and yet we're being vilified by nearly everyone for apparently trying to ruin this simulation.  The GL never subverted Democracy or cheated. I think that with some exceptions, as a whole we've acted maturely and treated other beliefs with respect. And yet suddenly, when one mod makes some poor decisions and we're rightly upset, we become this sort of Cold War era McCarthy caricature of Communists, killing families and murdering Capitalists for fun."

Half of the USA political spectrum is not composed of socialists/communists.  You are fringe IRL.   The GL never subverted Democracy or cheated.   You advertised on RevLeft.  But regardless, this goes back to the very beginning of the subreddit.  It was sold as a REALISTIC SIMULATION of the US political system.  That is when many of us got involved.  SOMEHOW a bunch of communists found it and joined the Democrats, then broke off to a new anti-capitalist party.  Many of us said at the time, ""This is not what we signed up for.  We signed up for something that would resemble the US government.""  So do not be surprised nor angry after weeks of exposure to the communists, that some of the members are finally saying, ""We did not sign up for what the subreddit has become.  It is not engaging nor enjoyable for us.  Maybe we can create something that is like what the simulation was ORIGINALLY supposed to be."""
ModelUSGov,369ori,oughton42,5,Sun May 17 23:09:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think we would be a fringe group IRL if the system didn't inherently suppress non-right ideologies. Let's face it: there is a very real attack on the left in the American political (and broader cultural) environment. It is more socially acceptable and politically ""safe"" to be a FAR-right, pro-corporatization Fascist than it is to be even the most moderate Socialist, and I think that is a terrible reality that needs to be fixed.  The system has a vested interest in effectively outlawing dissidence of the current structure. I think if this were to be redone -- the structure rebuilt -- there would be much more support for Socialist and Communist causes."
ModelUSGov,369ori,DidNotKnowThatLolz,5,Sun May 17 23:48:28 2015 UTC,"I would have to disagree a little bit. Nobody in congress is a fascist nor claims to be. Sanders is openly a Democratic Socialist who has had countless years in public service. Plus, there have been a few other open socialist people who have held office in Congress throughout our history."
ModelUSGov,369ori,risen2011,5,Mon May 18 00:33:04 2015 UTC,"Socialism: a political and economic theory of social organization that advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.  I've never seen Sanders advocate this before. Therefore, he is not a Democratic Socialist."
ModelUSGov,369ori,DidNotKnowThatLolz,5,Mon May 18 00:49:15 2015 UTC,"Ok, well I was simply pointing out that there is a member of Congress who publicly claims to be a socialist."
ModelUSGov,369ori,risen2011,4,Mon May 18 00:58:01 2015 UTC,"Ok, fair enough"
ModelUSGov,369ori,oughton42,4,Mon May 18 01:00:41 2015 UTC,"First, while no one in Congress is ""officially"" a fascist, I don't think it's unreasonable to say that there are plenty of not only Congressman, but also those who influence the government who are de facto fascists, in addition to many far-right ultra-nationalist, ultra-capitalists. Simply look at the Tea Party; could you imagine a left-wing Tea-Party equivalent going anywhere in the current U.S. political environment? Of course not, because it is more acceptable to be far-right than moderately left -- primarily because the current U.S. is already mostly right-wing, really only realistically going as far left as center-left, and therefore the far-right is significantly ""closer"" to the current climate than a moderate left.  Also, think there is an important distinction between a democratic socialist and a social democrat. Bernie Sanders (and Elizabeth Warren, for example) does not want an end to private property; as a social democrat, Sanders wishes to work within the Capitalist system -- democratic socialists do not. This is the same for the ""socialists"" in power in the United States -- not truly Socialists in the sense that they support the end of Capitalism, but a sort of pseudo-Socialist that supports the working classes but refuses to consider abolishing Capitalism.  Now, I will vote for Bernie Sanders IRL. Not because I support social democracy, but because he is the lesser of two evils, as I see it. While I don't like the Capitalist system, I will support someone within it because I believe that until the U.S. is more class-conscious and ready for revolution, Sanders is the only candidate that has the interests of the working class in mind."

Being pro-Capitalism doesn't equate to being a Fascist. Quit crying and using buzzwords.   Simply look at the Tea Party   Aww, are you buttblasted they don't have the same political opinions as you?    left-wing Tea-Party equivalent going anywhere in the current U.S. political environment?    Because of the Cold War. Simplest answer possible. No one will elect open Socialists/Communists anywhere because of this.

ModelUSGov,369ori,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:55:59 2015 UTC,"While I'm not sure why you're perusing old threads, and I don't appreciate your immature and crass tone, I'll address your ""questions"", as you either didn't read the entirety of my post, or completely misunderstood it.  You'll notice that nowhere in my post did I talk at all about my opinions of the Tea Party and their politics (although it should be obvious, given my Green flair), so I'm not sure why you thought saying ""Aww, are you buttblasted they don't have the same political opinions as you?"" was necessary or productive (it certainly was crude). No, I am not ""buttblasted,"" I simply mentioned them in order to establish a comparison.  While I think it's simplistic to argue that Socialism isn't as popular in America solely due to the Cold War (America has always been right-leaning, for many reasons), I wouldn't disagree that it is a major factor, particularly today. My contention, though, is that the Cold War was an absolute disaster, and the McCarthyism that came with it was one of America's greatest injustices, certainly within the 20th century. Also, please notice that nowhere did I even hint at racism, nor do I even think it has anything to do with the lack of Socialists in the US; I'm not sure why you decided to bring it up.  I honestly feel like everything you said had little to do with what I wrote. It's like you completely missed the point of what I was saying, and then decided to reply with immensely unprofessional language and irrelevant accusations."

ModelUSGov,369ori,Libertarian-Party,12,Sun May 17 16:47:47 2015 UTC,"To be totally honest, if you all returned to the two party system, yes it would be a more realistic system. However I think it is fun that we have a system in which non of the four parties have explicit control over the house or senate. It forces us to work together and results in more interesting legislation."
ModelUSGov,369ori,BjornIronside,8,Sun May 17 18:02:42 2015 UTC,"If we're being honest here, I agree with you, but simply percentage wise, it doesn't seem logical to have a majority that is socialist in the United States for an accurate simulation. In the US there is little support for Libertarians (5% of so every election), so the number of Libertarians is higher in this simulation as well. But having a socialist or Trade unionist party this populous seems to contrast American demographics.   In any case, it's clear this simulation is its own entity."
ModelUSGov,369ori,cameronc65,10,Sun May 17 18:19:38 2015 UTC,That's the point of a simulation. Same rules different outcome.
ModelUSGov,369ori,rangerheart0,1 point,Sun May 17 22:56:08 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that if we really wanted to simulate the US Government, than we would set up the system to exactly mirror the current term. Then, we could all just puppet some Congressman, Department Head, etc. That would be the real simulation that the detractors are arguing for.  Other than that, I think we all signed up to join a simulation based on rules, not ""IRL"" government."
ModelUSGov,369ori,bluefisch200,7,Mon May 18 02:11:09 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely, this is not at all a realistic simulation. It does not at all accurately reflect current demographics in the united states. My point was mostly just that we can still have fun even if it doesn't accurately reflect current demographics."
ModelUSGov,369ori,dreasdif118,4,Sun May 17 18:42:11 2015 UTC,"But isn't that the idea of a simulation. As long as the rules are the same (how to vote, how to govern) than the parameters (who votes for what) can be different and will result in different outcome.  In the real US 4 parties are possible. It didn't happen till now but it can happen. And if we want to be realistic there should not even be a 4 party cap but no cap at all."
ModelUSGov,369ori,rangerheart0,5,Sun May 17 21:08:19 2015 UTC,It would just make everything easier and in my opinion it would be more fun to actually simulate the real world congress than having a four party system.
ModelUSGov,369ori,cmac__17,5,Sun May 17 18:22:58 2015 UTC,"Sure, I don't really agree but I understand where you are coming from. However i still think we can have a successful simulation even if it doesn't accurately reflect current real life demographics. Looking at MHOC for example."

ModelUSGov,369ori,dreasdif118,2,Sun May 17 22:09:27 2015 UTC,This seems fruitless considering a second sub has been made for those who want to participate in a two party system.
ModelUSGov,369ori,cameronc65,5,Sun May 17 22:31:13 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure it will be left if this sub becomes a two-party sub.
ModelUSGov,369ori,dreasdif118,2,Sun May 17 22:43:31 2015 UTC,I'm sure it would - but that isn't really an argument for turning this sub into a two party sub. Just because it would still be there doesn't mean we should make this a two party sub.
ModelUSGov,369ori,Danotto94,3,Sun May 17 22:49:23 2015 UTC,"No I get that, but I think this sub would do much better with two parties instead of four.

So if the GLP had to come back to the Democrats then there could be a Communist/Socialist Caucus and a Liberal Caucus."

ModelUSGov,369ori,RadioNone,6,Sun May 17 23:51:59 2015 UTC,"I actually share some of the sentiment expressed by /u/IBiteYou in her comment, as in /r/MHOC we also have a Communist Government propelled to power by the votes of those from out with the United Kingdom and I have tried to limit the power of International Votes on /r/MHOC though a Constitutional Amendment which would limit them to only affecting 10% of the seats in their own special region. Unfortunately that amendment failed though.  However, while International voting is not limited like I attempted to do, or limited in other ways - I will not disadvantage parties who I support by not voting for them.    Do you feel that you shouldn't be allowed to participate in this subreddit because you're not from the United States, regardless of the fact that Americans participate in /r/MHOC (and vice-versa) on a regular basis?   I think each individual should be able to choose which Model Government they wish to take part in regardless of their nationality, but as I said above, the problem is with the fact that overseas votes are not limited in terms of the effect they create, something which I believe doing would result in both a more reflective government and would still allow people from the rest of the world to take part by voting."

He refuses to allow true free-market reforms and rejects democratic political reforms. Instead, he is conducting an aggressive international campaign to get the embargo lifted without making any economic or political concessions in return. Castro is trying to force the United States to lift the embargo in order to resuscitate his dying communist regime with billions of dollars in trade, investment, and international aid.  The United States must not abandon the Cuban people by relaxing or lifting the trade embargo against the communist regime. Instead, the U.S. government must reject all pressures to ease the embargo until all of the objectives for which it was imposed are achieved. Anything less would constitute an unacceptable breach of faith with the Cuban people, who today are among the very few people left in the world who still suffer the brutality of a communist dictatorship.   For this reason I am leaning No, unless someone else can provide reasonable evidence that the Cuban people are living in peace and prosperity."

If the Libertarian party had won a majority of the seats during the last election, I seriously doubt this would be an issue.  I'm not a member of the Green-Left party, but it's clear that there are some in this simulation trying to silence them. Remember when they changed their name? Remember the mess in the comments section? Over a name change!  This is a simulation. Nothing any of us say here really matters. All this talk about a 'communist takeover' is nonsense. If some people want to go off and start an alternative simulation in which no third parties are allowed, fine. I think it's petty, but fine.   But /u/Smitty9913's sad attempt to ban all members of the GLP? /u/hlafward's attempt to orchestrate a coup? (By the way, how exactly do they plan on doing that? This isn't real! How you overthrow an imaginary government is beyond me.)  The GLP isn't ruining this simulation. The people throwing a hissy fit because they lost an imaginary election fair-and-square are."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,cmac__17,3,Tue May 19 00:53:28 2015 UTC,"The issue lies in the fact that there will NEVER be a communist government or party in power in the United States, by any given stretch of the imagination. Libertarian party in power? Entirely possible. Unlikely in the near future, but possible."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,idYdtHY,5,Tue May 19 03:24:02 2015 UTC,"Well, I wouldn't say never, but because of Cold War propaganda, you're probably right that there won't be a communist party in power in the near future. You're also right that the same is not true of a libertarian party. However, I don't think that's your real reason for wanting to restrict third parties and I'll tell you why.  As I understand it, you don't like that the GLP are in power because it's 'unrealistic' and as a simulation, we shouldn't stray too far from the real US government. Suppose I agree just for a moment.  I haven't been following the legislation being proposed and voted on the past few months very closely, but I'm pretty sure we've repealed the PATRIOT Act. I know some Americans are optimistic that the PATRIOT Act (or at least some provisions of it) will be repealed sometime in the near future, but I seriously doubt it. I really hope I'm wrong, but realistically it's probably not going to happen. However, both of our houses of Congress as well as the President signed off on the repeal. Doesn't that take away from the 'realism' of our simulation? You might say, ""Well, that's just one piece of legislation. I'm talking about an entire political party that would never win a single seat in Congress, let alone a majority."" I see your point, but repealing the PATRIOT Act is not insignificant. And my question to you is: where do we draw the line?  What if we decide to abolish the electoral college? Or move to a universal healthcare system? What if the Libertarian party wins a majority during the next election and privatizes social security? Do you think any of those might happen in real life in the near future? I don't.  You see, the problem with trying to keep this simulation 'realistic' is that it's impossible. We strayed from 'realism' the moment the President signed our first bill into law.  If you're unhappy about the GLP having a majority, that's fine. If you despise their policies and call them anti-American, that's fine. But if you're going to do all that, don't try to pass it off as 'keeping the simulation realistic.' Just be honest. You don't like communists? Well, you're definitely not the only one.  In a democracy, often times other people win. What you're proposing is anti-democratic and therefore un-American. And as a Supreme Court Justice, proposing to censor a group of people because of their political beliefs is ridiculous. Nowhere in the Constitution does it say that communists can't run for political office."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,cmac__17,3,Tue May 19 04:29:42 2015 UTC,"Here's the problem though: the legislation you say does stray from the realism is legislation about issues which are prevalent as political and social problems today (this excluding some of the less-serious bills proposed recently). I do not feel that it takes away from the realism of the subreddit since it is about something that is being debated in the real US government, or most likely will be soon. My idea of realism is maintaining the political climate of the U.S. Government, aka keeping the issues we debate relevant to those that are being debated IRL."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,idYdtHY,3,Tue May 19 10:37:00 2015 UTC,"Ah, I think I finally understand what you're trying to say. You're not opposed to passing laws that probably wouldn't be passed in Congress so long as they address issues that are within the purvue of Congress.  Well, I don't spend very much time here, so you probably have a lot more invested in this argument than I do. If a decision is made to limit third parties, I'm not going to cry myself to sleep every night. I still think that you're argument is ultimately founded on a political bias against the GLP that you're not being completely honest about.  The Model House of Commons has what, around 10 parties? Their simulation has been much more interesting and successful than ours. I've honestly considered joining because I get exhausted by all of the drama here. I'm on the far left and the MHOC seem to be much more accepting of far left parties (as well as far right parties).  Have you thought about joining /r/MUSGov instead? I'm not saying you have to, but it seems like the simulation you want already exists. I seriously doubt you're going to get GLP members to agree to curtail their party.  I hope I didn't come off as rude at any point. I feel like I understand your position a lot better than I did before. Thanks!"

They announced that they were mostly revolutionary communists.  They were an anti-capitalist party.  THAT is why there was a mess in the comment section.  It's because many of the people in the simulation were unaware that we had a large party comprised of revolutionary communists/socialists.  People THERE objected that this party would compromise the realistic nature of the entire simulation.  That is why there was a ""mess"" in the comments section.  People were objecting even then."

Let's add it all in!  I don't know why that since we did well in the elections, the Green-Left is suddenly unrealistic and needs to be abolished.

Zachrist is mischaracterizing my argument.  I am arguing that allowing third parties to overtake the simulation was a death knell for the realistic nature of the simulation.  Let's try to put it in terms you might be able to understand.  Say there was a simulation here on Reddit called ""Model National Assembly of People's Power"" modeled on the Cuban government.  You join the simulation because you think it would be cool to be involved in a simulation of communist government.  Suddenly, a bunch of people from /r/Libertarian join your simulation saying that they want to play a part.  You know that this will spell the end of the communistic government simulation ... but what are you going to do?  They are all complaining that you aren't fair and democratic.  And you have to be fair and democratic right?  So you let them in.  They overtake the government and begin passing bills to disassemble communism.  There's pretty much nothing you can do to prevent it because they simply have a bunch of young people who are libertarians who are dedicated to turn the government capitalist."

I understand your argument perfectly well, I am saying it's a poor argument.  The realisticness of this simulation does not come from what parties or ideologies comprise it.

And if you are honest, you would acknowledge that I have a point.   you have a second option that you are welcome to participate in   Indeed I do.  Although it has been my intention to serve out my term as Senator...strictly BECAUSE I do not want to be seen as ""taking my ball and going home"", I have for some time decided that irregardless as to whether or not there is an alternative, I do not wish to run again as Senator in the Western State.  What you are likely unaware of ... despite the charges of ""taking our ball and going home"" is that several Republicans previously have quietly withdrawn themselves from the simulation due to the goings on."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,cameronc65,2,Mon May 18 03:31:47 2015 UTC,"I was not the one who made the ""ball and going home"" statement. There's no reason to use it when speaking with me."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,bluefisch200,4,Mon May 18 04:04:24 2015 UTC,Why a cap? In the US there does not exist such a thing. The political system prevents more than 2 big parties. There is no cap. So if anything there should be unlimited parties.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,cmac__17,2,Mon May 18 04:06:01 2015 UTC,"The cap is to preserve realism. It basically acts as the political system, or a surrogate for it."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,bluefisch200,4,Sun May 17 20:41:02 2015 UTC,"I guess that depends on what you mean with realism. There is the 2 party system currently (!) existing in the real US. But on the other hand the real system allows for more than two parties.   The fact that we have different parties is that our ""citizens"" are not real US citizens but rather young internet users. If you want to force realism onto this simulation you have to select the citizens by their views and establish a copy of the real US.  In the end a simulation is a system with rules but varying parameters. Here, the parameters have drifted to the far left side. That is one possible outcome of a simulation.  I don't think forcing a 2 party system is logical or real. You loose the simulation and get a simple copy of the real system."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,IBiteYou,2,Sun May 17 22:25:15 2015 UTC,"If you want to force realism onto this simulation you have to select the citizens by their views and establish a copy of the real US.   No.  If you want to force legitimate simulation of the US government, you go back to the original rules for this simulation."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,bluefisch200,6,Sun May 17 22:34:13 2015 UTC,How would that be realism? Yes realism in the sense that we do nothing else than copy what Washington is actually doing.  I just don't see a cap in the real world so why would we have one here except to force the same outcome upon us.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,IBiteYou,2,Mon May 18 01:59:33 2015 UTC,"How would that be realism?    Because it is realistic.  Tell me where in the USA there is a sizable, let alone majority amount of communists in government?  Once again, the people who initially signed on to this simulation were told that it would be a realistic simulation of the US government.  We DID want to emulate a Washingtonian example."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,cameronc65,5,Mon May 18 04:37:53 2015 UTC,Then we need to set a cap on how many seats either the democrats  or republicans can control - that is if we want to maintain realism.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,IBiteYou,2,Mon May 18 04:41:25 2015 UTC,Do go on.  Let's look at the recent example of MHOC and the recent UK elections.  The communists took the UK in the simulation.  IRL the Conservatives won.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,cameronc65,5,Mon May 18 04:43:44 2015 UTC,"Then what you are looking for was never this simulation. A model that mirrors the seats of the government was never what this, or any of the other model governments, claimed to be. There is room for the simulation you want, and it could be fun too, it's just not this one."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,bluefisch200,5,Mon May 18 04:47:36 2015 UTC,"Of course it is not very funny to be inthe minority, but you guys can try and push people to agree with your view. Forms that is the really interesting part of politics, debating and trying to convince someone. That's why I am here.   I have some ideas that will not be easy to push trough here, things that even with a GLP majority may not get through. But I will just try and convince you guys that it is worth it. And that, for me at least, is the fun of the game."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,IBiteYou,2,Mon May 18 04:51:30 2015 UTC,"Of course it is not very funny to be inthe minority, but you guys can try and push people to agree with your view.   Oh, Republicans are familiar with being in the minority.    And we disagree with much that Democrats believe in.  Republicans and Democrats ALIKE disagree with Communists.  So ... we Republicans joined knowing that we would likely have an uphill battle on liberal Reddit simply because we are in the minority.  But THEN the simulation changed the rules on us, and the Communists were allowed to form a party and run without any sort of realistic restrictions.  I joined the simulation in order to try to participate in a government that might closely model the US government as possible here, because that is what a simulation IS.  This is not a simulation.  And I guarantee that you will NOT care if you persuade us that something is good as long as you have the numbers to vote it in."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,bluefisch200,7,Mon May 18 04:53:48 2015 UTC,"I joined the simulation in order to try to participate in a government that might closely model the US government as possible here, because that is what a simulation IS.   I would say that a simulation could be what you are describing. It can however go an entirely different way.   And I guarantee that you will NOT care if you persuade us that something is good as long as you have the numbers to vote it in.   No and that is why I don't think that one party governments work. They may be efficient and fast but they never resemble what the whole house/senate thinks. I truly hope that we will never control the house and the senate at the same time. I would hope so to push our ideas but it is against my understanding of a fair democracy."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,bluefisch200,4,Mon May 18 05:07:49 2015 UTC,"Here, on the internet. You must realise that the user basis here is different than in the real world.   Imagine there would be be a conservative majority here, Tea Party style. Why wouldn't they be allowed to alter the outcome of the simulation?  That there are more than 2 parties shows you that the views of the people playing this simulation is just more diverse than the views of the real US citizens."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,ben1204,1 point,Mon May 18 07:04:45 2015 UTC,"I don't agree. The greens will simply join the Democratic Party, and the Libertarians will join the Republicans. You can ban all communists, but that's not really encouraging broad viewpoints."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,Duncs11,6,Mon May 18 04:49:16 2015 UTC,The Constitution over on /r/mhoc would be a good place to get some ideas for rules. It seems to work rather well.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,lovelybone93,14,Wed May 20 22:04:49 2015 UTC,"I propose a rule that moderators can be removed on a simple majority or 2/3 vote from the sub's population (depends on if you're wanting more direct democracy or republic measures), and that any user can call for the vote."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,cameronc65,7,Sun May 17 11:28:38 2015 UTC,I'm not sure we should allow anyone to call for the vote. We'd see votes all the time. There needs to be some kind of barrier for entry. Perhaps there needs to be 2 people from different parties in order for a recall to be voted on.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,lovelybone93,1 point,Sun May 17 06:21:23 2015 UTC,Also a good idea.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,SeptimusSette,6,Sun May 17 22:24:43 2015 UTC,I believe MHOC has this rule as well.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,Duncs11,10,Mon May 18 01:08:01 2015 UTC,"We don't.  The procedure for removing a subreddit moderator/Deputy Speaker on /r/MHOC is:  Half of the Party Leaders (5) must submit a motion of no confidence to the Speaker, then 2/3s of all Members of Parliament must approve it."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,Libertarian-Party,3,Sun May 17 16:57:56 2015 UTC,"so you're saying, if any party had 2/3 populous control of this subreddit, they could remove mods of all other parties? That seems a bit dangerous."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,evanb_,5,Sun May 17 18:12:10 2015 UTC,Yes; it should be agreed to by at least three of four parties.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,lovelybone93,2,Sun May 17 18:22:49 2015 UTC,I'm open to suggestions.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,IBiteYou,3,Sun May 17 19:36:56 2015 UTC,Agreed.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,rangerheart0,3,Mon May 18 01:06:56 2015 UTC,"I propose a rule that moderators can be removed on a simple majority or 2/3 vote from the sub's population   With an overwhelming population of Green Lefts, this would enable you to remove all but sympathetic mods."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,IBiteYou,4,Sun May 17 12:03:27 2015 UTC,"We might be the largest party but no, we don't have a 2/3rds majority, we don't even have a majority. Plurality maybe."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,Michael123443,2,Sun May 17 22:54:33 2015 UTC,I think you likely have a majority.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,IBiteYou,2,Sun May 17 23:49:27 2015 UTC,One can dream!
ModelUSGov,368kcs,SeptimusSette,3,Sun May 17 23:52:03 2015 UTC,Oh look.  A new one.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,lovelybone93,3,Mon May 18 11:59:23 2015 UTC,Remember that image only comments are against sub rules.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,lsma,2,Mon May 18 12:00:11 2015 UTC,We aren't a 2/3 majority. I was just spitballing and thought it'd be a good idea.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,cameronc65,2,Mon May 18 12:04:16 2015 UTC,"And yet again, the Green party uses the downvote button."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,jacoby531,1 point,Mon May 18 18:58:59 2015 UTC,Go through out the sub - the GLP has been downvoted to hell here for some reason. Proof
ModelUSGov,368kcs,cameronc65,2,Mon May 18 01:12:54 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer something higher, like 75%. Otherwise moderators would be added and removed all the time, and a party with a slim majority can wreak havoc by removing moderators with different political views.  But otherwise I like this idea a lot."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,lovelybone93,3,Tue May 19 19:02:27 2015 UTC,I think 75% is a good idea.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,Ajubbajub,4,Tue May 19 19:20:09 2015 UTC,Feedback is great. This is also good.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,DidNotKnowThatLolz,5,Sun May 17 11:46:47 2015 UTC,I could not agree more with the premise of this.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,rangerheart0,5,Sun May 17 22:23:34 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I think the sub needs its own constitution, creating rules about what mods and members can and can't do. We have a fairly decent one over in /r/mhoc which a lot of it can be copied. It also includes rule A001 which regulates what one can and can't say in the main sub. From what I've seen, this sub would benefit a lot from having mods delete stupid comments."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,DidNotKnowThatLolz,1 point,Mon May 18 01:03:11 2015 UTC,I agree wholeheartedly on deleting the stupid comments. Some discussion that goes on in threads are not relevant and sometimes way off topic.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,cameronc65,5,Sun May 17 05:37:40 2015 UTC,Maybe we should have like a weekly off topic goof off thread or something so people can blow of steam. That might help a bit.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,DidNotKnowThatLolz,3,Sun May 17 07:48:27 2015 UTC,Free Speech Friday?
ModelUSGov,368kcs,cameronc65,4,Mon May 18 00:50:03 2015 UTC,I think we need to have 1 moderator from each party.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,rangerheart0,3,Mon May 18 03:25:31 2015 UTC,"Besides Libertarians, we do."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,cameronc65,2,Mon May 18 04:09:18 2015 UTC,I think we just need to have it codified. Honestly - /u/Zachrist's suggestions are what should be being discussed.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,IBiteYou,6,Sun May 17 22:28:28 2015 UTC,Whether or not we decide to be stricter or more lenient on the harrasment/unprofessionalism I think we need to be more specific on what that entails. This will make it more clear when something has breached the rules and quick decisive action can be taken.  While others have stated that we should have a mod from each party. I think it would be best if we did not have partisan mods at all. While we have septimussette now this might be hard cause we don't have lort683 anymore. This wouldn't work with one mod.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,laffytaffyboy,3,Mon May 18 00:50:30 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is that mods will always be partisan, I'm not sure that there is anything we can do about that."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,Zachrist,3,Mon May 18 00:56:46 2015 UTC,septimus is still partisan
ModelUSGov,368kcs,DidNotKnowThatLolz,3,Mon May 18 00:01:00 2015 UTC,"He's really not, but if you're going to insist that he is, can we have him back? (along with his seat) I really miss having him in our party."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,Zachrist,6,Mon May 18 00:04:32 2015 UTC,"Have a separate sub for meta-discussion about rules, arguing with mods decisions, ect and make it a rule that extensive meta discussion in any other MUSGov sub is forbidden.  I think we can all agree these long, drawn out threads of ""You deleted my comment, but not HIS comment and here's a list of other comments he made over the past six months that I don't like"" getting upvoted to the top of a thread about an agriculture bill can be pretty tiring. Keep that drama-stirring meta craps out of the main subs. Have an actual process of warnings, temporary bans, and permanent bans that is consistent, transparent, and binding. Mods need to be transparent about what they are planning, and let members have some input. This thread is a wonderful idea and a perfect example of what should have taken place when we were rolling out state governments. Assigning one person to take that all on is how you get a ""residency requirement"" being sprung on the membership at a crucial last second. Mods shouldn't be members of parties.  It doesn't exactly instill faith in your impartiality, whatever the reality."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,cameronc65,3,Mon May 18 04:53:12 2015 UTC,"I think there should be maybe one or two head mods that should not be partisan whatsoever and cannot hold office. However, I think it's fine if other mods are partisan, it allows for a more balanced moderation team."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,Zachrist,1 point,Mon May 18 19:25:11 2015 UTC,"I think they can be drafted from different parties, but once they become a mod, holding office and continuing to organize with their party seems inappropriate.  It's a system that makes wide-spread confidence in the impartiality of the mod team impossible."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,jsmith18486,2,Mon May 18 00:37:46 2015 UTC,These are all incredible ideas and I am consistently surprised by your thoughtfulness. I hope these are all discussed and implemented.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,oughton42,1 point,Mon May 18 00:56:09 2015 UTC,Thank you! I have much the same opinion about you.  I often find myself scanning through any MUSGov comments section to see what Cameron thinks about all this.

ModelUSGov,368kcs,IBiteYou,1 point,Mon May 18 00:45:50 2015 UTC,These are perfect suggestions that I think can make everyone happy.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,IBiteYou,3,Mon May 18 01:59:06 2015 UTC,"I really like that the Model US Gov was smaller, closer to home (literally) and had some fire to then /r/MHOC which is lovely but also very very British (and cMHOC is dead sub until it changes rules :(. But it seems that the nature of American ""Democracy"" (It's a Republic, I'm always reminded), the two main parties want to take their ball and go home."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,DidNotKnowThatLolz,6,Mon May 18 04:18:29 2015 UTC,"I assure you that this is not a case of that.  At least from my personal perspective.  From the very time the Green Lefts announced their party.  To the time that the caps were removed, I have been vocal in my opposition and, if you go back, eerily accurate in my predictions of what would happen.  If anything... we would have left immediately after the past election if it was a case of taking one's ball and going home.  The fact that people are giving up on this subreddit has much more to do with some of the behavior of the majority party members than the fact that the GL's are the majority party."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,SeptimusSette,3,Mon May 18 01:05:15 2015 UTC,"With responses like this, we will likely leave you to it."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,DidNotKnowThatLolz,4,Sun May 17 22:30:49 2015 UTC,These are the kind of comments that should be removed. /u/SeptimusSette
ModelUSGov,368kcs,SeptimusSette,2,Sun May 17 22:58:15 2015 UTC,Which is exactly why I did so before you commented.

ModelUSGov,368kcs,cameronc65,4,Mon May 18 01:00:23 2015 UTC,Membership on other United States government simulations on Reddit should be prohibited.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,IBiteYou,9,Mon May 18 01:08:44 2015 UTC,"Ah, so you want to kick out the people who have joined the alternative government subreddit...why again?  Because democracy?"
ModelUSGov,368kcs,cameronc65,3,Mon May 18 01:10:56 2015 UTC,To maintain fidelity.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,IBiteYou,6,Mon May 18 00:53:39 2015 UTC,"How?  Seems to me that you just want to punish people who might have decided to explore alternative simulations.  But seriously ... go ahead and kick out people who have looked into alternatives and see how that goes for you.  You can call it ...  a ""purge"" or something like that."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,cameronc65,6,Mon May 18 00:15:50 2015 UTC,How?   I don't understand what you mean by your question. How would trying to get as many people to participate in one Model US Government maintain fidelity? It seems that question answers itself.  A massive split to another Sub will not be good for either. It would be better to have as many users participate in this sub as possible.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,IBiteYou,3,Mon May 18 04:51:18 2015 UTC,I'm now finding it fabulous that you call for not putting any realistic caps on third parties here because freedom.... but you want to crack down on anyone who dares explore any alternative that is more like this simulation was intended to originally be.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,cameronc65,6,Mon May 18 04:53:05 2015 UTC,My argument hasn't been about freedom. My argument is that it's not realistic.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,IBiteYou,2,Mon May 18 05:09:58 2015 UTC,My argument hasn't been about freedom.   No truer words were ever spoken.

The most difficult, and sad, part is that you think comments like the one you left above is actually some kind of argument. It's not, it's an attempt to shield the fact that you aren't saying much of anything at all.

ModelUSGov,368kcs,cmac__17,2,Wed May 20 04:04:01 2015 UTC,Liberal means left... the point of the other simulation is to get away from the extreme liberalism on this one...

ModelUSGov,368kcs,kingofquave,3,Mon May 18 21:42:33 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about economic liberalism; liberals are those who support the existing capitalist system. If I meant the left-leaning ones specifically, I would use something like ""left-liberal"".  What ""extreme liberalism"" is there on this subreddit?"
ModelUSGov,368kcs,oughton42,3,Mon May 18 22:54:36 2015 UTC,I give up. No use debating with people who won't give your points merit or see what you mean by definitions.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,IBiteYou,6,Mon May 18 23:00:27 2015 UTC,"The definition of ""liberal"" can be a bit confusing, particularly in a setting such as this where people outside of the U.S. interact with those from the U.S., and Leftists who use the traditional ""liberal"" interact with those who don't. It's an understandable confusion, but one that should be clarified.  What /u/Those_Crazy_Reds, and many of us in the GL and across the world mean by ""liberal"" is the classical liberal, or someone who supports capitalism as an viable economic system and generally favors the individual over the community. That's the definition you'll encounter globally and among academics.  What I think you think we mean is the American liberal, which refers to the Democrat Party, or any center-left individual/group, which generally support large government spending and Keynesian economics.  The American liberal can be thought of as a American-centric subset of the Classical liberal. The GL, and any far-left, anti-capitalist group are, by their nature, anti-liberal. I hope that clears up any confusion."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,IBiteYou,3,Mon May 18 23:02:10 2015 UTC,Thanks for clearing this up. I completely forgot about our non-US members.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,IBiteYou,3,Mon May 18 23:10:16 2015 UTC,"I would argue that American Liberals are more like social liberals than classical liberals, but I could see how I am wrong here."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,IBiteYou,1 point,Mon May 18 23:47:53 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't be wrong, but I thought that adding more and more variations of ""liberal"" would just be increasingly confusing.  Classical Liberals are associated with modern Libertarians."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,2adamstoon,1 point,Tue May 19 03:41:21 2015 UTC,It seems like that subreddit did not occur when the G/L took over the government.  Rather it occurred after a moderator was so hounded by people that he quit Reddit.
ModelUSGov,368kcs,2adamstoon,2,Tue May 19 10:32:41 2015 UTC,"Why does it specifically have a rule against ""fringe ideologies"", then?"
ModelUSGov,368kcs,2adamstoon,1 point,Tue May 19 20:23:59 2015 UTC,"Well, allegedly, it was folks from a fringe ideology that so hounded a mod that he quit Reddit.  But again ... if it were purely a case of wanting to set up a simulation to exclude communists... it would have happened right after the last election.  I believe it now prohibits fringe ideologies so that that communists cannot overtake it and it will be a realistic simulation."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,IBiteYou,3,Tue May 19 20:29:10 2015 UTC,"Well, allegedly, it was folks from a fringe ideology that so hounded a mod that he quit Reddit.   It's perfectly clear that you mean specifically socialists and communists with the ""fringe ideologies"" part. You've just admitted that you believe in collective punishment for all radical leftists because several might have allegedly been responsible for a moderator quitting.   But again ... if it were purely a case of wanting to set up a simulation to exclude communists... it would have happened right after the last election.   I don't buy that. There are plenty of reasons why you could have decided to leave now, and not immediately after the elections, to avoid participation from non-liberals.    I believe it now prohibits fringe ideologies so that that communists cannot overtake it and it will be a realistic simulation.   So you want a realistic simulation. Wouldn't it be un-realistic to partake in two United States government simulations at once? It doesn't really help your cause to maintain a presence here while encouraging people to avoid this simulation either. It'd be best for both this sub and r/MUSGOV to just completely separate from each other then, no? So banning simultaneous participation in both makes sense."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,IBiteYou,1 point,Tue May 19 18:55:42 2015 UTC,"You've just admitted that you believe in collective punishment for all radical leftists because several might have allegedly been responsible for a moderator quitting.   I am explaining the reason that some people may have decided to set up an alternative model US Government.  It did not happen until people with fringe ideologies badgered a mod to the point of quitting.   I don't buy that.   That is the fact, though.  You can decide to manufacture or suspect whatever you choose to, but an alternative was not created until after fringe members hounded a moderator.   So banning simultaneous participation in both makes sense.   If you wish to pursue a purge because some people decided (and by the way, I had nothing to do with it) to create an alternative US government that is realistic...then pursue your purge.  THAT, though, certainly would speak to ""sour grapes"" more than anything else."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,tyroncs,2,Tue May 19 21:48:17 2015 UTC,"I am explaining the reason that some people may have decided to set up an alternative model US Government. It did not happen until people with fringe ideologies badgered a mod to the point of quitting.   That's a very poor excuse to ban all non-liberal ideologies, is my point.    That is the fact, though.   When we make a decision and tell you that our reasoning for it is the fact, do you just believe it? Likewise, I'm questioning the motives behind this new subreddit.   If you wish to pursue a purge because some people decided (and by the way, I had nothing to do with it) to create an alternative US government that is realistic...then pursue your purge.   I thought you were part of the decision-making in opening this new subreddit, my mistake then.   What is being proposed here is not a purge. It's giving you a choice. You can either be a part of the simulation here or the simulation there. I would advise that r/MUSGOV likewise ban participation here if it wants to have any significance as a model legislature."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,cameronc65,1 point,Wed May 20 00:15:50 2015 UTC,"That's a very poor excuse to ban all non-liberal ideologies, is my point.    As you have said ""several"" people went after a mod.  These people shared an ideology.  It would seem to me that a new subreddit may want to avoid similar activity by banning fringe ideologies.   That's a very poor excuse to ban all non-liberal ideologies, is my point.    But it accomplishes two things.  It prevents similar drama and renders the new simulation more realistic in nature.   When we make a decision and tell you that our reasoning for it is the fact, do you just believe it?   Fact is fact.  There was no new simulation created after the most recent elections.  It did not happen until a mod was harassed.  That is a fact.   I thought you were part of the decision-making in opening this new subreddit...   In fact, I was away and greatly saddened to learn what had happened to Lort for the day and a half that I was gone.  The new subreddit existed before I came back online.  I had nothing to do with it.   What is being proposed here is not a purge. It's giving you a choice.   If you eject people from THIS simulation based on their participation in one that is more realistic, it is, in fact... a purge."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,Timanfya,4,Wed May 20 00:27:19 2015 UTC,"Regulations, Regulations, and more Regulations!  Musgov is not affiliated with the Model World, so technically there is nothing wrong.   Next I'm sure you will want people to to be prohibited from being in the Canadian Government simulation too."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,SeptimusSette,3,Wed May 20 01:10:59 2015 UTC,"It's one thing to be in the legislature of another country as well as ModelUSGOV (which is still illegal if that other legislature is also in RMUN), it's another thing to be in two model United States simulations. It's pointless and divisive. It shouldn't be allowed."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,cameronc65,6,Wed May 20 01:36:02 2015 UTC,"If they were both a part of RMUN, then I agree with you. But, they are not.   It is not ""pointless"" to try to Model the real-life United States Government. We are trying to be a part of something that we originally joined this subreddit for. That was Democrats vs. Republicans (and Independents) like the real-life counterpart. There should be no problems here, we are just trying to make and enjoy a more ""realistic"" simulation."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,DidNotKnowThatLolz,2,Wed May 20 02:18:53 2015 UTC,"If they were both a part of RMUN, then I agree with you. But, they are not.

There should be no problems here, we are just trying to make and enjoy a more ""realistic"" simulation.   You do realize that no other model government is exactly like its real-life version; they all have differing parties with differing platforms. You might argue that the US is different as a two-party system, but there is no US law that says that only the Democrats and Republicans can be in government. Hence this argument is absurd. A government simulation isn't about having the same parties in power."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,ben1204,5,Mon May 18 13:46:00 2015 UTC,"but there is no US law that says that only the Democrats and Republicans can be in government   When did I say there was a law stating that?  I'm saying this does not represent what the American people would vote for. In current day America there would not be a Communist President. In current day America there would not be a(n) (almost) Communist control of the Government. This is unrealistic for the current situation in America.  Hence completely unrealistic.  I, and many other colleagues, wanted to join a simulation that actively tried to represent current day America like it is. We joined this because it offered that sense of ""realism"". That realism is now no more."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,Zachrist,2,Mon May 18 21:39:31 2015 UTC,"That is not the point of a simulation. If you and others came here for a legislature that is exactly the same as the real-life version, it's no wonder you didn't find what you're looking for, because that's simply not possible. This simulation is supposed to give the experience of legislating in Congress.   Model Britain currently has a Broad Left coalition with a Green prime minister and a Communist deputy, yet all of the members there seem to be doing fine in terms of simulation. In Model Sweden, the liberal parties are dwarfed by more left-leaning ones. We're the only RMUN member government that seems to have a major simulation issue."
ModelUSGov,368kcs,bluefisch200,1 point,Mon May 18 21:48:35 2015 UTC,That is not the point of a simulation.    It WAS when the simulation began.  That's the whole point.

Those who lambaste him for his decisions and those who lambaste him for changing his mind should be ashamed.  If he changes his mind on a decision are being presented by a counter-argument and other evidence then it makes him a good, conscientious mod - it does not make him weak.  The childish behavior puts the subreddit at risk and it is a great shame that you've made him leave - you've lost a great moderator."

Honestly, it's at zero, so that could have even been /u/Smitty9913 un-upvoting himself to make it look like he was being downvoted. I'm not accusing him of doing that, but I wouldn't put it passed him given some encounters I've had with him. (BTW that's the second time he's done that to me, he deleted his comments in the first post after I linked that to cite his unprofessionalism) That was in a direct response to another unprofessional comment, that entire string of comments was unprofessional, why not ban everybody else? That was a joke reply to a comment that was very clearly baiting him.     Those are three recent examples, as well as certain instances where /u/Those_Crazy_Reds[4]  followed people into other subreddits.   If you have evidence he was actually following I'd like to see it, I run into people from here on other subs on a frequent basis.   We can all agree he took this simulation less then seriously and acted unprofessionally frequently.   I don't think a single person here takes this seriously even 100% of the time, and a significant number take it seriously less than a majority of the time.   I absolutely believe he was unprofessional, and that's a large reason I'm not a big fan of his, but he was no more unprofessional than a large number of other users across all parties and the sources you used were hardly satisfying to constitute a ban.  That all being said, I think you've done a great job moderating overall and I'm glad you've decided to stay :)"

Where is his ban?  You have me posting stuff like this, something that TCR replied to that you cited as a reason for his permanent ban. I also have a long history of posts of this nature that I'm not going to bother finding and linking. Where is my ban?  I know you can be a reasonable person if you try really hard. You HAVE to realize how ridiculous this is that you're bringing the hammer down on him and only him because you got pissed off at him in another subreddit. A public warning? Hell, I'd be fine with that, but you cite entirely harmless posts and that he downvoted IBiteYou (With no proof, by the way, because you know, there is none) as a reason to permanently ban a sitting United States Senator.

My other problem is I don't think all of the funding for health care in the current budget will be able to fund this new program. Universal health care in the U.S. is extraordinarily expensive and will most likely raise our taxes. So, if the Secretary of Health and Human Services can give us an estimation of the cost of this program that would very good.

Also, I do not believe Universal Health Care will work in the US. Maybe, just maybe, a public option, but that is still a little far-fetched.

However people complained that this created unnecessary bureaucracy and said that they would feel more comfortable if their care provider could decide what they needed. I decided to make a compromise where doctors decided but it would eventually become standardized. An improvement on this system that limited abuse while still ensuring patients the care they need is important. I gave it a much longer time limit for the government, to ensure that it would not be too big of a burden. Aditionally, the government only pays where the patient previously paid. To that end nothing changes for the hospital. An amendment that made it so that public health care workers could only make the median salary for their position would be acceptable."

However, there are a few things we ought to sort out with this bill. To start, here are some questions/comments directed at the author(s). It seems like the bill is covering the basics now (which is ok), but there are tons of variables to consider in a single payer system.  First of all, the bill below, proposed in real life, might be a good thing to base the proposal off of.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Health_Care_Act  1). Will prescription medications and preventative care (MRI's, etc) be covered under the envisioned system?  2). How about other forms of care (dental health care, psychiatry, mental, etc)? These are very important in my view  3). I am aware, that even as a proponent of this system, the costs will be substantial. I believe a system, although it will save money in the long run, will initially increase the yearly deficit by a number in the neighborhood of $200 billion. Does GLP feel it's necessary to raise any taxes to fund this system?  4). There will need to be a new bureaucracy established to pay for the system, and manage the day to day kinks. The HHS is not sufficient to do this on its own.  5). I suggest revisions to the ""necessary"" care provisions. The say of one doctor might not be enough. Maybe there should be a system where the new agency in charge of the system can be petitioned, where we could have doctors on the board.  6). Section 3, subsection 5, seems like unnecessary ideological insertion in the Bill.   7). The bill proposed IRL suggested a mechanism for helping those whose jobs were lost in the private sector. Would GLP consider something like this?  8). With the health care workers system, I think there needs to be a merit system. We can't have just any people going to medical school being paid. We should be only subsidizing the best medical school students.  9). How will the current ACA be phased out, and transitioned from?  10). When will treatments start to be covered, and when will each provision start to be phased in?  11). What will happen regarding undocumented residents or travelers coming to the United States, who need emergency care?"
ModelUSGov,362w0r,Zeria0308,4,Fri May 15 17:42:15 2015 UTC,"Yes they will, if deemed necessary for the health of the patient. Necessary dental care(aka non-cosmetic) and all mental health care would certainly fall under the definitions set forth, but I agree this could be further developed upon. We do not believe in raising taxes on the workers to help fund this bill. However there is work on numerous tax bills within the party, which will help to pay for this. The DHHS will have the ability to introduce any bureaucracy necessary in order to manage the new plan. As I posted above, an improvement on the system in the bill would be much appreciated. It is true that S3SS5 is not necessary. However as a socialist party we will be pushing socialist measures, and this only applies to government owned hospitals. Yes, but I believe that should be in a separate bill. While I agree that anybody going to medical school shouldn't be paid, I don't believe only the best would be effective. Would people in the 70th percentile or above in terms of grades sound good to you? All subsidization present in the current ACA will be transferred to the new bill when the new program is ready for public use. ACA will not strictly be outlawed, but as all insurance companies following this will exist purely as supplementary care providers which aren't necessary, it will effectively become useless. Treatments will begin being covered as soon as the bill has been enacted. The other provisions of the bill will be decided by the DHHS. I believe an amendment for undocumented residents and travelers is necessary. Travelers will have to pay for treatment, though not upfront if it is necessary. Undocumented residents will also have to pay for treatment, though again not upfront if it is necessary."
ModelUSGov,362w0r,ben1204,2,Fri May 15 18:52:47 2015 UTC,"A few follow ups  1). I think we need to be clearer on what this means. For example, all of us would agree that cancer meds are necessary. But what about something like anti-depressants?  3). What for example, do the tax bills do? I think we need a source of funding before undergoing this project.  4). Would you be in favor of imposing a set amount of funding for them to establish the bureaucracy?  5). Set up a bureaucracy-""Necessary Care Commission"" as a working title. The commission will be made up of medical professionals. Doctors may petition them for care funding. Or if the doctor rejects that a certain treatment is necessary, the patients can appeal to them.  8). Sure. How about nurses and PA's? These are important medical professions too.  9). Will medicaid be dissolved into the medicare for all system?  10). Maybe set up a system for people to apply for reimbursement if they received treatment ahead of this date. We're probably not ready to start funding care this minute.  11). So let's say Hans is visiting from Germany, and has a heart attack. He needs bypass surgery, but cannot handle a flight back to Germany, and can't afford to pay six figures out of pocket. Or Jose, from the Dominican Republic, is undocumented, and is in a similar situation.  What would you say? Maybe something like the EU would work-where we could make a deal, that they pay for our people in need of urgent care there, and we pay for their people in need of care."
ModelUSGov,362w0r,Zeria0308,2,Fri May 15 19:21:18 2015 UTC,"1. I agree. However I would argue that the current definition is fairly descriptive, if improvable, because it includes the fact that it is necessary for an ordinary person to be happy, and an ordinary person will not be happy if they have depression. That said I do think the definition of necessary could be improved upon.  3. We have an improved estate tax bill being voted on within the party which will raise taxes on estates, and some within the party are working on a progressive tax rate bill. We also have the active public work on the military budget bill, which if passed would save large amounts that could be used for this bill.  4. I believe the funding for specific bureaucracies should be up to them with the budget that is allocated to them.  5. That was my original plan but some voiced displeasure towards it. I am perfectly fine having that be the standard for the bill.  8. Certainly, and they would have the same opportunities as doctors would in subsidization of their training.  9. Yes.  10. That would be acceptable, but I believe we should start funding as soon as is possible for us, since its the most important part of the bill.  11. I would agree to the EU deal, as it is the best for the patients, but in the case that there is no deal like that, they would unfortunately have to pay eventually. Obviously this is not the preferable course however."
ModelUSGov,362w0r,white_anarchist_teen,2,Fri May 15 19:33:02 2015 UTC,"I would like to see the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid collaborating with the FDA and CDC, among others, in deciding which treatments are deemed necessary by default."
ModelUSGov,362w0r,TheRealRailguy,6,Fri May 15 19:55:45 2015 UTC,"A staggering move by the GLP.  We spend a huge portion of the budget on healthcare already, so much that we already can't pay for it with taxes.  How do you expect to increase health care AND cut costs.  The logistics of this are unrealistic at best.  Also, it is an absolutely terrible idea for the government to manage hospitals, considering how incompetant it usually is, and you cannot force your business model on the others.  Both of these are blatant violations of the American Citizens' right to property, and an interference in the workings of a system that has already been screwed up by government."

ModelUSGov,362w0r,IBiteYou,3,Fri May 15 21:46:33 2015 UTC,"Once again ... the discussion ... you have committed what is known as the ""genetic fallacy"".  T'would be good of you to look it up because, ""I don't like your capitalist bourgeois citations"" is not really a response."
ModelUSGov,362w0r,IBiteYou,2,Fri May 15 21:54:01 2015 UTC,"Forbes clearly has a neo-liberal bias, no? When judging a work of any kind, the source (and the bias in that source) is also quite important. And I think this bill has many differences from Vermont's healthcare system as well as veteran care."
ModelUSGov,362w0r,IBiteYou,2,Sat May 16 01:50:56 2015 UTC,"Vermont was going to try this.  They couldn't for a few reasons.  Would be good to read those so you understand why some believe that if it cannot happen in a small state like Vermont, it would be a disaster in a nation as large as the USA.  The VA is an example of government-provided healthcare.  The problems that it has should serve as a warning to those who would embrace similar for the entire nation.  With all due respect, I'm not going to be changing the way I cite things to illustrate a point as long as the only source you guys seem willing to accept is The Socialist Worker."
ModelUSGov,362w0r,AllTheyEatIsLettuce,2,Sat May 16 02:11:45 2015 UTC,"I've looked at both of the articles; the former seems not only biased (as expected), but is incredibly poorly written and assumes a lot about supporters of single-payer healthcare. The latter only seems related to the topic in that there is government involvement in the healthcare. Saying that this legislation's fate can be based on the VA story because both happen to involve the government is fallacious.    the only source you guys seem willing to accept is The Socialist Worker.   A better scenario would be us linking to you an opinion article from a socialist source on, say, spending cuts and expecting you to agree with it and oppose any spending cuts in the future. Because that's pretty much what you're doing here."
ModelUSGov,362w0r,kingofquave,2,Sat May 16 02:48:02 2015 UTC,"A better scenario would be us linking to you an opinion article from a socialist source on, say, spending cuts...   If you linked to something the proper course of action would be for me to say, ""This writer is incorrect in a few places....""  Not.  ""I'm discounting your citation out of hand because it is written by a socialist.""   Because that's pretty much what you're doing here."
ModelUSGov,362w0r,Danotto94,3,Sat May 16 02:51:39 2015 UTC,"Protip from the rest of the developed world: when you're looking to provide a public good or service to everyone, don't start by looking for ways to exclude someone."

It's not fair for them to be inactive when there may be others who may want to participate, but do not have a role. It takes very little time to cast a vote so I do not think being busy is a very valid excuse."

ModelUSGov,362hpa,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,2,Fri May 15 16:01:34 2015 UTC,"I believe it was decided that it would wait for the Budget Committee's determination before being voted upon, as that could either a) complete the goal of the bill on its own or b) show levels of necessity for various amendments.   But I'm not sure, actually. That's more of an assumption."
ModelUSGov,362hpa,Danotto94,2,Fri May 15 18:57:51 2015 UTC,Would the budget committee be able to slash the costs of maintaining/eliminate foreign bases? Sorry if I sound rude but when will it do this?
ModelUSGov,362hpa,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,1 point,Fri May 15 19:19:36 2015 UTC,"Hm, I don't think it could make a mandatory stipulation for that, but I would certainly be open to cutting further costs on that front, which could result in a budget surplus and a return of some money to the treasury, if there was a collective opinion put forward to support it. Despite my authority, I'm still a public servant and don't operate in a vacuum.   As for when, you've got me stumped on that one. I imagine within the week it'll be ready to be voted on."

ModelUSGov,362hpa,Logic_85,1 point,Fri May 15 18:48:27 2015 UTC,Any time a huge power shift occurs the party-line votes get stronger. Maybe the next congress can reign it in and get on the same page a little more often.

But after all, most parties are able to collaborate.  Other scenario: Democrats get 60% in both chambers, then yes, it's very likely Congress will get on the same page a little more often. :D"
ModelUSGov,362hpa,Eilanyan,2,Fri May 15 20:02:25 2015 UTC,"I think you will see in Model and IRL Congress, the Democrats and Republicans agree to neoliberalism capitalist economic policies and imperialist foreign policy all the time."

ModelUSGov,362hpa,Canadianman22,3,Fri May 15 23:44:42 2015 UTC,The GLP seems too have 2 members who are missing votes with some occurrence.
ModelUSGov,362hpa,risen2011,2,Fri May 15 16:07:12 2015 UTC,/u/thatassholeyahweh has a legitimate excuse.

ModelUSGov,362hpa,JerryLeRow,3,Fri May 15 16:31:39 2015 UTC,"Ah, thanks for the explanation. But - my thought - why do you not replace him with a member who has time to vote?"
ModelUSGov,362hpa,risen2011,2,Fri May 15 16:48:15 2015 UTC,"We can't simply replace him. Under Illinois law, I think there has to be a special election."
ModelUSGov,362hpa,JerryLeRow,2,Fri May 15 18:34:39 2015 UTC,And he doesn't want to step down either?
ModelUSGov,362hpa,risen2011,2,Fri May 15 18:47:08 2015 UTC,I cant speak for him or ask him to step down.
ModelUSGov,362hpa,JerryLeRow,2,Fri May 15 18:50:23 2015 UTC,"Oh I could do that.   /u/thatassholeyahweh , as you may have already noticed, some - including me - are not happy about you not showing up to most votes. I understand school takes a lot of time, but then you should consider stepping down as Representative. It's kind of unfair if people spend hours on bills that fail just because you don't have time to show up.   While we're at it, same counts for /u/PumpkinSmashing.  This only expresses my personal views and recommendations."

ModelUSGov,360cqd,schultejt,17,Fri May 15 00:52:00 2015 UTC,"Wait,... The subreddit was shut down yesterday?  You shouldn't leave.  When I was in high school and someone on the team did something stupid but wouldn't fess up we all got punished.  (And then we made the kid who did it wish he admitted it, but that's a different story.)  The end result was people eventually stopped doing stupid stuff.  I know the analogy isn't perfect but if it has a chance to stop these assholes from being assholes then it was worth it.    Personally I have never had a problem with any of your decisions as mod and would encourage you to reconsider.  Anyways without you we wouldn't have this sub right now and for that I am extremely grateful.  I wish you luck in whatever you are apart of next."
ModelUSGov,360cqd,tahey123,6,Fri May 15 01:34:28 2015 UTC,I completely agree with Representative Schultejt!

ModelUSGov,360cqd,lovelybone93,6,Fri May 15 02:06:51 2015 UTC,Seconded.

ModelUSGov,360cqd,Timanfya,12,Fri May 15 02:51:59 2015 UTC,The shutdown move was completely just and valid. I'll consider doing it for /r/mhoc too.   I really do hope you reconsider leaving.   You've created a fantastic subreddit and you should be proud.
ModelUSGov,360cqd,Duncs11,3,Fri May 15 15:34:09 2015 UTC,I'll consider doing it for /r/mhoc too.   Please don't.
ModelUSGov,360cqd,TheRealRailguy,3,Fri May 15 13:17:49 2015 UTC,No.  Even as a mod you do not have the right to hold a subreddit hostage.
ModelUSGov,360cqd,Timanfya,5,Sun May 17 11:30:41 2015 UTC,It isn't holding it hostage. You can close a subreddit any time for as long as you want.
ModelUSGov,360cqd,TheRealRailguy,3,Fri May 15 14:28:54 2015 UTC,"Just because you have the power and are a moderator does not mean the subreddit is yours to do anything you want with it.  A subreddit belongs to its community, not its moderators."
ModelUSGov,360cqd,schultejt,4,Fri May 15 14:46:40 2015 UTC,Sounds pretty communist to me.  Lort created the subreddit and has always reserved the right to do whatever they want with.
ModelUSGov,360cqd,Timanfya,5,Fri May 15 15:38:05 2015 UTC,No it doesn't. The community changes much more rapidly than the mod team.  If lort wants to close it down for a few hours he has every right to do that. If you don't like it then go somewhere else.

ModelUSGov,360cqd,IBiteYou,6,Fri May 15 00:59:36 2015 UTC,"Guess I'll be devil's advocate. The shutdown move wasn't stupid in the slightest. It was completely called for and overdue. My only complaint is that it didn't happen longer. Something has to be done about the downvoting. It is petty and ridiculous, and only shows (this is directed towards the down-voters) that your own viewpoint is so stupid not even you can think of a way to defend it.  I implore you to stay, lort. The only ones in the wrong are the downvoters that have plagued this sub."

No one is perfect, we all make dumb calls from time to time, but the work you have done for the sub is invaluable.   I would not be here, Septimussette and Pluralizer would not be here, no one would be here if it was not for you.

ModelUSGov,35vn87,schultejt,12,Thu May 14 02:08:50 2015 UTC,American workers are more at risk from employers trampling on their rights than unions.   But intimidation from employers and unions both will be dealt with harshly if I am confirmed.
ModelUSGov,35vn87,lovelybone93,6,Thu May 14 02:16:56 2015 UTC,"Ideally, what do you think should be the minimum wage?"
ModelUSGov,35vn87,awwwcat,8,Thu May 14 03:36:16 2015 UTC,The minimum wage should be $15 an hour ideally.   This will increase purchasing power and lift many people out of poverty.  No one who labors should live in squalor.
ModelUSGov,35vn87,lovelybone93,4,Thu May 14 04:29:43 2015 UTC,"How will you deal with the fact that many economic experts think that even raising the wage to $10.10 will cause significant unemployment? (CBO estimated 500,000 jobs)"
ModelUSGov,35vn87,SgtNicholasAngel,2,Thu May 14 16:54:53 2015 UTC,"Well, increasing purchasing power of our workers will stimulate the economy by having the poorest of our country getting a boost.   They're more likely to spend money than someone in a higher income bracket, stimulating the economy. See here.  A survey done by the university of Chicago, Booth school of business shows that companies wouldn't react negatively to a minimum wage hike. See here. Supplementary article. Another article with sources. And even a short article on minimum wage from the DoL.  Also, $15 an hour can be phased in over a period of time as they're doing in Seattle to minimize shocks to the economy."

ModelUSGov,35vn87,oughton42,3,Thu May 14 00:00:02 2015 UTC,"The living wage act is a step in the right direction for America and her workers, but I feel the floor is set too low, especially when the wage can be lower depending on the state.  The democratic workplace act I felt was a good piece of legislation that should've been implemented in order to give workers more say and power in the workplace."
ModelUSGov,35vn87,lovelybone93,3,Thu May 14 00:19:58 2015 UTC,"I am curious what experience /u/lovelybone93 has that could relate or help them in their position as the Secretary of Labor.

Edit for clarity and additional statement."
ModelUSGov,35vn87,lovelybone93,4,Wed May 13 23:22:24 2015 UTC,I'd like to change that   Can you give some specifics?
ModelUSGov,35vn87,IBiteYou,3,Thu May 14 00:08:48 2015 UTC,"More inspections of workplaces and records, harsher fines imposed on employers violating labor laws, especially employers impeding workers attempting to join or form a union."

ModelUSGov,35vn87,Canadianman22,3,Thu May 14 01:06:00 2015 UTC,"I would make changes to OSHA, the Wage and Hour division, and the EEOC, increasing staffing of these agencies in order to better serve our fellow Americans to reduce our response time to complaints, strengthening our workers and making America more productive as well with the decrease in accidents and injuries on the job. I'd also change the time limit of EEOC complaints from 180 days to 365 days.  It would also make sure that Americans aren't being exploited or discriminated against by their employer.  Edit for typo"

ModelUSGov,35vn87,lovelybone93,3,Thu May 14 02:30:36 2015 UTC,"Genetic information   What?   Disability   What do you mean by this? Some disabilities most certainly make a person unfit for certain jobs, or work entirely. I would hate to see businesses forced to hire people unsuited for the job they were hired for."

Ultimately, immigration needs to be reformed by the house and Senate here in MUSGOV, I can only do what would be within my power if confirmed."
ModelUSGov,35vn87,lovelybone93,2,Thu May 14 02:38:39 2015 UTC,Are you in favor of seeing illegal immigrants deported?  Or are you interested in seeing them employed?
ModelUSGov,35vn87,IBiteYou,2,Thu May 14 03:58:21 2015 UTC,"My position on illegal immigration is that the immigration system is very complex as is and it needs reform. Families shouldn't be broken up due to one's immigration status.  I call on the MUSGOV Senate and House to reform it, so our president rangerheart can sign it and put it in action.  I'd rather have Americans considered for jobs first, but everyone that labors deserves protections under the law."
ModelUSGov,35vn87,lovelybone93,3,Thu May 14 04:03:15 2015 UTC,that labors deserves protections under the law.   Even though their employment BREAKS the law?

The DoL is to protect workers from exploitation, for immigration, that would fall under the CBP/DHS.  The exploitation of illegal immigrants is due to unscrupulous employers, they're the ones to be punished severely, not a low-wage worker trying to scrape by."
ModelUSGov,35vn87,lovelybone93,3,Thu May 14 04:24:16 2015 UTC,"If confirmed, would you favor diversity and inclusion of sexual orientation over that of an employee's religious rights to freedom of speech and expression?"
ModelUSGov,35vn87,DEYoungRepublicans,3,Thu May 14 16:10:43 2015 UTC,"I cannot favor one person over another, I can only protect workers from discrimination and exploitation by employers.  Any case that clearly shows discrimination against an employee or prospective employee that's under a protected class would fall under my purview if confirmed.   I wouldn't take discrimination lightly and harsh penalties would occur in discrimination, harassment, and other cases where labor law/regulations were clearly violated.  That said, I would like to see a diverse workplace because America is such a diverse nation."
ModelUSGov,35vn87,lovelybone93,1 point,Thu May 14 18:41:25 2015 UTC,Would you attempt to force businesses to hire un-qualified employees simply to meet your definition of what a diverse work place should be?

The DoL is for fighting discrimination against protected classes, if a qualified applicant or employee was discriminated against and falls under a protected class, the DoL is obligated to pursue the case."
ModelUSGov,35vn87,lovelybone93,2,Thu May 14 19:07:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your clarification. I know these cases can be particularly difficult to prove, but are worth fighting none the less."
ModelUSGov,35vn87,Canadianman22,2,Thu May 14 20:07:20 2015 UTC,And I'll fight discrimination cases tooth and nail if confirmed. I'm here to clear up any issues anyone in MUSGOV may have.

ModelUSGov,35vn87,JerryLeRow,3,Thu May 14 07:15:53 2015 UTC,"Increasing minimum wage along with staffing of DoL offices, changing overtime provisions to anything over 8 hours a day or 40 hours a week to overtime pay, removing overtime and minimum wage exemptions for many fields, and hopefully implementing a civilian work corps in order to overhaul our aging infrastructure.   It takes many tools, but I believe that this is a good approach to increasing employment and reducing underemployment."

ModelUSGov,35tiqj,risen2011,1 point,Wed May 13 16:18:02 2015 UTC,"My understanding was that the submission did not go through the GLP's constitutional systems, so it would be best described as somewhere between you and the people who use the mail sub submitting it and the party submitting it."

ModelUSGov,35tiqj,JerryLeRow,5,Wed May 13 16:28:36 2015 UTC,"I hated to see our great model country smeared by such dissident. Although the path here was at times unclear and even often verbally violent, I am glad we arrived at such an outcome so that the elements of democracy may continue."
ModelUSGov,35tiqj,jacoby531,3,Wed May 13 16:43:11 2015 UTC,Wise decision.
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,SeptimusSette,7,Wed May 13 12:58:41 2015 UTC,"Hey all, I am the Republican member who worked with the two authors of the bill, mainly in creating the adjustment for the Cost of Living Index.   My main reason is that it is obvious that minimum wage workers have less purchasing power than they used to. Now, I don't advocate the widespread raising of minimum wages in a one size fits all fashion, so I worked with the authors of the bill to come to a compromise.   Rather than raise the minimum wage at a nation wide level and absolutely throw some state economies out of whack, I felt it would be best to address the individual economies of each state.  Therefore, each minimum wage worker will be compensated $9.20 worth of purchasing power, and it will stay that way no matter what. This is crucial, because any trade based economy demands people have resources to trade. People need money to buy things just as much as people need money to employ others. I think this legislation hits the sweet spot where both of these necessities can be met.  I'd love to open myself up to questions or comments from any of you alongside the authors of the bill."
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,jaywhoo,2,Wed May 13 15:10:59 2015 UTC,Question: Does Section 3 effectively mandate the minimum wage state by state?
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,risen2011,1 point,Wed May 13 17:40:25 2015 UTC,Effectively yes. It sets the minimum wage by the COLI of each state.
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,jaywhoo,1 point,Wed May 13 18:46:43 2015 UTC,/u/logic_85 is this constitutional?
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,risen2011,3,Wed May 13 19:04:36 2015 UTC,"Once again I want to comment that as I have yet to be confirmed, this is more my personal opinion and analysis, rather than an official statement.  That said, I don't see any constitutional issues with this amendment, and here is why:  US v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100 (1941) stated the following:   Since our decision in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379, it is no longer open to question that the fixing of a minimum wage is within the legislative power, and that the bare fact of its exercise is not a denial of due process under the Fifth more than under the Fourteenth Amendment.    Id. at 125.  Essentially, the Supreme Court held that the power given to congress to regulate interstate commerce included the power to regulate wages and hours of workers.    Now the question comes whether a COLI, individualized to each state, is within that grant of power to Congress by the Constitution.  I see no reason it is not.  While an individualized minimum wage may appear to be an issue of state's rights, protected under the 10th amendment, Wickard v. Filburn 317 U.S. 111 (1942) demonstrated that even intrastate activity, which may have an impact on interstate commerce, can be regulated by Congress.  While those decisions might seem dated, they have been utilized in recent decisions, such as Gonzalez v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005), wherein the court rejected the argument ""that a locally cultivated product that is used domestically rather than sold on the open market is not subject to federal regulation.""  Id. at 32-33.  Instead, they held that a large commercial market outside a locality subjected local marijuana use to federal regulation.  I see no difference here.  A local minimum wage appears to be intrastate, but the wider market for labor across the United States subjects these local, state-specific minimum wages to Congressional authority.  Unless another issue is at hand, I see no Constitutional issues with the proposed COLI initiative."
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,Logic_85,3,Wed May 13 19:33:06 2015 UTC,Thank you for your informative answer.
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,risen2011,1 point,Wed May 13 19:42:27 2015 UTC,That's probably a good question to ask. I don't see why it wouldn't be though.
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,jaywhoo,1 point,Wed May 13 19:20:51 2015 UTC,Does this take into account how large the states in this simulation are? The economies of Laramie and Los Angeles are very different.
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,evanb_,1 point,Wed May 13 19:47:31 2015 UTC,"That's actually a phenomenal question. I'd say that it was crafted with IRL states in mind, but could easily transition over if Sim states created individual economic policies."
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,jaywhoo,3,Wed May 13 20:03:00 2015 UTC,This bill is very roundabout way of tying to minimum wage to destitution. Poverty assumes one has a full tine caretaker working for free (relic of the 50s) and this doesn't even raise workers to the poverty line.
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,Eilanyan,1 point,Wed May 13 15:32:31 2015 UTC,Agreed.
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,lovelybone93,3,Wed May 13 21:52:05 2015 UTC,When it gets to the senate I want to change section 2-1 and change it to 40 hours a week. 2-1 because waiters would be getting to much money and the restaurants would lose all of their money.  Second because it's commonly accepted that a work week is 40 hours a week.
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,Smitty9913,3,Wed May 13 16:05:11 2015 UTC,"Permalink to where I explain why I chose 36 instead of 40  Instead of changing it to 40, how about keep it at 36, but add, ""Full-time is defined as 36 hours per week unless otherwise noted in an employee handbook with legitimate justification.""  Or something similar. Given I am one of the authors of this bill, I would love to talk with you on this."
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,Xarasystral,1 point,Wed May 13 16:38:29 2015 UTC,I feel like every log book would just say 40 hours then.  And what about the thing with Waiters?
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,Smitty9913,2,Wed May 13 17:13:15 2015 UTC,"Waiters and waitresses should be paid the same. We should eliminate the tip culture in this country. By doing this, the tip culture ends, and we can ensure that waiters and waitresses working just as hard as anyone else is properly compensated instead of relying on the customers' willingness to participate in a societal norm."
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,Xarasystral,2,Wed May 13 17:33:23 2015 UTC,But this tipping doesn't just end overnight. Why not have that part go into effect in let's say a year so the word can get out fully. And tipping makes waiters work harder. You wouldn't want for America to turn into other parts of the world where there isn't tipping so people are lazy and not as good workers.
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,Smitty9913,2,Wed May 13 17:36:35 2015 UTC,"If the senate wants to make that change, where the tipping wage change will happen something such as 180 days after the bill goes into effect, therefore 270 days after passage of the bill, I would be okay with that. I'm sure that /u/oughton42 would be as well?  In order to increase it's possible success within the senate, of course, too. Compromise is the lifeblood of democracy, which is why I am always willing to discuss this with members of the other parties."
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,Xarasystral,1 point,Wed May 13 20:36:03 2015 UTC,How about we do that and change work week to 40 hours a week.
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,Smitty9913,2,Thu May 14 15:05:17 2015 UTC,"If that's what must be done in order to appease you and result in a more likely chance of this bill passing the Senate, then do so."
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,Xarasystral,1 point,Thu May 14 15:33:56 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be opposed to a delay on the tipping portion either, your concerns do make sense."
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,oughton42,3,Wed May 13 21:01:00 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love the spirit of this bill and think that adjusting the minimum wage, per cost-of-living, is certainly the most responsible way to go about doing so.  My dilemma is, and I'm going to use my home state of Illinois as an example, cost of living in Chicago is significantly higher than it is anywhere else in the state.  I do certainly hope that the much lower costs-of-living elsewhere in the state aren't going to modify the SCOLI to where Chicago minimum wage employees are making less than a living wage."
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,zachfess,3,Wed May 13 17:50:53 2015 UTC,"I have to say, my party has always been against minimum wage. But this bill seems to guarantee that all workers make at least a livable wage, which is what we all want to achieve. I very much like this bill."
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,Eilanyan,1 point,Wed May 13 20:03:41 2015 UTC,"What is your view of what a ""livable"" wage is?"
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,zachfess,3,Wed May 13 21:22:10 2015 UTC,"...A wage that can sufficiently pay for the minimal cost of living. I though that the term ""Livable Wage"" would be quite clear."
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,Eilanyan,1 point,Wed May 13 21:26:55 2015 UTC,"17,222.40 is greater then poverty for one ($11,670) but not for single parent two kids (19,790) and poverty assumes that the household has a full time caretaker working for free (1950's stay at home mom). This bill is a step towards getting workers out of poverty, but not the most vunerable (poor with kids)."
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,zachfess,3,Wed May 13 21:32:36 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, can you clarify what you are saying? That a livable wage is different for certain people depending on their situation?"
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,Eilanyan,2,Thu May 14 01:10:48 2015 UTC,"This is only a living wage if you consider working full time 40 hours a week and being unable to support anyone but yourself is a living wage. In someway it totally is, but the quality of a life (for again, full time worker) is pretty low and hurts the ""families"" that politicians love to bring up."
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,dreasdif118,2,Thu May 14 01:18:48 2015 UTC,"I give a lot of credit to all parties involved in this bill for the compromise and thoroughness. Unfortunately, I am going to have to vote nay on the amended version. There are some States that have 125-150% COLI and that could raise the minimum wage so much that it would damage the State economy and make inflation skyrocket. Once again, I applaud the authors of the bill, but I do not think it would be pragmatic for myself to vote in the affirmative."
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,Xarasystral,2,Wed May 13 14:35:56 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry about your concerns. The purpose of this bill is to ensure that people have the same purchasing power in every state.  For example, if the state's COLI is 90%, the yearly wage is $15,500.16. This results in a minimum wage of $8.28/hr. Although lower than the $9.20, it's purchasing power is still the same as an area with a COLI of 100%.  If it is 150%, the yearly wage is $25,833.60. This results only in a minimum wage of $13.80/hr. Although higher than the $9.20, it's purchasing power is still the same as an area with a COLI of 100%.  Regardless of the state's COLI, this should not negatively effect businesses nor cause inflation to skyrocket, unless that state's economy, as well as businesses, currently survive off of purposefully keeping its employees in poverty."
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,dreasdif118,2,Wed May 13 15:01:27 2015 UTC,"I understand where you are coming from, but an increase in minimum wage like that for the States that have over 100% COLI will raise the COLI and raise prices because businesses won't be able to afford their employees and low priced products. If it were more gradual or had a cap on the wage increase then I would vote yea."
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,evanb_,2,Wed May 13 15:22:40 2015 UTC,Section Four is unnecessary. States already have the power to set a minimum wage.
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,TheRealRailguy,3,Wed May 13 19:48:25 2015 UTC,It's pretty clear - raising the minmum wage leads to higher unemployment.  Businesses never just eat costs.  I urge everyone to vote no.
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,Canadianman22,4,Wed May 13 13:52:04 2015 UTC,"Sorry but I must disagree with you. In the grand scheme of things, employee wages are one of the lowest costs most businesses will face.   A business spends far more money on a great deal more things than employee wages. Not only that but companies that rely on minimum wage workers tend to be massive multinational companies that make billions of dollars of profit. The labor force they employee is the only thing that keeps them in business, and the thought they will let people go is insane.   They have minimum staffing requirements and will fill them. They will eat the costs as they will not want to shut down or be seen as giving lesser service, as that is what a lot of businesses use to differentiate themselves, quality of service."
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,schultejt,2,Wed May 13 15:24:05 2015 UTC,"If they can't let go of staff, they are going to raise costs. Businesses never just eat cost if they can help it."
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,Canadianman22,3,Wed May 13 16:42:13 2015 UTC,Companies that rely on on minimum wage workers do tend to be multinational companies. These companies will not raises prices nor will they cut staff numbers. They will simply pay the cost of doing business.
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,IBiteYou,1 point,Wed May 13 16:55:12 2015 UTC,Companies that rely on on minimum wage workers do tend to be multinational companies.    Do you have a citation for this?
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,oughton42,1 point,Wed May 13 18:54:31 2015 UTC,"This bill is an example of how people can come together, compromise, and create something that works for everyone; it is the result of a Republican, a Democrat, and a Green-Left collaboration that proves that the Parties don't always have to try and subvert each other.  The point of the Living Wage Act is to ensure that the 3.6 million Americans working at or below the minimum wage are guaranteed a salary that allows them to afford the basics of life regardless of the state of the broader economy. Too many Americans, many of whom have families, work long hours for low wages, creating a cycle of poverty that this bill aims to break.  Also, it's important to note that it doesn't raise the minimum wage's purchasing power -- it just changes the number from a static one to a fluid one that changes with the economy. Inflation has made it so that the current minimum wage is simply not enough to afford food, housing, clothing, and other necessities while also trying to pay for education and training to get better careers and break out of poverty.  The Living Wage Act is a bill that, as we've already shown, is agreeable to all the Parties. Help protect the working classes: Vote Yes."
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,ben1204,1 point,Wed May 13 14:18:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'd vote for this if I were a Senator, as it's a step forward. But the minimum wage needs to be higher than this."
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,laffytaffyboy,2,Wed May 13 15:59:08 2015 UTC,I'm glad to know you support this. We can always push for a higher state minimum wage.
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,Eilanyan,1 point,Wed May 13 22:05:16 2015 UTC,"I do have a question though as CLI but not inflation appears to be in effect, so will the base still be 9.20 when 9.20 is very low in 2025?"
ModelUSGov,35tq0v,Xarasystral,2,Wed May 13 21:20:09 2015 UTC,"I believe before 2025, another bill would have been written or passed that would change the base. It all depends on the political and economical landscape of our country between now and ten years from now."

It's sad that this may require us to work longer, but I am not sure of any other solution to this problem."
ModelUSGov,35tpps,cameronc65,3,Wed May 13 13:25:02 2015 UTC,Raise the tax exception from its laughable low (or eliminate it). Wall off SS funds so surpluses cannot be used for budget.
ModelUSGov,35tpps,Eilanyan,2,Wed May 13 15:44:12 2015 UTC,I think that would be a good amendment to this bill.
ModelUSGov,35tpps,cameronc65,1 point,Wed May 13 15:44:52 2015 UTC,The only reason social security is in the red is that the government has been borrowing from the fund for decades. The problem isn't with social security.
ModelUSGov,35tpps,IAmRoot,6,Wed May 13 18:44:51 2015 UTC,"I oppose this entire bill. I appreciate the willingness of the Republicans to talk about these important issues. These are plain and simply though, bad ideas.  There are much better ways to sustain the longevity of Social Security, that don't hurt it's recipients (lifting the cap, raising the payroll tax). Keep in mind that people still retire well before the retirement age. The average retirement age is 62, which is a rise from the past few years. However, as the economy settles down, I don't see this age rapidly rising. The retirement age is the important statistic, not the life expectancy. When you focus on the life expectancy, it's people at the top income level who make up most of the rise.  Raising the retirement age is also unfair to blue collar workers. Many people in physically demanding jobs, like construction, cannot perform work once they get into their sixties. This will force them to work past their physical abilities.   Now....don't even get me started on why privatization won't work.   This is a good start  Highlights  -It won't help the solvency problem. Money that could have otherwise gone toward shoring up the system will go into private accounts.  -Privatization will only lose the working class money. Most investments are irrational. In Britain, where a similar system has been adopted, there has been a problem of predatory investment firms losing investors money.  -A new bureaucracy, that will require large amounts of money to concoct, will have to be established."

ModelUSGov,35tpps,IBiteYou,2,Thu May 14 01:46:39 2015 UTC,"Up to four percent of taxable wages, a maximum of $1,000, is allowed to be diverted from the Payroll Tax by an employee into private retirement accounts.   Fully privatize, no, but my criticisms apply to ANY attempts to further do so."
ModelUSGov,35tpps,ben1204,6,Thu May 14 01:51:18 2015 UTC,"Social Security undoubtedly faces a significant financial shortfall in its current form.  My question to the GOP would be, what exactly are the numbers on this?  Will this completely reduce the shortfall?  How many more years will this make Social Security solvent for?  Scrapping the payroll tax cap, according to the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration, will 'reduce the long-term financial shortfall' by about 70 to 80 percent.  I think ensuring the promise of social security to our seniors should be at the very top of our list of priorities, but I hardly fair to slash that promise, under the premise that the US government doesn't have enough money to make good on their promise.  End the regressive Social Security tax."
ModelUSGov,35tpps,Eilanyan,2,Wed May 13 17:41:20 2015 UTC,That shortfall means it will dole out at a lower rate not nothing as well. Do you know what the shortfall would be after scrapping the cap? 95% of benefits?
ModelUSGov,35tpps,Eilanyan,4,Wed May 13 21:17:21 2015 UTC,So seniors lose out on thousands of dollars they deserve but continue the underfunding and raiding of social security.
ModelUSGov,35tpps,dreasdif118,3,Wed May 13 15:35:28 2015 UTC,"It doesn't ""screw"" current or upcoming seniors at all. It only affects people in the younger generations younger than 55."
ModelUSGov,35tpps,Eilanyan,4,Wed May 13 15:39:00 2015 UTC,It maintains the 67 age and takes money (thousands per year added on) from younger generations (including those hip 55 year olds) in order to pay for government incompetence.
ModelUSGov,35tpps,dreasdif118,2,Wed May 13 15:42:35 2015 UTC,"How does it pay for incompetence? It raises the retirement age since people are living longer and the diversion isn't to keep, it is put into your own retirement account. All that does is give a little more control to the people."
ModelUSGov,35tpps,Eilanyan,3,Wed May 13 15:44:38 2015 UTC,"Past governments have raided social security surpluses and have set a tax exemption so low(wages up to 110,100) that social security can only pay 75% in 2037."
ModelUSGov,35tpps,dreasdif118,2,Wed May 13 15:47:26 2015 UTC,What past governments are you talking about?

ModelUSGov,35tpps,dreasdif118,2,Wed May 13 16:02:28 2015 UTC,"Oh I understand. In your other comment you proposed a Lockbox amendment to the bill in order to protect funding of Social Security, right?"
ModelUSGov,35tpps,Eilanyan,1 point,Wed May 13 16:03:49 2015 UTC,Yes. Reagan funded the baby boom in the 80s through tax increases but it was spent.
ModelUSGov,35tpps,dreasdif118,2,Wed May 13 16:14:38 2015 UTC,"If you write a version of the Lockbox amendment and send it to one of the Representatives to post on the thread in /r/modelushouse, I will take a look to see if it will fit into the bill."

ModelUSGov,35tpps,jsmith18486,4,Wed May 13 13:03:38 2015 UTC,This won't do enough.  We spend too much on social security.  It's a doomed program that needs to be privitized.
ModelUSGov,35tpps,ehbrums1,11,Wed May 13 13:54:41 2015 UTC,This comment made me literally cringe.
ModelUSGov,35tpps,risen2011,9,Wed May 13 14:45:25 2015 UTC,Should we also privatize the public drinking water while we're at it?
ModelUSGov,35tpps,Eilanyan,5,Wed May 13 14:52:06 2015 UTC,Don't forget to privatize prisons and fire departments too!
ModelUSGov,35tpps,ben1204,6,Wed May 13 15:39:18 2015 UTC,Privatise cubic feet of air to stop global warming!
ModelUSGov,35tpps,Prospo,3,Wed May 13 15:44:55 2015 UTC,Or oxygen?
ModelUSGov,35tpps,Canadianman22,1 point,Wed May 13 18:19:51 2015 UTC,It already is.
ModelUSGov,35tpps,Danotto94,4,Thu May 14 21:54:48 2015 UTC,"While privatization can be a good thing and lead to lower spending and better service, I fail to see how privatizing the social security system would be a good thing."
ModelUSGov,35tpps,DEYoungRepublicans,2,Wed May 13 15:02:35 2015 UTC,Privitized? So it needs to be made into a Virtual Private Network?
ModelUSGov,35tpps,Logic_85,2,Wed May 13 14:57:54 2015 UTC,"Your exactly right.   The Social Security Administration will spend $954 billion in 2015, which is about $7,756 for every household in the nation. - Read more."
ModelUSGov,35tpps,dreasdif118,2,Wed May 13 15:56:31 2015 UTC,"HOLD ON HOLD ON  Subsection 3.1: four percent diverted from the payroll tax into private retirement accounts?  Which payroll taxes are you talking about--FICA, FUTA, or SUTA?  Why divert even MORE money away from social security?  Will that money be tax deferred?  What effect will that have on end-of-year taxes?    What is wrong with the current private retirement account system?  Employees can defer up to $20,500 a year into a private retirement account, TAX FREE.  Why add another $1,000 just to throw a wrench into the system?  What kind of private retirement account does that need to be funneled into--IRA, 401k, 403b, 457, deferred comp, and would it be required to go to a qualified or non-qualified plan under ERISA?"
ModelUSGov,35tpps,Logic_85,2,Wed May 13 16:10:35 2015 UTC,It allows employees to divert a small portion of their actual Social Security account to a private account under their control. This gives people more control and it will reduce some spending for the government.
ModelUSGov,35tpps,dreasdif118,2,Wed May 13 16:15:26 2015 UTC,How will the government account for those diversions when that individual files for Social Security at retirement age?  And will those diversions subtract from the person's retirement credits needed to qualify for social security?
ModelUSGov,35tpps,Logic_85,2,Wed May 13 16:20:38 2015 UTC,They will be able to know through the payroll tax returns people file throughout their working career. And the work credits will not be effected.
ModelUSGov,35tpps,dreasdif118,1 point,Wed May 13 16:35:16 2015 UTC,"Right, but HOW? Do they get less money at retirement? How much less?  Also, all my other questions I asked."
ModelUSGov,35tpps,SomeRealShit,2,Wed May 13 16:37:54 2015 UTC,"If they have diverted some portions of their own Social Security account then yes, but it wouldn't be that significant. Also, with the increase in retirement age then the Trust Fund will be able to keep paying beneficiaries."
ModelUSGov,35tpps,Logic_85,1 point,Wed May 13 16:40:14 2015 UTC,I believe the early retirement age should stay as is since our life expectancy isn't really going up as fast as your increasing retirement age.
ModelUSGov,35tpps,Eilanyan,2,Wed May 13 17:27:51 2015 UTC,"Retirement age when SS was implemented was 65, and a 65 year old was expected to live to about 77-78 at the time.  Now, a 65 year old is expected to live until about 85-86.  We've added 8-9 years to the average life expectancy since we implemented social security.  It makes sense to bump retirement age up to account for this change."
ModelUSGov,35tpps,Logic_85,2,Wed May 13 18:20:55 2015 UTC,How many of those people pushing the number up are wealthier individuals that don't rely on SS for a living?
ModelUSGov,35tpps,Eilanyan,2,Wed May 13 21:15:29 2015 UTC,"I doubt we have solid data on that.  We can guess, but you know as well as I do that there are plenty of rich folks who die young and poor folks who die old, with plenty in-between."
ModelUSGov,35tpps,Logic_85,2,Wed May 13 21:47:16 2015 UTC,"Well okay, in clearer terms, I don't see why we should punish the working and middle class for living longer then their parents. As someone else has mentioned, it's not like its easier now to work at 66 because you will live a few years longer."
ModelUSGov,35s1dg,rangerheart0,13,Wed May 13 00:59:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for making this statement, while I am unhappy with how the senate appointment went. I look forward to working with /u/awwwcat and the rest of the senators through the rest of the term. Hopefully we can put these recent tensions behind us and work towards being a more effective senate."
ModelUSGov,35s1dg,awwwcat,7,Wed May 13 01:08:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you Mr. President. It is important that all of us do what our constituents expect... lead. Despite what has occurred,  I am confident this can be a productive term."
ModelUSGov,35s1dg,jsmith18486,7,Wed May 13 02:35:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for the matter, we don't really have anything against you. We find the process in which you were appointed to be undemocratic, but that's not on your part."

ModelUSGov,35rbfs,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,2,Tue May 12 21:31:57 2015 UTC,I would be happy to answer questions as many questions here in the comments as I am able.
ModelUSGov,35rbfs,JerryLeRow,2,Tue May 12 22:09:56 2015 UTC,Regarding Ohio-class... I hope you mean one billion :D
ModelUSGov,35rbfs,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,2,Tue May 12 22:23:18 2015 UTC,"Well this could turn into an interesting discussion, but the Ohio Iowa-class battleship systems are, in my opinion, an obsolete military technology that has little room in modern operations and military theory. However, I would not want to completely defund the program, as changes in military theory, practice, and strategy are constantly happening and it would obviously not serve the United States well to be unprepared for such changes."
ModelUSGov,35rbfs,JerryLeRow,2,Tue May 12 22:37:07 2015 UTC,"So you're serious, cutting from 1,300 million down to 1 million?"
ModelUSGov,35rbfs,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,2,Wed May 13 06:40:15 2015 UTC,"In terms of the ~Ohio Iowa-class modernization? Completely. I've argued this for hours with people: I don't think it's an efficient use of money in a budget crisis, when we could build over 130 M1A1 Abrams tanks, a vehicle that has been proven useful, for the same amount. (Not that I'm saying we should build 130 more than we are planning at this point already.)  Like I said, I'm not counting the program out entirely, but the complete dominance of the American Navy and the 100% proven superiority of the aircraft carrier in naval surface warfare basically make the project silly in which to invest more than cursory research. In an ideal world, there would be more money and perhaps the program could start out stronger, which would allow for more accurate resting and research, but since we're pinching pennies I've got to weigh against the battleships."
ModelUSGov,35rbfs,JerryLeRow,2,Wed May 13 07:01:51 2015 UTC,"Speaking of the Abrams: German Rheinmetall/KMW developed the new Leopard 2 Revolution MBT (which they want to sell to Saudi Arabia too), Russia has the new T14 Armata, and I'm pretty sure the chinese will upgrade their tanks.  The Abrams is effective, yes, but it's also an older model and, based on what I've heard, pretty easy to destroy when you know what part to target. It has been upgraded over the last decades several times, but so was the Humvee. Do you think it's time to develop a new MBT?  About that 100% superiority of our CSGs... Want to spend more on defenes mechanisms? E.g. more gatling-guns to destroy approaching rockets or land-ship missiles?"
ModelUSGov,35rbfs,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,1 point,Wed May 13 09:02:56 2015 UTC,"Actually MBT research is definitely going on and the newest list of upgrades for the Abrams looks very promising, including more advanced composite armor and a long-range, independently aimed guided missile armament.  Meanwhile, the Abrams is actually capable of faster speeds than the Armata and about equivalent with the Leopard, while the main gun on both the Leopard and the Abrams are variations of the same weapon and both are produced by Rheinmetall/KMW. (The most recent Leopard actually has a slightly longer gun, but the bore is the same and the distinctions don't make a significant operational difference.) So, while the Abrams is an older model with its faults, research is going on exploring the possibility of a newer MBT, and the M1A1 is not behind the competition, despite its age.  Regarding your second point, the new Gerald R. Ford class of aircraft carriers has considerably more defense systems than previous classes. Not only is it equipped with incredibly advanced radar and detection systems, each carrier's radar is independently operated by giant IBM supercomputers like this one. There is no human interaction or room for error except for maintenance and installation.  Besides the regular Phalanx gatling guns, each carrier has four rocket-based anti-missile defense systems. The first one launched is being fitted with a laser-based anti-missile defense system as well that is undergoing live testing to improve and perfect the technology."
ModelUSGov,35rbfs,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,2,Thu May 14 01:16:01 2015 UTC,"Excuse me, I may have misunderstood what you were asking from the beginning, or may have misspoke in my statement above. Let me go back through what I said.  Fast Edit: I apologize; I did indeed make a mistake.

Certainly not me.  Second, I wasn't trying to say anything about the GL, or any Party. I was just pointing out a simple fact that anyone can recognize. I have very purposefully not stated my opinions on the recent controversies; partly because I don't think there are people holding their breaths in anticipation of my thoughts, and partly because I try to avoid the outright partisanship that I think these events have created (on all sides, and not from everyone)."

ModelUSGov,35p6mh,ben1204,3,Wed May 13 00:56:55 2015 UTC,"Ok, but it is not within the Senate's power to expel another Senator or appointment they believe to be immoral."
ModelUSGov,35p6mh,todoloco16,3,Wed May 13 01:00:33 2015 UTC,I agree. I do not support such an action. I was simply clarifying the situation as was asked.
ModelUSGov,35p6mh,evanb_,3,Wed May 13 01:15:43 2015 UTC,"A member of the Senate from the GL party resigned, and a Democrat was appointed to his spot. While perhaps not strictly unconstitutional, the people voted for the GL party, so giving the seat to a democrat is undemocratic and possibly unethical.   This is neither unethical nor that rare.  Though I know our simulation is often divorced from reality, there have been numerous examples of governors appointing members of their party to replace departing Senators of another party, most recently being Chris Christie in replacing Frank Lautenberg."
ModelUSGov,35p6mh,todoloco16,2,Wed May 13 02:03:55 2015 UTC,"So since it has happened before it makes it ethical? Sure it's legal, but that doesn't mean it is the right thing to do. You can't tell me that replacing a democratically elected senator with someone from an opposing party doesn't at least seem partisan. With that said, the replacement luckily seems competent and I wish him luck."
ModelUSGov,35p6mh,evanb_,2,Wed May 13 03:06:45 2015 UTC,"I was elaborating on the second point since the first seemed obvious.  Which part of this action do you oppose – the democratic election of the state's governor, or the governor's Constitutionally delegated responsibility?"
ModelUSGov,35p6mh,todoloco16,3,Wed May 13 03:14:50 2015 UTC,"Plus the fact that Canadaman for all intents and purposes lied. He said he would appoint in good faith a member of the GL party, waited for our member to resign, and then did exactly the opposite."
ModelUSGov,35p6mh,evanb_,3,Wed May 13 03:22:52 2015 UTC,"There is no suggestion that this is the case. The line of questioning revealed that the candidate suggested by the G-L Party was not, in the Governor's opinion, suitable for the job."
ModelUSGov,35p6mh,todoloco16,2,Wed May 13 03:24:07 2015 UTC,The replacement of a democratically elected member of the GL party by a non-elected member of the democratic party. People voted for a GL canidate and now have a democratic one. That's the part that bothers me if you must know.
ModelUSGov,35p6mh,evanb_,3,Wed May 13 03:21:23 2015 UTC,So your complaint is purely partisan and has nothing to do with the ethical nature of the action.
ModelUSGov,35p6mh,todoloco16,2,Wed May 13 03:22:41 2015 UTC,"I would have the same complaint if a Republican did it to a democrat, or if a GL did it to a libertarian. It is the dishonesty and neglect for what the people voted for that bothers me, not that my party lost a member (especially since the new member seems more than capable)"
ModelUSGov,35p6mh,evanb_,2,Wed May 13 03:24:33 2015 UTC,"So you believe the appointment process should be left up to the Party of the departing Senator and not the Senator's state Governor, as the Constitution would delegate?"
ModelUSGov,35p6mh,todoloco16,2,Wed May 13 03:27:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying the process should be changed (although if it were an issue that was discussed thoroughly and an ammendment was made with proper procedures I would support it). I'm only saying that on an ethical level, and in the spirit of democracy, a GL canidate should have been chosen over a member of the governor's own party. People voted for a GL, not a democrat, and ignoring what the people actually voted for just to appoint a member of your own party is the true show of partisanship."
ModelUSGov,35p6mh,ben1204,2,Wed May 13 03:33:40 2015 UTC,He's guilty of being a Democrat caught in a Green-Left partisan witch hunt.
ModelUSGov,35p6mh,ben1204,7,Wed May 13 15:37:50 2015 UTC,"This is a completely preposterous idea that I urge all legislators to vote against.  It was well within /u/candianman22's power to appoint the person who he felt was the best Senate replacement. Governors in America have a long history of appointing Senators who they believe will simply be the best. It doesn't matter what political party the departing Senator is of. Even when Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg died, Governor Christie appointed a Republican to replace him.  /u/Canadianman22 has done nothing illegal or unconstitutional. There is nothing in the constitution or written statute that says Governors must appoint Senators with similar views to the departing one.  You are welcome to dislike his replacement as much as you want. And GLP members are free to use this kind of method of appointment if they are Governors. But this is a power that gives leeway to the Governor's choice.  Should this resolution pass, I'll file an amicus brief to the Supreme Court."
ModelUSGov,35p6mh,greenpaddy,15,Wed May 13 00:40:57 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily sure the Green-Left is ""protecting democracy"" by keeping the people of the Central State without a second Senator.  Sounds more like ""protecting partisan interests"" to me."
ModelUSGov,35p6mh,Logic_85,12,Tue May 12 16:51:06 2015 UTC,What a petty motion. Every single procedure has been followed to a T. This is just a petty and pathetic motion from the Green Left.

McCormack has been cited here, and I think that case is clear precedent for what should happen in this case.    The opinion states:   In short, both the intention of the Framers, to the extent it can be determined, and an examination of the basic principles of our democratic system persuade us that the Constitution does not vest in the Congress a discretionary power to deny membership by a majority vote.   Powell v. McCormack, 395 US 486, 548 (1969).  At best, the Senate has the opportunity to expel /u/awwcat by a 2/3 vote, in line with Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution, or to judge his qualifications to serve as a senator, generally.  The Constitution does not permit Congress the right to refuse to seat a member.  If this vote passes by a majority, it is my opinion that the Supreme Court would strike it down, as unconstitutional."

The Governor did his job by appointing /u/awwwcat to the Senate, he did not need a vote, it is his enumerated duty to do this. This Senate SHOULD NOT expell /u/awwwcat in the interest of states' rights and maintaining the republic."
ModelUSGov,35p6mh,Oslovite,5,Tue May 12 15:59:56 2015 UTC,"I believe this resolution is unconstitutional, as the Supreme Court ruled on a similar case in 1969 in Powell v. McCormack"
ModelUSGov,35p6mh,ShamWowNY,9,Tue May 12 11:42:50 2015 UTC,"That resolution was about excluding a duly elected person from being sworn in. Once that person is sworn in, they can be expulsed by a two-thirds vote."
ModelUSGov,35p6mh,Oslovite,3,Tue May 12 11:49:15 2015 UTC,"Ah, you're right, I stand corrected. However, the bill should be reworded to say that it is an expulsion, as barring a senator from their seat is unconstitutional"
ModelUSGov,35p6mh,CrossBowGuy237,3,Tue May 12 13:17:10 2015 UTC,I agree.
ModelUSGov,35m53x,SeptimusSette,17,Mon May 11 17:11:48 2015 UTC,"Since I expect this thread will probably become uncivil soon, I will recount the details of the events here, and explain my thought process as they occurred.   I left the senate and my party to focus on moderating. I felt that making political arguments hurt my credibility as a mod, and that being a mod stopped me from supporting the GLP to the best of my ability. Leaving the senate would allow a GLP member to be as zealous in the pursuit of communism as I wished I could be, but wasn't able to. I contacted /u/canadianman22 about getting a GLP replacement. He said he would approve my candidate after asking them a few questions. He said this:    As for your senate replacement, as per our agreement, I will be asking him a few questions. Nothing much, just to get to know them a bit better. I already have a speech typed up to post once your resign, and I will honor my agreement, even though it will make me hated by every party in the simulation.  I sent him  /u/jsmith18486, an individual who seemed like an upstanding member if the GLP.  Due to /u/canadianman22's response, I should note here that our views on revolution are nearly identical. We both believe that revolutions are necessary This conversation occurred (I am in bold):    Also, after talking to the only candidate, I am less inclined to appoint and more inclined to hold a special election, which your choice could run in. You seem like a moderate and he is very radical. I really do want to appoint a GLP member to take your seat, but a moderate not a radical. Keep that in mind before you officially resign, as if you do, and this person is the only candidate you put forward, I will move for a special election so the voters can decide if they want a radical communist representing them. They voted for a moderate candidate (you) that is what they should get. I don't think he is any more radical than me. We both agree on topics of the necessity for revolution, etc. I have had talks with you and know where you stand on issues and I have that individuals answers. There is quite the gap. I have to stand behind the person I select, I hope you understand that.  I figured at this point it was better to just find a different replacement, even though I reject the idea that my candidate was more radical than me. I chose /u/bluefisch200, who in all honesty seems like more of a Green than a radical communist. At this point, /u/canadianman22 raised the residency question in modmail.  We have never had a residency rule before (even I had switched states between elections). I responded to the modmail that ""In the past we have had no concept of residency, but I would like to see the other mod's thoughts."" No other moderators responded, and I heard nothing for a few days until /u/canadianman22 put forwards the current replacement.   These are the events from my perspective. ALL SIDES: Keep discussion civil, lest your receive the ban hammer."

ModelUSGov,35m53x,rangerheart0,2,Tue May 12 17:04:47 2015 UTC,Your state government didn't exist when Septimus was elected.
ModelUSGov,35m53x,ben1204,1 point,Tue May 12 18:18:41 2015 UTC,And now it does. The state existed but the protocol for replacing a senator changed when we established the government in this state.
ModelUSGov,35m53x,rangerheart0,8,Tue May 12 18:40:46 2015 UTC,"I am incredibly disappointed with the governors choice of replacement. It undermines democracy as well as what the constituents voted for. This sets a disturbing precedent. It would be in the best interest of everyone if governors appointed people with similar views to the previous senator, regardless of their party affiliation."
ModelUSGov,35m53x,ben1204,6,Mon May 11 18:15:59 2015 UTC,"This does not undermine Democracy, nor set a precedent. It is within the Governor's power to appoint for vacant Senate seats. It is well established that Governors, even upon the death of Senators, will appoint individuals best suited for the job, even if they may be from a different party. For example, Governor Christie in New Jersey appointed a Republican after Senator Lautenberg's death. It is a power reserved to the Governor, and he/she may appoint whomever they feel is best for the seat.  I ask what you propose as an alternative for appointing this Senator. It is entirely unprecedented that a President would be able to appoint a Senator. This is the most realistic option. There must be a Senator for the constituents of the Central State until an election can be held."
ModelUSGov,35m53x,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,6,Mon May 11 20:22:09 2015 UTC,"In the election people did not vote for a democratic senator they voted for a senator like septimussette. As such I believe it would be in the best interest to have someone of similar views appointed to the senate. In this instance septimussette suggested someone of similar if not exactly the same views. I do not request the power to appoint a senator, however I do ask that the former senators choices for senate be used until as you said an election is held."
ModelUSGov,35m53x,awwwcat,5,Mon May 11 20:57:47 2015 UTC,"You are free to exercise your power in this manner if you are a governor. However, this is a governor exclusive privilege, and /u/canadianman22 has done nothing illegal nor unconstitutional."
ModelUSGov,35m53x,rangerheart0,6,Mon May 11 21:00:19 2015 UTC,"I am not saying he has done anything illegal or unconstitutional. That doesn't disallow me to disagree with, or pursue measures to reverse what he has done."
ModelUSGov,35m53x,awwwcat,1 point,Mon May 11 21:01:23 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  However, I believe that it is the proper role of the governor to appoint the person he thinks will best represent the Senate. How he chooses to do this is his choice. As long as there's an election held, I have no problem with this."
ModelUSGov,35m53x,rangerheart0,3,Mon May 11 21:03:31 2015 UTC,"If you like, I can just execute a nice, bloodless coup and you can seat whomever you want.  That honestly might make fewer people upset."
ModelUSGov,35m53x,Gohte,7,Tue May 12 12:52:48 2015 UTC,The precedent already existed.  It was your party that was attempting to change it.
ModelUSGov,35m53x,awwwcat,7,Mon May 11 18:19:27 2015 UTC,I believe this is the first instance that this as occurred within the context of the simulation. That is what I was referring to.
ModelUSGov,35m53x,Gohte,6,Mon May 11 18:20:18 2015 UTC,"If you have anyone to be upset with, it is /u/septimussette . He could have cleared the way for anyone else in your party but ran. The senate seats were specifically designed to reflect individual candidates rather than parties. I received the second most votes for the position.  Your party is attempting to undermine voters, and your senator is responsible for this situation. We are simply following regular protocol.  You just want to change it because you aren't happy with the result."
ModelUSGov,35m53x,awwwcat,6,Mon May 11 18:26:57 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of instances in which following regular protocol could be seen as inappropriate. For example the constitution allows the senate and house to expel members with a  2/3 vote. If the GLP had 2/3 of the congress and then voted to expel all the members of the other parties creating a virtual single party state. No one would be arguing that that is undemocratic even though it is following regular procedure. I would find that incredibly inappropriate same as this.  I realize that it looks like there is a conflict of interest here as myself and the previous senator used to be o the same party, but I honestly think that governors should appoint senators to fill vacancies with people of similar views. It is nothing personal."
ModelUSGov,35m53x,Gohte,4,Mon May 11 18:35:13 2015 UTC,We all ran for Senate after being told that we had control of our seat.  40% of voters voted for a communist in the central state.  25% voted for you.  How are we undermining the voters and you're not?
ModelUSGov,35m53x,awwwcat,3,Mon May 11 18:29:03 2015 UTC,The senator literally suggested a successor for himself and tried to influence the governor into appointing him. I'm willing to guess that person didn't receive a single vote.

The ModelUSGov constitution stated at the time that Septimus was elected (and still states as of an hour and a half ago when I looked at it) that Senators would have control of their seats. State governments were suddenly pushed out, and most people were either unaware of the Illinois law that is allowing this to happen or were unable to contest it before all this went down.   We won our majority in the Senate fairly and were under the impression that it was secured as per the ModelUSGov rules. Now it's getting dismantled and this administration's most influential legislation is threatened (pending your vote) because /u/canadianman22 doesn't want a GL Senator.  You have to understand the whole party is pretty upset**. If this ends up in your favor, I sincerely hope you can work with us, but we're going to fight it."

ModelUSGov,35lsgn,cameronc65,7,Mon May 11 15:35:05 2015 UTC,I think this is a good rule change.  Edit: What do you all think about doing a quorum of 75% instead of 50%?
ModelUSGov,35lsgn,Logic_85,3,Mon May 11 16:15:11 2015 UTC,"This would also make affirmative abstentions mean something--right now an abstention is essentially the same as a 'no' vote, since a quorum represents the entire body.  An abstention under this new rule would mean that person is not counted towards the total vote. Example:  10 people are voting and represent the entire body.  5 vote yes, 5 vote no - the bill does not pass.  However, get one of those ""no"" votes to abstain, suddenly the vote count becomes 5 to 4, in favor.    Previously, that abstention wouldn't help, as there would still be required 6 yeses to pass the bill.  Now, an abstention (or absent party) would reduce the number of yeses required to pass a bill.  I think it makes much more sense, as we systematically have fewer voting than should show up, and it would also give voice to those abstaining from a vote."
ModelUSGov,35lsgn,jaywhoo,3,Tue May 12 00:20:35 2015 UTC,I'm in favor of this rules change.
ModelUSGov,35lsgn,jacoby531,3,Mon May 11 15:36:28 2015 UTC,"This sounds great.  EDIT: I know this wouldn't work retroactively, so could bills that failed, but would have passed under this new system be re-voted on?"

ModelUSGov,35ffmn,Mentitor,2,Sat May 9 21:06:07 2015 UTC,Living wage!? Where?
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,Eilanyan,2,Sun May 10 13:16:41 2015 UTC,Seconded. This is a minor tweak that should have happened a decade ago.
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,jaywhoo,8,Sun May 10 14:59:09 2015 UTC,I would like to remind this congress that costs of living vary across States and that one size does absolutely not fit all.
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,cameronc65,5,Sat May 9 21:15:58 2015 UTC,That's a good point - and certainly something to take into consideration. Perhaps we could change the definition of living wage to be more regional rather than federal?
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,jaywhoo,4,Sat May 9 21:21:31 2015 UTC,"I think it should be relative to State level.  As a compromise, what about as a %of cost of living?"
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,cameronc65,3,Sat May 9 21:41:00 2015 UTC,"I think it should be relative to State level.   We could, perhaps, go even lower than that to district level. But, I could see problems arising from that, particularly with people who live on the border of districts.   As a compromise, what about as a %of cost of living?   Before I continue, I'm going to have to say you need to speak with the authors of this bill rather than me. That being said, the original intent of minimum wage was to provide a living wage. I think by setting it to a certain percent of the cost of living, rather than just allowing it to provide a living wage, would be counter intuitive to it's purposes."
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,jaywhoo,3,Sat May 9 22:23:21 2015 UTC,"Well, I think if, for instance, the mean COL somewhere is $x annually, then you set the minimum wage as a number, if worked full time, would amount to the mean COL.  Does that make sense?"
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,cameronc65,2,Sat May 9 23:01:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that makes total sense. I thought you were saying something different in your earlier post."
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,JerryLeRow,3,Sun May 10 00:50:56 2015 UTC,Great suggestion.
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,oughton42,1 point,Sat May 9 22:49:18 2015 UTC,Thank you for your input. Do you have a specific number in mind? I might be willing to compromise on a more regional rather than federal structure if it still ensures that the minimum wage is enough to live above the poverty line and that wage adjusts with inflation.
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,jaywhoo,1 point,Sun May 10 03:33:54 2015 UTC,"I personally think it should be by state as certain state laws affect the cost of living. I don't have a number, and don't currently have the time to do the math, but I can try to put something together tomorrow."
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,oughton42,1 point,Sun May 10 03:45:10 2015 UTC,I think that's an interesting point. I look forward to seeing what you come up with.
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,vidurnaktis,2,Sun May 10 04:03:38 2015 UTC,"I agree that the minimum wage within the law should either be higher (to account for places like Hawaii and New York with relatively high costs of living) or set regionally. Personally I'd prefer higher overall, say 20-25$ an hour with increases tied to inflation."
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,jaywhoo,2,Mon May 11 01:43:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no. That's not reasonable."
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,vidurnaktis,2,Mon May 11 02:43:23 2015 UTC,"So is expecting millions to not be able to survive, but pro-capitalists push that every day."
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,jaywhoo,2,Mon May 11 02:47:18 2015 UTC,And there's the partisan rhetoric.
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,vidurnaktis,2,Mon May 11 03:02:22 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to be a partisan, they pushed the Nazi's out of Yugoslavia after all. Besides, better to be a partisan than to say to millions of people, ""we won't try to improve your lives, pull yourselves up by the boot straps""."
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,jaywhoo,2,Mon May 11 15:06:42 2015 UTC,"Communism has resulted in the deaths of millions. Capitalism has resulted in the deaths of millions. We're not trying to find the perfect economic system; we're trying to find the best economic system.  Communism by no means is that system.  Furthermore, your behavior, frankly, is disgusting and I condemn your rhetoric and attempt at sabotaging a cross-pqrty bill. It's this type of childish argumentation that gets nothing done. I admonish you and your party to ground yourselves in reality and help get things done, much like /u/Oughton42 has done in working with the Dems and myself.  Also, I don't really care anymore, but whoever is downvoting people for disagreeing, you're a hilariously sad human being."
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,vidurnaktis,2,Mon May 11 15:29:09 2015 UTC,"As regards the downvotes I will tell you for certain that I personally rarely do it. I agree that whoever is doing it is not behaving within the spirit of civility, despite my own tone.   As for my rhetoric, it is mine alone. Or would you claim that /u/IBiteYou speaks for your entire party when they come out of their way to attack the GLP? I am neither endorsed or encouraged in my views by my party as we are multi-tendency with many different viewpoints.   As for communism not being that system, all we can do is press forward and try. Raising the minimum wage is not the path to communism, quite the opposite, a healthy minimum wage (such as in the 20-25$ range) is more likely to save capitalism then destroy it.   Why do I advocate for it then? Because the well-being of the workers is more important within the here and now, there are too many people going hungry, too many people stressed because they have too little. We should raise wages across the board, not just for those with the least, because in the here and now we should be willing to save as many as we can."
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,jaywhoo,2,Mon May 11 16:18:13 2015 UTC,"Great. Now that we're past behaving like children:  This massive of an increase in the minimum wage would skyrocket inflation, reduce buying power, and weaken the market. Wages would then stagnate and we would see very similar, if not worse, results to the joke that was the Carter administration.  At $25/hour, if worked full time, would result in an annual salary of $52,000 per year. That's an absolute joke. You're telling me a fry cook should make the same amount as law school graduate?  I'm truly not trying to insult you on a personal level, but that's the worst grasp of basic economic policy that I've seen on here, like, ever."
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,vidurnaktis,2,Mon May 11 16:28:25 2015 UTC,"This could be offset by a mandatory reduction in full-time hours. I would suggest 20 hours a week, which not only offset the increase in minimum wage but allow more hires.   As for:    You're telling me a fry cook should make the same amount as law school graduate?   This argument gets passed around a lot and isn't what anyone in favour of minimum wage increase seriously believes. We do believe that the law school graduate should also get paid more, obviously. It is a beautiful piece of propaganda that seriously pits sections of the working class against each other that folks who are for minimum wage increase want burger flippers to be paid the same as doctors.   As for its effects on inflation there are several studies done that say that there would be minimal effect and that it would be a small thing in price increases to offset the hike in minimum wage, even for a large jump like to 20-25$. If the power of capitalists is weakened as a result, even better. But do you seriously think we'll overturn the capitalist system with a 15$ increase to minimum wage?"

ModelUSGov,35ffmn,Xarasystral,3,Sat May 9 22:48:53 2015 UTC,"After discussion with the other author of this bill, as well as listening to ideas on this post: We have discussed with someone within the republican party with a new idea while retaining the original purpose of this bill. Here is my proposed amendment to this bill, of which I have also added to the amendment post:  This bill was originally authored by /u/oughton42 and I, and the idea for Section 3 came from /u/jaywhoo.  BILL 039: The Living Wage Act of 2015  PREAMBLE: Almost 50 million Americans live below the poverty line. Even those who work full-time jobs are being forced under the poverty line due to low wages. It is the duty of the American government to ensure that every citizen who works hard receives the living wage that they deserve to support themselves and their family.  SECTION 1: Definitions  SUBSECTION 1-1: Full-time employment is defined as 36 or more hours per week.  SUBSECTION 1-2: A tipped employee is one that engages in an occupation in which they customarily and regularly receives more than $30 per month in tips.  SECTION 2: Minimum Wage  SUBSECTION 2-1: The minimum wage for all workers, tipped or un-tipped, as of 2015, shall be set at $9.20 per hour.  SECTION 3: State Cost of Living Index Adjustment  SUBSECTION 3-1: In order to ensure that citizens of each state have the equal opportunity to make money, a state cost of living index, or SCOLI, shall be implemented.  SUBSECTION 3-2: Establishing a SCOLI  SUBSECTION 3-2(a): The standard index, or 100%, shall be calculated by taking the current federal minimum wage as defined in this bill and multiplying by 1,872 (the number of hours worked for a full-time worker in a year (as further defined in this bill as 36 hours per week, times 52 weeks in a year)). This results in a 100% federal index of $17,222.40 under current conditions.  SUBSECTION 3-2(b): The standard index shall be compared to the state’s Cost of Living Index (COLI) as determined by the IRS. For example, if the state’s COLI is 110%, their minimum wage in that state should be equal to $18,944.64 for their full-time work. (This is calculated by taking the 100% amount of $17,222.40 and increasing it by 10%).  SUBSECTION 3-2(c): In states where the COLI is less than 100%, the same method shall be used. Although this may result in a lower minimum wage than defined federally, its purchasing power will be the same in that state.  SECTION 4: In addition to the guidelines set forth here, each state may, at any time, raise their state’s minimum wage to any level they see suitable.  SECTION 5: This bill will be enacted 90 days after passage."
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,oughton42,2,Tue May 12 01:36:02 2015 UTC,"I think everyone can agree with this version of the bill. Thanks to everyone who helped put this together, especially Xarasystral and Jaywhoo!"
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,dreasdif118,2,Tue May 12 04:06:33 2015 UTC,"I will be honest, when I saw the name of this bill on the waiting list I thought it would try to raise the wage to something like $15-$20. But, I have to say this is a good compromise bill. I congratulate my counterparts across the aisle on this bill. My only problem with it is Section 3. If this is removed, I will vote yea."
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,oughton42,1 point,Sun May 10 02:32:49 2015 UTC,"$9.20 is the minimum wage already established in the ModelUS. May I ask what your concern with Section 3 is? It simply ensures that working full-time at minimum wage is enough to live above the poverty line regardless of the economic conditions. The current static minimum wage has not kept up with the rate of inflation and the rate of productivity of workers, meaning that a minimum wage salary can afford less and less every year."
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,dreasdif118,2,Sun May 10 03:22:54 2015 UTC,With the inflation index it will increase every 2 years and I think it should freeze at the current minimum wage level stayed by this bill.
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,oughton42,1 point,Sun May 10 03:52:17 2015 UTC,"But the increase is important to ensure that the minimum wage remains (and really, becomes) a viable, livable income. It's value has been decreasing significantly; the adjustment allows the minimum wage to stay at the same level relative to the nation's economy, so that its purchasing power stays the same. It doesn't necessarily always increase; if the economy is good, the minimum wage goes down accordingly. Why would you have it remain static?"
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,dreasdif118,2,Sun May 10 04:07:00 2015 UTC,"Because good economics dictates that we should have small positive inflation therefore during times of economic growth it will increase and I do not think it will help with creating jobs, actually it will lose jobs."
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,oughton42,2,Sun May 10 04:21:33 2015 UTC,"Studies have shown that raising minimum does not lead to job loss. Furthermore, the point of this bill is not necessarily to create jobs, but to ensure that citizens that work hard are paid their due."

ModelUSGov,35ffmn,Gohte,5,Mon May 11 05:12:03 2015 UTC,I hope you realise citing opinion pieces against researched studies does nothing to prove your point.
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,oughton42,3,Mon May 11 12:16:30 2015 UTC,"First of all, the presence of a fallacy doesn't immediately negate my argument. It's poor rhetoric to simply yell out the name of a fallacy and then offer no other argument; calling out a fallacy (if there is one) is not an argument in itself. This is Debate 101. And if you're going to cite articles about the data rather than the data itself, try to get articles as unbiased as possible; in other words, not from beingclassicallyliberal.liberty.me, a website which just by the name shows their incredible bias.  Second, you'll be happy to know that this bill doesn't increase the minimum wage's buying power, just its objective number when the economy changes. $9.20 is already the minimum wage in the ModelWorld, this bill does not raise that, it just ensures that it's purchasing power stays the same regardless of the economic status of the country. Yes, when times are bad the number will go up, but not the intrinsic value. This is to ensure that people have the basic ability to eat and own some kind of home or apartment.   Edit: I got rid of some things. The tone was more pointed and aggressive than I intended."
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,kingofquave,2,Mon May 11 14:25:11 2015 UTC,"I like this, but based on some concerns, I believe that it is best to make this the base level and then let the states decide whether they will stay with that price or make it higher."
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,oughton42,2,Sun May 10 02:46:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your feedback! Section 4 establishes the Federal Minimum Wage as the baseline and allows states to raise it, just like you said."
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,oughton42,2,Sun May 10 03:18:13 2015 UTC,"As a veteran, with a fiancée and a family, I am concerned in some ways with how this may specifically not address current soldiers'/service members' pay. I know many veterans on pension, or active service members who send their wages home, and they are not always compensated fairly.   If this is truly a ""living wage,"" though I certainly understand it applies to the minimum wage more specifically, is there a way we can perhaps propose legislation, or in some fashion implement change, that might arrange for this? (I am not sure if this is in Secretary of Defense's /u/A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS jurisdiction, or if it's a legislative issue.)"

I'm not a veteran, though I work with several, and I'm interested in hearing from anybody who may be informed on the topic. I have a new budget hearing coming up, and if I were able to reallocate funds in order to better provide for active soldiers, I would be very happy."

ModelUSGov,35ffmn,JerryLeRow,2,Sun May 10 15:32:06 2015 UTC,"Isn't our current minimum wage $10.10 an hour?   In addition, you should probably define tipping.  EDIT: tipping"
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,Xarasystral,2,Sun May 10 04:44:36 2015 UTC,"B008 established minimum wage at $9.20, as far as I can tell. I think it might be good to better define tipping as well. Do you have any suggestions?"

ModelUSGov,35ffmn,oughton42,2,Sun May 10 04:47:33 2015 UTC,Love it.
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,jaywhoo,2,Sun May 10 15:33:21 2015 UTC,"Okay so I ran some numbers and I think it would be effective to essentially set the standard hourly wage at 0.05% of $19,136 (the annual salary of someone working fill time at $9.20) , to be adjusted based on state cost of living index.   So, for instance, if I'm moving from Arizona (cost of living index 100.2) to Maine (cost of living index 110.1), my expected annual salary working minimum wage should go up 10% , to $21,050. This would bring Maine's minimum wage to $10.12 per hour.   If I moved from Arizona to Idaho (90.2), my expected annual salary would be $17,222, or $8.28 per hour.  I believe this fairly compensates workers across the nation according to their respective states' economies without interfering too much with the market and would like to see this put in place!"
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,ben1204,1 point,Mon May 11 17:05:04 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of effectively customizing the minimum wage to each state, so that it is enough to live reasonably comfortably (i.e. afford the necessities of life, and then a bit more), without (potentially) significantly affecting markets. However, this would still need to be related to inflation. Perhaps we could tie it in with the Cost-of-Living Adjustment process used by Social Security.   The minimum wage shall be established as $9.20 at a Cost-of-Living index of 100. The percent change in the cost-of-living index from 100 shall be used to determine the percent change in minimum wage within the state. This percent change in the Cost of Living index shall be determined by the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).   Obviously this needs to be prettied up and reformatted, but I think this is a good compromise. Also, I will add in a concrete definition of ""tipped"" versus ""non-tipped,"" just for clarity's sake.  I would also like to find out what /u/Xarasystral, /u/IBiteYou, /u/Those_Crazy_Reds, and /u/Sheppio734 (and obviously anyone else) all think of this plan."
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,Logic_85,2,Mon May 11 17:54:33 2015 UTC,"I personally believe States themselves should determine minimum wage, but I think this is a very fair compromise for all sides.  EDIT: I also think as a society we should move away from tipping. It's a pretty terrible policy really."
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,oughton42,2,Mon May 11 18:15:02 2015 UTC,This does not go far enough in my opinion. I think that the living wage should be at least $10.
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,IBiteYou,2,Mon May 11 20:54:19 2015 UTC,"It is the duty of the American government to ensure that every citizen who works hard receives the living wage that they deserve to support themselves and their family.  SUBSECTION 1-2: Support is defined as living 10% above the federally-defined poverty line for the number of people living in a household.   I'm unsure of the point of these sections.  Are you trying to say that the government should also ensure they receive a basic wage from the government to cover any difference in their wages and 10% above FPL, in addition to raising the minimum wage? Or simply that this is a belief under this bill?"
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,oughton42,1 point,Mon May 11 21:59:03 2015 UTC,"It's a mix of both. I'm not trying to say that the government should pay citizens directly at all, but that by establishing the wage system as defined in the bill, the government can ensure that citizens have a reasonable income from their employers."
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,IBiteYou,1 point,Mon May 11 22:31:54 2015 UTC,"I think this needs more definitions.  What is the poverty line for a family of three?  Does this mean that if you work at McDonald's for 36 hours a week, you will earn 10% above 20,090$ a year?  And more in Alaska and Hawaii?"
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,oughton42,2,Sun May 10 03:49:12 2015 UTC,"I think this needs more definitions.   What would you recommend?   Does this mean that if you work at McDonald's for 36 hours a week, you will earn 10% above 20,090$ a year?   Yes, it does. Is this a problem?"
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,IBiteYou,1 point,Sun May 10 04:45:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the clarifications.  So 11.80 an hour for working 36 hours a week at McD's.... IF you have a family of 3.  If you don't have a family, you make less.  Do you think this might have a chilling effect on people with kids being hired for jobs?"
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,oughton42,1 point,Sun May 10 05:06:01 2015 UTC,"I apologize, I think I misunderstood what you were saying. It was my fault. Let me clarify:  I think the confusion comes from the definition of ""support"" in Section 1.2. People are not paid based off the number of people in their family/household. The definition is sort of a remnant of an older version of the bill, where I addressed later in the bill that the adjusted minimum wage should be enough for one minimum-wage worker to support himself, or two minimum-wage workers to support a family of four. It was meant to be a guideline, not a strict prescription, of where the minimum wage should be set.  I hope this clears up the miscommunication on my part. I think it may be better to eliminate the ""support"" definition, as it doesn't do much in this version of the bill. Would that ease your concerns?"
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,Xarasystral,2,Sun May 10 05:17:42 2015 UTC,"I also wonder how you determined that full-time employment is 36 hours a week, when it is traditionally defined as 40 hours."
ModelUSGov,35ffmn,schultejt,2,Sun May 10 05:25:14 2015 UTC,"That was a change made by /u/Xarasystral, and I cannot answer for him or his reasoning. As far as I see it, the difference between 36 and 40 hours is a little one in regards to the larger scope and purpose of the bill, and certainly one I'd be willing to compromise on."

ModelUSGov,3567gq,JerryLeRow,1 point,Thu May 7 21:08:10 2015 UTC,"Right next to the sub name there's a circle button. Yes, it should be in the sidebar, can we get one of the mods?... Didn't you get a message when I mentioned your username?  And the poll: Where can I find it? Also a quote from the bill sponsor... I had statistics too, and did my own research project; under the correct assumptions you can manipulate whatever you want, did so too."

ModelUSGov,3567gq,Sheppio734,2,Thu May 7 21:35:56 2015 UTC,It's the truth. Native American reservations have 5x the alchohol-related deaths of normal society. They have higher amounts of preventable diseases.
ModelUSGov,3567gq,JerryLeRow,3,Thu May 7 22:12:19 2015 UTC,That is true (although we will probably disagree on the reasons why); I was talking about this:   reverting further parts of our developed society to dark age pseudoscience

ModelUSGov,353tyl,cameronc65,4,Thu May 7 01:22:08 2015 UTC,"It is truly an honor to serve my country in its highest court. I'd like to thank the former president and the honorable senators for putting their faith in my ability.  This is a turning point for the Supreme Court. While once a largely inactive part of this simulation, I am confident that recent changes will lead to our increased involvement. My hope is that the court will not just be involved but will serve as force to keep the government in check and protect the common American from tyranny.   I look forward to working with the other justices, the newly appointed attorney general, and this government as a whole.   Here's to a new era of civil liberties and justice in this country. God bless all of you, and God bless the United States of America."
ModelUSGov,353tyl,Prodigiousguy8,4,Thu May 7 03:18:47 2015 UTC,"Mr Justice, I congratulate you on your confirmation, but I have to admit that I have reservations about you being in the position.  I hope that you remember that your job is to interpret the constitution not only for its words but for its original intent, and hope that you will not engage in any judicial activism or let your political views influence your interpretation."
ModelUSGov,353tyl,TheRealRailguy,2,Thu May 7 05:27:07 2015 UTC,Would you have said that if it was a republican that was appointed? Or a fellow libertarian?
ModelUSGov,353tyl,risen2011,3,Thu May 7 11:25:15 2015 UTC,"I say this because of his responses to questions directed at him during his hearings, not because of his party."
ModelUSGov,353tyl,TheRealRailguy,2,Thu May 7 14:29:54 2015 UTC,"I understand your concerns; they are very valid. However, as I noted in my confirmation hearing, I am very opposed to politicization of the court. I'll admit, my opinion on campaign was legally incongruent, but I have since changed my view on the issue, something I'm very open to doing."

I want you to know that my nay vote was not reflexive, it was based on your answers to the specific questions that I asked ... particularly your response that you would seek to limit corporate donations to politics while leaving union donations unchecked.  At any rate, I wish you a productive session."
ModelUSGov,353tyl,IBiteYou,3,Thu May 7 05:05:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your kind words, senator.   I've actually been considering your argument, and I now believe you're correct. It is legally inconsistent. Unions and interest groups should be regulated the same as corporations. My only reason for thinking otherwise was that they're typically democratic organizations, but for the sake of consistency, it's best to leave campaign funding in the hands of each individual."
ModelUSGov,353tyl,Prodigiousguy8,1 point,Thu May 7 14:08:13 2015 UTC,I'm encouraged by your willingness to reconsider your views.
ModelUSGov,353tyl,IBiteYou,3,Thu May 7 14:16:32 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you that the right to one's own property Mrs. Senator,  is fundamental to that of America, the job of a supreme court justice is to uphold the constitution and the constitution only.  Whether you agree or disagree with the newly appointed justice's opinions, the right to one's own property is no technically listed in the constitution, and thus a nay vote for a differing opinion seems more like partisan politics than a defense of the constitution.  Just one man's opinion.  Edit: One's not own's"
ModelUSGov,353tyl,TheRealRailguy,3,Thu May 7 05:23:56 2015 UTC,"Of course their job is to uphold the Constitution.  No one is arguing this.  On Constitutional grounds, the Supreme Court ruled in the Citizens United case.  The candidate said that he would not have ruled with the majority and would have limited political speech by corporations.  He then said that he would NOT limit political speech by unions.  There seemed an inconsistency there.     If you wish to see the full discussion that occurred, so that you may assure yourself that my misgivings were not purely political... you are welcome to look here."
ModelUSGov,353tyl,IBiteYou,2,Thu May 7 05:47:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with the premise of citizens united, I am just questioning the broader interpretation of it based on its constitutional backing.  I do not believe that money is an expression of free speech, I believe it is an expression of property, a whole different right which, unfortunately, is not guaranteed by the constitution.  If anything, I would be skeptical of the justice because of his reasoning (that corporations dont have everyones best interests at heart) as opposed to his opposition to the issue."
ModelUSGov,353tyl,TheRealRailguy,3,Thu May 7 06:13:52 2015 UTC,"His politics clearly played a part in his decision about Citizens United, which is what I said at the time.  It is, to me, inconsistent to say that you would limit political donations from corporations... but you would allow political donations by unions."

ModelUSGov,350ba0,Smitty9913,2,Wed May 6 14:04:02 2015 UTC,Look at /u/SomeOfTheTimes. Plurizor banned him from the press sub after he said he has alts in other party's. He has a small post history and is possibly the democratic alt. why can't you check the ip?
ModelUSGov,350ba0,notevenalongname,1 point,Wed May 6 14:07:33 2015 UTC,"IP checking is for admins only. Mods can't do that (and to be honest, looking at the mods of some other subreddits (see e.g. the /r/xkcd drama), this is probably a good thing)."
ModelUSGov,350ba0,HipsterDios,3,Wed May 6 14:12:33 2015 UTC,Okay I might message the admins agian then. They will just ban all of the people with alts around here. I had them do it a week ago in another sub reddit. I'll talk to the head mod of model world.

ModelUSGov,350ba0,IBiteYou,3,Wed May 6 06:16:17 2015 UTC,We are working to enforce anti-spying and cheating rules. Not spies will have no problems leaking under these new rules.
ModelUSGov,350ba0,TheRealRailguy,5,Wed May 6 10:39:25 2015 UTC,Except then every admin will known they leaked.  I think leakers have the right to try and leak without getting caught
ModelUSGov,350ba0,kilgore_trout87,3,Wed May 6 18:53:48 2015 UTC,"As a libertarian, would you apply the same logic to the NSA's foreign and domestic spy operations? That it's fine as long as they don't get caught?  I think alt account spies ought to be universally condemned, and if caught, all accounts matching that IP should be banned. We're not talking about censoring the press here; we're talking about cracking down on Watergate."
ModelUSGov,350ba0,IBiteYou,3,Wed May 6 20:54:15 2015 UTC,"I think that the question being posed is this:  If I am a Republican, and I see someone making a bill that would impose something fascist...should I be able to leak to the press?  If I must go through the mods, then there's every likelihood that there will be repercussions for me, since my identity is in the open, so to say."

Then you're wrong.  Please re-read the proposed rules.   If I must go through the mods, then there's every likelihood that there will be repercussions for me, since my identity is in the open, so to say.   Why?  I trust the mod team to be fair and impartial more than I trust users using alt accounts not to cheat and utilize spy accounts given some of the happenings within the /r/modelusgov subreddits.  Maybe there's another way to ensure alt accounts are not used for leaks, if you've got an idea, I'd be happy to hear it.  But don't try to turn this into some issue of government censorship when it isn't."
ModelUSGov,350ba0,kilgore_trout87,3,Wed May 6 23:01:20 2015 UTC,"I trust the mod team to be fair and impartial   That may be how you feel.  But the mods belong to political parties.  It's entirely possible that there would be blowback on someone who is a member of a party, but has something they feel they want to confidentially contact the press about.  To be clear...I oppose people joining parties for the sole purpose of leaking things.  That's not what I am talking about.  Say we have a Republican president and said President talks about an Executive Action upcoming that I feel would skirt the Constitution and circumvent the Congress and is not something I feel should be done by Executive Action.  As in real life, I would much rather contact a member of the press who is sworn to keep my identity confidential, than to have to run my concerns and intention to go to the media past a group of people."
ModelUSGov,350ba0,IBiteYou,3,Wed May 6 23:21:42 2015 UTC,"Only half of the mods are in political parties, and they are the least active."
ModelUSGov,350ba0,kilgore_trout87,2,Thu May 7 01:07:21 2015 UTC,Asking the media to ok all stories with the mods just does not sit right with me.  Maybe ask the media not to accept a story from accounts that are way new and obvious alts.
ModelUSGov,350ba0,TheRealRailguy,4,Thu May 7 01:14:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this isn't clear enough, but they don't have to get the ok before they post it. They only have to communicate to the mod team what is going on after the post goes up. However, once they post it, they are responsible for making sure that the leak didn't come from a suspicious source, such accounts which are ten minutes old."
ModelUSGov,350ba0,kilgore_trout87,2,Thu May 7 01:24:52 2015 UTC,"Obvious spies, yes.  Newly created accounts, no.  On my opinion, protecting a whistleblowers identity from the press is much more important than from the mods, as long as we can hold mods to their confidentiality and know they will be punished if they break it."
ModelUSGov,350ba0,TheRealRailguy,2,Thu May 7 01:50:22 2015 UTC,"As in real life, I would much rather contact a member of the press who is sworn to keep my identity confidential, than to have to run my concerns and intention to go to the media past a group of people.   Fine, then devise a way where we can prevent spies from leaking while only relying on the press.  The alt account thing is a problem that needs to get solved.  So how about you work on a solution instead of merely complaining about the solution that's been proposed; otherwise you're going to wind up with the solution you don't like in place."
ModelUSGov,350ba0,Smitty9913,3,Wed May 6 23:37:31 2015 UTC,"It seems like the alt account thing is something that has been solved.  Perhaps members of the media should agree to accept news items only from people who are verified members of a particular party and whom are somewhat active.  If someone creates an ""alt"" that is 6 hours old, it should be easy to determine if the source is credible or not."

ModelUSGov,34xhch,Danotto94,10,Tue May 5 14:25:18 2015 UTC,Do you have proof that heavily taxing the rich helps the economy?
ModelUSGov,34xhch,jaywhoo,5,Tue May 5 19:30:24 2015 UTC,http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/6024430  We should go down with low-income taxation and add new levels of taxation above the 400'000$ up to 90%.
ModelUSGov,34xhch,bluefisch200,3,Wed May 6 05:51:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, let's drive even more of our money overseas.  EDIT: Upon closer reading, this paper is just dumb. It basically assumes that the rich have no potential in job creation whatsoever and that the money they make just goes in their pockets forever."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,jaywhoo,6,Wed May 6 07:01:21 2015 UTC,"It does not just assume that. The money goes into their pockets forever, there is a reason why the 1% exists.  But let us go down that line of thinking. Let as assume that lowering taxes for the rich makes sense. Most likely there won't be more rich that come here. But the redistribution of wealth will be lower. Therefore the 99% will sink even lower and the 1% will gain even more.   In this scenario the poor will not be able to afford as much as they do today, so the companies of the rich loose money.  Now there are is one final solution to fulfill the dept driven society we live in. Lowering the wage of the workers or replacing them by software or robotics.  Now this will work for a while until you realize that the workers now have even less then before. The next crisis begins. (You can do that with every day products or loans, it doesn't matter).  Lowering taxes for the poor however makes much more sense. Growing the wealth of the 99% contributes much more to the growth of the market.  In addition: If your fear is that we drive our money overseas you just accepted that the overall system is broken and that the rich do only care for where the lowest taxes are instead of other aspects of a country. If a country can not provide other benefits except for low taxes there is something wrong. When we reach the point that the 1% only look for the place with the lowest taxes then we, as a species, have utterly failed.  That is why we work against countries like Monaco and Switzerland on the legal way. What they do is just unjust."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,bluefisch200,2,Wed May 6 10:09:47 2015 UTC,"We need to create a climate in which business can do business. Without business, we have no economic activity and lose our competitive edge. Your argument is fallacious as well."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,jaywhoo,3,Wed May 6 17:33:18 2015 UTC,A small business can do business without any problems. The ones who feel threatened by higher taxes are the ones who only focus on making more and more profit.  A business takes the surplus of their workers and puts it in the hands of their owners. That is unfair and taxes and a social welfare system can redistribute that wealth to a certain amount.  Debt driven economy will always fail in the long term. Higher taxes and social systems are only the medicine for those failures.
ModelUSGov,34xhch,bluefisch200,1 point,Wed May 6 18:04:10 2015 UTC,"Then we appear to have different opinions on the most fundamental concepts of economics, and there's not much of a way to reconcile them, especially as there are Nobel Award winning economists on either side of the argument."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,jaywhoo,2,Wed May 6 23:19:17 2015 UTC,"Well Obama raised taxes on the rich. So far 13,000,000 jobs were created. Clinton did the same. 18,000,000 jobs were created. Bush lowered taxes on the rich, 3,500,000 jobs were created, 2 million homes a year were foreclosed on, and 450,000 jobs a month were being lost at the end of his term."

He was in his 50s, living on a fixed income from a few other investments, and he had planned it out so that he lived off about $200,000 per year, keeping him in a lower tax bracket.   When he found out his retirement management company was going to cash him out about $400,000, he took action -- this would have bumped him from the 28% bracket to the 39.6% bracket.  He spent about $5,000 keeping the money from being distributed and ended up delaying the distribution until the next year, when he could take only that distribution and have taxable income of $400,000 for that year, instead of $600,000 for the year before.    He saved about $60,000 doing this.    People are already willing to bend over backwards to keep their income out of the 39.6% bracket.  I can't imagine the madness we will see if we enact a 90% bracket."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,Logic_85,2,Wed May 6 15:44:24 2015 UTC,That is why we should have a system without brackets but rather a linear-progressiv tax. That is fairer for those at the lower end of the bracket.

ModelUSGov,34xhch,Danotto94,2,Thu May 7 13:34:12 2015 UTC,So from your deflection can I take it that you're saying you don't have proof?

This bill also raises the question of if every tax bracket gets a tax cut, where are we going to get this money from? Money doesn't grow on trees. How do we plan to regain this lost revenue? And why are the rich getting a tax cut?  I urge all representatives to vote nay to the current version."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,oughton42,8,Tue May 5 13:20:30 2015 UTC,"Hear, hear! This looks to me like a tax cut for the rich, poorly disguised as a tax cut for everyone. And like you said, there's no mention of where this tax cut will be accounted for elsewhere.  Were it to be amended such that the highest tax bracket is re-included at an appropriate level, and the cuts favored the poor rather than the rich, then I would consider voting Yea."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,Logic_85,5,Tue May 5 14:11:20 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see an analysis on the impact this cut will have on revenue, and the plan to make it up with either cuts or revenue from other areas."

ModelUSGov,34xhch,jaywhoo,4,Tue May 5 20:10:24 2015 UTC,"Cut entitlements, reform healthcare, create a pathway to citizenship to tax income of current illegal aliens, minor decreases in the military budget, cut subsidies, etc."

ModelUSGov,34xhch,Eilanyan,6,Tue May 5 20:17:37 2015 UTC,Estate tax EXEMPTION doesn't need to be raised.   EDIT: meant exemption
ModelUSGov,34xhch,Logic_85,3,Tue May 5 13:18:07 2015 UTC,The federal exemption is $5.2 million or so.  Individual states the exemption is between $1-2 million.    They are indexed for inflation every year so that next year it will be 5.25 million or something.  I agree that this increase from 5 to 10 million is drastic.
ModelUSGov,34xhch,AllTheyEatIsLettuce,3,Tue May 5 15:53:06 2015 UTC,Less than half of US states collect an estate or inheritance tax at all. Source.
ModelUSGov,34xhch,Eilanyan,1 point,Wed May 6 00:39:34 2015 UTC,I would like to see estate tax raised above 50% for estates worth more that 5 million.
ModelUSGov,34xhch,kilgore_trout87,2,Tue May 5 14:03:10 2015 UTC,Cause it already affects an inordinately small amount of estates. IMO is too generous.
ModelUSGov,34xhch,Eilanyan,1 point,Tue May 5 15:24:02 2015 UTC,"I can agree with your reasoning that it doesn't go far enough, but I'm baffled by your conclusion that it shouldn't be raised at all.

ModelUSGov,34xhch,kilgore_trout87,4,Tue May 5 15:25:48 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I meant the threshold/exemption shouldn't be raised from 5 to 10 mil."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,white_anarchist_teen,2,Tue May 5 15:30:32 2015 UTC,"Okay, that makes much more sense. Then we're on the same page that the exemption threshold is way too high. I was very confused before you clarified what you meant."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,Logic_85,5,Tue May 5 15:32:50 2015 UTC,"I don't see why the Republicans are proposing to tax those in poverty at 8-13%, while lowering taxes on the rich with the estate tax exclusion and the income tax cap at 35%."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,kilgore_trout87,2,Tue May 5 15:34:32 2015 UTC,"This bill actually lowers the tax rates on those in poverty, in addition to lowering the rate on be upper-brackets."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,Xarasystral,2,Tue May 5 21:10:27 2015 UTC,"But it lowers taxes on the rich far more. Furthermore, several republicans ITT have said they plan to make up for lost revenue by cutting programs that benefit the poor, which likely means that in the long run, the poor won't see any tax cuts at all."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,kingofquave,5,Wed May 6 13:12:25 2015 UTC,"As this is directly about taxes, I, as chair of the Ways & Means committee, have decided to come up with some hard numbers about what this bill would change.  Firstly, thank /u/kingofquave for their hard work on coming up with the hard numbers. Here are our findings about how much tax revenue this would reduce for the country:  ""The bottom tax bracket is kept the same income wise, but instead of 10%, they would pay 8%. The next highest tax bracket is kept the same income wise, but instead of 15%, they would pay 13%. The next highest tax bracket is kept the same income wise, but instead of 25%, they would pay 22%. The next highest tax bracket is kept the same income wise, but instead of 28%, they would pay 25%. The next highest tax bracket is kept the same income wise, but instead of 33%, they would pay 30%. The highest two tax brackets currently are merged into one tax bracket, wherein the people from the lesser of the two older income brackets would pay the same 35%, but the richest people would, instead of 39.5%, pay 35%. This bill puts tax cuts on everybody except for single-filers in the $411,501 - $430,200 range, joint-filers in the $411,501 - $464-850 range, and separate-filing married couples in the $205,751 - $232,425 range, who all will be paying the same. I will get an exact number, as I don't have one now, but there is no way that the government will make money on this bill. The government will be losing in tax revenue if this bill is passed. EDIT: According to the summary of Tax info, those who make over $34,000 a year (essentially the top 4 proposed tax brackets) pay 97% of income taxes, and their average tax rate is being cut by around 3%. They pay 1 trillion dollars in taxes, and taking 3% away is like taking 30 billion dollars. If you add in the bottom 50%, this bill can allow the U.S. government to expect to bring in over 35 billion dollars less in income taxes once it would be put into effect.""  Do you believe we can honestly take away $35 billion of our revenue by taxing our rich less? I urge everyone, regardless of your party affiliation, to vote nay to this legislation. Without some type of heavy compromise, this bill will only serve to assault our country's best interests."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,oughton42,4,Wed May 6 14:35:02 2015 UTC,"I am voting ""nay"". Our government cannot afford this without cutting major costs somewhere like the Department of Defense, and I don't think the Republicans can support that."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,DEYoungRepublicans,4,Wed May 6 02:43:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the numbers, they really solidify just how poor this bill is. Unless this bill gets amended heavily, I will be voting nay. I would even argue that this requires so much change it might as well be scrapped."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,Eilanyan,4,Wed May 6 02:47:59 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I think the tax reform doesn't go far enough. We have people living in poverty and having trouble feeding themselves - taxes only ads additional burden.  The lower/middle class range, according to this chart, is at 13%, followed by a large spike from 22-25% I would propose dropping these three numbers further. That will at least help the dying lower and middle class bracket workers."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,JerryLeRow,6,Wed May 6 02:57:35 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, but we can't fund that if at sametime if we are cutting taxes for the upper-middle class and upper class."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,Eilanyan,2,Tue May 5 14:50:08 2015 UTC,Cut back entitlements?
ModelUSGov,34xhch,JerryLeRow,3,Tue May 5 15:37:38 2015 UTC,Cutting taxes first with such large debt seems unreasonable.
ModelUSGov,34xhch,Eilanyan,2,Tue May 5 15:55:19 2015 UTC,We can reduce reduce debt by spending less...
ModelUSGov,34xhch,JerryLeRow,3,Tue May 5 16:04:11 2015 UTC,Then propose the cost saving measure first and propose tax cuts when our economic house is in order.
ModelUSGov,34xhch,white_anarchist_teen,2,Tue May 5 16:42:59 2015 UTC,"Ok, as I said reform entitlements. But we should ask our Treasurer,  /u/Danotto94 , to think of something. Perhaps he can work something out with our SoHaHs, /u/white_anarchist_teen ."

ModelUSGov,34xhch,Eilanyan,1 point,Tue May 5 21:24:58 2015 UTC,"Cutting taxes will allow job creators to keep more of their money, which will boost the economy. The state will gain more revenue from that and so we'll end up with a healthier economy and lower debt."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,marx-marx,3,Tue May 5 21:37:29 2015 UTC,When has that worked in the past? The Bush tax cuts were massively expensive.
ModelUSGov,34xhch,Eilanyan,1 point,Wed May 6 17:57:00 2015 UTC,"The Bush tax cuts were a fantastic boost for the economy and the treasury. This editorial from the Washington Times sums it up well:    But the real jolt for tax-cutting opponents was that the 03 Bush tax cuts also generated a massive increase in federal tax receipts. From 2004 to 2007, federal tax revenues increased by $785 billion, the largest four-year increase in American history. According to the Treasury Department, individual and corporate income tax receipts were up 40 percent in the three years following the Bush tax cuts. And (bonus) the rich paid an even higher percentage of the total tax burden than they had at any time in at least the previous 40 years."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,kilgore_trout87,3,Wed May 6 17:59:36 2015 UTC,"The article somehow thinks that income tax cuts are Keynesian spending in 2001, but continuation of the same tax cuts in 2003 are brilliant economics. I agree they note the capital gains tax reduction, but contradict when they say individuals did not spend their tax cuts in 2001 but somehow did in 2003. If anything it's an argument for low business taxes and high individual taxes.   The sidenote of course is the glossing over that the wars are extremely expensive, and hilarious notion that 786 billion dollars would have covered that if rest of spending held the line.   EDIT: Should also not he's comparing recession to not-recession government revenues."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,JerryLeRow,3,Wed May 6 19:26:24 2015 UTC,"So, screw the poor even more? Gotta make sure we make up for that huge 2% cut we gave them somewhere, right?"
ModelUSGov,34xhch,kilgore_trout87,2,Wed May 6 19:36:32 2015 UTC,"Cutting entitlements doesn't mean screwing the poor, the nexus isn't given. We should - again - reform the system, currently people are either receiving entitlements who wouldn't need them or people who - with better politics - wouldn't even have to apply for entitlements. Again, if we Democrats could draft a bill that reforms that, we'd gain massive prestige."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,JerryLeRow,3,Wed May 6 14:39:55 2015 UTC,"Again, if we Democrats could draft a bill that reforms that, we'd gain massive prestige.   What does that even mean? Are you sure you're a Democrat? Because your comments ITT sound more in line with Republican ideology."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,kilgore_trout87,2,Wed May 6 16:47:26 2015 UTC,"It means that if we can draft and pass a bill that reforms entitlements, we could draw some attention to us and give people a reason to vote for us, so that one day we have a stronger presence in D.C. than now.  I am a Democrat... yes, I cross party lines more often than the average Dem, but in this case the economist in me speaks. The nation has a frightening burden of unfunded liabilities, though I have to admit the website posted far higher $ some time ago, so there may have been a recalculation, though other sites post similar numbers. The current system in place is simply not sustainable."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,JerryLeRow,3,Wed May 6 16:49:58 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree on all counts. Third Way/New Dems have been the real life Democratic party's biggest problem in recent years (they arguably paved the way to the Tea Party wave of 2010). Well, maybe not all counts, I will agree that we ought to reform the tax code so that wealthy corporations and individuals pay their fair share, because endlessly cutting taxes for them at the expense of the middle class is unsustainable. The answer to this problem isn't gutting the social safety net; it's a more progressive tax code.  May I ask why you think you have more in common with model Democrats (since we are, as a party, far more liberal than the real life Democratic Party) than the model Republicans?"
ModelUSGov,34xhch,kilgore_trout87,2,Wed May 6 17:04:57 2015 UTC,"1) Read my pm.  2) I'm in my last comment not talking about the tax code - the revenue side - but about entitlements - the expenditure side.   May I ask why you think you have more in common with model Democrats (since we are, as a party, far more liberal than the real life Democratic Party) than the model Republicans?   This a debate we can have in a private room. I am a sane person and chose the Democratic Party, that's enough for the public sub."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,kilgore_trout87,2,Wed May 6 17:40:53 2015 UTC,"I'm in my last comment not talking about the tax code - the revenue side - but about entitlements - the expenditure side.   I'm well aware. But you should be talking about the revenue side if you want to talk ""unsustainability.""  Also, if you've got something to say to me, you should have the guts to say it in the public forum."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,kilgore_trout87,2,Wed May 6 17:47:20 2015 UTC,"Furthermore:   It means that if we can draft and pass a bill that reforms entitlements, we could draw some attention to us and give people a reason to vote for us, so that one day we have a stronger presence in D.C. than now.   More than likely we'd lose far more votes than we gained campaigning on such a platform.  TheThe model state election results demonstrate we don't need to tack right to get votes. Doing so would likely be political suicide for the model democratic party."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,JerryLeRow,2,Wed May 6 17:55:32 2015 UTC,"The state elections went so well - at least partially - because we had the answers before they were public and thereby were able to steer our votes. As we likely have a mole in this sub, this strategy won't help us next time.   What?   And by drafting a bill that strengthens the people and the nation alike   How on earth would gutting the social safety net do that?"

ModelUSGov,34xhch,JerryLeRow,4,Tue May 5 19:49:13 2015 UTC,"Well, this actually gives incentive to find employment. Think, if you make an extra 5% for every dollar you earn rather than having welfare, you naturally want to earn more."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,jaywhoo,1 point,Tue May 5 19:56:33 2015 UTC,"An extra 5% for every dollar you make is a horrifying idea (no offense). Also this would basically just be a raise in income, what would lead to a consecutive raise in prices, and that again to a raise in tax income. It leads nowhere imo and only kicks the can further down the road. Also, how should we be able to forecast expenses for this program...  We have to reform entitlements, follow former German chancellor schroeder and demand more self-reliance from the people and cut programs. With an ageing population, a reform is due now."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,JerryLeRow,3,Tue May 5 20:01:18 2015 UTC,"That was an arbitrary number honestly. And it is only a raise in income for those beneath a certain income threshold, so we shouldn't see large cost increases across the board.  I'm personally all for tax cuts and cutting entitlements. This is just an idea for when the left inevitably calls for a compromise."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,DEYoungRepublicans,1 point,Tue May 5 20:07:56 2015 UTC,"As mentioned before, people with lower income actually often get more out of the system than they pay in, so we do have some negative taxes where they are necessary.  We could try to reform entitlements."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,oughton42,3,Tue May 5 20:16:22 2015 UTC,"I have proposed an amendment that drops the first bracket to 5%, second to 10% and so forth, up until the upper-middle and upper class. But heck I would be even happier with 0% if the nation can afford it. We would also have to cut spending/balance the budget prior to abolishing taxes.  Keep in mind we could also implement Economic Freedom Zones in lower-class areas with far lower tax rates (or no taxes) to aid the needy."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,kilgore_trout87,4,Tue May 5 20:21:24 2015 UTC,"The thing is that while these Economic ""Freedom"" Zones are great for big businesses, they're terrible for the middle and lower classes, as the Zones place all the power in the hands of corporations, which by their very nature do not favor the workers and the poor -- the average American citizen. Furthermore, many of the federal restrictions on business that these Zones would eliminate are crucial to ensuring quality of products, workplace safety, and the protection of the environment.  I cannot support any legislation that allows corporations to run unchecked in American cities. (edit: or anywhere else, for that matter.)"
ModelUSGov,34xhch,cameronc65,2,Tue May 5 20:32:22 2015 UTC,"I would be even happier with 0% if the nation can afford it.   We could afford tax the bottom bracket at 0% if this tax schedule didn't insist on handouts for the wealthy. The Estate Tax exemption threshold is absurdly high. Also, the Estate Tax ought to be taxed at more than two rates. And lastly, those rates ought to be a lot higher for the super rich."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,kingofquave,5,Tue May 5 16:06:32 2015 UTC,I think we should introduce a real tax reform that basis income tax off either percentile or quntile.
ModelUSGov,34xhch,kilgore_trout87,3,Tue May 5 21:34:47 2015 UTC,"I don't like this, we need higher, more progressive taxes."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,kilgore_trout87,4,Tue May 5 17:02:33 2015 UTC,"Major, major changes required for this bill to pass... I think the congresspeople below made their points on why this requires such extensive changes, so I don't think I need to say it."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,bluefisch200,1 point,Tue May 5 16:18:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think this bill is passable at all.  The whole premise is offering massive tax cuts to the rich, raising the amount excepted from the Estate Tax, and offering scraps to the poor and middle classes so everybody gets something (though several Republicans ITT have stated that they plan to offset the costs of the tax cuts by cutting programs aimed at assisting poor people, so there's no guarantee the poor will see a net gain in their pockets at all).  I believe this bill is strictly a nonstarter for the Democrats, and I hope the GL can agree."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,Xarasystral,2,Tue May 5 23:01:15 2015 UTC,"If you look at the comments below, G-L clearly agrees that the bill requires major changes."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,kilgore_trout87,1 point,Wed May 6 07:13:17 2015 UTC,"Oh, I've seen the comments.  And I was happy to see the GL find this bill equally repugnant.  I guess what I was saying is that I don't see this bill as salvagable, or at least, I don't see any willingness from the Republicans ITT to make the necessary changes.  I imagine this or a bill that looks similar to this going to vote and failing to pass.  I meant to urge the Republicans to either make those substantial changes or scrap the thing entirely and start from scratch in the interest of saving Congress the trouble of voting on a bill that is universally condemned by the majority of the House Dems and (I am guessing but it's a pretty educated guess) the House GLs."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,kilgore_trout87,2,Wed May 6 22:24:13 2015 UTC,"Should it go to vote as it is, this bill will be unanimously voted against by the G-L congressmen.   It's good to let the authors know that there is no point in them being steadfast on this bill when it is clearly doomed to fail unless it is revised significantly."
ModelUSGov,34xhch,TheRealRailguy,3,Wed May 6 22:35:01 2015 UTC,How are the current numbers for Section 2 / Subsection 1?
ModelUSGov,34vx65,rangerheart0,7,Tue May 5 00:20:23 2015 UTC,By far the best nominee for the position. I'm very glad to hear about this appointment!
ModelUSGov,34vx65,Prodigiousguy8,6,Tue May 5 00:41:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks, glad you feel that way! It really is an honor to be nominated."
ModelUSGov,34vx65,Logic_85,5,Tue May 5 00:48:57 2015 UTC,As Attorney General will you enforce laws that you or the President do not personally agree with?
ModelUSGov,34vx65,schultejt,5,Tue May 5 04:06:21 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. We shouldn't use our positions of power to turn tyrranical. Now, obviously, if there are constitutional issues at hand, that is another issue, but unless such an issue is raised, our jobs in the executive branch should be to enforce the law, not bend it to meet our personal convictions."
ModelUSGov,34vx65,Logic_85,3,Tue May 5 05:00:57 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you have stated before what your exact legal experiences have been, but do you mind restating them in this post /u/Logic_85?  Thank you!"
ModelUSGov,34vx65,2adamstoon,10,Tue May 5 00:22:13 2015 UTC,"Certainly.  I graduated cum laude from my law school several years back, with a designation in litigation.  Don't let this fool you, I'm no ambulance chaser--I also studied First and Fourteenth Amendment issues in depth, along with many other Constitutional law issues.  I represented my school at appellate brief competitions and mock trial competitions, and went into the legal world with a strong education.  Since graduating, I have focused on administrative law and tax law. My days consist of briefing issues relating to the IRS, the Department of Labor, or state agencies such as Labor and Revenue Department rulings and decisions.    I have spent the majority of my career fighting against bureaucracy and poor legislation, and the time is right for me to bring my skills and education to the government so I can fight the bureaucracy from within, and ensure the government diligently represents the interest of the people, in line with their Constitutional rights."
ModelUSGov,34vx65,Logic_85,7,Tue May 5 00:54:38 2015 UTC,"I hope you are confirmed quickly. You are the right choice for this position, and lucky for you, the bar from the previously rejected candidate is pretty much laying on the ground."
ModelUSGov,34vx65,Canadianman22,8,Tue May 5 01:26:34 2015 UTC,"While I hate to gain from the downfall of others, I have to admit that debacle has certainly helped my chances."
ModelUSGov,34vx65,Logic_85,9,Tue May 5 02:28:53 2015 UTC,"It was not a downfall, it was all self inflicted."
ModelUSGov,34vx65,Canadianman22,5,Tue May 5 02:39:30 2015 UTC,"From the limited interactions I've had with you, it seems like you are very intelligent, well written, and obviously very qualified for this position. I can't imagine a better nomination."
ModelUSGov,34vx65,cameronc65,5,Tue May 5 02:19:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I appreciate the kind words."
ModelUSGov,34vx65,Logic_85,3,Tue May 5 02:27:40 2015 UTC,"You seem like a fantastic candidate, I hope that the confirmation process works out in your favor!"
ModelUSGov,34vx65,zachfess,1 point,Tue May 5 01:39:57 2015 UTC,Hoping the same here--thanks!
ModelUSGov,34vx65,Logic_85,3,Tue May 5 06:10:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for presenting this information, you seem well qualified!"
ModelUSGov,34vx65,2adamstoon,3,Tue May 5 02:35:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you, as well!"
ModelUSGov,34vx65,Logic_85,2,Tue May 5 03:00:16 2015 UTC,"One of the most qualified cabinet nominations I've seen. Excellent choice, Mr. President."
ModelUSGov,34vx65,ben1204,3,Tue May 5 17:58:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it means a lot coming from you!"
ModelUSGov,34vx65,Logic_85,4,Tue May 5 18:04:10 2015 UTC,"I would be curious to hear it as well, given the massive issues that were had with the last nominee."
ModelUSGov,34vx65,Canadianman22,5,Tue May 5 00:36:44 2015 UTC,I am very certain that the same issues will not be had with this one.
ModelUSGov,34vx65,Canadianman22,2,Tue May 5 01:22:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you Mr.President, after seeing your candidate discuss his qualification, I am confident you knocked this one out of the park."
ModelUSGov,34vx65,DEYoungRepublicans,3,Tue May 5 01:28:28 2015 UTC,What is your opinion on civil asset forfeiture?
ModelUSGov,34vx65,Logic_85,3,Tue May 5 14:38:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not comfortable with it.  In a perfect system, it would seize assets purchased by illicit money and be sold to compensate victims of those crimes, and to slow the spread of criminal organizations.    But we don't have a perfect system; too many of the places that try this end up using it pad a police budget or protect their bottom line.  Police pick and choose what assets they will seize, based on personal bias or the size of the asset.  Essentially, corruption seeps in.  There is also a Constitutional issue, as the assets are often seized before a proper adjudication--sometimes people found innocent are still deprived of their property, which in my opinion is a violation of the 5th Amendment and 14th Amendment due process clauses.  Unless we can develop a way to ensure that doesn't happen, I won't approve of new civil asset forfeiture programs."
ModelUSGov,34vx65,kilgore_trout87,3,Tue May 5 15:48:52 2015 UTC,Seems like a great pick!
ModelUSGov,34vx65,Logic_85,2,Tue May 5 15:25:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I appreciate the kind words!"
ModelUSGov,34vx65,Smitty9913,2,Tue May 5 15:49:01 2015 UTC,What party do you find most at home woth?
ModelUSGov,34vx65,Logic_85,5,Tue May 5 01:23:18 2015 UTC,"Tough question. I went independent years ago after I got too frustrated with the right. That said, the left hasn't offered much, either. I like the republican party's focus on individual rights, and the left on social change with the same focus.   I also like the GLs focus on laborors rights, and the libertarians on property rights.   I can't really say one party that I prefer more or less. It's too much of a grab-bag for me. That, and I fear partisan politics control too much. Thus, at best, I call myself a centrist."
ModelUSGov,34vx65,jacoby531,2,Tue May 5 02:32:45 2015 UTC,"Looks like a great choice for this position, hopefully they will be confirmed."
ModelUSGov,34vx65,Logic_85,3,Tue May 5 01:40:54 2015 UTC,Thanks for the kind words. I'm hoping the same!
ModelUSGov,34vx65,IBiteYou,2,Tue May 5 02:33:02 2015 UTC,I'm really glad there is a position for you in the Model Government.  You seem like a great choice.
ModelUSGov,34vx65,Logic_85,2,Tue May 5 04:08:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I appreciate the support!"
ModelUSGov,34vx65,Didicet,1 point,Tue May 5 06:11:18 2015 UTC,"Great candidate for the position. Congratulations, /u/Logic_85!"
ModelUSGov,34vx65,Sheppio734,1 point,Fri May 8 00:09:07 2015 UTC,"I think he'd probably serve better as a SC Justice, but I don't believe we have any positions open right now."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,SeptimusSette,9,Sun May 3 22:10:33 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the government would please enlighten us all as to what cuts will be made in order to reach your goal of 50%. I believe the government should show the American people that this massive reduction in spending will not compromise America's safety.  EDIT: I would also like to ask this government to provide the numbers of those who will become unemployed due to this bill, as well as how far behind America will become technologically."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Canadianman22,3,Sun May 3 22:22:12 2015 UTC,Well I'd like to start by stopping the production of tanks and other armaments that will never see the light of day because of this country's military-industrial complex.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,utdude999,5,Sun May 3 23:20:30 2015 UTC,"As to my edit, once you publish a full document outlining what is being cut, will you also provide the unemployment figures this bill will create?"
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Canadianman22,3,Sun May 3 23:24:02 2015 UTC,"We've already included a provision to increase funding for any and all veterans. From past wars or the ones who will retire from this bill. That will include medical help as well as unemployment benefits and help finding a new career. The army prepares people for many civilian careers, I believe they will do fine with our help."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,utdude999,5,Sun May 3 23:27:45 2015 UTC,"That is not what I am talking about. I am talking about all the companies that supply equipment to the military, that are responsible for well over 1 million Americans being employed directly, and even more employed indirectly all along the supply chain. Does this bill also include a provision to help all of them find new jobs, or is the government simply shooting from the hip without thinking?"
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Canadianman22,1 point,Sun May 3 23:34:07 2015 UTC,Okay then let's stop slashing the education budget. How many teachers are put out of jobs every year in favor of building more and better weapons to kill people with?
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,utdude999,7,Sun May 3 23:39:53 2015 UTC,"Ah, the GLP tactic of trying to change the subject. Thank you for proving my point. This government has not thought any of this bill through, and is simply trying to tear down the military for ideological reasons."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Canadianman22,2,Sun May 3 23:45:14 2015 UTC,"I'm saying it's silly to oppose the cutting of funding of one section of government over fear of lost jobs, but ignore all the other cuts made that also cause lost jobs. I'd say teachers are much more important than arms manufacturers."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,utdude999,4,Sun May 3 23:48:15 2015 UTC,"What other cuts? We are talking about THIS bill, and THESE cuts which have yet to even be discussed as to WHAT is being cut. If the GLP believes it has a good plan, it should be willing to fully discuss what it plans to cut and when, as well as give us the full figure of how many jobs are going to be lost."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Canadianman22,4,Sun May 3 23:53:02 2015 UTC,"We've made it clear we will be closing all bases around the world, that will represent a large percentage of cuts that will be made. That will cost no jobs and will simply shift soldiers back home to their families."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,utdude999,5,Mon May 4 00:00:50 2015 UTC,The people whose jobs this bill would eliminate are not veterans.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,evanb_,1 point,Mon May 4 03:19:05 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the production of tanks and unspecified armaments don't take up that large of a spending percentage. I'll link you to a source.   The primary tank that America produces (not including Stryker vehicle, Bradley APCs, or other light armor) is the M1A1 Abrams. Because we lose so few (they are unsurprisingly RPG-resistant), we don't produce that many. Of the 550 billion currently set aside in ModelUSGov, only 4 billion would be spent on tank production/modification, and the 4 billion is heavily spent on upgrading existing systems. (If you recall that whole ""body armor"" and ""soldiers using cardboard on Humvees"" for protection debacle; don't worry, our reactive armor is on-point.  Here's the source. I wish I could be everywhere in this thread!"
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,2,Mon May 4 07:37:23 2015 UTC,Does the Administration intend to withdraw us from NATO?
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,IBiteYou,1 point,Mon May 4 16:48:53 2015 UTC,"I have not been part of any such discussions, nor have I seen any sign of that intention."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,7,Mon May 4 17:15:09 2015 UTC,"Even with a 50% cut, we'd be ahead of the second highest spending country, China."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Sheppio734,10,Sun May 3 22:30:29 2015 UTC,"If I may say so, that's completely irrelevant, Mr. Senator.   The average American military personnel costs the United States government approximately $100,000 in salary and benefits. We also have extensive amounts of equipment to maintain - small arms, missiles, armored vehicles, aircraft, aircraft carriers, etc. The Chinese have some, but not all of these.   What cuts do you propose exactly?"
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Sheppio734,3,Sun May 3 22:51:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not supporting the cut, I'm stating a fact. I'm not especially versed in the workings of military, so I don't really think it's my place to give a number on a military spending cut."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,4,Mon May 4 00:08:32 2015 UTC,"While that may be true, it is an empty statement at best. Our personnel and our equipment costs much more to maintain than it costs the Chinese or the Russians to maintain theirs. To put it simply, if we matched the Chinese in spending, we would effectively be receiving less."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Sheppio734,3,Mon May 4 06:48:32 2015 UTC,"Koelsch (Don't you hate how Reddit wouldn't accept Kölsch?) is correct.   Though we may be over X% spending on China, that does not imply we have 'x' percent more equipment. For a quick example, the (laughable) Chinese Type 99 tank costs $2.6m. to build, while the equivalent main battle tank for the US, the M1A1 Abrams, costs over $6m."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Canadianman22,2,Mon May 4 07:30:42 2015 UTC,"That's true. We have different needs, and I have no experience with what all goes into our military. I would need to consult someone much more knowledgeable about the subject."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,TheRealRailguy,5,Mon May 4 09:39:00 2015 UTC,"As I have said, the government should outline what exactly the planned cuts are in order to make the planned 50% total cuts. The American people deserve to know how the government plans to do this, and to see that this will not in any way affect the safety of America and the American people."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Canadianman22,1 point,Sun May 3 22:33:24 2015 UTC,"The question of ""how many people will become unemployed due to government cuts"" is, in my eyes, irrelevant.  Most government jobs should be viewed as temporary.  If cutting these jobs is somehow a barrier to removing unneeded spending, then we head towards a scenario where our citizens are dependent on the government for jobs instead of the free market."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,2,Mon May 4 04:37:06 2015 UTC,"We are not talking about government jobs. We are talking about companies that make military equipment, suppliers for those companies, R&D which are really high paying jobs, all gone."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,TheRealRailguy,1 point,Mon May 4 04:53:04 2015 UTC,"Actually, this would be very notable. These would include many private jobs; companies that produce steel and brass, energy corporations, countless contractor-operated factories, private scientists or doctors who are hired temporarily to research for the CDC...there's no point in going on.  For example, a privately-owned company in Independence, Missouri provides about 97% of the U.S. Army/Marines' small-caliber ammunition, from 9mm, to .300 Win Mag, to 7.62 NATO, etc. It currently employes about 18,000 people. Within 5 years, it would have to layoff about 5,000 workers.   That's a single company. The math is quite astounding."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,dreasdif118,1 point,Tue May 5 03:39:56 2015 UTC,"The same concept applies.  Those are jobs created solely because the government spends too much.  They are in no way permanent jobs, and should not be considered as such.  Government policies cannot be hindered by the government dependent jobs they create or destroy, because, again, there will be no way to ever cut our spending if people oppose spending cuts that remove jobs.  We're essentially paying the salaries of those people with our taxes."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Danotto94,9,Tue May 5 11:29:40 2015 UTC,"I think this bill has good intentions but, I have some problems with it. One, the reduction in spending is huge. 50% is way too much. I mean, I'd understand 10% but not that much. It would jeopardize our safety home and abroad. Second, we shouldn't shut down overseas bases. That would make us more isolationist than we need to be. Lastly, we cannot have alleged foreign terrorists be tried in a civil court. They are not citizens. They must be tried in a military tribunal."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,dreasdif118,4,Sun May 3 22:56:40 2015 UTC,Does that mean rest of the world is isolationist since AFAIK most other countries don't have a myriad of bases around the globe?
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Danotto94,4,Sun May 3 23:04:15 2015 UTC,"Well we are a major superpower and even though we shouldn't be the world's policemen, we have to remain powerful."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,4,Mon May 4 00:03:56 2015 UTC,"Does maintaining so much power not facilitate corruption, abuse, misuse, etc.? Haven't there been powerful empires in the past that haven't eventually caused massive abuse? Don't you think there's/are (a) better alternative(s)?"
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,IBiteYou,3,Mon May 4 00:09:07 2015 UTC,"If I may,  The point of American bases worldwide aren't to ""remain powerful"" or for posturing; they serve as quick-deployment centers. They are extremely strategic and located in many of our allies' countries, such as England and Germany. Germany happens to be a former enemy, but its central location in Europe provides a vital center for both deployment and emergency advanced surgical care for medevacd soldiers.  Nobody else has bases in America because it would be a waste of money. It would be a waste of any sort of money, fuel, or resources to fly TO America, unless the destination is America."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,3,Mon May 4 07:42:15 2015 UTC,"I think, though, that we do have some exchange training programs here with soldiers from other nations, don't we?"
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,3,Mon May 4 16:56:57 2015 UTC,"We do. Each year, we send dozens of troops to a variety of allied nations, including Spain, the United Kingdom, and Germany. We also operate programs with other nations in which their forces train here.  An interesting case of this is the Polish elite special forces unit  GROM, which completed training here in many environments not found in Poland. (Such as swamps.) GROM is internationally as respected and skilled as Seal Team 6, the Israeli Sayaret, the British SAS, etc."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,7,Mon May 4 17:23:10 2015 UTC,"The Green-Left Party does realize that the budget that was just signed into law cut a substantial amount of monies from the defense budget, correct?"
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,houinator,1 point,Mon May 4 03:49:32 2015 UTC,"To prove numbers, my predecessor requested $870 billion dollars. $500 billion was granted. The current requisition (and grant) for the DoD is just over $600 billion. So yes, our current budget is a large cut. However, budget hearings will be conducted this week that may shine light on all areas of the issue."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Eilanyan,11,Sun May 10 10:13:34 2015 UTC,"Good, at least we know the communist revolution won't come for another 10 years."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,6,Sun May 3 22:35:58 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, are we taking into account previous defense spending cuts passed by Modelusgov here?  I know defense spending has already been hit by other bills, such as the previous budget.  I ask, because we have a treaty obligation under NATO to contribute at least 2% of our GDP towards defense spending, and this bill combined with previous defense cuts seem like they would push us below that threshold (especially if our GDP grows over the next ten years).   promote the creation of an internationally-funded war-crime-prevention army that can be audited at any time by anyone if it can be designed/run in a way that minimizes/eliminates corruptibility/abuse of any sort.   This is extremely vague, and seems like it should really be its own standalone bill.  The United Nations are already tasked with preventing war crimes under the Responsibility to Protect Doctrine, and although they are not performing their job very well, I don't see why another international peacekeeping force would perform any better."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Eilanyan,6,Mon May 4 01:43:40 2015 UTC,"The legislation so far has been social-democrat not even dem-soc. Sure, if the GL gets into supporting violent communist revolution, I'll jump ship to be an independent. But we are no where near that. We haven't even raised taxes to the Reagan era, so abolishing private property is far off. Even the latter is openly purposed by the platforms and is not advocacy violent revolution."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,5,Mon May 4 00:00:30 2015 UTC,so far
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Eilanyan,6,Mon May 4 00:04:24 2015 UTC,"Sure, but you could throw that at anyone and anything. Should I claim the House Republicans, so far have been okay but gosh darn it, they gonna go FULL FASCISM any second."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,5,Mon May 4 00:09:18 2015 UTC,Nobody in our party has advocated fascism.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Eilanyan,5,Mon May 4 00:11:52 2015 UTC,"Well given varied support for illegal police killings and the general national security state, and general support for the government-corporate merging that is today's capitalism, I would tend to disagree."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,4,Mon May 4 00:13:49 2015 UTC,A nuanced argument in support of a system that may be imperfect is not the same as outright support for the violent overthrow of government.  Get your facts straight and your head checked.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Eilanyan,4,Mon May 4 00:15:51 2015 UTC,"I never said violent overthrow, I do mean staying the course (with some tweaks) with the violence the government already commits. You may say that capitalist violence is the least evil but there's nothing capitalist about the national security state except through the outsourcing of profit and jobs to the private sector."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Danotto94,4,Mon May 4 00:21:35 2015 UTC,Edit: wrong reply. The idea that the US is a police state itself is flawed.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,7,Mon May 4 00:50:49 2015 UTC,"Glad to know that the US doesn't execute citizens (or foreigners but who care about them) abroad because ""due process does not mean judicial process"" even if they are 16 and have no evidence against them. Or that the government does not spy on everyone, on everything. Or that black people are not the target of police brutality. Nope all flawed and don't exist."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Danotto94,4,Mon May 4 01:13:39 2015 UTC,I don't think this comment contributes to a constructive conversation/discussion.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,7,Sun May 3 23:00:53 2015 UTC,"I think it does. The GLP has made it clear that this is the end goal, and that is terrifying to be honest."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,rangerheart0,3,Sun May 3 23:07:56 2015 UTC,I'm really curious as to why you think it's terrifying.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,6,Sun May 3 23:09:41 2015 UTC,You shouldn't have to guess why a the prospect of a violent revolution terrifies me.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Danotto94,3,Sun May 3 23:14:06 2015 UTC,Do you just oppose violent revolution in the united states or in general as a principle?
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,5,Sun May 3 23:51:33 2015 UTC,"I oppose the violent revolution against the United States government, a  government by the people, for the people."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Danotto94,4,Sun May 3 23:58:08 2015 UTC,It's actually proven the government doesn't tend to act in the interest of the majority of the (legal resident) population. This is exactly what the GLP is trying to change.

ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Danotto94,3,Mon May 4 00:44:22 2015 UTC,"Here, here and other sources."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Canadianman22,1 point,Mon May 4 00:48:22 2015 UTC,"Interest of the majority is not always best. For example, freedoms in the bill of rights were designed to protect minorities from disparate treatment."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Danotto94,5,Mon May 4 03:01:32 2015 UTC,Interest of the minority isn't always the best either.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,SolidBlues,5,Mon May 4 03:06:14 2015 UTC,"Violent revolution is never the way to go. When you have to force your values on people by force, your values need to be reconsidered. If your values were truly good, people would want them of their own free will."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,2,Mon May 4 13:58:40 2015 UTC,What are we doing that's violent? Promoting democracy and reduced spending which AFAIK is what republicans promote anyways?
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Danotto94,2,Sun May 3 23:15:11 2015 UTC,Reducing spending on welfare programs to help black people != reducing spending on bombs for killing brown people
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,2,Mon May 4 01:26:19 2015 UTC,Many members of your party have repeatedly stated that this is the end goal.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Danotto94,5,Sun May 3 23:19:30 2015 UTC,"Do they use the world ""violent?"""
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,ehbrums1,4,Sun May 3 23:22:18 2015 UTC,Yes.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,3,Sun May 3 23:24:08 2015 UTC,"Even if one/multiple users advocate for it, they don't officially represent the party. The GLP doesn't formally advocate for violent revolution as it's not even possible in this simulation. People have the right to their own opinions which is a right I'd expect you to defend. I'm not denying someone/people may have used the phrase, but when you're in the mood, it'd be nice if you can please provide examples because I'm unaware of any aside from one person who didn't directly call for it and haven't found any others."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Zeria0308,4,Mon May 4 00:44:37 2015 UTC,"most members of the GLP, for the purposes of this simulation, are committed to parliamentary process."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,3,Sun May 3 23:11:13 2015 UTC,*so long as it furthers their end goal
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Zeria0308,3,Sun May 3 23:14:32 2015 UTC,Just like every other party.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,4,Sun May 3 23:16:36 2015 UTC,Yet not every party has the end goal of the violent overthrow of the government.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Zeria0308,2,Sun May 3 23:18:54 2015 UTC,Which is irrelevant to the simulation since it can't happen here. Within the simulation the party's goal is to try and achieve socialism through parliamentary means.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,ehbrums1,5,Sun May 3 23:19:46 2015 UTC,"You haven't seen the events that have gone on, have you?  EDIT: Furthermore, we should treat this simulation as if it is real. To do otherwise would be a cop out."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,4,Sun May 3 23:22:54 2015 UTC,"I do treat it as if it is real, but our party simply lacks any ability to stage a revolution. Not to mention that violent revolution is listed nowhere in our party platform and isn't even supported by all members of the party."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Danotto94,2,Sun May 3 23:25:05 2015 UTC,Every party has goals
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,4,Sun May 3 23:16:18 2015 UTC,Yet not every party has the end goal of the violent overthrow of the government.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Danotto94,3,Sun May 3 23:18:44 2015 UTC,You have yet to explain to *us how we're being violent. What are we doing that's violent?
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,ehbrums1,2,Sun May 3 23:19:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not in the mood to dig through threads for comments. Members of your party have repeatedly advocated the violent overthrow of government. You're free to deny this fact, but I'm also free to call you a liar if you do so."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,2,Sun May 3 23:22:31 2015 UTC,I haven't seen them use the word but I'll see for myself.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,ehbrums1,3,Sun May 3 23:25:41 2015 UTC,talk to me when that happens.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,SomeRealShit,4,Sun May 3 23:23:01 2015 UTC,"I won't be able to, as I'll probably be violently murdered in the process by many of your comrades."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,ehbrums1,3,Sun May 3 23:24:00 2015 UTC,I'm a dem soc. we've been on the wall right there with you.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Canadianman22,2,Sun May 3 23:25:42 2015 UTC,I'd beg to differ on that one. Have you seen some of the things said back when there used to be everyone in a Skype chat?
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,oughton42,3,Sun May 3 23:17:00 2015 UTC,funny how there has been zero attempt....
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Canadianman22,3,Sun May 3 23:18:30 2015 UTC,You have not been in power very long....
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,oughton42,2,Sun May 3 23:20:36 2015 UTC,"You seem to forget that the Party just kicked out someone who wanted us to try and ""overthrow"" the simulation. We are staunchly against revolution in the simulation.   I personally am even against revolution in the United States IRL right now; the U.S. population is nowhere near ready for a revolution. In the meantime, I fully advocate participation within the system in order to advance the rights of workers and promote socialist thought."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,IBiteYou,2,Sun May 3 23:32:02 2015 UTC,"You seem to forget that the Party just kicked out someone who wanted us to try and ""overthrow"" the simulation   So that was the only person? I highly doubt that. There have been many who would prefer to see change come through a bloody revolution so to speak."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,loopmoploop,2,Sun May 3 23:35:49 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to what everyone in my Party thinks -- I do not know the details of all of my colleagues political thoughts. What I can do is assure you that there is no discussion on a Party-wide basis of revolution or any action outside of the U.S. governmental process (within this simulation; once again, I can't say what they all want IRL).  Unfortunately, there is no way to show this to you without leaking Party information, which I have no intention to do. You'll have to trust me -- the GLP has no interest in subverting the processes already in place within the simulation and the greater U.S. political structures."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,11,Sun May 3 23:42:53 2015 UTC,Ah.  Here it is.  The destroy the military and complete total isolation bill.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Danotto94,5,Mon May 4 00:22:42 2015 UTC,"I'm all for reduced military spending, but 50% over ten years looks like too much too fast to me. I'd like to see some more specific information about what is to be cut.  I'd also like to see section two completely stricken from the bill - closing all of our military bases abroad is just not good foreign policy, and reduces the ability of the United States to react to situations of importance around the globe. How can our allies be assured of our support when we are actively retreating away from the crisis centers of the modern world?   The ""internationally-funded war-crime-prevention army"" also seems quite bogus to me. No good method laid out to organize or control this force.   To me, this bill looks well-intentioned, but poorly executed. I'll need to see some major amendments to it before I can give it my support. Until that time, I would urge all members of Congress to vote against it."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,8,Mon May 4 00:31:07 2015 UTC,Thank god for the GLP cutting unnecessary costs.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,utdude999,5,Sun May 3 22:39:28 2015 UTC,"Funny but why does the US have to play ""world cop?"" Why can't the rest of the world contribute to ""keeping the world safe"" as you think the military does?"
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,5,Sun May 3 22:59:45 2015 UTC,"The US has historically defended freedom abroad. Whether you think that is ethical or not is a different discussion. Regardless, we as a nation do not exist in a vacuum, and it would be idiotic to the safety of American citizens to so drastically remove our presence throughout the world."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,utdude999,5,Sun May 3 23:10:11 2015 UTC,"Who are you afraid of? Which country is a direct threat to the American homeland? A 50% cut would still leave us way better financed than any other country, China and Russia included. We also have many allies willing to help us."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,5,Sun May 3 23:16:00 2015 UTC,"ISIS, Boko Haram, Iran, to name a few. And war has evolved: allies mean squat. The ability to respond and deflect is the main use of military now."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,utdude999,5,Sun May 3 23:21:33 2015 UTC,So those groups are ready for an invasion of the U.S.? Those are local problems that should be dealt with locally. And Iran's threat is nuclear. We could throw the entire budget at our military and it wouldn't help a single bit if they decided to hit the button.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,4,Sun May 3 23:23:31 2015 UTC,"Threat =\= invasion, especially in the post colonial world.  Terrorism is the number one threat to the safety of the United States   Furthermore, a large sum of defense funding goes to R&D to defend against the indefensible."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,utdude999,6,Sun May 3 23:25:43 2015 UTC,"And how has the military done with handling terrorism so far considering they're most likely the cause of it in the first place?  I'd rather see disarmament than another arms race for ""defensive"" weapons against nukes."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,IBiteYou,5,Sun May 3 23:33:45 2015 UTC,Do explain how the US military has caused terrorism...
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,utdude999,5,Sun May 3 23:34:57 2015 UTC,"Ever heard of Oliver North? The Iran-Contra affair? We literally armed the people who attacked us in an attempt to overthrow a democratic, albeit leftist, government."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,IBiteYou,2,Sun May 3 23:38:03 2015 UTC,Tell me.  How do the Greens stand on nuclear weapons?
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,utdude999,4,Mon May 4 16:42:38 2015 UTC,"Well I don't speak for the entire party, but as the green part of my party's name implies, I am against them. They are the highest weaponized threat to the human race and the planet as a whole.   I like the Kardashev scale of civilizations and to get from type 0 to type 1 needs nuclear energy but also creates a weapon capable of wiping out said civilization. I believe that's why we've never had contact with an alien species, they haven't passed the test of nuclear weapons."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,IBiteYou,2,Mon May 4 16:47:12 2015 UTC,"As far as you know, would your party support disarming the USA of nuclear weapons in the current climate?"
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,utdude999,4,Mon May 4 17:01:14 2015 UTC,"That's not something I'm ready to make an answer on. We as a party have not discussed it and as an umbrella party, I don't feel comfortable using my personal answer as the party's answer."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,utdude999,3,Mon May 4 17:32:16 2015 UTC,When you are talking about shrinking the military by 50%... it becomes a VERY important question.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,IBiteYou,5,Mon May 4 18:08:16 2015 UTC,"Again, I'm unwilling to answer for my party with a discussion first.  Although the numbers show that if we disarmed 50% of our active warheads, we'd be right behind Russia by ourselves and still be way ahead of them when combined with our faithful allies."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,4,Mon May 4 18:16:47 2015 UTC,Where do the Republicans stand on them?
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,3,Mon May 4 16:52:41 2015 UTC,We support maintaining our nuclear arsenal.  OK.  Now you.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Danotto94,8,Mon May 4 17:00:15 2015 UTC,"The US has historically defended freedom abroad   No, no it has not. There have been numerous instances, especially in the Cold War, where the United States supported fascist or dictatorial regimes in order to support our interests.  Guatemala, Chile, Haiti, and Iran are all examples of the US government throwing freedom out the window when it suited us."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,4,Mon May 4 00:26:35 2015 UTC,"Some solid cherry picking you've done there. Forget about historical context, right?"
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,ben1204,6,Mon May 4 00:43:16 2015 UTC,I'd like to see you justify any of those.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,4,Mon May 4 00:46:11 2015 UTC,"Literally all of them were, at the time, deemed necessary to protect the United States. As a statesman, in historical context it seems relatively simple to understand this."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,5,Mon May 4 00:53:01 2015 UTC,So you only care about protecting the US even if it means hurting non-US-citizens?
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,bleepbloop12345,3,Mon May 4 06:11:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to go out of my way to harm residents of other nations to better mine.   However, as a statesman, I will prioritize the wellbeing and security of my fellow statesmen, in the same way that I expect anyone from the UK, Iran, Russia, Venezuela, etc. to prioritize the wellbeing of their countrymen."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Smitty9913,2,Mon May 4 06:27:06 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. Iran nationalized their oil industry, and the US supported a coup because they didn't like that."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Danotto94,2,Mon May 4 03:59:30 2015 UTC,"You can't just say ""because they didn't like that.""   A simple look into history would show that this endangered the security of many of the other oil producing nations in the surrounding area. Keep in mind this was before the existence of OPEC"
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,6,Mon May 4 04:51:54 2015 UTC,I don't know how you can argue that death squads in Guatemala supported freedom.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Eilanyan,4,Mon May 4 01:00:24 2015 UTC,That's being consequentialist
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,5,Mon May 4 01:01:08 2015 UTC,"You're probably right to be fair, all of those nuns that got raped by American backed death squads were probably just weeks away from invading the US and murdering us all in our sleep."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Eilanyan,2,Mon May 4 09:54:38 2015 UTC,Why are you just a clerk now?
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,3,Mon May 4 15:52:07 2015 UTC,"AFAIK that's true with the Nazi era but can you please provide more examples? As for safety, the bill mentions the creation of a globally-supported defense unit that'd do the good things the US military does today so one country doesn't carry the burden of being ""world cop."""
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Eilanyan,6,Sun May 3 23:14:19 2015 UTC,"ISIS, Boko Haram, Iran, all off the top of my head are threats to our security."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,JerryLeRow,4,Sun May 3 23:20:15 2015 UTC,Nothing say democracy like overthrowing the democratically elected leader of Iran and putting in a dictator.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,rangerheart0,3,Sun May 3 23:42:41 2015 UTC,That's some presentism if I've ever seen it.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,jaywhoo,6,Sun May 3 23:43:59 2015 UTC,"So, you think in the 1950's, that was an excellent idea? Or that it was not contradictory to ""protecting freedom and democracy""?"
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,JerryLeRow,4,Sun May 3 23:47:31 2015 UTC,"Considering the time, I think yes, it made sense within historical context."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,5,Sun May 3 23:49:18 2015 UTC,"Okay, but that would be a disagreement, rather then throwing out fallacies as an argument. I would argue that the US rarely (not never) fights for liberal democracy but instead for opening of markets, which sometimes involves establishing a liberal democracy. Mind you, as seen in Iraq, just because you can vote does not mean your new government is not undemocratic and corrupt."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,IBiteYou,8,Sun May 3 23:55:47 2015 UTC,Simple maths: reducing it every year by 5% means a reduction of roughly 40%.  That's way too fast.  Closing all military bases abroad is dangerous.  My opinion: dump it.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,5,Sun May 3 23:00:50 2015 UTC,"Actually I was talking to the Secretary of Defense about budget cuts. By their estimate we could reduce the 500 billion dollar military budget by around 100 billion by the next budget bill with a thorough enough plan. In a manner that would keep us technologically at pace with the rest of the world. 20% in one year is pretty good for a plan that aims to reduce the budget by 5% a year.  Edit: I realize that ""at pace"" was poor wording. We could maintain national security and sufficient defense against our current enemies was what I meant by it."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,IBiteYou,7,Sun May 3 23:04:08 2015 UTC,"I live how the president simply wants us to be ""at pace"" with the rest of the world."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,2,Mon May 4 03:05:37 2015 UTC,"You could take Eisenhower's approach, give every military base commander who can reduce the costs of his base by e.g. 20% a higher rank... best motivator. Talk to the SoD.  Also the actual budget is closer to 600bn than 500 :/ , so 20% would mean about 120 bn. In one year? You can't do that. Just as companies should grow organically, they should also shrink sustainably. Same with the DoD."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Danotto94,2,Mon May 4 07:15:08 2015 UTC,"I can hop in and confirm. Yes, the Department of Defense could operate and keep ""at pace"" with the rest of the world with around a $400b. budget in this next year."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,JerryLeRow,3,Mon May 4 07:26:35 2015 UTC,We don't want you at pace.  We want you superior.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,JerryLeRow,3,Mon May 4 16:45:39 2015 UTC,"I merely provided the numbers for use. The figures are highly ""volatile,"" too; if GDP changes or if another country finds some sort of research breakthrough, we could fall behind easily.   I would like to expressly say that we would not be in any danger of a nation or coalition of nations invading America, but we would not be the military superpower at that time."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,JerryLeRow,3,Mon May 4 17:17:12 2015 UTC,I understand.  I am just expressing my thoughts.  The idea that we would let the military fall behind is intolerable.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,JerryLeRow,5,Mon May 4 17:20:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your thoughts, Senator. I certainly appreciate hearing from everyone on an issue this hotly contested."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Gohte,4,Mon May 4 17:24:39 2015 UTC,Why do you think it's dangerous?
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,JerryLeRow,1 point,Sun May 3 23:02:43 2015 UTC,"This nation is the world's only superpower, and throughout history we have intervened to protect our country from foreign agressors as well as protecting friendly countries and people from tyrants. The military bases abroad give our friends and allies a feeling of safety and us the ability to intervene quicker in the entire world. Our bases abroad are the foundation of a modern world-wide empire, a symbol of our status as the free world's leading country and an opportunity to tackle conflicts. Yes, we may have stood on the wrong side of history sometimes, but we must not let other nations - like China, which enslaves its own people to expand its power, or Russia which still dreams of being an empire, though its economy lies in shards - tighten their oppressive grip on the world's growing regions."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,SomeRealShit,3,Mon May 4 07:21:29 2015 UTC,"I was going to respond, saying that you're romanticizing hegemony and hypocritically criticizing the perceived hegemony of modern-day Russia and China until I saw:   a modern world-wide empire   The fact that you outright support imperialism... I don't even know what to say..."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Danotto94,1 point,Wed May 6 07:06:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, finally someone understands me: I'm absolutely pro US-hegemony, and I support it's military empire. The top officials may have made some mistakes over the past decades, but the American people always know what's right and what's wrong.   I prefer to have the US in this position rather than china or russia. Though I think US should cooperate with the two nations, as they are (becoming) great powers and cooperation could increase the chances of a more peaceful world."

ModelUSGov,34rcvo,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,1 point,Wed May 6 18:42:17 2015 UTC,Your comment has been removed for containing an unprofessional image macro.     This is your first warning.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Xarasystral,5,Wed May 6 18:42:31 2015 UTC,"I agree, I feel that a small scale back is much better. But this piece of legislation is irreparable and must die on the floor."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,oughton42,4,Thu May 7 01:45:26 2015 UTC,"How is it ""irreparable?"""
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,SomeRealShit,1 point,Sun May 3 23:15:43 2015 UTC,"Sure, I have nothing against taking a few billions out, and sending them to foreign aid or renew some of our infrastructure at home."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,utdude999,4,Sun May 3 23:21:26 2015 UTC,"I would save closing Guantanamo for a different bill, as opposed to tacking on legislation to a separate bill."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,SomeRealShit,3,Mon May 4 07:14:29 2015 UTC,"That's a possibility. But considering this bill involves closing other bases, we thought it would work here."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,utdude999,4,Sun May 3 22:29:47 2015 UTC,"Fully support, it's moderate reduction over a ten year period and closes the imperialist (at best) bases around the world. I see some members of the other parties supporting cuts but when it comes down to it, they seem to only suggest minor changes around the margins."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,SomeRealShit,1 point,Sun May 3 23:14:32 2015 UTC,"Moderate reduction is not 5% per year, I believe, but that's just my professional opinion. Also, many of our bases in foreign allied countries, such as Germany or the UK, are not only beneficial to that community, but to medevacd troops from any area in the Middle east who may require the best surgery possible. A C-130 flight from, say, Iraq to Stuttgart carrying a soldier who requires precision eye surgery to save his vision (I am using a real-life example) is much shorter than Iraq to Maryland and may save the soldier in question's sight."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,2,Sun May 3 23:46:08 2015 UTC,"When the budget is so large and bloated, I think 5% is moderate; if we're talking Canada's military not so much.   I understand there are benefits, I feel the negatives outweigh it and the need for such close bases are from such imperialist wars such as Iraq."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,utdude999,1 point,Tue May 5 03:43:50 2015 UTC,"Closing Iraqi/Afghani military bases would require a complete troop withdrawal from those countries, which would require another piece of legislation."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,5,Tue May 5 03:53:26 2015 UTC,"I'm concerned greatly by this bill. As some of your members can attest to, I work very well with members of other parties. I believe compromise and bi(tri?)partisanship is absolutely vital to the survival of our country. I also believe that an above-par military is necessary for our country.  I agree that our military is terribly over-funded, but I believe a 50% reduction is a bit drastic. Many of your arguments are, ""Even with a 50% deduction, we'll be ahead of #2 in military spending."" That is true. However, the United States is the country that every other country, whether or not some of you like it, looks to help in times of distress. We are also the country that many (not all) other countries want to see ""off of our pedestal,"" per se. This is why we need our military to be better than any other military in this world. (When you're at the top, people love to see you fall down.)  I propose the following changes: Let us continue with the military budget reduction, but only commit to a 2% decrease per-year for ten years resulting in an eventual 20% decrease. We'll increase the funding for veteran support by 2% each year for five years, and then use the remaining 10% budget taken away to support other ventures such as NASA. Lastly, we will not close ALL international military bases. This is just too important for our continued safety. The closing of Guantanamo Bay can continue, therefore I do not wish to strike that section.  If you agree with my proposed changes, or wish to offer your own advices, let me know. I'll gladly work with anyone and assist with any compromise we can come to in order to push this bill further through. However, without compromise, I will not support this bill in its current form."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,utdude999,1 point,Tue May 5 04:01:45 2015 UTC,"I am okay with this as a compromise. If we find that we need to reduce the budget past that 20%, we can always do that then. I would support this as an amendment."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,3,Mon May 4 02:29:55 2015 UTC,"Look, I'm all for a reduced military but:   Let the United States military close all international military bases over the next twenty-five years but continue cooperation with other nations’ defense concerns and promote the creation of an internationally-funded war-crime-prevention army that can be audited at any time by anyone if it can be designed/run in a way that minimizes/eliminates corruptibility/abuse of any sort.   I believe we should hold onto some bases just because it might seem unwise due to impending conflicts in the Middle East and Eastern Europe.   the United states will cease renting Guantanamo Bay from Cuba   While I don't condone using the base as a prison, that's a pretty convenient piece of real estate to have a naval base on in the Caribbean.  EDIT: Just to clarify, I'm not a military interventionist but in my life when a friend asks for help in a fight, I'd feel really shitty for not backing them up."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,utdude999,5,Mon May 4 12:58:40 2015 UTC,"As for Guantanamo, Florida is less than 500 miles away. I fail to see how that's too far a distance for the largest navy in the world to patrol a small ocean. You merely want control over a sovereign country whose ideology you do not agree with."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,1 point,Sun May 3 22:23:44 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand me, I'd rather close Guantanamo Bay than a base in say, Afghanistan or Germany since there is no threat/reason to have a base there. It's just strategic is all."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,utdude999,3,Sun May 3 23:12:55 2015 UTC,"Well I see bases in our allies countries as a show of distrust. They don't have any here, why should we? What makes us better?"
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,1 point,Sun May 3 23:31:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe you do but if the countries we have bases in saw it that way, we'd just simply not have a base there."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Mentitor,1 point,Sun May 3 23:34:40 2015 UTC,"Actually, the situation is 100% tactical.  We have bases in Germany because a) we established them after WW2, b) we used them in the Cold War and c) Germany enjoys having our bases there. It is a great reason why so many German products were introduced to the states originally; free samples were given to soldiers of products like Adidas.  More importantly, if a casualty in Afghanistan needs the most advanced surgery possible, Germany is a much shorter flight. Germans are employed on American military bases.  As to your final point, why would they have them here? Unless a British soldier is being medevacd out of, say, Mexico, it would make zero sense to have us as a midway point.  It's not a show of distrust. If our military bases in another country were there to tamp down on insurrection, you would definitely be able to notice. They are facilities, much like embassies, that are of mutual benefit; I spent time on an American military base near Kaiserslautern where I enjoyed both German and American company and saw a great deal of cooperation, friendship, camaraderie, etc."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,SomeRealShit,2,Sun May 3 23:38:13 2015 UTC,"Reasons 1 and 2 shouldn't apply today. The ""red threat"" is gone and Germany is safe and reunited. It's also completely able of protecting itself now, more than any other European country I'd say. And why couldn't we fly patients to one of their bases? If they're such good allies, they'd allow that without hesitation and it's a much less interventionist way of dealing with our allies."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,bluefisch200,1 point,Mon May 4 07:48:52 2015 UTC,"I was saying, for reasons 1 and 2, that was why we had them. Military bases on allied soil are definitely not a symbol of interventionist foreign policy; they offer no threat or chance of suppression of the citizens there. Germans work on these bases as well...they're not something that should be focused on in this bill. It doesn't save us money or effort to fly to their bases, and despite NATO establishing a great deal of ammunition standards, there are still differences in equipment that make treating one's own soldiers easier."

The formidable Venezuelan marines? 500 miles is nothing in a relatively peaceful sector of this world. An American battleship could reach Guantanamo from Miami in 6 hours or so. Considering our extensive intelligence agency, any attack that would call for such a response could be dealt with without trouble."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,Smitty9913,1 point,Tue May 5 03:45:33 2015 UTC,"Mr. Congressman,  When considering military defense, one does not just include the respective countries' militaries, but any forces that could be launched from this location. Our extensive intelligence agency, of which I have no oversight, has certainly been wrong before.  Also, it does not have to be a naval attack or a marine landing. Airstrikes can be launched from within this distance, or a submarine can launch a missile from much further away. Smaller vessels can traverse such an area relatively quickly, and could deposit enemy insurgents (say, cartel members?) without any forewarning, given our lack of radar or naval patrol based out of Gitmo, if it were to be closed.  Modern military tactics are not exclusive to ships and landing parties, and 6 hours is a matter of weeks in the modern military age.  That said, closing Guantanamo Bay is relatively harmless and I would not advocate strongly for it staying open. I was just elaborating on the more advanced tactics that could leave America open for attack."

ModelUSGov,34rcvo,ben1204,1 point,Mon May 4 08:01:37 2015 UTC,I would rather reply.  My position is pretty simple:   Even though Russia is one of the superpowers on earth and the US has interests in the European market they are an independent continent and can handle their problems on their own. In today's world military aggression is the wrong way. The NATO is one big war machine and should not be involved into this conflict. Some NATO generals hope for a war to occur. Economic sanctions are the solution and this is the only way the US should (if ever) be involved into this.

I've also aided analyzing data and troop movement, while planning strategies and making recommendations for action, in the Middle East.   2) why would you consider the U.S. Armed Forces a ""terrorist organization?"" I can see from your flair that you hold a specific political viewpoint, and can perhaps hypothesize as to some of your arguments, but, in comparison to ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and other groups (many non-Middle-Eastern, even domestic, but it's very early in the morning so I'm not on point exactly), would you label us among the worst/largest? And if so, what actions of ours contribute to that signification?"
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,1 point,Tue May 5 14:46:47 2015 UTC,Terrorism can be described as:    the use of violent acts to frighten the people in an area as a way of trying to achieve a political goal the systematic use of terror especially as a means of coercion   If you don't believe the U.S. military is not a terrorist organization by these definitions then perhaps you need to study history more.   Do I believe they are so brutal as groups such as Al-Qaeda or ISIS? Hell no. But throughout history they have done more damage then ISIS could even dream of. If I was a member of ISIS I would be jealous of the U.S. military's ability to ruin lives of innocents.
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,TheRealRailguy,2,Sun May 10 10:03:43 2015 UTC,"I think that cutting the military is a necessary solution if you're serious about cutting our debt, however, I think a few edits should be made to this bill.  I think people are overestimating how much of a cut 50% would be...the US could slash defense in half, and still have more defense funding than all our Western European allies, Australia, Japan, etc, combined. And many times more than Russia and China.  That being said....from what areas specifically do you plan to cut? I think that's important to clarify.  As with foreign bases, I see no need to have bases in Germany and Italy. That being said, what about bases in high risk areas, like Qatar, where there is regional instability?  With the War in Afghanistan winding down a bit, spending already may be going down a little. So maybe reduce it by 2 or 3 percent in the first year, and if that works, do 5 or so the next year."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,5,Mon May 18 12:24:38 2015 UTC,"To slash it down 50%, which would, if we take the current figures of $500 billion, take us down to $250 billion dollars, not adjusted for inflation. China is currently at $216 billion a year and climbing. We will be going down, they will be going up, and they have the financial resources to do it.   Not only that, but this government has not provided a full list of what is going to be cut. There is no way closing bases is going to give them the amount they want cut, so we have to ask what is going to be cut. Well the obvious things are programs and equipment. So now not only is the USA going to fall behind the world technologically, but we are going to put millions of Americans out of work. I do not see a section in this act that would help these people. This bill is a no go. Sure there is fat to be trimmed, but not 50%, and not without the government providing a detailed list of how they plan on doing it, and how many people they plan to put out of work."
ModelUSGov,34rcvo,kingofquave,3,Mon May 4 04:04:03 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with you, my friend. Cutting it by 50% will of course mean reducing inefficiencies, but also less research, less personnel and less capabilities. Our army is partially so expensive because we hold a technological edge and are - depending on the division and machine - years ahead of other nations. This technological edge is critical for our position and must not be forfeited.  You also have to take the different purchasing power parity in account. China's budget may be smaller, but things are cheaper over there compared to our homeland. So don't just look at the nominal budgets.  To the bases in high-risk areas; we have a naval base in Bahrain, use an airfield in Qatar, and I am pretty sure we have more facilities in this specific high-risk region (e.g. Jordan, Israel,...). Italy has a geostrategically good location, it's not far away from the middle east, the Suez channel and the Atlantic Ocean. Germany hosts our largest military base overseas, we invested tons of money in it, I see no reason why to abandon it.  Yes, we could reduce spending by a few percent, depending on the state of the world. But let's not hammer a continuing reduction of 5% every year into stone if we can't foresee the future."

In addition to the communal economy, consensus decision-making, non-hierarchical structures and ecological living have become important core principles for many communes. Andrew Jacobs of The New York Times wrote that, contrary to popular misconceptions, ""most communes of the '90s are not free-love refuges for flower children, but well-ordered, financially solvent cooperatives where pragmatics, not psychedelics, rule the day.""

I have no qualms with the introduction of a democratic workplace business structure category for the IRS, however, we should not be giving twenty percent tax credits strictly based on business models.   There have been no reports presented before this Congress showing the quantifiable benefits of such a move. We, as a country of hard working, entrepreneurial-minded individuals should be equally incentivizing the creation of all business, regardless of their structure. It would be disastrous for our revenue - which we use for social programs, education, and the like - to suddenly have a number of our small businesses become cooperatives and take advantage of this tax credit.   Again, I implore you all to say no to this bill until its authors are willing to present reputable evidence that show it would be beneficial to this country."

Simply stating it would certainly improve the lives of Americans does not make it so.    For example, in order to compete with a newly formed cooperative due to them receiving a drastic tax cut, I may either outsource more of my labor, or flat-out lay off some of my employees. This bill seems to assume that with this incentive, businesses will flock to the democratic workplace model. If that doesn't occur, in what way would that action be beneficial for the affected parties?"
ModelUSGov,34pykp,cameronc65,8,Sun May 3 22:42:05 2015 UTC,"Here. are. some articles about the economic and societal benefits of Workplace Democracy.  To summarize, not only does employee production go up, but so does mental health, satisfaction, and meaning. Additionally, the democratic nature of the workplace spills over into the civic mindedness of the people and their participation in general.  It's difficult to see many downsides.  On top of that - if businesses don't flock to the Democratic Workplace model than other business structures have nothing to worry about in terms of competition. If they do, than we have a large swath of businesses that are receiving tax breaks, bettering the lives of their employees, practicing democracy, and increasing the civic mindedness of our society."
ModelUSGov,34pykp,Mentitor,2,Sun May 3 23:00:26 2015 UTC,"Not to doubt your claims, Representative, but your first link contradicts your own statement regarding civil participation. Mind you, I've only read 6 pages in, but here are Edward Greenberg's findings:   My own research on this question shows mixed and weak results. In a study comparing workers in U.S. producer cooperative firms—where worker/owners run all the affairs of the company-- with workers in closely matched conventional firms in the wood products industry in the Pacific Northwest, I reported the following: (Greenberg 1986)  • Workers in democratically-run producer cooperatives were no more politically efficacious than workers in conventional firms.  • Workers in democratically-run producer cooperatives were slightly more likely to be involved in community affairs (contacted a public official, written a letter to the editor, or worked with others to solve some community problem) and in attending government meetings and hearings than workers in conventional firms (though levels of involvement for both groups was extremely low), but they were no more likely to participate in election campaigns or vote.  • In a supplemental panel survey of the same respondents done five years after the first survey, workers in the co-ops were more likely than workers in the conventional firms to be more involved in campaign activities, community affairs, and attending meetings (though not on voting), though overall levels of activity in all areas of political participation were extremely low for both groups.  • Perhaps most striking of all, workers in the more democratic producer cooperatives were significantly more likely than workers in conventional firms to describe their involvement in politics in terms of self-interest rather than in terms of the general good, suggesting that the slight gain in participation from workplace cooperation did not lead to gains in civic-mindedness. Interestingly, co-op workers became less civic minded over time, while conventional workers did not change at all on this dimension.  • In a follow-up study done 10 years later comparing workers in democratically-run firms (producer cooperatives and employee-stock ownership firms) with workers in matched conventional union and non-union firms in the wood products industry, my colleagues and I were rather startled to discover that workers in the more democratically-run firms were much less likely than workers in conventional firms to be active in politics (voting, campaign activities, community involvement). The surprising result, we found, could not be explained by a drop off in participation in the democratically-run firms but seemed best explained by the economic troubles these firms were experiencing at the time. (Greenberg, Grunberg et al. 1996)  So where does this leave us on the question of the potency of participation in decisionmaking in the workplace for encouraging positive spillovers on democratic citizenship? One must conclude, I believe, that while much has been made about this dynamic in the theoretical literature, the empirical evidence for its existence is not strong. The empirical evidence suggests either mixed outcomes---spillover occurs in some cases and settings and not others—or fairly modest spillover effects."
ModelUSGov,34pykp,IBiteYou,5,Sun May 3 23:09:51 2015 UTC,"Yes - there is not a complete consensus. The other two papers and articles claim the opposite of this.   Regardless, some spillover, as the first study concludes, does happen.    It appears, then, that schemes for participatory democracy in work organizations are still worth pursuing. Employees and firms would be best served, however, given the evidence, if proponents would make more modest claims about the spillover benefits of such arrangements."

ModelUSGov,34pykp,cameronc65,8,Sun May 3 19:32:52 2015 UTC,"This seems to, once again, give an exclusive tax position to communized businesses (now operating as C-corps).   Is it not obvious to you that the purpose of this legislation is to encourage the establishment of Democratic Workplaces? Of course it contains incentives!"
ModelUSGov,34pykp,IBiteYou,1 point,Sun May 3 21:02:31 2015 UTC,I do not favor providing exclusive benefits to communized businesses that other businesses will not get.  I am asking for a clarification.
ModelUSGov,34pykp,cameronc65,9,Sun May 3 21:39:20 2015 UTC,"The other types of businesses (S-Corp, C-Corp, LLC's, Coops, etc) all receive certain types of incentives and benefits that others do not receive."
ModelUSGov,34pykp,IBiteYou,4,Sun May 3 21:46:51 2015 UTC,Are you willing to give non-communized c-corps the tax break that you want to provide to communized c-corps?
ModelUSGov,34pykp,cameronc65,8,Sun May 3 21:55:43 2015 UTC,"No - because Democratic Workplaces are a different type of business structure than C-Corps and therefore have different incentives, and drawbacks, for creating a business of that structure."
ModelUSGov,34pykp,rangerheart0,2,Sun May 3 21:58:39 2015 UTC,So... I'm correct.  Part of your bill is a falsehood.   SUBSECTION 3: A Democratic Workplace will be taxed like a C Corporation.   It will not.  A communized workplace will get special tax breaks that other businesses will be denied.
ModelUSGov,34pykp,IBiteYou,7,Sun May 3 22:05:14 2015 UTC,"I feel like you need to read about business structures. Here: http://www.bizfilings.com/learn/taxes-business-types.aspx  Additionally, you should read about tax incentives. Here: http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Business-Tax-Credits  So, yes a Democratic Workplace will receive a credit that other businesses will not receive. But, many types of businesses receive tax incentives for what they produce, how they produce, and how they structure their business. This is not some unprecedented thing. We are incentivizng the Democratic (proper) treatment of employees, just like we incentivize the proper treatment of the environment (for example)."
ModelUSGov,34pykp,rangerheart0,1 point,Sun May 3 22:25:35 2015 UTC,I feel like maybe you should stop implying that I don't know what is going on with your legislation.  You are granting communized businesses a tax break that other businesses will not get.  I oppose the inequal treatment you are advocating.
ModelUSGov,34pykp,rangerheart0,9,Sun May 3 22:29:15 2015 UTC,"Then you must disapprove of all tax incentives and differences.  We are incentivizing a democratic structure. They are receiving a credit for this, yes. But many other businesses receive tax breaks for various other things. This is not unequal treatment unless all tax differences, breaks, or otherwise are unequal as well."
ModelUSGov,34pykp,HipsterDios,6,Sun May 3 22:35:22 2015 UTC,"That isn't how a tax credit works. I am taxed like you, but we might pay different taxes cause one of us might have kids, donate to charity, have solar panels, be low income. That doesn't mean we aren't taxed the same, we are just eligible for different tax credits which allows us to subtract different amounts from our federal taxes."
ModelUSGov,34pykp,rangerheart0,1 point,Sun May 3 22:22:35 2015 UTC,""" tax breaks ""  A tax credit is VERY MUCH a tax break."
ModelUSGov,34pykp,IBiteYou,6,Sun May 3 22:31:38 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it wasn't a tax break. I agree this bill will afford ""communized"" businesses tax breaks that other businesses will not be eligible for. However that doesn't change the fact that businesses registered as a democratic workplace will be taxed like a c corporation with the exception of a 20% tax credit.   The bill is very clear that businesses registered under this legislation will receive a tax break. Those that do not will not receive a tax break. In the same way that nonprofit businesses that register under 5013c will be tax exempt, those that do not register as a 501c3, even if they are a nonprofit will not be tax exempt."
ModelUSGov,34pykp,cameronc65,5,Sun May 3 22:43:48 2015 UTC,"If I understand it correctly it is saying that ""communized"" (or more accurately cooperative or even collectivized) businesses are taxed using the same rates as a c corp not that they are a c corp. So a c corp would not get this tax credit unless they meet the guidelines set in Section 3."
ModelUSGov,34pykp,IBiteYou,2,Sun May 3 21:00:15 2015 UTC,You don't think a 20% credit is a little steep?
ModelUSGov,34pykp,cameronc65,6,Sun May 3 21:34:06 2015 UTC,I personally don't think it is steep enough. However given the current makeup of congress we are making certain compromises within the bill in order to work better with everyone.
ModelUSGov,34pykp,IBiteYou,1 point,Sun May 3 22:19:26 2015 UTC,"Then the bill does not address the concerns I had with the first iteration.   are taxed using the same rates as a c corp not that they are a c corp   Only not really, because only communized businesses would get the tax credit."
ModelUSGov,34pykp,rangerheart0,3,Sun May 3 21:40:39 2015 UTC,It addresses the bureaucracy part doesn't it?
ModelUSGov,34pykp,IBiteYou,1 point,Sun May 3 21:47:19 2015 UTC,It addresses that... but that was not my only concern.  My concern was that we would be rewarding communized businesses in a non-democratic fashion by giving them tax breaks that other businesses would be denied.
ModelUSGov,34pykp,rangerheart0,3,Sun May 3 21:54:05 2015 UTC,non-democratic fashion   In what way is incentivizing certain behavior non-democratic?
ModelUSGov,34pykp,cameronc65,1 point,Sun May 3 21:57:06 2015 UTC,"Democratic:  ""pertaining to or characterized by the principle of political or social equality for all:""  For all.  This provides a ""some are more equal than others"" tax break to communized businesses that will not be available to other c-corps."
ModelUSGov,34pykp,IBiteYou,3,Sun May 3 22:08:39 2015 UTC,Do you believe that we should tax nonproftits the same as regular corporations or do you believe that no businesses should pay taxes at all? Otherwise by your logic it would be undemocratic that nonprofits be tax exempt and normal businesses not be tax exempt?
ModelUSGov,34pykp,cameronc65,1 point,Sun May 3 22:25:00 2015 UTC,"SUBSECTION 3: A Democratic Workplace will be taxed like a C Corporation.   Had you stopped here, this legislation would likely have my vote."

ModelUSGov,34q4g6,cameronc65,2,Sun May 3 21:46:57 2015 UTC,Hopefully the executive branch will act on the potential separation of powers issue with bill 34.
ModelUSGov,34q4g6,oughton42,3,Sun May 3 21:33:21 2015 UTC,What's the issue? I think I missed that discussion.
ModelUSGov,34q4g6,cameronc65,0,Sun May 3 21:49:24 2015 UTC,"There is some concern that the Legislature does not have the ability to recognize a country; rather, that is the job of the President -- the United States' chief Diplomat -- and the Executive Branch.

ModelUSGov,34q4g6,bluefisch200,2,Sun May 3 22:26:40 2015 UTC,"one that hasn't really been answered yet.   And just to clarify, not something that the proposers of the bill haven't answered, but something that the US Supreme Court hasn't addressed in the last 200 years, either.  Separation of powers is a sticky issue in Washington DC."
ModelUSGov,34q4g6,oughton42,2,Sun May 3 22:18:57 2015 UTC,Is that true? If so that would be wrong and should be changed. By having the ability to recognize other countries (or not do so) the President could act without support from the Legislature.  I would even go that far (and that is entirely my opinion) and strip those powers from the president. That belongs into the hands of the Legislature.
ModelUSGov,34q4g6,schultejt,0,Mon May 4 09:54:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, it has historically been considered the President's job to handle all foreign affairs (with some exceptions, like declaring war); simply look at the controversy about Congress sending that letter to Iran recently."
ModelUSGov,34q4g6,Smitty9913,2,Mon May 4 12:42:59 2015 UTC,"Bill 33 did in fact pass. You only need a majority of votes cast, rather than a majority of the house."
ModelUSGov,34q4g6,Smitty9913,3,Mon May 4 02:18:31 2015 UTC,"I have had to post this a couple times before but trust me when I say the bill did not pass.  For a bill to be adopted it needs to receive a majority vote based on the quorum present in the Chamber. We have 17 Representatives, which for our purposes is our quorum. Therefore 9 votes are required for any measure to be adopted, even with abstentions and non-voting members."
ModelUSGov,34q4g6,schultejt,3,Mon May 4 14:03:31 2015 UTC,Can you explain that further? And anyways we are not following it exactly anyways.
ModelUSGov,34q4g6,schultejt,2,Mon May 4 15:50:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, when the House is in session for a vote to carry it requires a majority of members present in the established quorum. Our established quorum, or the number of Representatives present when the previous question is ordered is 17, a majority would then be 9.   Without 9 votes in favor of a motion in the House it will not carry because a true majority of the House did not approve the bill.   As for following it exactly, obviously no; however, this voting method is accurate and makes sense, otherwise a bill could in theory pass with only 1 vote in favor if no other member voted."
ModelUSGov,34q4g6,schultejt,3,Mon May 4 15:54:02 2015 UTC,Ok I see
ModelUSGov,34q4g6,cameronc65,3,Mon May 4 15:58:53 2015 UTC,"It is a shame though that two members did not cast a vote on the measure, perhaps with their support it may have carried."
ModelUSGov,34q4g6,schultejt,1 point,Mon May 4 15:59:44 2015 UTC,"But 17 wasn't the quorum, 15 was. Two of the representatives were not in the chamber as the got took place. Therefore the quorum would be 15 making 8 a majority"
ModelUSGov,34q4g6,houinator,2,Mon May 4 16:39:06 2015 UTC,"For our purposes the quorum is always established at the number of Representatives that can vote, which is 17. To change the quorum we would have to have a roll call mechanism separate from the vote itself, which is not possible for us to do.   For example, let's say that only one vote is cast; the other members missed the vote. Without the true majority requirement we have in place that bill would be passed and would certainly not be representative of the House.   So the quorum majority requirement is in place, which is as follows:    For a bill to pass it must receive a majority of the quorum of the House, and,  Because we have no roll call mechanism the quorum of the House will always be the number of Representatives eligible to vote.    I completely understand the frustration, but if we set the quorum at the members who vote a bill could carry which is not representative of the House of Representatives."
ModelUSGov,34j13i,SeptimusSette,11,Fri May 1 15:50:27 2015 UTC,"While I cannot vote on this issue due to not being a House Representative, I'd like to bring up an issue with Section Five.    ""(5) STATES its support for policies pursuant to the reunification of the peninsula under the authority of the Republic of Korea.""   This completely ignores the stark contrast between the two nations on the Korean peninsula at this point in time, as well as economic impacts for both Koreas. Due to the divide in Korea since 1945, the cultures of the DPRK and Republic of Korea have become quite different due to differing material and social conditions. Additionally, absorbing the DPRK would likely lead to negative impacts on the South Korean economy.   Korean reunification is not such a simple issue, and I advise the House to take this into account."
ModelUSGov,34j13i,HammerAndPotato,6,Fri May 1 16:04:34 2015 UTC,"I, unfortunately, am going to hijack this comment to elaborate on an important point the Vice President has made:  In East and West Germany in 1990, the year of Reunification (Deutsche Wiedervereinigung), there was a less extreme material, social, and cultural divide between the two separate states, as a) they were more able to communicate, b) they had been a unified country with notable regional influence for many years beforehand, among other reasons. Reunification was heralded by almost all Germans as the first true step towards their country's recovery from the Second World War.  However, even the loudest protestors in the GDR (German Democratic Republic, or East Germany) noted a cultural phenomenon so bizarre, the Germans invented a word for it. (As they do fairly often.) They called it Ostalgie, a portmanteau of the German words for East (Ost) and Nostalgia (Nostalgie).   The common definition is similar to nostalgia, but nostalgia generally refers to looking back fondly on memories that one might perhaps wish to revisit. The difference between Nostalgie and Ostalgie was that many former East Germans who experienced the latter recognized that they did not want to revisit their years in the GDR and that they were happier now in unified Germany; yet they could not stop feeling as if they had lost something important to them. Some identified specific things for which they were ""nostalgic,"" and many of them realized/explained that these things were negative and that they would prefer not to return to them.  It's a cultural phenomenon that was not dangerous, but interesting. However, the S. and N. Korea divide is magnitudes larger than the former East and West Germany, not just in culture and politics but in everything from access to electricity and clean water to the right to email somebody in 'X' country. The shock could be enormous, and the consequences, if any, are completely unknown. Reunification between South and North Korea may be ideal in terms of improving life for the oppressed North Koreans, who certainly do not deserve their suffering under the Kim regime, but it may not be the best solution (in the short term) for the stability of the ""New Korea.""  One of many sources:  '(N)Ostalgie' for the present: Memory, longing, and East German things  Note: An excellent film called, ""Goodbye, Lenin!"" covers this topic.  Edit/P.S.: I wrote a year-end paper on this in graduate school, so if anybody is a masochist I have a copy on my computer. :D"
ModelUSGov,34j13i,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,2,Sat May 2 09:28:17 2015 UTC,"Depends. How long is the paper, and how much does it deal with ""Goodbye, Lenin!""?"
ModelUSGov,34j13i,evanb_,3,Sun May 3 03:49:09 2015 UTC,"Too many pages, and a paragraph."
ModelUSGov,34j13i,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,2,Sun May 3 18:55:39 2015 UTC,"You are correct madam Vice President. Re-unification can not and should not be done in an overnight manner.   However, with proper global financial support, I believe that over the course of 12-24 months, the majority of the people of the DPRK could be well on the way to full integration into South Korean life (I assume things like electricity, the internet, proper medical care and access to food and water will be a shock at first).   A full plan would need to be drawn up, with the South Korean government taking the lead (as the nation which will be absorbing the the land and inheriting the people) and with the full support of the global community it can and will be done."
ModelUSGov,34j13i,Canadianman22,6,Fri May 1 18:37:45 2015 UTC,"That doesn't take into account cultural differences, though. By this point in time, the North and the South have developed different national identities and whatnot. It's like East and West Germany but with a much bigger gap.   In this case, we can't just go and shut the DPRK down immediately. We should take a firm stance against the human rights abuses in the DPRK, but time towards reunification would be better spent trying to cooperate with the DPRK. Have them recognize their mistakes and learn from it. End the embargo, allow US economic power to seep in, etc.   I don't even necessarily agree with the bill at hand, but if we were to theoretically try to tear down the Kims we could do it in a less iron fisted way."
ModelUSGov,34j13i,HammerAndPotato,6,Fri May 1 19:10:12 2015 UTC,"Ms. Vice President, you make several excellent points. I would like to tack on that the self-determination of the North Koreans is not something that we as the US government can cast aside; they are the first step to allowing anything in their country. (One the Kim regime is out of power and a representative government established.) I think opening borders would be a good first step; this would not only shine a light into the DPRK for the world to see more publicly, but would also serve as a sort of ""poll"" to see how many citizens want out."
ModelUSGov,34j13i,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,2,Sat May 2 09:11:24 2015 UTC,That's a very logical statement that I'm perfectly fine with.
ModelUSGov,34j13i,HammerAndPotato,3,Sat May 2 10:22:02 2015 UTC,"Madam Vice President, the reason I ask is that before I debate an issue such as this, I prefer to know which side of the fence the person I am debating an issue with stands on.   It is not an unfair question, especially when someone sits in the second highest office in the land. The American people have the right to know where there elected officials stand on such an important issue."
ModelUSGov,34j13i,Canadianman22,4,Fri May 1 23:29:40 2015 UTC,"The DPRK has a right to national self-determination.  I don't support Juche, I don't support the Kims.  However, we need to take into account the differing social and political landscapes on the Korean peninsula, as well as what events occurred to create said landscapes."
ModelUSGov,34j13i,HammerAndPotato,1 point,Sat May 2 07:00:43 2015 UTC,"I would agree with you about the people of the DPRK having the right to self determination if they were actually given the right to free and open elections. They are not. They are essentially hostages under the Kim dictatorship.   Anyone who manages to escape, the North Korean government punishes up to 3 generations of that persons family, and not just direct family, but people they are barely related. There are verified stories of the people not even knowing they are related to the person who escaped, and only finding out when they are being hauled off to the labor camps.  I am curious how you think people under these conditions are in any shape to decide their future, when they do not even have the freedom to make a phone call outside of North Korea."
ModelUSGov,34j13i,Canadianman22,4,Sat May 2 13:25:10 2015 UTC,Government policy is completely irrelevant to national identity. You can't just crush North Korea because they're oppressive.
ModelUSGov,34j13i,HammerAndPotato,2,Sat May 2 17:18:54 2015 UTC,"Madam Vice President, I think it would be best for you to clarify your personal opinion on the DPRK and their regime before we continue with any further discussion."
ModelUSGov,34j13i,Canadianman22,2,Fri May 1 19:19:33 2015 UTC,"My personal thoughts on the DPRK, whatever they may be, are irrelevant to the discussion at hand. We're looking at Section 5 of the bill and how that is to be played out, should the bill be passed.  Due to the structure of Congress, I can say with relative certainty that the bill will pass.  In this case, we need to look at whether or not Section 5 should stay as a part of the bill and if it is to stay within the bill how we will pursue it. That is the discussion. Not my thoughts on the DPRK, and not yours, either."
ModelUSGov,34j13i,HammerAndPotato,4,Fri May 1 21:19:13 2015 UTC,"Are you a North Korean supporter? If so, people do you see what you get when you elect communists?"

ModelUSGov,34j13i,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,2,Sat May 2 09:08:45 2015 UTC,"The dictator of North Korea would never allow this. It would be the end of North Korea. When the people see things like working infrastructure, working hospitals, abundance of food, the freedom to say and do what you want, to use a computer freely etc, no one would want to go back to North Korea.   This goes against the iron fist and control the Kim dynasty is going for. They want to control every aspect of every persons lives. From the news they get, to what they can say. The fact this regime puts up to 3 generations of a persons family in labor camps when someone escapes shows just how afraid they are of people learning the real truth about North Korea."

Saudi Arabia: No rights for women.  Eritrea: An almost fantastical culture where a multi-gendered crowd protested against a law banning female genital mutilation.  So why Israel, when, in fact, thousands of Eritreans have fled to Israel for expatriation?"
ModelUSGov,34j13i,bleepbloop12345,8,Sat May 2 09:03:32 2015 UTC,"Israel is an apartheid state presiding over a decades long brutal military occupation. It has flagrantly broken international law in regard to the settlements, committed war crimes, used chemical weapons against a civilian population and routinely uses excessive force to murder thousands of Palestinian civilians."
ModelUSGov,34j13i,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,3,Sat May 2 11:34:51 2015 UTC,"Interesting use of ""apartheid,"" but that's not a major contention here.  Are war crimes also indiscriminately launching tens of thousands of rockets at the State of Israel, some of which were intentionally aimed as hospitals, schools, or residential areas, but most of which were just aimed towards West Jerusalem, where there is large population density and good ""terror value per rocket.""  White phosphorous is not a chemical weapon. I am certainly willing to explain why exactly it is not, but the rest of your comment is more specific.  International law, actually, did not prohibit, but rather allowed for the creation of kibbutzes, or the first settlements that Israel established in that area. Some of the characteristics of those areas in which kibbutz were established include: no cities, towns, or residents, an isolated village where the Israeli settlement was intentionally placed far away, and other attempts to be ""unobtrusive,"" which I guess counts only for politeness, but unless you're counting international law circa 2015 and applying it to Israeli settlement 1930-1952, no international laws were broken. This region where the settlements were established happened to have no currency, flag, language, government, post, police, and other things you would associate with a sovereign land, etc.   A few points you made are under the same sort of umbrella of ""routinely using excessive force to murder thousands of Palestinian civilians."" However, Israeli Jews are targeted indiscriminately as an accepted practice. When I say ""accepted practice"" I don't mean ""it happens so long it may as well be,"" I mean ""it's the Palestinian extremists' almost exclusive strategy.""   For example, in Operation Protective Edge, the most recent major conflict, the first aggression was the kidnapping of three Israeli teenagers, dragging them through a tunnel into friendlier territory, beheading them, and spreading the video. This was, of course, the end of along ceasefire that began in November 2012 and ended with the kidnappings/murders on June 12th, 2014. As is their modus operandi, Hamas militants alone fired an average of 36 unguided rockets at Israel per month, every month of this ceasefire.   In the early days of Protective Edge, Israel limited itself mainly to border excursions where it secured smaller settlements or suspected militant homes near the border. This escalated when a tunnel being dug into Israel from Khan Younis, a large Palestinian city, collapsed due to improper storing ammunition; this ammunition was not exclusively small-arms munitions, but was primarily rockets, grenades geared for an RPG, and a variety of bombs. 32 Hamas militants were killed, though the organization claimed it was an airstrike by Israelis that killed their men, and retaliated by firing over 7,000 rockets over the next 2 and a half months. (The interesting part of that story is that Hamas knowingly admitted to having their soldiers dig a tunnel into Israel and bring as many explosives as possible...)  That's just the beginning of the conflict, but, as I just attempted to illustrate, Israel is in a version of the American Army in Fallujah, or Vietnam: fighting an enemy they can't identify, that could be next to them, and you can't trust even a physical barrier. This time, however, ""an enemy"" is 5-7 countries going full speed ahead at a sign of weakness. Israel's response is seen as excessive by many because it is unusual; it understands (and has published openly) the Dahiya Doctrine, which quotes:   In such cases, Israel again will not be able to limit its response to actions whose severity is seemingly proportionate to an isolated incident. Rather, it will have to respond disproportionately in order to make it abundantly clear that the State of Israel will accept no attempt to disrupt the calm currently prevailing along its borders....such force is necessary to prevent a war of attrition.   Undoubtedly cold, and some would argue impractical, but it is, inarguably, effective. Israel, surrounded on three sides by enemies (including a bonus enemy in its own country) and on the fourth by the Mediterranean, is in the most vulnerable tactical position in the world. When they are, as you say (incorrectly), ""using excessive force to murder thousands of Palestinian citizens,"" they are utilizing the tactics that have not only kept them alive and functioning in their position, but also allowed them to become the most advanced nation in the region, a major economy, a major trading partner to the US and most of Europe, and allowed them to field the best trained, most technologically advanced, and most modern army in the world.

ModelUSGov,34j13i,bleepbloop12345,4,Sat May 2 13:04:51 2015 UTC,"Interesting use of ""apartheid,"" but that's not a major contention here.   Can I take that to mean that you don't actually disagree with my characterisation of Israel as an apartheid state?    Are war crimes also indiscriminately launching tens of thousands of rockets at the State of Israel...   Yes. I don't support Hamas and I don't want to apologise for Hamas. But their actions do not excuse Israel's in any way. Please don't try and use whataboutism to apologise for the crimes of Israel.    White phosphorous is not a chemical weapon. I am certainly willing to explain why exactly it is not, but the rest of your comment is more specific.   I'm no expert on chemical weapons, but according to this site there is certainly a case to make that white phosphorous falls under the terms of the 1992 Chemical Weapons Convention. Even if we accept that it is not a chemical weapon then its use was still patently a war crime.    International law, actually, did not prohibit, but rather allowed for the creation of kibbutzes, or the first settlements that Israel established in that area...   Again, I agree with you here. I'm talking about the creation of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which started in 1967. They clearly and flagrantly breach multiple international laws, including the Forth Geneva Convention and the Hague Regulations.   Your next couple of paragraphs are yet more whataboutism. We're having a debate about the actions of the Israeli state, and whether or not those actions necessitate them being condemned by the US. If you want to debate Hamas then sure, we can do that another time, but let's try to stick to the point here.   That's just the beginning of the conflict   Well, you said it yourself. You seem very happy to talk about the beginning, but perhaps we should focus on the bit where they murdered 3,000 civilians.   I'm quite familiar with the Dahiya Doctrine, and I think it's absurd. When Israel attacks Gaza and the West Bank they are not attacking a sophisticated military opponent that could easily destroy them given the chance. They're attacking a near defenseless civilian population. A group of people trapped in a squalid open air prison, who have are themselves under constant threat from an enemy that they cannot see coming and that could utterly destroy them at any moment. The horror that Israel faces pales in comparison; around 8 civilians were killed during Operation Protective Edge, an almost insignificant amount compared to the Palestinian dead.   If Israel is attacked by Egypt or Iran then sure, I would agree that they would be entitled to respond in an over the top manner to ensure that other countries do not take that as an invitation to attack. But the wide-scale murder of civilians during Protective Edge had absolutely nothing to do with that. It came not as a response to the thread of an invasion or an attack, but because one Israeli citizen was murdered and a few tunnels were built. Reacting on such a vastly excessive scale will not prevent future attacks but encourage them.    and allowed them to field the best trained, most technologically advanced, and most modern army in the world.   Of course, I suppose the $30 billion in aid from the US has helped.   Sorry for the novel. This is a personal topic that I've happened to hear a lot about these days.   It's cool, defending Israel is basically the MO of the Democratic Party."

I won't bother replying to your first point because I'm sure it will come up in more detail in your thorough reply. Regarding your second, were you not in the Democratic Party before?"
ModelUSGov,34j13i,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,1 point,Sun May 10 21:27:39 2015 UTC,"Decided to write a new comment. I was indeed in the Democratic Party, but shortly before the most recent Presidential election.  Anyway, it's clear that you're very informed on the state of things in Israel. I'll try to go down your comment point-by-point and answer to the best of my ability.  My dismissal of ""apartheid"" was merely brushing it aside as semantics. I might not use the term, but the idea behind apartheid, to some extent, is present in Israel/Palestine today.  You are correct; I am guilty of several instances of whataboutism in my original reply. I'll try to formulate something a bit more logically sound this time around.  Israel's attacks on areas of Palestine, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and some areas in Lebanon most certainly can be characterized as ""indiscriminate,"" and you are right to say that nearly 3,000 civilians were killed, directly or indirectly, by Israeli military maneuvers in Protective Edge, and we haven't begun (or are able to) quantify losses of property, income, etc.  As an aside, I misspoke. White phosphorous is indeed, by definition, a chemical weapon, as it is a weapon that causes destruction using chemicals. I mistook your point for WP being a WMD, which it is not, under the DoD definition, as its delivery, its ability to be targeted, and its mechanism of aerial dissemination can be controlled to the point where it is not ""mass destruction."" There is, however, a distinction between types of chemical weapons-such as Sarin gas-and munitions such as WP, which are primarily (though not exclusively) used as ignition materials for smoke bombs. Two IDF officers were brought forward and charged with firing artillery shells loaded with WP into civilian areas, but these were later reduced after finding that the artillery shells were loaded with only conventional explosives. Since the 2008-2009 Gaza Conflict, multiple groups (Amnesty International, a UN Fact Finding Mission, etc.) have come forward with varying reports of Israel's use of WP, but the UN ultimately ruled that its use was not a war crime, but that the IDF was reckless in ""determining its use in built-up areas."" The full Goldstone Report can be found here.  Modern artillery is still an inexact weapon, despite great advancements, and until the UN or a similar international tribunal disallows their use for smoke screens, it's nearly impossible to tell whether their use is legal or not.    Hamas/Hezbollah/PLA/etc. organizations are indeed guilty of indiscriminate terrorist attacks on Israel, and their actions do not justify the actions of the State of Israel. However, the problem exists not in ""he did this, so I did this,"" as I incorrectly attempted to explain, but in the basis of modern military theory.  Though military theory has evolved considerably over the past [enter desired number] of years, certain things remain the same: invaders require more troops than defenders, high ground is tactically advantageous, etc. In this case, the principle that is unchanged is that guerrilla warfare, or variations thereof, does not have a simple solution. (If it indeed has a solution.) One can observe this from the Russian partisans in World War II to the Vietcong, or to, in our example, the actions and strategies of Palestinian/Middle Eastern insurgent units against Israel.   The fact of the matter is: regardless of scale (you mentioned 8 Israeli civilians versus X Palestinians, or 1 IDF soldier versus X destruction), the IDF does not have a solution to stop or curtail the attacks against it besides the ones it is currently practicing. In fact, the IDF deserves at least some measure of praise for completely ""non-violent"" defenses to the rocket attacks, such as the Iron Dome, yet such young technology is not 100% accurate nor can it be deployed on a large enough scale. It also only stops one variety of attack: indiscriminate rockets.  The tactical situation in which Israel is placed is perilous, and, to the benefit of no one in the area, the conflict between the State of Israel and those various, non-government sanctioned (at least openly; Syria funds and arms large numbers of Palestinian Liberation Army fighters) has no end in sight, as it is based on not only disputes over land, but disputes over existence in fact. The IDF is, essentially, shit out of luck in any terms of strategy except that exemplified in actions such as Protective Edge. Whether or not it is effective is another point entirely, but attacks on Israel have slowed, statistically, over the past 10 years, so it is inarguably achieving some form of its purpose. Are the means by which this is achieved worth the actions necessary? I'm not entirely sure. My view on the morality of military action is skewed, as my work is completely on theory, armaments, and facts. I will also admit a certain bias that could be seen in my original reply: my wife is an Israeli national and served in both the IDF and a prominent intelligence organization within it. I've tried to curtail that in this post, but you'll have to give your opinion on my efforts' success.  My point about the IDF being highly-trained, technologically advanced, and well-equipped wasn't meant as a sideways way to praise the 30-some billion dollars of US aid given to the State of Israel; it was only a characterization of the current deployment. While the aid helped, or even saved the country, the IDF is now ""self-sufficient"" in the sense that it can import/export to be ""in the black"" in military spending, and it is far ahead of other countries in terms of weapons research towards mechanisms such as the Iron Dome. (The Patriot missile pales in comparison.)  Wrapping up, I hope I've avoided the whataboutism you correctly identified in my original reply; however, there is a fallacy in your reply as well, though this one may not be a formal logical fallacy but more a military theory fallacy: equating destruction and death with each other for justification of either.    The horror that Israel faces pales in comparison...   This is true in the sense that the average West Bank inhabitant is more likely to be killed by IDF actions than the average Israeli citizen is to be killed by foreign insurgents' actions, but though the two do not equate neither mathematically nor in a sense of justice, it does not excuse the response of Israel to the attacks. Could modern tactics or technology, or even changes in policy, reduce the indiscriminate/collateral damage done to Palestinians in operations such as Protective Edge while maintaining some form of success? Not currently.   Finally, I will cede the point to you regarding Israeli settlement on lands after 1967. My knowledge of expansionism by Israel ends before that point."

ModelUSGov,34j13i,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,2,Mon May 4 23:19:42 2015 UTC,"Very untrue. The US Prison System, while not the highest-rated penal system worldwide, is actually well-respected in many categories. (There are certainly criticisms to be made, but they should probably be directed at the justice system, who it could be argued imprisons too many people.)  Some positives about the system:  Excellent occupancy : maximum occupancy ratio. US Prisons are slightly overcrowded, at 101.4% capacity, but, sadly, that is good enough to be ranked 164th (out of 204) countries rated from high-to-low overpopulation percentage.  Our prison population system is dropping, and fewer repeat offenders are coming back into the system. There are many arguments to be made around social welfare/its possible effects on ""return criminals,"" but that's another argument entirely; the numbers do not lie, and they show fewer repeat criminals are being incarcerated every year, leading to a steady decline in prison population every year since 2006.  Finally, food quality, options, and quantity: prisoners surely do not eat the highest quality food, but there are respected options for allergies/preferences/religious tenets. A prison in Mississippi, the state with the worst-rated prisons and the most total prisoners, recently increased its budget just to provide completely kosher meals for a single Jewish prisoner. And, notably, there has not, since 1945, been a case of a prisoner starving to death due to lack of food.   Sorry for the novel. There was a debate about Baltimore and the National Guard being used as prison guards in now-overflowing prisons, and we got some research at work that was interesting on this topic."
ModelUSGov,34j13i,Danotto94,6,Sat May 2 08:57:50 2015 UTC,Don't private prisons want to maintain max capacity?
ModelUSGov,34j13i,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,2,Sat May 2 13:06:54 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, (this is the fucked up part, actually) when private security companies offer to take over personnel/maintenance/facilities of a state, city, or county's prisons, the government body almost always signs a contract (that is drawn up by both parties) with the private company to keep the prison between 80% and 100% full. Period.   There aren't specifications on how, but yes, they do want to maintain capacity, or near it, without going over. In a survey done by In the Public Interest, 41 out of 62 private prisons surveyed had some kind of minimum occupancy contracts. However, it is also in the companies' best interest to keep occupancy at our around max, but not over, because a) it costs more to house more people, b) facilities such as prisons have strict sanitation/facility/upkeep standards that are set by federal and state governments and would cripple not the state/county/city, but the company, in fines and licenses, not to mention the possibility of a private suit, and c) violence between prisoners is at a much higher risk the more tightly ""packed"" inmates are placed.  Long story short: it's mutually beneficial to maintain max capacity, but after only a little bit above max capacity it would have great potential to harm both the company and the government owning the prison.  Source   There are a few others I pulled for numbers, but that one just had the main lead."

ModelUSGov,34j13i,ehbrums1,4,Sun May 3 01:58:41 2015 UTC,I am all for this. No questions. North Korea has committed and is still committing horrible atrocities against its own people.
ModelUSGov,34j13i,Canadianman22,4,Sat May 2 01:16:16 2015 UTC,"A good resolution.  It is quite clear, to any reasonable individual, that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is anything but.  Instead, this regime is a tyrannical cult of personality, notorious for its brazen hypocrisy, lies, and standards of human rights.  How anyone who claims to be for the 'proleteriat' can support this cancer of a country and oppose this resolution, is truly beyond me."
ModelUSGov,34j13i,Eilanyan,9,Fri May 1 17:55:55 2015 UTC,"How anyone who claims to be for the 'proleteriat' can support this cancer of a country and oppose this resolution, is truly beyond me.   My opposition to it is more that I'm concerned for growing US imperialism in the region."
ModelUSGov,34j13i,Smitty9913,3,Fri May 1 18:19:51 2015 UTC,"I wholeheartedly oppose any US military operations against the DPRK, because, let's face it, they're a joke and of zero threat to the United States.  But, if we're going to consider condemnations and strong sanctions as ""imperialism"", then I still be in awe at any member's opposition to this bill."
ModelUSGov,34j13i,Smitty9913,6,Fri May 1 18:58:53 2015 UTC,My opposition to this bill is what it could open the door to. Not necessarily what's in it.
ModelUSGov,34j13i,Smitty9913,1 point,Fri May 1 19:00:26 2015 UTC,"I think any reunification of the Koreas under South Korean control should mean an end to us forces in the country. Right now they are there to protect an ally from its insane dictator neighbor, and when that neighbor is gone, so to should the US troops located in Korea."
ModelUSGov,34j13i,Smitty9913,5,Sun May 3 14:32:07 2015 UTC,"Sanctions affect the people not the regime far more so I worry about the impact, though not against the notion. My concern is who are we sanctioning and why, as we should very well sanction ourselves of the metric is human rights abuses."
ModelUSGov,34j13i,IBiteYou,6,Fri May 1 20:25:38 2015 UTC,"But, if we're going to consider condemnations and strong sanctions as ""imperialism"", then I still be in awe at any member's opposition to this bill.   Sanctions are imperialist; they undermine the economy of the DPRK and worsen the living standards. So are attempts to reunite Korea under the governance of the Republic of Korea. DPRK wants to reunite and have one Korea, but it wants this to be democratically done with the population choosing which party it wants in power."

Shame on you and Shame on The Green-left party for having this man be a Senator.   It's unbelievable that I oppose imperialist sanctions against the DPRK? Yeah, I find the sanctions to be entirely unjustified and pointless in ""bringing peace"". They hurt the economy of the DPRK, they worsen the living standards of the Korean people, and you know what else: they help validate the claims of the DPRK government about being a target of imperialism. If you think DPRK is acting in a hostile manner, and want them to be more willing to approach you diplomatically, it might help to not antagonize them, don'tcha think?  Shame on you and shame on the Republican Party for having you as a Senator."

Same reason why Cuba is sanctioned?   And because maybe Korean is your first lauguage I'll help you out   And now you've resorted to disparagement, wow...   our delusional I'f you think that North Korea will allow a democracy. Why now, do they not allow it? And you think the Republic of Korea Shouldn't be allowed to reunite both countries?   DPRK being democratic or not isn't the point. Self-determination isn't conditional on whether there is a UN consensus on democracy in a nation.   I think that Korea should be reunited. The people of both Korean nations long for reunification. It should be done democratically as proposed by the government of the DPRK, however, not through a forced reunification under South Korean mandate."

ModelUSGov,34j13i,jaywhoo,5,Fri May 1 23:54:23 2015 UTC,"I would not support this in its current state for a couple of reasons.  Section 4 is unclear as to what is to be done about the 2 other parties present in DPRK, the Social Democratic party and the Chondoist party. They have numerous positions within the government.  Section 5, If reunification were to happen I think it might be better done under a more neutral organization like the UN. I am not really sure expanding foreign influence in the region is really an answer to their problems though."

ModelUSGov,34j13i,Mentitor,6,Fri May 1 17:47:44 2015 UTC,"I think this is a disgusting, baseless and pointless attack against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea by the Democratic Party. It seems that, in light of constant attacks against workers by the police and the military in this country, the Democrats wish to engage in whataboutism by attacking a socialist country on the grounds of human rights.  I strongly oppose and condemn this bill and think that the Democrats should work on their own house first before attacking other houses."
ModelUSGov,34j13i,jaywhoo,15,Fri May 1 16:09:06 2015 UTC,The DPRK isn't even socialist though. Their policies resemble fascism more than anything
ModelUSGov,34j13i,jaywhoo,3,Fri May 1 16:17:48 2015 UTC,"this, they've removed every mention of communism from their constitution and the socialism still retained is described as ""socialism without socialism."""
ModelUSGov,34j13i,risen2011,4,Fri May 1 16:32:29 2015 UTC,"Actually, ""communism"" is still in the DPRK constitution. You can find references to socialism and communism."
ModelUSGov,34j13i,jaywhoo,12,Fri May 1 17:04:00 2015 UTC,"Socialism is still in their constitution, but Communism has been removed, and the word Songun/Seon'gun (military first) has been added in other sections. Here is the 2012 Constitution of the DPRK.  I won't make you look for it. Here are the changes:    Article Number Pre-2009 Constitution 2012 Constitution    29 Socialism and Communism are built by the creative labor of the working masses. Socialism is built by the creative labour of the working people.society,   40 The DPRK shall, by carrying out a thorough cultural revolution, train the working people to be builders of socialism and communism equipped with a profound knowledge of nature and society and a high level of culture and technology, thus making the whole of society intellectual. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea shall, by carrying out a thorough cultural revolution, train all the people to be builders of socialism equipped with a profound knowledge of nature and society and a high level of culture and technology, thus making the whole of society intellectual."

ModelUSGov,34j13i,Smitty9913,6,Fri May 1 19:05:53 2015 UTC,No need to apologize. It was an honest mistake.
ModelUSGov,34j13i,Smitty9913,2,Fri May 1 19:07:16 2015 UTC,is this the 2009 constitution?
ModelUSGov,34j13i,Smitty9913,2,Fri May 1 18:18:40 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Well, it is the constitution after which the supposed removal of the word ""communism"" was made."
ModelUSGov,34j13i,evanb_,1 point,Fri May 1 18:54:28 2015 UTC,"last time I checked that one, and admittedly it was brief. Was that the core socialist beliefs had been striped either in law or in practice."
ModelUSGov,34j13i,HipsterDios,2,Fri May 1 18:55:58 2015 UTC,"Apparently it was the 2012 constitution that removed the word ""communism"", not the 2009 one. The word ""socialism"" is still in the DPRK constitution, however."

To appoint someone to a cabinet position, a very important one at that, and then to start backpedaling almost immediately once he exposes his choice to /r/ModelUSGov, because of his political illiteracy and brash, inappropriate behavior, demonstrates to me that the President was more interested in simply filling a cabinet with people who had ""GL"" flairs next to their names, rather than finding the most qualified person for each position."

ModelUSGov,34hon3,ehbrums1,7,Sun May 3 20:56:13 2015 UTC,"This was supposed to be a ""realistic simulation.""  I think that's what the legislator does not understand.  When the ModelUSGov was established, it was supposed to be a realistic simulation of the US government.  That's why many of us joined in the beginning.  We wanted to take part in a realistic simulation of the US government.  Once it is taken over entirely by communists, it ceases to be a realistic simulation of the US government.  It becomes overrun by teenagers who seek to chastise older people for even taking part in it."

ModelUSGov,34hon3,ehbrums1,6,Sun May 3 21:57:41 2015 UTC,"The legislator once again fails to understand.  Perhaps this is because the legislator has not been a member of the subreddit for as long as some others.  The Model US Government was set up and advertised as a realistic simulation of the US Government.  Certainly the legislator must agree that it is currently NOT a realistic simulation of the US Government.  You are correct that people have the option to walk away from it.  I would present to you the likelihood that anyone non-leftist likely will walk away from it as communists do things that are not realistic.  It won't be a case of you ""winning the game"".  It will be a case of you destroying the simulation that people signed on for."
ModelUSGov,34hon3,IBiteYou,2,Sun May 3 22:03:19 2015 UTC,"The Model US Government was set up and advertised as a realistic simulation of the US Government. Certainly the legislator must agree that it is currently NOT a realistic simulation of the US Government.    It absolutely is an accurate simulation of the US Government. The Government is made up of the people, and in this simulation those people include those of us who are GL.  I will concede, it is not a simulation of the current political climate in the US government, but that is not what this is, this is a simulation government. In this simulation government, the simulation Democrats and simulation Republicans must deal with the fact that there is also a simulation libertarian party and a simulation Green party. These two parties absolutely exist in the real world, but are not nearly as popular. Are you suggesting that we suppress people's right to form parties because it does not conform to your idea of what party politics is?   It won't be a case of you ""winning the game"". It will be a case of you destroying the simulation that people signed on for.   How are we destroying it? We're playing by the same rules everyone else is."
ModelUSGov,34hon3,ehbrums1,6,Sun May 3 22:14:35 2015 UTC,"It absolutely is an accurate simulation of the US Government.    If the legislator is unable to understand that the Model US Government as it currently stands is worlds apart from the actual US government... then we're talking past ourselves.   The Government is made up of the people, and in this simulation those people include those of us who are GL.    The US government is not made up of teenagers from other countries.  Now... before you attack me for being an old fart... I'm referring to the recent demographic survey.   In this simulation government, the simulation Democrats and simulation Republicans must deal with the fact that there is also a simulation libertarian party and a simulation Green party.   We have been forced to.  But this was not the case when we signed up and many of us have very much resisted the inclusion of third parties as major players.  Some of us knew what would happen ... and it is exactly this.  A situation where fairly radical political types have taken over the simulation and will increasingly marginalize the major parties.   Are you suggesting that we suppress people's right to form parties because it does not conform to your idea of what party politics is?   I have always been in favor of limiting the influence of third parties so that the simulation remains a realistic representation of US politics and not a virtual communist revolution.   We're playing by the same rules everyone else is.   Off site advertising, downvotes and a party member who voted more than ten times in the past election says otherwise."
ModelUSGov,34hon3,kilgore_trout87,2,Sun May 3 22:26:19 2015 UTC,"What all of this sounds like is you being cranky that there aren't more people in your party. I'd wager to bet that if your party was in the position that the GL is in right now, you wouldn't be such a curmudgeon."

ModelUSGov,34hon3,Thats_Enough_AD,2,Sun May 3 22:42:20 2015 UTC,there is also a simulation libertarian party and a simulation Green party.    There was a simulation Green party.  There is not one anymore.  I really think the Green-Left ought to update its name since the party has been co-opted by Communists and (at least from my experience there) no longer resembles the Green Party in any way.
ModelUSGov,34hon3,CrossBowGuy237,5,Mon May 4 20:04:07 2015 UTC,So we're going to suppress the people's voice in the name of realism?  I hate socialism just as much as you but its really kind of cowardly to just try to suppress people you disagree with.

Kinda weird, I always thought transgender is about being in between, not moving from one gender to the other.  I hope I got the definitions right, though in general I was just meant to be a slightly funny statement, I'm on the one hand too conservative, on the other too ""live and let live""-thinking, so again just meant to be a statement, not that I'd care."

If yes, you are the standard definition of a woman, which is a female human. You can identify as a woman and that's great, but technically speaking, the term woman refers to a female human, not identity."
ModelUSGov,34hon3,HammerAndPotato,6,Fri May 1 16:31:37 2015 UTC,"No, there is no such thing as a ""standard definition of a woman"".  There is none.  That's the definition of a cisgender woman, and gender ≠ sex."

ModelUSGov,34hon3,IBiteYou,4,Sat May 2 02:14:33 2015 UTC,Transphobic much?
ModelUSGov,34hon3,DidNotKnowThatLolz,11,Sat May 2 04:38:12 2015 UTC,"There is literally nothing transphobic about stating a fact. Woman, in common speak, refers to a female human, which is an individual that has two X chromosomes. Someone who identifies as a specific gender does not suddenly have new chromosomes. They are what they identify as, but IBiteYou is a woman by the definition I gave, HammerAndPotato is not, and Smitty wasn't referring to self-identification. I've provided evidence for that  through dictionary definitions from Oxford and Merriam Webster, as well as an Urban Dictionary link to reinforce the idea that woman commonly refers to female human beings. Would you like to refute that?"

ModelUSGov,34hon3,TheRealRailguy,2,Fri May 1 16:14:13 2015 UTC,Who said I was inclusive. If your born one way it's the way you should stay.
ModelUSGov,34hon3,ehbrums1,10,Fri May 1 16:23:23 2015 UTC,"You claimed that so ""diverse"", yet you're being transphobic.  That's not diversity, nor is it inclusive  (being inclusive of others happens to be called diversity)."
ModelUSGov,34hon3,ben1204,5,Fri May 1 16:28:20 2015 UTC,"Yes we are diverse, having one man who is now a women doesn't make something diverse.   Having what seems to be the only women and having a large scale in age and working experience is."

ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Eilanyan,13,Wed Apr 29 18:57:22 2015 UTC,"I think this is a great practical bill given the current balance in the houses of congress.

I hope you all will vote for this in the house and senate."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,rangerheart0,6,Wed Apr 29 21:33:46 2015 UTC,"Hear, hear."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,jsmith18486,15,Wed Apr 29 21:45:38 2015 UTC,A worthy bill from the Green--Left Party! Tax cuts? Check. A bill that promotes workers rights without micromanaging private enterprise? Check. A bill that promotes democracy in American lives? Check.  This could not possibly be a more moderate bill.
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Zachrist,14,Wed Apr 29 18:00:14 2015 UTC,"This bill is important for a number of reasons. As one of the less radical members of the GL party, I can still get behind this bill 100%. No, we aren't trying to derail or seize control of the economy. We want to incentivize the creation of businesses which are democratically run. We believe that these businesses will be more fair to their workers and will benefit them more than a non-democratically owned business would."

ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Sheppio734,11,Wed Apr 29 20:41:25 2015 UTC,I am staunchly anti-feminist   I am shocked anyone could actually be this way.
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Canadianman22,9,Wed Apr 29 20:56:39 2015 UTC,I am staunchly anti-feminist   So you admit to being a bigot?
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,risen2011,4,Wed Apr 29 22:20:06 2015 UTC,"Bigotry and anti-feminism are very different things. Feminism, as it is today, is fueled by misinformation."

ModelUSGov,34a4fw,rangerheart0,6,Wed Apr 29 22:48:49 2015 UTC,Me too.   But then I realized you cannot be against the idea of Feminism because of the actions of a few.
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,risen2011,6,Wed Apr 29 22:51:44 2015 UTC,"The problem is that feminism doesn't meet up with its dictionary definition. It does things that are undeniably against being equal to men. If you want examples, look to my other replies. To say that anyone who doesn't want to associate with a hate group is a bigot is bigoted in itself."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Sheppio734,6,Wed Apr 29 23:04:16 2015 UTC,You just called Feminism (as a whole) a hate group?
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,risen2011,2,Wed Apr 29 23:37:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think all people who classify themselves as feminists are part of a hate group, but feminists have performed actions that I would classify as something a hate group would do."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Sheppio734,5,Wed Apr 29 23:44:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think all people who are white are part of a hate group, but white people have performed actions that I would classify as a hate group would do.  Don't speak about a whole class of people based on the actions of a few."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,risen2011,3,Wed Apr 29 23:49:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I misspoke. In the present, the majority of feminists are doing things I would expect of a hate group. Either that, or the ""good ones"" are doing nothing."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Sheppio734,3,Wed Apr 29 23:55:16 2015 UTC,"So have Christians, Muslims, Jews, Whites, Blacks, Asians, Liberals, Conservatives, Communists, Capitalists, Socialists, Males, Females, and any other term you could classify people under, but you wouldn't call these hate groups. Feminism is a movement to make equal rights between men and women, what you seem to be referring to is the ""tumblr feminists"" and the like who are not an embodiment of what the movement is trying to represent."

ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Sheppio734,4,Thu Apr 30 00:45:41 2015 UTC,"Demonstrating for fair wages, reproductive rights, end to slut-shaming, and more. Do you seriously not care about any of these? What if I told you that attacks on female workers often later become attacks on their male counterparts when their working conditions and wages are threatened? Feminism not only helps women, it also indirectly helps men."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,HalflingTea,4,Thu Apr 30 01:53:40 2015 UTC,The women's law project helped change the legal definition of rape on a federal level so that women weren't the only ones who could be legally raped (definition could still be improved but it's better than the old definition!)
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,kingofquave,3,Thu Apr 30 03:28:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna try to argue with you, because I am fairly busy at the moment. I will say this: Don't go trashing on something unless you know what it actually is. Don't generalize. Don't accuse. You are contributing to the bigotry. This is why so many people aren't for feminism, because people like you don't understand what it is."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,cameronc65,5,Thu Apr 30 00:52:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you for having a discussion about this, and poising well thought-out concerns.   What defines these? I am staunchly anti-feminist, and I'd like to know if I would be inadvertantly pushing an agenda I disagree with by voting yea.   I suppose before I can address this I need to know what you mean by feminism, and why you are against it.   Limited hierarchal controls also sounds pretty vague.   It is somewhat vague - we wanted this list to be more about characteristics than a cold-hard list. Our thought was that the CWD and IRS could work our exactly what this means for businesses applying for DW Status.  Though, if you have a suggestion, we are more than willing to listen.   Can a member of the CWD also be a member of Congress?   This was the thought. Members of Congress would be elected to this position by Congress itself. However, there are term limits, as defined in the bill."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Sheppio734,3,Wed Apr 29 20:56:49 2015 UTC,"The problems I have with feminism is that it has, as of late, done very little good for anyone, and has in fact hurt us from moving forward in gender equality. Feminists have fought against:  Rape shelters for men,1  Equality in divorce court,2  Seminars on equality,12  Men in domestic abuse,1 2, this one is a little unprofessional.   Stopping the Judiciary from sexism against men 1, This one's the UK2, UK as well. 3, Here's the US.  That's just here in the western world. Feminism has done remarkably little to further the cause of equality in third-world countries."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,cameronc65,6,Wed Apr 29 21:24:18 2015 UTC,The problems I have with feminism   What do you think feminism is?
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Zachrist,4,Wed Apr 29 21:49:24 2015 UTC,"The Democratic Workplace Act, fortunately, touches on none of these issues and as such wouldn't be promoting your conception of feminism.  If domestic abuse for men and a lack of rape shelters for men are of real concern to you I would love to work on a bill with you and have this addressed."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,rangerheart0,5,Thu Apr 30 03:10:45 2015 UTC,"As someone who previously thought very similarly to the way you think now I would say that you have nothing to worry about. The G-L while feminist, is not really interested in being anti-man in the manners which you have described.   We are trying to pursue gender equality. The gender and ethnic wage and overall equality is exactly as it sounds. An environment where people of all genders and ethnicity have the same opportunities, and same payment for equal work."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Oslovite,4,Thu Apr 30 00:01:37 2015 UTC,I am staunchly anti-feminist   This worries me. Do you think women should earn less than men just because they're women?
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Sheppio734,2,Wed Apr 29 20:46:23 2015 UTC,"No. The figure of 77 cents to a man's dollar is a number calculated by taking total earnings of all men to that of all women working full time, year round. The reason men make more in total is for 3 main reasons.   Men go into higher earning fields Men are more likely to work longer hours Men choose higher earning majors in college.    Controlling for this shows a wage gap of approximately 2-4%. Here, I can see an argument for government intervention for wages. The 77 cent figure, however, is horrible misinformation."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Oslovite,4,Wed Apr 29 20:54:16 2015 UTC,And why do men go into higher earning fields?
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Sheppio734,3,Wed Apr 29 20:56:18 2015 UTC,"For a number of reasons. Men have to support a family. A woman can afford to go into a lesser earning field because she can rely on a boyfriend or husband to support the needs of the family, so she can choose the field that she wants to work in. I am, of course, speaking generally."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Oslovite,5,Wed Apr 29 21:04:55 2015 UTC,So the reason there must be no equality in a workplace is because women rely on their husbands?  You are indeed anti-feminist.
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Sheppio734,4,Wed Apr 29 21:10:22 2015 UTC,"What? I never said anything about being anti-equality in the workplace. What I'm saying is that feminists, which are the people I would assume be appointed to determine what equality is, have in the past skewed results and spread misinformation to get their way."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,IAmRoot,6,Wed Apr 29 21:26:03 2015 UTC,"The fact that these male dominated majors and fields are higher paying is a direct result of some jobs being considered ""mens work"" while others are considered ""womens work"". Ignoring this is to ignore the effect of gender roles.  It should also be noted that gender roles can hurt men, as well. For instance, your earlier comment about men getting harsher prison sentences is a result of the traditional gender roles of men being dominant and in control with women being considered weaker and innocent. The result is that the courts treat men as more responsible for their actions and therefore punish them more harshly."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Sheppio734,2,Thu Apr 30 01:16:40 2015 UTC,"In addition, society does not dictate what a woman chooses to major in at the collegiate level. Out of the 10 lowest earning college degrees, women dominate 9/10 of them."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Mentitor,6,Thu Apr 30 01:44:33 2015 UTC,"...except for the societal pressure to fit into a gender role. Also the fact that those lines of work pay so little may very well be because they are dominated by women, whose work is valued less."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,WineRedPsy,2,Thu Apr 30 03:11:46 2015 UTC,"More accurately, fields dominated by men become higher-earning"
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Zachrist,2,Sat May 2 15:38:19 2015 UTC,"Can a member of the CWD also be a member of Congress?   There is nothing in the current language prohibiting this.  The idea behind ""limited hierarchical controls"" and similarly vague phrases is to have enough wiggle room for bussinesses from a wide range of industries to be able to take advantage of the tax cut, if they choose. A large motorparts factory might need more organizational hierarchy than a co-op bookstore, say."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,cameronc65,7,Thu Apr 30 03:01:25 2015 UTC,"I'm going to toe a different line from that of most of my party, up until this point.  I do, in principle, support this bill.  While I do describe myself as a vehement defender of capitalism, at the same time, I do place a particular value on democratically run businesses.  I do think it is a shame that more of these types of businesses do not exist, and I certainly would support tax incentives to give them a chance to compete in the same realm as the hierarchical 'capitalist' businesses.  That being said, I know this is certainly a divisive issue.  Here's what I propose:   We slash corporate tax rates to make us competitive with the rest of the 1st world. We re-write the tax code' to eliminate the deductions that companies like General Electric and others use to pay either no tax or negative taxes. We add a tax deduction for democratically-ran businesses in the tax code.   If that's not possible, as it stands, I would likely support this bill, but as /u/Xarasystral suggested, I would prefer to see the 'committee' amended out of the bill, and discretion over these tax breaks given to the Internal Revenue Service.  The committee seems like nothing more than a further inflation of government bureaucracy."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,cameronc65,4,Thu Apr 30 04:33:56 2015 UTC,/u/Xarasystral has proposed an amendment that I am in full support of.
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Nivmilk,13,Thu Apr 30 22:38:26 2015 UTC,"I feel that this bill should be appealing to both Republicans and Democrats - it lowers taxes, potentially raises worker wages, and does not force anything it merely incentivizes."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,rangerheart0,3,Wed Apr 29 15:07:21 2015 UTC,"The problem is, I think they are more terrified of the idea of the GL as communist rather than environmentalist and a more left leaning social democratic party."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Nivmilk,5,Wed Apr 29 22:37:49 2015 UTC,"Definitely, There seems to be an underlying current of thought that everything we do has some sort of underlying revolutionary plot hidden inside. When really in this specific instance we are just trying to promote democracy in the lives of the American people."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,IBiteYou,4,Wed Apr 29 22:46:43 2015 UTC,"Some people are afraid of change, you must get used to it I mean if we do not embrace change and stay with the status quo how will we progress how will we innovate how will we make life better for all working people and even those who cannot work?"
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Xarasystral,2,Thu Apr 30 00:30:05 2015 UTC,"You understand we're not falling for it, right?  Many of you ARE revolutionary communists.  You know it.  We know it.  This bill seeks to give tax benefits to businesses that agree to communize.  It creates a large federal government bureaucracy to deal with the communized businesses.  Democracy is providing ALL businesses with a tax break."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,cameronc65,5,Fri May 1 13:32:33 2015 UTC,"I would be much more willing to support this bill if we could strike the committee, and instead leave the IRS up to determining businesses who qualify. We don't need a group to take control of these matters. Although it has been claimed that is not what it is about, it could 1) eventually lead to that, and it will 2) ensure this bill fails."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,TheRealRailguy,5,Thu Apr 30 03:11:27 2015 UTC,"I think this, along with perhaps stricter definitions of a Democratic Workplace, could allow us to eliminate the need for the committee."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,ehbrums1,7,Thu Apr 30 03:32:32 2015 UTC,So basically it just gives tax breaks to Democratic businesses?  Good luck getting any for-profit businesses to agree to this.
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,cameronc65,16,Wed Apr 29 15:10:38 2015 UTC,"yeah, how dare we try to support and bolster democracy!"
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,utdude999,14,Wed Apr 29 15:20:13 2015 UTC,"Good luck getting any for-profit businesses to agree to this.   Democratic Businesses are for-profit businesses. The profit is just shared among everyone rather than only those at the top, as is production and decision responsibilities - hence the term ""Democratic."""
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,TheRealRailguy,12,Wed Apr 29 15:22:45 2015 UTC,How are worker-owned businesses not for-profit? The only difference is the profit is going to the people who create it.
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,cameronc65,2,Wed Apr 29 15:30:35 2015 UTC,"I never said they won't, I said that businesses exist to make a select few people profit, and no business will enter into this willingly for this reason."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Zachrist,6,Wed Apr 29 17:48:32 2015 UTC,"I said that businesses exist to make a select few people profit, and no business will enter into this willingly for this reason.   I'm not sure that's true, but that's ok - let's say no businesses currently run by a select few do not convert.  It will also help businesses that are starting - it's not only for the conversion of businesses."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Canadianman22,7,Wed Apr 29 17:56:42 2015 UTC,"Non-democratically held firms won't likely make the transition, true. But the tax cut will spur investment in new firms, particularly in the skilled technology sector."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,laffytaffyboy,6,Wed Apr 29 18:10:04 2015 UTC,"ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE GOVERNOR OF THE CENTRAL STATE  Good afternoon,  I wish to inform everyone that as we speak, the Attorney General of the great Central State is drawing up court papers that we are considering filing with the Supreme Court should this bill pass. After studying this bill, a conclusion has been made that this bill will indeed infringe on states rights, and have several cases that will be used to argue our point.  While we wish the federal government had not introduced this legislation before discussing it with the states, we will not stand by and let the federal government violate our states rights, and the rights of our citizens.  Thank you, Governor /u/Canadianman22."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Zachrist,14,Wed Apr 29 19:41:01 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but I fail to see what right the states have in determining the federal tax rates."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,ehbrums1,8,Wed Apr 29 19:53:26 2015 UTC,I look forward to hearing how an adjustment of federal tax rates has anything to do with states rights.
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Eilanyan,8,Wed Apr 29 19:59:02 2015 UTC,What rights is this bill infringing upon?
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,ben1204,7,Wed Apr 29 19:56:06 2015 UTC,Thank god my Democratic Governor is more reasonable then to try and argue for state control over federal taxes.
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,rangerheart0,6,Wed Apr 29 20:23:46 2015 UTC,"Although I'm not exactly for this bill, this concerns federal tax rates. I have to be honest, I'm not sure I side with you on this one, and I'd like to see this question answered before signing on to a lawsuit.  We can't simply challenge laws just because we don't like them, there has to a be a legitimate constitutional question, and I'm not sure there's one here."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Canadianman22,7,Wed Apr 29 21:36:58 2015 UTC,I mean I would think that something like this could be addressed with an amendment to the bill or something like that. Instead of directly taking it to the supreme court.   That being said I am not entirely sure how a bill altering the federal tax rate interferes with states rights.
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,rangerheart0,4,Wed Apr 29 21:39:26 2015 UTC,"Mr. President, I am currently sending you a letter which will outline my concerns."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Canadianman22,7,Wed Apr 29 21:41:56 2015 UTC,"Awesome, hopefully we can address them."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,ben1204,3,Wed Apr 29 21:42:30 2015 UTC,That is my hope as well.
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,notevenalongname,3,Wed Apr 29 21:43:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure either, and I would like to know /u/canadianman22's interpretations of how it does."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,zombiesingularity,4,Wed Apr 29 21:40:21 2015 UTC,"You see, federal tax changes can violate the tenth amendment (states' rights), even though it seems absurd at the first glance. To learn more, have a look at United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1 (1936) (there are a couple more as well).   The tax, the appropriation of the funds raised, and the direction for their disbursement are but parts of the plan. They are but means to an unconstitutional end.   (United States v. Butler, supra, at 297 U.S. 68)  We are currently looking into how far these things apply in this case."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Canadianman22,4,Thu Apr 30 12:56:37 2015 UTC,You can't file a lawsuit until it passes.
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,zombiesingularity,6,Wed Apr 29 20:10:20 2015 UTC,"Yes. Which is why I included the statement ""Should this bill pass"""
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,cameronc65,4,Wed Apr 29 20:15:07 2015 UTC,So it's okay for states to defend business owners but it can't defend workers?
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Canadianman22,4,Wed Apr 29 20:17:15 2015 UTC,"I am really sad at the posturing that's happening right here. I wish you had discussed the objections or hesitations you had with this bill with us instead of threatening legal action should it pass.  I understand that it's a simulation, and that there's some fun to be had in extreme reactions, so I'll grant you that. However, not responding to my message asking about your issues, and refusing to speak about your issues on this thread is not the way to go about seeing an amendment to the bill.  I guess what I am trying to say is that I am really disappointed in the your reaction, I had thought much higher of you."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,cameronc65,3,Wed Apr 29 23:02:51 2015 UTC,"Respectfully, without a name of the author on this bill, I have no idea who to discuss this with. It is not my responsibility to track down the author of a bill to voice my concerns and to have a friendly discussion of any misunderstandings."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Canadianman22,4,Wed Apr 29 23:09:08 2015 UTC,Many other commentors took the liberty of explaining their stance on this bill without threatening legal action.
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,cameronc65,3,Wed Apr 29 23:14:20 2015 UTC,"I would remind you I am not a part of the federal system, but of the state system. To engage in debate here would not be proper (I believe).  If I had the name of the author, which I looked and did not see (at the time of this writing it is simply the Green-Left Party), I would have first contacted them directly to voice concerns and have a friendly discussion."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Canadianman22,4,Wed Apr 29 23:20:22 2015 UTC,"It is more than appropriate - that's why it's put on the US Gov thread.

ModelUSGov,34a4fw,schultejt,5,Thu Apr 30 02:53:55 2015 UTC,"First off what is a Republican Democracy? The United States would be better classified as a Democratic/Federal/Constitutional Republic.   Yes, that's true - Republican just means representative, Democracy just means ruled by the people. Republican Democracy is equally as valid as a Democratic Republic. Federal/Constitutional Republic just further specify what kind of Republic.   Some of your vague wording would leave it up to beuracratic/judicial interpretation, but perhaps you planned for that.   We did not want to get too strict on exactly what defines a Workplace Democracy for 2 reasons - it's extremely difficult to define, and we didn't want to make it too broad or too narrow. That's why we went with an overall list of characteristics (similar to some of the language in the constitution and a lot of other legislation) so that it could determine itself over time.   Allowing a government organization, especially one so corrupted by fraud like the IRS the privilege of deciding which companies deserve tax breaks is inexcusable.   How would you feel if we made the characteristics more strict and eliminated the Democratic Workplace Committee?"

For one you don't specify how the DWC will be chosen by congress and three people is a lot of power in very few hands.  Second, the characteristics should be strict and part of the law itself and if it needs changing Congress as a whole can do it.  Third having the IRS in charge of deciding which companies are ""democratic"" is unacceptable as they have shown that they are not above targeting certain politcal ideologies.  Also, Republican Democracy implies that Republican is an adjective to democracy.  In democratic Republic, Democratic is the adjective to Republic.  A democracy is a government in which the people vote on legislation.  A republic is a government where representatives vote on legislation.  A democratic republic would be a government where all people vote on representatives who then vote on legislation.  I couldn't even say what a Republican Democracy."

This bill does not put any business under a committee, they merely receive tax breaks if the follow a higher standard of workers rights. There is no penalty for ending participation in this program, if a company no longer wishes to be considered a democratic workplace, they merely lose the benefits that come with it.   This bill encourages co-ops because they typically have a higher standard of workers rights. It is a shame that you believe American businesses can not function while treating their workers with respect and dignity.   What is more equal than democracy?

A government that produces a lot, but suppresses the voice of those that are producing for it are not successful. Let me retype your comment with a different kind of wording.   Governments should be able to have more control over their country than the people. I agree that people should be compensated for the work they do, but we  should not incentivize Democracy. If some people want to do that, great. But, like I have said, let's not punish other types of governments that are successful because they have a hierarchical system.   This seems wrong to us.

First of all, I'd like to see some hard definitions for Sec. 2.1.1-6.  Why would I like to see them narrowly defined?   Because in Sec. 3.1-2, it sure seems like you're giving a hell of a lot of leeway to a committee that can completely change hands over the course of the election cycle. This will lead to instability for both the Federal Budget and ""Democratic Workplaces;"" as the bill is written, one committee could define the rules on what a ""Democratic Workplace"" has to do to maintain standing and thus whether they qualify for the enormous tax cuts in the bill. This means that an employee owned business that qualifies as a ""Democratic Workplace"" could have whether it can continue to be profitable decided on the outcome of Congressional elections. Also, since the tax cuts are so huge, wouldn't this mean that Congress will have to make drastic changes to the budget based on how many businesses qualified each year? That doesn't seem to bode well for agencies with long-term projects like NASA, the CDC, etc.  Sec. 5.1 seems largely redundant given the protections of the 15th, 19th, 24th, and 26th Amendments of the Constitution (but, then again, I'd be open to amending the Constitution to make clear the affirmative right to vote of all Americans over the age of 18).  Sec. 6.2 looks like little more than pandering to the Republicans so that they'll go along with your agenda. A 30% tax rate for billionaires is nuts. How on earth do you guys plan on making up for that in the budget? Or do you just plan to tack the cost onto the deficit?  I'm all for incentivizing employee-owned businesses, but this seems like a wildly misguided approach to that end."

Good point - a large part of the reason we put this in here was to keep the definition fluid in case changes did need to be made. This is why we kept a list of characteristics and left it's more specific content to the Committee.

This is the democratic process within the business, not in the government.   I have to take one more issue with Sec 6.2.2. Are these rates flat taxes, or do deductions and credits apply to them?   You know what, a tax deduction may be a better way of going about this than a change in rate.   Sec. 6.2 looks like little more than pandering to the Republicans so that they'll go along with your agenda. A 30% tax rate for billionaires is nuts.

ModelUSGov,34a4fw,cameronc65,6,Wed Apr 29 16:30:59 2015 UTC,currently unaware of subsidies for businesses with certain hierarchies   Must have been away
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,SomeRealShit,6,Wed Apr 29 16:35:11 2015 UTC,That's not relevant. These aren't direct subsidies from the government based on the way the company is set up. these are simply massive companies affording great lawyers to get around regulation and tax laws.

ModelUSGov,34a4fw,Zachrist,8,Wed Apr 29 17:18:52 2015 UTC,"not managerial systems.   Here's the thing - we do this already. Non-profits must have a board, they must be managed in a certain way in order to receive a tax benefit.   We feel that Democracy is a better system of governance than any other, including when it comes to businesses. However, we are not taking away a companies right to choose how to govern. We, are, however, saying that because Democracy is a better form of governing and we'd like to incentivize it's implementation in businesses.  Don't you believe Democracy is better overall? Why don't you want to see it effect more areas of life? Is it not strange that we want Democracy everywhere except the workplace?"

It's better for workers, abuses, decision making, etc. So, of course we are going to push for this. However, we are not forcing anyone to do anything - we are merely incentivizing.  And incentivization of structures, means, and types of business is not anything new in America. We see it with non-profits, capital gains, etc. etc."

Regardless, can anyone from the Green-Left, preferably the author(s) of this legislation, provide a reason why we should do this? Is there any evidence that increased democracy in the work place would lead to an increase in any of the following:  1.) Productivity.  2.) Income.  3.) Gross Domestic Product.  You are cutting taxes for businesses based on whether they are democratized or not which acts like a penalty towards businesses which do not follow this model. You are creating a new government oversight committee and possibly making it harder for normal businesses to compete."

ModelUSGov,34a4fw,cameronc65,7,Wed Apr 29 17:00:04 2015 UTC,"I'm  confused on what your objection is. This bill would give tax cuts to businesses that are commonly owned.  If you are getting this tax cut, you are having a say in what's ""actually there""."
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,kingofquave,6,Wed Apr 29 17:40:28 2015 UTC,"I want workers to have a say in what's actually there's.   How do you propose we give them the ability to do this?   They do not own the work place, therefore there shouldn't be incentive encouraging the employers to do so.   Yes, they don't own it, but it doesn't follow that we shouldn't be encouraging them to do so. Why don't you think we should be encouraging them?"
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,ehbrums1,6,Wed Apr 29 18:26:31 2015 UTC,"Okay so your problems lie with those two parts, can you expand on that? I imagine your problem with the IRS stems from your belief in limited government but what's wrong with worker ownership?"
ModelUSGov,34a4fw,kingofquave,3,Wed Apr 29 17:44:33 2015 UTC,I just don't believe in incentivizing it.

We're not forcing any business to do anything here - we just are incentivizing something that we think is good, Democracy."

Though I'm certain a lot of people on this sub have a great deal of constitutional knowledge, I will always compare my opinion with others, research the issue thoroughly, and provide explanations which have depth and logic.   As a justice, I realize that I can never just trust my gut on an issue. I always must remain impartial and provide insight which doesn't come from how I feel about an issue, but rather the legality of it. Too often nowadays are court cases politicized. During my time as attorney general, I refrained from joining a party for this very reason. I only joined the GL with the intention of running for office. Once I was given the nomination, though, I figured I might as well stay since, for the most part, our vision of society is similar.   I have a deep respect for the Constitution of this country. Flawed as the original document may be, its amendments provide the basis for a society of free people who need not fear tyranny.  In summary, I intend to make decisions based on the law and the rights the constitution ensures. There will be no politicization of the court from me."
ModelUSGov,34apja,Smitty9913,2,Wed Apr 29 21:28:45 2015 UTC,You Seem Not To like the supreme law of the land
ModelUSGov,34apja,Prodigiousguy8,9,Thu Apr 30 03:56:54 2015 UTC,"The Constitution? No way. I said the original document was flawed. We had to amend the thing 27 times, and it's much stronger because of it. The first 14 of which guarantee us basic rights, abolished slavery, and guaranteed equal protection. Those are all important things which were left out of the original.   I'm a big fan of the constitution in its current form."
ModelUSGov,34apja,Logic_85,2,Thu Apr 30 04:05:15 2015 UTC,"Just wondering if you were aware the first 10 amendments were not drafted and adopted to ""fix the constitution"" but were, by design, drafted as amendments to separate the constitution and its amendments between limitations on government and rights of the citizens?"
ModelUSGov,34apja,Prodigiousguy8,3,Thu Apr 30 20:32:04 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge, they were drafted at the urging of the anti-federalists who stood in the way of the constitution's ratification."
ModelUSGov,34apja,Logic_85,2,Thu Apr 30 21:26:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, my point being that we haven't needed to amend the constitution ""27 times"" to get it right, but that many of those amendments were planned, or were minor in scope as a result.  Other amendments merely confirmed what was common and accepted in practice but struck down by the Supreme Court for not being included in the constitution (such as income tax or the judicial power).  Others, such the ""civil war amendments"" or women's suffrage, were important changes as society evolved, but certainly don't disparage the original document's very democratic and progressive nature, especially considering the state of the world in which it was drafted."
ModelUSGov,34apja,Prodigiousguy8,6,Thu Apr 30 21:54:02 2015 UTC,"I never claimed it was undemocratic or anything of that nature. Flawed and bad are two completely different words. I simply meant that it was an imperfect document when in its original state, and important changes have been made.   Additionally, it wasn't my intention to diminish how significant it was for the time. Nor do I believe it took ""27 tries to get it right."" I was simply indicating the immense progress several constitutional amendments made, which you said yourself.   I realize they weren't all significant. I wanted to highlight the fact that the document has been changed for the better. I apologize if, in doing that, I came across as unnecessarily hostile towards the Constitution."
ModelUSGov,34apja,IBiteYou,3,Thu Apr 30 22:07:28 2015 UTC,How would you have ruled in   Burwell vs.  Hobby Lobby?  The Citizens United case?
ModelUSGov,34apja,Prodigiousguy8,4,Thu Apr 30 01:59:59 2015 UTC,"I believe that both decisions set a dangerous precedence for corporate personhood, and I would have sided with the dissent in both cases.   Both decision operate on the assumption that corporations have the same rights as individuals. The problem is, executives are taking the profit workers generate for them, and they make decisions on their behalf, without consulting them. They are not democratic organizations and therefore should not be treated as a group of citizens voicing their opinion as one.  The same principle applies to the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby. The executives of Hobby Lobby don't decide the religious views of all their employees. The RFRA is in place to protect the individual's right to practice religion freely. Hobby Lobby is not an individual.   Now, if these were legitimate, non-profit interest groups receiving donations from individual citizens, my views would be different. Those organizations which act democratically or exist with an expressly religious or political agenda should be extended the same rights as people. Such groups are, legitimately, groups of citizens who act and make decisions together. Private businesses in which executives make decisions should not be treated as a group of people acting as a cohesive unit."
ModelUSGov,34apja,IBiteYou,3,Thu Apr 30 03:29:42 2015 UTC,"Hobby Lobby is not an individual.    It is, however, a closely-held corporation.  Your communist ideology will be influencing your decisions, then."
ModelUSGov,34apja,Prodigiousguy8,4,Thu Apr 30 03:41:41 2015 UTC,"It is, however, a closely-held corporation.   That's the issue, here. Again, the owners of a company, whose motive is to generate profit, are making decisions for everyone involved in the company. The Affordable Care Act gave exemptions to religious schools and other non-profit religious organizations. The members of those schools and organizations share a common set of beliefs. In a private, for-profit company, though? Not the case."
ModelUSGov,34apja,IBiteYou,5,Thu Apr 30 04:00:41 2015 UTC,"are making decisions for everyone involved in the company   They make those decisions every day.  When they decide to pay $11/hr ... that's their decision.  If they decide to fire someone, their decision.  If they decide to close a store, their decision.  If they decide that they will be closed on Sunday and everyone will be off, THEIR decision.   In a private, for-profit company, though? Not the case.   It has been the case since the business opened.  They provided what ... 20 of the 24 types of birth control mandated?  (I forget the specifics).  It was just a few where they said, ""We cannot pay for these particular methods of birth control because we are very much pro-life.""  Any of the other ones, ok.  Just not the ones considered abortifacient.  Should doctors be forced to provide abortions or to prescribe abortifacient drugs if they are adamantly pro-life on religious grounds?  And the Little Sisters of the Poor are still fighting the battle in court the last time I checked.  I find it dangerous that we think that the government ought to be able to pass a law that tramples on people's deeply-held religious beliefs  and then mandate that they follow it.  I'm going to assume you are pro-union.  Do unions represent people?"
ModelUSGov,34apja,Prodigiousguy8,4,Thu Apr 30 04:07:44 2015 UTC,"They do make other decisions, yes. However, the Affordable Care Act says they must provide coverage for those particular drugs. We're not discussing the merits of the act itself, but rather its application in this particular case.   I'm not arguing that doctors should be made to perform abortions, either. That is an individual's decision to make. The law isn't requiring Hobby Lobby to perform an abortion. It's requiring that employees be provided insurance for medicine so they can make a choice based on their individual beliefs. I feel similarly to justice Ginsburg on the issue. She wrote in her dissent:   Indeed, until today, religious exemptions had never been extended to any entity operating in “the commercial, profit-making world.” Amos, 483 U. S., at 337.16  The reason why is hardly obscure. Religious organizations exist to foster the interests of persons subscribing to the same religious faith. Not so of for-profit corporations. Workers who sustain the operations of those corporations commonly are not drawn from one religious community. Indeed, by law, no religion-based criterion can restrict the work force of for-profit corporations.   To address the question of unions, it depends on the union. Compulsory and nondemocratic unions often do not have their members' best interests at heart. These unions are often more concerned with political power for their leaders than empowering their workers.   Edit: One paragraph didn't save in the draft. You are right about Little Sisters of The Poor. They absolutely should be granted an exemption, seeing as they are an expressly religious nonprofit organization."
ModelUSGov,34apja,IBiteYou,2,Thu Apr 30 14:02:54 2015 UTC,"Ginsburg is right that until now we never had to address the issue of requiring a business to pay for something they are strongly morally opposed to providing.  Do we open the door to making Jewish delis provide pork to their patrons who are not Jewish?  I should be able to buy whatever sort of meat I want from a butcher.  Hobby Lobby did not seek to prevent employees from USING those forms of birth control if they wanted, they just objected to funding those particular forms of birth control.  And this WILL ultimately become a question of abortion itself.   To address the question of unions, it depends on the union.    Will you seek to restrain the political contributions of unions?"

I would not restrict contributions from unions or other nonprofit interest groups which operate democratically, however I believe the legislative branch would be more effective in defining exactly what qualifies this. Still, it is my belief that corporations and PACs which accept corporate donations do not represent citizens at large, merely the business executives who keep most of the profit.   As Sheppio already pointed out, the analogy you offered is a false equivalence. The government isn't dictating what the businesses can sell. I've already made my position fairly clear at this point, however, and I don't feel debating it further is going to get anywhere."

ModelUSGov,34apja,Prodigiousguy8,7,Wed Apr 29 21:59:42 2015 UTC,"I would have ruled the action unconstitutional. The power to reorganize bureaucracy is not delegated to the president specifically in the Constitution. When reorganizing departments and agencies, a president must first seek Congressional approval for reorganization authorization. The authorization lasts for a specific frame of time, and it includes specific guidelines about what the president can and cannot do.  If the President had requested such authorization from Congress, and Congress passed a bill specifically allowing the president to consolidate the cabinet, it would have been legal. Seeing as he failed to do that, however, the consolidation was not legal."

ModelUSGov,34apja,Prodigiousguy8,5,Thu Apr 30 03:30:30 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, abiding by precedence is important, especially in well-established cases. There are exceptions, however.   As we know, the Supreme Court is not infallible. Plessy v. Feguson was, by far, the worst decision the Court ever made. Decisions which such glaringly obvious faults as that must be overturned.  Similarly, cases which are narrowly decided should also be reevaluated. As I mentioned elsewhere in the thread, I disagree with the Citizens United v. FEC decision, which had a vote of 5 for and 4 against.  To put it concisely, precedence is important, but the court needs to reevaluate decisions when appropriate."

I believe the 1st and 14th amendments are the most important. The 1st is really the baseline of a socially free society. Freedom of religion, speech, and assembly are some of the most important and basic human rights. The 14th ensures that all laws are applied equally and moves a towards a society increasingly free of discrimination and privilege."

ModelUSGov,34apja,Prodigiousguy8,2,Thu Apr 30 03:57:19 2015 UTC,"Were these experiences in real life? I'm a bit confused by your statement. You said ""four years of simulated law experience"" but then go on to mention the ICJ and TNSC. Were the latter actual experiences, or something similar to MUSGov?"
ModelUSGov,34apja,Smitty9913,2,Thu Apr 30 15:16:17 2015 UTC,"Simulated, like MUSGov. I wish it were real. Maybe one day!"
ModelUSGov,34apja,Prodigiousguy8,2,Thu Apr 30 15:36:03 2015 UTC,Where was this?
ModelUSGov,34apja,Smitty9913,3,Thu Apr 30 21:11:16 2015 UTC,"School programs. Mock Trial, Mock Government, and Model United Nations."
ModelUSGov,34apja,Prodigiousguy8,2,Thu Apr 30 21:21:44 2015 UTC,What do you think of workers?
ModelUSGov,34apja,Smitty9913,4,Thu Apr 30 21:49:13 2015 UTC,"What about them specifically? Generally, they're pretty cool people."
ModelUSGov,34apja,Prodigiousguy8,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:56:11 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about communism, will that effect your ddecisios."
ModelUSGov,34apja,JerryLeRow,3,Thu Apr 30 22:34:02 2015 UTC,"I don't believe it will, but you can read about my opinions elsewhere in the thread and decide for yourself."
ModelUSGov,34apja,Prodigiousguy8,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:40:24 2015 UTC,"How would you see Washington D.C. becoming a state? Would it even be possible? If not, what's your opinion on the lack of the district's voting and representation rights?"
ModelUSGov,34apja,zombiesingularity,2,Thu Apr 30 09:54:54 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting issue that I don't really have a strong personal opinion about. Legally, there shouldn't be any problems with statehood, except for the fact that Maryland may have to approve it. This is because they gave up the land specifically for use as the nation's capital, not a new state.   Aside from that, though, this is completely a legislative issue."
ModelUSGov,34apja,JerryLeRow,0,Sat May 2 23:51:02 2015 UTC,"Can we speed all this unnecessary bureaucracy along? Waiting days, weeks and months for nominations and bills to get voted on is just outrageously pointless."
ModelUSGov,34apja,Smitty9913,4,Wed Apr 29 21:40:11 2015 UTC,I feel with you... I want that black flair :D
ModelUSGov,34apja,zombiesingularity,2,Wed Apr 29 21:53:04 2015 UTC,I find is disturbing you don't like voting. You honestly don't seem to fit the role as AG well to md
ModelUSGov,34apja,jaywhoo,0,Thu Apr 30 03:58:43 2015 UTC,"I just want to speed it along, instead of waiting arbitrary periods of time for no good reason. Vote sooner, is my argument."
ModelUSGov,34apja,zombiesingularity,5,Thu Apr 30 04:05:17 2015 UTC,It would be an injustice to the American people to not research before voting.
ModelUSGov,34apja,jaywhoo,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:12:30 2015 UTC,So the government should create arbitrary waiting times before we vote? Why not a year then?
ModelUSGov,34apja,zombiesingularity,4,Thu Apr 30 04:41:01 2015 UTC,"That would obviously not be reasonable and prudent. It is, however, reasonable and prudent to allow Senators to understand who they are voting for or against."
ModelUSGov,34apja,jaywhoo,0,Thu Apr 30 05:33:20 2015 UTC,Except this is just a game and it is very boring to have to wait a week or a month to play the next round. Lets speed this up.
ModelUSGov,34apja,zombiesingularity,6,Thu Apr 30 05:34:30 2015 UTC,"This is not just a game, rather it is a simulation. If you are focused on ""speed[ing] this shit up"" rather than ensuring it is done thoughtfully and properly, I question your position in the AG's office."
ModelUSGov,34apja,jaywhoo,0,Thu Apr 30 06:02:07 2015 UTC,"Question all you like, I'm a shoe-in. We control the Senate."
ModelUSGov,34apja,tiocer,8,Thu Apr 30 06:04:25 2015 UTC,What a disgusting mentality.
ModelUSGov,34apja,oughton42,6,Thu Apr 30 06:32:15 2015 UTC,Wow. I agree with /u/jawhoo. You do not deserve to be the Attorney General if this is your attitude to this simulation.
ModelUSGov,34apja,DidNotKnowThatLolz,6,Thu Apr 30 19:08:19 2015 UTC,I'm going to agree with /u/jaywhoo for the first time. This comment shows a distinct lack of maturity and professional courtesy. It has no business in an environment such as this.
ModelUSGov,34apja,Canadianman22,3,Thu Apr 30 23:33:53 2015 UTC,It's disappointing to see this kind of attitude from a nominee of the cabinet.
ModelUSGov,34apja,IBiteYou,3,Fri May 1 00:41:04 2015 UTC,"Question all you like, I'm a shoe-in. We control the Senate.   Seems like you are not a shoe-in at all. Humility is the only lesson to be learned here."
ModelUSGov,34apja,zombiesingularity,2,Fri May 1 03:50:30 2015 UTC,Yikes.

ModelUSGov,34apja,evanb_,3,Thu Apr 30 06:20:55 2015 UTC,Please remove unprofessional language from your post.    This is your first warning.
ModelUSGov,34a4w4,SeptimusSette,6,Wed Apr 29 14:48:37 2015 UTC,"Regardless of political stances, is Bill 34 appropriate? Is there precedence of Congress forcing the hand of the US Ambassador?"
ModelUSGov,34a4w4,jaywhoo,2,Wed Apr 29 15:47:07 2015 UTC,"Yes. Back in 2008, when the US recognized Kosovo, ""president Bush responded affirmatively to a request from Kosovo to establish diplomatic relations""."
ModelUSGov,34a4w4,Oslovite,9,Wed Apr 29 15:53:18 2015 UTC,"There is a clear distinction between the roles of the executive and of congress though.  I honestly feel like if the GLP wants to recognize Somaliland, the best way to do it is via the president.  I mean, I disagree with the recognition, but that's the best way to go about it regardless of personal belief."
ModelUSGov,34a4w4,jaywhoo,2,Wed Apr 29 15:56:17 2015 UTC,We debated the constitutionality of this in the original thread and I stand by my belief that congress is acting out of line with its enumerated powers here.
ModelUSGov,34a4w4,Logic_85,2,Thu Apr 30 13:57:59 2015 UTC,This. It is a clear violation of the separation of powers
ModelUSGov,34a4w4,Didicet,2,Fri May 1 09:10:30 2015 UTC,"It is. The question is whether someone is going to challenge it, and whether that someone even has standing (the president most likely would). We'll see what happens."
ModelUSGov,34a4w4,notevenalongname,3,Fri May 1 10:57:02 2015 UTC,"Standing to sue on this is an interesting issue.  I would hope that the Secretary of State or Attorney General would bring the suit against congress on behalf of the president, as the ""injury in fact"" comes to the Executive branch, as a whole.  The Congress has sued the president over separation of powers issues before (i.e. Clinton's line-item veto) so I don't see why anyone from the Executive branch wouldn't have standing to bring suit against congress under a similar claim."
ModelUSGov,34a4w4,Logic_85,3,Fri May 1 16:29:04 2015 UTC,"That was the executive branch. Congress held no vote on recognizing Kosovo, i.e. the way it's done. The president, as chief ambassador, is the one who deals with recognizing countries."
ModelUSGov,3447tl,Didicet,9,Tue Apr 28 04:09:14 2015 UTC,"Dang, whoever voted for me needs to verify their stuff!  But seriously, congratulations to everyone and I'm excited to start working in the sub."
ModelUSGov,3447tl,Zachrist,7,Tue Apr 28 04:10:32 2015 UTC,"Say anything for communists, say we're good at filling out the paperwork.   Congrats on a well-fought campaign!  I look forward to working with you in the legislature."
ModelUSGov,3447tl,richhomieram,8,Tue Apr 28 04:47:34 2015 UTC,Congrats to /u/Canadianman22  for winning the battle for governor of the Central district. Hopefully we can work together and help improve the great central district. I would also like to thank /u/NateLooney for a great election and hope for a great central district!
ModelUSGov,3447tl,ben1204,6,Tue Apr 28 19:02:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you to all who voted for me! I'm honored and excited to be elected governor of the Northeast. I look forward to working with the Northeast's legislators to accomplish sensible, yet innovative solutions to the problems our state faces."
ModelUSGov,3447tl,ehbrums1,2,Tue Apr 28 04:16:30 2015 UTC,I look forward to working with you to better the lives of our constituents.
ModelUSGov,3447tl,ben1204,3,Tue Apr 28 04:20:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I am open to any good ideas, no matter what party they're from."
ModelUSGov,3447tl,ehbrums1,3,Tue Apr 28 04:24:29 2015 UTC,"As well versed as I may be in Massachusetts state laws, I admittedly know very little about New York's. I suggest we all take a few days to acclimate ours before pressing forward."
ModelUSGov,3447tl,ben1204,2,Tue Apr 28 04:29:22 2015 UTC,"I approve of this. However, I'd like to make sure this is ok with the other legislators first. I think that in the meantime, I am going to start drafting a state constitution (on logistics and rules, not actual laws), and I'll have it up tomorrow."
ModelUSGov,3447tl,ehbrums1,2,Tue Apr 28 04:30:51 2015 UTC,of course! Will it be posted in the state sub?
ModelUSGov,3447tl,ben1204,2,Tue Apr 28 04:32:39 2015 UTC,Sure! I'll have it in a google doc and I'll allow you guys to vote on it.
ModelUSGov,3447tl,ehbrums1,2,Tue Apr 28 04:33:15 2015 UTC,fantastic
ModelUSGov,3447tl,oughton42,3,Tue Apr 28 04:34:33 2015 UTC,Congratulations to all the victors!
ModelUSGov,3447tl,ben1204,4,Tue Apr 28 04:24:53 2015 UTC,"A question for the mods; I understand we operate under state laws, but can we tailor to have our own procedures (voting, how bills are introduced, etc)?"
ModelUSGov,3447tl,SeptimusSette,4,Tue Apr 28 04:38:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with Septiumus, letting the States decide I think would be best."
ModelUSGov,3447tl,vidurnaktis,3,Tue Apr 28 15:26:09 2015 UTC,Good question. I await their response.  /u/pluralizer  /u/lort683
ModelUSGov,3447tl,Zachrist,3,Tue Apr 28 04:42:47 2015 UTC,I would not be against this. I think we will be taking a hands off approach in most cases.
ModelUSGov,3447tl,NateLooney,2,Tue Apr 28 14:13:08 2015 UTC,Congratulations to the winners.
ModelUSGov,3447tl,Canadianman22,4,Tue Apr 28 11:48:50 2015 UTC,FULL CAPITALISM!

ModelUSGov,3447tl,JerryLeRow,6,Tue Apr 28 17:07:39 2015 UTC,Congratulations to my opponent /u/Canadianman22 on the election! I would like to thank my supporters and the Potato lobbying PAC for their magnificent support. Let us hope for a prosperous potato state!
ModelUSGov,3447tl,jacoby531,6,Tue Apr 28 04:18:19 2015 UTC,I would like to thank my supporters and the Potato lobbying PAC for their magnificent support.   I had no doubt that the Potato Lobby wants DicTater Tots in office.  /jk

ModelUSGov,3447tl,evanb_,2,Tue Apr 28 19:04:48 2015 UTC,Congratulations to all our new state government officials!
ModelUSGov,3447tl,evanb_,2,Tue Apr 28 17:31:23 2015 UTC,We had a poll about a month ago that asked what state we were from. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that as the population numbers for determining the largest state?
ModelUSGov,3447tl,evanb_,2,Tue Apr 28 20:50:30 2015 UTC,Congratulations!
ModelUSGov,342tgs,ehbrums1,14,Mon Apr 27 21:29:49 2015 UTC,I'd like to commend Minority Leader /u/IBiteYou on waiting a full 3 hours before making this a border control issue.
ModelUSGov,342tgs,Smitty9913,4,Tue Apr 28 01:06:40 2015 UTC,"I would like to commend the citizen, for making this comment I'm sure she will take your opinion very seriously."
ModelUSGov,342tgs,IBiteYou,2,Tue Apr 28 01:29:07 2015 UTC,Thank you for praising my insight.  I commend the President and DoD on their effective actions.  Now let's turn our thoughts to evanb and those civilians who lost their lives.
ModelUSGov,342tgs,SomeRealShit,8,Tue Apr 28 20:43:49 2015 UTC,My thoughts and prayers are with /u/evanb_ and his family that he is returned home safely and those responsible are brought to justice.
ModelUSGov,342tgs,bsddc,8,Mon Apr 27 22:07:27 2015 UTC,"It is always a travesty when those who elevate themselves into the public's view in the pursuit of service, face violence. It is more than just an action against an individual, it is violence against our entire democracy. My prayers are with /u/evanb_, his family, and his friends.   I know the President will make the right choices, and I agree with the President completely, the United States of America does not negotiate with terrorists."
ModelUSGov,342tgs,bsddc,8,Mon Apr 27 23:23:42 2015 UTC,"I am glad to hear the Congressman is safe, and I thank the President and the DOD for their action.    Regrettably, 3 civilians were killed by the cartel in an attempt to escape the operation.   This is an extremely unfortunate turn of events, and I wonder how it may have transpired. Everything must be done to prevent this kind of event from happening again, and I will be calling on the House Judiciary committee to begin an investigation into the events so we can avoid it in the future."
ModelUSGov,342tgs,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,4,Tue Apr 28 02:37:47 2015 UTC,"Cartels such as these are notorious for massacring civilians and being incredibly ruthless. Unfortunately, during the strike, several of their guards resorted to their usual tactics and gunned down innocents."
ModelUSGov,342tgs,Prodigiousguy8,6,Tue Apr 28 03:01:29 2015 UTC,"I am very glad to hear that the congressman is once again safe and there were minimal casualties in the raids. My prayers are with all those affected by this senseless act of violence and terrorism. I commend the president for his decisive action, and I am relieved that this situation was resolved so quickly."
ModelUSGov,342tgs,loopmoploop,5,Tue Apr 28 02:34:48 2015 UTC,My thoughts are with /u/evanb_ and his family. Hopefully we can work to get him safely back home.
ModelUSGov,342tgs,utdude999,5,Mon Apr 27 22:53:50 2015 UTC,"I am quite glad to hear the Congressman recovered safely from the abandoned studio that they were being held hostage in. I am sorry to hear about the Congressman's injury as well as the three civilians who were killed by the cartel during the operation. I would like to give my condolences to the families of those killed and wish the Congressman a speedy recovery.  I will do everything in my power as a Senator of this state to undermine these greedy cartels who try to terrorize the population through abductions, tortures and murders. However, we cannot go about this through militarized police and the War on Drugs, which present an equally grave threat to the workers."
ModelUSGov,342tgs,Logic_85,2,Tue Apr 28 04:09:11 2015 UTC,Agreed. This is an economic problem above anything else. People typically only turn to this violent of crime when they feel they have no other options. We must try and help the government of Mexico improve their citizens lives so the next generation doesn't grow up with the same greed and hatred the cartels have.
ModelUSGov,342tgs,utdude999,11,Tue Apr 28 07:30:39 2015 UTC,"sigh  We leave the government in the hands of the GL party for one week and we've got kidnappings on American soil by drug cartels!  In all seriousness, I hope the government reacts quickly and decisively to ensure /u/evanb_'s safety."
ModelUSGov,342tgs,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,7,Mon Apr 27 21:53:34 2015 UTC,"Wow, way to take a terrible tragedy and using it as a way to attack another party. Political posturing at it's most disgusting."
ModelUSGov,342tgs,utdude999,7,Tue Apr 28 00:59:19 2015 UTC,We should all step back for a second. I'm sure /u/Logic_85 was just making a lighthearted joke and meant no offense. There's a serious topic at hand.
ModelUSGov,342tgs,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,7,Tue Apr 28 01:00:30 2015 UTC,"A lighthearted joke aimed at another party at a time like this? Completely inappropriate, I'm incredibly offended."
ModelUSGov,342tgs,Smitty9913,9,Tue Apr 28 01:15:02 2015 UTC,"As is your right. Sometimes people react to situations of extreme stress with dark humor. As the joke came from an independent who does not hold office, I wouldn't take it as seriously as if it came from a fellow Congress Representative/Senator."
ModelUSGov,342tgs,utdude999,8,Tue Apr 28 01:18:29 2015 UTC,Triggered
ModelUSGov,342tgs,Smitty9913,6,Tue Apr 28 01:27:46 2015 UTC,Well at least I can expect jokes from a person with as little empathy as you at a time like this.
ModelUSGov,342tgs,adavis2014,3,Tue Apr 28 01:30:41 2015 UTC,Those words have triggered me so hard.
ModelUSGov,342tgs,Smitty9913,5,Tue Apr 28 02:52:16 2015 UTC,Why is making fun of the concept of people who have suffered traumatic experiences becoming mentally distressed due to the recollection of them even a thing?
ModelUSGov,342tgs,adavis2014,4,Tue Apr 28 13:07:42 2015 UTC,Why would you even use that tone twords me? My friends on tumbler say that your a white misogynistic cis male. Stop oppressing me or I WILL call the police.
ModelUSGov,342tgs,Gohte,7,Tue Apr 28 13:17:38 2015 UTC,Very mature.
ModelUSGov,342tgs,Logic_85,7,Tue Apr 28 14:50:45 2015 UTC,I thought the condition of you being a wiki mod was for you to grow up a couple of years and stop making posts like this?
ModelUSGov,342tgs,adavis2014,2,Tue Apr 28 18:35:22 2015 UTC,"Let them take offense at my attempt to lightly chide the GLs with my expression of condolence. After all, as GLs, they only get to be right once in a while."
ModelUSGov,342tgs,utdude999,4,Tue Apr 28 02:21:47 2015 UTC,I try never to be right. I much prefer to be left.
ModelUSGov,342tgs,2adamstoon,3,Tue Apr 28 13:08:38 2015 UTC,"Hmmm progressive or reactionary? Yeah, I'll take the left please."
ModelUSGov,342tgs,TheRealRailguy,3,Wed Apr 29 00:32:14 2015 UTC,"On behalf of the Republican Party, we will keep /u/evanb_ and his family in our prayers, and our thoughts. We hope that the drug cartel will soon be brought to justice, and /u/evanb_ to return safely to his family and friends."
ModelUSGov,342tgs,JerryLeRow,2,Mon Apr 27 22:59:20 2015 UTC,My thoughts are with my fellow legislator and his family.  I hope him a swift recovery so that we may begin to improve the Western State.

ModelUSGov,342tgs,Logic_85,4,Tue Apr 28 07:29:32 2015 UTC,The Model Potato Lobby's Official Response on the issue
ModelUSGov,342tgs,utdude999,2,Mon Apr 27 22:19:31 2015 UTC,"This is how it starts...  No, I'm not talking about global war or a border crisis, I'm talking about bad government.  First there is an event--a tragic event such as this, and every person in the public eye notes that their thoughts and prayers are with the victim, hoping that all will return home safely.  Then the resolution--whether it be the victim's rescue or ultimate demise it matters not--those in power begin their posturing, posturing which had already began forming in the back of their minds, to use the event to promote their agenda.  Sure, they say that they never want anyone else to suffer as the victim suffered, and no one is willing to call them out on it, because you can't measure sympathy with a yardstick.  All we have are words, and we trust those words.  Over time, the victim becomes a catch-phrase, a recital, an ""Alamo.""  A loss that represents the chance to make gains in another area.  A loss that provided a means to push that agenda.  ""Never again,"" they will say.  They will push for reforms and bills and laws and resolutions and pressure any dissenter with the name of the victim, and those in power will have the opportunity to pressure their agenda, unmolested, through the three layers of government.  It will take years to recover, years to undo what is done, if ever.  No one will ever be able to prove it was good or bad, because both sides will claim victory with ""the numbers,"" without thinking about the lives ruined, lost, or destroyed in the wake of the changes.  I hope we all remember this as we move forward.  Fear those that use this event as political fodder."
ModelUSGov,342tgs,Logic_85,2,Tue Apr 28 16:31:47 2015 UTC,"Says the person who literally used it as political fodder within hours of it happening. You should be ashamed of yourself, you hypocrite."
ModelUSGov,342tgs,utdude999,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:22:02 2015 UTC,"Yep. I used it to pass bad legislation and gain power. Not make light of a bad situation and express my condolences at all. Shame on me.   People in this sub need to learn the difference between humor and politics, and generally pull their heads out. (Oddly enough, it always seems to be the greens that can't tell the difference.)"
ModelUSGov,342tgs,Logic_85,2,Wed Apr 29 04:07:16 2015 UTC,Learn the rules of the sub and remove your unprofessional language please.
ModelUSGov,342tgs,utdude999,2,Wed Apr 29 04:08:44 2015 UTC,I stand by my statement.
ModelUSGov,342tgs,risen2011,2,Wed Apr 29 05:27:55 2015 UTC,"Kid, I realized you were making a joke. I was offended because you were making a joke. I believe it was not the time for joking, it was time to be supportive of one of our own. So there's no need to be so rude and aggressive towards me and my party."
ModelUSGov,342tgs,Smitty9913,2,Wed Apr 29 05:37:59 2015 UTC,Please remove inappropriate language from your post.    This is your first warning.
ModelUSGov,340vy0,SeptimusSette,15,Mon Apr 27 12:46:24 2015 UTC,"Which areas does this bill seek recognize? There are many areas which Somaliland has used its armed forces to illegally occupy territory and remove the population, through death or by force, that do not wish to be under Somaliland rule. States like Sanaag and Cayn.   In Sanaag, on June 12th, 2014, Somaliland troops illegally entered towns, rounded up elders and other locals who were against Sanaag joining Somaliliand. They wanted to reduce the majority to the minority and have done so.  In Cayn, May 15th, 2010, Somaliland troops entered the region to put down any opposition to the upcoming illegal Somaliland elections in the area(The area is claimed by multiple governments). This armed operation ended with an official 13 dead and 33 wounded.   I find it interesting this bill would take such actions when the Somaliland government has shown that it will take any action necessary, even against international law, to make sure the population agrees with it.  I also find it interesting that anyone would consider the referendum that was held to be valid. There was only 10 observers from the Initiative & Referendum institute which managed to visit a whole 57 of the 600 polling stations. Not even 10% of the polling stations were verified, and somehow this makes the referendum valid.  I think this bill would great if a referendum were held today, under international UN observation, however even then, the Somaliland government has shown it will use whatever means it has to in order to ensure its survival, even if that means murdering men and women to do so.  I would urge all members who are considering voting for this bill to consider the outcome. You will be rewarding a government who uses fear and its own armed forces to control the population.   You will be removing womens rights in an area dominated by Sharia law (Somalia amended its constitution in 2012 and it guaranteed equal rights to people of all genders. These rights supersede any laws under the Islamic code that would discriminate against women.)      In Somoliland, the constitutional section on equal rights reads like this .  ""All citizens of Somaliland shall enjoy equal rights and obligations before the law, and shall not be accorded precedence on grounds of colour, clan, birth, language, gender, property, status, opinion etc.""  This means that women will have the rights afforded to them by sharia law. While I will not go into it here, most people know how oppressive Sharia law is too women, and how they are not considered equal to men.  These are just some of the dangers of voting for this bill and recognizing Somaliland. I would urge all members to vote NAY on this bill, and instead to put forth a bill that would see America provide support for UN Peacekeeping efforts and to increase efforts that would bring Somalia together and help it get out of the endless cycle of violence."
ModelUSGov,340vy0,Canadianman22,5,Mon Apr 27 14:44:54 2015 UTC,"Hear hear! Should this bill be sent to the House I will be seeking an Amendment to address the concerns of the Vice-President Emeritus, and to make the recognition contingent on the African Union recognizing Somaliland."

ModelUSGov,340vy0,rangerheart0,4,Mon Apr 27 22:51:31 2015 UTC,"I would like to point out that historically our recognition of states has not been contingent on their human rights abuses. This isn't a good thing, but it is something to think about in the future."
ModelUSGov,340vy0,Canadianman22,2,Tue Apr 28 01:06:04 2015 UTC,I think this would be a good opportunity to make that change for the better Mr.President.
ModelUSGov,340vy0,rangerheart0,3,Tue Apr 28 01:14:26 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I certainly think that our recognition of states, as well as our foreign aid should be contingent on their human rights record."
ModelUSGov,340vy0,Canadianman22,2,Tue Apr 28 01:15:31 2015 UTC,"I applaud you Mr. President for this decision, and it is refreshing to see a President who will take the moral high ground in all situations."

ModelUSGov,340vy0,oughton42,8,Mon Apr 27 16:58:33 2015 UTC,"It looks as if my Party and I disagree on this issue. While I firmly believe in the democratic process and the right of the people to choose, I could only support the recognition of Somaliland if there was some assurance that their government would work towards greater equality, particularly for women.  Furthermore, should we recognize such a state when there is still significant oppposition within the proposed borders? If we claim to support the will of the people, shall we ignore those people within Somaliland that do not recognize it, or will secede if it is ever recognized?  I think simply recognizing Somaliland as a sovereign nation is too blunt a move -- not thought out enough. I believe that in this case, it is better to wait; if progress is made and some closer nations choose to recognize Somaliland, then we can work towards recognition here in the U.S."
ModelUSGov,340vy0,vidurnaktis,6,Mon Apr 27 15:01:24 2015 UTC,"I'm on board with you on this one. While I think it would be prudent to recognise a functionally independent state I also think that state should make guarantees to improve conditions for all living there.   While I understand that some of our comrades wish to move quickly on the matter, the truth is is that patience will more likely create a better situation."
ModelUSGov,340vy0,Canadianman22,5,Mon Apr 27 15:28:59 2015 UTC,Hear Hear!!! I addressed the very same concerns you did in another post here. I am glad to see some members of the GLP have seen this to be a bad idea.
ModelUSGov,340vy0,risen2011,7,Mon Apr 27 15:45:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if 97% of people living in the region want to have an independent state, then it shall be granted to them. A vote against this bill is a vote against democracy!   I will be voting aye.  Edit: After reading about the human rights situation in Somaliland, I will be reconsidering my vote taking both self-determination AND the human rights situation into account."
ModelUSGov,340vy0,Canadianman22,6,Mon Apr 27 13:08:13 2015 UTC,"I am glad to see you have reconsidered your support. For people who want to bring peace to the area, recognizing Somaliland is not the correct way to do this, especially with the human rights violations."
ModelUSGov,340vy0,bsddc,9,Mon Apr 27 17:28:34 2015 UTC,"While I really do appreciate that this bill is being sent to the Congress, not through executive action, I must rise moderately against it.   Strange as it may seem, I think the bill submitted by the Green-Left, is too imperialist. And I implore you to hear me out.   We are imposing our own opinion into a situation where it doesn't belong. Somalia has claimed Somaliland in their most recent Constitution, while Somaliland has a significant group of people wishing to leave.   This is not a matter for us to decide, but instead we should wait to see how Africa and the people of both regions come to settle this before we jump in with a Western ideal of how this situation should be handled."
ModelUSGov,340vy0,risen2011,3,Mon Apr 27 14:33:40 2015 UTC,I'd be on board with your amendment...

ModelUSGov,340vy0,risen2011,4,Mon Apr 27 15:25:47 2015 UTC,"I was actually writing it up myself! It contains a change to the enactment clause to only take effect as soon as the AU recognizes Somaliland, hopefully, that will give them time to sort out the various issues regarding Somaliland."

ModelUSGov,340vy0,Canadianman22,3,Mon Apr 27 12:47:14 2015 UTC,I can't see why there wouldn't be quad-partisan support of this.

If we recognize Somaliland, then why not Liberland, Sealand or all the other micronations? We have to draw a line somewhere.  We can, however, provide humanitarian assistance not only to Somaliland, but to entire Somalia, advise it how to get rid of anarchy, pirates etc., set up a democracy and a working gov."
ModelUSGov,340vy0,evanb_,4,Mon Apr 27 15:31:30 2015 UTC,"If we recognize Somaliland, then why not Liberland, Sealand or all the other micronations?   Because Somaliland is not a micronation; it's an actual government with an actual jurisdiction and actual authority. It's completely different from those libertarian utopias."
ModelUSGov,340vy0,utdude999,3,Mon Apr 27 16:05:04 2015 UTC,"Well, the both I mentioned actually do have some sort of government. Considering Somalia in general is said to be an anarchy, I'm not sure if they actually have a better gov than Liberland :D  Apart from that: How can we recognize a state that does not have official borders?"
ModelUSGov,340vy0,Logic_85,3,Mon Apr 27 16:18:06 2015 UTC,"Sealand's ""government"" is literally a joke. So is Liberland's. There's a difference between micronations and unrecognized nation-states."

ModelUSGov,340vy0,Logic_85,3,Mon Apr 27 17:09:33 2015 UTC,"I am curious why you are supporting the ""government"" that would see the end of womens rights. Under the Somali constitution, all peoples, regardless of gender, race or religion are given equal rights that no law can discriminate against, while in Somaliland, womens are given rights based on Sharia law. Do you realize that you are supporting this?"
ModelUSGov,340vy0,bsddc,2,Mon Apr 27 16:50:29 2015 UTC,"I didn't know that recognizing the right of governments to self-determination means supporting the exploitation in those governments. By that logic, I wouldn't recognize any nation-states that exist today besides DPRK and Cuba.   Somaliland has a functioning government whereas Somalia does not. It doesn't have to do with their constitutions or the amount of perceived equality in those nations. The Somali constitution means nothing if the government that abides by it is confined to only several city blocks."
ModelUSGov,340vy0,Logic_85,2,Mon Apr 27 18:00:23 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recognize any nation-states that exist today besides DPRK and Cuba   The fact you outright support the tyrannical regime of the DPRK should be shocking, but unfortunately is not.  I respectfully suggest you review the referendum that was held. The armed militias were used to round up and remove anyone who was opposed to Somaliland. 10 observers were used, visiting 56 of the 600 polling stations, less than 10% of the stations were visited. That referendum is not legally recognized, which is why no government on earth recognizes it."

We can discuss the DPRK if/when the bill discussed is about the DPRK. The current topic is not that, though, so let's stay on the current topic, shall we?   I respectfully suggest you review the referendum that was held. The armed militias were used to round up and remove anyone who was opposed to Somaliland. 10 observers were used, visiting 56 of the 600 polling stations, less than 10% of the stations were visited. That referendum is not legally recognized, which is why no government on earth recognizes it.   For the sake of objectivity, here is the whole quote:   A team of ten observers from the Initiative and Referendum Institute observed the referendum. They were only able to visit 57 of the 600 polling stations and avoided the Sool region entirely due to security concerns. However, in those stations recorded they reported that the referendum was open, fair, peaceful and any fraud was rare and insignificant. [2] Nothing is known about the quality of the rest.   There doesn't seem to be anything to suggest that the rest of the polling stations would've found more suspicious activity or not. Flawed as it is, Somaliland is the closest that that region of Somalia will get to self-determination. I dare say it has a more democratic mandate than some of the nations currently recognized by the United States."
ModelUSGov,340vy0,Logic_85,2,Mon Apr 27 18:25:01 2015 UTC,"We can discuss the DPRK if/when the bill discussed is about the DPRK. The current topic is not that, though, so let's stay on the current topic, shall we?   You brought it up, I simply responded with a small comment and moved on.  As for your suggestion, regardless of what they found at stations they pre-arranged to visit, it does not meet the international requirements for a referendum. If another one was done, under UN oversight, following proper guidelines, and this time the government did not use its armed forces to suppress the population and prevent them from voting simply because they would vote a different way, I would fully be on board with it.   However, they have not done so, and to this day still use their army to quash any and all dissenting opinions. As recently as June of last year, the army swooped in to towns, and people ended up dead, as I mentioned in my other post here."
ModelUSGov,340vy0,bsddc,2,Mon Apr 27 18:45:10 2015 UTC,"I do recognize that the government of Somaliland is flawed, as I said in my earlier response. And there might be very severe human rights violations, I haven't read up on that much. But that's not the point. Unless you're arguing that the people of this territory are provided greater self-determination under Somalia than Somaliland, which clearly isn't the case given that the Somali government has little to no authority in that region, Somaliland needs to be recognized as a sovereign government."

As far as I know, the Constitution grants the power to recognize foreign governments through the ""treaty"" clause to the President.  Congress has no such power, except to regulate commerce with foreign governments (and this is a far cry from commerce).  We have seen how the Congress has attempted to abuse this power with its ""open letter"" to Iran in the recent weeks, decried by all as a gross violation of their constitutional reach, and this bill is no different.  This bill is an unconstitutional act by the Congress and unless they can explain how or why they should be granted to power to regulate foreign affairs when the President of the United States is living and breathing, it should not be passed."
ModelUSGov,340vy0,SomeRealShit,3,Mon Apr 27 20:27:35 2015 UTC,I don't see why this a bill and not a joint resolution.

Maybe they will surprise us all in the next few years if Zivotofsky ever comes back, but until then all we have to rely on is ""expert"" analysis.  Check out this one:  http://www.cqpress.com/incontext/constitution/docs/constitutional_powers.html  It admits recognition isn't specifically given to anyone, but that it emmanates from other Presidential powers (such as appointment of ambassadors, etc).  We also have our historical record: FDR recognized Russia in 1933, in 1948 it was Truman for Israel.  This act we have before us is HIGHLY irregular."

ModelUSGov,33xjk6,Hlafward,2,Sun Apr 26 23:56:36 2015 UTC,"I figured that would be the biggest issue. You could always do something bizarre, like setting the spam filter to ""all"" and having an automod bot approve all comments from a list of submitters, but that would be complicated and very prone to glitches.   We could petition the admins for an ""approved commenter"" feature like the ""approved submitter"" feature, but I doubt we're relevant enough for anything to come of it."

ModelUSGov,33xjk6,2adamstoon,3,Fri May 1 08:05:12 2015 UTC,Any ideas on how the special interests/lobbying is going to work?
ModelUSGov,33xjk6,evanb_,5,Sun Apr 26 17:48:05 2015 UTC,Probably one of the top priorities for the sub right now. I'm very open to suggestions.
ModelUSGov,33xjk6,SeptimusSette,5,Sun Apr 26 17:49:16 2015 UTC,"The power of lobbyists lies in their ability to influence the outcome of elections. For each election we have, special interests could be given a certain amount of votes that they can cast to top up the popular vote for candidates they endorse.   eg, Candidate A is on 17 votes, while Candidate B is on 15, but candidate B is endorsed by the Potato Lobby who top him up by 3, so B wins the election.  It gives the candidates a good reason to appease special interests, just like IRL politicians. The lobbyists could have enough votes to influence the election slightly (like 3-5), but not enough to make a mockery of the popular vote."
ModelUSGov,33xjk6,jsmith18486,3,Sun Apr 26 18:08:55 2015 UTC,I think the role of lobbyists should be as it is now: to influence voters and support candidates through campaigning.
ModelUSGov,33xjk6,jsmith18486,1 point,Sun Apr 26 21:09:09 2015 UTC,Currently lobbyists have no role in the simulation.

ModelUSGov,33xjk6,SeptimusSette,2,Sun Apr 26 22:06:17 2015 UTC,Interesting concept.
ModelUSGov,33xjk6,Logic_85,3,Sun Apr 26 18:10:14 2015 UTC,"Another idea could be that lobbyists influence where advertising can be done or the amount of advertising. So if someone is endorsed by environmentalists, they can advertise in related subs, for example."
ModelUSGov,33xjk6,SomeOfTheTimes,3,Sun Apr 26 22:25:21 2015 UTC,I like this idea.

English is not an official language of the United States. I see no reason this should be a requirement and would like to see it amended out of this bill.  Furthermore, why are we only granting permanent residence and not full citizenship for those willing to die for our country?"
ModelUSGov,33v69c,laffytaffyboy,10,Sat Apr 25 23:54:27 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure being able to read write and speak basic English is a requirement for citizenship although I could be wrong. Just to be clear, I am against this but it is what it is right now."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,NateLooney,6,Sun Apr 26 00:06:21 2015 UTC,"I'm close to submitting an amendment that should take care of this anyway, but it would be nice if we could work on changing it starting now.   I'm off to go finalize that amendment now."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,laffytaffyboy,6,Sun Apr 26 00:14:18 2015 UTC,"It would be rather difficult for a group of non-English speakers, who would likely speak a diverse range of languages, to be very useful to the military in a combat situation without a battalion of interpreters."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,Prospo,5,Sun Apr 26 00:16:10 2015 UTC,"Government and military operations are generally conducted in english, knowing the language is necessary for their service.  But the citizenship vs. Residency question is a good one."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,TheRealRailguy,2,Sun Apr 26 00:13:27 2015 UTC,"It being necessary for service is one thing, but there's no reason the bill should have it as a requirement. If they can't serve without understanding english, then this doesn't apply to people who can't speak it to begin with.   I see no reason individual soldiers should be required to speak english. As long as the group out on a mission can communicate with each other and the leader can understand orders received in english, why does the specific language they use to communicate amongst themselves matter?"
ModelUSGov,33v69c,laffytaffyboy,8,Sun Apr 26 00:20:23 2015 UTC,Ate you kidding me? You don't think that solders need to to know the same lauguage? That's the most rediculous things I've very seen in my life. Tell me how that would be able to work?
ModelUSGov,33v69c,Smitty9913,4,Sun Apr 26 15:30:37 2015 UTC,"So what happens when the lieutenant is the only one in the platoon who understands English and then relays orders in Spanish to his platoon and then he dies in combat and the captain runs over and yells an order at them and they say, ""No comprendemos""?"

For example, when the leader gets shot and the other members of the squad need to call in a medivac.."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,houinator,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:09:58 2015 UTC,"Just the leader is obviously dangerous do to lack of redundancy, (I over exaggerated, I apologize.) but what if say, half of the group was bilingual and the rest spoke the same non-english language? Bilingual coms operators would also provide extra redundancy."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,laffytaffyboy,3,Mon Apr 27 03:22:56 2015 UTC,"section 328 and 329 of the Immigration and Nationality Act   Deal with granting citizenship to non-citizens who join our military, it's a special channel above and beyond that granted to normal permanent residents that basically ensures citizenship after a period of military service.  I didn't want to create a channel for undocumented immigrants that would give them benefits not received by other non-Americans already seeking to earn citizenship through military service.  This just ensures that those brought into the country illegally as minors have the same options."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,houinator,3,Sun Apr 26 00:40:58 2015 UTC,"Okay, so from what I've gathered from a quick 10 second google of ""section 328 and 329 of the Immigration and Nationality Act"" is that this bill grants them residence immediately upon joining the armed forces, after a year they fill out a few forms, somebody verifies that they served ""one year of honorable military service during peacetime​ or honorable service during a designated period of hostility"" and at that point they become naturalized. Does that sound correct?"
ModelUSGov,33v69c,laffytaffyboy,4,Sun Apr 26 00:53:31 2015 UTC,"Also notice that the existing law has the ""Be able to read, write, and speak basic English"" provision, which I have aligned my bill with so as not to grant an unfair advantage to undocumented immigrants."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,houinator,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:04:21 2015 UTC,"If I understand this correctly, undocumented immigrants would still have to go through the existing law after this one, so, even if it was left out, it would not give them any advantage. Leaving it out would allow them to become permanent residents, but not citizens. Personally I would prefer that. With it excluded you allow them time to learn English without the threat of deportation, then become citizens."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,laffytaffyboy,2,Sun Apr 26 01:21:08 2015 UTC,Correct.  Which is largely the same as what my bill does for undocumented immigrants.
ModelUSGov,33v69c,houinator,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:01:44 2015 UTC,"Okay, that sounds reasonable then."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,laffytaffyboy,3,Sun Apr 26 01:21:01 2015 UTC,"I would also like to add that the requirement for ""basic"" English is neither morally or scientifically sound. As there is no such thing as ""basic"" English. There is a standard English, or rather multiple, but no one speaks that natively, and if these folks were brought up here they'd most likely be speaking a dialectal form.    Really this bill only guarantees a path to citizenship for a small number of upper-class immigrants, that is those with the means to learn the Standard and exclusionary towards poorer immigrants who should have just as much opportunity."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,vidurnaktis,6,Sun Apr 26 15:16:26 2015 UTC,I think this is a good bill that should get support from all sides in Congress.
ModelUSGov,33v69c,DidNotKnowThatLolz,8,Sun Apr 26 01:33:25 2015 UTC,"This is a step towards making sure that those immigrants who will provide a valuable service have an advantage in the naturalization process, and strengthening our military by enlisting some of the most patriotic and dedicated individuals this country boasts – those who seek self-improvement by coming to the land of opportunity.   I applaud /u/Houinator for its submission."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,evanb_,5,Sun Apr 26 00:13:03 2015 UTC,I support this completely. It is a good immigration bill.

ModelUSGov,33v69c,houinator,5,Sun Apr 26 00:47:21 2015 UTC,"Section 2: Applicants for this program must meet the following qualifications: Must have entered the country prior to the age of 18, have resided in the country for at least five years, must have no felony convictions, be able to speak/read/write basic English.   5 years consecutively? Also define basic English levels, e.g. A2. Same in Section 4, though I doubt translators -who must be able to speak both languages fluently - lack basic English knowledge.   Section 6: The Department of Justice shall have the power to set and collect application fees in order to meet the funding requirements for enacting this law.   Don't make immigration an issue of money. Set maximum fees, the rest should be covered by the gov. We fund way more senseless stuff, and people who might be to poor to pay the fees at the date of their application may be intelligent, hard working people who add perfectly to the rest of our working population - the backbone of the country."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,JerryLeRow,5,Sun Apr 26 11:02:19 2015 UTC,"5 years consecutively?   It does not need to have been consecutively.  Going back to your home country for a few months to visit family shouldn't reset the clock.   Also define basic English levels   I'm using the same definition already in place for non-citizens who want to join the military to earn citizenship, so they would just fall in on the existing standard.  Ultimately, they are going to need to have a basic level of English proficiency to serve in the military regardless.   Set maximum fees, the rest should be covered by the gov.   I oppose adding more money to the national debt in most scenarios, and this seems like the best funding mechanism to prevent that from happening, and again is largely in line with the process for current immigrants, who also have to pay fees to have their paperwork processed."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,houinator,9,Sun Apr 26 12:57:32 2015 UTC,Why residency? Why not citizenship? We are allowing them to fight for a our country then not making them full members?
ModelUSGov,33v69c,cameronc65,6,Sat Apr 25 23:51:18 2015 UTC,"Ultimately my intent here was to make it so people do not jump to the head of the citizenship line over those who have been following the rules and waiting their turn.  Once they are permanent residents, then they can sit in that line like every other immigrant, without fear of being deported."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,houinator,6,Sun Apr 26 00:34:21 2015 UTC,That makes a lot of sense actually. I didn't think of that.
ModelUSGov,33v69c,dreasdif118,3,Sun Apr 26 00:43:04 2015 UTC,"I agree that it should be citizenship instead of residency. But, for Section 5 it should be residencies for the family not citizenships.  Edit: I will still vote for the bill no matter if it is or isn't amended to say citizenship."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,dreasdif118,3,Sun Apr 26 00:01:27 2015 UTC,"These immigrants still need to go through the citizenship process, regardless of their heroism abroad."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,Prospo,4,Sun Apr 26 00:18:05 2015 UTC,"If they've been here since before they were 18, for five years, can read/write/speak English, and served in the military, why do they need to go through the citizenship process? That seems like a fair enough process already."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,cameronc65,3,Sun Apr 26 00:23:45 2015 UTC,"Then they already fill many of the requirements for citizenship, but they still need to take a citizenship test, to have been physically present in the United States (according to the current rules for permanent residents), and take an oath of allegiance (though this too has likely already been carried out during their service) to be citizens."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,Prospo,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:42:13 2015 UTC,Ever hear of the French Foreign Legion?
ModelUSGov,33v69c,keypuncher,1 point,Mon Apr 27 07:01:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is not the same."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,cameronc65,7,Mon Apr 27 11:02:50 2015 UTC,"I must say, and I seem to be in the minority here, that I find this bill disgusting. Giving only joining the army with a chance to die without ever becoming a citizen or going through a ridiculously rigorous testing regime is preposterous. What about any illegal 7th Day Adventists who wish to become citizens? Any other illegal pacifists?"
ModelUSGov,33v69c,utdude999,6,Sun Apr 26 01:39:06 2015 UTC,This is about recognizing the life-threatening (and life-saving) work people have done and are doing in service of this country. This is not jingoism.
ModelUSGov,33v69c,Prospo,3,Mon Apr 27 02:18:27 2015 UTC,Agreed.  And military service can help ensure these people are better equipped to find their places in the labor mark when they decide to leave the military.
ModelUSGov,33v69c,kilgore_trout87,2,Mon Apr 27 04:17:52 2015 UTC,Why not make citizenship based on labor worked within the country? How is that less valuable than military service?
ModelUSGov,33v69c,utdude999,3,Mon Apr 27 05:08:32 2015 UTC,"Most people voluntarily work (in order to be able to eat, afford housing, etc.) most people do not volunteer to serve in the military.  Also, most jobs in the U.S. military in at least some way benefit the U.S.  The same can't be said of most jobs in general; most jobs benefit multinational corporations."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,kilgore_trout87,3,Mon Apr 27 05:25:07 2015 UTC,"While I don't disagree that most labor is exploitative, I think there are plenty enough immigrants who labor in this country to benefit the US (farming, most notably) to warrant some sort of pacifist equivalent to this."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,marxandlennon,2,Mon Apr 27 07:03:31 2015 UTC,"But the thing is, labor is pretty much the reason they migrate to the U.S.  ""You want to become a U.S. citizen so that you can work in the U.S? Great! Just work in the U.S. after illegally migrating here and we'll make you a citizen!""  To me, offering citizenship to undocumented workers just because they're doing work seems more than a little absurd. It would also encourage more illegal immigration, which I don't think is generally good for American workers."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,kilgore_trout87,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:18:59 2015 UTC,"Well we disagree, fundamentally, on what the American military's role in the world is. I mean what, are we gonna round up illegals and say sign up in the army or get shipped off? That disgusts me. And the other road to being a legal citizen is so full of red tape and ridiculous hurdles, of course the military is gonna be more appealing. Then we're just gonna end up with more vets, more PTSD, more suicide. I can't see anyway to change this bill that will get me to vote aye."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,utdude999,3,Mon Apr 27 02:29:27 2015 UTC,"There are other branches than the army.  While I generally disagree with your take on the bill, I am curious whether this bill could be extended to those willing to serve in the Peace Corps."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,kilgore_trout87,3,Mon Apr 27 04:16:16 2015 UTC,That's a good idea. I would prefer if there was a pacifist option available. Not everyone is as open to violence as some.
ModelUSGov,33v69c,utdude999,2,Mon Apr 27 04:21:52 2015 UTC,"I like the idea, but it's worth noting that Peace Corps volunteer eligibility currently requires US citizenship, so any amendment would have to take that into account."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,marxandlennon,6,Mon Apr 27 07:04:22 2015 UTC,"Hear, hear!  I believe this bill feeds into the exact kinds of militarism and jingoism we should be fighting against. While I respect those, immigrant or otherwise, who serve in the U.S. military, we should not be actively promoting this as the preferred path to citizenship. Immigrants can be just as helpful in civilian roles: doctors, engineers, artists, etc.  I think we need to be looking to make the process of acquiring citizenship easier for all immigrants, not just those who sign up to serve the state."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,adavis2014,4,Sun Apr 26 03:23:45 2015 UTC,Glad we agree on this one. I hope our G/L brothers realize the imperialism this could lead to.
ModelUSGov,33v69c,utdude999,7,Sun Apr 26 03:33:11 2015 UTC,"This is a great point. Incentivizing military service, when other means of citizenship that are much more beneficial to our social fabric fall by the wayside is neglectful at best and malicious at worst."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,cameronc65,2,Sun Apr 26 05:29:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I'm glad I'm not the only one that this makes uneasy. It seems wrong to keep our current atrocious citizen process as-is, and instead tell immigrants that they must put their life on the line for a country not willing to accept them in any other way."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,oughton42,3,Sun Apr 26 19:49:36 2015 UTC,This is a great bill and something that I fully support.
ModelUSGov,33v69c,tiocer,2,Sun Apr 26 18:13:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with this mostly, but there are some things I would amend, I will et back to this when I'm not on mobile."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,kingofquave,3,Sun Apr 26 01:15:34 2015 UTC,"Off topic, did you receive my PM?"
ModelUSGov,33v69c,utdude999,2,Sun Apr 26 01:32:41 2015 UTC,"I did, I'm sorry that I didn't respond. I've been busy with projects and papers/stuck on mobile for the past week, so my reddit time has been limited, but tomorrow and from then on I should be good."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,kingofquave,3,Sun Apr 26 01:39:25 2015 UTC,"No worries, I'm almost always on mobile so I was just making sure it got through."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,utdude999,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:48:29 2015 UTC,"If I may ask, why did you vote against the bill?  You said you had some things you wanted to ammend, but then you didn't post anything else here or in the amendment thread."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,houinator,1 point,Tue May 5 03:20:48 2015 UTC,I voted nay because I felt that fixing our immigration system by giving people this option was not the best solution. We need to create a simple path to citizenship instead.
ModelUSGov,33v69c,kingofquave,2,Tue May 5 21:03:47 2015 UTC,"The citizenship question would be a perfect way to test out the new amendment process!   On a separate note, will the newly elected leaders' flairs be changed?"
ModelUSGov,33v69c,risen2011,2,Sun Apr 26 19:18:31 2015 UTC,"Secure the border first.  When you make a law like this without securing the border, you give incentive for people to illegally come in hopes that their child can join the military and be a citizen.  Then you have people in the military who really don't want to be there...they are just doing it for citizenship."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,IBiteYou,1 point,Mon Apr 27 06:52:50 2015 UTC,"I think that's a bit of a reach, honestly. Someone's really going to brave the trek through the desert, possible kidnappings, crappy working conditions, just so maybe their kid can join the Army? As for ""people in the military who really don't want to be there,"" isn't finding and minimizing those people (to the point of discharge, even) the point of basic training? Even if not, the notion in itself seems like a stretch again. Go through basic, get shipped off to whatever country we're fighting today, risk getting a limb shredded by an IED or whatever just for citizenship? It seems almost paranoiac to be worried about that; and honestly if you sign up for all that you're alright in my book anyway."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,marxandlennon,3,Mon Apr 27 07:00:13 2015 UTC,We might not be fighting any country at all... and my view isn't changed.  Making laws legalizing illegals before we have used every means at our disposal to secure our borders is only going to incentivize people coming here illegally.
ModelUSGov,33v69c,IBiteYou,1 point,Mon Apr 27 07:15:58 2015 UTC,"I think the unemployment rate in Central America and the massive amount of drug war-related violence is doing significantly more to incentivize illegal immigration than the dim hope of maybe possibly having your kid become a soldier who lives long enough and jumps through the correct hoops to become a citizen. Are you for an end to granting citizenship to children born here as well? Because to me that seems like a far easier path than this bill.   That said, what are your solutions to securing the border, then?"
ModelUSGov,33v69c,marxandlennon,2,Mon Apr 27 07:28:37 2015 UTC,"The rates of murder in the worst areas in Central America are on par with Chicago.  We can't employ the people we have now.  Bleeding-heart liberals want porous borders at the same time that they scream about urban sprawl and overpopulation.  It makes no sense.  Where do you put all the people?   Are you for an end to granting citizenship to children born here as well?   I proposed a bill in the past session of Congress that said if at least one of your parents is not a legal resident at the time of your birth in the USA you should not be a citizen.   That said, what are your solutions to securing the border, then?   Wall where possible.  Guard posts.  Drones.  The new technologies that are available."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,IBiteYou,1 point,Mon Apr 27 08:05:10 2015 UTC,"1) True, but you can move out of Chicago to the suburbs or wherever you like - and Americans are. You can't just move out of Nicaragua. The crucial point, though, is that Central America is a less attractive place to live than the US by almost any quality of life measure.  2) We could, I think, with different economic policies, but that's a different debate.  3) You realize that this is a zero-sum game, right? If one person leaves Mexico to come to the US, we don't add one person to the global population. In any event, overpopulation isn't the problem so much as overuse of resources. Conservatives like to blame the third-world poor for these problems, when the top earners in any wealthy nation consume as much as any ten of them.   4) Well, at least you're consistent, I'll give you that. I'm new here and haven't had time to read through all the past legislation.   5) This has to be my favorite hand-wave of all, though. You're the Senate Minority Leader! Give me a real proposal, not ""the new technologies that are available."" Show me the cost. A quick googling showed the cost of fencing alone would be an average of 3.9 million per mile, or (3,900,000*1,933mi) 7.5 billion dollars for the border. Add in the guards, the drones, the ""new technologies""...what's the price tag on this? Just as important, what are the civil liberty costs? We've just come out of the PATRIOT ACT days, are we now going to stop every US citizen entering or leaving by the Mexico border? How many cars do you propose we search? How will we decide who gets searched? We're going to militarize the border with a friendly country because...what? Some people actually do believe that the US is the greatest country on the planet, and are willing to bet their lives and fortunes on it? Why don't we want those people?  And, to top it off, illegal immigration is down anyway"
ModelUSGov,33v69c,marxandlennon,1 point,Mon Apr 27 09:09:15 2015 UTC,"True, but you can move out of Chicago to the suburbs or wherever you like....   1) No.  There are many people there trapped in poverty.   The crucial point, though, is that Central America is a less attractive place to live than the US by almost any quality of life measure.   1) It's crucial... but not for the reason you think.  There are MANY places on the globe that are less attractive to live than the USA.  We cannot accept everyone from those nations.  We don't have the jobs.  We don't have the resources.  2) Can't argue against something you conceded.  3) You utterly dodged my point.  When liberals decry overuse of resources, urban sprawl and overpopulation ... where do we put all of the people who want to come here and stay because conditions are worse in their countries?  Yellowstone?  5)  No one is saying that securing the border will not cost money...but we put men on the moon, so don't tell me we can't secure our own borders and enforce our immigration laws.  When Reagan did the amnesty in 86, the Democrats promised a secure border and they reneged on the promise.   are we now going to stop every US citizen entering or leaving by the Mexico border?   When I traveled with my college debate team to Canada, our van was stopped and we were questioned.  It wasn't much of a thing.   We're going to militarize the border with a friendly country because...what?    Because it's our border?  Because people have shot at our border guards from the other side of it?  Because we want to stem the tide of illegal immgration?  All of these seem reasonable to me.   Why don't we want those people?   Oh good grief.  You should have said you were an open borders proponent from the beginning.  You would have saved my breath.  Your chart is wrong:  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/23/chart-of-the-day-is-illegal-immigration-on-the-rise-again/  We recently saw a surge of illegals over the border and trucked and trained and flown to all areas of the country.  Many of them have not show up to immigration hearings."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,IBiteYou,3,Mon Apr 27 09:34:10 2015 UTC,"Section 4 is very important, but how can we judge good moral character?"
ModelUSGov,33v69c,richhomieram,5,Sat Apr 25 23:45:27 2015 UTC,"The DoD must sign off on it.  Basically, if there is nothing derogatory in their record (negative counselings, indications that they were sympathetic to terrorism, harassment of other DoD employees, etc...), then the DoD would have no reason to claim they did not have good moral character."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,houinator,7,Sun Apr 26 00:32:42 2015 UTC,"This not legally sound enough. Determining ""good moral character"" seems like a duty that would filtered off to some underling in its current vague form, and result in extreme bias in some cases.  For example, what if a transphobic individual was hired to determine ""good moral character,"" and used his position to keep trans people out of the country because he saw them as immoral?"
ModelUSGov,33v69c,houinator,5,Sun Apr 26 00:40:28 2015 UTC,I'm certainly open to clarifying that section.
ModelUSGov,33v69c,Gohte,7,Sun Apr 26 00:52:38 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to ask that you do. I definitely like this bill, but that needs clarification before I'm comfortable giving it my aye."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,houinator,3,Sun Apr 26 01:37:36 2015 UTC,"Also, I would point out that the existing law for non-citizens to join the military uses the same ""good moral character"" phraseology.  So if we are going to change it, we should probably amend section 328 and 329 of the Immigration and Nationality Act at the same time."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,Xarasystral,4,Sun Apr 26 01:31:19 2015 UTC,I would never be able to vote yea to a bill with such a provision.
ModelUSGov,33v69c,houinator,2,Sun Apr 26 00:14:41 2015 UTC,"Why do they have to be currently attending a higher education institution? Would it not be acceptable for them to just join immediately out of grade school? Besides, military service usually allows for higher education whilst enlisted, do they not? This could be a secondary benefit for these people: They receive the ability to legally remain in our country as well as become educated while serving the interests of our great country."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,Xarasystral,5,Sun Apr 26 03:06:57 2015 UTC,"No, there are two separate options.  Anyone can join using the process in Section 1, regardless of their education status (though they will likely need at least a GED or high school diploma to meet the military's requirements).  People attending an institution of higher education can also use the process in Section 3, in order to stabilize their legal status while they finish school.  The intent here was not to incentivise people dropping out of school, and also create a pipeline for generating qualified officers."
ModelUSGov,33v69c,1sagas1,3,Sun Apr 26 13:02:42 2015 UTC,"I see that now, thank you."

What about people in other parties? I know /u/A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS is not a GL but he has proven to be knowledgeable in his position of Sec. of Homeland Security and would undoubtedly make a good Secretary of Defense.

ModelUSGov,33u1nh,Didicet,4,Sat Apr 25 19:24:38 2015 UTC,"In fact, you didn't ask for Democrats in general. You wanted a single socdem candidate for a single cabinet position.  Here's the correspondence in question: http://i.imgur.com/4F9FqO3.png"
ModelUSGov,33u1nh,zombiesingularity,3,Sat Apr 25 20:47:09 2015 UTC,"You asked for social democrats in particular, and since practically all of them are running in the state govt elections, I told you I would send them your way if they lost the elections. You couldn't have waited until after the state government elections?"
ModelUSGov,33u1nh,dreasdif118,2,Sat Apr 25 20:41:13 2015 UTC,We figured it would be a good idea for the executive office to have a body of people whom they could consult on each decision. Including all 4 parties so we could get a variety of opinions. This is not shadow secretaries. This is presidential advisers.   Contrary to what you are insinuating. I not only trust each of the cabinet members to the smaller cabinet offices. I trust them to the increased responsibilities given in this system. They all know that if they need help with things that we can increase the amount of cabinet members by re-expanding the cabinet to its former size.

ModelUSGov,33u1nh,bsddc,8,Sat Apr 25 23:33:24 2015 UTC,What happened to Senate confirmation? And apparently there will be an Opposition Advisory Council or something similar to that. That isn't the US Government.  That is more like the British Parliament. I believe we should stick with the Constitution and how the current IRL US Government is run.
ModelUSGov,33u1nh,SeptimusSette,8,Sat Apr 25 17:59:32 2015 UTC,These officials will be submitted to the Senate for their confirmation.

I would really like to have a group of people at large from all the parties which the VP and myself can run executive decisions like Executive Orders, vetoes, signings, etc by before commencing.   Especially in the case of executive orders and vetoes, since both of these things are sort of going past congress. We wanted to create another body which can be consulted on those things."

Totalitarianism is a political system in which the state holds total authority over the society and seeks to control all aspects of public and private life wherever possible.

ModelUSGov,33u1nh,JerryLeRow,2,Sat Apr 25 19:15:57 2015 UTC,"Other G-L members can confirm, that we had enough members and people who volunteered to fill the cabinet. This was not a decision based on lack of people who applied."

ModelUSGov,33u1nh,nacharj,4,Sat Apr 25 18:35:15 2015 UTC,"I remember the Soviet Union and I've read Animal Farm front and back but that doesn't make the horseshoe theory true. Animal Farm was written not just by an anti-Bolshevik but one who later turned in his fellow communists in to the British Authorities. Orwell is not someone I would trust to write anything without bias.   Furthermore, while not a fan of the USSR, I'm a Luxemburgist, I do recognise that the vast majority of average criticisms come from years of successful propaganda both by the west and by the administration which replaced Stalin. Also the USSR gets blamed for a lot of stuff which the west also did but gets a pass on. Like we don't ever see people blaming capitalism for the Great Indian Famine, the Irish Potato Famine, the Armenian Genocide, the Holocaust, the Dustbowl, the Great Depression, the eradification of aboriginal Americans during the colonial age, need I go on? But all I hear is ""but mah holodomor and political prisoners"".   As someone who is well-versed in history let me tell you that as a percentage of population the USSR had far less people imprisoned than the US government does, including political prisoners. Had far less deaths in prison than what is usually reported (of which the worst years were during WWII when they were faced with an enemy that literally wanted to wipe them off the face of the planet).

First you're writing about students, now about colleges. You should paste a ""students enrolled at"" after the first word of this section.   Section 9: New fees may not exceed 5% of current tuition.   After 4 years... you gotta include a clause ""after inflation"". Let's assume annual inflation of all 4 years is 2%, then the accumulated rise in prices is about 8.2%. That means expenditures of college are also likely to rise and they must be able to cover their costs.    Section 10: College tuition may not increase more than 3% per academic year or the change in inflation, whichever is less.   The change in inflation... if inflation is 2.1% in one year, and 1.9% in the next, then the change in inflation is -4.7%. This would mean despite rising prices (1.9%) you'd force facilities to decrease their costs (-4.7%). Re-write it to ""[...] or the inflation rate"".    Section 12: After 5 years, if the student came out of bankruptcy, then the discharged amount shall be reinstated with a $500 fee applied to the outstanding balance. If after 5 years, the student has not come out of bankruptcy, then the amount outstanding shall be halved and a period of 10 years shall pass before the student's ability to repay is evaluated.   First, it should be adjusted for inflation. Second, after he declares bankruptcy you'd evaluate his ability to repay after 15 years... those are pretty long time frames. Half them..."
ModelUSGov,33thtr,utdude999,3,Sat Apr 25 14:11:55 2015 UTC,"Any way we could add in a section about books? I can't honestly say I know why they're so expensive, but it seems unreasonably high."
ModelUSGov,33thtr,JerryLeRow,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:18:29 2015 UTC,"See, those books are produced in very low quantities, compared to e.g. science fiction bestsellers. That means that if the authors wanna make a living on their income, they gotta calculate a margin on every book, apart from that they also have to cover all the production costs. The low quantity makes all the cost getting spread over fewer books, so the total income and costs are perhaps the same ratios of bestseller-authors, just absolute different."
ModelUSGov,33thtr,utdude999,3,Sat Apr 25 16:31:32 2015 UTC,"Okay, so if they're produced in such low quantities, why not nationalize at least the ones needed for basic courses and subsidize the more advanced, obscure ones? We need to raise the Department of Education's budget anyways, it's abhorrently low."
ModelUSGov,33thtr,JerryLeRow,2,Sat Apr 25 16:41:26 2015 UTC,"First of all, how do you wanna finance a budget increase? Either you'd cut from another department (defense I assume), increase taxes or increase debt. All of them ideas I wouldn't really support.  Instead, use money from the current budget with which you buy schoolbooks for the students [US gov does pay for the schoolbooks, or?]. Buy some special license that allows you to send the books as PDF to students and you'll save tons of money. The other side of the dime is that the book publishing industry will take a (new) hit, and it'd increase unemployment and reduce tax revenues, at least temporarily.   I personally would favor printed books for students. Don't even start with nationalization and more subsidizes. What you can do is e.g. reduce subsidizes and increase the budgets of libraries, so they'll buy the books the students want and they're accessible by every student."
ModelUSGov,33thtr,utdude999,1 point,Sat Apr 25 17:54:14 2015 UTC,"I like the PDF idea, that would be the cheapest way to go. And the government does love the cheap option, especially when it comes to our students, our future.   And as for paying for an increase, yes a reduction in the defense budget will likely be coming soon. We also hope to better enforce the corporate taxes, as well as those on the highest income earners in the country. We all know how they like to dodge their responsibility as American citizens."
ModelUSGov,33thtr,JerryLeRow,2,Sat Apr 25 19:56:17 2015 UTC,"1) Keep in mind PDF means less books, means a decline of book publishers, what again equals less employment, higher social benefits and less tax revenue. So it may not be that cheap again.  2) Reducing the defense budget is irresponsible. I have nothing against cutting some money away and instead put it in foreign aid programs, but we somehow have to deter our enemies or make new friends. Not abandon both options."
ModelUSGov,33thtr,utdude999,1 point,Sat Apr 25 20:07:14 2015 UTC,"1) That's why I'm in favor of the nationalization idea, it could have the opposite effect. It'd also be smart, in my eyes, to have standardized books, approved by the DoE, for the basic classes. I may look into a solution for this as a separate bill.   2) I'm sure that's a debate we'll be having in the upcoming days."
ModelUSGov,33thtr,JerryLeRow,1 point,Sat Apr 25 20:51:04 2015 UTC,1) Let the states decide. Nationalization just creates more bureaucratic work and is a senseless waste of taxpayer money.  2) For sure. Peace through strength

There's no production cost, plus it seems to be the direction the world is heading. As a college student, I can confidently say that currently online books -- the few that exist compared to printed books -- are cheap but often lower quality than print books. If we can bring that standard of quality to an online medium, students would benefit in terms of cost and access to a greater number of internet resources and methods that online books can provide."

Since the Fed targets annual inflation of 2% (and even by official estimates, usually comes in low), this will cause the Federal Government to lose money on the loans.  Section 4 will cause it to lose more money - especially when sections 2 and 5 are taken into account, which will cause the government to lose money on these loans during the period they are accruing no interest.  This is exacerbated by Section 12. Section 6 is a vaguely-defined excuse for the Federal Government to effectively shut down any educational institution it disagrees with the policies of.  Under this section, the DoE could decide that Colleges which teach global warming skepticism, social services classes that emphasize teaching beneficiaries to become self-reliant, or (should the winds of public opinion shift), that gay marriage is acceptable are ""harming the education system"" and should become ineligible for Federal Financial aid. Sections 9 - 11 remove the ability of colleges to change tuition to adjust to changing circumstances... but leaves out ""fees"" entirely - which often exceed tuition.  This is particularly important given the government's official rate of inflation bears little resemblance to actual increases in consumer prices.  On what Constitutional authority is the regulation of college tuition based? Section 13 has no place in this bill, since there is no purpose to the evaluations."

The American West has long represented the values of individual liberty and personal responsibility that are at the core of my beliefs as a Republican. I believe that through a combination of limited government and strong defense, we can provide the maximum opportunity for empowerment through self-improvement. The role of government in our daily lives should be to treat all citizens equally and to protect the natural rights of the individual from tyranny. For these reasons, I am fervently anti-communist and anti-fascist, as I believe these systems of government can not exist without sublimation of individual oppression or the violation of natural rights.  I draw on a number of sources for my political and philosophical inspiration, including Barry Goldwater, Booker T. Washington, Francis Fukuyama, and Milton Friedman. Political figures I admire include Lincoln, Thatcher, and Jefferson. Political figures I respect and admire on the left include Roosevelt (for his role in World War II) and Robert Kennedy (for his eloquent reminders that the violation of the rights of one is a threat to all.)  I especially support efforts to revitalize our struggling urban centers through deregulation, school choice, and workfare programs.   On abortion: The unalienable right to life is extended to all humans from the moment of conception. The termination of a fetus is only justified if the fetus poses a direct threat to the mother's life or in cases of rape. I would support banning all abortions after the first trimester.  On gay marriage: I fully support equality in the eyes of the law. Federal government may not discriminate with regard to gender in matters of marriage benefits. Places of worship have the right to choose which matrimonial ceremonies to recognize, conduct, and celebrate.  On the death penalty: I oppose the death penalty due to its irreversible nature. Though I believe the philosophical justifications for capital punishment are sound, even one innocent's right to life taken by the government is one life too many.  On environmental regulation: While I believe that human activity contributes to climate change, I question the extent. I would support efforts by the federal government to use green energy in its own operations, leading by example, but government should not restrict emissions or tax fossil fuel industry.  On drug use: I favor decriminalization of most drugs, as well as the legalization of marijuana and the use of hallucinogenic drugs for scientific purposes.  On affirmative action: I oppose affirmative action as government policy. Individuals should be judged for positions as individuals, not based on the color of their skin. If an individual overcame particular adversity due to the color of their skin, that should be accounted for in their evaluation.  On the PATRIOT Act: I am opposed to any attempts to renew the PATRIOT Act and mass surveillance programs. While the government needs to take efforts to secure our liberties against foreign and domestic threats, mass surveillance is unwieldy, unsuccessful, and a violation of the Bill of Rights.  On immigration: I support efforts to reform the current INS system to make it easier for hard-working and intelligent candidates to find employment and become citizens of the United States. Until such reforms are enacted, I support stricter enforcement of immigration laws, stricter border control and expired visa enforcement, and the detainment of illegal immigrants for processing or deportation.  On drone strikes: I oppose the use of drone strikes against American citizens without trial, as it violates the Sixth Amendment. I support the use of drone strikes in limited military application.  On welfare: Able-bodied, mentally capable adults should be required to work to receive welfare.  On gun control: I oppose all efforts to restrict gun ownership, as they violate the Second Amendment.  On enhanced interrogation: I oppose the treatment of enemy combatants in any way that violates the unalienable rights on which this country's philosophy is based.  On the minimum wage: There should be no increase to the federal minimum wage. States and municipalities should be able to set their own minimum wage, specifically suited to their labor market. In many cases, I support efforts to raise the minimum wage in large cities.  On nuclear energy: I am a big proponent of nuclear energy as a safe and clean alternative to fossil fuels.  On education: I oppose federal education standards. Our state should be able to decide how to educate our students. I also oppose teaching religious beliefs in public schools, though I would be willing to support the addition of theological study to state curriculum.  On genetically modified food: I oppose efforts to label GMOs (including potatoes.)  Please feel free to ask my positions on any other issues!"

ModelUSGov,33s2xz,ben1204,5,Mon Apr 27 23:12:40 2015 UTC,"I am ben1204, a proud New Jerseyan, and I am running for governor of the Northeast. Here is my platform.  Environment: New Jersey consistently ranks last among users of alternative energy. Recently, we also exited the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. These points are unacceptable. I will work to establish a deal with other state on modelusgov to create goals to cut carbon emissions. I will fight against Congress' plan to drill off the east coast. Lastly, I will look into an aggressive plan to fund alternative energy in our state.   Economy: I look to put people in our state back to work. But I think that we also need to focus on the quality of the jobs, and people dropping out of the labor force. Our infrastructure is crumbling, and like our federal government wants to do, I will look into expanding our state's infrastructure. I will also seek to protect the rights of workers unions, and become the first state to guarantee maternal and paternal leave, and vacation time.  Death Penalty: I support the abolition of the death penalty, and the commutation of current sentences to life without parole. An imperfect system cannot administer death. This will save us lots of money as well.   4th Amendment: As you may know from my failed House candidacy, I am passionate about fighting for 4th amendment rights. I understand I would be somewhat constrained as a state government official; I, for example, have no control over the NSA. However, I have a few ideas. I would support a bill, like the one being debated in California that would require a warrant for the use of stingray technology. The US is the only country that doesn't give people the right to their data; I would like to require companies such as Facebook to accede to data transparency requests from their customers here.   Higher Education Affordability: Tennessee became the first state to offer free community college. I think this is a great step, but I want our state to go further. I propose that we offer free public undergraduate education at our state universities, 4 year or 2 year. Does this mean that all students, good or bad will get free education? No. I favor a minimum GPA to earn this; the purpose is to get good students who otherwise wouldn't get free education in on this plan. I would work with the legislature to hammer out these details.   LGBT Rights: I will work to make sure that Pennsylvania, the last holdout will legalize same sex marriage. I will also favor a bill like ENDA that will establish protections for LGBT workers from getting fired due to sexual orientation.  Policing Reform: I will work to mandate that every single police killing of a civilian will be reported to the federal government and made public. I will look to establish limits on the militarization of the police; it is a waste of money and only establishes fear when they drive around in Humvees. I will also look to see if we can make body cameras mandatory. And I will also look for independent state-run investigations of police misconduct; I would like to use Wisconsin's system as a model. I will also look to ban no-knock raids. They are dangerous for our citizens as well as police officers.  Drug Reforms: I favor legalizing marijuana in the Northeast. This is within state power. I will work with the legislature to set up a system where we can tax and regulate marijuana for adults who would like to partake. This is a great way to make tax revenue, free up law enforcement resources, and keep our values consistent; that those who consume marijuana, like alcohol should not be punished for their vices. I support the decriminalization of all recreational drugs but realize we may be constrained in our powers; so I will work to lighten sentences as much as possible for other drugs, and work to expunge drug convictions so we can get people on their feet and out of the cycle of crime. I would also appeal to our federal government to allow us to take part in aggressive medical study of marijuana.   How are we gonna pay for all this stuff???: Yes, from the conservatives on here, I knew that this question would eventually be asked. I will look to raise taxes on the top 1% percent of earners here. I will also exercise fiscally conservative ways of cutting from our budget things we don't need. For example, to fund our alternative energy, I would like to decrease funding for our region's nuclear energy. I would also like to cut stupid projects, such as state zoos, that I feel don't generate revenue for us."

ModelUSGov,33s2xz,Didicet,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:15:52 2015 UTC,Correct; I think that each district will have either 5 or the exact number of reps running. In Northeast there's 5 people running and it says to select up to 5.

What I can promise you is that, under my leadership, this Senate would act firmly on the side of peace, democracy and self-determination.   We will make a stand against this aggressive system by opposing future overseas wars and respecting all other sovereign governments; by condemning police brutality and further democratizing our judicial system; by meeting the demands and expectations of our indigenous nations and minority communities.   While I am a Communist, I am also a part of this system like you. And together, we can work to bring changes to it in a way that will benefit us as well as others on this planet."

In my tenure I have worked for the following:    An updated vote-tracking for the Congress. Better voting rates from Representatives.  The integration of the Committee structure.    Moving forward I hope to expand on these, but also to look for growth. I hope to create more committees so every member of the House sits on a committee. I want to grow the number of joint sessions, and I do look forward to a State of the Union address!   Beyond all of this, I believe I have served in my office with dignity and honor, putting the House of Representatives above my personal convictions. That is the main role of this job; the House comes first.   I wish the honorable Representative /u/cameronc65 good luck, and I know that no matter who wins, the House of Representatives will be as engaging as always.   But I do ask for your vote because there is no other job in this government I will work harder for.

I will do my best to keep this brief, and let my words do their share of the work.  There are many things I am, a Christian, husband, teacher, Representative. However, what I am not is a salesman. Strange, perhaps, considering that I am a model politician - fortunately, the nature of model government doesn't require salesmanship. So, let me be straight forward.   My faith is central to my life, in fact I currently teach English in a third world country because of it. It's my hope that this Christian faith of mine will help bridge the ideological gap between the Green-Left other parties. Perhaps we can approach one another more in understanding than in resentment.  Philosophy is my passion. I teach English, but I also teach classes in English. Philosophy is one of those classes. Though, I can't necessarily claim to be ""good"" at philosophy, whatever that means. It's my hope, again, that a deeper understanding of the underpinnings of certain ideologies will help me help others think deeply about the consequences of our positions and legislation.  Politic Science is my degree. I studied it because I enjoyed it. My final hope is that this will allow me to craft strong bills, help others do the same.  Thank you for your time,  Cameron"

Nowhere in the rules does it say I can't point out the absolute stupidity and historical context of an ideology.  If you are of a certain ideology, that says something about your level of intelligence.  So if I refuse to deal with someone because they are a socialist, and I tell them that, that is not a slur, and is my right."
ModelUSGov,33fca1,Gohte,2,Wed Apr 22 05:14:37 2015 UTC,"So if I refuse to deal with someone because they are a socialist, and I tell them that, that is not a slur, and is my right.   It certainly is, and it's also intellectually lazy and petty that you would feel that way.  And considering the current demographics of our model government here, if this is really how you feel then perhaps it's best to either leave or get over it."
ModelUSGov,33fca1,TheRealRailguy,5,Wed Apr 22 10:20:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's perfectly reasonable to not work with someone over ideology. I, for example, would refuse to work with a fascist. Is there something wrong with that?"
ModelUSGov,33fca1,jaywhoo,3,Wed Apr 22 18:15:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of just ignoring or letting things slide with ideologies that I am against. I try to learn about fascism personally so I can confront fascists when they unfortunately and inevitably turn up. If TRRG views socialism as evil as I view fascism, what good does it do to not challenge it?  It's not like any minds are going to be instantly changed, but valid debates on the merits of a political, social, or economic system help you learn about and develop your own beliefs as it should hopefully help you learn about your counterpart's ideas.  Up until recently that last little bit never happened. I'm hoping that the rule change will force people to do a little more studying about their opposing ideologies."
ModelUSGov,33fca1,risen2011,3,Wed Apr 22 18:28:01 2015 UTC,"It was an example.  I will work with anyone, as long as we arr working for the rights of americans, as opposed to against.  Also, I ask that you not try to convince people to leave the simulation, its in bad spirit."

ModelUSGov,33fca1,jaywhoo,0,Wed Apr 22 05:06:20 2015 UTC,"These people are wrong. For example, calling someone a mass murderer or a reactionary when they are not mass murdering or being reactionary is not allowed. You can criticize an ideology, just not in an overtly offensive way.   It should be noted, however, that if you start criticizing an ideology in a way that is irrelevant to the current discussion, it would fall under the baiting rules. If someone starts criticizing conservatism or liberalism in a bill discussing foreign policy, that would not be allowed."

ModelUSGov,33bmif,utdude999,2,Tue Apr 21 15:05:13 2015 UTC,"This particular one is in the air, and will last for however long it needs to, because of the number of representatives and their varying schedules."

ModelUSGov,33ac2e,loopmoploop,3,Tue Apr 21 03:24:58 2015 UTC,"A couple of suggestions.  It's great that there appears to be lots of interest. I recommend we get as many people involved here as possible. I think we should look to make each state assembly 7-9 members, and allow people (for just this election) to run for Senator and governor (in the same district). I also think we should consider leaving this link open a little longer. I also encourage other party members to advertise on their subs.   Also, I don't think each state assembly needs to have the same amount of members. IRL, not every state legislature is identical.   We should also consider maybe switching some members to less popular states (West atm)."
ModelUSGov,33ac2e,ben1204,2,Wed Apr 22 01:11:18 2015 UTC,"Hear hear, except for the senator-governor thing, which is sort of odd."
ModelUSGov,33ac2e,2adamstoon,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:45:53 2015 UTC,"My view is that it's just for this election. I think we should try to maximize the number of members, and we can do that through this.   I think we have a lot of signups, particularly for governor and it would be a waste to include participants simply if they don't get elected governor."
ModelUSGov,33ac2e,JerryLeRow,3,Wed Apr 22 02:28:53 2015 UTC,What would be really cool is that you could give these states the ability to call a Convention of States through their legislators after the elections.

If we had people participate in the state that corresponds to their real life, it seems we'd have state governments of 10 or so people, if that. I suggest that before we implement this measure, we should collect data on how many people would be participating in these state governments, and then determine whether or not these will work.

""Once that's going, maybe then look at recruiting more people to the simulation overall, then focus on state governments.""   State governments will take about 20 people, tops, and I think we have the capability of getting that many people, or more, to participate.   ""Interest groups seem unnecessary given how small we are and how focused people are on their own parties. I'm willing to give it a shot, but I think you'll find that the interest group subs are dead.""

ModelUSGov,32sska,drjalexanderphysics,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:46:51 2015 UTC,"You must be British. Santa Claus is derived from Saint Nicholas. He was known for giving gifts to the poor. During the Middle Ages, children were given gifts on December 5th, one day before his name day of December 6th. Through the years, revisions of this practice eventually brought it the day we currently know as Christmas Day, December 25th, but the original idea of giving gifts still goes back to Saint Nicholas.   In England, a separate persona if you will was created called Father Christmas. He heralded the birth of Christ, and in celebration people where to drink and feast and be merry. Father Christmas adopted some of the characteristics of Saint Nicholas, like gift giving.  Now obviously over the hundreds of years, Saint Nicholas and Father Christmas have adopted each others more popular traditions, and are almost one and the same. However, Saint Nicholas was well before Father Christmas, and that is why most people go to him outside of the UK. In the USA, it is Santa Claus, who is called Saint Nicholas as sung in the carols and stories.  My original comment was to the person talking about Santa Claus, not Father Christmas who I use just automatically assume is the same, but after doing a bit of research, seems they are actually 2 different people, but have almost identical traditions.  So you are correct that Father Christmas wears green, however Santa who we are talking about has always worn red, going back to the days of Saint Nicholas."

You are thinking of Father Christmas, who did indeed wear green but he was not the same as Santa Claus.   Saint Nicholas existed way before Father Christmas, who is a much more recent figure when compared to the former. Father Christmas was about celebrating Christs birth through drinking and feasts. Santa Claus, or Saint Nicholas, was the one giving presents and children receiving presents before his name day.   Through the generations both Santa Claus and Father Christmas adopted the more popular aspects of each other and are today almost identical."

Estimates of the death toll vary. According to Prof. Kim Dong-Choon, Commissioner of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, at least 100,000 people were executed on suspicion of supporting communism;  others estimate 200,000  and even 1.2 million deaths.  The massacre was wrongly blamed on the communists.  For four decades the South Korean government concealed this massacre. Survivors were forbidden by the government from revealing it, under suspicion of being communist sympathizers. Public revelation carried with it the threat of torture and death. During the 1990s, several corpses were excavated from mass graves, resulting in public awareness of the massacre.

ModelUSGov,32sska,richhomieram,6,Fri Apr 17 21:06:36 2015 UTC,"Actually such accounts of history are extremely distorted submerging historical analysis in the ideological warfare of the cold war. Almost all research conducted about vanguard socialist states is conducted from a biased ideological standpoint. Great numbers of researchers and institutes were even funded by cia front organizations which directed them to fabricate propaganda. It isn't unexpected really, of course the bourgeois will exert the whole of their social power to demonize the ideological concepts which seek the abolishment of their existence as the exploiting class. Do not confuse this with a denial of history, only the bourgeois conception of it. Famine did occur within the soviet union as it had for centuries before,  the holodomor was hardly any different, in fact the occurrence of such things as the holodomor is precisely why collectivization had to occur. The ununified fractured dismay of the agricultural system which was split up into countless agrarian capitalist holdings was massively ineffective at mechanizing agriculture. On top of that, the exploitative feudalistic property relations which had been fought and largely dismantled during the revolution had reconcentrated themselves following the nep, class antagonisms had reemerged in the countryside, the peasantry was once again being exploited by a propertied class. The policies of redistribution of massive landed estates was reinstated and class warfare broke out in the countryside. The agrarian capitalists took reactionary action and proceeded to burn vast fields of crops and slaughter all the livestock. Taking into account the already occuring drought and the undeveloped infrastructure of the region and the food supply of the industrialized regions was jeprodized prompting the seizing of harvests to stop starvation elsewhere. This policy was poorly implemented failing to properly distribute necessary food supplies to where they were needed by favoring the industrialized regions over the agrarian which were seen as already having the means to produce with them, but it was hardly an endeavor to starve the peasants.

It is shameful that America, a global leader, allows its own citizens to suffer and die without access to health care. Forcing people into a lifetime of debt just to survive is truly a national shame.  A single payer healthcare system would also save a lot of money. On medicines alone, buy having a massive government health care system, it would have massive purchasing powers that would save millions by purchasing in a massive bulk volume. Then by allowing Americans to see doctors and health care professionals sooner, major diseases and other issues can be averted early, which prevents much larger costs later on.  I am not suggesting everything would be free to users, seeing a doctor, medical procedures and life saving drugs like cancer drugs would be covered by the system, however things like antibiotics would have small co-pay amounts based on your income level, with a maximum yearly co-pay limit again based on income level."

Despite this no one paid any medical bills for operations or seeing their doctors so I don't really see how government incompetence can be an argument against setting one up for your country!  Yes but even those who are insured can have treatment denied and despite 'obamacare' there is still a ridiculously high number of people without healthcare I simply don't understand why you wouldn't commit to implementing even universal insurance for everyone, not even nationalising the hospitals but ensuring everyone can get treatment no matter what the cost is.

Some were even thrown off their policies as a result of the legislation despite the promise that they could keep their health care plans if they were happy with them.  It sounds as though your government is in a pickle because there is not enough budget to pay for your government-provided healthcare.

Surely this would not only be successful for the people but also for your own party electorally?!    We do not believe that taxpayer funded universal healthcare would be successful for the people and that is why we don't support it.

Then when the conservative led government came to power they wasted £2bn on a top down reorganisation again more money not spent on patent care. We could free up a lot of money if the NHS was better managed as shown in Scotland with the far more efficient management by the Scottish Government.    You don't know our government.   I was meaning of the UK government you quoted that article from 2012 showing that some trusts were in deficit.    When a private insurer tries to deny you, you can sue.

Well that's the thing, the NHS doesn't really deny you treatment and if it does it might decide to fund your treatment in Europe and if even Europe doesn't have the treatment you can always turn to Bupa which is the private alternative to the NHS but they have the NHS to fall back on when they don't want to do things. My dad has Bupa insurance as part of his job but it won't fund his injections and other drugs so the NHS provides them - £50,000 worth of drugs per year and yet from our taxes we contribute just £2,000 per year to the NHS.   We are in dire straits economically. It doesn't matter if everyone has ""free"" healthcare if your nation is bankrupt.   But the NHS was created at a time when our government was on its knees after the war and we needed to rebuild like all our cities, infrastructure etc. our country was far more bankrupt than yours is now. The NHS was created basically through the loan that Keynes  negotiated when labour came into power and since then we've managed to provide healthcare to the county funded through general taxation. I honestly don't see how you could be against something that works by redistributing money into resources and then into the people who need them! I would ask you to honestly reconsider your view because the provision of healthcare by the state is surely one of the best achievements of modern society."
ModelUSGov,32sska,Agent78787,2,Fri Apr 17 23:23:00 2015 UTC,"We could free up a lot of money if the NHS was better managed   This is the problem with government-run systems.  We have had a system in the USA for providing care to all.  It's called the VA.  It is a doctor/hospital system for military veterans.  Some have died waiting in line for treatment.   Well that's the thing, the NHS doesn't really deny you treatment and if it does it might decide to fund your treatment in Europe and if even Europe doesn't have the treatment you can always turn to Bupa which is the private alternative    So what you are saying is that sometimes the NHS does deny you and you have to fall back on the private alternative....   £50,000 worth of drugs per year and yet from our taxes we contribute just £2,000 per year to the NHS.   Is this sustainable?   I honestly don't see how you could be against something that works by redistributing money into resources and then into the people who need them!   I'm not.  I do not seek to do away with health care programs that provide care to those who truly cannot afford it."
ModelUSGov,32sska,adavis2014,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:27:06 2015 UTC,"We're hopeful -- well, some of us are -- that your country can pull itself back to the principles that founded one of the single greatest institutions in the history of modern peoples, and did so during a time of grinding privation and devastation. More hopeful that you all will wake up in time to shield it from the corporate amorality, selfishly perverse individualism, and bad math that threatens to tear it apart piece by piece like prey in an eagle's talons and beak. But enough from an old man and his history.  The Model Democratic Party will put an end to the obscenity of farming our ill and injured citizens, infants, elderly, veterans, workers, billionaires and homeless alike, by private, for-profit insurers in pursuit of nothing more than rising share prices and dividends. And in one stroke we will close the floodgates to the public funds that fill their private troughs.  We will resign to the babble heap the phrase ""we don't take your insurance"" as the rest of the civilized 1st World has already done.  We will halt the arena of mandatory shopping contests and competitions which pit our people against each other to do nothing more than try to defeat their neighbor and ""win"" access to health care."
ModelUSGov,32sska,Agent78787,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:33:23 2015 UTC,Well last term we managed to pass a bill which resolves many of the issues the NHS has (mainly to do with private sector and market forces acting within the NHS) and IRL we can hope that a labour government propped up by the SNP can provide a better NHS.  Your commitment to providing better healthcare for your nation is something that as a party you should be proud of and I wish you the best of success in implementing. And the fact people try to win healthcare is really quite strange to me I think it'd be a sign I should leave the UK if one of the afternoon game shows is to win healthcare!
ModelUSGov,32sska,HalflingTea,4,Fri Apr 17 23:03:50 2015 UTC,"we can hope that a labour government propped up by the SNP can provide a better NHS.   Well, we can hope.

I typically carry very nuanced views, because I know that while some things in America are very black and white, many things in politics are subjective, and as we have seen with the recent repeal of the PATRIOT ACT, issues like privacy and national security evolve over time as we come to a better understanding of what the government is doing with our nation.

The federal government is limited by the Constitution as to what it may and may not do.  Everything else is reserved to the states or the people.  It is not Constitutional, your plan.  What you are proposing also is setting precedent for the federal government to seize massive amounts of private property on behalf of the people.    We do not need more government.  We need less government.  We cannot afford the government that we have.  We do not need the federal government running entire industries."
ModelUSGov,3287by,brucejoel99,3,Mon Apr 13 02:24:05 2015 UTC,"We don't need more or less government. We need open government. Changing politics in Washington means ensuring that government is open, transparent, and responsive to the needs of the people. President Obama has implemented the most sweeping ethics and transparency requirements in history, building on steps taken by lawmakers to limit the influence of special interests and ensure that government is accountable to the people.  Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their government is doing. We are committed to creating the most open, transparent, and accountable government in history. In the next six months in the /r/ModelUSGov and the next few years IRL, we need to take steps to:   Bring unprecedented accountability to federal spending; Rein in the influence of lobbyists in Washington; Shut down the ""revolving door"" that allowed lobbyists to move freely from government to special interests and back; Open more lines of communication with the American public; and Increase cooperation across all levels of government, as well as with nonprofit organizations, businesses, and individuals in the private sector."

Throwing money at this problem, will only make it worse because the high cost of college is entirely due to federally guaranteed loans.  http://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/average-published-undergraduate-charges-sector-2014-15  The costs of college depend on the type.  I suppose that we might end the guaranteed federal student loan program and make those loans dischargeable in bankruptcy.  But I'm just spitballing.  I do not favor dictating the price of education to every college.  I do not favor having the government nationalize higher education.  I am not going to promise freebies in order to secure votes."
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,6,Mon Apr 13 00:19:46 2015 UTC,To all candidates:   What is one thing you admire about your opponents? (Preferably without backhanded snark)
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,5,Sun Apr 12 18:08:52 2015 UTC,Brucejoel:Seems to be against austerity measures.  IBiteYou: Seems to have a healthy sense of cynicism.  Sheppio: Sticks to his views despite being different from most of the parties on here.
ModelUSGov,3287by,Eilanyan,5,Mon Apr 13 03:07:26 2015 UTC,"Rangerheart: Seems to keep the US' interests at heart.  Brucejoel: From what I've seen, he supports government transparency, which I admire.  IBiteYou: Advocates for fiscal responsibility."
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,4,Sun Apr 12 19:38:45 2015 UTC,I thank Sheppio734 for their answer and wish them luck in the upcoming election.
ModelUSGov,3287by,Eilanyan,3,Sun Apr 12 19:52:42 2015 UTC,"Rangerheart - always keeps debate civil, is kind-hearted  Sheppio - has a sincere interest in government  Brucejoel - very well-versed in the workings of government"
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,5,Sun Apr 12 19:53:25 2015 UTC,Thank you for the response and good luck!
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,6,Sun Apr 12 19:56:17 2015 UTC,"To all candidates:  American foreign policy over the last few years has shown us ramp up our imperialist tendencies. I think this can be seen most clearly in the drone program which has claimed hundreds of civilian lives in the Middle East and Central Asia. If elected president, will you end the drone program, and if not, will you ensure that when choosing targets, the lives of foreign civilians will be put in the same regard as American civilians would be?"
ModelUSGov,3287by,Canadianman22,7,Sat Apr 11 13:33:33 2015 UTC,"I would definitely lower our emphasis on drone strikes. I am very much for lowering and smarter usage of our defense budget, and this would be the first step."
ModelUSGov,3287by,HammerAndPotato,12,Sat Apr 11 14:12:13 2015 UTC,I would definitely work to end the drone program. However that is not the root cause to our imperialistic tendencies. We need to fundamentally change our economic system so that we are no longer relying on our multinationals extracting capital from the resources of other countries.
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,4,Sat Apr 11 13:47:19 2015 UTC,"I would not end the drone program itself, I would immediately put an end to the use of missiles immediately, while a better system could be put into place that would ensure that when a missile is fired, it is not into a civilian area, only militant/military area where no civilians can be reasonably expected to be.    Killing civilians is what the terrorists want, and we should not be giving them that. They do not care about the dead as people, they care about the dead as propaganda tools, nothing more. Under the administration of /u/brucejoel99 and I, we will give no more propaganda victories to the terrorists."
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,6,Sat Apr 11 13:46:38 2015 UTC,"I'm generally in agreement with /u/rangerheart0. We need to change how the US operates, not just our military tactics."
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,3,Sat Apr 11 14:23:44 2015 UTC,"I would not end the drone program, but certainly we should be actively minimizing the possibility of civilian death."
ModelUSGov,3287by,WineRedPsy,3,Sun Apr 12 19:08:42 2015 UTC,"Do you believe that, for example, Pakistani citizens should be valued equally to American citizens?"
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,3,Sun Apr 12 20:38:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do. We should not indiscriminately bomb anyone.  *edited to fit the question."
ModelUSGov,3287by,brucejoel99,9,Sun Apr 12 20:41:48 2015 UTC,How many children people decide to have is between them. The government has no place there.
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,2,Sun Apr 12 02:02:58 2015 UTC,But workforce size in relation to the aging population is affected.
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,2,Sun Apr 12 14:04:09 2015 UTC,Not sure if serious but I think that if this sort of thing actually starts to become a serious nationwide issue then we can look into it. We don't want to force unnecessary economic burdens on people when we are still in a capitalist system.
ModelUSGov,3287by,DEYoungRepublicans,4,Tue Apr 14 16:19:18 2015 UTC,"I won't do anything about the low and declining birth rate.  In 1992, the US Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society of London issued the following joint statement:   If current predictions of population growth and patterns of human activity on the planet remain unchanged, science and technology may not be able to prevent either irreversible degradation of the environment or continued poverty for much of the world.""   Back in 1992, birth rates were very, very high before the 1994 U.N. Cairo Population Conference. B/c they're now declining, science and technology WILL ""be  able to prevent either irreversible degradation of the environment or continued poverty for much of the  world"", should it come to that."
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,3,Tue Apr 14 22:38:21 2015 UTC,"I don't find that there is an alarming need for exponential growth in the US. We're at about 2 children per woman, and that seems like a perfectly normal birth rate."
ModelUSGov,3287by,houinator,5,Sun Apr 12 12:49:11 2015 UTC,I honestly do not think there is much proactively that a government can do about that particular issue.
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,3,Sun Apr 12 07:12:30 2015 UTC,I would imagine improving the economy and limiting access and government subsidies to abortion clinics would marginally increase the birth rate.
ModelUSGov,3287by,houinator,2,Sun Apr 12 19:07:22 2015 UTC,"You have a great point.  People tend to have children when they feel that they are secure economically.  It is my understanding that government money provided to clinics cannot be allocated for abortion.  We could also make every second Saturday ""Barry White"" Saturday, because who doesn't want to get down to that?  :)"
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,5,Mon Apr 13 14:24:57 2015 UTC,"To all candidates:  Do you support anti-discrimination laws that create protected classes (race, gender, sex, religion, etc..) that private business owners cannot refuse to do business with (solely on the basis of being a member of that class)?    For those that agree with the previous position, in Nevada (or anywhere else) where prostitution is legal, should anti-discrimination laws force prostitutes to to provide services to someone outside of their natural preference, if those preferences have to do with protected classes?"
ModelUSGov,3287by,brucejoel99,10,Mon Apr 13 18:54:25 2015 UTC,"I definitely support anti-discrimination laws.   The prostitution scenario is a bit tricky. Prostitution many times has to do with the socioeconomic status of the prostitute theirself. Many times they are forced into it, need money and can't really do anything else. This is something that we hope to reduce as the G-L party and that will reduce the above problem."
ModelUSGov,3287by,houinator,2,Sat Apr 11 21:58:46 2015 UTC,"So you believe that prostitution is bad, but you still didn't answer my question.  Should prostitutes be forced by anti discrimination laws to have sex with people without their consent, yes or no?"
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,9,Sun Apr 12 01:23:24 2015 UTC,"I would like to minimize the amount of times that people are forced into prostitution, which is a good amount of the time. Consequently reducing the amount of times where prostitutes would be forced into such a situation. That is my answer.  More directly, I would rather not them being forced into such a situation, but if someone presented me with a anti-discrimination bill as president, a lack of a prostitution clause would not stop me from signing it."
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,5,Sun Apr 12 06:32:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, b/c we have fought to end discrimination in all forms—including discrimination based on race, sex, ethnicity or national origin, language, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, or disability. For too many though, this ideal is still far from a reality. That’s why in our fight to stand up for civil rights for all Americans, we are committed to protecting voting rights, enacting an Employment Non-Discrimination Act, ensuring marriage equality and equal federal rights for LGBT couples and achieving equal pay for equal work.  And per the Nevada question, yes, anti-discrimination laws should apply to prostitution. However, if I may say this, if you don't wanna have sex with someone of the opposite race, sex, ethnicity, national origin, language, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, or disability, then don't become a prostitute."
ModelUSGov,3287by,houinator,3,Sun Apr 12 13:09:08 2015 UTC,So you believe the government should force prostitutes to have sex with people without their consent in this scenario?
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,3,Sat Apr 11 23:15:08 2015 UTC,"We must be very careful regarding the laws we make.  A law should not trample on a person's deeply-held religious beliefs, for instance."
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,2,Sun Apr 12 06:10:39 2015 UTC,"A private business should not be allowed to refuse service on the basis of what class they fall into. However, on the topic of marriage, because a marriage ceremony has no legal connotations, and all one must do to get married is go town and sign the license, I don't believe a religious institution should be forced to hold a ceremony.  A prostitute is (generally) an independent contractor working for a brothel in  Nevada. They have the right to refuse service to any individual, but also, as they are now, can have their contracts terminated for doing such a thing."
ModelUSGov,3287by,lightfive,2,Sun Apr 12 19:05:22 2015 UTC,So to clarify you believe that all independent contractors should be exempt from anti-discrimination laws?  Or just prostitutes?
ModelUSGov,3287by,jacoby531,2,Sat Apr 11 23:18:53 2015 UTC,"Independent contractors are, as I see them, people who are able to do an odd job of some kind, often sponsored by an official company, so yes, they should be exempt."
ModelUSGov,3287by,HammerAndPotato,4,Sun Apr 12 06:34:06 2015 UTC,I would like to ask /u/sheppio734 and /u/crossbowguy237 how they plan on differentiating themselves from the Republican candidates.
ModelUSGov,3287by,brucejoel99,9,Sun Apr 12 07:09:52 2015 UTC,"I differ from the Republican ticket on several issues. They suggest drone strikes and other military action on Iran, I suggest sanctions. They (If I remember correctly) support mass deportation of illegal immigrants, while I support the Societal Improvement Act, a piece of legislation that will fix the problem of illegal immigration and allow us to spend less on welfare programs. We have many differing views."
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,4,Sat Apr 11 13:20:59 2015 UTC,Why do you suggest sanctions though? Wouldn't it be better to not sanction them and try to find a diplomatic solution?
ModelUSGov,3287by,2adamstoon,5,Sat Apr 11 14:27:34 2015 UTC,To all candidates: Why should I vote for you?
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,16,Sat Apr 11 17:35:02 2015 UTC,"GreenLeft seeks a free and equal America. Our platform will focus on moving America forward, establishing a more egalitarian society in which people live their lives with dignity and purpose, not in poverty or faced by discrimination."
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,6,Sat Apr 11 15:44:42 2015 UTC,"Because we believe that we're greater together than we are on our own—that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot, when everyone does their fair share, when everyone plays by the same rules. Our party is focused on building an economy that lasts—an economy that lifts up all Americans. That's why we're working to advance issues like job creation, education, health care, and clean energy—and that's exactly what'll happen if you give America a /u/brucejoel99-/u/canadianman22 Administration."
ModelUSGov,3287by,dreasdif118,9,Sat Apr 11 22:43:48 2015 UTC,"You should vote for /u/HammerAndPotato and I because we both stand for ending oppressive systems, and creating new ones in which people have greater freedom, opportunity, and more room for growth.   We are focused on directly attacking the root causes of poverty, discrimination, and exploitation. Rather than many of our opponents who would rather just offer reforms or band-aids to the societal cancers that plague America."
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,7,Sat Apr 11 20:52:47 2015 UTC,"You should vote for /u/IBiteYou and I for several reasons:   Every American has to balance their budget, why can't the government? We will balance the Federal Government's budget. America will become energy independent. We will reduce the corporate tax rate. When capital gains taxes are applied with the corporate tax rate in America, it can reach 56%. We will combat this; bringing jobs back to America. We will cooperate with our allies, and combat international terrorism."
ModelUSGov,3287by,dreasdif118,10,Sun Apr 12 01:27:56 2015 UTC,"My campaign and my plans for this term are based on bi-to-quadpartisan cooperations. I value nuance and thoughtfulness, and I look to appeal to both sides of the aisle when I make a bill. I think our current party system is vehement, but I must take part if I want a chance at this election. The current dichotomy from right to left murders any chance of a cooperating congress. We need to unite our nation, and taking any steps towards further partisanship. We need a president who will do that, and more. We need a president who will truly be able to take all of their constituents into account. That's why you should vote for me, and that's what I plan to do if I'm elected."
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,4,Sun Apr 12 03:09:37 2015 UTC,Hi.  I promise to consider things thoroughly before I commit the USA to them.  I pledge to work with Congress.   I have in mind the best interests of the country.
ModelUSGov,3287by,utdude999,4,Sat Apr 11 15:54:14 2015 UTC,To all candidates: How will you deal with the rising costs of health care?
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,6,Sun Apr 12 18:45:48 2015 UTC,"A first step is introducing a single payer system. This has been discussed and is not an end goal. The second thing that must be done is first regulating the actual pricing of healthcare products themselves, these prices are currently exorbitant and are a large reason why healthcare is so expensive. Third I would like to collectivize hospitals, clinics, and such. In the process removing the profit motive from those institutions. The seeking of profit is part of the reason why healthcare is so expensive. People have no choice but to pay massive prices. So the prices are set massively because money needs to be made.  We need to return control of our nations healthcare back to the people which it is supposed to keep healthy."
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,4,Sat Apr 11 16:54:05 2015 UTC,How would collectivizing the health care industry return health care to the people?
ModelUSGov,3287by,Canadianman22,6,Sun Apr 12 01:40:23 2015 UTC,"well more accurately it would return control of the healthcare to the people. See under a privatised system such as we have today healthcare is distributed largely under the capitalist economic model. Capitalism is rule by capital, it is controlled by profits and such. In the instance of healthcare that is not always a good thing and is not a good method for people to control their healthcare. By collectivizing it I hope to remove the profit motive and strictly have it controlled by who needs what, and where they need it."
ModelUSGov,3287by,dreasdif118,2,Sun Apr 12 03:24:49 2015 UTC,Would this system be modeled from another existing healthcare system such as the NHS or the Cuban system or will it be planned from scratch?
ModelUSGov,3287by,Canadianman22,5,Sun Apr 12 13:11:54 2015 UTC,"I would say probably from scratch. We can take what works from other systems but this is really something we want to tailor make to the United States' needs. It is something we want to get right, and want to get right the first time."
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sharknado_1,3,Mon Apr 13 06:07:17 2015 UTC,One way would be to increase insurance competition by allowing insurance companies to sell across state lines.  http://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/republicans.energycommerce.house.gov/files/114/20150205-PCARE-Act-Plan.pdf  I think that the above articulates some good ideas that might be embraced by Congress to improve the healthcare situation in the USA.
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,2,Mon Apr 13 12:27:42 2015 UTC,"I would personally like to institute a single payer healthcare system. It is shameful that America, a global leader, allows its own citizens to suffer and die without access to health care. Forcing people into a lifetime of debt just to survive is truly a national shame.  A single payer healthcare system would also save a lot of money. On medicines alone, buy having a massive government health care system, it would have massive purchasing powers that would save millions by purchasing in a massive bulk volume. Then by allowing Americans to see doctors and health care professionals sooner, major diseases and other issues can be averted early, which prevents much larger costs later on.   I am not suggesting everything would be free to users, seeing a doctor, medical procedures and life saving drugs like cancer drugs would be covered by the system, however things like antibiotics would have small co-pay amounts based on your income level, with a maximum yearly co-pay limit again based on income level."
ModelUSGov,3287by,HammerAndPotato,2,Sun Apr 12 19:27:03 2015 UTC,How would this single payer system effect the income tax rates?
ModelUSGov,3287by,2adamstoon,5,Sat Apr 11 17:27:11 2015 UTC,"Well if you look at other single payer systems, about 15% - 20% of all tax revenue goes towards paying health care cost, while the US is currently sitting at about 18.5%, so the US is already paying out a very similar amount of tax revenue, yet we still have tens of thousands dying every year due to not being able to afford health care costs.  What needs to happen is not necessarily MORE money, it is using the current money much more effectively. Eliminating redundancies is a good place to start. Hospital costs are high because they each buy equipment, supplies and medicine on their own. The first obvious cost savings is going to be having one government agency purchasing all of this in massive quantities, driving costs down due to bulk purchasing, then supplying hospitals with all they need at a much reduced cost. Then the operating costs go down due to hospitals not being forced to recover those monies spent. This brings down the total cost per patient and in turn brings down the amount of money spent on health care.  The next cost savings would be due to the fact people can see a doctor and not pay hundreds out of pocket, they will see a medical professional much sooner, and health issues are treated when they are minor, which in turn brings costs down due to not having to treat it once it has progressed into something major. A few dollars spent on co-pay for medication, and a few moments of a doctors time is much cheaper than tens of thousands of dollars of drugs, medical staff time, hospital stays and even surgery.  I would also take funds away from the massive bloated military budgets to help fund health care, but that is a discussion for another time."
ModelUSGov,3287by,brucejoel99,4,Sat Apr 11 18:09:34 2015 UTC,"To all candidates, what are your plans for science and education in the next term?"
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,8,Sat Apr 11 18:33:39 2015 UTC,Well for starters I would like to give students more control over what they learn. If students have some amount of control over the learning environment this will reinspire an enthusiasm for learning that has been largely lacking in our school systems. As my running mate said we would like to work towards more room in the budget for education. I hope that this will allow students to choose more unconventional education methods and subjects. The current education system creates obedient workers. We need to move away from this and create a system which creates enthusiastic learners.  I would also like to introduce some sort of universal peaceful conflict resolution and communication course. As this would be beneficial and help to reduce violence.
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,5,Sat Apr 11 18:22:15 2015 UTC,"GreenLeft will work towards organizing a budget that has more room for improved education programs, as well as scientific innovation."
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sharknado_1,2,Sun Apr 12 01:19:55 2015 UTC,"I think NASA will lead America in scientific innovations and discoveries. That being said, I would approve of the former NASA Budget Act with a few changes.  Education-wise, we have to get rid of Common Core. It burdens teachers with a set syllabus. Teachers need the freedom to dictate how they want to run their classrooms, because every class is a different class. Of course, they will need to follow a curriculum, but I believe they should have the freedom on how they teach information to fit the needs of each individual child."
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,2,Sun Apr 12 00:40:54 2015 UTC,"America has a rich history of technological innovation and scientific ingenuity. But after years of declining tests scores in math and science and a Republican administration IRL that often turned its back on science, the United States risks losing its scientific dominance. We are committed to reversing this trend by investing in the technologies and jobs of the future while increasing support for more advanced research, labs, and classrooms. And as for education, we share with all parents the commitment to prepare our children to lead lives of happiness and success. That’s why we’re dedicated to ensuring the next generation has access to a first-rate education and the tools to drive our economy forward."
ModelUSGov,3287by,ccommunist,2,Sun Apr 12 03:32:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure of the nature of the question.  My answer to the problems within our education system is not to just throw money at them.  We are paying much and getting poor results.  I would encourage school choice.  I think, also, that when a child is reaching the end years of high school, it might be beneficial to enable that child to learn more about subjects he/she is excelling in."
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:53:22 2015 UTC,"These are the two major points of my campaign. I want to focus on America leading the way in science, starting with the NASA Budget Act now, and by improving all stages of our education programs."
ModelUSGov,3287by,ccommunist,5,Sun Apr 12 18:49:36 2015 UTC,My followup would be specifically how would you improve education?
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,2,Sat Apr 11 22:38:50 2015 UTC,"Ending common core, giving freedom to the teachers."
ModelUSGov,3287by,Libertarian-Party,5,Sat Apr 11 22:42:42 2015 UTC,What do you mean by freedom? How would you give teachers freedom?
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,1 point,Sat Apr 11 23:06:46 2015 UTC,"Allowing teachers to dictate their curriculum, for the most part."
ModelUSGov,3287by,HammerAndPotato,4,Sun Apr 12 00:08:24 2015 UTC,"Do you mean teachers as in each individual teacher decides what to teach and what not to teach to their respective classes, or that groups of teachers (education departments, teachers unions, districts, etc) would decide what to teach for certain classes and subjects"
ModelUSGov,3287by,brucejoel99,1 point,Sun Apr 12 00:44:14 2015 UTC,"I mean that individual teachers would teach as they see fit, with loose standards of what a kid must know by the end of the year, allowing a teacher to morph their curriculum to the needs of the students."
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,1 point,Sun Apr 12 00:59:13 2015 UTC,What is your stance on vouchers and charter schools to give ALL children of cities and non rural towns options for school choice?
ModelUSGov,3287by,risen2011,3,Sun Apr 12 01:16:41 2015 UTC,"To all fellow candidates,  what is your solution to decreasing economic inequality within America."
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,10,Sun Apr 12 07:00:24 2015 UTC,I believe heavily promoting worker controlled business will lead to less executives and less administrative labour and consequently less income inequality. This is what I hope to do during my term in office.
ModelUSGov,3287by,HammerAndPotato,7,Sat Apr 11 19:50:47 2015 UTC,"We would work towards providing more jobs for the American people, as well as instituting progressive taxes so that the upper class pays their fair share."
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,3,Sun Apr 12 01:13:15 2015 UTC,"A /u/brucejoel99-/u/canadianman22 Administration will fight to strengthen our economy further and create jobs for American workers by ending tax loopholes for corporations, providing tax cuts to small businesses, investing in a clean-energy economy, and putting Americans to work rebuilding our infrastructure."
ModelUSGov,3287by,HammerAndPotato,3,Sat Apr 11 22:42:00 2015 UTC,The only way to bring people out of poverty is to see that they have jobs.  I would seek to make the US amenable to jobs by lowering the corporate tax rate and getting rid of regulations that are outdated and unnecessary.  There is little a President can do on his/her own.  It will be something I would like Congress to work on.
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,4,Sat Apr 11 20:53:31 2015 UTC,"To all candidates:  What steps would you take to assist the most economically vulnerable people in our society? Also, how would you ensure every American child has an equal start in life?"
ModelUSGov,3287by,HammerAndPotato,4,Sun Apr 12 18:41:18 2015 UTC,"I can actually answer both questions with one thing: the Societal Improvement Act. The bill suggests a complete overhaul of our welfare system, providing jobs and increasing effectiveness of American infrastructure. In addition, I'll be focusing on education this term, with either extreme reform or repeal of Common Core, and giving our children the chances they so desperately need."
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,4,Sat Apr 11 16:26:05 2015 UTC,"As someone who is very left-wing, this intrigues me and seems in line with what I would like to achieve. Could you elaborate on how you would provide said jobs and infrastructure improvements?"
ModelUSGov,3287by,HammerAndPotato,1 point,Sat Apr 11 16:47:05 2015 UTC,"As much as I hate to compare the bill to it, it really is a bit similar to the America Works program from House of Cards. The differences are that I support giving these people jobs in the government, not forcing people to hire them. The jobs come from the infrastructure improvements, and the infrastructure improvements come from the jobs."
ModelUSGov,3287by,risen2011,5,Sat Apr 11 22:40:43 2015 UTC,Soooooooo like the New Deal?
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,2,Sat Apr 11 23:08:26 2015 UTC,"Kind of, minus the NRA Blue Eagle campaign, and his tax reform proposals."
ModelUSGov,3287by,risen2011,3,Sat Apr 11 23:09:58 2015 UTC,Seems like something I may be able to get on board with.
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,2,Sat Apr 11 23:19:55 2015 UTC,"Wonderful! I understand you may feel obligated to vote for the GL ticket, but I hope you support me."

ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,3,Sat Apr 11 23:50:28 2015 UTC,"Also, you mention repealing common core, but what federal law is there regarding common core. From what I think I know, it's the states who choose to join the initiative if they wish. Correct?"
ModelUSGov,3287by,risen2011,1 point,Sun Apr 12 00:41:46 2015 UTC,"Yes. I would suggest legislation to take common core away. It's harming the futures of our students. I would suggest giving our teachers more curricular freedom, allowing some of our country's most important men and women the ability to teach our children as best as they can."
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,3,Sat Apr 11 16:50:51 2015 UTC,"Yes. I would suggest legislation to take common core away.   Ok, how would you do this without interfering with states' rights? (Or do states' rights not matter to you in regards to this issue)"
ModelUSGov,3287by,risen2011,1 point,Sat Apr 11 22:40:50 2015 UTC,"There is nuance to all issues. In this case, it is more important to me to help our students than do nothing."
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,4,Sat Apr 11 22:47:41 2015 UTC,So you would interfere with states' rights to get this done?
ModelUSGov,3287by,risen2011,1 point,Sat Apr 11 23:06:21 2015 UTC,It is a necessary sacrifice.
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,5,Sat Apr 11 23:18:46 2015 UTC,What is the Societal Improvement Act exactly?
ModelUSGov,3287by,risen2011,3,Sat Apr 11 23:24:54 2015 UTC,"It does 3 major things.  It lowers (not ends) our welfare spending. This both allows us to and mixes with the next step, which is getting America to work. People currently collecting unemployment benefits would be put to work on infrastructure programs such as interstate highways. This both gives people purpose and increases the effectiveness of American infrastructure.  Another effect of the bill would be immigration. I would increase focus on science, create jobs for both unemployed, and immigrated, educated people in the STEM fields, and once this is done, tighten our borders. This needs to be the last time the US does mass amnesty."
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,4,Sat Apr 11 16:48:33 2015 UTC,People currently collecting unemployment benefits would be put to work on infrastructure programs such as interstate highways.   How would this be done?
ModelUSGov,3287by,risen2011,3,Sat Apr 11 22:51:11 2015 UTC,"We would lower spending in other departments, and lower welfare spending in order to provide jobs in infrastructure programs."
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,3,Sat Apr 11 22:54:50 2015 UTC,What other departments? And would you simply provide openings or get people to work in some other manner?
ModelUSGov,3287by,risen2011,2,Sat Apr 11 23:11:58 2015 UTC,"Namely defense spending, but other places too. Mostly public works."
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,3,Sat Apr 11 23:19:31 2015 UTC,"Reading this again, this is interesting, but how exactly would this give people an equal start in life? And how would it help people who do not receive unemployment benefits that are ether working for next to nothing?"
ModelUSGov,3287by,risen2011,2,Sat Apr 11 23:23:04 2015 UTC,"The societal improvement also raises our minimum wage. I'm working out numbers with people in both the real world and the model one, but I'll give the people a full, straight answer soon."
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,3,Sat Apr 11 22:59:13 2015 UTC,"The societal improvement also raises our minimum wage.   Ok, are you sure you're a libertarian? And how high would this min. wage be?"
ModelUSGov,3287by,2adamstoon,3,Sat Apr 11 23:09:54 2015 UTC,"I'm sure I've got a yellow flair, but I'm not a very partisan person. I won't agree with an idea just because that's what the party wants. I'm not a yes man, I'm a very opinionated person, and if that's what you want, vote for me.  I'm working on the details, but most likely somewhere between 10 and 15 dollars."
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,4,Sat Apr 11 23:20:32 2015 UTC,"But you seem to stray far away from libertarian ideology. I only see minimal correlation between your and your parties views. It would be like me running for president on the G-L ticket, but expressing overtly liberal viewpoints.   You're aware that our model gov has a 10.10 min wage right?"
ModelUSGov,3287by,Yosoff,8,Sat Apr 11 23:24:49 2015 UTC,"Well for your first question I would say my running mate and I would like to abolish private exploitation of the working and middle classes. Most economic vulnerability in our society comes from the tendency within capitalism to create a flow of capital from the surplus value of those at the bottom of the food chain to the top. If we stop this exploitation the economically vulnerable people already have a ton more breathing room than they previously did. At that point we can start distributing jobs in newly created worker owned facilities.  With regards to your second question. I believe something needs to be done with inherited capital over a reasonable certain amount. Possibly creating funds for underprivileged children. The fact that you can just inherit a bunch of money and never lift a finger essentially has created a new set of inheritable kingships within our country, And this needs to stop."
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,5,Sat Apr 11 23:27:54 2015 UTC,"Follow up for you!  We know that private education is sometimes an alternative that can give a much better education than public schools. However, the problem is that many families simply do not have the resources to send their children to private schools. Would you place restrictions on private schools to combat this educational inequality (if not ban them entirely)?"
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,5,Sun Apr 12 01:36:06 2015 UTC,"Largely yes. At the college level I don't forsee it being a problem. If public universities have a very low or free price private universities will either have to lower their prices to a reasonable amount or close entirely.   At the high school level I think introducing some restrictions as to how private schools are run rather than outlawing them entirely would be more productive. If regular people want to create a community managed, student run school that is separate from the public system I think that is great. However I do not think it is great that there exists high schools that cost 40k a year and exist as bastions of privilege. I would be in favor of legislation that shows favor towards the first type of ""private"" school and restricts or bans the second type."
ModelUSGov,3287by,kuanica,2,Sun Apr 12 01:39:47 2015 UTC,"We would introduce tax cuts which our businesses need.  Also we specifically would lower the corporate tax rate. This is hurting jobs on American soil and causing businesses to outsource. I believe if we lower the tax, we can bring businesses, and jobs back to America."
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,2,Sun Apr 12 01:54:45 2015 UTC,"What steps would you take to assist the most economically vulnerable people in our society? Also, how would you ensure every American child has an equal start in life?    I don't seek to eliminate any welfare programs.  The best way for kids to have a good start in life is for their parent/s to have jobs."
ModelUSGov,3287by,brucejoel99,3,Sun Apr 12 03:23:09 2015 UTC,"To all candidates: The United States has the highest incarceration rate in world, an increasing number of for-profit private prisons, and police forces that are becoming increasing militarized.  Do you support or oppose these trends and what policies would you enact, if any?"
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,3,Sun Apr 12 19:17:27 2015 UTC,"Prisons should be moved to be more rehabilitation based. To stop the disturbing trends which you have listed, as president I would do my best to do a number of things within my power. In no particular order, ending the privatization of prisons entirely, stopping the war on drugs, ending the school to prison pipeline, stopping the flow of surplus military gear to the police, restricting if not prohibiting use of lethal force within the police. It is an ambitious list, but that is what I think should be done. Hopefully with the help of congress we can come to an agreement that will be in the best interest of those in and going to prison."
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sharknado_1,2,Mon Apr 13 18:35:10 2015 UTC,"I would be in favor of the federal government assisting all police within reason (obviously not undercover) to wear cameras that must be working at all times.  I voted for the abolition of federal mandatory minimums.  I would support an examination of the militarization of police.  Police need to have sufficient to protect, but not sufficient to oppress.  I do not oppose private prisons as long as they are subject to the same regulations as taxpayer-funded prisons."
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,3,Mon Apr 13 23:56:46 2015 UTC,"A question directed to all candidates;  Many in the nation consider our system of student financial aid to be broken. Among the rising cost of higher education, many students emerge from university with a bachelor's degree, an average of thirty-thousand dollars in student loan debt, and a job market that essentially forces them into graduate school. With interest rates in the range of 35% to 50% higher than undergraduates, a student who intends to further their education with a masters or doctorate degree could expect to face student loan debt in excess of two-hundred thousand dollars.  What are your views on the student financial aid system in the United States? Have you taken any consideration how your administration will deal with this issue? Where do you stand with combating the rising cost of college/university and loan interest rates?"
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sharknado_1,5,Tue Apr 14 03:34:33 2015 UTC,Student loan debt is a means of capitalist control over the middle and working class. They prevent people from being successful. I am in favor of creating a public education system from kindergarten to university. Allowing people to go to school for a vastly reduced cost or none at all. It is a temporary fix for a capitalist economy but one that is necessary given the current economic system.
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,3,Sat Apr 11 20:16:41 2015 UTC,"An /u/brucejoel99-/u/canadianman22 Administration will sign into law student loan reform, hopefully one that is a historic measure to make college more affordable for students and families and save American taxpayers roughly $68 billion over 10 years."
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sharknado_1,2,Sun Apr 12 01:16:57 2015 UTC,"There is not much that can be done with regards to the cost of colleges that would be the purview of a President, IMO."
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,3,Sat Apr 11 20:53:42 2015 UTC,My second question to all candidates: What is your stance on capital punishment and why is it right for America?
ModelUSGov,3287by,Canadianman22,5,Sun Apr 12 18:52:55 2015 UTC,I would disagree with my running mate on this. I do not believe in the use of capital punishment. Purely because the United States Justice system is obviously not infallible. I think it is better to absolutely eliminate the possibility of accidentally killing someone for something they did not do.
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,3,Sat Apr 11 23:46:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on the issue of capital punishment. Would you like to see a congressional bill prohibiting it, an amendment to the constitution explicitly banning it, or a SCOTUS ruling declaring it unconstitutional under the 8th amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment?"
ModelUSGov,3287by,brucejoel99,3,Sun Apr 12 01:47:15 2015 UTC,Any and all of the above is fine with me. I would prefer one of the first two though.
ModelUSGov,3287by,Cocktorpedo,3,Sun Apr 12 03:19:24 2015 UTC,You think a ruling would be unlikely with this current SCOTUS?
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,2,Sun Apr 12 13:20:05 2015 UTC,No I would just prefer a bill to be passed. Its a bit complex but I see codified rights as a ineffective manner of maintaining human well being.
ModelUSGov,3287by,brucejoel99,3,Sun Apr 12 13:26:27 2015 UTC,"My response is simple. I do not support it. Better 1000 guilty men rot, then even 1 innocent man hang."
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,2,Sun Apr 12 14:29:59 2015 UTC,It is an issue for the individual states to decide.
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,2,Sun Apr 12 22:26:36 2015 UTC,"I support the death penalty in the U.S.   Abolitionists may contend that the death penalty is inherently immoral because governments should never take human life, no matter what the provocation. But that is an article of faith, not of fact, just like the opposite position held by abolitionist detractors. The death penalty honors human dignity by treating the defendant as a free moral actor able to control his own destiny for good or for ill; it does not treat him as an animal with no moral sense, and thus subject even to butchery to satiate human gluttony. Moreover, capital punishment celebrates the dignity of the humans whose lives were ended by the defendant's predation."
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,3,Sun Apr 12 19:37:28 2015 UTC,"Abolitionists also contend that at a conservative estimate, 4% of death row inmates are innocent. They also contend that the death penalty costs significantly more than a life sentence. On top of that, they contend that it doesn't even work as a deterrant, that it causes psychological trauma for executioners.  But aside from the facts, you can also argue that the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment; you can argue that the death penalty isn't really attempting to fix situations, just act out some pathetic revenge fantasy; you can argue that it violates two internationally recognise human rights, and makes the USA a total joke on the international field (The USA being the only Western nation to still have it for civilians). But hey, who cares, they deserve it, right? They're only criminals!  What say you to this, considering that i have shown that the death penalty cannot be justified morally, economically, practically, or even legally?"
ModelUSGov,3287by,brucejoel99,1 point,Sun Apr 12 00:08:47 2015 UTC,"I believe that only in cases of murder is the death penalty applicable, and then only if there is no other viable conclusion than the convicted's guilt."
ModelUSGov,3287by,brucejoel99,1 point,Wed Apr 15 12:31:24 2015 UTC,"Might I ask about the death penalty in cases of rape, particularly of children?"
ModelUSGov,3287by,jsmith18486,1 point,Sun Apr 12 01:19:09 2015 UTC,"I, personally, hold a life sentence to be worse than a death penalty. I can absolutely see that there's room for disagreement there, but that's my thinking. Child molesters are commonly murdered in prison, and I'd rather put someone in prison than condemn them to death, because we can always reevaluate when the person still lives."

Secondly, why do you believe you are fit to run the greatest country on earth - specifically, what leadership and administrative qualities do you bring to the table?     I'd like to thank all of you for allowing me the honor of asking these questions directly to the candidates."
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,3,Sun Apr 12 02:28:35 2015 UTC,"With extremism on the rise in places like Syria, Iraq, and across Africa, how do you believe the United States should respond to these threats, if at all, and why?   The UN has accused ISIS of genocide.  ISIS is destroying ancient libraries and antiquities themselves in an attempt to destroy un-Islamic culture.  To me, it almost defies explanation why we have not gone to the UN to ask support for destroying a group that is too extreme even for Al Qaeda.  We should be helping to lead the world in sending a message that genocide and barbarity will not be tolerated.   Secondly, why do you believe you are fit to run the greatest country on earth - specifically, what leadership and administrative qualities do you bring to the table?   I believe that I have the skills to select a capable Cabinet and advisers who may have more experience than I do in certain areas.  I will be willing to listen to them.  In the instance of crises, I am able to keep a level head ... weighing all of the opinions and options before acting.  I respect the Congress of the United States and the powers that are theirs.  I have helped to lead the Republican Party and to contribute to its successful functioning in the ModelUSGov."
ModelUSGov,3287by,ben1204,3,Sun Apr 12 12:35:24 2015 UTC,"Following up on the first question; do you believe, upon authorization from the United Nations Security Council, that we should begin sending American infantrymen and women to combat this threat, either alone or with a coalition of allied forces?"
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,2,Sun Apr 12 20:12:45 2015 UTC,"If the UN Security Council agrees that this threat is sufficient to warrant force, I think that we and our allies currently have the air power to deal with it."
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,2,Sun Apr 12 20:16:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you for answering promptly. It's a shame none of the others, except for /u/brucejoel99, opted to answer the questions."
ModelUSGov,3287by,keypuncher,2,Sun Apr 12 20:43:12 2015 UTC,"My Vice Presidential Candidate, Vice President /u/canadianman22 answered plenty of questions."
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,2,Tue Apr 14 03:20:31 2015 UTC,"Not these questions, however, though he was not expected to, since mine were aimed at Presidential candidates. I'm speaking more about the Greens and Libertarians, who remain silent on the issue of extremism abroad."
ModelUSGov,3287by,jacoby531,2,Tue Apr 14 10:44:24 2015 UTC,"Obviously, we cannot give into ISIS threats and must continue helping dislodge ISIS from northern Iraq where it is engaging in ethnic cleansing against Christians and other minorities; kidnapping, raping and selling women; and massacring people. The U.S. effort should keep a special focus on helping America's loyal and ideologically moderate friends, the Kurds of Iraq. At the same time, the U.S. should make a strong diplomatic push to obtain international legitimacy for the campaign to defeat ISIS. It is important to prevent ISIS from scoring a recruiting victory among Muslims and anti-Western and anti-American camps by portraying this as a war between Islam and the West, which it is not. There's a quote I like to use whenever anyone tells me that America is the greatest country on Earth...    ""Just in case you accidentally wander into a voting booth one day, there are some things you should know, and one of them is: There is absolutely no evidence to support the statement that we're the greatest country in the world. We're seventh in literacy, twenty-seventh in math, twenty-second in science, forty-ninth in life expectancy, 178th in infant mortality, third in median household income, number four in labor force, and number four in exports. We lead the world in only three categories: number of incarcerated citizens per capita, number of adults who believe angels are real, and defense spending, where we spend more than the next twenty-six countries combined, twenty-five of whom are allies. None of this is the fault of a 20-year-old college student, but you, nonetheless, are without a doubt a member of the WORST-period-GENERATION-period-EVER-period, so when you ask what makes us the greatest country in the world, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about! Yosemite?"" We sure used to be. We stood up for what was right. We fought for moral reasons, we passed laws, struck down laws for moral reasons. We waged wars on poverty, not poor people. We sacrificed, we cared about our neighbors, we put our money where our mouths were, and we never beat our chest. We built great big things, made ungodly technological advances, explored the universe, cured diseases, and we cultivated the world's greatest artists and the world's greatest economy. We reached for the stars, acted like men. We aspired to intelligence; we didn't belittle it; it didn't make us feel inferior. We didn't identify ourselves by who we voted for in the last election, and we didn't scare so easy. We were able to be all these things and do all these things because we were informed. By great men, men who were revered. The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one. America is not the greatest country in the world anymore.   --- Will McAvoy, The Newsroom  Now, the administrative qualities I hold to be the President are that I've been the Chairman of the DNC since the last election and that I've been the Secretary of the Interior since President /u/Didicet ascended to the office. That may not be much, but w/ an experienced Cabinet, Chief of Staff, and Vice President /u/canadianman22 by my side, we can make sure America becomes the greatest country in the world again."
ModelUSGov,3287by,HammerAndPotato,6,Wed Apr 15 07:22:41 2015 UTC,Does the Democratic candidate for president make a habit out of quoting television shows for administrative advice?
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,3,Sun Apr 12 13:31:59 2015 UTC,"To all candidates: do you oppose austerity measures, why or why not?"
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,3,Sun Apr 12 13:34:45 2015 UTC,"I am against austerity measures because in a recession and liquidity trap, there is a rise in private sector saving and therefore strong demand for government bonds. Despite rise in UK and US government deficits, bond yields have continued to fall – suggesting that there is no immediate need to cut spending in a recession. The fear over rising bond yields in UK and US is misplaced."

ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,6,Sun Apr 12 19:52:11 2015 UTC,I do not mind taxing those US businesses that outsource the jobs to other nations.
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,2,Sun Apr 12 22:42:24 2015 UTC,I would say most of the members of my party are either marxist or democratic socialist. Of which I am neither. Although I would heavily Identify with both. I don't really consider myself one or the other.
ModelUSGov,3287by,Didicet,3,Sun Apr 12 23:23:20 2015 UTC,"To all candidates:  Given that interest on the Federal debt is over $220 billion per year with short term interest rates at 1/2 of 1% and $18 trillion in debt, that the historical average short term interest rate is 5.8% (and that it has been as high as 16%), that almost half the debt is short term debt (which means that since we never pay it down, we will be quickly paying higher interest payments on it when interest rates rise), that we have unfunded Federal liabilities of $205 trillion, and that we would need to increase tax revenues by 58% in order to fund those liabilities if spending  doesn't change, that 43% of income earners in the US have no Federal Income Tax liability, and that illegal aliens stay in the bottom two income quintiles (and thus have no Federal Income Tax liability despite consuming $billions in social services) even after legalization because they are largely unskilled, uneducated, and do not assimilate, that the 'War on Poverty' has consumed $22 trillion over the last 5 decades and has been an utter failure, and that a return to the historical average interest rate on the debt would mean $1 trillion interest payments within 3 years (increasing rapidly as more of the debt is rolled over at the higher rates and moreso if the rate goes higher) - money that would have to either come out of existing programs or doubling tax revenues, how do you propose to address the problems of the unfunded liabilities, tax revenues, and spending in your proposed budget to Congress?  [Edited to correct accidental use of ""rates"" where I meant ""payments""]"
ModelUSGov,3287by,Sheppio734,2,Mon Apr 13 23:46:49 2015 UTC,"Most of our revenue comes from payroll taxes and individual income taxes.  This is why, at this time, I do not favor any type of massive tax decrease.  However, we cannot thin the wealth and we should not spread the wealth.  We have to increase the wealth.  We must act to make the USA a desirable place to do business.  We need to consult with business owners to eradicate costly, onerous and unnecessary regulations.  We should, as soon as possible, lower our corporate tax rate to at least 20%.  Without citizens IN jobs, making money ... the income tax and the payroll tax dries up.  So first, we must become a nation that increases wealth.  Second, we must decrease the size, scope and cost of government.  It is wrong, however, to break the deal made with a generation of citizens.  We cannot change the Social Security bargain.  It is wrong to ask our compatriots who work to work to age 70.  Our average life expectancy is only ten years beyond that.  We must examine the cost of the federal government and begin to trim those things that are extraneous.  Wasteful spending needs to go.  Many pork projects are a ridiculous expenditure of the public's money.  Government should not be a make work program.  Its funding comes from the people.  We must do everything we can not to increase the size of government.  I stand opposed to nationalization of higher education.   I stand opposed to the nationalization of healthcare.  Vermont should be the canary in the coalmine.  Finally...  The Democrat candidate for President says that he favors open borders.  I believe that the greens do as well.  This is potentially disastrous.    Our immigration crisis must be addressed and the answer is not increased immigration and open borders.  We must clamp down on illegal immigration.  We cannot employ the citizens that are here and we cannot absorb millions more into the social safety net we set up, in good faith, for our own citizens.    Until we encourage business, examine and reduce the size of government and secure our borders and drastically reduce the possibility of illegal immigration, all other answers are yelling into the void."

ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,9,Sat Apr 11 15:36:10 2015 UTC,Absolutely. The founding fathers introduced the electoral college because they didn't trust the masses to vote for the president directly. I trust the masses to vote for the president directly. Alternative votes should be investigated to find the one that gives the people the most power and most say in who becomes president.
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,6,Sat Apr 11 19:42:46 2015 UTC,"I absolutely support Instant Runoff Voting. It helps to meld the lines between parties somewhat, and, as you can see from my above comment, I value that greatly."

ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,2,Sat Apr 11 23:29:37 2015 UTC,All candidates:  Do you agree with President Didicet's recognition of Palestine? How would you approach the issue of Israel and Palestine?
ModelUSGov,3287by,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,4,Sat Apr 11 23:32:28 2015 UTC,"I hope that with the recognition of Palestine, the United States can work towards a lasting peace between Israelis and Arabs."
ModelUSGov,3287by,2adamstoon,3,Sat Apr 11 23:34:41 2015 UTC,"Yes. I would like to work towards lasting peace in the area. This can start with the United States stopping using Israel as a point of leverage in the middle east, and letting the people there run their own affairs without us mucking it up."
ModelUSGov,3287by,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,3,Sat Apr 11 23:24:31 2015 UTC,The President's own Department of Homeland Security seemed to have issues with it.  My thoughts are similar to the mighty and powerful BSDDC.  http://www.reddit.com/r/ModelUSGov/comments/31hvp3/recognition_of_the_state_of_palestine/cq1xxz2  It is certainly worth hosting or encouraging all parties involved to discuss the issue.
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,2,Sun Apr 12 00:42:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do agree w/ your recognition of Palestine.  I have 2 ideas to approach this.   I suggest that the Palestinian sites in Jerusalem be giving ""diplomatic status"" (like embassies and consulates receive) and the Israelis would keep control of Jerusalem.  But the US and other nations would have to provide peacekeeping forces. A two-state solution will be clearly underscored as the only real alternative. Because a unitary state winds up either being an apartheid state with second-class citizens—or it ends up being a state that destroys the capacity of Israel to be a Jewish state. Once you put that frame in your mind, that reality, which is the bottom line, you understand how imperative it is to get to the two-state solution."
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,2,Sun Apr 12 01:44:48 2015 UTC,"To all candidates: if you were to win, how would you maintain good relations with Congress? Would you attempt to make bi or even quad-partisan bills?"
ModelUSGov,3287by,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,3,Sun Apr 12 19:35:30 2015 UTC,In the past Congress I have written bills that passed in a quadripartisan fashion and I have voted for bills that were quadripartisan in nature.  That is my record.
ModelUSGov,3287by,brucejoel99,2,Sat Apr 11 23:38:04 2015 UTC,"The way how you maintain good relations with Congress is simple. If there is an urgent need for America, and Congress passes a good resolution, you don't veto it! You have to work with Congress. Just because someone from a different party passes something, doesn't mean it is a ""bad"" bill. I believe we can achieve bi/quad-partisan bills and support within the next Congress if you vote for us.  Also, we would contact Congress whenever something like the Iran Deal happens. Before we come up with a deal, we need Congress's approval."
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,1 point,Sun Apr 12 04:49:36 2015 UTC,"One of my most important priorities is bipartisanship, in addition to getting things done. I would, if elected, work closely with my friends in Congress to get the bills that will benefit the American people on the floor and in debate as soon as they can be."
ModelUSGov,3287by,Yosoff,2,Sun Apr 12 19:39:52 2015 UTC,To candidates: Easy accessible loans that are hard to repay are given to college students with no credit history or collateral. Ending subsidies may force colleges to lower tuition rates to make them for reasonable for college students. What is your stance on continuing or ending Government subsidies for college tuition loans?
ModelUSGov,3287by,IBiteYou,3,Sun Apr 12 12:07:05 2015 UTC,I go into a bit more detail here  In short yes I believe in ending subsidies for student loans. I also believe expanding the public education system into university. So people can attend public colleges for free.
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,2,Sun Apr 12 07:13:53 2015 UTC,"It can be true that subsidizing something leads to more of it, but I see a need for the student loan program.  Without these loans, college may be out of reach for many deserving and diligent students.  At this time, I would continue the student loan program as the alternative that those on the left have is rather unthinkable.  They want to nationalize higher education.  No quicker way to kill off something than to nationalize it.  Who doesn't want the government telling the colleges what they can and cannot teach?"
ModelUSGov,3287by,AllTheyEatIsLettuce,2,Sun Apr 12 07:03:02 2015 UTC,"To all candidates:  The foreign policy of the United States assures our allies (a recent example is Great Britain) a ""blank-check"" of military support. The world's mindset is certainly anti-US, but, as it stands, the United States could defend itself against every single country on earth united against it and still be completely unharmed.   However, the desire to cut defense spending is not only nearly universal among current candidates, but an accepted part of the often-mentioned ""balanced budget"" that each slate mentions. How does an incoming president/vice president plan to decrease defense spending while both maintaining the U.S.' ability to defend its shores to the same level as well as pledge its notable support to its allies?"
ModelUSGov,3287by,rangerheart0,5,Sun Apr 12 14:29:04 2015 UTC,"Well the answer is not to cut defense spending. We have to maintain the military ""dominance"" that we already have, and we cannot afford to cut it. We have to protect America and her interests from all threats, home and abroad.  You also mention a ""balanced-budget."" This is also a very important issue because America is in debt trouble. The way we combat this by not reducing the defense spending is reduce government spending.  Around the board, we can find broken, and unneeded government programs that spending needs to be reduced in. Instead of cutting the necessary defense spending, we would cut spending/reduce spending for the broken government policies."
ModelUSGov,32883h,SeptimusSette,3,Sat Apr 11 13:28:13 2015 UTC,This is a wonderful day for lovers of privacy and the 4th amendment!  I hope Congress can continue with it's work on this topic.

ModelUSGov,32883h,Logic_85,2,Mon Apr 13 22:31:12 2015 UTC,"I will vote to repeal the Patriot Act, but it is my sincere hope that we can work with the next administration and with the appropriate Cabinet members to ensure that we are still protected and that vital agencies have the funding that they need."
ModelUSGov,321wpa,Didicet,2,Thu Apr 9 22:31:32 2015 UTC,"I would have hoped for a balanced budget but a 140 billion dollar deficit is a great improvement and I hope that next year's budget can be balanced, or perhaps even a surplus!

For you to try to tarnish ALL of your opposition parties collectively because you don't like things some individuals might have said is rather callous and seems calculated.  How do you ever intend to work cooperatively with them after saying these things?  Further... upon examination of the actual THREAD of comments that you are so direly concerned about suddenly, it appears that the Conservative you condemned was actually advocating against terrorist acts to further political ends.

ModelUSGov,31wl4q,InfernoPlato,5,Wed Apr 8 20:17:55 2015 UTC,I think that the issue is that the President of Ireland came before a Joint Session of Congress and said these things in an official capacity.

ModelUSGov,31wl4q,SeptimusSette,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:26:46 2015 UTC,Not at all. The President was calling us out for being racist and despicable. Those are personal attacks and we are not racist or despicable thus we can't be criticised on this basis.  The only way we can be criticised is via policy. I welcome that.
ModelUSGov,31wl4q,SolidBlues,4,Wed Apr 8 20:31:20 2015 UTC,"The President was calling us out for being racist and despicable.

Second, let's not pretend that a) there's any indication that 20,000 ISIS members will invade the United States without our incredibly restrictive border policies and b) that the majority of immigration is malicious in nature. The reality is that Conservative politics encourages the closing of borders not out of fear of violence or terrorism, but fear of perceived non-white invasion, as if the thousands of immigrants to the U.S. come to overthrow the dominant culture, not to find fair work and a good life.  Let's be honest, if the majority of immigrants to the U.S. were white, the Right's policies would be much more relaxed."

The reality is that Conservative politics encourages the closing of borders not out of fear of violence or terrorism, but fear of perceived non-white invasion,   This is not the reality.  I do not favor NO immigration.  I favor LEGAL immigration.  Your attempts to paint opposition to open borders as racist is offensive.

I think a nation's border policy can't be compared with my personal choices about my own space; it's poor thinking to conflate the two. My house isn't a world-wide destination where the un-privileged go to seek better opportunities; nobody attempts to enter my house to seek better living conditions and work availability.  The fact of the matter is that by having a closed-border policy inhibits the mobility of tens of thousands of good people and hard workers due to an exaggerated fear of what might be, what could happen. I can not and will not accept that reasoning.   Your attempts to paint opposition to open borders as racist is offensive.   Being offensive doesn't bother me. I will never hold my opinions out of fear of temporarily upsetting someone, and I hope you never do either. I will remain civil and fair, but I am willing to ""call 'em as I see 'em,"" as it were.  And I think it's fair to claim that the closed-border policies held by the Right are, at least unconsciously by some (although not everyone), inspired and influenced by racist and classist beliefs. One simply needs to observe how much easier it is for a ""white"" individual to get citizenship than it is one of color. One simply needs to look at the difference between the U.S.'s borders with Mexico and Canada.   If the immigrants all stated that they were going to vote for Conservatives...the left would be building walls tomorrow.   Are you suggesting that the Right's policies are decided by what's politically convenient? That the Right supports closed borders out of fear that it will increase the number of leftist voters? If so, than that is one of the most petty, politically-motivated attempts to hold power that I've ever heard of.

My house isn't a world-wide destination where the un-privileged go to seek better opportunities; nobody attempts to enter my house to seek better living conditions and work availability.   Only because your door is not open.  Why won't you open your door and allow 20 poor homeless people to seek a better opportunity living with you?   The fact of the matter is that by having a closed-border policy inhibits the mobility of tens of thousands of good people and hard workers due to an exaggerated fear of what might be, what could happen.    And your personal closed door of your domicile policy stops poor unfortunate people from seeking a better situation in your home because you ... why do you lock your door again?   Being offensive doesn't bother me.    Sadly, neither does being misleading.  We control immigration because we should.  It is the responsible thing to do.  I favor legal immigration.  There is no racism in supporting legal immigration.

Are you suggesting that the Right's policies are decided by what's politically convenient?    On the contrary.  I'm suggesting that the left's policies are dictated by what is politically convenient.  But again ...

ModelUSGov,31wl4q,tiocer,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:47:56 2015 UTC,"I won't address the ""your own house"" bits because I feel I have already sufficiently demonstrated the fact that personal domicile policies are incompatible with national border policy. I support providing affordable housing for everyone, especially the ""leeches on society"" as the Right likes to call them. It's the Right's oppressive and dehumanizing policies that make a conversation about how to deal with homelessness a necessity. I live in Detroit -- homelessness is something I encounter literally every day in a very personal, up-close manner, and for that reason is one of the issues most important to me.  I want to stress that I am not ""okay"" with illegal immigration -- I propose that we make the immigration process radically simpler, cheaper, faster, and more efficient so that the Illegal Immigration isn't even a problem. I don't think it's worthwhile (in the long-term) to simply address the problems themselves -- rather, we should address the social, political, and economic structures that create these problems in the first place. These structures are the racism, classism, and other prejudices that directly manifest themselves in many American policies, such as immigration."
ModelUSGov,31wl4q,InfernoPlato,2,Thu Apr 9 22:28:55 2015 UTC,"So, you think it is the role of Ireland to try to dictate US immigration policy?  That's fascinating.  Ireland itself does not allow the unchecked illegal immigration it would seek to encourage in the USA."

ModelUSGov,31wl4q,Gohte,2,Thu Apr 9 00:05:34 2015 UTC,"I recognise the IRA as a terrorist group, however I beleive remarks he made were delibertly worded to be antogonistic, which is something we do not need.  America has provided ongoing support, commitment and engagement in the peace process.  Northern Ireland has been transformed through the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Huge steps have been taken with the work of building a shared future, bringing an end to sectarian division, and to ensure that future generations will grow in mutual respect and tolerance is still a work in progress.  The Stormont House Agreement reached last December is a welcome step, further step forward.  As you might have seen, implementation can always be the hardest part of any agreement, and I urge the Northern Ireland parties, as America has done, to do all that they can to ensure that the current roadblock is overcome, as I’m sure it will be, and that the agreement can be implemented in full.    We therefore appreciate America's ongoing engagement and your support, and that of all our friends in the United States as we continue to build permanent peace and reconciliation in Ireland and oppose the comments which had a high chance of causing a rise in tensions."

One month ago.  Now you want to make it an international incident.  From my reading of the comments, it seems that it would be imprudent of the USA to jump to conclusions about the Conservative member's meaning ... since he clearly explained himself in the letter AND in the comment thread.  Frankly, when it comes to terrorism...which it what we was addressing, my thoughts are also, ""No surrender.""  To have come to us now with such alarm over his words from a month ago makes it appear as though you are trying to manufacture a crisis and tarnish the Conservatives."

ModelUSGov,31vs0o,loopmoploop,8,Wed Apr 8 19:07:14 2015 UTC,"This is an issue I'm deeply passionate about. In fact, I think the issue of unbound surveillance is one of the top issues and threats to Democracy as a nation we face. As Bernie Sanders eloquently pointed out the other day ""I'm worry very much about kids growing up in a society where they think 'I'm not going to read this book or explore this issue because someone may think I'm a terrorist"". Those who want to learn more about the issue should read about the Panopticon study; people, even if they may  be surveilled, will change their behavior in an undemocratic manner.  The most problematic section by far in the Patriot Act is Section 215. It allows for the seizure of any records relevant to an investigation without a warrant. This section was used to justify the NSA's bulk data program, because apparently the phone numbers we all dial are relevant to what terrorists are up to. Section 206 is hugely troubling as well; judges are allowed to authorize ""bulk orders"" of data, without describing a specific person to be searched. Section 206 and 215 go together with each other. Under Section 505, requesting NSL's for electronic letters is authorized. This has been used to shut down services like Lavabit, under which users desire to protect their privacy.  I think it's also important to emphasize that the Patriot Act is not even about terrorism; terrorism is used as an excuse to usurp civil liberties. In fact, only .5% of Patriot Act invocations in 2013 were even related to terrorism.  This is an incredibly important bill that must pass. I applaud the author. If you are interested in the issue IRL, I encourage you to write your representative, as I have done."

ModelUSGov,31vs0o,Canadianman22,5,Wed Apr 8 23:10:36 2015 UTC,I'm glad to see quad-partisan agreement on this! It was about time that this law was repealed! We want our freedom!
ModelUSGov,31vs0o,ben1204,6,Wed Apr 8 23:24:59 2015 UTC,"When the PARTIOT ACT was first brought into effect it was during a rough time in America and had noble intentions. However, it was unfortunately abused and went from a tool to protect Americans to a weapon that was turned against us. I am glad to see that this issue will be corrected and hopefully a new set of tools can be devised that are much more limited in scope and actually target those who mean to do us harm, while making sure the new measures will not be abused."
ModelUSGov,31vs0o,IBiteYou,5,Wed Apr 8 17:56:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I don't think there was ever noble intentions to it; it was originally proposed before 9/11, as something that didn't have to do with terrorism and the DC establishment used fear of terrorists to scare us into passing it. When in truth, the Patriot Act, was never really about terrorism."
ModelUSGov,31vs0o,IBiteYou,3,Wed Apr 8 20:50:27 2015 UTC,"I do think there were good intentions.  Remember, it was also written with a sunset clause."
ModelUSGov,31vs0o,PumpkinSmashing,4,Wed Apr 8 23:40:08 2015 UTC,"This is it exactly.  I suppose that we ought to hear from the Department of Homeland Security in the future to ensure, as you said, that they have the tools they need to pursue legitimate threats."
ModelUSGov,31vs0o,ThatAssholeYahweh,3,Wed Apr 8 18:11:18 2015 UTC,A great step towards sanity; we must also dismantle the Department of Homeland Security (and subsequently TSA) and bring back Immigration & Naturalization.
ModelUSGov,31vs0o,PumpkinSmashing,2,Thu Apr 9 23:17:18 2015 UTC,Surely we at least need to have some sort of rudimentary background check?
ModelUSGov,31vs0o,ThatAssholeYahweh,2,Thu Apr 9 23:33:47 2015 UTC,In order to fly?
ModelUSGov,31vs0o,PumpkinSmashing,2,Thu Apr 9 23:34:18 2015 UTC,"No, for those entering the country. I don't think it'd be the best idea to let anyone inside. Criminals, terrorists, etc. should surely be rejected? Hence why I I'm asking about background checks."
ModelUSGov,31vs0o,HammerAndPotato,3,Thu Apr 9 23:35:35 2015 UTC,"INS used to do all of this stuff until they were liquidated. The most prudent course of action right now (pending future, broader reform) would be to at least revert to how things were pre-9/11 as far as security is concerned."
ModelUSGov,31vs0o,ThatAssholeYahweh,3,Thu Apr 9 23:37:34 2015 UTC,"I most definitely support this bill. We, as a nation, do not have need for invasive security policies, and it's amazing to see how our entire House of Representatives is in agreement with this proposal."

Will these debates include the Senate hopefuls?  It would be really nice if debates and question threads could be announced in advance on their own threads... so that everyone who wants to participate has the opportunity to be informed about them.
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,SeptimusSette,5,Wed Apr 8 11:31:48 2015 UTC,"I don't see what this bill really adds to the first amendment. The Supreme Court has already declared the right to peaceful assembly a right under the first amendment. What effect do you intend this bill have on restrictions on time, place, and manner rules in place by state and local governments? would this completely do away with those restrictions?  I dont see the point of this bill other than to waste the congresses time pretending it is upholding the freedoms of Americans.   I also don't see what power congress has to affect the time place and manner regulations of state governments. This seems like an overreach of congresses power into state governments and risks being held unconstitutional. Please cite the appropriate source of power congress has in article 1 to pass this legislation affecting the rights of state governments."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,Logic_85,3,Wed Apr 8 14:07:07 2015 UTC,"I also don't see what power congress has to affect the time place and manner regulations of state governments.

I don't see what this bill really adds to the first amendment.   I dont see the point of this bill other than to waste the congresses time pretending it is upholding the freedoms of Americans.   The intent of this amendment (not a bill) is to do away with so called ""free speech zones."" Certainly it would have been more productive if you would had simply asked and not made an ignorant statement!

ModelUSGov,31v1yr,risen2011,5,Wed Apr 8 14:25:22 2015 UTC,"The power to amend the constitution does not grant Congress the power to control state regulations on time, place, and manner restrictions.  The proper place for the fight over just and fair time place and manner restrictions is in the courts, not by amendment to the Constitution.  I agree that time, place, and manner restrictions have swung too far in the interest of the state, and that a curtailment of their effect is warranted, but this Joint Resolution swings too far in the opposite direction.  You are replacing one extreme with another, and that is not good policy.  As others have noted, this will simply become an issue we push to the next generation, due to the laziness of the drafters in dealing with the REAL issue here."

Well, speaking of productive... maybe you should take this to our poor Model Supreme Court.  I hear they are looking for something to do.  Maybe they'd like to rule on this."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,IBiteYou,3,Wed Apr 8 18:56:31 2015 UTC,I'm going to take you up on that!
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,risen2011,3,Wed Apr 8 23:22:44 2015 UTC,That will make them happy.
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,IBiteYou,2,Wed Apr 8 23:30:30 2015 UTC,Actually the Supreme Court is not permitted to make judgments on tentative legislation. the proper course would be to submit a case for them to rule on that touched on these issues.
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,Logic_85,4,Thu Apr 9 04:57:19 2015 UTC,"No.  1) It is redundant.  The right is already guaranteed by the First Amendment.   The intent of this amendment (not a bill) is to do away with so called ""free speech zones.""    Sadly, this also appears to do away with private property rights.  ""account of time, place, or manner""  You do not have a right to peaceably assemble in a hospital, for instance.   Or inside my house."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,IBiteYou,3,Wed Apr 8 14:59:44 2015 UTC,"peaceably   No, it does not do away with private property rights."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,Gohte,6,Wed Apr 8 15:17:54 2015 UTC,Unfortunately.
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,oughton42,5,Wed Apr 8 15:59:20 2015 UTC,"One day, comrade, one day."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,IBiteYou,2,Wed Apr 8 16:41:43 2015 UTC,It does away with private property rights.  You can claim that it does not.  But as it is worded... it does.
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,laffytaffyboy,3,Wed Apr 8 17:59:29 2015 UTC,"No, somebody entering your house is trespassing, regardless of whether they are protesting or not. The act of protesting does not make you immune to laws that have nothing to do with protesting. There's no law against murdering somebody during a protest, but that doesn't make lynching people as a protest legal because the law applies regardless of whether or not it's part of a protest."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,IBiteYou,2,Thu Apr 9 02:42:27 2015 UTC,"Again ... I understand what you think that the intent of this amendment is.  I'm telling you what it says.  If people flood government buildings and occupy them ... are they assembling, or trespassing?  This is the problem."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,ThatAssholeYahweh,2,Thu Apr 9 18:29:03 2015 UTC,"Well, that's obviously illegal, but I'm sure that people will do it anyways. I doubt that this amendment is meant to make occupation of government institutions legal so much as eliminating ""free speech zones"" that have been established in light of certain protests."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,IBiteYou,2,Thu Apr 9 20:53:40 2015 UTC,The problem is with the wording of the amendment.
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,ThatAssholeYahweh,2,Thu Apr 9 20:56:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mentioned that above. It should definitely be clarified, and I also said that this shouldn't be an amendment all in its own, but added in as an additional clause within the 1st amendment, right after the Petition Clause."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,TheRealRailguy,3,Thu Apr 9 21:02:09 2015 UTC,"The thing about a right is that it is guaranteed in every case.  I am all for the peaceful assembly of people, but what if this peaceful assembly blocks critical function such as a highway or hospital, or prevents people from going about their business, such as blocking the entrance to a business or other service?"
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,risen2011,4,Wed Apr 8 13:01:39 2015 UTC,"I'd respond with the definition of peaceably.   Adj. inclined or disposed to avoid strife or dissension; not argumentative or hostile:   Blocking a highway, hospital or business could be seen as hostile, and therefore the protesters would not be protesting peaceably."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,TheRealRailguy,4,Wed Apr 8 13:23:50 2015 UTC,"The problem we have with our current constitution is that its too open to interpretation.  While I would agree with thos interpretation, in the future others may not.  We should define peacably assemble in this resolution if we are to ensure its longevity."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,IBiteYou,2,Wed Apr 8 14:24:21 2015 UTC,This Constitutional Amendment simply is not needed.
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,zachfess,3,Wed Apr 8 18:03:54 2015 UTC,The bill should have specific wording defining peaceably.
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,NateLooney,2,Wed Apr 8 16:23:14 2015 UTC,"could be seen     And that is the problem. There is no definition of peaceably or hostile in this joint resolution so as far as I am concerned, I could peaceably assemble on a highway, or in a hospital with the intent of not being hostile because this amendment lacks definition."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,laffytaffyboy,2,Wed Apr 8 15:09:24 2015 UTC,"People blocking the highway can be charged with obstructing traffic. People blocking a hospital can be charged with reckless endangerment, or something similar. These are crimes whether the people committing them are doing it as a protest or not."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,TheRealRailguy,2,Thu Apr 9 02:50:42 2015 UTC,"The problem with this is that you assume a right stops where a law starts.  Its the other way around .  A not clearly defined defintion of assemble could possibly make laws against obstruction of traffic or public endangerment unconstitutional or no longer allowed, as the right would take precedent."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,bsddc,4,Thu Apr 9 04:32:05 2015 UTC,So a rock concert in the middle of my neighborhood block at 2:00 P.M. is a constitutional right now?

ModelUSGov,31v1yr,IBiteYou,2,Wed Apr 8 19:48:46 2015 UTC,Reds with Solo cups.  I like it.
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,rangerheart0,3,Wed Apr 8 23:31:58 2015 UTC,Although I am not a huge fan of using the constitution to protect rights as it is too easily ignored. This is a good clarifying amendment. Some of you have addressed concern with regards to this being abused. I do believe that it would be prudent to pass legislation with regards to clarifying what exactly peaceable assembly means. Even with that with all privileges granted by the government. there is always some room for abuse. We see this in many of the privileges granted by the constitution. That does not mean we should necessarily revoke those privileges.
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,IBiteYou,2,Wed Apr 8 22:38:56 2015 UTC,The Constitution does not grant privileges.  The Constitution guarantees rights.
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,rangerheart0,2,Thu Apr 9 00:29:09 2015 UTC,"It can't really guarantee anything. The constitution can say people have the right to bear arms, but that doesn't stop people from trying to ban gun ownership. It can say we have a right to be secure in our papers. but that doesn't stop the government from creating programs like PRISM and XKEYSCORE. The rights ""guarunteed"" in our constitution are nothing more than privileges that the government is supposed to let us have.   I have heard people make the ""god given rights"" argument as well. Which doesn't really make sense either. Cause in that case americans only have like 10 god given rights, and the germans have a ton more. The UN universal basic human rights have 30.  If such a thing as rights exist they do not depend on whether or not they are codified in some 200 year old piece of paper that politicians can just ignore if they want, and they do not change based upon your nationality.   I consider rights privileges not because I am opposed to them, but because effectively that is what they are."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,IBiteYou,2,Thu Apr 9 00:35:21 2015 UTC,"Your thinking is very dangerous.  The Constitution is our foundational and guiding document.  It does not grant us privileges.  It guarantees our rights.   The constitution can say people have the right to bear arms, but that doesn't stop people from trying to ban gun ownership.    Some people will always try to do things that are unconstitutional.  Fortunately, the Constitution prevents the government from banning gun ownership.  I have rights.  I do not need to obsequiously beg the government for privileges.  That makes us servants of the State."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,rangerheart0,3,Thu Apr 9 00:49:04 2015 UTC,"Fortunately, the Constitution prevents the government from banning gun ownership.   It really doesn't. The document might say that the government cant do certain things. That doesn't mean the government doesn't do those things. There are many times in our history where the government has done things that directly go against the constitution. We can just look at the red scare, gun control, sedition acts, The NSA, the FBI, blacksites etc. Sure some of these things were ruled against but the constitution didn't prevent them from initially happening.   I have rights. I do not need to obsequiously beg the government for privileges.   You might not have had to, but the women in the women's suffrage movement did. The Blacks in the Civil Rights movement did. LGBTQ+ people of today and of recent history have had to.   That makes us servants of the State.   Yes in some instances it does, that isn't a good thing and should change."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,IBiteYou,2,Thu Apr 9 01:06:37 2015 UTC,"The document might say that the government cant do certain things.   It does.  That is what I am saying.  It guarantees our rights.  If government does things that are proscribed by the Constitution...the government can be challenged, as it has been in the past."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,rangerheart0,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:35:04 2015 UTC,"Yes I think we are largely shooting past each other. It is all well and good when the government doesn't challenge our ""rights"" but the constitution cannot physically prevent the government from violating rights, nor has it successfully done so in the past."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,IBiteYou,2,Thu Apr 9 22:29:57 2015 UTC,"Many things have been overturned on the basis of being unconstitutional, using the courts."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,keypuncher,2,Thu Apr 9 22:32:28 2015 UTC,"It can't really guarantee anything.    It can in a world where the people running our government actually follow the Constitution.    Our system was designed with the idea that the President, Congress, and Supreme Court all had limits on their power, and would all follow the Constitution - and that if one of them did not, the other branches of government would check that overreach.  We've chosen to put people in power - particularly recently, but going back quite a ways - who do not.  Obviously, when the people we put in power break the rules, and those appointed to check that behavior abrogate their responsibility to do so, the system fails - but that is true of any system of government.  The problem is fixable - but requires that we stop electing people to office based on identity politics, and go back to making adherence to the Constitution the primary consideration.  It may also require replacing a number of US Supreme Court Justices with that same aim in mind and for the same reason.   The constitution can say people have the right to bear arms, but that doesn't stop people from trying to ban gun ownership.   The Constitution does say that people have the right to bear arms, but it doesn't grant that right.  We start with it before government comes into the picture, as we start with a great many rights.  These are known as ""Natural Rights"" - an idea that predates the Constitution, and was a part of the Declaration of Independence.  What the Constitution does with respect to those rights is prohibit the government from infringing on, abridging, or removing those rights.  Because the rights do not come from the government, if the government abides by the document that created it, those rights are protected by the Constitution.  Where we run into problems is where people see the Constitution as an obstacle to be overcome or circumvented, rather than a hard limit on the powers of government - and make Unconstitutional laws (or Executive Actions) for whatever reasons - which the US Supreme Court allows rather than striking down as Unconstitutional.  With regard to gun control laws, that occurred because people were afraid that free blacks might arm themselves and pose a threat to whites - and so the laws were made, and the Courts allowed those fears to override their duty to the Constitution.  Those laws were then used as a basis to expand the infringement to all citizens.   It can say we have a right to be secure in our papers. but that doesn't stop the government from creating programs like PRISM and XKEYSCORE.   Likewise, the above programs are a result of the government allowing fear of foreign bad actors to overcome the 4th Amendment protection against violations of our privacy, and the US Supreme Court failing to protect that right.   If such a thing as rights exist they do not depend on whether or not they are codified in some 200 year old piece of paper that politicians can just ignore if they want, and they do not change based upon your nationality.   Rather, they depend on our willingness to defend and fight for them.  The Founders did so with blood and steel - they gave us the opportunity to do so at the ballot box, by electing representatives who will defend those rights on our behalf - and if need be, to fight for them with blood and steel again.  Consider: those who would ignore the protections of our rights in the Constitution on which our form of government is based, would have no less compunction about ignoring a law written and passed under that Constitution.  Further, making laws which duplicate the rights protected by the Constitution is dangerous - it says both that the Constitution itself does not prohibit the actions of the government against those rights, and it changes the source of those rights from Natural rights held by all men, to legislative rights granted by the government - and what the government grants, the government can take away."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,Sheppio734,3,Thu Apr 9 03:45:58 2015 UTC,"I fully support this bill, the idea that the citizens of the US should require conditions other than the assembly being peaceful to assemble is preposterous to me."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,IBiteYou,3,Wed Apr 8 23:09:27 2015 UTC,"Let me give you a for instance.  You are in the hospital.  You are scheduled for surgery.  Suddenly, folks think they have a right to peaceably assemble in the hospital.  They are peaceful, as they block the hallways and interfere with the day to day business.  It's a nuisance and causes issues with patient confidentiality because people are being wheeled to tests past people who decided to peaceably assemble in the hospital, but the people assembling are peaceful... so the huge burden on folks in the hospital who are trying to do their jobs and the imposition on staff and patients is ok, right?  Words mean things.  ""shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of time, place, or manner.""  So ... these people can stay all night, too ..."
ModelUSGov,31v1yr,Sheppio734,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:36:22 2015 UTC,"If they assemble in the hallways of a hospital, it isn't a peaceful assembly, as they are either interrupting the business of a government building if it is a government-owned hospital, or encroaching on private property if it's privately owned."

ModelUSGov,31v1yr,IBiteYou,2,Thu Apr 9 22:16:20 2015 UTC,This amendment has wording that allows assembly no matter the place.  It is poorly written and that is important.

The first amendment has very similar language which has been further clarified by several Supreme Court decisions. Really, the only thing legislation could achieve is to add a more specific definition of ""clear and present danger."" Under such conditions, limits can be put on the first amendment. Given the diversity of the situations which arise, however, writing blanket legislation which describes the exact circumstances under which clear and present danger exists is a difficult task to accomplish.

ModelUSGov,31r8ix,Gohte,7,Tue Apr 7 15:45:39 2015 UTC,"I thank the President for their nomination, we will schedule a time for a hearing and a final confirmation vote."
ModelUSGov,31r8ix,bsddc,7,Tue Apr 7 15:52:18 2015 UTC,"I would like to thank the President for nominating me. I hope that, with the next election cycle, the court can be more involved in this simulation. Thank you everyone for all the support! This court is going to do great things."
ModelUSGov,31r8ix,Prodigiousguy8,4,Tue Apr 7 16:33:00 2015 UTC,"I agree that we need to get the Court active and involved, if only to make the simulation more accurate."
ModelUSGov,31r8ix,oughton42,3,Tue Apr 7 16:44:39 2015 UTC,"We lurk around, and pipe in when necessary."
ModelUSGov,31r8ix,cmac__17,2,Thu Apr 9 01:48:08 2015 UTC,"I know, and I appreciate your work, but I don't think you would disagree that the Court's seriously under-implemented as of right now (which is no fault of your own). I think it should be the focus of the subreddit after the election (regardless of the results) to get the Court truly up and running, and encourage its use when necessary. Once again, your job is vital to the system and the simulation, and I cannot overstress how valuable your work is."
ModelUSGov,31r8ix,oughton42,3,Thu Apr 9 01:55:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your valuing of our work, or what we should be doing. I do agree that our role is limited at this point, since IRL SCOTUS looks over basically every law that passes through Congress and the Oval Office. I feel that this should essentially be our role here as well, and so far, the only thing we have discussed was the legitimacy of one procedure by Congress in the B001 Keystone XL Bill, before I was even appointed as a justice."
ModelUSGov,31r8ix,cmac__17,2,Thu Apr 9 21:57:14 2015 UTC,"Next congress, you will have ability to look over all bills after they are signed by the president. It will become an official part of the process."
ModelUSGov,31r8ix,cmac__17,2,Fri Apr 10 15:05:15 2015 UTC,"Just to ask, you would be resigning as Attorney General first, correct?"
ModelUSGov,31r8ix,Prodigiousguy8,2,Thu Apr 9 01:48:37 2015 UTC,I plan on doing so once a date is set for the confirmation hearing.
ModelUSGov,31r8ix,Logic_85,4,Thu Apr 9 02:59:42 2015 UTC,"Good luck in your confirmation hearing, hope it goes well!"

ModelUSGov,31rif5,IBiteYou,2,Tue Apr 7 22:47:22 2015 UTC,Why would we make a constitutional ammendment for a temporary issue.
ModelUSGov,31rif5,oughton42,1 point,Wed Apr 8 01:49:37 2015 UTC,"It's not a temporary issue.  It's a perennial one. The reason for requiring a balanced budget through an amendment is because it will take a very, very long time to pay the debt.  See... if it was done with a bill, the next Congress might just say...""We're undoing that bill that restrains our spending and pays down the debt.""  That's why."
ModelUSGov,31rif5,keypuncher,3,Wed Apr 8 01:53:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know what the Republicans were thinking   This applies to most situations. This bill is ludicrous, and prevents the government from doing its job."
ModelUSGov,31rif5,Logic_85,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:51:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe if those are actually duties, the government should figure out a way to pay for them rather than bankrupting the country.  The supply of money to pay for government programs is not infinite."

ModelUSGov,31rif5,IBiteYou,0,Wed Apr 8 01:48:57 2015 UTC,"Aside from the facts that Krugman is hard left and often wrong, he is wrong in this particular article in saying that the debt from WWII wasn't repaid.  It wasn't repaid in full to be sure, but we did pay down the debt after WWII.  We just haven't since 1957.    As I pointed out elsewhere, once the interest on our debt goes back up to historical average levels, we're going to get stuck with trillion dollar interest payments within 3 years.  If politicians take the usual 'kick the can down the road' approach when that happens, rather than drastically cutting spending or massively increasing taxes (or both) - which would cost them their jobs - then we will borrow the money.  Borrowing the money results in interest payments being higher than our revenues in about a decade, give or take.  How many investors do you think will be willing to loan the US money to operate at that point?"

The United States had already racked up millions in debt from the Revolutionary War. These writings center around the debate on Hamilton's plan to pay off that debt responsibly - not to increase debt on purpose through excessive government spending."
ModelUSGov,31rif5,keypuncher,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:53:21 2015 UTC,"It will also create a necessity for keeping up taxation to a degree which, without being oppressive, will be a spur to industry...   The point I'm trying to make is that if this bill prohibits a financial deficit for one year, and then 25% of revenues are constitutionally mandated to go toward paying off our debt, would that not eventually lead the debt to spiral down to $0? That's the point I'm trying to make, that zero debt is not a good idea."
ModelUSGov,31rif5,nacharj,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:25:37 2015 UTC,Why is zero debt not a good idea?
ModelUSGov,31rif5,Prospo,2,Wed Apr 8 04:08:53 2015 UTC,"First, off, at the end of Clinton/beginning of Bush lots of forecasters predicted we'd eventually reached zero debt. What would happen regarding Section 3 if we have $0 in debt? The point I think Hamilton made is that $0 debt can create complacency; we don't have incentive to work it off. And while I'm not for out of control spending, I think the 25% figure will hamper the government's ability to encourage growth.   Overall, I think this amendment would make us less productive as a nation."
ModelUSGov,31rif5,nacharj,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:17:04 2015 UTC,I believe in common sense.
ModelUSGov,31rif5,Prospo,5,Wed Apr 8 20:21:08 2015 UTC,So no deficit spending for a country that runs on deficit spending?
ModelUSGov,31rif5,nacharj,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:28:08 2015 UTC,The country didn't always run on deficit spending - and there was a time when we used to pay down that debt.

ModelUSGov,31rif5,laffytaffyboy,6,Wed Apr 8 02:21:37 2015 UTC,A horrible amendment that I hope and expect the prudent Congress will reject
ModelUSGov,31rif5,IBiteYou,4,Wed Apr 8 02:05:07 2015 UTC,"Several points I'd like to bring up:  Section 3: 25% seems excessively high, to force the country to go from spending over 100% all the way down to 75% of it's annual revenue is extremely harsh and will likely have a detrimental effect on the economy. Unless you plan on sending taxes through the roof, I just don't think it's feasible.  Section 7; Paragraph 3: While I understand the sentiment, this is unbelievably excessive. With the sections automatically being suspended during a time of war, any war lasting two years or more, will see nearly 2/3 of the government completely removed from office against the will of the voters who would want them in office. (My math might not be 100% accurate there. If somebody could check my work, that would be great.)  As for sections 2 and 6: There are lots of studies that suggest that deficits in large, stable countries (like America) actually provide economic growth, whereas surpluses create economic loss. To make such a drastic change that risks the economic stability of our country as we are still recovering from one of the worst depressions in our countries history would be a tragic mistake.  Despite the fact that I'm a socialist, as long as we're stuck in a capitalistic system, I refuse to accept something that would cause serious instability in the system. In the end, if the economy degrades, the working class will suffer the vast majority of the blow."
ModelUSGov,31rif5,IBiteYou,3,Tue Apr 7 21:09:37 2015 UTC,I commend you for taking the time to look at the bill and individually state and express your concerns.

ModelUSGov,31rif5,keypuncher,3,Tue Apr 7 21:57:02 2015 UTC,"Its not even a bill, its an amendment. That is the most mind blowing thing to me about this. I cannot consider making economic policy a part of the constitution."

ModelUSGov,31rif5,TheRealRailguy,1 point,Wed Apr 8 01:59:34 2015 UTC,I thought you might like reading about the Balanced Budget Amendment discussions.  Rand was an objectivist.  Personally I find objectivism to be too brutal.
ModelUSGov,31rif5,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:13:04 2015 UTC,"At our current revenues, 25% is roughly $750 billion per year.  If we stopped adding to the debt tomorrow, It would take us more than 20 years to pay it down at that rate.  The percentage can of course be cut - it is just a question of how much of our childrens' and grandchildrens' lives we want to dedicate to paying back the spending that we chose.   Paragraph 3: While I understand the sentiment, this is unbelievably excessive. With the sections automatically being suspended during a time of war, any war lasting two years or more, will see nearly 2/3 of the government completely removed from office against the will of the voters who would want them in office.   More specifically, all of them would be removed as their terms came up, and be ineligible to run in the next election cycle.  If the voters want them so badly, they can be re-elected the following election.  This section is necessary to prevent declarations of war for the sole purpose of circumventing the amendment.   As for sections 2 and 6: There are lots of studies that suggest that deficits in large, stable countries (like America) actually provide economic growth, whereas surpluses create economic loss.   The problem isn't the deficits - it is the debt they create.  With $18 trillion in debt, we are paying over $200 billion in interest with interest rates on the debt at 1/10 of 1%.  The historical average rate - which we will inevitably eventually go back to - is 5.7%.  In the 1980s, it went as high as 16%.  About 40% of our debt is in short term Treasuries, due in 3-4 years or less.  Since we don't currently pay down that debt, but instead roll it over, when the interest rate goes back to the historical average level, we will be making trillion dollar interest payments within 4 years - more if the rate goes higher.  Where do those who oppose this suggest that money come from?  If we borrow it, the interest payments on the debt will exceed Federal revenues in roughly 10 years.  How many investors will consider US Treasuries a good investment at that point?  Some claim we control the interest rate on the debt, and that is true... for as long as investors will purchase the debt at that rate.  When they decide there are better investments and put their money elsewhere, then we must raise the interest rate to attract that money back."
ModelUSGov,31rif5,IBiteYou,2,Wed Apr 8 03:04:40 2015 UTC,"I recognize that the Federal debt is an issue, however I fail to see how we can feasibly cut that much from the current deficit. Unless we want to raise taxes, I just don't see how we will make up the difference.  I also feel that this isn't the best time to do so. While  this is certainly a time critical issue, we're still recovering from a recession. The deficit is always the highest while recovering from a recession as it helps to speed up the recovery. I fear that completely removing the deficit at this point in time will only cause more economic problems."
ModelUSGov,31rif5,DidNotKnowThatLolz,0,Tue Apr 7 23:50:22 2015 UTC,"Unless we want to raise taxes, I just don't see how we will make up the difference.   The amendment doesn't prohibit raising taxes - all it does is require that what the Federal Government spends, it pays for.  In the current environment, it makes sense to be against tax increases, because the Federal Government doesn't use those tax increases to reduce the deficit - it uses them to justify additional spending over and above the amount of the tax increase.  Under a balanced budget Amendment, raising taxes (within reason) is a valid strategy to pay for the government that is desired.   I also feel that this isn't the best time to do so. While this is certainly a time critical issue, we're still recovering from a recession. The deficit is always the highest while recovering from a recession as it helps to speed up the recovery.   We've been spending more than our revenues for 58 consecutive years."
ModelUSGov,31rif5,IBiteYou,2,Wed Apr 8 01:14:51 2015 UTC,"We've been spending more than our revenues for 58 consecutive years.   I'm not arguing that we haven't and I'm not arguing that that's not an issue. What I am arguing though, is that that's a binary statistic. The world isn't in black and white.   I think a better comparison would be the average deficit, which I agree is way too high. Idealy, (assuming minimal accumulated debt) I feel the deficit should be just a hair above zero. (I'm not an economist, but with my limited knowledge, somewhere just above zero should be the theoretical ideal at which the increased economic growth makes up for the money lost in a way that doesn't actually increase debt. or something like that. There's a reason why I'm not an economist.) While I feel the average deficit should be close to zero, I also recognize that, as we're still coming out of a recession, the deficit should be higher than average and that this bill seeks to lower the deficit too much in too little time.  I feel that we largely agree on the end result. I'm just very hesitant, about the speed at which this bill wishes to move. I feel like, were this to include some sort of grace period over which this would be implemented, as well as an agreeable plan on how much and which taxes were to be raised, I would be far less concerned about the sudden shock to the economy. As it stands however, I feel the bill is just too abrupt in what it's trying to accomplish."
ModelUSGov,31rif5,Gohte,0,Wed Apr 8 01:49:05 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with amending it to take effect over a period of 5 or 10 years.  Once it is in place, Congress won't be able to legislate that away, as they did with the sequester.  The only problem we'll have is that the longer we wait, the greater the chance that interest rates will go up before it goes into effect - which will make the nation's fiscal issues much more painful to resolve."
ModelUSGov,31rif5,IBiteYou,3,Wed Apr 8 02:42:04 2015 UTC,"My god, what a glorious bill.  For people saying that the government would not be able to function, good.  Maybe it should rethink its definition of ""function"""

ModelUSGov,31rif5,Gohte,2,Wed Apr 8 03:11:41 2015 UTC,"I am worried about the amount of spending of federal government, but outright limiting their budget would limit the budget to the income the government gets through taxes. What if a recession hits? The government would have to immediately drastically cut spending which could hurt the economy even more. In addition, what if we are dragged into a military conflict? While I agree something must be done with the ever increasing national debt, I feel as though this is the wrong way to do it."
ModelUSGov,31rif5,IBiteYou,2,Tue Apr 7 21:32:57 2015 UTC,"Well... it says:  ""Section 7  In the event of the United States engaging in a declared war, Sections 2 through 6 of this amendment shall be suspended so long as the state of war exists."""
ModelUSGov,31rif5,DidNotKnowThatLolz,3,Tue Apr 7 20:38:41 2015 UTC,"We haven't officially declared war since 1941, so unless that changed, this wouldn't particularly affect anything."

I want to recognize Comrade Lenin's dream. Ever since I achieved a state of personal Full Communism, I've begun to eat better, exercise more, and be in tip top physical and mental shape so that I don't take a liberal attitude towards myself, as Comrade Mao warns against in Combat Liberalism.

ModelUSGov,31m99s,jacoby531,2,Tue Apr 7 02:07:16 2015 UTC,"http://www.popcenter.org/problems/child_pornography/print/  My concern is that this does away with the possibility of self-regulation.   Computer Industry Self Regulation   ISPs have a central role to play in combating Internet child pornography. The more responsibility ISPs take in tackling the availability of child pornography images on the Internet, the more resources police can devote to addressing the production side of the problem. However, there are two competing commercial forces acting on ISPs with respect to self regulation. On the one hand, if an ISP restricts access to child pornography on its server, it may lose out financially to other ISPs who do not. Therefore, it will always be possible for offenders to find ISPs who will store or provide access to child pornography sites. On the other hand, ISPs also have their commercial reputation to protect, and it is often in their best interests to cooperate with law enforcement agencies. Most major ISPs have shown a commitment to tackling the problem of child pornography. By establishing working relationships with ISPs, and publicizing those ISPs who take self regulation seriously, police may be able to encourage greater levels of self regulation. Current self-regulatory strategies include:  A number of ISP associations have drafted formal codes of practice that explicitly bind members to not knowingly accept illegal content on their sites, and to removing such sites when they become aware of their existence. Service agreement contracts with clients will often set out expected standards that apply to site content. Large ISPs may have active cyber patrols that search for illegal sites.[64] Establishing complaint sites/hotlines. Some ISP associations have set up Internet sites or hotlines that allow users to report illegal practices.[65] These associations either deal directly with the complaint (e.g., by contacting the webmaster, the relevant ISP, or the police) or refer the complainant to the appropriate authorities. ISPs can apply filters to the browsers and search engines their customers use to locate websites. There are numerous filtering methods. For example, filters can effectively treat certain key words as if they do not exist, so that using these words in a search will be fruitless.[66] Software that can identify pornographic images is also being developed.[67]"

You say ""it turned out to be an armed group outcast from the Hamas,"" and you are correct, there was skepticism from within the IDF. However, you fail to recognize several articles and speakers from within Hamas taking credit for the operation.   From The Telegraph  You might be referring to this, in which Hamas leaders said their men committed the attack, but also said their leadership didn't know.  Here's a good amount of detail on how Hamas members financed and aided in the kidnappings/murders.  Finally, this may be the source of your original claim. However, Mahmoud Abbas might be the worst source for that, as he's the President of Palestine."

And pledged this military support because Sweden wrote them a letter.  Also quite disturbing is a President who gleefully creates Executive Orders for the sole purpose of antagonizing his opposition at a point where they are prohibited from defunding them or proposing a  legislative check.  I hope no one had a trip planned for months in advance to DC on Friday, because you have given all non-essential federal employees a holiday and, as we know from the shut down in 2013, that means that the monuments will be closed.

Do you have some aversion to democracy when it produces results you don't like?  Look, I'm all for questioning the president's haphazard diplomacy, but your delusional red baiting in any post referencing the government that the Communist Party is a part of is starting to get offensive."
ModelUSGov,31keov,IBiteYou,1 point,Mon Apr 6 06:24:27 2015 UTC,Of course they were elected.  They have taken over.  I would imagine that it is the Communist government that so pestered the President for action over a harmless letter from Sweden that the President acted unwisely in committing us to support the UK no matter what action they choose to take.

ModelUSGov,31keov,theyeatthepoo,1 point,Mon Apr 6 06:53:01 2015 UTC,The response letter from the left government of the United Kingdom was expertly written and should be a model for future diplomatic discourse from the President of the United States.

His replies on that particular comment don't really suggest that he's joking, just that he thinks that senators have command over National Guard units."
ModelUSGov,31keov,IBiteYou,4,Sun Apr 5 23:34:11 2015 UTC,"'Responding' does not necessarily mean using military force.  I see what you mean about the National Guard thing though. Just as a heads-up, /u/Smitty9913, the National Guard is controlled by the governor of the state they reside in and is funded by that state, unless the Federal government calls on them and decides to take the reigns."

An executive order is a directive by the President of the United States that has the power of a federal law.  Presidents might issue executive orders to create committees or organizations like the Peace Corps. In general, though, Presidents use executive orders to direct and manage how the federal government operates.   We survived FDR's 3,522 executive orders and we survived GWB's 291 executive orders.

It has been argued that a Congressional override of an executive order is a nearly impossible event due to the supermajority vote required and the fact that such a vote leaves individual lawmakers very vulnerable to political criticism.""

ModelUSGov,31k6v7,AlbrechtVonRoon,1 point,Mon Apr 6 01:01:33 2015 UTC,"Irish-American Heritage Month:       Irish-American Heritage Month is a special proclamation issued yearly by the United States President or Congress to honor the achievements and contributions of Irish immigrants and their descendants living in the United States. The heritage month is in March to coincide with the Irish national holiday on March 17, Saint Patrick's Day. Heritage Months are usually proclaimed to celebrate centuries of contributions by a group to a country.  Saint Patrick's Day is a religious holiday that honors the saint who introduced Christianity to Ireland in the early fifth century, but the holiday has evolved into a celebration of all things Irish. Boston and New York City both claim the world's first Saint Patrick's Day parade, while Philadelphia claims to be the second oldest behind New York City. In New York City, it occurred on 17 March 1762, featuring Irish soldiers serving in the British military protecting the Colonies during the French and Indian War. In 1948, President Harry S. Truman, of Scotch-Irish descent, attended the New York Saint Patrick's Day parade and gave a speech to attendees. This was a proud moment for the many Irish whose ancestors had to fight stereotypes and prejudice to find acceptance in America. The proudest moment for many people of Irish Catholic descent was in 1961 when the first Irish American Catholic President, John F. Kennedy, reviewed the parade.  In tribute to all Irish Americans, the US Congress, by Public Law 101-418, designated March 1991 as ""Irish-American Heritage Month""  Congress again proclaimed March as Irish-American Heritage Month for 1995 and 1996.

Several people expressed a concern that the scientists in charge should determine the most important focus of the agency and not the President.  Sheppio said that he wrote this bill because he intended to be President and he was going to order NASA to build a space elevator.  2) The budget had been ironed out and the people involved in crafting the ModelUS budget said that the funding for this bill was not there.

ModelUSGov,31hvp3,jaywhoo,8,Sun Apr 5 16:10:49 2015 UTC,"While I applaud the President's decisiveness, I must warn against such bold maneuvers in a war-torn issue.   The history of Israel/Palestine goes back nearly a century, and after 1967 was fundamentally changed. To think that a peace can be brought to this region by simply recognizing Palestine is not founded on the strongest pillars. Namely, the recognition of a Palestinian state right now is pointless.   The ""state"" of Palestine does not exist by any declarative means, but instead it is many separated neighborhoods and holdings, none of which are contiguous.   Mr. President, you may have recognized the ""state"" of Palestine, but until your administration is able to bring the Israelis and Palestinians to the negotiating table we have not accomplished anything. This measure, while meaningful, is not going to alleviate any problems that Palestine faces, only a negotiated peace with Israel will do that.   But I hope you do bring them to the negotiating table, because what we need is peace in the region, we need it so desperately."

We can say a Palestinian state exists all we want, it does not make it true. Until Israel and Palestine come to an agreement no real progress has been made.

ModelUSGov,31hvp3,jaywhoo,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:25:07 2015 UTC,"A similar issue (not that I am criticizing our administration, of which I am a part) is that the 1967 borders of Palestine include several Israeli settlements-turned-towns, particularly towards the north. (Hezbollah territory.)  Recognizing a self-governing Palestine state has several other issues. Many exports, including some of the most basic, like water, would have to be transported through the State of Israel by Palestinian transports, an obvious security problem. Palestine, which is obviously in the desert, has only 3.5% of its water supply designated as ""potable,"" and  naturally the amount of water there is limited to begin with. Much of it is contaminated due to oil-well runoff from the neighboring countries.   Palestine, if recognized as a country, would have a GDP of around 7-8 billion, with an average of 2,200 income per capita. For its 4.5 million citizens, there are obviously hardships associated. Palestine also primarily uses currencies of neighboring countries, including the Shekel (Israel), Dinar (Jordan), and the Egyptian pound. These currencies are established and have, in comparison to some other currencies in the region, high exchange rates. If recognized, the State of Palestine could very well find itself in a 1945-1947 postwar Germany situation, where a barter system takes place to avoid the ruble/dollar/pound/franc conflict with then newly established Deutschmark. A barter system helped, but, obviously, with a lack of any notable per capita income, not to mention virtually no industry, agriculture, and horticulture, bartering would be limited at best.   I don't disagree with the resolution's intent by any means, but the establishment of a maintainable State of Palestine is much more difficult than penning the document."

ModelUSGov,31hvp3,IBiteYou,1 point,Mon Apr 6 01:27:37 2015 UTC,"Hamas Covenant:       The Hamas Covenant also known as Hamas Charter, refers to the Charter of the Hamas, issued on 18 August 1988, outlining the movement founding identity, stand, and aims.   The Charter identified Hamas as the Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine and declares its members to be Muslims who ""fear God and raise the banner of Jihad in the face of the oppressors."" The charter states that ""our struggle against the Jews is very great and very serious"" and calls for the eventual creation of an Islamic state in Palestine, in place of Israel and the Palestinian Territories,  and the obliteration or dissolution of Israel.   It emphasizes the importance of jihad stating in article 13, ""There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are all a waste of time and vain endeavors.""  The charter also states that Hamas is humanistic, and tolerant of other religions as long as they ""stop disputing the sovereignty of Islam in this region"".  The Charter adds that ""renouncing any part of Palestine means renouncing part of the religion"" of Islam.   In 2010 Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal stated that the Charter is ""a piece of history and no longer relevant, but cannot be changed for internal reasons.""  Hamas have moved away from its charter since it decided to go for political office.  In 2009 interviews with the BBC, Tony Blair claimed that Hamas does not accept the existence of Israel and continues to pursue its objectives through terror and violence; Sir Jeremy Greenstock however argued that Hamas has not adopted its charter as part of its political program since it won the Palestinian legislative election, 2006.  Instead it has moved to a more secular stance.  In 2008, the Hamas leader in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, stated that Hamas would agree to accept a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders, and to offer a long-term truce with Israel.  In contrast to this, Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Zahar stated that any talk of the 1967 lines is ""just a phase"" until Hamas has a chance to ""regain the land...even if we [Hamas] have to do so inch by inch.""  Other Hamas leaders, including Ismail Haniyah and Khaled Meshaal have also stated repeatedly that ""Palestine – from the [Jordan] River to the [Mediterranean] Sea, from its north to its south – is our land, our right, and our homeland. There will be no relinquishing or forsaking even an inch or small part of it,""  and that ""we shall not relinquish the Islamic waqf on the land of Palestine, and Jerusalem shall not be divided into Western and Eastern Jerusalem. Jerusalem is a single united [city], and Palestine stretches from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River, and from Naqoura [Rosh Ha-Niqra] to Umm Al-Rashrash [Eilat] in the south.""

Following a 1963 Draft Constitution the first version of the Charter was written by Ahmad Shukeiri, the first chairman of the PLO, using the slightly different name al-Mithaq al-Qawmi al-Filastini, meant to reflect its origins in Nasser's Pan-Arabism.  The first official English translation rendered al-Mithaq as ""covenant"", while later versions have tended to use ""charter."" (The word changed in 1968 in the Arabic name is translated as ""national"" in either English translation.)  The Palestinian National Charter was adopted on May 28, 1964, establishing the Palestine Liberation Organization, in (east) Jerusalem along with another document, variously known as the Basic Constitution, Basic Law or Fundamental Law of the PLO, based on an earlier Draft Constitution. The Charter is concerned mainly with the aims of the Palestine Liberation Organization, while the Fundamental Law is more concerned with the structure and procedures of the organization.  The Charter was extensively amended, with seven new articles, in 1968 in the wake of the Six Day War and given its current name.  Compared to its predecessor, it focused more on the independent national identity and vanguard role of the Palestinian people, led by the PLO, in their ""liberation of their homeland"" by armed struggle. Article 7 of the earlier document was changed from ""Jews of Palestinian origin are considered Palestinians ..."" to being restricted only to those ""who had resided in Palestine until the beginning of the Zionist invasion."" The final article providing that it can only be amended by a vote of a two-thirds majority of the Palestinian National Council (PNC) at a special session convened for that purpose was left unchanged.  The Fundamental Law was also amended, making it more democratic, electing the entire Executive Committee by the PNC, instead of just the Chairman, separating the post of the Speaker of the PNC from the Chairman of the Executive Committee and affirmed the authority of the Executive Committee over the army. Later, (Hirst, 2003, p. 427) a promised Charter amendment based on Fatah doctrine ""that all Jews [without date restriction]...were to be entitled to Palestinian citizenship"" failed due to doctrinal quarrels over the meaning of the precise nature of the proposed Democratic State.

ModelUSGov,31hvp3,A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS,9,Sun Apr 5 06:09:24 2015 UTC,"Just to discuss it, it depends on how you look at it.  From a military standpoint, Israel is surrounded on every side (except the ocean) by enemies, including inside its own borders and across the Biblical equivalent of the Berlin Wall in Jerusalem. They're economically very powerful, and certainly the most democratic nation in the Middle East, but their size is limited versus the combined strengths of Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, etc.  Large-scale Israeli military engagements are not a common occurrence. The one everyone remembers, of course, was the 2014 Gaza conflict, known in Israel as Operation Protective Edge. It certainly started with a brutal Hamas killing of three Israeli teenagers, then a tunnel (one of many from Gaza into Israel) collapsed and buried 15-20 Hamas members due to improper ammunition storage.  The Israeli response was decisive, to say the least. In the aftermath, around 80 total Israelis were killed, as opposed to 2,200 Hamas militants, civilians in the Gaza Strip, etc.  Israel, however, is not the ""Russian Bear,"" slumbering until someone pokes it. It's closer to a Roman phalanx, with spears at the ready. The well-known (at my office, and I work in the DoD, so not the best sample) Dahiya Doctrine, which can be read about here or, more easily, on Wikipedia here explains well the general mindset of Israel in its efforts to distance itself from a war of attrition against a guerrilla or insurgent force. (A goal from which many say the United States should also distance itself.) It's based on the idea of the (notably) ""disproportionate force"" used to end a conflict abruptly, swiftly, and with minimal loss of Israeli life. It's a chilling military strategy, but coldly practical. Here's a quote:  In [attacks along its borders], Israel again will not be able to limit its response to actions whose severity is seemingly proportionate to an isolated incident. Rather, it will have to respond disproportionately in order to make it abundantly clear that the State of Israel will accept no attempt to disrupt the calm currently prevailing along its borders.  That's courtesy of Gabi Siboni, a research fellow at one of the most highly regarded military tactics and analysis centers in the world, the Institute for National Security Studies.  It's easy to label the actions of Israel against the Palestinians as ""abhorrent,"" but there is a reason that Israel continues to require 3 active years of military service for all males, and 2 for all females; it is in likely the most vulnerable spot in the world in terms of modern military tactics."

Is it the same reason that they colonize the West Bank with new Jewish settlements, displacing, assaulting, and killing Palestinian non-combatants to further secure apartheid rule in the region? Was self-defense the motive when Israel shelled four children on a beach in Gaza? Was bombing established UNRWA facilities done in self-defense?  It doesn't look like anyone has a legitimate claim to justified self-defense but the Palestinians."
ModelUSGov,31hvp3,nacharj,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:01:28 2015 UTC,"You make solid figurative points, and such incidents can't be ignored, but if you're weighing the occurrences of indiscriminate killing, the scale is tipped heavily towards the side of the Palestinians.   As another point, this time regarding colonization, Israel did not invade and occupy a sovereign nation. It established small, peaceful, and isolated settlements (commonly known as kibbutz) that didn't infringe on the territory of the indigenous Palestinians, or at least the ones with permanent dwellings. (Many of the residents of the ""nation"" of Palestine were Bedouin and did not settle for more than a few months. My own grandparents were Bedouins in Syria, until they settled in Aleppo in their old age.)  Thats a digression, but perhaps the most important things to remember are the reasons that Israel has a right to self defense: in the seven weeks of the 2014 Gaza Conflict (Operation Protective Edge, as described above) alone, Hamas militants/Palestinian soldiers fired almost 5,000 rockets indiscriminately at Israel. Over the years since the medium-range ""Jihad Al-Qud"" rocket launcher was developed in late 2000, Hamas has launched a total of over 10,000 rockets into the State of Israel, some killing civilians, some intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome automated anti-missile defense system, and some exploding on empty land. The most recent version of the launcher, the Qassam III (as it is termed by Israel) has a range of almost 10 miles and weighs only a little over 22 pounds, making it easy for a militant to fire a rocket (the entire set up is only $800, including $350 per rocket), pack the launcher and ammunition up, and leave before any kind of surgical, isolated strike (such as a small infantry action) to be dispatched by Israel.   Again, the State of Israel is facing a similar problem to what the U.S. has faced for some 10-11 years: fighting an enemy that can't be recognized, easily identified, or, in most cases, even located, until they do harm. (The UN itself classified the tactic of Hamas/Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket use as ""explicitly designed to kill, wound, and terrify populations against which it is aimed.) the only difference between the Dahiya Doctrine and United States ROE is one is aimed to swiftly end a conflict, and one is balanced between the political sides of PR and the use of deadly force to eventually end he conflict.   I would be happy to provide sources for the both the number of rockets fired and their specifications."

Imagine that someone gives half of your state to China, and gradually over time, the Chinese part of your state grows in population and territory as people are shipped in to populate it. Imagine Chinese settlers start bringing bulldozers and construction equipment to the American areas, evicting Americans, killing Americans, and tearing down their homes. They are destroying your home and killing your people, so you start to fight back, but the Chinese hit back 500x harder and kill your women and your children with indiscriminate bombings.  This is Palestine."

ModelUSGov,31cuho,Sheppio734,2,Sat Apr 4 01:32:03 2015 UTC,"Really?  I honestly tried to stay within the rules.  But as the only conservative who showed up to the debate in a forum that includes so many liberals, I guess I shouldn't be surprised."
ModelUSGov,31cuho,keypuncher,2,Sat Apr 4 01:46:03 2015 UTC,There was one (politically) liberal in the debate: Didicet.
ModelUSGov,31cuho,Sheppio734,2,Sat Apr 4 02:50:38 2015 UTC,Uh huh.
ModelUSGov,31cuho,keypuncher,2,Sat Apr 4 03:26:48 2015 UTC,Do you think /u/rangerheart0 is a liberal?
ModelUSGov,31cuho,Sheppio734,2,Sat Apr 4 03:33:14 2015 UTC,"I consider socialist/communist to be liberal, so yes.  Your party is called ""green-left."""
ModelUSGov,31cuho,keypuncher,3,Sat Apr 4 03:34:06 2015 UTC,Aw.  I feel all neglected.
ModelUSGov,31cuho,rangerheart0,1 point,Sat Apr 4 03:34:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the compliment, but insults aren't really necessary."
ModelUSGov,31cuho,rangerheart0,3,Sat Apr 4 01:48:48 2015 UTC,"Its a pity that Didicet based his platform on vague promises with no plan on how to actually pay for them.  His idea that the Federal Government should 'take over' education isn't a power granted to the Federal Government by the Constitution.  By default, that prohibits the government from doing so without a Constitutional Amendment.  The plan to pay for college educations for all via taxation fails to address how much that would actually cost. 21 million college students, at an average of $22,958 per year for public universities comes to $482 billion per year - and since college costs are increasing at four times the rate of inflation, we can look to substantial increases in that over time.  That also assumes that if it were free, that more people wouldn't take advantage of government largess.  Where does that money come from?  Didicet proposes that the money come from the Defense budget - to which I will point out that our last President used the entire 2015 production of Tomahawk missiles in two days attacking Khorasan, and that we can see quite graphically in the present day what the consequences are of a US that fails to project a strong global presence: a destabilized Middle East, a destabilized Asia, and countries arming for WWIII.  I will say that his idea of restricting funding of elections to public financing could be a good one to remove money from politics if implemented properly - but this too would require a Constitutional Amendment.  Didicet claims that immigration is the 'lifeblood of America' - and so it once was.  We are no longer in a position however, where the American economy is constrained by a labor shortage.  Rather, we have a labor surplus, and as such, adding more labor is harmful to the country, not helpful.  We should take a cue from such nations as Australia and Canada, which have been taking steps to limit immigration to those who can be an asset to the nation beyond being an additional warm body competing for limited resources.  He also fails to note that we already have a 'pathway to citizenship' under current immigration law, for illegal immigrants.  They must leave the country, stay out for 10 years, and then apply to enter legally.  Anything else is giving them special privileges based on their having broken our laws.  I do agree with Didicet regarding the 'Stop and Frisk' program - particularly as implemented in NYC.  I have always said it was Unconstitutional, and it is problematic that the police department there continued the program after being ordered to stop by the courts.  The Mayor, and if need be Governor, should have stepped in. rangerheart0's ""democratizing the economy"" is shorthand for government confiscation of what people worked for, with the aim of handing it to people who did not... which works, once.  Then the people who create wealth get the idea that there's no point in doing it again since it will be seized, and next year there is nothing to seize to give to the people who still aren't trying to make it on their own.  His idea to push labor unions doesn't take into account that many employees neither want nor need them.  A good example is the recent case of the Volkswagen plant in Tennessee that voted on whether to unionize, and rejected the union - even though the union was being promoted by management in Germany.  When the vote was held again over concerns that it hadn't been 'fair', they rejected it again.  When they went to another VW plant in Tennessee, the same thing happened.  Sometimes, people recognize that unions are bad for them.  He also seems to have an idea that the police should be less well armed than the populace is allowed to be, and that they should not be enforcing the law.  How is it reasonable to expect the police to stop gangs armed with guns, when they themselves have none?  ...and if the police are not enforcing the law, who is?  rangerheart0 also believes we should make it easier for immigrants to get green cards and citizenship... easier than what?  At more than 1 million per year, the US already allows more legal immigration than any other country in the world - in 2006 it was 1.2 million, which was more than all other countries combined.  Right now we can't employ even 2/3 of our working age population at 1 hour per week, and less than half can find a full time job.  We're developing large immigrant communities that refuse to acculturate, and which demand we adapt our culture to suit them.  If anything, we need to reduce immigration until those issues can be addressed - not increase it.  We made it easy for the Tsarnaev family to get green cards and citizenship, and it cost a lot of good people life and limb.  rangerheart0 also has the same problem as Didicet (and to a lesser extent Sheppio734), in positing that the Federal Government fund college, while suggesting that the $482 billion per year to pay for it would come from cutting Defense spending, reducing bureaucracy and closing tax loopholes.  As with Didicet, I will point out that our last President used the entire 2015 production of Tomahawk missiles in two days attacking Khorasan, and that we can see quite graphically in the present day what the consequences are of a US that fails to project a strong global presence: a destabilized Middle East, a destabilized Asia, and countries arming for WWIII.  The only way to cut bureaucracy in the Federal Government would be to get rid of Federal employee unions, which I doubt rangerheart0 would be in favor of, and as for our tax system, we already have one of the most ""progressive"" Federal tax systems in the world - so all of that amounts to pipe dreams and suggestions that would be dangerous to our citizens - to say nothing of the danger to the rest of the world. Sheppio734 proposed getting ""very valuable illegal immigrants jobs in STEM fields"".  I don't know if he's paid attention recently, but that has been happening for years, via the H1-B and L1 visa programs, to the detriment of American workers, who are denied those jobs because they are filled by foreign workers at lower wages.  Further, since many of those jobs previously would have been filled by US citizens already working in the field, whose positions opened up when they took the more advanced jobs, filling them with foreign workers also denies US workers upward mobility.  As to unskilled workers, we have 12-20 million illegal aliens here already, plus millions more legalized in the seven previous amnesties - all of whom compete directly or indirectly with American citizens for those jobs Sheppio734 wants to give them.  When less than half of our working age population can find a full time job, the last thing we need is to increase the labor force competing for those scarce positions.  Like Didicet and rangerheart0, Sheppio734 proposes Federal college subsidies - though he suggests they be only 'partial'.  Aside from the cost, the problem is that if you subsidize something you get more of it at a higher cost - as the suppliers raise their prices to take advantage of the larger pool of available money.  Sheppio734 also proposes this be paid for by the policy of 'tax drugs' and 'lower spending in other areas.'  There are several problems with this plan, beginning with the fact that the US is a party to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs - which requires that Marijuana, the drug he wants to legalize, be illegal.  Changing that would require that we withdraw from the treaty, and then change both Federal and State laws.  Second, no Federal marijuana tax that people would actually pay (rather than growing their own) would pay for the hundreds of $billions in new spending he wants.  Third, he spoke of ""decriminalizing"" drug consumption with regard to other drugs.  You can't reasonably expect to collect taxes on drugs that are still illegal to sell, so there will be no revenue there. All candidates except IbiteYou missed on the spread of drug resistant dysentery.  It - like the recent cases of drug resistant Tuberculosis we have seen - come into the US via international travelers, who are often illegal aliens.  Secure the border, require that legal travelers coming into the US via nations where the diseases are a problem be tested for the disease, and much of the problem goes away.  IBiteYou also correctly pointed out that antibiotic research is a good place for government funding to address the problem, because it is one of the few areas where private enterprise is not well suited to address the public health concerns.   In closing, I find it interesting that the border security question asked by /u/adamstoon, which is very relevant to current events, was not allowed to be asked."
ModelUSGov,31cuho,Gohte,6,Sat Apr 4 01:40:40 2015 UTC,"This post is incredibly biased.

All candidates except IbiteYou missed on the spread of drug resistant dysentery.     Really? All of us missed? I deferred to people with much more expertise than I, and both Ranger and Didicet pointed out faults in our current antibiotic systems before IBiteYou even responded to the question.

You should be quarantined.  I know Wal Mart has the scooters and everything, but the responsible system puts those who are infectious into a quarantine."

As I pointed out, giving those jobs to illegals displaces American citizen workers and lower the wages for those who can find jobs in their field.   IBiteYou suggested quarantine as the solution.   /u/ibiteyou suggested quarantine as part of the solution - which is absolutely correct.  When you have a new, difficult-to-treat disease that is coming from outside an uninfected population, the best possible thing you can do to prevent infections is prevent carriers from getting into the uninfected population.  You don't just  throw up your hands and say 'Hey, its OK if the people our government is responsible for die now, in a few years we might have a treatment.'"

No, in fact, I have reached out to others to try to draft bipartisan legislation to stop it, and you KNOW that.  I was seeking the correct channels.  This represents a President meddling in a law before the Congress has acted.  It is unilateral action and I oppose unilateral action on the part of a President when there is a legislative remedy.   Ever since you announced your candidacy for president, you have taken steps to introduce and support more bureaucracy and more oversight.    Examples would be good.  I have not.

ModelUSGov,31ckse,IBiteYou,2,Fri Apr 3 22:10:33 2015 UTC,As you said ... UNDER the LAW... they have those powers.  The President is superceding the law by saying that they cannot use those powers.  The President should have waited for Congress to change the law.

ModelUSGov,31ckse,awwwcat,1 point,Sat Apr 4 08:24:43 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late response. I had a busy weekend and wanted to provide a well-thought out answer instead of canned answer.   I'll be honest, there a lot of conflicting perspectives on the issue from various, qualified legal professionals. Being that there hasn't been a ruling from the supreme court on the matter, I'm forming my opinion based on legal precedence.  The president's power in the vesting clause give him executive power, thus giving the president power to execute the law as he sees fit. Obviously, he doesn't have control over creating new laws, but enforcement is left to the president's discretion.   When dealing with immigration and the issue at hand, one must look to prioritization. While I agree that non-enforcement is an aggressively political move, it's one which has precedence. For example, cannabis is a Schedule I drug according to the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. Since then, however, several states have legalized the drug for medicinal and recreational use. While the laws are contradictory, the executive branch has left the issue to the states and will not enforce cannabis's status as a federally controlled substance, barring interstate issues.  The same principle behind this decision can be applied to the PATRIOT Act as well. The President feels, at this time, that it is a waste of the NSA's resources, and chooses not to enforce the the law because he has the power to manage the agency.   While frustrating, the constitution's vague nature means the executive branch has a lot of leeway in situations like this. If you have problems with that, I suggest drafting a constitutional amendment to change it. That would make quite a mess for the executive branch, however, and it would definitely give Congress some excessive power, if they are to decide what is and isn't being properly enforced.   I'm not saying I agree or disagree with the President's decision in the case, but that's my legal perspective on the issue. I hope it clears things up."

We already have the largest defense spending by ~500 Billion dollars over China, the second highest spender, and the only country other than Russia even conceivable as a threat in current times, not even that, considering their currently falling regard for North Korea."
ModelUSGov,31bznz,Sheppio734,2,Fri Apr 3 19:35:24 2015 UTC,"On what grounds would you lower the decrease of Defense spending?    Well, for one thing ... we have depleted our stockpile of missiles and those will need to be replenished.  Additionally, the situation in the Middle East is far from settled and may require us to intervene (with the assistance of our allies) in the future.  A number of nations are sabre-rattling and a strong USA Defense Department tends to quiet those sabres.  I think that it is reasonable to look into wasteful spending in DoD, but we, at this time, should not be rash with defense decreases."
ModelUSGov,31bznz,IBiteYou,2,Fri Apr 3 20:12:53 2015 UTC,500 bil is more than enough to replenish our missiles and prepare for possible intervention.

ModelUSGov,319q9r,Gohte,3,Mon Apr 6 21:17:36 2015 UTC,"I am 15, going to a private Catholic high school in Tennessee. I would probably consider myself somewhere in between a social democrat and a democratic socialist, so whenever I am asked I usually just answer something like ""I'm a progressive."" I am a big fan of Bernie Sanders and Noam Chomsky. I wouldn't say I am pro-capitalist or anti-capitalist. There are flaws with both socialism and capitalism and I believe that like the Scandinavian countries, we should stay in the middle to gain success. I support higher taxes on the rich to finance better social programs to help our nation in general, with healthcare, welfare, education, and the environment. We must end corporate welfare, stop the Koch brothers, and fight for anti-authoritarianism and anti-corporatocracy.  I am an honors student at my school and as a freshman take 1 AP course and 3 honors. Next year I will take 2 AP and 4 honors, the only normal class is our required Ethics class. My unweighted GPA is a 3.9.  About a year and a half ago, I began to become very interested in politics and government. Even before that, I always had an interest. I started out probably right in the center, and I have been moving left ever since. I have dreams and aspirations of one day holding political office in real life.  I enjoy studying languages outside of school (I know, really nerdy). I use Duolingo quite often. I have studied at least the basics of several languages. Spanish, Danish, Italian, Latin, and soon Czech and Esperanto. I hope to be a hyperpolyglot when I am older.  About 6 months ago, I realized that I am an atheist. I have sort of become an anti-theist, which is funny, considering my best friends are all either Catholic, Evangelicals, or like me, Atheists. It is hard, living in the south, not being able to tell my family, even though my friends are cool with it. I consider myself a secularist, and I would like to see more separation of church and state all across the world. I am somewhere between an absurdist and a nihilist. I often read about philosophy, another think I like.  In college, I want to major in either political science, economics, philosophy, classics (Latin ftw), linguistics, or psychology. My top schools at the moment are Notre Dame, UCLA, Vanderbilt, Northwestern, and Stanford, two of which, ND and Northwestern, I will be visiting this year on a college road trip with my school.  I run track at school, though I'm not very good. I'm in shape, but it's just that I'm a slow person. I'm running for my student government for next year. I am active in the Latin club at my school and up until I started track, the ultimate frisbee club.  Mountain Dew is my drink of choice, sushi is the best food ever, and when I'm not running track, learning languages, doing homework, keeping up with politics, or researching philosophy, I like to watch college football (when the season is happening), to hang out with my friends, or to keep using this amazing thing called the internet to research even more things, gain more knowledge, and find new interests.  I am so happy that I have been able to find such a wonderful community like this, and I plan on staying here for a long time. In this upcoming election, in the Democratic Party, I will running for a seat in the House of Representatives in the Mid-Atlantic District, and I hope that I can earn your vote!"
ModelUSGov,319q9r,risen2011,5,Mon Apr 6 21:18:22 2015 UTC,"Wow, I didn't realize how similar some of our backgrounds were.  I too am from the mid-Atlantic US--suburban Philadelphia to be more precise. I'm 19, and I'm a freshman going to college in upstate NY, studying industrial and labor relations. At school, I'm in a fraternity, participate in the music program (I play trumpet and French horn), write for the university newspaper, and do research on union contracts under a professor in the labor relations department. My career plan right now is to go on to law school and become a union side labor attorney. I'm also minoring in history and Spanish at school--I love history, and I'm practically fluent in Spanish. (Fun and kind of relevant fact: my grandfather was from Argentina and was a med school classmate of Che).  I was very politically aware from a relatively young age. I guess I've had pretty strong convictions since about 7th grade. I started out as a pretty run-of-the-mill liberal, but my politics started drifting left as I began to read more leftist literature over the past year or so. I'm still not super radical; I'm one of the reformists in the GL party and I identify as a democratic socialist. But I have strayed from my liberal roots in my belief that we should work to move beyond capitalism, as well as in my positions on other issues such as gun control.  But anyway, some more miscellaneous stuff. I have a 13 year old german shepherd who I love dearly. I love to travel, and plan on spending a substantial amount of my disposable income on it when I'm out of school and (hopefully) have a job. I'm also fairly into fitness--I hit the gym 5 days a week regularly. I'd seriously consider running for real life office in a few years--once I turn 21 and become eligible to run for state house--since my GOP rep runs unopposed every damn election.  Yeah, that's me I guess."

Re: Section 2 - 162   What about the American citizens that aren't proficient in English as of the passage of this bill? If official business is to be conducted in English only, doesn't this make it harder for working-class immigrants to say, register to vote? Would that be a hidden bonus to the Republican party?"
ModelUSGov,3178dj,Gohte,6,Fri Apr 3 17:41:02 2015 UTC,I believe there should be programs in place to teach those that have trouble speaking english or do not speak it at all.

ModelUSGov,3178dj,IBiteYou,7,Fri Apr 3 01:29:03 2015 UTC,"This is discriminatory to the millions of Americans who don't speak English and even more, 1 out of 5 Americans in fact, who don't speak English at home. What about towns all across the country in which people speak Spanish, German, Italian, etc.? What about Hawaii, where most natives speak Hawaii Pidgin in daily life? Yes, many of these people do speak English, but it may not be their primary language. The United States, has been, is, and always will be a melting pot of ethnic, linguistic, and religious diversity, and discriminating against those who aren't in the majority is wrong.  Due to the way our education system works, kids who speak Spanish at home, who haven't even mastered their first language, would have to learn to speak English at school, not only putting them behind at school, but also at their two languages. People can't be forced to learn another language if they haven't even mastered their native one.  This bill would promote monolingualism, which is bad. Americans would not be motivated to learn other languages. We would be quickening the death of hundreds of Native American languages, maybe losing their culture and people with it.  I am staunchly against this bill and I ask every Representative, Senator, the President, Vice President, and every other person here at /r/modelusgov to oppose this bill. To quote the Black Eyed Peas, ""To discriminate only generates hate, and when you hate then you're bound to get irate."" Don't let this pass. Pone un fin a la disriminacion!  EDIT: Why are you forcing them to read the Declaration of Independence? That English is very different from what we speak today and in 100 years could easily not be understood by most Americans. You might as well force them to understand Shakespeare, who is more similar to them than we are. Our language is not the same language as our forefathers."
ModelUSGov,3178dj,kingofquave,4,Thu Apr 2 18:13:49 2015 UTC,"Like I have stated before:  It states you have to  generally be able to comprehend it. I do not know why people think everyone will be forced to read the Declaration of Independence, and how unnecessary it is.  The bill clearly states you have to be able to read it; not that reading it is mandatory."
ModelUSGov,3178dj,2adamstoon,2,Thu Apr 2 19:32:18 2015 UTC,"Well, that would require you to have a pretty good comprehension of the English language, and that could take years. As I said in another comment on this thread, learning languages is hard. I have been studying Spanish in depth for about 6 months and I'm only at an A2 level, nowhere near being able to read the Spanish/Mexican/Argentinian/Cuban equivalent of what the Declaration of Independence is to us. You are effectively asking people to put aside a big chunk of their free time for the next several years of their life to learn YOUR language because they were unlucky enough to be born into a family that didn't speak English. That is disadvantaging a significant portion of the American people."
ModelUSGov,3178dj,kingofquave,1 point,Thu Apr 2 19:51:51 2015 UTC,"First of all,  I am in the same exact situation as you in learning Spanish. I also have about 6 months of knowledge of the language. I agree it is complex. And it would be complex vise versa. I believe I could learn it a whole lot faster if I were to move to Spain (for example) for 6 months.   With that said, to be successful in a nation which 94% of the legal US citizens speak English, you have to do the same. Like I've said in the past, we could start programs, initiatives, and even hands on experience with the English language (which is the best) to learn the language. You can actually learn a language faster, and better when you are surrounded by English speaking citizens, especially ones who are bilingual who can help you hands on."

It is wrong and it infringes on our freedom. This bill would disadvantage any American citizens who don't speak English even more than they already are. Even with programs to help, you will require people to give up a huge part of their time to learn your language. This bill would encourage us all to be standard monolingual English speakers. Many people are inspired to learn other languages because people around them speak it, but if everyone speaks the same language, what would be the point of learning another one if you wouldn't be able to use it?  The majority of people in Hawaii don't use English at home. More than 95% of Puerto Ricans uses Spanish not only in daily life but also in business. Most of the world doesn't speak English, and we would have trouble communicating and trading with them if only a small few could speak more than one language. Not only has this country and its forefathers seized this land from the original natives, effectively enslaved them, and forced them onto tiny reservations, but now we will take away their culture and language by forcing them to comply to our standards, because English is the ""real"" and ""historical"" American language.  No matter how much you think this bill is good, it would significantly screw over the 20% of Americans who don't use English at home and the about 10% who don't speak it all. This is a big f*** you to our culture in America, as being a melting pot of diversity, a country of immigrants, and in fact, a land that was once controlled by people who didn't speak English."

And you guys certainly are unwilling to even entertain thinking about the original intent of the 14th amendment.  I think this bill is justifiable for practical reasons.  A nation divided by languages is a nation divided.  Now... there are some folks who like the idea of dividing the nation ... but acknowledging that English is the official language would serve to UNITE people, by encouraging them to speak a common tongue.   Don't change the subject.   I didn't.  I'm just making note of the fact that you didn't want the states to decide Daylight Savings... you wanted it done nationwide.  Now...suddenly.... you are against making English the official language nationwide...preferring that individual states do it for themselves."

The problem with that is that once everyone speaks that common language, very few will have motivation to learn a new language, and even if they do, it would have little use unless they went somewhere else.  Forcing us to learn a common language destroys a lot of culture. I have ancestors that spoke German, Czech, Irish, and French who came here, and once they learned English, within 1-2 generations, the languages were lost. My great-great grandmother came from what is now the Czech Republic with her mother roughly 120 years ago. She was still accented when she grew older. My great-grandfather spoke Czech when he grew up, but as an adult knew very little. My grandmother, mother, and now me have no knowledge of the Czech language all because my ancestors had to assimilate into a culture that was very lingustically exclusive, and it left us no reason to use it. I plan on studying Czech some day, but it's use will be virtually nonexistent in America.  Your bill would do nothing but make situations like the one in this last paragraph occur more frequently, and in fewer generations. Yes, some would still speak other languages, but with the general conservative policy on immigration these days, fewer people will be encouraged to come into our country, bringing fewer new non-English speakers, which would pretty much kill any hope of having any use in this country for any other language than English. Those who speak other languages would not be encouraged to use it often and may lose fluency in not using it.  This bill does nothing but make it harder for immigrants to this country and non-English speaking citizens to assimilate into American society."

I agree with some other people in this thread, in that we should allow states to choose official languages, but not restrict it to just one. In 2012, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that 38.5 millions Americans used Spanish on a daily basis. If we are going to make English an official language, Spanish should be one too.  We need to change this idea in our culture that we all need to be the same. Diversity is the key to success. Most forms of hate and bigotry are based in some kind of animosity towards difference. This has happened with racism, sexism, one party states, hatred towards those of other sexual identities, religions, and any other characteristic you can think of.

The English speaking person would be hired because the employer would be able to communicate with him.  Why would you be opposed to something that could help protect the non-English speaking citizen.

Even if the intent wasn't outright racism, the bill in its current form does nothing but further marginalize a group that is already marginalized without giving them an avenue to comply with the law other than to spend their own money on language education, which is not possible for many working-class immigrant families.

ModelUSGov,3178dj,Canadianman22,2,Thu Apr 2 18:17:34 2015 UTC,It states you have to generally be able to comprehend it.   Section 163 is extremely important.  Why do we need section 163? For abiding with the law of course. People who do not speak English need to understand the laws of the land in order to not break them.
ModelUSGov,3178dj,Didicet,1 point,Thu Apr 2 16:59:01 2015 UTC,My criticism of the section focuses specifically on the Declaration of Independence.

ModelUSGov,3178dj,StopItWithThat,2,Thu Apr 2 17:19:21 2015 UTC,There isn't a problem in being able to understand the language. I don't think it belongs in the same category with the constitution and other laws.
ModelUSGov,3178dj,Didicet,2,Thu Apr 2 17:22:58 2015 UTC,"This bill seems overly redundant, so I will be voting no."
ModelUSGov,3178dj,IBiteYou,2,Thu Apr 2 17:27:27 2015 UTC,"This bill has me torn. On the one hand, I fully agree with the idea of an Official Language, while at the same time recognizing minority languages such as First Nations languages. When you come to an English speaking country, you should be able to speak and comprehend at least basic English.  On the other hand, this bill unfairly targets those who do not speak English, and does not give them a way to learn English. If you are going to require everyone to speak English in their public lives, you must also fund those programs that would provide an ESL education free of charge. You can not unfairly target groups of people and then force them to pay for it.  If an amendment is made that would made free ESL education for all citizens who need it, I would support this bill, however in its current form, I can not."
ModelUSGov,3178dj,DidNotKnowThatLolz,2,Fri Apr 3 01:48:32 2015 UTC,"Why is the standard of English set to the language of the Declaration, which is written in an out-of-date style of English, and our legal documents? Most Americans can hardly comprehend legal phrasing, let alone its massive amounts of jargon.  Also, as others have said, it is pretty redundant. It's already the official language of 31 states. If anyone goes to Congress and introduces legislation in Spanish or French or starts giving speeches in Spanish or French, they're not going to go far. It's the de facto language as-is, and that's good enough.  I would very likely veto this bill if it reached me. At the most, this is a state's rights issue. Language is an important part of culture, and every state has its own unique culture. It's what makes America so great! The people of the several states should be able to decide what language fits best for them."
ModelUSGov,3178dj,IBiteYou,2,Fri Apr 3 13:54:58 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree with you Mr. President.   If this bill would pass and need your signature, would you veto this bill even though 84% of Americans would support establishing English as our official language?"
ModelUSGov,3178dj,DidNotKnowThatLolz,3,Thu Apr 2 21:39:05 2015 UTC,Just because a majority agrees with something doesn't make it right.
ModelUSGov,3178dj,IBiteYou,2,Thu Apr 2 21:56:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would, because it's redundant and not within the federal government's power. I'm fine with it on the state level, but I don't see it as within the federal government's purview."
ModelUSGov,3178dj,DidNotKnowThatLolz,2,Thu Apr 2 22:35:07 2015 UTC,But we can make everyone get rid of Daylight Savings time?
ModelUSGov,3178dj,IBiteYou,2,Thu Apr 2 21:59:49 2015 UTC,"I think it is just somewhat impractical to have Daylight Savings up to the states. Hypothetically, you could go north and the clocks go back an hour, it just doesn't make a lot of sense."
ModelUSGov,3178dj,DEYoungRepublicans,2,Fri Apr 3 01:30:20 2015 UTC,"And I think it's impractical to have states that would have a different official language than English.  For one thing, our government is conducted in English."
ModelUSGov,3178dj,rangerheart0,2,Fri Apr 3 02:50:00 2015 UTC,I don't think a state is going to pass a law saying that a language other than English is going to become their official language since the majority of all people in America speak English as their first language anyways. I think it is redundant to make an official language now when we haven't had one for 200 years.
ModelUSGov,3178dj,DEYoungRepublicans,2,Fri Apr 3 03:04:36 2015 UTC,"Actually, elsewhere, someone is arguing that since a small portion of the population speak Spanish ... we should declare Spanish and English the official languages."
ModelUSGov,3178dj,2adamstoon,2,Fri Apr 3 03:08:09 2015 UTC,"Well I don't know who you are talking about, but I am just saying that the federal government doesn't need to make any official language."
ModelUSGov,3178dj,2adamstoon,2,Fri Apr 3 03:09:40 2015 UTC,"I think it does.  For one thing, we conduct the Federal Government in English."
ModelUSGov,3178dj,awwwcat,2,Fri Apr 3 03:10:48 2015 UTC,"I think this is a good bill, and should easily pass based on it's clear and concise wording.  The bill, however,  is only a fixing a small portion of the larger problem - illegal amnesty.   In addition to the illegal immigration problem, some consideration should include the importance of teaching our children English.  Such a bill may allow legal ground for improving or repealing the Common Core English standards, which have received bi-partisan criticism, including parents and Teachers Unions.   Common Core: A Step Backwards for English Standards Little attention has been paid to the academic quality of the mathematics, literature, and writing standards that NGA and CCSSO developed, despite the fact that they were not internationally benchmarked or research-based. The fatal flaws in the Common Core English Language Arts (ELA) standards went unnoticed because over 45 state boards of education and/or their governors hastily adopted the standards in 2010, in some cases long before they were written or finalized."
ModelUSGov,3178dj,IBiteYou,3,Fri Apr 3 03:11:44 2015 UTC,Would you mind explaining how this addresses a small portion of illegal amnesty?
ModelUSGov,3178dj,Smitty9913,2,Thu Apr 2 17:41:33 2015 UTC,"Illegal amnesty doesn't allow for, primarily Hispanics, to go through basic English education that they would have if they went through legal avenues of US Citizenship.  This is unfair to them as well since they are unable to communicate for higher paying jobs and opportunities.   This bill does not solve the immigration issue. But I think establishing English as the official language would at least encourage them to learn the language and in turn be able to seek better employment once they arrive. It would also help to avoid their misunderstanding of laws and rules that are written in English, allowing for a better American experience for them and others."

Most of the focus is put on those to the south because there are more than 11,000,000 living here illegally, compared to 75,000 from Canada.

ModelUSGov,314n1v,IBiteYou,3,Thu Apr 2 01:28:36 2015 UTC,Not a problem.  They were both legal residents.  Only ONE of them would have to be in order for a child to become an automatic citizen.
ModelUSGov,314n1v,awwwcat,9,Thu Apr 2 01:47:36 2015 UTC,This seems to me as nothing more than an attack on the families that seek a better and safer life for their children. To abolish jus soli as a means of citizenship in the US endangers children whose parents risk their own well-being to give them an existence away from the catastrophic social conditions in Mexico that are created by our own War on Drugs.

To go to another topic, the 2nd amendment was never meant to allow anyone to have guns for non-militia purposes, but fortunately it has been used to defend gun rights. Sometimes amendments aren't used for their intended purpose, and it is good that they are flexible in many situations."

But that can of worms is a red herring.  The problem with the 14th amendment as is, is that it is not good to have that flexibility.  Canada and the USA are the only two nations with birthright citizenship.  And the 14th was never meant to grant citizenship to kids of people here illegally."

This, to me, is cruelty."

If that same child were a middle-class US citizen and his parents robbed a bank and went to prison, that child would find himself in the foster care system, and perhaps in unfortunate circumstances.  That is not punishing the child - it is a natural consequence of the behavior of the parents.  They chose to take that risk for themselves and their child."

The US allows more than a million people per year to immigrate legally - more than any other nation.  In 2006 it was 1.2 million - more than all other nations combined.  Illegal immigration, however, is a crime.

ModelUSGov,314n1v,DidNotKnowThatLolz,1 point,Thu Apr 2 05:58:04 2015 UTC,"Birthright citizenship is one of the most valuable parts of our Constitution...   It isn't part of the Constitution.  It is defined by 8 U.S. Code § 1401.  The relevant part of the 14th Amendment, which I believe you are referring to, is:   All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside...   The phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" was intended to exclude American-born persons from automatic citizenship whose allegiance to the United States was not complete. With illegal aliens who are unlawfully in the United States, their native country has a claim of allegiance on the child. Thus, the completeness of their allegiance to the United States is impaired, which therefore precludes automatic citizenship.   The correct interpretation of the 14th Amendment is that an illegal alien mother is subject to the jurisdiction of her native country, as is her baby.   Australia rescinded birthright citizenship in 2007, as did New Zealand in 2006, Ireland in 2005, France in 1993, and the United Kingdom in 1983. This leaves the United States and Canada as the only remaining industrialized nations to grant automatic citizenship to every person born within the borders of the country, irrespective of their parents' nationality or immigration status."

The same argument you just used was made against it.   America has always stood head and shoulders above other nations when it comes to providing the opportunity for a better life.   Yes - but there are limits to how many people it can absorb at a time, and it has been far exceeding those limits for some time now, to the detriment of all its citizens.

We're also creating large immigrant communities that don't acculturate.

Obviously you have difficulty with anything but simple concepts, so I will explain more simply:  We cannot currently employ most of our working-age population at full time work.  If we import 9 new people and 8 of those get jobs, but we only created 5 new jobs, and all of the net job creation goes to immigrants, then not only did that job creation fail to get anyone off the social safety net, but the remaining 1 immigrant plus a minimum of 3 additional US workers go on the social safety net.   Immigrants work for this country.   So do US citizens - though not enough of them at the moment.   They grow your food, clean your businesses and do all manner of jobs to keep this economy running.   Again, so do US citizens.   While you and your party are content saying ""send 'em all back"", the Democrats believe hard work should be rewarded.   What about the US citizens who would like to work hard but cannot, because immigrants have taken the jobs they otherwise would have?  Should the government of the country they are citizens of not be acting on their behalf, rather than that of citizens of other nations?   Rather than spending the taxpayers' money on witch-hunting immigrants and deporting them, we believe a better solution is making them legal, documented, tax-paying citizens.   Sorry, but illegal immigrants pay no net taxes, even after they are legalized - as the bottom two income quintiles (and half the middle quintile) have negative effective Federal Income tax rates that more than offset the other taxes they pay.   Rather than blaming immigrant workers for a lack of jobs, we believe in growing the economy so there are enough jobs for everyone who wants one.

ModelUSGov,314uod,Gohte,2,Thu Apr 2 01:26:19 2015 UTC,"The Green-Left is a blanket socialist party and is mostly filled with anarchists (including our presidential nominee, no less). Why don't you think you'd fit with us?"
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,SeptimusSette,6,Tue Mar 31 23:29:56 2015 UTC,"This bill seems to be alright. However why is the president deciding what the NASA goal is?, I feel like the actual scientists and engineers at NASA would better understand that. Alright bill but sections 3 and 4 are weird."
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,rangerheart0,4,Wed Apr 1 02:03:10 2015 UTC,I agree with the general direction if this bill. I will vote yes if two things happen:  -Section 3 is amended to give power to the Director of NASA  -The budget is capped at 1.5% rather than 3%
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,jaywhoo,3,Wed Apr 1 07:26:33 2015 UTC,"Section 3 is kind of odd, but I support this bill."
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,loopmoploop,3,Wed Apr 1 00:36:07 2015 UTC,"Before I vote (it will probably be yea), I would like to see an amendment to section 3."
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,risen2011,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:58:12 2015 UTC,And what would this amendment be?
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,cmac__17,3,Wed Apr 1 02:44:50 2015 UTC,Probably giving the power to set an objective to the Directer of NASA as the main change (I would also be open to other additions to a proposed amendment).
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,risen2011,1 point,Wed Apr 1 03:11:27 2015 UTC,Okay. I was just wondering as you did not mention what the amendment would be in your original comment. I assumed it would be something similar to those already proposed.
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,cmac__17,2,Wed Apr 1 17:26:15 2015 UTC,"I agree wholeheartedly with my colleagues who submitted this bill. However, I do believe that the 3% requirement of the federal budget is too much. I would be more comfortable with a minimum numerical value that it would be linked to, instead of the percentage. As it is right now, this would quadruple the funding for NASA, which may not be the best allocation of funds."
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,bsddc,2,Wed Apr 1 03:53:59 2015 UTC,"That is also my issue.  I think that NASA needs funding, even though things like SpaceX are developing, but this seems like too large of a budget for the moment."
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,IBiteYou,3,Wed Apr 1 17:24:23 2015 UTC,I'm not sure how I feel about giving blank checks to NASA.
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,SomeRealShit,3,Wed Apr 1 01:39:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed. This act does not state the limitations of the objective, meaning what kinds of research and development will NASA be doing. Or even what does research and development mean.  Which of course, thanks to Section 3, is anything the President bids."
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,NateLooney,2,Wed Apr 1 02:37:58 2015 UTC,"Considering NASA is part of a government agency, and agencies are known for throwing boatloads of money away for the sake of ""using up"" their allocated funding, I have to agree with this statement."

ModelUSGov,30zjvh,white_anarchist_teen,6,Wed Apr 1 00:07:45 2015 UTC,The language could be amended.  NASA's director really should be the one proposing an Objective.

ModelUSGov,30zjvh,Sheppio734,2,Wed Apr 1 00:57:37 2015 UTC,Perhaps.
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,IBiteYou,3,Wed Apr 1 03:02:52 2015 UTC,"Wow.  Welp, I suppose it's better than Muslim outreach.  And here I thought you wrote this because you legitimately see a problem with NASA funding.  Before anything... we really ought to require that if we are sending our astronauts into space, we have the means to single-handedly bring them home again instead of relying on anyone else."
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,Sheppio734,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:02:15 2015 UTC,"Ok, I apologize, I meant my focus on Section 3 was a space elevator program. I do see a problem with NASA's current funding, I said as much in my Budget Committee testimony for the the Department of the Treasury."
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,IBiteYou,3,Wed Apr 1 00:53:50 2015 UTC,"I think my question would be what would qualify the next president, presuming that he or she might not be an aerospace expert, to single-handedly determine what NASA should focus on.  I know you involve a vote, which is good ... but I think that the actual scientists might be better at saying, ""For us... x area is someplace we feel that we really need to focus this portion of our budget because of reasons y and z."""
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,Sheppio734,2,Wed Apr 1 01:01:21 2015 UTC,"Looking back on the bill, that would be a more agreeable solution. Hindsight is 20/20. Perhaps the House will propose an amendment."
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,keypuncher,0,Wed Apr 1 01:04:21 2015 UTC,"One reason there might be opposition is because of recent Presidential priorities for NASA giving people the idea that its budget is just being used as a slush fund for other objectives.  For example, its priority to:  ""find a way to reach out to the Muslim world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science, math and engineering.""  Another reason is that it would roughly sextuple NASA's budget, to $120 billion.  That money has to come from somewhere.  Perhaps defunding the Department of Education.  That's almost the exact amount needed."
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,IBiteYou,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:10:30 2015 UTC,I wonder if the budget committee members have thoughts on this?  You have made some good points.
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,AllTheyEatIsLettuce,2,Wed Apr 1 01:18:53 2015 UTC,We submitted the House version of the budget to the Speaker. It didn't include a guarantee of $120B to NASA or a fire sale at the Dept. of Education.
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,IBiteYou,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:23:48 2015 UTC,Ok.  This isn't doable.  Thank you for chiming in.
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,keypuncher,0,Wed Apr 1 01:52:20 2015 UTC,So section 2 of the bill was omitted from what you submitted?  ...because 3% of our $4 trillion budget is $120 billion.
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,AllTheyEatIsLettuce,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:59:30 2015 UTC,There was nothing in the House Budget Committee's recommendation to the Speaker guaranteeing NASA $120B a year or requiring the agency to spend 20% of its funding on an objective.
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,Sheppio734,1 point,Thu Apr 2 23:44:40 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, 120B for NASA would be 8x less than this year's proposed Defense spending."
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,TheTrueDeathInEve,1 point,Fri Apr 3 01:05:10 2015 UTC,"I think section three needs to be amended. NASA should have to spend a portion of the funding on coordinating efforts with other space agencies. When it comes to space America needs to lead the way but also we need to pull other countries along with us. Also i think parallel space operations are better than serial operations using one shuttle. There are 7 billion people on a earth that only has 24,642,757 square miles that we can populate. That's only 0.00352 square miles per person. We need to do something about this soon."

If we had a rocket that we treated like the military (fixing it and upgrading it when needed), that could be used to rescue the crew that is stranded in space."
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,AllTheyEatIsLettuce,5,Wed Apr 1 02:46:23 2015 UTC,"I would rather have the U.S. be one of those countries that tags along in someone else's rocket.   Those other countries might have a problem paying for somebody else's rocket ride. Now, if we're talking a Multi-National Rocket Service that's publicly funded through general multi-national taxation, provides rocket rides free at the point of departure, and is available to everyone regardless of postal code, age, or military service record, that might be something I could get behind."
ModelUSGov,30zjvh,IBiteYou,2,Wed Apr 1 02:52:29 2015 UTC,I honestly think that we should have a space shuttle operational in case of emergencies.

ModelUSGov,30ray2,DidNotKnowThatLolz,4,Mon Mar 30 21:03:25 2015 UTC,I agree with this wholeheartedly.

ModelUSGov,30ray2,Gohte,11,Mon Mar 30 17:01:59 2015 UTC,"No, this is called equality. Maybe you have trouble with that idea.

I've been present and active during the most active part of this subreddit's current lifetime and I have just as much of a sense of what it needs as anyone else does.  As I said in the original post, above all this is a game, and handicapping an entire portion of its players for no reason is no way to run a game. What if Democrats and Green-Left were the largest parties and the mods of this subreddit said ""alright, since the republicans and libertarians are so small, they can only run in one region and can't officially run for president"". Would you still be crying about realism then?  This is a forum for a bunch of nerds like me and you to argue at one another, not an actual Congress. If you want realism, with all the corporate ass-kissing, political pettiness, and plutocratic nonsense that goes on, run for the real Congress. I'd shake your hand if you managed to get elected."

ModelUSGov,30ray2,Gohte,6,Mon Mar 30 18:36:30 2015 UTC,There are many candidates from various partys that run for the presidency in real life. Limiting the presidential election like you suggested is unconstitutional and would never happen in real life.
ModelUSGov,30ray2,NateLooney,3,Mon Mar 30 17:33:00 2015 UTC,"Limiting the presidential election like you suggested is unconstitutional and would never happen in real life.   It does happen in real life, but it's in the form of corporate media censorship of unapproved opinions.  This, for example. Notice which parties control it? Notice which parties have exclusive access to televised debates?"
ModelUSGov,30ray2,Gohte,1 point,Mon Mar 30 17:49:40 2015 UTC,Yes but it is a private firm. I'm saying that if the federal government itself limits the election process like this then it would not be realistic.

ModelUSGov,30ray2,CrossBowGuy237,2,Tue Mar 31 01:42:59 2015 UTC,I think it's funny because you hate Republicans.  You are basically saying I deserve to be the nominee of the party you hate.  It gave me a chuckle.

ModelUSGov,30ray2,Didicet,2,Mon Mar 30 05:49:45 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I am wrong Mr. President, (or anyone).  All seats will be up for grabs in the House.

ModelUSGov,30r98q,SeptimusSette,6,Mon Mar 30 00:56:23 2015 UTC,"The paternalism within this bill concerns me. I feel that this is an overstep in government which tells the people how they should think in regards to interspecies ethics, a place where government does not belong."
ModelUSGov,30r98q,jaywhoo,1 point,Mon Mar 30 17:29:17 2015 UTC,Where does government belong with regard to the research facilities it operates?
ModelUSGov,30r98q,AllTheyEatIsLettuce,5,Mon Mar 30 20:09:20 2015 UTC,The people operating said facilities know more about the needs of said facilities than a Senator or Representative that has no experience in the field.
ModelUSGov,30r98q,jaywhoo,2,Mon Mar 30 20:36:59 2015 UTC,The medical staff who chose to come forward about conditions at MARC probably had that very idea in mind.
ModelUSGov,30r98q,AllTheyEatIsLettuce,3,Tue Mar 31 02:06:32 2015 UTC,Could it be argued that in order for the government to research production they actually have to replicate the conditions on farms?
ModelUSGov,30r98q,IBiteYou,1 point,Mon Mar 30 03:12:40 2015 UTC,"It could.  But farms that permit thousands of animals to starve to death in the span of a few years, intentionally breed for twinning in cows (something any actual producer will tell you is an undesirable result for beef and an extremely undesirable result for dairy cows), intentionally breed for increased litter sizes in sows (already far in excess of the number the average farmed sow can feed to weaning age), and throw wool-breed ewes to the elements in winter to lamb on pasture aren't going to be in the animal farming business very long."
ModelUSGov,30r98q,AllTheyEatIsLettuce,2,Mon Mar 30 03:55:25 2015 UTC,"This bill, as I understand it, applies only to government farms?  Here's the problem I am seeing.  There could be very good reasons that the government would seek to raise animals in less than ideal conditions.  Ideal conditions may not always be available.  The government does some things that might be considered cruel, like raising feed fish in small tanks.  It's kind of neat, actually, they are able to feed themselves when they want to eat.  This might be something considered ""cruel""... but is actually a program that is looking towards a future where we may need to maximize food production in cramped conditions or extreme conditions."
ModelUSGov,30r98q,IBiteYou,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:57:21 2015 UTC,"This bill, as I understand it, applies only to government farms?   It is applicable to Federal research facilities.   Here's the problem I am seeing. There could be very good reasons that the government would seek to raise animals in less than ideal conditions.   The egregious, pervasive, and long-standing conditions at the US Meat Animal Research Center are what prompted the NY Times to undertake the investigation and publish the findings they did, and bi-partisan membership in the US House and Senate to submit H.R. 746/S. 388.  The practices this facility engaged in over decades, and still does to this day, are indefensible by anyone's standards. Other legitimate research facilities want little if anything to do with it, its practices, or its findings because the operators, as a matter of internal policy, violate the most basic standards of care to which the Federal government itself holds external organizations engaged in legitimate research. The research that MARC does engage in flies in the face of decades-worth of findings supported by both the USDA itself and numerous independent academic studies.   This might be something considered ""cruel""... but is actually a program that is looking towards a future where we may need to maximize food production in cramped conditions or extreme conditions.   This bill is not about cruelty. It's about senseless torture for the sake of ongoing funding."
ModelUSGov,30r98q,AllTheyEatIsLettuce,2,Mon Mar 30 20:07:55 2015 UTC,That article kind of confirms my reservations about this bill.  The loophole for the federal research facilities is there because there will be animal death in trying to discover ways to provide animals for food under less than ideal conditions and to do research aimed at maximizing production.
ModelUSGov,30r98q,IBiteYou,2,Mon Mar 30 20:54:06 2015 UTC,At first glance this bill appears to be a non-entity. The Secretary for Agriculture already has the authority under the current bill to enforce welfare standards for animals in Federal Government facilities. What does this actually change?   section 2(g)(3)   Where is this section and what does it actually say?
ModelUSGov,30r98q,Hlafward,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:51:05 2015 UTC,I don't see anything wrong with this bill at first glance. Treating animals well should be a requirement in all of these fields.
ModelUSGov,30r98q,AllTheyEatIsLettuce,1 point,Mon Mar 30 01:01:44 2015 UTC,"""Well"" is a relative term.  This bill seeks to remove the Animal Welfare Act loophole that exempts animals commonly ""used or intended for use for improving animal nutrition, breeding, management, or production efficiency, or for improving the quality of food or fiber"" from basic welfare standards afforded to other animal species in research facilities."

However, here are some party descriptions (and platforms if they have published one):   The Republicans are like the real Republicans (ranging from Establishment to Tea Party to center-Libertarian), though I think they have more moderates than the real-life party does. The Democrats are very big-tent and range from Blue Dog Democrats to Bernie Sanders-esque Democrats. You can read the Democratic Platform here. The Libertarians are much like real-life Libertarians. The Distributists hold economic principles in line with Distributism (every family should own their own business or part of their own business) and are social conservatives in a lot of ways. You can read the Distributist Platform here. The American Labor Party consists of social democrats and democratic socialists. You can read their platform here. The Green-Left Party consists of socialists, communists, anarchists, and those who generally oppose capitalism. The Silver Legion Party is a fascist party and are comprised of fascists, traditionalists, social corporatists, theocrats, and national socialists.

ModelUSGov,30mo3w,Eilanyan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:40:08 2015 UTC,"I guess I have pretty standard beliefs as a democratic socialist. I believe that healthcare should be tax-paid and universal, and not placed in the hands of insurance companies; that parents, both mothers and fathers, deserve paid leave so that they don't have to choose between not spending time with their children at the earliest point in their life and not being able to support themselves financially; that college education and childcare should be reformed so that they are more affordable for everyone.  What does set me apart a bit is that I derived these beliefs, as a Christian, from the Bible, and so some of my ideas might vary from everyone else's. For example, on the issue of unwanted pregnancies, I would say that the best solution would be to have better sex education, make it easier for people to raise children (through things like paid leave and childcare), and encourage adoption, as opposed to going straight to abortion or, equally as bad, just ignoring the problem altogether. I don't think that this makes me any less of a democratic socialist, however."

ModelUSGov,30b2aj,IBiteYou,9,Thu Mar 26 23:02:55 2015 UTC,"And it was so good until the last part.  You can't pass a bill that makes an unrepealable decision. Congress always has the option to repeal this bill, which would negate the last line anyways."
ModelUSGov,30b2aj,TheRealRailguy,6,Thu Mar 26 05:10:39 2015 UTC,"I think this is an excellent idea, however as for the last point on this bill, you can not block congress from being able to reinstate it at a later time. I believe that portion should be stricken from the bill.   The rest of it however is a step in the right direction. Studies have shown that a persons risk of heart attack jumps significantly during the first 3 weekdays AFTER the clocks go ahead in the spring time. Not only that but science has also proven that our bodies never really adjust to clock changes anyways. The time is now to remove DST and allow a smooth time flow year round."

Even amendments have the right to be reverted, and it seems like an ineffective or overly draconian clause. The rest of the bill sounds great."

ModelUSGov,301feb,SeptimusSette,3,Mon Mar 23 18:31:53 2015 UTC,"I agree with this bill - too many Americans are serving absurdly long sentences for non-violent drug crimes. This injustice must be put to an end, and this bill is an excellent first step.  However, I do have a problem with this bill. Do correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I can tell this bill leaves us with no sentencing guidelines. Are we to allow judges to choose years of imprisonment willy-nilly? Some form of new, more reasonable sentencing rule must be put in place instead of leaving us with mere air. Only then will I be able to fully support this bill."
ModelUSGov,301feb,loopmoploop,2,Mon Mar 23 19:11:13 2015 UTC,"This bill will not leave you with no sentencing guidelines. What this does if you read the full context of the law is remove the mandatory minimums. The maximums are still in place. This ultimately will prevent unjust-over sentencing by judges while allowing them to give lesser sentences to those who deserve it. We're only removing these mandatory minimums for non-violent drug related offenses, not child abuse or murder."
ModelUSGov,301feb,risen2011,2,Mon Mar 23 19:50:11 2015 UTC,"I was inferring that we would have no guidelines for drug crimes, not murder etc.  Thank you for your correction, I misinterpreted the bill. It now has my full support now that this has been cleared up."
ModelUSGov,301feb,loopmoploop,2,Mon Mar 23 22:25:12 2015 UTC,"This bill was supposed to go into effect immediately, I messaged the mods about this a few days ago as an addition to the bill. I'd like to see it added before it goes to a vote."
ModelUSGov,301feb,risen2011,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:50:59 2015 UTC,It will be added as soon as I can get on desktop.

ModelUSGov,301feb,Smitty9913,1 point,Tue Mar 24 23:27:46 2015 UTC,"Yea there is, look back a few months at the mod posts or might of been from before you were here. You can see every bill follows those rules."
ModelUSGov,301feb,risen2011,2,Tue Mar 24 23:46:57 2015 UTC,"Smitty, the post you are referring to also prescribes using whereas in the beginning of each section. We can infer from this that these are not binding rules. I could also say that this IS emergency legislation as people who are going to be given unjust sentences during the 90 day period will not receive justice. Also, it's not in the constitution."
ModelUSGov,301feb,IBiteYou,2,Wed Mar 25 00:10:46 2015 UTC,This is a quality bill that will have my vote.
ModelUSGov,301feb,risen2011,2,Tue Mar 24 02:11:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly the bill has been a long time in coming.  As long as it does not trample the states' rights to impose the penalties that they want, I do not have too much of an issue with it.  Section 1 as it reads here, though...I'm not sure what it does?"
ModelUSGov,301feb,IBiteYou,2,Tue Mar 24 21:01:26 2015 UTC,It should read The following selections from 21 USC §§ 841 (b) (A) shall be struck from US Code. It must have got struck out after Septimus fixed the into effect issue. I'll have it written back in before the vote finalizes.

ModelUSGov,301feb,Canadianman22,2,Tue Mar 24 21:23:49 2015 UTC,I support this bill and hope both that both the left and the right can agree that mandatory minimums wrongly do not allow judges' discretion to be properly weighed into the decision of sentencing.
ModelUSGov,301feb,risen2011,1 point,Tue Mar 24 21:34:41 2015 UTC,"I like the idea behind this bill as too many Americans are given harsh prison terms when they are not warranted.  However, I do wonder if an addition could be considered that would allow state law to supersede federal law when it comes to the issue of drug legalization. As it currently stands, courts have ruled that Federal law, which is a one size fits all, trumps state law when they conflict with each. When the citizens in a state decide a drug like marijuana should be legal and taxed within that state, that should make the Federal law regarding that drug non-applicable within that state, while state laws would take over.   This would allow people to express their democratic right and allow them to decide what is and is not acceptable within their state."
ModelUSGov,301feb,AllTheyEatIsLettuce,2,Mon Mar 23 19:42:20 2015 UTC,"I like your idea about states rights and do think it's very important, but what this bill is designed to do is not the further the cause of drug legalization, but rather reduce sentences for those who are convicted of drug crimes. The issue you are referencing would probably warrant separate legislation."
ModelUSGov,301feb,risen2011,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:53:50 2015 UTC,Can a person be sentenced under these guidelines to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole?
ModelUSGov,2zs0bu,SeptimusSette,10,Sat Mar 21 04:26:42 2015 UTC,I feel like this is a common sense motion. It's unreal that we still celebrate a day dedicated to a genocidal colonialist maniac.
ModelUSGov,2zs0bu,Gohte,4,Sat Mar 21 04:38:23 2015 UTC,Why do you Suport communism then
ModelUSGov,2zs0bu,Smitty9913,5,Sat Mar 21 19:10:51 2015 UTC,"Considering that you are someone who has himself admitted he doesn't know what communism is, and came to me to learn about it, I really don't understand what it is you think you're trying to do here.  Even more, this certainly isn't the place. Stay on topic please."
ModelUSGov,2zs0bu,Gohte,3,Sat Mar 21 19:24:26 2015 UTC,You seem afriad to answer the question
ModelUSGov,2zs0bu,Smitty9913,8,Sat Mar 21 20:37:46 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent bill. I fully support the removal of a holiday which celebrates the achievements of a brutal, cruel, and genocidal man, and puts in its place a remembrance and celebration of the immigrants who helped made this country what it is.  The only point I disagree with is the passage in Subsection 2 reading ""that we are a nation of immigrants"" since it excludes the fact that Native Americans are also part of this nation. Instead I would propose replacing it with the wording ""that we are a nation greatly benefited by the arrival of immigrants"" as it is a bit more inclusive.   Aside from that, a wonderful bill, and I throw my full support behind it."
ModelUSGov,2zs0bu,loopmoploop,4,Sat Mar 21 04:41:26 2015 UTC,Is there a process by which we can amend this?
ModelUSGov,2zs0bu,risen2011,3,Sat Mar 21 05:18:44 2015 UTC,Why are you moving the date?   You do realize that many of these immigrants you wish to celebrate did more harm to Native Americans than Columbus ever did.  How about a Flag day or a constitution day or an Election day?
ModelUSGov,2zs0bu,schultejt,1 point,Sat Mar 21 07:36:00 2015 UTC,Why are you moving the date?    That is a good question.
ModelUSGov,2zs0bu,IBiteYou,1 point,Sat Mar 21 09:19:08 2015 UTC,"I would support recognising Election day as a Federal holiday. Flag day and Constitution day are both already national holidays, however I would support also recognizing them as Federal holidays."
ModelUSGov,2zs0bu,laffytaffyboy,5,Sun Mar 22 01:09:54 2015 UTC,"I would prefer ""American Heritage Day"" as an inclusive name for a holiday to replace Columbus Day."
ModelUSGov,2zs0bu,IBiteYou,7,Sat Mar 21 05:07:55 2015 UTC,I'd rather just 'Heritage Day'.
ModelUSGov,2zs0bu,Gohte,2,Sat Mar 21 05:21:48 2015 UTC,Why?
ModelUSGov,2zs0bu,IBiteYou,3,Sat Mar 21 06:36:40 2015 UTC,I'd support such a measure.
ModelUSGov,2zs0bu,loopmoploop,3,Sat Mar 21 05:19:54 2015 UTC,This seems like a much better name for such a holiday.
ModelUSGov,2zs0bu,Canadianman22,1 point,Sat Mar 21 16:04:19 2015 UTC,I think it would be great to honor almost everyone who is living in the U.S. by having this holiday.
ModelUSGov,2zs0bu,ScottToiletPaper,1 point,Sat Mar 21 17:26:43 2015 UTC,"I support removing Columbus Day as a federally recognized holiday, but I would suggest two improvements to this bill:  1) Rename ""Colombus Day"" to ""Native American Day"" or something similar to honor the people who were exploited and killed by Colombus and other European settlers.  2) Keep the holiday on the same day.  I don't see why a change in date is necessary."
ModelUSGov,2zs0bu,IBiteYou,2,Sat Mar 21 21:40:36 2015 UTC,"Native American Heritage Month is November.    If it is going to be a holiday for all, I think it needs to be more inclusive and ""American Heritage Day"" would encompass that."
ModelUSGov,2zs0bu,CrossBowGuy237,0,Sun Mar 22 20:31:22 2015 UTC,"This sounds like a good idea but, I do like Columbus Day. Couldn't we have both?"

ModelUSGov,2zs0bu,CrossBowGuy237,2,Sat Mar 21 14:10:51 2015 UTC,I like getting the day off.
ModelUSGov,2zs0bu,rangerheart0,2,Sat Mar 21 14:22:55 2015 UTC,I mean we could but that doesn't really solve the problem this bill is aiming to solve.

ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,IBiteYou,8,Sat Mar 21 00:18:04 2015 UTC,"Comrades and people of DC,  Tonight, three people were sent to the hospital because a mad man did not like the idea of cooperation. This terrorist, this coward wounded three people for no other reason than that he does not like communists. This shooting is an assault on not only the spirit of democratic government, but on the soul of the working class movement. Why did this man shoot Sheppio when his apparent enemy was not a few more yards left?  There comes to a point, perhaps, where people feel like they have to resort to violence to make their voice heard. This is a tragedy not only for the three people shot, but for the man who feels so backed into a corner in whatever situation he's in that he has to hurt people. I hope that Sheppio and the two other innocent people that were hurt tonight recover fully and make it back to their families safely, and I hope that this desperate, poor man is found and receives the treatment he needs.  Gohte, Chairman of the Green-Left Party"
ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,Gohte,3,Sat Mar 21 00:12:10 2015 UTC,"Why did this man shoot Sheppio when his apparent enemy was not a few more yards left?   Perhaps because he was not motivated, at all, by hating commies?  These are the initial moments after something has occurred.  These are the most important moments to keep a level head in order to prevent fomenting any more misguided unrest.  DC is a gun-prohibited zone, so whomever is taking the law into their own hands is in very big trouble.  The best thing to do is to wait for details before trying to jump to conclusions.  Even IF this was a lone madman motivated by extremism... it does not give anyone else the right to become maddened to the point of extremism by it."
ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,IBiteYou,5,Sat Mar 21 00:24:13 2015 UTC,"On behalf of the administration, we first would like to wish the best to those affected by today's shooting and second, we issue a  strong condemnation towards the any ideological-based violence targeted towards any of our fellow countrymen.  No matter where we sit on the political spectrum, at the end of the day, we are all Americans.  We live in a nation where our right to express ourselves is protected by law. There is no need for any senseless violence, like the incident that happened tonight.  As far, as the assailant is concerned, tonight, I wish to assure the American people on the behalf of the administration, that we seek out this attacker out and bring him or her to justice.  Nobody deserves to live in fear of possible attack for self-expression."

ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,schultejt,7,Sat Mar 21 01:16:58 2015 UTC,"Members of this government, our democracy has been assaulted tonight. I believe wholeheartedly in the democratic process, and I heavily respect the executive branch; however, this inaction is not only unfortunate it is dangerous.   On those grounds I will be working with the capital police in my capacity as Speaker, and look forward to the President taking action once they are found.   The capital police will be securing the exits from Southwest D.C., and Helicopters will begin to fly over and secure sensitive areas in the Capital.   Furthermore, I urge all members of this great city to return to their homes or remain indoors during these trying times. Together we will overcome and will bring justice to those who have violated our most precious laws."

ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,loopmoploop,3,Sat Mar 21 00:32:52 2015 UTC,I highly suggest calling out the National Guard now that you have the authority to do so. This is a state of emergency and extra people tracking down the suspect could make a major difference.
ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,laffytaffyboy,3,Sat Mar 21 00:35:52 2015 UTC,"I cannot order the military into action; however, we will be mobilizing the Secret Service members that are made available to the Congress to not only enhance our search, but also to begin the search for possible explosive at sensitive locations."

ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,Didicet,6,Sat Mar 21 00:30:53 2015 UTC,"This is a radical situation, and the president isn't making any decisions that we know of. We need a leader, and /u/bsddc can be that leader!"
ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,bsddc,5,Sat Mar 21 00:32:07 2015 UTC,Actually the Vice President would be that leader.  I also question why the good representative is so quick to install a new President when it has been only an hour since we have heard from POTUS.

Once more, I wish nothing but the best to everyone affected by this occurrence, and hope that the American people can find strength and support with one another in the face of this disgusting violence.  Update: My office has received word that the other two civilians have died from their wounds. I am shocked and saddening by this news, and send my deepest condolences to their families. I extend the same condolences to the family of the innocent man mistaken for the suspect and shot dead."

ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,schultejt,3,Fri Mar 20 23:34:30 2015 UTC,The DHS' role so far is to contain public panic in and around government buildings. We are also investigating the authenticity of any internet traffic that claims to be related to or responsible for the shooting.
ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,bsddc,3,Sat Mar 21 00:51:35 2015 UTC,"Good evening my fellow Americans. I can report to you tonight that I am safe and sound, and that there was never any actual attempt on my life. Sadly though I cannot say the same for my friends at Washington Circle Park. My heart and sympathy goes out to Gohte and Sheppio, and am hoping for the best for his improving condition. I also extend my deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of the other victims of tonight's events.  Further, I ask everyone to remain calm and to return home. Again, remain calm, and return home. Over the coming days, we will investigate and learn more about the details of this terrorist act, and we will bring justice to those responsible. Their attempts to silence opposition will prove to be futile, just as it always has in the past. We cannot allow dissent to be threatened into silence, especially from radical extremists. No one, no matter their ideology, should be threatened or endangered simply for differing beliefs. We will hunt down the extremists, and they will pay for their assault on freedom.  Thank you, and God bless America."

ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,bsddc,3,Fri Mar 20 23:36:18 2015 UTC,Do we have any idea on the sweep of the perimeter at this time. Are the Secretary and Chairman secure? Have they been hit? The Department of the Interior will coordinate with the response in anyway possible.
ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,loopmoploop,3,Fri Mar 20 23:37:58 2015 UTC,"I urge the President to immediately lock down travel and airports in D.C., especially main arteries on the Beltway.   I am also very glad and relieved to hear the Chairman of the Green party is safe."
ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,risen2011,3,Fri Mar 20 23:42:54 2015 UTC,"I send my thoughts and prayers to Secretary Sheppio, and the two other civilians who have been shot.  I agree with the Speaker's earlier comment, exits out of the city need to be shut down for the time being. These assailants must be apprehended.  If this attack was over petty politics, as some sources are reporting, I fear for the state of this country, and I'd like to use this time to urge all Americans to remember that we are all people, no matter our political differences."
ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,HammerAndPotato,3,Fri Mar 20 23:48:57 2015 UTC,In light of recent updates I urge all civilians to refrain from vigilante justice and let the police handle all matters.  If you see someone who you believe is the shooter you should immediately contact the police and stay a safe distance away.
ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,Smitty9913,3,Sat Mar 21 00:18:21 2015 UTC,"As the shooter is still at large, I urge all citizens currently in DC to stay alert and get inside if at all possible. If you believe you spy the shooter, do not act unless absolutely necessary, and report your information to the police. While this is a frightening situation, we do not need to panic. An innocent person has already died, let's not increase that count.  While I do not know the situation regarding the President at the moment, it is my wish that an administration official would make a proper statement regarding the evening's events so far."
ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,Smitty9913,3,Sat Mar 21 00:28:52 2015 UTC,I hope that the DHS Secretary has already started co-ordinating with Washinton P.D. and the Coast Guard to make sure the shooter does not escape over the Potomac or Anacostia Rivers. Also the three bridges out of southwest washington should be shut down immediately.
ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,Gohte,3,Sat Mar 21 00:32:50 2015 UTC,I hope someone has coordinated with the state of Virginia in case the suspect makes it across the river.
ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,Smitty9913,3,Sat Mar 21 00:50:19 2015 UTC,The President will be addressing the nation within the next 30 minutes.

ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,Smitty9913,2,Sat Mar 21 01:25:50 2015 UTC,"I am anxious to hear his words on this situation, as I am sure many of my fellow Americans are."
ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,Gohte,3,Sat Mar 21 01:23:51 2015 UTC,"Message from the Department of Homeland Security:  Residents of the Washington DC metro area, perhaps one of the greatest dangers to us at this time is to lapse into a panic. My department's officers have been sweeping government buildings and large public gathering places for any evidence of a larger threat, and we can confidently say that there are no other threats within the city. The Department of Homeland Security urges you to stay in your homes or offices and watch the President's address in 20 or so minutes. Please remember to report any suspicious activity by calling 911."
ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,Smitty9913,2,Sat Mar 21 01:33:08 2015 UTC,"I hope this will be handled in a civilized way. I don't want anything else to happen, and I pray that those in that area are safe."
ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,Sheppio734,2,Fri Mar 20 23:39:33 2015 UTC,"There is no excuse, under any circumstances, for violence against our fellow Americans.  I hope that the government will coordinate with law enforcement to quickly apprehend the perpetrator of this violence.  Our thoughts go out to all of those that have been impacted this day and we hope that those injured will make a speedy recovery."
ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,Gohte,3,Sat Mar 21 00:08:33 2015 UTC,"I would like to echo the sentiments of my counterpart in the Senate.   In this nation we may not always agree on the issues, and we may fight over policy, but before all else civility, respect, and understanding must reign.   We all wish to advance this nation, and strengthen the American dream for all.   I believe that all of us here, regardless of whether we are from the Green-Left, Democrats, Libertarians, or Republicans, can agree that those who commit violence will face the full force of justice, and will know that their actions will not go unanswered.   My prayers are with all of those affected by this violence. May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America."
ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,Smitty9913,5,Sat Mar 21 00:13:05 2015 UTC,"Hear hear.  If there's one thing that every member of every party here in Washington can agree on, it's that violence against others because of their private beliefs is absolutely and unconditionally unacceptable.   Thankfully Secretary Sheppio seems alright, and I send my prayers to the other two civilians shot in this heinous attack. Let the American people come together and gains solidarity from this attack, and realize that no random violence can destroy our republic."
ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,Smitty9913,2,Sat Mar 21 00:17:02 2015 UTC,I am saddened that acts of violence such as this plague our country again again and again. I urge the police to do a through investigation into this indecent to ensure the safety and well-being of all involved. My condolences to the families of those killed.
ModelUSGov,2zr6rc,Smitty9913,2,Sat Mar 21 01:06:50 2015 UTC,"I am deeply, deeply alarmed by this act of blatant and meaningless violence against the government of the United States. This attack is not a matter just involving GreenLeft, but one involving America as a whole.  My heart goes out to those injured in the incident.  May such things be prevented in the future."

ModelUSGov,2zmwza,SeptimusSette,4,Thu Mar 19 22:31:05 2015 UTC,"Excellent bill. Americans have the right to know what they are eating so they can make informed decisions.   While food that is genetically modified is not automatically bad, a lot of Americans are concerned about the foods they eat, and this bill will help everyone make informed decisions with all the information at hand."
ModelUSGov,2zmwza,Canadianman22,7,Thu Mar 19 23:08:10 2015 UTC,"Going to have to sail across the pond to post this. I believe that not only is this measure completely unnecessary, it will result in irrevocable damage to the market for genetically modified organisms, which by and large are extremely beneficial.  The scientific consensus is pretty clear that there are zero health risks associated with consuming GMOs; the main reasons to oppose their use is because of predatory business practises (cough cough, monsanto), and a potential loss of biodiversity in the environment. A loss of biodiversity roughly translates into 'if everyone uses the same, genetically identical crop, and that particular gene makeup is susceptible to a particular plant disease, you're going to lose all of that crop'. This can be defeated by simply having more companies producing GM crops.  By labelling products as GM, you are pandering to the irrationality of the populace by labelling something completely arbitrary - by simply labelling it, you are suggesting to the consumer that there is a reason why it is labelled, and hence a reason not to buy it. Even people who were undecided before may think twice before purchasing GM products - and that will negatively impact any farmer who uses them, effectively destroying the higher crop yields which GM can offer, and putting an end to progress in this field."
ModelUSGov,2zmwza,Cocktorpedo,1 point,Fri Mar 20 14:44:19 2015 UTC,"I understand why you wouldn't want us to pander to the side of irrationality, however I believe that this bill will be beneficial for a completely different reason. I personally believe that the American people should know what they're eating (even if it's safe). I'd want to know if I was eating a genetically modified tomato. Personally, I think that letting the American people know what they were eating is more important than maintaining the market for GMOs."
ModelUSGov,2zmwza,risen2011,3,Fri Mar 20 15:29:47 2015 UTC,"Like I said, i think it's entirely arbitrary and unnecessary. If you're labelling whether it's GMO or not, why not mandate labelling what race the farmer was? Or his income? Or what kind of soil it was grown in? It's not really relevant to the consumer, but i'm sure there are some who would change their purchasing based on information like this. This is exactly what i'm saying - there's no reason to label GM crops, other than to confirm in peoples minds that there is something wrong about them, despite there being no evidence for this."
ModelUSGov,2zmwza,Cocktorpedo,1 point,Fri Mar 20 15:39:02 2015 UTC,"If you're labelling whether it's GMO or not, why not mandate labelling what race the farmer was? Or his income? Or what kind of soil it was grown in? It's not really relevant to the consumer,   What you listed may be irrelevant, but I'm sure a lot of people would like to know what exactly it is that they are putting into their body.   Also, on a side note, are you a capitalist?"
ModelUSGov,2zmwza,risen2011,2,Fri Mar 20 15:46:31 2015 UTC,"I just don't think it's a good idea to pander to irrationality, nor to encourage it.  I'm somewhere in between social democrat and socialist, allegedly."

It's weird to me that we are exempting medicine from this.  If you would want to know in the case of food, wouldn't you also want to know in the case of medicine?"
ModelUSGov,2zmwza,IBiteYou,3,Fri Mar 20 02:20:03 2015 UTC,I don't think selective breeding would qualify as genetic modification.  It's basically just breeding.

While I strongly support the use of genetic engineering to help grow our food supply, I also strongly believe the American consumer has a right to know exactly what it is that they are ingesting.  I hope my feelings on this proposal are shared by all members of Congress.  I urge all members to vote ""yes""."
ModelUSGov,2zmwza,loopmoploop,3,Fri Mar 20 01:04:35 2015 UTC,Why is this bill necessary?  How does it benefit the American people?
ModelUSGov,2zmwza,Smitty9913,3,Fri Mar 20 00:09:47 2015 UTC,"Congressman, this bill allows for Americans to know if and how their food has been genetically modified. While not all genetically modified food is necessarily bad, this nation's population has a right to know what they are eating, and this bill makes sure that they are informed. Knowledge is power, as they say, and the American people are benefited via the spread of this information. Please do correct me if I'm wrong, but I can't find anything harmful to a citizen in this legislation, so a better question might be: ""How does this bill not benefit the American people?"""
ModelUSGov,2zmwza,loopmoploop,3,Fri Mar 20 00:50:23 2015 UTC,Should we also know the race of the farmer? Or where it was grown? Or what kind of soil it is in?  This bill will cause unessasary amounts of paranoia.
ModelUSGov,2zmwza,Smitty9913,4,Fri Mar 20 17:06:09 2015 UTC,"The race of the farmer is not relevant to the nutritional value of the food, and we cannot accurately label the nutritional effects of where the food was grown and what kind of soil it was grown in for every single plant, it'd be a massive expenditure and effort to go around and catalogue the effects of every farm in the country. GMOs have a noticeable effect, and the American people deserve to know that no, this cantaloupe was not just unordinarily large, its size has been enhanced by a GMO.  If anyone, it would seem that you are the paranoid one, Senator."
ModelUSGov,2zmwza,loopmoploop,6,Fri Mar 20 17:35:56 2015 UTC,GMOs don't effect how nutritional something is anymore than what soil it was grown in does or where it was grown.

ModelUSGov,2zmwza,Smitty9913,1 point,Fri Mar 20 01:18:09 2015 UTC,I think it is indeed our right to know what we are consuming. This could even raise awareness to how badly the GM animals are being treated.

ModelUSGov,2zdwl3,SeptimusSette,1 point,Tue Mar 17 19:57:16 2015 UTC,Thank you for signing.
ModelUSGov,2zdvww,SeptimusSette,10,Tue Mar 17 19:42:46 2015 UTC,"While I understand the sentiment behind the bill, I must oppose it. Looking at our Congress, without the threat of real penalties for failing to compromise and negotiate, the odds that a budget bill will ever carry is slim, leaving us with the same budget year, after year. What this means is a minority of Senators can prevent the budget from ever changing.   That being said, I do support creating a clean process for the debt-ceiling. It should be a simple up or down vote without any other issues tacked onto the vote. I think together we can find a bi-partisan agreement here."
ModelUSGov,2zdvww,bsddc,3,Tue Mar 17 21:20:17 2015 UTC,"I don't like the idea that the treasury should be able to borrow money, plunging the US into even further debt, without approval of congress.  As inefficient as they have proved to be (in real life not in this simulation), congress should still be regarded as the supreme ruling authority of the land, not to be circumvented."
ModelUSGov,2zdvww,TheRealRailguy,3,Wed Mar 18 02:20:41 2015 UTC,Congress approves us going further into debt when they approve budgets with deficits that require that debt acquisition.
ModelUSGov,2zdvww,Didicet,2,Wed Mar 18 04:21:02 2015 UTC,Yes
ModelUSGov,2zdvww,Smitty9913,2,Wed Mar 18 17:12:27 2015 UTC,This is 100% the correct answer.
ModelUSGov,2zdvww,IBiteYou,1 point,Thu Mar 19 05:20:22 2015 UTC,The Treasury can only acquire debt to pay for the acts of Congress. This bill does not give any additional authority to the Treasury to create debt beyond that already approved by Congress. I dont see the problem.

ModelUSGov,2zdvww,IBiteYou,3,Thu Mar 19 09:23:41 2015 UTC,What? Are you kidding me? And I still don't know who is needed to be elected in the Senate.
ModelUSGov,2zdvww,Smitty9913,2,Wed Mar 18 13:45:17 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid this bill won't work as it is unconstitutional:  See Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution.  ""The Congress shall have Power To...pay the Debts...of the United States.""  Were Congress to pass this bill and give the Treasury power to acquire debt, they would be abdicating power given to them in the Constitution.    Additionally, see Article I, Section 9, Clause 7:  ""No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.""  By allowing appropriations to be made ""automatically"" as this bill would, Congress is again abdicating the REQUIREMENT that they appropriate the funds to be spent in governance of this nation.  Were this body to pass this bill, it would be struck down in the courts on at least one of these two grounds.  To pass this bill is a waste of taxpayer resources that could be spent working towards an actual solution to the current crisis, and not planning to address some unknown crisis in the future."
ModelUSGov,2zdvww,Logic_85,1 point,Sat Mar 21 16:40:43 2015 UTC,"The constitutional requirement is fulfilled by Congress passing bills that require money to implement. I think this is the problem we have in the real congress because people don't understand that. The Treasury isn't CREATING debt, they are simply paying for what congress already told them to pay for."
ModelUSGov,2zdvww,KaseyB,1 point,Sun Mar 22 16:37:41 2015 UTC,"The Treasury pays for what Congress appropriates.  When the Treasury does not have the money to pay for those appropriations, they borrow that money from foreign and domestic sources.  See the borrowing clause, also in Article I, found in Section 8, Clause 2.  Only Congress has the power to ""borrow money on the credit of the United States.""  The credit ceiling, set by Congress, fulfills this Constitutional requirement that Congress borrow the money.  To eliminate it entirely would be to give the Treasury power given to the Congress, and would be unconstitutional."
ModelUSGov,2zdvww,Logic_85,1 point,Mon Mar 23 04:12:31 2015 UTC,"I still don't see how removing the debt ceiling would suddenly give the Treasury the ability to borrow money just 'cuz. The treasury pays for what Congress appropriates. By that very definition, they are giving the treasury the authority and ability to borrow money in order to fulfill that demand BY CONGRESS. What do you suppose would happen when the Treasury says ""Hey all you lenders. We can't pay you because Congress says we can't give you the money we owe you for goods and services already rendered. Sorry."""
ModelUSGov,2zdvww,KaseyB,1 point,Mon Mar 23 04:38:58 2015 UTC,"It would allow the Treasury to borrow additional money (increase the credit limit, so to speak) without an act of Congress, in contradiction to the Constitution.  Deficit spending is a two-step process.  You have to vote to spend the money, and you have to vote to borrow the money you need.  Letting the Treasury take the reigns on either of those two steps goes against the Constitution."

ModelUSGov,2z708h,TheRealRailguy,3,Mon Mar 16 18:36:05 2015 UTC,And the DEM primary?
ModelUSGov,2z708h,IBiteYou,3,Mon Mar 16 18:53:10 2015 UTC,"Uh, we'll schedule primaries for late this month or early next month."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,risen2011,6,Mon Mar 16 19:01:28 2015 UTC,"That Head-Moderator clause seems a little extreme... they should at least have to put the changes to a community vote like the other moderators do.  We're a democracy, and I feel like giving too muvh power to the head-mod is dangerous."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,SeptimusSette,2,Mon Mar 16 18:07:06 2015 UTC,"A party or individual candidate may only advertise on subs with, at a maximum, 15,000 members.   I would like to ask for a modification to this rule.  I would like this to go up to 20,000.  The reason for this is simple.  The main subreddit for Republicans here has over 15,000 members.  The main subreddit for Democrats has under 15,000.  Reddit is very friendly to liberals, with many subreddits for them.  Some are small.  Some are large.    This rule effectively allows the Democrats to advertise on their main subreddit, but prevents the Republicans from advertising on their main subreddit.  I can understand not wanting GIANT subreddits to be advertised on, but if we really want to grow the Model Government, then we need to be allowed to advertise where there is a chance for effectiveness."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,risen2011,4,Mon Mar 16 20:33:45 2015 UTC,"20,000 is reasonable, as well.  I'll bump it up, barring any issues other mods have with it."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,risen2011,3,Mon Mar 16 20:36:49 2015 UTC,When does this go into effect?
ModelUSGov,2z708h,TheRealRailguy,3,Mon Mar 16 13:49:04 2015 UTC,I will be running a census soon to determine a new map.
ModelUSGov,2z708h,Gohte,3,Mon Mar 16 20:56:38 2015 UTC,"Minor parties shall be allowed to field one party-nominated candidate for the Presidency of the United States, but that candidate will not appear on the ballot. Instead, that candidate will be required to receive write-in votes.   This is an awful addition to the constitution. If you are trying to do this in the name of realism, it should be noted that this is not a realistic simulation. We don't obey parts of the constitution (i.e natural-born citizen requirements) and we don't receive any sort of donations (which would affect our voting record). Also, I find it horrendous that Independents get to have their name on the ballot while Greens do not. This is looking to me like a deliberate attempt to stifle the success of the the Green-Left party. I urge all members of this simulation to speak out against this constitution."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,risen2011,3,Mon Mar 16 03:28:24 2015 UTC,"In the interest of realism, we're attempting to dial down the political power that third parties possess, hence the bar on elected representatives and this?  Why?  Because the United States, in recent years, has had no prominent 3rd party candidate for President, but did, at the very least, have a prominent independent in Ross Perot in 1996.  As far as the natural born citizen thing is concerned, we also allow non-US citizen Brits to vote in our elections.  Why?  The ModelWorld community is relatively small and we do all we can to foster political competitiveness.  Furthermore, if one person commits all of their time to /r/ModelUSGov, why should we be entitled to tell them that they can't vote here, because they weren't born here?  And to enforce this ""home-bred"" rule, I personally think, would be a headache.  Donations-wise, it sounds like a cool idea, but do you have any clue how we could go about doing that?"
ModelUSGov,2z708h,Gohte,3,Mon Mar 16 03:37:21 2015 UTC,"but did have a prominent independent in Ross Perot in 1996   Ross Perot ran for the Reform party in 1996 and was not an independent. That discredits your whole first paragraph. I would also like to bring up the 1948 presidential election (less than 100 years old!) in which a third party candidate won three states. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1948 Also check out this one too: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1968   The ModelWorld community is relatively small and we do all we can to foster political competitiveness.   Then allow Green-Lefts the same rights as other parties, that will foster political competitiveness.    Furthermore, if one person commits all of their time to /r/ModelUSGov[1] , why should we be entitled to tell them that they can't vote here, because they weren't born here?   I agree with you, I'm just reminding you that we aren't mirroring the US government exactly here.    Donations-wise, it sounds like a cool idea, but do you have any clue how we could go about doing that?   The donations sentence was just to re-enforce my argument. I don't really have any ideas and I probably wouldn't like to see it come to this simulation."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,laffytaffyboy,2,Mon Mar 16 03:45:33 2015 UTC,"In regard to Perot, I should have mentioned that in his first, and most successful run for the Presidency, in 1992, he was listed as an independent in 44 states.  4 years later, he was on the ballot as ""Reform Party"", but fared significantly worse than he did in his first run.   ""Then allow Green-Lefts the same rights as other parties, that will foster political competitiveness.""   You were concerned about realism.  The two party dichotomy in the US is, unfortunately, very real.  To allow third parties to become more powerful than the two power houses in RL American politics, would be, in my opinion, a touch unrealistic.   ""I agree with you, I'm just reminding you that we aren't mirroring the US government exactly here.""   We can never mirror the US government exactly on this subreddit."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,laffytaffyboy,5,Mon Mar 16 03:53:40 2015 UTC,"Our job is not to model the US system completely, but to model the idea of a democratic republic and the federal government.  Considering a hefty amount of members are third parties, I think it would be stupid to exclude them in the interest of a ""two-party system"", which america was never suplosed to be anyways."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,laffytaffyboy,3,Mon Mar 16 18:10:13 2015 UTC,Something the Libertarians and Green-Left can unite on: Not getting screwed over by the establishment!

If anything I thought that you were going to bring it up in your arguments.    We can never mirror the US government exactly on this subreddit.   Then we shouldn't attempt to"
ModelUSGov,2z708h,SeptimusSette,3,Mon Mar 16 03:59:26 2015 UTC,I find it ridiculous that the two-party state is artificially maintained when one of the 'major' parties has less representation in Congress than one of the 'minor' parties.  I have to wonder if this would even be an issue if it were the Libertarians that were the strong third party.
ModelUSGov,2z708h,risen2011,3,Mon Mar 16 04:02:59 2015 UTC,"Major parties should be Republican and Green with the Minor parties being Libertarian and Democratic. It might not be realistic to real life, but it's realistic based on the model party sizes."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,jacoby531,4,Mon Mar 16 05:09:05 2015 UTC,"If we were being realistic, and attempting to mimic the real federal government as it is today, the Greens and Libertarians would have zero representation in Congress. Your people would need to run as Democrats in order to be elected."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,risen2011,3,Mon Mar 16 06:03:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the simulation is going to be inherently unrealistic, It's just something we have to deal with. Shouldn't we try to atleast keep the simulation consistent in it's differences? It's incredibly inconsistent to have one of the largest parties of the simulation be considered a minor party.   Also, I'm sure you didn't mean it in an offensive way, but ""Your people"" comes off as really condescending and bigoted."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,jacoby531,2,Mon Mar 16 06:41:09 2015 UTC,"There's no going back with the Green-Left and Libertarians, so I don't really see an issue with you guys being allowed full election rights. I was, and still am, against both parties existing in the subreddit, but if that isn't going to change then... eh, who cares?  Anyway, I didn't mean it in an offensive way. I'm sorry if that's how you interpreted it, but I don't believe 'Your people' when referring to a political group is bigoted or condescending."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,Gohte,1 point,Mon Mar 16 06:57:49 2015 UTC,"No problems. I know you didn't mean any offence. I say things that turn out to come off way more offencive to other people all the time.

ModelUSGov,2z708h,jacoby531,1 point,Mon Mar 16 11:48:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the democrats are barely active, and aren't even close to the irl democrats in ideology."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,Gohte,2,Mon Mar 16 20:53:47 2015 UTC,"Of course, but your party members could've joined the Democrats and molded them into what you are now. There's really no point in having four separate parties, especially since most of the prominent Democrats defected to the GL."

ModelUSGov,2z708h,schultejt,2,Mon Mar 16 21:31:15 2015 UTC,I echo the sentiments of my Chairman.
ModelUSGov,2z708h,risen2011,2,Mon Mar 16 04:06:21 2015 UTC,"I guess I'll seize this opportunity to share an idea about donations and campaigning. Instead of limiting how many seats they can run in, make it so that third-parties can only advertise to a certain amount of people. Here's an example: (the numbers are just for the sake of example)  The Democrats, a major party, can advertise to 20,000 people, so they post on subs with 15,000 and 5,000 subscribers. The Green-Left, a minor party, can only advertise to 10,000, so while they may want to post to the 15,000 subscriber subreddit, they can't, and have to advertise on a smaller sub.  I feel like this would be a fairer way to make it more realistic, while not artificially holding back the minor parties.  Disclaimer: This is a compromise suggestion. I personally believe that all parties should be equal, but recognize that many others would rather have a more realistic simulation than have party equality."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,Smitty9913,2,Mon Mar 16 20:19:42 2015 UTC,"Behold! The Democratic Whip trying to eliminate his greatest threat not by means of election, but by artificial means! If you adhere to true democratic virtues, you should advocate fair elections not artificial restrictions."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,Gohte,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:25:05 2015 UTC,"This was just a compromise proposal. I agree with you that the parties should be equal, but I acknowledge that many people want party power to be somewhat realistic over equality between the parties."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,Smitty9913,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:36:49 2015 UTC,"This is still an artificial handicap. I'd be more satisfied if you all were honest with yourselves and just said you wanted us banned. If you put it to a vote it would probably pass, that way you guys would get your far right and right of center simulation that it seems is desired here."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,Gohte,3,Mon Mar 16 21:00:23 2015 UTC,"I was just suggesting a compromise between those who want equity for the parties and those who want realism. I am part if the first camp, but I know that there are a lot of people in the second."

ModelUSGov,2z708h,Smitty9913,2,Mon Mar 16 16:52:20 2015 UTC,It doesn't say that Independents get their name on the ballot.
ModelUSGov,2z708h,schultejt,2,Mon Mar 16 03:34:55 2015 UTC,It doesn't say that the major parties get their name on the ballot. And it doesn't say independents don't get their name on the ballot ether so we must assume they do.

ModelUSGov,2z708h,bsddc,2,Mon Mar 16 16:05:07 2015 UTC,"Congressional Elections will take place every 2 months, and Presidential every 4 months.    My understanding was that I had my Senate seat for 4 months.  You have changed that now?  I'm just going to say that folks are going to get very election-weary.  What will happen is that people who have jobs or ""lives"" are going to be less inclined to participate than people who don't have jobs and have more free time to dedicate to this.  I would change the filibuster rules to one post every five minutes so that people have the time to, for instance, relieve their bowels or kidneys if they need to between posts.  Not everyone is chiming in from a phone or portable computer."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,DidNotKnowThatLolz,3,Mon Mar 16 18:14:16 2015 UTC,"I mirrored the ""2, 4, 6 election cycles"" from real life.  I used poor wording there (referring to House only), but I did mention before that Senators are elected to 6 year terms.   ""A Senator is every 6 months, except for the first batch of junior Senators (February 2015 election), who will be subject to re-election two months from their previous election, only for that election.""   In response to your filibuster, that's reasonable and I'll look to edit that."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,DidNotKnowThatLolz,2,Mon Mar 16 18:33:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you for changing the filibuster rule.  Also, there are questions regarding voting.  In the past, there has been no rule that prevented someone from changing a vote in the Congress or Senate before the final tally.  If that is going to be a rule, I would suggest putting it in the new Constitution."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,DidNotKnowThatLolz,3,Mon Mar 16 19:02:42 2015 UTC,"""So I do have to run again in a month?""   No, we would just be setting you back another two months while having Durian up for election this upcoming election.  As far as changing votes is concerned, members of Congress, in real-life, are allowed to change votes within the last 5 minutes of voting.    However, if there was to a be rules change in regard to whether or not members can change votes, and how long they have to do so, I think that would have to be put forward to each House as a motion to amend house rules."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,Gohte,2,Mon Mar 16 19:07:08 2015 UTC,"The issue is that the bill to expel Crossbowguy should have passed.  Durian abstained.  Then, it was claimed that he was not allowed to change his vote, which he did better than a day before the deadline, IIRC."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,Gohte,2,Mon Mar 16 19:55:53 2015 UTC,"Ah, well, if proper procedure was being followed, it should have been common knowledge that he was allowed to change his vote.  Other moderators may have other rules, but those haven't been made clear, and if they aren't made clear, we should go by regular order, which again, would have allowed him to change his vote."
ModelUSGov,2z708h,Gohte,2,Mon Mar 16 19:57:26 2015 UTC,Also ... we need word on the official expulsion of Crossbowguy from the Senate so that the we can get moving on a replacement.

ModelUSGov,2z2m0g,IBiteYou,2,Sun Mar 15 00:55:52 2015 UTC,"It is a delight to see this commitment remade so publicly--for the past decade, Social Security has served as the punching bag of the far right. Their budget argument, founded as it is on half-truths, had begun to gain traction, but our dedication to those who need this assistance cannot waver. It is the bedrock of our safety net, and a true milestone of American progress."
ModelUSGov,2z2u40,Didicet,4,Sun Mar 15 01:17:37 2015 UTC,"I would like to thank our President /u/Didicet for nominating me to be the Vice President. While I may be a more recent addition to this government, I will give this position the respect and dedication it deserves. I plan on having a very high attendance record, and upholding the office that is being entrusted to me. You will have no regrets giving me the vote of confidence our President has already given me.   Thank you, and may God bless America."
ModelUSGov,2z2u40,Canadianman22,3,Sun Mar 15 01:44:59 2015 UTC,"What is your position in the government now? No offense, but I have no clue what it is.  The President cites your participation in /r/ModelDemocrats as evidence of your ability and willingness to assume the office, but I can't come up with a single thread going back as far as 5 months that you've introduced or participated in. I realize that ModelDemocrat communication takes place mostly off reddit and has for a while, but still ... /r/ModelWhiteHouse is private, so no vetting gonna happen there, either.  Please let us rank-and-file party members know who you are. We're honor-bound not to dig through post histories, so unless you're forthcoming about who you are and how you vote, we're really at a loss here to support our own party's choice for 2nd in command."

Even though we disagree on many things, I believe he is a great choice, and I know he will be dedicated to his duties.  On the other hand, I cannot vote yea on the Vice President nomination. He is simply not active enough to warrant my support."
ModelUSGov,2z2u40,SeptimusSette,2,Sun Mar 15 01:21:26 2015 UTC,"I wasn't particularly active myself when I was picked for the VP position.

From what I've seen in /r/ModelWhiteHouse, /r/ModelDemocrats, and in private communications, /u/Canadianman22 is plenty dedicated."
ModelUSGov,2z2u40,Canadianman22,2,Sun Mar 15 01:29:48 2015 UTC,"I may be a recent addition, but I am here to allay your fears about my being active in this sub. I would not accept this nomination if I feel I could not dedicate the time that this office deserves."
ModelUSGov,2z2u40,Gohte,2,Sun Mar 15 01:47:00 2015 UTC,It's just strange that someone relatively unknown with very little subreddit activity would receive the nomination. I don't think it would be possible for Congress to judge you in good faith to confirm you for this office.    iswearI'mnotasoreloser
ModelUSGov,2z2u40,Canadianman22,3,Sun Mar 15 01:49:46 2015 UTC,"I understand your reason, and I can see why you feel that way. However, I would submit my past record in a position of authority within a model government as proof that I will be fully committed to this position.  I was the Speaker within the CMHOC, with the second highest attendance record and massive responsibilities and I met the challenges presented to me."

ModelUSGov,2z2u40,Canadianman22,3,Sun Mar 15 04:05:28 2015 UTC,"He's the former speaker of the Canadian MHOC and is a member of my cabinet, I'd hardly say that's random"
ModelUSGov,2z2u40,Canadianman22,2,Sun Mar 15 04:06:58 2015 UTC,Then how about he stays at MHOC? Because he is not an American and is trying to be the vice president. And what your cabinet of 5 days? No One has ever heard of him I would call that very random

And I believe that through my God I understand the nature of the world around me.   But I also believe that faith should be a free choice, forced on no one. Religious freedom is a core pillar of a free society. If someone chooses to follow a non-monotheistic religion or chooses to not practice a religion at all, they have the freedom to do so.   And this great nation, governed by the principle of equality before the law, should give no power to religious beliefs, but instead should promote a diverse, rich, and beautifully intricate web of culture and belief. No pledge or moto of this country should mention a God, because religion is a personal freedom that must be separate from a secular government.   E Pluribus Unum, from many, one. There is no better way to describe our society and ambition. We come from every walk of life to form a great nation. I will be voting for this bill.   Atheist, Buddhist, Jewish, Christian, Hindu, and every belief under the Sun are welcomed in these great United States. From many states and regions we come together. From many, we become one."

ModelUSGov,2z1met,risen2011,2,Sat Mar 14 19:01:41 2015 UTC,"By that logic, this will alienate those who wish our Government to be built on religious values."
ModelUSGov,2z1met,Smitty9913,11,Sat Mar 14 19:38:08 2015 UTC,"Where did you get that assumption? By not endorsing any religion at all, the government will not be alienating anyone.

The poll also states that, ""These results are based on telephone interviews with a randomly selected sample of 1,003 adults, aged 18 and older, conducted Sept. 19-21, 2003."" Caller ID was becoming more popular towards 2003 and younger people who had it probably wouldn't have bothered to answer the phone.

ModelUSGov,2z1met,AllTheyEatIsLettuce,3,Sun Mar 15 01:20:18 2015 UTC,Actually that is an interesting statement.  God may well be the foundation of our government.  The founders stated in our Declaration of Independence that our inalienable rights come from our Creator.  *fix word.
ModelUSGov,2z1met,IBiteYou,2,Sun Mar 15 07:44:17 2015 UTC,Interesting observation: not a single SCOTUS case in the history of the Court has been specifically decided on the Declaration of Independence or its provisions. No decision has turned or can turn on the Declaration of Independence. It's not a binding document for governance. It merely lays out the authors' justifications for revolution and in no way restricts or defines the creation of a government that succeeded it 12 years later.
ModelUSGov,2z1met,keypuncher,3,Sun Mar 15 15:19:31 2015 UTC,"It, however, blasts the idea that the founders were not believers in a Creator.  Also, separation of church and state doesn't appear in the Constitution."

Specifically no - but they do repeatedly turn on it by implication.  Neither our Constitution nor its Amendments grant rights to US citizens.  Where rights are concerned, all they do is prohibit the government from removing or infringing on those rights.  So where then do the rights we have come from?  Not from the state - but from our creator - as the same men who wrote the Declaration of Independence knew."

As long as this space is ""yours"" the fourth amendment can be worded slightly differently and still apply. So while it's somewhat at odds in it's current form, it can, and almost undoubtedly would, were we to develop a Socialist system, be altered to maintain the same effect.   I actually withdraw the statement that ""Communism holds no incompatibilities with the constitution."" Socialism holds no incompatibilities with the constitution, however, Communism calls for the abolishment of the state, and therefore is quite at odds with  large parts of the constitution. Individual's rights are nearly entirely, if not entirely safe though."
ModelUSGov,2z1met,keypuncher,2,Sun Mar 15 06:54:03 2015 UTC,"Socialism isn't compatible with the Constitution either.  Nowhere in the Constitution is Congress granted the power to do any of the things that Socialism requires of the Federal Government, and all powers not granted to the Federal Government are reserved to the States and to the people."
ModelUSGov,2z1met,Gohte,3,Sun Mar 15 07:30:13 2015 UTC,There's nothing prohibiting it at a state level.

ModelUSGov,2z1met,Gohte,7,Sat Mar 14 21:03:55 2015 UTC,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_God_we_trust   ""In God we trust"" first appeared on U.S. coins in 1864[4] and has appeared on paper currency since 1957. A law passed by the 84th Congress (P.L. 84-140) and approved by the President on July 30, 1956, the President approved a Joint Resolution of the 84th Congress, declaring IN GOD TRUST the national motto of the United States. IN GOD WE TRUST was first used on paper money in 1957, when it appeared on the one-dollar silver certificate. The first paper currency bearing the motto entered circulation on October 1, 1957 [5]  In 1956, the nation was at a particularly tense time in the Cold War, and the United States wanted to distinguish itself from the Soviet Union, which promoted state atheism.[17] As a result, the 84th Congress passed a joint resolution ""declaring IN GOD WE TRUST the national motto of the United States."" The law was signed by President Eisenhower on July 30, 1956, and the motto was progressively added to paper money over a period from 1957 to 1966.[14] (Public Law 84-851)[18] The United States Code at 36 U.S.C. § 302, now states: ""'In God we trust' is the national motto."""

ModelUSGov,2z1met,Smitty9913,6,Sat Mar 14 21:22:06 2015 UTC,"And this bill doesn't say anything in regard to these phrases appearing on currency, so everything that this bill addresses did start in the Cold War."
ModelUSGov,2z1met,Gohte,1 point,Sat Mar 14 21:24:35 2015 UTC,Then why would you post the part about money? They were just Countinuing the path they started in 1864
ModelUSGov,2z1met,Smitty9913,1 point,Sun Mar 15 14:26:12 2015 UTC,"I also read that part, I've read the entire wiki page. I was just trying to show that the motto was first used in the 1800's."

ModelUSGov,2z1met,Smitty9913,3,Sun Mar 15 14:29:42 2015 UTC,I support the majority of my voters and the country.
ModelUSGov,2z1met,Danotto94,2,Sat Mar 14 21:10:21 2015 UTC,What if the minority of voters are upset but can't/don't want to move out of the country for whatever reason? What does supporting the country have to do with religious values?

ModelUSGov,2z1met,Smitty9913,0,Sat Mar 14 21:41:36 2015 UTC,What does supporting the country have to do with religious values?   I was trying to say that I support the majority of my country's populace.
ModelUSGov,2z1met,Danotto94,2,Sat Mar 14 21:42:12 2015 UTC,What about the minority?
ModelUSGov,2z1met,Smitty9913,0,Sat Mar 14 21:32:50 2015 UTC,I support the Majority in this case.

It is not preventing anyone from practising their faith or what they believe in, it is helping to keep church separate from state by removing a reference to a spiritual being that is attached to many religions."
ModelUSGov,2z1met,schultejt,2,Sat Mar 14 22:33:37 2015 UTC,I support this bill
ModelUSGov,2z1met,Canadianman22,2,Sun Mar 15 22:30:23 2015 UTC,"I am in complete agreement with this. As many of my fellow representatives have mentioned, we must remember that faith is entirely voluntary. Regardless of one's personal values, we cannot attempt to enforce a religious outlook on the nation.  It can be seen from many of the statements so far that this bill is supported, and I am happy that a legislature divided between left and right can come to a consensus on something as monumental as what this bill is proposing."
ModelUSGov,2z1met,bsddc,2,Sat Mar 14 23:38:32 2015 UTC,"People will always believe in something they can't prove.  Its been that way since the beginning of mankind and will stay that way forever.  I would argue that everyone has a God.  Whether your God is the Christian Trinity, the Muslim Allah, the Greek Zeus, your ancestors, or even something like ""Nature"" or ""Science"".  Everyone has something they believe holds their life/world/universe in order and gives purpose to their life.  Whatever you call ""it"" its still your ""God"".  If your God is Science you still trust it.  Without that trust your universe doesn't mean anything, so I think that having ""In God We Trust"" as a motto is really not that bad a thing."
ModelUSGov,2z1met,Smitty9913,1 point,Sun Mar 15 05:02:16 2015 UTC,"You bring up a very interesting point. The problem is a lot of people equate God to the Catholic version of a higher being, which I can see a lot of people objecting to. That being said, I have always felt this way about the term, and you have put it into words excellently. If everyone saw the higher power they believe in as God, then this would be a non-issue. However, due to its connection to a particular religion, it should be removed."
ModelUSGov,2z1met,risen2011,2,Sun Mar 15 08:13:07 2015 UTC,"As always, you can track the votes in the House here."

More importantly, the courts have said again and again that this is okay. It is foolish to think that you have more power than the courts. Zorach v. Clauson, and  Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow and Aronow v. United States. Also how would meny be printed?"
ModelUSGov,2z1met,risen2011,11,Mon Mar 16 03:46:18 2015 UTC,"Smitty, this post proves that you have a limited understanding of how the United States government works. The court held (incorrectly, in my view) that placing the phrase ""In God we trust"" was admissible under the constitution. These rulings place no legal restrictions on congress removing that phrase from money or replacing it with ""E Pluribus Unum"" for our nation's motto."

ModelUSGov,2z1met,Danotto94,8,Sat Mar 14 21:24:01 2015 UTC,The point of the bill is to become neutral about the matter. It's not to promote atheism.

ModelUSGov,2yudge,IBiteYou,1 point,Fri Mar 13 04:13:54 2015 UTC,"This bill in itself? Nothing, but the idea is that cutting taxes for corporations if they stay is an incentive for them to stay here rather than move to the peripheries of capitalism where higher taxes have not been set. However, taxes are not the only reason why corporations are moving elsewhere. Environmental and workplace regulations are also a factor, and if the state wishes to be consistent and successful in keeping corporations in the United States it will eventually have to start removing those as well."
ModelUSGov,2yudge,Llanganati,3,Fri Mar 13 04:20:50 2015 UTC,So you favor removing burdensome regulations in order to keep business here?  Fantastic!

A factory built with capital, filled with machines purchased with capital, supplied and powered by raw materials and utilities purchased with capital, and staffed by workers hired with capital, can turn one out in a few hours.

ModelUSGov,2yudge,IBiteYou,6,Sat Mar 14 22:25:27 2015 UTC,"i have huge problems with the way this bill is written. Most of them come from passages like   Let American corporations be subject to taxes equaling twice the wages paid to alien employees residing outside these United States.   So what does that mean? Two bucks? Two percent? The bill is VERY unclear.  Also, I don't like section 2. It protects the super-rich CEOs instead of hardworking Americans. Why should corporation tax rates be reduced at a time when many Americans are still suffering from a recession? I urge my colleges to vote no on this bill."

It actually protects the worker.     Why should corporation tax rates be reduced at a time when many Americans are still suffering from a recession?    Why should they not?  Corporations are paying HIGH taxes ... taxes that your ordinary low-income citizen doesn't pay at all.  The reason for lowering the rates is because we are bleeding industry to other nations with lower tax rates.  This bill also IMPOSES taxes for business that outsources jobs.
ModelUSGov,2yudge,IBiteYou,3,Fri Mar 13 00:10:17 2015 UTC,"The reason for lowering the rates is because we are bleeding industry to other nations with lower tax rates.   As the bill is written, how will you ensure corporations will not outsource jobs even if they get a tax cut? The corporations will hide behind loopholes in our tax code anyway.    This bill also IMPOSES taxes for business that outsources jobs.   AND it imposes taxes for hiring immigrant workers that come to this country.  This will give corporations an incentive to pay all immigrant workers a significantly lower wage so it does not have to pay that much in taxes.   The point is: you may be giving corporations an incentive to come back, however I think that they might use the incentive to further exploit workers."
ModelUSGov,2yudge,risen2011,1 point,Fri Mar 13 01:29:18 2015 UTC,"Let's take a moment to understand something.  The Republicans have the majority right now.  We could severely lower the corporate tax rate with a simple bill doing just that.   As the bill is written, how will you ensure corporations will not outsource jobs even if they get a tax cut?    The bill is two-pronged.  It lowers the tax rate (though not enough in my opinion) and it TAXES employers for outsourcing jobs.  If they hire employees and do not report that to the IRS, there would be penalties.   The corporations will hide behind loopholes in our tax code anyway.    Even with loopholes, we have the highest corporate tax rates in the world.  I know that it is a common sentiment among some that corporations do not pay taxes, but it is not true.  The much maligned WalMart, for instance, pays about 30% in corporate taxes the last time I checked.  What if someone took 30% of YOUR income?  What if you lived in a state that, when you worked, took 30% of your income?  You would likely move to another state that took less.  This is what is happening with American businesses.    As I have said before... Finland's tax rate is 20%.  The UK will lower its tax rate to 20% next month.   AND it imposes taxes for hiring immigrant workers that come to this country.    Yes.  If an employee is SO GOOD that you need to have them get a green card and come here to work, you can pay a dollar for dollar tax on them.  If you don't want to pay this tax... try to hire a US worker.   This will give corporations an incentive to pay all immigrant workers a significantly lower wage so it does not have to pay that much in taxes.    I'm not sure how you come to this conclusion.  So ... let's go back to my initial statement here.  You can holler about exploiting workers as much as you want ... but the REAL exploited worker is the one that is employed by an American company in sweat shop conditions making 5 bucks a day.  THAT is exploiting workers.  It is not realistic to, in this simulation, hate on the corporations and demand things for the workers.  We are not in a socialist society.  We do not have a communist government.  What this bill concerns itself with is realistically making the nation friendlier to the employers on a world-wide level AND incentivizing the hiring of American citizens for jobs that might otherwise be outsourced."

It is not realistic to, in this simulation, hate on the corporations and demand things for the workers. We are not in a socialist society. We do not have a communist government.   Right, we are not in a socialist society yet. However, I would say its very realistic to hate on corporations who exploit workers on a daily basis. Ever heard of a strike?   Yes.

No.  It says, ""If you need that worker so badly... you will pay extra for that worker.""   Also, foreign workers don't affect the employment rate positively or negitively...

ModelUSGov,2yudge,IBiteYou,1 point,Thu Mar 12 23:29:25 2015 UTC,I understand your concerns.  What would you like to see amended?
ModelUSGov,2yudge,Smitty9913,1 point,Thu Mar 12 23:26:17 2015 UTC,"The entire writing of the bill needs to be improved. It needs to make sense when you read it. This bill is just very confusing and hard to understand. Also the part about wage needs to be completely fixed. I have no clue what it is even talking about. If it's trying to say that company's need to pay oversees workers US wage, there is no way we could even think of enforcing that. Also, this entire idea for a bill is not aceptable because it would kill the U.S. economy. Every big business would leave the U.S. so they didn't have to pay those taxes.   Also I was just letting other people know what I will be doing because I don't expect them to look what else I have said on the page."
ModelUSGov,2yudge,IBiteYou,1 point,Fri Mar 13 01:21:18 2015 UTC,"Why not.  What specifically prevents us from saying, ""As a US corporation, you will not pay your workers under minimum wage, no matter where they are?""   Every big business would leave the U.S. so they didn't have to pay those taxes.    We are also wanting to reduce the corporate tax rate here in order to encourage companies to do business here.  They are bleeding out anyway as it is."

ModelUSGov,2yudge,laffytaffyboy,1 point,Fri Mar 13 04:16:02 2015 UTC,"How does the government gain more power of the economy from this?  Reducing corporate tax rates would empower the corporations to remain here or even think about growing.  If the corporation remains here, more Americans are employed.  This absolutely helps employees.  Then as more are employed... they can afford to buy things in the economy.  This will bolster the economic climate... as their money is coming from their pay and not from a government program because they got laid off because their firm outsourced their job to someplace else."
ModelUSGov,2yudge,Prodigiousguy8,2,Fri Mar 13 04:21:51 2015 UTC,"I would like language in the bill to say that it only creates rules for going forwards, and is not retroactive.  That is to say that companies that already have industry overseas or non-American employees here would not be subject to it, because that is not truly fair.  Personally, I would also like to see corporate taxes reduced further if we are going to tax non-American employees."

I dont see how this is unrealistic or would cause a disaster, you act as if there has been zero thought put into this, which is quite far from true.  There is a reason it wasnt put into effect, but was it a good reason? There was a reason that the ""equal rights"" amendment and the ""right to vote"" amendment were not put into effect, but I would say it was far from a good reason   First, who would be the #1 in charge?   None of them, they would all share equal power.   What if they got assassinated?   Standard procedure for replacing a president.   Who would forgine leaders greet and such?    All 3 of them, they are all equal in rights and duties.   This would just make the Govermnet even more disfuncanal.   I completely disagree. This would make the government more functional and reduce the overly large power of he president.   How would the people be voted on?   Either a standard election, staggered, for one at a time, or a Single transferable vote with the top three being selected.   Would there be a limit on how many partys can run for it?   Why? There's no limit now and it shouldn't cause a problem. Especially if the first option for the last question is chosen.   Could they hold VETO power?   If at least two of the three vote to veto, then it gets vetoed. If they vote to sign, it gets signed.   And anyways there is only 2 real partys nkt three.   There's also not 53 parties, does that mean that California and all other states should only have two representatives?   I know this would never pass legislatively and I doubt the Mods would allow it eather.   Look at any amendment 50 years before it was passed and people would have said the same thing. It's far from the forgone conclusion you make it out to be.   If you're talking specifically this sub's legislation, then I'm even more convinced there's a chance.

The Green-Left party maintained its integrity during the elections when nobody defected from a major party or ran as an independent with intent to change parties to get around election restrictions (however unjust they may be). However, it is evident that /u/CrossBowGuy237 and the Libertarian party as a whole did not maintain that integrity. I urge all senators to examine the evidence and vote accordingly."

We did not encourage Crossbowguy to join, nor were we involved in any miscommunication that may have happened between him and the Model Republican party.  As an inclusive group of people, despite his contorversy, we naturually chose not to expel him.

Those voters were slapped in the face when CrossBowGuy defected and were spit on by you when you allowed him entry into the Libertarian Party.

And yes, i have denied members from joining my party before after vetting, so dont frame me for these violations that did not happen"
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,Libertarian-Party,0,Fri Mar 13 18:36:30 2015 UTC,Did you read the bill?  He admits that he had been talking to the Chair of the Libertarians before he defected.

ModelUSGov,2ym6am,Libertarian-Party,4,Fri Mar 13 04:36:07 2015 UTC,"I would like you to explain where you find that the Libertarian Party has not maintained its integrity.    See the evidence in the bill.  Crossbowguy admitted that he had been conversing with the Chairman of your party before he defected.  Your Chairman should have said, ""We will welcome you into the party, but you should resign the seat that you just won by running as a hardcore Republican.""  Instead, he joined you AND Crossbowguy and your Chairperson immediately began advertising for members of your party bragging that they had one Senate seat and one Congress seat.  http://www.reddit.com/r/TeaParty/comments/2y2gg8/us_government_simulation/"
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,IBiteYou,4,Wed Mar 11 07:00:28 2015 UTC,Why do you choose to say I am insulting you? Because you feel offended that I charged your party with not maintaining its integrity? That's no way to engage in civil political discourse.
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,risen2011,6,Wed Mar 11 12:51:39 2015 UTC,I urge all congressmen to vote aye for the sake of common decency and in the interest of maintaining a faithful simulation.

ModelUSGov,2ym6am,risen2011,4,Tue Mar 10 23:15:39 2015 UTC,It was inevitable when the mods of the simulation chose to not deal with it.

ModelUSGov,2ym6am,IBiteYou,3,Wed Mar 11 07:02:14 2015 UTC,"He said that he thought ""In God We Trust"" should not be on the money.    You seem to not understand what sacrilege means. I think that it shouldn't be there for that reason. I am very religious and am open about my beliefs but you're making it seem like I am an atheist.

ModelUSGov,2ym6am,CrossBowGuy237,6,Tue Mar 10 23:35:53 2015 UTC,I don't want it to be there because we don't have a State religion.    But you want mandatory Christian prayer in all public schools....
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,IBiteYou,2,Wed Mar 11 00:24:41 2015 UTC,"You don't understand, it won't be mandatory, there will just be a massive amount of peer pressure on Jews, Atheists, Muslims, and all other nonChristians."

ModelUSGov,2ym6am,IBiteYou,3,Thu Mar 12 01:03:02 2015 UTC,"You did not simply change your view about ""In God We Trust"" being on the money.

Within DAYS you were saying that ""separation of church and state"" was ""a good thing.""  I can imagine you might be feeling tense.  Why do you think that is?  *fix word"
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,CrossBowGuy237,4,Thu Mar 12 01:19:48 2015 UTC,"What it would do is allow us to vote to replace Crossbowguy.  A member of our party won that seat in the last election.  If people resign, our process is not to just name a replacement ... it is to hold an election within our subreddit.  If this is clear cheating ... this ought to be clear cheating.  I really would like to ask you to change your vote.  As it is it's like you are agreeing that crossbowguy should go, but there's a vendetta against the Republicans ... so you won't vote for the bill."
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,IBiteYou,2,Wed Mar 11 17:53:23 2015 UTC,"With all evidence here, you are avoiding that I had no idea what was going on within the party, someone would have had to tell me that Ollie was resigning. Also, I joined this sub reddit the day of the big election and voted Republican. I believe I saw your post on /r/Republican advertising the election which is when I joined. This is all referring to /u/IBiteYou."
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,CrossBowGuy237,6,Thu Mar 12 00:07:14 2015 UTC,"No.  What you had to do was join ModelRepublicans and bide your time until you could run for election.  You knew that we were winning seats.  As SOON as you got the opportunity to run, you did so.  You knew what you were doing.  You were also talking to the Chair of the Libertarian party while you were a member of the Republicans.  You were not a Republican when Bruce Rauner won his election.  That was November fourth."
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,IBiteYou,1 point,Tue Mar 10 23:44:17 2015 UTC,"You seem to know everything, tell me this, why would I leave the party as a traitor? I would know that you would be angry, so public about your anger that re-election is certain for you. I joined with respect, I left the with respect. I lost that respect about an hour later because I was called a liar. You can deny it all you want, but I have not lied once to anyone on this Reddit. How are you ensured to have my seat after I am voted out? The seat belongs to me, not your party. It should go to someone in my party after this is over."
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,CrossBowGuy237,2,Wed Mar 11 00:28:11 2015 UTC,"Do you think this comment helps you?  You looked over the rules and you thought (in my opinion) Technically, there's nothing they can do about me leaving for  *my party** and taking my seat with me.""  You lied when you said you didn't intend to win the election.  You ran for election ... you posted a platform.   Did you forget sending me this pm?  http://i.imgur.com/I7fR312.jpg  You certainly are very interested in having your party keep the Senate seat."
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,IBiteYou,1 point,Wed Mar 11 21:31:46 2015 UTC,I ran for election because I messaged Keypuncher asking what was going on within the party at the time. He said the there was an election and some debates. I did all of those things so you guys could get to know me. I sent that message because I didn't want to be banned from this Reddit. I was willing to step down if keeping my position resulted in a ban. I don't understand why you try to use every message I sent you EVER against me.
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,laffytaffyboy,3,Thu Mar 12 00:16:00 2015 UTC,"Keep talking.  Really.  What was going on within the party was evident on the subreddit.  There are literally posts there about everything going on.   I did all of those things so you guys could get to know me.    You are still going to carry on with the charade that you only ran AGAINST TWO OTHER people for election because you wanted us ""to get to know you""?  Well... we sure did, didn't we?  Your assertion that you unintentionally won an election is simply not credible.  Not credible.   I sent that message because I didn't want to be banned from this Reddit.   Oh, were you worried that you did something not technically wrong... but against the rules of the subreddit?   I don't understand why you try to use every message I sent you EVER against me.   I didn't.  I have not used the one that doxxes you.  I have not done so out of a sense of decency.  But I AM going to share the information that shows what you did, so that others can come to a conclusion."
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,IBiteYou,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:55:35 2015 UTC,"No title was included, so that's why the title is that way. It was the subject of the modmail submission.  Removes mod hat in way to make sure everyone is aware.*  I firmly believe this bill is an attack on solid bill writing.  This bill employs the following tactics:   All caps phrases.  No clear lawful structure. Doomsday prophecy. And finally, arguing for the bill in the bill. This is what the discussion is for.   I encourage members of the senate vote 'nay' to this bill, not because of the situation which it attempts to deal with, but because of its shocking low quality."
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,laffytaffyboy,7,Thu Mar 12 01:06:29 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree. /u/Crossbowguy237 has clearly intentionally deceived voters and should be thrown out of office. However, I urge all members of the senate to vote 'nay' and request that /u/Ibiteyou resubmit a more proper and formal bill so that this matter can be handled in the proper manner.  Due to the unusual circumstances and time concerns surrounding this bill, I retract most of my previous statement and urge all members of the senate to vote in favor of this bill."
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,IBiteYou,6,Tue Mar 10 23:16:20 2015 UTC,"With all due respect, I could not find a template for a bill to expel a member.  It was necessary, also, to lay out the case and provide evidence for a just consideration."
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,laffytaffyboy,4,Tue Mar 10 23:29:13 2015 UTC,"I completely understand. This is unprecedented so some leeway should definitely be given. However, evidence should remain entirely separate from the bill itself. Idealy it should have been presented in this comment section for debate."
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,IBiteYou,4,Tue Mar 10 23:30:53 2015 UTC,"We don't have committees here.  In real life, the investigation would have been done in committee.    ""If expulsion is the recommendation then the subcommittee's report will be referred to the full House of Representatives or Senate where Members may vote to accept, reject, or alter the report's recommendation. Voting to expel requires the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present and voting.""  Basically, if we had a committee, they would have provided the evidence to the Senate.  Lacking this mechanism, it was necessary to present the evidence to the Senate via this bill."
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,laffytaffyboy,3,Tue Mar 10 23:36:06 2015 UTC,"The 'model' part of this model government certainly makes for confusion and I can perfectly understand why you preceded in the way you did. I would like to commend you on your argument, all evidence was gathered and presented neatly, just in the wrong location. If this bill fails I strongly recommend you resubmit. Your other bills are structured wonderfully and I would suggest you try to maintain that format."
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,IBiteYou,5,Tue Mar 10 23:42:01 2015 UTC,"all evidence was gathered and presented neatly, just in the wrong location   Ok, you must understand from my point of view.  Thank you for the above compliment, but in real life ... there would have been a committee that did the same thing.  They would have presented the evidence to the Senate and a vote would be had.  I have been communicating with the mods, waiting to see if they would do anything about the situation.    They left me to believe that I would get one shot at bringing this to the Senate.  Since I possess info no one else had, I was responsible for making the case against Crossbowguy.  There was no committee to do it, or I would have gone through a committee.  There is the matter of timeliness, too.  While we have been talking to the mods, time has passed.  We see this as a pressing matter, which is why it was expedited.  In a normal bill, I will maintain a format that is normal, but there was literally no other way to do this in the case of an expulsion.  I can't ask for an expulsion without providing the evidence.  It is a little ... upsetting to have spent the time to collate and explain the evidence and then to be criticized for having taken the effort to do it.  There was no other way under the existing system."
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,laffytaffyboy,3,Tue Mar 10 23:56:23 2015 UTC,"I fully understand. I will retract my statement and fully support this. While far from ideal, due to the circumstances, I can not imagine a better way to present this information. I certainly did not mean to criticize your effort to gather the evidence. The evidence is entirely necessary and I can tell you put a lot of work into it. On the bright side, if I understand correctly, the mods are working on a system to prevent this in the future."
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,Gohte,3,Wed Mar 11 00:21:06 2015 UTC,"I understand your concern, I really do.  My main frustration is with the comments of Septimus.  I very much tried to lay out all of the information as a committee would, so that the Senators had it all and could make an educated vote.  I hope the greens have not been poisoned against it because it really could have happened to any of the parties and it doesn't matter who it happened to, it was conduct unbecoming."
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,IBiteYou,4,Wed Mar 11 00:40:13 2015 UTC,"I can not speak for the entirety of the green party, and I certainly can not speak for Septimus. However, if I had a vote, it would be in favor of this bill. I hope that my fellow party members understand that the actions of /u/crossbowguy237 were completely unacceptable and that you and the rest of your party (for the most part, there's always a few exceptions when you get a decent sized group together) reacted in as professional, reasonable and just of a manner as you could."
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,Smitty9913,3,Wed Mar 11 00:48:36 2015 UTC,"This is the exact sort of thing I was upset about when SolidBlues' seat was given to a Democrat when he was made to choose between us and MHoC. I definitely understand the frustration and would have raised the same kind of hell you all are if the Democratic appointment had stayed in SolidBlues' place. If I were in a position to vote, this motion (a more appropriate label than 'bill') would have my aye. This kind of behavior shouldn't be accepted here.   Consider this an official statement."
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,IBiteYou,3,Wed Mar 11 02:13:21 2015 UTC,"With all due respect, as I said below... I was unable to find a template for a bill to expel a member.  I attempted, here, to carefully provide evidence in order that it would be clear to those voting exactly what transpired and why it is of concern to all."
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,laffytaffyboy,5,Wed Mar 11 06:44:24 2015 UTC,Are you joking round here?
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,keypuncher,2,Tue Mar 10 23:35:38 2015 UTC,Why would I joke when bill quality is at stake. This bill should be ~10 lines long.
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,laffytaffyboy,5,Tue Mar 10 23:24:04 2015 UTC,It is impossible to make the case and provide the evidence required in ten lines.
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,keypuncher,3,Tue Mar 10 23:25:51 2015 UTC,"Making the case and providing evidence should be separate from the bill itself.   Whereas Under Article I, Section 5, clause 2, of the Constitution, a Member of Congress may be removed from office before the normal expiration of his or her constitutional term by an “expulsion” from the Senate upon a formal vote on a resolution agreed to by two-thirds of the Members of that body present and voting, /u/Crossbowguy237[1]  committed gross misconduct and should be removed immediately from the ModelUSSenate   That (with some editing) should have been the bill, everything else should have been where we are having this discussion now."
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,laffytaffyboy,5,Tue Mar 10 23:36:26 2015 UTC,"That (with some editing) should have been the bill, everything else should have been where we are having this discussion now.   No, because the evidence would have been lost in the comments.  A good example is the Articles of Impeachment the House created against President Nixon.  All the charges and specifics were laid out.  In the real world, the Senate Ethics Committee would normally have provided the evidence to the Senate.  Do we have one of those?  Of course not - the body in ModelUSSenate is too small.  As such, some compromises must be made."
ModelUSGov,2ym6am,cmac__17,2,Tue Mar 10 23:40:47 2015 UTC,"You make a valid point. There has to be a better way to handle this, because it really shouldn't be in the bill itself, but we can't have it getting lost in the comment. I do stand by my statement that that excerpt should have been the bill, the question is where the evidence should go."

ModelUSGov,2ym24e,Didicet,1 point,Tue Mar 10 23:29:40 2015 UTC,"That's not how Presidential succession works. The office of the Vice Presidency is vacant until the new President nominates a new VEEP under Section 2 of the 25th Amendment. Currently, the Speaker of the House is next-in-line to the Presidency.  For more reference: Watch the West Wing episodes Commencement, Twenty-Five, 7A WF 83429, and The Dogs of War, as these comprise a 4 part saga that deals w/ the President stepping down during a time where there is no Vice President.  Although, I don't really see this scenario happening on this reddit unless someone kidnaps /u/Didicet's daughter."
ModelUSGov,2ym24e,Didicet,2,Tue Mar 10 23:35:40 2015 UTC,"Correct, /u/bsddc is the acting Vice President, until such time as the successor /u/Didicet nominates is confirmed by a 2/3 majority of both houses of Congress.

ModelUSGov,2yiazf,RoryTime,5,Tue Mar 10 22:27:44 2015 UTC,"So is the subreddit's Constitution even relevant or is just so you have something for people to read when they click on the wiki?  Also, what is the Model Supreme Courts job, and can you provide a more easy way to access that part of the community? So would it be ok if Smitty, and Jayhoo and Ibiteyou all decided that they felt like being Communists tomorrow? And then Pluralizer/Didicet decided that being Republicans was the hip thing too do, and Crossbowguy,.... Yeah you get the point."
ModelUSGov,2yiazf,schultejt,3,Tue Mar 10 03:46:22 2015 UTC,"""And then Pluralizer/Didicet decided that being Republicans was the hip thing to do...""   Rats!  How did you discover my plans!   ""Also, what is the Model Supreme Courts job, and can you provide a more easy way to access that part of the community?""   I think their role entails hearing any appeals to them about specific laws that have been passed/holding the executive branch in check.  Also, the Constitution is dated and needs re-writing."
ModelUSGov,2yiazf,IBiteYou,2,Tue Mar 10 03:58:10 2015 UTC,"Rats! How did you discover my plans!   Don't worry, I always knew you were a poor lost soul looking for my conservative guidance.   I think their role entails hearing any appeals to them about specific laws that have been passed/holding the executive branch in check.   So they have no jurisdiction when it comes to the subreddit's constitution?   Also, the Constitution is dated and needs re-writing.   Be that as it may, until it is done so I suggest we follow it."
ModelUSGov,2yiazf,IBiteYou,2,Tue Mar 10 04:14:18 2015 UTC,"""So they have no jurisdiction when it comes to the subreddit's constitution?""   Uh, my interpretation of the /r/ModelUSGov Constitution's intentions is that moderators enforce the constitution and the Supreme Court enforces the actual United States Constitution.  I could be wrong though, but we'd have to ask /u/lort683 for clarification.   ""Be that as it may, until it is done so I suggest we follow it.""   Me too!  But with that being said, I would suggest calling a ""/r/ModelUSGov Constitutional Convention"" of sorts, so we can better lay out and update the constitution to support the changes that have been made to the subreddit since its founding."
ModelUSGov,2yiazf,laffytaffyboy,2,Tue Mar 10 04:19:49 2015 UTC,"Smitty, and Jayhoo and Ibiteyou all decided that they felt like being Communists tomorrow?    Yep, that ok. The Senate seat belongs to the person not to the party, they just decide to  affiliate with the republicans.  Crossbow defecting was and ultimately a failing of the Republican party safeguards. As I've suggested before the republican constitution needs to have something preventing people who have not held a house seat before from running for Republican senator. However IBiteYou's expulsion motion is currently constitutional, so it will be put up tonight and then after it has been resolved (one way or another) expulsion motions will be banned."
ModelUSGov,2yiazf,IBiteYou,4,Tue Mar 10 07:31:35 2015 UTC,Why will expulsion motions be banned?
ModelUSGov,2yiazf,laffytaffyboy,3,Tue Mar 10 07:48:28 2015 UTC,"Crossbow defecting was and ultimately a failing of the Republican party safeguards.    I wish folks would not blame the victims here.  Perhaps every other party has something in their Constitution that prevents a person from running for the Senate unless he/she has won in the House ... but maybe they do not.  Going forward, certainly everyone should.  We will likely do this.  What happened in this instance is that there was a brief uptick in folks wanting to be a member after we won in the national elections.  We do not actually have an endless supply of people who want to seek office.  This time, there were more people needed, since Senators were added.  We can say that no one may run for Senate until after they have held a seat in the House, but that would have actually prevented me from running for the Senate.  So be it, if it can sort of prevent defections going forwards, but there is still nothing to stop a person from getting a House seat, winning a Senate seat and then leaving.  The only reason that what Crossbowguy did is SO egregious is because we lost people to the MHOC.  He got his chance to run and took it quickly.  Then his views almost immediately changed.  They changed in very big ways.  We had stated before in the subreddit that no one who was not Republican should be joining.  This brings up another issue.  In the main rules for the simulation, at the bottom, it says that we are not to sift through comment histories.  Let me suggest that, for our party Chairs and people who add folks to the subreddits, this is a problem.  Last week someone tried to join the ModelRepublicans and that person had previously joined the MHOC Liberal Democrats, so they were ineligible.  One would also be slightly skeptical.  Allow me to suggest that, while this is a simulation ... the mods add something to the rules that addresses the problem of people who seek to fraudulently join subreddits."
ModelUSGov,2yiazf,IBiteYou,2,Tue Mar 10 20:50:59 2015 UTC,This is something I believe should be changed and the mods are actively discussing.
ModelUSGov,2yiazf,laffytaffyboy,2,Tue Mar 10 20:23:07 2015 UTC,The supreme Court is supposed to send in a statement if passed bills are constitutional.
ModelUSGov,2yiazf,IBiteYou,2,Tue Mar 10 20:23:37 2015 UTC,"For some reason, Septimus got irked at me because I asked the mods to imagine if a green was elected senator and then days later said, ""I've been binge watching Milton Friedman and suddenly I'm going to the Republicans and I'm taking my duly-won seat with me."""

ModelUSGov,2yiazf,IBiteYou,2,Tue Mar 10 21:29:59 2015 UTC,"Will do, I definately agree on this one."
ModelUSGov,2yiazf,keypuncher,1 point,Tue Mar 10 22:21:21 2015 UTC,"That is a good point. Either way, I've informed the party head. Judging on his post history, (which I accidently found myself in while attempting to figure out how to PM him, how ironic) he should receive it in 10 hours or so. For now I suggest we just wait. The elections for that particular committee are planned for sometime in the next few days, so no rules are currently being violated."
ModelUSGov,2yiazf,schultejt,6,Tue Mar 10 21:52:00 2015 UTC,"I plan on making a suggestion to the mods about filibustering.  Essentially, the way the filibuster would work in /r/ModelUSGov is this:  To prevent the end of debate on a specific resolution (this would be the time set by the Clerk that all Senators must vote by), a Senator could rise and demand a filibuster.  A ""reddit live"" session would be created where the member would have the opportunity to ""filibuster"" the resolution that they object to.  A ""filibuster"" would entail a continuous post on reddit live, every minute or so.  If the Senator fails to continue the filibuster, they yield the floor to the Clerk who can then close debate and call for a vote.    A 4/6th majority would be required to break the filibuster, which would then result in the yielding of the floor to the Clerk, who can then close debate and call for a vote.  Rules surrounding the filibuster would emulate those of real life, but naturally, could be changed, if the Senate voted for passage of a rule change.     (Example: Ted Cruz's ""Green Eggs and Ham"" speech may be deemed inappropriate under new rules and would result in him yielding the floor.)   I think the filibuster is another bastion of American politics and it is a grand shame that we don't have the filibuster as an option here.  I would love to hear any further suggestions!"

Broadband providers may not block access to legal content, applications, services,or non-harmful devices. Broadband providers may not impair or degrade lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices. Broadband providers may not favor some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration – in other words, no ""fast lanes."" This rule also bans ISPs from prioritizing content and services of their affiliates.   Congress requires the FCC to refrain from enforcing – forbear from – provisions of the Communications Act that are not in the public interest.

That promise was renewed with the blood and sweat of the nation by another great Democrat, who added the right for people to choose their own government and to be free from imperial domination to the promise that we gave to the peoples of the world. Let us keep our promise.  Too often have the isolationist elements in American society gone unquestioned. Too often has the mere idea of interventionism been portrayed as either imperialist expansion or militaristic adventurism. Neither is the case; interventionism is the proactive application of foreign policy. It is the art of playing the long game, seeking not to prevent the next terrorist attack, or even the next North Korean nuclear test. Interventionism seeks instead to foster democracy, to create a more stable world where people can live free from fear of their government, a government which they can choose.  When the American People, through our elected representatives, declared to the world that we supported the rights of all people to self-determination shortly after the First World War, we made a commitment to uphold those values. The Atlantic Charter, in the Second World War, reaffirmed that support, and pledged to create a world “without want or fear”, with nations cooperating for the “advancement of social welfare”. To ensure such things, one can not sit on one’s metaphorical hands and hope for the best; one must act. I believe in action; I do not care what type. Be it soft, diplomatic, the use of force, or, god forbid, military intervention, we must not forget that there is no such thing as a hands-off peace. We must intervene when necessary.  I see three things that we can do to improve our strategic position. The first is a public works program like no other, combining massive reconstruction of highways, bridges, rail lines, and other transportation infrastructure with a naval building program that seeks to eliminate key weaknesses in our surface and subsurface fleets, as well as our Naval Aviation capabilities. The second is to reinforce our friends fighting for democracy the world over with arms, money, and technical advice. I refer specifically to the Kurdish Peshmerga, the Iraqi Army, the Poroshenko Government in Ukraine, the Baltic states, and Poland. Thirdly, I would like to see a foreign policy that backs up our will to prove that Right makes Might with the compassion to forgive our adversary once they are defeated. We must recognize that, while they (whoever they may be) may be our geopolitical enemy, they are cultured, modern peoples and nations, who have the potential to become friends and allies. George Marshall proved the value of compassion after the Second World War; we ought to follow his lead, just as we followed in that generation's footsteps with the Post 9/11 GI Bill.  At home, we must work to improve and protect the rights of all people. It should not matter where you came from, what the color of your skin is, what identity you choose, or who you love; we are all American. We all deserve equal pay for equal work. We all deserve a vote. We all deserve an education. We all deserve health care. Women deserve the right to choose to have an abortion or not. We all deserve to worship however we want, wherever we want. We all deserve, as our nation's founding document so eloquently states, the rights to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. We are all, no matter where we come from, who we are, or any other characteristic, Americans. It doesn't matter if you just stepped off the boat or are John Adams' direct descendant -- you are an American, with the rights, privileges, and duties that accompany that appellation.  It is our sacred duty to fight for what is right. It is our sacred duty to serve those in need. It is our sacred duty to make the world safe for democracy, and ensure that safety with everything in our power. It is our sacred duty to progress, to intervene, and all the while, to remember that moderation is the key to success. Compromise is not merely a part of a republic, but is the very heart and soul of good governance."

ModelUSGov,2y3h1e,IBiteYou,3,Fri Mar 6 03:08:51 2015 UTC,"The bill does exactly what it says it does.  When you go to work, you start paying taxes to Social Security.  Upon reaching a certain age or disability requirement, you are entitled to receive your Social Security.  It was pledged to the American people that this money was safe in a lock box, always to be in trust for us.  It is, literally, OUR money.  This ensures that no government will threaten the American people who are reliant upon Social Security unless the government is literally in such a state as there is NO MONEY.  As long as funds are available, Social Security will always be paid...on time ... by the government.  It will be prioritized and threats to not pay Social Security will never be issued.  Think of it this way... if you put your money in a bank and then went in to get $500 out, to pay your rent, and the bank said: ""We are not allowing withdrawals at this time""  you would be irate.  This is the same as threatening to not issue Social Security checks in a timely fashion.  It eases fears by ensuring that Social Security not be used as a political football.  We owe people that."
ModelUSGov,2y3h1e,schultejt,2,Fri Mar 6 03:20:11 2015 UTC,So then why not open an IRA or 401k? That way you have full control over how much you contribute/receive?
ModelUSGov,2y3h1e,IBiteYou,1 point,Sat Mar 7 01:35:28 2015 UTC,This is not currently the way it is set up.   Currently you have no choice but to contribute to your Social Security fund.
ModelUSGov,2y3h1e,IBiteYou,2,Sat Mar 7 04:17:07 2015 UTC,I understand that but we are hemorrhaging money through the current system. Social security is nothing but an entitlement program. Prioritizing it seems foolish when the money can be spent elsewhere on more important issues.
ModelUSGov,2y3h1e,laffytaffyboy,2,Sat Mar 7 05:27:02 2015 UTC,"The American Government has taken money out of American Workers paychecks for years, with a promise that the money would be returned to them in the form of Social Security when they reached the ""retirement age"".  Essentially the government is forcing the American people to loan them money, and I for one think that the Government should take care of its cititzens before it worries about anything else."
ModelUSGov,2y3h1e,I_miss_Chris_Hughton,2,Sat Mar 7 05:51:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, take care of, but not provide for. I don't think we should just cut it immediately, but it needs to be phased out. Prioritizing it does more harm than good. When it was first introduced there was a 5.1:1 worker to beneficiary ratio. As life expectancy increased and Americans began having less children, the payouts got smaller and smaller and smaller. In 2009 the ratio was 3:1 and in 2030 it is estimated it will be down to 2.2:1.  Prioritizing will only demand higher ""fair"" payments because there's not enough money in the system to dispense an amount that will keep a roof over seniors heads, and food in seniors bellies. We would either have to increase our borrowing (which would skyrocket the debt) or slash budgets to other well needed agencies and services."
ModelUSGov,2y3h1e,laffytaffyboy,1 point,Sat Mar 7 15:57:52 2015 UTC,"Social security is nothing but an entitlement program.    It is not.  People pay in to Social Security for their working lives.  It is not free to them.   Prioritizing it seems foolish when the money can be spent elsewhere on more important issues.   You understand that it became the de facto retirement program for millions of Americans who paid into it and that these people, literally, rely on it to live?"
ModelUSGov,2y3h1e,I_miss_Chris_Hughton,2,Sat Mar 7 05:30:45 2015 UTC,"I'll copy what I said in an other statement https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelUSGov/comments/2y3h1e/bill_015_the_faith_in_guaranteed_social_security/cp7au9n  You are correct that Americans pay into it, however that money is not kept in a locked safe with their name on it. It is pooled and dispensed to the senior citizens the following fiscal year. The money you put into social security years ago has already been spent. In 1960 there was a worker to beneficiary ratio of 5.1:1. Over time, the life expectancy went up, average number of children per household went down, and the cost of living went up. In 2009 the ratio was 3:1. In 2030 it is estimated to be 2.2:1. There is simply not enough money being put into the system for seniors to retire on.   Prioritizing social security would only make it mandatory to find another income source, which will be one of the following. We can raise the retirement age a few years to give us a little bit of time but that won't do anything in the long run. So we'd either have to increase taxes, slash budgets to other government programs and services, or increase borrowing which would skyrocket the debt.  I do not think it should just end overnight. We need to phase it out and encourage private retirement accounts.  Also, I don't know why you're being downvoted, everything you've said is factual."
ModelUSGov,2y3h1e,laffytaffyboy,1 point,Sat Mar 7 16:10:17 2015 UTC,"At this point, for me, downvotes are a source of pride.  I agree that Social Security spending is going to be a problem in future and I think that amending it is something worth looking into... I like the idea of allowing people to put some into private accounts.  For the moment, though, this bill is to prevent a president from saying, ""We are at a fiscal impasse... so I might not be able to send out those Social Security checks."""

ModelUSGov,2y3fzo,Libertarian-Party,2,Fri Mar 6 20:42:53 2015 UTC,"A few reasons.   1)  Gun owners typically know how to use their guns.  They either have someone knowledgeable train them, or they take a class.  I would be ok with a one-time training requirement for new gun owners, after which all paperwork (no computer records) will be disposed of after a 60-day period.  2) Required repeated training is an infringement and would amount to serious costs.  3) We do not favor a gun registry because of its potential to be used for confiscation.  Criminals will not comply with it.  It violates the privacy rights of Americans.  4) The government cannot be trusted with the information.  http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-03-01/news/ct-met-foid-card-brief-20110301_1_public-access-counselor-gun-owners-foid-cardholders  Releasing the names of gun owners would have told criminals which homes DID NOT have home protection and it would have told them WHICH homes to case and rob in order to acquire weapons."

ModelUSGov,2xktdy,HammerAndPotato,2,Sun Mar 1 20:07:55 2015 UTC,"being used on people awaiting trial   Being sentenced post-trial to rehabilitative labor along with being put in prison wouldn't come into conflict with this, then.   I think that you as a Marxist would agree that rehabilitative labor is exploitative to an even greater degree than wage labor, and would support this on those grounds, no?   I'd say that violent criminals need to either repay their debt to society or be removed from society. If we aren't going to allow the death penalty to be used on people such as rapists and murderers, those who cannot be rehabilitated, why can't we have them work to repay that societal debt? These violent criminals have traumatized their victims or the families of said victims. We can't sit around and let them do nothing to at least attempt to make up for what they have done.   Forced labor for criminals is much, much different than wage labor and is used in an entirely different context. So, to answer your question, no, as a Marxist, I agree with the use of rehabilitative labor within the prison system as a means of societal repayment.   Furthermore. my previous question was about prisoners consensually volunteering to do community service or whatnot in order to lower their sentences or just to have something to do."
ModelUSGov,2xktdy,HammerAndPotato,2,Sun Mar 1 20:48:24 2015 UTC,"More than half of all prisoners are nonviolent offenders.   Obviously. I'm saying that this should only be used for violent crimes.   I have a problem with the idea of repaying a debt to society in a capitalist society. Any labor they do will either go towards benefiting the bourgeois state, or the capitalist class. This is not productive to furthering the class struggle, nor is it conducive to suppressing the inherent contradictions of capitalism.   We happen to be in a capitalist-dominated congress and state. We can't just say ""oh we can't have this change happen because society is capitalist and therefore we can't have societal benefit because we live in capitalism"". We live in a bourgeois state, that's obvious. You, as an elected representative, need to look at this in a more practical manner. We cannot overthrow capitalism and entirely revolutionize all societal mechanisms while we are a minority within congress. We can only act in a more moderate fashion at this point in time. We cannot have our heads in the clouds. Saying we can't do something that is good for society and the people as a whole just because we live under capitalism is silly.   Then vote against this and write a law that requires punishment for crime to directly benefit the victims rather than the bourgeois state or the capitalist class.   I'd like to ask how this is going to pass in a congress where conservatives hold a majority, as well as how this theoretical piece of legislation would be much different than how we currently use rehabilitative labor."

Very similar is different from exactly the same. In denmark the mother gets 14 weeks the father gets 2 weeks. After that period of time they get 52 weeks to split between themselves to their discretion. Income is 100% of what they were previously earning. So it is not exactly the same. That is why I said it was very similar.  lastly this is a bit of a semantics thing and a massive pet peeve of mine and many other socialists. Denmark is NOT a socialist nation.

Studies show that paid leave actually has economic benefit, see study above. Allows people to opt out of time off for overtime pay, but at a decreased rate in order to encourage spending paid leave hours due to the economic benefit.

Work should never come before child raising when a new member of our society has come into life."

I would recommend that the death personalty be allowed for repeat capital offenders who already have a lifelong sentence and commit yet another capital offence.   However; I do find the death penalty in its current state in conflict with the moral underpinnings of a just society.

However, I have a few issues with the way you word your statement, along with some additions. First of all, you say repeat capital offenders who already have a lifelong sentence and commit yet another capital offense would be subjected to capital punishment. I would ask how one who is already sentenced to life can commit more crimes. Within the prison system, perhaps? My second comment would be that some crimes are so inexcusably horrible that we cannot let them pass. I would suggest setting a precedent on several grounds that would constitute capital punishment, including acts of terrorism, high treason, murder of more than, say, 15-20 individuals (just trying to throw out some numbers here), and various war crimes."

My only reservation for the death penalty would be repeat offenders who have committed additional crimes in prison. Many members of the Aryan brotherhood for example continue to commit the most vile hate crimes while in prison, and that is a time to apply the death penalty.   As for terrorism, high treason, and murder of multiple individuals, I am tempted by my revulsion for the crime to want them dead, but as the honorable member /u/DurianMD has already quoted, ""but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also""   We must give those we hate the most a chance at redemption, not for religious reasons, but because it is the right thing to do.

After the conviction, the White House received over 5,000 telegrams; the ratio was 100 to 1 in favor of leniency.[13] In a telephone survey of the American public, 79 percent disagreed with the verdict, 81 percent believed that the life sentence Calley had received was too stern, and 69 percent believed Calley had been made a scapegoat.[13]   this is absolutely disgusting."

To address your question, no, an elected representative receiving no compensation would certainly not be a ""slave"" as they are, one, not legally owned by anybody or forced to work without pay, as they are free to step down or not seek reelection."

Again, this is not to support the bill, I find the idea problematic at least, but I do not find the unconstitutional question as convincing as the myriad of other concerns.

The job of the president is VERY demanding.  He or she, technically, is in the job 24/7.

By lowering their pay, you would be lowering even further the possibility of the average person either getting in to Congress, much less even wanting to. If a well educated young lawyer can make much more in the private sector, why would they choose to become a congressman? We must protect the people integral to our society, and by making congressional pay lower, we increase the chances of only very rich people going into the legislative process.

I think that if you researched, you'd find out that the incomes of folks BEFORE they went into office was comparable to or greater than their pay in office.  On the other hand, we don't want elected officials who are basically paupers from the expenses they incur to serve.  Also ... as I mentioned... your median for a person who is single without kids may be quite doable.  But for a person who is married with a few kids, it's not as doable.  I do not think current salaries for elected federal office are unreasonably high."
ModelUSGov,2wx00g,HammerAndPotato,1 point,Tue Feb 24 04:01:37 2015 UTC,I mean it is fairly well known that most members of congress are doing fairly well for themselves before they become members of congress. It is really hard to build popular support for a campaign when you have no money.  You keep saying it is unreasonable for someone to live on a median income if they have kids and such. Remember that such an income is the median income of the united states. Around half of income earners are going to be making less than that. There are lots of people who have a ton of kids who are living on that much and considerably less than that much. Not everyone who is married and has lots of kids is able to make six figures.  I do think it would be reasonable to add a living stipend to cover expenses incurred due to being in a high office of the united states.   I do not think current salaries for elected federal office are unreasonably high.   I suppose on this we are just going to have to disagree on this point then. I think the money is better spent (or not spent) elsewhere.

ModelUSGov,2wx00g,givemethepen,2,Tue Feb 24 04:39:37 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with you on this one. It almost seems like members of congress would need to take second jobs in order to afford to live with their families in DC so they can do the job they were elected by the people to do. While public sector should not make someone rich, going in to public service should not make someone poor either. Members of Congress do not have a normal job, and it does require a certain level of dedication, and to think that a Member of Congress would have to finish up a long day only to go work at a McDonalds just to afford to remain in public service is sickening to me.

ModelUSGov,2wx00g,TheRealRailguy,2,Tue Feb 24 04:30:40 2015 UTC,"I have to echo the concerns of my esteemed Republican colleagues.  This is a proposal that those on the left should oppose in its current form, for just that reason alone.  The general consensus among us is that the federal government, as it stands, is an accessory to the interests of the wealthy.  Enacting such a proposal, which would severely limit the compensation that all members of Congress receive (the wealthy and the poor), would be a massive step backwards in out attempt to combat the emergence of oligarchy in the United States, as it would serve as a mechanism that limits the capabilities of the common man to serve.  That being said, it is first and foremost a privilege to serve the people of the United States.  If it was plausible, I would back a proposal to set all wages of all elected public officials to minimum wage, especially so those who rail so hard against it could see how hard it is to live off of it, especially in a metropolitan area with a high cost-of-living, like Washington D.C.  But that's not plausible.  Instead, what might be something to look into a little more is the possibility of paying representatives in proportion to how wealthy they are when entering Congress.  For example, under an arbitrary, merely hypothetical RL scenario, members of Congress like Republican Darrell Issa and Democrat John Delaney (the two richest members of Congress R/D) would make substantially less, from their service in the House than the poorest members of Congress, such as Republican Steve Scalise and Democrat Chaka Fattah.  As far as the President of the United States, I feel largely the same way.  While the job of President is incredibly demanding and consumes one's entire life, it is still totally unnecessary for an already incredibly wealthy, newly elected head of state to make $400,000 per year, while also having all other expenses already covered by the taxpayer.  I realize that the reason that people run for office isn't necessarily the pay, but why compensate the elected officials who, simply put, do not need to be compensated?"

And you'd have the wealthiest representatives earn little, while the ones who are not as wealthy earn more.  Let's have a compromise and leave things the way they are, eh?  None of us on the right here are voting for any pay increase."

Does it also justify black people making up 37% of the prison population? compared to only 59% for whites? Given that there are 5.89 times more white people in the US than black people surely that gap should be larger if the US isn't a white supremacist nation where white and black people are equals.  Back to wealth inequality, the median wealth ratio of white-to-black was 12.9 in 2013. Twice as high as the ratio of white people to black people in the US.

Let us not forget his negatives and only remember his positives before we start to embrace his 'ideology' and character.  EDIT: I think I need to rephrase my opinion here.  I believe that we shouldn't be passing judgement on historical figures when you don't take into account the persons flaws. Malcolm X did do some good things in his life. He helped blacks in ghettos and also promoted the black power movement, giving courage to young black americans. He improved the social confidence of African Americans.  However, in the wider context of the civil rights movement, I believe he was a detriment to the cause. He caused white resentment, meaning that the US government, already racist, didn't have to advance black status politically, economically, or legally. His movement, as short as it was, fuelled tensions which meant that blacks were further resented, meaning that blacks who did preach non-violence got backlash from racists."

Even before the march MLK was working for civil rights long before X."

""We shall overcome… I WONDER. I really WONDER."" Rapidly they found their white liberal supporters had disappeared isolating and radicalising black activists. The Vietnam War and prominent blacks including King's opposition to it further sapped federal support and funds for black socio-economic improvement.  It became increasingly obvious to blacks that continued advancement was dependent on a black show of force. Northern blacks expressed years of anger and disillusionment by rioting in more than two hundred cities. Militant young blacks hardened by years of white brutality were the product of a time where revaluating and questioning American society was the norm. Participants in the riots were not exclusively the young radicals however but came instead from a broad cross section of urban black society. The riots were thus urban black's way to vent their anger over racist police forces and continued discrimination in housing, and employment. Black power filled the ideological vacuum created by the failure of non-violent protest to cause real change in America's power structure."

There have been many great men and women in American history that do not have a federal holiday, but have had an impact on this country. Wouldn't you find it a bit odd if I stood up here and had my entire party comment on that individual? That seems more suitable for the newspapers than for an official government statement, quite honestly. It's nothing against you, I just find it odd.  The Charlie Hebdo shootings made a bit more sense to be posted here, since they were perpetrated by extremists and harmed our allies at a time where Americans' fear of extremism is increasing. If Malcolm X was assassinated today, I think that would be different, but since you're just reflecting on his death without proposing any sort of recognition, it seems a bit strange."

I've been lurking over here as well. I was considering joining the Democrats, but they've been cut down by the emergence of the Greens. And the Greens are the same people that form the core of the MHOC Communists, so they're likely to go down the same route. On top of that, ModelUSGov doesn't have the same level of debate as MHOC, though I would really like to see it succeed.   I was thinking of just creating an alt account for RPing in this sub. Would that be allowed?"

What does this sub think about possibly giving the President ""Executive Orders""? This would let the President be more active and important in the simulation. Of course, the Supreme Court could strike down these orders as unconstitutional, and if the President makes too many unconstitutional or unpopular Executive Orders, he/she could be impeached.  Edit: Just remembered something! What about a census every few elections? We could use this to make the House and Senate districts more equal, and also, if we ask for political affiliation on the census, it could be used by the Press to predict elections."
ModelUSGov,2w1bbc,Didicet,2,Mon Feb 16 04:06:42 2015 UTC,The administration is actively accepting applicants for cabinet positions. Message myself or /u/Pluralizer about figuring out a cabinet position you'd be interested in!

ModelUSGov,2w1bbc,jacoby531,1 point,Mon Feb 16 17:39:18 2015 UTC,"That's why I chose such a high number. As the sub grows, the number will grow. That way, your petition has to be really good and have a lot of support to make it to congress. Maybe a compromise would be to give the petition to your congressman, let him/her make any changes they think are needed, and then have them submit it ""on behalf of the people of [insert district]""."
ModelUSGov,2w1bbc,jacoby531,2,Mon Feb 16 20:56:10 2015 UTC,"10% of the number of subscribed users would be a fair number, I believe. At the moment that's 35, and since it's a percentage it would constantly change based on the subreddit's activity.   If you'd really like to present a bill without having the support of 34 others, you can always speak with the elected members of your party."

I'm not sure what the context was, but it was after UKIP and BIP members joined the call (it got a bit exciting then). He was saying 'ni**er' and referring to 'jews' and 'a-rabs' negatively.  I'm going to admit my fault with my statement in that it was in the heat of the defeat and I spoke very immaturely. I was unaware I would be making a statement at all until the last few minutes of the counting, and the frustration of loss was still there when I was writing it.

Segregation, lynchings, the denial of basic and fundamental human rights. I guess those just aren't big deals.

This doesn't mean that it is governments job to give people money for work. My opponent /u/adavis2014 wants to give $12,000/year. This won't help the American People, it will instead send this country deep into a harrowing debt.  I instead believe that the American People need more employment.

Especially when you consider that a UBI would allow us to eliminate other costly welfare programs. I already described in another comment how the savings from this and money from increased income and capital gains taxes would go to finance the UBI. If we can't fully pay for it through these methods, we can turn to monetary policy to cover the rest, as inflation is another overblown non-problem right now.   You say the American people need more employment, but where do you recommend they should be employed? It's no secret that mechanization has and will continue to eliminate jobs. Do you believe we should force people to work pointless, low-paying jobs just to get by?  You say that people need a purpose in life, and I couldn't agree more. But to claim that the UBI would do away with that purpose is utterly absurd. It would make it so people would be able to do things for that purpose, rather than to avoid starving.   Now tell me, how do you plan to ensure full employment? And how do you plan to ensure that all the employed receive a living wage?"

ModelUSGov,2vxegm,HammerAndPotato,2,Sun Feb 15 07:42:04 2015 UTC,"For one, the American Highway system is one of the most rundown in the world and we need to fix those. That would provide thousands upon thousands of jobs to Americans.   I also believe that Tax Cuts for the Small Business Owners, people that don't make a lot of money because their business is just starting would allow them to hire more employees.

For now I think we should consider 1) That with the current unemployment rate, it is unlikely that both parents would be unemployed, and 2) That it is ecologically irresponsible to have that many kids, and we should be working to educate people about the costs of raising kids and making sure contraceptives are readily available in order to prevent large family sizes like this."
ModelUSGov,2vxegm,adavis2014,3,Sun Feb 15 19:56:54 2015 UTC,Any legislation you would consider to limit the amount of kids people could have?  Or would you just punish them by giving them less income?

I'm an extremely libertarian-minded person and could never support a policy like that. Additionally, the UBI system would be giving them the same amount of income, not less as you said. I really don't see how they're being punished, and if you think that's punishment then it's only ideologically consistent for you to think that employers would be punishing those people by not giving them a raise due to their large family.  Birth rates are on the decline anyway in developed nations such as the US, and with increased education and access to contraceptives, I really don't see this as a huge problem."
ModelUSGov,2vxegm,adavis2014,2,Sun Feb 15 20:59:28 2015 UTC,You said that couples with kids would get the same amount as couples without kids.  That means that couples with kids live on less money.

However, it can be determined that this wouldn't consist of property seizure, merely the construction of new farms.   Like what and where? How will they compete with the private sector?   Instead of having manufacturing jobs for, say, Apple or Microsoft, in third world countries, there could be state-operated facilities opened on American soil. This is of course just one example, and the process would have to adapt depending on the industry. In some cases, the industry itself could just be nationalized.   Where does the money to fund these things come from?   By decreasing the bloated and unnecessarily large military budget, we could put billions of dollars into public works."

So you DO approve of seizing the control of the property of others via ""nationalizing"" entire industries.   Here is an example of something that should be nationalized:  Healthcare.  People should not make a profit off of medicine. This leads to stagnant medical practices. For example, it is more profitable to treat cancer than to cure it. Thereby, not much funding goes into developing an outright cure for cancer, simply more treatment methods.    Now, what you've done with the wording of that statement is implying that nationalizing industries key to the US economy and/or benefit of the American people is ""theft"".  I'd like to ask this in response: Is it not ""theft"" when American CEOs make millions upon millions, yet those who produce the products that make those CEOs millions of dollars get paid nearly nothing comparatively, especially in third world sweatshops?"

From Second Amendment rights of the citizens, to free speech, to the right from search and seizure, and unlawful surveillance. Hopefully, these laws can allow for a more free, and happy populace, free from the heavy hand of the government.

The return of investment that comes from NASA results in innovation, technological advancement, spin-off technologies, a tremendous amount of not only jobs, but careers, and finally positive role models that inspire future generations to excel.  I would propose a constant percentage of 5% of the federal budget, to be spent on space exploration (manned and unmanned), research and development(including the reopening of the Large Hadron Collider in North Texas), and a recruitment program that selects highly capable and qualified individuals directly out of our nations high schools.   This constant would be exactly that, constant. Unchanging in times of peace or war."

Though I'm interested if you would put support to a space elevator concept. It could significantly cut down costs on space launches once setup and pretty much put us far in the lead in space industry, not to mention have huge applications in telecommunications, being able to put up and take down satellites with ease, and possibly making the clean up of space easier. There are some issues with the materials, with carbon background being the ideal now, just needing further development."

ModelUSGov,2vxdl5,Libertarian-Party,1 point,Sun Feb 15 21:15:34 2015 UTC,"Ehh, true, but I think it's far more constructive in actually doing something to ease our access to space compared to the whole Mars sinkhole that the industry's heading towards right now. Though I think the whole push to Mars has more to do with the fact that it captures the public's imagination(and support) far more than the utility of an infrastructure project like the space elevator will. I feel like it'll end up like the moon landing, though. Once we send the astronaut on the surface and most people realize that the costs for them to actually go live there or at the least visit themselves are too expensive for them, they'll get disillusioned quickly with the whole affair, and the support for Space declines. I'm going for the space elevator concept for the reason that it's one of the more efficient concepts for lowering costs and increasing the ability to travel to and from space, in general, for all. Also, while I wouldn't go for building it right away, I'd be interested in perhaps doing a grant program to allow for further development for of the technology.

I'm finding myself enjoying other candidates' positions and my vote is already cast. Also, this third party, one region rule is pretty annoying. Imo if there was concern for too much quick growth, we should've just barred third parties from the Senate and have them divided in the House rather than stuff them up in one region and guarantee victory in that region.

ModelUSGov,2vtsrn,Gohte,3,Sun Feb 15 01:46:46 2015 UTC,"Ummm, okay? Yes, communism is abolishing private property. Yes, there can be no peace so long as class society remains and class society can only end when communism exists."

ModelUSGov,2vtxlg,RoryTime,6,Sat Feb 14 01:41:38 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid that this is a slightly meta question.  /u/OllieSimmonds, given that you're also the British Prime Minister on /r/MHOC - will you have enough time to devote to this and running another country? Also, I assume you'll be stepping down here once /r/ModelUSGov joins the model world. Why should people not vote for a representative they can trust to serve their entire term without abandoning them?"

I'll do whatever the ModelUSGov team wants/needs me to do in regards to a split between members of the MHOC and the /r/ModelUSGov.   I think the good people of the North East should vote for me if they want a stable and prosperous economy, someone who takes national security seriously, and someone who can work with Democrats, Republicans and Libertarians alike.   Rather than my activities on the /r/MHOC being a detriment to my campaign for a seat in the US. Senate, I think my experience in the Model World will mean the voices of my constituents would go further. I think the people of the North East want a Senator who can make the difference and can appeal to a wide base (both of voters and other Senators) , rather than a Senator who has very little knowledge of legislative procedure."

ModelUSGov,2vtxlg,BjornIronside,3,Sat Feb 21 16:55:21 2015 UTC,Why shouldn't workers be allowed to have control of the means of production?
ModelUSGov,2vtxlg,TheRealRailguy,4,Sat Feb 14 15:39:46 2015 UTC,Quite simply because the workers generally do not own the companies that control the means of production.
ModelUSGov,2vtxlg,rangerheart0,6,Sat Feb 14 18:27:33 2015 UTC,"Please tell me if I am interpreting this correctly, Are you saying that because they don't have control of the MOP that they shouldn't be allowed to have control of the MOP? if not what exactly do you mean by this?"
ModelUSGov,2vtxlg,TheRealRailguy,4,Sat Feb 14 18:32:46 2015 UTC,"I mean that in our system we allow people to own property and express control over what they own.  People who do not own the property do not have the right to exercise control over it, plain and simple."
ModelUSGov,2vtxlg,Gohte,3,Sun Feb 15 00:18:25 2015 UTC,Why don't you believe that people who actually use the means of production should have ownership/control over it?
ModelUSGov,2vtxlg,cmac__17,1 point,Sun Feb 15 00:32:37 2015 UTC,"Because they are being paid to operate it how the owner wants it operated. If they were to buy the means of production, then they can run it how they wish"
ModelUSGov,2vtxlg,TheRealRailguy,2,Sun Feb 15 14:26:08 2015 UTC,^ This.  Why should people who don't own the means of production have the right to tell the person who does own it how to operate it.
ModelUSGov,2vtxlg,rangerheart0,2,Sun Feb 15 18:00:03 2015 UTC,Can you define what you mean by ownership?
ModelUSGov,2vtxlg,AlasdhairM,1 point,Sun Feb 15 00:32:31 2015 UTC,"I believe in a capitalist economic system. One with significant government oversight and regulation, yes, but a capitalist one nonetheless. Workers control of the means of production is not mutually exclusive to those principles, so I have no problem with it."
ModelUSGov,2vtxlg,TheRealRailguy,2,Sun Feb 15 20:44:14 2015 UTC,"I believe in the worker's ability to band together in unions for increased worker benefits, but I also believe that no person should be forced to join a union nor any employer be forced to hire union members."
ModelUSGov,2vtxlg,Morgsie,1 point,Sat Feb 14 03:21:27 2015 UTC,Of course Trade Unions have a role to play they are to represent workers and make conditions better. I was looking at the Wagner Act earlier and various other legislation and case law aswell

ModelUSGov,2vtxuz,schultejt,4,Sat Feb 14 16:48:50 2015 UTC,I wish the amend the constitution to the point where it is a completely different item. Is that not allowed?
ModelUSGov,2vtxuz,BjornIronside,2,Sat Feb 14 21:54:31 2015 UTC,"If the American people support you, it is allowed. However, he isn't incorrect in saying you would be 'destroying the Constitution'. If it can not longer be identified as the Constitution we are all familiar with, it is, in effect, destroyed.  Which sections in the Constitution would you and /u/rangerheart0 attempt to change and why?"
ModelUSGov,2vtxuz,BjornIronside,5,Sat Feb 14 22:46:12 2015 UTC,"All of it, because it was written by slave owning bourgeoisie and not compatible with communism."
ModelUSGov,2vtxuz,BjornIronside,2,Sat Feb 14 23:01:43 2015 UTC,"More specific, please. What would you replace it with?"
ModelUSGov,2vtxuz,BjornIronside,3,Sat Feb 14 23:04:49 2015 UTC,"A constitution similar to any socialist republic. Cuba, USSR, etc."

ModelUSGov,2vtxuz,Gohte,2,Sat Feb 14 23:17:31 2015 UTC,"Well, for example, the idea of ""rights"" and the ""rights"" we are guarenteed are inherently bourgeois. These would be replaced with other, pro-worker guarentees."
ModelUSGov,2vtxuz,rangerheart0,1 point,Sat Feb 14 23:51:45 2015 UTC,America installed these for Iraq. They look pretty good.
ModelUSGov,2vtxuz,MasterVoids,4,Sun Feb 15 00:27:22 2015 UTC,Depends on whether or not you believe that people should adhere to a law brought about by imperialistic conquest instead of forming their own government.
ModelUSGov,2vtxuz,MasterVoids,3,Sun Feb 15 00:36:01 2015 UTC,"I actually hold ""constitutions"" in general to be fairly ineffective at protecting the rights of the people. Nor do I think ""rights"" in general are a good way of defining welfare in general.  For example lets look at gun rights. the constitution garuntees the right to keep and bear arms. However in many states they have passed a lot of laws that make it very difficult to keep and bear arms. While this is not technically going against the constitution you can see the inefficiency of the constitution at keeping that right intact. the idea of rights in general as a relationship between the people and the government is flawed at its core. If the only reason I am allowed to have privacy, or not be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment is because the government allows me too, there is a problem.  Now Onto what I would change in the constitution.   Instead of electing congresspeople I would like to create a system in which members of congress are delegates rather than representatives. Much in the same way you are running in the current election.  Make it so that delegates are easily recallable and replaceable by their constituents. remove veto power from the president, along with raising the threshold for the senate to pass things. If the senate has a large enough threshhold than it should be a law anyway. Possibly replace the executive office with some sort of council. Splitting up the power among people is good than having one person have that much power. Create amendment that vastly expands the size of congress. Each delegate should have less constituents so that they can more easily relate to them. This is not all inclusive by any means and these are just some ideas. Again I think that the idea of constitutions in general are flawed as said before. So many of these things I would like to attempt to change via law, With the support of constituents."

To clarify again, I am running as a delegate for the Republican Party, and so my personal views may differ slightly from what the party as a whole believes - which is what I would be voting for.   Here are my personal beliefs:   Is the right to collective bargaining one?     I believe that workers in the private sector should have the ability to group together to have a collective voice, yes. The government should not tell workers that they cannot pool their human capital together to send a more effective message.     The right to free entry and exit of a contract?    Individuals should have the right to negotiate contracts with one another freely.     The right to profit created by their labor?    You'll need to be a bit more specific with this one if you believe my answer is inadequate. If an individual agrees to work for a certain wage, that is the profit they are entitled to. Am I right to assume, since you are a socialist (again, assuming from prior history) that you are referring to a separate type of profit?

Instead of businesses being controlled by bosses or by private owners I would like to create a place where it is more beneficial to have those who work at the business own it and control it in its entirety  Political decentralization: I want to give more power to local governments, and institute more things like direct democracy. Publicizing and democratizing sectors such as the energy sector and the telecommunications sector.

ModelUSGov,2vtx1m,IBiteYou,5,Sat Feb 14 05:19:43 2015 UTC,"What is the role of the federal government in the life of the American citizen?   As little as possible.  The federal government is growing behemoth.  I think there are areas where power should be devolved to the states.  One of these areas is education.  I am not someone who believes in abolishing entire departments completely, but I think that we must take a close look at fraud and waste.  Incidents of fraud and waste must not end with an article written about them.  There need to be consequences for fraud and waste.     What are some pieces of legislation that you would propose?    I would be interested in seeing corporate tax rates lowered to 20%. This will take us from having the highest corporate tax rate in the world, to only being in the top 50%.  We would have the same corporate tax rate as Finland.  In addition to this I would propose the  ""Protecting American Jobs Act"" this would create tax for companies that operate here, but outsource jobs.  This legislation would impose a per worker tax on companies that hire non-US-citizen workers. The tax should be sufficient to make it significantly more expensive to hire non-US-citizen workers than to hire from the pool of Americans who need jobs.    Finally, what sparked your interest in politics?   I have been involved in politics since I was a youngster.  I began by helping out candidates at the local level.  I actually rode a unicycle in local parades that candidates took part in and I did the door-knocking and distribution of candidate literature.  Many lose sight of the fact that local politics are quite important.  As a young adult, I lived overseas and had the chance to talk to my peers from different countries and to observe life under different governments.  I really never outgrew my initial interest and, for me, being interested in and involved with government is a no-brainer in a free nation.  It impacts all of us."

ModelUSGov,2vohm9,TheNorthernBrother,2,Fri Feb 13 11:13:11 2015 UTC,"You call it an attack on unions, we would call it guaranteeing that no worker is forced to pay for political speech they may not support.   My point is this, we are not going after unions which are an extremely important facet of worker/management relations. We are trying to protect those who do not want their union dues being used for political lobbying.   So the vote comes down to this, if you support mandatory dues for workers vote for this bill, but if you support allowing people to opt out of a system that may not represent them vote for this bill."
ModelUSGov,2vohm9,Smitty9913,2,Fri Feb 13 22:50:38 2015 UTC,We are trying to protect those who do not want their union dues being used for political lobbying.   Then you've brought a sledgehammer to the kitchen to kill a fly.

Below are the proposed changes. It is however good to see that the Minority Leader remains vigilant in his recycling efforts.  RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES  Sec. 7. [§ 157.] Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities except to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment as authorized in section 8(a)(3) [section 158(a)(3) of this title].    UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES  Sec. 8. [§ 158.] (a) [Unfair labor practices by employer] It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer--  by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization:Provided, That nothing in this Act [subchapter], or in any other statute of the United States, shall preclude an employer from making an agreement with a labor organization (not established, maintained, or assisted by any action defined in section 8(a) of this Act [in this subsection] as an unfair labor practice) to require as a condition of employment membership therein on or after the thirtieth day following the beginning of such employment or the effective date of such agreement, whichever is the later, (i) if such labor organization is the representative of the employees as provided in section 9(a) [section 159(a) of this title], in the appropriate collective-bargaining unit covered by such agreement when made, and (ii) unless following an election held as provided in section 9(e) [section 159(e) of this title] within one year preceding the effective date of such agreement, the Board shall have certified that at least a majority of the employees eligible to vote in such election have voted to rescind the authority of such labor organization to make such an agreement: Provided further, That no employer shall justify any discrimination against an employee for non-membership in a labor organization (A) if he has reasonable grounds for believing that such membership was not available to the employee on the same terms and conditions generally applicable to other members, or (B) if he has reasonable grounds for believing that membership was denied or terminated for reasons other than the failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues and the initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership;  (2) to cause or attempt to cause an employer to discriminate against an employee in violation of subsection (a)(3) [of subsection (a)(3) of this section] or to discriminate against an employee with respect to whom membership in such organization has been denied or terminated on some ground other than his failure to tender the periodic dues and the initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership;  (5) to require of employees covered by an agreement authorized under subsection (a)(3) [of this section] the payment, as a condition precedent to becoming a member of such organization, of a fee in an amount which the Board finds excessive or discriminatory under all the circumstances. In making such a finding, the Board shall consider, among other relevant factors, the practices and customs of labor organizations in the particular industry, and the wages currently paid to the employees affected;  (f) [Agreements covering employees in the building and construction industry] It shall not be an unfair labor practice under subsections (a) and (b) of this section for an employer engaged primarily in the building and construction industry to make an agreement covering employees engaged (or who, upon their employment, will be engaged) in the building and construction industry with a labor organization of which building and construction employees are members (not established, maintained, or assisted by any action defined in section 8(a) of this Act [subsection (a) of this section] as an unfair labor practice) because (1) the majority status of such labor organization has not been established under the provisions of section 9 of this Act [section 159 of this title] prior to the making of such agreement, or (2) such agreement requires as a condition of employment, membership in such labor organization after the seventh day following the beginning of such employment or the effective date of the agreement, whichever is later, or (3) such agreement requires the employer to notify such labor organization of opportunities for employment with such employer, or gives such labor organization an opportunity to refer qualified applicants for such employment, or (4) such agreement specifies minimum training or experience qualifications for employment or provides for priority in opportunities for employment based upon length of service with such employer, in the industry or in the particular geographical area: Provided, That nothing in this subsection shall set aside the final proviso to section 8(a)(3) of this Act [subsection (a)(3) of this section]: Provided further, That any agreement which would be invalid, but for clause (1) of this subsection, shall not be a bar to a petition filed pursuant to section 9(c) or 9(e) [section 159(c) or 159(e) of this title]."

ModelUSGov,2vohm9,lucky_you_,5,Fri Feb 13 05:03:24 2015 UTC,So you don't support raising the minimum wage because you think that employers and employees should be free to negotiate and set it themselves. But you dont think that employers and employees should be free to negotiate who can and cannot be hired at a place of work? Why?
ModelUSGov,2vohm9,TheNorthernBrother,0,Fri Feb 13 16:22:00 2015 UTC,"I abstained from the minimum wage bill, therefore I'm not for or against it"
ModelUSGov,2vohm9,TheNorthernBrother,5,Fri Feb 13 18:29:22 2015 UTC,"Ahh well from your comments in it it seemed otherwise. However the same could be said about the vacation act where you said.   I'm not saying they shouldn't have vacation days, I'm saying they shouldn't be federally mandated. Doing so is a massive federal overreach in an area of labor relations that should be settled by workers and management   The very same principles apply. Why can workers and management bargain over vacation days but not who can be hired?"
ModelUSGov,2vohm9,Smitty9913,1 point,Fri Feb 13 18:38:26 2015 UTC,"This bill isn't about hiring/firing anyone from what I understand, although it was framed to be. It is my understanding that it is not possible to force any worker to join a union.   However; what the issue is this, the bill allows non-union members to be exempted from paying union dues, which are often times used for political contributions the contributor may not support.   This bill allows workers to guarantee they aren't forced to pay for political speech they may not support, and I believe that is an important liberty that should be protected."
ModelUSGov,2vohm9,Smitty9913,3,Fri Feb 13 22:47:59 2015 UTC,"A Right to Work law guarantees that no person can be compelled, as a condition of employment, to join or not to join, nor to pay dues to a labor union. Section    Not framing it as anything It says it right in the bill. I was more just curious why an employer and employee can bargain on something as simple as vacation days and a wage but they can't bargain on conditions for unemployment. My issue here is this bill is contrary to the statements made both in opposition to raising the minimum wage and in opposition to setting mandatory vacation days."

So I'm running as an independent so I can be an unapologetic Marxist without having to worry about being thrown under the bus by my anarchist comrades.

In addition to your high taxes on these businesses, 'fair' wages would bankrupt restaurants and others that rely on unskilled labor.

Instead it emphasizes workers' self management of the workplace  and decentralized structures of political government  asserting that a society based on freedom and equality can be achieved through abolishing authoritarian institutions that control certain means of production and subordinate the majority to an owning class or political and economic elite.  Libertarian socialists generally place their hopes in decentralized means of direct democracy and federal or confederal associations  such as libertarian municipalism, citizens' assemblies, trade unions, and workers' councils.   All of this is generally done within a general call for libertarian  and voluntary human relationships  through the identification, criticism, and practical dismantling of illegitimate authority in all aspects of human life.

If, as you say further on in your comment, you truly support democracy, you would not have made such a hateful comment as this. I think it's apalling that the leader of one of the two major parties has expressed distate toward the lives of people with whom he disagrees.

When a party puts forward candidates they must rank them   Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm assuming this means we must hold primaries to determine an order of candidates, then those candidates are assigned in that order if the district is won?"
ModelUSGov,2u51l5,IBiteYou,1 point,Fri Jan 30 20:31:42 2015 UTC,"For representatives the parties can field candidates in the district. Then when the election is closed we will calculate the amount of votes for each party, and put it through a d'Hondt calculator to calculate the amount of seats per party. The seats are then handed out to the appropriate candidates.   For example if in the South East District the Republicans win 2 seats and the Democrats one, the seats would be awarded to the Republican no.1 and no.2 candidates in the district as well as the no.1 Democrat candidate.  Parties may select their list and it's order however they want. Also you won't appear on the ballot in a region if you're not running their and you may not win more seats than candidates won in an area."

Then you'd do whatever calculations to determine how many seats each party gets, then pick the candidates from the list we gave you? I've never used D'hont before, so this is new, forgive me."

ModelUSGov,2tsr67,jakub70,1 point,Tue Jan 27 13:54:15 2015 UTC,"A maximum wage is unnecessary. Steeply progressive taxation is a better route to what you're trying to accomplish. The US at one point, for example, had a 94% top income tax bracket above a certain level. This type of ""confiscatory tax"" wasn't so much for revenue purposes, as the income level only affected one living person, but a reflection of acceptable levels of wealth at the time and desire to limit income inequality.  You could imagine a progressive tax system that reaches 100% above a certain level - say over $1 billion. This would effectively eliminate the possibility of anyone becoming a billionaire. I don't necessarily think this is a good idea, but high taxes on the top few percentage points of income earners should definitely be utilized for deficit reduction, expansion of the safety net, etc."

This was ABSOLUTELY baseless and in no way grounded in any sort of fact. Point out to me a single shred of evidence that indicates such. While y'all are doing that, I'll point out the evidence to the contrary.  In our party platform discussions, these were some of the top comments:   We also need to take a good look at our regulations. While regulations serve as a necessary instrument in ensuring the best care of the consumer, the employee, and the small business, a lot of regulations are put in place to do the exact opposite. Large, highly-profitable companies often advocate for menial, yet costly regulations, in an attempt to put their small business competitors out of business; this is wrong. At the same time, a good portion of our industries are not regulated enough.   ~/u/Pluralizer, 4 unique upvotes   I want: eco-friendly businesses, unions, and the whole 9 yards that will put the workers, rather than the leaders, first.   ~/u/MeityMeister, 3 unique upvotes   We must make clear that we believe that hard working Americans are worth more than 5% of income gains and that they deserve to be treated better. We must fight for this by supporting worker co-determination, unions, raising the minimum wage to $15.00, providing universal healthcare, making colleges tuition free, making education funds be distributed more equitably, etc.    ~/u/thedesertfox929, eventual party chairman, 3 unique upvotes   The US should begin cautiously nationalizing sectors which provide vital public services, chiefly the healthcare industry. The free market-regulated or otherwise-will always fail to provide adequate service at times that it is not clearly profitable or even clearly not profitable. The best way to counteract this is to bring public services, such as healthcare, into the control of the federal government would allow a greater ability in making decisions in the interests of individuals and society by removing the cost/profitability consideration in the decision-making process.   ~/u/chestnutarthur, sitting Democratic congressman, 1 unique upvote.  These were specifically in our thread on business. These are the facts, that these were the top comments made by current Democratic party members upvoted by several people because these are the values that we stand for as the Democratic party, i.e. against corporate vulture capitalism, not the Koch Brother lapdog, Wall St. dick-sucking corporatists your party painted us as when it welcomed itself into the sub. I should have hounded this as a violation of Article 8 of the MUSG constitution like I did with Smitty's comments, i.e. it is an inflammatory and highly, HIGHLY insulting accusation to make that we've sold out our values to corporations without a single SHRED of evidence! In the MHOC party sign-up thread, there's a clear warning that MHOC parties do not necessarily follow the dogma of their real-life counterparts. It should have been PAINFULLY OBVIOUS that it would be the same here in MUSG, instead the Greens took the liberty of assuming.  THAT is what irked me about the Green opening statement. That y'all just assumed what our party is and what it stands for."
ModelUSGov,2tgdwt,rangerheart0,2,Mon Jan 26 01:29:15 2015 UTC,"First of all thank you for your long and detailed response.   I wanted to start off by saying that most if not all of us over at the green party realize the mistake we made with our highly inflammatory statement. The assumptions we made were in no way fair. That is the reason I am have asked this question of the reps and dems, so we do not make the same mistake in the future. However there are a couple things that I would like to point out. The first being we had no access to the democratic or republican party platform (I realize at this point we should have asked), and we had no access to the evidence that you just posted, so seeing all of the conversations about ""realism"" here we assumed that the parties were fairly close to their real life counterparts. So while our accusations may not have made sense in the context of the modelUSgov, I can definitely make the argument that they are 100% fair arguments to make against the real democratic party. That is what they are based on. Again not that we should have made those accusations, we definitely should not have. That is just the context in which they were made.   , HIGHLY insulting accusation to make that we've sold out our values to corporations without a single SHRED of evidence!    again we had no evidence that you guys were not the same as your real life counterparts.   In the MHOC party sign-up thread, there's a clear warning that MHOC parties do not necessarily follow the dogma of their real-life counterparts.    Where Is this? I looked at the party sign up threads and I did not see this?   It should have been PAINFULLY OBVIOUS that it would be the same here in MUSG, instead the Greens took the liberty of assuming.   Where is this painfully obvious evidence? All of the evidence  you have given me in this post was not availible to us. At the time of writing our opening statement there were only 3 bills that had been voted on all of them with the results I would have expected except for maybe the taft-hartley act.  With all of the evidence that you have posted this has been made more clear. Having participated in the debate on the past few bills our party has a much more realistic view of your party. However when you say our accusations were baseless I would argue that they are not baseless they were just based on the real life democratic party, which again I would argue is a completely fair accusation.   THAT is what irked me about the Green opening statement. That y'all just assumed what our party is and what it stands for.   Yep, that is why I am asking this question. Do you have an answer as to what differentiates you all from the real life democratic party? or is it just the things you have put in the evidence section of your post?  Thanks again!"
ModelUSGov,2tgdwt,rangerheart0,1 point,Tue Jan 27 07:01:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's a bit presumptuous to go out on a limb and declare a party, that at its founding, encompassed the entire left side of the political spectrum to be the same as the real-life Democratic Party.  I mean, when there is really nothing to suggest, at all, that we are one in the same, but instead evidence to support the opposite (rejection of Keystone in the name of environmentalism, repeal of Taft-Hartley), it's really lowly of the Green Party, in its first statement, to come out and say that we sacrifice our values at the feet or corporations and bureaucracy.  There could have been a bigger sample, but to deduce that from that either shows a serious lack of political literacy or demonstrates a desperate attempt from the Greens to try and steal members from the Democrats.  I would hope, that in the future, your party treats us more as equals, as more-or-less are, and less like centrist, corporatist Democrats, because the sort of character defamation from both sides, in the hopes of getting more electoral support, gets real old."
ModelUSGov,2tgdwt,JamMan35,3,Tue Jan 27 13:08:47 2015 UTC,"Our opening statement was presumptuous and we should not have made it in the manner that we did. I did not mean to justify the remarks made inthe opening statement, merely to provide context In the future we will keep in mind your differences (hopefully there has already been evidence that we have already been trying to) and treat you all with more respect.

ModelUSGov,2tgdwt,SolidOrangeGangsta,6,Tue Jan 27 13:11:06 2015 UTC,Can you tell me who the moderate voter is? What does s/he believe is a proper function of a Federal government?
ModelUSGov,2tgdwt,SeptimusSette,2,Fri Jan 23 23:13:05 2015 UTC,The typical American voter - probably stands somewhere between the democrats and republicans. Anybody who believes that there is a proper role for government but is wary of it going too far. Someone who agrees with the majority view on a majority of issues.
ModelUSGov,2tgdwt,e-s-o-t-e-r-i-k-o-s,2,Sat Jan 24 03:56:47 2015 UTC,"There are a few things that the Republican party does very well.  One of these things is help the american people have their attempt at the American dream. The United States is one of the few places in the world where your right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness been so protected throughout its history. The republican party has some flaws, all parties have flaws. However when it comes to the overall picture, the republican party is the party that, at least to me, is the party that stands for freedom and democracy the most. But how do they appeal to the moderate voters. The more government restrictions that we place on the American people the less freedoms that we get. I feel that the republican party is the party that is truly fighting for the people."

ModelUSGov,2tgdwt,SolidOrangeGangsta,2,Sat Jan 24 04:52:50 2015 UTC,"As a general rule, yes. These regulations have the effect of helping big businesses by raising the barrier of entry for competitors. Creating a more free market means more everyday Americans have the option of being their own boss (currently there are 45 countries where there is less difficulty in starting a business[1] - that is shameful), and competition brings down prices and creates market pressure to serve people better.  Also, in a lot of these cases the government is very much overstepping its bounds. A bad precedent is set when you have literally millions of regulations, with thousands more being issued every year.[2] If you want to buy raw milk, you have the FDA to ""protect"" you from yourself. If you want to be something like a florist or a funeral attendant, in some parts of the country you are required to purchase licensing.

It still irks me how we were accused of being corporatist, for example, in the Green opening statement, and his question seems to be following that same vein. Many Model Democrats are non-interventionist. I personally am interventionist, though.   We are the dominant and preeminent force in the world. If the United States pulled out of its leadership role, there are three main possibilities. One and two are China or Russia taking our place. Can anyone really say they'd rather China or Russia leading the world? You think the US exploits the world now (which is debatable)? Just imagine how they would exploit the world if they were in our place. You don't have to look very far to get a view as to what that would look like, just look at Russia in Crimea or China's bullying of Vietnam and snuffing out democracy in Hong Kong. The other option is no nation is able to take our place, whereby you have minimal leadership and the world starts factioning off into even more groups than there are now, giving you effective anarchy on the world stage.  A good documentary I recommend about this is The World Without US, which covers the US's role in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East and what would happen, in both American officials' opinions and officials from those regions, if the US left the world stage."

ModelUSGov,2tgdwt,Smitty9913,2,Sat Jan 24 16:25:36 2015 UTC,"I think we should avoid boots on the ground, and intervention that overthrows established governments. However, intervention is important against genocidal organizations like ISIS. Ultimately, protecting the Kurds and preventing further expansion is a positive.   There are concerns with airstrikes against ISIS, for example breeding terrorism and humanitarian costs. But I would say where we deal significant blows to ISIS we should look to do so. Drones mean we can be more precise and avoid civilian targets. I think if in the long-term the direct human cost is significantly outweighed by protection against terrorist organizations taking action is justified.   The other thing is a situation like Russia. Putin's government is engaged in a pernicious program against the wishes of the Ukrainian people and we have wielded our economic power effectively to delegitimize his action. Gary Kasparov recently stated that Putin would be telling his advisers that the west can't hold up longer. We shouldn't let up just as we begin to slow Russian incursions on the sovereign state of Ukraine."

The dollar amount of the minimum wage has for too long remained stagnant and caused undue burden on honest, hard working individuals who are just trying to get by. At this time employers can bear this slight minimum wage rise far more easily than minimum wage workers could bear the previous status quo."

ModelUSGov,2syjbk,rangerheart0,2,Tue Jan 20 21:37:01 2015 UTC,It depends on how permanent a job it is. The bill seems to draw no distinction between how many hours you are employed per day.
ModelUSGov,2syjbk,SeptimusSette,2,Tue Jan 20 00:00:12 2015 UTC,"This is what I wrote on the Green's subreddit:   I changed much of this bill based off of criticisms received from all four parties. I recognize that mandating a minimum of 21 days paid vacation for seasonal businesses was a major overlook, and not intended. I have modified that above. The other major change, removing federal holidays from the equation was requested in some form by many members. While I don’t think this bill would have caused major issues for police, health care, etc, because I have some  trust in these industries' logic, I feel like removing them from the equation is a beneficial change. I feel like most people don’t really care about GW’s birthday or Columbus Day enough to warrant them replacing a free choice vacation day. I feel like this iteration of the bill gives workers more choices on when to take work off, and covers the concerns for seasonal or temporary jobs."

ModelUSGov,2syjbk,bsddc,1 point,Mon Jan 19 20:47:56 2015 UTC,"I maintain my objections to this bill. Why 28 days? Why is this arbitrary number good for every profession?

Why is this bill better than individual unions negotiating with employers, which is more specialized, less costly, less arbitrary, and much less of a federal overreach?"
ModelUSGov,2syjbk,rangerheart0,2,Tue Jan 20 14:55:33 2015 UTC,"28 days is not a random number, its 4 weeks even. That seems to be a fairly reasonable number.    Why is this bill better than individual unions negotiating with employers, which is more specialized, less costly, less arbitrary, and much less of a federal overreach?    because only like 10 percent of workers are unionized.

On a separate note, I will simply state that this bill once again restricts the businesses in the United States. I would also like to point out that large scale early retirements and huge vacation times for many European countries are the part of the reason for economic stagnation in these countries. France's 30 hour week proposals and Greece's pension program are two of many awful policies.   However, I do not see this bill as a large threat to free business practices in the United States, and so I will neither support nor condemn this bill."

ModelUSGov,2ss20z,cmac__17,5,Sun Jan 18 05:42:41 2015 UTC,What's your view on the Electoral College? Hasn't that part of the Constitution failed us four times in our history when the winner of the popular vote was not the winner of the electoral vote?
ModelUSGov,2ss20z,cmac__17,4,Mon Jan 19 02:16:13 2015 UTC,"First off, I believe it has happened 5 times, not 4. And while I do believe that the Electoral College is not something that benefits our nation at the present, I don't think that it failed us. The main issue that I have with the Electoral College is that it actually gives a slightly larger vote weight to people living in small states (Wyoming technically has the highest vote weight per resident). This is derived from the fact that the electoral college votes are equal to the number of congressmen, which causes and imbalance in favor of smaller states."
ModelUSGov,2ss20z,Gohte,3,Mon Jan 19 03:13:25 2015 UTC,"Would you support a movement to reform or abolish the Electoral College based on these negatives? If you would reform it, what would you change about the Electoral College to make it more representative?"
ModelUSGov,2ss20z,cmac__17,4,Mon Jan 19 15:47:28 2015 UTC,"It would depend on the measures and timetable to implement those measures. Immediate removal of the Electoral College could cause confusion and chaos within the system for the next election. However, I feel that reform could be made. This could be done by having the number of Electors tied to population, not number of Congressmen. Another point of issue is that sometimes voter turnout can affect how much a vote weighs. So, a possible nationwide popular vote determination could solve this problem, but organization and coordination of this with a nation of 320+ million people could prove to be very difficult."
ModelUSGov,2ss20z,cmac__17,2,Mon Jan 19 16:03:15 2015 UTC,"Do you accept that the fact that the votes of people living in less populous states are given more weight is not the only problem with the Electoral College? Another problem with it is that it's winner-take-all on a state level. That is, if a candidate wins 51% of California's popular vote they get 100% of its electoral votes.  A national popular vote (i.e. a first past the post system) has its flaws as well. Do you think even the popular vote should be replaced by a preferential voting system like Mixed Member Proportional or Single Transferable vote to more accurate reflect the will of the American people?"
ModelUSGov,2ss20z,cmac__17,2,Mon Jan 19 17:11:44 2015 UTC,"I think that these systems would provide a better voting system within this country. My issue with them is, again, implementation.

[...] ""this may lead to a situation where the voices of people who are not in dense population centers are drowned out, because the politician knows that if he/she promises X Y and Z to certain populations, he or she gets the office.""   This is true now with high population states and I don't see how it would be any different under proportional representation and no Electoral College. I'm having trouble understanding the point you're trying to make here. It's just as easy to pander to rural populations as it is to pander to urbanized populations.   You are if you are asking a SC Justice their views on it.   I don't follow here either. This is a thread specifically to ask the Justice to-be his or her views on issues we find to be important and relevant to his or her job. The need for the abolition of the Electoral College seems to be universally recognized in the Green Party and if possible (I'm not sure if there's a framework for constitutional amendments in the model government), I think everyone would want to try to achieve that goal through the proper legal method."
ModelUSGov,2ss20z,cmac__17,3,Tue Jan 20 01:45:53 2015 UTC,"There are many, many more like me.   You are a socialist in Tennessee.  What do you expect?  I lived as a conservative in Illinois...so I know your dilemma.     This is true now with high population states and I don't see how it would be any different under proportional representation and no Electoral College.    Seriously?  Come on.  Politicians would hang out in big cities.  All programs would be geared towards big cities.  You'd see a lot of blatant pandering to cities in order to get that vote.  Come on.   It's just as easy to pander to rural populations as it is to pander to urbanized populations.   But why pander to rural populations if there's no population there.  That's the point.  It would NOT be easier.  The cities would have all the influence.  Politicians would spend all of their time in dense population areas.  http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/view_from_chicago/2012/11/defending_the_electoral_college.html"

We shouldn't have to live with the negative circumstances of an unfair system just because they're expected. I deserve representation just as much as all of the Republican voters in my state do.   Seriously? Come on. Politicians would hang out in big cities. All programs would be geared towards big cities. You'd see a lot of blatant pandering to cities in order to get that vote. Come on.   I understand what you're getting at now, and I don't really have an answer for that.   If most of the voting population lives in major cities (not sure if this is true or not, just hypothetical), then wouldn't preferential treatment to those living in cities based on sheer population be a natural side effect of the democratic-republican government type we've established? Just because the population dense areas of our country don't tend to agree with your views (or mine, for that matter), doesn't mean that rural voters need to be given unfair representation.  My primary point against the electoral college is the FPTP system it uses to decide who gets the votes, because there are millions of people who don't have a voice in their country, from Tennessee communist to New York Republican.    http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/view_from_chicago/2012/11/defending_the_electoral_college.html   I spent a few minutes typing up a response to the claims in that article, but /u/curledbdt is right, this isn't really the place for partisan debate, so I'll leave it here. We can keep discussing in private message if you want."
ModelUSGov,2ss20z,cmac__17,3,Tue Jan 20 02:39:58 2015 UTC,The top 100 most populous cities only make up about 20% of the total population. The idea that if you got rid of the Electoral College candidates would only pay attention to big cities is ridiculous.
ModelUSGov,2ss20z,skepticalpineapple,1 point,Tue Jan 20 02:52:46 2015 UTC,"We shouldn't have to live with the negative circumstances of an unfair system just because they're expected.    So you think that, despite the fact there are very few of you in Tennessee, you should be able to change the system from what others want?  If you want to live under a socialist system ... move to a socialist country... or even a more socialist-friendly state.  You understand that what you have just said is akin to, ""I am a fascist.  I don't understand why I can't live under a fascist system just because most people don't want to...""   I understand what you're getting at now, and I don't really have an answer for that.    Of course you don't.  We have an electoral system in order to avoid the ""tyranny of the majority"".  If the cities all voted conservative ... you would understand why the founders set up a Republic with an electoral college.   doesn't mean that rural voters need to be given unfair representation.   They aren't.  They are given equal representation."
ModelUSGov,2ss20z,cmac__17,3,Tue Jan 20 05:37:13 2015 UTC,"The idea I think he is trying to convey here is that instead of a few gigantic cities, the current system has candidates campaigning in several large states (CA, FL, NY, OH, IL, etc.). Switching to Direct Proportional would have the candidates campaign in only the cities, meaning they would only visit places like New York City, Los Angeles, Houston, etc."
ModelUSGov,2ss20z,skepticalpineapple,2,Tue Jan 20 02:20:26 2015 UTC,"The electoral college was designed so that areas of large population would not be the only areas represented.   This argument simply ignores the reality of population distribution in the US. The top 25 most populous cities in the US only constitute about 10% of the total population. If the Electoral College were abolished, presidential candidates couldn't simply fly from New York to LA to Chicago and win the election.  In any case, if the goal of the Electoral College is to get candidates to pay attention to the small states, it's failing spectacularly! When was the last time you heard about a presidential candidate campaigning in Wyoming or Alaska? The Electoral College doesn't make candidates pay attention to small states. It allows them to only campaign in a few swing states (Ohio, Florida, Virginia, and Pennsylvania). So by your own criteria, the Electoral College is a bad system."
ModelUSGov,2ss20z,skepticalpineapple,2,Tue Jan 20 02:25:46 2015 UTC,I would fully support an amendment abolishing the Electoral College as well. A country that bills itself as the greatest democracy on Earth should be ashamed to use such an outdated and broken system.

I am relatively new to this system, so there has not been much time for me to settle in, make alliances, and decide who to trust. As such, I feel that this lack of experience will aid me in making fair decisions on bills and judgments which come to me, since I will not have bias towards or against any particular person or party.  I believe ultimately that the Constitution should override any sort of party, organization, bill, or idea. The United States has seen the majority of its most dire times when it strayed off the path that our founding fathers left for us to follow. As such, I will rule on cases based mainly on whether the Constitution allows it in my interpretation, not in what I believe is best from a partisan standpoint."

ModelUSGov,2ss20z,cmac__17,3,Sun Jan 18 02:25:39 2015 UTC,You said on the thread announcing your nomination that you are a Republican. Why do you say you have no real party affiliation?
ModelUSGov,2ss20z,cmac__17,3,Sun Jan 18 12:46:30 2015 UTC,"I say that I have no affiliation because I have not had the time to settle in. Like most parties, the Republican Party has a wide base, and our views differ. The reason I am a Republican is because I agree with more of their views than I agree with the other parties. Not all of us agree on every issue."
ModelUSGov,2ss20z,cmac__17,3,Sun Jan 18 13:41:29 2015 UTC,Do you feel that recent decisions on marriage equality by federal courts infringe upon state rights?  I personally do not find the decisions to infringe upon state rights.
ModelUSGov,2ss20z,cmac__17,2,Mon Jan 19 04:33:06 2015 UTC,"I think that it is somewhat of an infringement, seeing as it is a reserved power for the states to issue marriage licenses. While I am personally okay with gay marriage, I feel that if a state's majority of voters wish to not have the institution allowed within their state, then it is their right to do so, so long as the ban does not infringe on a couple's federal benefits."

ModelUSGov,2ss20z,cmac__17,3,Tue Jan 20 03:51:46 2015 UTC,"I have no doubt that the 14th Amendment applies to the LGBT community. The text I assume you are referencing is in section 1:  ""nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.""  I feel as though this does not bar a State from passing such legislation if the majority of their voters feel that it should be passed, since it says ""without due process of law."" However, legislation which bars couples from receiving their federal benefits is unconstitutional."
ModelUSGov,2ss20z,AllTheyEatIsLettuce,6,Mon Jan 19 22:42:32 2015 UTC,"The SCOTUS has found that substantive due process incorporates protections of the Bill or Rights and, as such, is binding on state governments as well as the Federal government. Liberty, as the Court has held in this century, is not a specifically enumerated list of rights but a continuum of freedom through which every facet of human behavior is safeguarded from arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints.  From one geographic perspective in respect to another, maybe a mile or so away, what purpose does denying a marriage license to two consenting adults serve?"
ModelUSGov,2ss20z,cmac__17,1 point,Tue Jan 20 00:45:38 2015 UTC,"I do not see any point in banning the institution, all I have said is that if a state's majority of voters wish to do so, and it does not violate said couple's right to federal benefits, then they should be allowed to do so."

Let the merit of such a re-authorization stand on its own for debate rather than attempting to graft across-the-board insurance deregulation onto a Treasury bill. You've added quite a bit in actuality. But subtracted a bit, too, by removing the triparte consultation requirement of Treasury, State and the AG in favor of just Treasury and Homeland Security.

ModelUSGov,2sc05q,risen2011,2,Wed Jan 14 01:08:49 2015 UTC,So are we supporting age based discrimination now? That would just give an employer more opportunity to oppress a younger worker just by virtue of their age. It wouldn't take into account the amount of work put in or experience at all. Wouldn't a 20 year old working hard at a factory for two years deserve more pay than a 35 year old who just got the job two weeks ago?
ModelUSGov,2sc05q,Smitty9913,3,Wed Jan 14 06:35:14 2015 UTC,The main idea is that if your under 21 you are much more likely to already living at your parents house or you will be in a school. If you are over 21 and you have a minimum wage job then you been the money more as you are more likely to live on your own house and your more likely to have a family.
ModelUSGov,2sc05q,risen2011,2,Wed Jan 14 15:58:16 2015 UTC,"I still disagree with you, but now I see where you're coming from.

So you'd actually hurt everyone living in the house, not just the young person."
ModelUSGov,2sc05q,jaywhoo,2,Wed Jan 14 16:21:25 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily: it depends on the value of the worker.  The 35 year old may command more pay because he/she is inherently more valuable to the company through past experience/knowledge. Loyalty doesn't necessarily mean efficiency.

They've probably never worked this kind of job before. Certainly it's possible younger person can have more value to a company than an older one. And if we implement this discrimination I can see situations like this popping up everywhere.

ModelUSGov,2sc05q,Smitty9913,1 point,Wed Jan 14 01:23:44 2015 UTC,Not that I am opposed to raising the minimum wage but it really would be more effective to tie the minimum wage to inflation.

ModelUSGov,2sc05q,IBiteYou,1 point,Tue Jan 13 23:33:14 2015 UTC,"This bill is pointless, insted of trying or give an answer to a problem it's only bringing up more questions. How many hours a week is full time in this bill? Does this bill follow inflation? And lastly, have the apeffects of this bill even been realised? This bill will effect almost no citizens. And the very few that it does are more likely to be fired because they work in jobs like I do. Small end family run stores that can't afford to pay this much money. If this bill is passed IRL I would lose my current job along with thousands others."
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,ChestnutArthur,6,Tue Jan 13 02:36:21 2015 UTC,"While I wholeheartedly support the spirit of this bill, I cannot support this it in its current state. As /u/bsddc has rightly pointed out, there are positions which need filled all year long, including on federal holidays. Were this bill amended to include provisions for those who are needed on these days - mandating that employees be given the option to take a certain number of federal holidays off and requiring double pay for employees working holidays, for instance - I would gladly support it, but in its current state I will likely vote against it."
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,SolidOrangeGangsta,4,Tue Jan 13 06:31:42 2015 UTC,Thanks for the great response. /u/bsddc makes a great point and I'm glad you agree with it.
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,SeptimusSette,2,Tue Jan 13 07:05:32 2015 UTC,I had asked for this bill not be voted on. It will have second readings.
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,ChestnutArthur,2,Tue Jan 13 20:36:54 2015 UTC,"I will be interested to see what changes and additions are brought to this legislation. As a supporter of the rights of workers I worry that this bill in its current form would cause increased rather than decreased strain on the average employee in many fields, but with just a bit of change could be highly beneficial to all."
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,IBiteYou,1 point,Tue Jan 13 21:35:51 2015 UTC,"This bill must be changed.  So far no one has mentioned that it doesn't specify full-time and part-time employees.  I don't think it is the federal government's business to mandate days off, but if the left insists on doing this ... you cannot mandate that part-time employees get this time off."
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,jaywhoo,4,Thu Jan 15 22:39:30 2015 UTC,"Wait, why is it the federal government's place to do the job of Unions for them?  Oh, that's right, rapid government expansion makes people feel good, despite being absolutely horrid."
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,jaywhoo,1 point,Tue Jan 13 10:42:03 2015 UTC,"I don't see how your comment contributes to the discussion. Rather than opposing any and all ""government expansion"" on principle, why not give better reasons for opposing the bill?"
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,jaywhoo,2,Tue Jan 13 21:26:08 2015 UTC,Because the only reason I need is that the federal government has no place and no right to mandate vacation hours. Leave that up to the workers to collectively bargain with their employers.
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,cmac__17,0,Tue Jan 13 21:57:34 2015 UTC,Do you think the Fair Labor Standards Act (i.e. the law that requires employers to pay their employees time and a half pay for any overtime) is an overreach of the federal government? Shouldn't that also be something that workers negotiate with their employers?   the federal government has no place and no right to mandate vacation hours.   That's not a reason -- you're simply asserting that.
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,TheDesertFox929,1 point,Tue Jan 13 22:14:53 2015 UTC,It is indeed. There's no reason to circumvent collective bargaining for political expediency.
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,Didicet,2,Tue Jan 13 22:20:59 2015 UTC,"Well, I hope I haven't come across as rude at any point as I respect your opinion very much. I simply disagree with you, however.   While I agree that government shouldn't overstep its boundaries, I believe it's necessary for the rights of workers to be protected, whether from small business or large corporations. I hate to bring up an extreme example of this, but I hope you wouldn't disagree with me when I say that I'm very glad child labor laws exist.  And believe me, I think it's important to be skeptical when government tries to increase its power (although I don't see how mandatory vacation days increases the power of the government), I trust corporations even less. We can't depend on the 'invisible hand of the free market' for everything."
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,SeptimusSette,3,Wed Jan 14 01:28:32 2015 UTC,"I feel that this bill is an over-reach of government power. Why is the federal government getting involved with something involving corporations, a state held power. I feel that this bill should be amended to only apply to federal government employees."
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,Libertarian-Party,6,Tue Jan 13 18:53:46 2015 UTC,It's about time. This bill has my full support.
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,SeptimusSette,4,Tue Jan 13 02:43:27 2015 UTC,A great piece of legislation that is long overdue. America needs some time off.
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,Smitty9913,4,Tue Jan 13 02:47:09 2015 UTC,The Green Party requested that the vote not be held yet. I think there was some miscommunication with DurianMD.

ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,risen2011,3,Wed Jan 14 23:23:54 2015 UTC,What would you change?
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,Smitty9913,2,Thu Jan 15 01:12:27 2015 UTC,At most this should only effect Federal employees. Also this is a blatant overreach of government.
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,Gohte,2,Tue Jan 13 17:31:32 2015 UTC,"SECTION 2: Let Companies henceforth allow their workers a minimum of 21 paid vacation days, on which the workers will be paid, but no work will be required. Companies must also allow their workers paid holiday days on the eleven recognized federal holidays.   So small businesses or seasonal stores which are open for maybe a month or two out of the year now have to allow their workers a minimum 21 day paid vacation? This could be easily abused by anyone in the hierarchy of the business.   SUB SECTION 1: If the list of Federal Holidays decreases, workers must be given an additional vacation day.   Along with the point I made above, this piece doesn't necessarily work out because should a Federal Holiday be taken away, adding another vacation day is adding an extension to paid vacation days.   Moreover, how would this work out should a business find itself unable to pay all of its workers who all take these paid vacations? Would the business be penalized?"
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,Smitty9913,1 point,Tue Jan 13 21:14:27 2015 UTC,This is a valid point. Maybe a minimum amount of days worked per year should be added. As to stop this sort of thing from happening.
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,Gohte,1 point,Wed Jan 14 13:37:36 2015 UTC,"So small businesses or seasonal stores which are open for maybe a month or two out of the year now have to allow their workers a minimum 21 day paid vacation?   This has been addressed in the 2nd reading, which is currently being voted on by the Green Party."
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,Smitty9913,5,Tue Jan 13 19:37:11 2015 UTC,"I object to this bill.   Firstly because it creates the possibility that all employees are given off on federal holidays.   For this Congress this may work out perfectly fine, but for hospitals, firefighters, and police officers it certainly creates problems. I for one would like to oppose the creation of anarchy on federal holidays.   But beyond even that, I do not find it necessary for the federal government to mandate a minimum number of days off. It is the job of unions and workers to secure these rights through negotiations with their employers, not to have it forced on them all by an all powerful federal entity.   This act not only supports, but actually mandates inefficiency, and I must oppose it."
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,Gohte,6,Wed Jan 14 22:29:02 2015 UTC,"Yes I will admit I am being slightly hyperbolic, as we all tend to do from time to time.  Still, if in a hospital not enough employees agree to work on Thanksgiving for example, and there is an emergency, that hospital could face serious problems.   I'm not saying they shouldn't have vacation days, I'm saying they shouldn't be federally mandated. Doing so is a massive federal overreach in an area of labor relations that should be settled by workers and management. Why three weeks? Why is that a good number?   I believe instead each sector should have their employees and employers negotiate this out to achieve the most equitable and efficient settlement instead of just arbitrarily deciding three weeks for everyone!"
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,Smitty9913,6,Thu Jan 15 23:11:09 2015 UTC,Excellent! Now the U.S can catch up to the rest of the developed world!
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,Gohte,4,Tue Jan 13 03:39:42 2015 UTC,To bad the United States is the leader of the developed World.
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,Smitty9913,2,Tue Jan 13 04:53:18 2015 UTC,In what ways?
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,Smitty9913,5,Tue Jan 13 05:05:14 2015 UTC,"What do you mean in what ways? The US has the 2nd biggest (realy biggest when you don't count China's cheeter way of counting GDP) GDP, the west is centered around it, and it's the place where very one wants to live. I would say that the U.S. Is developed, and the IMF lists the U.S. as high,y developed."
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,Smitty9913,3,Tue Jan 13 03:00:06 2015 UTC,"We also have 25% of the world's prison population despite having 5% of the total population. We spend more on healthcare than any other industrialized nation and receive less for it. 48,000,000 Americans are living in poverty and we have a constantly growing rate of wealth inequality.  It's incredibly irresponsible to dismiss progressive movements just because we have a high GDP and a high development index. We are far from being anything close to a perfect country and this kind of attitude prevents measures that will help the American people. We can't keep going on with this blind patriotism. America has problems and they need to be addressed, not cast aside because we lead the industrialized world and we think that makes us above improvement."
ModelUSGov,2s8kgo,SeptimusSette,3,Tue Jan 13 06:52:56 2015 UTC,We also have nearly 20% of the worlds Immigrants. My point is that you can't say that the U.S. Is not developed when it realy is.

We spend 50+ billion dollars to fight the ""war on drugs"" annually (http://www.drugpolicy.org/drug-war-statistics) when most of the issues we are trying to solve would be eliminated if these drugs were legal. Marijuana is one of the cartel's major products, if marijuana was legalized anyone could buy it and it wouldn't be as valuable. When alcohol was prohibited during The Prohibition, criminal enterprises came into existence to meet the demand. These enterprises were fueled by the illegality of the alcohol and when the prohibition ended these same enterprises failed to continue."

You cannot so hastily disregard our founding document while at the same time taking advantage of the rights it declares.   If you truly want to change the Constitution, propose an amendment, but do not bypass it for your pseudo-progress. That will become a slippery slope.

Yes, people made a choice to use drugs, and are largely responsible for the negative health effects of has on them (this does not, mind you, mean we shouldn't work to fight these health problems).  But the ruining of lives by the criminal justice system is another issue. The failed ""War on Drugs"" has swallowed countless lives. People of color are disproportionately jailed for drug offenses in spite of similar rates of use to whites. When these people do get out of prison, they struggle to find work with their criminal records--it's no wonder they reoffend. To systematically rob people of their socioeconomic opportunities and then complain about their lack of personal responsibility is the worst kind of infantilization."
ModelUSGov,2ryuzq,bsddc,3,Sat Jan 10 20:06:11 2015 UTC,"It is not the governments job to bail people out of their choices. Just as murders are punished for doing something society deems unsavory, so to should those that sell, spread, and perpetuate drug addiction.   We could probably get somewhere on how we sentence drug use, which I think is far to strict in this country.   But I will never support a bill that forces counties to treat drug offenders, and pays for their poor life decisions.   And since the overwhelming majority of Americans agree with keeping illicit substances illegal, my guess is that is how they feel as well. Now we could probably come to common ground on Marijuana, but putting anything else on the table prevents me from supporting the bill."
ModelUSGov,2ryuzq,adavis2014,1 point,Sat Jan 10 20:17:57 2015 UTC,"It is not the governments job to bail people out of their choices. Just as murders are punished for doing something society deems unsavory, so to should those that sell, spread, and perpetuate drug addiction.   I was talking about drug use, not dealing.  And you know what it's not the government's job to do? Prevent people from engaging in actions which do not harm others, no matter how big of a majority supports it. The government is there to prevent people from harming others, not from harming themselves."
ModelUSGov,2ryuzq,bsddc,3,Sat Jan 10 22:23:12 2015 UTC,"It does harm other's though. The cost of health care associated with these drugs is astronomical, and with this bill we are mandating county governments to pay for their drug use and addiction treatment, therefore making it every taxpayers burden to carry.   So yes, this does affect others financially, and so we are on sound ground to prohibit the use of these substances."
ModelUSGov,2ryuzq,adavis2014,2,Sun Jan 11 10:37:06 2015 UTC,"It does harm other's though. The cost of health care associated with these drugs is astronomical, and with this bill we are mandating county governments to pay for their drug use and addiction treatment, therefore making it every taxpayers burden to carry.   I can say the same thing about cigarettes, alcohol, unhealthy foods, or contact sports. The fact that an action may cause health problems for a person who takes part in that action, which may slightly raise the cost to taxpayers in the future, does not make that action worthy of a government ban.  Not to mention the fact that the current ban has (clearly) been ineffective at actually reducing rates of use. Also, the War on Drugs has been incredibly costly.  I'd rather put government funds into treatment and rehabilitation than (failed) enforcement and punishment any day."
ModelUSGov,2ryuzq,Gohte,2,Tue Jan 13 14:33:46 2015 UTC,"I think that would be a moral failing to accept defeat when combating drugs like meth and crack-cocaine.   Regardless, I do not know if we will get anywhere closer on the issue, but I really do appreciate the debate."
ModelUSGov,2ryuzq,Gohte,2,Tue Jan 13 17:05:01 2015 UTC,"I think that would be a moral failing to accept defeat when combating drugs like meth and crack-cocaine.   I don't see decriminalization as accepting defeat; I see it as a tactical change. We've seen that our current methods are costly and ineffective (not to mention racist in their application) and it's time to try something new. Decriminalization will actually respect the liberty of our citizens, and I honestly don't see how it can be less effective than the War on Drugs.   Regardless, I do not know if we will get anywhere closer on the issue, but I really do appreciate the debate.   As do I, and I hope this forum continues to provide opportunities for civil dialogue."
ModelUSGov,2ryuzq,bsddc,1 point,Tue Jan 13 17:39:27 2015 UTC,Is the cost of healthcare enough to outweigh the amount of money that will be usable after cutting funding for the drug war and for the imprisonment of non-violent drug offenders?
ModelUSGov,2ryuzq,StopItWithThat,2,Sat Jan 10 19:57:28 2015 UTC,"There are too many things cause addiction that are out of a person's control. Mental illness, socio-economic status, home issues, etc. We shouldn't toss the weakest members of our society to the dogs because they make a mistake. We need to treat drug addiction for what it is-- an illness that can be remedied- not as a felonious offense."
ModelUSGov,2ryuzq,bsddc,3,Sat Jan 10 20:13:48 2015 UTC,"I agree it should be treated, but I do not think it is the responsibility of our government to foot the bill.  We do not, and should not, pay for treatment to help quit smoking cigarettes. Doing so is far to costly, and expanding it to all addictive substances would bankrupt the county governments that this bill puts the burden on."
ModelUSGov,2ryuzq,Post-NapoleonicMan,2,Sat Jan 10 22:08:39 2015 UTC,"In Section 6: ""each county will be tasked..."" - Does that mean the intent is to have the governments of individual counties establishing the clinics? Also, the funding piece is very ambiguous. How will those departments tasked with implementation ""come up with funding"" if it's not appropriated?  I also agree with the concern expressed by u/bsddc."
ModelUSGov,2ryuzq,rangerheart0,3,Sat Jan 10 22:48:34 2015 UTC,The words unfunded mandates come to mind.
ModelUSGov,2ryuzq,Post-NapoleonicMan,1 point,Sat Jan 10 22:52:33 2015 UTC,"I tentatively support this bill, my opposition comes largely from the social background reasons for drug use, and so too does my support - I'd rather people not use these items, in an ideal world, but there is a social reason for it, and we should not criminalize this; but wonder if it would be more prudent if, in addition to Section 5 certain funds be pledged to fund resources aimed at displaying the potentially harmful effects of drug use. In a manner similar to the UK, where advertisements appear on TV displaying the negative aspects. Also I think the first clause of Section 5, Clause 1, should read:    The sale of drugs must be accompanied by a verbal and written warning of any potential negative health effects."
ModelUSGov,2ryuzq,Gohte,1 point,Sat Jan 10 23:13:17 2015 UTC,This is a good idea. While it definitely should be your choice to use or not. You should know what your getting into. That being said we really need to be careful not to treat cannabis as if it is as dangerous as crack cocaine or heroin. That sort of propaganda does no good.
ModelUSGov,2ryuzq,Post-NapoleonicMan,1 point,Sun Jan 11 00:32:09 2015 UTC,"To be sure - I think the warnings against it should at least be equal to tobacco smoking as this seems to be true. The following is taken from the American Lung Association on Marijuana:   Like tobacco smoke, marijuana smoke contains cancer-causing chemicals.  There are  33 cancer-causing chemicals contained in marijuana. Marijuana smoke also deposits tar  into the lungs. In fact, when equal amounts of marijuana and tobacco are smoked,  marijuana deposits four times as much tar into the lungs. This is because marijuana  joints are un-filtered and often more deeply inhaled than cigarettes.  Marijuana smoke is also an irritant to the lungs, and frequent marijuana smokers can  have many of the same respiratory problems experienced by people who smoke  tobacco. These include coughing and phlegm production on most days, wheezing,  bronchitis, and greater risk of lung infection, although most of these may go away  after stopping smoking marijuana. Frequent marijuana smokers also have more  healthcare visits both overall and for respiratory conditions compared to nonsmokers.  While research has not shown a clear increase in risk for lung cancer among marijuana smokers, results have been mixed for heavy, long term use.  Smoking marijuana may be associated with the formation of large air sacs in the lung,  called bullae, which can lead to shortness of breath and, if they rupture, death. Similarly,  there are reports of sudden lung collapse or air pockets forming between the lungs  among marijuana smokers.  Marijuana has many effects on the brain. It impairs short-term memory and motor coordination; slows reaction time; alters mood, judgment and decision-making; and in  some people can cause severe anxiety or loss of touch with reality. Because of these  effects, marijuana use more than doubles a driver’s risk of being in an accident.  Marijuana also affects the heart. The heart rate is raised 20-100 percent shortly  after smoking, an effect which can last up to 3 hours and put users at an increased  risk of heart attack.  Marijuana use can affect the general quality of the user’s life as well. Heavy marijuana  users generally report lower life satisfaction, poorer mental and physical health,  relationship problems and less academic and career success compared to their peers.  Marijuana use is particularly harmful to youth since the part of the brain that craves  pleasure matures earlier than the area that controls our ability to understand risks  and consequences. A national study by Monitoring the Future showed that in 2013  1.1% of 8th graders, 4.0% of 10th graders, and 6.5% of 12th graders reported  using marijuana daily.  Marijuana is highly accessible, especially to older teenagers. In 2013, 39.1% of  8th graders, 69.7% of 10th graders, and 81.4% of 12th graders reported marijuana  as being fairly easy or very easy to get. Studies show that as availability increases,  perception of harm decreases.  The perception that there is no great risk in smoking marijuana is decreasing among  youth. In 2013, 61.0% of 8th graders, 46.5% of 10th graders and 39.5% of 12th  graders said there was a great risk in smoking marijuana regularly. These numbers  had been steadily declining over the last five to eight years.  Marijuana is often thought to not be addictive. However, about 9% of those who try  marijuana will become addicted. Youth are more likely than adults to become addicted to marijuana. About 2.7 million people in the U.S. meet clinical criteria for  marijuana dependence.  THC stimulates brain cells to release the chemical dopamine, which creates a euphoric  feeling and can lead to a physical addiction. Similar to tobacco withdrawal, people trying to quit marijuana report irritability, sleeping difficulties, craving, and anxiety.  Sorry for the Text Block. As we can see, whilst it shouldn't be criminalized, as this ends up punishing certain social groups and the War on Drugs has clearly failed, it is at least as bad as tobacco in some cases and should be treated as such, I propose clear marking of the health side effects and the verbal warning. We need to stress the side-effects, we don't want a massive surge in usage to cure the social ills of the War on Drugs."

ModelUSGov,2rodgr,bsddc,1 point,Thu Jan 8 01:20:07 2015 UTC,This is why I have said that legalization should be a state issue.  This gives the fed cover until such time as they can properly address the treaty commitment.

ModelUSGov,2rodgr,bsddc,6,Thu Jan 8 01:43:53 2015 UTC,"I believe that section one of this bill is good policy, and I believe that the sponsor had great intentions, however, I must oppose section 3.   We deny children the right to vote, and those deemed mentally impaired because we  do not trust their judgement. If we are to deny voting rights to these groups we must also deny it to criminals, whose judgement I personally question more than children. This bill is allowing murders in prison to vote.   Secondly, employers and their employees operate on a contractual basis. This employee would have the legal basis to withhold important information, which is dangerous. For example, one felony is the distribution of child pornography, which is non-violent. What if they apply for a summer camp job?   This bill allows for child pornographers to hide that fact from schools or other places where children may be involved. There are other countless examples, such as tax evaders working for a Tax filing firm for example.   Others have addressed the concerns I also have with section 4, but Section 3 also holds serious ramifications.   For those reasons I must oppose this bill."
ModelUSGov,2rodgr,SeptimusSette,3,Thu Jan 8 00:41:48 2015 UTC,Reasonable.  The bill needs a reworking.
ModelUSGov,2rodgr,bsddc,2,Thu Jan 8 00:41:19 2015 UTC,"My point was we do not allow these two classes of people to vote because we do not trust their judgement. In the same way that we cannot trust a convicted felon in prison's judgement.   Now after they are released that is a different story, and I am sure we could come to a compromise on that, but while in prison felons do not have reliable access to information on elections, which is beyond the fact they have violated the social contract and therefore lose a say in our society.  Prison is a punishment, it is our society saying that actions taken were so heinous that you must forfeit your freedom, and as such their judgement, like children or the mentally impaired, is in question. I do not think allowing felons to vote while in prison is a good idea."
ModelUSGov,2rodgr,rangerheart0,6,Thu Jan 8 01:45:27 2015 UTC,"This is a fantastic law, ending the discriminatory three strike policy, and an marijuana policy which was also enforced in a racially biased way.

ModelUSGov,2rodgr,IBiteYou,6,Thu Jan 8 07:03:54 2015 UTC,"This bill allows someone convicted of perjury to hide that fact even if they are applying to be a lawyer or a Clerk of the Court. It allows child pornographers to hide that fact from potential employers including schools or summer camps. A history of fraud is hidden from investment firms when hiring a new employee.  My guess is these situations would actually be a miscarriage of justice.  I understand how this can further justice, I agree with section 1 of this bill, and I think we need to change our drug policy, but section 3 is dangerous, how would you reconcile this fact?"
ModelUSGov,2rodgr,IBiteYou,7,Thu Jan 8 07:17:06 2015 UTC,This is a good point. I like the idea of welcoming felons back to society but possibly a more specific list of crimes that are exempt from this law is necessary.

What do you think the original reasoning was behind these laws?   No convicted felon shall be denied the right to vote.   Even while they're in prison?  It would be interesting to watch a county with a large maximum security prison, and local politicians soliciting the Felon vote.  What would they promise the felons, to get their vote, one wonders?  Even at the state level, the Felon vote might be enough to tip elections.  Do we really want politicians pandering to the interests of people who are so sociopathic that society found it necessary to incarcerate them to protect itself?   No convicted nonviolent felon, save for those convicted of burglary or similar thievery, shall be compelled to reveal their felon status to any potential or actual employer.   Pedophilia is often not a violent crime - the children are sometimes willing, but unable to give legal consent.  Arson is not a violent crime.  Human smuggling is not a violent crime.  Dealing methamphetamines is not a violent crime.  Under the laws of various states, business owners can lose their business and have their property seized if someone in their employ is found engaging in these activities on premises.  As such it is necessary for employers to know if a potential or actual employee has a history of this behavior.   The recreational use, possession, transportation, and sale of cannabis shall be legal for adults 21 years of age and above, and the drug shall be removed from the Schedule I list of the Controlled Substances Act.   As others have pointed out, legalizing Marijuana violates the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.  It would be necessary for the US to withdraw from this treaty before such a law could be passed."

I may get back to the totality of the bill later, but immediately it occurs to me that this is a states' rights issue.  Voting rights are determined by the states, not by the federal government. All other expansions of the electorate have been done via Constitutional amendments and even those only prohibit the states from denying the right to vote based upon a specific criteria...i.e. age, race, sex.  Therefore, this would probably have to be a Constitutional amendment to prevent it from being a violation of state sovereignty."

I've also asked him to remove section 3, subsection B due to many concerns such as fraudsters and pedophiles being exempt from this. That part likely won't make a return unless it's heavily edited."

ModelUSGov,2rodgr,bsddc,4,Thu Jan 8 11:58:57 2015 UTC,"SECTION 3. WELCOMING NONVIOLENT FELONS BACK TO SOCIETY  B.) No convicted nonviolent felon, save for those convicted of burglary or similar thievery, shall be compelled to reveal their felon status to any potential or actual employer.   I disagree with Section 3B because, even though I applaud the sentiment that ex felons should be able to have normal jobs and careers, ALL businesses have the right to know about your criminal felony history. The bill mentions burglary or thievery, but there are so many ways that a felon's history could directly undermine the foundation of a company. For those of you arguing that it is a right of privacy, I argue that employers have the right to ask about your work history, previous employers, and even call your previous employers. Many will call past bosses for the purpose NOT of trying to eliminate or disqualify an applicant, but because they want to know the type of person the applicant is. I believe that a criminal history is absolutely within the employers right to ask for.   SECTION 4. LEGALIZATION OF CANNABIS  The recreational use, possession, transportation, and sale of cannabis shall be legal for adults 21 years of age and above, and the drug shall be removed from the Schedule I list of the Controlled Substances Act.   I agree that the drug should be removed from the Schedule 1 list of the Controlled substances act, and that the federal government should consider for all intents and purposes consider cannabis a legal substance above the federal prosecution of the government. HOWEVER, such a strong and still quite controversial statement effectively outlawing state and local enforcement of cannabis could prove disastrous. States are already slowly transitioning to allow medical marijuana dispensaries, and in come states, recreational marijuana dispensaries. The fact that the sale of cannabis is expressly legalized without any regulation or licensing whatsoever is alarming. I am against over-regulation and the stifling of entrepreneurship in general, the the absolute lack of any sort of regulation of a substance such as cannabis will essentially give complete un adulterated power to the drug cartels and gangs. Why? Because there is no infrastructure to support such a quick legalization except drug cartels, so the only entities that will have the financial ability to maintain and control such a business would be these violent cartels. Slowly allowing for states to legalize marijuana themselves and easing approved regulated businesses and dispensaries is the most wise option to combat the horrific gang violence in this country, funded almost entirely by drugs."

ModelUSGov,2rodgr,Geohump,0,Wed Jan 7 23:00:46 2015 UTC,Exactly.  We don't tolerate drunk driving anymore and marijuana is much harder to detect in drivers. There's no reason to legalize or even decriminalize something that has more harm in it than little to no benefit.
ModelUSGov,2rodgr,Danotto94,0,Wed Jan 7 23:05:39 2015 UTC,"LOL.   Sorry son, but pot damage would have to be increased by over 10,000 times as much to come anywhere near the damage done by alcohol."

ModelUSGov,2rodgr,Rabobi,5,Wed Jan 7 23:02:40 2015 UTC,"Legalizing drugs doesn't mean that society would immediately transition to an ""unresctricted lifestyle."" I'd rather not publicly discuss my usage of it, but it hasn't had any harmful or addicting effects. It takes a disciplined personality to not succumb to addictive feelings, if a person does develop them.   Of course not. No argument is going make me   This demonstrates that you're closed-minded about scientifically-backed facts. It's your responsibility to know what marijuana (and any other drug) can do to you, and it's a personal choice whether to ingest it or not. No government should have the right to decide what you can do with your body, as long as you aren't hurting or disturbed other people."

Radicalization, that leads to occurrences like these, no matter from whom and for what reason it originates, is totally unacceptable.  Taking the life on someone else for mocking your religion, your persona, or your ideas is egregious.  People in this country and various countries around the world, have a right to express themselves in any manner, no matter how offensive, how rude, or how disgusting.  At the same time, I want to address the anti-Islamic comments that I have heard from all over.  I frankly don't care what the Qur'an says.  I am not a scholar of the Qur'an and I am not qualified to dissect the Qur'an.  At the same time, I think it is only right that I issue a condemnation towards those who continually target the entire Islamic community after atrocities like these occur.  Regardless of whether these people are ""truly following their holy book"" by not acting as terrorists, to me, is personally irrelevant.  These are people, as much as you or I.  It is not fair to target their faith.  What is fair is to target any person who commits any act of unsubstantiated violence against another human being.  I think it is time for each and every human being on Earth to accept people for who they are, provided they do the same."

We must not be bullied into giving up our freedom for security. And we must not be bullied into giving up the founding principle of this country; that all men (and women) are created equal.

ModelUSGov,2rkjgu,daddysgun,4,Tue Jan 6 23:52:14 2015 UTC,"What mechanism is currently in place that would ""force"" vets to change over from their better healthcare to O-care or to the employer's plan?   Sounds to me like the bill is meant to help employers avoid the mandate rather than help vets keep better healthcare."
ModelUSGov,2rkjgu,daddysgun,3,Wed Jan 7 01:12:26 2015 UTC,There is no mechanism.  This is a proposal that simply allows businesses employing veterans (with health insurance coverage through the VA) to not count veterans in the 50+ full-time employee mandate.  It helps employers by not forcing them to pay for health insurance for the veteran employees and helps veterans by making them much more attractive to hire.
ModelUSGov,2rkjgu,JamMan35,1 point,Wed Jan 7 02:28:00 2015 UTC,"That's not what the description says.  This is what it says:   It will allow the vets if they already have better healthcare, to keep it insted of being forced to change over to the employers ""Obamacare"" or other insurence plan.    No one has explained how anybody would be ""forced"" to change healthcare options, and there is nothing in the description about making vets more attractive to hire."
ModelUSGov,2rkjgu,Smitty9913,1 point,Wed Jan 7 17:17:01 2015 UTC,"Well, if this is essentially the real-life ""Hire More Heroes Act"", it is what I explained it as.

ModelUSGov,2rkjgu,Llanganati,3,Wed Jan 7 20:07:55 2015 UTC,"In the status quo, many vets already get coverage. So the other coverage from the business doesn't actually help them, but the business still has to pay for it.   By this bill passing, businesses won't be incentivized to not hire veterans because they cost more (at no benefit to the vet)."
ModelUSGov,2rkjgu,SolidOrangeGangsta,3,Wed Jan 7 02:28:34 2015 UTC,What /u/Pluralizer said is the reason I would like this bill to be voted on.

Not that soldiers themselves have malicious reasons for joining the military -unfortunately I am sure some do, a tiny minority probably-, but the institution itself has more often than not served as a mercenary force for American and other Western economic interests."
ModelUSGov,2rkjgu,daddysgun,7,Wed Jan 7 12:18:04 2015 UTC,How dare you not consider American Service Man and women as heroes. they risk their lives defending our freedoms so you can post shit comments. You're an embarrassment.

ModelUSGov,2rkjgu,daddysgun,5,Wed Jan 7 17:19:40 2015 UTC,"Our freedoms have never been in jeopardy from any external force, only from within.   And why do you think that is? Why do you think we haven't been attacked? Countries have certainly plotted to invade us in the past, why do you assume no one would ever think about doing that now?   I assure you, it's not the left-wing's banging of anti-war drums that knock back any potential invaders."
ModelUSGov,2rkjgu,Danotto94,1 point,Wed Jan 7 20:07:11 2015 UTC,"Possibly, it could be because we have the largest military in the world. But that doesn't mean the soldiers in that military did a single thing to ""fight"" for our freedoms.  There's no reason to exaggerate their heroism anymore than there is reason to diminish their service.  They do a job, they get paid for it.  Sometimes some of them do heroic things, but they aren't automatically heroes just for serving in the military."
ModelUSGov,2rkjgu,Smitty9913,3,Wed Jan 7 20:37:00 2015 UTC,"It's silly that you think that us having a large military is what possibly keeps enemies at bay. It is what keeps them at bay.  Let me give you an example:  You're a criminal and you really want all of the money from the local shop. So, you drive down there, put on your ski-mask and walk towards the door. It's a glass door and everything inside is visible from the outside. You notice a cop is in there, gun in holster, maybe drinking a cup of coffee. Would you still want to rob that store?  I can maybe agree that the term 'hero' is a bit overused, but to say that they don't 'defend our freedoms' by merely existing in their current positions isn't true."

ModelUSGov,2rkjgu,Smitty9913,2,Wed Jan 7 21:09:47 2015 UTC,"I guess my point is that all it takes to be a ""hero"" in these terms is to fund a big, bloated military to make the rest of the world afraid to attack you.  If that's the case, I guess it's really the politicians who are the heroes because they're the ones who funded the big bloated military, which wouldn't exist if the soldiers didn't get paid."
ModelUSGov,2rkjgu,Smitty9913,3,Thu Jan 8 15:23:01 2015 UTC,"I respect soldiers which don't abuse their power. They, like us, are victims of the interests of the financial elites. In an ideal world, there would be diplomacy, as opposed to violence (and /u/daddysgun)."

ModelUSGov,2r1mab,Smitty9913,5,Fri Jan 2 01:07:13 2015 UTC,Well to be fair that is a fairly common belief among Republicans.
ModelUSGov,2r1mab,rangerheart0,2,Fri Jan 2 16:28:58 2015 UTC,Just so you know there is a difference between stupid republicans that don't think the climate is changing and smart ones.
ModelUSGov,2r1mab,Smitty9913,3,Sat Jan 3 05:30:37 2015 UTC,"Yes I understand that there is a difference between stupid republicans who say shit like ""legitimate rape"" and think that the climate is not changing at all. However the overall numbers are about 60% of republicans believe that global warming is just a natural phenomenon. In christian republican circles, it seems to be much higher (im in those circles). In the future I will keep in mind the distinction between model repubs an dems and actual repubs and dems."
ModelUSGov,2r1mab,rangerheart0,1 point,Sat Jan 3 16:19:08 2015 UTC,I wouldn't even go as far as to say theres a difference between model and actual republicans. The younger republican crowd is much more willing to listen to social issues then the older class.
ModelUSGov,2r1mab,Superyellyfish,5,Sat Jan 3 17:59:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe. I know a lot of young republicans, and generally you are correct on social issues like gay marriage, drug legalization, abortion etc. However in my experience many of them still do not hold do things like climate change. This is all anecdotal though."

ModelUSGov,2qr5cg,IBiteYou,3,Fri Jan 2 10:04:25 2015 UTC,Notice the Greens and Libertarians and the Democrats have been advertising. That is why they have the amount of members they do.

ModelUSGov,2qr5cg,cyon921,2,Sat Jan 3 04:44:18 2015 UTC,"Under 10,000 Subscriber subs only"
ModelUSGov,2qr5cg,Smitty9913,3,Sat Jan 3 04:45:48 2015 UTC,"That puts a bit of a hindrance on us.  The subreddit for Republicans has 15,000 members.  It would, however, be the appropriate place to find people who might participate."
ModelUSGov,2qr5cg,cyon921,2,Sat Jan 3 04:59:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, and the democratic party is much bigger. 50% of our party is that. Our party will never every have a chance now. Your doing this in a last ditch attempt to save this."
ModelUSGov,2qr5cg,Smitty9913,3,Tue Dec 30 00:00:07 2014 UTC,"I would argue that instead of asking to have the system changed to keep your party alive, you should work within the same confines as your opponents, and find a way to keep the Republican Party appealing."
ModelUSGov,2qr5cg,cyon921,2,Sun Jan 4 09:21:52 2015 UTC,"But yet, the system was changed for you."
ModelUSGov,2qr5cg,Smitty9913,3,Sun Jan 4 22:22:54 2015 UTC,"Hm. Good point. However, I don't think it's a bad thing to give people more choice. If more people prefer the Libertarian ideology, they should be free to choose that, no? All parties are subject to the same rules of recruitment, all parties have access to the same amount of strategies."
ModelUSGov,2qr5cg,cyon921,2,Sun Jan 4 22:31:44 2015 UTC,I just think that to keep realism something should be done to keep things even.
ModelUSGov,2qr5cg,cyon921,3,Sun Jan 4 22:39:08 2015 UTC,What you're ultimately advocating for is the removal of quality choices because you fear the unpopularity of the Republican party.
ModelUSGov,2qr5cg,Libertarian-Party,2,Sun Jan 4 22:52:03 2015 UTC,"I'm asking for realism, I fear unrealism from yours and the Green Party."
ModelUSGov,2qr5cg,LDL2,1 point,Mon Jan 5 00:17:53 2015 UTC,"I think you can argue that the creation of the Green and Libertarian Party, as well as the National Front within this subreddit removes an aspect of realism. The current U.S. government is made up mostly of Republicans and Democrats, and that's because many Americans view voting for any other party as impractical.   Greens and Libertarians have never held an office on the federal level, but now both parties have more members than the Democrats and Republicans.  Edit: Let me add, the Republican Party is quite popular, more so than the Greens and/or Libertarians have ever been. Reddit just doesn't represent that."
ModelUSGov,2qr5cg,Libertarian-Party,4,Mon Jan 5 00:47:32 2015 UTC,"So we shouldn't strive for better representation than the poor system of the American government allows? We should force people into parties that they don't wholly agree with, for the sake of being just like a government that a great deal of people take issue with? If we want this subreddit to be successful, we have to give the potential participants (redditors) the choices they want."
ModelUSGov,2qr5cg,LDL2,2,Mon Jan 5 01:19:29 2015 UTC,"You don't need to 'agree with the party' because the parties are supposed to be molded by the individuals. For example, the Republicans were a lot more libertarian-leaning, and had a few libertarian-leaning representatives before the addition of more parties.  The purpose of MUSGOV, as far as I'm aware, is to mimic the American system of government. Allowing the Greens to become the largest party in a system where they've never held a seat is a bit unrealistic, don't you think?"
ModelUSGov,2qr5cg,Libertarian-Party,3,Mon Jan 5 01:41:41 2015 UTC,"Simply mocking the system exactly, letting nothing differ, sounds incredibly boring to me. Instead, laying the same foundation and allowing it to run its course, whether its the same or different as the original, sounds.much more interesting."
ModelUSGov,2qr5cg,SeptimusSette,3,Mon Jan 5 01:52:18 2015 UTC,I would like to add that the official subreddit is on /r/ModelLibertarians .  Feel free to PM me about questions and permissions. /u/Libertarian-Party along with /u/lort683 are the moderators.

ModelUSGov,2qr5cg,Libertarian-Party,3,Thu Mar 5 00:20:30 2015 UTC,What do did is very unsavory. It seems like you were only a member member of our party to be elected. I'm sure you doing this will only make it harder for you to work with us in the long run. Anyways good luck in the new party.
ModelUSGov,2qr5cg,OrtyBortorty,1 point,Thu Mar 5 01:25:10 2015 UTC,This is untrue. I switched parties because I can no longer stand a large sum of the current Republicans in my state. Thank you for the support though.
ModelUSGov,2qr5cg,Libertarian-Party,4,Thu Mar 5 02:13:45 2015 UTC,"While it is your choice, this is a terrible argument. The Republican Party in /r/ModelUSGov is not the same as the Republican Party in real life, and as a Senator, you could vote how you wanted regardless. There is absolutely 0 reason you should be switching. Your platform is almost identical to a Conservative Republicans' platform, and no, your views did not pull a 180 overnight. I have a feeling there's some deception going on here.  I'm disappointed that we so quickly accepted you into the Party, only to have you stab us in the back and steal a seat  I'm surprised this is even allowed by the rules. I wonder what would stop a member of the Democrats from joining the Greens, winning a Senatorial seat, and then - almost immediately - defecting. Probably nothing, eh?  While I'm here: /u/Rorytime - Could you remove my flair please? Danke. I've resigned as Chairman and as Senator."
ModelUSGov,2qr5cg,JustRedditCRG,2,Thu Mar 5 04:55:33 2015 UTC,"He has not been ignogerated yet, and we can just declair the ekection null. I know we can do that If you want."

It's that a few days ago, you were LITERALLY a religious, right-wing, conservative Republican.  A few DAYS ago.  Once you won the Senate special election... you said, ""Guise, I'm a Libertarian now, please don't think I'm a traitor.""  You joined the subreddit as a conservative Republican.  If this happened in ANY of the parties, it would be a bit of scandal.  You should have RESIGNED.  You should have said, ""I know you guys wanted to elect a Republican Senator to replace the one you lost and that isn't me ... so I resign.""  Instead, you said, ""I have this change of heart, but I'm totally not stepping down as a Senator.  I get to keep my seat""."

In fact, you wanted mandatory Christian prayer in the public schools ... and I told you I would not vote for that.  You wanted every drug banned including medical marijuana.  Now you have done a complete switcheroo.  You want ""In God We Trust"" removed from the money.  You say you are now ok with legal weed.  That just does not happen in a week.

France is refusing to sign it, and it's a point of controversy in the Model House of Commons. I would advise against fast tracking it until we know better how the UK, one of our closest allies will respond to the negotiations."
ModelUSGov,2p9p1e,bsddc,1 point,Sun Dec 14 19:29:25 2014 UTC,"Fast tracking TTIP means that the Congress will not be able to amend the deal when it is concluded, which provides for clarity when negotiating a deal. A major concern in the negotiations right now is the fact that any treaty signed by the President could be changed line item by line item, which is leading to concerns as well.   This bill is not saying that we must adopt TTIP immediately or that the deal is good or bad, what it is doing is giving the President the authority to negotiate a deal in good faith.   The problem this bill seeks to address isn't TTIP itself, instead, how TTIP is negotiated. The concerns over negotiations are why you advise against the bill, but it is that very issue this bill seeks to address."
ModelUSGov,2p9p1e,bsddc,1 point,Sun Dec 14 19:40:15 2014 UTC,Such amendments by congress could be important depending on how the negotiations fall.
ModelUSGov,2p9p1e,bsddc,1 point,Sun Dec 14 19:47:00 2014 UTC,"Yes, but the problem is they torpedo negotiations, and inherently limit the Presidents negotiation ability.  I trust President /u/Pluralizer to create a fair trade deal.   But if that is you primary concern, I would like to remind you that this is the practice the U.S. congress has pursued for the last 30 years."
ModelUSGov,2p9p1e,bsddc,1 point,Sun Dec 14 19:54:51 2014 UTC,"I'm admittedly uncomfortable putting that much power into the hands of one person, even though I believe that the president has the best of intentions and could handle the negotiations well, I'm opposed to putting this much power in the president's hands.   I'm honestly on the fence with this bill."
ModelUSGov,2p9p1e,bsddc,2,Mon Dec 15 06:28:45 2014 UTC,"That is a legitimate concern, however; remember that Congress has the ability to vote against the final agreement, so if there is something incredibly outrageous it can still be turned down, it isn't as if the deal is automatically adopted when the President signs it."
ModelUSGov,2p9p1e,bsddc,4,Mon Dec 15 15:37:03 2014 UTC,"As I look more and more into TTIP, I grow more and more concerned.  What this trade agreement seems to be is more than a trade agreement, but an assault on the sovereignty of member nations by transnational corporate interests.  Parts of TTIP, such as the ISDS (investor-state dispute settlement) that allow businesses to sue governments for what they see as damages to profit, whether such damages are incurred by regulations or the like is incredibly concerning to me, and should be concerning to my fellow Americans.  Echoing /r/DurianMD, I know our friends from across the pond have taken a strong stance against this measure for the same reasons, so fast-tracking this measure, to me, is a bit questionable.  I would appreciate your input, /r/bsddc, as to why I and my party have not to worry about what I see as an attack on US sovereignty.  EDIT: I read a little more through the proposal and I am suddenly put under the impression that this does not actually fast-track TTIP, but gives me and other executive officials the authority to negotiate the terms and conditions of such an agreement.  My question: who am I negotiating with?"
ModelUSGov,2p9p1e,bsddc,2,Sun Dec 14 19:41:38 2014 UTC,"Mr. President, I do not plan to debate the merits of TTIP, although the proposed deal would greatly improve the U.S. economy.   What this bill proposes to do is empower you with trade promotion authority. Without this power you are not able to negotiate a deal in good faith, as Congress would be able to amend every line-item on a trade deal.   Mr. President, this bill isn't about the specific parts of TTIP, what this bill does is entrusts you to negotiate without the threat of Congressional amendment from screwing up negotiations.   So if ISDS is the concern you have with the negotiations, you can remove them, that is your power as the negotiator, not the Congress.  This bill lets you better negotiate a deal, nothing else, and guarantees only an up or down vote one you have signed a deal.   That is why I believe this bill to be bi-partisan, it is giving you the authority you need to negotiate the deal. If you have concerns over the loss of sovereignty to ISDS address them in negotiations, which would be more effective if the Congress grants you trade promotion authority.   Again Mr. President, fast tracking is not a blind approval of a deal, it is empowering the President to better negotiate on behalf of the United States.  In a deal that has the potential to create so much growth it is worth negotiating, and that is why I urge you to support Congress giving you trade promoting authority."
ModelUSGov,2p9p1e,Smitty9913,2,Sun Dec 14 19:51:05 2014 UTC,"And I apologize for initially misunderstanding the actual goal of the bill, but I must admit I am curious, as my edit points out, as to who I would be negotiating with."
ModelUSGov,2p9p1e,bsddc,2,Sun Dec 14 19:53:47 2014 UTC,"No worries Mr. President, you would be negotiating with the current TTIP negotiators. This bill would simply mean that any deal you make with our European Partners would not be subject to line by line amendment by the Congress.   This prevents the Congress from insisting on something like ISDS for example by amendment, which makes your negotiations all the more effective because other nations have the guarantee that any deal you sign is the deal the U.S. would accept."
ModelUSGov,2p9p1e,Morgsie,2,Sun Dec 14 19:58:33 2014 UTC,"My question is though, not to break the simulation, but who are the current TTIP negotiators?  We don't have other nations with whom I could make a deal with.  Your proposal seems alright, but doesn't seem very practical."
ModelUSGov,2p9p1e,Smitty9913,2,Sun Dec 14 20:01:25 2014 UTC,"Right now TTIP is the advisory group phase, where authorities from the EU and the US are meeting to craft the outline for the deal, but they have been hung up because the U.S. negotiators do not have the trade promotion authority regularly extended to them, which this bill does in section 3.   Once the initial framework is established TTIP will move onto substantive negotiations."
ModelUSGov,2p9p1e,Morgsie,2,Sun Dec 14 20:05:09 2014 UTC,"So, from a reddit standpoint, there is an advisory group phase that I will actually be able to negotiate with if this bill is passed?  I am curious who this would include considering the United Kingdom has taken a stance against it and I am not familiar with any other model governments."
ModelUSGov,2p9p1e,bsddc,2,Sun Dec 14 20:11:30 2014 UTC,"I think noted above we are currently not doing this is the same universe as MHOC.   But again beyond that, the current negotiations aren't taking place with members of the EU as of now, only the EU officials, after which the negotiations will be expanded.   Beyond the opposition though to ISDS, the free trade component is something that both Germany and the US populace support. And once granted trade promotion authority that is the direction you can steer the negotiations."
ModelUSGov,2p9p1e,Morgsie,1 point,Sun Dec 14 20:17:27 2014 UTC,"So is there a Model European Union or something of the sorts?  I am just genuinely confused since we have no other nations in our own universe.  I don't object to this proposal, but I think there is something that I am just not grasping here."
ModelUSGov,2p9p1e,bsddc,2,Sun Dec 14 20:23:07 2014 UTC,"No, I don't think so...   I mean, I proposed the bill because I think the President should have trade promotion authority. Whether or not a deal is made is a moot point for me personally (although I would like one :D). I mean this is all a model government right? So everything we do is moot."

I have watched the last two bills and their debate, and I felt like what we needed was a bi-partisan bill that we can all get behind.   Mr. Speaker, what I am proposing is the authorization of trade promotion authority for President Pluralizer to better negotiate the Trans Atlantic Trade and Partnership Act.   This trade partnership would link 29 countries, the US and the EU Member States, and create 119 billion dollars of exports from the United States, not to mention the nearly 200 billion dollars in increased investment from Europe! This increased investment and trade would create an estimated 750,000 new and long lasting jobs.   To abate fears of jobs flowing over to Europe, I would like to remind all congresspeople that European wages are, in general, higher than in the United States, not to mention the U.S. business climate is much more attractive now compared to Europe.   Overall, this bill creates wealth, jobs, growth, and investment without any measurable cost to the American people.   I urge your support and look forward to the debate!"

ModelUSGov,2p9p1e,bsddc,2,Mon Dec 15 04:52:15 2014 UTC,From what I know about the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership also known as TTIP is that it is still being negotiated and once negotiations are complete then it goes through ratification ratification.   I know a bit more from a European perspective  but I want to ask what is the American perspective?
ModelUSGov,2p9p1e,IBiteYou,1 point,Mon Dec 15 16:11:50 2014 UTC,"It is the same process, but for trade deals in the US the Congress guarantees an up or down vote on the final package without the possibility for debate delay, this is called trade promotion authority.   This bill doesn't really deal with TTIP specifics, but instead grants the President that trade promotion authority, which is commonplace in trade negotiations, but hasn't been extended past 2012."

There was a Bipartisan RL proposal from Senator Max Baucus and Congressman Dave camp entitled the Congressional Trade Priorities Act and Congressman sander Levin is working on alternative proposals.

I will definitely read through it again as the issue has sort of brought back my interest.   I didn't include TPP in the deal, as I figured that the democratic support would be lacking for the deal, but TTIP has generally been regarded as positive in both U.S. parties, with concerns about the ISDS mechanism of course.   Thanks again!"
ModelUSGov,2p9p1e,bsddc,2,Tue Dec 16 06:34:32 2014 UTC,I believe that our president will provide for the concerns of our workers and assure that any trade deal the US agrees to will be both economically advantageous to the US and morally acceptable. That being said I will be supporting this bill.

ModelUSGov,2p7ngi,RoryTime,6,Tue Dec 16 00:11:40 2014 UTC,"I'm sorry, but there is a point where someone being bigoted and attacking people for their sexuality crosses a line.... just like on MHoC where someone is likely to be punished for bigoted comments they made on skype, people deserve to know the type of person they would be voting for, and if they want to vote for someone who is bigoted and tells people they are ""self hating hetros"""
ModelUSGov,2p7ngi,demon4372,3,Tue Dec 16 00:33:41 2014 UTC,"I agree, in the House Rules, specifically rule 17, all maters before the House must be substantially about the question posed to the House. The question being whether or not /u/LookingForWizard is qualified to hold a Supreme Court Seat in the U.S., matters regarding other deliberative bodies, including but not being limited to the Senate are prohibited from the House floor.   As such I believe that members of this body engaging in such manners are out of order at this time."
ModelUSGov,2p7ngi,bsddc,2,Tue Dec 16 02:02:37 2014 UTC,"I think it is relevant that people should know that their candidate is a bigot who tells people they need to prove they are bisexual, and attempts smear campaigns against other people outside of ""the game""."
ModelUSGov,2p7ngi,demon4372,1 point,Tue Dec 16 09:40:42 2014 UTC,Do you think it is acceptable that someone who has targeted someone should be a Supreme Court Justice?   And how I conduct my business as Speaker of the House is not relevant
ModelUSGov,2p7ngi,LookingForWizard,3,Tue Dec 16 00:13:14 2014 UTC,"I am pursuing a career in law.  I am Conservative minister for equalities and would want to ensure that the principle of equality is adhered to.  Politically I am constitutionalist, and would uphold the amendments. I agree that there is necessity for change, and am not really as much a hard constitutionalist as Scalia--but the first and second amendments are cornerstones of a liberal republic and must be upheld.  I support individual natural rights above all else, these are the rights that are supported in the constitution. I think people see the idea of a 'freeman on the land' as a rather backwards concept, but in securing liberty we should follow the constitution.  I am generally supportive of states rights constitutionally, but generally I am rather 'big government' and would prefer a pragmatic and loose interpretation of the constitution ceding to what congress deems 'necessary and proper'.   I believe that abortion should remain available in cases of rape, maternal life, mental health or fetal defects but support the right to states determining the legality of abortion on request. The federal government cannot effectively legislate the morality of the entire US, much less on such a contentious issue. The federal government needs to make Partial Birth and Late Term abortions illegal. A pro-choice position does not entail defence of extreme practises, especially considering these practises are only permitted due to the politicisation of abortion at a federal level with the belief that any limits on abortion practises will give greater ground to a pro-life position.  I am fairly opposed to judicial activism (which I believe Ginsberg and Scalia to be most guilty of), and would pursue constitutional principles rather than ones based off of feeling or personal belief."

ModelUSGov,2p7ngi,demon4372,2,Tue Dec 16 04:51:13 2014 UTC,I have heard numerous concerns about the Candidate in question having views similar to Joseph McCarthy so my question is will the Candidate not let these views impact his role or will he let his views affect his role?
ModelUSGov,2p7ngi,LookingForWizard,3,Mon Dec 15 20:30:04 2014 UTC,"What does the candidate think about the accusations that he called bisexuals ""self hating hetros"" unless they ""proved"" that they are bisexual?"
ModelUSGov,2p7ngi,demon4372,5,Mon Dec 15 23:36:48 2014 UTC,"As somebody of the Skype chat, you know full well that what you are saying is false. Fortunately, putting quotation marks around something doesn't make it true! Seemingly Morgsie and Demon4372 are trying to turn this into a show trial led by the MHoC Liberal Democrats.   If any of the more grown-up Democrats would like to ask questions about policy, I would be prepared to answer."

ModelUSGov,2p7ngi,SolidOrangeGangsta,2,Thu Dec 18 22:26:23 2014 UTC,In the last few hours /u/LookingForWizard was banned from /r/MHOC for conducting a smear campaign by uploading and sharing a poster that contained someone's photo and personal information   The Confirmation Vote will take place as normal but I will reject this confirmation
ModelUSGov,2p7ngi,Smitty9913,2,Tue Dec 16 00:09:20 2014 UTC,"Excuse me but /r/MHOC is different than /r/ModelUSGov. He should be allowed to state is case and then allow us to vote on him, without having one man decide his fate for something he said on a different subreddit. It sounds a little unfair to me."
ModelUSGov,2p7ngi,Smitty9913,3,Wed Dec 17 22:03:09 2014 UTC,Do you want someone who has said that people should prove their sexuality and has views akin to Joseph McCarthy to be a Supreme Court Justice?
ModelUSGov,2p7ngi,SolidOrangeGangsta,1 point,Wed Dec 17 22:04:19 2014 UTC,"Of course not. However, I have no proof that he said that other than a few disgruntled redditors. If I could get evidence of what he said, I would vote against him. However, this is a model of the United States Government and therefore, he should have his hearing, be voted on and if he is confirmed... so be it."
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,bsddc,5,Sat Dec 13 15:24:12 2014 UTC,"I think one of the things we can do is hold members to the decorum rules of the House. All debate on bills is to be about the question, not personally directed. I believe the Speaker /u/Morgsie should enforce this rule in debates and remove any comments that are non-substantive and in violation of the decorum rule. Members who excessively violate the rule should be subject to Congressional censure."
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,Morgsie,2,Tue Dec 16 02:07:02 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately I cannot remove comments as I am not a Mod, that being said I am happy to work with /u/lort683 and other Mods regarding decorum"
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,Smitty9913,7,Tue Dec 16 06:32:57 2014 UTC,"I can't find the point to even make legislation regarding anything as it won't be passed. Also, most of the representatives are not active at all. I even made a post on our page and it was down voted by the reprosentitives. Also finals are coming up for a lot of people so I expect the next week won't be active, and the week after new years to be less active."
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,InfernoPlato,3,Sat Dec 13 22:33:06 2014 UTC,Where is this post? The last topic you created was 12 days ago and unfortunately we haven't heard anything else about the thing you was working on.   Representatives aren't active at the moment because they feel the thing is pointless. Lort will be addressing this in the future so this will stop being a problem.  The way to combat inactivity and gain more activity in the Republican party is to create some bills and get discussion thriving. By creating bills (they don't even have to be big bills) you are give representatives a reason to come back.
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,Smitty9913,2,Sun Dec 14 00:10:32 2014 UTC,"The post is on the republican congress page (which is for members of the Republican Party that were elected). Even if I create bills the democrats will veto are not pass them, so there's no point in making them. I don't see this subreddit working out for much longer."
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,InfernoPlato,3,Sun Dec 14 01:01:19 2014 UTC,"See, that's where I see the problem with activity within the Republican party. Right there. Many people who weren't elected (or didn't want to be elected) still have a mild interest in seeing the party succeed and want to help with bill discussions.  If you're intent on not reaching out to your grass root supporters, how can we help you? We can help you succeed if you let us - we're part of the /r/MHOC after all, we know how to strike a balance between the Democrats and us. We have ideas which can be applied to the US.  In regards to President /u/Pluralizer's veto.  Lort is at the moment devising a solution to deal with this. As soon as the three parties are equally balanced, then the Democrats won't veto bills. They is no need to lose faith."
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,Smitty9913,3,Sun Dec 14 01:06:31 2014 UTC,"I have reached out to the members of the party, and I have written an bill. No one else had written anything besides me. I have countinly asked the other reps for their advice but they don't respond to me. And as I now have finials I won't have time to create any new bills. I'm curently writing a bill involving a huge specterm of ideas and it's taken me a week so far. If you have any ideas on bills then by all means please tell me. I'm also tomorrow going to be making a post of the modle republicans page about each representative and how many times they have voted and for what. I don't know what else I can do at the moment."
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,IBiteYou,2,Sun Dec 14 02:07:23 2014 UTC,I'm curently writing a bill involving a huge specterm of ideas and it's taken me a week so far.    Why don't you post a brief outline of this bill on ModelRepublicans?
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,Morgsie,3,Mon Dec 15 21:29:53 2014 UTC,"There are some interesting ideas in this but the one thing that was missing was communication. We need to improve communication not just amongst moderators but between Mod's and me and between Mod's and parties.   Committees have caught my eye but we need to increase the number of Congressmen (i am not advocating the 435 Members of the House) before we discuss Committees   My door is open, just send me a PM"
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,bsddc,2,Sat Dec 13 23:53:05 2014 UTC,"I agree, committees could be interesting once we get large enough!"
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,Morgsie,2,Tue Dec 16 02:08:07 2014 UTC,"I was looking at RL Committees the other day and I am confused by 3:  Appropriations, Budget and Ways and Means. Can someone explain them please?"
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,bsddc,2,Tue Dec 16 06:22:52 2014 UTC,"Yeah no problem!   Budget generally creates and adopts the general federal budget bill, which is a lengthy process.   Appropriations is the committee designed to actually appropriate funding within the expenditure set by the budget resolution.   Finally, ways and means is the committee concerned with raising revenue within the set budget guidelines, basically the tax committee.  So the budget committee sets the budget, appropriations spends the money, and ways and means raises the money.   Hope this helped!"
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,SeptimusSette,3,Tue Dec 16 06:38:20 2014 UTC,"You could place a restriction on which subreddits the Democrats are allowed to advertise in. While they may think this is rigging the electorate or what have you, in order to have a proper model US government, you need balance."
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,Yosoff,2,Sun Dec 14 01:30:02 2014 UTC,"I think that you really have to allow third parties to make this interesting. The only other way seems to be having a large equally sized group of Republicans and Democrats. While I think it makes the subreddit less realistic, giving Libertarians, Greens, Moderates, and Socialists a voice will probably allow the sub to grow and be more interesting overall. A Coalition of Parties must be able to overcome the majority party for this sub to be interesting and enjoyable. Currently this is impossible, and that makes me uninterested in becoming involved, because if I pretend to be a Democrat, I'll win, and if I pretend to be a Republican, I'll lose."
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,Didicet,3,Mon Dec 29 22:15:41 2014 UTC,"This experiment died when the first bill out of the gate was vetoed.  Starting out with a popular bipartisan bill was a great idea, it would have set a positive tone of cooperation for the entire project.  Instead we got a crystal clear message that only a left-wing agenda will be allowed.  Even if we somewhat offset the inherent reddit bias, Republicans will always be in the minority with no true power.  A filibuster would be nice, but that relegates the Republicans to a permanent roll of obstructionism.  Who wants to spend their time doing that?  A spirit of bipartisanship was the only hope this project had and that's gone now.  At this point why have Republicans at all?  Just run this as a model of the Democratic Party."
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,IBiteYou,1 point,Sat Dec 13 23:30:52 2014 UTC,We're aware of the fact there is an issue. We're trying to address it not restate it.

Real-life Republicans control 57% of the House (post-2014 elections), Model Democrats control 60%.  Largest real-life majority ever was 68% Democrat.  Yes, how terrible of a situation your party has in this simulation."
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,demon4372,4,Sun Dec 14 04:20:15 2014 UTC,That's only because there are 15 seats. When/if that is expanded the Democrats will easily have a much higher majority.
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,Didicet,1 point,Sun Dec 14 05:56:24 2014 UTC,"Curious as to what makes you say Democrats will have a ""much higher majority"" if that is expanded."
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,InfernoPlato,5,Sun Dec 14 06:10:10 2014 UTC,"Since you have more members than we do, it's safe to assume you have more active members than we do as well. If both Republican and Democrat membership activity levels stay the same, but the amount of seats available increases, it's likely your party will be able to put more representatives in the House."
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,tyroncs,1 point,Sun Dec 14 06:36:52 2014 UTC,"We've always had more members, appealed to outside subreddits for votes, and we only won 60% of the seats.  I feel your party has more active members as of now and that you would win more seats."
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,Mgreen19295,0,Sun Dec 14 07:04:50 2014 UTC,"There was a SINGLE Democratic vote for the pipeline bill, the same person who then voted AGAINST overturning the veto. Those are not characteristics of a bipartisan bill."

ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,Mgreen19295,4,Sun Dec 14 01:31:06 2014 UTC,"It seems, however, that Smitty listened to Democrat concerns while writing the bill and he amended the bill to address those."
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,LordoftheWoods,2,Mon Dec 15 20:23:32 2014 UTC,"I agree that we should give the Republicans a fair shot, it's not very fair for them to have to compete in a biased environment with no help. To be honest, I feel that we Democrats have largely ignored the Republicans simply because we can get away with it under the current system. I can easily see how this project of ours can become irrelevant real quick when you cannot get anything done, compromise or otherwise."
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,Morgsie,4,Sat Dec 13 22:42:27 2014 UTC,"The first issue is the liberal bias of reddit. To our lovely friends in the GOP, I would say this; you should not have come into this without expecting there be to be a liberal bias. However, it is imperative we curb it a little bit, perhaps by adding filibuster in somehow or tweaking with the electoral system. As with everything stated here, I would love some suggestions on this.   You shouldn't be trying to ""fix"" the bias' of the electorate.... if the voters are democrats, then the government should be democrats.... honestly its tough luck to conservatives, you've just got to work harder, blaming it on the ""liberal bias"" just isnt good enough."
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,bsddc,10,Sat Dec 13 15:39:09 2014 UTC,"Unless we want /r/ModelUSGov to die, yes, we have to address the inherent liberal bias somehow."
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,IBiteYou,6,Sat Dec 13 19:10:03 2014 UTC,"This is supposed to be a model of the US though... and we should be trying to represent this by making sure that there are both Democrats and Republicans have an equal chance at being in power. Is it fair that Republicans should have to work harder than the Democrats for the same result just because of where the model US Gov is located? It's not.  By changing the system, it would ensure that Democrats and Republicans would have to work EQUALLY hard to get into power. That would make it much more interesting."
ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,IBiteYou,1 point,Sat Dec 13 18:18:08 2014 UTC,"The next issue is general activity. I believe that the more bills are submitted, the more active we will become. In the beginning of the /r/MHoC, very few bills were submitted and it was rather inactive. As more was submitted and more was added, the subreddit exploded.   The 'explosion' in activity coincided with the introduction of new parties, which obviously cannot happen here"

ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,IBiteYou,1 point,Thu Dec 18 23:40:22 2014 UTC,I think that the addition of more parties would liven this subreddit up. Most of the problems seem to be caused by a lack of diversity.

ModelUSGov,2p6dfy,IBiteYou,1 point,Sat Dec 20 17:58:27 2014 UTC,I really think that adjusting for the liberal bias of reddit isnt a good idea. This is a model us gov. Not the real one. Democracy as you say should dictate the political leaning of this model government. Remember just as in real life it is the participants that have a say in democracy.   I think it would be interesting to see infighting  in a dem super majority with several outlying  parties who form coalitions  to get things passed.   This is a simulation  not the real thing. Which means we have to work with whoever is participating.

I even heavily changed B001 to suit your party's needs yet you announced that before the bill was even voted on, that you would veto. Your party has flat out stated after I asked about things ""I'm surprised that you said this, but I'm not changing the bill at all""."
ModelUSGov,2otjfn,Smitty9913,0,Wed Dec 10 23:45:46 2014 UTC,"You didn't change the bill to suit our needs; you changed it to make it a formidable proposal. Building on Native lands and holding TransCanada responsible shouldn't be party-line positions.  Furthermore, you only reached out to me in the sense that you asked what I thought of the bill.  You never proposed anymore revisions.  Perhaps if you would've added green subsidies to offset the impact, we could've done business, but you didn't.  Also, /r/DurianMD is the author of the bill and that was his decision not to alter it, although I wouldn't have backed the extreme revisions you proposed."
ModelUSGov,2otjfn,Smitty9913,5,Thu Dec 11 00:15:03 2014 UTC,"I didn't change the bill to suit your needs? I changed 8 things for your party. After changing that you still said that no matter what you would veto it. The bill was about pipelines not green energy. The public supports the bill but you've shown that your party does not care what the people think. Overall, your party has shown that you won't change anything but you won't negotiate ever."
ModelUSGov,2otjfn,Libertarian-Party,-1,Thu Dec 11 00:48:24 2014 UTC,"Actually, no, you didn't.  You consulted one Democrat and made changes that should be considered nonpartisan. So much bipartisanship there.  You said yourself ""Why not do both [Keystone & green energies], it could create 84,000 jobs"", so don't act like since that wasn't the focus of the bill that you were totally opposed.

As in workers have the right to stay independent? Currently i believe 12 states in the US (in rl) have some version of this law that forces or coerces workers into joining a union.

ModelUSGov,2oeaqw,Smitty9913,3,Sat Dec 6 00:59:20 2014 UTC,So you won't change it at all? Is this what your party is going to do? Shove bills which the American people don't even want?
ModelUSGov,2oeaqw,Smitty9913,3,Sat Dec 6 01:11:06 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure what laws you're referring to by non discrimination laws, but I was under the perception that some of the big ones such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were quite popular. Additionally, polling shows that most Americans support not only minimum wage laws, but also raising it. So either, you're incredibly hypocritical in your advocacy and appeals towards populism, or you're giving a thinly veiled attempt to sabotage this bill by drawing opposition from the left on top of the opposition I'm predicting from the right."

ModelUSGov,2oeaqw,TheDesertFox929,2,Sat Dec 6 04:12:28 2014 UTC,"Its how the U.S. system is, love it or hate it I don't want it to change. It's not realilistic and us Republicans would when because all of the dems would be split up."
ModelUSGov,2oeaqw,Smitty9913,3,Sat Dec 6 04:16:10 2014 UTC,Should people be forced to have their labor exploited or face destitution?
ModelUSGov,2oeaqw,Mgreen19295,2,Sat Dec 6 16:52:06 2014 UTC,"No, I never said that either did I?"
ModelUSGov,2oeaqw,Smitty9913,4,Sat Dec 6 18:02:19 2014 UTC,This would make the U.S. more free   Because working for 3 dollars an hour really makes me feel independent and free.
ModelUSGov,2oeaqw,Mgreen19295,2,Sat Dec 6 02:37:34 2014 UTC,Why would you agree to work for 3 dollars a hour?
ModelUSGov,2oeaqw,Didicet,5,Sat Dec 6 03:53:37 2014 UTC,"I don't know, why don't you ask sweatshop workers in Bangladesh."
ModelUSGov,2oeaqw,Smitty9913,2,Sat Dec 6 12:29:22 2014 UTC,They work without unions. That's why I want it added to this bill.
ModelUSGov,2oeaqw,aaron289,2,Sat Dec 6 17:59:43 2014 UTC,"Those in developing nations who work in sweatshops do so because their alternative is worse. You can either till a field for subsistence, or work in a sweatshop. The latter may be horrendous by our standards in the West, but relatively speaking, its better than what they were doing before."
ModelUSGov,2oeaqw,Smitty9913,2,Sat Dec 6 21:26:39 2014 UTC,"I think that's rather the problem, don't you?"
ModelUSGov,2oeaqw,aaron289,1 point,Sat Dec 6 20:24:50 2014 UTC,"Then give me an answer,  how would I not be fired?"
ModelUSGov,2oeaqw,Smitty9913,1 point,Sat Dec 6 22:50:14 2014 UTC,Perhaps we should craft a bi-partisan bill to address that?
ModelUSGov,2oeaqw,aaron289,2,Tue Dec 9 09:45:39 2014 UTC,The destruction of minimum wage and the allowing of active discrimination is hardly a compromise.
ModelUSGov,2oeaqw,Nivmilk,2,Sat Dec 6 01:32:34 2014 UTC,"This is making the truth come out, you should not be forced to serve, hire, or pay anyone a certin amount of money."
ModelUSGov,2oeaqw,aaron289,4,Sat Dec 6 01:41:30 2014 UTC,"So what if I decided I wanted a new home but I thought paying for it would lessen my freedom, so I just moved in? Would it be ok for the police to come into my new home, on private property, and threaten me with guns until I either paid or left? Doesn't that mean that theft is in fact legal, since no one can be forced to pay anyone else any amount of money? That sounds dangerously like communism to me. How do the American people know you won't sacrifice their prosperity and security for your wildly permissive ideas of freedom when you make rash statements like that? Perhaps more importantly, how would your donors feel about the implications of those statements?"
ModelUSGov,2oeaqw,Llanganati,2,Sat Dec 6 03:18:42 2014 UTC,What? I'm saying is that you should not be forced to pay a person a set amount per hour. You should talk it out between the employ and the employer. Your whole house thing and police thing had nothing to do with my ideas so I will not comment on them. And I have no donors.
ModelUSGov,2oeaqw,aaron289,4,Sat Dec 6 03:58:14 2014 UTC,"you should not be forced to serve, hire, or pay anyone a certin amount of money.   I know you were talking about labor costs, but labor costs are just the price for labor. If you don't think the government should step in to force employers to pay the price labor demands, then how is it reasonable to say that the government should step in to force consumers to pay what sellers demand (by preventing theft even if the price is too high for the market to bear)?   In both cases, the government must step in to ensure that the system functions smoothly and sellers get a fair price. Otherwise, employers will steal wages from their employees and employees will steal products from their employers. That constitutes a major distortion of the price mechanism.  Edit: You should trust me, I'm an economist."
ModelUSGov,2oeaqw,Llanganati,2,Sat Dec 6 04:50:02 2014 UTC,The goverment should almost be non existent in the economy. The evonomy should set the price it's self.
ModelUSGov,2oeaqw,aaron289,3,Sat Dec 6 04:53:36 2014 UTC,"Oh right, government shouldn't bother the Waltons or George Soros, it should shoot black people for selling loosies. Nothing says freedom like ungodly amounts of money and politically repressing the poor. Maybe the leader of the Part of Family/Christian Values should read his Bible again. Perhaps Matthew 19:24:   And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.   Perhaps you'll recall that greed is a cardinal sin.  Although, given your spelling, perhaps you just never got past page one. Reading sure is hard, and the Bible's a big book, even if it is the foundation of your party's moral universe.  Or perhaps Adam Smith is more your style?   This disposition to admire, and almost to worship, the rich and powerful, and to despise or, at least, neglect persons of poor and mean conditions, though necessary both to establish and to maintain the distinction of ranks and the order of society, is, at the same time, the great and most universal cause of the corruption of our moral sentiments   Or,    When the happiness or misery of others depends in any respect upon our conduct, we dare not, as self–love might suggest to us, prefer the interest of one to that of many. The man within immediately calls to us, that we value ourselves too much and other people too little, and that, by doing so, we render ourselves the proper object of the contempt and indignation of our brethren.   And we may as well end with this:   The man of system, on the contrary, is apt to be very wise in his own conceit; and is often so enamoured with the supposed beauty of his own ideal plan of government, that he cannot suffer the smallest deviation from any part of it. He goes on to establish it completely and in all its parts, without any regard either to the great interests, or to the strong prejudices which may oppose it."

If you say there should be no non-discrimination laws or minimum wage laws, then whats keeping you from saying, on the basis of The govt. that child labor laws are unfair and should be repealed?"
ModelUSGov,2oeaqw,Smitty9913,2,Sat Dec 6 17:10:56 2014 UTC,"Edit: You should trust me, I'm an economist.   No, you're not. You're a UC Berkeley student. You also only graduated high school about a year ago."

ModelUSGov,2o749u,Smitty9913,4,Wed Dec 3 23:17:05 2014 UTC,They should of voted the 1st time. One of them (who is a communist) thinks that we should just take seize all oil companys and shut them down today. How can someone even think that is remotely possable?

The democrats hold the majority of the house, so no issues would be faced when passing environmental regulations to help with our reliance on oil. All that happened today is a lot of pollution from inefficient oil transport, and a huge hit to our economy from the lowered oil supply without any sort of drop in our oil consumption, hurting other industries."

ModelUSGov,2o6m6q,Morgsie,3,Wed Dec 3 19:46:21 2014 UTC,"Thank you.  I sought nomination to the court because I wanted to see this project succeed, and I believe I am more suited to the judicial role than to either legislative or executive.  I seek truth and clarity in my thinking. I value just and fair outcomes, and I admire the court's unique duty to provide that.  I believe in our system of government, even though it appears to be broken. It is the judicial system that can save it, so we need the most honorable of persons on the Supreme Court. We need justices who seek the best outcome, while those who seek glory, power and attention for themselves are better suited in other roles.  I define the ""best outcome"" to be that which accurately reflects the laws and the constitution while providing relief to those who suffer real harm. Without discrimination, I see my duty primarily to speak for those with the least amount of voice whenever possible.  I don't yet have a great deal of knowledge about Supreme Court cases and their rulings, but I look forward to researching them and learning what I need to understand in order to do this job well.  Thanks for considering my nomination.  (Also, I'm a ""she."")"
