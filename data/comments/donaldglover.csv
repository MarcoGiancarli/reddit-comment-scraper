donaldglover,3dqe7n,PelicanPop,14,Sat Jul 18 21:19:43 2015 UTC,"I had my first kiss to this song. Kind of.  I met a girl who knew about me because I'm a Bino fan, and we hit it off. I eventually plucked up the courage and got my first kiss at age 20.  We kissed for a bit, and in the middle of it, she asked me to quote a part of the song, and then we went back to kissing. I sometimes have this thing about lyrics, though so I pulled away again, and kept rapping.  That was a great time."
donaldglover,3dqe7n,IKnowSedge,6,Sat Jul 18 21:11:10 2015 UTC,"First kiss I had with one girl was with ""favourite song"" That was really cool.  Still is one of my favourite songs haha."

donaldglover,3dqe7n,magiricod,6,Sat Jul 18 22:31:28 2015 UTC,She asked me to rap from   These black girls with natural hair who keep up with their tumblrs   The reason I felt I had to carry on is because that is one of my favourite stretches of lyrics. But I realised it was inappropriate when I got to Richard Pryor's death.
donaldglover,3dqe7n,IKnowSedge,3,Sat Jul 18 23:26:19 2015 UTC,Lol Gambino does not have alot of sweet songs.
donaldglover,3dqe7n,magiricod,4,Sun Jul 19 00:23:58 2015 UTC,I prefer this remix to the original Kanye song. The lyrics are just way better.

After watching the film GONE GIRL I realised he was surprisingly one of the best parts of the movie. I haven't seen that much range from Donald as opposed to Tyler, but don't get me wrong though.

donaldglover,3dfl8f,AndISaidHey27,3,Thu Jul 16 01:22:13 2015 UTC,Donald Glover is too young. Stockman was always a middle-aged loser. Donald is not middle-aged or a loser. I think they cast the right guy. That's just my opinion though.
donaldglover,3dfl8f,branmuffinzed,5,Wed Jul 15 22:34:10 2015 UTC,Tyler Perry is by no means a loser either though. I don't like the guy's movies but he is pretty successful I believe. But your other points are spot on. Donald still looks 22 - 27 and Baxter looks. Well. Like a murky 33 - 42. Tyler Perry is like 40+.  Just for comparison purposes though...  This is Baxter This is Tyler Perry This is Donald

donaldglover,3d8jbd,Step1Mark,2,Fri Jul 17 07:48:59 2015 UTC,Also pls default us
donaldglover,3d8jbd,spgreenwood,3,Wed Jul 15 03:46:17 2015 UTC,"Hahaha. That would not go over well right now. But if you come up with ideas for a video series, I can certainly lobby for those."
donaldglover,3d8jbd,Yasillydumb,3,Wed Jul 15 06:05:39 2015 UTC,yeah especially with the big change to defaults incoming (which looks good btw)
donaldglover,3d8jbd,spgreenwood,3,Wed Jul 15 06:08:18 2015 UTC,"Well I don't know about all that. He probably doesn't have the power to do that, and subs dedicated to a specific person/entity/piece of media (TV show, Game, Movie, etc.) doesn't feel like it should be default.  I mean, think about it. Someone might like pop music and listen to only artists like Talyor Swift or Miley Cyrus and doesn't want to see stuff about Donald Glover on their front page."
donaldglover,3d8jbd,threethousandfive,95,Wed Jul 15 03:51:36 2015 UTC,"Hi r/donaldglover! It's true.   I'm also working on getting Donald to do an AMA here, in this sub."

donaldglover,3d8jbd,spgreenwood,4,Sat Jul 18 08:16:08 2015 UTC,I would be forever grateful!
donaldglover,3d8jbd,PopWhatMagnitude,9,Wed Jul 15 03:47:48 2015 UTC,"My guess would be either an AMA in this sub, or a video AMA on /r/IAmA. Donald's a big enough name that he could get a lot of people comfortable with V-AMAs, but I think we at this sub would do better at asking less generic, more in-depth questions.  But I don't think a V-AMA on a small sub would work yet.  Regardless, I love that you're a part of the community, and thank you for getting the ball rolling!"

donaldglover,3d8jbd,sureyouken,14,Tue Jul 14 21:01:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you. We'll be doing a blog post about video soon, but it won't really change much about the AMA process. In the past, Victoria would get on the phone with the subject and transcribe their answers into text - and they would appear on the site right away.  For the ones we do in the future with a video component, it'll work the same - subjects will sit down in front of a camera and the questions will be read out to them. Their answers will be transcribed immediately, so they'll appear on the site right away - and about a week later the video will come out.   It allows us to go one step further with the experience. To be able to visually show things that the subject might be talking about...to capture the reactions/emotions of people when they're asked funny/thoughtful questions...to be able to preserve oral history from incredible minds that have had unique experiences. We feel that since these people are spending time with us and answering these questions with the community, we should make the most of it."

donaldglover,3d5gh0,ki11ak3nn,6,Mon Jul 13 21:56:41 2015 UTC,I have a G4 so I might be able to help. Go to settings. Then language and input. Then check the box next to the Childish keyboard.  So then when you start typing a message a little keyboard should show up in the notifications bar. Swipe down. Hit change keyboard. Then pick the Childish keyboard.  Everything I'm sayin I'm super sayin like Goku.
donaldglover,3d5gh0,ki11ak3nn,3,Mon Jul 13 22:57:10 2015 UTC,How is the G4 btw? I was thinking about switching to Android and either getting that or try and get an invite somehow and get the Oneplus Two when it comes out.
donaldglover,3d5gh0,ImmatureIntellect,2,Mon Jul 13 23:10:08 2015 UTC,It's great. Decent battery life. Amazing screen and camera. Plus I got a free battery pack/cradle and a free 128 GB memory card just for buying one. Pretty nice perks if I say so myself.

My only criticism is how hard it is to switch back to regular keyboard, from my keyboard I can just hold down the spacebar and it opens up childish keyboard but I have to go into settings, language and input, to switch back. Just a button or something to pull up the ""choose input method"" menu would be much appreciated."
donaldglover,3d5gh0,CommonKTD,4,Mon Jul 13 20:50:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback!  You have to manually go all the way to settings, language and input to switch back to the regular keyboard?  I was going to add a button like that but I thought there was a little keyboard icon in the status bar that shows up when you start using a keyboard. Then from there you can swipe down from the top of the screen and tap ""choose input method"" to switch keyboards."

I know that pretty much means I'm causing my own problem, and it's really an issue on the roms end. But I still think it would be useful, I imagine a lot of people running custom roms will have this problem.   Also I'm not sure if other devices  not running touchwiz have this, like LG, HTC, and stock android."
donaldglover,3d5gh0,zZielschmerZz,4,Mon Jul 13 22:57:53 2015 UTC,"Ahh I see what you mean, I didn't even think about that. I'll add a button and update the app, good catch."

donaldglover,3cvfiv,darrylchilds,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:04:50 2015 UTC,"An original idea? It's been a looooooong time since any movie has been an ""original idea"". Can you name a movie from the last 10 years that was a completely original concept? I'm wracking my brain and I can't think of one."

donaldglover,3cvfiv,darrylchilds,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:35:22 2015 UTC,The Martian is based off a book.
donaldglover,3cvfiv,LifeWithHer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:35:38 2015 UTC,"OK sorry, didn't know. The point is though it's not been done. While the Ghostbusters have been done twice before and has a reboot being filmed. This post is calling for another. It just doesn't make sense to me. And before someone brings up Spiderman, that's different. Yes, its been done to death but the #donaldforspiderman died down when Andrew Garfield was cast and only picked back up when the rumors started about the MCU/Sony partnership. Not when either of the reboots were filming. And who wouldn't be in a Spiderman movie these days. It's a proven, instant payday. There's nothing saying this Ghostbusters won't flop. If it does that means there's probably significant amount of years until someone wants to reboot it. If it doesn't, then they would more than likely do a sequel."
donaldglover,3cvfiv,darrylchilds,4,Mon Jul 13 03:08:31 2015 UTC,Interstellar?
donaldglover,3cvfiv,spiralmonkeycash,14,Sat Jul 11 16:22:15 2015 UTC,"Lol I mean do you really want me to? Interstellar, Nightcrawler, Birdman, Whiplash, Lets be Cops, Lucy, A Million Ways to Die in the West, Neighbors, Bad Words... That's just a few from last year... That's not counting movies taking from novels/comic books. I'm simply talking about rehashing, rebooting, prequels and sequels. The only reason they're rebooting/or whatever this new Ghostbusters is going to be, is because Bill Murray doesn't want to do another. So why does this have to be called ""Ghostbusters""? Change the name, costumes, and a few details in the plot... There you go. I saying with this new one with the 4 women coming out... Not even out, this is calling for another one. Let 3 guys with Donald Glover be in another comedy. I'm all for that."
donaldglover,3cvfiv,darrylchilds,2,Sat Jul 11 16:21:47 2015 UTC,"I was talking about not borrowing characters or plot devices that so many movies have done in the past. Something completely and 100% original. Birdman was a cartoon, and got rebooted on adult swim. I wouldn't call it original, even though the movie is not about the superhero birdman. I haven't seen Lucy, but I think I gathered the gist of it from the trailers and hearing high school dropouts rave about how genius it is on social media. It sounds a LOT like that Bradley Cooper movie Limitless. As much as I love Seth MacFarlane, AMWtDitW was absolute garbage, so was Ted and I'm sure Ted 2 will be just as awful.  I'm sorry. I wasn't meaning to come off as a jerk to you. I just can't stand movies anymore. I used to adore the world of film and now it seems like all filmmakers do is force a romantic subplot in nearly every movie and spend money on shitty looking CGI/green screen effects that are just ""meh"" instead of splurging for some practical effects that will blow people away. Everything is now a reboot, a remake, or a ""re-imagining"". Hell, this is basically Adam Sandler's new movie."
donaldglover,3cvfiv,CaitlinSarah87,3,Sat Jul 11 20:30:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not reviewing movies, just because a movie isn't good or flops doesn't mean it's not an original idea. And you can be inspired by something and draw from it. It's still original. But you are right studios control what we see for the most part... But as a society, when we flock to the theaters to watch the fifth transformers movie, that just tells them that's what we want to see. I felt the same as you, I just dove into independent films. There's more power for the filmmaker to make what they want. But yea I don't take something like this personal. I see it as a debate lol"
donaldglover,3cvfiv,darrylchilds,3,Sat Jul 11 20:55:27 2015 UTC,That's an awesome opinion right there.
