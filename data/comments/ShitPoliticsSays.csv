ShitPoliticsSays,3e2f29,bllasae,-3,Wed Jul 22 00:20:14 2015 UTC,"Ok, here's some logic for you. Imagine McDonald's only has one cash register open, and there's a long line. They still make plenty of money, but every 5 minutes a customer looks at the line and says ""This isn't worth it, I'm going to Burger King"". This costs McDonald's, let's say, $2 in profit each time, for a total loss of $24 in profit. It's not horrible for business, because now they're only serving 88 customers per hour instead of 100. But if they hired another worker, those 12 customers per hour decide to go to McDonald's and spend their money, which is enough to overcome the $15 they pay the worker. Which means more profit for McDonald's than if they hadn't employed the second person at all.  Faster service also ensures customers will come back to McDonald's next time, too. Would you rather go to the McDonald's that always takes forever or the Burger King two blocks away where you're in and out in two minutes?  If you can't see the potential benefits of hiring extra workers, I think you're the one who's logically challenged."
ShitPoliticsSays,3e2f29,GuyBelowMeDoesntLift,5,Wed Jul 22 00:36:43 2015 UTC,"You're forgetting the fact that there's not always a constant line. So you've sunk your own logic. Plus you don't actually make money by how fast you get people through, except in extreme circumstances where people are extremely rushed for time. Not to mention, you're paying, say for an extra 3 people, an extra $45/hr for a job that others could do without them. 45*8 =360, so you're paying 360 dollars for 3 extra workers to make not even close to enough burgers to make back that 360, that's a loss.

If I only have one food option, that place should hope to make me good food quickly if they ever wanted me to come back.  This is how capitalism works. Fast food places are all competing to give me the best lunch option. This is influenced by their distance from me, their price, the quality of their food, and their service. If any of those aren't to my liking, I'm not going to go to that fast food restaurant. What a single consumer spends at a fast food restaurant usually generates enough profit to pay a third of one employee's hourly salary. If I like that place, I will be going back many more times, generating profit ad infinitum. Are you seriously telling me that you've never been turned off from a restaurant by crappy service?"

Why would someone rush into a house fire to save someone for the same pay as dropping a basket of fries into oil?  The government is by far the largest employer in the country. Assuming most of these positions can't just be lost, will rich people really provide enough tax revenue to provide a pay increase for THAT many people?  edit: An article I just read looked at federal employment numbers, did some rough math for people working under grants and government contracts, and added in state and local figures. It gave an estimated 40 million people in the US who were working in some way for the government at any level.  Ok, so let's say that every government employee would need to get a $10,000 raise in order to convince them to either stay at their jobs nor seek a demotion to lesser responsibility. Seems reasonable. But if we take that total dollar amount and divide it by the number of Americans who have full-time employment (statista.com), every single full-time employed person in the US would need to contribute an additional $275 per month to cover that cost.  But taxing rich people will pay for it all, right? There are about 11 million millionaires living in the US right now. If just them, they would each get to pay about $36,000 per year to cover that cost. Of course that millionaire figure included all assets, so that would end up including a lot of retirees."

In your opinion.  In reality it works for millions of people.  You cannot ensure everyone a living wage because people's needs for them to live comfortably vary by location and personal choices.  A 40 year old mother of seven has different monetary needs than a 16 year old living with their parents.  The 40 year old may need $24 an hour to get by while a 16 year old only needs $7.50.  Is it fair to pay the 16 year old three times less than a 40 year old for doing the same work?  This is why we pay people for what their labor is worth.  It's a mutual agreement between the employer and employee.  The government steps in and helps those who fall on hard times or have made poor life choices.   And if you want to worship a system that will only ever fuck the poor and minorities, then you can go suck corporate cock too.   After you sweetie.  Capitalism is the system.  It has done to raise more people out of poverty than any other force in the world.   and I have a diverse skill set that all alls under ""arts"" so it doesn't get me far in a society that cares little for the arts.   Yeah, ""the arts."" I can't understand why there isn't a great appreciation for stuff like this.  My childhood friend is a celebrated artist in Panama.  He makes a lot of money."

ShitPoliticsSays,3e2f29,TotesMessenger,5,Tue Jul 21 16:53:10 2015 UTC,""" I have a diverse skill set that all alls under ""arts"" so it doesn't get me far in a society that cares little for the arts.""    When I was a kid looking at going to college my grandfather sat me down and gave me a piece of advice that served me well: ""You need to put a dollar sign on your education"".  This meant that I went into an industry that was high demand and had good wages.    When I got out of school I didn't make much money because I didn't have the skill or the experience required to command a high salary.  It sucked and I scraped by.  However, I went where the work was (which were often shitty places to be) and honed my skills and a mere 10 years later I'm making $100,000 more than what I started out at.  I'm in my mid 30's.    It sounds like you didn't put a lot of thought into what you were going to do after school and how you were going to get by or you are just starting your career and haven't honed those skills yet.    A Bachelor's in Art History doesn't provide as much value to a company as a BS in Engineering does.  Now if someone really likes Art History, the lower salary may be an acceptable trade off if they get to do something that they love.    It is unrealistic to demand that someone with little or unrefined skills, who doesn't bring as much value to an employer be compensated by someone who has a more marketable skill set."

This is an intellectually dishonest argument.  Christ never advocated government healthcare.  Christ never advocated giving money to the government and let them decide how to provide for the poor.  He did say give to Caesar what is Caesar's and he said to give to the poor and help the unfortunate. In the United States, we the people, are Caesar.  We get a say in how much we pay in taxes and what our taxes go to because we live in a democracy where we can select our representatives.  We were to give to the poor on top of our taxes.  Some people feel that the government is inefficient in doing this.  They also disagree on how much the government should be giving and for what services.  The church still feeds, clothes, and takes care of the sick.  You are essentially, by your interpretation of the scripture, advocating for taxes, a government policy.  That would seem like a small step to theocracy on your part.  No one is advocating taking all government services for the poor, or rather no serious politician is.  Let's take a look at a part of the scripture that you referred to:   ""For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’” ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭25:35-36‬ ‭NIV‬‬   This of course is the parable of the sheep and goats.  This is where Christ accepts people into his kingdom and denies others.  In this parable, could you imagine yourself standing before Christ and pleading your case that you paid your taxes?  You are to give to the poor and provide for others on your own will and not compelled to via a government proxy of taxes who will imprison you for not paying.

Funnily enough Obama was rated as the worst (although I feel that he won't be rated quite as badly as he is now once he's been out of office for a few years). I'm thinking both him and Bush would drop lower in the worst category and Nixon would go up (meaning they won't be seen as badly, while Nixon will be seen as worse) if the poll is taken a few years down the road.

His speech in Cairo began the Arab Spring.  He brought peace and prosperity to the U.S. relationships with both Iran and Cuba.
ShitPoliticsSays,3dxud3,seanosul,3,Mon Jul 20 22:40:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to comment on the healthcare because I don't think I'm informed enough to make a decision as to whether it was a good or bad thing. Osama was killed because of the legwork done under Bush. Obama essentially gets credit for the Bush administrations work to find him. Gay marriage has nothing to do with Obama seeing as how it was a Supreme Court decision, and he didn't play any role in making the decision. In fact he was against gay marriage his first term if you don't remember (then changed his stance when it suited his needs). Obama definitely did not begin the Arab Spring lol How is bringing peace with a country bent on the destruction of others who don't believe the same things as them a good thing? Wouldn't we want to have bad relations with them (at least until they change their ways)? And doesn't Cuba still to this day treat their citizens horribly (I could be totally wrong on this, but I was under the impression they still mistreat their citizens)?"

It's just plain economics and business. Sure a burger flipper is pretty central to a fast food place but it's not very skilled and anyone can do it. You get paid for more specialized jobs because those required a lot of training, college, and learning to be a professional. That's why companies value these employees more. That and companies always have to find ways to lean up their balance sheets.   Another thing liberals don't want to hear is that no company is created just because someone wanted to give people jobs. Companies are started because the boss needs an income. The company's first priority is to the owner, the creditors and the shareholders. Everyone else is second. Profit must be made or the company goes bust and you're unemployed."
ShitPoliticsSays,3dwbcn,fortcocks,8,Mon Jul 20 14:43:22 2015 UTC,"I can not understand how people don't get this.  If the job 'you' are doing is not worth more than the pay 'you' are receiving, then that job does not exist. The concept that we as people are selling employers our labor just does not exists to these kids of my generation, they seem to think that just doing work should equate to being paied a lot.  Taking orders at mcdonalds is definitely not worth 15 an hour in most places, sure some large cities that can work, but not every micro economy can handle that, so mcdonald's would probably just buy touch screen order terminals to offset the cost (the cost for one of these things has to be less than $10k by now, figure another $10k worth of development and other stuff and you have a real savings after the first year.)"

It seems like it was questionable for awhile.  As a Republican, he has won none of the high-profile elections he ran in.  As to why he would switch to Republican... probably because it is more in line with his views in general.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Duke#Knights_of_the_Ku_Klux_Klan  Seems like he was pretty much repudiated by Republicans due to his racist beliefs.  Interestingly:   In 1988, Duke ran initially in the Democratic presidential primaries. His campaign failed to make much of an impact, with the one notable exception of winning the little-known New Hampshire Vice-Presidential primary."

The party repudiated him, so you are wrong.  Let's, for a moment, separate his white nationalist beliefs from his other political beliefs.  Family values, abolition of the IRS, Constitutionalism, anti-communism.  THOSE particular beliefs are certainly more right than left.  What you want to insist is that the GOP welcomed him because they are racist.  It appears, though, that he decided to make the switch based on other political beliefs.  Even though he has many beliefs that the right would agree with, he has been thoroughly repudiated by the Republicans."

But don't pretend like there isn't a reason why the Republican Party has to continually separate themselves from racists.

Hard to know intent, but comments like that can very well be intended to incite the action. Even without intent, it can inspire people who are prone to those types of actions. The more popular those messages become, the higher the odds. For practical purposes, I don't agree with the distinction you're making. I'd rather these types of things be nipped at the bud, rather than allow it to grow.   Anyway, there have been several comments that are more direct which you might not see, as they eventually get deleted. But not soon enough imo. I reported one to the admins recently that said something along the lines of ""this problem will never get fixed until these scum are dragged into a gutter, and a bullet is put through their head."" Then someone responded in agreement by saying something to the effect of ""yea, we really need to start organizing and make this happen."""
ShitPoliticsSays,3djx2k,not-Kid_Putin,2,Fri Jul 17 22:37:29 2015 UTC,"Those quotes are frightening. Even without any actual intent, to just say that out loud in a public forum is vile.  For the most part I was just trying to figure out for myself the differentiation, why some are deleted and others aren't. Personally, I agree with you. A while ago the hate and hyperbole somehow made that sub basically closed off to anyone who didn't share that vitriol, to the exclusion of even most reasonable Democrats.  I hardly know what to say on SPS anymore other than ""Oh, more hate."" Ideally the sub should require picking through /r/politics with a fine-toothed comb to find the crazy, and it says something that one doesn't have to search much to find someone who hates entire groups of people.  High-school socialism I get, but it's getting to be something past that now, where hatred isn't rebuked but considered ordinary conversation. It says something that /r/liberal is the more level-headed sub in comparison. What gets me is that if you go to the /new tab, most early posters are actually Republican. And all those ""brave"" posters who spend time to post research and then get downvoted of course never return because of it. There are lots of people who actually want to participate in a political sub but feel completely excluded. Ideally, SPS wouldn't need to exist.  I get that the higher-ups are Liberals, but I'm hoping they start to look at the comments and see it for what it really is: a hate sub.  I don't hope for any kind of 50/50 split with Liberals and Conservatives since reddit is by-and-large Liberal, but they could really use some substantial changes if they ever want to be a place for reasonable political dialogue, if it actually even wants to be that.

They imagine themselves to be the bringers of new era being inaugurated in Western civilization. It's the classic ""revolutionary"" fantasy, whereby the fascists see themselves in the same light as other lauded revolutionaries throughout history.   Are we still talking about Conservatives? Or Liberals? Does this description even apply to any modern, mainstream political party? No, it doesn't.   The fascists have no interest in goodwill politics, and before resorting to violence, they will often attempt to manipulate and exploit the political process from within.    You heard that right, GOP politics are all about manipulation. Any day now they'll start protesting in the streets and murdering old grandmas!   I'm not saying that the modern GOP is full-on fascist right now, but it's also not a possibility which should be dismissed as impossible or even unrealistic.

There are plenty of people who are going to vote the Democratic ticket regardless of who is on it, and there are plenty of people who support Clinton (and Bush and Trump) right bow because it they recognize the name and it is too early for them to actually educate themselves on individuals platforms. At least some of those people would identify with Sanders' ideals, which admittedly sound rather attractive in a vacuum.   I honestly do believe Sanders would do better in the general than he will in the primary (assuming no other Democrat in the general). But it's a moot point. He has no chance on Clinton, and even if she crashes and burns, Biden could probably swoop in and take the nomination of Sanders at the 11th hour."

None of them were honest about who they were and how they wanted to raise taxes and expand the nanny state. None of them even dared refer to themselves as a liberal.   That's the one good thing about Bernie Sanders. He is only democratic candidate since Mondale who is actually honest about who he is and what policy he wants to implement. While I abhor his politics, I respect his honesty.   And that honesty is the very reason he would have no chance in the general election. He won't be able to trick the moderate independents into voting for him (nor will he try to.) He will campaign to the left, confident that the US public has grown to support socialism. So unless the Republicans nominate a knucklehead like Trump or Santorum, he won't have a chance.   That being said, I would love to see a Rand Paul vs Bernie Sanders general election. It would definitely be a clear choice between Liberty vs Socialism, not hand picked party favorites."

The polls are based off of mainstream Republican and Democratic candidates.  With all of the Bush hate, it should be surprising that the elections were so close in 2008 and 2012, and not the whopping victories that Reagan had.  This is evidence that Obama was seen as a deep liberal, and had an impact on election day.  If Bernie is the one to walk onto the scene for the Dems, there is the potential for quite a few states to flip to the Republicans if they aren't into the whole socialism thing, and especially if the Republicans run someone who is more moderate.  Elections are decided by independent voters, and more often than not, independents are moderate.  There is momentum and a lot of fair weather fans, but overall, Bernie has the significant potential to flip all of those poll numbers on its head if he wins the primary."

He's not the savior that /r/politics thinks he is, but he's also not the punchline that this sub seems to think he is. Some of his ideas are very popular, and he gives the same genuine vibe that Ron Paul used to offer.  It's all a moot point, because he's not going to win the primary.

My method has him winning the Electoral College 285-253 in the event of an exactly tied popular vote, for instance.

Early Catholic views towards Charles Darwin's theory of evolution were negative, since they contradicted the belief that God made all creatures in their current form and that that form has remained unchanged.

The program was a dramatic success in reducing both teen pregnancies and abortion.  It also would have reduced the tax burden on the state by reducing welfare and other social costs for young mothers who had babies for which they weren't ready.  But it also gave women easier control over their own bodies, and made sex outside of wedlock more appealing, and made abstinence only religious dogma obsolete, so it had to go.  ""pro life"""

Some conservative governors even turned down federal money to fill in the gap for people who make too much for medicaid, but not enough to pay for their own health insurance.  The end result is more abortions.  They may want to live in a different reality where the end result of all that is not more abortions, but that is the reality we live in."

I can't imagine a good rationale for the decision they made, so I can only speculate as to what is going on in their minds.   You could try asking one.  Or reading a source that's not a far left blog.    Here's an NPR article discussing the issue:   But not everyone agrees, because of how IUDs function. Most of the time an IUD prevents sperm from meeting an egg, and therefore prevents pregnancy. But if the egg and sperm do meet, the IUD keeps that embryo from planting itself in the uterus. In those cases, an IUD would prevent a fertilized egg from developing into a person.  ""This crosses a line,"" says Republican Kevin Lundberg, who chairs the Senate Health Committee in Colorado. In Lundberg's view, an IUD can count as an abortion, and this makes it impossible for a program that funds IUDs to receive state funding. ""The state constitution says no direct or indirect funding from the state shall go towards abortion,"" Lundberg says.   Another possible argument is that taxpayers should not be required to fund your sex life.  You're free to have sex if you want, but I'm not required to buy your condoms.    And as for this:   The program was a dramatic success in reducing both teen pregnancies and abortion.   Do you have anything to support this statement?  Because the NPR article says that 30,000 women participated in the program.  How many of those were teens?  And how many abortions were prevented?"

ShitPoliticsSays,3dae3r,lmaoo-sure,2,Wed Jul 15 02:27:03 2015 UTC,"I have a problem with this ""out of touch"" narrative. What exactly is ""touch""? Until a couple of decades ago, society was decidedly determined by and concerned with the attitudes of adults/older people. At some point, probably the 60's, that started to shift. The consequence has been pandering to people with very little life experienced or no fixed personalities/identities/values. I don't know about you, but imo politics should not revolve around trying to sucker in as many clueless, passionate people as possible. It should be a debate on the effectiveness of certain policies, not appeals to the emotions of what are basically children (live with/depend on mom & dad, no life experience, little to no work experience, etc.). I think society has swung too much in the way of pandering to young people, therefore disregarding the experiences and opinions of older generations."
ShitPoliticsSays,3d96yd,ZipMcCockup,34,Tue Jul 14 14:07:58 2015 UTC,The number of people wishing that Donald would be killed or harmed is simply disgusting.  Civil discourse is virtually non-existent in /r/politics and IMO it is only getting worse over time.  Are there no moderators who actively participate?  I just got done reporting a number of truly disgusting comments.  We all should make a point to do the same thing.
ShitPoliticsSays,3d96yd,bookerevan,26,Tue Jul 14 14:50:39 2015 UTC,"I've had a conversation with two separate /r/politics moderators about the Civility rules there. Basically, you can't insult specific posters, but you can say whatever bigoted things you want about entire groups or an individual political figure. Obviously nothing civil about it.  The last moderator I talked to was a Conservative and said he joined the mod team to try and stop that, but he's been out-voted on the issue.  So I don't believe the mod team is asleep at the wheel about it, more that the majority of them are totally fine with bigotry and the disgusting comments. It's completely within the rules.  When it comes down to it, /r/politics is just another hate sub."
ShitPoliticsSays,3d96yd,SparklingGenitals,14,Tue Jul 14 16:16:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the feedback.  It's bizarre that the mods are OK with death threats on a Presidential candidate but moderate civility comments against anonymous Internet posters.  I'd bet though that death threats against Obama or other prominent Democrats would be shut down immediately.  I'd test that theory but I'm not going to make any death threats against anyone.  /r/politics is a lost cause, it just gets worse over time."
ShitPoliticsSays,3d96yd,bookerevan,10,Tue Jul 14 16:26:08 2015 UTC,"Death threats fall under a different category than Civility in their rules. You can't incite violence, but stuff like ""I wish he were dead"" or even ""I'd applaud rich Republicans getting beheaded"" skirts the line and is generally ok, though that may depend on the mod on duty at the time.  Here's a link to the second conversation I had with a moderator about the civility rules and his reaction to my comment:  https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3cf3ru/why_do_so_many_democrats_support_bernie_sanders/csvadv6?context=3"
ShitPoliticsSays,3d96yd,SparklingGenitals,7,Tue Jul 14 16:52:43 2015 UTC,Yeah that is bullshit. I'm pretty sure if I levied threats or bigotry towards a certain democratic candidate I'd be banned so fast there would be scorch marks on the moderator's keyboard.
ShitPoliticsSays,3d96yd,kier00,4,Tue Jul 14 16:36:44 2015 UTC,"If you made threats you'd be banned, sure. That's not just an /r/politics rule but reddit-wide. But it's arguable that there's a fine line between hoping for violence and actually calling for it.  Say something terrible about the Democrats in general and I highly doubt you'd be banned or even have the comment removed.   I don't believe the biggest problem is with the removal actions or inactions of the moderators so much as their terrible interpretation of the sub's rules which allow for those kind of comments."

Go ahead, just guess.  https://www.minnpost.com/eric-black-ink/2013/11/scott-walkers-wisconsin-vs-daytons-minnesota-which-doing-better  Minnesota also taxed the rich, increased minimum wage, expanded medicaid, surely their state has turned into a socialist hellscape right?  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carl-gibson/mark-dayton-minnesota-economy_b_6737786.html  So yeah let's talk about framing.  I guess you could consider Walker a success if you don't include anything else in the frame... and your measure of success is that his state didn't burn to the ground or anything like that...  Now let's see how SPS reacts in the face of empirical evidence...  I predict denial and down votes without a substantive or convincing rebuttal."
ShitPoliticsSays,3d76ww,mrbobsthegreat,8,Tue Jul 14 15:52:55 2015 UTC,"Sigh.  Minnesota's economy is incredibly diverse.  We weathered the recession better than most of the nation.    This had little to do with any party's policies, and much more to do with the diversity of MN's economy.  This isn't a direct comparison at all.  Walker is anti-union, but MN is not exactly passing pro-union policies either.     Minnesota also taxed the rich, increased minimum wage, expanded medicaid, surely their state has turned into a socialist hellscape right?   Nice strawman.  No one here made this claim.  Why would you bring it up unless you wanted to tear down the strawman to try and back up your stance that ""liberal = good, conservative = bad""?   Now let's see how SPS reacts in the face of empirical evidence...   This isn't empirical evidence at all.  There's nothing in those articles that shows a causation of the outcomes you're touting they did.  For example, the minnpost article discusses spending more on K-12 education.  It literally discusses Dayton's increased spending, without showing any direct results of such spending.  This isn't empirical at all.  It's barely even a correlation based off this article.     Minnesota also taxed the rich   Barely.  2% on individuals earning over $150k/year.  It's nowhere near the ""tax the rich"" cries coming from the left across the nation, and trying to use it as an example of the benefits of taxing the rich is disingenuous.   increased minimum wage   Again, barely.   Increasing the minimum wage didn't do much.  Most employees impacted by the state min wage hike were already covered under the federal minimum wage law.  Mandating someone make more than 8.00/hr when they are already mandated by federal law to make 7.75/hr isn't exactly going to cripple an economy.  But then again HuffPo doesn't discuss that, as it doesn't fit their narrative.  It sounds better to say they're no longer making 5.15/hr, but 8!     The more practical test of this wage increase will be when it goes above the federal minimum wage level, which has not happened yet.  Let's see how /u/Dixzon reacts to empirical evidence that his/her claims aren't supported by the links they cited, and that they're stretching the information provided by the articles to support their own position."
ShitPoliticsSays,3d76ww,Dixzon,-7,Tue Jul 14 16:27:31 2015 UTC,"You are making unsupported claims, first your claim that Minnesota's economy is more diverse is simply a statement without anything I've seen to back it up. Secondly, that a more diverse economy will necessarily do better than a less diverse economy regardless of the circumstances is an unsupported (and probably wrong) statement.

Secondly, that a more diverse economy will necessarily do better than a less diverse economy regardless of the circumstances is an unsupported (and probably wrong statement).    I never said it would.  I said we weathered the recession better than most.     Consider for example, oil rich states. Some of their economies lack diversity and yet always do well specifically because of oil.   Until oil tanks in price, in which case they suffer.  Diversity is one of the best ways to weather a downturn.  It's why financial advisers recommend diversifying your portfolio.    This article has a nice animated graphic that shows changing diversity overtime.  You'll notice MN turns bluer(more diverse), while WI turns oranger(less diverse).    No comments on the minimum wage hike being negligible(almost every employer does business out of state and are therefore bound by federal min wage law), or with the tax increase being tiny and nowhere near what is constantly being proposed?"

Hell, even Arne Carlson (who was governor for 8 years) gives credit to Minnesota's diverse economy, not politicians for their ability to leave the recession unscathed.  Dixzon, who pays you?

ShitPoliticsSays,3d4cbz,anagramz,-20,Mon Jul 13 14:52:47 2015 UTC,"He has a point though.  Religious conservatives certainly don't understand Christianity.  Conservative Christians oppose gay rights and compare America today to a modern Sodom and Gomorrah.  Ezekiel 16:49  ""Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.""  Considering that republicans just cut food stamp funding to the point where some senior citizens are going on one meal a day it would seem that conservatives turned us into a modern Sodom.  Those filthy Sodomites!  Matthew 19:21  ""Jesus answered, ""If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.""""  SOCIALIZMZM!!!1!!  Instead this is what conservative Christians actually believe, that ""render unto Ceaser what is Ceaser's"" means churches should turn in illegal immigrants to the government.  LoL, morons.  Edit:  the real meaning of rendering unto Ceaser what is Ceaser's (for those of you who aren't familiar with scripture, as the people who have replied to me so far were not) is that you should pay taxes, and when taken in context with other passages, you should particularly be happy to pay taxes when those taxes go to feed the poor and hungry.    Now, if you're going to down vote me, tell me how I'm wrong (in your opinion), or admit that you cannot and you just don't like people bringing things about conservatism to light."
ShitPoliticsSays,3d4cbz,Dixzon,12,Mon Jul 13 18:02:10 2015 UTC,"republicans just cut food stamp funding to the point where some senior citizens are going on one meal a day[1]    Follow your own link and look at the pictures. At least 8/12 people are overweight.  Jason Derr from slide #10 says ""There's a constant terror that my family is going to starve to death."" You can tell simply by looking at his face that he is >30 but probably more like 50 pounds overweight.   But that is beside the point. You yourself have hit upon the Christian view of giving with your quote of Matthew, stating ""go, sell your possessions and give to the poor."" Christians, and conservatives, believe in helping the poor voluntarily and directly through charity, and they back this up by give more to charity than liberals. They do not believe in a system, as Milton Friedman would say, where ""A and B decide what C should do for D.""   At the church that I went to growing up there was a line out the door every Sunday where homeless/needy people who didn't even attend the church were able to get food. We had an entire room devoted to clothes that needy people could come to any time and take what they needed. Granted, that is anecdotal, but I don't believe I've ever been to a church that didn't have a similar system for helping the poor.   You are not being compassionate by telling other people that they should give their money to the poor. Furthermore, I am not telling you how you are wrong ""in my opinion,"" I am telling you how you are wrong, period."
ShitPoliticsSays,3d4cbz,anagramz,-11,Mon Jul 13 18:53:44 2015 UTC,"Firstly, the overweight thing. Their food stamps had just been cut so the visible effects of eating one meal a day might not be showing yet. Secondly, when you don't have a lot to spend on food people tend to buy cheap stuff like rice and pasta, which is heavy on calories but poor in nutritional value, so they may be overweight and their nutritional needs are still not being met.  This leads to health problems particularly in the elderly.  You say conservatives are more charitable, I have read studies that go both ways on that one. But anyway, despite this, as a result of the actions of conservatives, senior citizens are going hungry anyway. It turns out that on large scales ""churches can have charity bake sales and can drives"" is not an effective way to feed the hungry. To fail to recognize that reality is to fail to be charitable, and the result is that elderly people are going hungry in the richest nation in the world."
ShitPoliticsSays,3d4cbz,Dixzon,12,Mon Jul 13 19:05:53 2015 UTC,"When you don't have a lot to spend on food people tend to buy sheep stuff like rice and pasta, which is heavy one calories but poor in nutritional value, so their nutritional needs are not being met.   I imagine you mean cheap instead of sheep :p. But that statement is false either way. You clearly believe the federal government is a capable entity, so you'll have to allow me to link the DoA, itself, saying that cheap food being unhealthy (or healthy food being too expensive) is a myth. A myth perpetuated by liberals, I might add. Some choice quotes if you don't feel like reading the entire article, I don't blame you:   Dawn Jackson Blatner, a registered dietitian in Chicago and author of The Flexitarian Diet, says that the latest report ""is great information to help bust the myth that it costs too much to eat healthy.""   And another:   Cynthia Sass, a registered dietitian in New York City and author of S.A.S.S.! Yourself Slim, says, ""Many of my clients are surprised to find that their grocery bills don't go up when they swap processed goods for fresh foods   And perhaps the best one:   But Phil Lempert, editor of supermarketguru.com, says that with just a little preplanning before going grocery shopping, you can save at least 25% on your bill and eat healthfully. ""The tradeoff may be that you have to spend a few more minutes in the kitchen doing food preparation.""   I think this one is particularly good because it explains that perhaps it will take a bit of extra work to eat well on a limited diet, and I agree - people need to show a bit more personal responsibility, which is an ideology that liberals (dumbfoundingly) do not subscribe to.   I'll address your other post about giving to Caesar here as well.    Also I noticed you conveniently ignored the part about rendering unto ceaser what is ceaser's. You ignored the conservative pastor's twisted interpretation of it   I haven't watched the video you linked, but I didn't say what the pastor said. I'm sure there are thousands of instances of Christians using the Bible to support their views in ways that I do not agree with, and I'm sure many other Christians feel the same way. Just from the headline I agree with you, the pastor seems out of line, and perhaps later this evening I will watch the video and get back to you.   as well as the fact that the real meaning means you should pay taxes   I never said that we shouldn't pay taxes. I am not a libertarian (at least in it's current state), nor do I believe in any way that we should abolish the federal government.   and when taken in context with other passages, you should particularly be happy to pay taxes when those taxes go to feed the poor and hungry. How convenient for you that you ignored that part of Jesus' teachings!   I haven't ignored that part of Jesus' teachings. I've never evaded my taxes, however high they may be.   Furthermore, that isn't the context of the passage. The context of the passage was that the Pharisees were ardent nationalists who opposed Roman rule and were asking Jesus that question to try to trick him. And you say that 'we should be particularly happy to pay that tax when it is for the poor and needy,' but the tax in question was a tributary tax to the Roman emperor, enforced by the presence of a Roman garrison in Judea. The tax went to the office of the emperor, who was the richest man in the world. It was up to his discretion whether he would use that money for the poor and needy, which Augustus certainly did. But at that time Tiberius was emperor, and he certainly was not overly concerned with the poor and needy. Sidenote: a great novel about the Roman emperors in the Claudian line is 'I, Claudius' by Graves.  So I believe you've gotten the context entirely wrong, but I am certain I could be wrong, and perhaps you can show me how that is."

The context here is that the Israelites have been led out of Egypt by Moses and Aaron, and they are collecting an offering (which was their form of a tax at that time) to build the Tent of Meeting (also known as the Tabernacle).   Each one one who crosses over to those already counted (they were doing a census at the same time) is to give a half shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel...The rich are not to give more than a half shekel and the poor are not to give less when you make the offering to the LORD to atone for your lives. Receive the atonement money from the Israelites and use it for the service of the Tent of Meeting   Here we have God charging a flat tax for a public works project."

I ignored it because it doesn't help your point at all. You linked one loony guy that said something on Fox News of all places. To say that what he said is what the majority of other Christians believe in is a hasty induction on your part. Maybe if you bring some more evidence to the table in regards to the subject, I might even believe you.    Also I noticed you conveniently ignored the part about rendering unto ceaser what is ceaser's.   Mark 12:17 speaks of a contrast between God and Emperor. Jesus says that you shall give what belongs to Caesar to Caesar, and you shall give what belongs to God to God. A horrible point of argument, because he doesn't speak of influential obligations that we have to the state as a Citizen of the United States. If we have the right to vote for lower taxes, then we certainly have the right to pay less taxes morally and justly -- and that is something that Jesus never spoke ill against in the Bible.  So if you think that somehow in your skewed mind that Jesus told his followers to 'pay more taxes' because it's 'good', then you are wrong. Especially putting emphasis on the fact that Rome at the time was corrupt and cruel to it's people through harsh taxation and endless wars. We have every right to vote against excessive taxation because we believe that the money belongs in the hands of the people, rather then one governing entity (the federal government, which I do believe Sanders will be more proned to with his type of governing).   I can provide a much higher death toll from religious reasons and systems of beliefs. Even if I was only considering people of the Christian faith.   Right, and if I were to argue this with you -- I'm sure you'd retort with the ""NOT TRUE SOCIALISM"" business?

Not only can charity not solve the problem,    The money exists to solve these problems for the whole country. And yet, people who have the means have not yet been charitable enough to solve the problem. So if only charity solves the problem, why has it not solved it yet?    but government solutions actually make it worse.   In what fucking world do you live. Let's look at what this charitable guy did from the article:   Rosen, 73, began his philanthropic efforts by paying for day care for parents in Tangelo Park, a community of about 3,000 people. When those children reached high school, he created a scholarship program in which he offered to pay free tuition to Florida state colleges for any students in the neighborhood.   So let's say the government had better safety nets and provided more funds towards day care for families living in poverty. Let's say the government spent more on reducing state college tuitions, or paying the way for families in need.  How exactly would those same measures, if taken by the government, make the problem worse?"

I think the evidence is clear that, when government decreases regulations/taxes, the gains of economic growth are enjoyed almost exclusively by the upper class.   Charity and welfare only address the symptoms of a bigger problem.   Ok. But those symptoms are there. And when you say ""symptoms"" you mean ""people are suffering"". It's fine to want to find a big picture solution, but you're not offering one.   I want more people to get an education without sapping economic growth. You want to treat a disease with more pills, I want successful treatment or better yet, a cure.   Yeah dude. So does everyone. How do you improve our nations education system without spending, you think?  Why is it that conservatives are such a huge fan of free market principles, except when they're applied to government workers? For example, we valued education more, we'd pay teachers more, and then the best and brightest of our population would find that career more attractive.

And in case you didn't notice, poverty remains an issue despite all the money poured into welfare since the 60s. That's because welfare doesn't work, it stifles economic growth and keeps people poor and dependent on welfare. Meanwhile the family structures among the poorest in society continue to deteriorate."

It's a great way to keep kids from starving and families from being evicted. You think people on welfare aren't properly motivated? Did you know most people on food stamps are actually working?  There will always be poverty but the notion that it's caused by welfare is fucking ridiculous."
ShitPoliticsSays,3d09mx,NRA4eva,3,Mon Jul 13 20:11:01 2015 UTC,"Feeding cats keeps cats from starving. But it also leads to more cats that need to be fed. Humans aren't any different. I know people on welfare are not motivated, I work in their homes on a daily basis. They do as little as possible to get by and they rely on welfare, charity and support to maintain this lifestyle.   Those individuals that are motivated are only in poverty temporarily. Sadly, many people who are on welfare will remain on welfare in one form or another and they will have children that will likely end up on welfare as well.   Unless you are literally starving or about to get thrown on the streets after you put 100% of your income towards the things you absolutely need, you shouldn't be collecting any welfare. And yet most people on welfare would not be on the streets or starving to death if they didn't have welfare.   And they wouldn't be on welfare for prolonged periods of time like many are today. If you want to see real poverty, go to Africa. And think about how much welfare and aid has gone to Africa and yet poverty is still rampant. That's because welfare and charity can at best treat symptoms and offer little or no course of curing the disease."

I never intended to cite the article as evidence that increased access to contraception leads to a reduction in abortion rates. It's a fallacy to think that because some of the countries with free contraception have high rates of abortion, that it would raise abortion rates in the United States. I am under the impression that it can reduce abortion rates because in controlled studies in the United States, as well as comparisons across multiple countries, there is ample evidence to suggest such a correlation exists.

I linked to the report and cited an excerpt showing they said the opposite and was downvoted. I couldn't fucking believe they would upvote a lie that confirmed their views rather than the actual evidence  they also cite neumarks study showing that minimum wage increases don't cause job losses, but ignore studies from Card showing they do. The Card studies relied on actual payroll data so they're more reliable. However, if you bring it up they simply say cards study was debunked many times and never present an argument as to why  Also, even the Economic Policy Institute and other advocates of a higher minimum wage day they don't know what the impact of a $15 minimum wage would be because their research only supports what would happen raising it to $9 or $10. However liberals insist on using their research to prove raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour or more would work. Apparently they know more than the people they cite to prove their points!

I'm with you on the $15 being bogus, MW supporter Dube has analyzed the optimal MW for different cities and not a single one hits $15, let alone in a place like rural Alabama.   I've also been downvoted to hell for pointing out that tying the wage to productivity is a terrible idea (I had like six solid points against it) but that's a different matter entirely   Economic theory and data suggest marginal productivity of labor roughly equals wages (really compensation) quite well see figure 12 here, the issue is they are comparing the inflation-adjusted minimum wage with GDP-deflator adjusted mean productivity which is a terrible metric.

Meanwhile Obama reprioritized the war on terror and actually found and killed Bin Laden.    And yeah, we didn't go to war with Libya after Benghazi, probably because our European allies had literally just gone to war with them.

Probably a lot of people who say they're for Trump are really just supporting a conversation about illegal immigration and not so much the man himself.

Honestly, it's actually a pretty similar situation to economists."
ShitPoliticsSays,3co3c7,NRA4eva,4,Thu Jul 9 13:32:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's actually a pretty similar situation to economists.

ShitPoliticsSays,3co3c7,mousylion,2,Thu Jul 9 14:04:54 2015 UTC,I agree.  I think it's thqt sociology is a relatively new field dominated by one prevailing ideology.  Economics has been around for centuries with lots of data to show just how valid it is.
ShitPoliticsSays,3co3c7,Classically_Liberal2,4,Thu Jul 9 16:37:15 2015 UTC,"Indeed.  My skepticism of sociology tends to be because its dominated by left wing/radical feminist ideologues and is in that regard an echo chamber (it makes sense - people who aren't generally don't care about the things sociologists care about and those that do would feel discouraged due to the overwhelming prevalence of leftists in sociology.)  Also it's hard to scientifically/empirically prove a lot of the claims made by sociologists (I.E. how does one quantify privilege/oppression/racism/sexism - it seems heavily subjective and isn't helped by the amount of ideologues)  It also doesn't help that sociologists have a tendency to say things that are blatantly false and outside of their field, like gender is a social construct (the entire field of psychology disagrees) or that capitalism is evil and oppressive (economics settled this debate awhile ago.  Capitalism is undeniably the best system - the argument now is what type of capitalism is the best - I.E. social democracy, modern Swiss-style, Singapore-style, 1800s America-style, etc.)   But I'll admit I'm not very educated on sociology so I could be way off about them.  /u/NRA4eva feel free to explain why I'm wrong on this or what I'm missing."
ShitPoliticsSays,3co3c7,NRA4eva,3,Thu Jul 9 19:09:45 2015 UTC,"/u/NRA4eva feel free to explain why I'm wrong on this or what I'm missing.   Sure!   Indeed. My skepticism of sociology tends to be because its dominated by left wing/radical feminist ideologues and is in that regard an echo chamber (it makes sense - people who aren't generally don't care about the things sociologists care about and those that do would feel discouraged due to the overwhelming prevalence of leftists in sociology.)    So a couple things. Sociology is certainly not dominated by radical feminism. There is, generally, an acknowledgement of our society as a patriarchy, but that's hardly a radical notion, and it's pretty easy to demonstrate. I'd also say that the degree to which it is left wing is also overblown. Some of the most important sociologists have been quite conservative (Emile Durkheim, Talcott Parsons, Erving Goffman). Of course, there are many extremely left wing sociologists too, and I won't pretend like Marx, Foucault, and others haven't had a tremendous impact on the discipline, but I think the end result is that sociology as a discipline is slightly left of center.   Also it's hard to scientifically/empirically prove a lot of the claims made by sociologists (I.E. how does one quantify privilege/oppression/racism/sexism - it seems heavily subjective and isn't helped by the amount of ideologues)    It IS hard to empirically prove a lot of these things. Figuring out how to measure abstract concepts is something that sociologists spend an huge amount of their time thinking about. It's also something they explain very methodically when publishing a paper. Measurements are highly scrutinized in any peer reviewed journal. However there are legitimate ways to measure a lot of these concepts. It's worth studying these things scientifically (it's certainly better than talking about them unscientifically).  I mean, let's say you wanted to find out if there really is such a thing as white privilege. How would you go about it?   It also doesn't help that sociologists have a tendency to say things that are blatantly false and outside of their field, like gender is a social construct (the entire field of psychology disagrees)    When sociologists say ""gender is a social construct"" they're very specifically talking about gender roles/norms aka the behaviors associated with masculinity and femininity which are socially constructed. The notion that women wear dresses and their hair long is socially constructed. What it means to be feminine in our society is socially constructed. Biological sex is (of course) not socially constructed. I don't know where you got the idea that ""the entire field of psychology disagrees"" but that is not true.   or that capitalism is evil and oppressive (economics settled this debate awhile ago. Capitalism is undeniably the best system - the argument now is what type of capitalism is the best - I.E. social democracy, modern Swiss-style, Singapore-style, 1800s America-style, etc.) But I'll admit I'm not very educated on sociology so I could be way off about them.    I don't think you'd find to many sociologists who think capitalism is evil. That doesn't mean that Marx doesn't have some really smart observations when he critiques capitalism. Marx is really important to sociology but that's because is ideas were the foundation for further research.  Sociology, in a pure sense, doesn't make value judgments. Sociologists strive towards objectivity. It's not ""Capitalism is evil"" but ""the Capitalist system exploits the working class who necessarily paid less than what their labor is worth.""  For me, it's frustrated to see sociology disparaged in conservative circles because it is very much a science. Conclusions that are drawn are done through very methodical study. Anything worth drawing conclusions about is worth studying in this way. To me, a rejection of sociology is to say ""Sure, those people study society scientifically, but I'm pretty sure I can draw conclusions from my life experience that are more valid than that.""  TL;DR: Some of your ideas about what sociologists think aren't quite right. Sociology is not as liberal as you think it is and when they do say things that you don't agree with you should look into why scientific study came to that conclusion."

ShitPoliticsSays,3co3c7,NRA4eva,2,Thu Jul 9 23:02:46 2015 UTC,"Alright here we go.   It is absolutely radical (of course radical doesn't mean wrong), and I have not seen any compelling evidence to suggest this. If you could provide some I'd love to see it (Jiandersonzer0 shared me a post from you on white privilege which was quite detailed and very good, so if you could do the same for gender/sex I'd like to see it.)   I think we should start by clarifying exactly what a “patriarchy” is. The first line of the Wikipedia article on the subject will do: “Patriarchy is a social system in which males hold primary power, predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property.”  To me, it’s self-evident that this is the case, but assuming you disagree I’ll discuss a bit why. Men obviously dominate the political sphere, so we’ll skip that one. Moral authority is a bit trickier, but maybe we can agree on some of the individuals who represent moral authority? Clergy (and religious leaders more generally), Lawmakers, Judges, Law Enforcement, Philosophers – all of these fields are dominated by men. Furthermore, to the extent that there is a hierarchy within these fields, men dominate at the top.  In terms of social privilege, I think this is also clear. How do we define social privilege? Economically is going to be a huge component – men have a clear advantage there given the wage gap. I know the gender wage gap is somewhat controversial on reddit, because sometimes people mistakenly say that women earn 70 cents on the dollar for the same work. This is false, but irrelevant to our discussion. There are many cultural reasons for why men earn more than women, but they all lead to the same conclusion – our culture either pushes men towards occupations that are more highly valued or traditionally male occupations are more highly valued on account of them being “traditionally male”. Most likely it’s a combination of both these things, though I think more the former than the latter. We can also define social privilege in terms of symbolic privilege. For example, wives generally take on the last name of their husbands, virtually never the other way around. (Imagine how you would think of a friend who told you he was taking his wife’s last name.) Movies/TV/and entertainment generally is centered around men. There are exceptions, of course, but generally speaking main protagonists are men. Rare is the box office smash with a female lead. I’m going to stop there for the sake of brevity, but let me know if you’re unconvinced that the US is a patriarchal society (as defined above). I think it’s important to know that the definition does not require men having exclusive control over political leadership, moral authority, and social privilege.  I skipped citing anything for the sake of time but if there’s any claim you find dubious I’m sure I can look it up.   I'm sorry I can't see how someone could possibly come to that conclusion, unless we're using the /r/politics[1] definition of the center. Literally ¼ of sociologists are open marxists[2] according to a survey. The Democrat to Republican ratio in sociology is 44:1.   I think my view is difficult to prove and does require a bit of a removal of U.S. political context. For example, climate change is apparently a conservative/liberal divide, but belief in climate change has virtually nothing to do with conservativism or liberalism as a political view. Same can be said for things like abortion, and belief in racism, and religious views in generally. These are things that have taken on a partisan divide. In the U.S. political landscape, you’re right – this is definitely firmly leftwing. In terms of valuing economic freedom over equality, and the degree to which the government should intervene in economic matters, I would stand by my statement that sociology, as a discipline, is slightly left of center. I think may consider this moving the goal posts, and maybe that’s a fair criticism, but I think it clarifies what I mean.   Also, I would note that I would be careful how you interpret that survey. Sociologists are generally not “political Marxists” in that they feel capitalism needs to be toppled. Being a “Marxist” in the sociological sense also has the meaning of agreeing with Karl Marx’s critique of capitalism. The source you sent equated Marxism to creationism which immediately makes me not take that person seriously. They obviously have not read Marx.   Gendered differences is one of the first things taught in a psych class. And I do mean differences larger than just sex. I mean the brains are literally different - and thus males/females will usually have different goals, tastes, likes, etc. See here or here or here or here or here . I can't confirm the specific gender roles you listed aren't societally constructed, however gender roles have even been found in other primates.   Sure. There are genetic differences between males and females. There are also environmental factors. One of my favorite quotes on nature v. nurture is from a psychologist who’s name I don’t remember. When asked which was more important (nature or nurture) he said “That’s like asking which is more important to the area of a rectangle, length or width” – the point of course being the both matter and both have a profound effect on how we live our everyday life. So, yes, there are biological differences between males and females that go beyond sex organs, but it seems to me that environmental impacts separate us even further. Furthermore, where we draw the line for what is “masculine” behavior and what is “feminine” behavior remains something that is determined by society and not genetics. The evidence you provide doesn’t counter that.   See the prevalence of marxists in sociology, or the fact that a huge chunk of UChicago sociologists wrote a letter[12]critiquing the school for attempting to set up a Milton Friedman Institute, named after one of the greatest and most influential economists of all time. His crime? Being a neoliberal shill.   Equating “Marxist” from that survey and “Capitalism is evil” is a mistake that I’ve already addressed. In sociology Marxism is a branch of theoretical thought. I find it very doubtful that most of these sociologists would call for the toppling of capitalism (but maybe they would).  On the Uchicago letter, well that’s an interesting example of the tendency towards sociologists towards Keynesian economics. Capitalism and Socialism exist as two opposing sides of a spectrum. Milton Friedman is one kind of capitalist while Paul Krugman (for example) is another kind. There are respectable capitalist economists who aren’t neoliberals. Personally, I think our general shift towards neoliberal economic policy is a big reason for the increase in wealth inequality in the United States.   IDK if you want to get into a debate about Marx as well but I haven't seen any good critiques.   Have you read Marx? I think maybe we should skip this debate.   Publication bias exists, unfortunately. In econ for example, likely due to publication bias, the overwhelming majority of MW literature before ~1990 was explicitly anti-MW. Of course studies like Card & Krueger's and more recently, work by Dube, has disputed this consensus greatly.   I’m not sure what you’re point is by bringing up publication bias though. Like I said, Measurements are highly scrutinized, and perhaps even more to the point, explained for the world to see and judge. If, in a peer review journal someone is making claim about the correlation between race and employment opportunity, you will be able to read that article and see precisely how they measure “employment opportunity” and decide for yourself the level of validity of that measurement."
ShitPoliticsSays,3co3c7,Classically_Liberal2,2,Tue Jul 14 15:23:41 2015 UTC,"Apologies for the delay on the response, and the length.  I needed an excuse to gather a bunch of sources together on this subject anyway.  If you don't want to read through it all or answer it, I completely understand.  Also if your reading this shortly after I posted this allow me to link what I forgot to add links to.   Men obviously dominate the political sphere,   Absolutely, but the leap, in my opinion, made by sociologists, feminists, etc, is that it is because we are in a society that values masculinity or something of the sorts, and that because these people are men, their policies will be geared towards helping men, at the expense of women.  For the former, I think that it's quite possible, and in fact highly likely, that in the past that has heavily influenced politics, voting patterns, and womens' decisions to get involved.  For our current and future generations, I don't see this being much of an issue though.  See for instance, Hillary Clinton, who is running for a position that would make her the most powerful and influential person in the whole world.  Polls show that the amount of people that are more likely to vote for her to become president due to her gender are more than double that of those who are less likely to vote for her for the presidency. Women have a massive advantage as far as public perception for leadership quality goes.  So what I'm getting at is if you're saying that we live in a patriarchy because the most visible influential people in society are overwhelmingly male, I don't really disagree here, but I think that this isn't so much due to sexism as it is a lack of electable candidates that are female.  After all, as far as presidential elections go, a significant majority of the electorate is women - see paragraph 3.  I'll go more into why I think lawmakers, if anything, favor women, in the social privilege discussion.  My apologies in advance if these sound like debunked MRA talking points, I find them convincing and haven't heard a sufficient rebuttal to them.   Moral authority   Yes, I think many organized religions can be quite patriarchal.  While being the worst offender, it's also losing influence rapidly.  That being said, it's a problem that needs to be addressed.  As far as lawmakers and judges, they may be men but they certainly don't seem to favor men.       In terms of social privilege   This in particular is where I have to strongly disagree.  There are many issues where I see women advantaged and men disadvantaged, and the vast majority of them don't even get addressed by mainstream media, academia, etc.  The few groups that do try to bring them up are mocked, dismissed, or called misogynists. Child custody is the most obvious issue, and the only one the mainstream seems to be addressing at all.  Women get custody of the children in 5 out of 6 cases, and men have to pay for it.  IIRC, in the past, the person who had the benefit of keeping the child also had the responsibility of paying for them.  That seems much fairer, although obviously in the past men were given custody too often - it should be 50/50.  Then there's the abundant evidence that men receive much longer prison sentences for the same crime.  One study puts it at 63%!  Women earn 59% of college degrees (and young women out earn males) yet they still have access to a plethora of women-only scholarships and aid.  Boys do dramatically worse in school, and their scores improve significantly when taking anonymous tests.  Breast cancer funding is more than double prostate cancer funding, despite prostate cancer deaths being almost as high, and the cancer itself inflicting slightly more people.  Male homelessness is substantially higher than women's, and suicide rates for males are four times that of women.  Workplace fatalities are 93% men, which according to your views on the pay gap is due to socialization.  Despite most domestic violence being reciprocal, and the cases that aren't reciprocal being predominantly women-on-men, there is far more help and funding available for female victims.  We even have laws like the Violence Against Women Act, based around patriarchal violence theory, and the predominant aggressor policy in our legal system which negatively impacts men.  Male rape is still not even taken seriously, with ""made to penetrate"" not even a category in most studies (I'll have to check to see if it qualifies legally).  Those that do actually look at that find similar numbers of victimization for men and women, and when one includes the prison population it is likely men face higher levels of rape.  Yet many in society view men as ""always wanting sex"" and thus think this is irrelevant (and also leads to ridiculous notions that if both a man and a woman are drunk and have sex, the man is a rapist when neither could actually consent.)  Hundreds of thousands of drafted men have lost their lives, and more have been injured, because the right to vote for them was attached to the draft - yet it was not for women (in my opinion we should abolish the draft entirely.)  Compare the media interest in the girls kidnapped by Boko Haram to that of the boys kidnapped by the same group, or forced into being child soldiers.    Other various issues that make the patriarchal claim dubious, imo, include when Tim Hunt, a Nobel Prize winning scientist can be made unemployable because of a ""sexist"" joke, when a false accusation of rape of a woman can ruin a man's life (see any recent rape stories in the media save Bill Cosby) when a criticism of any woman is taken as a criticism of all women and thus misogyny, and when there are people seriously arguing that misandry can't even exist because sexism = prejudice + power or whatever.  This isn't to flip the victim card around and say I'm oppressed, almost none of this affects me personally, nor am I saying women don't have issues of their own, or that equal rights proponents should focus mainly on men (a gripe I have with the MRM is that trans and minority issues are more important.)"
ShitPoliticsSays,3co3c7,Classically_Liberal2,2,Mon Jul 20 06:59:41 2015 UTC,"pay gap   My position on wage gap is highly nuanced but basically the TLDR is its largely down to personal choice/biology but a substantial amount of it can and should be reduced via increasing pay linearity in regards to hours worked. Can expand a bit here and I agree women are disadvantaged in this regard.   wives generally take on the last name of their husbands   I think this is just a continuation of tradition, from a time where men were effectively given responsibility over their wives, and implicitly ownership as well.     but generally speaking main protagonists are men   This could just be a case of art reflecting reality.  Most of the extraordinary things in history have been accomplished by men.  Now obviously there are a variety of factors for this, and certainly socialization/discrimination has played a significant role throughout history that has limited accomplishments by women to what they otherwise would have been.  (I'd also note other reasons may include testosterone which causes men to be more risk-taking, and how most IQ distribution charts I've seen (no idea on their validity) show more variance in men - I.E. more male idiots but also more male geniuses.) Also, is it possible that the situation with male protagonists are similar to how in gaming, there is talk about how something like 50% of the gamers are women, yet most protagonists are male, ignoring the games women play are far more likely not to have a protagonist?  Other than that, I'm not entirely sure what this is supposed to prove, sure it could reflect society valuing masculinity/men more, but this is speculative.     I think may consider this moving the goal posts   No not at all, I see what you're getting at.  Also, I didn't consider other contexts of Marxists, as you mentioned, so I will concede I was off there.  I still (somewhat) stand by that its generally far left socially and economically, but I definitely could be wrong given how you know more about sociology than I do.  Anyway, I should note the author is probably referring to Marxism as creationism because of how it has been disastrous every time someone has attempted to implement it, and also because economics has pretty much settled that some form of capitalism is superior.     Furthermore, where we draw the line for what is “masculine” behavior and what is “feminine” behavior remains something that is determined by society and not genetics. The evidence you provide doesn’t counter that.   I will agree that my evidence doesn't definitely prove my point, and I don't think it's entirely provable (we seem to be arguing more abstractly here, whereas your white privilege post was more straightforward and empirical and I found myself in complete agreement with it.) I will note a few things though.  Between the existence of gender roles in primates, and the fact that almost all societies have developed similar gender roles that are strikingly similar, and that they coincidentally largely match up with what one would expect from a sexually dimorphic species where evolution drives the skills/interests of the genders (I.E. men in physically demanding jobs, women in childcare and nursing) that there is a large biological basis.  I forgot to put my usual disclaimer when it comes to gender roles - I absolutely think there is a lot of individual variance, so certainly I wouldn't expect/force all to fit the roles, and I do agree that society pushes some of these individuals into the roles who otherwise wouldn't follow them - which is definitely an issue that I think we need to deal with.  I'd like to see sociologists and psychologists work together on this - and if there are any papers of such I'll certainly give them a look.   On the Uchicago letter...   Yes, I agree you can be a respectable non-neoliberal economist, the point about the letter is that Milton Friedman is a respectable neoliberal, and is being bashed simply for having differing views despite being greatly important to the field, with his work on the Great Depression, or the permanent income hypothesis, being two very important examples.  Also, common misconception, Keynesian simply refers to how to deal with recessions, one can be a neoliberal/right-wing Keynesian, myself and Friedman both fall largely under that category. I also agree neoliberal policies have increased income and wealth inequality.  There is no consensus that either of these are actually bad as a whole (obviously inequality due to rent seeking, regulatory capture, etc is bad,) there are papers showing either way.  Also, yeah, let's skip Marx."

You could have even rephrased it in the style of the OP and it would have been an honest position that someone could take.  It might be like this:  Me: ""If this is race baiting, then race baiting isn't bad.  You: ""When you say this, I translate it as 'race baiting isn't bad'.""  Then it would be cool, we could talk about whether what I said is equivalent to that, what is race baiting, whether this is race baiting, and whether race baiting is bad.   lolwut?   What we had here was an example of someone writing about a relatively subtle form of racism, as I said.  If you use the term ""race baiting"" to describe this, then race baiting loses any bad meaning that it had, in my opinion.

ShitPoliticsSays,3cif4q,passiveegalatarian,2,Wed Jul 8 22:10:26 2015 UTC,"What I meant was that the Koch brothers are absolutely not even remotely representative of anyone really. They are only representative of themselves and their personal interests and even being a conservative myself, I do wonder about the motivation behind Koch donations.  Ultimately, fuck it. Take it and run. Haha.   While I applaud the success of liberal social policy in the realm of equality and anti discrimination pursuits, their views on how to end poverty are where I draw the line. It is quite apparent that liberal policy with regard to how we combat poverty has failed over the last 40 years and has ultimately had the opposite effect people today think it does. Many of these programs were created by southern democrats in the wake of the Civil rights act and were intended to keep the black minority subservient. Somehow, democrats today wont acknowledge this and continue to push  hard for more soending on these programs while almost completely letting the republican leaders in the pockets of big business ship off any real opportunity to rectify poverty. It is so bad now, the only way any of us can fix it is to quit buying into this liberal vs. Conservative dialogue the media wants. It creates distractions like the confederate flag bullshit (while the TPP got fast tracked) that turn our attention to anything but what is actually happening. Being conservative is not about cutting spending irrationally, going to war and hating on non-white people and women. It is about minimizing the power of government. At least to me it is. The republican/conservative action we see today is completely counter to this belief.  The democrat action is too. They both suck. They both try to anger us with hot button issues and now they even try to legislate it to make sure we dont oay attention to the underlying fiscal policies they pass every year that are ruining my generation and our potential to succeed."

ShitPoliticsSays,3cif4q,SparklingGenitals,4,Wed Jul 8 04:51:03 2015 UTC,that's happens.  When you get a job and start paying taxes and have a kid to take care of - and you realize you're subsidizing people who choose not to work or doing anything useful even though they can.
ShitPoliticsSays,3cif4q,djc_tech,5,Wed Jul 8 13:46:39 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of it is all the work required to land that career job. You need to either work hard at a competitive college or put years in at crappy jobs gaining experience. So once you finally get there you realize you're being punished (more taxes) to subsidize people who say they shouldn't have to do that.  Sometimes I get the impression that 40 hours is the most people think they should have to work. If you can't afford to raise a kid, maybe think about wearing protection, etc.  Last year I made minimum wage and worked with lots of the same people who had similar career aspirations. I worked my tail off and got a good recommendation from my boss. They did drugs on the job, were lazy and frequently didn't show up to work.

Is it that humans feel safer in smaller communities since they are likely to know a much higher percentage of the people they interact with regularly? So as a community grows and we lose that familiarity, we feel we need more 'rules' governing those interactions to make up the loss in security?"

Rural areas, you are pretty much ""on your own"" as a community.  Volunteer Fire departments, stuff like that.  Seems like it's much more tight knit, and so it's not ""government"" fixing problems, it's Bill the DPW guy filling that pothole.  You don't get that in a city, and so when programs come along that will cause more spending, but help out someone, the rural folks don't want it, and don't like it... because they know Bill's not going to do anything different, but its going to cost them more money for Bill to do his thing now."

And it's not a matter of ""being contrarian"" -- as if someone arguing against a majority view is somehow just an unthinking, unresearched, knee-jerk reactionary.   Almost the entire world practiced slavery, including the modern West, and most places with similar levels of wealth to the US managed to end the practice without civil war, most conspicuously Great Britain. There were a great deal of unexplored avenues left in an actual fight against slavery as an institution and an ideology; unfortunately, abolitionist sentiment merely served as cover for hostile political maneuvers often enough that the south became progressively more entrenched and radicalized against it throughout the early nineteenth century (and it certainly didn't need any assistance in that department), so as to make leaving the union the obvious choice for wealthy slave-owning interests.   Even so, I find it morally repugnant to consider outright war against an entire populace because of their perceived immorality (or, more accurately, those of their aristocracy), or as a means of ethically improving their culture. I don't believe anyone in their right mind would be for invading every Islamic government in the world in order to rectify what we perceive as damning sins. Not only is it a reprehensible and unbelievably pompous opinion to have, it would most certainly never be the most efficient option, and probably wouldn't work at all. If the North was really all about eradicating slavery, they could have operated on any number of axes, ideological, economic, political, etc., even after secession. The fact of the matter is that Lincoln forced the issue to the point of violence because their nation-state, their so-called ""Union,"" -- the source of their power, prestige, wealth, etc. --  was threatened, and not until then."

Slaveowners did not have anywhere near the political power in the governments of European empires like Great Britain or France as they did the US federal government, let alone the Southern state governments of the Confederate federal government.  Contrary to popular belief, violence was very instrumental in ending slavery in much of the Americas.  In Haiti it ended via slave revolt and in much of Latin America its end was connected to the various revolutions and civil wars that took place there.  The places it ended peacefully were usually either 1) places with very few slaves, and thus slavery had limited importance and slaveowners had limited power or 2) places with lots of slaves, but were small parts of large empires, thus limiting the power the slaveowners in those places held.  Talking about ""exploring other avenues"" doesn't even make sense because the South is the one that initiated secession to protect slavery even when there was no imminent attempt at ending slavery in any manner, let alone an ultimatum to end it or be invaded.  The South prevented any possibility of ending slavery through compromise by seceding to prevent precisely that.  ""Even so, I find it morally repugnant to consider outright war against an entire populace because of their perceived immorality (or, more accurately, those of their aristocracy), or as a means of ethically improving their culture. I don't believe anyone in their right mind would be for invading every Islamic government in the world in order to rectify what we perceive as damning sins.""  This wasn't a distant, foreign place.  This was a part of the United States for over 80 years.  The overwhelming majority of slaves were born and raised in the United States, and under any moral legal or ethical system, were just as entitled to have their rights protected by the government as any white citizen.  If New York voted to secede and then after seceding declared that anyone who wasn't a registered Democrat was to be put into a concentration camp for reeducation, do you think it would be morally repugnant for the feds to consider a war to prevent that?   I'm not saying the North was fighting a crusade to end slavery, but your argument plainly argues against that even if they had.  Furthermore, you ignore the fact that Lincoln did not force the issue to the point of violence. The South is the one that initiated hostilities and forced every step of the way to get to that point."

The South is the one that initiated hostilities and forced every step of the way to get to that point.   Yea, no. Please read up on Fort Sumter.   The salient point is that the issues of secession and of slavery are completely different, even if the latter motivated the former. The civil war was no more a holy war against slave owners than the vietnam war was a war to stop the global domino-collapse into communism, or the Iraq war was a war to prevent the usage of WMDs.

What does that have to do with what I was arguing? I was disputing the notion that a federal government stopping atrocities within its subdivisions (or within subdivisions that declare themselves independent to commit or perpetuate said atrocities) is at all comparable to a nation invading every Islamic country to change the culture.    In any case, I fail to see how the federal government's past failures affect the morality of what it should have done.  Also, the South was the only part that was seceding in order to protect slavery.  Slavery had been abolished in 19 of the states that remained in the Union, and the other 4 were not seceding to perpetuate slavery, thus why there was no need to invade.  In this hypothetical example where the North initially declared its intention to end slavery, the border states would have been fair ground to invade had they seceded to prevent that (and there was a lot of fighting in said border states in real life).  Also, you can't really talk about the federal government's actions prior to 1860 without recognizing the fact that the Southern states had a very strong influence on said federal government.

If you want to be pedantic, then slavery hasn't been abolished in any country.  I don't think invasion was quite necessary to free the 20 slaves in those states.  Also, note that Dred Scott essentially made slavery legal everywhere, trampling on states rights in the process.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_historical_population#Table_4:_Enslaved_population_by_state_or_territory.2C_1790.E2.80.931860  Also, the downvotes are real mature."

No. The war did not begin in response to some slave-ship arriving in Charleston. Nor did it begin at any time while the South continued practicing slavery for decades prior. The war started because the US government, headed by Lincoln, could not condone a secession. The motivations of the secession were obviously based upon maintaining slavery. But why the response of the North was war -- to barricade themselves in southern territory and refuse to leave until fighting broke out -- is another matter. If the South had not seceded, there would have been no war. The war aimed at keeping the South under US control, period.

In fact I encourage anyone to go Google the term. Please. I beg you. His book is even titled such.   This was also recently used by white supremacist Dylann Roof in his manifesto in regards to why he became a racist. Here's an excerpt.    From here I found out about the Jewish problem and other issues facing our race, and I can say today that I am completely racially aware.   Being ""racially aware"" is distinctly related to white supremacy. It is not a joke. It is not a parody. The only real difference between this user and Dylann Roof is that Roof acted."
ShitPoliticsSays,3cf0sj,General_Hide,8,Tue Jul 7 12:05:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna deny that that statement paints the guy as a racist, but it's an incredible leap of faith to say that ""the only real difference between this user and Dylann Roof is that Roof acted"". Let's not paint all racists as mass murderers in waiting. We shouldn't overlook the fact that what Dylann Roof did took more than racist thoughts to accomplish. I know a few people who are racists because they had several bad experiences with blacks growing up  and they have said to me that they don't believe what Roof did was right. Some racists have just had bad experiences and therefore are super cautious. Doesn't make them right, but it also doesn't make them murderers."

There aren't as many racists here as the typical ""racist south"" circlejerk would have you believe, but there is also no short supply. For a prime example, I'm going to give you one of my close family members. He had many bad experiences with blacks when he was growing up and was almost killed by one. You will always hear him saying nigger this and nigger that when the news is on, but only when it's a black person who is on the news for breaking the law or for doing something stupid. Just as often as you hear him talking about niggers in the news, you will hear him talk about how nigger today is not just a color, it's an attitude. Not every black person is a nigger, and not every nigger is black. He doesn't believe all black people are scum and should be wiped out, it's just that he's had so many bad experiences that 95% of the time when he sees a black person he will see them propagating a sterotype and will see them acting like a nigger. When Dylann Roof shot those people, he was sad because he knew those people were innocent. He knew those people were not a victim of 'niggers' propagating their sterotypes or trying to live the gangster life.  This family members attitude toward racism is the same as any other racist I know here in south louisiana. I don't know a single 'white supremacist' among them who wants to wipe out entire races. They don't have that in their hearts, they're just cautious because of their own bad experiences and because of the way the media shows different races. They don't preach violence, they're not /r/whiterights material, they just hate the bad sterotypes that they see all the time with certain people and to them, it's routine. To them, you have to prove to them that youre not a spic/nigger/whatever because that's almost all they've seen. Doesn't make them right, but it doesn't make them scumbag psychopathic murders either.  I hope you understand that I know what you are saying, I just greatly disagree.

There are always outliers, and one's ignorant views and prejudices doesn't automatically mean they're the next mass murderer. People go through phases, I can only hope he is young, naive and will grow out of it, but some of his comments give the appearance that he's at least in his early 20's. That still does not mean he's dangerous, it only means he's a fool. Very few people, even the hate filled bigots want to act, but instead usually just surround themselves with people they share similar views with.   With all that being said, I find his positions to be disgusting, simple minded and extremely ignorant. I enjoy discussions in subs that I don't particularly agree with, but it's pretty clear his personal opinions are that of a racist, but tries to sugarcoat them as to gain support.   /r/Conservative, we can do better than this.

Stereotyping and overgeneralizing have done nothing good throughout history, it only further alienates and doesn't solve any problems. To view the black race as some sort of all encompassing group is the same as saying that all whites think alike and share the same values.   From all of my experiences, people who are racist or bigots tend to consistently use fallacies to interpret and rationalize their beliefs. If you already view blacks in a negative way, you're going to focus only on the things that confirm your beliefs and disregard any opposing information. You'll only grow angrier over every report of gang violence, muggings etc, but fail to see the millions of blacks who are in successful careers, serving honorably or working for a better life. You'll believe that Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson are the emperors of black people because they're the ones that go to the media first. They are 'community activists' and race baiters whose sole jobs in life are to separate people and divide them. Rant and rave about Ferguson being an example of all blacks, and disregard how the Charleston Church shooting victims families and community handled the events. There will always be opportunistic people, Furgeson being a good example. If you saw the wide shots of the riots, you'd see that it was mainly young rioters in small groups, surrounded by dozens of cameras (who then gave the impression that every black person everywhere was looting and rioting.)   Don't fall victim to the common fallacies, and read up on history and society, not just with areas you already agree with. The Conservative movement has nothing to do with race. It is a political/social philosophy that varies as much as people. There is no coming race war, despite 150 years worth of hearing that. Though less middle class and more poor will deeply hinder us perhaps, but not race. Look around once in awhile and recognize the millions of blacks who aren't out looting or in gangs. Make some friends of different races, religions etc and avoid lumping everyone into one group. We do that shit with liberals, as if there's this all encompassing group, then use the radicals as an example of all of them. There are a hell of a lot highly educated, rational people who are left on the spectrum (who are extremely fun to debate.)

I disagree because per capita is higher in the US.  But I think the biggest problem is that managing a federal government over such a large population has significant difficulties.  And I don't believe a majority of the states have the population base nor resources to do it either.  So it has to be a federal program.

Unemployment statistics there don't count a person as unemployed if they're required to do any amount of work for their benefits.   I very strongly do not believe the worth of a person should be measured by the work they do.  I also strongly disagree with the notion that business need to thrive too and that the measure of success is wealth or GDP.  A large part of this is my views on how technology is going to change the future, and how it has already changed how we work today.  There will come a time when no work is needed to live and that our machines and computers will be able to do all the work we need.  What then?  This could very well happen this century.

Same with medical costs.  The way it works is that since everyone is paying equally and to a central system it should be more efficient.  Even if you account for waste and corruption, which if you are not completely cynical, isn't inherent to a government system, should cost less as you don't worry about profit going to shareholders.  So all those taxes don't make people poor and not oppressive.  It's easy to think that way when all you've known is the system the US has.  But it does work well for them.  The people living there value government services over corporate services.  And quite frankly if you have a society capable of operating a functioning government it should be inherently better.  That's the real difference between socialism and capitalism.  Its just who you pay.  And for the US I doubt we could ever have that kind of government.  But maybe a mixed one could work.  Maybe some things shouldn't be profited from.  We already have a bunch of services that aren't."

Here is the beauty of the propaganda that /r/politics is under.  All of the above are somewhat neutral statements but not stances.  Stances are your views on the above statements.   Many Americans do agree that they want to raise the minimum wage, but to the extent that Bernie wants to, it is very far in the liberal camp.  Furthermore, his closeness with unions is also quite left. Again, most Americans support this, but to what extent? Also, most states have maternity leave laws and the federal government has one as well, though it has lots of holes. Supreme court has ruled on this already, the anti CU folk are sounding a lot like the crazy right wingers who want to combat the recent gay marriage ruling.  Ruling made.  Move on.  It isn't like the dems are the beneficiaries of this ruling, either. This is one of those ""kissing babies"" statements.  Every candidate says this.  What they do is very different, and what the propose can put one in either camp. Another kissing baby statement, and not a stance. And yet another place where it all depends on what reforms one proposes.  Free college for everyone? Pretty liberal. Probably the only stance and not statement in the list, but clearly also not moderate, especially with the levels of taxation Bernie likely wants.   So as you can see, pretty effective propaganda.  If a casual reader were to read that comment, they would walk away with the idea that ""yah, bernie sounds kinda moderate.""

For now it's just saying ""XYZ is a problem"" or ""ABC needs to change."" In Sanders-supporter parlance, if you also agree that it is a problem, than you agree with Sanders. For example, when Sanders says the wealth gap is a problem, it's safe to say that pretty much everybody agrees that the wealth gap is a problem. Heck, I do, too. Therefore, I agree with Bernie Sanders.

This is nothing new for Greece and is not changing, they have one of the most notoriously clientelistic national governments rife with corruption and unabashed patronage for political supporters. Greece had no business joining the EU in the first place and had to intentionally falsify their financial status to get in; Germany is definitely not blameless, but their biggest fault was ever believing anything the Greek government reported in the first place.   The real issue is Germany's insane trade surplus,   This is not the ""real issue"", the real issue is that Greece is insolvent and in the EU only via deliberate fraud (which should have been expected from a government like Greece). The real issue is that Greece is still rife with corruption and clientelism and that the Greek government does not have the legitimacy to properly collect taxes, leading to massive tax evasion and black markets."
ShitPoliticsSays,3cb6ob,handydandydoo,2,Tue Jul 7 14:36:58 2015 UTC,"You know this debt crisis isn't unique to Greece, right? Spain, Italy, and Portugal are all in the same boat albeit to a lesser degree (for now). If Germany weren't in the EU, there exists the possibility that Greece wouldn't have needed a bailout package, or at least not to the same degree, because a non-German Euro would have allowed their products and economies to be more competitive. The crux of the issue is that the Southern European economies are incompatible for a monetary union with Germany. You can pin the blame on them one by one as they inevitably fail, but you can't ignore the fact that if Germany weren't in the monetary union, SE would be doing better and Germany would be doing worse."

It's just that the thread is about the political situation in Greece around the austerity / bailout issue, your comments about GS seem to be minimizing the blame on the Greek government and really don't have a lot to do with the thread (the current political situation). GS was certainly corrupt / unscrupulous, but that really isn't relevant to the current discussion of austerity and politics between the Greek government and the EU."
ShitPoliticsSays,3cb6ob,UmbrellaResearchCorp,0,Tue Jul 7 00:10:47 2015 UTC,"The reason I'm emphasizing that particular GS point is not to diminish the point that the Greeks fucked up, royally, by trying to get 'free shit' --- but to illustrate the fact that nearly every single party is complicit in this whole debacle.   GS was greedy and wanted to skim money and bet against their client, The greek people wanted this because ""Free ShitTM "", and the greek govt were more than happy to trade that easy money for continued votes from their constituency.   The only people that are completely innocent in all this are the unborn generation of Greeks that have yet to be born but are going to be suffering because of the greed of people in this time.   So, in that regard, and in that regard only, I objectively stating that Greece saying ""fuck you, EU"", is the only way all parties are going to learn their lesson and stop this madness that is the socialist financial system. Otherwise, I'd say ""fuck you Greece, you made your bed, now you lie in it.......for 50 years if need be""."

They actually consider working in a bakery hazardous, and you can retire as early as 40. In this country, the only thing hazardous about baking is god forbid you refuse to bake a cake for a gay couple.   They borrow all this money from central banks and basically didn't have plans to pay it back, which is what countries like Germany are pissed about. Germany' economy is partially supporting Greece's.

You can tell that the people either have never lived here or just have an agenda to push (surprise surprise, amiright?).  They say Southerners are uneducated..  My high school was one of the top schools in the countries.  Sure, some extremely rural areas have some issues with kids not giving a shit but is that any different than areas of places like New York having trouble with their education in certain areas?  No, not really.  It just happens.  Some kids don't want to learn.    They claim we all just don't even teach sex ed and just tell the kids that ""abstinence until marriage is the only protection you need.""  This is also a load of shit.  Yes, they are blunt about telling kids that abstinence until you find the right partner is the best protection but they also freely inform kids of the importance and use of condoms and birth control.  They even give kids condoms.  I mean for fuck's sake, is it really the end of the world to tell a bunch of horny kids they maybe want to think about the consequences before deciding to be sexually active?  I mean I'm a realist and absolutely agree most kids will be sexually active and have the right to be if thats what they want to do and they should be educated on the use of condoms and such but damn I am so sick of hearing the abstinence thing blown out of proportion.  Its not taught as a replacement to sex ed, its a very small portion of it.  They act like we're all a bunch of racists.  Everyone I know is very tolerant of all races and just treat humans like humans.  Yeah, in private I've heard the occasional older person make a racist statement but I mean..  Thats just kind of expected.  No ones threatening non whites in the street.  No one's casually talking down to other races and trying to oppress them.  No ones walking around yelling ""nigger"" or whatever.  The worst I've heard in public is a group of black gentlemen at work getting very angry in the breakroom about the gay marriage decision and that doesn't really fall under racism.    They accuse of all being a bunch of bible thumping idiots.  I know many more not at all religious people and families than I do deeply religious and always have.  Maybe they go to church once a year for Easter for tradition but thats about it.  I'm not saying there aren't some very religious assholes that try to force their crap on others but they are very few and far between, much more uncommon than the people of reddit would have people believe.  And the whole ""religious people are always the dumb one's"" argument itself is such a crock to just dismiss differing opinions.  Some of the smartest people I have been friends with over the years held religious values.  But I guess according to reddit their beliefs should automatically make them stupid?    Basically, its painfully obvious that people just shit talk the south here on reddit because a lot of it votes conservative and thats the real issue they have with it.  Everything else is just a bunch of bullshit to try to justify the hatred.  It would be hilarious if it wasn't so sad and pathetic."

Crime is mostly done by young men, and so how do we determine how much of the Puerto Rican incarceration rate is simply their youth?   This is just one example to illustrate that inequalities in various measurements don't necessarily reflect the existence of privilege or discrimination.

That's politically expedient, but reality is much more mess.   The thing is, privilege doesn't necessarily come down to discrimination. Is it due to discrimination that women dominate fields that are, generally, less valued by society? Not really, but society is set up in a way that lead women to those fields, and lead men to fields that are more highly paid.  Another example is white privilege. If I'm white I get to see white people everywhere I go. White is the default, while non-white is considered ""ethnic"" or has some label that marks it as ""other"". As a white male I've gotten to enjoy countless movies and tv shows where the protagonist looks like me. I was born in a nice middle class suburb with good school districts and low crime. This isn't a coincidence. It's a privilege that is generally associated with whiteness. It's also due, in large part, to the overt discrimination of the past that helped create black ghettos and white suburban communities.  There is discrimination, but that's not the biggest part of the story when it comes to privilege."

If someone went to /r/conservative and started posting liberal/progressive news they would be shot down and rightfully so, but for someone to say ""We're non-partisan"" and then resort to censoring tactics is nothing more than hypocritical. But I guess when you don't believe in universal morals you could lie to congress while under oath multiple times, get caught attempting to traffic guns while trying to ban them for citizens, ignore the law about archiving emails and then delete them, but if you dare delete a minutes from a recording of a political opponent then your own party will demand you step down as president."

He was one of the better presidents in modern times.""  Tired of being lied to by every president since Reagan? Definitely understandable. Although that's quite a 180 after listening to Bill Clinton fans tell us for four years that character is irrelevant.  The Republican candidates? Though I don't have any reason to believe they're not moral, genuine people, they're just quickly waived off as evil liars without reasoning. It doesn't matter what he says, Bernie is the only good person.  Now, Hillary Clinton is inconsistent and unless you have your head in the sand, also a bit of a liar. When she wins the nomination, will people suddenly say that they've been Liberal all these years, but now they'll vote for the more consistent and honest Republican? Obviously not.  To the point about ""99% of Americans agree with Sanders on almost every issue,"" the argument you see in the thread over and over is that if Sanders says something is a problem and you agree that it's a problem, than you agree with Sanders.

But I'll be damned if I'm going to really buy that integrity is what matters most to them. If so, I'm not seeing too many democrats out there telling people to vote for any of the honest Republicans.

No, all of what was there originally still makes sense today and is still relevant. Those documents were written specifically to be timeless. Just because the king of England isn't a threat anymore doesn't mean the right to bear arms goes away. It's not a ""wartime right"".

About 15,000 supporters packed a sold-out Madison Square Garden to voice their noisy enthusiasm for Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader, angrily criticizing his exclusion from the recent presidential debates and hailing him as a reinvigorating force for democracy.  The mostly 20- and 30-something crowd paid $20 each for tickets to the Friday night rally, billed as ``Nader Rocks the Garden.'' They whooped as celebrities including Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Michael Moore and Bill Murray heaped praise on Nader.  They grooved to musical performances by Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, Patti Smith, Ani DiFranco and Ben Harper, and raised the roof with a chorus of, ``Let Ralph Debate.''  Welcome to the politics of joy and justice,'' Nader said. ``We are building a historic, progressive, political movement in America; a movement for which Nov. 7th is just one stopping place.''  In an hour-long speech that at times sounded like a left-leaning history lesson, Nader assailed big business for what he called ``a corporate crime wave,'' and said the Democratic and Republican parties were controlled by corporations.  ``Our country has been sold to the highest bidder,'' Nader said."

Is there any chance at all he could beat Hillary? I know he's been polling well in hyperliberal states, but what about with the rest of the country?  He's getting a pass on the normal extreme cynicism that Reddit views politicians with - why is that?   Edit: Thanks for all the fairly objective answers, guys.

ShitPoliticsSays,3bv7ta,Alphadude007,8,Tue Jul 21 23:18:22 2015 UTC,"If anything, Sanders will attract much of the extreme left-wing vote and maybe even some borderline moderates, but he wouldn't be able to catch the mainstream democrats like Hillary can. So while it is possible, Sanders getting the nomination and winning the presidency is a pretty big long shot.   As to why he's getting a free pass, it's because of his 'Stick it to the man' and anti-Wall Street rhetoric. Since much of reddit shares his populist sentiments, it makes sense that he's hoisted on a pedestal and made to be the lord and savior of American politics. Does that mean Reddit's, specifically r/politics', political views are shared by the majority of American voters? Absolutely not."

His support nationwide among democrat primary voters is around 15% versus Hillary who is about 60%. Still, his campaign has been getting more attention than was expected and he's being getting the biggest crowds out of all the candidates (both republican and democrat). This is probably due to being the only candidate that excites progressives.  Reddit has been less cynical towards him because he voices many of the same concerns as the /r/politics crowd. Probably the biggest being campaign finance reform. As far as I can tell, he's the most outspoken candidate against the Citizens United SCOTUS decision. Sanders doesn't seem to play politics to the extent other popular candidates do. For example, he refers to himself as a socialist, despite the fact that the label does more harm than good to his chances.  I think there's also something to be said for the alternative. Few candidates on either side of the aisle are more deserving of cynicism than Hillary Clinton."

Someone like Bernie Sanders in the White House is going to have to compromise significantly to get what he wants passed, so much it probably won't resemble what the far left wingers were hoping for at all.

The /r/atheism thread was more amusing to read, with lots of people saying they should be taxed except for the charity part; basically tax what I don't like and protect what I do.  Though I'm worried about some sort of harm done to churches eventually, I'm not expecting much to change in my lifetime, at least. There's not really a difference between a non-profit organization established by a church and any other NPO. Thus, what's done to churches has to be applied to all, and that's not really workable. It's too obvious the USA would go down the shitter if you started punishing all non-profits.

ShitPoliticsSays,3bmwuf,Popular-Uprising-,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:12:59 2015 UTC,"Let's look at what Cruz actually said:   CRUZ: The Courts have the authority to decide cases and controversies between particular individuals. But there is no obligation on others in government to accept the Court as the final arbiter of every constitutional question. Indeed, every officer takes an oath to uphold the Constitution.  INTERVIEWER: Did I just understand you to suggest that state officials should feel no particular obligation to follow the Court ruling if they feel it's illegitimate?  CRUZ: They should feel no obligation to agree that the court ruling is right or is consistent with the Constitution. This ruling...  INTERVIEWER: But does that mean they can ignore it?  CRUZ: They cannot ignore a direct judicial order - the parties to a case cannot ignore a direct judicial order, but it does not mean that those who are not parties to the case are bound by a judicial order.    So what's he saying?   That absent a specific judicial order directed to them, public officials are not bound to obey a Supreme Court ruling on what's Constitutional?    The Court's ruling in Obergefell concludes by specifically applying the law to all 50 states, saying:   As counsel for the respondents acknowledged at argument, if States are required by the Constitution to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, the justifications for refusing to recognize those marriages performed else- where are undermined. The Court, in this decision, holds same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry in all States.   Given the Court's ruling in Cooper v. Aaron, wherein Arkansas state school officials said they did not have to follow the Court's ruling in Brown v. Board of Education:   This Court cannot countenance a claim by the Governor and Legislature of a State that there is no duty on state officials to obey federal court orders resting on this Court's considered interpretation of the United States Constitution in Brown v. Board of Education.   It seems Cruz is wrong. If his claim is that the Court's ruling is not a judicial order, then his contention appears to be undecided.  Got my law degree at NYU. Don't believe Cruz should be disbarred if though he's wrong.   But if he gave that to me as legal advice, and I got sued, I'd sue him for malpractice."

ShitPoliticsSays,3bmwuf,cpill,-5,Tue Jun 30 15:46:47 2015 UTC,"intellectually dishonest   No, it's a solid comparison.  Miscegenation laws barred people from the right to marry based on their immutable characteristics - so did laws preventing gay people from getting married.   Such prohibitions violate Equal Protection and Due Process requirements specifically pertaining to marriage and are entirely comparable.    In the Loving case, a unanimous Court held that ""one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.” That same right is at issue with gay marriage.  From the opinion:   Applying these tenets, the Court has long held the right to marry is protected by the Constitution. For example, Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 12, invalidated bans on interracial unions…   Specifically, the Court in Obergfell said:   Loving did not ask about a “right to inter- racial marriage”; Turner did not ask about a “right of inmates to marry”; and Zablocki did not ask about a “right of fathers with unpaid child support duties to marry.” Rather, each case inquired about the right to marry in its comprehensive sense, asking if there was a sufficient justification for excluding the relevant class from the right.   In Loving, the Court wrote:   Marriage is one of the ""basic civil rights of man,"" fundamental to our very existence and survival.... To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty without due process of law.    In Obergefell, they wrote:   The right of same-sex couples to marry is also derived from the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection.   In both cases, opponents referred to their religious ideals to justify the discrimination.  Local judges in Alabama tried to block the enforcement of the Supreme Court's ruling on interracial marriage too. Nixon forced them to comply."
ShitPoliticsSays,3bmwuf,garmonboziamilkshake,5,Tue Jun 30 18:45:23 2015 UTC,"I'll copy and paste what I wrote below:  All I'm saying is that we have to define terms.

ShitPoliticsSays,3bmwuf,cpill,0,Tue Jun 30 20:20:09 2015 UTC,"what gay activists say they are fighting for and what they are actually fighting for.   I'm not sure the generalizing adds much - believe me, gay rights advocates have been arguing over the issue of marriage and whether to seek or reject it long before conservatives even took the discussion seriously.    Some gay people are libertarian and want government out of marriage, some see marriage as conformist, others have kids and concerned about rights, or are real plain vanilla and just want to be married. My old roommate was a tall, midwestern farm boy who taught high school, drank beer and went to church.  He said he might want to get married one day if it was a possibility, but he was too young. He still marched for the right.  Similarly, at first Blacks in America were fighting for freedom, then the right to vote and live certain places, due process in court, own property, and only much later the right to attend the same schools as whites.   Integration was not the foremost goal of the abolitionists, or even many of the first Black rights leaders.  Booker T. Washington was not an integrationist, and was criticized by William Monroe Trotter, a black activist who saw segregation increase in the North post-bellum.  The segregation Trotter advocated for is very similar to the 'normalizing' or 'tolerance' or 'acceptance' I hear anti-gay rights advocates lamenting.  ('Leave us alone, we'll leave you alone').  W.E.B. Dubois reversed his stance on segregation (accepting 'separate but equal', to the chagrin of the NAACP), and signed the Atlanta Compromise, in which Blacks accepted segregation without protest in exchange for basic education and due process.  What exactly do you think 'gay activists' are fighting for, and what do they 'say' they are?"

ShitPoliticsSays,3bmwuf,cpill,3,Wed Jul 1 01:15:57 2015 UTC,"It is intellectually dishonest. This is th internet, so I'll be perfectly blunt.  Two white heterosexuals go to the government and say ""Hey, we're probably going to have sex a bunch"". So the government says ""Well, seeing as that might result in a necessarily non-consenting third party (legalese for ""baby""), have a bunch of benefits and protections conditional on you making heavy reciprocal obligations to incentivize you to make those committments so that third party is better cared for""  Now a black and a white heterosexual do the same thing. The considerations are identical.  Two homosexuals go to the govermment and do the same thing, to which the government replies, ""Seeing as that can only ever pertain to the two of you, cool.""  To preempt your next objection. Because adoption requires the government, it already possesses the tools to ensure that said adopted child is taken care of. It can simply make those reciprocal obligations (which I support all people being able to make) mandatory.  It has no tools to ensure an optimum setting for a child which is the rsult of intimacy, so it uses strong incentives to encourage intimacy to happen more within that heavy-commitment relationship than not."
ShitPoliticsSays,3bmwuf,garmonboziamilkshake,0,Tue Jun 30 21:10:41 2015 UTC,"Your argument isn't intellectually dishonest, but it's immensely flawed.  You don't have to have kids to get married. It's not a requirement, or a prerequisite, it doesn't even capture a host of rights that marriage confers.  You seem to be implying that it's the only basis the state has to claim for granting marriage rights.  The Supreme Court rejected that idea in Loving, but let's assume that marriage is granted in order to encourage child-rearing.   Now a black and a white heterosexual do the same thing. The considerations are identical.   Defenders of interracial marriage bans made extensive arguments against the fitness/safety for children:   Appeals to child welfare are neither new nor exclusive to the same-sex marriage debate. Such appeals have also been raised in other family law disputes, most notably the fight for interracial marriage during the era of Loving v. Virginia,' the United States Supreme Court decision striking down Virginia's ban on interracial marriage.   Opponents of interracial marriage claimed that the ""mixed-race"" children produced by interracial couples were biologically inferior, suffered abnormal social and psychological development, and endured stigmatization by their peers.'   So yes, Blacks were facing the same objection to interracial marriage. Not intellectually dishonest to compare the two - on the contrary, there is a striking parallel.   The Court rejected these arguments, as they specifically rejected claims that children of gay people are any worse off than children of same-sex couples.     To preempt your next objection. Because adoption requires the government,   Gay people do not need to adopt to have kids. And this idea that the state's involvement in adoption is somehow a substitute for influence they have over married couples is… I don't even really get what you're saying.   The parallel really this simple:   Marriage is a fundamental right (Loving v. Virginia). Discriminating against people based on immutable characteristics (race, ethnicity, sexual orientation) is almost always unconstitutional, as is restricting fundamental rights, so the state has to have a really good reason. Arguments against interracial marriage were mostly moral (protect the white race, Biblical reasons, etc.), appeals to tradition, and concern for child welfare.  Sound familiar?"
ShitPoliticsSays,3bmwuf,garmonboziamilkshake,0,Tue Jun 30 22:06:07 2015 UTC,"The Supreme Court has no normative claims on me or anyone else, so let's get that out of the way before we progress any further. We discussing matters not as they are, but as they should be, hence why we continue talking past Obergefell    You don't have to have kids to get married. It's not a requirement, or a prerequisite, it doesn't even capture a host of rights that marriage confers.   All rights that marriage involve fall under the category of either parental rights or incentives to maintain the union, which wouldn't refute my child based argument.    You seem to be implying that it's the only basis the state has to claim for granting marriage rights.   Emphatically it is. The state has no interest one way or another in the behaviors of two consenting individuals. Those are what J.S. Mill called ""Self-regarding"" behaviors. If the state casts off its interest in children it follows that whether two people love each other and wear rings and eat cake is of no concern to it.   Appeals to child welfare are neither new nor exclusive to the same-sex marriage debate.   This whole section is irrelevant. The only child welfare argument I'm making is to compare children of unwed parents to wed parents, which is so incredibly thoroughly established.    ""Gay people do not need to adopt to have kids. And this idea that the state's involvement in adoption is somehow a substitute for influence they have over married couples.""   For the purpose of ensuring your intellectual honesty, I'm going to insist you agree that not allowing gay marriages pre-IVF and pre-egg donation/surrogate mothers was legitimate. Otherwise we haven't established the centrality of the state's interest in the child and the IVF/Surrogate rabbit hole isn't worth pursuing.   Re Adoption, you're right. The state has far more influence in the destiny of a child with an adoption than with a married couple's child. It can insist you show you are financially stable, that you have no criminal history, etc before it permits you to have a child. The tools are far stronger than those it does/could have for advancing the interests of a child born of intimacy between two parents who wish to keep him.   And for various reasons as listed above, your parallel section is bunk."
ShitPoliticsSays,3bmwuf,FleetSevens,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:43:33 2015 UTC,"Just to be clearer, I didn't ask how you think matters should be--  I'm saying that the claims/rights/arguments of an interracial couple seeking the right to a state-sanctioned marriage are quite comparable to those made by gay couples.  In your opinion, protection of the children is the only interest the state has in 'blessing' a marriage contract.  Where kids aren't present, the state has no interest one way or another. (E.g., the elderly shouldn't be granted a marriage).  You seem to be arguing that marriage is a kind of governmental intrusion society puts up with so the government can protect kids, characterizing all of marriage's benefits purely as incentives to encourage people to wed and stay married.  I imagine this reflects your larger worldview on government and its role.  Terrific. I wasn't having that discussion.   I suppose someone whose only basis for supporting interracial marriage were 'the kids will be fine, government, rest assured' - might have a harder time arguing for gay marriage before gays were allowed to adopt and IVF/etc.  You can go find him/her and call him/her intellectually dishonest if they advocate for gay marriage several decades ago.  But the facts are that the arguments historically made to oppose interracial marriage (health of kids, stigma toward kids, morality of society, tradition) are the same ones that have been made against gay marriage (and were made in courts).  Comparing them isn't dishonest - it's obvious."
ShitPoliticsSays,3bmwuf,garmonboziamilkshake,2,Wed Jul 1 02:56:43 2015 UTC,"Perhaps similar superficially, but not in validity. The arguments supporting gay marriage sound very similar to arguments for man-horse marriage (Doesn't hurt you, about love, children not part of the equation etc,), but that has little to do with the actual validity of arguments for gay marriage. That's the guilt by association fallacy. The extreme examples on both sides pertain only in so far as the principles behind one side or another permit those extreme views, which my purpose was in demonstrating that such is not so."

Anyway the argument that SCOTUS can overrule in one case but it is a state's right in the other, because interracial marriage is not exactly the same thing as homosexual marriage, is not compelling and lacks legal backing and even basic reason."
ShitPoliticsSays,3bmwuf,cpill,12,Tue Jun 30 15:54:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not having it both ways. Personally, I think government should get out of the marriage business entirely and just give contracts to any couple/group of consenting adults. But as far as this case is concerned, gay and interracial marriage is not apples to apples. As far as I'm aware, Western society has always viewed marriage as a heterosexual institution. So a ban on interracial marriage violates the Equal Protection Clause while a ban on gay marriage does not. Given the definition of marriage, before Friday's decision any adult male could marry and adult female, thus the 14th Amendment was not violate. So the gay rights activists were not fighting for marriage equality in my view because it already existed, but rather they were fighting to redefine marriage. I don't have a problem with this, but I think they should have been intellectually honest and open about their true motives."

America being a part of Western society gives historical context to how marriage has been defined. I'm not trying to make a value judgement. I am simply pointing out that if one accepts the traditional definition of marriage, then marriage equality did in fact exist before Friday's decision but did not exist when interracial bans were in place."
ShitPoliticsSays,3bmwuf,Aurailious,-10,Tue Jun 30 19:38:08 2015 UTC,Western society now considers marriage as being valid whether it is heterosexual or homosexual.

ShitPoliticsSays,3bmwuf,cpill,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:36:59 2015 UTC,Being correct in a historical context doesn't always make it right.  Slavery was acceptable in a historical context.  But by saying that marriage was only heterosexual in a historical context is just moving the goal lines.  Interracial marriage only began to change in the past century.  Why does that make it right now?  The argument for traditionalism falls apart when society is clearly changing.  When the current interpretation of marriage is no longer between a man and a women of the same race and class and all the other restriction the past has made for it.  The current interpretation by society is between two consenting adults.

In the universe where I live, however, the Supreme Court has adopted a complicated set of decision rules for determining whether a state law offends the constitution. And under those rules, state laws that burden racial/ethnic minorities are scrutinized more harshly (i.e., are more likely to be struck-down by the court) than state laws that burden sexual minorities.

And with a republican congress he wants to play to his strengths.     and if history has taught us anything, it's that's firsts are almost always deified.   First to give us a nuclear Iran?  First to oversee hardline Islamic takeovers in multiple nations in the middle east?  First to weaponize the IRS?  First to use Obamacare to target his political enemies (free contraceptive mandate)?  First to override bankruptcy proceedings so that union workers came out on top?  The list goes on and on ...  But I think they are on to something.  History as a profession is getting more and more politicized (funny how that almost always means liberal).  We are in a society where any random liberal history professor is considered more of an expert on the ""true intentions"" of the Reagan administration than people who were cabinet members in it.  I would not be surprised if my grandkid's textbooks teach them that Bush was the American Hitler (or perhaps that Hitler was the German Bush) and that Obama was the second coming.  Perhaps they'll also be told to report on any fellow classmates who disagree with that, but we'll wait to see what 2016 brings."

In 2009, the deficit was $1.4 trillion.  So, the tax cuts and spending didn't catch up until the last year of Bush's presidency and the first year of Obama's?  Maybe it was from a massive bailout and recession.  I would certainly hope  the deficit would fall after an all time high.    The deficit in 2014, of $483 billion, was still higher than the 2008 deficit, which I believe was Bush's highest deficit outside of the disaster in 2009.  I don't even care for Dubya.  You're just being dishonest.  Edit: grammar"

If you're referring to the article I linked, it says pretty clearly:   Obama has been in office since Jan 21, 2009, and is currently (as of this writing) still in office. The deficit at the end of 2009 (Last budget under Bush) was $1.4 trillion Although the original budget under Bush would have only resulted in a $407 billion deficit (a reduction from the 2008 deficit of $459 billion) the decreased revenue from the recession (half a trillion less revenue and $600 billion more in spending in 2009 than in 2008), and added spending from the 2008 TARP [7] and 2009 Stimulus [8] increased the deficit to $1.4 trillion.

Its going to be there in the history books saying he did all this despite having to deal with a difficult congress.  And history is probably going to blow over the NSA and drone war things because that is very likely going to be the future of intel and war.

Unthorough research; seemingly poor reading comprehension, unable to understand the SC declaration of secession was specifically about Northern states disobeying Full Faith and Credit, even if slavery was a key issue*; poisoning the well every chance the author gets (""The erratic anti-feminist and purposefully politically incorrect Gavin McInnes"", ""...said McInnes, who was born in England and grew up in Canada"", ""McInnes’ Twitter profile shows a man staring intently with eyes crossed, which captures the accuracy of tweet"")... ironic coming from a website billing itself as an impartial review of politicians' outrageous claims against fact.  * reprint from here:   We hold that the Government thus established is subject to the two great principles asserted in the Declaration of Independence; and we hold further, that the mode of its formation subjects it to a third fundamental principle, namely: the law of compact. We maintain that in every compact between two or more parties, the obligation is mutual; that the failure of one of the contracting parties to perform a material part of the agreement, entirely releases the obligation of the other; and that where no arbiter is provided, each party is remitted to his own judgment to determine the fact of failure, with all its consequences.  In the present case, that fact is established with certainty. We assert that fourteen of the States have deliberately refused, for years past, to fulfill their constitutional obligations, and we refer to their own Statutes for the proof.  The Constitution of the United States, in its fourth Article, provides as follows: ""No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.""  This stipulation was so material to the compact, that without it that compact would not have been made. The greater number of the contracting parties held slaves, and they had previously evinced their estimate of the value of such a stipulation by making it a condition in the Ordinance for the government of the territory ceded by Virginia, which now composes the States north of the Ohio River.  The same article of the Constitution stipulates also for rendition by the several States of fugitives from justice from the other States.  The General Government, as the common agent, passed laws to carry into effect these stipulations of the States. For many years these laws were executed. But an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution. The States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa, have enacted laws which either nullify the Acts of Congress or render useless any attempt to execute them. In many of these States the fugitive is discharged from service or labor claimed, and in none of them has the State Government complied with the stipulation made in the Constitution. The State of New Jersey, at an early day, passed a law in conformity with her constitutional obligation; but the current of anti-slavery feeling has led her more recently to enact laws which render inoperative the remedies provided by her own law and by the laws of Congress. In the State of New York even the right of transit for a slave has been denied by her tribunals; and the States of Ohio and Iowa have refused to surrender to justice fugitives charged with murder, and with inciting servile insurrection in the State of Virginia. Thus the constituted compact has been deliberately broken and disregarded by the non-slaveholding States, and the consequence follows that South Carolina is released from her obligation."
ShitPoliticsSays,3b95ys,dval92,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:26:28 2015 UTC,"I actually kind of agree with this. For most of history, slavery hasn't been a formal institution but an informal system of indebtedness. Slaves have, at times, been able to earn an income and buy their freedom.  What the Civil War abolished was most forms of formal slavery. Note, the Constitutional amendment still allows slavery as a form of punishment for a crime.  Clearly, some people, who are too poor or dependent to move elsewhere are still effectively financial slaves to their employers. The big difference is at least now there's some element of a meritocracy. It's may be difficult, but someone born to a poor family can work hard and rise up the social latter without fear of their employer taking all their money and literally putting them in shackles."

That cuts your profit immensely, and in order for it to be worth running a business you'll have to estimate your future profits to be considerably more than 120k a year.   This is hard, especially for small businesses, to achieve. Thus, you don't open your restaurant.  While you are leaving an opening, that opening needs to be more lucrative than any competing job opportunities. In the same way that individuals compete with each other for jobs, companies compete with each other and the possibility of entrepreneurship for employees. A hostile tax law means that the opening we generated after businesses leave will be less profitable to fill. People will chose to remain in stable jobs and big companies will refuse to come to America.   In a world of infinite resources, yes, companies would come to America as long as there is some money to be made. But we live in a world in which companies have finite resources, and they spend those resources on the most profitable endeavors. Taxing the shit out of businesses out of hatred guarantees that operating in America will not be one of the most profitable endeavors."

If what Sanders wants would pass and businesses are now taxed to death, why bother opening in the US at all when you could just as easily afford to do it overseas, make about the same money, and not pay as many taxes?  Add to that that most new businesses fail.  This will be even more true after a huge tax increase.  Some businesses would crop up.  But you have to understand, it would take several years for it to happen in which time all the big money would be leaving the US and taking a bunch of jobs with it.  It's pretty much a worse case scenario to be in.  Look up what happened to France when they tried it if you want to see first hand, it hurt them badly."

I hope they realize the ramifications this rule will have on our 10th Amendment and every other piece of sovereign State legislation.   Their excuse about interpreting ""Exchanges"" under Section 18031, as a federal requirement is entirely dishonest. You can look at section 18031 yourself, its entirely about individual State exchanges.  Subsection (a) of the section talks about financial assistance to the States to establish exchanges.

Anyone saying it was a typo or mistake is being disingenuous. The Court's opinion seems to suggest that, ex-post, with many states having not gone along with the plan, doing away with the subsides would fail to achieve the goals of the legislation, so the passage needs to be interpreted in the way most favorable to the success of the ACA.

Secondly, Dunham did some weird stuff when she was 7 years old, whereas Duggar molested his sisters when he was 14 years old.  The fact that that you would compare the actions of a 7 year old to those of a 14 year old shows how desperately grabbing at straws you are.

I put on a big show of saying no, taking pleasure in watching her beg and sulk, but eventually I always relented. Her sticky, muscly little body thrashed beside me every night as I read Anne Sexton, watched reruns of SNL, sometimes even as I slipped my hand into my underwear to figure some stuff out.  I could hash out the criminal-code of NY state, or you could take my word for it that this counts as a class D Felony.  S 130.65 Sexual abuse in the first degree.

That's why the appeals to global dynamics don't make a lick of sense, especially the ones that call the US parties right-wing.

Yes, the greed of wealthy people has completely fucked over and destroyed the middle class in America. But the ""wealthy people"" aren't those the leftists think of. It's the John Corzines, the Banking CEOs, the Ben Bernankes, and the ""wealthy"" politicians that are all in the same ""club"" that are the greedy ones destroying everything.   GREED and the pursuit of money is what caused Congress to get rid of the Glass-Steagal Act in the 90s. At the behest of banking CEOs and their Lobbyists. Now the banks can use the money in your checking and savings account as collateral to gamble with when they 'invest' in derivatives, credit default swaps, and other extremely convoluted and shady banking practices that are new and highly unregulated (mostly because most people, including the SEC, do not understand how they work).   Greed of the Govt caused the Congress to force banks to give ""sub-prime"" mortgages, to which the banks bundled up and sold off, cleverly marketed as ""mortgage backed securities"". The Credit Bureaus lied and labeled them as ""AAA rated!"". When really when 20/20 vision CLEARLY defines them as highly-toxic assets. Usually these mortgage backed securities were bundled with other assets in order to obfuscate their danger.   The results were absolutely catastrophic when it came time to pay the piper.   To save the Banking System and, essentially, the entire Western economic system (quite literally, no joke, no exaggeration), they bailed out the banks. They injected hundreds of billions of dollars in order to try and get the banks solvent and to get them to start issuing loans again to get the gears of the economy working again. It hasn't happened.   The money was spend by the big banks to gobble up the smaller banks. BECAUSE GREED. Just like BoA gobbled up WaMu. Now there are only 5 big banks left, where there were about 20 a few years earlier.   No new lines of credit are being opened up. Businesses know what's up and are not expanding. They are taking profits and, instead of expanding their business like ""normal"" economics classes tell you they would, they are re-investing that profit into their stock to keep the stock prices up, the dividend yields higher, and protecting the core of their companies. Because they know the artificial nature and ""synthetic-ness"" of the market today. They are limiting their exposure while still retaining the profitability for the CEOs, major share holders, and others. Layoffs, wage increases, benefits, and other worker compensations are still being attended to in the manner of the recession/depression we are ACTUALLY in.   Main Street is in a depression, Wall Street is in a Boom time. The FED and the Greed of the bankers/politicians have effectively de-coupled the two.   So no, the liberal definition of ""wealthy"" (i.e. anyone that's white, has two cars, and a home) and their ""greed"" isn't the problem. The problem is the greed of the TRULY wealthy (the politicians and the ""donor class"" of people in America). The Warren Buffets, the Jamie Diamonds, the George Soroses, etc. THOSE are the .0001% of the population. They are the ones that are causing all this."

It's the conglomerate effect. Because they're hailed as this wonderful way to hedge risk ---- but they're also used to speculate. So when you have $75 TRILLION in derivatives exposure like Deutsche bank has ---- it's easy to see how it becomes a problem. Someone will ALWAYS be left holding the bag when it all comes down.   This derivatives game is as complicated as the Gordian Knot. What ""should"" be simple, is not. Simply because it's become so labyrinthine and complex that no one really knows how far down the rabbit hole these things go. Derivatives on derivatives.......on top of other derivatives.......DERIVED from other derivatives. Basically people taking hedging against hedging against hedging.   Put options and derivatives are used by O&G companies (and the banks that lend them the money) a lot to cover the financing and costs for their year.   I can't even believe this conversation has to take place. Most economic analysts readily admit the huge nuclear chain reaction that is the derivatives game on the stock market. This whole Greece thing and it's sovereign debt has opened up a lot of dialogue on just how ridiculously fragile this whole fabricated and rigged economy is --- mostly thought credit default swaps and other DERIVATIVES.

Because the derivatives cancel each other out.  Deutsche is a market maker.  They take both sides of a bet, and charge a small premium.  You want to go long on the S&P 500?  Someone else wants to short the S&P 500?  Deutsche will take both sides, and profit regardless of which derivative pays off.  They offset each other."

Like I said in a previous post, they do ""mathematically"", but the problem is that that only happens if they are dealt with individually. Unfortunately, that's not the case with reality. If some major market play happens that forces mass margin calls, then it will cause them to implode. There is no possible way you can cover the debt of HALF of $75 Trillion ($37.5 Trillion). Not even a fraction of that would be able to be liquid.   The problem with derivatives is that they are quickly added up and no bank on the planet --- even ALL the banks on the planet --- are liquid enough to handle a meltdown of that proportion. It's the same thing that happens in a bank run.........only in electronic format. Chain reaction ensues.......entire system is destroyed.   We all saw what happened on Sept 11th 2008: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sxz6gYIiFHc  That's the problem with fractional reserve banking --- It's fine if done in moderation, the problem is that people are so fucking greedy they will risk everything to get some ""easy money"" and will fuck everyone else over in the process. And now they get to play with the money in YOUR accounts."
ShitPoliticsSays,3arp5y,ChefBoyAreWeFucked,3,Wed Jun 24 00:46:15 2015 UTC,"This has nothing to do with fractional reserve banking.  Money market accounts are also completely unrelated.  There was a run on money market funds because some of them held Lehman debt.  Money market funds were (and, unfortunately, still are) seen as extremely safe investments, so once there was a tiny bit of blood in the water, people started to panic.  In the end, only one fund actually broke the buck in the crisis, and it had nothing to do with derivatives directly.  The fear was caused because for a money market fund to break the buck, only 0.50% of its holdings needs to default (Holdings are priced at amortized cost, and income is distributed daily).  Money market funds aren't even bank accounts.  The biggest danger with derivatives is cases like AIG, where the derivatives are hedged solely via diversification.  AIG wrote credit default swaps, which rose in value as the debt they covered became distressed.  The idea was, it was extremely unlikely that more than a few would become distressed at once.  This is what caused AIG to falter, due to the margin calls.  It's worth noting that AIG stopped writing these contracts years before the crisis, but was left with legacy contracts on their books.  This ruling goes into detail in how things happened.  TL;DR: the government profited in the bailout.  This doesn't matter directly, since the government can print and destroy money at will, but it does indicate that AIG's crisis was one of liquidity.  Actual losses were not what brought AIG to its knees.  Completely unrelated, but I'm including it anyway, below is the conclusion of the case, because it made me laugh, however uncomfortably.   As the Court noted during closing arguments, a troubling feature of this outcome is that the Government is able to avoid any damages notwithstanding its plain violations of the Federal Reserve Act. Closing Arg., Tr. 69-70. Any time the Government saves a private enterprise from bankruptcy through an emergency loan, as here, it can essentially impose whatever terms it wishes without fear of reprisal. Simply put, the Government often may ignore the conditions and restrictions of Section 13(3) knowing that it will never be ordered to pay damages. With some reluctance, the Court must leave that question for another day. The end point for this case is that, however harshly or improperly the Government acted in nationalizing AIG, it saved AIG from bankruptcy. Therefore, application of the economic loss doctrine results in damages to the shareholders of zero.    Another TL;DR: The government clearly violated the law, and your argument to that fact is completely valid, but you are not entitled to damages, and neither will anyone else be in your same situation.  This ruling that the government broke the law also does not prevent them from breaking the law again."

Whether creationism or evolution is true doesn't matter much to me or most of the other people I know.

In college I studied politics, and learned a lot from professors regardless of their personal political persuasion (much less theological).  As far as YEC, I personally agree that theism doesn't have to contradict evolution (or vice versa), but from the outside, applying so many resources to a generally discredited idea (that the earth is 5-6000 years ago) seems to prioritize 'proving the Bible' and theology above objective scientific inquiry.  To some people that calls into question the school's agenda (just like people challenge the content of 'liberal' schools based on their apparent agendas)."

I'm just sick of people attacking Liberty (and conservatives in general) on reddit, and the usual responses I get are quite vitriolic and irrational. I can understand why people don't like it, but honestly is it any worse than public universities that have women's studies classes and other things of such ilk?  I'd put that up there as just as bad as YEC teaching if not worse (as it seems to affect people more greatly). I just wish education in America wasn't about taking stances and was more about showing people both sides of arguments and issues and letting them decide. Instead we get people using education as a method of pushing their beliefs (whether they be liberal or conservative)."

I count my friends and family (and even former girlfriends) on a very diverse political/religious/ethnic spectrum, and while I tend to confront ignorance when I see it, I'm much more interested in learning what I didn't know from an open-minded person with views, background or information different from mine.  I appreciate your candor and class.   women's studies classes and other things of such ilk   I understand your comparison - I do - the distinction I think one might draw is that 'hard science' in general is supposed to be apolitical, objective, based on data (I understand in practice that's not always the case).  Social sciences (sociology, anthropology, psychology identity studies, etc.) are almost by definition about politics and ideas, and inherently subjective (despite their attempts to use statistical data, etc.).  That being said,, I understand your complaint, and the notion that public universities especially should reflect the spectrum of their taxpayers carries weight with me (there are issues about religion/government, but they're not prohibitive).  And I wholeheartedly sign onto your statement:   I just wish education in America wasn't about taking stances and was more about showing people both sides of arguments and issues and letting them decide.

When you account for geography, according to Enten's article, 90% of lawmakers from states that were in the Union during the Civil War supported the bill compared with less than 10% of lawmakers from states that were in the Confederacy.  Enten points out that Democrats still played a key role in getting the law passed.

ShitPoliticsSays,3am6ej,StormtrooperCaptain,0,Sun Jun 21 20:07:34 2015 UTC,"Do you actually believe it's a myth?  Lee Atwater, adviser to Reagan and George HW specifically admitted it:   As to the whole Southern strategy that Harry S. Dent, Sr. and others put together in 1968, opposition to the Voting Rights Act would have been a central part of keeping the South. Now [the new Southern Strategy of Ronald Reagan] doesn't have to do that. All you have to do to keep the South is for Reagan to run in place on the issues he's campaigned on since 1964 and that's fiscal conservatism, balancing the budget, cut taxes, you know, the whole cluster.   …   You start out in 1954 by saying, “Nigger, nigger, nigger.” By 1968 you can’t say “nigger”—that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.… “We want to cut this,” is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than “Nigger, nigger.”   Then Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman (who helped elect and worked for George W) actually APOLOGIZED to the NAACP for it:   ""Some Republicans gave up on winning the African-American vote, looking the other way or trying to benefit politically from racial polarization,"" Mehlman said at the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ""I am here today as the Republican chairman to tell you we were wrong.""   Not all Republicans are racist, and plenty of Democrats are, but you seem to be as misinformed or delusional as a left-wing radical."

ShitPoliticsSays,3am6ej,Muffinator4,-1,Mon Jun 22 17:05:03 2015 UTC,"he was talking to the conservative democrats   No, Atwater was talking to a political scientist at Case-Western, claiming that racism would no longer be a reason for Southern Republicans.  He was wrong, at least as recently as 2009.  Atwater himself knew what he was admitting (and so many here seem to be denying), which is why he specifically said to the interviewer:    “Now, y’all aren't quoting me on this?”    (The interviewer didn't quote him but years later the tape was outed.)  At least Atwater and you acknowledge that the Republicans played on Southern Democrats' racism to earn votes and that the Southern Strategy is by no means a myth.   Hopefully you'll downvote the incorrect statement above that I replied to (or set him straight since you seem to know it's incorrect).   pretty sure   Pretty convincing"

To me, and I think most conservatives, anti-intellectualism is a stance against the idea that the intelligentsia of our nation, the professors found largely in humanities departments, should have a disproportionate influence on deciding policy. Now, I have no problem with the president bringing in a bunch of economics professors to advise him on international trade relations (even if that council includes Paul Krugman). What I do have a problem with is an American studies professor telling people that the capitalist system we have is inherently flawed and needs to be severely regulated, and if I have an issue with what they're saying it's because my white male privilege doesn't allow me to understand the plight of the lower class.   It was American academia that supported disarmament before WWII during Hitler's rise. Support for socialist and communist policies and states come largely from those who are highly educated. I have a massive problem with Noam Chomsky, a man whose expertise is in linguistics, saying America should let Iran develop a nuclear weapon. Clearly, the intelligentsia can be very wrong on a host of issues.  I have no problem with professors advising on their own areas of expertise, but a degree in English literature or linguistics does not give your views on international relations any more weight.    This is anti-intellectualism in my view.  When the left uses the phrase ""anti-intellectualism"" (or just on reddit), they use it to mean ""anti-knowledge"" or ""anti-being smart"". Obviously, this is nonsense, as I can hardly imagine anyone advocating not knowing things as a way to form our policy."

ShitPoliticsSays,3aggxt,mrbobsthegreat,10,Fri Jun 19 23:18:07 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting read in the context of what Sowell discusses in The Quest for Cosmic Justice.   Liberals are almost always classified in their belief in the quest for Social (or what Sowell calls Cosmic) Justice. They see any inequality in the outcomes among racial and economic classes and being caused by systematic injustice. Their beautiful vision of the world elevates them to the level of righteous caretaker of the poor impoverished masses and defender against the oppressors (who can be identified by their not holding the vision of social justice).    Notice how a claim like ""gun restriction laws would prevent violent death"" can be tested empirically. We can look at all fifty states, categorize them by the severity of their gun laws, and then look at their corresponding violent death rates (or gun-related deaths).   Regardless of where we imagine the results would lie, we could indeed test this.   The problem though is that the liberals see no need to test their beautiful vision of social justice. The intentions are good enough to justify changing the complicated legal framework of individual liberties we have. The fact that Democrat/liberal cities like New York, Detroit, and Chicago lead the nation in the number of violent deaths is of no concern to them (per-capita deaths give different results, but this only goes to show the complexity of the issue at hand, which the liberals conveniently ignore). We're dealing with testable hypotheses here.   But, the believers in the cosmic vision of social justice rarely think to test their claims. Instead, their vision places them as the defenders of all those poor black folk who are being preyed upon by ""the system"" or ""society"" (no on ever seems to care that society is literally our civilization, so an attack on society is an attack on civilization). This self-flattering vision is places them in such a position of power, that it's difficult to remove oneself from it.   Anyone who disagrees with their views about the effectiveness of gun laws isn't just misinformed about the statistics, in their minds we are bad people who support the destruction of black families and communities. Our opposition to their cosmic vision of the world places us in the role of villain, and necessarily, part of the oppression they are fighting."

They seem to read a headline about a specific situation, and then apply it to everything because they don't really understand it. Yes, gerrymandering happens quite often, but they seem to think that every Republican victory was a result of it.   My favorite instance of /r/politics throwing around phrases they don't understand was a year or two ago with the logical fallacy trend. A video gets posted where Jon Stewart calls a guy out for an ad hominem (he was actually correct), and then literally every other post was ""strawman!"" ""ad hominem!"" ""tu quoque!"" Yet, 90% of the time, the fallacy they were trying to claim didn't even come close to applying.   It's just a trend. Claiming ""gerrymandering"" gets upvotes, so people just repeat it for karma despite not understanding it, just like the logical fallacy trend. They'll eventually move on to another claim of how Republicans cheat their way to every victory."

That $20 in your wallet? Now it's $20,000. Franklin burning a hole in your pocket? You bet he is with the new $100,000,000 bill. That means more money for Americans to spend, and when Americans spend more, the economy gets better. Plus, they'll pay more taxes. More money for schools and roads."

ShitPoliticsSays,3a7coy,Dixzon,7,Thu Jun 18 00:58:01 2015 UTC,"Nazi Germany was a fascist state long before the U.S. entered WWII.  Many elected officials lauded Hitler's support of industry and tradition in Germany that revived the economy.  We didn't know about any of the discrimination, the secret mobilization, the totalitarianism, etc  When we did enter the war, we entered two years after Germany invaded Poland.  We didn't even get mobilized until months afterwards.  Japan attacked our shores, and we realized that the threat of the Axis Powers was international, and not something the Allies across the pond could manage.  So there's a mere primer on the U.S. entrance into World War II.  I could keep going, if you're interested, but I just really wanted to clear up the misconception that the U.S. entered the war because we didn't like fascism.  For a time, we actually thought fascism was a good thing!  Hell, it didn't take until after the war before we even realized the full extent of what fascism entailed (when we discovered the Holocaust)."

People in government and business leaders definitely knew about it, they just didn't really care. Germany's mobilization was far from secret - they re-occupied the rhineland in 1936, a full 3 years before invading Poland. GB and France (and the US) just did not want to get involved in another war, so they let Germany slide, until the prospect of war breaking out became inevitable."

ShitPoliticsSays,3a7coy,SonsofAnarchy113,9,Wed Jun 17 21:33:32 2015 UTC,"It doesn't go away, but it makes it more difficult. Socialism requires a closed system, so the state must make the cost of resistance as high as possible. For example, the emergence of private, informal markets inevitably erodes the state's control over the economy, so access to goods must be controlled. The existence of ideological competitors (e.g. fascists or liberals) exercising freedom of speech will undermine the legitimacy of the ruling socialist party, so political opposition must be jailed or executed. Allowing freedom of movement will cause grave losses in human capital (intellectuals fleeing to other countries), so border troops that shoot on sight are necessary.  Socialists are willing to accept gross infringements on human rights and liberty because that is the only way their belief system can function in the real world."

North Carolina, in which Roberts made a decision that says that a police officers belief that something might be illegal makes a search and seizure permissible under the Fourth Amendment. This has the effect, with regards to mistaken beliefs created by ambiguous law, of preventing courts from deciding what a statue actually means, and simply deciding whether the officers belief was reasonable. It also prevents innocent civilians from being able to frame their behavior in a way that prevents unwanted contact with the police. 5-3-1 decision.   There's a sample.   The Supreme Court is designed to be the most distant from public opinion, but not removed from it, and it's clear from the already existing partisan divide on the Supreme Court that there are some pretty stark differences in judicial philosophy and opinion and it is entirely reasonable to support a range of candidates over another because you like one side of that more."

National Security Advisor John Poindexter was convicted of five counts of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, perjury, defrauding the government, and the alteration and destruction of evidence.  Duane Clarridge. An ex-CIA senior official, he was indicted in November 1991 on seven counts of perjury and false statements relating to a November 1985 shipment to Iran. PARDONED by George HW before trial. Richard V. Secord. Ex-major general in the Air Force who organized the Iran arms sales and Contra aid. He pleaded guilty in November 1989 to making false statements to Congress and was sentenced to two years of probation. Albert Hakim, businessman, pleaded guilty in November 1989 to supplementing the salary of North by buying a $13,800 fence for North with money from ""the Enterprise"", which was a set of foreign companies Hakim used in Iran-Contra. In addition, Swiss company Lake Resources Inc., used for storing money from arms sales to Iran to give to the Contras, plead guilty to stealing government property.

ShitPoliticsSays,39v1be,Dranosh,6,Mon Jun 15 16:56:24 2015 UTC,So how does two or three consenting adults getting married (incest or otherwise) harm anyone? Isn't that the same argument that gay marriage proponents were making?
ShitPoliticsSays,39v1be,ShieldoftheWolf,4,Mon Jun 15 01:33:52 2015 UTC,"Children born of incest have around a 45% chance of being born with birth defects, compared to 5-7% of non-incest relationships.  Those that are in polygamous relationships generally tend to need more money for support of their families, and rely a lot on government assistance, and at times abuse welfare programs. In polygamous societies, male children are generally also shunned if they are not deemed worthy, because of pure supply and demand of female partners. In these societies, birth defects are extremely prevalent, as they tend to practice incest of some sort, and some of these communities have more cases of extremely rare birth defects that cause mental retardation, than the entire world combined. These mentally retarded children are shunned from their society if they are male, and if they are female, are generally abused.  In both of these cases, their practices are literally harming their children at extreme rates compared to the rest of society. And if you want to go the lefty route of thinking of things, they put more of a burden on our healthcare system, and welfare programs than others.  I support gay marriage, however, the gay movement is basing their views upon ""Why should the state decides who loves each other!? Why should they stop consenting adults!?"" There are some people that believe by using that argument, the state ultimately has no say on who can or cannot get married, therefore opens up a can of worms on other relationships, such as incest, or polygamy, which can and does harm people and the state. And, there is no rational way to say incest or polygamy relationships are not allowed, without the state having a vested interest in who they allow to do what, which means the state can say gay people can't get married, if they want."
ShitPoliticsSays,39v1be,YankeeQuebec,3,Mon Jun 15 04:17:44 2015 UTC,Marriage hasn't had anything to do with children for a long time.
ShitPoliticsSays,39v1be,ShieldoftheWolf,3,Mon Jun 15 04:33:43 2015 UTC,"In your mind, what is the point of marriage then?"
ShitPoliticsSays,39v1be,YankeeQuebec,6,Mon Jun 15 04:47:03 2015 UTC,Tax breaks
ShitPoliticsSays,39v1be,___ok,4,Mon Jun 15 05:22:20 2015 UTC,"Well, there is still no case. If your basing on allowing gay people to marry, so that they get tax breaks of opposite sex marriages, then you pretty much have no case.  SCOTUS has ruled multiple times that at each level of government, government can discriminate on who gets tax breaks and advantages, as long as extreme minorities aren't discriminated against. Since there are a lot of single people, and married couples, telling gay people they can't be married for tax purposes is completely in their jurisdiction, as they are just treated as single people, which is not an extreme minority, and they are in fact being treated as a majority.  If you want to say that it's because of tax issues, you would have a better argument against marriage as a whole, as treating married couples, who decided to partner up over completely arbitrary decisions, is more discriminatory to most people, than gay people not being allowed.  That argument would fall flat on it's face to the government, as taxes are about the only thing the government is allowed to treat anyone differently over. And, not allowing them to marry over tax breaks, doesn't mean they are treated any differently than single people, who can't marry themselves to get a tax break."
ShitPoliticsSays,39v1be,YankeeQuebec,2,Mon Jun 15 05:34:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not the guy you originally replied to (and I was really being facetious), but I will say I don't care if people get married. The government shouldn't have been involved in it to begin with, but the states (or I guess counties) issue marriage licenses not the federal government. I think society has shifted so much since when those laws were created(I think the other guys point, marriage encouraging 2 people to get married, settle down, have a few kids), that's really beside the point though.   There should be a separation between the religious marriage(where you have a ceremony in church.. ""before God"" or whatever), and a legal union (where you get the tax breaks, marriage license, custody rights, etc.). That is the way to do it, cut out the bullshit and the government can regulate unions with their tax breaks or other benefits because it will then be a legislative issue, not a religious one. Just my two cents because I'm not married nor have any intention of getting married, but if I did it would only be for the tax breaks since I can do everything else without getting married."
ShitPoliticsSays,39v1be,___ok,2,Mon Jun 15 06:10:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely.  There are tons of churches out there, and it's near impossible to find one without an opinion on the issue; however, there are churches that both support and rebel against the issue, so, in the end, everybody wins."

ShitPoliticsSays,39v1be,jdw809,2,Mon Jun 15 07:11:29 2015 UTC,Would incest be a problem for the state or individuals if pregnancies with defects were aborted?
ShitPoliticsSays,39v1be,RoundSimbacca,2,Mon Jun 15 10:08:22 2015 UTC,"In that case, I suspect the cons outweigh the pros, and it would be better to just keep it illegal, than endorsing it and making something worse."
ShitPoliticsSays,39v1be,YankeeQuebec,2,Mon Jun 15 10:55:27 2015 UTC,"I am, of course, assuming that abortion remains legal, thus neither good nor bad in the eyes of the law.  So how could a neither good nor bad procedure make incest worse?"
ShitPoliticsSays,39v1be,RoundSimbacca,0,Mon Jun 15 11:00:33 2015 UTC,"If the law was that people in incestual relationships must get abortions, that means they get them themselves, or the state will ultimately be on the hook for them. This means that the state does have a vested interest in those types of relationships, and since it is a burden to the state, to either provide for them, or enforce the laws in someway.   To me, in this situation, it is a bad thing because you are now forcing the government into your bedroom, because they have more of a case to be in your procreative life since they are supporting something that can harm another life.  I don't know how old you are, but it wasn't very long ago where blood tests were required before marriage. This was to detect diseases that could spread, because the state had a vested interest to try to stop diseases by either treating people, or warning them of a disease to take precaution. Just like some of these diseases, becoming pregnant from incest does not happen because of one, two, or even three sexual contacts. However, the state does have a vested interest to stop the problem, before it becomes a problem, where is why prohibiting incestual relationships would be a no go."
ShitPoliticsSays,39v1be,YankeeQuebec,2,Mon Jun 15 11:21:14 2015 UTC,"I wasn't speaking of mandatory abortions, but voluntary ones to alleviate some of the social harm theory.  Why would government have the power to stop incestuous pregnancies, but not ban other relations if a pregnancy probably has a high chance of a defect?"
ShitPoliticsSays,39v1be,RoundSimbacca,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:32:49 2015 UTC,"The problem is that incestual relationships have been scientifically proven to increase the chance of problems, and a burden to society by magnitudes more than normal relationships.  It's also not a matter of a higher chance, because it's a 1/2 shot at severe and long lasting birth defects. Whereas in other relationships, birth defects are less severe, and occur at a rate of 1/20.  And, even if a person was born through an incestual relationship without any problems, they also pose a higher risk by above average problems even if they are in a normal relationship.  I'm still with the harm to individuals, and society, is much greater if you allow those types of relationships. We have almost 0% of those problems now, why would you even risk having more problems, when there are almost none."
ShitPoliticsSays,39v1be,YankeeQuebec,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:44:36 2015 UTC,"There are married couples that have strong genetic predispositions to diseases of 50% (for y-linked disorders), and 25% for x-linked ones. Should they be barred from marrying each other? Should they be barred from procreating?   If we don't allow eugenics to drive our policy in non-incest cases, why should we allow eugenics to bar incest?"
ShitPoliticsSays,39v1be,RoundSimbacca,2,Mon Jun 15 12:07:43 2015 UTC,"Polyamory is a different type of relationship.  It's much more different than two adults of the same-sex wanting to commit to to teach other in marriage.  Incest is different, as well.  There's already a relationship existing between the two people, both legally and biologically.  If incest is between an opposite-sex couple, a children could face severe genetic consequences due to inbreeding.  Numerous studies done on children of same-sex parents show that they experience no adverse affects as a result of the parent-to-child relationship.  However, there are more reported instances of harassment from people opposing the parents' union, so one could argue that homophobia does more harm than homosexuality, in this instance.  You do, however, bring up a good point: the Left is ridiculously unorganized in their arguments.  A lot of people don't know entirely what the situation is about.  Legal benefits (which would be different in polyamorous relationships and incestual ones), supporting and rearing a child, and societal biases against certain relationships all play a factor.  To purely make the argument ""love is   love"" is to oversimplify the issue when, contrary to the opinion of the left, it is a complex one, albeit one in which the reality of the situation happens to be in their favor."

Ben Jealous, who until a couple years ago headed the national NAACP is half-white, as is the president, but both consider themselves black and are accepted as such, though Obama's experience growing up isn't necessarily reflective of the black experience in this country.  Society has a one-drop policy, where anybody who is kinda black, maybe had a grandparent or something, they are considered black by society. That led people around Dolezal in Spokane to kind of give her the benefit of the doubt because, well, what if they were wrong? However, it was her parents who outed her."

ShitPoliticsSays,39oenv,Asshole_for_Karma,34,Sat Jun 13 21:08:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Bruce/ Caitlin Jenner is not a woman, nor will 'she' ever be one. Everyone has the right to pursue happiness, and if that's what makes her happy then best of luck, but surgery and hormone therapy don't change the fact that she will never possess a womb or mammary glands- the defining characteristics of female mammals.   And in my opinion, all that rhetoric about the difference in the terms ""female"" and ""woman"" can go right out the window. Triangles have three sides and human females are capable of reproduction- political correctness does not change physical reality."
ShitPoliticsSays,39oenv,Yahmahah,13,Sat Jun 13 06:23:17 2015 UTC,"Caitlin Jenner knows she'll never be biologically the same as a woman. She knows she'll never have the right chromosomes, the right internal organs, the right (naturally producing) hormones, or the other below the surface features of a woman. However, even though she was not born a woman, she wants to live her life as one, and I don't really think that's anyone's problem but her own. She knows people will still know her as Bruce, and that people will refer to her as a he, and that she can never be a 'genuine' female. I don't think people should refer to her as Caitlin because it's required or anything, but more as a sign of respect. She may technically be something between a man and a woman in a biological sense, but for all intent and purposes she is a transgender woman.   I like to think of it like, for example, the Mona Lisa. The Mona Lisa isn't a woman; it's a painting of a woman. She does not actually posses all of the features that make up a woman. She doesn't even have legs. She is a rendition of a woman, but for all intents and purposes she is referred to as a woman. It's the same for Caitlyn Jenner. Deep down she is not biologically a woman, but (ideally) when you see her she is supposed to read as a woman. She's a living rendition of a woman. She may not actually have a uterus, but when you look at her she does read as a woman much more than a man, so it makes sense to refer to her the way one would refer to a woman.  tl;dr- I think I half agree with you, but I also have a batshit crazy rationalization that doesn't fully agree with you.  As for the female=!woman thing, I don't really get that either. I've always heard them as interchangeable up until a few years ago. I get that female is sex and woman is gender but I don't think a transgender woman would be called a male in public, right? I don't really get it."
ShitPoliticsSays,39oenv,Asshole_for_Karma,3,Sat Jun 13 07:29:06 2015 UTC,"That is very well put, I am all for the personal respect that you are talking about. If I ever met her, I would absolutely refer to her as a female, simply out of respect for her wishes. I have no desire to upset people with my own beliefs- I may disagree with someone, but I'm not going to create an uncomfortable situation because of it.  The Mona Lisa analogy is especially relevant because there are theories that the Mona Lisa was DaVinci painting himself as a female. Maybe true, maybe not, we'll never know.  I think we agree: respect people, don't be a dick. But you are also allowed your own beliefs."
ShitPoliticsSays,39oenv,Dranosh,-13,Sun Jun 14 07:21:23 2015 UTC,"Simply because you don't understand a concept does not mean that a concept is wrong.   Trans men are men, trans women are women.

Though with many of the userbase of SPS having established their stances, I suspect that is not the case :/  But, before I am to link anything... I have a question, quickly: is Obama a 'SJW'? Even the US president can acknowledge the existence of trans people, he has met and praised Laverne Cox and Caitlyn Jenner. Many seem quick to call anyone that sticks up for trans people a 'SJW'."

Tight money is a traditionally right-wing policy anyway.  Of course there are exceptions like the far-left nation of Greece which would be entirely fucked no matter what happened with the ECB (although again tight money is not helping) and I'd be shocked if their welfare states were sustainable with their low trend growth and low population growth anyway, but things wouldn't be nearly as bad if monetary policy wasn't so horrendous there."

This is exactly what I'm talking about, though. The nations with high taxes and lots of welfare spending are doing worse than the others. People treat the Laffer curve like it's been totally disproven, but Greece is actually on the wrong side of it - their taxes are so high that people don't even pay them and the government can't afford to enforce them. Modern Monetary Theory is a thing that people with university educations actually believe, even though Greece and Spain would just be able to print more money if it were true.  I was also under the impression that the Eurozone crisis started due to the unsustainable levels of government debt, and that monetary policy just prolonged the crisis rather than causing it. Government debt in the EU has been a problem for almost 20 years - countries had trouble staying within the bounds of the Maastricht Treaty and had to securitize their revenue."

Did you really think that Obama will do those things?  1.) Sure, he'll pull us out. There's no reason not to, now that we've won and the Iraq government wants us out. Of course, he's a moron if we don't keep a base there. The middle east is way too volatile to not have a military presence nearby.  2.) He's said that he wanted to increase troop presence there. I'm not sure what you want him to do, but what exactly do you think we can accomplish now?  3.) Oh that's rich. He's proposed 500 billion in new spending. Taxing the rich and corporations certainly won't pay for it. Sure, we can cut defense spending, but aside from disbanding the military entirely, it won't pay for it either.  4.) He was for the bailout.  5.) Do you really think that he's going to give up some of his power now that he's in charge? Keep dreaming.  6.) See #5. Obama wants to create a civilian police force just as strong as the military. I know, let's call them ""fingermen"".   7.) He's fore more illegal immigration, and nationalizing the healthcare industry will certainly lower costs. Of course, it will very quickly also lower the quality of healthcare.  8.) If anything, he wants to expand the system. House democrats have floated the idea of seizing your 401k and dumping it into the system. Look for this to get a whole lot worse. The democrat base is all about handouts.   9.) See #8. This program will get expanded.   10.) The democrats won't want to give up power. The drug war lines the pockets of all politicians. Including Obama.  I agree. This will be more of the same with a much bigger price tag.   Things to look for in the first 100 days:  a.) Sweeping gun control legislation.  b.) An ""economic stimulus package"" to the tune of $500 billion or more.  c.) A move down the path towards the Fairness doctrine.  d.) Sweeping tax increases on the ""rich"" wich will begin the exodus of US capital away from this country and help stifle economic growth.  e.) Serious movement toward a ""Cap in trade system"" designed to bankrupt carbon producers. It will quickly result in massive energy cost increases and within 5 years cause nationwide brownouts.   f.) A capital gains tax increase.   g.) A move to bailout homeowners by refinancing their bad mortgages via the federal government. Of course, you'll be buying your house from the Federal government, but there's nothing wrong with the Fed owing most of the outstanding private property too, right?  f.) An end to the social security tax cap. Of course, that's a 14% tax increase on the income for those earning 100-250K. But Obama will explain how that isn't really a tax increase."

The real reason Bernie won't win the nomination:   Among white Democrats, 56 percent say Clinton will bring “real change,” compared to a whopping 81 percent of non-white Democrats, according to the WSJ/NBC survey. A CNN poll showed Sanders with 14 percent of the white vote, compared to 5 percent among non-white Democrats.  A Pew poll in March, before Clinton formally started her campaign, showed that 74 percent of black Democrats said there was a “good chance” they would back the former first lady. Only 54 percent of white Democrats agreed with that statement, with many of them (34 percent) opting with the less enthusiastic “some chance.”  Sanders disproportionate support among whites and liberals is an advantage early in the primary process because it starts in Iowa and New Hampshire, two overwhelmingly-white states. In Iowa, 93 percent of the Democratic electorate was white in 2008."

Taxing the crap out of everyone who makes a lot of money in a globalized economy doesn't make sense anymore. The flight of human and financial capital would be so fast it would make their head spin.  I do think the supercomputer transactions that take advantage of the market by knowing prices a millisecond before anyone else does is sketchy as all hell and doesn't seem to provide any benefit to the economy. Am willing to listen to counter arguments, though."
ShitPoliticsSays,3916qn,kier00,8,Mon Jun 8 15:09:03 2015 UTC,"I'll lay out an argument for why high-speed computerized trading is a benefit to the economy.   (1) High speed trading is largely focused on arbitrage opportunities. An arbitrage is basically when one can make money ""for free"" buy buying and selling the same product in two different markets, where that product is valued differently in those two markets. For example, take currency. Have you ever had the thought that you might be able exchange dollars for pounds, pounds for yen, and then back to dollars, and come out with more money than you originally had? This would be an example of arbitrage: the dollar to pound and pound to yen exchange rates were different in relation to each other.  Arbitrage is a result of what we call inefficiencies in the market. What these computers are doing is tying all of the prices together in relation to one another. In effect, this high-speed trading is a massive stabilizing force because it forces prices back to where they ""should be"" if the market were efficient.   High-speed trading creates a more efficient market.  (2) A great deal of mathematical finance and investing strategies make assumptions about the market that aren't necessarily true, but high-speed trading brings reality closer to those assumptions. If you are an individual investor, when you want to buy or sell a stock or option, you will certainly be able to that day. This is a result of all the transactions and fluidity of the market.   There are hedging strategies (hedging is a term that more or less means protecting yourself from loss) that demand purchasing stocks or options at precise prices at exact times. All the fluidity of the market with the high-speed trading means that the hedging strategies are possible. In the world of stock brokers screaming at each other, you couldn't employ sophisticated hedging strategies because a firm literally couldn't buy and sell stocks when then needed to.   (3) How the individual investor approaches the market is different from how a hedge fund or investment bank does. The best strategy for an individual investor is to buy some stocks of index funds and hold onto them for as long as possible. This strategy doesn't depend on having information milliseconds before your neighbor, and thus a great deal of high-speed trading is largely irrelevant to the individual."
ShitPoliticsSays,3916qn,deadjawa,8,Mon Jun 8 15:48:52 2015 UTC,"Well, the good news is that you've figured out why no one will ever take liberals seriously on the economy.  They've basically institutionalized the concept of legislating something without becoming educated in what you are legislating (pass the bill so we can see what's in it).  I mean, taxing the speed of stock trades to soak rich people would be like taxing the speed of the Internet to eliminate piracy.  Might as well just start carpet bombing data centers.  It would have the same effect, and at least then you'd be being honest about what you're intending to do."

I mean, if someone holds up a AR15 with a 30rnd mag and a mini 14 with a 30rnd mag and asks a liberal which one is more powerful, despite both being semi auto, firing the same bullet and having the same magazine capacity, they will pick the AR15 while the 'correct' answer is ""they are both the same."""

Also, the US isn't France.   Denial at its finest.  Capital flight would probably be WORSE in the US, not better, because we also have higher corporate and capital gains taxes than France (I believe our estate is higher too) and we are a historically low-moderate tax country (the rich in France were already used to pretty high taxes.)   More most Americans their tax rates are at historic lows, or at the very least near historic lows.    Looking at marginal federal level rates yes.

These people will go on and on about ""oh you were born into a richer family"" etc etc. Unless your parents are high up in a company and have the power to give you a job off the spot then that means nothing. You still have to work to get good grades and experience - it doesn't just come for free. And you know what the beauty is? Everyone can do that. Everyone gets free education up to 18 and can continue further. Some institutes of education are better than others, but what's stopping you learning by yourself by just reading through your books? The pure entitlement of these children is ridiculous. It's basically ""I didn't work hard in school and now have a crap job, but no, those that did and got good jobs didn't earn it, they only did that because they were born into a richer family"". That's funny, at university many of my friends come from pretty poor families. They just didn't sit on their arse all day complaining.

People in the middle and upper middle class are taught things that people in the lower classes are not: how to save money and how to invest it and make it grow; they typically have access the four-year universities, whereas the lower classes are funneled into the far inferior community college system; the upper and middle classes have access to lawyers and professional advisors, whereas the lower classes only have access to lawyers that are provided for them once they're on trial; there is a large list of perks to being a member of the upper and middle classes.   However, this does not mean that we need to take from the upper and middle classes in order to give to the poor. First of all, it is economically inefficient. Secondly, we have a right to keep the fruits of our labor, and that shouldn't be violated on whims inspired by ill-founded rhetoric. Third, everyone started in poverty. Poverty and inequality is the norm in human society. The question we should ask isn't ""why does economic stratification exist?"" The right question is ""how did some individuals become so wealthy in the first place?"" Besides those few individuals who make fortunes in their own lifetimes, most people rose from poverty through a process of passing their wealth on from generation to generation, sending their children to better schools than they went to, and providing their children a greater portion of the list of benefits then they had as children.   Modern liberal policy seeks to destroy the best method we have for lifting masses of people out of poverty. They seek to take the fruits of our labor via taxation, to take a portion of what we pass on to our children after our deaths, and they seek to put themselves in positions of power through affirmative action policies that prize diversity over capability, all the while they want to give a corrupt and militarily overwhelming institution the power to direct as much of our lives as possible.

The court knows more about  Constitutional law than either you or I do, and they ruled the Constitution's interstate commerce clause gives the government that explicit right to levy a tax for healthcare. Just because you dislike the ruling doesn't mean Constitution was violated."
ShitPoliticsSays,38poku,TooSunny,6,Sat Jun 6 20:40:23 2015 UTC,"You haven't finished thinking through the whole concept of what you just said. Yes, the Courts ruled that Obamacare was a tax. And where do all taxes originate?  Article I Section VII   All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.   These taxes did not originate from the House of Representatives but were inserted during the Senate review. It was exactly because of the ruling that the law was declared in the courts as a tax that it is unconstitutional.   That the Senate has more authority in levying taxes than the House is now precedence. The people are no longer represented."

ShitPoliticsSays,38poku,probablysalad,-1,Sat Jun 6 00:08:04 2015 UTC,I can't see how the emergence of Isis can be put solely on Barack Obama and his administration. Can someone please explain?
ShitPoliticsSays,38poku,wethedownvoted,10,Sat Jun 6 00:21:48 2015 UTC,"Obama created ISIS by failing to negotiate bases.  I was in Ramadi at the end of the occupation and things were looking up.  They were rebuilding and people were going about their lives.    Fallujah was the first city to fall and is about 20 miles from Ramadi.  ISIS literally took over the same buildings we had troops in when they subsequently took Ramadi.  Obama's critical failure to retain bases is the sole reason for the rise of ISIS.  You later claim ""we should never have been there in the first place"".  This is wrong.  Eventually Saddam would have shot down one of our fighters enforcing the no-fly zone and we'd have been forced into war.   I take it you're of the opinion Bush should have waited until then?  So you'd have your satisfying reason to comfort you at night?"
ShitPoliticsSays,38poku,bllasae,10,Sat Jun 6 20:46:26 2015 UTC,"Firstly, he left Iraq too early. Secondly, he's arming the opposition in Syria, which includes ISIS, directly or indirectly. So not completely his fault, but about 75% responsible for how ""powerful"" they are."
ShitPoliticsSays,38poku,probablysalad,0,Sat Jun 6 08:44:37 2015 UTC,"I feel like one could argue that we shouldn't have been in there in the first place.. And that the blame would fall under the Bush administration for going in in the first place. Now, it would seem like that placing the blame of ""Who started ISIS"" is a partisan issue that would play a key role in the 2016 election.. Am I wrong for thinking that? That both parties could use ISIS as a political motivation towards either side? I see FOX news a lot (that's the only channel allowed at work) saying that Obama isn't doing a lot to stop the progression of ISIS, but can you blame him for the hesitation of going into another Iraqi war? I figured this would be a good place to ask considering I wouldn't get a bunch of partisan BS"
ShitPoliticsSays,38poku,Asshole_for_Karma,8,Sat Jun 6 12:09:46 2015 UTC,"To give my own Reader's Digest version of the rise of ISIS, Obama didn't do anything to stop (Iraqi ex-president) Maliki (a Shia Muslim) from oppressing the Sunni majority once the American troops began to withdraw. Obama essentially said that the Iraqis had to solve their own problems while Maliki deprived the Sunnis of rights etc.. He handled Maliki with such a soft hand that the Sunni people- many of whom are normal, reasonable people- had nowhere to turn to other than ISIS because no one represented them. Also Obama armed the Syrian opposition, many of whom were ex-Ba'athist (Saddam's party) commanders who know how to operate artillery and tanks. Obama also, instead of providing troops to Iraq, provided the Iraqi army with American military equipment, which the untrained and demoralized army promptly abandoned to ISIS.  ISIS is the fault of many factors, and Obama is certainly not entirely to blame, but some significant blame rests solely on his shoulders."
ShitPoliticsSays,38poku,wethedownvoted,4,Sat Jun 6 14:05:42 2015 UTC,"Yup, you hit it.  The same reason ISIS was able to enter Anbar is the same reason AQ was able to also.  It took the surge and the sahwa to drive them out.    After Obama turned our backs on Iraq, the sahwa were killed.  We, America, were the ones keeping the peace between Sunni and Shia.  Given time, it would have been okay.  But it was far too soon to withdraw, as Obama's actions revealed."
ShitPoliticsSays,38poku,bllasae,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:51:22 2015 UTC,"Well it depends on your viewpoint, I guess. If you think Saddam Hussein would have prevented ISIS from being created, you'd blame Bush. If you don't think he could have, or you support the Iraq war, you'd blame Obama. But the point I was trying to make was that he didn't finish the first (well, second) Iraq war, not that he didn't start another one. he shouldn't have withdrawn the troops until the job was done, and he shouldn't have said he would, since it was naive to think Iraq wouldn't need help with defense afterwards."

Lets face it, Obama is the first black president. He's going to be a hero in people's eyes when they read about him in the history books decades and even a hundred years from now. And not to hurt anyone's feelings, but some conservatives do revere Ronald Reagan and H.W. Bush despite Iran Contra, backroom deals to delay the release of the hostages in Iran, and keeping a president in office despite being in the early stages of Alzheimer. I'm not even going to get into Bush and torture/Iraq War lies/covering up Saudi involvement in 9/11/etc.   I don't give a shit who's remembered how a hundred years from now.

Heck, Singapore became a better country in the HDI than Malaysia, the country Singapore formally belonged to before getting their independence.  Now of course, the guy did have flaws as well. He definitely wanted to suppress opposition (mostly by suing newspapers who expressed an unfavorable opinion of him, and suing opponents), and locking up people without giving them the right to a trial. Also, I am aware that Singapore places 140 out of 167 in Reporters Without Borders.  Although some of the factors of Singapore's massive success can be attributed to Singaporean work ethic and their culture, Lee Kwan Yew was the person at the forefront of developing Singapore into being one of the most developed nations in Asia.

I've heard it said, though I don't know if its true, that the entire volume of Chesterton's writings is the largest of any human in history (journals, essays, articles, books, etc).

The biggest shocker I've seen is that every time the anti science bashing crowd shows up there are quite a few people to crowbar the fundies from the other denominations.
ShitPoliticsSays,38i9k3,lakingscrzy,6,Thu Jun 4 20:38:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean the hivemind likes to sit on a high horse about morality, but unfortunately a secular morality is impossible.   No matter how they define their prime virtutis they still are subject to Hume's Law. Ie. Just because progress, or fairness, tolerance, or whatever you choose exists and is possible does not make it something we ""ought"" to do unless you posit that ideals exist and man is compelled to follow them. Now these ideals or laws would necessitate a lawgiver or at least a divine force compelling man.   Their pure empiricism falls apart because these ideals can't be physically proven so they either have to accept nhilism or accept the ""Tao"" as CS Lewis calls it in the abolition of man. So either their tolerance, equality, socialism, statism dream is ultimately meaningless and no better than anything else or they have to have a hard look at morality in general and start to admit that, gasp, right and wrong exist outside of their pet issues and regardless of their feelings.   Another point for the astute thinkers is that to believe that even if you are a hardlined materialist science would be possible only if truth could be experienced by man. And if you are in for the ideal of truth you must accept many other objective nonmaterial ideals along with it. In for a penny in for a pound. Put simply, science presupposes metaphysics.    The arrogance of the science ""fans"" (they are not scientists by in large) and dishonest talking heads like Neil Tyson about science while not understanding BASIC metaphysics is just crazy to me and I think anyone without a hardened heart can sense this and hopefully this is where we can begin to rebuild the western tradition.   Chesterton explains this all hopelessly better than me. Here's to another renaissance."
ShitPoliticsSays,38i9k3,HarmReductionSauce,2,Thu Jun 4 21:06:06 2015 UTC,"I would subscribe to your newsletter.  You're right in that scientists have deputized themselves as philosophers and theologians and they really have no idea what they're talking about. You're also correct in the shortcomings of materialist and naturalist philosophy, look at Peter Singer and his ability to rationalize killing a child after birth.  Something happened, a cog in the machine broke, when science stopped chasing higher ideals. When it went from ""let us ponder and marvel at Creation"" to ""how can we tweak, manipulate, and change the material to suit our own goals."" The current meta is ""creating in our own image,"" one of the highest divine warnings/rebukings. I think that is one reason Papa Francis poked his head into the climate change debate. We are the highest in creation, and therefore the most responsible for it.  If you haven't, check out The TOF Spot. He's got a great blog and writes similarly to Chesterton. He calls out bad science and bad philosophy on the regular, and its pretty funny."

In you examine the arguments for gay marriage they can all be applied, just as rationally to incestual relationships. I am not arguing here that incestual couples should be allowed to wed. I'm just pointing out the arguments supporting gay marriage can just as easily be used to support incestual marriage.   If marriage is about love, not child-rearing and people can't help who they fall in love with then that justifies gay marriage and incestual marriage.   If the government has no business regulating the relationships of adults, that applies to gay marriage and incestual marriage.   If your concern is about equality for people who have been ridiculed by society for sexual attractions beyond their control, that applies equally to gay marriage and incestual marriage.  The only rational reason to support gay marriage while not supporting incestual marriage comes about by an appeal to eugenics.

For instance the FBI have ample evidence that shows that if someone is willing to mutilate and kill animals, they are far more likely to move on and kill people. This is slippery slope, and it's a compelling argument with lots of data to back it up.   The big thing with slippery slopes is if you can explain the connection between the two in a logical manner with facts to back it up.

If we set aside the question of an animal right's interpretation of the Constitution, we have the question that if animals have the same status as now (property), what is the constitutional/legal difference between a horse and a plastic dildo?

Well most of them are over 12 years old, the excitement tapers off a bit after that.   How is it that Republicans managed to steal the Santa idea from the party of FDR and never let go?   Well they did try to replace him with a totally non-denominational solstice elf.....   But he is reminding his party of something it often forgets: Government was once popular because it provided tangible benefits to large numbers of Americans.   What ""tangible benefits"" did the government provide under FDR that it doesn't provide now?   At a time of rising inequality and short-circuited social mobility, Sanders is unapologetic about taking some wealth and income away from those who have a lot of both to ease the path upward for those who don’t.   Uhhh.... You're thinking of Robin Hood, E.J., Santa's elves make the presents, he doesn't gank them from rich people and put them under a poor persons tree.   Sanders has more specifics than Ben and Jerry’s has ice cream flavors.    So he has 76 specifics? And this constitutes a definitive specifics advantage?   Wanniski championed the “Two Santa Claus Theory.” He argued for “a division of labor between Democrats and Republicans; each must be a different kind of Santa Claus.” The Democrats, “the party of income redistribution, are best suited for the role of Spending Santa Claus. The Republicans, traditionally the party of income growth, should be the Santa Claus of Tax Reduction.”   Well it's kinda like that already, so I guess the only thing left to do is require all government officals to wear red velvet suits.

Nor any reason to believe that such a tactic would be at all successful.  The probable outcome of that would've been the combined bill failed. The filibuster of fast-track for TPP was a much closer vote than the USA FREEDOM Act filibuster - it only failed by 2 votes.   He seems to have been as successful as realistically possible   Despite Snowden's disclosures, the USA FREEDOM Act actually got more votes than the last time when the PATRIOT Act was renewed without any reforms. I do not believe he was as successful as was possible. I think he alienated some allies with his insistence that it was all about him.   Sen. Angus King (I-ME) voted against cloture for both bills last vote, but changed his vote to support today.

He wants to chip in ten grand to your cause.  Together, you almost have enough to pay for a video.  But you need a few more individuals to fund production, actors, etc.  All of the people mind you are citizens, just like you with equal rights to free speech, but lack access to the means to use it because they aren't rich enough to do it on their own.  But together, you and 10 friends buy that ad.  How is that bad?   That is simply allowing people to collectivise their free speech rights.CU simply recognizes that individuals do not lose their constitutional rights simply because they couple theirs with those of others.  Just like people don't lose their second amendment rights, their fifth amendment rights, etc. when they group up.  Also, as a twist, Bill is Bill O'Reilly and he is running for city dog catcher.  Fox News, as a multi-million dollar media empire, runs Bill O'Reilly friendly stories 24-7 leading up to this election.  Fox would be under no restriction from doing so regardless of the status of CU.  But, if CU had not been properly ruled, you wouldn't be able to buy that ad on that station. You and your 10 friends couldn't get together and express your political viewpoint in a meaningful modern fashion.  You couldn't have your videos.  You couldn't approach Directv to set up a PPV event to counter that speech. You couldn't make novelty toys that say ""don't vote for Bill, he is a jerk"" featuring his likeness (the Solicitor General actually argued this btw) and 10 people just got steamrolled out of starting a tiny corporation because they can ""only"" afford a 30 second ad on tv, but not their own tv station."

To me this is exacerbated by not ensuring that the market is able to adapt and adjust with the times to create long term economic security and stability (hint-hint Soviet Union or Cuba) and it ultimately leads to collapse or the government supporting industries that should have long since collapsed but are politically expedient to have around because they generate votes (like coal mining in the UK)."

Most also don't know that the majority of that water going to these big agri-businesses is not going to be penalized for going over the state-set limits established by our current governor while hundreds of thousands of smaller farmers are being squeezed out of the game entirely. Interestingly, us residential homeowners are going to get really fucked by this new penalization process even though we only account for about 2-5% of the total water usage in this massive state. How does that make sense at all? The biggest abusers are not going to get bothered while those who use a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the water are going to suffer disproportionately? I'll tell you why - corruption. Our governor is a democrat, and so am I, but I think this policy of his makes him look like a fucking joke and clearly paints him to be another corporate patsy.

I think a lot of these discussions put the cart before the horse in this manner. just like education: everyone being educated is a symptom of an advanced, wealthy society, not the cause of it. green initiatives are being brought forward because everyone's basic problems(food, shelter, etc...) have already been more of less addressed. so now people don't just want food, they want 'better' food, 'healthier' food, etc..  this is also why social programs, even if technically ""successful"", can never truly be deemed successful and ended. once people have their ""basic needs"" met, what their ""basic needs"" are defined as will change to include an ever increasing quality of life."

At first I was against it, just on principle, but then someone made a fair argument by pointing out that the main reason so many companies can get away with paying only minimum wage is because both state and federal governments have tax-payer funded welfare programs like food stamps and housing credits that offset their employees living expenses.  So by keeping the minimum wage low, we're not really punishing low earners, we're rewarding companies by shifting some of their costs onto taxpayers.  If we don't want to be paying for the living expenses of these people, there are really only two solutions. Increase the minimum wage by a modest amount or end all welfare programs."

Also I am assuming he is making the accusation about human meat going into grinders based on the novel The Jungle by Upton Sinclair, which I've never read. Yet the wikipedia page on it states;   Sinclair's account of workers falling into rendering tanks and being ground along with animal parts into ""Durham's Pure Leaf Lard"" gripped the public. The poor working conditions, and exploitation of children and women along with men, were taken to expose the corruption in meat packing factories.   But shortly thereafter;   Learning about the visit, owners had their workers thoroughly clean the factories prior to the inspection, but Neill and Reynolds were still revolted by the conditions. Their oral report to Roosevelt supported much of what Sinclair portrayed in the novel, excepting the claim of workers falling into rendering vats   Curious.

Here's some more clear example of white privilege.   White sounding names receive more call backs than black sounding names even when experience is identical  In a recent study, whites with a criminal record received more job offers than blacks with no criminal record  Sentences for blacks are 19.5% longer than for whites when looking at the same crime.  Schools with 90% white students spend (on average) $733 more per pupil than schools with 90% black students.

You can call legacy admissions an ""economic privilege"", but the reality is that privilege belongs almost exclusively to whites. Discriminatory policies of the past have shaped the structure of society so that whites are on top and blacks are on bottom. Are there some exceptions? Sure. But that doesn't mean that legacy of white supremacy doesn't remain. Do you know anything about how wealth is built in this country? Housing wealth is a huge part of the racial wealth gap. Do you know what redlining is? Have you heard of racially restrictive covenants? Do you know anything about the history of discrimination through the FHA?

If black communities want better schools and richer business opportunities, they need to stop throwing 80-90% of their support behind Democrats.   School funding is based primarily on property taxes (which are of course based on property value). What the hell does support of Democrats have to do with that? Seriously. What policy do Republicans put forth that would improve this funding problem.  Perhaps the problem is the fact that our system is set up to have unequal levels of funding for different areas depending on wealth. It's fucked up because the people in impoverished areas (with all the disadvantages that come with being in poverty) are actually in need of greater funding, then those from wealthy areas, but our government does nothing to fix this problem. If we were a nation with any empathy, we would pour money into impoverished neighborhoods and invest in these children who are growing up in concentrated disadvantage.   Violent crime among blacks is also 3 times higher than whites. I don't think it's a coincidence that the same number of people are also being charged with marijuana possession.   What are you talking about??! Jesus Christ it's like you don't understand how to read statistics. The same number of people are being charged for violent crimes as marijuana possession? Actually there are 8.2 million marijuana arrests a year and only 410,000 arrests for violent crime. I'm not sure what you think you were getting at...  Of course, this ignores the point that I was making, that usage is roughly equal but arrests rate are 3.7 times higher among blacks. Again, the crime is committed at the same rate, but arrests are 3.7 times for blacks. Any comparison with arrest rates of violent crimes ignores the much smaller numbers of them occurring (for every one violent crime arrest, there are 20 marijuana arrests).  Just. Do me a favor and stop commenting on race in the U.S. until you read a fucking book about. Try to pick something that actually challenges your views."

Clearly, there's a degree of truth to that. Pointing out broad, sweeping generalizations from other subreddits is the bread and butter of this community. Yet at the same time, some of the most up-voted comments on this sub are the very thing they seemingly argue against. How can people argue that liberals hate white people, while their main candidate of choice is an old white man named Bernie Sanders? The back up? Hillary Clinton, also a white person. Current President? Half White. Before Bush? Bill Clinton. The democratic leadership? Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, both white if I'm not mistaken. It's as if, all they see are the degenerate videos of people hating whites, that would make any liberal or progressive mad by the way, and assume everyone who is progressive fits that mold. The very notion that    Liberals do think it's morally ok to hate white people   is absurd, yet here we are, with this being the most upvoted comment here, by someone who moderates a sub called /r/whiteclub, however humorous and innocent that may (or may not) be.   It's somehow always ok to circle-jerk, as long as it fits your own world view.   Signed,   A blue-eyed, half-German, half-French American who isn't interested in 'white culture'.   I'm American first and foremost, and secondly French and German, not simply white.   Edit: You can bury me all day and night, but it matters so very little. If you can't come up with a better argument than simply silently down-voting me, in a hypocritical sub no less, than let the down-votes rain. It speaks more about you than me, and your silence speaks volumes. Cowards.   Signed: Still A blue eyed, white man. Please try harder? At least speak, if anything.  They have nothing to say. Nothing.

So unless you're about to tell me that the U.S. Airforce has been unconstitutional ever since they separated from the Army, we're just going to have to be a little flexible with strict interpretation.  But more importantly: is that really something that's freely offered to you, at no cost?  I also wasn't directly talking about the USA, btw. One of the functions of a government (that I think 99% of people can agree on) is defense. As a citizen of a governed country then, you are entitled to that function. Training, equipment, and salaries don't magically come from the sky though, so despite it being something you're entitled to, you're still paying for it."

The word ""right"" is not used in that clause. Hell, the Constitution does not give rights, as the Framers were working from the assumption that rights were inalienable things; thus, government's powers cannot infringe upon those things that it does not provide.  2) If we're being strict observers of the Constitution, then it's not ""a military""; it's an army, and a navy, with the army having constraints of not having Congress set appropriations for more than 2 years at a time. So unless you're willing to drop the Air Force and multi-year budget setups for R&D or whatever, you need to rethink what exactly you're doing here.  3) It's really weird when I'm talking about the general ""what government does"" as a way of saying that nothing is free even if it's ""free,"" and you keep bringing up the U.S. as if that's the only existing form of government. Again, please point to where I said that I was exclusively talking about the U.S. before you went off on your tangent."

If we're being strict observers of the Constitution...   You are the one who brought up being entitled to a military.  I simply explained why.   you need to rethink what exactly you're doing here   I'm having a discussion... unless I'm actually in a coma and hooked up to a virtual reality device.   and you keep bringing up the U.S.   Because some idiot said we're like a third-world country.

The government had more than ""a hand"" in the development of the dot.com era. The government was there at every crucial step. You want a more detailed history? Here you go.  Researchers working directly for the government and at university labs funded by the government were some of the first people on the planet to think up a worldwide network. And were the only people working to actually build such an ""crazy"" idea.   ARPANET, the first computer network that used packet switching, designed and deployed by the Pentagon’s Advanced Research Projects Agency. DARPA was where TCP/IP, the plumbing that makes the Internet possible, was created. And Mosaic, the first graphical browser which was critical to the internet boom, was created by a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign which receives the vast majority of its research funding from the government.   And the High Performance Computing Act of 1991 (HPCA) led to the development of the National Information Infrastructure and the funding of the National Research and Education Network. Creating something as massive as the Internet without proven uses was something that a private company simply couldn’t do. The project was too big, and the payoff too uncertain. It took government research and investment to make it happen.   And the government's role in what's made the internet and world wide web so successful aren't limited just to those technologies. Much of the technology that makes smartphones possible has government research at the heart of just about every component; the batteries, the GPS; the microprocessor; the multi-touch interface, etc...  Anybody who does not acknowledge the government's well documented key role in the dot.com era should be roundly mocked for their failure to accept factual data simply because it doesn't fit their ideology."

Doctors and nurses don't work for free, they have to make a living...Otherwise no one would be a night nurse or be there outside of a 9-5. A lot of folks have absolutely no idea what goes into healthcare and start blaming private business for rising costs. The big problem is government over regulation, and again their leftist ideas of ""leveling a playing field"". When you go out of your way to make something ""fair"" like forcing health companies to treat those who don't have means to pay for it, someone is hurt by it and it's usually not the insurance company. It's the consumer. No one works for free and life isn't fair.

ShitPoliticsSays,377fd8,Dranosh,9,Mon May 25 14:41:31 2015 UTC,"We demand the union of all Germans in a Great Germany on the basis of the principle of self-determination of all peoples.    Declaring Germany as a State, innocent enough    We demand that the German people have rights equal to those of other nations; and that the Peace Treaties of Versailles and St. Germain shall be abrogated.    Wanting to be treated as equals, again, innocent enough    We demand land and territory (colonies) for the maintenance of our people and the settlement of our surplus population.    Uhhh, kind of fishy to demand land, maybe the ability to purchase land or something    Only those who are our fellow countrymen can become citizens. Only those who have German blood, regardless of creed, can be our countrymen. Hence no Jew can be a countryman.    Apparently, this example of nationalism is the same thing as ""patriotism"", supposedly we RWNJ's don't think America is for some religious minority.     Those who are not citizens must live in Germany as foreigners and must be subject to the law of aliens.    This isn't what the right believes as a platform, we believe you should come in the legal way and bam you're a CITIZEN of the United States of America, because you respect our sovereignty and laws enough to come the correct way.     The right to choose the government and determine the laws of the State shall belong only to citizens. We therefore demand that no public office, of whatever nature, whether in the central government, the province, or the municipality, shall be held by anyone who is not a citizen.   We wage war against the corrupt parliamentary administration whereby men are appointed to posts by favor of the party without regard to character and fitness.   This is legit, you don't want a non-citizen holding office when said non-citizen is still beholden to another country. Also, as an ignorunt amuricin the parliamentary is such a stupid idea.     We demand that the State shall above all undertake to ensure that every citizen shall have the possibility of living decently and earning a livelihood. If it should not be possible to feed the whole population, then aliens (non-citizens) must be expelled from the Reich.    Hm, sounds very compassionate, but the idea of the State ABOVE ALL ensure living decently(living wage?) and earning a livelihood(government creates jobs?) is simply a form of welfare to me.     Any further immigration of non-Germans must be prevented. We demand that all non-Germans who have entered Germany since August 2, 1914, shall be compelled to leave the Reich immediately.    This is sort of ok, I don't like the idea of forcing people out, so instead if it were keeping people from certain areas that'd be fine, like after 9/11 if America had said ""Any country that is a terrorist sponsor, we will not let people come from there"" I'd be ok, but the idea of forcing people from those countries already here is too much.     All citizens must possess equal rights and duties.    Fair enough.     The first duty of every citizen must be to work mentally or physically. No individual shall do any work that offends against the interest of the community to the benefit of all.    Collectivism plan and simple   Therefore we demand:   That all unearned income, and all income that does not arise from work, be abolished.    Ah, so investing in new and innovative ideas is out, so glad that hitler took idea's from /r/politics    Since every war imposes on the people fearful sacrifices in blood and treasure, all personal profit arising from the war must be regarded as treason to the people. We therefore demand the total confiscation of all war profits.    While I think profiteering off of war is sort of creepy, I don't think a weapons manufacturer making guns/bombs for the military to do their job is treason, which by definition is the act of aiding a foreign nation they're currently at war with...     We demand the nationalization of all trusts.    Oh, so private property is no longer private property after death?    We demand profit-sharing in large industries.    And by profit-sharing the nazi's meant forcing industries to ""share"" their wealth with the ""community"" aka the State.    We demand a generous increase in old-age pensions.    This is somewhat legit, one way to solve a state based pension that has no money is to increase the age.    We demand the creation and maintenance of a sound middle-class, the immediate communalization of large stores which will be rented cheaply to small tradespeople, and the strongest consideration must be given to ensure that small traders shall deliver the supplies needed by the State, the provinces and municipalities.    So the government can demand the ""creation"" and ""maintenance"" of a middle class? Plus, there goes those damn fascists picking winners and losers like Obama did with things like Solyndra and fiskar.     We demand an agrarian reform in accordance with our national requirements, and the enactment of a law to expropriate the owners without compensation of any land needed for the common purpose. The abolition of ground rents, and the prohibition of all speculation in land.    So they want the ""community"" to be ran by the State, how very communistic of the nazi party.     We demand that ruthless war be waged against those who work to the injury of the common welfare. Traitors, usurers, profiteers, etc., are to be punished with death, regardless of creed or race.    Collective over the individual, hot damn.     We demand that Roman law, which serves a materialist ordering of the world, be replaced by German common law.    Never heard of this one, but countries do have the ability to declare their own laws.     In order to make it possible for every capable and industrious German to obtain higher education, and thus the opportunity to reach into positions of leadership, the State must assume the responsibility of organizing thoroughly the entire cultural system of the people. The curricula of all educational establishments shall be adapted to practical life. The conception of the State Idea (science of citizenship) must be taught in the schools from the very beginning. We demand that specially talented children of poor parents, whatever their station or occupation, be educated at the expense of the State.    College welfare, /r/politics dream     The State has the duty to help raise the standard of national health by providing maternity welfare centers, by prohibiting juvenile labor, by increasing physical fitness through the introduction of compulsory games and gymnastics, and by the greatest possible encouragement of associations concerned with the physical education of the young.    again, more government run programs.     We demand the abolition of the regular army and the creation of a national (folk) army.    Not sure what exactly that means.     We demand that there be a legal campaign against those who propagate deliberate political lies and disseminate them through the press. In order to make possible the creation of a German press, we demand:   (a) All editors and their assistants on newspapers published in the German language shall be German citizens.  (b) Non-German newspapers shall only be published with the express permission of the State. They must not be published in the German language.  (c) All financial interests in or in any way affecting German newspapers shall be forbidden to non-Germans by law, and we demand that the punishment for transgressing this law be the immediate suppression of the newspaper and the expulsion of the non-Germans from the Reich.  Newspapers transgressing against the common welfare shall be suppressed. We demand legal action against those tendencies in art and literature that have a disruptive influence upon the life of our folk, and that any organizations that offend against the foregoing demands shall be dissolved.   So, this is essentially declaring anything bad about the State is ""hate speech"", another /r/politics baby unless a RWNJ is in the white house then it's ""free speech"".     We demand freedom for all religious faiths in the state, insofar as they do not endanger its existence or offend the moral and ethical sense of the Germanic race.    But then we'll decide what it means to ""offend"" the moral/ethical senses and of course that means you jews need to stop being so jewish.    The party as such represents the point of view of a positive Christianity without binding itself to any one particular confession. It fights against the Jewish materialist spirit within and without, and is convinced that a lasting recovery of our folk can only come about from within on the pinciple:   And yet, you go on to slaughter millions of innocent lives, that's not Christianity, that's being anti-christ   COMMON GOOD BEFORE INDIVIDUAL GOOD    In order to carry out this program we demand: the creation of a strong central authority in the State, the unconditional authority by the political central parliament of the whole State and all its organizations.   The formation of professional committees and of committees representing the several estates of the realm, to ensure that the laws promulgated by the central authority shall be carried out by the federal states.  The leaders of the party undertake to promote the execution of the foregoing points at all costs, if necessary at the sacrifice of their own lives.   This is quite the opposite of what we RWNJ's want considering that ""All men are Created EQUAL"", ergo, individual over the collective.   Looks to me that Nazism, specifically Hitler's Nazi's, were only nationalist in the sense of getting support from the German people, but used the ideas of collectivism to create an all powerful state that would go on to rape and pillage.   source :http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/riseofhitler/25points.htm"

While Sanders talks and plays a good game and is one of the few liberals in Washington, I think the back part of this poor guy's sentiment wanders off the reservation. Sanders is, like Obama, undirtied by a pro-war vote, who has the record now to back up everything he said then. He is without controversy. But he is also without the name recognition and also just what Americans think of when they hear ""socialist."" Think of the paranoid refrains about our current center-right president's health care reforms, which were actually hugely friendly to the insurance industry. Think of the Red Scare. That's an uphill battle for Sanders, as well as the self-fulfilling perceived inevitability on both sides of the aisle of a President Hillary Clinton."

I too am a registered ""Republican"" since I believe in smaller government, but I find myself about to switch registration to vote for Bernie in the primaries. This guy knows what the hell he is doing as a politician. I too am a conservative and admire a lot of the things Sanders is doing. I have contemplated registering as a democrat but I am concerned about free tuition and increased minimum wage. I think it should be increased but not to $15. And I think tuition should be decreased but not completely paid for. Knowing the American government, both of those things would probably be the outcome due the compromises Sanders would have to make in office. As a side note, I am a "" real"" conservative and believe in smaller government. One without NSA, giants prisons where we lock up nonviolent drug users, and 500 billion spent to kill more people every year. We can easily afford all of this. Just need to reallocate. Somehow being a real conservative makes me more aligned with the socialist Bernie Sanders, lol.   And then of course...   I think this is largely due to the fact that American politics are so heavily skewed towards the right-wing. Internationally, the American Democratic Party wouldn't even be considered left-wing, but rather centre-right. So it's pretty easy for someone who is actually conservative to still be agreeing with an American democrat on many issues."

Real or not, he barely responded to any questions, many of them he tap danced around the actual question, and several times it became apparent his platform was ""It's the Republicans"" rather than pushing for his own ideology. People wanted him to be different, but he's no different than all the other politicians, just with a different ideology. Can't say I was too surprised, but I could see that people in the AMA were coming to this realization too.  Also, the ""as a Conservative"" question even notes he does not agree with Sanders in many areas. He just claims to admire ""honest"" people in politics, which isn't really anything shit worthy."

Wasn't surprised at all by the questions obviously pandering to what reddit would want to hear and Bernie giving them the typical bs answers of how he wants to change everything for the better of the common people but completely leaving out any glimpse of a possible plan to do anything he claims he wants to do.    So I guess what I'm saying is he's just a run of the mill politician, just happens to get attention on reddit because he's a socialist.  No surprise there but the AMA pretty much confirmed it for me, he's completely forgettable to anyone who doesn't use /r/Politics as a newsource."
ShitPoliticsSays,36nz61,Ashbringer_,1 point,Thu May 21 16:29:48 2015 UTC,"he's completely forgettable to anyone who doesn't use /r/Politics[1] as a newsource.

ShitPoliticsSays,36nz61,politicaldan,0,Thu May 21 20:48:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's unreasonable to think Hillary could lose still, especially if someone wanted to drag some scandals out and make a big deal about them.  I just really doubt that gives Bernie any more of a chance.  No one but reddit is even talking about him.  Obama was the black man promising change and knew all the right things to say to get people rallying behind him.  Doesn't hurt that he was pretty good at delivering speeches and had good writers.  He got people talking.  Now I admit I don't follow all things Bernie like a /r/Pol drone but the few interviews I have bothered to watch just to get a feel for the guy were completely lackluster.  He seemed to fumble when asked for specifics on much of what he was saying and offered nothing but idealistic ideas he'd like to see, no plans on how to reasonably obtain those goals.  I really fail to see anything particularly special about Sanders except that he's a Socialist.  He isn't breaking new ground, he's not saying or doing anything of note.  He's just kind of there.  Maybe I'm wrong and Dems will come out in droves to vote for the old white socialist but I'd be kinda surprised.  On that note, I really wouldn't mind if he did get the nomination.  Republicans wouldn't have to try hard at all to look like the most central choice compared to a self proclaimed Socialist.  As far as I'm concerned if they managed to still screw up that election they truly don't deserve it."

I mean, I'd get it if a reddit tended toward one party or another but some of the shit that gets regularly upvoted is so asinine its almost to the point where i have a hard time a person of average intelligence would upvote it even if they were liberal.

Because of that, here are a few reasons that I can think of that would justify this behavior.   It is worth it to consider that this is an issue which many people are highly interested in. Before I made this reddit account, I used to have one that I used only to vote on posts, or comment on things that highly interested me. I want to say I posted 4 times in the 2 years I had the account. Some of these posters are likely in the same boat.  Consider as well the fact that you're a conservative (most likely). Yes, you have a pretty good grasp on what Bernie Sanders stands for, thanks to reddit, but that's it. I also would bet that most conservatives with a surface knowledge of Bernie Sanders don't have specific points which need to be cleared up with the man himself.  Lastly, think about the fact that this man is both controversial in his views and is currently running for president. Can you blame him for attempting not to alienate potential voters? Just as we saw people like Mitt Romney or John McCain, candidates will have to pander both to active party voters and then the American public. It seems to me like Sanders's issue is the opposite of most American politicians- he has to swing back, to a more moderate stance, to reconcile with most of America's less progressive views."

ShitPoliticsSays,36hz6d,Gittr,-3,Wed May 20 09:42:44 2015 UTC,Perhaps you could give a reasoned reply instead of just scoffing.  Consider my statement a challenge: I'd like to hear a Republican/conservative make an argument for how the GOP is helping the middle class.  Because I've yet to see a compelling argument for this -- most Republicans can't even look at the data and acknowledge that we have a wealth inequality problem.
ShitPoliticsSays,36hz6d,HAL9000000,3,Wed May 20 16:47:21 2015 UTC,"Actually, perhaps you should show us proof that all Republican policies help the rich only.

Cough Just ignore Baltimore, Detroit, and other Democrat run crapholes cough   You made the statement, you have the burden the proof. Show me verifiable data. Prove it. If not, you're just spouting rehashed nonsense we've read time and time again on Politics.  And please stop associating republicans with conservatives. Any Conservative with half a brain will recognize we have a wealth inequality problem. But see, most conservatives will also recognize that its just a symptom of a larger issue."
ShitPoliticsSays,36hz6d,Gittr,-2,Wed May 20 16:50:52 2015 UTC,"Frankly, first of all, you absolutely cannot blame the economic situation in a city on a mayor.  The cities you're talking about are made up of people who have been poor for generations.  Somebody has to be mayor of those cities.  But morons like you come along and equate a cause and effect relationship between the current mayor of those cities and their economic problems.  If you want to make that argument you're going to have to show me some examples of cities where a Republican has come in and somehow lifted the economic prosperity of a city that was previously doing terribly economically.  You won't find an example because it just doesn't happen -- not when inequality is where its at now.  There's only one party who advocates lowering taxes for the wealthy ""job creators"" and that's Republicans.  This is simply just supply-side economics -- AKA trickle down economics.  It has never worked for the middle class -- the data over the last 35 years or so clearly shows this.  See here: https://anticap.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/inequality-p25_averagehouseholdincom.png  See how in that chart that there's been no growth for anybody below the top 20%?  See how almost all of the growth goes to the top 1%?  Inequality started to get really bad when Reagan came in and started really cutting the hell out of the top marginal tax rate -- it went from soemthing like 70% down to about 35% during his presidency.  It kept going up but then Clinton raised that rate back up a little bit and things started to get a bit better at the end of Clinton's presidency and went down for a couple years into Bush II's, but then Bush II made sure to reverse that trend.  By the end of Bush's term, things had gotten so bad that the damage is really hard to reverse.  Nobody was going to be able to fix it in the last 6 years -- not Obama, not Romney -- nobody.  Not unless we can get a massive restructuring of the economy.  Stop associating Republicans with conservatives?  Excuse me, but there's a lot of intersection with Republicans and conservatives -- it's a fair thing to do when speaking in shorthand.  And besides, you called me a liberal and I consider myself to be pretty moderate.  The data are pretty clear that Republicans wanted tax breaks for everyone and deregulation of the markets.  Those tax breaks favored the rich by far the most and so did the deregulation favor the wealthiest and the largest corporations.  In that environment, the rich just get richer and richer.  And the whole economy becomes destabilized as the middle class are left behind.  It's actually gotten to the point where it's fairly clear what's happened unless you're just not willing to look and acknowledge it."
ShitPoliticsSays,36hz6d,HAL9000000,3,Wed May 20 17:00:15 2015 UTC,"Frankly, first of all, you absolutely cannot blame the economic situation in a city on a mayor.   When did I say it was just the fault of the Mayor? Please read what I wrote.    morons like you come along and equate a cause and effect relationship between the current mayor of those cities and their economic problems.   And ""morons like you"" come along and equate a cause and effect relationship between trickle down economics and then nation's economic problems.   hypocrite much? Yes? LOL.    This is simply just supply-side economics -- AKA trickle down economics.   Trickle down may not have worked. Unfortunately, you seem to be obsessed over this one thing. You seem to have tunnel vision, fixated on this policy and this policy alone. This is not 1979. Reagan is not President. Do you know who is President?   Yes, the Savior, the Messiah, Barack Hussein Obama, also known as Barry Soetoro. And is he a Republican?   Oh wait - he's not. He's a Democrat.  You have shown absolutely no proof that Republican policies have caused the economic crisis. You just draw some obscure correlation between the time that the gap widened, to when a Republican took office. You're fixated on one policy - Trickle Down - and you also conveniently ignore the sub prime housing crisis, caused by CLINTON, another Democrat. People buying houses when they couldn't afford them? Yep, that also contributed to the mess we're in.   Blaming it on one party isnt the answer. I agree, Trickle down economics may not have worked, but that's not the entire root of the problem. You have tunnel vision.  There isn't much intersection at all between Republicans and Conservatives. Most Conservatives, at least I know, do not consider Bush a Conservative, but actually a Liberal. Conservatives believe in small government with a strong military. Generally speaking, they want the government out of your life, so you can live your life with as much freedom as possible, and without the government spying on you and taking your taxes to be spent in a wide, corrupt bureaucracy to be spent to go down the drain. Like what we have now.   Granted, many of them do support the surveillance state and a militaristic police force - which I do not agree with.   In that environment, the rich just get richer and richer. And the whole economy becomes destabilized as the middle class are left behind.   You clearly have little understanding of economics and Conservatism. I blame this more on the failure of our educational system then anything.   Here is a bombshell; we do not live in a true capitalistic society. We live in ""crony"" capitalism. This is where the government works with corporations to fit their interests. In short, our government does not represent us. Our government is corrupt to the core.  In a true capitalistic economy, tax breaks are good for everyone. People get to keep what they earn. It is inherently immoral to take from someone by force, on the whim by a government lackey making wide sweeping policies. Government at its core is inefficient, because government does not produce, and does not give workers incentive to produce. It hasn't worked in history, and never will. In short; generally speaking, the smaller the government, the better, because they wield less power.  Whats fairly clear, if you've taken the time to educate yourself, is that our government has become too big and too corrupt. It has nothing to do with Republicans or Democrats. Many of the policies you consider to be ""Conservative"" are not Conservative at all. They are just plain corrupt and authoritarian.   I believe there is a fundamental misunderstanding of Conservatism and its unfortunate.   And besides, you called me a liberal and I consider myself to be pretty moderate.   I never called you a liberal. You clearly did not read what I wrote. But, I can tell you're a liberal from your stupid emotional reply."

Yes, someone's to blame for your predicament.  No, it ain't the boomers."
ShitPoliticsSays,36dy7y,stupidestpuppy,18,Mon May 18 20:51:51 2015 UTC,But baby boomers had 2 bedroom houses in the suburbs and worked long hours at factory jobs before finally breaking through and having a retirement!  Why don't 20 year olds instantly have everything that it took their parents 30 years to attain?  It's unfair!
ShitPoliticsSays,36dy7y,williammc,3,Tue May 19 02:13:50 2015 UTC,"The sad part is that this isn't really an exaggeration. My sister's ex-boyfriend used to bitch about how nice my parents had it. Of course, if he had grown up with them like I did, he would have seen my dad working two full-time jobs for almost a decade and realized what it took for my parents to get where they are in life."

ShitPoliticsSays,36dy7y,DerJawsh,9,Tue May 19 00:13:34 2015 UTC,"I like how no one ever even once acknowledges that our generation has a huge sense of entitlement that equals or probably even surpasses the baby boomers. Both my parents nipped the end of the Baby Boomer generation, both of them had to go into the military to support themselves, both of them are probably the most hard working people I've met, their parents were farmers and factory workers. It's not like baby boomers were just handed ideal jobs on a platter like people seem to believe. The other part of the problem is people like to just blame a generation for all the problems they could work on attempting to fix now, and yet, also refuse to admit that their generation has flaws."
ShitPoliticsSays,36dy7y,Mastodon9,9,Tue May 19 03:55:59 2015 UTC,"I don't get it. They make it out like the Baby Boomers have somehow taken a lot of things from Milennials. What all have Baby Boomers directly taken from Milennials? I understand a lot of Milennials are having a hard time finding jobs after college, but do they not realize a lot of those Baby Boomers probably can't retire even if they wanted to?"

No it simply wasn't sorry cry babies, but the boomers didn't have boatloads of welfare. They had a Vietnam war draft, a recession with 13% inflation, and plenty of their own issues.  Have these people not even finished an american history course yet?  I can imagine the overlap between politics and askreddit. The baby boomer hate is an epic circle jerk in both. Seems like a great way to mine gold though."
ShitPoliticsSays,36dy7y,joesophson,15,Mon May 18 21:25:11 2015 UTC,"Have these people not even finished an american history course yet?   Well, yes, but it's probably based on Howard Zinn's horribly biased ""A People's History Of The United States"", which foreshadows Obama's declaration of ""You didn't build that""!"
ShitPoliticsSays,36dy7y,jlasoreilly,8,Mon May 18 19:45:35 2015 UTC,"I mean, even that book shows how shitty previous generations had it. They're acting like baby boom is the worst."
ShitPoliticsSays,36dy7y,deadjawa,10,Mon May 18 22:02:57 2015 UTC,The ironic thing about antiestablishmentarianism in young people is that it is an establishment.  The fact that a comment that stupid could get 4500 upvotes just shows how naive reddit can be.

ShitPoliticsSays,36dy7y,deadjawa,13,Tue May 19 01:23:22 2015 UTC,No one should lament those people choosing to not breed.
ShitPoliticsSays,36dy7y,bubby963,3,Mon May 18 20:40:50 2015 UTC,"No, but if you're going to do something damaging to the economy like choosing not to breed then what right to you have to complain about how others ruined it for you?"
ShitPoliticsSays,36dy7y,IGOTDADAKKA,4,Tue May 19 01:22:19 2015 UTC,Wait how does being childfree affect the economy other than maybe gerber profits lowering?

Edit: Also can't forget this gold nugget.   it's been interesting watching how traditional media paints Bernie as curiosity with no real chance of winning. At the same time, I'm sure that if they chose to go with the narrative that he was a real contender, he'd be on everybody's radar (not just the internet community's, and specifically reddit's) within the week.   Yeah, because he has literally no chance of winning. Also, if he was on everybody's radar, it wouldn't be the endless praise that Sanders supporters expect."
ShitPoliticsSays,36dkuu,NDIrish27,15,Mon May 18 15:23:15 2015 UTC,"it wouldn't be the endless praise that Sanders supporters expect.   Exactly. They get all of their news from completely biased news sources so they are completely blind to any and all criticism of Sanders. If he was in the public eye, there would be a lot, and I mean a big fucking heaping pile, of anti-Sanders sentiment."
ShitPoliticsSays,36dkuu,breakwater,11,Mon May 18 20:55:23 2015 UTC,"It's like Ron Paul, except even more foolish.  Paul had laid a lot of groundwork for his vainglorious runs.  Sanders is simply preying on a natural constituency of people who simply don't get politics or public policy."

ShitPoliticsSays,36dkuu,AveSharia,14,Mon May 18 19:30:31 2015 UTC,"It is axiomatic in /r/politics that if a someone refers to ""founding principles,"" it's an obvious dog-whistle for slavery.  So Bernie must be for the ""ideas and policies"" that this commenter must think made this a great nation: Purging the reds, enslaving the blacks, interning the yellows, rule by protestant fiat and tyranny by freemasonry. Right?"
ShitPoliticsSays,36dkuu,ALECop,11,Mon May 18 16:07:43 2015 UTC,"They are pining for the olden days of the 1950s with regards to taxes, so it's not a stretch to assume they want to go back to the racial segregation of that day. I mean, they did filibuster the Civil Rights Act for god's sake!"
ShitPoliticsSays,36dkuu,loondawg,14,Mon May 18 19:36:50 2015 UTC,"As long as it's Bernie Sanders we're talking about, any hypocrisy can be handwaved.  According to the people on /r/politics"
ShitPoliticsSays,36dkuu,abowsh,-11,Mon May 18 19:41:57 2015 UTC,"Progressive (Liberal) here. Can you show me where he said the president's color is why the country is in its current condition? Or can you show where Sanders says he can fix it because he is white? If so, I would say he was showing racism. If not, I would say you are."
ShitPoliticsSays,36dkuu,AveSharia,21,Mon May 18 16:10:37 2015 UTC,It's a joke. He is making fun of the people who were constantly calling anyone who disagreed with President Obama racists.
ShitPoliticsSays,36dkuu,loondawg,9,Mon May 18 19:19:07 2015 UTC,"If not, I would say you are.   Sanders obviously didn't say those things, but if haphazardly accusing someone of racism makes the accuser racist, then /r/politics is the new National Socialism."
ShitPoliticsSays,36dkuu,AveSharia,-5,Mon May 18 19:40:46 2015 UTC,But why sink to that level? Honor comes with taking the higher road.
ShitPoliticsSays,36dkuu,loondawg,3,Mon May 18 19:38:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know, you'd have to ask them.  I suspect it has something to do with the fact that honor and politics have nearly nothing to do with each other?"
ShitPoliticsSays,36dkuu,onemanmanywomen,-7,Mon May 18 20:01:07 2015 UTC,"If I saw them doing it, I would call them out too. I'm asking here because it is being done here.

ShitPoliticsSays,36dkuu,loondawg,8,Mon May 18 20:59:05 2015 UTC,"This is great. Your first instinct is to call me a racist with zero proof and then when someone explains the joke you take the ""why all this acrimony?!!?!"" route? Fuck you man."
ShitPoliticsSays,36dkuu,ALECop,-9,Mon May 18 21:00:31 2015 UTC,"Aw. Do you need me to call you a wambulance? I said if you are making it an issue of race when no one else is, you're the racist. That's not an instinct. It's a clear-eyed observation based on the proof of your statement.  And the defense to it was that's what other people do. So I pointed out that if you do it to, you've lost any high ground from which to complain about it.  I've made no complaints about acrimony. People don't like being called out when they're acting the fool. Acrimonious responses like ""Fuck you man"" come as no surprise."
ShitPoliticsSays,36dkuu,loondawg,6,Mon May 18 20:48:10 2015 UTC,"Right, so everyone else but you should ""take the high road"", as usual with you liberals the rules don't apply to you.   It's perfect how with your first fucking baseless accusation to me you gave a sterling example of the reasoning for my joke."
ShitPoliticsSays,36dkuu,ALECop,-5,Mon May 18 21:13:38 2015 UTC,"The exact same rules apply to me. You made a baseless comment introducing race where no one else had and it clearly wasn't an issue. If I had done the same thing, it would have been perfectly appropriate for you to question whether I was being racist.   What's imperfect in your reasoning is your idea that you can make comments that sound racist and call other people racist but think you should be immune from being called out for it.  And it's far from a sterling example because when you make inappropriate comments about race like you did, you deserve to be called out for it even if you think you are making a joke.   I'm not telling you what to do. But I am telling you that you lose any moral high ground when sink to the same level as the people you are criticizing."
ShitPoliticsSays,36dkuu,loondawg,12,Mon May 18 22:27:22 2015 UTC,"Hahahaha look at this guy, demanding proof when called a racist! Exactly like a racist would do! The rules have changed my friend, you guys have shown over the last 6 years that one only needs to shout RACIST! to make the accusation reality. Now get out of here with your white tribalism and code words before I call Al Sharpton."
ShitPoliticsSays,36dkuu,ALECop,-6,Mon May 18 23:47:07 2015 UTC,"So when I ask for something to show that race plays any role at all here, your response is you think other people are idiots so you are going to act like one too. And a racist one at that."
ShitPoliticsSays,36dkuu,bllasae,11,Mon May 18 19:22:43 2015 UTC,"He's obviously racist since he wants a white man in charge, I'm just going by what qualifies one as a racist according to you liberals. He's dying to have an old white guy as President since, according to him this is no longer a ""great nation"" under a black President. You could even say he wants to ""take our country back"", which is racism, straight up. Just going by your rules as presented over the last 6 years."
