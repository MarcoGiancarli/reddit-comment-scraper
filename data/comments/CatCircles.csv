You have to let the circles exist outside of your will, and let your subconscious mind form the shape. You will make many shitty partially circular forms, until one day, in perfect harmony with the ancient cat spirits, you will form a circle. This circle will trap any cat that senses it, and you will be granted a non-negative number of wishes, arbitrarily chosen by each effected cat. Be careful, though, as a fraction of a wish can be a very tricky thing to control. You wish for a giant ice cream cone, maybe you get a giant, or a giant ice cone, or even a mice tree. Cats can be real assholes, when armed with the power of anagrams."

CatCircles,2mwgme,Pancerules,10,Thu Nov 20 22:26:41 2014 UTC,"That cat reminds me of the cat I had until I was 5. His name was Spunky. He was old and spent most of his time in his cat bed. Being an only child, I considered him to be like my brother. We played together all the time. Of course by that I mean I used him as landscapes for my hot wheels and my dump trucks to drive all over.  At the time I didn't really understand how much of a gift it was to have this patient cat in my life, letting my imagination run wild as he played such roles as a hill, or a quarry, a mountain, a rally style racetrack, and of course, Jabba the Hut.   Spunky died when I was five. It was my first experience with death. I probably didn't understand it all that well, I remember missing him, but for some reason i wasn't particularly sad. On the day my mom put him to sleep at the vet, she was wracking her brain trying to find a healthy way to explain it to me. As a psychologist as well as a single mom, she was concerned about that sort of thing screwing up my psyche. As she tells the story, after kindergarten I asked where Spunky was, she gave me a long careful explanation, neither lying to me nor being brutally detailed. She says that I thought for a second, looked at her and said, ""so Spunky kicked the bucket?""  I don't remember this exact incident, but as I've gotten older I realized what a special cat Spunky was. He's the kind of friend that makes me want to believe he's in cat heaven chasing mice and getting butt scratches."
CatCircles,2mwgme,Pancerules,8,Thu Nov 20 22:41:39 2014 UTC,"It's amazing having such patient cats. This little guy is Bronson, we got him on Christmas eve 2013 from a shelter along with his buddy Carlton, a black cat with a amputated tail. I'm 21 and still live at home, my sister moved out years ago and has 3 kids, so I feel like an only child now. Bronson sleeps with me every night guaranteed, and Carlton comes to bed in the morning. I am so lucky to have such a patient cat especially from a shelter (he was 10 months when I got him).  Thanks so much for your story, even though Spunky can sound like a hilarious name I hope he's having fun in his cat heaven getting high off catnip!   I'll give Bronson a hug and tell him to use his cat telepathy skills to tell Spunky everything's cool!"
CatCircles,2mwgme,Pancerules,4,Thu Nov 20 23:44:54 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it took a few years before I learned another meaning for the word spunky. It'll always be for my old pal.  Sadly Spunky was the last cat I've lived with so far. My mom eventually got married to my dad (that's a whole other long story) but he was allergic to cats. We ended up with a dog who I named Grover after the Sesame Street character. He was also extremely patient and I loved him dearly. He died from cancer at the age of twelve. About five months later my parents got another wonderful dog Daisy (http://i.imgur.com/DuGV0iZ.jpg). I was in college at that point so she was/is more my patent's dog than mine, but she loves me just the same.   Weird side story: a friend of a friend of my parents was a self-proclaimed ""pet psychic"". My parents and I were pretty dubious, but we were offered a free reading, and all she needed was a picture. She told my parents that the spirit or ghost or whatever remains of Grover has helped Daisy to learn how to be the kind of dog that we all love.   It's a nice thought, even if it's bullshit. That said, Daisy really is a family dog, in that she has definitely taken up certain characteristics of my family. She's friendly, but not gregarious. She's shy, but still loves attention. She's also stubborn as hell.  I keep hearing stories from my dad about how my mom will move stuff around in Daisy's bed and the Daisy will retaliate by completely unmaking and pulling all the sheets and blankets off my mom's bed.   At this point my parents are getting close to 70 and Miss D is almost 14, so it's pretty amusing, like the three of them are doing Grumpy Old Men bits.   I hope Daisy hangs on without pain for a good long time."
CatCircles,2mwgme,Pancerules,2,Fri Nov 21 01:34:51 2014 UTC,"What did Spunky look like? For some reason I'm imagining a gorgeous black and white cat, but I might be wrong. I just get a feeling.   Ah :( I never got how people were allergic to certain animals. Is it due to hair or something? If so, how can they not be allergic to dogs. Oh man when we first got the cats my parents claimed to have been allergic, the cats would never be allowed on their bed. Now they're allowed on their bed and they cuddle them constantly. Allergic my asssss.  Aw Grover! Describe him, for some reason I'm imagining a terrier of some sort, I have no idea where these assumptions are coming from. Daisy is adorable! :D  Oh pet psychics, not sure how I feel about that one. If I didn't give a picture and the person came out with some facts, then I'd believe.  Aw seems like they're all getting old together, my parents want a dog, but they still work a 9-5 job and they said they'd rather have a dog for when they retire. They want some terrier, I'd love a white alsation."
CatCircles,2mwgme,Pancerules,1 point,Fri Nov 21 08:13:35 2014 UTC,"Sadly, I don't have a picture of Spunky. I should ask my mom if she has any pics in the old albums. I'm 32 now so all I have is a handful of memories about him. Part of why the pic made me think of Spunky was because they are similarly colored. I'm think Spunky was a stripey grayish-brown, I forget what that's called. He was definitely a short-hair.   Grover and Daisy are both Cocker Spaniel/poodle mixes, known as Cockapoos. Grover was pitch black as a puppy but then he turned grayer and grayer as he got older. He was also at least twice the size of your average cockapoo. We were not expecting that. That was part of his charm. When my mom and I adopted him as a puppy, my dad's first reaction was that he didn't want a tiny little yappy dog (even though he loved G-dog from the start too). Then Grover turns into this mid-size pooch with a friendly personality and the patience of a saint. He was my Dad's walking companion, he was my mom's lapdog, even when he was fully grown and could only get his front half on her lap. To me he was a brother, a playmate, and a friend during difficult times as a kid when I didn't have a lot of friends.   Daisy ended up being much smaller than Grover, she is average as far as size goes. Personality wise, she's a giant! Where-as Grover could be a bit of a push-over, she was always in your face, smiling and laughing. She used to stand on top of her kennel/indoor doghouse bed so she could be eye level with everyone sitting at the kitchen table.   Compared to Grover, and the stricter rules he had such as being banished from certain rooms, my parents tried to enforce those, but Daisy quickly made it known she was having none of it. She soon carved out her own spot on the couch (on a big folded comforter at my Dad's feet when he was lying on the couch). She claimed part of Dad's bed as her own as well as her own spots in both of their offices.   As far as allergies, in my experience it's the kind of thing that changes. I had bad asthma as a kid and I think that's another reason my mom didn't get another cat after Spunky. Cockapoos are known to be hypoallergenic because they don't shed much. I took an allergy test once and both cat and dog dander showed up on there. That said my number one allergy on that test was dust mites. I spent 8 years living in a bachelor pad where I dusted maybe once a year, it was not a particularly clean place. I ended up just fine as far as allergies went there.   I've also spent a week or so at friend's houses who have up to three cats, and again, no problem. Here's the kicker: when I visit Daisy and my parents, I end up getting all congested after a couple hours. Oh well, it's worth it to give Daisy some luvin'."
CatCircles,2mwgme,UndeadCaesar,2,Fri Nov 21 10:08:28 2014 UTC,"Ahahah I was totally out from black and white! Bahaha! I think Bronson is a tabby - I actually have no clue what breeds my cats are. They were just found on the streets in bad condition and got sent to a charitable cat sanctuary thingy ma jingy! Wow, 32 years old and you still remember his from when you were 5, Spunky must've been so memorable.  Ahaha Cockapoos and Spunky, you're doing well with names at the moment! Ah Grover seemed great with everyone in the family, it's great when you find a pet that suits everyone's ideals of a pet (if you get where i'm coming from). Bronson is a bit like that, he's can be a lap cat, he will play around (we usually chase each other round the house), then we can lie in bed and spoon a lot. I will admit, my parents are super jealous because Bronson would rather be with me at times, if i'm away on a weekend, he'll usually sleep with my parents!  AWW! Daisy just wanted to be a human :P definitely a large dog in a small dogs body! Ahaha, bless; I can imagine Daisy just standing there staring at everyone and in her head she's like ""HUMANS, LOOK, LOOK, I'M NEARLY AS TALL AS YOUUU!""  I think people let pets have their way after a while (well i'm sure that's fair to say). Or maybe it's the effort of having to discipline, after all they've had kids and pets before hand!  Ahah that's super random how your allergies can come and go, it's the same with my Mum, one day she'll be sneezing because of cat hair, then it goes for a couple of months, then comes back. Super super weird, i'm happy that I don't have any allergies - maybe it helps that we have wooden flooring all over the house (apart from stairs). So most of it just gets swept or vacuumed away!"
CatCircles,2mwgme,UnidentifiedNoirette,1 point,Fri Nov 21 10:28:59 2014 UTC,"So I talked to my mom today and asked her about Spunky. She had him a lot longer than I did so I trust her memory on this. Turns out you were correct. He was mostly black with white socks and a white chest.   The rest of the stuff I remember, specifically he being a sweet and patient old kitty humored little kid me as I used him as landscapes for my toys was all accurate in her memory."
CatCircles,2mwgme,supremecrafters,2,Sat Nov 22 05:39:14 2014 UTC,I suppose your memory of him may have been skewed since it was 27 years ago. I didn't get the dog breeds right though!  Use him as train tracks? Or more dirt roads for your offroad cars.

'I'm much too comfortable to leave the position I'm in right now.' But no, the owner continued to point at the circle, constantly repeating his pleads.

CatCircles,2kld63,Pancerules,1 point,Wed Oct 29 00:03:33 2014 UTC,I think you may be correct
CatCircles,2kld63,Pancerules,3,Wed Oct 29 17:46:47 2014 UTC,"Your cat is adorable by the way. Possibly possessed by satan after this, but very cute."
CatCircles,2kld63,Jennica,2,Wed Oct 29 17:52:05 2014 UTC,"Thanks!  He's a shelter cat and an attention whore.   We haven't noticed any more Satanic possession indicators than normal since the cat portal was created, but we're keeping close watch. :)"

CatCircles,2kjzjn,shinymuggle,2,Tue Oct 28 10:00:04 2014 UTC,I heard somewhere on catcircles that white is really hard for a cat to see. Red and black tape work the best.
CatCircles,2kjzjn,Reinoud95,3,Wed Oct 29 07:06:00 2014 UTC,Aha! Thanks. We'll attempt another cat circle/portal.

CatCircles,2kjch1,Dawn80,2,Tue Oct 28 04:01:40 2014 UTC,"They get along really well. I wouldn't say they are bonded or anything like that, but they coexist and interact peacefully."

CatCircles,2kg9zn,kazzalow,5,Mon Oct 27 10:18:17 2014 UTC,Your cat has simply outsourced the protection of the circle to your dog.  Your cat has better things to do than guard the circle.
