They are Stretch and Tootsie on this page http://thunderingpaws.org/animals/adopt?page=2&field_an_gender_value_many_to_one=All&field_an_species_value_many_to_one=C  Hope that works

gingerkitty,3dvoxk,c-smash,4,Sun Jul 19 22:37:37 2015 UTC,"I believe ginger kitties must be made of the sun and that's why they need so much recharging sun time. My ginger will even lay under the brightest light at night or if it's stormy, which happens a lot in FL."

There is something about the eyes and the way he is holding his foot that makes me respond almost like he is a human baby instead of a baby cat. Maybe it is the mischievious expression.

gingerkitty,3cq8x4,bevbh,8,Thu Jul 9 22:17:50 2015 UTC,"I lost my ginger girl in September of last year, she was 17. she always had a male housemate, two different gray dudes, both younger than she. They never bonded, tolerant enough to sit together, but never cuddled.  She was aloof to most people, but a sweet & tender lap cat to me. Vocal, opinionated, and too smart for her own good. Figured out that when she would yowl for her dinner, we would look at the clock, so she took to yowling while looking at the clock. I have photos of her reverse-engineering the auto food dish, and she would always pull out the clothes drawers to make a snug little bed. She had an unhealthy predilection for licking/chewing plastic bags & would hunt them down as soon as they entered the house. Because she could open drawers & cabinets we had to be very thorough in tucking them away.   She was pretty, and she knew it. Sassy, even. She was far from dumb. I miss her terribly."
gingerkitty,3cq8x4,scarrie,2,Thu Jul 9 23:45:54 2015 UTC,"I'm so shocked my ginger girl hasn't figured out how to get into the automatic food bowl. I was worried she was too smart and would figure it out, but she hasn't yet. She just patiently sits by the bowl for sometimes 2 hours waiting for it to spin and feed her.   Also, I'm sorry for your loss. As a fellow ginger female owner I know how very special they are. ♡"
gingerkitty,3cq8x4,disshortybtexan,5,Fri Jul 10 04:57:59 2015 UTC,"I have never had a female ginger, but my youngest cat (a ginger boy) is so smart it's actually tricky to deal with him! I've had a ton of cats but this one is something else; he can understand reflections, that the red dot only appears when the pointer is in my hand, and recently taught himself to open doors."
gingerkitty,3cq8x4,KihelHeim,3,Thu Jul 9 22:43:01 2015 UTC,"I too have a ginger boy. He is actually very smart. He knows how to open doors (which my Bengal-y looking cat doesn't). He hates when I whistle and knows how to make me stop (by pushing his head against my cheeks). Knows when I walk to the cabinet with treats that he'll get one if he sits and waits patiently. He tries to communicate and has many different meows and ""barks"" (this might be more common in other cats but I haven't seen it yet)."
gingerkitty,3cq8x4,sister_carlotta,3,Thu Jul 9 22:59:04 2015 UTC,"Cats don't generally meow in nature once they stop being kittens.  We've got one that does it, but she's also terrible at other cats, so maybe she just doesn't know the language."
gingerkitty,3cq8x4,Neebat,2,Fri Jul 10 00:24:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe he's part Maine Coon.  They're very vocal cats.  I had a neutered male ginger who was part Maine Coon and he talked all the time.  He would sit on his haunches and beg, and give me his paw like a dog, and he'd play fetch.  Maine Coons are known as the dogs of the cat family.  If your cat is bigger than average, and has a broad nose and  wide muzzle he might be part Maine Coon.  They are really wonderful cats.  Some here."
gingerkitty,3cq8x4,missdingdong,3,Fri Jul 10 08:46:30 2015 UTC,Thank you for your answers. It is good to know that Gingers can be just as smart as any other cats.   It should be easy to get a Ginger male  kitten with a non-ginger sister at the animal shelter. I've been looking at the web site that shows all the animals in the shelter regularly and they have a lot of kittens this time of year. There is also a pair of Ginger females who came in together who are about a year old. I don't know if they are sisters or not but one picture shows them cuddling.
gingerkitty,3cq8x4,Neebat,5,Fri Jul 10 00:03:45 2015 UTC,"If you want a guaranty that two cats will get along, getting a brother and sister may not be enough.  The shelter where I've adopted 3 cats has ""Cat Colony"" rooms where you can watch the cats interacting with each other, and there you can definitely tell which cats are comfortable together.  They'll be older cats, so they won't go through all the personality changes (with unpredictable results) that you get with kittens.  If they're playing together at 2 years, they'll be friends forever."
gingerkitty,3cq8x4,MurphsLaw83,2,Fri Jul 10 00:27:21 2015 UTC,"I have a ginger boy who I've had since he was four weeks old. He's easy going but doesn't like to be manhandled. For a short time I had a second kitten, long story short he had congenital issues that took him after having him for a month but he and my ginger got along fine. I would get two young male kittens ginger or otherwise and they should bond."
gingerkitty,3cq8x4,Neebat,2,Thu Jul 9 23:35:41 2015 UTC,"I've only really known two gingers.  Sunshine was a smart cat and I miss him a lot.  Marvin is awesome.  Not sure about smart, but he's not dumb.  Wait, my new cat, Alex, is white and ginger.  He may be retarded, but I love him."

gingerkitty,3cq8x4,PTgoBoom1,2,Fri Jul 10 00:28:32 2015 UTC,"We rescued my ginger boy, Hudson, when our American domestic, Zuma,  was about 2 years old. Hudson was about 6 weeks old. We kept them isolated for about a week before slowly introducing them. The first time we left them alone together we came home to find him sparkling clean: she groomed the heck out of him and that was it, they were bonded. We recently rescued a male tuxedo boy, about a year old, and Zuma still wants to murder him. Hudson, though, is super chill with the new guy. Go figure. Also, Hudson is slyly clever and very, very loving. Hope this helps."
gingerkitty,3cq8x4,Paper_Thin_Walls,2,Fri Jul 10 00:52:42 2015 UTC,"My ginger Phil is something else. He's 6-7 now? He got along great with my parents little grey cat but now that lil grey is in my house Phil doesn't approve. They tolerate each other, but Phil likes to start shit. Phil is a chatterbox, he loves to talk to me and tell me when he's ready to eat. Gingers have A LOT of energy. Phil and lil grey are both indoor and outdoor kitties. It has helped everyone in our home to be more at ease. He needs to get his energy out. I'll find him climbing trees or chasing lizards. He is also an escape artist. Very sneaky and quiet. I must say he's a little quirky & doofy. That's what I love about it. I must give it to grey, he's smarter than Phil but, Phil is...Phil! And I love them both for who they are."
gingerkitty,3cq8x4,disshortybtexan,2,Fri Jul 10 01:19:29 2015 UTC,"I managed to rescue a female ginger with her 2 buddies from a drug addict a little over a year ago. One of the 2 buddies was a ginger male.. so a litter of 5 gingers were born! One girl out of the bunch.   So what I know:  My ginger girl is crazy smart. She learns to associate things super quickly. She knows the harness means time for outside, the laser pen is laser. And she insists on sitting on me after my alarm goes off in the morning. She's very much a lap cat! She's right next to me right now with her head on my legs :) She also snuggles and cleans her Tortie buddy (we think her daughter from a previous litter).  I don't know too much about how her kittens turned out (we gave some away to friends of friends and I don't want to be a creeper), but I know they all ended up being really good cats . One comment I heard was ""he's the best cat ever"" another boy just got a new kitten brother and he tolerates him well. So I really don't think you can go wrong either way. But ginger girls are so special, it might be worth patiently waiting to find one!  I think you should get the snuggly girl pair from the shelter!"

If I sleep too long, which to his standards is past 5 am, he gets lonely and knocks things off my dresser and meows. I do love him, but some days are challenging.  I think really, it just comes down to the individual cat. I also had a ginger who was quiet and shy and never got into trouble."

gingerkitty,3cq8x4,pumpmar,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:19:13 2015 UTC,"I had a ginger boy, gone now 20 years. I still miss him.  He opened doors, loved water (would climb into sinks, drink from faucets, take a shower with you, etc.), liked to sit on top of doors (he'd climb the jamb), and riding on people's shoulders or on the canister vacuum (if roombas had existed then he would have loved it).  He was smart and sneaky and fun. He liked to get his nails filed with emery boards - he would find one and bring it to you.  He was once caught on top of my sister's dresser, in front of a mirror, where he had opened a drawer, was pulling out clothing piece by piece, looking at himself in the mirror with each piece, and then tossing it aside.  Orange cats are the best."

gingerkitty,3bwnfh,Cheeseisextra,3,Thu Jul 2 19:33:00 2015 UTC,Thanks everyone. He was a mostly inside cat and was able to go out with me and watch me do yardwork daily. Never saw him across the street. Got let out that morning at 7:00 and got hit by a speeding truck at 7:15. I saw him the night before but didn't get to even say good morning to him. Wifey let him out and that was it. Speed limit on my road is posted 30 but this truck was doing at least 50 or more. Heard a horn honk and brakes screeching and she opened the front door and he was crying from the road looking at her. I was in the bathroom and heard her scream. Put my shoes on and there he was. I got to him and he twitched twice and died in my arms as I carried him back to the house. Best cat ever. He was my seven year old autistic sons cat.  Still cry over him.
