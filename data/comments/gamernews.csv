gamernews,3e3nri,Torvusil,6,Tue Jul 21 18:32:47 2015 UTC,Does every game really need its zombie version?
gamernews,3e3nri,SomeOtherNeb,2,Tue Jul 21 18:57:18 2015 UTC,Makes you wonder what the next fad in the line up to get beaten to death will be. Zombies are so easy.
gamernews,3e3nri,micmea1,5,Tue Jul 21 19:50:39 2015 UTC,"Well. World War 2, then Zombies, now Early Access Survival Games."
gamernews,3e3nri,pie-oh,4,Tue Jul 21 20:50:44 2015 UTC,Half the survival games have zombies tho
gamernews,3e3nri,micmea1,4,Tue Jul 21 20:54:08 2015 UTC,"This is true. Are any set in World War 2? If not, I have the ultimate game to sell tomorrow."
gamernews,3e3nri,pie-oh,4,Tue Jul 21 20:56:42 2015 UTC,Nazi zombies?
gamernews,3e3nri,micmea1,2,Tue Jul 21 21:15:48 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed Breach & Clear. I really hate zombies though. This one will be a dilemma.
gamernews,3dyxsn,Torvusil,14,Mon Jul 20 17:45:35 2015 UTC,Odin Sphere is one of my favorite games. It blew me away on the PS2. Really excited for this!
gamernews,3dyxsn,solarnoise,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:39:49 2015 UTC,"I loved the game! It's gorgeous, but the slowdown was killing it for me. I'm hoping it'll run buttery smooth this time. I don't mind buying a game over again if it keeps getting better."
gamernews,3dyxsn,highfivebrah,3,Mon Jul 20 23:42:33 2015 UTC,"I had the PSN download version of it and IIRC that didn't slowdown at all, so I would assume this version, even if it is an HD upgrade, wont either."
gamernews,3dyxsn,pixel_illustrator,0,Mon Jul 20 23:57:37 2015 UTC,"Did you actually play it through to completion? Having had slogged through the shitpile that was Odin Sphere to the very end, I can thoroughly say it was NOT a good game. Beautiful? Absolutely. It's one of the most beautiful games out there, and still is.  But having to trudge through the same exact area for the 5th time and having to fight the exact same bosses for the Xth time, with the only different being the character you're playing, paired with how all your progress on one character gets reset when you swap to another, and how you HAVE to play all 5 character's stories to beat the game...it just wasn't worth it.  If you want to play through Odin Sphere, do yourself a favor and quit after finishing the first character's story. There is nothing new or of value after, there's only tears."
gamernews,3dyxsn,Narrative_Causality,4,Tue Jul 21 09:00:28 2015 UTC,"Dammit Vannillaware, make it for PC too please!"
gamernews,3dyxsn,Colorfag,4,Tue Jul 21 01:35:45 2015 UTC,"Huh, cool, it looks like they're focusing on upgrading the combat system to give each character more unique moves and--OH WHAT THE FUCK DO I CARE THEY'RE MAKING A NEW ODIN SPHERE HOLY SHIT THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER  It burns usss"

gamernews,3dyxsn,Scipion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:56:58 2015 UTC,I agree.  Its great that they take chances on non mainstream games that may not ever be brought over otherwise
gamernews,3dyxsn,Seasian,2,Tue Jul 21 13:54:05 2015 UTC,"Neat. I bought Odin Sphere but sadly got completely stonewalled at the first boss, dropping random undodgeable crap all over the place endlessly.  I wonder if they'll ever do Princess Crown again or if they consider it an obsolete predecessor? I made it really far in the Japanese PSP port and had a lot of fun with it - it looks like many basic mechanics of Odin Sphere came from it too."
gamernews,3dyxsn,DenjinJ,2,Tue Jul 21 02:47:13 2015 UTC,So is this a remake or a sequel?   Any news of a US release?
gamernews,3dyxsn,Draffut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:43:10 2015 UTC,"Remake with substantially more content from the looks of the trailer (new areas, abilities, overhauled potion mechanics, etc). No news of a US release but this was just announced for JP so I wouldn't worry yet."

gamernews,3dyxsn,red_rock,5,Mon Jul 20 20:17:38 2015 UTC,What are you talking about? The only woman that had revealing clothing was the one with the gypsy look.

gamernews,3dyxsn,Jontpan,2,Tue Jul 21 05:40:50 2015 UTC,haha thanks but i watched it twice and i think thats enough for me. I guess we'll have to chalk it up to different taste.  I still think calling them prostitutes still a bit much.

Skimpy dresses can be excused in appropriate gameplay sequences, in for example a bathing scene. In this game one of the character you play is dressed this way, and is extra noticeable when this character is walking around in a snowy landscape."
gamernews,3dyxsn,red_rock,3,Tue Jul 21 05:44:59 2015 UTC,"Hi Polygon!!!! I look forward to you 6/10 review of this game, talking about how awesome it is, but completely ruined by a few skimpy outfits. Never change, Polygon."
gamernews,3dyxsn,ElvisFartsUhHuhs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:47:21 2015 UTC,"Well, depends for who this game is for, if your an adult and don´t find this sort of thing silly. By all means enjoy this sort of thing. Not my cup of tea.   But I wouldn't want to see kids playing this. And it´s not because I think the imagery is offensive or anything.   I would not want hypothetical daughter to grow up thinking this is how cool girls, or action girls dresses. Why can´t she have a cool armor too?  And I would not want my hypothetical son to grow up thinking that this is how women should be dressed.   Is just a shame. Looks like a fun game for every one."
gamernews,3dyxsn,red_rock,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:53:21 2015 UTC,"Trust me, your hypothetical daughter would listen to whatever you told her.  No kid would see this and think that. They'll see worse at the Waterpark."
gamernews,3dyxsn,ElvisFartsUhHuhs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:28:57 2015 UTC,"It´s all about context.   I am currently thoroughly enjoying Witcher 3 at the moment. A game about some dude who is looking for his daughter and fucks every whore he comes across.  There are uncensored boobs every where, and I am fine with it.  No sensible adult should let their kid play that game (oh god the fetus mission...), but the game is not advertised to them either. And even though it has all of this nudity, it has it in the right context. You don´t walk around in the street and every one is dressed like whores. It´s exactly what you would expect from an medieval setting. And if you engage a women in Sex, yes you will see boobs. And if you go to a bar you will find strumpets.   This game is the opposite. There is no reason to why these women should be dressed like that, other to satisfy some horny teenagers.  Why does the guys have cool armor, but not the girls? The main character is running around in a blizzard with a bra and a skirt smaller then a handkerchief. And why is this such a common phenomena in Japanese games?  For a moment, imagine if it was reversed. All the male characters had just thongs and some boots on them, while the women wore bad-ass armor. What a weird game that would be.  Now imagine that all Japanese games where like that, and even a lot of western games.  All you get to play as is either bad-ass females or thong boys that moans all the time.   Wouldn't you start thinking that, hey what the hell is going on here?  Now imagine that you have a son, that grows up with that shit. He really like playing those thong boys. He even starts to dress like that, it´s the new fad. Going to com-icon dressed with only a thong and boots. Etc etc.   Is there somewhere along those lines that you would say. You know what, something is wrong here? Or would you find that scenario perfectly normal?   You know what, that scenario is perfectly normal, but for girls. But some how it´s an ok situation for them? Now I am not a feminist, I just believe that shit should be equal. And some of the things out there for kids are not ok, this is one of them. It´s obvious why the girls are dressed that way."
gamernews,3dyxsn,red_rock,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:17 2015 UTC,Or maybe because that was just the decision of the artist?
gamernews,3dyxsn,ElvisFartsUhHuhs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:11:07 2015 UTC,"Yes? Why did the artist decide that? What is the artist looking for? It´s not realism, or trying to emulate any actual clothing that would function. Perhaps it ""just looks good"", sure, why do all the men look good in armor, but not the women?  Their can only be two reasons, either the artists think it´s hot and it´s fulfilling his fantasies, or he believes his audience likes this sort of stuff and hoping to make money out of it. Slutty dressed women to horny male teenagers."
gamernews,3dyxsn,red_rock,2,Tue Jul 21 17:21:37 2015 UTC,Or maybe it's just what they wanted to draw?

All I did was point out how it does have something to do with Odin and norse mythology and you somehow got more butthurt over it than anyone has any right being.  Crazy fucking thing here, but I can simultaneously acknowledge that I'm not crazy about character designs like this and also extol the various great game design concepts in Odinsphere. The two A.) ain't mutually exclusive and B.)  aren't nearly as much a part of the game as your slanted viewpoint is making them. Especially considering that every character other than the one I pointed out is an adult."

gamernews,3drv2x,rustinr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:13:34 2015 UTC,"also using a xbox controller. well rather a ps4 that emulates xbox input.  the thing is, the moment you push the left stick in a direction while swimming up or down you have a ridiculous amount of delay. often geralt stops completely in his movements for a few seconds, readjusts himself and then begins to swim again and sometimes he stops for a second time.  simliar things go for running, which I have a hard time believing that they adjusted anything at all there. if you run and change direction, lets say 180° it takes half a second or 1 second before any of that input is recognized. that is abysmal IMO.  the only difference I noticed was for the normal walking animation, he goes faster into a jog and stops a bit sooner when you release the stick, steers better left and right and so on.  As far as I'm concerned they didn't fix a thing.  I also edited the .ini-file to make the input more responsive and it still sucks."

Meanwhile CDPR themselves said back in 2013 the game contains ""30,000+"" lines of dialogue (for all characters total). More recent statements have been about word count, at around 450k. If the 70k lines for Geralt statistic was true, then that'd be only 6 words per line. For Geralt alone. Not counting other characters. So I highly doubt he has 70k lines, even if many of those lines were single words with different inflections. The 30,000 lines total statistic sounds more reasonable, averaging about 15 words per line, across all characters. Or even 70k for all characters in Witcher 3, but definitely not Geralt alone.  On the actual record of lines of dialogue: New Vegas used to hold the world record for most lines of dialogue in a video game at 65k. This was beaten by SWTOR in 2012 with 200,000 lines.

Especially with that guy being all intense and dramatic, and there's another guy in the background just chilling on the couch looking around with that empty ""What's goin' on here?"" look slapped all over his chevy chase. That part just rubbed me the wrong way. And enemy AI and combat still looks like something out of 1998.  Graphically though, looks really decent. And I like how the protagonist speaks now, and cameras actually switch during dialogues. Though lip sync and facial animations still look weak compared to what I'm playing now (Witcher 3)."

I'm fairly certain by the time the game is rereleased it'll be cracked. But this far it hasn't been.   Edit: It's currently a steal at $15 if you're okay dealing with the gray market in G2A.

gamernews,3dibf9,The-ArtfulDodger,14,Thu Jul 16 16:49:15 2015 UTC,What you do is your business but now that Steam has a decent refund policy you could just buy the game after getting some positive feedback from gaming forums and if you are not happy with the result use your right to refund.  The only argument against this is Steam not having the best price for the game requiring to buy it from somewhere like GMG which won't allow your to ask for a refund (they only exceptionally allowed refunding Arkham Knight because it was such a huge clusterfuck).
gamernews,3dibf9,shadowboxer47,-9,Thu Jul 16 16:52:35 2015 UTC,Sorry but after the latest ordeal I won't be giving any money to this company until I've ascertained the game is in a working state.  I think that's perfectly reasonable considering the release of the PC version had worse performance and graphics than the PS4 version.. which is frankly ridiculous.  They have demonstrated their lack of regard for the PC community in this short sighted act. They probably wouldn't have initiated a recall at all if it weren't for the timely arrival of Steam refunds.  So taking these points into consideration I am actively motivated not to send any money their way until I know I can trust them again.
gamernews,3dibf9,ours,7,Thu Jul 16 16:59:04 2015 UTC,"""Until I know the game is in a working state.""  Which is exactly what steam refunds are for.  Don't add a moral justification to your pirating."

It's too bad that WB pulled the PC port from Rocksteady.   I'm guessing this was done by necessity. Of course you'd want Rocksteady doing the port if they didn't already have their plates loaded with whatever they were working on.   The time frame we are looking at here is Rocksteady sifting through the shit code from the port, finding the bugs, and fixing them.   Something that should have been taken care of prior to the game's release. Go ahead and release the PC version 6 months after the console version a la GTA V if you have to. I don't think any of us would have had a problem with that. But when you deliberately try to trick people out of their money by taking advantage of preorders and releasing a damn near defective product, you deserve to lose sales and good will.  I understand that Rocksteady probably had no say in this, and it sucks that a good developer gets hurt by it, but I refuse to patronize WB Games after they chose to release this game in the god awful state it was in."

Hopefully they've fixed that up. The E3 demo looked awesome, but I'm looking forward to seeing some uncut gameplay so we can get a handle how it really plays. PC exclusive means it should run pretty well, and they're able to do a lot of things this time that they couldn't last time, like randomly generated levels."

gamernews,3dibf9,commonplatypus,14,Sun Jul 19 13:03:59 2015 UTC,This is pretty much expected. The type of problems it has require massive rewrites to the PC version of the engine. You're not going to get that in a couple weeks.
gamernews,3dibf9,morphinapg,11,Sun Jul 19 13:17:10 2015 UTC,"I think the question I would be asking here as someone in software development, is what the fuck was going on with product management and QA (if there even was any) that it got this bad? Code this broken shouldn't have made it past QA or User Acceptance Testing.  Bad software happens when you skip shit and let it slide in the software development lifecycle and get tunnel vision on releasing instead of making a quality product."
gamernews,3dibf9,Rumpullpus,9,Thu Jul 16 17:37:05 2015 UTC,"The QA knew how the game was running, as many internal sources said. The problem was that WB gave the PC port to a cheap port studio, likely the lowest bidder, and they couldn't deliver, and WB had a release date they had already delayed twice. Most likely they would have seen a bigger backlash had they delayed it several months more on PC, simply because gamers wouldn't have know the extent of the problems. So it was a lower risk to release it as is and patch it later. At least some people will be able to run it. While they had to take it off the shelves, the people who preordered it still got it when they expected to, and the game was playable with the right hardware, but once Rocksteady saw the state of the PC version they felt they had no choice but to take it off until they could fix it themselves. So now Rocksteady is working on it instead of that low bid PC port studio."
gamernews,3dibf9,morphinapg,5,Thu Jul 16 18:16:22 2015 UTC,"but once Rocksteady saw the state of the PC version they felt they had no choice but to take it off until they could fix it themselves.   doubt that. their past batman games had issues at launch in the past too, some just as bad as this latest one and I never saw any respect for their games or the customers from them then. IMO what really happened is they saw that the PC port wasn't ready, but shipped it anyway because they knew people would buy it day one or had preorders and poof, there goes the money never to be seen again just like they always did.  unfortunately for WB and Rocksteady steam started the refund system almost a week before launch. suddenly no more money for WB over a broken PC port and WB got caught with their dick in their hand.  EDIT: less than 3mins and my comment is already getting downvoted lol. some people would probably buy dog shit if I said rocksteady made it."
gamernews,3dibf9,Rumpullpus,5,Thu Jul 16 23:29:01 2015 UTC,"Rocksteady wasn't involved in the PC port at all before launch. It's likely they had no idea how bad the issues were. WB are to blame here, not Rocksteady.   And yeah there were some issues in Asylum and City on pc at launch, but absolutely nowhere near as bad. When I played them shortly after launch they were rock solid and I have never had a top of the line pc.   Origins had tons of problems yeah but again, that wasn't Rocksteady."
gamernews,3dibf9,morphinapg,-2,Thu Jul 16 23:37:07 2015 UTC,that's some serious mental gymnastics. as soon as Rocksteady put their name on it they owned it. passing the buck on to outsourcing is the kinda bullshit Randy Pitchford does. 3 games that have shitty launches and your all just gonna brush it off like that?
gamernews,3dibf9,exus,6,Fri Jul 17 02:53:27 2015 UTC,"They created the game, but they weren't involved in the PC port at all. Warner Bros specifically hired a different (cheap) team to do that. Publishers do that all the time to save money.  And no, Rocksteady did not have 3 ""shitty"" launches. They have a really good reputation for a reason."
gamernews,3dibf9,morphinapg,-1,Fri Jul 17 02:55:46 2015 UTC,"A really good reputation? When was the last time you heard of a game being suspended for sale, and then brick and mortar chains even returning games to the publisher for being so bad. Whether you want to suck the dick of Rocksteady dry or not, it's still their game and their problem the moment it has their name on it."
gamernews,3dibf9,FallenWyvern,4,Fri Jul 17 03:10:23 2015 UTC,"No, WB owns the game. THEY decide who works on what parts of the game, so it's their fault if one of their decisions results in a bad product. Nothing Rocksteady did resulted in these problems, and there's nothing Rocksteady could have done to prevent them, as they weren't working on the PC port.   And I was referring to Rocksteady's reputation prior to the release of Arkham Knight, obviously."

gamernews,3dibf9,virulentArachnid,3,Fri Jul 17 03:17:28 2015 UTC,Its called outsourcing it to a small team without giving a shit. QA would have known the port was shit but nothing could be done because of the small team.

gamernews,3dibf9,KingOfSomeThings,2,Thu Jul 16 19:59:10 2015 UTC,"...there's only 4. That's an extremely reasonable number of games for one series. The first one, the sequel, the prequel, and the finale. They all have their place in the story and despite this last one's PC failure, all were significant to the overall plot. I actually think they produced exactly the amount they should've for this series"
gamernews,3dibf9,ketsugi,4,Thu Jul 16 16:20:16 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong but Asylum was 2009 I believe so it's been over 6yrs. And if the plan is to release 4 from the beginning it's not a bad thing.  It's when they go AC about it and decide ""oh actually, here's another 4"" that they clearly lose quality"
gamernews,3dibf9,Nerrs,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:48:36 2015 UTC,"The games have all been 2 years apart so I'm not sure where you've gotten the idea that they've been annual releases. 2009, 2011, 2013 and finally 2015."
gamernews,3dklo5,RangeroftheNight,3,Fri Jul 17 00:57:30 2015 UTC,Kinda been suspecting this. I wrote freelance for the game and hadn't heard news in a long time. Then noticed one of my characters popping up as a Battleborn hero.
gamernews,3dklo5,TajesMahoney,2,Fri Jul 17 08:10:22 2015 UTC,"Not surprised it got canned based on the reaction. It was silly of them to brand in with BiA. Although after they took the BiA it looked liked it could have been a fun game.   Also this week, Pitchford has confirmed a new and ""authentic"" Brothers in Arms is on the way.    Now that is exciting news. It has been way too long since hell's highway can't wait to find out the rest of the characters stories."
gamernews,3dklo5,magicjj7,2,Fri Jul 17 14:01:55 2015 UTC,Oh God yes. Hell's Highway was amazing when it came to narrative. There's few FPS games that tell a story quite like that.
gamernews,3dklo5,Frosty7130,2,Sat Jul 18 19:16:19 2015 UTC,"Not using my main account to say this -- although the NDA has run out (was a 2 year NDA)...  Furious 4 was incredibly fun.  It would have been an amazing experience to have with 3 friends and experience some Inglorious Basterds / B-movie style World War II action... but alas, we won't get the chance.  It's a shame, because it was one of the main things playtested at Gearbox that I was 110% on board with and would have loved to see the final product."
gamernews,3dklo5,callthemlikeiseethem,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:24:13 2015 UTC,I was actually looking forward to a non-serious Inglorious Basterds type of game set in WWII (ninja edit - though naming it BiA was not a great move). Battleborn just looks uninteresting IMO

gamernews,3dg28v,Terrarianator,4,Thu Jul 16 00:06:01 2015 UTC,Anyone feel like running down what this game is?
gamernews,3dg28v,Roike,11,Thu Jul 16 02:56:32 2015 UTC,"From my memory in the other games you start off as a wanderer entering the region.  There tends to be several locations and a time passing system.  You play out events and story lines in the area with some of them being obvious and others not so much.  In general it is a pretty open game with huge replay ability allowing you to pick multiple sides and paths each time you play through it.  You can level up swords and unlock a bunch of silly content as well.  In general this entry seems to have made it easier to follow instead of relying on events you don't know about and adds in a bunch of fun minigames like ""Night Crawling"" where you sneak into someones house and the image of the turtles head lengthening leads you to their bed (knock out any family members that try to stop you) and you then wrestle with them until you can thrown them back onto the matress.  ( https://youtu.be/KrQAOvR5oFY?t=144 )  I always liked the comedy the games bring and highly recommend it if you like sword fighting."
gamernews,3dg28v,Braddigan,3,Thu Jul 16 03:16:27 2015 UTC,"spot on, only played 3 and looooved it, it's a fresh fun series that's really fun and simple."
gamernews,3dg28v,Tejirof,2,Thu Jul 16 04:33:40 2015 UTC,"3 is better than 4 IMO, they try to give 4 a more complicate storyline progressing but end up half assed everything. I still can't find a copy of 3plus thought..."
gamernews,3dg28v,manmanchan,2,Thu Jul 16 08:51:28 2015 UTC,3 is on the PSN's rental system and I am tempted to check it out.  Unfortunately I worry that my nostalgia made this series out to be greater than it was.
gamernews,3dg28v,Gougaloupe,2,Thu Jul 16 15:16:10 2015 UTC,"Do check it out man, 3 is a great game. But it would be a good idea to read some walkthrough or wiki first. 3 is a very different game from 1&2."

gamernews,3dg28v,byoonbyoon,3,Fri Jul 17 13:40:32 2015 UTC,"The way of the samurai games are some of my favourites. It should be noted (especially for PC players) that the games have always had shit graphics. I am fine with that but you may not be. Regardless the games all take between 3-6 hours to beat. Doesn't sound like much, but due to that you have multiple endings and storylines for each. In 4 you for two different outcomes for each of the 4-5 factions that you can join. The rebels, the magistrate, the Brits, and the fuckface minister. Besides those main ends you also have like 8 or 10 other ends the may be taken. Some involve knowingly dying ECT. I haven't played in a while so idr exactly how many endings there are.   The fighting can be done with hands, two swords, one sword, spear, or gun. There are many many many different styles of fighting to unlock. The fighting is set up with a block button, two buttons for levels of sword strikes, and different combos to activate those strikes. I would heavily recommend using a controller. As you fight, you can build up a gauge called spring harvest or something where each move does absurd damage and everyone you kill stands up until you deactivate it and they all fall down like in a samurai movie.  There are many minigames as mentioned above as well including doing work for the yakuza and the magistrate as well as sex torture games and the nightcrawling. Importantly you can also open your own dojo and beat random towns people until they accept joining.  The most interest part of the game revolves around the persistent state of the game when you finish. One storyline might need the school open, so you may need to do another storyline halfway, open the school then retire (or just beat it if you want)."
gamernews,3dg28v,Shadzzyx,2,Thu Jul 16 13:51:29 2015 UTC,Is there anything 4 does (gameplay wise) that 3 did better?  I left off at 2 and I'm not sure if its worth pursuing all the sequels or just the latest.
gamernews,3dg28v,Gougaloupe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:18:04 2015 UTC,"I would recommend getting three as well if you can. 3 has a more classic story where there are actual armies fighting and you can choose sides, and gameplay wise, if you do a perfect block, you get a button prompt and can install kill your opponent. You can chain these attacks which feels pretty good.   Also crafting is a bit better imo. The random jobs you can get in 3 vary from really good to utter shit. There are more random jobs in three than 4. In three there is a button who's whole purpose I to make you dogeza or w\e (apologize) there aren't 1000000 skills to learn and the quests are easier to find in the main story without wandering thru each section of the map to activate it. Beware that you can kill the save points (which are musicians)"

Make a Fable game where your character appearance changes based off morality like in the first two games (not the 3rd), a world with real consequence (I hated being able to do anything as king), a large exploring world, and elaborate story with twists that require more than a button push, and I would be one happy camper."

Where planting an acorn in the soil, playing for 3 months, and coming back, actually leaves a fucking tree.   If it's any generation to do it, it's this one.

Sequels in games, especially in established genres can be really refreshing. Take super mario for example, first game set a new benchmark for platformers. Second game (that wasn't released in US, but later was released as the lost levels) was just the more harder levels. And in my book not deserving of being called super mario 2. Then again back then we didn't have DLC and they hadn't yet really invented add-ons, so for that reason alone, it´s ok in my book. Super Mario 3 took platforming to a new level. With new abilities, and more new gameplay elements. Super Mario World for the SNES wasn't really ground breaking,  it was very similar to the third game. It took mario to the 16 bit, and added some mechanics such as Yoshi. What really stood out was Yoshi's island, not a sequel, but a spin off. Mario 64 showed the world how to control a character in 3D, in a time where everything was plagued with bad controls and people where really second guessing if moving to 3D was such a smart move. it made 3rd person 3D games possible. Mario sunshine was derivative, it tried to add the backpack mechanics, and in the end it was an ok game, but easily forgotten. Super Mario Galaxy was a refreshing release, it showed us that Mario was still relevant and a platformer still could be imaginative and refreshing. Adding planetoid with the own gravitational pull was a genius move, and while super mario galaxy 2 was more of the same it was clear that the team had plenty of more ideas, enough for a second game. It´s probably the best mario game ever made. Then we had the new super mario series, that didn´t really add anything new. All it did was that it play on nostalgica. Super Mario 3D world world more or less a clone of Super Mario 3D, but it added one significant function, good multiplayer. Something that they had tried to add in the new super mario series but it just was to chaotic.   Looking at that youtube video, what does JC3 add? Between the 2nd game and this one we have had GTA5 be released. And now they show us basically the same game without multiplayer. Something that fans wanted so much that they created a mod for the seccond game to add it. So really it has less features then the game before it. It´s the same game! Sure JC2 was fun, but I stopped playing the that game because I grew tired of it, I had my fill. I was really hoping that the third game would fill my thirst for more open world destruction but add new elements to it. Could have been a good story, could be that it was set in a extremely new environment could have been multiplayer. Now if you like reruns, that´s fine. But I don´t."

Don't talk to me like I'm Reddit Man, the caricature  of every other Redditor that you picture in your head. That's entirely unhelpful.   A lot of text about how Mario evolved   OK. Fair enough. I mean it's a somewhat relevant diatribe about the changes in an unrelated series that you did and didn't like. I don't think it really applies to the sequel to a sandbox game.  The physics, graphics, and toys are clearly not the same as Just Cause 2. If you'd just said you'd rather they'd included multiplayer, and would prefer to not play through a bad story again, that would be one thing.

gamernews,3ddls8,red_rock,2,Thu Jul 16 05:54:57 2015 UTC,"They didn't really show off guns. I hope they take a backseat to the combat. Rico's tools are way more OP than any gun. It reminds me of Ravenholm in Half-Life 2, where the physics come to shine instead of gun combat. I just hope the game is clear on when to use physics and when to just shoot bullets. Maybe they'll take a Sleeping Dogs approach, where it becomes clear which is more fun to use. In times where JC2's physics wouldn't win a fight, it felt kinda meh because the gun gameplay was boring but the only way to advance.  Essentially, I hope that we can either have a revamped shooting mechanic to the game, or just use guns only when you don't feel creative enough to use physics to your advantage."

Then you've got things called racial motifs which unlock new crafting looks. This are the very expensive in game, but they only provide a different change of looks.

gamernews,3d99hk,corporateswine,100,Tue Jul 14 14:47:40 2015 UTC,Every website or blogger who reviews this game should always make a note of calling HIDEO KOJIMA'S Metal Gear Solid V as much as possible so this can Streisand.
gamernews,3d99hk,Te4RHyP3,19,Tue Jul 14 17:03:46 2015 UTC,"i wouldn't be surprised if Konami enforces a rule for major reviewers along the lines of ""you want access to review copies ? his name is nowhere in the review or else."""
gamernews,3d99hk,ruthloose,27,Tue Jul 14 18:51:48 2015 UTC,"Why not go ahead and break the embargo? It's not like Konami is going to seriously make another AAA game anywhere in the near future. Reviewers should call Konami out for what they really are... a health club and gambling company and not a major video game publisher.  EDIT: It sets a bad precedent for your media outlet, but it also shows a sense of moral obligation to the true history of the product at hand."
gamernews,3d99hk,ibbolia,7,Tue Jul 14 21:00:31 2015 UTC,Does it set a bad precedent? I would figure calling out companies out for trying to unperson your developers' projects would actually be really important.
gamernews,3d99hk,EvadableMoxie,3,Tue Jul 14 22:21:14 2015 UTC,"It's not like Konami is going to seriously make another AAA game anywhere in the near future.   Konami isn't, but other developers are going to care if you broke Konami's embargo because that means you could break theirs.  If you want to take the moral high ground then don't agree to something and then break the agreement, just refuse to agree in the first place.  Otherwise you tell companies you can't be trusted."
gamernews,3d99hk,ruthloose,-1,Wed Jul 15 04:05:03 2015 UTC,"Again, it's a case where I could see outlets ban together to entirely disagree or break embargo as a form of protest in honor of Kojima. You can't deny that the guy is known in quite a few circles."
gamernews,3d99hk,EvadableMoxie,3,Wed Jul 15 04:26:29 2015 UTC,"Breaking the embargo is basically sending the message to other companies that you can't be trusted with embargo.  It's career suicide.  And it's not going to benefit Kojima in any way.  It's like changing your facebook status to fight hungry in Africa, if somehow doing so would get you fired from your job.    I think everyone knows Kojima got screwed, and it's not like Kojima is going to be living on the streets dumpster diving.  At the very least he's going to be better off than any reviewer who breaks embargo."

And I bet many of those people will still act like they have to buy it even after they've pulled this shit. Seems like the ideal thing to support Kojima would be to bite the bullet and not buy his game as long as there's Konami on the box but I see that going over as well as a Boycott Call of Duty Steam group.  They're operating on a ""They'll buy it anyway"" basis. I'm not usually the guy that acts like companies like this are always out to screw people, but that logic is Shitty Companies 101."

The articles are extremely text heavy, and it's overwhelming enough to make me not want to sit down and read.  If this is an actual interview, I'd rather see the question you asked, and his response, over this editorial filler. It's a personal opinion, mostly because the industry tends to follow that design for all interviews. What you do would be more successful for shorter articles, and ones that aren't block quote heavy.  Good luck with your site!"

But I'm okay with the guy because I'm sure he didn't expect this to happen and is only meeting the demand."
gamernews,3d6kb4,Terrormask,4,Tue Jul 14 06:30:14 2015 UTC,"Yep, the game panders to the perfect demographic. It's built specifically for Twitch streamers and Youtube let's play, and people who love getting reactions out of friends and family. It's basically put jump scare, which is the best thing for those  ""watch this epic reaction"" videos."
gamernews,3d6kb4,Ph0X,6,Tue Jul 14 08:54:08 2015 UTC,So I'm curious what specific things you don't like about his fan base and what it's done for the genre.  I've never played the games but I think they're interesting.
gamernews,3d6kb4,Freekling,21,Tue Jul 14 07:27:11 2015 UTC,"The Fanbase part is obvious, google the name of the Game and put ""Fan"" in the search and the results are instant. It's almost as bad as the Bronies but with a lot younger people as the majority. The Game itself relies HEAVILY on the Jumpscare method of Horror. Now I will give credit the some of the backstory & ""Lore"" of the game is somewhat interesting and well thought out, but that's not what everyone perceives it as & doesn't factor in as the horror. The backstory is creepy at best, nothing that gives the game anymore depth in terms how the gameplay projects the horror. The game comes down to a simple challenge of ""Avoid the Jumpscare"" because most of the gameplay is about micromanaging cameras, & a limited power supply with the only hindrance being the Creepy Teddy Bear popping up to stop any progress. It's just an endurance round of how long can you mange these small tedious tasks in order to avoid the eventual jump scare? Nothing is really gained by the end of it, just the fact that it's over. I thought the concept was original with the first title, but it didn't warrant all these sequels within the same year."

Genyo Takeda (Representative Director; Senior Managing Director) Shigeru Miyamoto (Representative Director; Senior Managing Director)    It is unlikely to be Miyamoto, as he is a designer first and foremost, and mostly preoccupied with training his own successors in the field and working with Eiji Aonuma on Zelda. As Nintendo tends to promote from within, Genyo Takeda is the most likely candidate for CEO at a glance, with likely other high-ranking management promoted to fill the third Representative Director role, but it might be that as head of R&D he's as preoccupied as Shigeru... I think a lot of people will look to Reggie Fils-Aime for leadership in the interim period too, but I'm not sure Nintendo's corporate structure could abide moving the CEO role to an American, especially if he continued to operate from stateside."

gamernews,3d2fiz,420anonymous420,0,Mon Jul 13 02:05:27 2015 UTC,It's a grim day for gaming
gamernews,3d56a5,final_Crucible,3,Mon Jul 13 16:42:44 2015 UTC,"Well, they are better now than they have been, but yeah, still not great."
gamernews,3d56a5,morphinapg,3,Mon Jul 13 18:14:47 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, outside of your ""me too"" mentality and obvious EA hate response, what exactly do you not like about them.   Don't give me the run around every Redditor does about DLC maps and ""they ruin franchises!!!!!"".  I want your own reasons why. Because I'm pretty sure most if not all are ungrounded. EA has had a time when quality took a back seat to numbers. If you've played any recent title though, they've stepped their game up internally for just about every game.   Don't like Hardline or what they've done with Battlefront? That's ok, that's your opinion, but that doesn't make them bad games or a bad publisher."
gamernews,3d56a5,on_with_disease,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:56:44 2015 UTC,"Well, my reason for not liking them is that they are too corporate for my tastes. It feels that any game they acquire is given a far larger budget in exchange for deadlines. I don't like how deadlines have become a part of this entertainment product. I see video games as art, and I don't like how EA has handled their games in that respect.   I would argue that it's not EA that is ruining franchises, it's the small companies selling out to EA that may 'ruin' the franchise. But that's to be expected...it just sucks ass for those of us that don't mind waiting ~6 years for an immersive product.   There may be a Reddit hate train, but it took EA years to lay all that track."
gamernews,3d56a5,sometimes_i_downvote,2,Tue Jul 14 10:51:06 2015 UTC,"The companies they ""sucked the blood out of"" were dying and hadn't made anything worth while for years. Go on, give me an example of a studio that they aquired, then ran in the the ground, that had a recently profitable and high profile release prior to said acquisition. They don't exist.   And all of your examples are warranted, but can we say for 100% certainly that every game listed was the fault of EA? It's no secret Bioware and company have continued to offer a lesser and lesser RPG experience, with some of the worst story telling in recent memory. Ripping the RPG elements out of ME2 and 3 didn't help that trend.   We can point fingers all day, but they aren't doing anything any other developer hasn't. To say BF4 is an expansion to 3, and that Hardline is DLC, clearly shows you either haven't played the games, or you were already not the biggest fan and can easily find fault. The same could be said for CoD, no? But they're still fun unique games that hold their own.   As I originally called it, you're just spouting the same tired and unfounded bullshit you see on Reddit when ever EA is mentioned. I'm not trying to defend them, it's just getting old seeing the same drum get beat when I've watched closely as they continue to improve their customer relations in the form of better games."

When was it ever exciting to work for EA. I'd say probably always, unless you hate making video games."
gamernews,3d56a5,on_with_disease,2,Tue Jul 14 11:39:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe you're right on me, but at least I'm founding my opinions based on truth. Like the games I've PLAYED and the real consensus on the games I mentioned being shit due to Biowares terrible story telling.   What you're saying, that EA won't be doing any of the things they've mentioned, is completely a guess. You're simply guessing, based on your preconceived bias, that EA will continue to be as shitty as you see them now.   See the difference? You're calling the future of EA before they've even made any moves in this supposed new direction."
gamernews,3d56a5,on_with_disease,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:18:20 2015 UTC,"Oh, and mentioning PvZ, that is one franchise that has taken a complete nose dive, that I can agree on. But who can we blame? Clearly they're still able to make good classic puzzle games with Peggle 2, but what did they do with PvZ2? Monetized it and it didn't have that feel that the original had. Magazine, who's to blame? You can't just say it's EA because you don't like them. It can easily be Popcap considering the founders left, correct?"

PS3 backwards compatability just wont happen, thats why we have all these remasters.    Its easier to rebuild the entire game and update it than it is to port it and make it work when it was designed with their unique processor type they used with the PS3.  xbox doesnt have that issue and therefor has zero excuse."

gamernews,3cxpzg,Nushens,2,Sun Jul 12 01:19:31 2015 UTC,Why have I not heard of any of these three games? What genre are they?
gamernews,3cxpzg,Zeno84,2,Sun Jul 12 06:53:34 2015 UTC,"Auto Assault - Released in April 2006, Shut Down August, 2007. A bit unique in the MMORPG genre. It was a post apocalyptic vehicular combat RPG. Self proclaimed ""The fastest, most destructive MMO ever."" With three factions - Humans/Cybogs/Mutants. What class you chose determined what type of vehicles you got. For instance there scout/assassin type class drove motorcycles or small buggys. While your heavy class drove tanks. I played a healer for the mutants and started off with something similar to a Volkswagen van, but the vehicle I had when the game shut down was a big front end loader. There was ramming damage, guns and skills, plus each faction had an ultimate. For example cyborgs turned into these giant AT-AT walkers that wrecked stuff. It was by far my favorite MMO. Sadly it was released before it was really finished and there was little no end game besides open PvP. NCSoft pulled the plug in roughly a years time.   Heres some trailers - these are really bad quality though. I still have all the fan kits so with the original stuff so I may upload later.  The CG Trailer  Gameplay  Richard Garriott's Tabula Rasa - Released August 2007, Shut Down February 2009. Also a post apocalyptic story but with multiple planets. I don't have a whole lot of memories for this. I don't think I even made to max level. What I do recall was the class system. The classes were broken into trees. So you start off as a recruit, then you have two options. Then that option has two options. Then that option has two more options. So in the end at max level theres 8 classes. Every Class was able to utilize the abilities of all its root classes. I went for the tank class which ends up wearing this heavy storm trooperish looking armor and jumps into combat with a freakin power staff. Totally weird for a 3rd person shooter type game but I enjoyed it. Unforunately from my understanding Richard Garriott had a falling out with NCSoft and the pulled the plug here as well.

FC2 had multiple playable characters, much more challenging AI and gunplay, more interesting setting(Though that's subjective), was WAY longer, and just had more content in general, and encouraged you to explore all of that content a lot more. Your unlocks being tied to finding diamonds that were finite meant you explored a lot more than you had to in later games, and encouraged you to swap out weapons in the field a lot more than having cheap ultra-guns to just carry you through a playthrough(Not least of which because of weapons jamming and eventually breaking with overuse.). You got allies that you could befriend and get side missions from, and they would help you with your own missions, or even when just wandering about, either aiding you in combat, or saving your life when you ran out of health, and you had to reciprocate or you'd lose them forever.  3 and 4 were so barren and lackluster by comparison, with so many features ripped out, and WAY shorter and easier."

Too derivative, repetitive and shallow, plus being forced to use UPlay on top of Steam (which is my preferred method of organizing my gaming) take a toll.   Frankly, I feel that as a company their future now is heavily tied to Tom Clancy's ""The Division"". If that one is a big success, they could recover some of the goodwill they lost with their recent buggy offerings. But if that one is also a flop, I think a lot of people will write them off as a relevant entity and move on.  I am half-surprised they didn't try to blame the poor sales on piracy, or try to add another DRM on top of UPlay."
gamernews,3ctc5z,Sabbathius,5,Fri Jul 10 20:12:45 2015 UTC,"Ubi will be fine no matter what happens.  You are a hobby gamer, you pay attention to whats going on in the industry - you are not the target audience.  there are thousands of people who dont pay attention and buy their games, for every one of us who does.       Dont kid yourself, Ubi isnt going anywhere anytime soon."
gamernews,3ctc5z,Strategic-GamingTV,-3,Fri Jul 10 17:41:45 2015 UTC,"True, but once the hobbyist and hardcore gamer demographic moves on, and these people are what other mediums would call ""fans"", all you're left with are the whims of casuals, that come and go as the wind blows.  That's not a good place to be, because that target audience is volatile and flaky at best.  I mean, consider a company like Bethesda. Arguably, their games aren't even that great. They're good. Pretty damn good. But the company's strength mostly comes from a fan base, which they support strongly by being very modder-friendly. What's more, modders, for free, support their games. Skyrim came out 3 years ago, but it can still be played ""like new"" by installing a couple of mods that completely overhaul everything, from loot to combat mechanics and skill trees. Heck, there's Tropical Skyrim overhaul that turns it into a tropical paradise. And entire expansions-worth of content like Falskaar.  What's more, Bethesda doesn't have to come up with new features for future games. They can just take features from the most-used mods from the previous game. So they essentially get future product features for free, provided to them by their own fan base.  And they're not alone. Same thing with Firaxis and XCOM games. They recently said that with what modders did with the Long War mod, the original game is now nothing more than a 20hr tutorial to prepare a player for Long War playthrough.  But Ubi? Ubi shits all over these kinds of people, the creators of free content, the fans. And it will come back to bite them in the ass. Arguably, it already has. And sure, it doesn't mean the company will be closing or anything like that. But it'll take a nice chunk out of their income."
gamernews,3ctc5z,Sabbathius,2,Fri Jul 10 19:48:19 2015 UTC,"ubi is doing what ubi does best.    Blockbusters, which dont have that kind of stuff, in fact most game releases since the dawn of gaming have had no modding capability.  also, with xcom, firaxis didnt willingly give out the ability to mod - they are this time, but they played that game too before they realized, we'll do what we damn well want to their game after weve bought it.  modding capabilities are a relatively new thing to become accessible in the gaming world, that doesnt mean suddenly everyone should hand out the key to the heart of their product.    Some games arent created to be modded either."
gamernews,3ctc5z,Strategic-GamingTV,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:42:15 2015 UTC,"in fact most game releases since the dawn of gaming have had no modding capability.   Awww, come now. Dawn of gaming? How far do you want to go, are games on punch cards close enough to the dawn of gaming for ya? Because I can tell you right now, I modded the shit out of those. All you needed was more cards and a holepunch. Games on audio-tape written in Basic were moddable as well, you just loaded the game, and then you could go through its entire code line by line and do what you wished. Since graphics were drawn by pixel in code too, and music was synthesized note by note as well, pretty much anything was moddable. That's before game assets were actual images, before game audio started coming in *.midi files and the like. Do you remember Castle Smurfenstein from the '80s? The likes of Doom and Duke Nukem 3D modded to hell and back in early '90s. It wasn't modding the way we understand it now, but games were almost always moddable on PC, in some way, shape or form.  The point I'm trying to make, is that at the dawn of gaming games were arguably at their most moddable state. And some of the most popular titles were popular because they were moddable. Such as Doom and the like."
gamernews,3ctc5z,Sabbathius,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:15:43 2015 UTC,"Interesting post, but I think you overestimate the mod factor. I don't think the vast majority of consumers use or even acknowledge mods - in fact by design they don't because they play on consoles which don't (currently) support them. I'd love to know what percentage of Bethesda players use mods - I would bet it's less than 1%.  I don't think Ubisoft will change what they do, except when it's easy or profitable to do so. To have versions of their games that work smoothly is obviously desirable. To be fair to them, I think they've made a string of really interesting games over the years - I would guess they're financially in the best spot they've ever been in as a company, despite the complaints of a minority of their consumers."
gamernews,3ctc5z,Alex__V,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:29:31 2015 UTC,"Consider TESNexus (currently Nexus), that has almost 9.5 million members, and Skyrim alone has over 40,000 mod files on that site alone. That's a lot of modders and mods, just for Bethesda games.  XCOM mod Long War has 360,000 unique downloads. And 4.4 million views. And that game technically doesn't even support modding.  You can go to Steam Workshop and see the number of mods for various titles. Portal 2 for example has approximately half a million mods.  You can also log into Starcraft 2, for example, and see how many mods that game has.  By the by, ever hear about DotA? Guess how it started? As a mod for Warcraft 3. Gave rise to an entire genre, all by itself. Counter-Strike? A mod for Half Life, originally. Etc., etc.  It's...fairly mainstream. Console gamers are largely ignorant of this, true, because their platform doesn't support it 99.9% of the time.  Mods are a thing. And games that support mods sell better and live longer than the games that don't. Some companies literally make a living off of it, like Bethesda. All they do is release a game, wait a year, collect the mos popular mods, select what is easy to implement, stick it into the next game, re-skin it and release. Ta-da! Progress. Without mods, their games are actually fairly abysmal mechanically speaking (combat in Morrowind, leveling system in Oblivion, etc.)"
gamernews,3ctc5z,Sabbathius,0,Mon Jul 13 11:25:21 2015 UTC,"Some of the most popular games in the world started as mods, which is wonderful. Mods are a great thing, no doubt. A lot of mods are better than the games they are built upon. There's no dispute over the value of mods to those that experience them.  But the reality is that games from Bethesda, Ubisoft and the like currently sell the vast majority of their games on consoles. So mods are simply not a big factor when it comes to the industry - there is absolutely no pressure on Ubisoft or any other mainstream publisher to consider mods as part of their business strategy.  I think that the consumer reach of mods basically gets overstated, usually by fans of mods. There's a confirmation bias in saying that mods are what makes certain games great - you often need a great game to mod in the first place. I think it also depends what your tastes are as a gamer - I love the game-changing mods like Nehrim or Counter-Strike, but I have absolutely no interest for example in the tweak mods for Bethesda RPGs which I actually always play vanilla these days in order to experience the game as the devs intended.  And the simple fact is that the massive majority of gamers have absolutely no access to mods, on mobile or handheld or on console. It's a niche, a great niche no doubt, but a niche nonetheless."

gamernews,3cpvob,cookedbread,9,Fri Jul 10 00:06:29 2015 UTC,It's probably because things like hands and feet are disproportionate large. With 2D you can get away with things like that but when it's 3D it's much more obvious and cartoony.
gamernews,3cpvob,veriix,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:34:02 2015 UTC,Far more proportionate than 4 though. Ryu feet in 4 were massive.

Right arm looks like plasticine muscles put over a skeleton, incorrectly (i.e. not realistically) shaded forearm, no way that shadow would be as deep as that.

I wish they would have remained in the same genre. Instead we get cartoon rendering, less details and big ""hits"" effects when they attack like in old cartoon? Seems focused for combat with high health bars instead of twitch shooting with fast death, big empty areas instead of proper level design. Seems like taking a huge step backward."

gamernews,3ckat7,uberguby,8,Wed Jul 8 19:35:24 2015 UTC,"The map was gigantic,something like 1200 square miles. Not a heck of a lot to do in that map. Sure was big though."
gamernews,3ckat7,Bethlen,5,Wed Jul 8 23:26:53 2015 UTC,I enjoyed fuel :) as a relaxing game :p
gamernews,3ckat7,uberguby,2,Thu Jul 9 04:55:24 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed my time with it. I forget if you had to unlock parts of the map? I think you did, and I thought that was disapointing. I basically wanted an advanced road trip simulator.  fuel 2 needs like a munchie meter, and occasionally you'll have to stop in some quaint new england town for food, and also you would be able to get on the ghost tour."
gamernews,3ckat7,TeaDrinkingRedditor,5,Thu Jul 9 13:35:54 2015 UTC,"That's my worry. A video game world can be massively vast and incredibly detailed, but that's pointless if what you actually do is boring."

gamernews,3ckat7,nschubach,2,Wed Jul 8 23:46:09 2015 UTC,We have a very good reason to believe that from the info and gameplay they have showed.  You think a studio as small as Hello Games could afford to lie for things like that?
gamernews,3ckat7,a1blank,8,Thu Jul 9 00:29:16 2015 UTC,"TBO, yes.  A small studio can afford to close up shop and let everyone hire on somewhere else if they really want to.  I imagine the hype alone will have enough people buying this to allow the company to be profitable on launch alone and they could just close shop and move on if they really wanted."
gamernews,3ckat7,Hobocannibal,4,Thu Jul 9 00:19:18 2015 UTC,"That photo you linked to its about the amount of variation I'd expect to see in one planet. Take a look at Earth, that's the sort of variety Earth has, not the sort of variety that a solar system or a galaxy has."
gamernews,3ckat7,a1blank,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:08:19 2015 UTC,I wouldn't expect to see variety like that given the type of game. I'd normally only expect to see variety like that on one planet if the entire game takes place on said planet. You normally get planet types in a space game where most of the planet seems similar. With a few landmarks generated on it if the gameplay goes deeper.
gamernews,3ckat7,Hobocannibal,2,Thu Jul 9 09:09:34 2015 UTC,That seems like poor justification for single-biome planets.
gamernews,3ckat7,on_with_disease,0,Thu Jul 9 10:39:51 2015 UTC,Well... it would be the exception if every planet would be that varied. It would be nice but I haven't seen any space games that randomly generate worlds which go that far.... closest i can think of is starbound but i doubt people will be comparing this game to that.
gamernews,3ckat7,a1blank,0,Thu Jul 9 13:36:17 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point of the game entirely. We're not exploring Earth. If you look at planets in our let solar system, they all have a theme. Not quite as clear cut perhaps, but they do.   One may be filled with a certain gas, no water l, sandy ground. Another green from gas, rivers and craters. You get the idea. The all have a theme.   Using Earth as a comparison isn't valid, as its ecosystem and closeness to the sun change yearly as it rotates. Being in the Goldie locks zone to begin with changes how our planet forms and behaves. It's just all around a terrible argument."
gamernews,3ckat7,on_with_disease,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:11:30 2015 UTC,"So the planets in NMS are all single-biome?  That's just stupid.  The variety in the photo that was posted is the sort of variety (via biomes) you'd expect in a single world.  Trying to justify it with ""Goldilocks"" claims doesn't fix the problem of lack of diversity."
gamernews,3ckat7,willxcore,0,Thu Jul 9 10:57:13 2015 UTC,"So you're expecting a game of this scale and it's vastness to have a plethora of diversity in each of its climates and habitats? That's asking for a little much. But clearly the game isn't for you because the planets aren't 15 different environments.  Some people get what the game is. You're someone who does not. Each world is randomly generated, this much you know. But once they're generated, that's it. It'll never change. Each planet will have its own little characteristics and personality that won't be found in other planets. Various gases, plant and animal life, those security bots will be in varying forms. Along with NPC and players to combat against.   Why does each planet need to be modeled after Earth, when other planets that aren't habitable are extremely similar to what you see in NMS (minus the obvious animals and plants)??"
gamernews,3ckat7,monkeyjay,16,Thu Jul 9 13:34:42 2015 UTC,I have no idea why anyone thinks it's anything more than a single player exploration game akin to a glorified Minecraft. The technology is just an algorithm that generates the universe with a seed of variables. The different atmospheres/water/soil/foodchains are just pre designed variables that are plugged into the algorithm. That's why they are able to say there are millions of unique objects. The game is literally just different combinations of the assets that their art team created.

Neither do I. Even the original comments wording: ""I want this game to be exactly what it's supposed to be,"". Where the fuck are people getting these expectations from? I have seen just about every interview and footage of the game since it was announced and people were buzzing about it and I can't for the life of me figure out why people are expecting so much more than what it clearly IS.   It's absolutely nothing like Spore in the way that I can't think of anything that has been deceptive or misleading in what they've shown of the game so far.

They have said from the beginning that this will be a simple-yet-elegant and emotional single player focused experience. I'm looking forward to literally getting lost in a huge mysterious universe, with the hope that I might eventually put in enough time to maybe meet another person or get to the center of the universe or whatever. But think about it.... It's not really more than that at this point. There are a thousand other things you should be thinking about besides what No Mans Sky SHOULD be. Nobody knows what it should be.

gamernews,3ckat7,CheeterMcSkeeter,13,Wed Jul 8 18:08:25 2015 UTC,"Potentially. I think this title already had some pretty lofty ambitions with few specific deliverables. E:D has mutliple playstyles for players to choose from (Trader, Explorer, Pirate, Bounty Hunter) but the means all lead towards the same end: Buying a new ship just to farm for more money to upgrade it.  I guess the question is why would we want to craft /sell items? To buy better gear to help us farm more so that we can sell more?"
gamernews,3ckat7,wutitdopikachu,11,Wed Jul 8 18:26:15 2015 UTC,"incentives to explore the games world. They could leave it all out and just tell you to explore the world, but then there would be nothing to do. At least the game gives you some goals."
gamernews,3ckat7,Robot_xj9,6,Wed Jul 8 18:30:27 2015 UTC,"The problem with these type of games is they're so large on the macro scale that they often lack in the micro scale.   Sure, you can have thousands of planets to explore, but what good is that if they're all boring? Sure, you can have many different ways to play the game, but what good is that if they all lack depth?  These are the problems E:D has. NMS is giving me a very similar vibe with how they talk about these grandiose ideas in such vague words. They want to make trading fun. Ok. So then they feed you the line about hauling space material to a side of space where that material is rare and making bank. I'm sure to the average reader that sounds neat how the game world is organic and works logically. But what type of gameplay is trading actually comprised of? I can't think of many ways to make hauling an item from point A to B be all that interesting. It certainly isn't in E:D."
gamernews,3ckat7,Gougaloupe,8,Wed Jul 8 18:35:53 2015 UTC,"I'm always extremely suspicious when a title that is focusing on consoles starts to talk about hyper-ambitious goals. All that PC vs. Console bullshit aside, the bottom line is there is a limit to how much you can do with the hardware, couple that with deadlines, Executives, Stock holders, etc. and you have a receipe for ... well. Destiny, AC, watch_dogs... you know, 80% of triple A releases lately, haha.  Seriously though, No Man's Sky looks amazing, but the more I hear about it, the more I worry it will be a disappointment.

The game is procedural. It might be ambitious but really the game writes itself, there isn't as much involved as your mentioned titles. What they need to concentrate on is creating a world, once they have that down then they need to concentrate on stuff to do etc. But really with less scripting, there is less work."
gamernews,3ckat7,Sliminytim,2,Thu Jul 9 15:37:23 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to sound rude but you kinda sound like you don't have a real idea of how much work goes into making a video game, especially with a new engine."
gamernews,3ckat7,Robot_xj9,2,Thu Jul 9 06:54:55 2015 UTC,"When the art is procedural, there's a lot less work. The time goes into the algorithm to create the art. It's how games like Minecraft were able to be made by a single person."
gamernews,3ckat7,Sliminytim,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:54:29 2015 UTC,"The ""art"" is not procedural, textures have to be drawn, models made, and that ""algorithm"" you're talking about is not simple.  Procedurally generated terrain is simply and easy once it's been developed and tested, you can't ship a game with a faulty terrain generator, especially one like no man's sky, and there's a fuckton of testing to do to make sure it can't generate invalid terrain that the player could fall through or worse, could crash anyone's game who lands on the planet.   On top of that, you act as if everyone on the development team just works on all the parts of the game. The art department has nothing to do with the ambitious goals of the department working on the economy."
gamernews,3ckat7,Robot_xj9,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:21:30 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with any of that but you don't need anywhere near as many people or environment artists or character artists etc. If animals and such are being made by an algorithm then you don't need those artists. If there isn't a set scripture to go through you don't need to script the levels etc.  It's definitely a difficult job to write the software to do this, but you don't need the people or time of a big hand crafted scripted game like watch dogs."
gamernews,3ckat7,shawnaroo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:09:30 2015 UTC,"If animals and such are being made by an algorithm then you don't need those artists   Where do the pieces of models and textures that the algorithm combines to make unique entities come from? The computer doesn't generate random heads and arms and bodies and etc. It has a database of parts it can pull from and combines them randomly, just like borderlands handles guns. Those parts still need to be textured, and arguably making them textured and modeled in a way where they can fit on multiple bodies and various combinations is harder than traditional texture and model work."
gamernews,3ckat7,forgettableme,3,Fri Jul 10 15:24:58 2015 UTC,"The problem that I have with E:D is that it's generally boring. While some of the stars and planets and space stations and stuff look cool and all, you can't really explore any of them. You can't land on the planets, you can't discover anything other than a handful of stats for them. They're basically just waypoints for you to fly between, they don't offer much else in terms of gameplay. And everything is so far away and it's a chore to travel between planets.   NMS seems to be avoiding that issue by making things much closer together, and of course it's all about being able to fly down and explore and interact with the planets.   NMS seems way more geared towards immediate gratification. I think it'll be fun to a much broader player base than E:D manages to be."
gamernews,3ckat7,ModdingCrash,3,Fri Jul 10 15:47:37 2015 UTC,The point of the game is to get to the center of the Galaxy. Everyone is trying to get there. But the game is mainly about exploring. I'm sure with such an open world players will discover their own ways to play.   Just look at minecraft if you are wondering how much people will want to farm to build better gear. That's mostly what minecraft is. That and exploring.
gamernews,3ckat7,flashman,2,Thu Jul 9 01:05:31 2015 UTC,"Now? Tha game has always been though as an exploring game where the most important activities  you can do (those that reward you) are Trading,  Fighting, Gathering resources and Discovering new stuff."

That video really highlighted how much their graphics could improve with better shaders and perhaps on-planet FOV. Also directional lighting in some cases. These are super easy to add as well, and won't really take time away from gameplay dev.  That said I believe this was a PS4 demo. That's why AA was disabled. And since this game seems more and more like it's treating PS4 as first class, I doubt you will much better graphics on the PC. It will definitely included an AA setting, but I doubt you will see much beyond that, even the easy stuff that is trivial to add."

gamernews,3ckat7,Sabbathius,6,Wed Jul 8 23:28:17 2015 UTC,"In your opinion, what is Minecraft's ""catch""?"
gamernews,3ckat7,SpaceShipRat,8,Wed Jul 8 18:43:54 2015 UTC,"For me, Minecraft and similar games were about survival. Exploration was a means to an end - you explored to find resources, a good site to build shelter, find out where enemies are, craft better weapons and armor, which you need to procure food or survive in hostile environments, etc.   NMS seems to have some of that, you can upgrade your ship, armor and weapon. But without a specific enemy coming after you all the time, driving the arms race, or constant requirements like shelter and hunger pushing you forward, I don't know that NMS has enough ""meat"" to last very long."
gamernews,3ckat7,deuteros,5,Wed Jul 8 18:48:34 2015 UTC,"My issue with Minecraft was that while on the one hand you were encouraged to explore to get resources, you also wanted to always to have a home base. But to explore, you had to abandon that base. I always wanted to have something like Howle's Moving Castle.  I totally agree concerning NMS though. The procedural planets show off incredible technology. As far as I've seen, you do nothing more than look at it, and all of that procedural content amounts to nothing more than a hash value tied to your name in a database. Meanwhile, the actual gameplay hasn't seemed to have evolved much from other space games."
gamernews,3ckat7,Sabbathius,4,Wed Jul 8 18:57:59 2015 UTC,"Ah, see, that's part of the survival aspect. Some games, like ""Don't Starve"", take it a notch further than that. When it gets dark, a monster comes after you and kills you, if you are in the dark. So you must have some light source to survive. That means wood, for a campfire or a torch. Campfire lasts longer for the same amount of wood, but you can't move away from it without dying. Torch lets you move around, but burns out faster, wasting more resources.   So your day-to-day existence becomes really harsh. You must, during the day, not only stockpile enough resources to survive the immediate upcoming night, but also do things to make long-term survival easier and build an infrastructure of sorts, because winter is coming (giggity, GoT!) and you won't survive it without preparation.  Survival is an excellent driving force, based on needs, something we all readily understand. The need for food, shelter, warmth, etc. And once you exhaust those in your immediate vicinity, you're forced to become nomadic, or build things to sustain that stuff locally. And that's where exploration kicks in, because rocks might be far west of your location, grass far east, meat to the north, etc.   But NMS? What's the drive? Money? For what? They mentioned that upgrading the suit allows you to go to more  hostile planets. Lovely, but what if I don't feel like going to hostile planets? If there's 18 quintillion of them, I can easily avoid hostile ones. Do I need food? Not from what I've seen, they never mention in. I don't need shelter, because I can just hop into my ship and fly off. That was one of the issues with Starbound vs Terraria, you can always just transport back to your ship for the night and not worry about shelter, where in Terraria or Craft the World it wasn't an option. And so on."
gamernews,3ckat7,Lucosis,4,Wed Jul 8 19:06:47 2015 UTC,"Curiosity. Round the edge of the galaxy is mostly boring planets and colorful gazelles, but as you move towards the center you start finding the floating whales, giant dune worms, and biolminescent dinosaurs or what have you. (plus the rare minerals that let you make high level upgrades)  To get to the good shit, you need to upgrade your stardrive to go faster, and your other stuff so you don't get killed by the bigger and badder space pirates."
gamernews,3ckat7,KOWguy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:14:26 2015 UTC,I didn't find the survival aspect of Minecraft terribly interesting once I realized all I was doing was mining stuff so I could build stuff so I could mine stuff faster.
gamernews,3ckat7,SpaceShipRat,0,Wed Jul 8 20:57:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Minecraft is a bit overrated. But there's lots of ""exploration"" games where survival is a big element driving the whole thing.  One of my favourites is ""Craft the World"", basically a dwarf fortress, and every night there's an onslaught of monsters (besides regular-occurring ones), and every 50 minutes there's a huge monster invasion where portals open and enemies pour in. So you have to build defenses, as each invasion is stronger. And stronger defenses require materials that are found deeper in the planet's core, so you have to dig down. Going deep increases travel time to and from your base, where the stockpile/food/shelter is. And monsters get nastier the further you go, and at the very core of the world, at the lake of lava, there be dragons.  There's some truth to mining to build stuff so you can mine faster. In Craft the World you start with a basic axe and pick made of wood and stone. And you can make these of iron, steel and eventually mithril, which lets you dig faster, because the deeper you go, the harder the digging gets because everything is so densely compressed.  But the driving force is still principally survival. If your defenses and weapons aren't up to par, your dwarves die. But the ultimate driving force is to escape the world you're stuck on. Which requires finding (exploration!) at least 5 chambers on the map, gathering 4 portal pieces and the portal itself, and opening the gateway into the next world. Each of these rooms is guarded by a boss mob, which is a really tough thing to kill. And each new world is more inhospitable than the last. First planet is temperate and reasonable. Second is a frozen tundra. Third is a scorching desert. And so on. Each presents serious survival challenges and scarce resources.  So you are forced into exploration by the need to survive, short term. And long-term, to escape the planet. It's the similar mechanic to ""Don't Starve!"", where you survive long enough to assemble the device and escape into the next world.  In NMS though, I feel like these aspects are missing. Getting stronger and better equipment is always nice. But without needs like hunger, comfort, etc., or any concrete goal to drive you, I don't feel the game has the same impetus to do anything. Really worried that it'll end up being an extremely shallow and largely pointless grind-fast with a quantity over quality world."
gamernews,3ckat7,norfunk,0,Thu Jul 9 15:15:17 2015 UTC,"Yup. Basically it's minecraft, with more randomization and on a much larger scale and without building.  I really hope the dives into the game over the month will temper some expectations; because as it is now a LOT of people stand to be disappointed becuase the game isn't what they think it is."
gamernews,3ckat7,SurprizFortuneCookie,4,Thu Jul 9 15:26:01 2015 UTC,"Yup. Basically it's minecraft, without building.   That's minecraft...   ""This is just like call of duty, without the guns.

gamernews,3co93w,WildVariety,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:59:34 2015 UTC,"To be fair, we don't know the actual size of it."
gamernews,3co93w,Thesius4156,2,Thu Jul 9 20:12:02 2015 UTC,"True, but we can easily extrapolate how big it should be for 12 cans of soda:  Each can is (at most) 2 inches wide and 5 inches tall (at most) meaning : 15.707 cubic inches of soda/metal per can (V=πr2h)  So! 15.7 cubic inches multiplied by 12 cans is 188.48 cubic inches for all the soda the fridge can hold.  That could also be looked at as a block instead of a bunch of cylinders to think about it easier. A 12"" x 3"" x 6"" block would be bigger than the sum total of the cans, but I firmly believe that almost any fridge can fit that.   But what about mini fridges you say?   I have owned several in my life and oddly enough, I was putting soda in those fridges from square one. I could always fit 12 soda cans in those little S.O.B.s  I want to pre-order games again, but with gifts like soundtracks to shooting games, art that was all but unused by the game, and frankly unhealthy pushes to consume soda (Mountain Dew, I'm looking at you) I get turned off.   I used to have at minimum 2 games on pre-order all the time, but now the pre-order bonuses start a $100 and don't EVER pay off. I can get the same content in a GOTY edition in 9 months later.  And games have the best option for pre-order gifts! Geek culture goes nutty for real-looking props from their favorite universes. Master Chief's helmet is something that while not used, would look really cool! Geralt of Rivia's amulet or sword decorating a player's wall gives a sense of pride in owning the gift and, transitively, buying the pre-order."

I bought every prestige edition (except for Advanced Warfare and Ghosts) and all they've been are shitty (really shitty gimmicks)   I mean the RC car was a pretty cool toy at the time (and yes a toy) its just cheap and flimsy. Even the camera on the RC car was poor quality.  and the rc copter in black ops 2 was made of foam (Not plastic) FOAM. The wind caught mine and tore it right into shreds when it got caught on a tree.  I'm only buying this prestige edition only because I absolutely love zombies (always have and always will) except I'm a world at war guy. Black ops zombies was kind of boring.

I doubt every penny of the 4 million total from crowd funding went to game development. A lot probably goes to making the physical content available and ensuring they are able to ship it. I'm sure they know how to budget properly.  Also Project Red Ash is a separate thing (anime/game).  Doesn't matter if they are asking for more money so soon. They are free to make their own choices same as anyone. Besides Mighty No 9 will be out in 2 months.

gamernews,3ciatl,Booskaboo,2,Wed Jul 8 14:52:59 2015 UTC,When the computer's graphics card has more work to do than it can accomplish in the normal length of one frame (16.66 milliseconds at 60fps or 33.33 ms at 30fps) there are a few strategies:  Frame skip to catch up - don't render an image on the following frame but continue updating input and game logic. This gives the game some spare processing time to catch up to where it wants to be but it causes the game's motion to look less smooth.   Don't compensate: the game will start running in slow motion when there's too much stuff going on onscreen.

gamernews,3ciwkb,anr-k_Main,2,Wed Jul 8 07:01:25 2015 UTC,Can someone explain the benefit of streaming games to a pc? I'm not understanding how playing on a smaller screen in an office chair in the same household where your xbox is hooked up to a big screen tv in your living room is better. Am I missing something here?
gamernews,3ciwkb,dizturbd,2,Wed Jul 8 22:51:10 2015 UTC,"As they said ""perfect if you don’t own a 1080p tv, but do have a full HD monitor."" I could also offer the possibility that many people who want to use their xbone may not have control of the television and this would offer an alternative to plugging it in elsewhere.    This also would allow the usage of nice pc headphones for playing when it's late or no one wants to hear the game.  None of these relate to me in any way but I'm sure there is a demographic that this hits."
gamernews,3ciwkb,dietmoxie,-1,Wed Jul 8 23:24:09 2015 UTC,"Ok, but none of the xbox one games released so far have hit 1080p resolution. Also, using the streaming doesn't allow anyone to use the tv for other uses unless they are using a different input. I do understand the reason for using nice headphones, but most gamers already have headphones capable of curbing noise for the rest of the household. The only reason I can see this being a big deal is if you could play your game library on the go away from home, but you can't. WTF?"
gamernews,3ciwkb,dizturbd,2,Thu Jul 9 05:42:28 2015 UTC,"I imagine it will work well for those that don't have more than one TV in the home, it basically will act as another screen without the game of moving the console around.   I use Nvidia game streaming from my PC to my tablet plugged in to TV in living room for some games.  It's not good for fast twitch first person on driving games though, it adds another set of latency to worry about. An extra 50ms can mean difference between smooth gaming and lag fest."

I don't know about PC but Xbox doesn't sell as well in Japan as the PS4 and Vita. I'm guessing what kept it from Wii U is hardware, or the last Dragon Quest game for Wii U didn't go over well. Either way, it was probably too late to get it into multiplatform by the time it was decided to be localized. Japanese gaming companies don't tend to think globally, catering to their own markets.  OR they looked and found it didn't pay to put it on Xbox. Their games have always released on a Sony or Nintendo console, so they may not have found a large fanbase there.

gamernews,3ceyuo,shumonkey,30,Tue Jul 7 14:07:40 2015 UTC,There's a difference between fixing something that is broken and improving something that works reasonably well but could be better. It's not that hard to understand.
gamernews,3ceyuo,Cadwae,19,Tue Jul 7 14:25:17 2015 UTC,"Quality of life feedback improvements aren't 'fixing' anything. Fixing implies it is 'broken' which it isn't. The inventory works fine. Listening to customers and making adjustments is not the same as fixing bugs where something doesn't work.  A non game example is a broom. Pretty simple, a long handle with bristles at the end to push stuff. But lets say customers are saying the handle is uncomfortable or slips somewhat, then you add a rubber no slip grip, also that they would like a version of it that is wider. These aren't 'fixing' the broom, the broom worked, these are improvements based on customer feedback.  The sad state is that since so many games are shipped at very buggy or broken states that people confuse the two, seeing a company listening to it's customers and making adjustments as them 'fixing' stuff. It worked from the start, they (CDProjekt Red) just like to help the customers and improve their experience.  EDIT:Spelling and grammar."

It's because they do the work. They are apparently also humble about it. I know this  because it was hard finding their company name on their Witcher 3 site.

Discussions about games used to be about the way the industry is moving ahead, and now its all about WHAT X COMPANY OWES ME.   CDProject is one of the most open game companies there are and possibly THE BEST at supporting their games after release. In two years The Witcher 3 will end up getting a complete overhaul with new content (Enhanced!) for fucking free, meanwhile any other company would call this a Remastered Edition and charge you another 60 dollars, which is cool. If you want to buy it do it, I am not going to tell you where to spend your money, and neither should someone else.  Witcher 3 has been out for a month and a half. In that month and a half, after reading the patch history, they have released 7 patches - more than one patch a week.  Again, fuck that guy.

But am I the only one who thinks we'll run in to players more often than they think? I mean I expect the game to sell 2, 3 million at the start. I understand just how big it is, but you add up continued sales and it's almost like you HAVE to run in to someone. Maybe just wishful thinking.

Both of these are popular, praised games online including YouTube and here on Reddit. MC is so popular that it has endless clones. And E:D was praised for being a truck-driving sim in space with literally nothing to do on a run but watch stars streak by. Why is NMS considered boring when you can perform the same actions in MC and E:D and get no complaints?"

gamernews,3cbwqu,macross42,2,Wed Jul 8 14:10:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Elite is ""endless truck-driving in space"" and that's it. That explains why the series is so unpopular and has three sequels. I wish you would have said this sooner so we could ignore the rest of the game's content, depth, and attention to detail, then boil the game down to the simple act of... ""truck-driving."" Those idiots who enjoy the game sure are simple-minded fools, huh???  And I agree, Reddit is 100% responsible for making Minecraft and Elite popular, even though Elite came out close to two decades before Reddit was even started and Minecraft has huge communities elsewhere.  Can you even believe that people like games you don't like? Do you have a list of you-approved games so I can know what to enjoy? Thanks!"

gamernews,3cbwqu,Flight714,2,Mon Jul 6 21:34:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this video bugged me so much. More than it should have.  The presenter goes ""There's 18 quintillion planets!"", but I'm going to show you just the same one I've been showing for a while now.  He then goes ""You can run for a week across this planet"", and never leaves a 100m perimeter of his ship's landing site.  The then shows how he can blast a hole in a rock on the surface, and says you can explore caves and even dig them yourself. And yet again doesn't show any caves, or aim the gun he is holding in his hand down and fire it once or twice to show how it's done.  Looks at a spaceport, and says you can trade. Doesn't move towards it, or open a trade window.   Says look at all those points of interest, some of these can be ruins, with treasure. Soooo, SHOW US ONE!   Less than halfway through the video I was hoping one of the IGN guys would just say screw this, and take away the controls from the presenter and actually do some of the stuff, instead of just talking and talking and talking and talking and talking and talking and talking and talking and talking and talking and talking about it.  I guess I sort of get that the developer wants to keep some of the mystery. But you're also talking to consumers, and you're trying to sell a product. In an industry riddled with lies and deception. You have to show that the stuff you're talking about exists in the game and can be done. Otherwise you're just doing a Molyneux parody."

gamernews,3c7vql,RangeroftheNight,40,Sun Jul 5 18:51:02 2015 UTC,Since there's a character selection this is less likely a Superman game and more likely a Justice League game. Which is amazing. Kevin Conroy recently stated he's working on another project for WB that he can't talk about...
gamernews,3c7vql,Jaywearspants,5,Sun Jul 5 19:28:20 2015 UTC,I always assumed this would be the next project after Arkham Knight. This would likely come out when the DC movies are heating up and could create some great synergy.  Using the Arkham games as a stepping stone for a Justice League game would be fantastic.
gamernews,3c7vql,WesWarlord,6,Sun Jul 5 22:39:50 2015 UTC,"That's what we're thinking as well, although it looks more like just a skin selection screen than an actual character selection. Mostly speculative with the job listings that recently came out from Warner Bros."
gamernews,3c7vql,Spadie,99,Sun Jul 5 19:29:51 2015 UTC,"Some heroes don't lend themselves well to video games. Superman being one of them, invulnerability is difficult to include in gameplay and have it still be fun or challenging. Of course you can do what they did in the last Superman game, make the city his 'health bar' but.. well, that was kind of lame.  Others that would be difficult are like, The Flash because unless the player has crazy reaction times, or they do the whole game in slow mo, it'd be kind of weird. Or Green Lantern, only way that'd be fine is just as a beat-em-up. But that doesn't really embody the whole ""He can create anything with the ring!"" thing."
gamernews,3c7vql,traceitalian,34,Sun Jul 5 19:07:21 2015 UTC,"It could be like new 52 early days and have a weakened, underpowered Supes discovering his abilities over time."
gamernews,3c7vql,FallenWyvern,16,Sun Jul 5 19:20:47 2015 UTC,"Invulnerability is a power that works. Instead of the hero having an hp bar, it belongs to the thing they protect.   The city has an hp bar, and as you save it the bar goes up. As bad guys complete their tasks, it goes down.   Do you stop the bank robbery? Gorilla Grodd stealing tech from let Corp? How do you deal with the consequences of a villain who succeeded because you didn't focus on them.   It's pressure, because you can be invulnerable as he'll but stress can kill ya."
gamernews,3c7vql,pie-oh,8,Sun Jul 5 21:28:04 2015 UTC,"Things like city health bars sound like it works on a longer scale.  Look at Batman's Arkham series. The fighting is fantastic, but you can get your ass handed to you and die. But if your character can't die, that's dull – and a city generally isn't brought down in 5 minutes. And if that's the outcome instead of dying, that's going to lose it's meaning."
gamernews,3c7vql,FallenWyvern,7,Mon Jul 6 01:57:40 2015 UTC,"No, but you wouldn't make a Superman version of Arkham. That'd be re-skinning Batman. At least, ideally you wouldn't be doing that.   Also there are two major weaknesses for Supes: Magic and Kryptonite. While Kryptonight is rare, in DC Magic is not. So don't think he can't die.   The Arkham devs said that they based the combat in Asylum off of Guitar Hero in that the 'beat' or pace of combat is setup by the improvisational choreography around you. In guitar hero and Arkham, your combo builds and builds and losing it feels bad. It's not that they have to make you be able to lose, they have to make losing the tempo feel bad."
gamernews,3c7vql,pie-oh,3,Mon Jul 6 02:19:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, agreed that a reskin would be bad. Saying that, I'd love to see a Superman vs Batman (like the comics) game where you could tag in, and the colours of the world changed. But maybe only as a tech demo. And that makes total sense re: Guitar Hero.   With the baddies in a Superman game, I feel it'd be a harder game to make the base generic baddies have magic and have a wide variety. (Think Batman and the Thugs, Thugs with melee weapons, Thugs with tasers, Thugs with guns, scanners, medpacks, etc.)  To be honest, someone could potentially pull it off. It just seems a lot harder."
gamernews,3c7vql,FallenWyvern,0,Mon Jul 6 02:25:19 2015 UTC,"To be honest, someone could potentially pull it off. It just seems a lot harder.   The real question is, would WB be making another superhero game because they know it'll make money or do they want to make a good game that will make money and please fans?  All this 'how does it work' is game design and theory. If WB pays the right person with the right ideas? Pulling it off becomes a cinch. I just hope if that's what they're doing, they're willing to spend a little more and find that (those) person (people)."
gamernews,3c7vql,ANewMachine615,2,Mon Jul 6 02:31:27 2015 UTC,"See, this sounds ok, until you realize it makes the entire game into an escort quest. Nobody wants that."
gamernews,3c7vql,FallenWyvern,2,Mon Jul 6 09:42:11 2015 UTC,"No, and it shouldn't be. For supes I'd probably focus less on combat more on decisions and timing. Failure should exhibit itself. In the arkham games failure means restarting but supes should have to live with failure.   Also, open world is probably a bad fit for the big S. While batman has a city to get around, supes can fly anywhere in the world instantly. But people want open world so it's a tougher game.   What might be interesting is having to play as young and old superman. A villain like vandal savage who is immortal would give us time to play as either. Being a more vulnerable Clark would be interesting. Slowly gaining control over powers as opposed to unlocking them. As time moves forward, accuracy and efficacy increase."

gamernews,3c7vql,CaptainJacket,5,Sun Jul 5 21:38:53 2015 UTC,I blame Man of Steel
gamernews,3c7vql,FallenWyvern,2,Sun Jul 5 23:05:43 2015 UTC,"There's other things to blame. Most New-52 stuff is darker and edgier and there are more casualties all around. Newer fans just learning about comic books would get the impression from recent things that Supes is maybe even a bit emo (but not like Superboy Prime, obviously).  Personally, what I want is a Justice League game but I don't think that scale of power works well, so a Teen Titans game would work better (the proper comic titans, not the excellent cartoon or the shitty TT:Go) but before we get those sorts of games Supes needs his due. He hasn't HAD a good video game yet and he's famous for having one of the worst video games of all time."

I don't think your comment on that is fair. That's actually the one creative element which that piece of shit actually had.  2) Superman can and should be given a chance as a game. We've had nothing decent for Superman video games, pretty much ever. We all know Superman64 was an abortion and so was returns...and the 16bit versions aren't really worth discussing in this modern era of open world. It's impossible to write off the character without actually having a game that gave it a proper shot. It's just too presumptuous."

If they made one superman game like this all the rest would follow the same route, and it was be just dumb as dog shit. Metroid has been subsisting on this formula for literal decades and is everything wrong with gaming. The Metroid series hasn't added any new weapons since Super Metroid 20 years ago, just think about how fucking stupid that is. Fuck that shit, let me get the powers but keep it going for the sequels. Super Missiles aren't shit I will ever be excited about Nintendo fuck off."
gamernews,3c7vql,Mayor_Of_Boston,2,Mon Jul 6 13:55:14 2015 UTC,... its the whole adventure genre in a nutshell.
gamernews,3c7vql,megatom0,-3,Mon Jul 6 17:54:52 2015 UTC,"For adventure games with little creativity IMO. Games like A Link Between Worlds and the Batman Arkham games have shown how this doesn't have to be the case. In ALBW you can get every item from the get go essentially and then do the adventure in whatever order you want. With the Arkham games there is some overlap but in Arkham City you start with a good deal of the gadgets you had from the end of Asylum and the ones you don't start with you get very quickly, and even get new items fairly early on. Arkham Knight took this even further and even let you pick up certain gadgets at any point in the game. Sure it has overlap with some of the upgrades but that is just part of the leveling progression with those games. Each one adds enough new stuff to warrant this. With Metroid and Castlevania the progression is so very similar it is maddening. You first get Missiles, then ball, then ball bombs, then double jump, then super missiles, then ice beams, the later metroids even insult us further by having the new items be pretty much for specific locations only like a suit you need for one particular place. For some reason this doesn't bother me as much in the Zelda games because it doesn't treat you like an asshole and have you start the game with everything then magically lose it all. Also they usually add in new mechanics fairly early on even with older weapons (ala Gale Boomerang in Twilight Princess).   What to me is also so vexing about this process is that it is really only done to pad out the game with back tracking. ""Hey why is there one room requiring an ice beam in the first section of Metroid Prime"" Just so you have to back track to get whatever it is. Playing A Link Between Worlds really shows how bullshit back tracking is. In that game you are just constantly getting access to stuff. I know some people on here might say ""well there is a cool mystery to not knowing what is there until later in the game"", but the fact is that it isn't really a mystery it is just a missile/health expansion. People know what to expect from these games by now. I really hope the next Zelda starts you off with a Sword Shield Bow and bombs, because the bow and bombs shouldn't be items solely to build puzzles around."

gamernews,3c7vql,Masterchiefg7,2,Sun Jul 5 22:41:14 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine with a flash game you would slow down the world not speed up the character, or they could implement something like saints row 4 did."
gamernews,3c7vql,pwncloud,2,Sun Jul 5 21:27:15 2015 UTC,"Superman being one of them, invulnerability is difficult to include in gameplay and have it still be fun or challenging.   Maybe they should just do Superman's Epic Yarn."
gamernews,3c7vql,Spadie,2,Mon Jul 6 04:18:51 2015 UTC,"Others that would be difficult are like, The Flash because unless the player has crazy reaction times, or they do the whole game in slow mo, it'd be kind of weird.    I don't think that would be weird to pull off. The Flash draws on the 'Speed Force' to get his super speed. He can't draw too much at once, especially when someone else is also using it at the same time.  So for a game, it's established Flash can only use a bit of the speed force at a time for whatever reason. When he uses the speed force he enters a slow-mo state.   A Flash-based free roam would work especially well if he went back in time or into an alternate timeline (as has happened if he runs fast enough and changes something in the past) and was stuck there, having to build himself up and make allies with Justice League members in the new timeline.   Pretty much just make a game out of The Flashpoint Paradox, is what I'm saying. You'd even be unable to use any powers at all for awhile after the intro. You'd start with having unlimited access to your powers; running up buildings and using momentum to leap huge distances, slowing down time, running over water, phasing through buildings, charging up your punches. Then you just lose it all, and have limited use of it sometime after; possibly slowly gaining more and more as you get more control over the speed force from the one occupying it."
gamernews,3c7vql,nullmiah,2,Mon Jul 6 08:39:29 2015 UTC,I think Flash only taps into the speed force when he wants. So you could have Arkham style combat with slomo finishers and dodge reactions and other such things.
gamernews,3c7vql,Spadie,2,Mon Jul 6 17:03:23 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to be a health based game at all.  There could be timed objectives for example, or just objectives in general rather than caring about your character's health.  Or think about how a Mario level can still be difficult even if you had invulnerability.  You can fuck up a jump and die, and sure, maybe Superman can't die, but perhaps instead it tells you that the objective failed and you need to start over.  Maybe with it being an open world game, your choices have an effect on how the world views Superman.  Maybe you let a lot of civilians die, or chose to help the government, and those choices affect that.  Making it more reputation based maybe.  Maybe you could piss of Batman.  My point is that a game doesn't have to be health based to be challenging or engaging.  With all this said, I think it would be interesting if you had to pay attention to the time of day or weather conditions for your powers.  Superman relies on the power of the sun in many universes.  If it's open world, maybe it could be a nice dynamic."
gamernews,3c7vql,badphish94,2,Tue Jul 7 03:02:39 2015 UTC,"These are possibilities and people do keep suggesting them, but some people are forgetting a few things  1) ""The citizens and the city should be Superman's health!"" That was the case with the god-awful game Superman Returns. It just didn't feel right, that you can go around busting shit up and you're fine but the city is slowly losing health. It feels like a crappy time trial.  2) ""You could have the game where he's just racing to save certain people, if he doesn't get there in time, you lose!"" ...Like Superman 64? A lot of people really don't like time trials, and it's not a good idea to base an entire game around them unless it's some sort of racing game.  However, you bring up an interesting point there. ""if you had to pay attention to the time of day or weather conditions for your powers. Superman relies on the power of the sun in many universes.""  Maybe a villain finds a way to block out the sun, and keeps Superman too busy on the ground so he loses his power over time, gets weaker and vulnerable. THAT could work. Call it Superman: Dark Days or something super grimdark edgy like that.  ""But what if Superman just flies above the clouds!""  I think if he's weak enough, by the time he gets anywhere near the clouds he'll start to suffocate.  This could work."

Not a pure beat 'em up, but an open world game where you have to keep forcing the fight away from the most populous areas. All the while his health bar is unmoving. When exposed to Kryptonite he can take damage. And in the last level when fighting Darkseid he takes full damage from every hit. The final challenge is protecting Metropolis without dying.

They could have Superman bashing his way through Lex Luthor tower and toppling his empire.  Some kind of Cryptonite poisoning you have to overcome in a certain time limit.

Not to mention that like almost every main Superman villain has some kind of kryptonite ray or something, so you could have boss battles that drain you of health.  Really a good Superman game is very possible.

gamernews,3c4aaw,LordHomogay,2,Thu Jul 9 22:31:06 2015 UTC,"Why would I be upset? I only use OS X for building the iOS port of my app and I'm not especially fond of it, but I use Windows every day, and I don't mind it. I do prefer Linux personally, and it actually works out-of-the-box, unlike Windows, which you claim it does.   But who cares? Use what works for you, I'm not shoving Linux down your throat.

gamernews,3c4aaw,Mingeblaster,18,Sat Jul 4 19:43:47 2015 UTC,My guess would be a move to DirectX and either C++ or .NET (as opposed to OpenGL/Java).

I think it's honestly most likely a legal thing so people can't sue for false advertising when it doesn't work on their flavour of Linux.  They bring up plenty of other competitors, but Linux is a bit special in that not only is it probably the least tested but due to legal and ethical concerns, most Linux distributions do not use Oracle Java but rather a version with source code that oracle releases alongside that is almost (but not 100%) compatible with the version on OSX and Windows, and which even Mojang didn't support officially. Similarly, it's not mentioned at all but Minecraft runs fine on FreeBSD, and I don't see people complaining about that ;)"

I'm still not into this Version, but just because i'm not interested in Minecraft without Mods, frankly, it's Boring. And i like My MC server running on the Linux Machine i have, and without Xbox Live accounts.

gamernews,3c4aaw,Zequez,5,Sun Jul 5 06:36:27 2015 UTC,"Windows store apps need to run on the WinRT runtime, Java is not supported. Java is a Win32 application and therefore doesn't have a place on the store. I don't imagine it would take long for someone to reverse engineer Minecraft and make it run on WinRT, especially if Microsoft got a team in to pick it apart and rewrite it. It would also explain why this version won't be feature complete at launch as they haven't implemented all of the features yet."

It's based on PE, it's C++, and we mean to keep it on par forever. It is NOT another version of Minecraft! Also, we're aiming for feature parity! We won't have mods for now, but the important thing is that you know it :) Also, both PE and Win10 support all controllers :)  Xbox Live is not required. It's compatible, but the 7 people limit is only there because it's PE! It's just that there isn't a dedicated server right now."

This is a serious question. I would love to be more informed on this topic because this seems like exactly what MS should be doing with a game that was 'horribly' coded from what I have heard.

I guess some Modders would be happy and some pissed off. i'm sure they could improve the performance (not because of Java but because it's a total rewrite) and maybe even deliver a Modding API and improve things there.

There is still the possibility of direct-ip and mods still working as long as Microsoft strives to code every feature of the original.  If this is indeed just essentially the Xbox One version on PC without splitscreen then it will be a true disappointment and will destroy the community.  I think Microsoft has to see the draw the mods and dedicated servers give and that's why it's a beta and the p2p is just for simplicity for users that just want to play the vanilla game with friends.  Ideally online splitscreen on PC with mods and Xbox controllers would be perfect.
gamernews,3c4aaw,Ev3nt,8,Sat Jul 4 19:01:26 2015 UTC,"One of the reasons that there are so many mods (many of which are drastic modifications to the game) is that Java is really easy to reverse engineer and run modified copies. If it's on the Windows Store, unless they add official modding support it will be difficult at best (sideloading needed, plus the package will probably be DRM protected). At worst, if the game is written in C++ rather than dotnet then it may be not worth the effort. Besides, even if Microsoft deprecated the current desktop version I'm sure the modding community would backport any new content or features."
gamernews,3c4aaw,ceph3us,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:34:06 2015 UTC,"I would think Microsoft would be foolish to write the game in anything other than C++  Their own WinRT documentation for DirectX on WinRT is in C++ so I can't see them creating a game with anything else. Games should be native applications anyway, they require a lot of performance and overhead like that of a runtime really eats away at what you can accomplish. If Microsoft are able to accelerate the modding API and host a modding store in this version I don't think it would be much of a problem. However none of the mods for the current Minecraft would work for it.  I see this version just being vanilla minecraft though, if you want mods you'll have to go back to the Win32 application."
gamernews,3c4aaw,Sliminytim,5,Sun Jul 5 09:25:53 2015 UTC,Yea! Just like that fucking Pocket Edition stealing all the resources from those Minecraft updates that have so much content!
gamernews,3c4aaw,Lucosis,-2,Sat Jul 4 18:16:27 2015 UTC,"Pocket Edition was a separate platform, and did not compete for the same audience. And even then it certainly did take resources that could have gone towards refactoring their original Java engine or completing the ever-promised modding API. This new version might do everything we wanted in a Minecraft 2.0, but we have to deal with Microsoft's hard-on for cross-platforming and all the limitations that come with it."

This sounds like the complete technical overhaul people have demanded for a long time now. The original (Java) version is fun and all but never performed well. On the other hand: Remember when Notch didn't want to put the game on Steam? And now this is going to be a Windows 10 Store exclusive, presumably. Great. They are probably going to work on the original version even less now (and probably haven't for the last year or so because of this) and are looking to make users of that migrate to their reimplementation that's bound to one version of one PC OS only...   Minecraft is available on Windows, Mac, Windows Phone, iOS, Android, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, PS4 and PS Vita, and now, Windows 10.   There's a platform missing: Linux. I thought Microsoft got over their whole war on Open Source attitude. So not only are they, if my predictions are right, planning to fuck over Mac and Linux users, they don't even acknowledge the existence of the Linux version. What does this mean for dedicated servers then, if those will even be a thing going forward?

There are two control panels now, one called 'settings' the other called 'control panel'. Ironically the control panel subtitle says 'adjust your computer settings'... If you remove the tiles from the start menu you just have an empty black box. All the icons have been reduced from beautiful 3d gradients to 2 or 3 flat colours. They rearranged the layout of the windows explorer to be worse. When you change the resolution there are windows focus issues that prevents you from even applying settings. The update system is atrocious. Your computer can just randomly reboot without warning to install updates, and then spend 15 minutes rebooting 5 times with percentages that bounce around and give no information. Don't get me started with all the problems with local user accounts and using windows 10 on the domain.  These are all the problems I found within about 30 minutes of using a preview version.   There are a few tiny things I think are improvements from 8.1, but ultimately for stability and usability Windows 7 is still superior."

""Oh they're just big hearted and pure and get caught up in their imaginations. They don't think like the other big evil businesses."" I thought. Which helped at least forgive a little but still not particularly excuse. After reading this, I'm not getting the humble vibe anymore. At this point they are just kind of sounding like vague political douchebags who seem to be irritated with the criticisms and unwilling to actually apply them. This perspective actually aligns well with what their actions have been in the last few years. Maybe they are jerks. Maybe they don't care."
gamernews,3bzhux,JustAsLost,76,Fri Jul 3 14:24:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe they are jerks. Maybe they don't care.   Nintendo isn't evil, its insular. While Sony (the other major Japanese games platform) has adapted to a fairly western business style, Nintendo continues to be a very Japanese business. Culturally, this means they tend to take little to no notice or care about outside feedback, it is exceptionally difficult to displace anyone in a position of authority, and not cowtowing to the company line puts one's job at risk.  On one hand, this has been very good for them from a creativity standpoint, allowing them to put out fresh and interesting content for far longer and more successfully than other companies. However, it also means they're absurdly inflexible, and unable to quickly adapt to changing times and consumer habits (consider how long it took them to even acknowledge mobile gaming as a threat to their handheld business for an example).  So, the short version is that they aren't jerks, they're just doing business as usual. And for them, business as usual means that, yes, they don't care. And as long as not caring continues to work for them, they'll continue their long and storied tradition of not caring."
gamernews,3bzhux,binarian,37,Fri Jul 3 16:21:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I agree with your point on creativity. I would say Nintendo's development strategy is more comfortable than creative. The heavy hitters on Wii U right now are a new Mario Kart, a new Smash Bros, a new 3D Mario platformer, a new 2D Mario platformer (I would assume, maybe it didn't sell well), and I'm sure the distant new Zelda will be huge too. Those are at best improvements on a formula.  Splatoon is a legitimate step forward creatively, I'll say that, but for the most part I would argue Nintendo's ""innovation"" comes from 2nd or 3rd party support (which is quite scant).  Not that there's anything wrong with being comfortable, though!! When you go to a restaurant and order the calamari, it doesn't really matter if you've had it 50 times before as long as it's delicious."
gamernews,3bzhux,DrBrogbo,14,Fri Jul 3 16:45:48 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but i'd argue that their ratio of safe:creative decisions has become more heavily balanced towards safe in the past few years, which would make it part of their ongoing effort to generate revenue to offset the costs of the Wii U. Until the end of the Wii's lifespan they did a good job of applying creativity to their safe brands while also releasing occasional niche games to further display their creativity and risk-taking."
gamernews,3bzhux,OmegasSquared,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:14:55 2015 UTC,"It's not just to off set the costs of things like the Wii U. But also development for other experimental games. Historically, all the 3D platforming games of Mario sold much lower then all the 2D platforming ones, so they off set those costs by releasing a safer 2D Mario every other chance they get to do a more experimental 3D Mario."
gamernews,3bzhux,SoberPandaren,0,Fri Jul 3 22:12:25 2015 UTC,"It's definitely possible. Could you give some examples, though?

gamernews,3bzhux,DrBrogbo,9,Fri Jul 3 23:47:43 2015 UTC,"As a life long fan of Nintendo, I have to say this guys response is mostly what is going on.  They are not jerks or evil so much as unyielding and uncompromising.  They have a plan and they don't want to deviate from it.  This has been their greatest strength but also their biggest enemy.  It led to amazing games like Ocarina of Time or Mario Galaxy (which any other company would have cancelled at the first sign of problems).  But it has also led to them losing third party support, the Virtual Boy, the PlayStation and the Wii U.  So sometimes, under the right conditions, Nintendo ignoring the fans and doing what it thinks is right actually leads to positive growth and revolutionary new things (like we saw with the DS and Wii).  But sometimes its also a bad thing, as they will fixate on what they think the market should do, but not what the market wants.  Still, I can't exactly fault them.  Konami, Sega, SquareEnix and tons of other Japanese companies follow the same 'we know what's best' attitude.  And many of those companies are either really struggling or outright failed, while Nintendo is still very much alive with 4+ billion dollars saved up.  Nintendo may not make a Metroid game every generation and may not lead in hardware.  But they're still not doing as large of blunders as firing all their key staf (Konami) or totally ignoring 90% of their IPs (SquareEnix).  And Nintendo isn't in any danger of dying.  They are the one company which could survive entirely on first party games.  But if they want to go beyond just keeping steady, they will need to make drastic changes.  And I don't think a few weak smartphone deals and Amiibo is what anyone really wants.  Its a quick band-aid on their larger problems of no third party support and being the 'other guy' in the market."
gamernews,3bzhux,maxis2k,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:02:13 2015 UTC,"The issue is that previously they've thought outside of the box and delivered some quality games. This generation, because consoles weren't that much more powerful than the last, many developers and publishers are starting to focus on the ""think outside the box"" route, and are now offering wild new IPs that are cutting into Nintendo's own ""think outside the box"" routine. Further, because Nintendo is so friggin' slow in moving and responding to fan demand or market trends, though they may not be deviating from their 10 year strategy; the market nonetheless is eating into their prospective revenue and subsequent profits.  They have money in the savings, but that money isn't infinite, and at some point in time, it's going to start affecting them significantly. But, if they aren't ready to face the music by then; they're pretty much screwed. The real question is, do they even realize the writing on the wall--and if they do, what do they intend to do about it?"
gamernews,3bzhux,Centauran_Omega,2,Mon Jul 6 21:20:31 2015 UTC,"Great response! To make sure you know, I was mostly just venting but I do want to say that this method really isn't working. I do respect it to a degree, I actually work in very similar ways, but you can't keep working like that when the people are banging on your door. Behind the scenes they seem to be scratching their heads when we are seemingly very clear on our demands. Just looking at the numbers as well you still see obvious solutions. I think them going from pretending to care to dropping the act and being like: ""Look we actually don't care. We do our thing."" Reflects possible inner turmoil. Honestly I love it. I think we all do. It's a circus. Super entertaining, unpredictable, that's why I bought a Wii U finally (my first Nintendo system). ITS DIFFERENT. I'm just afraid if they don't open up they won't survive long enough to stay present or maintain the super solid quality of what games they do put out. That's probably what we all, including them, genuinely fear."

People didn't care about Kirby's epic yarn, but the insular group-think mentality said let's copy paste an art style no one really cared about see if this works this time.  This problem has been around since the N64 era. Something isn't working, yet they double down on what did work (the usual suspect IPs) or what they feel should have worked despite empiracle evidence, creating a feedback loop where the people who do care about the IPs are satisfied, but the attrition rate keeps increasing during each cycle.  Nintendo's unwillingness to to change with the times is why they aren't doing well. They just are now acknowledging mobile phone gaming. Six years after mobile took off. Sure consumers have changed and the times have changed but it's up to businesses to decide whether they want to keep up with the times and market demand or fold.

Though this strategy may have worked well before - Nintendo's E3 was unfortunately timed with a fantastic E3 from competitors which was basically a 'here's some excellent reasons to buy a ps4/xbox/pc' while everyone else was going 'alright, lets get one of those and a wii u as well because its cheaper- oh wait. there are no games for it coming out that I want to play.'  It sucks. Wii U has fallen majorly behind, not just because it is a tremendously underpowered console that will look increasingly backwards every year, but the lack of quality titles and an incredibly poor marketing strategy means that really nobody wants to buy one.  They're really gonna have to do something interesting with the NX if it is going to sell - they're aiming to ship 20 million units in the first year of sale - that's more than all Wii U's ever sold.."

I feel like they're in an okay position and people are just getting worked up about it because they were just so thirsty from the past poor E3's from Microsoft or Sony, that when Nintendo just does a pretty okay one, they're all saying that Nintendo is going doombad."

Great musicians and artists aren't great because they master one piece or picture. It's their library that give weight to the artist, and when most of the portfolio is of the same painting year after year with slightly higher resolution or better green paint this time, my respect for their 'innovation' drops off exponentially. I just feel they have branded themselves into a corner and can't get out of the super P.C. happy fun time cuddles for everyone style of game design.

What is the downside here for anyone? Nintendo get's a huge new market(All Sony and Microsoft gamers), while dropping costs from manufacturing and designing their own consoles. All of their focus get's switched to Software and thus developing better games. Perhaps even they keep the mobile hardware angle open, DS type systems while completely forgoing home console.

But after they failed to gain marked with the Dreamcast they have been making games on other platforms. Sonic have appered on several Nintendo consoles. So that Nintendo might take the same route is possible if the WiiU and the next console flops. Nintendo is very strong in the handheld marked, and might just make handhelds and games for those. The problem is that cellphone/mobiles are eating into that marked. So Nintendo have gone from having complete control over handheld and marked leading on consoles to having serious competition on handhelds and losing the console marked."

And adults play all sorts of games including Zelda and Mario - today's adults were in the original generation of those IPs with the nostalgia firmly intact.  If Nintendo really wanted to be innovative they'd create a system with all cross-platform multiplayer. PC vs PS4 vs XBone players - wow - that would be fun as hell.  It makes huge sense for Nintendo to get out of hardware and into multiplatform games. No more sunken cost of poorly selling hardware and the associated software sale limitations. They could still put out universally compatible peripherals like the Wiimote etc.  Imagine a proper Metroid game made using the power of the current gen consoles or PC - would be awesome and would sell a lot.

gamernews,3bzhux,Clbull,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:51:21 2015 UTC,"In five years, I can see Nintendo diversifying into multiplatform development much like Sega, so we could end up seeing Nintendo become a massive quality-focused third-party publisher instead of a console manufacturer, although I do think they'll have a hardware division dedicated to wearable tech, smartphones and tablets aimed at competing with Google, Samsung, LG, HTC, Apple, etc. I mean Nintendo have already announced a 'quality of life' device focused on calculating fatigue by monitoring sleep, scheduled for release in 2016.  However, I think that decision will come as a result of a shareholders' revolt which will result in a near-unanimous vote of no-confidence in Satoru Iwata rather than a financial decision in the case of Sega after they haemorrhaged money with repeated hardware flops in the late 90s.  This shift is already happening at Nintendo. There are already shareholders who appear to have a huge stiffy over the lucrative mobile gaming market and have pushed for the company to start development for that platform, which Nintendo is actually doing.  At this point, it'll all depend on the critical and commercial success of the upcoming NX console, which has already been criticized by fans and developers alike for being announced far too early and at such a crucial time in the lifespans of the Wii U, PS4 and Xbox One.  If the NX flops, even while still maintaining profitability, then it could lead to Satoru Iwata's resignation and a new interim CEO taking his place to push Nintendo heavily into multiplatform game development (so we could end up seeing Nintendo franchise titles on Sony and Microsoft consoles, as well as potentially on Windows and SteamOS, which for Nintendo would be huge.)  The scary thing is that the NX could easily flop, given the direction Nintendo have gone down with the last two consoles. That is unless Nintendo woo third-party developers and consumers either with A) A gimmick that can truly revolutionise gaming, which will never happen since multiple screens, touchscreens and motion controls have been done to death and only work with certain genres, or B) A powerful console that can blow the Xbox One and PS4 out of the water."
gamernews,3bzhux,Sw0rDz,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:23:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think the NX is going to be the latest/greatest in hardware. I think it is a move to make a single console/device to solve both portable and console play. I think it can be done right, but I doubt Nintendo will fork the cash needed.  I'm scared of the idea of Nintendo making PC games. At the end of the day, Microsoft wins. What is stopping Microsoft from making their XBox capable of playing PC games? This could kill off gaming console paradigm. However, I'm fucking terrified of a mobile paradigm for Nintendo. It has been shown that micro-transaction will make more money than a one-time buy. I do not want to live in a world, where I would have to spend cash to buy fairies or other items. Fallout has micro-transactions, but there is nothing you can't get with regular game play. They made the mobile game to help promote Fallout 4. These were the decisions by Todd Howard, and there is only one of him in this world.  I own far more games for my WiiU than my PS4. I'm very disappointed in PS4. Where are my JRPG's? I would be more than happy to play PS3 games/ports on it. At this point, it is more feasible to wait for a PS3 emulator to complete. My WiiU library is tiny in comparison to my Steam, but I am fairly happy with the selection of the WiiU library.  I doubt that Zelda-U will migrate to the NX. The Zelda-U could partially help and save the Wii-U. The Wii did incredible because it had Twilight Princess, and I think Zelda-U can bring a fair portion of TP's success to WiiU. If they try to release ZeldaU on NX, it will piss off customers too much."

Consoles are taking steps to become more PC like with every generation anyway. They are incorporating browsers, and other things. But they're simply not as useful, or easy to use as a PC.   Having separate consoles hurts gamers. Having a studio design their game for multiple consoles, and PC is moronic, because one or more platforms ends up getting the short end of the stick. It's a division of resources that isn't necessary.   The only advantage consoles have right now is couch co-op. And that's a software problem, not a hardware problem.   Nintendo can become a game dev, and sell their controllers to work for PC, and they would be golden. They should get out of the console business, so should Sony, and Microsoft. Consoles are obsolete.  Going PC solves so many problems, it's stupid not to focus on that. Devs only have to worry about focusing on one platform mainly. Gamers don't have to buy multiple systems just to play exclusives. There's more people to play multiplayer games with, as they won't be divided anymore. PC supports all the peripherals, controllers, etc. necessary.  With in home streamers, link Steam's Link, you don't need additional hardware. Or people can just switch to Steam Machines, which offer the best of both worlds. A straight up PC, with a console ease of use, and footprint.   Getting rid of consoles would bring the gaming community together in a way it never has been before. It's seriously the best thing that could happen in the future."
gamernews,3bzhux,Sw0rDz,2,Mon Jul 6 01:33:50 2015 UTC,"I see your point, and I agree. However, we are seeing something similar to this with mobile games. Mobile games are becoming more popular than traditional handheld gaming. Mobile games use the the micro-transactions paradigm to make most of their profile. I'm nervous about the paradigm that would be used. However, this may not become an issue.   Are you not concerned about how Microsoft make take advantage of this? I know there are alternatives for OS, but Windows is the most developed and supported OS. Can we trust Microsoft not to take advantage of all games being released on the PC?  Finally, I see a high increase in PC gaming including both hardware and software. One of the reasons we get Steam's summer and winter sale is because PC gaming is the minority of the gaming world. These sales are meant to get PC gamers to buy their game. I'm not saying that PC gaming is small or not increasing. If these sales (and others) didn't exist, would PC gaming be as big as it is now? One of the motivations to get into PC gaming is the sales/low price of games. How do I know, that the price of PC games or the lack of sales will exist if PC dominated the gaming industry 100%?"
gamernews,3bzhux,Daemonicus,2,Fri Jul 3 23:09:23 2015 UTC,"Microsoft wouldn't dare. They know that if they were to fuck over gamers, then developers would have no reason to stick with DirectX. Honestly, that's the only reason that Windows is even used for games. It's because of developers using DirectX. A shift away from that, and Linux because the gaming OS. Microsoft wouldn't want to lose those numbers.  And PC gaming has always been big. I compare it to Metal Music. It's kind of the underground thing that people know about, but aren't involved with mostly. It gets no advertising, or media attention, unless it's negative... But yet, they draw the biggest crowds, have the most die hard fans, are a global phenomenon, and is hugely popular. Numbers wise, PC is the biggest platform. Don't be distracted by GTA V numbers. Those games are just the ones that get hyped. PC Gaming is the unstoppable force that people don't talk about unless it's to put it down (just like Metal).   And the sales don't exist to compete with consoles. If you were to look at GMG, GOG, Humble Bundle, BUndle Stars, Indie Gala, etc... There's always going to be good deals on PC."

They have been promising grand things and seem to come up short. Wii U tablet for example. Great idea but poor timing. It was not the game changer Nintendo thought it would be because of Tablets. Throw into that mix that PS4/Vita streaming and it wasn't even the only console that offered game streaming.  I am afraid NX is going to be more of the same. I am guessing that it is going to be more of an opposite Wii U. The handheld will be the main console and it will stream to the TV. Unfortunately, if that is the case, It is already going to face some of the same issues the Wii U has. Many tablets are already streaming to TV (My granddaughter already plays a lot of her games from my android phone streaming to the TV). Microsoft has already announced windows XB1/Windows 10 streaming.  Unless Nintendo really does have some great secret tech I am afraid they are going to be in the same position they are in right now in 3-4 years."

gamernews,3bvdws,Wr3cK1nKr3w,4,Fri Jul 3 02:31:44 2015 UTC,Next gen is always about graphics. If you go 60fps you have to limit your graphical potential.
gamernews,3bvdws,morphinapg,-1,Thu Jul 2 22:01:22 2015 UTC,You shouldn't have to if you're only at 1080p. Problem is nextgen is pretty piss poor hardware.
gamernews,3bvdws,sorry_but,4,Fri Jul 3 11:50:41 2015 UTC,"Every single piece of hardware is capable of 1080p @ 60fps. Even PS3. Heck, even the original Xbox could probably do it. You just have to scale your graphics appropriately.  It's always possible to do 1080p60. The thing is though, 60fps always halves your graphical potential. Why intentionally limit yourself if the added frame rate doesn't do as much to the experience as the added graphics or other features? In most cases for games that don't require quick reaction, 30fps + the best graphics is always a better choice.  And no matter how powerful consoles become, this will always be true unless some console manufacturer forces developers to use 60fps, which they probably won't, because that limits creative freedom."
gamernews,3bvdws,morphinapg,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:11:01 2015 UTC,"Naw, even if the consoles were the equivalent of 980 Ti SLI, developers would build to the maximum that the console could provide, and if they aim at 30fps instead of 60fps, they can improve image quality twice as much."

When it comes to a cinematic action game like uncharted, the developers looked at it like 'making it look really good is as important as how it plays'.   Yeah, if you had PC specs and a choice between locked and unlocked frames, you'd obviously go for the latter, but this is a ps4. The developers know what they're doing and what they want to put out at the end of the day. I'm personally excited for this game, and it looks like a pretty compelling reason to get a ps4."

Furthermore, TLOU: Remastered and Drake collection weren't 60fps locked, they were variable 60fps.  I think you expected too much. Further, 30fps lock was inevitable. Devs will always prioritize superior graphical effects, animation, and a broader ""cinematic"" experience over more fluid gameplay and responsiveness. 9/10 times this will be the case.

Sure occasionally we may get big games at 60fps, but those will be the exception.

You just have to design your graphics with a particular goal in mind. On PS3 it was 720p, and on PS4 it tends to be 1080p. And if you want the best graphics possible, you just have to use 30fps, no matter how powerful your system is.

It's not that they can't detect it, it's that they're not used to qualifying higher framerates. My parents recently got a new tv with one of those interpolation smoother gizmos, and it up samples the 29.97 ntsc signal to 240hz. It looked awful, and my parents could not wrap their heads around why. It's not because they're old or anything either, it's just that they take frame rate as just one of those nebulous constants -- in the same way that someone who isn't familiar with the uncanny valley can't necessarily tell you why a shot looks bad, but they can tell that something looks off.   For most people, pretty images / videos sell better than super-smooth videos.

gamernews,3bvdws,RockLoi,0,Thu Jul 2 17:27:09 2015 UTC,"Of course, if a developer isn't putting the time into optimisation and just go 30fps because it's easier then obviously we lose. However from the past we know Naughty Dog will squeeze out everything they can to make that 30fps as pretty as possible.  TL;DR: a lazy dev will be lazy at 30 or 60."
gamernews,3bvdws,coheed256,5,Fri Jul 3 05:22:13 2015 UTC,"I guess its a matter of opinion, but I don't find low frame rate games 'pretty'. Sure, they make for great screen shots, but they certainly aren't pretty for me while playing."
gamernews,3bvdws,withoutapaddle,16,Fri Jul 3 05:40:54 2015 UTC,"It depends SO MUCH on genre though.  Many people would agree with you when it comes to racing or FPS, but many more people (myself included) aren't bothered by 30fps in 3rd person adventure games.  There is also a huge difference between 30fps when the motion blur and other effects are well done and tailored for 30fps (see The Last of Us on PS3) vs 30fps when it's just 60fps cut in half (see The Last of Us on PS4 with 30fps cap on).  It looks terribly un-smooth if the post processing hasn't been tailored to the 30fps experience."
gamernews,3bvdws,withoutapaddle,2,Fri Jul 3 11:57:49 2015 UTC,"I understand that.  It doesn't affect me quite that much, but the sluggishness of the movement really bothers me.  Also any slow pans where you can clearly make out the individual frames really bother me.  I'm mostly like you know, I do what I need to in order to get 60fps on PC, but I still enjoy plenty of 30fps games on console if I don't have the choice of playing them on PC.  Witcher 3 is a good example.  Bought a new GPU and still decided turn down a couple settings to keep a solid 60fps instead of completely maxing things out.  Foliage distance and hairworks are framerate killers in that game."
gamernews,3bvdws,MakesTooMuchSense,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:35:28 2015 UTC,It drives me absolutely bonkers playing games at a low frame rate. I'm so distracted (consciously or subconsciously) I can't fully immerse myself in the game and fully enjoy it.
gamernews,3bvdws,RockLoi,7,Thu Jul 2 15:52:23 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and it's a lot of work to optimise for 60fps and 30fps so they have to make a decision. It's not a twitch game so personally I prefer their decision."
gamernews,3bvdws,GetYourGoujOn,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:51:56 2015 UTC,"I personally disagree, maybe most people would prefer 30fps for the pretties, I think it's probably more to do with the graphical fidelity being an easier marketing tool through media than 60fps, personally I don't think you can take in the graphics properly at 30fps, it feels disconnected, the difference between the last of us on PS3 and PS4 is such a breath of fresh air, it makes for such a better, more immersive experience, is happily take a hit in the graphics groin for a smoother experience."
gamernews,3bvdws,RockLoi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:04:18 2015 UTC,"I happily take in movies at 24 fps. Now I'm not making the lower FPS is better but I definitely don't think you can't 'take in the graphics properly' at lower framerates.  Last of Us certainly felt better at 60FPS, but had I the option of a remaster with more improved 'graphics' (for lack of a better word) at 30fps I'd probably have taken it.  There are plenty of games that I think require a fidelity hit to ensure 60FPS; I just don't think Uncharted is one of them as it doesn't affect gameplay in those kinds of games since the input windows are so large."
gamernews,3bvdws,GetYourGoujOn,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:17:42 2015 UTC,"You can't compare movies to games frame rate, read this as to why   http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/RogerHgensen/20121105/180934/Framerate_and_Refresh_games_and_movies_are_not_the_same.php  Every game looks better at 60fps, there isn't a type of game that doesn't, we have been given 30fps for all this time on consoles because of the reason I mentioned previously, pretty graphics sell games more than frame rate does, and if joe bloggs doesn't know any different he won't know what he's missing.   Regardless of whether you or anyone else would prefer nice graphics over frame rate the truth of the matter is there shouldn't even be that compromise, we are just over a year into this generation of consoles and we already can't keep 1080p at 60fps, this should be the standard by now. What it comes down to is this generation of consoles are underpowered, I'll show my arse in public if they last a seven year cycle."
gamernews,3bvdws,RockLoi,2,Fri Jul 3 13:39:51 2015 UTC,"I wasn't saying there was no difference, I was talking about an ability to appreciate graphics as you stated. Even on my old rig I've chosen to play certain games (Tomb Raider for example) with higher settings and 40fps. It's up to preference.  These consoles are capable of 1080/60 with every game, if they wanted Uncharted to be 1080/60 they could have, just as you could create a game that SLI Titans can run at 30 rather than 60 if you wanted. It's got nothing to do with their power, it's a design choice.  The consoles are as close to PC fidelity as ever, so I don't know why people are suggesting that it will stunt the lifecycle more than last generation. The reasons consoles are successful are due to their price point, and the alternative is losing money on consoles as the PS3 did."
gamernews,3bvdws,Keksus_,-2,Thu Jul 2 16:18:37 2015 UTC,And the same amount of people would rather have 60fps.

gamernews,3bvdws,jukerainbows,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:31:56 2015 UTC,More than anything the way they did motion blur in that demo saved it. Just one of the many little things they did really smart.  I'd still much rather they just make games on PC.

I'd still much rather they just make games on PC.   Many of these games wouldn't exist nor have the budgets they do if they were just released on PC.
gamernews,3bvdws,cadavra41,15,Thu Jul 2 20:08:49 2015 UTC,"If we were talking mouse and keyboard controls then I would agree 100% sub 60fps feels uneven and jittery with a mouse. Hell on PC I'm spoiled by my 120Hz monitor and even 60fps doesn't feel great with a mouse anymore.   That story changes when switching to a controller. There is enough of a disconnect from the screen when using a controller that as long as you can maintain a locked 30fps it will still feel fine while playing. I would even prefer a locked 30fps experience on console rather than a variable not quite 60fps as that can introduce uneven pacing when the frames start to dip. Once you start to dip below 30fps, though, the game will feel unresponsive and broken no matter what the control scheme.  TL;DR - 120fps > locked 60fps > locked 30fps > variable 30-60fps > sub 30fps."
gamernews,3bvdws,coheed256,13,Sun Jul 5 22:17:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with your TL;DR, but I don't think a difference of input device should change the frame rate you target. Even when I play with a controller on PC, I still will try to hit 60fps. My rig isn't the most powerful, but I'm happy to turn down settings until I can get a nice, smooth frame rate."
gamernews,3bvdws,cadavra41,6,Sun Jul 5 23:08:39 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, it really all comes down to personal preference in the end.   The point I was trying to make, possibly rather poorly, is 30fps with a controller is a good trade off especially for consoles. It maintains a playable frame rate to appease the more control focused gamer while pumping up the graphics to impress the more visual focused gamer.  Games like AC: Unity show what happens when you push the visuals too far and end up with gameplay that can dip into 20fps or even lower. Suddenly the visuals are too choppy for anyone to appreciate and the controls are unresponsive enough that you can't help but to notice it.   On the flipside the console version of Arkham Knight (let's just pretend the PC version didn't happen for the sake of this argument) performs at 30fps near constantly with only minor dips down a frame or two at its worst. Now you have one of the most visually appealing open world games to date and it still feels good to play where you never really feel like the game is taking too long to respond to your input."
gamernews,3bvdws,ittleoff,2,Sun Jul 5 23:48:14 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree with you. I am primarily a PC gamer, but to be honest on console a locked 30fps is fine with me due to the experience being tuned for a controller(less precise and slower).  PC is different as you said, although I tend to value graphical beauty above frame rate. I've got a 290x so it's not much of a sacrifice, though."
gamernews,3bvdws,fenlain,6,Mon Jul 6 06:18:51 2015 UTC,"Depends on the game. I love that I can play Dota at 120 fps on my computer, and that smoothness is amazing. For a game like uncharted though, where I don't need twitch responses, I can mostly forgive 30 fps. 60 would obviously be better, but I'm not going to die over it. Considering how nice Uncharted looks it's good to have a flashy game that I can look at and think ""Yeah! That's why I bought this expensive console."""
gamernews,3bvdws,xwatchmanx,2,Thu Jul 2 15:52:33 2015 UTC,"Simple: pretty visuals are much easier to market that a high frame rate. Hell, 60fps YouTube videos wasn't even a thing until not long ago."
gamernews,3bvdws,Val_Hallen,4,Thu Jul 2 15:55:59 2015 UTC,Because the vast majority of people that play video games don't care about FPS at all.  Don't confuse the small number people on Reddit that talk up 60 FPS with the millions and millions of gamers who don't care.
gamernews,3bvdws,Keksus_,-5,Thu Jul 2 16:08:40 2015 UTC,I like to see a statistic proofing your point. As it stands 50% care more about graphics and the other half more about fps.
gamernews,3bvdws,coheed256,-7,Thu Jul 2 17:55:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's the case at all. It's not difficult to see the difference between frame rates, and how low ones could have a negative affect on the game. I don't think the loud voice pushing for higher frame rates is a minority. Look what happened to arkham knight on pc. That game performed so poorly (ie low frame rate) that they have removed it from the store front for the time being. Frame rate matters."
gamernews,3bvdws,Val_Hallen,12,Thu Jul 2 16:35:25 2015 UTC,"Look, I game on consoles and the PC, but people need to face facts: Consoles sell far, far more copies of cross platform games than the PC does.  Because of this, games made now are geared towards console specs then ported to the PC.  The PC specs are secondary for most companies.  Console players don't care about FPS because most of the games are locked at 30 anyway.    Since most gamers are on consoles, most gamers aren't complaining about 60 FPS.  The PC market has always been the smaller market."

They use very clever tricks to push the performance to its maximum with no APPARENT drop in quality.   It's their first game for the PS4. Once they get more used to developing for the platform they always make huge improvements.  Considering their history, they always make the big leap on the second game for a platform. Jak 2 was by far the best from the main trilogy, and uncharted 2 was also the best from the PS3 trilogy, me thinks."

People always forget that framerate is a design choice. Naughty Dog could easily make Uncharted 4 run at 60 fps by sacrificing graphical fidelity. If they squeeze more juice out of the console, you may see them hit 60 fps... Or they may just reinvest that extra efficiency in scene complexity.  If a dev wants to push scene complexity, they will never make a 60 fps game. 60 fps happens when they make a conscious decision to decrease graphical fidelity in favor of framerate."

gamernews,3bvdws,Keksus_,4,Fri Jul 3 15:25:45 2015 UTC,"The underlying problem is still that the current gen consoles are shit. Really. No way to sugarcoat it. That's the way it is.  The hardware was about 5 years old at release. Unlike PS3 and Xbox 360, which actually were pretty good for their price at the time of release, the current gen consoles are sold at a profit, which results in worse hardware.  So yeah. Naughty Dog are locking it at 30 to have better graphics. And if they had better hardware to work with they probably would've made it 60fps. But now, thanks to the bad hardware of consoles, we have the discussion again about if consols should feature graphic options and become more like PCs.  Seriously. It's no matter what you think about PCs and consoles and so on. I wouldn't have a problem with consoles if they were just more like the PS3 and 360 for example, which actually were a pretty good tradeoff, because for the hardware they had, they were cheap. And the hardware they had was really good at the time of their release.  But the current gen is just ridiculous. For what they accomplish they came out 5 years too late and 300 bucks too expensive.  If you want you can call me a PC elitist now. But I have some standards. The PS3 accomplished these standards at the time it came out. The Xbox 360 did too from a technical point of view, but for my tastes it didn't have enough exclusives. The current gen... seriously. The current gen is just the result of greedy companies and way too many people defend it because of brand loyalty or post-purchase-rationalization. And if you have discussions going around wanting to make the consoles more PC like you should really wonder if there's still need for consoles at all."
gamernews,3bvdws,ThatOneOverWhere,3,Thu Jul 2 16:37:09 2015 UTC,"The PS3 was also a massive money sink losing Sony pretty much the same amount they made on the PS1 and PS2 being massively successful, MS have only lost money with Xbox since the beginning compared to what they have had to put in.  Both companies lost a ton last generation, of course they want to make money. They have both also said multiple times that the PS4 and Xbox One don't make money out the gate. Sony for instance took the same path they did with the Vita where they lost money on the hardware but selling 2/3 games and a memory card would bring it closer to being even, then they would need to sell more games for any real profit on the device.  You might have noticed Sony are also massively constrained financially at the moment, they are in no position to put out a loss leader in the hopes of bringing people in. And as big as MS are and how much money they have, divisions still have budgets they need to follow and MS is known for killing products and studios that don't work out.  It was quite obvious from when they showed both their consoles off that they were being far more reserved than previous generations, and for good reason, they spent far too much on R&D for exotic parts that cost them both a lot of money."
gamernews,3bvdws,BlackAera,3,Thu Jul 2 19:10:21 2015 UTC,"Well what do you expect from a 300$ piece of hardware? Look at what studios like Naughty Dog, Sony Santa Monica and Guerilla Games have achieved with the old PS3 hardware. Uncharted 2 still looks amazing today and God of War 3 and Killzone 3 blew everyones mind when they came out. You complain because ND has to lock it to 30fps because the hardware is too weak? How powerfull do you think consoles need to be to have this level of detail at 60fps? Dude these are no 800$ PCs! If you would make a console that was fast enough for Uncharted 4 at 60fps you would have to charge so much for it that noone could justify getting it in the first place. You don't buy your kids a 600$ piece of hardware for christmas. So you build a 300$ PC and expect to have games that look next gen AND run nicely at 60fps but it's obviously not going to happen because you are not getting your parts at a price per million and end up having weaker hardware for the same money. Consoles ARE powerfull these days, you are just expecting too much. Try running a game like Uncharted 4 on a PC at 1080p with max details + 4x AA at 60fps. You are not going to get very far if you don't drop at least 1000$ on it. You can have better performance with the level of detail from 3 years ago or better graphical fidelity at the same performance. Not both. We had all hoped for it but it's not going to happen and I am all for 30-40 frames that are locked at 30fps with vsync than a game that struggles to keep 50-60fps and is tearing or stuttering like shit. If a game has tearing, it's dead to me."

He claims the standard 'consoles are just easier yolo' and I refute that PC these days is any more than barely more involved, but we get better graphics and 60fps.   Then we get into exclusives, bad ports like Arkham Knight, and the whole thing goes round and round and I want to kill things.  The comparisons here to Last of Us and the Uncharted collection running at 60fps are just stupid. Of course they do. They don't have anywhere near the graphical fidelity of Uncharted 4. This is the only thing I'm pointing out.   Adding graphic options to consoles would miss more or less the whole 'pick up & play' point of them, and most users will prefer more spectacle over higher FPS (shit, most of them probably don't even know what FPS they've been running at for the last 10 years)."

There will always be more they can do if they sacrifice the fps for other things.
gamernews,3bvdws,radioheady,3,Fri Jul 3 01:35:55 2015 UTC,"I wish more people would realize this. It's the same choice a lot of pc gamers have, either run it at a great frame rate or bump up the graphics/ resolution until you find your preference for balancing performance and graphical fidelity. For me it's only an issue when the frame rate is locked on PC (why?) or when the developers try to pretend that lower FPS is somehow preferable to higher FPS, everything else being equal."
gamernews,3bvdws,IndridCipher,0,Fri Jul 3 09:12:28 2015 UTC,locking frame rates on PC shouldn't even be brought up in a thread about a console exclusive game.  Thats a issue with shitty PC ports not Frame Rates.  If its on PC the whole point is to let the player decide.

gamernews,3bvdws,kovensky,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:01:55 2015 UTC,"I think that VSYNC should be entirely unrelated to how the game actually runs internally.  If your game gets limited to 60fps or 30fps as a consequence of VSYNC, that's one thing; if you intentionally time your game to be limited to 60fps or 30fps it's a bad thing, even worse if you actually rely on those timings to run your game logic.  Probably the best approach would be either to use VSYNC on CFR screens, or have no rate limiting at all on VFR screens (well, up to what the screen is capable of receiving). Alternatively, there could be a limit based on GPU power consumption, to avoid having your GPU spending crazy power to render 500fps on an older game when it doesn't have to."
gamernews,3bvdws,likferd,-4,Thu Jul 2 23:06:14 2015 UTC,I wonder how they manage to do this on the PC. I wonder if one could have a choice between good graphics and high framerate due to some concept where you could turn on or off effects. Could it really be possible? ..

gamernews,3bvdws,singularity2030,5,Thu Jul 2 22:45:01 2015 UTC,You mean 0.0001% of PC gamers are enjoying 144hz. I think the more important PC jump is resolution now. I've got a 120hz monitor and a 34” ultrawide with 3440x1440 resolution. The ultrawide adds so much immersion that the 120hz monitor is just a spare monitor for web browsing now.
gamernews,3bvdws,laddergoat89,2,Thu Jul 2 23:17:58 2015 UTC,You mean a tiny few PC gamers are enjoying that. The majority don't even run at 1080p.
gamernews,3bvdws,Zeno84,0,Fri Jul 3 01:29:30 2015 UTC,"It's what it is.  I mean, they're conditioned to 30 fps. And the only ones who really know any different are PC gamers."

I've been playing games since the apple ii.  I have enough money now to comfortably buy a top end computer for every room in my house with the only main limitation being my wife.  My main computer has a Titan X, a 4790K and 3 2k monitors.    You know what?  If a game is designed to be played at 30 fps, I can enjoy it just as much as the witcher 3 at 1440p at 60 fps"

gamernews,3bvdws,arfenhaus,5,Thu Jul 2 23:43:49 2015 UTC,"It's just a drastically noticeable improvement in the quality of the game and gameplay. It's like a switch that makes it go from a movie to real life, where looking around in-game is just as responsive as looking around in real life.   Yeah, it's playable at lesser framerates, and probably still very enjoyable. But PC gamers don't generally go for just ""playable"", they want the absolute best performance they can get out of their machines."
gamernews,3bvdws,throwawaygg_7,3,Fri Jul 3 08:48:35 2015 UTC,"If it looks great at 30fps   looks are irrelevant. games at 30fps objectively play worse than at 60, in all circumstances."

gamernews,3bvdws,Moyk,6,Thu Jul 2 15:42:36 2015 UTC,"LoU was developed a lot more efficiently and carefully to squeeze out every bit of performance. A port to a massively superior system (PS3 to PS4) opens up a lot of space in terms of performance which was spent on a few upgrades and the doubling of the framerate. Imagine packing for a vacation and squeezing every little thing into a hatchback and it works alright because you collected experience over the years, next year you do the same thing but suddenly a friend steps in and is like ""You can borrow my SUV!"" Obviously you won't have trouble to fit in all the old luggage plus a few extras.  Uncharted 4 started off on PS4, a new console that the devs have to get to know again and learn how to make best use of the assets available to them. The newly available performance was used for things different than the numbers PC gamers care about, but instead invested in admittably impressive visuals, which always were the big thing in Naught Dog games."
gamernews,3bvdws,cupids_hitman,4,Thu Jul 2 15:47:55 2015 UTC,The Last of Us was a port from last gen. The new Uncharted is being built ground up for the PS4. Not comparable at all.
gamernews,3bvdws,Meloku171,-18,Thu Jul 2 16:06:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly? If there is ONE game that should benefit from a 30 Fps cap, it's Uncharted.  Before I get downvoted to hell, let me tell you, I DO know and I CAN see the difference between 30 and 60 FPS. I think that most games benefit from the 60 Fps standard, specially reflex-based games like fighting games, or games striving for realism like racing sims. Even puzzles feel better and are easier to watch on a 60 Fps standard.  Now I don't think the ""30 FPS makes a cinematic experience"" line is a buzzword or an attempt at damage control at all. There are certain games that look way better in 30 FPS, and those are precisely the ones aiming to make you feel you're in control of a movie, the kind of game Uncharted wants to be.  Look at what happened when Peter Jackson filmed The Hobbit at 40 FPS: it looked fake, even after all that post-production, just because it was filmed at a higher frame rate.   The same happens with Uncharted: Naughy Dog prefers to put as much detail into the graphics to make them as believable as possible, and use the 30 FPS cap to both add more polygons and better textures, and help your suspension of disbelief by mudding it all behind a close-to-film frame rate."
gamernews,3bvdws,jamesick,4,Fri Jul 3 09:14:34 2015 UTC,"FPS in films and FPS in games look and feel completely different.  Because actions in games are calculated at the second they are made, it makes it almost impossible for any decent motion blur to be implemented.  Your films at below 30FPS work because of motion blur."

Sorry but this is total bullshit. Filming a movie at a higher fps is completely different from rendering a game at a higher fps. They are not comparable at all.

gamernews,3bvdws,LightRushin,5,Thu Jul 2 15:43:13 2015 UTC,"THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU! Know this, for it is always the case: two games, visually identical, ALWAYS looked better at 60fps. If you'd rather have a prettier game at 30, I can see the reasoning, though I would rather make compromises for 60. However no two identical games can ever look/feel/play better than at 30.  Edit: Sorry, should add. A locked frame rate is also better than a variable one. The above was written to compare consistent 60, and consistent 30."

That said, I do realize that I would be pissed about this coming from any other developer. I find it kind of funny how everyone here is scrambling to justify this while simultaneously shitting on other devs for doing the same thing for (presumably) the same reasons. I mean, again, Naughty Dog has definitely earned it, but let's at least admit that we're all a little biased in their favor."
gamernews,3bvdws,omgpokemans,7,Thu Jul 2 17:15:33 2015 UTC,"This is not technically correct. These systems were designed for CRT tv's, which use an interlaced image and would ""draw"" half of a given image in 1/60th of a second and the other half 1/60th of a second later. On an LCD screen this will equal out to about 60FPS for the screen output (60.0988 to be exact), but the actual speed that the sprites refresh at varied widely between games. For example, Star Fox runs at the equivalent of 19FPS."

gamernews,3bscp3,toThe9thPower,2,Thu Jul 2 03:06:37 2015 UTC,I meant in terms of gameplay. The newer Tomb Raiders play much more like Uncharted than the original series.

gamernews,3bscp3,purebishop,-2,Thu Jul 2 08:10:44 2015 UTC,That's pretty much what I was thinking the last time I saw footage of this game. In that this game seems more like a Tomb Raider game than modern Tomb Raider.
gamernews,3bscp3,TheObvoiousTruth,-10,Wed Jul 1 22:54:14 2015 UTC,"the original Tomb Raider was a 3rd person traversal/exploration game, and until Uncharted, it was a hilarious joke every time it tried to move beyond the original stale formula.  Uncharted has always been about big action adventure: the traversal/digitourism thing was for relaxing between the mind boggling action sequences.  .  Tomb Raider in 2015 has exactly 1 purpose:  give some me-too Uncharted flavor to frustrated xbitches who got tired of playing the same old FPS over and over.  lol"

I love the Uncharted series, but I'm just holding down the Fire Button while the game plays itself. Not one of us will have a unique experience during the game. It will be the same screenshots with the same gameplay videos since everyone is seeing the same thing. How is that a gaming experience?"
gamernews,3bscp3,duggtodeath,7,Wed Jul 1 22:12:54 2015 UTC,"As a massive Uncharted fan, I agree to an extent... This was a promo video showing an action set piece that plays out in a very direct way. There are certain areas of control, but yeah, its fairly on-rails. These are scattered throughout the campaign, but don't make up the entirety of the game. ND have said they've gone for a more open-world approach overall, so if the previous games are any indication I'd imagine there's half a dozen of these kind of sequences throughout the game which are just pure entertainment and story telling without so much interactivity, but the majority of the game will be much more player driven."
gamernews,3bscp3,jwillgrant,-3,Wed Jul 1 23:05:18 2015 UTC,"This looks so fantastic, but it's a bummer that they changed the way the main characters look. They don't seem like the same people anymore. And it isn't just age."

gamernews,3btyv4,Incrediblebulk92,4,Thu Jul 2 14:25:41 2015 UTC,"There seem to be a lot of good changes in this update that are free.  The main concern I would have is that just like when the original class updates with achievements came out, people will be focused on the missions rather than helping the team."
gamernews,3btyv4,zod000,3,Thu Jul 2 14:50:01 2015 UTC,I'd forgotten how bad that was. Getting on servers with full teams of one class all trying to rocket jump or whatever was incredibly annoying.

gamernews,3boigx,Therusher,13,Tue Jun 30 21:33:07 2015 UTC,"Looks pretty interesting & well made. I am a bit skeptical though.   It's pretty straightforward to string together a bunch of planned and scripted events that the dev will make sure they trigger in the correct sequence during the trailer to force some tense feeling & narrative.  It's VERY hard however to force the same feel/narrative when the player doesn't always do things as expected, can miss triggers/events completely, do things out of order, etc."
gamernews,3boigx,-Poe-,12,Wed Jul 1 03:33:19 2015 UTC,"Well that was an issue with P.T. too. There were some triggers and events that you would never figure out on purpose. That's why it was such a big deal when a streamer accidentally beat it.  I did notice one in this video when he goes outside, then goes back inside and closes the door to the starting room and then for no real reason opens the door that was locked at the beginning. Now If I were playing it I could imagine running around trying to figure out what to do for like 20 minutes before trying to open a door that I've already been told is locked and that I've not been prompted to open for any reason. I also don't know if I have to close the other door or if the dev just did that to draw out the tension.  Either way I think it's gonna be cool if they can grasp the spirit of P.T. and build a full game around it."
gamernews,3boigx,Therusher,6,Wed Jul 1 03:10:38 2015 UTC,"EDIT: this gets kind of rant-y so skip to the last 2 paragraphs if you want.  Yeah, P.T. Kind of forced its way around the issue by confining you to a single hallway and looping you back around until you trigger the next step. This is fine for the short teaser PT was, but for a full game players would get annoyed VERY quickly.  The house in this trailer is trying something similar(EDIT: smaller areas, not looping), but is also significantly more open (relative to PT, not other games). If the game lasts more than  15 minutes or so, rechecking every corner of every room for changes or required progression triggers would get old very quickly. Again, P.T. got around this by really only having a hallway and a bathroom, with like 3 extra main 'change' areas (each desk in the hall). You can very quickly do an entire 'sweep' of a P.T. cycle for changes, due to the linear layout and the fact that most of the items had some significance. Not so much with this game, as there are multiple rooms, each room is 'lived in' and has clutter all around (This is nice and provides a more real feeling, but also introduces 'white noise' when the player is revisiting a location looking for changes).     My main point here is that the systems implemented in P.T. lend themselves very well as a teaser/viral marketing/promotional tool, but if they were expanded on for a full game (which this trailer seems to be trying), many of those same systems will fall flat, get old, or, and I'm  not really sure how else to put this so it may not be super clear, 'age well' over the course of a gameplay session.  I really do hope to see this successful, since 'actual' horror games seem to by dying out to either jumpscare games or action-shooters with 'horror elements', but simply expanding on the PT formula will not work in my opinion. A LOT of the formula will have to be changed/adapted in order to (successfully) release as a full game."
gamernews,3boigx,diggydogg,2,Wed Jul 1 05:30:29 2015 UTC,"It's pretty straightforward to string together a bunch of planned and scripted events that the dev will make sure they trigger in the correct sequence during the trailer to force some tense feeling & narrative.   Have you been to their facebook page? That's exactly what this is supposed to be. Just a tech demo.  These 13 minutes have been put together by our small team to showcase where the development of the game is at and to give you a feel for the vibe that we're going for. In order to do that without spoiling any of the story we decided to separate it from the actual game, so while this is real gameplay it's not what you'll see in the full version of the game.   So I guess we'll have to wait what actual gameplay will look like."

So I guess we'll have to wait what actual gameplay will look like.   If that's really the case and there's a significant change going forward, then labelling the footage as 'gameplay' of the game, even prototype, is pretty deceptive. Imagine if all P.T. content was labelled as 'Silent Hills prototype gameplay' (and the game actually came out). People would be understandably upset at the apparent bait and switch. I don't think that's the case though.   I think the more likely scenario is that the shown gameplay footage is what the game will play like, with a different setting/encounters. In this case, most of my old arguments are valid, with the exception of the larger space becoming an issue and the clutter thing. That said, I can't see them creating any decent length game without having to increase world size. This either puts them back with the same issue I mentioned earlier, or puts the game entirely on rails and simply becomes more of a ride than a game."

Both are oriented toward making players visit certain areas of the world. GGG made a video about it here.  Warbands are a group of a few special enemies that are in specific areas that have smarter AI and work together. They drop league specific uniques and when the community has killed them enough times in certain areas then they move to other areas in the game.  Tempests are akin to shrines in that they buff either the player or the enemy. There are a lot of different tempests so it can be a positive or a negative effect and you have to learn them and figure out if you need to rush to get them or try to lure the enemy into them.

gamernews,3bneqa,MortimerMcMire,25,Wed Jul 1 12:33:31 2015 UTC,"I played BE on one of the free weekends and parts of it i enjoyed, such as how you can make choices about how it asks you questions about things that come up and your choices effect your civ. I also like the different idiologies. However i didn't like the maps much. I found them difficult to navigate due to the horde of monsters and the green poison gas everywhere. That really hampered expansion and contact and interaction with other civs. I also really hated the lack of unit variety. It felt like you could only make 4 guys. And when you did upgrades and new tech it never felt like you where making the kind of great progress that you made in Civ. You didn't have clubs go to spears to armored knights to guns. It was just a car that went to a different looking car... i never really got that ""advancing my civ to the future!"" Feel. More of a ""look I'm a bit better adapted for the environment i guess...?"". It was fun for the 20 hours i played but wouldn't buy it.  when i saw this i hoped maybe they would add a bunch of unit variety and give it a better progress feel. Instead they just added more water assets and a new civ. I'll continue to pass. What a disappointment in a long series of great games."
gamernews,3bneqa,MadSciTech,10,Tue Jun 30 18:43:51 2015 UTC,"Your explanation is exactly why I feel the history is so crucial to the Civ franchise.  Take out the history and you can't recapture the magic of Civ, IMO."
gamernews,3bneqa,withoutapaddle,2,Tue Jun 30 22:48:11 2015 UTC,Would be funny to see an inverse progression of the traditional Civ units. Start with cars/tanks/vehicles then go to mech suits and genetically modified beasts then to melee units with plasma weaponry and then maybe to cloth-wearing psionic (or somethin') units.
gamernews,3bneqa,Noir_,3,Wed Jul 1 08:21:04 2015 UTC,"I could go into a big rant about it, but to just touch on the unit progression, of car to another car.  Theres so much they could have done, its the future, they could still have done clear advancement surely. I haven't played it for a while, so can't 100% recall all details of the units. But I know units has wheels, so a big progression that should have been highlighted should have been wheels -> levitation, live ammo -> energy weapons. They needed to outline clear points of advancement.   If you think about crazy future tech theres loads, from the Matrix style neural links, to invisibility, teleportation, lasers, virtual reality, stuff which might now exist to day but that we know about and can understand. But advancement was kinda screwed bu the tech web, instead of tree.   The tech tree and things you build most of the time were just made up gibberish that meant nothing to the player. That was a big flaw to be, it really broke me out of hte immersion of the game in a sense, in Civ I know what an circus is, I what what it is in real life and I can inatly know what it does in game from this, I don't know what a ""Cytonursery"" or a ""Molecular Forge"" is"
gamernews,3bneqa,vereonix,3,Tue Jun 30 22:59:43 2015 UTC,"It felt like you could only make 4 guys.   While that is true of the base units each of the affinities had unique units. These units played on the overall strength of that affinity.   t was just a car that went to a different looking car... i never really got that ""advancing my civ to the future!"" Feel. More of a ""look I'm a bit better adapted for the environment i guess...?"".   Well that is because that is what this game is about. It isn't about from prehistoric to future. You are already in the future. I can see your complaint though. It doesn't feel like it has the same scope. Like it take place in fewer ""years"".   when i saw this i hoped maybe they would add a bunch of unit variety and give it a better progress feel. Instead they just added more water assets and a new civ.   They added at least 4 new buildable units that were shown in the video. By your own estimation that is a 100% increase in units. Haha j/k. Please take this comment lightly I am not trying to argue or invalidate your opinion. Just thought I would point out some things you may have missed to hopefully increase your enjoyment of what I feel is a good game. Cheers!"

gamernews,3bneqa,vereonix,3,Tue Jun 30 22:48:20 2015 UTC,"While it was still worth the money, the one thing that bothered me about Civ V was the abysmal AI. Particularly how the highest 4 difficulty settings didn't make the AI any smarter, they just gifted it free resources. Does anyone feel like Beyond Earth's AI is better, or that these expansions are helping make it smarter? I'd be tempted to try it out if it the intelligence was challenging."

I hate how I can barely tell what's going on in the environment.  Also it's all terrain is so dull... I long for earth like colors not because I don't like the variation of alien terrain but because I guess my brain is wired to like the colors of this planet. It's a bit like longing for a glass of nice clean water after drinking colorful mud.

gamernews,3bneqa,ndimoro,6,Tue Jun 30 19:04:34 2015 UTC,"Civ V was a radical shift in the series with some new concepts, greatly improved graphics,and very strong theming.  Vanilla had plenty of detractors due to the limited features and shifts in gameplay but you could see the core then of what is considered a great game now.  BE has the same graphics with a much worse UI and a really shallow theme.  It really feels to me like a mod for Civ V rather than a new standalone product, and as such the loss of so many features bothers me more than it did when V came out.  BE has a lot of other issues that bother me too.  The different factions are all very samey without interesting personalities behind them, very few of the quest choices have competitive options (if you are trying to win), the wonders are all lackluster, and balance has been a major issue for them mostly due to the complexity of the tech web/affinity system which is easily min-maxed.  The affinity victory conditions are also nowhere near comparable in difficulty or turn requirements which means multiplayer BE is mostly a mess.  It looks like Rising Tide will try to address at least few of these complaints.   Improving Faction diversity and developing the sci-fi theme out more should help BE feel more like a standalone product."

gamernews,3bk7cp,negerbajs95,9,Tue Jun 30 09:50:15 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised why they never tried to get it on Steam. Yes, Minecraft was able to reject Valve's offer and survive just fine due to how big it was already, but for a smaller indie game like Scrolls, it was really cocky to think they could thrive just by themselves.  Ask almost any indie dev and they'll tell you, being on a distribution play form helps a lot, and Steam especially. This is the reason no one has heard of Scrolls or realized it was released..."
gamernews,3bk7cp,Ph0X,-2,Tue Jun 30 13:38:06 2015 UTC,"And I'm sure there are a bunch of games on steam that people have never heard of too.  As more shovelware gets put on to steam, the more useless it becomes and the harder it is to stand out.   I can see why mojang wouldn't want to give a 30% cut to gabe. Theres no guarantee either way and with a billion in your pocket, you don't need steam, just like the success of scrolls...."
gamernews,3bk7cp,gengis,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:33:49 2015 UTC,"To be fair   Scroll came out back before Steam really started opening the flood gates with greenlight  Scrolls isn't a completely random indie game, it is fairly polished and has a still significant community being made by mojang    Given those two facts, I can guarantee you it would've done fantastic on Steam and would've gotten at the very least a few Frontpage mentions, which does absolute wonders for games."
gamernews,3bk7cp,Ph0X,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:34:15 2015 UTC,"Which goes to what I'm saying. Unless you get on the front page (at steams discretion) or you are AAA steam does not mean success for an indie.   It has its advantages, but steam isn't some savior to indies.   Scrolls, had it been success worthy, would have succeeded with or without steam.   Saying that you can guarantee success is a stretch. A big one at that. There are plenty of games that succeeded prior to steam or were a success before getting onto steam.  A good game succeeds, steam doesnt make a good game succeed."
gamernews,3bk7cp,gengis,2,Tue Jun 30 19:54:10 2015 UTC,"This SPAZ post-mortem makes me believe otherwise http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2411076  before getting on steam   As a side note, by now Richard and I begun to call SPAZ “the lemon” in our conversations. We were fairly certain that we would be able to juuust dig out way out of our debt hole between Impulse and our other distribution. We knew we would never make any money on SPAZ, but at least we would break even and no harm no foul.   after getting on steam   It has arrived. SPAZ v1.0 the final was about to go on sale for the first time, and it was going to launch on Steam! We had the sales tracker primed, and were already refreshing like madmen. We had our forums open as well. Monitoring activity. 10Am rolls around, and I am watching the forum guest counter. It went mad. Up until then, on a good day, we had 10 concurrent visitors. We hit over 200 right before my eyes. A quick look at the sales and they were amazing. Like AMAZING. Like I need you to understand what I am talking about here.

gamernews,3bk7cp,donwess,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:48:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with the first part but not the latter.  Yes, Steam won't make any utter shit game (and there's QUITE A LOT of those lately on Steam) famous, but it will significantly help decent games succeed and thrive, and like I said, Scrolls had all the required parameters for that. Where it failed was exposure, which is where Steam would've come in.  Literally half the people in this thread had never heard of the game or never knew it came out, that right there shows you that the issue was exposure. Yet, much smaller and less polished games have had far more exposure than Scrolls had, thanks to Steam.  To say that it would've succeeded with or without Steam if it was good is an extremely naive way of looking at things. It's absolutely not true and you know it.  Heck, even Minecraft, if it hadn't gotten lucky, may very well have forever been a small game no one ever noticed. It's all about exposure and hitting that critical mass, which Scrolls clearly failed to do."

Before Minecraft, he would post tweets like the ones about 0x10c and nobody really made a fuss. It was just an indie dev experimenting and toying around with a demo. However after he got famous any tweet he made became news, any project that was demoed became an announcement, any disagreement became a big war, with people taking sides, due to news and drama hungry media/audience.   0x10c was never anything concrete, it was just another demo he made. Any programmer will tell you that this is what happens all the time. You get an idea, hack away at it, and than get bored of it. This is especially true if you livelyhood doesn't depend on it."
gamernews,3bk7cp,Halofit,3,Tue Jun 30 09:28:36 2015 UTC,"There are some really good GDC talks about this under the ""Failures"" dev talks. I can't recall which dev specifically, but he talks about how in developing a game you have a basic idea of what you want to do, but then there is a ""wilderness"" surrounding that idea that you have to explore, and you really won't know how fertile the game's idea is until you get to that point.  As a result, (and I can speak from experience on this) game developers often times will work for a seemingly long period of time on a project only to grow disillusioned with it upon realizing that their wilderness is not particularly fertile ground for good ideas. I would imagine this is what happened with 0x10c, the only thing of course is that as you pointed out, Notch could tweet about what he ate for breakfast that morning and kotaku would publish it, so people were getting excited/pessimistic about a game that was so early in development it really probably wasn't ready to be digested by anyone outside the indie developer circle that understood how unfinished and unlikely it's completion was."

gamernews,3bk7cp,toastyghost,6,Tue Jun 30 00:54:08 2015 UTC,I don't regret paying for scrolls. Did I encounter a few bugs? Yes. Was the game a broken unplayable mess? No. Scrolls was no DAYZ. Scrolls worked well and for some time had a decent population of players. The strategies were interesting and the matches were very fun.
gamernews,3bk7cp,SCHLONG_SWORD,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:41:49 2015 UTC,"i can't speak to that title specifically, but i've heard enough horror stories that i shy from the early-access model generally.  and hey, you're the one who spent the money, so it's totally your call whether it was worth it."
gamernews,3bk7cp,toastyghost,2,Wed Jul 1 01:30:57 2015 UTC,I completely understand since I normally do the same thing. I don't preorder (preordering only made sense back when you bought physical copies of games.) and I usually don't buy early access games without watching several LPs and reviews. Scrolls looked like a blast and so I went and bought it.
gamernews,3bk7cp,SCHLONG_SWORD,3,Wed Jul 1 14:26:23 2015 UTC,"Early access can be great (prison architect, kerbal space program, minecraft) it's just that you have to either take a risk, or like the game in its current state."
gamernews,3bk7cp,patrick227,3,Tue Jun 30 05:02:11 2015 UTC,"I think that's the most important point. I've bought many early access games and haven't regretted it yet. I made those decisions based purely on what they were, not on expectations of what they could be.  Currently playing Ark and having a blast. If the game gets better and more fleshed out over the years, that's just a bonus."
gamernews,3bk7cp,Im_thatguy,2,Tue Jun 30 17:48:20 2015 UTC,"and there are certainly early-access games that are worth it, and i didn't mean to imply otherwise. but i'll be able to play all of those when they're not early-access anymore. :)"
gamernews,3bk7cp,toastyghost,2,Wed Jul 1 01:33:23 2015 UTC,True. I just jumped on the early access games I have because they have had all I wanted. Though I can definitely see the merits of not wanting to get tired of a game before it's even feature complete.
gamernews,3bk7cp,patrick227,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:39:36 2015 UTC,Yeah well I don't buy early access games because of their business expertise or marketing budget. I buy it because it's a good game... Buying based on marketing is how you get shitty AAA titles that aren't complete without DLC and cost 3x as much
gamernews,3bk7cp,fobfromgermany,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:55:54 2015 UTC,"neither do i. but if they appear to be incompetent at even funding early development, it's a bad sign for the game ever actually being finished."
gamernews,3bk7cp,toastyghost,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:28:56 2015 UTC,"So.... is there a good deck-management card game for PC that doesn't constantly try to milk you for DLC money?   Magic the Gathering 2014 was good, but started wanting to milk you for moneys Magic the Gathering 2015 was all about milking you for moneys Hearthstone is all about milking you for moneys Scrolls was apparently all about milking you for moneys (I dunno, I never knew it was out)"
gamernews,3bk7cp,immerc,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:57:27 2015 UTC,"Um... There's Pokemon TCG for Game Boy, and Card Fighter's Clash for Neo Geo Pocket Color...  I think those were the last two card games that didn't try to milk people for money."
gamernews,3bk7cp,GregEvangelista,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:09:00 2015 UTC,"Scrolls was apparently all about milking you for moneys (I dunno, I never knew it was out)   Actually the only thing you can spend the premium currency on related to the gameplay is a selection of 6 random face up cards per day and a handful of preconstructed decks, both of which which you can also buy with in-game gold. The rest being entirely cosmetic like appearance items for your avatar.  The random card packs can only be bought with the in-game gold which you cannot buy with premium currency. A big complaint from the community is actually that there isn't enough you can do with the premium currency, which probably helped lead to the trouble they're in now."
gamernews,3bk7cp,WetTuna,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:29:23 2015 UTC,"I also never new it was released. I now know why: it's not on steam!  Maybe they should have tried putting on steam before giving up.  Regardless, their heart probably just isn't in it anymore, and that more than anything is a perfectly valid reason to shut it down."

gamernews,3binnb,Torvusil,3,Mon Jun 29 15:20:04 2015 UTC,Was this the game that was multiplayer only or am I thinking of something else?
gamernews,3binnb,Veritasgear,-6,Mon Jun 29 17:47:26 2015 UTC,"The original certainly was, which was a goddamn tragedy. I made it as far as it being in my cart before I realized and just flat out bailed. Wished there was a single player version so I could have given them some money, now they're making it and it's peasant only? Piss off."
gamernews,3binnb,Bucklar,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:58:48 2015 UTC,"On steam the metadata says it has single player. Do you mean that the single player element is negligible?  Also, can you play it on multiplayer over LAN, or at least in a private lobby with friends only? The game looks pretty damn fun, though."
gamernews,3binnb,TempusFrangit,3,Mon Jun 29 19:18:45 2015 UTC,"There is no single player element at all. It's entirely multiplayer. There aren't even bots to fill out the lonely arenas.

gamernews,3binnb,Bucklar,2,Mon Jun 29 19:23:59 2015 UTC,"I booted this up a few weeks ago, I do think there's a single-player portion to the game now. It's not exactly fleshed out but I'm pretty sure there are AI things you can blast..?"
gamernews,3binnb,Ulti,2,Mon Jun 29 19:48:06 2015 UTC,Nope. There isn't. I'm honestly surprised you think there is. Are you sure you were playing strike vector? There are speed challenges with stationary targets.
gamernews,3binnb,Bucklar,2,Mon Jun 29 20:02:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe that was what I was thinking of. I still keep tabs on it more or less, but only really when I grab a few friends to play on one of the empty servers."

gamernews,3binnb,TempusFrangit,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:44:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation.   Google says no private server hosting, no lan.

gamernews,3binqh,DonPoppito666,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:28:44 2015 UTC,"The ""Incinerate 'n Detonate"" content pack will add Demo and Firebug. They're also redoing the zerker skill tree ""from the ground up"", since it's widely agreed that the zerker skills suck terribly. They're also changing the parry hit reaction to make it more obvious it's a parry, and the melee bash will be a separate attack (currently it's just a standard melee).  I think most of us are still awaiting Sharpshooter most eagerly, though...  Edit: Also, get rid of the teleporting zeds, and this game will be pretty much perfect for me."
gamernews,3binqh,yoshemitzu,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:40:12 2015 UTC,"The biggest complaint I have is reload is tied to the animation.

gamernews,3bapz8,KoboldCommando,7,Sat Jun 27 16:11:20 2015 UTC,I think you give Apple too much credit.  This seems much more like it began as a knee-jerk overreaction than as a well thought out policy. The calculation is in the backtracking.  Which I think is in line with how they usually handle their App Store.
gamernews,3bapz8,brocktopus,13,Sun Jun 28 03:56:56 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, this is a more complex issue than most make it out to be.  The work is long, and hard; that much is true. But the people working there are doing it actively, by choice, in a similar manner to a young person working at a silicon valley startup- except the Chinese factory worker has a better guarantee of monetary gain.  In general, the people working in these factories are rural laborers who are making exponentially more at the factory than they would back home. On the money they make from 6 months of work, their entire family can live off of it for 2 years, or a couple could live off of it for 5.  Furthermore, the reports of suicide are actually without context. They're actually happening at a lower rate than what the average suicide rate is for the area, and even lower than the American suicide rate.  This isn't to say conditions can't be improved. But ask the workers there if the factory should be shut down, even with all of them receiving a single year's living expenses for themselves- and there are serious doubts you'd get nearly anyone signing on."

As to Apple's relationship with Foxconn, this isn't the case- the conditions still are not up to American standards, but they're considerably better than they were when originally investigated."
gamernews,3bapz8,quaunaut,0,Sat Jun 27 20:55:43 2015 UTC,"What would those children be doing instead? If they're from rural areas they probably wouldn't have access to schools and if they did it wouldn't be enforced. They'd most likely out in a field doing farm work or running around the town/city area going through trash.  Seriously consider the area before you talk. It's not like the UK and US everywhere. A lot of these people have no future outside of farm work and much of that farm work is just to sustain themselves. In comes a textile or electronic factory paying consistent wages that are above the norm for that area. It'd be like if Apple opened a factory in bumfuck wyoming in a town of 1,000 people and offered work at 2x the normal wage of the area. Not a bad situation at all. People in China fight over trying to get a job at Foxconn because it pays so well there.  You say sweatshop but honestly, it's preferable over farm work. And they're not rounding up kids to do this either. It's not like they go snatching them up and forcing them into labor. This is voluntarily done by the people and families."

gamernews,3bapz8,GivingCreditWhereDue,16,Sat Jun 27 18:53:49 2015 UTC,"You are correct, it's an extreme analogy but the principle remains the same. Capitalism is by its very nature, the act of exploiting the labour of the many for the principle benefit of the few. Now of course this doesn't mean most of us in the West don't do reasonably well out of our own exploitation but that's got nothing to do with the benign wishes of those who exploit us, it has to do with organised Labour and the long fight for better conditions and greater reward for our efforts. We too used to be slaves, or feudal serfs if you prefer, and we fight daily to stop regressing back to that state, and this is not an extreme analogy, I mean it quite literally.  The opening up of places like China means that big companies now have a workaround solution to all the hard won rights workers in the West have acquired, they can now start exploiting others who are more desperate, and ""willing"" to settle for less.  We fool ourselves of we pretend it's anything other than an attempt to go back to the old ways of serfdom and slavery."

Removing the market will simply let the poor people of China slip into worse jobs or no job at all. They choose to work at those locations, because the other choices are less than savoury and would continue to exist even if China was living in a bubble with no contact or knowledge of the outside world.

And guess what, instead of the current global situation where the elites are hoarding the vast majority of money that's made, it instead goes into the hands of the workers, who spend it on consumer goods, creating more demand, more jobs, and more profit for all?

People in the south aren't to blame for the civil war, but by having pride in that fight, they're supporting it's objectives which were entirely a fight to protect the ownership of other human beings.   I'd hate for it to be misunderstood as a symbol of racism as it most certainly was not intended to be.   It absolutely was intended to be.  It's was pushed in the 60s as a push against civil rights and then they glossed over that.

I just think you're completely misrepresenting southern culture.   It absolutely was intended to be.   I'm telling you (again, did you grow up in the south) that it is not and has never been. Contrary to popular belief, most people in the south were rebelling against the union. Do some research and you'll find plenty of examples of blacks proudly displaying it as well. What kind of sense would that make if the primary motivation was to support slavery? Slavery was/is a political issue elite on both sides have used for there own purposes during and after the war.  The general culture of the south is one of freedom and sovereignty. For most (not all, but most) the confederate flag represents this rebellion against the union. It's nearly identical to the ""don't tread on me"" flag/concept from texas. Southerners are proud of being independent and keeping to themselves. For most, this is what it has come to represent.  Again, for the politicians involved, it means something else. Screw those racist assholes and I'll gladly stand beside anyone who wants to take a stance on it.  Now, don't misconstrue what I'm saying here. I think the time has come for everyone to move past this. Southerners should simply respect that most of the US now sees this as a sign of racism. There's no point in fighting that. This is what it has become. We (southerners) should simply concede that for a lot of people this is a hurtful thing and move on. Arguing otherwise would be ignorant.  That said, we shouldn't look back and start calling people racists simply because they proudly displayed the flag in the past. For many, that was not the intent. As a metal fan, this is the best example I have. He's probably one of the most well respected and loved guitar players that have ever lived He stood up against hate in the community and was generally a force for good. It was a huge loss when some asshole shot him on stage. I'd hate for people to think he was some evil bigot or that he deserved what he got or something like that. There are many other similar examples in the biker community, southern rock bands, etc...  I don't fly the flag.

Do some research and you'll find plenty of examples of blacks proudly displaying it as well.   Ah, the black confederate, the favorite card of the southern apologetic.  I'm sure there are jews wearing a swastika too.  I already acknowledged there is the possibility of ignorance being a factor.   Southerners should simply respect that most of the US now sees this as a sign of racism   Most have seen it that way for a long long time, especially the huge portion of southerners who were subjugated under it.   That said, we shouldn't look back and start calling people racists simply because they proudly displayed the flag in the past.   Either they were racist or ignorant.  That guy could have been either.  Obviously no one is saying a racist or someone ignorant deserves violence, they deserve proportional criticism.   so I feel compelled to point out where people's assumptions are incorrect when they paint with such broad brush strokes.   I think my brush stroke is sufficiently broad.  I acknowledge there is ignorance at play as well.  The good thing is now that this is becoming a very vocal issue we're able to differentiate the racists (who fight to defend flying the flag at the state house) from the ignorant (those who stop flying the flag of racism).  Seems like a good thing to me."

gamernews,3bapz8,Mason11987,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:24:05 2015 UTC,"You can be proud of an area without being proud of it's history man. Hell, you can be proud of a certain era or a certain accomplishment without being proud of the rest. For example, I'm dutch. We had the whole VOC ships? Recall those? Yeah, lots and lots of them were used to transfer and sell slaves. Am I proud of that? Am I proud that one of my ancestors owned one of those ships and was selling slaves? No. In no way or form am I proud of that. People are people, they aren't property no matter who they are. However, VOC icons are everywhere to be found in the Netherlands and we are definitely proud of it. We are proud that in that time it was a golden age market wise and we were on top. We were proud that we were the only ones allowed to trade with Japan for the longest time while the rest wasn't even allowed near. We are proud that in history books, VOC still gets mentioned. Does that make us proud of slavery? No. It makes us proud of an accomplishment.  The same with the Southerners you are talking about. Southern pride doesn't automatically translate to 'I hate black people and go slavery!'. No, it simply means 'I am proud of this little area I call home.' One doesn't automatically translate to the other. It's not that black and white.   The problem with symbols is that they have multiple meanings. The swastika wasn't german and definitely wasn't a symbol for hate and white supreme power, the pitchfork belonged to poseidon instead of the devil, etc etc. There are multiple sides to the story.   The problem with removing it from stores and games and..well...everywhere really is that it gets erased from history. It becomes a blank space in the books. And then it gets forgotten. The reason why we don't want that to happen is because we shouldn't forget. In no way should we forget the horrible disgusting things we have done to each other so that we will learn not to do it again. History is more than just facts, they are lessons too.   Is racism ever going to get abolished? Probably not. We can hope but I for one highly doubt it. People discriminate because at our core we look and we judge and we are horrible. We look at what another person has and make an excuse to take it from them. We look at our own misery and make an excuse to blame it on someone else. We feel low, we hurt someone else to make ourselves feel superior. 1000 years from now that will not have changed. What we can do...what we should do...is for those of us not so completely horrible as the rest to do better than what history has shown us. But in order to do that we do have to know what that history is.   So do I think you should be waving said flag in a coloured persons face and scream white power? No, hell no. That is beyond horrible. Do I think games, books, memorabilia and such should be allowed to carry it? Yes but do it smart. those things have an educational capability too and we should use it.  Should we start screaming about racism every time we see said flag anywhere? No. Chances are that flag is there, not for 'white power supremacy and we need to shove it in those black people's faces', but for something else.    Don't start screaming the same few lines over and over again. it has a tendency to just make the screamer tired and won't get anyone anywhere. Screams fall on deaf ears, talk gets heard. sometimes at least.   anyway, this is already long enough so I'll cut it here."

Fly a flag with a cross on it, fly one with sweet tea, fly one that says y'all.  But flying the symbol of subjugation of black people IS racist.  They have a million possible symbols but they stress the one which makes half their neighbors feel like shit why?"
gamernews,3bapz8,Mason11987,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:11:34 2015 UTC,"Okay, I did some more history checking because while I find American history interesting I am in the end Dutch....and therefor have learned more about Dutch history than I do American.   So here is what I found. While it's true that the confederate flag was flown in the south it was actually the stars and stripes flag that was used by all the slave ships...they didn't fly the 'rebel flag'. The Stars and Stripes was also used in the New England states where fortunes were made off of the slave trade and it was used as well by soldiers performing genocide on the Indians.  Furthermore, the war between the North and the South didn't even start about slavery. It started about State Rights and the South wanting to remain independent, the slavery thing didn't come until later. So....the Confederate flag wasn't flown pro-slavery during the civil war. it was flown pro-independence.  So there you have it's meaning. The fact that slavery came into play later actually has no bearing whatsoever on it because it wasn't about apartheid it was about economy. I'm going cold logic here. Slaves were..in essentia..free labor..that if they abolished it they would suddenly have to pay for causing a huge gap in the economy and a lot of farms would shut down causing an even bigger gap. The North had the industry, meaning they wouldn't suffer such a big loss. The South was mostly farms. So not even the Slavery thing was about apartheid, it was about money..pure and simple. I'm not saying that it was a good thing, simply playing devils advocate.   Yes, the slavery was horrible and utterly disgusting but if you look at it from a pure cold logical viewpoint one can understand why it was an issue for the south. Did you know by the way that there were free POC's in the South during that time? Free POC's, free black people that owned plantations and had slaves of their own? Did you also know that Robert E Lee didn't even own slaves while a lot of Northern generals did? Northern Generals...who were supposed to be against slavery according to many...owned slaves...well into the war. Hell, Lee was even for abolishing slavery, he just claimed it wasn't a good idea to do right that instant and in the way the Northern government wanted because it would wreck the South. Not that the war didn't wreck it but you know...semantics.   As to your argument that said flag translates to hate....not completely. To a lot of people, especially POC, yes it's seen as a symbol for apartheid. But to a lot of those Southerners waving it it's....actually not...it's seen as the Rebel Flag by a lot of people and as such has the symbolic meaning of breaking away from the norm or the group. Choosing your own way if you will and fighting for your own beliefs and independence. Which is what the South was fighting for, independence...not, you know, the whole slavery business, that came later.   Furthermore, there is more than one Confederate Flag. You have the 1st, the 2nd and the 3rd Nationals, you have the Battle Flag and then you have different Confederate Flags for all the states. The fact remains that there was only ONE flag flown on the slave ships. The US flag of stars and stripes.  The flag being talked about here is the 1st Battle flag of Northern Virginia. So....the flag everyone is blaming of being racist was only carried by a small portion of the entire army that made up the Southern force, it wasn't used by the Southern Government and it never was used on any slave ships or for political reasons. It was a sign of home, to boost morale.   The KKK also didn't use just the confederate flag...they waved around the stars and stripes just as much. So it was both flags being used in those times. The reason the Battle flag was used by them sometimes was because the founder of the KKK, Nathan Bedford Forest, was a confederate soldier.   Yet the confederate flag is the one being seen as the symbol for hate and apartheid while the Stars and Stripes isn't. Why?   So to summarize:  The Confederate flag was flown in a civil war that started because of State Rights and the South wanting to stay independent, the slavery thing was more about money than apartheid, wasn't even used by everyone in the South and it was used about 50% of the time by the KKK  The Stars and Stripes flag was flown by every single slavery ship, was displayed by soldiers performing a genocide upon the Indians, was prominently displayed by the New England states who were making loads of cash on slavery and it was used about 50% of the time by the KKK.  So.....how the heck is the Confederate flag seen as a racist thing if you put it up but if you put up the Stars and Stripes you are a patriot.    I also notice that you only took about 1 line from everything that I said, so I have to assume you agree with the rest. I'm quite glad that you can see the issue with removing it from books, games and what not. History shouldn't be forgotten. We have to be the ones that remember, not the ones that forgot."
gamernews,3bapz8,Sunago,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:39:20 2015 UTC,"it was actually the stars and stripes flag that was used by all the slave ships...they didn't fly the 'rebel flag   Of course, the US ended the importation of slaves (and banned slavery in the north) many many years before the civil war.   Furthermore, the war between the North and the South didn't even start about slavery. It started about State Rights and the South wanting to remain independent, the slavery thing didn't come until later.    This is just false . Read the cornerstone speech, read the secession documents.  The only thing that's true is that it was about a state right, the right to own people.   The South was mostly farms. So not even the Slavery thing was about apartheid, it was about money..pure and simple.   To quote the cornerstone speech by the VP of the CSA:  ""Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition.""  So you're mistaken.  There is obviously a financial aspect because owning people is cheaper than employing them, but it was absolutely racist in it's founding, and it's purpose.   Furthermore, there is more than one Confederate Flag. You have the 1st, the 2nd and the 3rd Nationals, you have the Battle Flag and then you have different Confederate Flags for all the states.    Of course, this doesn't really change anything.  They're all flags of racism, they're just different ones.  ""The confederate flag"" is the phrase most frequently used to refer to the Virginia battle flag.  The fact that another flag could also use the phrase doesn't really change anything since they all stood for the same thing.   So....the flag everyone is blaming of being racist was only carried by a small portion of the entire army that made up the Southern force, it wasn't used by the Southern Government and it never was used on any slave ships or for political reasons. It was a sign of home, to boost morale.   Addressed slave ships above.  It was also used extensively in the 60s as a way to promote the fight against civil rights, another purely racist motivation.  So while the Virginia battle flag may not have been the symbol of racism until then, it was also a symbol of racism as it was the flag of an army formed with the purpose of fighting to expand slavery.   I also notice that you only took about 1 line from everything that I said, so I have to assume you agree with the rest. I'm quite glad that you can see the issue with removing it from books, games and what not. History shouldn't be forgotten. We have to be the ones that remember, not the ones that forgot.   It will always be in books, no one is going to forget the civil war, we have hundreds of museums about it and literally millions of books covering it.  What IS needed is education.  If it's flown like it's been flown people mistakenly think it wasn't about promoting slavery (like yourself).  This is a problem and this discussion is good because it allows you to learn information like the claim that the CSA flag wasn't flown on slave ships is just silly, since slave ships were done long before the CSA.  I'm curious where you read these things.  Credible historians don't ignore the racial aspect as your source seems to have done.  I've also never heard someone try to defend the CSA flag because it wasn't on slave ships.  What have you been reading?  So about everything else you said:  I agree it shouldn't be removed from books/games where it's relevant.  But I don't think it's generally doing that, I think a few companies are just making PR moves.  I agree racism isn't going away, and I have no illusions that calling a flag racist will make racism go away even if the flag stops flying on a state capitol building.  I don't think anyone was screaming anything, but yeah screaming is bad  The difference between pride in VOC and pride in the confederacy is that VOC wasn't founded on the cornerstone that negroes are inferior and with the most important mission to extend their subjugation.  If you have <10 years of actions by an organization and they were essentially all for furthering slavery at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives than it doesn't make sense to be proud of that unless you're racist."

Apple is in a PR move, such is capitalism.    But let's not pretend that flying the flag isn't about standing up for your right to own slaves, or your write to keep your schools segregated.

It wasn't until 1655 the judicial determination in the Thirteen Colonies holding that a person who had committed no crime could be held in servitude for life.

Without console gaming would have never gotten as popular as it is today. Those huge customer bases make these massive games possible. Consoles made gaming much more accessible than it had been in the past. This led to an overall rise in gaming popularity. Which helped EVERY platform including PC.     Gaming on PC is more complicated, that is just a simple fact. It certainly isn't as bad as some people might think, but it is definitely more complicated than gaming on consoles. Tons of people are never going to want to fuck with ini files, or video card settings, or the games graphics settings. So this idea that consoles are just terrible for gaming is bullshit. They bring some negatives to the table, but they also make some truly fucking massive games possible."

Playstation people see xbox games and want them and vice versa, all those games can be played on PC, Sony and Microsoft have divided their market.  It's not the 80's and 90's anymore when a console can surpass expensive computers, now a cheap computer can run these games easily at 1080p 30fps on medium or higher.

That would be alot less man hours and money if they had to create for one platform no? Potentially making up for the less people on one platform."
gamernews,3b9f98,Codeine_au,2,Sun Jun 28 02:53:54 2015 UTC,"No. Absolutely not. Because PC is not just one platform really. There are so many hardware configurations they have to take into account. It makes it very hard to get a game optimized well. Most games nowadays are not going to be on older generation consoles. Especially once more next gen consoles get sold. So it will eventually be 3 platforms like normal and the PS4 and XB1 ports will be much easier to create because of the x86 architecture the new consoles have.     Porting is also not really the biggest issue. It is the creation of the video game itself. So making it one time for one platform is not really much less work than making it once and porting it over to several platforms. I am quite impressed by just how little you understand about video game development.     Consoles made gaming much more accessible, and much more popular than ever before. Because of this, there were many more customers buying games, and thus they could spend more on these big titles. Without these consoles, we could never have games as big as GTA V or many other triple A titles.     What I have just said is factual. It isn't even debatable. You are simply wrong on this. Without consoles we wouldn't be in some gaming paradise. Consoles are a necessity in all of this my friend. You owe them more than you care to admit."

The previous Batman games were always delayed a bit on PC. This one wasn't.     I love how you disregard pretty much my entire comment where I am just routinely stomping your shit into the ground, and then bring up one fucking game by one developer as if it is proof that what I said was not accurate?    Porting a game over to Xbox 360 and/or PS3 is much more complicated than it is for PS4 and XB1. This is a fact. The new consoles are basically closed platform PC's. Hell the PS3 had that atrocious ""cell"" architecture which made porting for it a nightmare.

Dropping into a crouch, you creep forward so as to not give away your position to the multitude of enemies you'll no doubt soon encounter.

Instanced multiplayer/co-op retains the sense of the player being important and exploring untouched or ancient lands. Nearly every square foot of most MMO's has been more heavily trafficked than your average mall.  I just have 0 interest in playing a game where my existence is trivialized to that extent. It's not simply the fact that I'm not ""the chosen one"" (though I won't lie that that has at least something to do with it since that sense of empowerment is nice) it's that what I am doing in this world is hilariously common place. The number of characters wearing god-tier equipment and wielding abilities that would make Zeus and Odin piss their pants in fear somehow outnumbers the total population of average shopkeepers in the world?

gamernews,3b6da0,gasolinesnuggie,4,Fri Jun 26 23:26:40 2015 UTC,"For a lot of games yes, but I don't see a way for it to work well with BGS games.   If they want to make a co-op game it should be a spinoff title developed by a separate studio."
gamernews,3b6da0,bflynn65,3,Fri Jun 26 23:38:33 2015 UTC,"Well, you don't have to see a way. The developers do."
gamernews,3b6da0,gasolinesnuggie,6,Fri Jun 26 23:58:58 2015 UTC,The developers clearly don't see it that way given the lack of multiplayer.
gamernews,3b6da0,bflynn65,2,Sat Jun 27 00:10:01 2015 UTC,No shit. That's too bad.   I doubt it was because they thought it would hurt single player. This makes sense.

gamernews,3b6da0,andycoates,0,Sat Jun 27 00:13:53 2015 UTC,"Here's a list of everything I can think of that would be affected by co-op.   Loot Enemy NPCs Quests Companions VATS Collectables   Imagine you're playing through a semi fresh character. You've spent some hours, completed a few quests, when a drunk/asinine friend drops in and kills a very important quest giver. Now you're fucked out of that quest (or, even entire quest line ending with a godly weapon and a ton of exp). Now everyone in that town hates you and you're completely bared from that area.   That one instance can push a lot of quick tempered fans into reselling the game, and going onto reddit to rant how Bethesda ruined Fallout.  I'd suggest waiting for the inevitable Fallout MMO, or find some post-apoc indie title.  Edit : The disagree button is that thing that says ""reply"""
gamernews,3b6da0,DemonicCorndog,2,Sat Jun 27 07:22:47 2015 UTC,"If you can't trust your drunken friend not to fuck up your game, that's your friend's fault. Also, if you don't like the idea, don't play multiplayer. There are plenty of us out there who want to run around Tamriel or the Fallout world with a friend, even if it just treats them as a follower when it comes to talking to NPCs"
gamernews,3b6da0,Raen465,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:42:56 2015 UTC,"A Fallout MMO would be so fun if it were bug-free, had well-written but dynamic quests, and had a compelling way for players to create their own factions with minimal NPC interference that was taken seriously by other players. Which isn't going to happen, but god damn it would be good."
gamernews,3b6da0,FlamingSwaggot,-2,Sat Jun 27 23:53:11 2015 UTC,If its in the game then its not optional. There will be doors that require a partner to enter or impassible puzzles that are not part of the main story but you cant finish without a friend thus it wouldn't be optional.
gamernews,3b6da0,ReaperGN,4,Fri Jun 26 23:20:51 2015 UTC,"There are games that have an optional co-op that doesn't change anything. Halo comes to mind, as does Fable 2. Fable 3 would have worked as an example, but there is a door that requires another player to be opened. However, removing that door wouldn't have changed the game in the slightest. It was just a stupid design choice, like a lot of things in Fable 3."
gamernews,3b6da0,LemonyTuba,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:27:46 2015 UTC,"Think Skyrim or Fallout 3/New Vegas, where you can have a friend jump in your game as a follower. They can't interact with anything and always jump to where you are (instance wise).   Bam! Optional coop! (it's a little more complex than this, but you get the idea)   There's no need to create a complex coop experience in a game like this. It can be added to the single player game without requiring special coop sections or parts.   I would just live to play this game with my brother tagging along from time to time.     An example of a game that does this is Fable."
gamernews,3b6da0,Pluckerpluck,3,Sat Jun 27 04:09:12 2015 UTC,"tbh, how did that work out for Fable? Was it a positive or negative experience? Bethesda is not a studio who wants to make use of such a half cooked principle you just mention. If these guys want to make an awesome open world co-op adventure they will probably make a separate game for that."
gamernews,3b6da0,bigbuts94,3,Sat Jun 27 04:51:39 2015 UTC,"Remember that Fable didn't already have followers, so the game wasn't balanced for them, whereas Fallout is."
gamernews,3b6da0,BaneWilliams,3,Sat Jun 27 06:25:05 2015 UTC,"Who wants to be the follower, though? Sounds like being Player 2 in Duck Hunt or in Super Mario Galaxy. Sure, you can fight the creatures, but combat is not and never has been Fallout's strength; Fallout is all about being in control of what you do, and as a follower you barely have any. Plus, what do you do when your friend uses V.A.T.S? Just sit there and wait till he finishes?"
gamernews,3b6da0,FlamingSwaggot,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:51:23 2015 UTC,"V.A.T.S. Read up what that stands for. Unless a follower is from a vault / has a pip boy, they won't have access to that. They will get slowdown when the main user enters.   You say you will not be in control of anything. I'm sorry, but if my girlfriend and I can experience fallout together like that, deciding as a unit what to say and what to do and where to go, that's plenty special. I can remember back to my younger days of playing with brothers in RPGs and doing much the same, hell, I only found Symphony of the Nights additional castle by my bro being like ""so what if we did this in this order""  You seem to forget that many people and many players are perfectly comfortable not being in the drivers seat. Nintendo understands this with most of their multiplayer, but we as hardcore gamers sometimes forget."
gamernews,3b6da0,BaneWilliams,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:15:15 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point. I guess I was thinking about me and my friends, who would not want to be the follower."

gamernews,3b6da0,Duhya,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:26:16 2015 UTC,"I played Fable 2 and tryd 3 and I found both games lacking in everything. I loved the original. My point being the people who make Fallout and eso will never bring out anything that isn't super polished. And that is why there is no multiplayer/co-op. They will need at least 2 extra years to make a mp they will be satisfied with. So I think the chance of it being some expansion or a standalone is way bigger, than them adding some shitty 2nd person who can join the game what everyone is crying for, which will have a lot of bugs probably.  Edit: typo"
gamernews,3b6da0,bigbuts94,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:40:50 2015 UTC,"An example of it actually working well was Saints' Row the Third. Fucking awesome game that was 10x better if you brought a friend along.   However, the big issue with co-op is the lack of mods. Skyrim without mods would have been boring as shit: though Skyrim's world was incredible, the quests were bland and the game's balance and combat were just terrible. Fallout is a far better game in these respects, but the bugs are every bit as rampant as in every other open-world game of a similar scale, and would be even worse (and unpatchable due to lack of mods) in co-op. Besides, I wouldn't want to be parted from Project Nevada, or from WME."
gamernews,3b6da0,FlamingSwaggot,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:48:21 2015 UTC,"You could have mods, just do it in a Torchlight-like style.  Torchlight requires everyone has the same mods as the host. Simple.  Yeah sure some people might not like that but some people aren't going to like the vanilla experience either, so you're giving the boot to one side regardless of what you do."
gamernews,3b6da0,MrTastix,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:22:35 2015 UTC,"Simple.   Oh god no it wasn't. There was a 10 mod limit, you had to have the load orders identical, and if you wanted to go over 10 mods you had to merge the mods together, also with the same load order. It makes sense that this was required, but jesus christ it was anything but simple."
gamernews,3b6da0,FlamingSwaggot,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:41:44 2015 UTC,"It's really not that complicated. Just because the implementation in Torchlight II sucked doesn't mean the whole thing wasn't simple. Having everyone require the same mods and the same load order is pretty basic given that Bethesda's games have a copy/paste system for both. There's a file that governs what the load order currently is.  It's possible to have a system that downloads the hosts mods and load order. I'm not saying it's not going to be a bitch to code but you know what? So is fucking everything else. Coding is hard, regardless of what you're doing.  The fact that Torchlight II had a mod limit is irrelevant. It's not like you can't just remove it. Frankly, there was no valid reason to even have it once people started making modpacks. Any kind of ""size"" and ""confusion"" issue went out the window after that.  Runic decided to simply put the responsibility on us and frankly, I don't really give a shit. I'd rather have the ability to do then it be pigeon-holed into a vanilla system despite the fact that all of Bethesda's games are practically built for modding. It'd be fucking silly to make a co-op TES game then block modding just because you don't want to ""confuse"" the players, as if modding for TES and FO3 isn't already fucking confusing as it is."
gamernews,3b6da0,MrTastix,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:28:22 2015 UTC,"Recent titles that have done co-op well in my mind are: Dark Souls, Far Cry 4, Dying Light and Saints Row 3 and 4. ARPGs like Borderlands, Grim Dawn and Diablo 3 aren't too bad either.  Generally story progress is made only for the host. In the case of Dark Souls, Far Cry 4, Borderlands etc, you would need to play through the game twice. Once for your friend, once for yourself, though it's not like this is really necessary since you both get unlocks and shit throughout either campaign anyway.  It's not like Fallout 4 couldn't do that but it does take resources away from singleplayer (usually by diverting existing staff or hiring more) and the gains aren't felt by everyone.  Personally, Fallout 3 and Skyrim weren't exactly marvels of storytelling success. Sacrificing more for co-op gameplay wouldn't really be a huge loss to me at this point."
gamernews,3b6da0,MrTastix,8,Mon Jun 29 05:21:07 2015 UTC,I never play MMOs - it's not my thing. I would so be in favor of Fallout Online though.
gamernews,3b6da0,MarcusDA,19,Fri Jun 26 13:23:24 2015 UTC,"I was SO on the Hypetrain for ESO, believe me.  An Elder Scrolls MMO, what could go wrong. Exchanged news with a friend over the better part of a year, every little bit.  Bought the Deluxe Preorder for almost 100 Dollars, whatever the name was.  Imagine my disappointment when I realized that ESO was nothing like the games I loved so much, but instead a clone of WOW with ES-Lore slapped on.  So if you want a Fallout MMO, perhaps reconsider.  A 2-Player CoOp version, though, I'd still pay a lot of cash money for that."
gamernews,3b6da0,Haekel,4,Fri Jun 26 14:40:22 2015 UTC,So a kind of hybrid between Borderlands and Fallout?
gamernews,3b6da0,Vacation_Flu,6,Fri Jun 26 20:33:04 2015 UTC,"If you mean 4 Player CoOp, then yes, why not. I'd be fine with 2, though, like Saints Row does it. I really enjoyed playing those games with a friend of mine.  But Fallout shouldn't really mix with Borderlands in other regards. Borderlands has the quirky humor, and Fallout is a tad more gritty. Doesn't mix too well."
gamernews,3b6da0,Haekel,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:36:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's pretty much what I mean. The story & player interaction would be a challenge to write, but it could be done.  I'm thinking an armed trade caravan travelling through a new area, gets ambushed by some local thugs. You and your travelling companions escape with whatever they didn't steal, and now you're stuck broke and lost. Maybe with a bounty on your head offered by whoever owned the merchandise you failed to protect."
gamernews,3b6da0,Vacation_Flu,3,Fri Jun 26 21:00:44 2015 UTC,"SWTOR did a fine job solving the ""Who's talking to the NPCs"" dilemma, if you're referring to that by mentioning player interaction.   In case you haven't played it, it works like this:  NPC talks, each player is presented with a set of choices, and chooses what he likes. Chosen by a weighted random roll, one of the players answers gets chosen and you see that character talk. Depending on how often your choice is NOT winning, you get a bonus on your next rolls. Abstaining also gets you that bonus.  It may sound clunky, but it works really, really well. Apart from some very relevant changes in the outcome in a discussion (""Shall we kill the dude or ransom him?""), of course, but most groups decided those things either on the fly or before they even started (""Let's play Dark Side, folks"" or something like that)."
gamernews,3b6da0,Haekel,2,Fri Jun 26 21:07:31 2015 UTC,"The issue I can foresee (though perhaps this is with my friends only) is that we have a huge argument where two people are for Mr. House, while the other two are for Caesar's Legion, and we yell at each other over Skype for an hour and a half until someone has to leave."

gamernews,3b6da0,FlamingSwaggot,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:56:02 2015 UTC,"The land of milk and honey, I guess? Not entirely sure. I guess a lot of it was me being hyped; I kind of had high expectations, and trust in Bethesda (they had a hand in this, after all).  If the world had been more open, less dense, BIGGER, with the players spread out more... say, 100 to an instance the size of The Rift, that would have been cool.   I never really understood why they went with a closed class-based system, when ES-games always had a much more open system. Related to that, the skills... eh, I just don't know, it felt wrong, constricting.  In hindsight, I guess what I really wanted was Skyrim with a slapped on (small scale) Multiplayer, in a bigger, fresh world."
gamernews,3b6da0,Haekel,2,Sun Jun 28 00:19:19 2015 UTC,"The problem is that you can't have an MMO with quests that truly impact the world, dozens of different skills that dynamically turn your character into an archetype-defying reflection of whatever you want, and a well-designed real time combat system. This is because, respectively, latecomers feel left out, hardcore players will find the most overpowered builds and never use anything else, and latency issues. This makes every MMO basically a copy of WoW with a couple combat/crafting/questing/whatever differences, a new world, and some newfangled pay model that everyone bitches about."

I don't doubt that Zenimax has improved the game since launch, but I very much doubt that they were able to fix exploration for me. There were waaayyy too many players around and the areas were just too small for it to seem like wilderness. The world just seemed to dense. There was no space between the sights.  I'm not saying it isn't a decent MMO, but it's nothing special to me, either. And not what I expected when I first heard of an Elder Scrolls MMO."
gamernews,3b6da0,Haekel,6,Fri Jun 26 19:05:26 2015 UTC,"There were waaayyy too many players around   That's still a problem in ESO. There's no worrying about where you're supposed to go because all you need to do is follow the line of players who are the same level. I was playing a quest where i had to go to a tomb and kill a monster. The tomb was three rooms (one hallway and two open chambers) and the monster was in the third. There were two nearly continuous lines of players, one running to the boss room and one running back to the door.   I didn't really know what I was expecting. The only other MMOs I played was City of Heroes about three years before it got shut down so it was pretty empty."
gamernews,3b6da0,canadianD,3,Fri Jun 26 20:11:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, they should have used more instances. Putting everyone in one world sounds nice in theory, but in practice, you get what you just described.  Do they still have bots farming the bosses the very instant they respawn? That was a real pest at release, and even in Beta."
gamernews,3b6da0,Haekel,3,Fri Jun 26 20:41:11 2015 UTC,"I've seen a few of what you described but I haven't been playing that much lately. I'll go on like two day sprees where I'll play a bunch, get bored quickly and then go back to Witcher 3. I've gone on early in the morning and there's not many players but basically the evenings are just fields of players grinding the same goblins and skeletons as you. As I said, I only ever played CoH and those servers were DEAD. The few players I'd run around with often commented on how dead it was.   That's what scares me about a Fallout MMO because it would completely ruin the game world for me to see a bunch of other people in Vault suits crawling through some bunker that they're telling me hasn't been opened in 200 years. I do support the whole co-op thing. I really enjoyed the 4 player co-op missions that Red Dead Redemption had. The stories fit in with the world.

Small scale co-op wouldn't require a major shift in game mechanics, story style, or even overall experience, you would just get to share it with friends.  They could all be support characters, like the AI controlled companions you already get, and they wouldn't even need to be able to do dialog interaction with NPCs, the ""hero"" could do that and everyone else could just observe.  I would love it if they would optionally expand on that and allow multi person interaction ala Knights of thr Old Republic, but I would settle for just starting with having someone jump in my game and be my companion."

Guess too many people complained it was equivalent to cheating and savescumming.  Not sure how I feel about that it if it's the case, though."
gamernews,3b6da0,cyniclawl,2,Fri Jun 26 13:25:10 2015 UTC,Do it like bullet time in Max Payne 3's multiplayer smart guy.
gamernews,3b6da0,MarcusDA,11,Fri Jun 26 16:45:06 2015 UTC,"What slow the clock for everyone in game?  That would get annoying really fast.  Okay so say it was just as simple as taking the existing game, adding netcode for online muliplayer and other changes for splitscreen, adding a companion browser, rendering the game twice for splitscreen, making VATS slow everyone's game clock at the same rate and solving all the other limiting issues with magical code - you'd also have to re-balance EVERY area for a second player at any/every level.  Now you get to tell the fans why the game is delayed another 2 years and/or broken at launch like the standard for most games with poorly implemented multiplayer."
gamernews,3b6da0,ScarboroughFairgoer,2,Fri Jun 26 23:15:12 2015 UTC,"They could have done it the same way Bioware did it in Neverwinter Nights. Have an option to keep the active pause (VATS, in our case) during multiplayer, or turn it off. It's still there in single player, and if it gets annoying in multiplayer, then turning it off is just a compromise you make to play with a buddy."
gamernews,3b6da0,LemonyTuba,2,Fri Jun 26 16:58:34 2015 UTC,Or you could do like red dead redemption did with deadeye. It didn't slow the time like in single player but still gave and added accuracy.   Maybe you could make the vats targeting available but not slow time?
gamernews,3b6da0,With_My_Hand,4,Fri Jun 26 17:23:42 2015 UTC,"I like the idea, but it's not VATS without the bullet time view going from your weapon to the enemy."
gamernews,3b6da0,PenguinKenny,-3,Fri Jun 26 23:33:54 2015 UTC,"It is not in Killing Floor and it could be localised. If the other player is nowhere around you could have a VATS bubble and then you could just turn vats off in MP.  Anyway, no MP is kinda rendering the base making useless in my book"

gamernews,3b6da0,welltheresAbacon,2,Tue Jun 30 11:56:33 2015 UTC,Seriously. Some games don't need co-op. Fallout is one of them. If they want to make a multiplayer Fallout it should be a different game.
gamernews,3b6da0,metalmartyr,3,Sat Jun 27 01:49:07 2015 UTC,"I imagine co-op Elder Scrolls/Fallout would be fucking hell on PCs simply because of mods.  I mean, you and all your party members need to have the exact same mods & mod load order for it to work.  Some like say SkyUI and ENB probably not as those are purely client side/graphics things, but any change to mesh, scripting, new areas, new creatures, weapons, etc etc etc and if one person doesn't have it.. its Game over.  Crash to Desktop.  The other options are to make Steam Workshop required so when you do log into a game, it can autodownload the mods and set them up in the right order (I can't see this happening on Nexus, at least in any kind of ""dumb/automated"" way)...  Or force Vanilla only co-op.  Both options would create a large shitstorm.  Probably best to not ever bother IMO."

Do you expect your co-op partner to go through the several hour process of installing the exact same set of mods?    I know for me setting up Skryim or Fallout is a day long affair of installing, testing, shit broke or runs -60fps, find out what and uninstall it, back & forth bullshit and a lot of ""praying"" its stable once it is set up.  Now do that for 3 of your friends.  Let any one of them not be all too computer savvy enough to mod properly so you gotta walk them through it.  Fuck that shit man.  That's too much work.  It ain't like the old days where we all played one mod like Quake Team Fortress or something and that was easy to install.  You can do that, but 100+ mod combinations that aren't guaranteed to work on everybody's hardware?    And who's gonna get the blame when its a broken piece of shit?  User's hardware?  The modder(s)?  Steam/Valve?  Nope its gonna be Bethesda.  Pitchfork & torches all around.  Ain't worth it.

For the most part the goal is to play with your mates, not random strangers, so getting both setup usually isn't nearly as much of a hassle. Not to mention if there were servers or the like then they could do like we used to do with custom maps in CS: Download them before we can join.

Since the end of the American Civil War, private and official use of the Confederacy's flags, and of flags with derivative designs, has continued under philosophical, political, cultural, and racial controversy in the United States. These include flags displayed in states; cities, towns and counties; schools, colleges and universities; private organizations and associations; and by individuals.  The state flag of Mississippi features the familiar Confederate battle flag in the canton, or upper left corner, the only current U.S. state flag to do so. Georgia's state flag is very similar to the first national flag of the Confederacy, the ""Stars and Bars"", even though its design has not incorporated the Confederate battle flag (X-shaped, blue saltire with 13 white stars on a red field) in the canton since 2001.

gamernews,3b2vsd,sock2828,7,Thu Jun 25 21:41:58 2015 UTC,Saying the confederate flag is nothing but a racist symbol is incredibly oversimplifying the history of it and the current cultural meanings behind it.

I don't know a single person who would proudly fly the confederate flag in Pennsylvania that isn't more-than-typically racist.   That being said, I don't even care. People are allowed to be racist.

It symbolizes different things to different people for a lot of complicated reasons.  People should stop being so terrified of upsetting others though."
gamernews,3b2vsd,nss68,2,Fri Jun 26 04:34:50 2015 UTC,"that is interesting. Oregon feels to be far enough away from anything surrounding the civil war that confederate flags wouldn't even be a thing out there. I can only assume the people flying it moved there from an eastern state -- but obviously that is only an assumption.   Flying the confederate flag doesn't make someone racist, that is true. But people are aren't racist probably wouldn't fly it, because it definitely has those connotations.   I am a bit racist as most people are. I am not proud of it, I am not championing it, but I know it affects my opinions of others, and ultimately how I treat them (which doesn't mean I treat them poorly, but certainly differently)   That said, I still wouldn't fly the flag because it has a strong connection to other very proud racists."
gamernews,3b2vsd,maxis2k,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:15:07 2015 UTC,"Oregon is kind of a divided state.  Well over half the population lives in and around Portland and take pride in their very urban/hispter lifestyle.  Then there's a large percentage of people who life outside of Portland and think people in Portland are just downright crazy.  These people take pride in their rural lifestyle.  Or at least, what they perceive as a rural lifestyle.  Living 20 miles outside of Salem in a city like Silverton isn't exactly rural in my view.  Its small, run down, full of petty crime and cheap housing...but you're still 30 minutes away from a major urban center.  Where most of these people go for their work, school, shopping and etc.  Anyway, my point was that a lot of people in Oregon identify with things that are considered 'rural'.  Nascar, farming, small communities, country music and yes, the confederate flag.  But very few of these people seem to have any direct connection to those things.  They just seem to have all these symbols and listen to a specific kind of music because it goes with 'the lifestyle'.  Just like so many people in Portland have to own a dog and have to drink coffee.  Because its part of the 'lifestyle'.  Yet most of the people I have met in Oregon moved there from places like California, Idaho or Colorado (or want to leave to one of those places).  All that said, I think this whole flag controversy is just another spacegoat for the real issues going on.  Everyone is afraid and angry about everything.  So when someone screws up on TV, politics or civil service, millions of people are ready and willing to blame them for all that's wrong in America these days.  And not their own bad parenting, lack of voting in elections, lack of connection to the greater community or twisted freedom ideologies.  This year, everyone is looking to blame the police and a flag for all the problems in America.

Most educated people, or anyone who has read Dan Brown, will point out that the swastika has been around for 1000s of years and was almost universally a positive symbol.   The confederate flag was actually not the official flag of the south. It was much bloodier, as it was the battle flag flown by General Lee's army. Think about that. This flag was flown as Americans killed Americans, brothers killed brothers. All to keep slavery legal in the south and the expanding west.  So, when the south (or any one) flies the confederate flag, what exactly are they celebrating?"

I assure you that those people don't give a damn about this Confederate flag issue because they understand that the problem lies in people's views and prejudices that must be unlearned and not in symbols and words.  When has banning something solved the problem. If you take away a symbol, people will find other ways to express their ideas. The hate in racism does not lie in a flag, it is in people's minds."

British redditors, including yourself, have taught me that the English flag is often used by racist and that most English people only use the English flag around the world cup and other similar events.   Now imagine if the English flag was created for a specific time in England's history where southerns England fought  northern England in order to preserve slavery. Imagine the flag didn't exist before that divide.   THAT is why a lot of people don't like the confederate flag. To fly it is ignoring the historic context and ignoring the mass number of people who think it is offensive.  It would sorta be like flying the Nazi flag because you're German and wanted to honer those that died in WW2.  It would be ignoring the whole context about concentration camps and how the Nazi flag is a symbol of racist."
gamernews,3b2vsd,sock2828,4,Fri Jun 26 23:27:38 2015 UTC,"No, they also say it's a neo-nazi symbol or a symbol of any one of the many groups that have taken that symbol for themselves. I doubt many are very benign in nature though, so you can't really say anything remotely good about any of them.  The reason why the original peaceful religious symbolism of the swastika doesn't get talked about very much in the west is that not many people follow those religions in western countries, but every once and awhile those religions and cultures do bring it up.  The civil war was primarily fought over slavery, not racism. The north and the rest of the US was quite racist too at the time. Most still believed that darker people were inferior, couldn't govern themselves and needed the stewardship, guidance and ""enlightenment"" of the ""superior"" races worldwide.   After the confederate defeat there was a huge amount of bitterness from both sides and the confederate flag in particular became a remembrance of what had happened in the war to the south. Which was a lot of destruction, death, and loss.  It became a symbol of southern pride and of those who died in the war that didn't really have much of a connection to racism to a lot of southerners.  It wasn't until around the 50's that when the KKK started constantly using it that it became so heavily associated with racism, but the alternate symbolism still remains in areas of the US.  I may not agree with what the south fought for in the civil war, but I can't really tell them that their flag is nothing but a symbol for racism when it has mostly symbolized just southern pride and bitterness to groups of people throughout history, and still does to some. Especially when you consider that a few soldiers chose to fight for the south even though they didn't really agree with slavery, and this kind of thing was happening to them and their families.  ""Until we can repopulate Georgia it is useless to occupy it, but utter destruction of its roads, houses, and people will cripple their military resources. By attempting to hold the roads we will lose a thousand men monthly and will gain no result. I can make the march and make Georgia howl. We have over 8,000 cattle and 3,000,000 pounds of bread but no corn, but we can forage the interior of the state.  W.T. Sherman""  Saying it's just a racist symbol ignores the complexity of the issue of racism, slavery, history, and shouldn't be encouraged. It's also kinda like implying your interpretation of the symbol and what it means is the correct one and other personal uses, meanings, and interpretations are invalid."

gamernews,3b2vsd,sock2828,6,Fri Jun 26 06:16:24 2015 UTC,Ultimately I don't think that matters very much. It rose to prominence through the KKK. It has a deep history of use by racist people with racist ideology. Whatever groups see it as benign is irrelevant to what it actually is.
gamernews,3b2vsd,yourfaceisannoying,0,Fri Jun 26 08:30:51 2015 UTC,"And what the majority says to the people who use it as a symbol of southern pride and remembrance of the death of southerners during the civil war is irrelevant to how they see it, use it and what it actually is.  Symbols mean what YOU think they mean, and I don't really think you can tell somebody that their interpretation or use of a symbol is wrong. Especially when the south themselves created the symbol and I think are all free to define it how they want.  As is anyone really.  The confederate flag has a history of being used as a symbol of southern pride that has existed continuously since the end of the civil war, and the north and the rest of the US was quite racist too during that era. The main disagreement was actually centered around slavery. Most of them still agreed that darker people were inferior, couldn't govern themselves, and needed guidance from the ""superior"" races.  I'm absolutely sure that a much higher amount of people who fly the confederate flag in modern times are racists than the average, but I'm also sure that there are people who aren't racists that fly the flag.

To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.”"

gamernews,3b0kj9,inkfish_,6,Thu Jun 25 03:32:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know why people keep saying this, but Sony is definitely helping them pay to make this. 2 million is not enough to make a game at that scale, especially when the first Shenmue took 47 million to make.   I just hope this sort of info keeps getting disseminated so that people have a realistic idea of how much money goes into game development. Unfortunately with this particular example and not actually outright stating how much they are getting from Sony/Shibuya it doesn't give a clear picture at all. Does the crowdfund make up 10% of the budget? 2%? 90%?  I'm about to try and crowdfund something myself and the amount of stress we have that our budget is going to be too big for expectations is crazy, even though the number is barely reasonable for us to be able to live on for the time it'll take!"
gamernews,3b0kj9,monkeyjay,9,Thu Jun 25 04:50:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. Kickstarter projects are really skewing people's perceptions about the cost of games. Especially when most of them aren't transparent about the costs and don't mention if they are getting money from other investors.   That being said, there have been some amazing games that have been made that wouldn't exist without Kickstarter (KRZ comes to mind). I wish you luck on your project!"
gamernews,3b0kj9,inkfish_,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:15:52 2015 UTC,"Yea it's ridiculous how gamers expect a decent Kickstarter project to be funded with around $250,000 and want it rammed with features like their AAA counterparts.   I find the demographic is very irrational and demanding as a whole"
gamernews,3b0kj9,filthy_sandwich,3,Fri Jun 26 01:54:41 2015 UTC,"Sony is benefiting the same way Shibuya is benefiting from the PC version. They are publishing partners investing in the product. While they are contributing toward development, none of the Kickstarter take goes to them. Rather, it goes toward filling the gap between that funding and what it takes to make a game and, beyond that, paying the tab to ad features X, Y and Z."
gamernews,3b0kj9,aresef,5,Thu Jun 25 10:55:19 2015 UTC,"Paraphrasing Adam Boyes et al, if Suzuki had to rely on more conventional funding, he would be beholden to Sony executives more than the fans. He would have to constantly mollify financiers and cut stuff that they can't be convinced is worth the money. Also, securing that funding would take months, maybe up to a couple of years. Kickstarter reached its $2 million bare-bones goal in 12 hours."
gamernews,3b0kj9,aresef,-3,Thu Jun 25 04:12:37 2015 UTC,"Its really not all that matters. What matters is that anti-consumer practices are derided from the moment they appear, regardless of what bait a corporation dangles in front of people."
gamernews,3b0kj9,mishiesings,2,Thu Jun 25 12:07:26 2015 UTC,How is it anti-consumer?
gamernews,3b0kj9,aresef,3,Thu Jun 25 04:30:26 2015 UTC,"Different commenter, but failed or compromised Kickstarters certainly have elements which are far less consumer-friendly than the traditional publishing model.  With Kickstarter, the end customer is taking all of the risks —whereas the publisher model puts all the risk on the publisher—; have less direct contact with and control of the production process —whereas the publisher model has a single (or small number) of clients directly engaging with the software house—; and if the game that takes shape as a result of the Kickstarter user's ""investment"" isn't to their liking, they have no option to un-purchase their copy of the game —whereas when a publisher produces a game you don't want, you simply need to not purchase it.  That's not to say that the Kickstarter model is without benefits. Kickstarter's biggest benefit in terms of game production will often be the ability of the process to capture the attention (and investment) of the people who most want the game, and gives the producers the ability to engage with those people who have invested in the game in order to create the game most-wanted by the people who most want that kind of game. There's certainly an opportunity to create something very special from the crowdfunding process, but it's not without risks for the consumer.  Let's then add a traditional publisher back into that mix. In the very worst-case scenario, let's say that a $30m game is being created. Let's say that $5m is raised by crowdfunding. If at any point the publisher —the major investor in the software— loses interest in the project (maybe because the market has become saturated, in the way we've seen with a number of recent MOBAs that never made it out of beta), then the crowd-funders aren't going to be able to make up that shortfall, and the publisher will have saved themselves $5m at no real cost to their bottom line.  Like I say, there are definitely consumer-positive elements to crowdfunding, but adding a publisher into the mix does raise the possibility of some really quite serious problems if the project begins to fail."

This is Yu Suzuki, aided by many of the key people who made the first two games happen."

But does it mean the remaining funding from Sony is diverted?  You can't possibly think that a total lack of transparency around how the game is actually funded isn't a big question when it comes to a kickstarter project. Until they actually give some proper info about it, this is more like an even earlier pre-order scheme."

gamernews,3aywd5,Nefferpie,6,Wed Jun 24 19:17:19 2015 UTC,"It's highly likely that the characters involved are not in both versions.   E.g. MalexMale only works in one version because they only wrote a malexmale romance for one male NPC, and he does not appear in the other version."

gamernews,3aywd5,PandaStyle00,7,Wed Jun 24 16:44:28 2015 UTC,I like that they didn't make the characters sexuality dependant on the players gender. It gives the characters a bit of realism to them.
gamernews,3aywd5,Denivire,2,Wed Jun 24 20:53:57 2015 UTC,"The point is they probably cant fit both storylines into the same game, so they split the game. It is odd that they force you into one gender though"

gamernews,3aywd5,BlackAera,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:55:23 2015 UTC,"I'm all for forward progress, but this irks me quite a bit. First, it sounds like there is only a single gay NPC of each gender, which only your player character may marry. I'm hoping said NPCs aren't only gay if your PC pursues the relationship? The article says they can only pursue a same-sex relationship with your character... Are we going to run into the problem we've seen in some Bioware games where you get to cherry pick your NPCs sexuality with these two NPCs? It also feels kind of like they're adding token gay characters to avoid another Tomodachi fiasco.  Finally, separating the genders by version is really weird to me. Are they trying to make it a selling point? You can be a lesbian in this game or gay in this other game! Get both! Are they presenting the same-sex marriage as a novelty, rather than something that just is. It feels wrong.  I'm having trouble collecting my thoughts right now and I hope I conveyed my feelings properly and worded things right - I just felt like this needs to be discussed."

gamernews,3aywd5,PandaStyle00,6,Thu Jun 25 01:24:55 2015 UTC,"So no one is giving a clear explanation...  When characters fight next to each other they become closer. That leads to better combat bonuses when they fight next to each other. And if they are opposite gender and max out their relationship they get married, then you can get their child as a unit to fight with because of some shenanigans.   Of course parent stats and skills effect the stats and skills of the child, so it is an important mechanic for harder difficulties.  Also to note is the marriage stuff is pretty new. And I am not sure if more shenanigans are going to make it possible to reproduce with the gay couples, but that is also probably why the gay choices are limited. If gay characters can't reproduce players miss out on some important units."

gamernews,3aywd5,Pencliff,3,Thu Jun 25 04:46:49 2015 UTC,It never was the focus in the past. Previous games have platonic paired endings such as a man vowing to return a child to its mother. Or two buddies who will travel the world together. It was Awakening that bloated up that every pairing should be romantic and diluted the brand recognition from being a strategy game to a glorified dating sim.

Compare HL2's graphics to TF2's graphics. Yeah there's a few years in between, but they're both old enough to be obsolete. Since TF2 is cartoony though, the graphics don't get as dated as quickly."
gamernews,3axh26,Fantonald,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:33:33 2015 UTC,Because it's made for a market who prefers stylized graphics over realistic. I think it looks great personally.
gamernews,3axh26,TunaSammich,10,Wed Jul 15 03:07:35 2015 UTC,"This trailer tells me absolutely nothing about the game, other than it exists and looks very cartoony. So I looked up the developer's web site. There's another video there, that shows fragments of what looks like interviews with some of the people involved, and more importantly; a bit of gameplay.  https://youtu.be/hqvzxyfIz4s  (My Korean isn't very good, neither am I any good at recognising faces or voices, but I think that's Sid Meier at 0:45.)  From what little we see of gameplay: It's a third person view MMO with faction warfare and a big focus on construction. That actually sounds quite interesting to me. One of the things I can't stand about most popular MMOs are the completely static game worlds that the players have little or no influence over. In this one it looks like we'll see entire cities constructed by players.  The developer, XLGames, has also made the quite successful MMO ArcheAge (which I haven't played, so I have no idea if it's any good).  My biggest worry is balance between factions. Civilization multiplayer tends to get terribly unbalanced late game, when some players usually leave others way behind in technology and production. It's bearable because a multiplayer battles only last for hours, but it might become unbearable in a game where battles last for weeks or months."
gamernews,3axh26,Skafsgaard,4,Wed Jun 24 12:57:45 2015 UTC,Archeage is a totally average MMO with an interesting crafting system that is kept behind a paywall. So nothing memorable.
gamernews,3axh26,Fantonald,2,Wed Jun 24 14:18:44 2015 UTC,"The cool thing about this take on an MMO is that it basically resets every three days. So, you cooperate with your faction in the span of those three days to accomplish as much as possible, and then start over - like a new match of Civ.  For someone who's not into MMOs, that sounds a lot more appealing to me. Also, MMO combat seems very dull to me in general, but it appears that I can instead focus on stuff like construction, coordination and advancement instead, which are the things that appeal to me in Civ in the first place."
gamernews,3axh26,Skafsgaard,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:15:44 2015 UTC,That does indeed sound interesting.  Do you know if there will be victory conditions like in the older Civilzation games?
gamernews,3axh26,huvo,2,Wed Jun 24 17:20:51 2015 UTC,"I haven't kept up to date on the game in a long while, but I got very excited when it was announced, and made a mental note to keep track of when it would release. As far as I remember, the game does indeed have multiple victory conditions, ala regular Civilization.  I'd also say it's alluded to in the trailer - you see a total war breaking out, and soldiers invading a city. But rather than it all ending with massive destruction and one victory, you instead see a rocket launching (classic science victory). What I took away was that it's supposed to be one civilization that's really warmongering and building up a massive army to take the world by force. Another civilization is mostly being on the defense, and unable to compete in terms of sheer firepower. Instead that focus on getting that rocket ready, and in the end they succeed in launching it and winning the game just before the invasion of them would do them in. Basically, it's the scenario of having another player invade your Civ, and he's one turn away from taking your capital/last city, when you finally manage to launch a mission to Alpha Centauri, and just barely win the game."

After what I've seen with ArcheAge, they have some good ideas, but they fail horribly on the implementation side. There are client side hacks still plaguing ArcheAge that no modern MMO developer should have let occur (as in, the server doesn't properly sanitize client data). They seem to have absolutely no interest in maintaining security or fixing glaring bugs in a MMO they run as long as the money keeps coming in. Firaxis made a very big mistake picking this dev studio for Civilization online, and will likely regret it as much as Trion."

I hated Guild Wars 2 because it felt like nothing more than a boring collect-a-thon with some of the worst group PvE and structured PvP content I have ever seen in any MMORPG.  WvWvW was pretty much a boring zerg-fest where server imbalances and shitty game design greatly outweighed any sort of player skill and where the lack of respawn points made it a game of running around an empty, desolate, barren landscape for 15 minutes before reaching the zerg rush which will either kill you or assimilate you, depending on which server you're playing on.  SPvP content feels very poorly balanced with certain classes such as Warriors getting shafted in the PvP department. It's also solely based around holding three capture points with no variation in game modes whatsoever.  And don't get me started on dungeons either. The lack of tanking and healing roles, as well as the complete lack of a threat system makes instances nothing more than fighting crude clusterfucks of enemy mobs that spam skillshots.  Also, there's no point of building anything other than full glass cannon DPS because of how everything is based around dodging telegraphed enemy attacks with character movement, which is easy to do in the context of this game.  Does Heart of Thorns fix any of this? Or is it just the same old shit?"

gamernews,3ar670,PalwaJoko,9,Mon Jun 22 21:06:45 2015 UTC,So what happened?
gamernews,3ar670,Advacar,21,Tue Jun 23 01:10:09 2015 UTC,"Two things. They announced their first expansion which included a new character class, but did not include a new character slot with the expansion. Meaning that the developers were expecting existing players to buy a new slot for $10 or delete an existing character if they wanted to try the new class.  The second is that the FAQ for the expansion made it clear that it required the base game unlike the original Guild Wars, which had it's first three releases be separate campaigns that all acted as a base game. Many people interpreted the FAQ as encouraging the player to get the base game now so they could be ready for the expansion. However, last week ArenaNet announced that the expansion would come with the base game for free. A lot of people felt like AN had suckered them into buying something that they were going to get for free. And plus, asking for a refund on your base game would delete any progress you had made on that account.  Now it seems that AN has heard the outcry and is trying to fix it."
gamernews,3ar670,RansomOfThulcandra,2,Tue Jun 23 03:52:35 2015 UTC,I'm curious what percent of players have all their character slots full. I'm only using one so far.
gamernews,3ar670,Gandalfs_Beard,2,Tue Jun 23 15:07:21 2015 UTC,"So I looked up some info since I've never played this game.  Your profile starts with 5 character slots, but I believe you can get more with a premium currency. There are 8 professions, which for all intents and purposes look like classes. And there are 5 playable races.  So yea, if you want some variety it looks like you'll have to pay for more slots."

However, if you registered the core game between January 23, 2015 and June 16, 2015 and upgrade it by prepurchasing any Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns edition before Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns‘ launch, we will add one additional character slot to your Guild Wars 2 account.   Am I missing something or does everyone who prepurchases HoT get an additional character slot? What is the Veteran Player Appreciation then?  Edit: Yeah, I missed the context.

gamernews,3ar670,Fakeymcfakerstien,6,Mon Jun 22 22:56:40 2015 UTC,The real issue is people who bought it recently and they get refunded for their purchase of Guild Wars 2 so all is good.

gamernews,3ar670,crazyjackal,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:07:33 2015 UTC,"Why? The only reason people want an extra character slot is because they said they would offer one so that nobody has to delete existing characters for the new class.

gamernews,3ar670,crazyjackal,0,Mon Jun 22 23:22:48 2015 UTC,"all I'm hearing from them is that I should wait until they're done with all of their expansion before I buy anything.   Like every other game in the industry? Of course you save more and get a more complete package for a good price 3-5 years down the line. This is standard. You buy at full retail price on release or you wait for sales and bargains months or years down the line.  A character slot with the expansion is a good reward for veterans. They aren't entitled to any special compensation for playing the game for 3+ years. If the expansion was $40, there would be very few bitching even with the core game going free. If the price point is a point of contention for the consumer, it is their prerogative not to make a purchase.  The biggest morality issue with the announcement was when the expansion was announced, they said it required the core game and sold it in sales immediately after, when in reality, it wasn't required since it comes free with the expansion. They have rectified this morality issue by offering refunds to anyone who made a purchase after that statement."
gamernews,3ar670,xandar,9,Mon Jun 22 23:42:24 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point in that they want me (and everyone) to buy the expansion now.  However, while they're offering new players a very good incentive, they're offering veteran players (who I'd argue they somewhat owe their success to) very little incentive.  You're right, veteran players are not entitled to anything, but then neither are game developers.  I am looking at this as a matter of cost vs gain and I'm not seeing my money's worth with what they're offering, as I pointed out already.  That is exactly what I'm talking about in that I think that offering only another character slot for vet players insulting, as it's not much of an incentive."
gamernews,3ar670,Fakeymcfakerstien,2,Tue Jun 23 01:55:09 2015 UTC,"I'd agree that ANet need to give us an incentive to buy the expansion. Technically, the core game is good value at 50 USD, so buying the expansion that includes the core game is good value for new players. For us vets, we've already spent 50 USD (or more) on the core game and ANet need to convince us the expansion is worth it. I haven't pre-ordered either because it's generally not a good idea to do so and we don't know enough about HoT but I think asking for more rewards for loyalty is baseless."
gamernews,3ar670,Keksus_,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:06:47 2015 UTC,"The core game has been on sale for $10, and if they hadn't decided to include it for free with the expansion it probably would have soon settled at that price point.  A character slot costs $10.  Sure, those aren't an equal amount of content, but it no longer feels like veterans are being left out."
gamernews,3ar670,M3cha,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:00:19 2015 UTC,"Sure they're not being left out, but what they're offering (in my opinion) still isn't worth the price of admission."

I'm pretty sure this critique is being made of standard loot/holy trinity/rpg MMOs- I get the vibe that in Eve the items are less like ""loot"" and closer to a commodity."
gamernews,3aqbka,Played_Out_Monkey,10,Mon Jun 22 20:16:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, everything is sellable, tradable and craftable / gatherable pretty much. No nonsense ""bind on equip"" or ""bind on pickup"" there. So items have a long lifespan but are lost through the loss of ships. So as long as Albion has a decay system or a way to perma-lose your items it should be fine. Any sink type will do really. I reckon one based on dying might be fine if the PvP is enough of a high priority. Eve solves this problem by basically making it so that if you want to progress in the game you absolutely have to go out to the full-pvp areas. There is no choice there. If Albion enforces the same thing (eg. you're capped in the safe zones) then it can work just peachy."

gamernews,3aqbka,SoberPandaren,2,Tue Jun 23 14:21:35 2015 UTC,"NPC has a base seeded supply of NPC trade items as well as basic blueprints, etc. and NPC trader bots for those.

gamernews,3aqbka,sirbruce,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:14:26 2015 UTC,I see where you're coming from and the proof will be in the pudding. Depending on how voracious the gatherers are and what kind of base items will be craftable at stations (without training) it may or may not work. I do agree it's a bit ambitious to dump players headlong into this kind of thing. As with any MMO doing things a bit differently it's entirely possible it'll tip over and make the game unplayable. Hope they have a plan B :P

It certainly isn't an inherent problem as you can easily fix such an issue with adjusting the resource acquisition rate/crafting rate/item required interval. A simplistic solution for supply problems would be to lower the resources required for crafting an item, or increase the yield when crafting.   The very nature of supply and demand and localized shops is what drives the economy. When supply is less than the demand that's how you make your money as a crafter."
gamernews,3aqbka,VGGnome,-1,Tue Jun 23 02:59:39 2015 UTC,"The problem is inherent because it becomes unrealistic and unfun.  When the number of suppliers is low (the inherent problem), increasing output for each supplier doesn't solve the issue; instead you simply cause wild price swings caused by the ease at which one can ramp up production from one good to another.  There are other problems, too; an economist could explain them to you better than I.  All I know is I've spoken to economists on this issue who've studied MMOs and they are all in agreement regarding the instability of a purely user-created economy."

In the very very early days, crafter was a seperate class, and one of the most popular, but they wrapped it in so that every class could craft everything, you just had to get the skill in whatever you wanted to craft.  It worked really well, until they decided that they'd take out the element stones from the drop tables, and sell chests that gave them on the item store for RMT, at which point the economy just collapsed in a few weeks, they tried to patch it with bandaids, but everything they did just made it worse and worse.

gamernews,3aqbka,SoberPandaren,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:17:09 2015 UTC,I'm fairly confident that the finer details will be lost on your average consumer. They're just gonna see the same old 'magic and elves and swords' of the game and write it off as another 'me too'.  Especially when it's main selling point is copying an old game. The gaming industry is turning into the movie industry with the habit of just striving to remake stuff from 20 years ago instead of taking risks and trying new things.

gamernews,3ao5vn,KadenTau,22,Tue Jun 23 02:56:44 2015 UTC,"I received Bientôt l'été in a bundle many moons ago. The premise sounds artsy and nebulous. Sadly, before I could ever experience it, the game crashed  ... on every computer I have in my house.   But I will say that The Graveyard is a fine digital art piece given it's creation back in 2008. Is it an experience worthy of $5USD? I bet few outside of the art world would agree with that price.  That brings me to my point on Tale of Tales, their issue isn't the titles themselves it's how they show them to the public. If The Graveyard was installed in Bitforms or the Guggenheim's interactive section, there would be a crowd of people fully willing to take in the spectacle as intended but install the same system into a gamestop and you'd just get stares. Is it a difference in education? Maybe. Is it a difference in context? Completely.  By having their experimental titles available on steam/android/itunes, Tale of Tales set up the scene for a cruel incident where consumers felt that they've been tricked.   Selling art/entertainment successfully is all about context and in the realm of interactive experiences, I feel developers are putting their wares into the wrong store.   There is a place for software like this, I just don't think Steam is it."
gamernews,3ao5vn,EnterSpacePearl,4,Mon Jun 22 06:40:15 2015 UTC,"Selling art/entertainment successfully is all about context and in the realm of interactive experiences, I feel developers are putting their wares into the wrong store.   There aren't that many platforms for distributing interactive experiences though. That leaves developers with few option. They can either try to sell through their own store and reach only a tiny but interested audience that already knows them or try to find a larger audience by being on a platform with an enormous user base like Steam with the risk of disappointing a portion of that audience. It's not an easy choice i reckon.    Better curation and categorisation on existing platforms might go some way to fix that problem."
gamernews,3ao5vn,arrayofemotions,4,Mon Jun 22 14:43:14 2015 UTC,"Better curation and categorisation on existing platforms might go some way to fix that problem.   This, using patreon and kickstarter properly, and scaling the game properly.  $20 is more than I would pay for a non-AAA FPS or RPG. $5 is about how much I would spend on a 2 hour walking simulator. whose game mechanics can be summed up in 100 lines of code.   Use kickstarter/patreon to minimize risk, find the right balance between design and retail price, and personally engage your audience.  Tales made a lot of money via kickstarter and also make money via patreon, but are sad because they didn't get enough sales -- They shouldn't need sales, they're in the black thanks to their donated income.   They made a game that looks and plays like a budget Gamecube title and then charged a top tier indie game prices for it, as if that was going to seem reasonable to anyone who wasn't already a fan.  They went out of their way to actively insult gamers and gaming in general to try to earn hipster artist cachet, which meant that a lot of people who knew about them didn't like them.  They may have coded a decent game, but everything from a marketing or business perspective was terrible."
gamernews,3ao5vn,vonmonologue,12,Mon Jun 22 17:17:56 2015 UTC,"Never heard of the game. I am not their audience; I don't play adventure games unless they are extremely high rated and recommended, though I do own a few through GOG like Primordia, Dreamfall, and Gray Matter.  Here's what else it has going against it, for me personally;   Boring, retro trailer. Is any of this gameplay? I cannot tell. 5 reviews that loaded on Steam are negative, combined with 73 metacritic. The color pallet looks interesting, and I can forgive simplistic graphics, but what's up with the 5 different fonts used in the Steam screenshots? it doesn't look well designed from a type / graphics perspective. It's just off putting.

gamernews,3ao5vn,calabhan,17,Mon Jun 22 03:15:46 2015 UTC,"The Path may be their most approachable and possibly most ""gamey"" experience.  You play as one of 6 (or 7?) sisters, one after the other, trying to get to grandma's house in the woods. Each girl is taking on the Little Red Riding Hood role.  With each girl you find things in the forest that are relevant to her personality and what defines her as a woman. Playing as the youngest sister has a much different feel than playing as the older ones.  You can find each girl's ""wolf"" in the forest, which makes it kinda scary because you don't know what you're going to find. You might find a literal wolf, or you might find a lumberjack dude implying he's looking for a hookup.  Then when you get to grandma's house you get a very creepy and trippy sequence that is unique to each girl.  As all this is happening you're wandering through a beautiful, dreamy forest that feels very ominous... Kinda gave me the same feels as watching Labyrinth or The Dark Crystal as a kid  And the soundtrack is just... Haunting. It's a sort of lullaby melody that sounds almost cheerful but has very unnerving undertones to it.  The game has only one rule: stay on the path.  Don't listen to it. Explore the forest.  I would highly recommend checking it out."
gamernews,3ao5vn,solarnoise,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:43:44 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of The Path, but I feel like you just spoiled the experience a bit by explaining it. The best thing about the game IMO is that the player has no idea what to expect."
gamernews,3ao5vn,WildlifeAnalysis,2,Mon Jun 22 21:33:04 2015 UTC,"Well. The problem is that not enough people are buying the games, and as noted their marketing is very vague/weird so I doubt people are going to be compelled to buy it just based on the Steam page.  I do agree with you I just figured if some people resonate with a no-nonsense description of the game as explained by a peer on reddit maybe they'd give the game a shot and help Tale of Tales stay alive."
gamernews,3ao5vn,solarnoise,8,Tue Jun 23 03:28:39 2015 UTC,"That's a hard call. Again, these are very artsy and not for everyone. I've played The Graveyard, Bientôt l'été, and Luxuria Superbia. The Graveyard is just walking an old lady through a graveyard, simple but not really fun. But you can play it for free. Bentot is very open ended, walking along a beach finding things sometimes and interacting in a strange chess game with conversation. Really weird one but visually interesting. Luxuria is essentially a simple tapping game, probably best for mobile. Not much too it but interesting music and a strangely sexual backdrop to the game. I liked it but it gets repetitive after awhile. Really, I can say that each game is worth trying but certainly not worth buying for everyone. I'm weird and I love my art games and walking simulators, but this was not a company that made accessible games. Give everything a look though and do your own research. That's all I've got"
gamernews,3ao5vn,blitz0x,8,Mon Jun 22 03:37:35 2015 UTC,It doesn't sound like they were even aiming for commercial success based on your descriptions.  Experimental and artistic games are fine if they're better designed for appeal and accessibility.

Everything written screams to be about money, and poor decisions.    So we studied theirs and figured out how to make our next project more accessible.    +   Because whatever we enjoy is never, ever, what the gaming masses enjoy.   +   We studied successful games and applied our findings to the design of Sunset.    Basically they were trying to manufacture a success, instead of making something from the heart. This shows. It's a subtle thing that resonates with people when they play it, or see it. Heart matters, and people can tell when it's lacking.  Oh, and WTF...   In the end, we spent more money than we had on the production of Sunset. Because we wanted to make it really good and reach a wider audience. Compared to the ambitions we had for the game, the extra $40,000 seemed like a relatively small sum. “Surely we can make that amount back in the first month of sales!”   You expect us to cry for you because you spent money you didn't have, to make a game with no heart, that appealed to the masses. Pffftt. Good luck with that one.   A small group of people clearly deeply appreciates what we do and we curse the economic system that doesn’t allow us to be pleased with that.   Blame yourselves. Don't blame mathematics when you can't add properly.  You expect people to pay $20 for a 3 hour game that was made for the sole purpose of making money? Not gonna happen. To The Moon is $10, the same length, and a much better experience. Other similar games are cheaper than $20, with better experiences."

gamernews,3alrw0,Nicknin10do,11,Sun Jun 21 16:48:30 2015 UTC,"This is exactly it. The thing is, I'm hitting my data cap largely because my girlfriend watches a lot of Netflix and Hulu. I think it's fucked up and anti-competitive that Comcast can effectively prevent me from using streaming services (which are in direct competition with Cable providers like Comcast) by imposing a fucking ridiculous data cap."
gamernews,3alrw0,superbaconturkey,13,Sun Jun 21 17:46:35 2015 UTC,"FWIW, we had this problem at my house until recently. I found this page, which notes that the highest definition content from Netflix (their ""Ultra HD"") comes in at as much as 7GB per hour.   The thing is, though, (at least if you're streaming on a PC) Netflix will automatically give you the highest possible definition video for whatever you're watching even if your display is not capable of displaying videos that are that high def.   In other words, even when you're watching on your ancient 1440x900 crappy laptop monitor, it will give you Ultra HD 7GB/hr video, wreaking havoc on bandwidth caps.  Follow the advice here (also in the link above) to reduce your default bandwidth settings:    To select a setting that works best for your Internet plan, navigate to the Your Account page and select Playback settings in the Your Profile section. It can take up to 8 hours for these changes to take effect. Restricting data usage may effect [sic] video quality while watching Netflix.   Also, before you think ""meh, I'd rather watch everything in HD anyway,"" realize that even if you lower your bandwidth usage settings you can still get HD in most cases! It just won't be supermegaultraHD and savage your data caps.   Since making this simple change, my house has gone from using 500+ GB/mo to routinely staying under our 350 GB cap. I still abhor Mediacom for making these measures necessary at all, and I still think bandwidth caps are shit in practice and in principle, but hey, there's ways to get around the bullshit."

But beyond that, he's with them because there's likely no other choice. The government has regulations in place that prevents cable companies from competing with each other. There aren't really any markets that Comcast, Time Warner, AT&T, Verizon, etc have to compete with each other so prices stay high and consumers don't get to choose the best provider."
gamernews,3alrw0,Bossman1086,4,Sun Jun 21 16:52:14 2015 UTC,"Not a human right, but a consumer right. In europe, there's a shitton of providers to pick from. Governments making laws prohibiting/impeding competition is pretty retarded and anti-people."
gamernews,3alrw0,koeleskab,0,Sun Jun 21 17:06:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I got things mixed up here. It's local (mostly State and town) governments that are blocking competition. Mostly in the form of exclusive deals with said providers.   But regardless, while I think that providers should be able to do as they'd like with the networks they own (as long as they're not committing any fraud or breaking contracts), I agree that the situation sucks.   Governments making laws prohibiting/impeding competition is pretty retarded and anti-people.   Couldn't agree more. Because without this crap, Verizon, Time Warner, Comcast, et al would be forced to compete with each other. That means prices would come down and speeds would increase out of necessity. And while they'd be able to have data caps, if they did, a competitor could offer service without them. Competition in the market keeps companies honest and innovating."
gamernews,3alrw0,Bossman1086,2,Sun Jun 21 17:19:28 2015 UTC,Government regulation doesn't keep competitors out.  The extremely high barrier of entry is what keeps them out.  No one is going to spend billions of dollars laying out lines and spend the next 10-15 years trying to break even on ROI.  You have to undercut the incumbent's prices and market like crazy just to steal customers from the incumbent.  All the while the incumbent has already paid off their lines and have economies of scale so their cost of operations is much lower than yours.
gamernews,3alrw0,sonicmerlin,2,Mon Jun 22 00:25:28 2015 UTC,"Government subsidies were given to companies for laying infrastructure around the same time when local governments signed some of these first deals. The combination of the two ensured no companies would ever have to compete with each other.    No one is going to spend billions of dollars laying out lines and spend the next 10-15 years trying to break even on ROI. You have to undercut the incumbent's prices and market like crazy just to steal customers from the incumbent.   No? It's already happening in select markets with Google Fiber and Verizon FiOS. Sure, it's a slow process, but it takes a lot to undo the crap caused by shitty legislation that the cable companies lobbied for years ago. And there's a reason they did...it prevented competition."
gamernews,3alrw0,Bossman1086,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:28:58 2015 UTC,That's interesting. Which laws are preventing cable companies from competing with each other?
gamernews,3alrw0,Zeno84,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:03:11 2015 UTC,They aren't specific laws. It's a combination of some regulations/subsidies that cable companies lobbied for a while back from the Federal government plus exclusive contracts they've signed with local and State governments that says those governments can't allow any other cable companies in to the area.
gamernews,3alrw0,Bossman1086,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:55:22 2015 UTC,Why was Verizon FiOS allowed to come in my area and offer an equally mediocre service to Comcast if Comcast has an exclusive contract?
gamernews,3alrw0,Zeno84,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:13:44 2015 UTC,"Because there's a loophole in most of those contracts right now that doesn't count fiber networks as competitors. It's also why Google was able to come in to a few markets with their Fiber service, as well. Basically, the contracts only prohibit other cable providers from servicing that area because at the time, the choices were only that or DSL."

As far as I can tell, most of the patch is just DLC support. There are a few performance improvements, but the game already runs at a solid 30fps without hardly any drops on console. Rocksteady is well known for being great at optimization, console and PC."

gamernews,3alrw0,t4nt4lus,4,Sun Jun 21 23:29:06 2015 UTC,3.5GB patch for a 35GB install isn't much.
gamernews,3alrw0,Saith_Cassus,3,Sun Jun 21 23:07:22 2015 UTC,Is there a reason we can't download these patches before release?
gamernews,3alrw0,t4nt4lus,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:55:16 2015 UTC,You might find a way to do this for PC. For PS4 I believe you have to trigger ownership before you can download a patch. This usually involves full installation to the console and playing online. I doubt the patch will be added to the install package for people buying digital copies. It would probably require the same trigger of running the game for the first time while online.  I'm not sure how XBO manages patching and ownership.
gamernews,3alrw0,Wonka_Vision,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:24:34 2015 UTC,"It's the same for Xbox One. You have to have ownership of something before you can download the patch for it. It would be cool if it wasn't the case, but oh well."
gamernews,3alrw0,megatom0,24,Sun Jun 21 20:08:27 2015 UTC,"This has become the norm.  Rush games, get as soon as possible to release, finally ship something half assed, by the time you get the Blu-Ray or DVD or whatever, 4 gigs worth of patches are already in the pipeline waiting to be downloaded...  Remember when games came on a cartridge and they were either perfect or they wouldn't even work?"
gamernews,3alrw0,t4nt4lus,38,Sun Jun 21 23:40:36 2015 UTC,"The game was delayed for nearly a year as Rocksteady worked to finish it with quality rather than a rushed release. I realize that's a huge patch, but I have faith in the quality.   Still, a pre download to prevent overloading come launch day would be nice."
gamernews,3alrw0,runtheplacered,2,Mon Jun 22 11:39:05 2015 UTC,"I agree, I don't mind delays if they value quality.  I'd rather wait and get something good.   Hopefully it will be available for pre-loading."
gamernews,3alrw0,brlito,24,Sun Jun 21 18:43:20 2015 UTC,I think modern games are a lot more complicated.
gamernews,3alrw0,t4nt4lus,11,Mon Jun 22 06:55:18 2015 UTC,Completely illogical! They are only like 10000x the size of games from the NES/SNES era..... /s
gamernews,3alrw0,FallingSnowAngel,-1,Mon Jun 22 13:38:39 2015 UTC,"It could be argued that we have better tools, more powerful hardware, more complex and sophisticated engines to design with and hence making games isn't more complex than what it used to be.   I would argue that it has gotten even easier to make games, their difficulty comes with the scope and ambition of the project.    Look at Call of Duty, we get a nice looking game of COD every year... Do you think it's hard for them to make Call of duty? I don't. If it was so difficult because of how complex games have gotten, then they wouldn't dish them out every year like Xmas presents."
gamernews,3alrw0,FlabGab,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:38:12 2015 UTC,"It takes more than a year to make a COD game, that's why they have more than one developer, alternating releases.  In fact, each game takes three years, hence, three developers putting their games out in a three year cycle.  And hell, that's a game that's iterated on and it still takes that long.  I don't think this example proves what you set out to prove.  Games are absolutely, far more complex than it ever has been before to develop.  I honestly had no idea anybody could even think otherwise."
gamernews,3alrw0,t4nt4lus,10,Sun Jun 21 14:46:02 2015 UTC,I'd rather take a game with a 4GB patch that's trying to fix things than a cart that doesn't work.
gamernews,3alrw0,bagboyrebel,7,Sun Jun 21 14:48:48 2015 UTC,"You totally missed the point.   You paid for a game, one complete package. And it worked OOTB... And that was the end of it.   Now we pay for half made software, that you hope will get completed even after you've finished playing. (BF4 anyone?)  I can't wait till this game is released. And fixed by a couple of patches, then finally I might get to play the whole thing 😊"
gamernews,3alrw0,t4nt4lus,23,Sun Jun 21 15:25:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but we had a really loose definition of ""working out of the box""."
gamernews,3alrw0,bagboyrebel,15,Sun Jun 21 20:38:37 2015 UTC,So the moral of the story is... Don't pre-order?
gamernews,3alrw0,Brendly,2,Sun Jun 21 22:34:03 2015 UTC,"Well, I think a lot of people on reddit agree on the fact that not pre ordering games might send the right message...  My experience with BF4 was certainly not good, it made me not want to buy Hardline, it has made me very skeptical of Battlefront. I hope it turns out to be an awesome game. But my past experiences tell me that I should wait before preordering and buying too soon."
gamernews,3alrw0,t4nt4lus,13,Mon Jun 22 13:59:44 2015 UTC,"PC games have had patches for years before this strange anti-patching mentality came out. Software development is hard and you're pretty much never going to have a bug free product. Shit happens and sometimes you don't find a bug until after you print the physical copies of the game, so you have to patch it."
gamernews,3alrw0,bagboyrebel,5,Sun Jun 21 14:40:19 2015 UTC,"As a developer, and former Automation Tester I am aware of bug free code being impossible.  But to have 0day 3gb patches screams of rushed products.   Like I said, I don't mind waiting for quality software. But this is not always the case. (I'm not referring to Batman necessarily)  Take Destiny for example. The amount of money for development was almost a quarter of the total budget, most of it went to marketing.   Now you tell me if that is something you find you agree with. I certainly don't."
gamernews,3alrw0,weareyourfamily,6,Sun Jun 21 14:45:29 2015 UTC,"Take Destiny for example. The amount of money for development was almost a quarter of the total budget, most of it went to marketing.   I'm not sure what that has to do with anything here. Destiny has had a good share of problems, but buggy software isn't one of them."
gamernews,3alrw0,wiredfire,3,Sun Jun 21 15:01:38 2015 UTC,It doesn't. A good chunk of Reddit just hates Destiny and will find any reason to shoehorn how terrible they think it is.
gamernews,3alrw0,bagboyrebel,2,Sun Jun 21 15:25:31 2015 UTC,"Bugs aren't everything. What about gameplay?   Destiny had so much potential, and while I agree that it's not buggy per say, it could have been a much better game.   I will try and find another redditor's post about what he thought destiny could have been if more time had been spent on it and more money. Instead of it being rushed into release. It had so many good ideas, and they wouldn't have been too hard to implement. But due to the lack of time, it came out the way it is now, a good game to play, but with so much more potential."
gamernews,3alrw0,wiredfire,2,Sun Jun 21 17:34:24 2015 UTC,"I will try and find another redditor's post about what he thought destiny could have been if more time had been spent on it and more money   This is just what someone thinks and is no indication of a rushed game.  Now to be fair, there is plenty of evidence that Destiny is very different than what was once intended. But again, there is no evidence that this is due to rushing the game out."
gamernews,3alrw0,megatom0,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:16:02 2015 UTC,Lack of content is just the other side of the same coin. Don't deliver me half assed content... very simple concept.
gamernews,3alrw0,weareyourfamily,4,Sun Jun 21 17:28:34 2015 UTC,For me there's a bigger problem. What happens when in maybe 15 or more years when I fancy playing that game again but haven't got access to the patch? All I have is a disc with half complete code. The lack of quality control in big parts of the games industry is matched only by the fans willingness to turn a blind eye and justify shoddy workmanship.
gamernews,3alrw0,t4nt4lus,2,Sun Jun 21 17:31:53 2015 UTC,Patches have existed since PC gaming was really a thing.
gamernews,3alrw0,runtheplacered,2,Sun Jun 21 17:42:44 2015 UTC,"Aye, just not day 1 patches to make the game actually work properly. They tended to be tweaks and improvements rather than something to fix a product that was shipped broken ;)"
gamernews,3alrw0,HugoWeaver,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:48:32 2015 UTC,"Well if you were a PC gamer at this time the situation was much much dire. If you were wanting an updated version you would have to download the patch over 3 hours with your 28k modem, which would cost you around $20 because you paid by the minute. Or you would go from store to store looking to see if they had the newest version that had the update that made it compatible with your gamepad/soundcard/graphics driver/modem/joystick. I also remember sending a floppy disk to get a patch copied on it and sent back to me through the mail, which took about a month to complete.   I will say that I did not have to do this with many games, most worked fine OOTB. The most trouble I had was with soundcard compatibility on my Windows 3.2 computer.   With PC there has always been variables and weird system configurations that aren't necessarily accounted for. This is for the most part handled a lot better today."

It was originally going to release in Fall 2014, then it was delayed until early June, then it was delayed again to the current release date. They probably for saw this current outcome and decided to use those extra couple weeks after the game went gold to make a day one patch to try and fix the issues it has."

gamernews,3alrw0,SheeEttin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:03:59 2015 UTC,"Cartridge games still got updates occasionally.  That's why you can find ROMs that are 1.0 or 1.1, etc., and they usually fix bugs that they didn't catch originally.  Games were much smaller and simpler back then, but they still had issues.  You can find a lot of bugs and such that never got fixed for a lot of games.  To say they shipped something half assed is absurd too.  Plus the game was already delayed quite a while, they definitely put a lot of work into it since then, and the patch shows they put a lot of work into it even after they started producing copies, and they're going to keep putting work into it for future patches probably.  I personally don't see 3.5GB as something monstrous either.  The game itself is about 34GB.  If you still have archaic internet and that's your reason for complaining, that's not their fault either."
gamernews,3alrw0,bubblebooy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:01:27 2015 UTC,"True, very true.   And I don't want to come off as critical to the dev's behind Batman. The game looks incredible.   But the fact that this has become the ""norm"" applies to most developers, and not ALL of them delay the game to release a more polished product.   I applaud what they did, announcing that they would be delaying it since very early in development was more honest than what other companies do.   edit: words"
gamernews,3alrw0,Cley_Faye,11,Mon Jun 22 14:02:42 2015 UTC,I would much rather deal with a large patch at the beginning than several minor patches throughout the game's rollout.

TOR's problem really wasn't the story or gameplay, it was the lack of content which can only be made up with time. Same problem as all new MMOs. It also suffered from bugs and balance issues but in general it didn't fire off because it didn't offer anything new.  Outside the theme and story the gameplay is exactly the same as WoW so unless you've got mates playing or really like Star Wars there isn't much point to play it."

gamernews,3acz2p,MikeyJayRaymond,8,Fri Jun 19 02:38:35 2015 UTC,"From the article:   So it's a very big game [that] we will keep updating. It's $60, no dollar more, no DLC or microtransactions or stuff like that. You will buy it and you will have entertainment for a few months on top.   They're also be relesing weekly content:   We haven't really decided yet what will come out at what point in time but I can promise you that it will be a very big release on day one... ...What we can tell people is that we will have content coming every week. There will be an event every week and people can actually engage right away"

gamernews,3acz2p,pie-oh,3,Mon Jun 22 22:39:14 2015 UTC,Oh. Of course. I agree with you.
gamernews,3acz2p,drunken_on_whiskey,3,Mon Jun 22 22:50:19 2015 UTC,"The risk with this I suppose, is the same as buying a season pass for an episodic game. You don't know if the next instalments will be any good, you're just buying it based on reviews of the initial content. Only differences are there will be more content and a higher price."
gamernews,3acz2p,gk3coloursred,4,Sat Jun 20 14:23:32 2015 UTC,No doubt I will have fun playing HITMAN :D as I had a lot of fun on the older versions !
gamernews,3acz2p,drunken_on_whiskey,3,Sat Jun 20 18:07:33 2015 UTC,But if they release a proper full game surely it's more like getting a regular game with a free season pass.  You may or may not play the extra DLC content - but it's there and will cost nothing extra to you.
gamernews,3acz2p,gk3coloursred,3,Sun Jun 21 21:41:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, but from my understanding of this game they are releasing a small portion of the game at launch, then additional parts as the months roll on. This is the same release structure as Telltales episodic games, or life is strange etc. I'm not suggesting that it will be bad, just each portion they release is going to be judged on its individual merits, not as a whole like a normal full priced release. They have to keep the quality up or people will be complaining."
gamernews,3acz2p,on_with_disease,2,Mon Jun 22 09:51:43 2015 UTC,"Ah OK, having reread about it I'd say the situation is between our two lines of thought but closer to yours than mine.  Executed correctly [pun intended] it ought to be great for fans of the series, though those who like to blast through a game may feel a little frustrated by having to wait for some/much of the content if they buy in early and digitally."
gamernews,3acz2p,gk3coloursred,2,Mon Jun 22 23:17:40 2015 UTC,"I take what they say at face value, so how it's worded seems odd to me. Missions and locations may be free, but there's not a single AAA game that doesn't have DLC. I can see weapons, outfits, stuff like that costing some money. Which in and of itself wouldn't be bad or the first to do so, but if the free content doesn't expand on those things, using the same core set of weapons for every single mission may grow tiresome."
gamernews,3acz2p,xenopunk,2,Sun Jun 21 20:47:22 2015 UTC,"Or they saw the shitshow that was Evolve and decided to go the opposite way for good press as well as to reward those who kept playing their game.  If you can keep people playing your game and enjoying it they are more likely to buy the next game.   It also keeps the game getting mentioned on gaming sites each time additional DLC is launched and this will no doubt drive continued sales way beyond the normal pattern.  To only give a cut-down range of weapons in order to do paid-DLC on them would be shooting themselves in the foot.  Another point to consider is that while the cost of additional DLC creation is not to be discounted it is low compared to the cost of getting the initial game made, promoted and distributed as distribution will be digital, the game engines are finished and a lot of the objects/maps etc have already been created."

gamernews,3acmg0,SandoM,3,Fri Jun 19 21:17:53 2015 UTC,"What do you guys think about the improvements they made on lethal combat? I feel that in contrast to stealth gameplay, they've added a whole lot more spectacle to it but relatively little substance (at least, judging from the gameplay video). The whole shooting exploding blades that stick people to a wall, high speed dashing into enemies, and so on.   I like the utilization of the ""see through walls""-mode , and even the one that slows down time as it provides utility in unique ways (although the ideas behind these systems are anything but unique). The projectile arm blades.. not so much. Although with the destructible cover, Adam's enhanced movement capabilities certainly give him an edge over his opponents and keep combat exciting."

Jensen in particular, along with numerous other characters, really go over the top with the cheezy-action-movie look. I'm sure many respond to the design - it's probably been focus-grouped specifically for that purpose. But I would agree with /u/Patrick_Batman; it sours the immersion for me as well.  I think HR was a pretty good game overall though, the art direction for Jensen was perhaps its largest flaw, in my view."

gamernews,3acsg0,Edward_Nygma,0,Wed Jun 24 22:34:42 2015 UTC,"Eh im honestly not sure why people are so hyped.  Theyre going to change it so much, the combat will propbably be ripped srtaight from ff13, action button mashy ai controlled party member bullshit.  If they recreated it with all mechanics the same but updated graphics then it would be an amazing game, as it is it will be like the new final fantasies i dont ever bother playing because real time rpg combat isnt at all interesting for me."
gamernews,3acsg0,pok3_smot,3,Sat Jun 20 08:29:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm concerned about this too.  The problem is not that people are ""afraid of change"" or whatever.  The problem is that FF7 was a particular genre, and a core part of that genre was the ATB.  Remaking the game as an action game is not remaking the game at all.  It's more like doing a cover of a piece of classical music in death metal style.  Sure, it can be cool - but it's not the same piece of music.    Action games already exist.  They've existed for years.  Square hasn't done any ""innovation"" by transforming their flagship franchise into a series of action titles.  All they've done is the opposite: killed off what they had, which was original, in order to become another me-too action game.  And frankly, their action games have been pretty lackluster as action games.  I wish they'd pick a style and stick with it and do it well, instead of half-assing everything all the time.  If this comes out with an FF15-style battle system, I'll be passing, despite having looked forward to this game for over a decade."
gamernews,3acsg0,EmergentAtheist,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:55:26 2015 UTC,"Coming from the other side of that argument, I would love to see them change the battle system.

gamernews,3acsg0,anttirt,4,Mon Jun 22 14:35:00 2015 UTC,"In his defense this could be what happens with the game. Not that more modern final Fantasy games don't have their loyal fan base, but personally I have noticed a decline in the purity of the systems in final Fantasy.   Just because something is new doesn't mean it is better or even the same quality as something in the past.  Besides, if it is a remake, as it is in this case,  it is unfair to be critical of his perfectly valid concerns regarding gameplay changes. If it is a remake of a nostalgic classic let people be nostalgic.  I personally think Square Enix would be wise to keep the combat close to the original with modern flair."
gamernews,3acsg0,nuworldblue,9,Mon Jun 22 19:27:13 2015 UTC,In my experience people have a lot of trouble distinguishing between the two. A port is not a remake. An HD version is not a remake.

gamernews,3acsg0,destroy-demonocracy,0,Fri Jun 19 12:38:05 2015 UTC,Wasn't the Honey Bee Inn a part of the cross-dressing sidequest? I'm sure it'll get rewritten or scrapped as some of the scenes there wouldn't fly with a 2015 audience.
gamernews,3acsg0,Clbull,7,Fri Jun 19 15:26:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was a pretty integral part of it, hence why one of the producers telling us to look forward to it seems to suggest it won't be pulled.

gamernews,3acsg0,Sacrefix,0,Fri Jun 19 19:14:28 2015 UTC,no you dont understand. the world being more progressive now then it was when ff7 was released is the reason it would be offensive. unless im mistaken in you saying the world in 1997 was less progressive and it being more progressive today would make it more acceptable.
gamernews,3acsg0,Sand_Scar,3,Fri Jun 19 19:16:02 2015 UTC,You'll have to define your version of 'progressive'.  Cutting scenes that are sexual is not progressive by any popular usage of the word.
gamernews,3acsg0,Sacrefix,-2,Fri Jun 19 19:29:57 2015 UTC,progressive as in being more accepting of other cultures like homosexuality and cross dressing (you know the liberal definition). we will not accept making a mockery of that kind of stuff as much anymore and there is now an outrage culture of support groups.

gamernews,3acsg0,SausageTaste,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:59:05 2015 UTC,"My main concern is that they will make too many changes. What's the point of a REmake if you throw out the parts of the original which made it memorable. Even removing the worldmap would be a dealbreaker for me because it would mean removing the airship and chocobo elements.  To illustrate my position I would draw your attention to all the 'zippers-n-belts' which made Advent Children such a special child. adding to the trouble is the persistent myth that cloud is defined as a whiny troubled soul whose emotional palatte is bland enough to bore actual emos.  If you played the original FF7 you'll recall that Cloud went through a character progression which is typical for most anime inspired heroes:  Stability: confident/stoic soldier type, (Character flaws ignored)  Conflict:  depressed as he discovers his true identity (Character flaws addressed)  Resolution: Confidence and acceptance of self for the final confrontation, or in his own words, ""let's mosey.""  For 90% of the game cloud is not emo.  I will suffer cloud being his new black and buckled self though if they keep the minigames. My greatest fear by far is that they will view the variety of games as 'distracting' from the main plot, or think that they can 'streamline' the gameplay by removing some.  If motorcycle combat, snowboarding, chocobo racing, chocobo breeding, rollercoaster railshooting, marching in step, and cosmo canyon tower defense are gone then it's just another generic modern JRPG, probably with loads of fanservice for female otakus."

But mods are still cool concept they really shouldn't try to fuck up a great thing they have going for them. Because they have some of the only titles out that even years layer people still play and talk about them. That is cool.
gamernews,3acseb,wh3873,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:46:58 2015 UTC,Honest question. What is the big issue with paid mods? Assuming it isn't mandatory all mods be paid for why shouldn't the creators of that mod get some money if they want to ?   I don't think it's a bad option for all the work that goes into some mods. But I might be missing something.
gamernews,3acseb,WhyDoesMyBackHurt,13,Fri Jun 19 11:28:11 2015 UTC,"The objections I heard at the time were varied. People complained about quality. You assume risks of compatibility issues with free mods, both with the game and with other mods. There is no guarantee of support, which is fine if they're free. Refunds can also be an issue when you don't know about a game-breaking save-corrupting conflict until a month after you bought it. Also, mods can be a community development. You take a resource from one mod, one from another, tweak them and make your own modifications. Do they get credit? Provenance of resources could make fair compensation a huge issue which could stifle sharing amongst the community. I think most of the issues were implementation concerns like these rather than blanket claims of entitlement."
gamernews,3acseb,MehraMilo,9,Fri Jun 19 16:03:47 2015 UTC,"What is the big issue with paid mods?   For me, it's this: Bethesda releases buggy games, and then modders fix them. That's how it's been since Morrowind, to the point I suspect Bethesda doesn't bother with the ""lesser"" bugs because of the community's pervading ""mods will fix it"" mentality.   I don't mind paying Bethesda for their game, and I wouldn't mind paying the modders directly for something like, say, the Unofficial Skyrim Patches. My problem comes in when Bethesda expects to get paid for the modders' bug fixes too. (Which in the Skyrim debacle they were; remember, modders only got 25% of the profits. The rest went to Bethesda and Valve.)  That's not just double-dipping, it's sketchy as fuck to me. If Bethesda wants me to pay them for bug fixes, then they should actually do some damn QA."
gamernews,3acseb,wh3873,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:32:42 2015 UTC,That's a fair argument and that ratio is really fucked up. That's more of a complaint about a specific implementation of a paid mod system rather than the concept but that's fair.
gamernews,3acseb,pickle182,4,Fri Jun 19 16:02:25 2015 UTC,"Argument number 2: you pay for a mod, then the next patch breaks it. The dev has no obligation to fix the mod and you're out of that money."

gamernews,3acseb,Electrohooker,8,Fri Jun 19 14:15:08 2015 UTC,"The problem with that is that there are a lot of mods that are considered almost necessary to play the game because they fix things that should by all accounts have been fixed in vanilla.

gamernews,3acseb,Zeno84,0,Fri Jun 19 15:26:44 2015 UTC,"Okay, yeah, I admit that's a problem.  I'm merely saying if you can incentivize someone to make a mod for an existing game that adds a whole new scenario to it by paying him, then we could have some very cool mods out there."

There are already lots of simply amazing mods for Skyrim.  Having a thriving and passionate modding community is what helped, and you don't need money for passion.  If money gets involved, that community dies; now everyone is out for the buck, individually, instead of working together with the sole purpose of making the game better.  Mod quality can actually go down.  Just one example is fixing bugs in mods.  Right now most everyone who tries a mod is willing to report bugs they find.  It's no problem, everyone knows its free and somewhat experimental.  But if mods cost money, people will expect a more polished creation, so everyone now needs their own tester.  Just one problem of bringing money into it."
gamernews,3acseb,Zeno84,-1,Fri Jun 19 16:30:07 2015 UTC,"Payment should be an option.  I don't see how a pay system would detract from the people who want to make free mods.

The existence of closed-source didn't stop open source products from having a lot of success."
gamernews,3acseb,wh3873,3,Fri Jun 19 17:09:48 2015 UTC,I hate the phrase entitlement. It kind of minimizes anyone's argument before you get started. Still I mostly agree with you.

gamernews,3acseb,Zeno84,0,Fri Jun 19 14:26:09 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't know how else to put it. You don't think it stems from gamers thinking this is yet another thing they shouldn't have to pay for? Despite that people put man-hours into this stuff.  I would not want that either. But a system where people can get paid for mods when they want to get paid for them is great.  Could you imagine the opportunity for every aspiring developer? Not to mention the increase in quality by attracting really talented people to developing mods for popular games."
gamernews,3acseb,Anzai,3,Fri Jun 19 14:37:41 2015 UTC,"My problem with it is the way I mod. I modded Skyrim by just trying stuff, mucking around, installing one thing and then finding out it didn't work properly and uninstalling it. I ended up finding a bunch of mods that played nice together and set up the game how I liked it, but what I ended up with was only about one in five or six of the mods I actually downloaded.  If I had to pay for them all, I just wouldn't bother. Mods don't necessarily work together, or they change the same files and can't work together. Or, frankly some of them just suck, or theyre good but your system cant handle them. Paying takes out the 'let's try this' aspect of modding a game for fun."
gamernews,3acseb,Zeno84,-2,Fri Jun 19 18:34:25 2015 UTC,"I understand that, but I think if someone wants to get paid for the mod, he should be allowed to.  It's like Apple's app store, Google's Play store--you can go and look for the pay apps, or you can just be perfectly content messing with all the free apps.  My perspective is this: as someone who's a programmer, if I knew I could get money making a mod--for any game--I'd be motivated to make a mod. As it stands, I don't care about the mod community unless something like Black Mesa comes out.  But why would I ever contribute to Black Mesa? Good for the people who did, but if there was a cash incentive, maybe it would have completed on time."
gamernews,3acseb,Anzai,3,Fri Jun 19 18:38:39 2015 UTC,"Look at those app stores as well though. They started using a free to play model in many cases, and then charging for features of the app as you played. Or people just flooded the market with tiny, useless apps to get by entirely on volume. Like that guy who made a bot that just mined Wikipedia and made thousands of apps from that content.  Things like Black Mesa, total conversion type things, fine charge for them, things like 'multiple companions mod' or colour adjustment fix, or turn down frequency of NPC comments as you pass or whatever. A bunch of little things like that, if they were all a couple of bucks to download you end up with developers using mods as a way of not just patching in things that could be considered features. Witcher 3 for example, people complained about HUD options, so they fixed it in a patch, but if someone makes a mod that charges for that, then they may not eve support such things any more. Why bother, and they'd be depriving that modded of income also.  I understand it, but currently modding is just a hobby with people who like that sort of thing, but if you monetize it, you also get all the problems associated with people exploiting the app stores, or P2W mobile games. You kill a community and make the gate on modding even higher than it already was for people who aren't tech minded."

Everything I've seen so far has only excited me more, from trailers to gameplay demos; Hideo Kojima seems to have finally perfected his craft.  An open world makes so much sense for this kind of game, and I do believe that it will make all previous stealth games pale, simply due to the openness of the environments. This will be the new gold standard of the stealth/action genre.  And that's not even touching on the epic nature of this game's story, with Kojima finally getting to tie up loose ends from all the previous titles and show us Big Boss' .  Most of all though, it's the gameplay that's drawing me in. If you want to see more, I recommend checking out the other gameplay demos here and here and join in over at /r/metalgearsolid for the hype train."

I do wonder what happens if you get busted and decide to run for it. How far do they chase you and how to neighboring outposts react?   HA! I'd imagine it would break the game to ""pull aggro"" and have one outpost chase you to the next. I wonder if maybe gamers can force the game to do something that was not intended to happen.

I very politely disagree. It is a stealth-action game, and previous titles rewarded you for essentially being a ghost. Indeed, there may be ""forced"" action sections like other MG titles, but I would bet money on there being a 100% stealth achievement waiting for us :)   Ground Zeroes made it a little tough to judge since the map was relatively small, however, I did appreciate the full force the enemy would dispatch on the higher difficulties, its just that they didnt venture much further past your last known position.   Agreed! Also nice to actually be able to use all those big weapons. Older MG titles gave us tons of guns, but very little places to use them.

gamernews,3ab11n,wildmetacirclejerk,6,Fri Jun 19 06:34:41 2015 UTC,"And so totally unlike his style. He's always had an affinity for over-sexualized women in his games, and it makes sense for the general aesthetic that he's going for. Snake is a man's man, a campy amalgamation of James Bond, Rambo, and a navy seal. All of the games have had this theme, and just because there's a push for inclusions of more realistic female body types doesn't mean that Kojima should change the style that has fit the game for years.   The tits, guns, and violence theme that has ran throughout the series has been commented on in-game by the characters, it's something that the writers have wanted you to be conscious of. It's a statement, not meant to be j-o material for American and Japanese teens to fap to while their PS4 whirrs in the background.   Would it make sense for the character to fit outside of this overall trend in the MGS games? I don't know. I don't know the character's mindset. Maybe the way she dresses is a way of making her feel powerful? Maybe she enjoys the objectification? Who knows. What I do know is that the writers and artists have a much better idea than I do, so I'll trust their artistic judgement when they give a character huge tits."

He says something along the lines of they ""want players who don't have enough time to explore the game world to be able to have the option to get some of the stuff that requires more time."" And to an extent, I get that. You build a game that has hundreds of hours of content, some people don't have time for all of it. I know I sure don't, but why should people like me have to pay more to experience the parts of the game that others won't? Yes, it's optional, but that's their plan for people who want that super awesome sniper rifle, or the lever-action sawed-off shotgun, or the bandana upgrade or whatever it is?  What happened to cheat codes? Cheat codes used to offer this ability, and it was free for the player. There was a lot of nostalgia, plus it could make very difficult games more accessible to less experienced players. Not to mention, 15-20 years from now, someone will want to play MGS5 for some good clean nostalgia, and they wont have their save data. The micro transaction program is shut-down or not supported, so what do they do? They have to play 200 hours to get all the crap they once had? Cheat codes. Most games I've gone back to play much later, I use cheat codes to unlock all the stuff I once had. I'm not looking to sink 200+ more hours into a game like F-Zero GX. I just want to race all the tracks with all the racers.  This is a shameful cash grab, and they are liars for saying it is to give players the option.  TL;DR. Cheat codes are a better option than microtransactions for multiple reasons."

This entry simply allows us to enjoy any part of any map at our will without being bound to the story."
gamernews,3ab11n,BobKipper,-1,Thu Jun 18 17:36:31 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you're being down voted for this. I feel the same way as you do. The replacing of Hayter with Sutherland was the first big red flag, and everything else I've seen doesn't feel entirely like Metal Gear. I will reserve final judgment for when I play the game, though. It does look very solidly made, just not traditionally Metal Gear-ish."
gamernews,3ab11n,Gougaloupe,17,Fri Jun 19 03:14:26 2015 UTC,"The thing is.. Metal Gear was kind of stale. Even though I personally loved 4, it did have some serious flaws. From the looks of it, this game is looking to redefine and revolutionize Metal Gear for the (IMO) better.  As for the Hayter/Sutherland thing.. Sure Hayter did great in the old games, his voice is iconic and loved by many. But let's be real, he's no great actor. Solid Snake was and will always be a straight shooter, the righteous crusader for good. Hayter worked well for that role. Big Boss on the other hand is not so simple to portray, especially for this game, since the character will"
gamernews,3ab11n,versusgorilla,3,Fri Jun 19 07:15:19 2015 UTC,"I will recant slightly and say that, yeah, Metal Gear was a little stale. MGS3 is one of my favorite games ever, but I admit I never played all of Metal Gear Solid 4 precisely for that reason. Still, the open-world design, dialogue options, vehicles, and Assassin's Creed-lite jumping around on the sides of buildings doesn't feel like Metal Gear to me. Those are all great mechanics in other games, and it may be exactly what the series needs. Metal Gear was always a unique experience, but this looks like Metal Gear trying to play catch-up with the rest of the industry.  Hayter's voice was cheese-tactic, and it worked perfectly with the narrative insanity that has been this entire series. It's true he probably wouldn't fit with the tone and character of this game, but how many parts of Metal Gear can be replaced before we stop calling it Metal Gear? It's still Kojima, and it's still a sneaking mission. I'm sure it'll be great, and once I play it I'll learn that love can bloom even on an open-world battlefield. For now I'm going to Grumpy Old Man my way around and say that back in my day, our Snakes were Solid, our Raidens were naked, our Otacons were whiny, and we liked it."
gamernews,3ab11n,Raper-Of-Mars,3,Thu Jun 18 21:27:48 2015 UTC,"I played Ground Zeroes and absolutely loved it. Way more than I did 4. Additionally, well over a decade ago Kojima stated that he wanted to make a game just like this, except the only hardware at the time was the PS2. I am pretty excited to see him follow through with that."
gamernews,3ab11n,Colorfag,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:47:21 2015 UTC,"This honestly feels like complaining just to complain. They're giving us a MGS game where you have the freedom to infiltrate tons of different locations in dozens of different ways, you can finally choose how you do it. No longer will the voice in your ear tell you to crawl through a vent.   One of the best parts of MGS3 was that each environment had an entrance and exit, and in many cases, you were free to choose how you snuck through the environment. This is them doing the same but with a bigger environment and more options.   I mean, you are saying it doesn't feel like a MGS game because you can drive jeeps? You can climb ledges? You could climb ledges in MGS2-4. There were rails scenes where Snake is in jeeps and motorcycles all along. Now we have the ability to play those scenes for ourselves. Not wait until the game decides it's time for a jeep chase.   More to the point, MGS has never been a formula. Every game adds things and takes things away to create a much different game then the last. This game isn't doing that much different from what MGS4 and PW built. It feels like a pretty natural transition to finally make the game open world."
gamernews,3ab11n,BobKipper,7,Thu Jun 18 20:21:37 2015 UTC,"Just curious, what exactly doesn't feel Metal gear-ish?"
gamernews,3ab11n,Colorfag,4,Thu Jun 18 21:02:29 2015 UTC,"It kind of makes sense to some extent.  One one hand, we arent playing as Solid Snake, but Naked Snake/Big Boss. A different voice actor makes sense, as hes a different man. Older, and more weary. Even in MGS4, Big Boss was voiced by a different actor. Solid, on the other hand was still young, even though he aged faster.  The E3 trailer also shows Solid and Liquid as children/teens. Could mean a potential spot for Hayter again (and hopefully Cam Clarke). But I dont know for sure."
gamernews,3ab11n,wildmetacirclejerk,2,Thu Jun 18 21:39:17 2015 UTC,"It makes sense as far as the tone of the game, but Hayter voiced Naked Snake/Big Boss just fine in Metal Gear Solid 3 and the PSP games. Troy Baker said in an interview that the recasting makes sense with context, so I'll wait to play the full game before I get too cranky over it. I just miss Hayter's growly growls."
gamernews,3ab11n,TheNickelSamurai,3,Fri Jun 19 03:57:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, to me I can see why theyd change it. I love Hayter too, dont get me wrong.

gamernews,3ab11n,TheNickelSamurai,0,Thu Jun 18 21:15:06 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem is that since the Phantom Pain was revealed to be MGSV and when we first saw the gameplay at e3 2013, things have changed way too much. The game at e3 2013 looked amazing, it looked like what MGS3 was supposed to be. You're all alone in a massive open world, fending for yourself with minimal support against overwhelming odds of soldiers, driven only by your desire for revenge. It looked like you'd be riding solo the whole time, finding out where your objective is by yourself.  Since then, it no longer looks like what MGS3 should have been. It looks like fucking Peace Walker 2 and is that what we really wanted? Basically the same core game but with prettier graphics? Peace Walker was fine for a portable game, but constantly going through menu's and building up a base doesn't feel like a stealth game, I mean what stealth game makes you literally go after every guard you meet and engage them? Isn't the whole of point of stealth games is that you're supposed to avoid the enemy?  Not only that, but Peace Walker was filled with awful grinding which just shouldn't exist in such a monotonous way in 2015 and it looks like it's returning in Phantom Pain. Don't believe me? They've straight up said the microtransactions exist for those who ""don't have the time to play through this large game"" aka for those who don't wanna die of boredom grinding.  Not only that, but these side characters can apparently be skipped all together and you can still end the game. So Quiet, the so called ""Female Protagonist"" can be completely skipped? So she isn't essential to the story in that case and is simply a gameplay mechanic, and judging from gameplay thus far, an overpowered mechanic.   I'm sorry that I sound bitter/salty as fuck and I am aware of this but I was hyped for this game for 2 years and it has gradually become a game I don't wanna play which makes me really sad. If you still thinks it's good, I don't mean to say you're wrong, I just needed to say this cause it's been bothering these last few months and it only gets worse for me as the game nears release..."
gamernews,3ab11n,Raper-Of-Mars,9,Thu Jun 18 21:36:27 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure you can play the whole game by yourselves without engaging any guards just like the old games, they just seem to be showing off some of the new features they have added. And building a base and having an army makes sense knowing what happens with big boss. After all it's his base and soldiers you fight against in the first metal gear.  And it's also sounds like you're disappointed because its not the game you wanted it to be in your mind. I'm sure every thing that has been added is what Kojima approved to be in it."
gamernews,3ab11n,TheNickelSamurai,-1,Thu Jun 18 21:42:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about the first part. The journalists who played MGSV last month claimed that once Kaz is rescued, the games only objective for a long time is to ""build up the base"" which I feel means acquiring guards. If they did find a way to make it so you don't have to engage the guards, then I'd be very happy.  You are right as well, it does make sense with the story and the founding of Outer Heaven. But the problem is the grinding that is involved in building up this base. I don't believe grinding should ever be a major element to any game (it's part of the reason why I've never liked jrpg's that much) and I feel MGSV will basically be that, busy work of collecting a bunch of boring resources just because the game says you need to. And the way Peace Walker was and their reasoning for the purpose of the microtransactions makes me think that this annoying grinding will be a major part.  Yeah, I definitely am disappointed the game isn't what I had in my mind, I feel most people would be. Maybe it is partly my fault for making these ideas, but at the same time, the gameplay they showed off at the start was very different from the current game, so I can't help but feel a little bit misled from what was originally shown. It was the e3 2013 gameplay as well as what Ground Zeroes was that really cemented these ideas for me. I was kinda hoping that it would become it's own thing, sure it would have been similar in the intended scope of like MGS3 but it still would have been different from everything else, but instead it's nothing more than the a true conversion of a portable game to home consoles using better technology, and I cannot help but feel disappointed, now it just feels like more of the same. And since I didn't care for Peace Walker, that isn't good for me.  Once again, if people still liked Peace Walker and are looking forward for Phantom Pain, that's fine, I'm not hating on anyone, I'm just mad/disappointed in what I guess turned out to be incorrect expectations."

gamernews,3agde9,PalwaJoko,2,Fri Jun 19 22:46:37 2015 UTC,"Huge fan of the first GW. When GW2 released I played it to max level, and felt like the end game content was sort of boring, I admire them taking a different route than the traditional, ""raid, gear up, raid some more"", but I don't feel they replaced it with solid replay value. I beat the world bosses a few times and got bored, WvW got repetitive and boring. Maybe it's just me. I loved the first one because of Heroes Ascent, Underworld and FoW, GvG battles, more guild oriented play.   Glad to see Guild Halls making their way back, we got something that's similar to GvG coming."
gamernews,3agde9,kprodigy16,0,Sat Jun 20 03:49:28 2015 UTC,"solid replay value   I think the way they tried to address this is the living story patches/feature patches. To be honest, it worked. They would release those things and get a huge increase in population as players come back, then it would go back down. It was a pretty nice (though not as good in my opinion) replacement.   We'll have to see how they do it. I'm really interested in seeing how the expansion is seeking to extend its life cycle. Something I've learned from playing the game is that even if the content is really fun or interesting, players won't keep playing it unless there are good rewards with it.   I think the collections and the new mastery point system is something they're trying out to make it easy for them to put new stuff into the game that extends its life cycle."

It seems that ""Vampyr"" is ""Vampire"" in Danish.   Maybe it's related to the plot (haven't found anything in that synopsis), or maybe it's just a ""cool"" way to name the game after all. Also there is an old horror movie with that name."

It's not a Swedish or Danish game, however - neither in one of those languages, nor is the developer in one of those countries.   So it's just a misspelled ""vampire"", where the misspelling is emphasised in the logo.

I fucking loved this game and was the most addictive shooter I've ever played aside from the original Modern Warfare.
gamernews,3a9l2p,Codeine_au,2,Thu Jun 18 20:04:44 2015 UTC,That sniper is gonna be op as fuck on PC.
gamernews,3a9l2p,Sedition7988,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:43:24 2015 UTC,"I'd be more worried about the hammerburst, if I were you. With a mouse that thing can more easily put it's high ass DPS on target at any range. At least the sniper rifle is fairly situational(The other team was bad, probably a bit on purpose or maybe they were new to the game. You get smoke grenades and they didn't use them once to capture territory.).  Don't get me wrong, a good sniper can really hold down an area, but they are nothing you can't deal with with any weapon short of a shotgun. The maps are usually fairly small and focused with plenty of cover everywhere. And in the video 90% of the time they were busy fighting other guys, letting the sniper take his sweet time."
gamernews,3a9l2p,duggtodeath,3,Fri Jun 19 21:02:02 2015 UTC,This is Gears! I dunno what that new shit they showed at E3 was? Some kinda Resident Evil clone or something.
gamernews,3a9l2p,Dunge,2,Thu Jun 18 11:40:49 2015 UTC,"Gears1 is the only one I played because it was already available on PC in the first place. Even with better gfx and framerate, I wouldn't play the same campaign again. What we want are 2-3 and Judgment."

gamernews,3a9l2p,Raffyn,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:49:34 2015 UTC,I don't think you want the following Gears unless you are only in it for the campaign. The multiplayer was progressively worse as each sequel released.
gamernews,3a9l2p,Dunge,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:38:08 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't play Gears for anything other than the campaign. Multiplayer is probably some typical cheap repetitive shooter gameplay, campaign is where the game content is."

gamernews,3a9l2p,th3birdofhermes,0,Thu Jun 18 20:36:45 2015 UTC,I haven't read up on all the changes but I'm hating the way the sniper seems to work now compared to the first. The reticle slowly inclosing on itself instead of the old version being static very much annoys me. I know certain people would like this better but I thought it was supposed to be a complete remake. Also I heard they took away the back flip and sky dive. Yes they are glitches but they added so much to the game when just goofing off. Not sure I'll be getting this.

Both the uberfans and the detractors of this game are just the fucking worst people. Ultra-cynics and fanboys as far as the eye can see.  Guess what! We do have a pretty good idea of what you do in this game! While playstyles will vary greatly from player to player based on whether you wish to spend your time discovering new planets/lifeforms/stars, fighting and allying with various factions, or exploring different planets for their resources, everyone will have the same main goal: Travel to the center of the galaxy. Why? That's not yet made clear. Supposedly it has something to do with ""The Atlas"" (the floating, pulsing crystalline object in the games logo), but beyond that we're not sure, it's just been stated numerous times that the galactic core will be the average players final goal.  Now how you go about doing that is where the game-play loop comes from. Making jumps to other star systems is limited by your ships abilities. So you can't just hop from one star system to the next, you actually have to go down to planets or step inside star ships to trade or collect resources so you can upgrade your ship/suit/gun and venture further in. It is not a pointless meandering sandbox ala Minecraft.  That being said, unlike what the awful r/NoMansSkyTheGame sub fanboys will conjecture about, the game is not going to be minecraft meets spore x1000. It's creature generator is much more limited than Spores, and you cannot build bases or strongholds or space stations because this game is primarily about exploration, not entrenchment.  Does this mean you should assume No Man's Sky is the second coming of video game jesus? No. It also doesn't mean you should cynically assume it's going to be garbage, because thus far every indication has been that it's technically sound, developed by a competent team, and potentially great."
gamernews,3a5mrh,pixel_illustrator,11,Wed Jun 17 17:04:51 2015 UTC,"I haven't really been following development of this all that closely.

I'd really hate to run across the same planet 10 times, but with different colored foliage."
gamernews,3a5mrh,SausageMcMerkin,17,Wed Jun 17 19:31:56 2015 UTC,"They'e spoken about this in-depth actually, I'll link the source if I can find it.  But basically, the generation is done through a seed that is shared across all players. In development terms this is important because it means that you don't have to allocate space to saving ""planet 2398 at co-ordinate X,Y,Z has a red atmosphere, blue terrain, pink water, this list of creatures"", etc etc etc. Instead all of that is consistent across all players games because all of those players share the same seed that ""grows"" into the same planet at those co-ordinates when extrapolated. The only information that is saved is the names of newly discovered data, and (presumably) any destruction you have caused in your game on the planets you have visited.  As for whether the game's planets are going to feel sufficiently different...well... yeah. That's the deal breaker isn't it? From what I've seen, the planets they have shown are decently varied, and Murray has gone on record stating that they are NOT showing off the more alien and bizarre environments you encounter as you get closer to the galactic core, so we've only see the most ""bland"" or traditional environments and aliens that the game can spit out."
gamernews,3a5mrh,pixel_illustrator,9,Wed Jun 17 19:44:34 2015 UTC,"Prepare yourself.  That's going to happen.  Just think of Borderlands, 100 Bajillion guns or whatever they said.  When really, you start to notice motifs and themes, and the same basic aesthetics but one has more ammo and less damage and they count as two guns.  I'm not saying that they won't be interesting, but realistically how many planets could there be? I doubt we are going to see Star Wars level of generalization, but don't expect planets to not share traits."
gamernews,3a5mrh,Mikellow,4,Wed Jun 17 21:33:58 2015 UTC,"While I do agree with you that just about any discussion about this game is complete fanboy or total cynicism I think that is due to the fact that the game on the surface looks very close to a lot of people's dream game. They're also being very vague with the answers to questions that would calm the fanboys that think this IS their dream game and make the cynics accept that the game isn't for them and move on.  This isn't a game that you're going to live in for years. It isn't Eve Online or Minecraft where you're just going to amass resources forever and have crazy space battles with a thriving player driven economy.

gamernews,3a5mrh,X-edOut,3,Wed Jun 17 23:54:35 2015 UTC,"I honestly have no idea what people were expecting from such a small team and from what had been shown/talked about so far. It looks very pretty and I like the kind of experience that they've shown so far regardless of what else is in the game. I'll definitely pick it up. But people expecting rich storylines on each planet or intense massive multiplayer combat, I just don't know where they got that idea from. It seems that peoples expectations ran away from them and it seems totally unfair that people are shitting on this game for possibly not meeting their imaginary goals.   Yes the game was hyped up and propped up by a lot of the game-reporting community and they are slightly to blame too. But if you look at what has been actually shown/promised by the devs I can't see anything contradictory or falsely advertised."
gamernews,3a5mrh,monkeyjay,2,Wed Jun 17 21:08:59 2015 UTC,"I think, anymore, when you are told a game is going to ""change gaming"" and that it's ""revolutionary"" that everybody should remember that they said the same thing about Destiny.

gamernews,3a5mrh,Val_Hallen,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:41:41 2015 UTC,"To think of it, I think what could potentially be awesome for this game is modding support.  They have this fantastic tech which generates infinite universes, but as a team of 10, they can't really add much more on top of that, realistically. But passing on the torch to the modding community could really be a great for them."
gamernews,3a5mrh,Ph0X,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:06:57 2015 UTC,"It looks like a beautiful game but let's be honest, other than the fact that I look like I'm on acid all the time the very description for the game marks it as bland as all the other survival/exploration games already saturating the market.  Sheer beauty will not save a game alone, at least not for very long. A game needs substance as well as style, and until we see more of what this game actually has to offer then I see no reason to put much faith in the devs beyond ""well it looks different"".  Marketing yet another game in the same fashion to all the rest gives rise to the skepticism and frankly, I don't see why it's all that surprising. Steam has so many ""survival"" games it's no longer funny. It's worse than all the Minecraft clones, which doesn't help the games much because most of them incorporate the same fucking concepts.  It might not be garbage but right now there's nothing compelling about it outside the art style.  If you don't like my skepticism stop flooding the market with the same fucking bullshit. The games don't need to be revolutionary but being moderately different would be nice."

gamernews,3a5mrh,HappyBull,3,Wed Jun 17 15:58:06 2015 UTC,The creature stage was my favorite. The problem was it only took you 2hrs to go from cell life to space life and then..... that was it. Now the game is completely worthless since they shut down the creation sharing service.
gamernews,3a5mrh,Agret,3,Wed Jun 17 16:44:44 2015 UTC,"I really liked the cell stage, but you can get through it in about 3 minutes."
gamernews,3a5mrh,Jedi_Outcast,11,Wed Jun 17 20:20:41 2015 UTC,"Basically, it breaks down like this:  Everyone shares the same seed. Everyone who has chosen to play the game online is playing it all together at the same time. This is massively multiplayer on a whole new scale, a scale so large that you will probably never see another human player, but it CAN happen.  The game's universe (or galaxy) is broken up into star systems, and all of those star systems have mysteries, or goals to complete, that will require everyone to cooperate in order to accomplish.  Now, when I say everyone, I don't mean EVERYONE, and I don't mean ""help"" in the sense that they will have to be stood right by your side helpiung you shoot stuff. I mean that if everyone who is playing the game regularly shares their discoveries and shares their wealth with everyone else in the galaxy then it will be much easier for everyone to complete star system's goals. What we get for achieving these goals, or what these goals are, has not been revealed yet, but it has been stated by Sean Murray before that completing these goals will make it easier for us to get to the centre of the galaxy, and that cooperation between players is essential to help this along.  I always get angry when people are like ""BUT WHAT DO YOU DO"". Well, THIS is what you do. You explore the game, and you help each other.  I hope this helps."

gamernews,3a5mrh,chazzlabs,21,Wed Jun 17 15:25:01 2015 UTC,He did mention it during the demo
gamernews,3a5mrh,SnipeyMcSnipe,7,Wed Jun 17 15:30:46 2015 UTC,"So he did, and I actually remember him saying it now.  I think the way he said ""that's where we're all trying to get to"" sounded like some one-off aside comment and not a comment on the intention of the game or the goal of the players.  Had he said something like ""That's the center of the universe, and in it lies a huge revelation about the players' existence"" then I would've been captivated."
gamernews,3a5mrh,chazzlabs,15,Wed Jun 17 15:44:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's probably a goal, but one you can easily ignore completely.  Much like Minecraft's Ender Dragon."

gamernews,3a5mrh,chazzlabs,3,Wed Jun 17 18:21:36 2015 UTC,"Is that a bad thing though? Not every game needs to be a 200 hour RPG, and minecraft showed us that games don't need to have a narrative to be bestsellers. Difference is minecraft is like $15 where as I believe NMS will be $60, so it better be a big ass sandbox."
gamernews,3a5mrh,1v1meinminecraft,3,Wed Jun 17 20:11:57 2015 UTC,"No, I think it's great if someone makes a game that's different than other games and people like it; I just can't see myself being interested in it if I don't walk away from a play session feeling like I accomplished something.  I think Minecraft is a fair comparison in the sense that there's not really a ""goal"", but at least in Minecraft you can be motivated to complete some really grand structure you've set out to build.  If all No Man's Sky has to offer is exploration then I think it falls short.  This obviously ignores what others have said about players being motivated to reach the center of the universe.  I'm reserving judgement on that because I haven't seen much evidence of that."

gamernews,3a8nuy,RangeroftheNight,10,Thu Jun 18 02:35:19 2015 UTC,Guys..... it's.....
gamernews,3a8nuy,CanisMajorisV,6,Fri Jun 19 17:14:06 2015 UTC,I don't know enough.
gamernews,3a8nuy,Seems-Reasonable,2,Thu Jun 18 04:50:39 2015 UTC,"This is the new game from Patrice Desilets, creative director of Assassin's Creed 1 and 2, and his new studio. He mentioned wanting to create moments of gameplay around the first time mankind did certain things, like used fire or weapons.  Sorry I can't tell you more. It's an intriguing premise, and Desilets certainly has given us enough innovative ideas over the years to make this worth following. But, yeah, not a ton of info about this yet."
gamernews,3a8nuy,Gnorris,2,Thu Jun 18 11:47:05 2015 UTC,"Be wary of attributing entire games to their directors, though."
gamernews,3a8nuy,startyourengines,5,Thu Jun 18 12:09:39 2015 UTC,"So they are gonna talk shit about another franchise, but not give any info whatsoever about their own game? What makes this so special?"
gamernews,3a8nuy,Veritasgear,6,Thu Jun 18 05:28:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, don't like when trailers show and talk about something vague then ends without telling what it is."
gamernews,3a8nuy,Satouros,2,Thu Jun 18 06:21:46 2015 UTC,"Well in its defence, it IS called a teaser after all. In caps too.  Its supposed to get you interested in it, not supposed to tell you what the game is about."

gamernews,3a8nuy,EmergentAtheist,2,Thu Jun 18 15:57:06 2015 UTC,The song that they use in the trailer doesn't even go with their concept. At all. It's literally about some dude's friend/lover dying in a hospice.
gamernews,3a8nuy,dancingbaron,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:54:55 2015 UTC,"Teaser my ass. Worst teaser ever! It has literally no info. All it does is criticizes current games and then ""time for something different"" and they go on to credit the song they used in the video. Fuck these people."
gamernews,3a8nuy,Demented_ZA,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:16:02 2015 UTC,It doesn't criticize current games at all. This is being made by some people from the first 2 Assassin's Creed.  It is kind of masturbatory though.... Either way I'm stoked about the idea.

gamernews,3a5mci,Anzai,0,Thu Jun 18 20:35:48 2015 UTC,"This looks like great fun, but the controls still look almost as clunky as JC2. And the controls in that game kept me away from it. Sports cars were useless, no ledge climbing, and so on. For all their talk of fluidity, it still looks like you'd wrestle with these controls a lot. I've seriously only put in about four hours with JC2 since I bought it, because of the poor controls.  Also, seems like they've made even less focus, and the worst parts of the beginning of JC2 were that you just had to cause chaos to even unlock anything else to do. Sure it's fun to blow shit up, but it gets boring quickly without a focus."
gamernews,3a5mci,arelaxedENT,2,Wed Jun 17 19:46:19 2015 UTC,"Weird, I've never heard of anyone having a complaint about the control scheme. Were you useing M$K or Controller?"
gamernews,3a5mci,Anzai,3,Wed Jun 17 21:44:54 2015 UTC,"Xbox controller. It's mainly little things that add up to me. Cars handle very poorly. Sports cars, for example, slide to the point of not being fun to drive. Other cars are better, but they still have massively touchy steering. The parachute is awkward in terms of camera placement, and the grapple is also very annoying in that you want to go to the top of a building, but it grips the wrong thing frequently due to imprecise aiming.  Maybe it's an Xbox problem with a low frame rate or something. Aiming anything, guns, the grapple, or whatever is not smooth at all and seems to have overly large increments when you look around. It doesn't look smoothly. Perhaps 60fps on a PC solves all my issues with it."
gamernews,3a5mci,dorianjp,2,Thu Jun 18 04:03:10 2015 UTC,Well just cause 1 had better.
gamernews,3a5mci,Jonnydoo,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:45:32 2015 UTC,"same, I had no problem with the controls of JC2"
gamernews,3a5mci,StitchTheTurnip,0,Wed Jun 17 22:28:52 2015 UTC,So what's with the camera changes? Those look just awful. Hope they're not a part of the open world.
gamernews,3a5mci,Taiko,3,Wed Jun 17 19:28:45 2015 UTC,"I think it might be that there's a 'cinematic' camera you can switch into, and they were doing that at a lot of the transitions. At least I hope that's the case."
gamernews,3a5mci,coppercable,0,Wed Jun 17 19:34:46 2015 UTC,blown up objects rebuild after you come back to the game... booo.

gamernews,3a3yvk,GiBenny,8,Wed Jun 17 01:19:36 2015 UTC,So this is a Red Orchestra expansion or a new game?
gamernews,3a3yvk,SuperSmith_,5,Wed Jun 17 01:51:33 2015 UTC,It is a standalone-DLC for Red Orchestra 2 like Rising Storm.
gamernews,3a3yvk,snahretep20,4,Wed Jun 17 07:37:40 2015 UTC,"Standalone means RO2 is not required, correct?"
gamernews,3a3yvk,SuperSmith_,4,Wed Jun 17 13:23:31 2015 UTC,"Yes. And when you bought Rising Storm (the expansion), you also got Red Orchestra 2 (the main game), so I don't know if that'll happen this time. It is a bit confusing."

gamernews,3a3yvk,PartyOnAlec,7,Wed Jun 17 06:09:51 2015 UTC,"I loved Battlefield Vietnam (2004) and this trailer looked a lot like that with the combined arms combat.  Obviously its going to be a lot more realistic than the arcade combat of Battlefield but im just happy to see another major FPS game do something other than bloody modern combat. (the day Battlefield goes back to WW2, or vietnam or 2142 etc. is the day i cry tears of joy)."

gamernews,3a3yvk,chrismanbob,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:12:38 2015 UTC,"Its not just futher down, its further down the arcadey side of the spectrum compared to Battlefield Vietnam, let alone Red Orchestra 2.  The only thing good about vietnam games from recent times has been the setting/maybe story, everything else imo has been done terribly. Its about time we got a brutal Vietnam war game. (Men of Honor was bad ass though)."
gamernews,3a3yvk,XXLpeanuts,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:29:55 2015 UTC,I'm curious to see how they balance the more modestly equipped VC. In Rising Storm 1 they did a good job considering the Japanese where mostly equipped with bolt-action rifles compared to the American automatic weapons.  Here rifles are going to be more or less on par but Cobra gunships seem like quite the advantage. I'm guessing much like the trailer and real-life they'll have the terrain and defence advantage.  Unless the helicopters are a call-in and aren't player driven. Maybe that's just how the US reinforcement come in allowing the VC a chance to knock them right out of the sky.  I don't know how it will actually work but I'm excited to see it.
gamernews,3a3yvk,ours,2,Fri Jun 19 16:08:20 2015 UTC,"I think the helicopters are guaranteed call in like arty, there is no way Tripwire have gone and put in flight physics and the rest for this release. (it would be awesome, but it isnt happening)  And you can see how they are balanced from the trailer, the RPG seemed to fuck up the relatively slow flying helicopter."
gamernews,3a3yvk,XXLpeanuts,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:20:28 2015 UTC,If they did add flyable helicopters they would have to be done to the detail tanks and their interiors would be. Yeah I guess that's not quite likely and frankly would be a bit out of place for an infantry game. Tanks at least require strong cooperation with infantry to function in the game and had lots of problems in the initial release of the game.  Maybe we'll get to shoot the M60 on the sides of the Hueys during reinforcements.  Would be an interesting way to balance it out. VC gets tons of waves of man rushing out of the jungle. US has to call in the next wave. Depending on the kind of wave they ask for (cooldown timer balancing things out) they can have gunships to cover the troops.  This may work well to balance while keeping the feeling of the VC being on home turfs and the US being powerful but depending on brittle logistics.  Makes me wonder if spawning only to get shot down in flight won't get frustrating.
gamernews,3a3yvk,ours,9,Fri Jun 19 17:43:24 2015 UTC,At least its not fully modern. I'm happy with a Vietnam setting.
gamernews,3a3yvk,Garand,2,Wed Jun 17 03:06:08 2015 UTC,I could not be more happy about the setting. All i have wanted since Rising Storms release was a more modern setting and this is the perfect middle ground imo. It also happens to be my favorite settings for war games. There isnt much else they can do with the WW2 settings without doing what all the other WW2 games have done before.   The Vietnam settings allows them make yet again the best game in the genre (imo) and I have full confidence in it completely blowing any other vietnam game out of the water.
gamernews,3a3yvk,XXLpeanuts,2,Wed Jun 17 12:28:22 2015 UTC,lol@ the youtube comment saying that it has a Tropic Thunder vibe.

gamernews,3a2c2k,withoutapaddle,11,Wed Jun 17 01:48:51 2015 UTC,The idea of temporary targets is a nice addition - will be interesting to see how that mechanic works. Do you have to pick between certain ones (either A / B) at set times? Is it linked to a server clock so you have to get up at 4am in your real life to take on a contract? Are they just randomly chosen from a pre-existing list that pop up on the contracts list from time to time?
gamernews,3a2c2k,Ukleon,7,Tue Jun 16 19:19:52 2015 UTC,"The way the presenter was talking about it, it seems like there will be new missions announced every week or month or so, and that they'll require an internet connection to download - then you get to attempt to complete the contract exactly once.

There were very few stealth games - thief is the main one that springs to mind. But hitman 1 introduced having to take your time, plot an approach, time it and then act. It looks and probably plays badly now, but when it arrived it was revolutionary.   Thankfully the most recent iteration was brilliant and put it back on track.

gamernews,3a2cjv,Goluxas,4,Tue Jun 16 20:44:52 2015 UTC,"""Masterpiece"" is a bit much. It had wonderful music and an interesting world, but the pacing of the story was jarring and the combat was nothing special. Hiding half the story behind New Game+ didn't do them any favors, either.  I'm interested in Nier 2, but I'd much rather they try to improve on the first game than ignore its flaws and consider it a masterpiece to mimic."

gamernews,3a3uei,GurnningGunners,2,Wed Jun 17 00:42:00 2015 UTC,"So it sounds like the only way of naming creatures and planets is uploading a clip of the planet you're at and stating in the clip what you have named that planet/creature? It sounds like the game is lacking a database of object/creature names. If someone goes to a planet, names a bunch of wildlife, can I then go to that same planet and see what the community has indexed? He said you can add names and information to your encyclopedia, but if other players can't see it, where is the fun in that? I feel like this game is too huge for its own good.

gamernews,3a3uei,grimdeath,4,Wed Jun 17 03:13:11 2015 UTC,"It's a sandbox game. You figure out what you want to do. They've listed all kinds of possible activities:   Exploring (space, planets, caves, oceans, etc) Fighting (they mentioned ""factions"" in the Sony demo) Collect Resources  Trading Etc   There seems to be no main quest. As davidc02 mentioned below, the main quest is to get to the center of the universe. However, the closest I can compare it to is Minecraft. No formal quest system, you're just dropped into an open world you can explore. Except here it's a vast universe (or universes?)"
gamernews,3a3uei,Sabbathius,3,Wed Jun 17 04:46:29 2015 UTC,"What worries me is the seeming shallowness of the experience.  I look at the planets, and I don't see many caves, or mountains for that matter. So it's just what's on the surface, and in the water. You can't dig down, Minecraft-style, or build up. You also can't build a home or a base, like in Terraria, and it seems nobody will be constantly attacking you at night.  Exploring is fine and dandy, but how many randomly-generated planets will you see before you're bored out of your skull? This was done already in Starbound. Except Starbound has many features of Terraria, so there's strong base-building and RPG elements there.  Trading and collecting resources is fine. But at the same time the guy says that all you have is your gun, your armor and your ship. That's it. That's...not much. Pretty shallow. They could have made it a loot-driven game like Diablo series or Torchlight, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  They are also saying a lot of stuff that frankly makes no sense to me. Like, you're exploring and naming a planet, but if you kill too many of the wildlife the protectors show up?! How do they know where to go? Or are you like Columbus ""discovering"" America?  I guess what I'm trying to say is that in theory this is nice and all. But in practice I can see this getting ridiculously boring and repetitive, and worst of all utterly pointless, as time goes on. So far they haven't shown or even discussed any compelling reasons to go exploring, besides just seeing stuff randomly slapped together from a set of parts, and colored randomly. Again, Starbound already did that. And while it was fun to land on a planet with trees that grew eyeballs instead of leafs, after a few dozen planets like that, you kinda go numb to the whole idea. Just like in Borderlands 2 it sounded amazing that the game will have a bazillion guns, until you realize that all this means is that 90% of your loot will be total trash, like close-ranged shotgun with incredibly low accuracy, but fitted with an incredibly powerful long-range scope, just because it's all random."
gamernews,3a3uei,grimdeath,2,Wed Jun 17 17:57:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone can really gauge the amount and/or quality of content until we actually play it. We're all just making assumptions about what it is/isn't until then.  There's this strange assumption I see people making that, because there's a vast (endless?) amount of places to go and visit that there should also be a vast amount of gameplay on launch. At no point has the dev team promised anything like this. This ""hype"", if you will, means a lot of these folks are setting themselves up for disappointment.  Basically the vision in their head won't match the game they end up playing. But who's fault is that? This isn't a Fable-esque situation with the developer (Peter Molyneux) is spitting out lies about what the game contains. The NMS devs, I feel, have been very forthcoming with exactly what you can do, not over promising.  The other things to keep in mind is even IF the gameplay and such is ""shallow"" (as you put it), that doesn't mean it can't grow over time. I don't forsee them dropping the game and halting dev completely. They're a small studio - they will be forced to stop and listen to players requests and complaints and address them as fast as they can. And really, that's all anyone can and should expect.  I just wish people will quit associating ""good"" with a bullet count of how many activities you can do in said game. Quantity and quality are two different things. If you only end up playing the game for 3 hours, but you love those 3 hours, then it's a successful game IMO."
gamernews,3a3uei,Sabbathius,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:14:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, see, I get that. But, for example, they mention you can upgrade your armor, your ""gun"" and your ship. Show that to me! Show me the process of upgrading your armor, gun and ship!   OK, last game I bought, Witcher 3. They said ""you'll be able to craft your armor"". And as they say this, on the screen, they open a crafting window and show you a bunch of schematics for armors and weapons. They say you'll have a sizable talent tree to shape your character into the kind of combatant you prefer. And again, immediately on screen a character panel is opened up, and we see the talent trees, and how they work. This, all of this, is totally lacking in No Man's Sky presentations. If it's in the game, show us!  Now, I can accept that the entire game is like ""Sixth Sense"". That is, simply saying ""Bruce Willis is a ghost!"" pretty much annihilates the entire movie, and also saves 1hr 50mins of your life. But if so, the devs should tell us. I got a bit of this vibe from the part where the dev said that you may encounter another player, and only then realize what your character must look like, because up to now you've been playing in 1st person. And they also said that even so you'll only see the armor, not what's beneath. Which suggested to me that the ""player"" may not be alive, or humanoid, etc., etc. There could be a twist there. I really liked this false-perspective approach in ""Grey Goo"" trailer. But again, if this is going to be a mindfuck kind of a game, tell us in advance. Don't reveal the details, but tell us why you're not revealing details.  As it stands now, there's zero chance I'd be purchasing this. But it would be much, much higher if they were more forthcoming with the information about the game.   I also like that you mentioned Molyneux. But at least with him, you put your bullshit detector on maximum pickup strength, and deal with it that way. He over-promises. We all know that. But when developers can't even describe what the game is, what concrete features it has, or even show them, that's even worse. It feels almost like a tech demo, or downright vaporware."

gamernews,39zl3q,BP_Ray,12,Tue Jun 16 12:55:50 2015 UTC,"I really hope they don't remake the system.   Turn-based 1 weapon, 1 accessory Materia system 3 playable characters, no ""leaders""   If not, I will be very disappointed :l"
gamernews,39zl3q,Lyzern,10,Tue Jun 16 11:57:27 2015 UTC,"It wasn't turn-based. They had the action-time bar, where input was locked until the bar was full, and while making your combat choices opponents could still act.  I would like to see some changes to the combat just to keep things fresh. FF7 combat was pretty dry compared to the newer final fantasy installments. I'm quite fond of of the FF13 combat, despite hating the rest of the game. It would be a good match for this game.  But I agree with your list: 1 weapon/1 accessory is perfect, the materia system was actually very good in terms of stat boosts and spells, as it made the 1 weapon/1 accessory thing work just fine. Also, 3 player characters seems the best fit, as FF13 had that too."
gamernews,39zl3q,TempusFrangit,4,Tue Jun 16 13:12:50 2015 UTC,"You're right, it was atb; that's the kind of combat I like. FF8's is my favourite in the series"
gamernews,39zl3q,Lyzern,0,Tue Jun 16 13:27:22 2015 UTC,"I really liked the paradigm shifts introduced in FF13, because your fighting style really changed along with it, even during a single combat encounter. For bosses this was really nice, because as a boss changed modes you could 'shift your paradigms' to best oppose your opponent's strategy. Such a system won't fit with FF7 unless they fundamentally change how the materia system and leveling works, though.  I'm curious what they come up with, because I doubt they're going to implement the exact same combat system. It's a large part of the game, and just using the old system wouldn't really justify a remake."
gamernews,39zl3q,TempusFrangit,0,Tue Jun 16 14:11:00 2015 UTC,"I like FF13 as a game (The linearity makes me not want to play it as much though); and the fighting style really is innovative, but it's not my cup of tea. I like being able to have full control over my characters and what they do, even if it means making the combat slower."
gamernews,39zl3q,Lyzern,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:56:17 2015 UTC,Still considered turn based.
gamernews,39zl3q,radclaw1,3,Tue Jun 16 13:58:08 2015 UTC,"No, because for it to be turn-based there actually have to be turns. This system ensures that you can act only when the bar is filled, but since your opponents can act without having to wait for your action to be executed or even selected there is no turn order."
gamernews,39zl3q,TempusFrangit,2,Tue Jun 16 14:03:04 2015 UTC,Well. You can turn it to wait instead of active which pretty much makes it turn based.
gamernews,39zl3q,atriax,9,Tue Jun 16 18:25:16 2015 UTC,"I'm excited a hell for this but also terrified because so much can go wrong. I mean, let's be honest, despite being revolutionary for the 90s, a good chunk of the script just doesn't hold up very well compared to the caliber of modern game writing. Plus part of the charm of FF7 were all of its awkward translation errors and weird dialogue, so I'm interested to see how they will execute that.  All of the weird quirks that made it so lovable will probably have to get nixed to make it palatable for the new generation of gamers (i.e. the squatting contest).   So here's hoping for the best but I'm crossing my fingers that it will be a huge success."
gamernews,39zl3q,lilkuniklo,6,Tue Jun 16 07:55:38 2015 UTC,"For me, FF7 carries a lot of nostalgia. Back then it had amazing graphics that were simply unseen before. Combining the 3D with the sprite backgrounds made the game incredibly atmospheric as well.  This is why I'm not a big fan of a remake, because I'll never look as fondly at the new game as I do at the old game. There's nothing they can do to change that and the fault lies entirely with me. As much as I may think I want a remake, I'm not sure it would be a good thing."
gamernews,39zl3q,TempusFrangit,3,Tue Jun 16 13:10:44 2015 UTC,"I'm firmly with you there. I'm excited but mostly apprehensive. I was happy holding on to my memories of what it was and the place it held both in my heart and in gaming history, and I'm afraid that a remake will tarnish that.   The Advent Children movie was just mega-melodramatic craziness so I'm also afraid it might head in that direction."
gamernews,39zl3q,lilkuniklo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:52:25 2015 UTC,"Not only that, because I'm 100% with you there (and I think a lot of other people are as well but haven't realized it yet) but also, Square-Enix hasn't made anything in a looooong time that I loved. Squaresoft that made Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, FF3/7/Tactics/9 etc, hell even Parasite Eve and Vagrant Story, that company hasn't done anything I've liked since all of those, 10 was good but marked the end of an era, 12 was awful and nothing since then has been any good, so I'm very skeptical that I want a true remake, and I would probably prefer a remaster because the nostalgia is going to be obliterated and I'm not sure I want this current company in charge of making it fresh and new."

gamernews,39zl3q,xenopunk,12,Thu Jun 18 09:33:01 2015 UTC,"I thought it was going to be a bullshit live action trailer after the first few seconds, but then I realized that it was actually CG. They didn't really use much of the iconic imagery, but it still looked like Midgar. It was perfect.  Based on the teaser I expect a very different game from the original, but a game that will be equally as powerful and timeless. Midgar's upgrade made me confident this game will be treated with all of the love it deserves.  And the best part is: we will always have the original thanks to SE releasing it on modern platforms.  I don't know what else to say. I couldn't be more excited. I have been waiting for this since Advent Children was announced. I'm surprised Playstation didn't make square keep this secret until the live event.  10/10 can't wait. I will pay $120 for this game if I have to."

gamernews,39zl3q,NormalStranger,3,Tue Jun 16 15:48:43 2015 UTC,It'll probably be on PC. Square has been pushing out their catalog onto PC recently. So I don't see why they would want to keep it on consoles.
gamernews,39zl3q,SoberPandaren,3,Tue Jun 16 21:56:04 2015 UTC,"I've watched the teaser a few times now and I also think the game is going to be very different than the original.  This is probably a good thing.  The original hasn't really aged well (I personally think it's still fine, but kids these days...).  The narration in the trailer is difficult to follow.  It almost makes it seem as though this is a continuation of the FF7 story (seemed like they were talking about Meteor), but then it wouldn't be a remake if that's the case.  It's possible that they just changed the backstory though and the basic story is still the same.  Hopefully some of the more memorable moments remain like the crossdressing scene and chocobo racing.  No matter what though, I'll be all over this.    I have a hunch that there may be some crossover with XV.  I've gotten a strong VII vibe from what I've seen of XV so far so I wonder if they will be using the same engine.  Edit:  OK, I now realize the narration in the trailer is a double entendre.  That's clever!  He is actually talking about the backstory of FFVII, but it's worded and presented in such a way that it's as if he is also speaking to the viewer about the remake."

gamernews,39zl3q,BTMPL,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:17:24 2015 UTC,thanks for clarifying.
gamernews,39zl3q,kung-fu_hippy,-2,Tue Jun 16 07:58:48 2015 UTC,how is this not really a remake?
gamernews,39zl3q,kung-fu_hippy,2,Tue Jun 16 07:09:22 2015 UTC,"As BaneWilliams said, a remake is when you start from 0 and remake the whole game. What they did with FF6 for Android, FFX for PS3/PS4 is a remaster - it's the same game, with updated visuals and sounds. Little to no changes in the game code and mechanics."
gamernews,39zl3q,Flight714,-7,Tue Jun 16 08:18:53 2015 UTC,"what does that mean, start from zero and remake the whole game? do you have to remake the story, as well? what about the game world? the characters? the names of all of the stuff? where exactly is the zeroth starting place? it's like the great carl sagan said, ""If you wish to remake Final Fantasy VI from scratch, you must first invent the universe.""  remake is generally defined as:  anything that has been remade, renovated, or rebuilt  and  to make a new or different version of (something, such as a movie, song, etc.)  i won't argue with how you want to use the word 'remake', because adaptability of words to concepts and adaptability of understanding of those words are important aspects of evolution of communications, but i suggest that, before attempting to correct people in the future, you should look up definitions of the words you're claiming are being misused."
gamernews,39zl3q,Flight714,5,Tue Jun 16 08:54:54 2015 UTC,"That's all nice and everything, but the words ""remake"" and ""remaster"" when reffering to videogames might have different meaning than the encyclopedia teaches."
gamernews,39zl3q,Flight714,-7,Tue Jun 16 10:17:20 2015 UTC,"you use those words with colloquial meanings that aren't specified in common dictionaries, and, as i said, i accept that. it's a fundamental aspect of communication that i have no control over outside of my own expressions. i haven't corrected your use of the words.  however, the colloquial meaning being what it is does not negate the meaning of the common formal definitions. the android version of final fantasy vi is a remake of final fantasy vi."
gamernews,39zl3q,Flight714,2,Tue Jun 16 10:41:48 2015 UTC,"Look at Wild Arms: Alter Code F vs Wild Arms. That's a remake. New engine, character models, etc. Just a complete remake of the original story on new technology. Then there is FFX vs FFX: HD Remaster. That's a re-master, they took the original game and shined up the graphics.  In the specific case of songs, a re-master would be going to the master recording and re-copying it. Same for movies, and it should be the same for games.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remaster"
gamernews,39zl3q,binarian,-3,Tue Jun 16 12:10:39 2015 UTC,"your definitions are totally arbitrary   a remaster is a remake. a remake is literally defined as:  make (something) again or differently.  logically, all remasters are remakes, but not all remakes are remasters."
gamernews,39zl3q,Zeno84,3,Tue Jun 16 12:20:15 2015 UTC,"How is that arbitrary? If you look at the definition of a remaster you'll see that it has been commonly used to describe something along the lines of an upgraded copy made from the original source material. A remake is less well defined, but in any industry that uses the common definition of remaster, you can assume a remake to be something more than a higher quality copy of the original.   Since Square (like most videogame companies) uses the title remaster to label hd-copies of games (like FFX: HD Remaster), we can assume they mean something different with the word remake. And based in that, I would call the new versions of FF VI a remaster, and FF IV on DS a remake."
gamernews,39zl3q,The-ArtfulDodger,-2,Tue Jun 16 13:15:06 2015 UTC,"it's arbitrary because you're inventing it from speculation and personal experience.  http://www.reddit.com/r/gamernews/comments/39zl3q/final_fantasy_7_remake_announced_first_on_ps4/cs8aycu  there's a list of articles in which final fantasy vi for mobile platforms is referred to as a remake. in one article, the director of the game is directly quoted as calling it a remake.  remake is extremely well defined. i proved two common formal definitions above:  anything that has been remade, renovated, or rebuilt  and  to make a new or different version of (something, such as a movie, song, etc.)  do you refuse to accept well-known reporting web sites, the director of the game, multiple sources of definitions of the word 'remake', and the basic logical premise that all remixes are remakes due to the very clearly defined word 'remake'?"
gamernews,39zl3q,Zeno84,3,Tue Jun 16 13:22:07 2015 UTC,"He wants a remake, not a remaster. For reference:   A remaster uses the same assets as the original game, but cleaned up a bit with things like anti-aliasing, higher resolution textures, and higher frame rates. It won't look as good as a game made specifically for the new system. A remake uses entirely new assets, and is designed to take full advantage of a new systems power. It will look just as good as a game made specifically for the new system."

gamernews,39zl3q,thelonious_bunk,-2,Tue Jun 16 08:20:09 2015 UTC,"the definitions for 'remake' plainly qualify the android version of final fantasy vi as a remake:  to make a new or different version of (something, such as a movie, song, etc.)  something that is made again, esp a new version of an old film  anything that has been remade, renovated, or rebuilt.  you referenced some definitions, so i performed a web search using google to discover your sources. unfortunately, this was google's result:  No results found for ""A remaster uses the same assets as the original game"".  No results found for ""A remake uses entirely new assets, and is designed to take full advantage of a new systems power"".  you appear to have invented some anecdotal definitions for words that you have particular uses for. that's fine, and i accept that language is malleable and modular, such that people routinely adapt words to new meanings as required. however, your fabricated definitions do not invalidate perfectly acceptable exercises of previously defined words."

gamernews,39zl3q,AustinJG,4,Tue Jun 16 05:21:56 2015 UTC,"Considering Sqaure has been steadily adding FF titles to steam, I'm guessing there's going to be a PC release down the line."
gamernews,39zl3q,BoxMacLeod,2,Tue Jun 16 06:01:32 2015 UTC,It is almost certain I would say. Aside from what you pointed out they addressed several times that they don't want to depend on console and would like to push there games to PC if reasonable ( reas if profitable).   Also they specifically highlighted the PC sector like the mobile sector in there financial reports. Really unless sony coughs up a few billions there is no reason for square to not port it. You can port now easier then never. You can get a nice sum for console exclusive games ( as in only one console) and they have several statistics now how recent sales figures are for FF games on steam.   Really do we all think it is an coincident that FFVII launched on steam now out of all times. Wouldn't you wait with that to not get hopes ip before such an announcement.
gamernews,39zl3q,AustinJG,7,Tue Jun 16 11:35:49 2015 UTC,More like possible PC version.  But maybe?

Although I'd be happy with a total 3D remake if they stayed true to the story, music, and awesome character development. That would be awesome.  A few years ago I found a website where a guy was totally remastering the game. He claimed the game had originally been written in a special ""SNES HD"" (for lack of a better way to say it) format. I don't think he ever finished the project though. At the time I didn't have a PC so I never really got to mess with it."

Spoilers; Graphics are not nearly as important as tight gameplay. The game could look like a fucking N64 game, so long as it plays as good as Star Fox 64, then I'm sold."
gamernews,3a1vf4,Skest,5,Tue Jun 16 22:33:36 2015 UTC,"""Plays as good as Star Fox 64"" is hard to quantify though.  Goldeneye 64 was amazing gameplay at the time, but if you released a shooter with the same gameplay now it would seem shit.  Basically you're saying if it's a good game then it doesn't matter what it looks like, but I think graphics aside the gameplay looks pretty mediocre too. Maybe worth playing but not very exciting from what is essentially Nintendo's flagship title at E3."
gamernews,3a1vf4,Akamaru,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:50:04 2015 UTC,Its sad they're not willing to evolve the series. Starfox 64 is almost 20 years old. The gameplay shown in this trailer is ripped right out if Starfox 2 from the SNES.  The series could have more impact if it didnt just rehash nostalgic moments...
gamernews,3a1vf4,MoogleBoy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:43:41 2015 UTC,"While I kind of agree that innovation is needed for growth, didn't we kind of burn them at the stake for deviating from the core gameplay already?"
gamernews,3a1vf4,Akamaru,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:51:22 2015 UTC,"I don't recall this happening? When?  My problem is the fanboys want the same game, literally rehashed over and over again. Yet the fanboys are a small minority of the overall gaming population, and Nintendo's capitulation to them is why their products have become more and more niche over time.  Metroid Prime was a good example of evolving an IP from the NES/SNES era into a  more modern era (Gamecube). The fanboys didn't request that, but it ended up being change for the better.  Starfox could be so much more interesting but it is stuck in the SNES mentality. For being close to a 30 year old franchise, it needs to grow and evolve to stay relevant.  At least Nintendo has realized we're getting tired of Ocarina of Time inspired Zeldas and is trying something new with their upcoming Wii U Zelda..."

gamernews,39zlte,starmatter,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:08:54 2015 UTC,"But who are you to know that there aren't games that never saw the light of day that you probably could have enjoyed just as much or even more, just because studios keep rehashing the same stuff?"
gamernews,39ymbs,gamesbeawesome,18,Mon Jun 15 21:15:06 2015 UTC,"While it looks nice, that map looked really small though. They could barely fly in a straight line before having to turn around. Bit worrysome when they said this was their biggest gamemode with 40 players. I hope they have actual big maps :/"
gamernews,39ymbs,vowdy,5,Mon Jun 15 23:46:49 2015 UTC,"It did look really small. I'm excited to see more gameplay though. Funny how lots of people write it off after seeing a small gameplay vid. I think part of the reason it looks underwhelming is because of the environment-had they shown a lush colorful environment we might be more impressed. It looks like a good time to me either way. I hope the music plays throughout the matches like it did in the video, and I am especially excited for the sound in this game. Dice can fuck up some stuff, but their sound quality, while sometimes buggy, is top notch."
gamernews,39ymbs,carmshlonger,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:32:12 2015 UTC,Same thing with the planes in bf3 and bf4. This actually looks to have a much larger fly space.
gamernews,39ymbs,skarkeisha666,0,Fri Jun 19 07:10:15 2015 UTC,"And then you see the halo 5 maps which are absolutely massive, there really isn't any excuse to make maps small in 2015 for a multiplayer game unless its an interior map."
gamernews,39ymbs,isoceans,70,Tue Jun 16 05:09:59 2015 UTC,It looks alright but gonna wait for reviews before buying it after the mess BF4 is/was
gamernews,39ymbs,Emmanuell89,9,Mon Jun 15 21:26:31 2015 UTC,"Bf4 is actually good now as far as I can tell. I bought it on sale earlier this year and I enjoy it, more so than I like any other shooters these days. Hopefully they do a better job at cleaning it up prior to release."
gamernews,39ymbs,micmea1,-3,Mon Jun 15 22:46:47 2015 UTC,"No, not at all. They have completely regressed any netcode improvements they made with the last patch. Single frame deaths are more prevalent then ever. Balance is more jacked then ever. Air/ground balance is still completely out of whack. I can really go on all day."
gamernews,39ymbs,Ciaz,5,Tue Jun 16 00:00:38 2015 UTC,"You're right, its annoying. BF4 was actually in a great state before the most recent patch. DICE LA doing too much tinkering."

gamernews,39ymbs,nug4t,11,Tue Jun 16 06:01:25 2015 UTC,actually it looks a bit mediocre
gamernews,39ymbs,PalwaJoko,9,Mon Jun 15 22:36:40 2015 UTC,Yeah. I'm really sad that the Walker is on rails :(. I guess they did that so they can reuse it in multiple levels. Guessing that they're going to do this game mode a lot. Will probably be the main one.
gamernews,39ymbs,Gandalfs_Beard,4,Mon Jun 15 22:42:54 2015 UTC,I don't see why it has to be on rails when the AT-St's are not. Half the fun of Battlefront 2 was walking the At-At right up to the hanger.
gamernews,39ymbs,saskatchewan_kenobi,34,Mon Jun 15 22:51:16 2015 UTC,Because the mode revolves around the AT-ATs making it from point a to point b. And if some fucktard cant pilot it or decides to be an asshole then the round is lost for everyone. Rails make it fair.
gamernews,39ymbs,klisejo,3,Mon Jun 15 23:41:06 2015 UTC,C130 from Desert Combat comes to mind....
gamernews,39ymbs,PalwaJoko,3,Mon Jun 15 23:59:50 2015 UTC,Yeah I guess that's true. But I would've still loved a mode where you could drive them around freely. Maybe some type of capture point mode or destroy objective?  I bet you if they did that the population would flood that mode rather than this on rails mode.
gamernews,39ymbs,Davkul,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:51:21 2015 UTC,"The question is as the users, do we want modes with rails or do we want the open and free world we loved from the previous games. Sure its fair but it sure as hell is not what I want. Guess we will have to see what else they have to offer..."
gamernews,39ymbs,HappyBull,7,Tue Jun 16 00:14:53 2015 UTC,Open? Free? Barely. Out of all the BF2 maps I only liked Mos Eisley. There's definitely a difference between quantity and quality of maps. I sure as hell don't want them to just shit out a bunch of maps with only one or two of them being good.
gamernews,39ymbs,Syn7axError,3,Tue Jun 16 00:53:26 2015 UTC,"I mean, I liked them all, but aside from that, they were unquestionably open and free and non-linear.

gamernews,39ymbs,HollandGW215,2,Fri Jun 19 07:12:35 2015 UTC,"For that reason. People would complain its too slow, not use it, and it would be OP  it being on rails solves thsi"
gamernews,39ymbs,Gandalfs_Beard,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:03:37 2015 UTC,"Are you implying it will move faster because it's on rails? Those two things are completely unrelated to each other. The AT-AT in Battlefront 2 was slow as hell but you could move it anywhere you wanted.   Also I'll be damned if people aren't going to use it, either on rails or off them."
gamernews,39ymbs,HollandGW215,0,Tue Jun 16 03:33:23 2015 UTC,"First scenario: People will hop in. Get bored it moves so slow, fire the gun and hop out.   Second scenario: people will drive it and fuck around and not use it properly   Dice's proposed scenario: people use it. It's always useful, and it will be fun.   I don't get the flak for it not being on rails. You would still have fun and get a shit load of kills. Why do you need to drive it everywhere? It will obviously be headed towards main objectives with a lot of people. Do you really need to go that way and kill that thing that isn't useful? Probably not.   Also them putting it on rails probably means it will be very powerful. So it won't be some other vehicle you use and gets blown up 3 mins. They want it to be the center of attention. Everyone sees it. Everyone is fighting by it and everyone is scared of it. Someone driving it wherever they want risks losing that"
gamernews,39ymbs,atriax,0,Tue Jun 16 04:42:51 2015 UTC,"It will be fun.   It's not fun. You hit a button, it comes, and that's it. You're not even using it. Set and forget is not fun. It's incredibly boring and a cheap lazy design. Who gives a shit if someone fucks up with it and takes it to a stupid position. That's the fun of battlefield/battlefront. People do that shit all the time in planetside 2 as well. Get over it."
gamernews,39ymbs,ryegye24,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:17:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly it looked like they did it that way to make it not too OP, which some of the vehicles (including that one) definitely were in BF2."
gamernews,39ymbs,PalwaJoko,-1,Mon Jun 15 23:38:10 2015 UTC,"Same. I mean...it's not like its supposed to be a technological miracle. I mean hell, look at the things Bf2 did. You had to actually aim the zip line (instead of this gimicky as hell thing they got going on in EA's version) AND drivable At-Ats, at least if my memory serves correct they were.  It will be interesting to see where they go from here, but I have a sneaky suspicion that, like many of EA's IPs, they went with making things look cool rather than depth/usage."

gamernews,39ymbs,darwinianfacepalm,-12,Tue Jun 16 05:47:26 2015 UTC,"Yep. Don't forget all the bad news we've been getting for this. The ATAT there was on a scripted path and that map was tiny as hell. Doesn't look to fun to me, they just gutted too many core features of Battlefront 2."
gamernews,39ymbs,Lucretiel,28,Mon Jun 15 22:25:52 2015 UTC,"To be fair, relying on your allies to drive the AT-AT to somewhere useful was a huge pain in BF2. If it was another vehicle it wouldn't matter, but it was important for the AT-AT since it was (and presumably still is) a spawn point."
gamernews,39ymbs,solarnoise,7,Tue Jun 16 03:24:18 2015 UTC,"People were also saying the graphics wouldn't possibly hold up compared to the reveal trailer and they were completely wrong, so we'll see."
gamernews,39ymbs,solarnoise,6,Tue Jun 16 14:27:06 2015 UTC,What does that even mean.
gamernews,39ymbs,FaerieStories,15,Tue Jun 16 14:36:50 2015 UTC,"Everything I've seen people complain about this game has been - in my view - so stupendously minor. People always use terms like ""gutted"" or ""cut down"" or ""removed"", as if this were just the same game as BF2 and they chose to 'throw some things away' for the sake of it. I'm a huge Battlefront 2 fan, but let's be honest: that game's USP was simply the huge variety of stuff available to you to try out. If it had had far more limited options then yes: it would be an unremarkable game.  But BF3 isn't BF2. BF3 looks to have gameplay that actually will be satisfying and have longevity without the player needing to constantly do something new in order to keep the experience fresh. The basic mechanics of shooting or flying look far more satisfying and will hopefully be open to far deeper and more strategic play. Complaining about things like lack of a drivable AT-AT seem like trivialities to me. Just give me a well-executed game which really nails the feeling of Star Wars battles and I'll be happy."
gamernews,39ymbs,Shadou_Fox,5,Tue Jun 16 15:10:01 2015 UTC,"The AT-AT complaining is hilarious to me, all we ever see those thinds do in the movies is walk in straight lines, in order to turn them around you would need 10 square miles for it to work. People have a clouded view of the gameplay from BF2, they remember it as awesome, but i honestly don't remember playing it that long ( a month maybe), there was almost no depth to it."
gamernews,39ymbs,FaerieStories,4,Tue Jun 16 11:57:23 2015 UTC,"Oh, BF2 was absolutely fantastic and I sunk months into it: but there was nothing special about piloting the AT-AT."

I loved the game at first, but it gave me nothing to latch on to like so many other Star Wars games did."
gamernews,39ymbs,el_toastradamus,3,Tue Jun 16 19:51:33 2015 UTC,"Well I mean, it's not battlefront 2, so that would make sense"

gamernews,39ymbs,el_toastradamus,0,Mon Jun 15 22:48:08 2015 UTC,"They've been pretty clear the entire time its a reboot, not a sequel."
gamernews,39ymbs,Guccimayne,12,Mon Jun 15 22:52:21 2015 UTC,"That was their exact excuse when they launched SimCity with smaller maps while also lacking core features of the original franchise. It didn't magically make the game more fun or worthwhile.   I'm REALLY hoping they aren't cutting corners with Battlefront under the excuse of ""reboot, not a sequel!"""
gamernews,39ymbs,HappyBull,5,Mon Jun 15 22:54:57 2015 UTC,"To a newcomer to Simcity, I actually kinda enjoyed it. And as a student of design, I really appreciated how great looking their diagramming and representation was. Everything made sense, and I was rarely ever confused while playing it. I've played Simcity 3000 a while back and I had no idea what I was doing. I had no idea how to earn enough money to pay off my debt.  Hate to be that guy, but it was really enjoyable. I liked having to micromanage rather than make a shitton of areas that looked horrible and were inefficient."
gamernews,39ymbs,joebo19x,3,Tue Jun 16 00:23:30 2015 UTC,"Have you gotten to play cities:skylines yet?  If not, you should try it out. Made with a much smaller budget with a much smaller team."

gamernews,39ymbs,Guccimayne,-1,Tue Jun 16 01:14:50 2015 UTC,"I liked having to micromanage rather than make a shitton of areas that looked horrible and were inefficient.   There were definitely quality of life improvements that needed to be made. And ""horrible"" is quite subjective. I thought the games looked great for their time. But I want to hit on your micromange point:   I hope you realize, had you taken more time to learn the game like those of us who followed the series, you would have been able to micromanage cities the size of the entire Region. And you had to actually manage disasters and lay pipes and electricity that didn't stick to the road.   Honestly, I am truly sorry you didn't catch onto the game years before. There were definitely some needed improvements EA's SimCity made for quality of life, but if you truly love micromanaging, then you are seeing a shell of what SimCity could be. And it's because it's a reboot, not a sequel.   Just my 2cents"
gamernews,39ymbs,HappyBull,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:03:35 2015 UTC,"If it helps, I only got it for $20 when it was on sale. I read and saw countless negative reviews. And was actually hesitant on getting it, but I said what the heck. Just $20 and it's aesthetically pleasing. (This was after their ""offline patch"")  I think I just liked it for its visual representation, music, sound effects, and variety of buildings. Once again, I really really appreciate when U.I. works and looks nice. (On a related note, I bought Gran Turismo 5 the day it came out. Sold it two weeks later because the menu was atrocious). UI and style for a game is like a medium for a painting or material for a building. I just thoroughly  enjoyed it. That's all. Since I played it late, there weren't any bugs or drm issues, and I played it with my friends so it was even funner."
gamernews,39ymbs,Guccimayne,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:04:18 2015 UTC,"I feel you, I do the same thing sometimes. I myself heard bad things about Civilization:BE and I only picked it up because it was $20 and not the full $60.   EA's Simcity looks beautiful. There's no denying it. Its UI looks much better than Cities Skylines, too (but the actual game looks similar). But that's just about it. Cities Skylines actually brings back the micromanaging aspect and big maps that SC stripped out. I recommend picking that up on sale and trying it out."
gamernews,39ymbs,Fineus,17,Tue Jun 16 01:21:42 2015 UTC,That really doesn't excuse having fewer features than the namesake on which the game is based.
gamernews,39ymbs,el_toastradamus,10,Tue Jun 16 01:31:34 2015 UTC,We literally have seen one gameplay clip. How can you definitively say it has less features? That's like me already claiming the new Star Wars movie that's coming out has bad writing.
gamernews,39ymbs,Badabinski,9,Mon Jun 15 23:15:35 2015 UTC,"They said that it would have fewer features. This is kind of gross and hyper opinionated, but provides details."
gamernews,39ymbs,AuroricFlame,2,Tue Jun 16 00:03:57 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Maybe, in time, it'll be as much of a game as Battlefront II was, and I'll certainly wait until then.  I'm not your standard FPS player. I actually usually never play FPS, but I did play Battlefront II. Why? It had varied and strategic gameplay that you didn't tire of instantly.  For some of us, having all of those ""gimmicks"" is actually what the game is all about!  Otherwise it's just a dull shooter with a great setting, and I for one have had my fill of dull shooters."

gamernews,39ymbs,Kiwi_Force,11,Mon Jun 15 21:18:05 2015 UTC,"I think the idea was that the shielding covered the base, not the surrounding area. That's how they could land troops outside the base."

gamernews,39ymbs,a_salt_weapon,32,Tue Jun 16 01:26:25 2015 UTC,This looked scripted rather than played by someone. Maybe it wasn't. I don't know. Something just felt off.
gamernews,39ymbs,HappyBull,29,Tue Jun 16 19:36:39 2015 UTC,"Yes it was scripted. If you made a game and there was a high demand to see gameplay, for a company as big as DICE and EA, wouldn't you want to create a video that showcases every single thing you've developed? Rewatch it a bunch of times and you notice their attention to showing how things work and what they look like. For example showing first person and third person views between troopers and fighters. Another example would be when in third person you saw another race you could play as. Or showing visual effects and sound effects that look exaclty like practical effects from the movies. How the fighters interacted with the map. How the weapons worked. How the specials worked. etc..  They did this in order to answer as many questions as they could in a short but sweet and suspenseful movie. Not to do a 30 minute video of a guy playing multiplayer against people that aren't allowed to kill him while talking to the audience. Those bore the audience, are super corny, take way too long, and have higher risks of technical difficulties.  Just my two cents."
gamernews,39ymbs,Slight0,13,Mon Jun 15 23:36:22 2015 UTC,Ya don't say?  There's nothing wrong with that either. At least they're demoing in game combat and features instead of the pre-rendered nonsense you get with the majority of games.
gamernews,39ymbs,Lewd_Banana,2,Tue Jun 16 01:05:21 2015 UTC,"It's all gameplay, but played in a way to make it look more cinematic. A lot of DICE's battlefield multiplayer trailers are like this."
gamernews,39ymbs,TiLun,2,Tue Jun 16 01:22:51 2015 UTC,"Maybe. But if it was scripted, maybe it would have been played by someone more competent at games.  Most of DICE's Battefield gameplay promos looked very scripted, but everything you see in the videos were possible to do in the game."

A new game has a quarter the content of the old one, you fucking know if you'd just admit it to yourself that they're going to eventually have you pay upwards of $150 if you want content-parity with the original, and there's people defending this."
gamernews,39ymbs,Poles_Apart,2,Tue Jun 16 12:06:09 2015 UTC,"A game from 10 years ago? Not really because the detail in all of those maps is dog shit compared to how intricate they are nowadays.    For the record bolding does nothing for your argument and just makes you look silly.      A new game has a quarter the content of the old one,   This is a bullshit figure pulled out of your ass. If anything games have far more content than ever before. There are some open world games nowadays that have far too much content for any one player to ever expect to experience. Show me a long list of games from 10 years ago that all have more content than the games coming out today? You would likely point to one or two titles back then and think you actually proved your point, but you need a large list to even have a fucking argument. That is what you get for using absolutes you dummy.      that they're going to eventually have you pay upwards of $150 if you want content-parity with the original   Even with EA, 120 bucks is about what you would expect with Premium and the game itself. Not 150 and over, and even if you find instances of this, that is definitely NOT the standard, even for EA. It is also definitely not typical for other games. Most Season Passes are 15 to 30 dollars.      Now do you know why you are really an idiot?     I was never defending EA and Battlefront. I was arguing that the comparison was bullshit in some respects and it definitely is. The wording of the vehicle one in particular is amazing. I know EA is evil and fucks tons of games over. I am personally never buying a Battlefield game again just because I hate the combat. This one I may purchase just for nostalgia, but even then I know what I am getting will likely not be as good as it should be. That is fine with me because I will likely find it for 30-40 bucks thanks to reseller sites."

That said, it looks chalked full of potential and the prospect of fighting a giant robosaurus rex is a really enticing thought. The art direction of the game is this awesome tribal technological feel that seems pretty fresh. It makes me think of some of the art work that has ended up on reddit recently, the name escapes me at the moment, but it has this great meaning of advanced technology in nature and in some cases presented in a tribal manner as well, with robots clad in feathers and covered with bright paints, standing in nature."

gamernews,39zh6f,foolofatook29,6,Tue Jun 16 04:12:31 2015 UTC,It looks way better than I expected. Definitely like a sequel to Ico. Feels extremely similar.

Also, when the kid pushes the log for his creature to climb up on... what was the log anchored to that allowed him to get a better grip? nothing. Yeah, I know ""it's just a game"", and sure such instances can be forgiven, but for a gameplay reveal? Almost everything shown was a bad choice."

gamernews,39zh6f,foolofatook29,3,Tue Jun 16 04:16:57 2015 UTC,Basically the same thing happened 3 times. There was no hint of the larger story. It's just a boy and a giant dog walking through the empty world. They trip and catch each other. Whoopee doo.  Have you SEEN the original trailer? It was WAY more epic. There were fucking arrows in that giant thing. There were also bad guys to run away from.  I am also pretty sure the pet thing was way way bigger in the original trailer. Maybe they made it smaller for performance issues?
gamernews,39zh6f,solarnoise,6,Tue Jun 16 04:22:39 2015 UTC,"That is essentially all that happens in Ico, though. And in Shadow you're mostly doing one thing (holding R1 as you shimmy up colossi). I think TLG looks exactly like what you'd expect in a game from these devs, except the technical bar has clearly been raised. Getting the mechanics to work with what is essentially a big moving platform with animations must have been hell."
gamernews,39zh6f,foolofatook29,-1,Tue Jun 16 04:59:57 2015 UTC,Except they already perfected the mechanics of 18 moving platforms in Shadow of the Colossus. Point is that SOTC is still a beast compared to ICO or The Last Guardian.

After all that buildup the first gameplay they show is so boring and predictable I'm considering skipping parts of the video.   I really hope there'll be more to the game than running up to holes and heavy objects and pressing the call Falkor button. They just haven't shown anything that makes the game look more interesting than the Brothers game released last year.

They're pretty much having the public fund their own hype train.  I'm surprised they didn't have that happen for the FF7 remake.
gamernews,39zlyv,coffeesippingbastard,11,Tue Jun 16 02:16:25 2015 UTC,"Probably 50/50 ""This is a terrible business decision so we won't do it"" and ""We're tired of hearing about it so if you want it so bad, you pay for it."""

gamernews,39zlyv,bongo1138,10,Tue Jun 16 13:42:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Despite somehow making it to E3, they want us to bail Shenmue out."
gamernews,39zlyv,OldSchoolVinny,7,Tue Jun 16 02:24:54 2015 UTC,"It makes absolutely no sense. Sony sure seemed to have lost their ""for the gamer"" mentality on this one. Instead of funding the project (which lets be honest they've made shittier investments with worse potential and inevitable pay out) and having it be a PS exclusive with something that resembled an actual game by now, we get a plea for donations, for a game that supposedly is also coming to PC.  Let's not even mention the fact that it's barely off the ground in terms of design, graphics, gameplay, so on.   Between this and the CGI trailer for FF7 which is sure to be a few years away, I can't help but feeling a bit ""meh"" to the conference as a whole.   Horizon was great and was my favorite title, but how far away is that? Holiday 2016 at the least."

Doesn't matter- fanboys are full on circlejerking to FF7 remake.  Honestly I'm really concerned about the shenmue kickstarter.  It would be a fucking awful idea to start crowdfunding future game development, especially on games that are at the scale of Shenmue, and I definitely can see Sony using Shenmue3 as a testbed to see if it's a plausible avenue."
gamernews,39zlyv,coffeesippingbastard,2,Tue Jun 16 05:18:47 2015 UTC,"It has the potential to not only give Sony the idea, but really any developer. I mean they literally took something that was thus far used for indie devs and older developers who made games years past but have since made a new venture. That's the only demographics who used it. It made sense giving a few bucks to some lowly developer. But we're talking about funding a AAA title for a console. This is a nasty precedent to set, and one I am afraid will get copy cats.   As I said in my original post, they really should have just funded it. Came out on stage, bragged as it being a Sony published first party title, our holiday 16. Instead we an infomercial."

gamernews,39xjmf,kodiakus,15,Tue Jun 16 23:06:39 2015 UTC,"It's nice cg trailer work, but no gameplay. I'm not sure what this says about the game other than we understand cinematic character and environment animation. I guess we all assume it's metroid prime genre gameplay with this setting and these characters?   I'm really not the audience here, so hopefully it is working for someone, but it does nothing for me."
gamernews,39xjmf,ittleoff,8,Mon Jun 15 18:37:02 2015 UTC,"With the mention of Metroid, it feels like the complex they are entering will have you progress in a metroidvania style, or more akin to one of the 3D metroids. The interchangeable core indicates the primary mechanic of switching between robots to solve puzzles (?) and combat.  A new metroidvania-like game would be nice. It's just sad to see it's XB1 exclusive, because this seems like a potentially interesting title."
gamernews,39xjmf,TempusFrangit,2,Mon Jun 15 19:22:26 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I was thinking, regarding the different robots being akin to the different forms of Samus' suit(s?) in puzzle solving and combat.   I think ms needs very high profile games in the areas that Sony is perceived to be weaker in. Nintendoesque games would seem a good place to put their efforts. ( although Rare efforts have fallen a bit flat)   Again this probably isn't a game for me. I just get tired of cg only announcements. At least showing something in engine gives you a taste of the assets being created for the actual game."
gamernews,39xjmf,ittleoff,2,Mon Jun 15 19:33:35 2015 UTC,"metroid prime was all about puzzles and exploration. i think the friendly robots are in it for mass appeal, but it otherwise will probably feel like an exploration game."
gamernews,39xjmf,deeleelee,2,Mon Jun 15 19:09:18 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm sure, but just like the order, these announcement trailers that are all cinematic just don't do much for me anymore.

gamernews,39xjmf,SoaringDive,2,Mon Jun 15 19:22:03 2015 UTC,Metroid Prime and Inafune is enough for me to be interested.
gamernews,39xjmf,bongo1138,3,Mon Jun 15 20:57:54 2015 UTC,"I honestly think they had nothing better to slap onto this trailer because when you think about it "" the makers of Metroid Prime"" are not a studio anymore. Most if not all IIRC people who were in charge of Prime have parted ways with the old Retro Studios and even if Retro would make a new Prime game, it would be different. So if you loved Prime chances are that the people who actually made it what it is have nothing to do with Recore.  Edit: I take that back. Appearently former game director of Retro Mark Pacini, art director Todd Keller and principal technology engineer Jack Mathews left Retro Studios to form Armature Studio, so the brains behind Prime are all here."

The studio is best known for its work on the Metroid Prime series and the Donkey Kong Country series, and has contributed to several other Nintendo game projects, such as Metroid Prime Hunters and Mario Kart 7.  Retro was founded in 1998 as an alliance between Nintendo and former Iguana Entertainment founder Jeff Spangenberg, hoping to create titles for the then-upcoming GameCube aiming at an older demographic. The company begun working on four different titles, all of which were finally cancelled once Retro focused their resources on Metroid Prime, the first Metroid title developed outside of Japan. The success of Metroid Prime led Retro to work on two sequels, and later to become involved with reviving the Donkey Kong series with Donkey Kong Country Returns.

gamernews,39xjmf,SoaringDive,4,Mon Jun 15 19:19:08 2015 UTC,"To be fair, PC exclusivity is absolutely reasonable, because it's at the top of the food chain system-wise. If it can run on a console, it can run on PC. So downwards exclusivity is dumb. But consoles just won't be able to handle some games like a PC, at least not without serious gimping. So yeah, sometimes it is for the good of the game, and upwards exclusivity makes perfect sense.  That being said, I still think exclusivity just kinda sucks overall, necessitated by hardware or otherwise."
gamernews,39xjmf,DillonMabry,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:30:43 2015 UTC,"Well if the consoles weren't comically underpowered, maybe PC exclusivity wouldn't need to exist beyond a need for different input methods."
gamernews,39xjmf,shifty_pete,-4,Mon Jun 15 19:51:36 2015 UTC,"But do you remember the time where consoles were better than a having a PC? It stopped with PS3/Xbox360. The 7th generation of consoles put the first nails in the console-gaming coffin. PS2/Xbox were the last good consoles. XBOX still has better features than every box that followed (of course, because it's more or less a full pc made for gaming).  Edit: You guys have to have shit in the brain. Negative score for pointing out, that having a console back then was the most realistic choice. SNES for 100$ was better than havbing a pc for 4500$? Or a PSX für about the same price later, or a PC for 1500$? PS2/Xbox were the last competitive consoles to a PC, believe it or not."
gamernews,39xjmf,Hewman_Robot,-2,Mon Jun 15 21:41:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, no I don't remember consoles losing out to PC or PC losing out to consoles. PC was best early on, then, exclusively for gaming the Xbox/PS2/GameCube era was excellent for consoles, but PC was still more powerful and did more. Now PC has completely eclipsed consoles. E3 right now will be consoles making a bold case, but this is always the ""empty promises"" phase of the calendar year. All these pretty games and CGI trailers will eventually be cut down into the medicre games console gamers have learned to love and accept."
gamernews,39xjmf,shifty_pete,0,Mon Jun 15 21:56:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe I should have said competitive, like how Super Nintendo and PSX were very competitive to PC gaming. Remember the prices for a PC-build back then. Real PC gaming started with times of the Voodoo3 gfx card, Half Life and Unreal Turnament :D. And of course the XBOX/PS2/GC, and XBox had amazing graphics, and you could do anything with it. And, my Xbox and PS2 are still working. My friends crappy/loud Xbox360 got the RoD after a year.

Obviously, this game isn't even close enough to show, why bother announcing it? Are there really so few things Microsoft has to offer?"
gamernews,39xjmf,shifty_pete,-5,Mon Jun 15 19:31:54 2015 UTC,"Worrying trend at this E3 of new games with a male protagonist having a female counterpart, but plenty of female protag games without a male equal or option.  See: Gears 4/Fallout 4 vs ReCore/Beyond Sight/Mirror's Edge  We're supposed to be moving towards equality, but this feels like oversteering."
gamernews,39xjmf,Baryn,3,Mon Jun 15 19:49:15 2015 UTC,Not every game is an RPG where you can pick character gender. How many thousands of games have a male only protagonist?
gamernews,39xjmf,jWalkerFTW,0,Mon Jun 15 22:43:34 2015 UTC,"Insofar as new franchises introduced at E3 this year, it's just female I think. It doesn't matter if thousands of games exist in the past, the point isn't to mathematically equalize things across all of history, just in the present day."
gamernews,39xjmf,Baryn,2,Mon Jun 15 23:23:42 2015 UTC,So? Do you have a problem with a lot of female protagonists? What about all the female gamers who had to deal with 20+ years of 90% male main characters?
gamernews,39xjmf,jWalkerFTW,2,Tue Jun 16 01:25:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's quite an equal comparison. The first two games are either about a team (where you have multiple characters) or a player avatar (where the character needs to be fully customizable). Conversely, the latter three are about specific characters with their own characterizations and stories that the player follows along with. It makes sense for the later to not have selectable genders, particularly if they don't want to trivialize them. I am sure you'd be able to find at least as many games with fixed male protagonists if you objectively compared the offerings across E3, rather than just a handful of examples."
gamernews,39xjmf,EpsilonRose,0,Tue Jun 16 02:05:05 2015 UTC,Yeah I hope the story changes a bit as E3 goes on.

gamernews,39xjmf,EpsilonRose,2,Tue Jun 16 01:23:52 2015 UTC,"For the sake of argument, I looked at the pre-order page on Amazon. I took a shot at counting the number of games that have only male protagonists.  Rainbow Six Siege  Call of Duty  Mighty No. 9  Devil's Third  Arkham Knight  Zelda U  Halo 5  Just Cause 3  Doom  StarFox U  Yoshi's Wooly World  Tony Hawk 5  Crackdown  Dishonored 2  Ghost Recon Wildlands  Ratchet & Clank  Homefront  Scalebound  6 or 7 sports & racing games  and Prey 2  I'm not sure if I missed any.

gamernews,39xjmf,Baryn,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:35:13 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way. Games that let you choose the gender and some backstory of the character are telling a story of the world.

So therefore I'm not going to buy it for the Xbox one even if MS is throwing in a free game. I wasn't hating just voicing my option.   But with that it does look like MS is starting to struggle a bit with sales. I think the early PR they did really impacted their sales negatively at the start. But, I do think they have some slick tricks up their sleeve like the backwards comparability that they blindsided us all with. I personally think it should have been a day one feature but I'm sure it takes a bit to work out all the kinks.   Anyway, using thought I'd come back and clear my name.   Good day ladies and gentledudes."

I do believe in second chances though, but with From Software, that's probably as far as I'm willing to go, too.

gamernews,39xt6y,Creamatine,7,Mon Jun 15 19:22:15 2015 UTC,"Here's what I saw.  A highly compressed and poor frame rate video reveals a highly scripted portion of the game mostly looking at ice textures that can't be analyzed technically from the video compression. The vibe was lots of that Uncharted-esque gameplay where everything breaks as you move through it, hopefully quickly enough not to die. There looked to be some really basic puzzle solving in the montage at the end. The distant views were unimpressive skyboxes.  I LOVED the 2013 Tomb Raider, and I expect that this game will be more of the same, and probably pretty good. But this trailer showed nothing. It was essentially a cutscene, and most likely not running on real Xbox hardware. I'm not impressed."

gamernews,39xt6y,ittleoff,3,Wed Jun 17 21:50:08 2015 UTC,Does anyone know how long this is going to be  a timed exclusive for?  It is pretty a pretty crumby move at the end of the day. Microsoft has a bottomless well of money and rather than create something unique to their console ala Uncharted... they use their resources to snatch something away from the other platforms.

gamernews,39vbhl,GrassWaterDirtHorse,12,Mon Jun 15 04:56:20 2015 UTC,"I still think I'd rather play Brutal Doom, to be honest. This might be more of a return to the origins of the franchise than the previous game but it still feels like it doesn't know what it's trying to be.  Doom 3 was different, but it was different in a good way and I enjoyed it in its own right. This... this doesn't seem different at all; it seems like a generic modern shooter that's set in the Doom universe -- which was never that original to begin with.   Doom's always relied on the strength of its gameplay and I haven't seen much here to win me over. I want faster pace, bigger guns and more enemies/carnage across a map that's been designed with that in mind. I don't really care how polished things look, it's not the type of game where I want to be slowing down to take notice; if it feels good, that's all I'm after."
gamernews,39vbhl,UK-Redditor,4,Mon Jun 15 14:57:15 2015 UTC,The concept of Doom 3 was good but I think it's execution was a little lacking. I really enjoyed the first couple levels but after that it felt to me like it was extremely repetitive. The end boss was also quite disappointing.
gamernews,39vbhl,internet_observer,3,Mon Jun 15 19:08:56 2015 UTC,I personally liked Doom 3 and I like how Doom 4 looks as well.
gamernews,39vbhl,Yearlaren,3,Mon Jun 15 15:16:41 2015 UTC,"I really liked Doom 3, it was a closer aproximation of what was described in the Doom Bible.  Plus Bioshock was a ways out and we hadn't seen anything like System Shock in years.  I kind of wish they pushed that envelope a bit harder but people just complained that it wasn't a shooter's shooter, which sucks because in its day Doom was creepy as hell and gave me nightmares as a kid."
gamernews,39vbhl,ztfreeman,21,Mon Jun 15 15:12:15 2015 UTC,"I liked that it uses a tweaked version of some of the original Doom's sounds (the doors are the most obvious example). Also i liked the addition of double jump and that grabbing and going up from a ledge is almost instant (in some other games i've seen it the devs put some lengthy animation that breaks the pace). Guns sound good.  I disliked the speed though, it was too slow for my taste. And i also disliked the constant fade in/fade out of the pumpy music - either put some pumpy music in there or don't, do just fade in/out all the time, it becomes annoying."
gamernews,39vbhl,badsectoracula,19,Mon Jun 15 06:50:15 2015 UTC,"I disliked the speed though, it was too slow for my taste.    The person playing was deliberately walking slow to show off the environment/take up time/make it feel ""cinematic"". This is very common in these kinds of reveal presentations. In combat he was moving around much quicker."
gamernews,39vbhl,thelastbaron,2,Mon Jun 15 10:15:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they rehearse with the sticks to go slow and show off the level. real gameplay will be jerky and fast like we like it."
gamernews,39vbhl,duggtodeath,0,Mon Jun 15 14:44:53 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's still slow. They at least split the difference between Doom 3 and the originals."

gamernews,39vbhl,duggtodeath,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:38:08 2015 UTC,"It was walking slow at the beginning indeed, but even later it wasn't walking much faster. But maybe that was due to the controller making it annoying to be running (does it have always on running like the original or you ""sprint"" like in Doom3?)."
gamernews,39vbhl,badsectoracula,11,Mon Jun 15 15:50:57 2015 UTC,Kids are all about that sidechain compression these days.
gamernews,39vbhl,Spacey138,7,Mon Jun 15 07:05:43 2015 UTC,What does this mean?
gamernews,39vbhl,Nazgren,8,Mon Jun 15 13:02:58 2015 UTC,"Sidechain compression is a technique used in music production. The tl;dr of it is, it gives instruments a push-pull feel, usually by having the volume dip synced up to the kick drum.   A compressor is a tool that, essentially, lowers the volume of an instrument when it hits a certain peak level. It's commonly used to make a track louder overall, but with less dynamic variance.   ""Sidechaining"" is a technique where you set up an effect to be triggered by something else. A sidechained compressor will (usually) have its ""threshold"" triggered by the kick drum, so when that hits, the instrument you're compressing drops in level, then returns to it over a set amount of time.   You can do all kinds of fun stuff with sidechains. I like to sidechain a gate on a synth to intricate breakbeats, you end up getting a pretty cool rhythm that offsets the drums."
gamernews,39vbhl,lotictrance,6,Mon Jun 15 15:33:06 2015 UTC,Soooo what does this mean?
gamernews,39vbhl,foolofatook29,9,Mon Jun 15 17:19:19 2015 UTC,Basically that the game's sound effects trigger the volume of the music to lower temporarily and then fade back up when the sound effects clear.
gamernews,39vbhl,garydee119,3,Mon Jun 15 17:41:48 2015 UTC,Thank you. That was a good sentence.
gamernews,39vbhl,foolofatook29,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:53:25 2015 UTC,It's also commonly referred to as audio ducking.   The same can be heard on movie commentaries. Radio DJs use it all the time.
gamernews,39vbhl,therightclique,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:08:31 2015 UTC,"The only game to ever do the fade-in-fade-out thing well is Invisible, Inc..

It really makes you feel like you're in a spy/heist movie."

gamernews,39vbhl,lahsdude07,25,Tue Jun 16 04:05:05 2015 UTC,Something about this looks off. It looks like a prerendered movie meant to simulate gameplay rather than actual gameplay itself.
gamernews,39vbhl,Scorpinock,3,Mon Jun 15 07:25:34 2015 UTC,Not pre-rendered as much as a scripted sequence to show off the weapons and visuals.  I'd imagine gameplay will be much faster - you can see him climb things and double-jump a few times.
gamernews,39vbhl,Nazgren,2,Mon Jun 15 19:16:05 2015 UTC,It seems more likely highly scripted (even the player character/camera) than pre-rendered. Their engine can definitely produce this kind of quality in realtime.
gamernews,39vbhl,therightclique,3,Mon Jun 15 21:24:09 2015 UTC,It's not prerendered. It might not look nearly this good when released on consoles but this wasn't prerendered. See the second video from the hell level.
gamernews,39vbhl,thinsoldier,2,Mon Jun 15 14:35:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly my thought. It is prerendered to the wazoo. They should have played raw gameplay footage, it seems to me that the trailer made the chainsaw action too visceral and the animation for it is slow as shit."
gamernews,39vbhl,themunga,0,Mon Jun 15 08:28:30 2015 UTC,Because the person playing was turning like molasses. You know they were playing on the easiest setting with a controller. Did you see that weapon switch ui. I'm calling it this game is consolized.
gamernews,39vbhl,Rocketlauncherboy,2,Mon Jun 15 19:11:13 2015 UTC,What possible incentive would they have to not consolize it?
gamernews,39vbhl,therightclique,46,Mon Jun 15 21:24:54 2015 UTC,"I actually have to say I was just a bigger fan of the Doom 3 style. I know it wasn't classic Doom, but it had cinematic quality and genuinely scared me sometimes.   Honestly, this trailer didn't do anything for me, and that's okay. Just not my cup of tea."
gamernews,39vbhl,Veritasgear,23,Mon Jun 15 03:18:43 2015 UTC,"This seems like it takes a lot of inspiration from Bulletstorm. For those that enjoyed that game, it looks like this will be a real treat."
gamernews,39vbhl,Bacon_Hammers,2,Mon Jun 15 04:37:22 2015 UTC,"haven't watched this trailer yet, but holy crap, I loved me some Bulletstorm"
gamernews,39vbhl,McCHitman,2,Mon Jun 15 06:34:36 2015 UTC,"For what it was, and knowing what to expect going into Bulletstorm, I have to say I enjoyed it as well. I wouldn't buy it, but it was one of the best rentals I had that I didn't go out and buy the game afterwards. I enjoyed Doom 1 and 2, but Doom 3 spoiled me for something a bit more deep than a point and shoot gorefest. Not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just not my cup of tea."
gamernews,39vbhl,Bacon_Hammers,2,Mon Jun 15 06:45:41 2015 UTC,"I asked this earlier, but most of the time my stuff doesn't get answered so I'll ask you-  I never played Doom 3. Is the BFG edition that was released on the 360 worth picking up? Or does the game suffer from technical issues or changes that weren't faithful to the original."
gamernews,39vbhl,McCHitman,2,Mon Jun 15 06:51:32 2015 UTC,It's a more shooty version of DooM 3 then the original.
gamernews,39vbhl,SoberPandaren,2,Mon Jun 15 10:49:31 2015 UTC,"If you've never played Doom 3, definitely get BFG edition."

gamernews,39vbhl,Cancerslug,2,Mon Jun 15 14:43:36 2015 UTC,Cut out sections? As far as I can tell they added sections and switched other parts around.
gamernews,39vbhl,Veritasgear,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:26:34 2015 UTC,You are correct. I may have been mixing up my memories of the Xbox version of D3. The new missions for BFG were apparently cut from the original release of Doom 3 and added back in.
gamernews,39vbhl,Cancerslug,2,Mon Jun 15 15:55:08 2015 UTC,Oh the lost missions you mean?
gamernews,39vbhl,Veritasgear,0,Mon Jun 15 17:34:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I haven't played the BFG edition. I'm not sure of what changes were made besides limited Oculus Rift functionality."
gamernews,39vbhl,Bacon_Hammers,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:07:37 2015 UTC,I did not like bulletstorm =\  maybe I just grew tired of the genre because i did all the quakes and dooms.  Doom 3 was definitely pleasing because it was immersive.
gamernews,39vbhl,ViggoMiles,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:22:01 2015 UTC,"Bulletstorm was a great game, with a terrible story and even worse dialog. That said, Doom really shouldn't be anything like Bulletstorm."
gamernews,39vbhl,therightclique,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:20:40 2015 UTC,"I feel like Bulletstorm is a bad comparison. Bulletstorm aimed at the ideas of combos and continuous kills. This just seemed like you were getting barraged with enemies like the old doom days, only now you had more of the up-close and personal chainsaw/melee kill animations available to you. I don't mind the gorey up-close kill segments as they add a bit of awesomeness to the feel of the game, but it's more of the chaos and challenge factor like the original that I want it to have."
gamernews,39vbhl,JohnnyHammerstix,6,Mon Jun 15 23:25:39 2015 UTC,"Man, Doom 3 is a treasure of my teen years. I was excited for this, but man, it looks pretty, but that's as far as it goes. Doom 3 had be mentally preparing to open the door to the next room, counting health packs (and sometimes ammo). It was stressful, scary, and I loved every moment of it. This...just looks like a bright colorful run and gun. I would ask, ""what's the appeal?"", but I remember Painkiller comes to mind. However, Painkiller was outrageous and didn't take itself serious. This doesn't seem anything like that at all."
gamernews,39vbhl,Cobalt81,17,Mon Jun 15 04:01:22 2015 UTC,Doom 3 was a departure from the series gameplay wise. This Doom revisits the gameplay (with upgrades of course) of the original games.
gamernews,39vbhl,Solo_Wookie,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:24:58 2015 UTC,We don't really know that. Nothing in the two gameplay clips bares much resemblance to the original games.
gamernews,39vbhl,therightclique,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:21:36 2015 UTC,"Most definitely, but I guess I must be in the minority when I ask, ""do we really want it?"" We can find generic shooters anywhere, what makes this different? I feel like it's a ""times have changed"" sort of situation. Back in the days of Doom 1 and 2, that was the only way to do an fps (I don't have much experience playing that genre of old-school fps games, so work with me here). Nowadays games are so branched out and varied and this type of shooter is very plain.  I'm not sure, am I making any sense? Am I off base for feeling like this is just like a game where you just walk around killing things that get in your way without any care? I can't help but feel like it's vanilla and will be effortlessly easy.  Or maybe I'm just super let down and letting my emotions get in the way, thoughts?"
gamernews,39vbhl,Cobalt81,12,Mon Jun 15 06:33:06 2015 UTC,"I think people are actually craving a high quality ""generic"" shooter. Currently the genre is oversaturated with pseudorealistic, cinematic military shooters, so this kind of gameplay feels very welcome."
gamernews,39vbhl,teeso,11,Mon Jun 15 10:36:52 2015 UTC,"Everyone has their own tastes based on their video game history. If you started the Doom franchise at Doom 3 then that is what Doom is to you. I grew up playing the original Doom, so any future Doom game that has a similar play style will resonate with me quite a bit. This type of shooter may seem plain, but for a lot of people, a plain shooter is a refreshing break from more complicated FPS games. Don't get me wrong, I love FPS games that offer more such as Borderlands or Deus Ex, but every so often I just want a game where I can sit back and destroy hordes of demons with ridiculously powerful weapons."
gamernews,39vbhl,Solo_Wookie,2,Mon Jun 15 07:09:27 2015 UTC,I agree with this. I think they should have split off and named their game something else instead of doom 3. Started a new IP or something.
gamernews,39vbhl,Veritasgear,2,Mon Jun 15 15:23:33 2015 UTC,"You can better relate to the trailer by playing the classic Doom 1 and 2. Because Doom 4 appears to be a revival of the classic Doom gameplay with fast action and hordes of demons.   Doom 1 and 2 wasn't mindless shooting, because the levels had some amazing platforming and puzzles to solve."

gamernews,39vbhl,micmea1,2,Mon Jun 15 04:27:03 2015 UTC,And then they ruined it with the BFG edition.

gamernews,39vbhl,Cobalt81,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:16:00 2015 UTC,It's definitely worth it. I just played through it a month or so ago and it has held up over the years.

It looks fantastic, but personally I just see nothing exciting, just a numbing gallery shooter following from wolfenstein. However people that loved said game will no doubt love DOOM.  The inclusion of multiplayer and snap map however is brilliant in my opinion."
gamernews,39vbhl,PoweredByPotato,9,Mon Jun 15 03:31:40 2015 UTC,"Well I think the thing is that the original doom was very run-and-gun, as was the sequel. When the third came out, most people expected it to be like the other two, but the developer wanted to create something more evil, fear inducing, and dark, and unfortunately the mass audience of people who played it were used to the old style of doom. Because of this, the developer got a lot of flak and is now trying to compensate for that by bringing back the ""old school"" feel.   Good for old school players, bad for those more interested in a spooky story, like you and I."
gamernews,39vbhl,Veritasgear,2,Mon Jun 15 03:37:50 2015 UTC,"aside from the silliness that you can't see anything until someone ductaped the flashlight to the gun, what did they catch flak on?"

You can see, or you can shoot, but not both did a huge amount to make it feel tense when you were wandering around the dark places in the game.  Perhaps it wasn't right for a Doom game, but as a mechanic it really worked to up the tension."
gamernews,39vbhl,hiddencamel,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:30:27 2015 UTC,I have played both the original and the BFG edition and I have to say I liked the original way more. It just made things way scarier. Especially that part where you have to escort that one guy through the dark. Terrifying.
gamernews,39vbhl,Veritasgear,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:20:21 2015 UTC,"It wasn't as run and gun as people were used to with doom. Some thought the pacing was too slow, too dark, relied too much on jump scares, and that the demons were to satanic and not robotic enough. (Which to me is silly)"
gamernews,39vbhl,Veritasgear,14,Mon Jun 15 15:18:45 2015 UTC,"Repetitive kill animations that halt the flow of gameplay, boring environments, low number of enemies on screen with a high TTK..... Yeah, I did a 'meh' :/"

gamernews,39vbhl,nschubach,3,Mon Jun 15 13:26:59 2015 UTC,"Yep, and like I say they completely break the flow of gameplay. If you want to see melee combat in and FPS done right (in my opinion), see the recent Shadow Warrior remake by Flying Wild Hog: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vrw95DuVphc&user=deluxe345 The production values are waaaaaaaaaay lower that those on display in that Doom video, but it looks far more satisfying to play."

gamernews,39vbhl,YXAYXA,13,Mon Jun 15 06:58:17 2015 UTC,This is what I have always wanted. A game that stays pretty true to the core DooM mechanics while giving it a graphics upgrade.   I'm sad to see double jump and clamor though. It seems like since Titanfall every single FPS thinks they need those two things. Just look at CoD or Halo. I was really happy to not see sprint at least.
gamernews,39vbhl,Fat_Pony,20,Mon Jun 15 04:31:25 2015 UTC,Sprinting is a thing in doom though.
gamernews,39vbhl,Zerosan,9,Mon Jun 15 03:53:45 2015 UTC,"That was a ""run faster"" button, not sprint. While sprinting in modern games you lower your weapon to run faster, but you never did in DooM.   Also in DooM, everyone just held the button down continuously, so it was the de facto base speed. On the 360 port of DooM II, you can even set it in options to run by default."
gamernews,39vbhl,Fat_Pony,2,Mon Jun 15 04:37:27 2015 UTC,Fucking semantics. Jesus.
gamernews,39vbhl,therightclique,6,Mon Jun 15 05:30:00 2015 UTC,"I mean, Doom and Doom 2 didn't even have jump, let alone double jump!"
gamernews,39vbhl,Wanderlustfull,3,Mon Jun 15 21:26:22 2015 UTC,What is clamor?  Double jump was a thing in Unreal Tournament way before Titanfall. And IMO it adds to the game.

See Rise of the Triad (2013) for Doom-like movement done with current-gen graphics.  Those small cutscenes showing enemy deaths are going to get old about 15 minutes in. I don't know how anyone could say this is like Doom at all. If it wasn't named ""Doom"" nobody would be talking about it.  Please explain how this is similar to Doom."

gamernews,39vbhl,spartan117au,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:29:38 2015 UTC,"I have one MAJOR concern; Casualing. ""Casualing?"" you say. Yes, Casualing.   While I hope that this is only because it's on Easy difficulty for the live demo aspect, what irritated me the most was the fact that the game slows down dramatically to let you pick your next weapon. Granted this could be just to show off the HUD or weapon switching interaction, but I saw it as yet another dumb-down mechanic to make the game easier for the casual players. So many games are falling victim to ""casuals"" because they whine about difficulty rather than taking up a challenge and trying to beat the game with true-honest effort. Numerous games like World Of Warcraft have dumbed-down their gameplay difficulties to make an exception for these players, and it kind of sucks cause the players that love difficulty get screwed out of it, even with max difficulty being applied in the settings.   In any case, I hope that that is an aspect that can be turned off or at least doesn't exist above your ""Hurt Me Plenty"" rating.  TL;DR please don't have the slow-down weapon choice be on all difficulty levels"

gamernews,39vbhl,tekni5,0,Mon Jun 15 13:33:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know where you saw slow in that demo. It looked just as fast as the originals.   The AI isn't really supposed to be super good if you want it to be like the older Doom games, they use hordes of enemies instead. The only thing that looked different to me from the old games was the execution moves when you stagger an enemy (which slowed things down a bit), and the gun selection menu.  I think it looks far closer to the old games than Doom 3."

gamernews,39vbhl,therightclique,5,Mon Jun 15 14:24:32 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed this trailer, because it looked like a shooter that relied on mechanics, not gimmicks (its fun to realize the biggest gimmicks are double jumps and slowmo weapon switch)- and looks like a game that can really show off a players skill.  Plus the atmosphere and enemies scream...doom! It's a run and gun game and it delivers on that.  Plus the snapmaps feature is going to be awesome"
gamernews,39vbhl,SkeetMunnay,3,Mon Jun 15 21:38:59 2015 UTC,"It looked pretty reliant on the visceral style attack, is that not a gimmick in a shooter?"

Not true for the original monsters."
gamernews,39vbhl,therightclique,8,Mon Jun 15 12:06:38 2015 UTC,"FOV quite low. And why does it look and feel as if a Steadycam is moving around those rooms?

I like a lot of things I have seen in this video, but these two things, especially the latter, is screamingly wrong."

With the trend towards ""realism"", there's been a dearth of good arcade shooters.  It's not just nostalgia, and I would hardly call it backwards -- there has been a lot written on the game design of  the original Doom and the experience it was trying to create."
gamernews,39vbhl,aeflash,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:32:05 2015 UTC,"Well, view-bobbing is also a great realism/immersion effect. The Dark Engine games (Thief) make use of it, for example, or the game I mentioned. In a polished game where the creator tried to make everything as good as possible, it belongs. It should be adjustable in strength down to zero, which would satisfy the motion sick people, but it should also be there for those who want to dive in head-first into a roller-coaster of experience."
gamernews,39vbhl,king_of_the_universe,2,Mon Jun 15 21:05:53 2015 UTC,And why does it look and feel as if a Steadycam is moving around those rooms?   It's either a scripted camera or someone extremely practised in making pre-set moves with a gamepad.

The motions look the same to me.  I don't think it's scripted, I guess that there is some considerable camera smoothing going on. I never played 1st person shooters with a gamepad, so I have no idea if this is a normal thing / option, I just took the title ""gameplay"" at face value, so if this level of smoothing is extraordinary, the video might have been made with a few alterations for optimal visual presentation. Minecraft has a strong camera smoothing feature, too, which I have used a few times for making videos. If such a thing is at play here, it might also explain why there is no walk-sway."
gamernews,39vbhl,king_of_the_universe,2,Mon Jun 15 09:45:21 2015 UTC,"The smooth C3P0 like movement is basically what happens with a controller (and why console FPS sucks) and the ""looking at the right thing at the right time"" is someone who has practiced this exact demo a million times.  It's gameplay in the sense that it's someone playing the game -- but everything about the environment in which they're playing is incredibly rehearsed. (I'd argue the same is true for that single player campaign video)"
gamernews,39vbhl,Poddster,2,Mon Jun 15 09:56:35 2015 UTC,"Given how closely tied to the dev team Carmack is I think you can pretty much guarantee the game has been built to be compatible with VR.  Head bobbing is NOT a feature you want while wearing a VR headset.  Lower FOV may also be a bi-product of VR, but you can only speculate. Time will tell. We're going to see a lot of changes to the way FPS games look and feel as they all start getting made with a future of VR headsets in mind. The single player targeted games are going to be the first ones to jump on that bandwagon.  As for adjustable sway, will it sell more because of it? Time is money. They put their time towards what's going to have the largest impact. It's probably a low priority. No matter how easy or difficult you think a feature is, a few hours work(+testing) is still a few hours work that can be put towards a more critical thing."
gamernews,39vbhl,AndThatIsWhyIDrink,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:10:54 2015 UTC,"Head bobbing is NOT a feature you want while wearing a VR headset.   Why not? The bobbing needs to be applied in the correct fashion, of course: The simulated neck-joint needs to move in the appropriate fashion instead of the camera tilting left and right / moving up and down. Are you alluding to a vomit-comet like effect? I don't think that this would be a problem. Some people want to be immersed 100% and throw their minds into it no matter what, which is the kind of person I am. So, if an actual 3D head in that situation would move in a way that this game does not simulate, I guess I would object even more if I were using a VR headset.   Lower FOV may also be a bi-product of VR, but you can only speculate.   That's completely counter-intuitive to me. A VR headset usually gives you an even more filled field of vision than a screen in front of you does, hence the FOV needs to be set even higher.   As for adjustable sway, will it sell more because of it? Time is money.   That's of course the killer argument. The question is: Has this company worked on this product 100% with this attitude? I don't know, and I claim that you don't know, either. Carmack loves games and gaming, that's why we even have the awesome stuff we have today (except someone else would eventually have triggered this development, too). If anyone would see to that those details are proper, I expect him to be the one, even if it costs a few thousand dollars more."
gamernews,39vbhl,king_of_the_universe,3,Mon Jun 15 10:39:43 2015 UTC,"Why not?   In VR any movement that isn't player-derived causes a sensation of motion sickness(sea/car sickness). The body expects to physically feel movement when it sees this, it braces for that movement, but isn't getting that feedback. This messes with your sense of balance and causes you to feel motion sick.  It's not pleasant. NOT pleasant at all. Players can get used to forwards/backwards/sideways movement and jumping because it's physically inputted via the controller apparently. But bobbing etc is really bad. The Mirror's Edge devs are going to have a VERY hard time getting the game to have that cinematic feel of the first game in VR, it's going to be interesting, you can't just put physical rolls into the game, it's going to feel disjointed and cause disorientation.   That's completely counter-intuitive to me. A VR headset usually gives you an even more filled field of vision than a screen in front of you does, hence the FOV needs to be set even higher.   It does, but a more filled field of vision doesn't translate to a higher FOV in-game yet. Even the consumer release of rift isn't going to be 1:1 FOV, and I assume several other headsets aren't going to be either."
gamernews,39vbhl,AndThatIsWhyIDrink,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:50:18 2015 UTC,"In VR any movement   Ah, so it's as I assumed. I bet that I would like it, anyway. I love to trip and to be immersed.   Even the consumer release of rift isn't going to be 1:1 FOV   WUT? If that is indeed so, those people are completely sick in the head. The FOV needs to be aligned with the natural vision, period. Especially if more intense means to experience the visuals (VR sets.) are employed. The FOV needs to be natural.  Hey, maybe this problem and what you said about head-bobbing motion sickness is even related: Might not happen with a natural FOV."
gamernews,39vbhl,king_of_the_universe,2,Mon Jun 15 13:08:26 2015 UTC,"The FOV needs to be aligned with the natural vision, period. Especially if more intense means to experience the visuals (VR sets.) are employed. The FOV needs to be natural.   It doesn't need to be. You can cover 100% of your vision while providing an FOV that's smaller by using the correct lenses.  Presumably there's some serious issue with getting a full 240degree FOV (the FOV of human vision). We're unaware of what the design issues with that are. Right now it's a projected image onto separate lenses for each eye. This covers 100% of vision but provides a smaller in game FOV than your real life FOV. That probably sounds difficult to comprehend, but honestly you don't notice it whatsoever when you're inside. It's quite difficult to explain these things without having actually used one though because you don't have the mental capacity to visualise it without using one. Suffice to say that it's not at all like looking at a screen, more like stepping through a window. You're definitely inside the game, what matters significantly more than FOV is the focal point being infinite and removing the screen door effect, which it is.  As for natural FOV, the FOV sickness has been resolved. It's regular motion sickness, the same as you might get riding a bus, car, or boat with heavy bouncing or start/stopping. There's nothing you can do about it if you're not the person in control. Your body can't compensate for movement outside of its control. Same reason people in control of a car can't get motion sickness from the car, they're the ones controlling the brakes/accelerator and it's the brakes/accelerator that cause the motion sickness. It's the body feeling movement but not visualising that movement (which is why you're told not to read in a car), not seeing the movement that's occurring causes it, essentially the reverse of the VR issue."

gamernews,39vbhl,king_of_the_universe,2,Mon Jun 15 14:27:27 2015 UTC,"Your eyes rotate up to 90degrees. That figure for FOV assumes a directly forward fixed gaze of your eyes, should you turn your eyes completely left or right the figure roughly translates to 240+. The actual figure is 90+180 but this amounts to 270, I have always seen it represented as the screen coverage needing to be 240+ to ensure elimination of visible edges in general current development documentation for VR headsets.  I assume this slightly lower+ figure is used because people can't all turn their eyes the same identical amount? I'm not sure really, it's just the figure that used to get thrown around as the magic number."
gamernews,39vbhl,AndThatIsWhyIDrink,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:31:52 2015 UTC,"Right, that makes sense. While my test just now rather speaks of max. 210 degrees, maybe others experience it differently, and 240 would ensure that no impression of ""It's just a helmet, bro."" would could possibly happen."

Apart from some graphics updates that takes Doom from 1993 to 2000 or so, Brutal Doom focuses on the things that make Doom the near-pinnacle of FPSes: your ability to rend flesh from bone and the feedback you receive that makes you believe in the potency and characteristics of your weapons. It enhances an already extremely polished FPS experience.   iD knew that the technology at the time of Doom 3 couldn't support dozens of monsters, body parts, and blood effects on screen at the same time, so they wisely took it in a different direction entirely. What I see in this Doom 4 gameplay trailer is that they still haven't revisited the things that made Doom great. To me, it looks like fighting monsters results in a few mild blood puffs up until the enemy falls over on the spot. Though far more limited, that's not how Doom feels. In Doom, when you point a shotgun at an enemy it blows them backwards and often rips them open.  I'll try it when it comes out, but I expect I'll still have more fun playing Brutal Doom, which is just the good aspects of Doom turned up to 11."

In all seriousness though, it looks gorgeous and hearing them say that keeping player freedom was still a priority makes me feel that the spirit of the games is still alive and well."
gamernews,39vekd,Instant573,10,Mon Jun 15 03:19:57 2015 UTC,"well, the character creation in 3/NV was pretty terrible.  Good to see they're making it better.  If you watch all their presentation, they cover a lot of new things for FO4"
gamernews,39vekd,opeth10657,-16,Mon Jun 15 03:31:53 2015 UTC,They're going to use this same engine for the rest of this generation.  They're so fracking lazy.
gamernews,39vekd,sonicmerlin,11,Mon Jun 15 04:34:30 2015 UTC,"That's not laziness, that's efficiency. Valve is just switching over to Source 2 from Source 1, which was created in 2004, but they've always been able to manage just fine.   Writing an entirely new engine, from the ground up, is difficult and time-consuming. It takes time away from other tasks and/or delays the game, and it doesn't always benefit things that much, if at all. A big tenant of game development is ""don't reinvent the wheel"".   Besides, most of the time, it's not the engine you use, it's how you use it, especially with an inhouse engine that they can modify to their heart's content (i'm pretty sure Howard mentioned specifically that it was a modified version of the creation engine that they were using)."
gamernews,39vekd,vgman20,3,Mon Jun 15 05:30:09 2015 UTC,"People sometimes forget that hardware limitations invoked a lot of workarounds and produced some fantastic coding and games, all because they had to work with what they had, which wasn't much"
gamernews,39vekd,scoutdalf,-1,Mon Jun 15 13:51:41 2015 UTC,Then I guess we'll see how the game fares upon release.  I'm highly skeptical.  Certainly the ugly character models and poor animations haven't been changed.
gamernews,39vekd,sonicmerlin,-1,Tue Jun 16 09:47:38 2015 UTC,"""Modified"" by adding a couple superficial effects like weather.   A big tenant of game development is ""don't reinvent the wheel"".   gamebryo wasn't even designed to do what Bethesda does with it.  It's an extremely hacked up engine and thus has lots of bugs.  They had years and years.  Literally everyone else developed new engines for the new gen consoles.  Bethesda is just lazy."
gamernews,39vekd,sonicmerlin,4,Tue Jun 16 09:50:18 2015 UTC,"You're right, just superficial things like weather...oh, and greatly enhanced lighting, anti-aliasing, animations, power, etc.   Literally everyone else developed new engines for the new gen consoles.  Bethesda is just lazy.   Hilariously inaccurate. Most games aren't even developed on inhouse engines. Thinking Bethesda is unique in not developing a new engine is absurd."
gamernews,39vekd,vgman20,0,Tue Jun 16 12:49:01 2015 UTC,The animations haven't meaningfully improved in a decade.  The lighting is better but they literally just added volumetric lighting for FO4.  Anti-aliasing... their AA is very limited in comparison to other engines.  I'm talking about the household name engine developers who've gone to great lengths to rework their engines from the ground up.  Even Valve finally updated their Source engine (hallelujah).
gamernews,39vekd,sonicmerlin,5,Wed Jun 17 00:17:21 2015 UTC,They announced a while back they were using the engine for two more games. Skyrim and Fallout 4

gamernews,39vekd,Cheeserd,18,Mon Jun 15 05:22:03 2015 UTC,But the character only says what you want him to say... There's still differing speech options. Have you never played Mass Effect? Or the Witcher? Or Dragon Age? Or any other RPG with a voiced character?

gamernews,39vekd,sufficientlyadvanced,2,Mon Jun 15 17:37:23 2015 UTC,"Why would they need voice acting for quest mods? They can't just have silent dialogue?  And it's not Bethesdas job to cater to modders. They're making a game, and they're not going to fall short of their vision so some random guys can make a mod that doesn't clash with the actual game."
gamernews,39vekd,jWalkerFTW,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:55:40 2015 UTC,"While I do agree that it isn't as severe as he's saying it is, there is a difference between having 7 or 8 different written dialogue options where you can impose your own inner ""voice"" onto the protagonist, and having 4 choices that are voice acted by a single or maybe a couple different actors. Still, I think if executed properly this change could be very positive."

Halo has never done anything super outside the box. It nails the moment to moment gameplay in an interesting story and with beautiful environments. That's what I see happening here except you're adding in squad based combat and even more epic scale.
gamernews,39xmeg,redrabbit33,0,Tue Jun 16 14:46:19 2015 UTC,"You also have not yet played Halo 5. So, let's just wait and see. 343 is an amazing studio composed out of Halo fans. They knocked Halo 4 out of the ballpark. A new studio, formed explicitly for Halo had the sole responsibility to make a new Halo Game. In which universe would that ever be good? Halo 4 was amazing for those facts."

Either that or you finally get to step back into his shoes for the later bit of the game. Either way it's a rehashed plot that's kind of stupid and I gotta say it looks really... bad.

gamernews,39vf6n,pascaldulieu,5,Mon Jun 15 04:05:11 2015 UTC,It's definitely Codsworth.
gamernews,39vf6n,IM_THE_DECOY,6,Mon Jun 15 14:20:35 2015 UTC,"Based on the work they've put into the engine it looks like Bethesda is sticking with their ""next gen"" Gamebryo for this new gen.  Sigh..."
gamernews,39vf6n,sonicmerlin,7,Mon Jun 15 04:12:05 2015 UTC,"I've heard they've been working on it since the release of FO3. If so, it doesn't surprise me they'd use the same engine."
gamernews,39vf6n,xMZA,-1,Mon Jun 15 05:17:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly, engines do not matter. They are just tools to make a game with. They could rebuild a new engine from scratch but all the same Bethesda style things would still be there, and super noticeable."
gamernews,39vf6n,BARDLER,4,Mon Jun 15 07:24:16 2015 UTC,Engines very much matter. Where did you get the idea that they don't?
gamernews,39vf6n,Baryn,8,Mon Jun 15 11:07:27 2015 UTC,"I have worked with 4 different engines. The only differences is the tools that are there to make the game, but the end product is almost entirely based on developer choice. The most important thing for a game engine is speed of which the final game can be achieved. Introducing a new game engine adds a ton of time to the development cycles, and potentially adds a ton of bugs since the studio has never shipped a game with it.  An engine is just a frame work, and for Bethesda they make a very specific type of game, and they know exactly what they need their engine to do. The most important things for them are open world streaming, rapid content creation, day cycles, systems balancing, and mission design. Like I said, they could build a brand new fancy engine or add-on to one of the engines that you can license out there, but the Bethesda style wouldn't change. Their games would always have the same quarks and problems because that is based on creative/art direction, and less on what they build their game with."
gamernews,39vf6n,BARDLER,5,Mon Jun 15 15:15:21 2015 UTC,"I authored an engine for an indie game, but have also worked with the big engines. While I agree with your sentiments to a point, I feel strongly that the craftsperson's tools leave their mark on the work.   Even a neophyte can sense an Unreal Engine title vs a Unity title vs a Flash title, you know?"
gamernews,39vf6n,Baryn,2,Mon Jun 15 15:46:47 2015 UTC,"That's true in the case of using the engine straight out of the box. There are plenty examples of games that break away from that though. Hearthstone runs on Unity, and Boarderlands runs on UE3.  Edit- I would also like to add, that gamers think to much about engines. They don't matter to the gamers is my main point."
gamernews,39vf6n,BARDLER,-4,Mon Jun 15 16:58:05 2015 UTC,"I'm tired of the plastic looking characters and ugly animation transitions.  There are so many bugs in their games as well, despite them using and updating the same engine since Morrowind."
gamernews,39vf6n,sonicmerlin,4,Mon Jun 15 21:07:39 2015 UTC,"plastic looking characters = Shader tech, not engine dependent.  animation transitions = Strictly animation budget both in game ram/space allocation, and animators to actually do the work.  bugs = These can be engine specific, but this has more the pipeline/schedule that Bethesda works on. They tend to squash all their bugs and make a polished build after 3-5 patches."
gamernews,39vf6n,BARDLER,-1,Tue Jun 16 02:43:37 2015 UTC,"The engine limits what kinds of technologies you can apply.  By transitions I'm talking about the abrupt shifts in character movement, as well as the overall physics of the animations.  It's just so ugly and stocky, especially compared to what's out there now."

That concern might hold no weight but you only have limited man power and they probably decided to implement this instead of some other smaller features.

gamernews,39vhug,tartay745,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:24:02 2015 UTC,That's always good news.  I'm always for innovation and new ideas being injected into franchises as long as we see the core game stay the main focus.  Now I just have to make it through the witcher before Fallout comes out.

I had NEVER thought of such a thing! /s    No one said anything about a game matching a creators vision 100% so what are you on about? What I said was that new shit can be added without sacrificing all the other good shit we know and love. This is because the team and budget grew exponentially thanks to the success of games like Skyrim. So the idea that the building took away from anything is silly, baseless even. I hope you understand now."

So... you're saying that you agree that the game won't perfectly match Bethesda's vision for it, but that they didn't have to sacrifice anything to work within time and budget constraints... I'm sorry, but aren't those things kind of mutually exclusive? All I'm saying is that it's entirely possible that they may have had to scrap potential features to implement something new and significant like building structures."
gamernews,39vhug,toThe9thPower,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:37:19 2015 UTC,I never said they sacrificed nothing. I said that adding this new content does not mean the old will suffer. I was never arguing that they never scrapped anything WTF dude? The other person was talking as if the new modding/building could have taken away from CORE GAMEPLAY we know and expect from Fallout. I explained that this isn't likely because they had more budget/resources/manpower to create this game.

There is no worse combination. However, people should still feel like they can point out a trailer / review is underwhelming without worrying about fanboys downvoting them.

gamernews,39y0a6,Veritasgear,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:47:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed anything negative immediately attracts downvotes even if it is a legitimate criticism.   The last good one for me was Reach. I loved Reach's multiplayer. Halo 4 is playable but by no means my favorite entry. 343 ditching splitscreen for me is what lost my purchase for Halo 5.   One of the only reasons i get halo is to play with my friends, I hate this new push to make everything online only. Thankfully with the new backwards compatibility i can play Reach again"
gamernews,39y0a6,jazir5,2,Mon Jun 15 21:18:53 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I played a lot of reach, though not nearly as much H2/3, but I'd be lying to claim I did not get my moneys worth. I just hated a majority of the levels, hated perks, even if I was a top-tier armor lock abuser, I just wanted equipment back. Sprinting really is what I feel I always fall back on pinpointing what ""ruined"" halo for me. Sprinting brought new level design goals, and it just took away the feel. That and of course the loadouts, and how long it took them to fix shield bleed and whatnot.   I don't have the next gen consoles, so it hardly matters to me. But I just feel like Microsoft truly is just dragging the series through the mud knowing they'll make millions regardless of what they put out, and it just makes me so sad."
gamernews,39y0a6,darkm0d,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:31:26 2015 UTC,"They are, and 343 needs to gutted and redone. Their design goals are framing halo as a different game than the earlier ones, it certainly feels different.   Going to have to disagree with you on the sprint tho, that happens to be my favorite addition. The worst thing for me in earlier halos was almost making it behind barriers and getting killed when i'm like an inch away.   Sprint adds needed movement speed to halo. They could maybe adjust the sprint speeds tho, it doesn't feel right in 4 and it was ok when i played the 5 beta. I forget what reach's was like it's been so long"

The fact that DayZ is heading to Xbox Game Preview clearly in Alpha/Beta shows that it is still a while away from even being close to finished on PC, let alone on Xbox One. I'm not sure if this is a good move? I wonder how PC gamers feel that time will be spent porting it to Xbox One when the game isn't even finished on PC and has been in development for over two years now."

Each ""update"" brings brand new massive changes that either break multiple things at once or completely change the way you have to play.  Recently in one patch you had to spend like an entire hour just picking apples off a tree so you could even try to walk to the next town before you starved to death.  Path before that there was almost no loot.  Patch before that you died of hunger within 20 mins.  It's absurd.  I don't understand their game design process even fractionally as their work style makes absolutely no sense.  It took what, two years for them to FINALLY add working vehicles?  I mean come on, I love the IDEA of Dayz but the Standalone is basically shit and if they try to make you pay for an equally shit (if not shittier) current ""beta"" game on Xbox1 that fucking pure greed and bullshit, nothing else.  Fuck you guys, you make more promises that lay broken at your feet than you make godamn clothing models.  Maybe make your godamn Standalone PC game playable before you fuck up and divide your development staff in half and have 2 unplayable games that everyone uses as examples of broken dreams."

I think they're either going for the burgeoning idio-, I mean, ""Freemium"" market or just trying to cash in on their IP without doing much real work. Hearth Stone is a similar idea from Activision-Blizzard. I really pray they are working on The Elder Scrolls VI right now.

gamernews,39pe4m,BARDLER,2,Sun Jun 14 02:01:40 2015 UTC,"Wow I didn't realize how unpopular my opinion was. I don't know, to me the action was extremely repetitive, it felt like just one long dessert chase with little dialogue and almost no character development. Beyond the random goons getting kicked off over and over and cars flipping and explosions, I didn't feel like there was anything terribly entertaining about the whole thing. The story lacked substance to me."
gamernews,39pe4m,rasheemo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:59:13 2015 UTC,"I agree in that that it lacked development in a lot of ways, but the action was batshit insane, which is why it's loved so much.  If they had taken more of a Road Warrior approach to the story and kept the same crazy action sequences (albeit fewer) it could have been a masterpiece.  To me though, it's still really awesome.  I believe there's also a sequel in the works that could possibly explore more of the world behind the action"

gamernews,39pe4m,fire815,8,Sat Jun 13 19:54:15 2015 UTC,not bad at all. It has that Banner Saga feel to it
gamernews,39pe4m,wakuku,3,Sat Jun 13 17:01:57 2015 UTC,Their kickstarter video tells bit more about the world and background of the game. I really like the art style of the game. Hope it's going to be good.

gamernews,39pe4m,wakuku,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:15:42 2015 UTC,And the engine lends greatly to gameplay. You don't build a RTS on the Unreal engine for example.

Taking the same mechanics and creating an intentionally cliche post-apocalyptic setting to put on top of them doesn't do anything nearly as interesting.
gamernews,39pesd,Poustache,6,Sat Jun 13 13:39:07 2015 UTC,"I've played the game for 4 months now, and it's absolutely fantastic.

gamernews,39qvum,Jedakiah,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:06:08 2015 UTC,"That tend to be the problem with PhysX-specific effects. The Borderlands series has the same problem, where PhysX on Ultra fills the screen with extremely annoying particles and bouncy bits that are exaggerated and prevents you from seeing the enemies around you at times.  I feel Witcher 3's use of Nvidia Hairwork is sorta on the other end of the spectrum since it doesn't contribute to anything 99% of the time it is enabled. I'm not sure if it's a bug but whenever I have it enabled Geralt's hair stops moving in the wind, almost as if it's too heavy to be moved. The 'Hairworks Disabled' hair moves in the wind, though, so I sorta prefer playing with that option instead."
gamernews,39qvum,Aemony,2,Sun Jun 14 05:55:03 2015 UTC,"That's a bug. With hairworks on even his whiskers will flutter in the wind, and of course strands of hair too. It's likely your computer isn't powerful enough for hairworks. When the computer is too slow the game aborts special effects as gracefully as it can instead of dropping frames, but then weird visual bugs happen."

gamernews,39jk0q,SirSaltie,0,Fri Jun 12 06:00:45 2015 UTC,How is the consumer Rift an empty promise? They nailed everything they set out to create. They could have shipped Devkits out as the finished product years ago but they waited. They waited until they could improve the Rift and each iteration has jumped in quality drastically. From shitty 720p to 1080p to 1200p. With higher frame rates each time as well. They said they are showing these off at E3 which is just a few days away. So what are you guys on about?
gamernews,39jk0q,toThe9thPower,9,Fri Jun 12 07:22:44 2015 UTC,"Talking specifically about those handheld controls, I have no beef with the VR headset."
gamernews,39jk0q,SirSaltie,-1,Fri Jun 12 07:29:56 2015 UTC,"Right but if they are planning to show them off literally in 3 days, I don't see why you are acting like this is some sort of empty promise. Why? Because he didn't show them off immediately at his presentation? It isn't even uncommon for a product to be announced like this. So why assume it is an empty promise?"
gamernews,39jk0q,toThe9thPower,3,Fri Jun 12 07:37:03 2015 UTC,So wait 3 days before you form an opinion. You are talking like no tech company has ever flopped on their promise
gamernews,39jk0q,gengis,-5,Fri Jun 12 13:05:09 2015 UTC,"You are acting like Oculus has a history of not delivering on their promises. They never have, they could have cashed in on those Devkits and just mass produced the shit out of them. People would have bought millions. But they waited until the tech was matured, until they could deliver the best VR experience. They do not have a history of lying, or failing to meet expectations. So it is utter bullshit to claim this controller is an empty promise.    FUCK. It is a controller! lol. They deliver on a brand new technology, an industry they essentially created, and you think they are going to fuck up a controller?

It's pretty rare to have a middle ground unfortunately. At least for very long.

gamernews,39jk0q,jnethery,2,Fri Jun 12 13:31:55 2015 UTC,"The problem with the Wiimote was that it was overly intergrated into the Wii games, to the point it actually detracted from the experience. Look at Donkey Kong Country Returns. You have to shake the wiimote just to attack? Same with New Super Mario Bro and Mario galaxy. These functions would have been better for just buttons. IMO Zelda and Wiisports were the only games to use the motion controls in an intuitive way.   This is why for this to really work it would require a lot of work on the developers part. You couldn't play a traditional shooter with full incorporation of this."
gamernews,39jk0q,megatom0,0,Fri Jun 12 14:08:40 2015 UTC,"The whole feel of the controller really. The thinness of it makes it float around in my hand, button layout just feels terrible to me, and the weight of the controller is just too light.  I have never played a game using a Wii controller with the nunchuck and enjoyed the experience.  The Touch seems like they merged a nunchuck into the wiimote. Which makes me leery of it.  I am not saying its bad, since I haven't actually used the product(obviously), but I don't have high hopes."
gamernews,39jk0q,Malace85,3,Sat Jun 13 04:35:46 2015 UTC,"I would say it really depends on the game. WiiMote + Nunchuck worked very well for Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword. It's serviceable for Mario Kart, although I prefer the Gamepad for that. Any game I've played that was designed around the WiiMote has worked pretty flawlessly, although as a caveat I am using the WiiU, not the original Wii."
gamernews,39jk0q,jnethery,2,Fri Jun 12 14:46:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, honestly I felt like the Wii Motion + controls really started to be understood with Skyward Sword and while it had its issues (de-syncing), the actual controls felt flawless to me. It did EXACTLY what I wanted it to do. It is a shame that it was right at the end of the console that it worked out that way because it was so smooth by that point and I didn't think we'd see something like it again."
gamernews,39jk0q,schemmey,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:50:17 2015 UTC,"To me it looks like that. The Wii proved that motion controls are only good if the games is specifically built around that. Also I think everyone has had enough of ""shake controller to do this action"". Also didn't that game Jurassic Park Tresspasser prove that doing real hand motions wasn't great. Granted that is a very dated game but I think the awkwardness still applies.  However I feel like this might actually be something better not for games but just general experiences. What the presenter describes here of being able to play with virtual objects sounds really fun to me if it feels right. I honestly wouldn't mind having life size action figures I could play with just by using my hands. Also something like Grow Home would be kind of fun."
gamernews,39jk0q,megatom0,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:56:58 2015 UTC,"Naw, this is diffrent.  Wii motion did motion tracking in a extremely simplistic way. Have very bad accuracy, but close enough for it was used for.  When you test VR (I have tested GearVR and CrystalCove), it´s a diffrent thing all together. It´s the difference between playing a game and experiencing a game. When you talk about games you have tried, you talk about things you have experienced, because some of the things feels so real. But what is missing is a good way to not only look around, but to interact with the environment that makes more sense, then pushing a analog stick forward, or to waggle a wiimote  See those small dot´s on the Oculus controllers, those are basically led lights. A small camera that you put on your screen or where prefer basically film those dot´s and figure out the exact position of those in a 3D enviroment. The technology is similar to what Wiimotes uses, but in revers (camera was in the wiimote).  The problem the VR community is in, is that there are no one controller to rule them all. Because keyboard and mouse don´t translate well in a 3D enviroment, and your regular gamepad does not do that either.  So now it´s a fight to see who can come up with the best setup. We don´t know yet how good these are until they are tested at e3. Valve/HTC has a huge advantage so far. They have controllers and a headset that can be tracked in a room with an extremely good precision, and they are launching first.   Then we have magic leap, no one really knows what they are doing, or if it´s just vaporware, but google just invested $500 000 000 in them. But if what they are saying is not bullshit, it will blow everything out of the water.  So what does this mean? Well the company that takes the lead in this will get the developers behind them, and the developers will basically say, use this to play our awesome games. And this will spiral in to more consumers buying the product that the developers recommend that leads to more developers developing games for the system.  As this is the first serious stab at real VR no one really knows what will happen. But a good bet is that the best experience will set the pace for future of VR."

I imagine having gloves with something akin to muscle fibers that can provide resistance and haptic feedback when a current is applied would be the best solution.   That way the feedback would change with the objects you were interacting with in a world. Triggers on weapons could feel like triggers. You could 'grip' the handle of a melee weapon, etc."

gamernews,39h23s,willkydd,21,Tue Jun 16 23:12:22 2015 UTC,"I own the DK2 (Developer Kit2) and I have to say, this thing is pretty neat and almost indescribable as it is, and the consumer version is sposed to be even better.   Downsides:   Sim sickness (like motion sickness basically) is really easy to get if the developers haven't done much research into the causes and take certain precautions in their design of the UI and control/movement scheme. Even with those precautions, you can still get sim sick, but can become acclimated. I read somewhere that the owner of Oculus is actually quite prone to sim sickness himself.  You need a good machine (min specs are something like an nvidia 970?) to have reliable performance. This is also important to combat sim sickness because if the framerate doesn't keep up with a certain value, head tracking and vision lags behind your actual movements and that will cause you to get sick.  Resolution. The current DK2 has pretty low resolution making text kind of difficult to read and such. The consumer model is supposed to have higher resolution which will hopefully make this a non issue.   Pros: Surprisingly a lot of content VR ready even in development phase. Officially this is not a retail product yet but there's many things you can do with it already.  VR is really interesting, not just for games but for art as well. It can also add an interesting layer of social interaction that one wouldn't expect. For example, on Convrge /r/convrge you're just a floating avatar head, BUT that head moves and tracks your real movement in world. So while you're talking to people, you can see their expressive body language (if they're the type to move around a bit while talking) and that's pretty neat. Imagine how it'll be when hands are thrown in there too.   There's more but this is what pops to mind.  Also, Facebook, I haven't seen nor heard anything about facebook since they came on board or whatever. I've seen no branding, nothing, zilch, zero. That's not to say that it wont come but I'm pretty sure that if anything, facebook just wants to have it succeed for the social implications (VR Chat and such)  The headphones are supposedly optional (removeable) and are there to help with immersion. When a developer has a set 'standard' of audio that they can work with on the hardware side, they can fine tune the auditory experience for that hardware specifically for optimal immersion or ""presence"" as it's called in VR circles. (The feeling of ""being there"")   Vive looks really neat! And I hope it is awesome and successful as well. I personally hope that the market doesn't get ""split"" or more specifically, that software development efforts don't get split, that the end user can just choose whichever hardware they prefer and use either or. This would be the best route for the VR market, as like many people my age, we've all seen VR come and go and come and go and flop each time. This time it really feels like they've got it nailed down and are really addressing all the nuances to things."

gamernews,39h23s,phatcrits,2,Thu Jun 11 23:05:32 2015 UTC,"So, if you normally don't wear glassing for gaming because you only need them for distance... will you need them for Oculus since it effectively simulates depth and objects will appear far away to your eyes?"

The comparisons I have seen have also erroneously compared the DK2, with the Vive. The DevKit 2 is a joke compared to the specs of the Consumer Rift, or even that of the Crescent Bay prototype. So, how is that a fair comparison? The DK2 was not running at a high enough resolution or frame rate to have ""presence"" and this is something Oculus themselves even talked about endlessly."

I hope you are not debating that. It is most definitely resolution, frame rate, and head tracking. Those are the 3 biggest factors, among others as well but if you picked only 3? It should be those ones."

gamernews,39h23s,SurelyDrunk,-2,Fri Jun 12 02:24:16 2015 UTC,Even a slight difference in quality of presence will be massive with VR. It really isn't comparable to playing Skyrim on a 5:4 monitor. You would be better off saving up and going with the one that offers the best presence regardless of price.   EDIT: Also what is the Vives price? I am seeing that the Vive will actually cost MORE than the Rift.
gamernews,39h23s,toThe9thPower,0,Fri Jun 12 02:36:12 2015 UTC,This is a bullshit comment given that the Vive is only a dev kit and is totally going to be better for release.
gamernews,39h23s,CaptnAwesomeGuy,-2,Fri Jun 12 16:35:03 2015 UTC,"Except for that isn't true you idiot. The Vive is essentially complete. Valve used this as a SELLING POINT for fucks sake. The product is shipping later this year. It is not going to drastically change. That is a fact, one Valve has stated endlessly. So the specs they have now are locked down."
gamernews,39h23s,toThe9thPower,0,Sat Jun 13 02:43:29 2015 UTC,Nope lol. Cameras are going to be added. Specs could improve. That's why it's called a goddamned dev kit.

No. The specs are not going to change drastically, and the price is also going to be higher than what the Rift is shooting for.    http://gizmodo.com/htc-vive-this-is-valves-virtual-reality-headset-1688756062    Unlike other virtual reality headsets, which have surfaced as early prototypes with a developer version off on the horizon, the HTC Vive is virtually done.    The idea that the Vive still has major improvements to make is not accurate. The headset comes out THIS YEAR. That means it isn't even possible for the headset to improve drastically. The Rift grew by leaps and bounds because it started out with such an early prototype, and they had a few years to get to where they are with the consumer Rift.     This was literally a selling point of the Vive. They wanted people to know that the headset was essentially done, and ready to go. None of this years of waiting shit.    So, you are wrong."

Because I have read nothing of the sort. People have talked about still being able to ""see"" the pixels in the Vive, while in the final consumer Rift, this is no longer an issue.      They already have a huge delivery platform and a network of developers.   Unless Steam is going to block people from using a Rift with all Steam games, this really isn't going to change anything. Those network of developers? They will make games for Oculus as well.     Even if Oculus can compete on hardware, Valve will absolutely destroy them on developer support.   Oculus is years ahead of Valve when it comes to developer support. They have been at it for far longer.      Portal on VR?

If that's true, then they've already won my vote, because Oculus made me sick quick.  I don't know why you think it's fair to compare the pixels density of the development version of Vive to the current version of Oculus. It's really silly if you're basing your sense of hardware on that.  Oculus is a new company and they still don't have a product or revenue stream. They have to build developer relationships from scratch, so it doesn't matter that they have a head start. Valve is far ahead of them when it comes to developer relationships. I don't know how much that will matter, because I don't know how easy it is to port from one system to the other, but if it does matter, then Valve has the advantage.  Whatever the case, it's better to have multiple platforms competing. It will force them all to work harder to put the best shit out."
gamernews,39h23s,MyOtherAltIsAHuman,-6,Thu Jun 11 22:14:50 2015 UTC,"Gabe said that they've solved motion sickness, and that not a single person has ever gotten sick using Vive. If that's true, then they've already won my vote, because Oculus made me sick quick.   So you have not even used it, and have no idea if it will make you sick or not, but choose it before trying it out? Also any motion sickness the Rift might have had would be fixed by simply upping the resolution and frame rate. What version of the Rift did you even use? I know damn well it wasn't the Crescent Bay.      I don't know why you think it's fair to compare the pixels density of the development version of Vive to the current version of Oculus.   Did you not just compare a development version of the Rift with a product you have not even used when it came to motion sickness? Also you fail with this argument because they have stated very clearly that the Vive is essentially finished and will launch THIS YEAR. Its specs are not going to change. Definitely not the screen.      Oculus is a new company and they still don't have a product or revenue stream.   Yes with a metric shit fuck ton of resources at their disposal. As well as the most talented/experienced VR team ever assembled.     Valve is far ahead of them when it comes to developer relationships.    No they are not because Oculus has been at this VR thing for much longer. They already have exclusive titles in development. Valve isn't going to have some massive advantage just because they have made games before. This is an entirely new market.      Whatever the case, it's better to have multiple platforms competing. It will force them all to work harder to put the best shit out.   Absolutely. But everything else you have claimed is pretty inaccurate and silly."

So the audio you get from them will be more accurate than the audio you get from some other pair of headphones.      EDIT: Good lord if you look at the Rift, you can see the earbuds are removable.

gamernews,39h23s,toThe9thPower,4,Fri Jun 12 00:09:58 2015 UTC,Also you neglect the fact that those earpads locations are calculated properly.    I'll go ahead and say that you're totally wrong on that one.
gamernews,39h23s,chileangod,-6,Fri Jun 12 05:19:24 2015 UTC,"But I am not? Each pair of headphones is different, so using some random pair you own, no matter how awesome they are, is not necessarily going to give you as accurate an audio presence as the earbuds on the Oculus might. They are high quality, they are not some shitty knock off 20 dollar pair of earbuds or something. If I am wrong, how about giving an actual counter argument instead of this fallacy laden bullshit?"
gamernews,39h23s,toThe9thPower,2,Thu Jun 11 19:42:35 2015 UTC,Read the quote.  You specifically point some sort of positional configuration of the headphones will result in a bad audio experience.  I say as long as each speaker of the headphone is pressed against your ear it will not screw the effect.  Of course the output will change with the speaker itself but not the geometrical position. I mean...  I don't think everyone has their ears in the same points of space with respect to the hmd.
gamernews,39h23s,chileangod,-1,Thu Jun 11 19:58:08 2015 UTC,What? NO. I was not saying it would result in a bad audio experience. I said that the headphones that come with the Rift would have more accurate audio because of the fact that developers will know the exact position of the headphones. So the idea that these are a terrible option is complete shenanigans.
gamernews,39h23s,toThe9thPower,2,Thu Jun 11 21:20:04 2015 UTC,So you say that the headphones on the rift don't swivel at all to position themselves on the ears of the user?
gamernews,39h23s,chileangod,0,Thu Jun 11 21:27:13 2015 UTC,"Here from another comment that might explain it better than I did, unless you're being intentionally obtuse?     The headphones are supposedly optional (removeable) and are there to help with immersion. When a developer has a set 'standard' of audio that they can work with on the hardware side, they can fine tune the auditory experience for that hardware specifically for optimal immersion or ""presence"" as it's called in VR circles. (The feeling of ""being there"")"
gamernews,39h23s,toThe9thPower,6,Thu Jun 11 23:24:07 2015 UTC,Ok.  But there's no mention about geometry or positioning of the headphones.  I'm not arguing the rest.  Just that one comment about knowing the position of the headphones being a huge factor.  That's all.
gamernews,39h23s,Jedakiah,-3,Thu Jun 11 23:31:45 2015 UTC,"But it is. It lets the developer work with a standard audio peripheral, and they can tweak their experience to suit those headphones on the device. Meaning you could have better ""presence"" than you have with other audio devices."
gamernews,39h23s,toThe9thPower,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:45:22 2015 UTC,"I don't want to argue, I just hoped you would find this interesting. People's ear locations vary greatly, even from side-to-side. If you pay attention, you will notice a ton of people have an ear higher on one side, or further back. Just ask anyone who sells glasses, and they will point out how common this is. Ordinary headphones do a pretty decent job of compensating for this as they usually have enough flexibility to still be worn a bit lopsided or crooked. The Vive however provides very little flexibility in the band, which is why the headphones allow you to independently move each of them up/down and swivel back and forth.  The point of all this is that it will actually be harder, or at least take more effort, to get the Vive's speakers positioned properly (where ordinary headphones naturally rest). The improved sound quality mentioned in the article has nothing to do with the Vive's speakers physical location. Rather it is talking about how we can create more accurate sounds when we know specifically which speakers will be playing those sounds. Usually we tune things to an ambiguous lowest common denominator of cheap headphones. We have to worry about whether things will sound too muddy, too quiet, or induce static, on some speakers. However, we do not have to worry about that when we are listening on the very same speakers our audience will be."

The fact that the earbuds are directly over the ear means that each person can simply move them to be directly on their ears, and they are fine. Having these as default will always have a greater chance of being more accurate than some random pair of headphones that could have a million different variations. The size of the headphones, how deep the cups are, how they are positioned... it will always be less accurate than the earbuds the Rift comes with."

gamernews,39h23s,tahiko,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:36:12 2015 UTC,"Virtual reality:       Virtual Reality (VR), which can be referred to as immersive multimedia or computer-simulated life, replicates an environment that simulates physical presence in places in the real world or imagined worlds. Virtual reality can recreate sensory experiences, which include virtual taste, sight, smell, sound, and touch.  Most up to date virtual reality environments are displayed either on a computer screen or with special stereoscopic displays, and some simulations include additional sensory information and emphasise real sound through speakers or headphones targeted towards VR users. Some advanced, haptic, systems now include tactile information, generally known as force feedback in medical, gaming and military applications. Furthermore, virtual reality covers remote communication environments which provide virtual presence of users with the concepts of telepresence and telexistence or a virtual artifact (VA) either through the use of standard input devices such as a keyboard and mouse, or through multimodal devices such as a wired glove or omnidirectional treadmills. The simulated environment can be similar to the real world in order to create a lifelike experience—for example, in simulations for pilot or combat training—or it differs significantly from reality, such as in VR games. In practice, it is currently very difficult to create a high-fidelity virtual reality experience, because of technical limitations on processing power, image resolution, and communication bandwidth. However, VR's proponents hope that virtual reality's enabling technologies become more powerful and cost effective over time.  Virtual reality is often used to describe a wide variety of applications commonly associated with immersive, highly visual, 3D environments. The development of CAD software, graphics hardware acceleration, head-mounted displays, datagloves, and miniaturization have helped popularize the notion. In the book The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality by Michael R. Heim, seven different concepts of virtual reality are identified: simulation, interaction, artificiality, immersion, telepresence, full-body immersion, and network communication. People often identify VR with head mounted displays and data suits. [citation needed]    Image i - U.S. Navy personnel using a mock VR parachute trainer.

gamernews,39f7lf,IHideMyBlade,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:38:14 2015 UTC,I remember when I couldn't afford the game so I pirated it and there was an anti-piracy glitch somewhere in the second level. I bought the game some time after that :p

gamernews,39f7lf,starmatter,5,Thu Jun 11 19:07:13 2015 UTC,Except DMC was a poor game regardless of dantes new design and personality and it was used as an excuse by people who don't know the first thing about character action games as to why people disliked it.

gamernews,39f7lf,Animitch,3,Thu Jun 11 19:57:49 2015 UTC,But when the majority of them praises a game it must mean something...
gamernews,39f7lf,starmatter,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:47:09 2015 UTC,"Plenty of games get consistently praised and end up being terrible, it's the business of games."
gamernews,39f7lf,ShellWithMe,-2,Sat Jun 13 10:25:26 2015 UTC,Yet anyone who played the previous DMC games compared to the new DmC can tell you the game is slow and clunky and had lots of issues when compared to the old ones. Not to mention the story was idiotic. You'll learn soon enough that most reviewers are full of shit and give the game a score according to how much they are paid.
gamernews,39f7lf,FJSpoof,2,Thu Jun 11 19:58:21 2015 UTC,The story was idiotic? It was far better than any pseudo story the others had. How was the game slow? We certainly didn't play the same game. The combat was amazing!
gamernews,39f7lf,starmatter,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:46:27 2015 UTC,"The combat was nearly half the speed of any previous Devil May Cry game. . . Even the FPS was half the speed. (At least the ""Definitive Edition"" fixes this) Not to mention the whole ""Blue enemies killed with blue weapon only, and red enemies killed with red weapon only"" Needlessly broke up the flow of combat. It was quite annoying. The combats combo meter was also strangely just based on how much damage you do, rather than how varied and intensive your combos actually were. You could score a triple S rating with one attack with the axe. Really?  Edit: Also, how could I forget. NO LOCKON?!  But if you want to see some of the differences in combat, go check out the player Brea on youtube. Watch some of their DMC3/4 combo videos and then watch their DmC one. While both are pretty impressive, the DmC ones animation cancels halt the combat, to the point where he could literally just float in the air indefinitely by doing and canceling one move with the scythe.   The story bit is subjective. I think it was stupid as hell compared to the old games. Not to mention how neat the ORIGINAL vision of DmC looked. They changed so much of the original to make it more like the old DMC/Dante. Go watch the original reveal trailer, and compare it to later trailers or the actual games story and Dante. The old one looked way more interesting than what we got in my opinion.  All of this said, theres plenty of things I like about the game, and I still enjoyed playing it. Slower combat aside, it was still fun to play through. I thought that soundtrack was awesome, the level design and level art direction was really cool. Seeing the environment transform was really neat."

gamernews,39f7lf,Endevour,6,Thu Jun 11 18:46:08 2015 UTC,"She was always designed fairly atypically, and questions of her sexuality have been raised since the first game. As well as a lot of dudes salty about how her tits aren't big enough for their taste.  It's a first-person game. Don't even worry about it. You're gonna see her hands and her legs and that's about it."
gamernews,39f7lf,BostonTentacleParty,0,Thu Jun 11 23:12:41 2015 UTC,"I liked her design at first, and it's true what you're saying; being a first person game you only see her hands and feet. So why change her design? Of course what I said comes off as a gross generalization, but I feel I see more and more female characters being attributed masculine features througout development. Dragon Age Inquisition comes to ming."
gamernews,39f7lf,Endevour,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:59:05 2015 UTC,"Faith has never been a particularly feminine character. They specifically designed her to be tough and athletic and muscular—none of which are attributed to traditional femininity. The only big changes here are that they softened her features and lengthened her hair. That doesn't strike me as a ""bull dyke"" shift.  But even if it were, I don't really see what the problem is with that. I resent the notion that any step away from strict femininity is inherently bull dyke, but I also think that if anything we could use more lesbian representation in games."
gamernews,39f7lf,BostonTentacleParty,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:32:55 2015 UTC,"In western games there's hardly any lack of lesbian representation. In  almost any RPG, there's a possibility of gay romance. At this point I'm seeing the exact opposite; a lack of representation for really feminine characters. Even the straigt women are all typical gung-ho stronk womyn."
gamernews,39f7lf,Endevour,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:52:14 2015 UTC,"That seems to be more of an issue with the stories we're telling in games. I'd love to see more feminine male protagonists, as well. But we're really hung up on action-heavy stories that lend themselves to ""typical gung-ho strong womyn"" and myn.   But honestly, they're still mostly featuring men over women so I'm not even gonna complain in the instances when they're bringing more women into the stories I'm playing.   In almost any RPG, there's a possibility of gay romance.   Ooo, optional romances in a small subset of a small genre of games made in the last 6 years! Yeah, that's all we could ever want, really. 9_9  Seriously, besides Bioware games it's basically zilch. But yes, Bioware has done a decent job with the Mass Effect and Dragon Age games."

gamernews,39aq4e,xxdofxx,7,Thu Jun 11 01:57:30 2015 UTC,A three hour game? Better not cost $70.
gamernews,39aq4e,OrbisTerre,6,Thu Jun 11 02:59:35 2015 UTC,So you're stuck in space and you have to #dealwithit?
gamernews,39aq4e,KingSlizzard,2,Wed Jun 10 14:36:53 2015 UTC,Well I liked it. The trailer does a good job at making you feel desperate. Until two minutes ago I had no idea this existed.
gamernews,39aq4e,t4nt4lus,2,Wed Jun 10 18:24:24 2015 UTC,"Got to demo this at VR LA. I normally don't get motion sickness but I definitely felt dizzy from this game. I think it was the difference between the suit's motion and moving my FOV around.  Regardless, it was a fun experience and the devs seem like great guys so I hope it does well."
gamernews,39aq4e,ONZO,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:38:06 2015 UTC,I expect there'd be some hardcore players who would put up with motion sickness for this game considering the character they're playing as would no doubt be just as susceptible to it in this situation.

gamernews,39aq4e,creampuff_dojo,0,Wed Jun 10 15:53:15 2015 UTC,Big difference in a soundtrack and stupid sound effects.  It would be like using the sound of a cannon when someone lights a match.
gamernews,39aq4e,master_dong,2,Wed Jun 10 16:11:35 2015 UTC,A lot of games explain this away by saying the suit simulates sound. I know it's probably just an oversight but I like to think its the suit for every countless form of media that does this
gamernews,39aq4e,chiloutus,2,Wed Jun 10 19:08:36 2015 UTC,"It's there for effect, it's not an oversight. People know what they're doing."
gamernews,39aq4e,Aksen,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:04:39 2015 UTC,"Well, when you bump into things, the vibrations would travel through the suit and through the air inside of it, so you would hear it."
gamernews,39aq4e,Spawn_Beacon,5,Thu Jun 11 02:29:37 2015 UTC,"It was done for cinematic effect and well I might add. You don't know what is going on other than a slow drift and set up a stunning view. The music gives an atmosphere of melancholy. The rumble and the ship break us from this to destruction. It's followed by heavy breathing, heartbeats, radio interference, and helmet changes. I don't demand scientific perfection in video games if they deliver great moments like that."
gamernews,39aq4e,TheLongGame,6,Fri Jun 12 06:39:12 2015 UTC,"No but srsly, who's playing the piano?"
gamernews,39aq4e,RainOfAshes,5,Wed Jun 10 16:50:28 2015 UTC,"in the game the astronauts are fit with a sort of intuitive ipod; music from an enormous library and integrated with biometric monitors, advanced AI and hundreds of hours of behavioral learning make it so that the music that is pumped into said astronaut changes to appropriately accent the mood/biometrics of the designed listener seamlessly in any situation (the program is called Score).   in this case it looks like the AI interpreted the situation with Moonlight Sonata."

You construct, seek, destroy, attack and defend in a classic tactical map view. What set's this game apart is that the in game map is a map of your real world neighbourhood. If you construct a giant turret at the corner of your street, and you travel to said corner, you'll see your giant turret in AR mode, as well as the battle that rages there. From this mode you can fight the alien invasion in first person and deploy various airstrikes and tactical abilities.  All the location based stuff is optional. If you want to sit back, strategize, and command the battle from far you can. If you're more the kind of person who likes to put boots on the ground and head to the front lines you can! If you put the time and effort into traveling across the 2km x 2km play space, you'll get the reward of using the devastating AR abilities.

Then came Witcher 3, and it's been absolutely fantastic since Day 1. Great game."
gamernews,395o2d,sleepinlight,22,Tue Jun 9 13:37:33 2015 UTC,Same. Dragon Age was pretty meh to me.
gamernews,395o2d,Zosoer,25,Tue Jun 9 13:38:16 2015 UTC,"There are quite a few things Witcher 3 does better than Dragon Age Inquisition, but the biggest difference in my opinion is the writing. Inquisition has the cheesiest plot ever, and outside of Dorian, not very many interesting characters. The main villain is a total joke, like something ripped out of Power Rangers. So disappointing.  On the other hand, Witcher 3 has literally more than a dozen side quests that are far better written than Inquisition's main story. No exaggeration. I would finish a <2 hour side quest and actually sit there for a few minutes and recover because of the emotional implications. That is good writing.  Also, Witcher 3 is actually hilariously funny on the regular. Great comic relief for such a dark setting."
gamernews,395o2d,BrutalJones,9,Tue Jun 9 16:59:50 2015 UTC,"inquisition just felt very tedious after a while for me. i like it but i would sink hours into it and i felt like i accomplished barely anything. witcher 3 doesn't feel like that, so many quests that seemed simple on the surface but something far greater underneath."
gamernews,395o2d,favsiteinthecitadel,8,Tue Jun 9 17:06:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Geralt is quite frankly one of the best characters in videogames. He isn't all powerful, but a total badass. He is really multifaceted and has a great sense of humor. He's really... Likeable. And he holds such a high status. I don't mean in society, but rather in all of his interactions he seems to be slightly above whomever he is talking to. Which makes sense, given he's probably at least twice as old as anyone he interacts with. He's an absolute joy to play as. I've gotten sick of the blank slate characters we get stuck with often in RPG's. It's refreshing to have a very fleshed out character, even if it does allow a lot of wiggle room for player choice."
gamernews,395o2d,time_lord_victorious,4,Tue Jun 9 18:41:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with this a lot.  It kinda feels like ever since half-life (or really baldur's gate) that there has been a development drive for silent protagonists based on the idea that the player can identify better with a malleable blank state.    Witcher 3 shows that with good writing a fleshed out protagonist can have way more impact.  Especially when given plenty of meaningful and reasonable choices, not just: ""press a to be nice, press b to be mean, press c to be a neutral jerk"".  And can we talk about consequences of choices not playing out until many steps later in a quest line.  I'm looking at you baron!  Lol"

gamernews,395o2d,kodiakus,5,Tue Jun 9 21:04:23 2015 UTC,"I think this is because Geralt's character is taken from a fleshed out literary source, and the developers have put in their best effort to make their game part of the world. Most games like this are usually generic engines, with characters that could be copy/pasted from anywhere."
gamernews,395o2d,CDNRedditor,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:14:51 2015 UTC,"That's true, as Geralt I feel like I just have more authority than everyone else, because he's been around for longer, seen more than most, and he could straight up kill most people without breaking a sweat. On top of that he exists outside of society so he has a different perspective."
gamernews,395o2d,KaiG1987,11,Tue Jun 9 23:52:24 2015 UTC,"The honest difference is that people need to stop thinking that Bioware is good at writing video games . Now The Witcher 3 comes along and is actual greatness, people are realizing that Bioware's fanservice cheese makes is lackluster."
gamernews,395o2d,nocturnalis,14,Tue Jun 9 17:48:10 2015 UTC,"Bioware is too busy building a dating simulator. They have to make sure that every preference is accounted for instead of just writing a good game.   I enjoyed Inquisition, but at no point did the main bad guy ever really have anything like the upper hand, so there was nothing to come back from."
gamernews,395o2d,majesticjg,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:12:01 2015 UTC,"But their dating sucks.  It's all pigeon holed and anything significant is meant to happen at an exact part of the game.  It's even worse with each new game.  At least in Origins it felt more free.  On another note, choices never really feel like choices anymore."
gamernews,395o2d,pwncloud,7,Thu Jun 11 00:27:28 2015 UTC,"I disagree to an extent.  The worldbuilding in ME1 was fantastic, and it was great in Dragon Age: Origins, too. ME2 had absolutely phenomenal characters. But I agree that ME3 totally came off like it was fanfiction, and I really disliked DA2 and thought Inquisition was passable at best."
gamernews,395o2d,BrutalJones,6,Tue Jun 9 17:55:50 2015 UTC,"ME was great,  but ME2 didn't make sense in the context of the lore. It was like the edgy reboot that was built to draw fans from other cover shooters. When you really think about it, ME3 pretty much followed Bioware's ME formula; there's the opening mision that sets the stage (Eden Prime/Freedom's Prospect/Priority: Mars), sidequest that establish lore (Feros, Therum, N7 missions/loyalty quests, N7 missions, and planet-scanning missions/Grunt, Jack, Tuchanka, and N7 missions) then you have the mission that changes the playing field/serves as a mini-boss (Noveria/Horizon/Priority Citadel: II, Udina's betrayal), more sidequests, the mission that changes everything (Illos which launches you to the finale/The Reaper IFF which launches you to the finale/Horizon (dear Lord that planet is awful! )+ Priority: Thessia + Priority: Cerberus Headquarters which takes you to the finale) and then an awesome ending that doesn't really make sense the grand finale (fighting the geth on the side of the Citadel/The Long Walk/kicking Reaper ass throughout London) -> (Sovereign loses his shields once he make Saren his Avatar (???)/the human proto reaper that's destroyed when targeting weakpoints A, B, and C (???), and going on the Citadel to talk to Starchild (?!?!?!).  So once you really think about, it doesn't make sense at all. Also I remembered that among friends (I didn't play at the time) that people could not criticize ME2 without vetting railed. TW1 and TW2 got criticized for tbeir flaws, and TW3 is better for it."

All their stories are the fucking same.  Even when they're good the endings are usually shit. Mass Effect 3 wasn't the first to have a shitty ending. KotOR's ending was basic, as was Neverwinter Nights and Dragon Age. They were good and fitting but really fucking predictable, ME3 was only worse cause no one fucking expected that shit."
gamernews,395o2d,MrTastix,2,Tue Jun 9 23:47:38 2015 UTC,I get you about having to sit for a few minutes and recover. Some crazy shit would happen (first time for me was the Baron quest ending) and I'd just leave and do Witcher contracts so I could just find and kill the thing the big monster for a while. Even those can sneak up on you and make you feel like an ass but I'd just need the time to unwind from a heavy quest that made me question everything I had done up to that point.
gamernews,395o2d,DanG_ReaL,2,Tue Jun 9 20:11:26 2015 UTC,As for the story. Is it dependent of the other games in the series or can I jump strait into the game? I tried the first witcher game and didn't really get into it but I'm hearing good things about this game and think I will give it a go.
gamernews,395o2d,tatskaari,0,Wed Jun 10 11:04:23 2015 UTC,"I would absolutely play Witcher 2 first. The writing in that game is just as good, and it's far more accessible than the first Witcher is. Plus, there are a lot of characters and plot threads from 2 that are continued in 3.  If you wait a few days, Witcher 2 usually drops to around $2.99 during Steam sales. Again, it's totally worth playing."

gamernews,395o2d,Gougaloupe,2,Tue Jun 9 15:39:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the only reason I paid extra for the 980 was to future proof me as much as possible. If you don't mind upgrading your GPU in perhaps two or so years I don't think paying less for a 970 would be a bad idea.  And of course, as if there isn't a need to say it - unless you really want your new GPU now, I would recommend waiting since the new AMD series is around the corner. If those GPUs aren't just straight out better and more bang for the buck, it is at least guaranteed to make you save some mad cash on for example a 290x as companies rush to sell out their stock of them. And a 290x, allthough hotter and way less power efficient is almost as good as a 970."

I wonder if (like in GTAV), you can just fuck around in the game, and still have fun? or is it more akin to a conventional RPG where unless you are actually trying to move forward with the missions, you are just basically left spinning your wheels? (ie- are there straightforward mini-games like in GTAV, and still have fun a lot of fun playing them while ignoring the main story?)  I just keep hearing such amazing things about this game, and I'm considering buying it, but being a new dad, I don't really have much time to devote to a really deep/thorough game."
gamernews,395o2d,reddelicious77,3,Tue Jun 9 16:06:23 2015 UTC,You can play a card game which is quite fun but I barely play it. I run around going to small noticeboards in game which will either have Witcher contracts (monsters needing killed) or mysterious locations which can be monster nests or guarded treasures etc.  It's fun to explore and even when doing story missions it's awesome.

Could be because I have played so many of them it sorta feels like been there done that. The Story line is much more straight forward and ALOT like  GTA in the sense you can stop advancing anytime you want and just take in mini quests or explore, you are never really stuck in a plotline that prevents you from picking up ship and doing something totally different only to pick up later. That is how I played it anyway. I enjoyed the unexpected quests and contracts a lot."

I found the second to be too much like modern day RPGs, while the story was great it the game play and areas were not awe inspiring, but still better then most at the time. Think console limitations. The first one I really liked, but I played it when it was released back in like 1999. You could likely play Witcher 2 and quite like it, probably not the first since it is so dated. While they do tie into each other with previous characters being reintroduced, you do not have to play either to enjoy it. Think of it like the old Star Trek Movies vs new reboots."

gamernews,395o2d,decalmo,8,Tue Jun 9 14:44:10 2015 UTC,"This is definitely an unpopular opinion, but I really could not get into this game. The story was great, and so were the graphics, but the gameplay was very meh for me. Every time I leveled up things felt no different, the menu was cumbersome, and the controls were awkward and non-fluid. (I played on pc). I also felt overwhelmed by all of the bomb making and alchemy stuff, albeit less so than The Witcher 2. And probably most importantly, I felt like it was taking way too long to get anywhere. As I get older I find that I don't have the time or patience to give a game 15+ hours before it really starts to pick up. Its far from a bad game, but I gave up on it at about hour 12, thoroughly disappointed. In my opinion, I much prefer the more open ended and treasure filled rpg like the fallout series.  Edit: I also felt like 75% of the quests I had were for a level much higher than my own, so I had a massive list of stuff I couldn't do. I wish there had been more of a level scaling, although I understand that being difficult for the way the game was set up."

gamernews,395o2d,Fuzzyhammers,2,Tue Jun 9 14:45:17 2015 UTC,I've had the same issue. The controls are AWFUL. How did people enjoy this game so much? :/

gamernews,395o2d,thrilldigger,2,Tue Jun 9 19:01:01 2015 UTC,"I played The Witcher 2 on PC with a controller. It works pretty well, aside from the Inventory screen. All of the in-game menus in general are pretty clunky and not well designed. Probably the most annoying thing about playing with a controller is you automatically loot everything when you press the X button, instead of opening a small window and selecting what you want like with the keyboard and mouse controls.   Aside from that, combat works pretty well on controller. You die quickly, and blocking doesn't absorb all the damage and uses up your vigor points, so it's more beneficial to roll around a lot and try to attack enemies from the back. Quen is also very useful to staying alive on harder difficulties."

gamernews,39aluo,Phi03,3,Wed Jun 10 13:33:01 2015 UTC,"If you watch football a lot, you'll notice that pes15 plays out like a real match, wing backs overlap with wingers, strikers dropping deep to get the ball etc.. In terms of raw gameplay, it's IMO significantly better than fifa at it's core, coming from someone who played both a lot.   In terms of graphics PES15 on PC was gimped, and wasn't next gen so i can't comment there, but FIFA definitely win in that field.   Presentation is another field that FIFA excels at, along with licences etc.. Which can be fixed in PES by patches on PC.   There's a demo for PES15 anyway, so you can always try out for yourself"

gamernews,391ouz,bujweiser,6,Mon Jun 8 17:25:24 2015 UTC,These seem to be remasters of the two GameCube Resident Evils (the original and zero). While 2 and 3 were originally slated to be remade for the GameCube they were cancelled. There isn't much source material for them to remaster since the remakes were never completed.

gamernews,391ouz,jakerfv,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:32:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, let's do what you want and harm other people's experiences in the process.   What exactly do you think you are going to do? Stop all preordering forever with a few Reddit comments? You are delusional. The Reddit gaming community is a minuscule percentage of the general gaming populous. The majority of video game customers are casuals who do not follow the industry the way you or I might. They don't give a shit about whatever controversies we happen to be bitching about. They see a game, they preorder it, and they are done. You will never stop preorders, you have no right to tell people what is right and wrong for them to do with THEIR OWN MONEY either.    Basically, stop being a shithead and get over the fact that people preorder games.       I almost never pre-order video games and yet I am affected by these decisions.   So therefore you are a hypocrite who has no right to EVER question someone else preordering a video game. You can't tell people not to do it, and then do it yourself. Even if you are selective about it. You dun goof'd buddy"
gamernews,391ouz,toThe9thPower,0,Wed Jun 10 20:33:39 2015 UTC,There is a difference between actively pre-ordering and encouraging pre-orders and then getting burned by it a year ago and not doing it against since (watch dogs). I'm not going to lie that I have never pre ordered a video game.
gamernews,391ouz,jakerfv,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:38:23 2015 UTC,"The fact that you have ever preordered a game completely discredits your argument that people are doing harm to you because they preorder some fucking video games.

You mind covering the fact that you bitching about this shit on Reddit will change nothing because the majority of the gaming public does not follow the video game industry like how people on Reddit/Gaming websites might follow it.

We can debate whether it's 'good' now, but it's improved MASSIVELY since the very first RE. They're not even in the same universe in terms of voice acting goes.

gamernews,391ouz,BreezeBo,6,Mon Jun 8 19:07:38 2015 UTC,The voice-acting is intentionally cheesy. Resident Evil has never been scary; it's been about B-movie horror with all the great and shitty things about it.

gamernews,391hzf,Psychobeans,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:36:14 2015 UTC,I can't tell. I think this is an overarching issue with Capcom just remaking their old games to the point where people are buying most games multiple times because they want to support Capcom. The Megaman remake for psp was amazing and new while still being a remake. I wish they'd take chances and do new things with the franchise. I look at the ps2 Megaman games and think how could they have thought these were good? Someone in the chain of command should have waved a red flag.

gamernews,38vths,andrewisboredx2,207,Sun Jun 7 07:18:06 2015 UTC,"Welcome to what PC gamers feel about every console generation. PS4/Xbox One are already struggling to run cutting edge games at 30fps, Witcher 3 drops to 20fps on both, Xbox one still playing games at 720p-900p. Graphics have basically peaked again and we won't get anything pushing PC hardware for another 5-10 years when we get PS5/next Xbox.  All the proprietary bullshit consoles sell milking every cent out of the customer and fanboys eating it up. An Xbox is a computer, a PlayStation is a computer, they all have video cards, CPUs, operating systems, except they are all locked and closed off, and by current standards are relatively low-end. Why is this better than having a single open standardized platform that all the software/game companies compete against each other?"
gamernews,38vths,KommodoreAU,5,Sun Jun 7 08:25:03 2015 UTC,"Socrates115 has a strange definition of niche. I wonder what he's basing this information on. Because games sell on PC, and they sell well. One would think Steam would be a clear indication of that. Since Steams online-peak is higher than the total amount of sold Xbox Ones.   Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor has sold more than 1 million on Steam. Dark Souls 2 has also sold about 1 million on PC. Grand Theft Auto V has sold approximately 2 million without any sale on Steam. And the PC-exclusive game Arma 3 is more than 1 million by far.  If that is what defines niche then holy crap, the gaming world is in serious trouble."
gamernews,38vths,thirdsketch,6,Sun Jun 7 09:11:17 2015 UTC,"People take video games too seriously. They're meant to be fun. Yet shit is thrown around. My only argument is about niche. Calling a platform that sells millions niche, despite console port or not, is strange to me. If you solely meant ""users with expensive machines being niche"" then yes, we are niche.   Some fun numbers though  Sid Meier's Civilization V: 7,406,074 ± 72,907 owners    Dayz: 3,189,784 ± 48,280 owners (Early Access but still a game)    Euro Truck Simulator 2: 1,777,636 ± 36,149 owners    Cities: Skylines: 1,173,011 ± 29,402 owners    Company of heroes 2: 1,392,769 ± 32,023 owners    Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition: 1,902,824 ± 37,390 owners    Divinity: Original Sin: 828,452 ± 24,727 owners"
gamernews,38vths,thirdsketch,10,Sun Jun 7 21:28:44 2015 UTC,"This argument never makes any sense to me. As someone that builds and sells PCs to both home users and business users, many people are already happily purchasing decent systems for basic home/office use to begin with. Core i5 processors, plenty of RAM etc. Usually all that's missing is a decent graphics card. Hell even the ones buying the Pentium and i3 processors are still very much ""in the game"" as long as they get themselves a decent graphics card.   Computers (moreso than consoles) have lasting relevancy when it comes to gaming. You can turn settings down/off and games run fine on older setups, and in some cases still look just as good as their console (360/ps3) counterparts.   The more relevant point however, is that PC's are upgradeable. So that PC that's struggling might get a couple hundred dollars injected into it in the form of a new video card etc, and suddenly it's a capable gaming system again.  Lastly, the PC market is fucking enormous. I'm not quite sure where the ""not enough to sustain those games on their own"" idea is coming from. It's simply a case of publishers recognising the easy money that is the console market."
gamernews,38vths,everythingwillbeok,27,Sun Jun 7 21:36:22 2015 UTC,"That's all well and good, but a person still has to want to play video games on their PC.  You can have the hardware to play games on medium/high all day long, but without actually having the urge to do so, it doesn't really matter.  I know plenty of people that own computers that could play at least some games, but they'd rather just play everything on a console.    When people say something has a ""small market"", that means it has a smaller number of people willing to purchase something, it doesn't mean somebody has an OK computer.  I've been building myself and other people high-end PC's for decades now but somehow I never fell under the illusion that playing video games on their computer is for everybody.  It's just not and somehow I doubt it ever will be."

gamernews,38vths,HerpthouaDerp,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:59:18 2015 UTC,Lol getting a free OS is easier than almost any other software IMHO
gamernews,38vths,AnoK760,-2,Sun Jun 7 13:15:36 2015 UTC,"mouse, keyboard   My bad. Add another $15 ish to the price.   (unless you were expecting people to use Linux, which has a whole host of issues to overcome from a new user perspective and that a lot of games still don't run on it).   Over 1000 Steam games run on Linux. In fact, that's the OS of Valve's 'Steam Machine'   speakers, and a monitor   If you're going to factor that cost into a gaming PC, then you need to factor the cost of a TV into any console you buy.    That's not even thinking about all the time you have to spend making it all work and the fact that not everyone knows how to put all of it together.    That's exactly what I mentioned in my post. A PC isn't the easy solution. A console is the easy solution. The PC will give you better performance.   Edit: Thinking about this a bit more, one could also purchase Windows and either bump up the cost over $500. Or, one could game on Linux and wait a couple of months and then buy Windows with the savings from buying PC games instead of console games. Console games tend to be more expensive and stay at a higher cost for a longer time."

Let me go get Witcher 3. I remember they made a big deal about that being available on SteamOS and Linux. Oh. Also not available. Hmmm.  Alright, what about StarCraft 2? Not supported. Diablo 3, same deal. Just a quick google search brings up threads and videos of the hoops you have to jump through just to play, and all of them through a Windows emulator.  So sure.

gamernews,38vths,fishy007,2,Mon Jun 8 07:30:50 2015 UTC,"Don't tell someone to build a ""decent gaming PC"" and then tell them to get an OS that a lot of today's most popular games don't support.  It's a disengenius argument. Sure, you won't get console exclusives on Windows, but the fact that a lot of the most popular PC exclusive games don't run on Linux means you aren't getting a decent gaming PC, you're getting a machine that might run the game you want or it might not. Because, you know, games are the important part.  You know what the last game from a AAA studio that is supported on Linux is?  Civilization Beyond Earth. In October of last year. (2K Games seems to put most of their stuff on Linux, although their latest sports/wrestling games aren't on Linux)  So, in summary, Linux is not a substitute for a ""decent gaming PC"" as most of the top games aren't available on it. EA and Activision, the two biggest third party publishers don't support Linux.  Hell, MacOS has more games support than Linux, and I would be debating someone telling a person to use MacOS for gaming just as ardently."
gamernews,38vths,HolidayHowlett,0,Mon Jun 8 07:40:01 2015 UTC,"Sigh. You seem very determined to make a case that a decent $500 gaming PC can't be done...but it's just not true. It's like if I said 'water is wet' and you're arguing that it isn't.   In the original post, I posted a link to a build with Intel and Nvidia parts. If you're adamant about Windows, it's extremely easy to just buy AMD parts, save $100 on the hardware and buy Windows.  OR  You can spend more than $500, stick with Intel/Nvidia and buy Windows.  OR  If you're a student (as many gamers are) many schools have programs that will give away Windows for free or for a low cost ($10)  OR  There are numerous system builders that can build a system with Windows for under $500. Most of these seem to be AMD-based and capable of playing most games.   And the beauty of the the PC is that it can be upgraded at any time. You bought a low end PC with the money you have now? Great, in 3 months you can buy a kick-ass video card to go with it.  Need more memory? You can do that too. More hard drive space? Easy, just add one in. No need to reinstall the OS and download your games again.   If you want a console, that's fine. Hell, I have a console myself. There are games on some of them that aren't available on a PC. However, the PC is by far the most versatile system you can have, AND you can have it for under $500 with either Windows or Linux....or both!"
gamernews,38vths,fishy007,0,Mon Jun 8 14:12:23 2015 UTC,"Do you incorporate the cost of a monitor/TV in with a console?  Either way you need a display for the console or PC, so that can be ruled out.  Next we assume that you are getting a tv or monitor with speakers built in, or you need seperate speakers for your console, so we can rule that out.  Yes, we do need a mouse/keyboard because consoles come with 1 controller. You can get a cheap mouse/keyboard combo for $20 easily.  So your point about the extra costs is sort of useless."

It's hard to believe people are still trying the PC gaming is too expensive argument.. it's been debunked on several occasions. There are several examples out there showing how to build a PC superior to a next-gen console for less cost (which doesn't even factor in the massive savings you make long term).   Yeah I wish games were farther along in tech but not everyone wants to pull their head out of the sand. Some people no matter how many times you try to explain will insist on remaining wilfully ignorant.

We're at 460$ before taxes and I have my gaming rig and extremely popular game all my friends are playing.  You cannot buy a computer from a retail store for 460$ that will outperform the Xbox one, you cannot build a computer using retail parts for 460$ that will outperform the Xbox one. Every single sub 500$ ""console killer"" build I have seen, leaves out OS(100$) and (Peripherals 50$), and even then they're scrapping the bottom of the barrel.  You can't fucking compare buying an xbone to building your ""200$ console killer"" that's filled with 900$ worth of spare parts or used stuff from /r/hardwareswap running off your MSDN free copy of windows.  There are also tons of benefits to using consoles that people seem to love to ignore, but for some reason get excited over Nvidea Shield and steambox which are trying to bring those benefits and features while utilising PC performance.   Console gaming has it's place and will always have it's place, and that's great because it's pushing companies like valve and Nvidea to compete and get a piece of the casual couch sitting gamer pie."

I ran CSGO at 720p/150fps off just my CPU while I was waiting on my GPU, my parents' PC made with quite old components and maybe hitting around £300 can run most modern games with low res (~720p) settings and still looks better than current gen. I mean shit, I don't even remember the last time I absolutely couldn't run something at a decent frame rate without modifying the graphics settings a little.   Most developers have gotten very good at optimisation now. Even arguably badly optimised games still run okay on most computers. The days of having to spend £1.5k to run the latest game at top spec are over. At that price point you're paying for additional monitors, higher refresh rates, and 4K gaming."
gamernews,38vths,Sexatoo,12,Mon Jun 8 20:21:35 2015 UTC,But one of the reasons you don't need a lot of computer these days is because developers are held back by consoles. Consoles have actually benefited PC gaming in that way. Before the original Xbox came out PC developers were constantly pushing PC's to their limit and you had to upgrade quite often to keep up. Now you can have a cheap medium level PC and be able to play at decent levels for quite a while without any major upgrades.

And you can easily build a PC for ~400 that competes with the Xbox One or PS4 if you look for sales. Not to mention the ability to upgrade your system more regularly.  Finally, there are whole genres of games made inaccessible because they can only be played with Mouse and Keyboard. Whereas there are many games with controller support for the PC."

I just think with what COULD have been a real possibility had that rumor been true, would have actually turned out financially successful for Bethesda.   This of course could all be PR to hype up current gen/PC release. Obviously they're not going to suggest the game could run just fine on 10 year old hardware.   But overall, let's be honest. I'm a console fan and we both know anything being held back wouldn't be because of a dual generation launch. It would be to meet the requirements the consoles require to run.

gamernews,38vths,SurelyDrunk,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:28:34 2015 UTC,"I still don't think it will work. If we can make mods, we'll share them privately if we have to. As long as the Nexus is around, we'll have a place to do so, and even if that falls we'll figure something out.  I don't have a problem with the notion of paid mods, but it's the petty modders that made this difficult for the community. The ones who used freely-shared content in their mod, and try to charge for it. If it lead to the creation of more mods like Faalskar or Wyrmstooth, I'd be good with it - but what we're really going to get is 1500+ hunting rifle retextures for the low, low price of $0.99."
gamernews,38vths,Hopelesz,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:01:01 2015 UTC,"We're not going to be able to stop the petty people from operating. If we make it profitable, we're only increasing the incentive for people to steal content to post it elsewhere. Right now, modding is just a labor of love, and things are going pretty good in the community - and a curated paid mod site would cause a bloody civil war.  Modders didn't make these games, but they keep them relevant. If you alienate the fanbase that keeps your games alive, you run the risk of killing your franchise."
gamernews,38vths,michaelfarker,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:09:35 2015 UTC,"That's why this is complicated. I've been playing and modding Bethesda games since 2002. A lot of people have been. If the paid mod workshop is mandatory (i.e, we can't upload anywhere we want) then you make your existing and loyal fanbase into fugitives. The community loses long-term popular modders.  Or the paid mod workshop is optional like during the Steam test, and the community wars itself. You'll get a couple gems this way, but the workshop will be flooded with poor content, as well as thieves. You'll have Robin Hood types who buy the mod to upload on torrent sites or mod sites, causing more strife.  The test failed, pretty badly. They need to leave a good thing alone. I think the idea has merit but this is just not the way to go about doing this. If you want to put money in the hands of modders, the Nexus sites have a convenient donate button, and they won't take a cut if you use it."

gamernews,38vths,Hopelesz,2,Mon Jun 8 02:59:37 2015 UTC,"I had planned to upgrade my 8 GB to 16 by now but have not seen a use for it.  I would love to see an open world game use 16 or 32 GB of RAM.  The limit to how big the world gets might be how much time they have to dream stuff up then, with no artificial zone divisions breaking the flow of the story.  But with the current gen systems only having 8 GB RAM I am not holding my breath."
gamernews,38vths,Kaz3,4,Mon Jun 8 04:05:23 2015 UTC,"RAM is not actually close to a limitation for most video games any more. 4GB of RAM is usually way more than enough for dynamic loading of levels. The usual 3D open world games are not at all limited by RAM. Video memory is an enormous limitation on the other hand, as is GPU memory bandwidth and processing power.   The only real exception to the above is intensives strategy games, some of those might have thousands of units or phenomenally complex non deterministic problems to solve. In that scenario a game might want for more system memory.  Just figured you would find that interesting. I have done some video game development."

gamernews,38q3c2,Not_here_to_be_nice,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:37:29 2015 UTC,IMHO it's better than to release the same thing for PC and consoles if you don't have two teams developing. Controls are just too different. Even in most great cross platform game things like menus or inventory suck for mouse and keyboard controls because there is no a focus for that. Every game needs to be ported and we just got home see that they usually don't that most ppl stopped complaining. The younger generation maybe even don't know how it can be to have something really optimized for mouse and keyboard.
gamernews,38q3c2,Zeno84,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:32:47 2015 UTC,Does anyone think it won't come out on console and every other platform imaginable at some point?  Come on.  Though PC-first is great for us PC Gamers because they'll tailor it to the strengths of the PC platform.

Using it as a mouse was a step back from using traditional joysticks and buttons as a cursor.    These are reasons why it was bad in my initial testing. I say it's the worst, as it's competing with the the xbone's controller (take the best controller from previous Gen, then add things that make it better), the ps4's thing is a solid design with interesting peripherals, and the WiiU's controller doubles as a functioning tv screen to game on."

gamernews,38kzre,ferretninja91,7,Sun Jun 7 18:35:09 2015 UTC,I still don't understand the need for two pads. It looks like the left pad is going to end up being largely useless and losing the d-pad over it isn't worth it. The analog stick should have been where the pad is and the d-pad should be where the stick is at. This thing also looks bigger than an original XBox controller. No thanks.
gamernews,38kzre,DrCockenstein,3,Fri Jun 5 00:10:20 2015 UTC,"As a lefty, I'm relieved they thought of two track pads. I use the mouse with the left hand and the keyboard with the right one, so being forced to invert these with the pad would be a deal breaker for me.  The only thing I hope for is that this cross thing on the left one will not cause any problems."
gamernews,38kzre,LeVraiBleh,2,Fri Jun 5 05:13:07 2015 UTC,"I think it will, at least the nubs will get in the way for smooth tracking. The cross pad is clearly a compromise due to people wanting an analog stick and regular d-pad. Problem with compromises is they almost always suck and I don't see this being any different.  As for the lefty thing I really wonder why Valve isn't making a left and right version of this. They could have at least offered some option to swap pads for left/right users. Problem with that is you'd need dual sticks. As of right now left hand players will lose the stick if they try to put view on the left pad.  It's just a shit controller design in general."
gamernews,38kzre,DrCockenstein,6,Fri Jun 5 14:36:05 2015 UTC,"There's lots of potential uses for 2 pads.  It likely gives finer control than the stick, you could use one as a scroll wheel, or you could use them both to control the mouse for uninterrupted movement.  If anything, the stick is the unnecessary part.  I would have slightly preferred they leave the d-pad there."
gamernews,38kzre,xandar,4,Fri Jun 5 00:24:42 2015 UTC,Ya the loss of the d-pad makes this a bad choice for retro and fighting games. The biggest complaint about the 360 controller is the shit d-pad. If the Steam controller would have had dual pads and a quality d-pad I'd totally give it a shot.
gamernews,38kzre,DrCockenstein,2,Fri Jun 5 00:28:16 2015 UTC,The left pad is a D-Pad. You can see it embossed into the rubber.

gamernews,38kzre,SoberPandaren,2,Fri Jun 5 03:42:31 2015 UTC,"I just won't buy it. It won't feel the same as a normal d-pad and those of us who use d-pad over stick are very specific about what we like. I'll stick with my 360 controller, wireless kb/m, and SNES controllers for now. The Steam controller doesn't look like it's going to be any better than these so there's no point. Now if the reviews prove me wrong I'll consider it but based on every other controller I've seen with a ""unique"" d-pad it's going to suck. Really it reminds me of the Nintendo MAX which was one of the worst controllers ever made."
gamernews,38kzre,DrCockenstein,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:31:22 2015 UTC,"But then again, the circle pad also emulates one of what is arguable one of the best fighting controller ever."
gamernews,38kzre,DrCockenstein,0,Fri Jun 5 16:12:40 2015 UTC,No way. If you've ever used a Sega Six Button you know how unique that cross is. It's more like a cross on top of a tiny joystick and the motion is about as perfect as you can get and the swinging motion prevented blisters even with the rough texture of the cross. The Saturn Six Button is slightly better than the Genesis Six Button since it adds shoulder buttons but it's still the same d-pad.  The Steam Controller isn't going to have that same motion. The Steam Controller also isn't going to allow you to hold it with fingers on buttons and thumb on pad. At best I see it being an average solution but more than likely it's going to be horrible for anything that needs a true d-pad.
gamernews,38kzre,DrCockenstein,-1,Fri Jun 5 16:21:04 2015 UTC,"Wait, you're going to stick with a 360 controller and then have the full to complain about d-pads? Literally the worst in history. If you want to play a fighting game you're already gimping yourself without a fight stick."

gamernews,38kzre,arcticblue,2,Fri Jun 5 14:40:22 2015 UTC,If you look at the left most pad there's obviously a d pad integrated into it.
gamernews,38kzre,DrCockenstein,-5,Fri Jun 5 00:29:01 2015 UTC,Not the same. Ideally I'd want a Sega 6-Button cross but something similar to a Nintendo cross would work just as well. Ridges on a pad isn't going to have the same feel as a proper d-pad. Even getting rid of the stick and having two pads and a d-pad would have been a better idea.
gamernews,38kzre,luaudesign,2,Fri Jun 5 00:39:47 2015 UTC,"From what I read, there's supposed to be localized haptic feedback to make it feel just like a regular button push (AFAIK, it's similar to how the trackpad on the new Macbook works).  There may even be actual buttons under there too...I'm not really sure.  Valve is a company run and staffed by gamers with no shareholders to answer to so I don't think they are going to put out a shit controller.  I'm personally really looking forward to this."
gamernews,38kzre,DrCockenstein,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:15:41 2015 UTC,You must not be a d-pad player or play a lot of fighting games. I'm very specific about my d-pad to the point where I'll use a retro controller if I really want accuracy. This pad can have all the tricks in the world but it won't hold a candle to a Sega Six Button. The Steam Controller looks a lot like the NES MAX and that was one of the worst d-pads ever made. Reinventing the wheel is almost never needed.
gamernews,38kzre,SomeOtherNeb,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:38:26 2015 UTC,Me and nearly everyone I know who plays fighting games on gamepads cover their thumb with a tip of their shirt to make it run without friction and not hurt the thumbs over extended use.
gamernews,38kzre,GILLHUHN,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:49:00 2015 UTC,I have a permanent divot in my left thumb due to how much I wore it down playing Street Fighter 2 for SNES. It's exactly the shape of the square corner of the d-pad. I'd play until it got blistered.
gamernews,38kzre,SomeOtherNeb,3,Fri Jun 5 19:43:46 2015 UTC,I was on board until I tried to pre-order one and noticed they were €55.
gamernews,38kzre,GILLHUHN,5,Fri Jun 5 08:32:36 2015 UTC,So same price as any other big brand name controller?

gamernews,38kzre,liquidarts,25,Fri Jun 5 00:19:49 2015 UTC,I've had one for 2 years. Its called Big Picture mode.  Edit: Keep em' downvotes coming. A Steam Box is nothing but Steam OS (linux) and Big Picture mode. Its a normal PC anyone can build. Simply put a Steam Box is a PC designed to be used in the living room running Big Picture mode.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrL6-OhN94  That is what you will see when you turn on a Steam Box.
gamernews,38kzre,Darkexp3rt,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:52:44 2015 UTC,"So, not a single bit of this has to do with a Steambox. Steamlink is not what you would call a Steambox. Steamboxes are entire PC's built into the form factor of something like a DVD player."
gamernews,38kzre,liquidarts,-4,Fri Jun 5 15:17:33 2015 UTC,But it's a PC you can download from steem with a discount!
gamernews,38kzre,Darkexp3rt,2,Fri Jun 5 19:19:13 2015 UTC,I'm just glad it can be bought with Steam Wallet.  Now throw a 980 ti on Steam that I can order with my Steam wallet credit and I'll be golden.

gamernews,38kzre,Yaegers,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:46:39 2015 UTC,"For me the wallet is a big deal because I have a lot of high value items. To sell them outside of steam is very risky. To sell them in steam would get a lot of steam credit, but since that money can only go to DLC and games it is no good to me as I have all the games I want. I wish I could cash out my wallet but doesn't look like valve will ever make that possible. So they either let me cash out or start offering other gaming items to purchase"

gamernews,38kzre,Inferis84,2,Fri Jun 5 00:25:49 2015 UTC,To my knowledge they have been much improved since initial testing
gamernews,38kzre,drizztmainsword,2,Fri Jun 5 05:19:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed. And they even included an analog stick. I thought that was what the touch thingy was supposed to replace.    The games that I use a controller for are 2D platformers and Beat Em Ups. I really question that I could play Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter with this controller. How am I supposed to execute ""Right, Down, Diagonal"" without a physical d-pad?"
gamernews,38kzre,Jourei,2,Fri Jun 5 10:12:07 2015 UTC,"The internet is very quick to shit on new things, regardless of the actual quality.  I have no idea how the steam controller will do, and won't know for sure until I get one in my hands (or if all review of the actual product are unanimously bad and argumented). But there's already a lot of people basically saying that everything different from current controllers is bad.  Seriously, give innovation a chance."
gamernews,38kzre,ElDuderino2112,2,Fri Jun 5 11:36:00 2015 UTC,"And it's not like the current controllers are all that fantastic.  I think also that when people see ""trackpad"" they think about the terrible pieces of crap that are on shitty windows laptops. Trackpads can be great; I use one for work every day, all day and it's much better than a mouse (for what I do at least). I don't know if these trackpads are good, of course. We'll have to wait and see."
gamernews,38kzre,Mephil_,3,Fri Jun 5 11:19:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly I hated track pads until I started using a macbook for work. Apple's trackpads are amazing to use, and for anything other than gaming I would replace a mouse for one of them. I have yet to see another trackpad as nice."

Love the concept, love the aesthetic, and I really love alot of the mechanics. The safehouses seems really cool; a nice little cozy place to hide. I am sad that the town itself didn't seem as colorful and vivid as it did a PAX, but I believe that was mostly due to the lighting and I guess pre-alpha isn't the time to make final assumptions.  Too many games are so dreary looking and the PAX footage really set it apart from the typical (which is why I started following this). I can't wait to rob houses, and I don't know why but I think the T.V.'s are so cool. Overall I really hope the kickstarter is a success because I can't wait to see this game in it's full glory."

Fallout 3 wasn't exactly cutting edge to say the least so it's not like the series is known for pushing those sorts of boundaries. As long as the art is well realised I don't see the problem, even if it is missing some of the bells and whistles of other titles.  Given it looks like the Skyrim engine again it's not unreasonable to think they could hit 1080p60 too.  On the other hand, given the fact it looks like the same engine I'm also worried it will be filled with game breaking bugs at launch, so I'll hold off on the preorder and get it once I know it'll work."

I know it's only an announcement trailer (tbh I'm not a huge Fallout fan either) but it certainly left me underwhelmed.  Then again, the city did look huge so that's a change."

gamernews,38db1g,amilmitt,-9,Thu Jun 4 03:56:57 2015 UTC,"3 and New Vegas were constrained by being on the same piece of shit engine though. I hoped they'd get away from it but evidently not. You can argue that any engine can be made good but I think it's obvious that either the code is too much of a mess or Bethesda don't know what they're doing. Why they persist with it I don't know, efficiency at holding tons of entities in memory? It's definitely not because it feels good and can handle large numbers of NPCs...  But yes, as I said, announcement trailer and means nothing.   You try and craft a huge world AS WELL as a story AS WELL as enough dialog and things to do on a budget. After while something has to be cut somewhere.   I'll accept that for Fallout but never, ever for TES6. That game sold so many copies, it can't be far behind GTA. Which, btw, soundly destroys your argument. It looks great, is reasonably well written, is huge.  If they haven't spent that money on making TES6 look and feel great then I'd like to know what they think is more important. Personally I think it's a mistake, they should have used the money on this game, made it the thing to buy (right now I don't think many non-fans are going to be drawn in) and made their money back to spend on TES6."

They are two completely different types of games deleving two completely differnt types of feelings and gameplay, and structure.   Of course what do I know? You are obviously the genius in this. Please, go ahead and enlighten us in your game-making knowledge.   Also I'll pick Fallout over TES anyday, I still find New vegas a memorable experience where each playthrough felt unique because of the choices you could make that affect the world, and guess what? The fucking graphics wern't the reason why.   It was because the choices one could make could be vastly different. You could kill almost every single person in the game and still come out a victor. The elder scrolls is all about limiting what 'freedom' there is. the choices you make don't matter, and our complishments don't add to shit in the long run as everyone treats you the same.   So unless they have something new to pull out of their ass for TES6 I couldn't care any less about that game series."
gamernews,38db1g,Aztook,7,Thu Jun 4 00:09:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm just disappointed that it only looks a little better than New Vegas.   I mean it's been five years. You'd think they could have at least kept up with other developers.   I'm not saying it has to beat out Crysis, or bring Titan Xs to their knees.

Some form of civilization should have already come back, there are too few settlements, they are too undevelopped, plants and trees should have already started to grow back, food should have already go spoiler, buildings should have collapsed without maintenance, etc.  Oh well, the fallout universe is really interesting, I love the whole ""this is how they though the future would be in the cold war era"", the funny / crazy parts of it don't loo too out of place but ... perhaps it's best not to think too much about logic :p"

Skyrim was also revered, though I personally thought it was just pretty good and never thought of it as all that amazing in either category.

gamernews,38db1g,Sedition7988,-12,Wed Jun 3 17:32:56 2015 UTC,"Doesn't really make a whole lot of difference, to be honest. No gameplay."
gamernews,38db1g,RagnarDraconus,8,Wed Jun 3 18:23:55 2015 UTC,It's an announcement trailer you retard. If anything you should be happy they did an inengine trailer instead of some fancy cinematic that won't look like the final product.   You'll get your gameplay at E3.
gamernews,38db1g,Sedition7988,-17,Wed Jun 3 18:31:52 2015 UTC,Boy times have changed when you get called a retard for not circlejerking on some hype train over a trailer for a video game with no gameplay.  Enjoy your AAA pile of shit with 60 bucks of garbage DLC.
gamernews,38db1g,RagnarDraconus,8,Wed Jun 3 18:37:32 2015 UTC,"You didn't get called a retard because of lack of hype. You got called a retard because you continue to accuse it of being a ""CG movie"" while acting smugly superior for who knows what fucking reason even though it is obviously in-engine footage.  But hey, you are the soothsayer afterall. We don't even know its release date and yet it is a ""AAA pile of shit"". Fucking idiot."
gamernews,38db1g,Invisible-Gorilla,-9,Wed Jun 3 20:58:50 2015 UTC,"You're the same people that always bitch when these games release and the graphics are worse, it's addled with bugs, and the game itself is slapped together garbage that only sold well because of it's brand name.  Every. Single. Time. I'm gonna laugh when this thing comes out and history repeats itself. Especially being a Bethesda game."
gamernews,38db1g,c0ldsh0w3r,3,Wed Jun 3 21:19:53 2015 UTC,"Please, I hate those people as much as you do. The entire Witcher 3 drama was retarded and unnecessary. But please, do continue to make assumptions about my attitude towards games.  People are allowed to be excited when one of their favorite franchises has an announcement like this. Maybe the game will flop, maybe it won't, maybe it will be amazing, who can say at this point?  All I know is regardless of what happens, it is no excuse for you to act like a fucking cunt. Which you have done, and continue to do."
gamernews,38db1g,Sedition7988,-4,Wed Jun 3 21:22:59 2015 UTC,it is no excuse for you to act like a fucking cunt   Maybe think about how you're acting before you get too self righteous.
gamernews,38db1g,c0ldsh0w3r,4,Wed Jun 3 21:57:25 2015 UTC,"Hey retard, we're just happy it exists. Crawl back under your rock and take your cautious consumerism with you.   Sometimes it's ok to just be happy something is really real."
gamernews,38db1g,Patienceisavirtue1,-4,Wed Jun 3 21:51:38 2015 UTC,"Happy it exists? It's one of the flagship titles of the company. They are literally going to keep making Fallout games until people stop buying them. Which isn't happening anytime soon, because in modern gaming industry millions will drop 120 dollars just for the title of a game. I look forward to all the tears months from now when people don't have their hype goggles on."
gamernews,38db1g,Draber-Bien,2,Thu Jun 4 00:59:17 2015 UTC,Well fuck you too buddy.
gamernews,38db1g,terrorismofthemind,14,Thu Jun 4 06:16:55 2015 UTC,"Although it will be great to play another Fallout game, nothing really got me excited in this teaser. I will keep an eye on it though."
gamernews,38db1g,Patienceisavirtue1,5,Wed Jun 3 15:21:35 2015 UTC,"At least it seems like Fallout will have actual colours instead of just greys, browns and greenish browns."
gamernews,38db1g,shawnaroo,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:02:43 2015 UTC,Yeah my first thought was that it visually looks no better than Bioshock Infinite which is disappointing.
gamernews,38db1g,CakeLicker,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:31:57 2015 UTC,"it's not even just the visuals, it's...just more Fallout. I'm curious to see how they've made it different this time in terms of gameplay."
gamernews,38db1g,Raincoats_George,9,Wed Jun 3 21:07:48 2015 UTC,"I really just want more Fallout. Sure, I can think of a bunch of little tweaks to the gameplay that'd be nice, but I'd be happy even if this was basically just NV gameplay with a new setting and new story."
gamernews,38db1g,MrTastix,5,Wed Jun 3 21:52:47 2015 UTC,"I think most of the excitement comes from the possible lore that will come out of the game. That's why I'm excited at least. But yeah, it didn't really show anything new yet, besides the setting."
gamernews,38db1g,SaladWithHotDogsInIt,28,Wed Jun 3 21:18:47 2015 UTC,models and graphics looked pretty dated in places.
gamernews,38db1g,BlackAera,12,Wed Jun 3 15:19:19 2015 UTC,"I couldn't help but feel this. It looks OK but compared to the Witcher for example it's hardly par for what it could be. I know some of that is Bethesdas art style. And they also tend to focus on scale and content. But even though it's blasphemy to say so, I was expecting more than just a graphics patch for new Vegas.   Now where it will make the game is of course game play mechanics. If they can introduce a new and innovative approach to the fps rpg then it wouldn't matter to me if they used fallout 3 graphics. Game play is the most important thing. I suspect they will but we will have to see.   They haven't let me down yet with elder scrolls or fallout so I have faith."
gamernews,38db1g,masonkbr,5,Wed Jun 3 16:53:11 2015 UTC,"The Witcher has always been the exception though. CDPR have always tried to be on the bleeding edge whereas Bethesda not so much. Best they did was view distance back during Oblivion (which was fucking awesome for the time).  I don't see how this isn't par. The Witcher 3 isn't the rule, and in regards to Bethesda it never has been. TES and Fallout have never on the cutting edge of graphics."
gamernews,38db1g,BlackAera,-1,Thu Jun 4 03:29:13 2015 UTC,"It really just makes me wonder how long this has been in progress. I don't think it looks bad, but... well I'm pretty disappointed in this console generation thus far.   edit: uh oh. who have I offended now? D:"
gamernews,38db1g,Mute_,-2,Wed Jun 3 21:14:19 2015 UTC,It's coming for last gen too. That's why.  Edit: Bethesda confirmed it's current gen and PC only.
gamernews,38db1g,cupids_hitman,9,Wed Jun 3 15:38:57 2015 UTC,"That has not at all been confirmed.  On their website it only says PC, PS4, and XBONE."
gamernews,38db1g,Sabbathius,3,Wed Jun 3 15:57:54 2015 UTC,You are right. There were rumors because of what has been found in the source code of the website but Bethesda now said it only comes for current gen and PC. That makes the mediocre graphics even less understandable. It looks similarly detailed as Destiny and that's on last gen consoles too.
gamernews,38db1g,arcticblue,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:25:19 2015 UTC,"It's coming for last gen too? That explains things a little. Still, those graphics are pretty good regardless."
gamernews,38db1g,herdiegerdie,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:45:23 2015 UTC,It's not going to be on last gen.
gamernews,38db1g,MrSuperSaiyan,5,Wed Jun 3 23:02:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it does look dated. Not that it's anything new, most Bethesda games have pretty weak graphics and downright awful animations, it's not why we play them. Still, I hoped for something a little more next-gen. It doesn't look bad per se, but some recent games (like Witcher 3) have spoiled me."
gamernews,38db1g,hasoon004,3,Wed Jun 3 16:59:43 2015 UTC,"I thought some of the lighting and environmental effects were much improved.  Not everything has dynamic shadows and all that, but I don't really mind.  All the models look to be higher polygon count (at least at first glance in this trailer) and it looks like there's better physics going on (like the shopping cart that gets thrown out of the way).  As with all Bethesda games, there will probably be a strong mod community smoothing out the rough edges.  Lots of detail in what looks to be a pretty far view distance too (which is probably why some other stuff looks a little toned down).  I'm pretty excited for it!"
gamernews,38db1g,Swinetrek,3,Thu Jun 4 04:54:04 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of excited. Bethesda's track record has me uneasy with buying at launch. I feel like they're going to do what they always do, release a half-finished/broken game and wait for the modding community to pick up the pieces. That's fine and all, but is getting old. Skyrim was really bad when it came to this aspect, huge chunks of the game cut and restored through modding. Half the guild quests were not finished and were underwhelming."
gamernews,38db1g,good_piggy,2,Wed Jun 3 17:22:45 2015 UTC,I'm hoping this means that it will be a 2015 December release.
gamernews,38db1g,SargeantSasquatch,2,Wed Jun 3 20:30:38 2015 UTC,Can't wait!!!!
gamernews,38db1g,duffking,2,Wed Jun 3 22:11:06 2015 UTC,Honestly I was disappointed. I expected it to look better. Though Witcher 3 may have spoiled me.
gamernews,38db1g,Dexiro,9,Thu Jun 4 00:18:37 2015 UTC,My god that dog was poorly animated. Love the colours though. Should be a bit brighter than previous games.
gamernews,38db1g,pizzabeer,27,Wed Jun 3 14:28:48 2015 UTC,"That dog was actually animated very well, it just didn't have very good textures/shaders."
gamernews,38db1g,Axerty,13,Wed Jun 3 15:23:10 2015 UTC,"I think it's the blending between animations as opposed to the actual animations. The individual animations look good, but the transitions are iffy which makes them seem a bit unnatural. They blend a lot better than I'm used to seeing from the FO/TES series but there's a jerkiness there that gives the tech away a bit."
gamernews,38db1g,pizzabeer,4,Wed Jun 3 15:36:51 2015 UTC,"I thought the movements seemed really unnatural, enough so for it to grab my attention each time the dog was in the trailer.   But that said I don't care about the graphics too much :P It looks colourful and it'll hopefully be fun."
gamernews,38db1g,Axerty,4,Wed Jun 3 15:44:32 2015 UTC,I don't get why everyone wants brighter colours. It's a post apocalyptic wasteland not cloud city from Bioshock! I've always taken it that the atmosphere is fucked and everything's run down so obviously it'd look grim. Brighter colours migt even take away from the mood of the game.
gamernews,38db1g,SirSaltie,8,Wed Jun 3 15:44:38 2015 UTC,even in real life wastelands there are colours.  I want less Book of Eli more Mad Max tbh.
gamernews,38db1g,drAlMac,2,Wed Jun 3 15:48:06 2015 UTC,"I just think the more muted look adds to the sense of hopelessness and grim environment. We'll see anyway, hopefully they know what they're doing!"
gamernews,38db1g,xwatchmanx,2,Wed Jun 3 15:53:41 2015 UTC,"That worked for the previous games.   Judging from this trailer there seems to be a bit less hopelessness in Boston. The shot of that airship was in post-war, from what I could tell."
gamernews,38db1g,8DUXEasle,3,Wed Jun 3 15:58:54 2015 UTC,People said that about Diablo III as well. It was a pretty silly argument. You can have a gritty game with more than one tiny color palette.
gamernews,38db1g,Clockw0rk,4,Wed Jun 3 17:06:44 2015 UTC,All aboard!
gamernews,38db1g,virulentArachnid,4,Wed Jun 3 14:20:22 2015 UTC,"Hype, hype never changes."

gamernews,38db1g,filthy_sandwich,2,Wed Jun 3 22:43:18 2015 UTC,Pretty cool.
gamernews,38db1g,SaladWithHotDogsInIt,2,Wed Jun 3 14:09:09 2015 UTC,"Not worth getting hyped over yet with no ingame footage and few details shown, except that we might play before the wasteland got wasteland-ish."
gamernews,38db1g,filthy_sandwich,16,Wed Jun 3 14:17:34 2015 UTC,"Well it looks like they're still using their old as shit engine (see: the animations in the trailer), so you can expect the gameplay to be roughly the same as FO3/NV with a bit of whatever Skyrim was thrown in there."
gamernews,38db1g,virulentArachnid,5,Wed Jun 3 14:23:49 2015 UTC,"They really need to upgrade the lighting in this engine.  Also, the animations seem better this time around, but still rather stiff.  Don't get me wrong though, I fully expect this game to be fun and engrossing"
gamernews,38db1g,pizzabeer,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:15:10 2015 UTC,"All of bethesdas games feel stiff. I'm not sure if it's an artistic choice or if it really is just engine limitations. I won't lie. I threw 300 hours into skyrim, bought all the DLC and loved every moment of it. That said, the first thing I was disapointed about when I popped it in on 11/11/11 was that it was just as stiff as morrowind and oblivion in both the animation and the gameplay departments."
gamernews,38db1g,virulentArachnid,2,Wed Jun 3 21:17:56 2015 UTC,I just think they hire poor animators or have a team that's been there for ages and they won't let them go.  Animations are clearly not up to par compared to other games but they make their money back 100 times over already so who cares I guess.   A game like FO4 or Skyrim using the GtaV RAGE engine would be a dream come true.  The euphoria animation engine alone would make it fun
gamernews,38db1g,Madkat124,3,Wed Jun 3 23:31:12 2015 UTC,Wasn't it also leaked a while ago Fallout would move to the skyrim leveling system instead of the unnatural one it used to?
gamernews,38db1g,virulentArachnid,16,Wed Jun 3 14:26:01 2015 UTC,"I prefer the Fallout leveling system personally, less grindy."

gamernews,38db1g,robby7345,7,Wed Jun 3 14:35:54 2015 UTC,"Sounds plausible.  Shame, though, Fallout's campy roots made it one of the only RPGs where I actually appreciated the more classical rigid leveling system, skills, and perks."

gamernews,38db1g,SoberPandaren,9,Wed Jun 3 15:01:03 2015 UTC,"The green tint over everything ruined some of the immersiveness for me and a great deal of other players - so much that there's plenty of mods out there designed to remove that specific effect. When the mod scene for Fallout 4 eventually comes, I'm sure someone will make a mod to make everything green again.  As for the colors in that trailer, I think they're fantastic. In the wasteland, there's life and there's death. You can find thriving pockets of communities or you could find a few people in a house on their last legs. I think this pretty much illustrates the ""thriving community"" part anyway."

There is no reason nature wouldn't have reclaimed it by then.  I believe a more Pripyat-style wasteland would've been far more accurate, encroaching grass/forests among the ruins of human civilization and no reason why humans couldn't have nice organized settlements by then but still be surrounded by ruins."

Just because the trailer is from the dogs point of view doesn't mean it's going to be all about him, he's just a big part of the franchise for many people.

gamernews,388ume,WildVariety,32,Tue Jun 2 18:41:24 2015 UTC,Fair enough. Valve have surprised me. Though I'm sure this policy change is because of the Germans taking them to court rather than out of a desire to  do something good for the consumer.
gamernews,388ume,RobbieGee,9,Tue Jun 2 18:44:42 2015 UTC,"Even though I'm a Steam fanboy, I absolutely think that had a great influence. Valve haven't followed most European counties' laws regarding refunds and I'm surprised it took this long.   I also think Origin's refund policy and the year 2014 had some influence as well, ""The Year of Unfinished Releases"".  Hell, I'm even used to stores where I can return within 30 days  (or 45 days for http://komplett.no) for a full refund; they're going way beyond even Norwegian standards (which are extremely consumer friendly).  I'd go so far to say that Only companies that deserve it, will lose money from this."

As a company in an industry which can change instantly valve has to stay on top and that includes taking ALL their competition seriously.

gamernews,388ume,aido727,-1,Wed Jun 3 04:40:43 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, that's the consumer's fault. You can fall for hype and purchase a bad game and that shouldn't be grounds to make your money back; do some research first.  What refunds are GREAT for is for games that don't work properly on your system (or at all), or, as mentioned, when you buy a game and immediately it goes on sale for a lower price."
gamernews,388ume,Roike,-3,Tue Jun 2 22:26:16 2015 UTC,Then don't buy a game based on hype and actually do your research like you should do with any game anyway?  Do you just buy other products without figuring out what they actually are or can do just because they have amazing advertising?

gamernews,388ume,Sabbathius,7,Wed Jun 3 02:27:25 2015 UTC,"Hyperbolic response to moderately disappointing release? Mass refunds.   FTFY, more often than not."
gamernews,388ume,RobbieGee,4,Tue Jun 2 19:31:57 2015 UTC,"True. But let's face it, there's been multiple releases not too long ago that were just abysmal. Like ""Rage"", for example. For me personally, ""Rage"" simply didn't work. As in, the game crashed and burned when exiting the first room. Nothing I could do to fix it (and I have an extensive repertoire in that area) did the trick. Then, like 2 months later, they finally got around to patching that shit, and it started working fine. Actually a fairly decent game, after that, I really liked the ambiance of it.  Still, like an idiot I paid full $60 for it. And by the time they patched it so that it worked, it was already down to below $30. Now, I would have some recourse at least. Game doesn't run? Boom, refund. Enough people do that, and I'm sure Steam would get pissed at the devs. And devs aren't getting paid. As opposed to the old system, where they release shit and as soon as money exchanges hands they're free and clear.  Or ""Dead Island"". Again, a decent game, but for me it would periodically start doing this horrible high-pitched sound. And I tried everything to fix it, including on-board sound, a dedicated sound card and even headphones with their own built-in sound card. And I tried every audio configuration tweak through the config files that I could find. None of it worked. To the best of my knowledge, that still hasn't been fixed. By the time I got this game, it was dirt-cheap, so no biggie. But if I paid full price on release? I'd have been royally pissed.  So, yeah, I'm sure some people will do a knee-jerk. And some will even try to exploit the system (play for 1 hr, 55 mins, and demand a refund), though hopefully these will get banned fast. But decent games will have nothing to worry about. It's shitty and mediocre offerings that will suffer. And even then, some developers will get some slack. Like, currently I should be playing Witcher 3, but I ran into some nasty bugs and I'm waiting for a patch that was expected yesterday, and won't be released until at least tomorrow, and maybe even later. But these devs showed so much effort and are communicating well, so even if a refund was an option, it's not something many would consider.  All in all, I see this as a very, very, VEEEEERY good change for Steam. I was kinda leery of them after the whole Skyrim-mod-selling thing, but that's one heck of a positive move on their part."
gamernews,388ume,Sabbathius,2,Tue Jun 2 22:15:24 2015 UTC,"I'm certain developers that have a good relationship with the fanbase will get more slack. I admit I'm more extreme in my reactions and would refund a game from Ubisoft or EA on the spot if it was somewhat disappointing, but I'd wait for Witcher 3 as well. I paid full price for Witcher 3 and it is worth every single cent.  PS. Which bug did you encounter? I had some problems with my machine locking up completely, but after I did a complete removal of old gfx drivers via DDU and reinstalled the latest ones, everything has been fine so far.   ....I say fine, but really there have been a few bugs, but none that was stopping me from progressing or playing the game. Sometimes the camera has been acting up, positioned inside Geralts head once. Heads have been disappearing a few times, etc. Every time, a quicksave/reload has fixed the issue. In 150 playing hours so far (yes, I'm obsessed with the game) I haven't once encountered a bug that stopped me from actually playing the game."
gamernews,388ume,RobbieGee,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:45:17 2015 UTC,"I hit a number of bugs.  One was, I found Superior Beast Oil (T3), before finding T1 or T2. Then I found T1. I crafted T1, which removed the recipe for T1, and supposed to give me a T1 item. But it didn't. Recipe gone, no item. I repeated this a few times, same effect.  This is a bit different from another bug, which is just a display bug, which hides T2 or T3 recipe. That one is easy to fix, you take the oil or potion you crafted from inventory, destroy it, that brings back the T1 recipe, and then you craft both T1 and T2 (or T3) in one go without closing the alchemy window, and you're fine. The bug I hit though? It removed the recipe AND doesn't actually create the item when you craft it. So it can't be recovered from as easily. I could just use a dev console to fix my way out of it, but I'm hoping I'll just wait for the patch to fix it.  There's also the infamous XP bug, which isn't too bad, but still annoying. And an occasional crash. It's not a total show-stopper, I'm just running around exploring the points of interest and playing gwent, but I did stop with the quests for now.  Buddy of mine though got completely stonewalled by a bug. I'm not there yet, so I asked him not to spoil it for me. But basically there's an object he has to interact with to advance the main storyline, but he can't. So he's stuck. I experienced something like this during ""Wandering in the Dark"" quest, actually. There's this statue with loot in it, near where K gets attacked by rats. No matter what I did, I couldn't loot it. Then I went to help K, and doubled back to that room, and BAM, easily lootable! My guess is that because K was in the room beyond, down a short corridor, and the statue I was trying to loot was in line between me and K, it somehow ""bugged out"". And as soon as I advanced the quest with K free to move around, the statue became lootable. There's lots and lots of these little bugs.  The game's a masterpiece though. Absolute jewel. Bugs will be bugs, and eventually most of them will be squashed. But the game is just epic beyond words."
gamernews,388ume,Sabbathius,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:13:28 2015 UTC,"Ah, I haven't encountered recipe bugs, but I'll keep in mind to save before I attempt to fix it if I need to. Thanks!  And yes I agree, the only reason I accept these bugs is because the game is so freaking epic the rest of the time. Still, I recognize how incredibly hard it is to make a huge game like this and have no bugs, so I give some slack for that as well. All in all, Red seems to work full time squashing bugs as fast as they can. Tomorrow we'll probably get patch 1.05 that fix the XP bug and a host of other bugs as well."
gamernews,388ume,RobbieGee,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:25:07 2015 UTC,"Yep, definitely. The bigger the game, the more bugs it'll have. And to be fair, I had just as many in Skyrim. The first time I got the Daedric quest which starts with a drinking contest? I could drink until I'm blue in the face and I wouldn't pass out, and quest wouldn't advance. And that one was one of many. I then broke the vampire DLC because I didn't loot the item, and you can't get back there any more, so had to re-start. Shit happens. And yeah, keeping fingers crossed for tomorrow for the patch. But hey, if not, I can just run around obsessively finding and looting honeycombs! I wish this game had fishing though... :P"
gamernews,388ume,Phi03,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:39:44 2015 UTC,"I keep a rotation of savegames so if one leads me into a dead end (Edit: due to a bug), I don't have to restart completely. I'd miss an hour or two at worst. I also quicksave a lot.   I haven't went back to an earlier savegame though, unlike I did in Skyrim and Fallout. Choices in this game can have huge consequences, so it's not like missing a good gun as a reward, it's big enough that I'd like to replay this game. I've never done that with Skyrim/Oblivion etc. Everything would happen the same way and right at the end you could choose the good or the bad ending, no matter what your earlier actions had been.  In Witcher 3, I've seen my choices lead to quite dire consequences that had implications for the entire story and what was available to me in the game. It'd be interesting to see how that works out the next time. I just had a quest where I genuinely felt extremely bad about my choice, but the other choice was even worse. If the two of them survive, they might come for me later. Or I might have doomed us by leaving them to their fate without helping.  This is what makes the storyline so interesting and I wish I could talk in more specific terms about it, but I don't dare to spoil anything for others. I have one advice though: Stick with your choices no matter what! A story without something terrible happening will just dull the entire thing. I had one point where I sat for, probably 5 minutes, regretting my choice and hovering the mouse over the load button. I stuck with it, and I'm glad I did so."

gamernews,388ume,vplatt,0,Tue Jun 2 20:15:30 2015 UTC,"Hello,  Due to the new steam policy regarding refunds: > http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds  I would like to re-open this ticket to look into the possibility of a refund for this game. Although i have bought this game outside of the 2 week refund period (The refund system was not in place at the time of my purchase) However, If you look at my records for time spent on this game, it is under 2 hours.   I bought this game with the expectation of it getting more updates, the updates did not come, the developer ran away with the money and soon afterwards this game was pulled from the Steam Store. I have never requested a refund before for the 200+ games i currently have, and i'm a 10+ year Steam user. This is the first game i am making this request for and hope that you can help me with this.   Reply back:   Hello,  If you would like to request a refund for any reason, you can do so at https://help.steampowered.com/ If your request is made within fourteen days of purchase and the title has been played for less than two hours, you are eligible for a refund. Details can be found at the following page:  http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/   Yeah, so no luck here, terrible Steam Support continues. The refund system will not allow a refund as the game was purchased 1 year ago when it was released."

gamernews,388ume,vplatt,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:48:37 2015 UTC,I haven't used offline mode in a while - does that still exist?  If it does then this seems very exploitable.
gamernews,388ume,the_fascist,2,Tue Jun 2 20:50:48 2015 UTC,"Hmm.... I guess it could.  Eventually though, you're likely going to have to reconnect on that machine.  Won't Steam just update your stats at that point?  It would be easy for them to flag your account at that point in a report titled ""Hey look at this jerk!  S/he played this game WAY more than 2 hours on a REFUNDED title!"", then boom: consequences.  Maybe they don't have those kinds of counter-measures yet, but I'm sure they will soon.  Once they do this, you would have to know exactly where the usage data is stored and how to change it without tripping counter-measures.  Or you would have to have a fresh machine image you could just wipe out after playing the game.  Also, even with all that, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see when someone is using more refunds than can be considered reasonable.  Just add them to another category on the above report and administer the same consequences.  That's not something you can hide from Valve, because they have to do something on their end for you to get a refund.  So... I guess you're right.  But I don't know about ""very exploitable"".  You might get away with a couple times I would guess before you start showing up on reports and then get your account banned or limited.  And yes, then you could start new accounts, and start all over, but then it's a pretty simple fix to just limit the number of times the same credit card can be associated/used on different accounts.  Is there a way around that too?"
gamernews,388ume,AndrewNeo,8,Tue Jun 2 21:54:28 2015 UTC,Might as well pirate the games at that point rather than going out of your way to try and con the system.
gamernews,388ume,aido727,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:51:03 2015 UTC,"Offline mode doesn't nessicarily mean ""don't connect to Steam"", either.

gamernews,388ume,TerinHD,2,Wed Jun 3 01:16:38 2015 UTC,I thought they'd always done a refund before the game came out? After was the problem. (And you'd have to contact support directly)

gamernews,388ume,Alenonimo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:12:57 2015 UTC,There is also no in-client means of BUYING games so I don't see your point...
gamernews,388ume,aido727,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:47:42 2015 UTC,"Actually, there is. If you download one of those games from a free weekend and the free time expires, the installed game will have a button for you to ""purchase"" instead of ""play"". The purchase itself is handled by the site but the client knows when you have to buy a game you don't have.  What the previous comment said is that there's no way to just refund the game from the client, be it a button that redirects you to the proper site or anything."
gamernews,388ume,Alenonimo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:17:29 2015 UTC,"So it's a once off promotion type deal...  Regardless, does any service make it easy to get a refund? I don't understand why that would be expected."
gamernews,388ume,aido727,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:39:54 2015 UTC,"Actually, any time you have a game installed that Steam noticed you didn't purchase will have that option. You may log in another person's computer with different installed games, for example. Family share also comes to mind.  Steam updated the client, sayind it added an option for refunds, but I'm not seeing anything. Even if it was something buried on the ""Help"" menu, it would be appreciated."

If you want to get a refund, you go to that part of their website. If you want to buy games, you go to that part of the website.

Their support was extremely unhelpful. I got stuck in a ""It doesn't work"", to which support would reply ""Looks like it doesn't work"". When I'd ask if this issue would be passed on to the devs, at least to be considered for a fix, he said it would not. They're not fixing things. When I asked if that meant the game is unsupported, he said no. It's supported. I gave up shortly after that.  If they came back and said they were not fixing it because it was considered a niche issue, then fine. But it seemed like support was only there to tell you how to change pre-existing settings, and not to actually fix (or attempt to have fixed) any actual problems."

gamernews,383970,Hadrial,5,Mon Jun 1 22:32:38 2015 UTC,I wouldn't care them porting it to console. The issue is they will have to make it economic which means have one version abd that's when it becomes an issue. If they want to port it later to console by downgrading it sure why not. Bit credits to them for realising that. Way to many devs and publishers don't realize it and we end up with less optimal versions.

gamernews,383970,The_Vikachu,55,Mon Jun 1 16:58:02 2015 UTC,That's kind of the point of the... whole series.
gamernews,383970,majesticjg,4,Mon Jun 1 17:46:49 2015 UTC,You're forgetting the Bureau.  ...  I wish I could forget it too.
gamernews,383970,SimplyQuid,-43,Mon Jun 1 17:50:23 2015 UTC,It was cool in 1993 when that was the best the state-of-the-art could offer.
gamernews,383970,Patienceisavirtue1,22,Tue Jun 2 02:53:24 2015 UTC,"It's still got its place. There are plenty of turn based strategy RPGs out there. Just because it has guns instead of swords doesn't mean it needs to be another generic third person shooter.   As mentioned, the turn based strategy combat is kind of the entire point of the series."
gamernews,383970,SimplyQuid,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:52:30 2015 UTC,What other turn based strategy RPGs that are good are there? Cause XCOM scratched an itch I didn't know I had.
gamernews,383970,majesticjg,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:54:57 2015 UTC,Fire Emblem is of course the obvious choice. FF Tactics. Advance Wars. Mostly older games on hand held systems but on the plus side they're easy to find for emulators etc
gamernews,383970,Tmscott,-26,Tue Jun 2 16:40:55 2015 UTC,"I'd have prefered a more RTS approach. Watching my squad get chewed up because it's not my turn, yet, feels lame."
gamernews,383970,Nemokles,16,Tue Jun 2 17:44:06 2015 UTC,"Think more tactically, utilizing cover  and covering fire. Less fps. Turns simulate things like initiative and hyper reflexes."
gamernews,383970,SimplyQuid,13,Mon Jun 1 18:02:26 2015 UTC,"This just isn't the game for you. No shame in that, but it's a bit weird to expect it to be something different than what it is. Imagine if I, who quite like turn based strategy, made the reverse comment about a new Battlefield game; it looks nice and all, but this first person shooter thing is tired, it should be turn based! Or about a new Red Alert game, for that matter."
gamernews,383970,Nemokles,3,Mon Jun 1 18:13:55 2015 UTC,Exactly. I don't think people realistically expect a new COD game to come out as a visual novel or a tycoon/sim management game.
gamernews,383970,runtheplacered,4,Mon Jun 1 19:52:46 2015 UTC,"War Tycoon. Play as the Military Industrial Complex™, produce weapons, sell to states (or militias) and orchestrate wars, research new weapons technology, get a cat and thin, slick moustache."
gamernews,383970,Lowbrow,8,Mon Jun 1 21:51:25 2015 UTC,"You're whining that this game, that's always been turn-based, is turn-based?  So in other words, you didn't care about this franchise and you still won't, right?  I can't imagine why you think that opinion would matter to anyone.   Watching my squad get chewed up because it's not my turn   No, they got chewed up because you don't understand how to play these games, and obviously didn't do the ""tactical"" portion of the game correctly.  That's fine that you don't like it, but I can't imagine you're going to form a coherent enough reason that these games ought not exist at all."
gamernews,383970,billwoo,-1,Mon Jun 1 22:06:03 2015 UTC,If YOU cared about the franchise you'd know that XCom has let you choose between real time and turn based combat in the past. Not that anyone should care about franchises.
gamernews,383970,majesticjg,11,Mon Jun 1 20:27:41 2015 UTC,"It is still cool now, it's literally what makes the game good. There is no twitch component, or time limits on how long you can think: its a game of chess. In case you didn't know they tried changing the turn based mechanics in sequels to the original, and non of them had the same reception or accolades."
gamernews,383970,billwoo,-11,Tue Jun 2 00:38:17 2015 UTC,"or time limits on how long you can think: its a game of chess   That's the thing. Gunfights aren't a chess game. I'd love to see a more realistic RTS rather than sci-fi tanks with a bunch of hit points duking it out.   But, hey, we all like different things."
gamernews,383970,Sedsibi2985,-1,Mon Jun 1 18:03:53 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you get downvoted for this, reddit is retarded I guess... I think an RTS with the base and unit management of UFO would be pretty awesome, but I would want it to be a different game."
gamernews,383970,frezik,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:51:41 2015 UTC,"I think, an interesting option, would be to go the frozen synapse route, and do simultaneous turns. So you plan out your moves and any reactions you want for the current situation and the enemy does the same so they resolve at the same time, kind of like picking a play in football."
gamernews,383970,majesticjg,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:35:56 2015 UTC,"Nonsense. Dune II (something of a precursor to the Command and Conquer series) was released in 1992. Turn-based combat was chosen because it's a perfectly valid play style. X-COM 3 (off of the original series) also tried real-time combat as an option, and nobody liked that mode.  Now, I won't defend the snobs who say that turn-based games force you to take your time and think, but it's definitely a different kind of challenge that allows for a different kind of game."
gamernews,383970,BlackCoatDalov,20,Tue Jun 2 01:05:28 2015 UTC,XCOM has and always will be turn based tactical combat. It's pretty much one of the main facets of the game.
gamernews,383970,majesticjg,-29,Mon Jun 1 20:39:52 2015 UTC,"It was cool in 1993, but I'd strongly prefer more of an RTS approach now that we have the resources to pull it off."
gamernews,383970,Nemokles,19,Mon Jun 1 17:59:46 2015 UTC,"If you don't like it, tough. Go play an RTS. Stop arguing that XCOM should suddenly be an RTS because they have the resources to do it. By your logic, a Mario game should be a hack and slasher because Nintendo has the resources to make one. If you're really hurting for an RTS, go play Rise of Nations or Starcraft."
gamernews,383970,majesticjg,-21,Mon Jun 1 18:01:33 2015 UTC,"Gunfights aren't a chess game. I'd love to see a more realistic RTS rather than sci-fi tanks with a bunch of hit points duking it out.   But, hey, we all like different things."
gamernews,383970,ZanThrax,8,Mon Jun 1 18:04:57 2015 UTC,"Gunfights aren't a chess game.   And plumbers aren't fighting living mushrooms in real life. It's not really an argument to bolster your view, just a re-statement of it.  You want a more realistic RTS? Hey, I agree. That is missing from the current landscape. But it isn't this game."
gamernews,383970,Raper-Of-Mars,-13,Mon Jun 1 18:51:52 2015 UTC,And plumbers aren't fighting living mushrooms in real life.   As far as you know...
gamernews,383970,majesticjg,2,Mon Jun 1 19:55:28 2015 UTC,"But, hey, we all like different things   This is true. So why should one of the only games that hasn't been turned into yet another RTS or mediocre cover shooter be changed? Let those of us who have never liked RTS games have something to play. You can go play one of the approximately forty billion RTS games that come out every year instead."
gamernews,383970,Raper-Of-Mars,7,Mon Jun 1 20:01:51 2015 UTC,Then go play an RTS...
gamernews,383970,Shatterbrain,-8,Tue Jun 2 06:56:16 2015 UTC,"If I could find a good one that didn't play like a cartoon show and lose all sense of scale, I would! Sadly, Chris Taylor hasn't put out anything lately and I didn't go for Planetary Annihilation.   What I wanted from this game was a super-tense slower RTS that didn't give me a lot of time to think and didn't leave me sitting here watching the other ""team"" play out its turns. The turns shatter the disbelief, since we all agree life doesn't work like that."
gamernews,383970,majesticjg,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:23:54 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, there was either a gamemode or some kind of mod that added a timer to the game."

gamernews,383970,Axerty,-7,Mon Jun 1 20:16:53 2015 UTC,"I bought the original. In 1993.   I love the mythos. I love the fog-of-war. I love the uncertainty. What I don't love is that a 10 minute scouting/firefight takes an hour to play out. It feels slower than it should, IMO.   This just isn't a game for me. But I wanted it to be because of the other parts of it that I like."
gamernews,383970,AnorexicBuddha,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:51:14 2015 UTC,"Eh, fair enough I guess. From my POV, an RTS wouldn't provide as much tension when you make your decisions, and it's also easier to lose units completely by accident, which doesn't jive well with the ""trying to survive"" theme of XCOM. I could see pause 'n play maybe working alright."
gamernews,383970,majesticjg,2,Mon Jun 1 19:55:33 2015 UTC,I would strongly prefer if Need for Speed had more action RPG elements now that we have the resources to pull it off.

gamernews,381xxy,A_Loki_In_Your_Mind,7,Mon Jun 1 08:10:53 2015 UTC,... All this talk of the Advents gene therapy and efficient city centers actually reminds me of the X-Com organization itself.  A paramilitary organization with next to no oversight. Answering only to a shadowy anonymous council. With technologies far in advance of even the leading world powers.  This might be interesting.
gamernews,381xxy,destroy-demonocracy,3,Mon Jun 1 08:23:18 2015 UTC,"Meh, it went the opposite way for me :/"
gamernews,381xxy,DougyAM,4,Mon Jun 1 08:45:24 2015 UTC,"Pure speculation on my part:  Advent takes place after the events of Xcom EU, humanity has triumphed against the Alien threat and backwards engineered a lot of the Alien technology.  It already started during the actual war, with Xcom learning how to build better weapons and armour as well as using alien substances to physically physically and mentally.  Advent is a city built with the new technology and principles of humanity, but the rapid advance well beyond our natural technology curve will have enabled some less than moral things to take place and the game will focus on some sort of internal conflict that arises from that, possibly with Alien oversight. IIRC the game failed cinematic of Xcom is the council being revealed to be under the control of Aliens. Perhaps not all of the Aliens died and they have been trying to turn humanity on itself since the end of the war."
gamernews,381xxy,lotictrance,1 point,Mon Jun 1 09:04:19 2015 UTC,"Well, looks like you've got it kinda backwards. Apparently XCOM 2 is 20 years after unification under the aliens and the dissolution of XCOM. Now you're a guerilla team trying to fight back."

gamernews,383bvz,Koitenshin,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:39:33 2015 UTC,"I got it last night for my kids (2 copies).  Right now, it's still small.  The procedurally generated worlds don't have much in them.  Here's what it does have:   You can collect minifigs and use them as your character during the game.  You can also build your own character from parts of the minifigs you collect.  Some minifigs, like the warlock, have powers.  The warlock can shoot fireballs. There are lots and lots of  animals (we have dragons!!) and vehicles that you can use as transport. As for those animals and vehicles, you collect studs like currency as you could in other LEGO games.  You use these to summon animals and vehicles anywhere.  As long as you have collected them, they are always available.  for instance, you can summon a dragon anywhere at anytime for 10K studs. You also ""collect"" the environment.  When you come across something you don't already have, lets say a fence, it's added to your ""build inventory"".  You then use studs to place them anywhere. There is a free build where you choose the color and type of brick. About studs, they are EVERYWHERE.  Destroying or killing anything gives you studs, don't worry about a shortage. You will find treasure chests that have things like weapons.  These do not require studs to use.  They are added to your inventory and can be used at anytime. All things in your inventory are account bound.  If you start a new world, you already have all that stuff!   There is online play coming and they are adding underwater areas.  Right now, you cannot go underwater and, although you do swim in it, it doesn't have any sort of water physics yet.  If you destroy land near water, it doesn't flow.  It is early access, but my kids seem to be enjoying it so far.  They are Minecraft and Terraria fans as well as LEGO fans (we have thousands of blocks and lots of sets and all the LEGO games)."

gamernews,37y6kw,pdx-mark,5,Sun May 31 15:41:27 2015 UTC,This will be my seventh year playing Project Reality.  The ultimate tactical MMO FPS.
gamernews,37y6kw,Agret,2,Sun May 31 20:16:12 2015 UTC,It's not an MMO though..>
gamernews,37y6kw,BRPW1693,2,Mon Jun 1 05:36:22 2015 UTC,Is 100 people not considered MMO? What is the cutoff point? I've always wondered.
gamernews,37y6kw,Rqller,0,Mon Jun 1 08:30:16 2015 UTC,"While MMO stands for Massively Multiplayer Online, and 100 people surely being massive. MMO implies a continuously living world that you can jump in and out of whenever, like World of Warcraft, Conan, etc.   PR has consistent servers that you can join and leave as you see fit, however, the world changes from map to map."
gamernews,37y6kw,pdx-mark,3,Mon Jun 1 09:49:50 2015 UTC,"Massively Multiplayer Online   ...   A massively multiplayer online game (also called MMO and MMOG) is a multiplayer video game which is capable of supporting large numbers of players simultaneously. By necessity, they are played over a network, such as the Internet.[1] MMOs usually have at least one persistent world, however some games differ. These games can be found for most network-capable platforms, including the personal computer, video game console, or smartphones and other mobile devices.  MMOGs can enable players to cooperate and compete with each other on a large scale, and sometimes to interact meaningfully with people around the world. They include a variety of gameplay types, representing many video game genres. -wiki   The last highlighted sentence is very important regarding the worldly definition of MMO.  ""Some games differ""... As in, a persistent world is not needed in order to qualify as an MMO."
gamernews,37y6kw,heroicturtle,2,Mon Jun 1 19:52:29 2015 UTC,This is cool but why not just Arma?
gamernews,37y6kw,DougyAM,14,Sun May 31 15:44:12 2015 UTC,"Because while Arma does some things better it also does some things worse.  Namely its soldier movement and overall performance is much worse than the more arcade focused Battlefield 2 engine.  The original creators of Project Reality are making ""Squad"" which is PR's spiritual successor and is using the Unreal 4 engine."
gamernews,37y6kw,elessarjd,5,Sun May 31 16:15:11 2015 UTC,Never heard of squad up until now.  Appears they have a kickstarter going: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/offworldindustries/squad
gamernews,37y6kw,RoughPebble,4,Sun May 31 20:49:24 2015 UTC,"Hell yea, SQUAD is awesome. Check out Bluedrake42's youtube channel for some gameplay."
gamernews,37y6kw,BaneWilliams,2,Mon Jun 1 00:01:05 2015 UTC,"I really like Insurgency, outside of vehicular combat, what is different between it and SQUAD?"
gamernews,37y6kw,RoughPebble,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:34:48 2015 UTC,SQUAD has massive maps and allows squad leaders to set up FOB's in the same way you can in PR.
gamernews,37y6kw,Noahi,2,Mon Jun 1 13:17:28 2015 UTC,"I'm going to disagree with you.  Being in South Africa my latency to euro/us servers is in the 200-300 range. For some reason PR in BF2 is absolutely terrible with high latency where as ArmA 2/3 has better interpolation for high latency.  Because of the above simple movement, targeting and framerate are all laggy and overall a terrible experience."
gamernews,37y6kw,Rqller,18,Mon Jun 1 01:07:11 2015 UTC,"Two different games entirely. Arma is a full-on milsim where anything is possible. Project Reality is still a little casual, but with an emphasis on teamwork and communication. I play both games, and honestly, there's quite a large difference between these two games. The gameplay in Arma is largely free-form, usually you know your AO and what to do, but you don't have clear strategies, whereas in PR you essentially play the same missions on the same maps, but each squad leader decides to do something different each time, which means making a mortar crew and firing on a position in one game may not work in another. I'd recommend checking it out before dismissing it entirely.  I forgot to add, if you find PR interesting, but annoyed at the BF2 engine, you can check out Tactical Battlefield. Which is essentially a PR mod for Arma 3."
gamernews,37y6kw,Wintergore,7,Sun May 31 16:11:55 2015 UTC,There is also 'Squad' being developed which is basically project reality 2 built as a standalone game in unreal engine. https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/offworldindustries/squad
gamernews,37y6kw,Duhya,3,Mon Jun 1 00:02:59 2015 UTC,Also keep in mind this mod had been in production since Arma 1.

gamernews,37y6kw,DougyAM,11,Sun May 31 13:37:33 2015 UTC,Basically its a mod for Battlefield 2 which aimed to make the game much much much more realistic and team oriented.  BF2 recently stopped being supported by EA and you can no longer even buy it unless you find a physical copy in a bargain bin somewhere.  So they released this as a standalone which is technically illegal but unlikely to make EA do anything.
gamernews,37y6kw,carmshlonger,4,Sun May 31 14:49:14 2015 UTC,Popular Battlefield 2 mod. Added suppression effect and other tweaks to make it realistic.
gamernews,37y6kw,abeans07,-3,Sun May 31 14:38:35 2015 UTC,Why is this a big deal? BF2 is 10 years old 9 years old dead IMO
gamernews,37y6kw,enceladus7,5,Mon Jun 1 01:38:08 2015 UTC,"'Dead' would be wrong, when gamespy went down the community made it's own server hosting system which you can still find many servers on.  This is also big news because it no longer requires you to own Battlefield 2. This is essentially now a free game."
gamernews,37y6kw,abeans07,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:05:34 2015 UTC,That's cool i guess. Did the other/older battlefields get the same fate for server hosting?
gamernews,37y6kw,enceladus7,2,Mon Jun 1 02:14:33 2015 UTC,"Not 100% sure actually, I think there was talk of a 2142 community hosting service but I didn't follow it. 1942 I think got official support from EA when it went F2P on Origin."

gamernews,37tsyd,Time_Terminal,6,Sat May 30 20:05:24 2015 UTC,"Okay but beyond the gimmicks, was it a good movie?"
gamernews,37tsyd,rasheemo,37,Sat May 30 15:55:07 2015 UTC,The animation quality and acting is great. It tries to be a B-movie trashy 80's flick and does so very well while showing commitment to not just delivering a lame trash movie and excuse bad things with being trashy. It captures the feel very well. It has a decent humor if you like cheesy one liners. Due to it's short run time it does not over stay it's welcome and stays fresh with a decent amount of shoot locations and areas. Aside from the German soldiers speaking Swedish instead of German the dialog is what you expect and very well spoken by the actors. It avoids beating jokes and corny stuff in the ground like many other   Holllywood action movies ( even the non trashy ones) tend to do and unlike those it doesn't try to force plot or pretend like it is not what it is just an action movie. No boring love interest story side story is attached for the sake of it.  Bla bla bla.  It is a good movie.
gamernews,37tsyd,LaronX,27,Sat May 30 16:17:06 2015 UTC,"I mean, when you think about it, it makes sense for them to use the wrong language for foreign villains. The 70s and 80s were full of that."
gamernews,37tsyd,hype_corgi,12,Sat May 30 17:46:18 2015 UTC,That's a good point and it might be what they intended. But I personally feel that bad broken german could have had the same effect. But you are right it might have been for that reason.
gamernews,37tsyd,LaronX,10,Sat May 30 17:52:57 2015 UTC,I'd be hard-pressed to believe that anything done in this film wasn't totally intentional.
gamernews,37tsyd,Ergonomic_Prosterior,5,Sun May 31 00:47:15 2015 UTC,"The filmmakers were swedish, as well as those two actors playing the germans, speaking the wrong language was definitely intentional."
gamernews,37tsyd,callingcaerus,1 point,Sun May 31 07:26:20 2015 UTC,Its a mix of swedish and german. Maybe 60/40. Swedish and german share a lot of sounds and even direct words. so it overlaps a bit too.
gamernews,37tsyd,iTSSOGRiM,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:23:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for the thoughtful review!
gamernews,37tsyd,rasheemo,7,Sat May 30 16:33:46 2015 UTC,It's only 30 min. It's basically a high production value Rick and Morty episode.
gamernews,37tsyd,TheDorkMan,2,Sat May 30 18:38:12 2015 UTC,That was all I needed to convince me. Season 2 is so close now!
gamernews,37tsyd,Ergonomic_Prosterior,6,Sun May 31 00:48:53 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping I don't get downvoted for this but I didn't really enjoy it. I understand that it's supposed to be tropes and B movie acting but I thought it was bad from a film aspect. I find it a little ridiculous that people are falling head over heels for this movie and yet some Hollywood movies are called garbage for creating the same exact crap, but because this is an indie flick everyone loses their shit. Just my opinion though.  Edit: let me clarify by also saying I supported this from the start on Kickstarter, it just didn't turn out how I had expected. It had some issues with plot structure and a lot of issues with camera work and timing. The effects were great and the acting was passable, but really what ruined the experience was the poor timing. I mean, did we really need the awkward shot of Thor to be that long?"
gamernews,37tsyd,Veritasgear,6,Sat May 30 22:13:36 2015 UTC,This one is a parody.
gamernews,37tsyd,Pseutri,2,Sun May 31 03:44:36 2015 UTC,"Parody or not, that doesn't mean it should be excusable when there are awkward pauses and poor camera work. I supported this on kickstarter because I expected it to be similar to Blood Dragon. Now that would make an excellent movie."
gamernews,37tsyd,Veritasgear,3,Sun May 31 07:57:19 2015 UTC,Most people aren't saying great things about it.
gamernews,37tsyd,bongo1138,1 point,Sun May 31 04:34:51 2015 UTC,"I keep seeing people saying ""it's the best movie ever."" Yeah that's a bit of an exaggeration. Hopefully with the success of this movie the next one will be better."

I haven't seen it so I can't tell you my opinion, but my guess is that it's pretty pandering to an audience that thinks intentionally bad is good."
gamernews,37tsyd,bongo1138,2,Sun May 31 18:15:11 2015 UTC,"Hate to say I agree.  It was a little try-hard for the whole prior decade emulation thing.  Less would have been more.  A few things that got this very very right are:  Beyond the Black Rainbow, The F.P., Danger 5.  Speaking in terms of aesthetic, here."
gamernews,37tsyd,MAGICHUSTLE,2,Sun May 31 03:21:25 2015 UTC,And Blood Dragon. It had all the elements and perfect timing. I feel like if Blood Dragon had the same writers and a half decent director it would do well as a movie.

gamernews,37tsyd,ThirdProject,5,Sat May 30 17:35:00 2015 UTC,"As I recall, you only use two buttons or keys in this one, kinda like One Finger Death Punch. Should be pretty easy with most cabinets."
gamernews,37tsyd,Raiden1312,2,Sat May 30 17:45:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if you can't remap them to what the arcade keys are mapped to it can be a huge headache to change them."
gamernews,37tsyd,ThirdProject,1 point,Sat May 30 17:52:15 2015 UTC,Why? Mapping any keys to mouse buttons shouldn't me any harder in any decent operating system than writing a simple one-liner.
gamernews,37tsyd,seba_dos1,1 point,Sun May 31 15:11:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but most mame frontends don't work well with those. And it's not mapping to mouse buttons, it's more like mapping Left and RRight to be K and H or something to that effect. Anything that adds another step to the process risks taking focus away from the game so it launches behind the front end, then you're screwed."
gamernews,37tsyd,ThirdProject,1 point,Sun May 31 16:15:47 2015 UTC,That's a pretty poor system design to be honest.

Anyway though, my point was that EA didn't lose on SimCity. They sold a bunch of copies and made a ton of money. When all you care about is making money, that's a win."

gamernews,37pd6u,Obbz,2,Fri May 29 20:01:18 2015 UTC,Maybe they didn't. But Cities Skylines is definitely getting more than they bargained for. 250k copies sold within the first 24 hours of release and now to date they have sold over 1 million copies and its getting higher every day.

Sure, ""back in the days"", you wanted to be the evil mayor of a city, then bam, sim city was the answer. Want a good hack&slash? Diablo it is! Roaming murder? Assassin's Creed! Driving? Well I don't know to be honest, but I'm sure there's a big franchise out there that was the reference then slowly turned to turd.  Since these franchise have slowly been turned to what they are now, they are not ""sure sell"" anymore. Sure, their last iteration sold well, and the next one might still have a large fanbase. But when the metric they use will finaly tell a board of director ""you dun goofed"", it will be too late. It takes forever to build trust into a name...  This kind of things striked me recently, when I was thinking ""what are the big AAA titles I'm seriously hyped for?"". Biggest one was Witcher3, which is still relatively small in this market. Next to that... not much. A handful of kickstarter games and that's it. I can't even tell if the final part of starcraft 2 is out without some research, and I was waiting it at some point..."

Because it means if I want to install it on my laptop and play on a trip where internet is spotty, I can't play.

There's just never been anything like it, so it's hard to say.    It's a breath of fresh air in every category that makes up a video game (mechanics, controls, sound, visuals, etc.); especially in the shooter category, since innovation isn't exactly commonplace.    My biggest complaint is that it lacks 4p split screen and an overall lack of content.  The core gameplay is just phenomenal, but Nintendo has implied that more stages, weapons, and game types are coming.   Still.... really wish it had 4p split screen.  Do you just not like shooters at all?  If you do, which ones would you say are compelling and fun?"

gamernews,37oz8g,interbutt,5,Fri May 29 16:37:21 2015 UTC,"Well there's a few explanations for her youth:  For starters, she was dead but she has come back to life to settle her score with Heihachi in this game.  She died when Kazuya was still a young boy, so she was still young when she died.  The Devil Gene is presumed to slow aging, heihachi has tried to fuse the devil gene with his blood and Ogre's to make himself (unsuccessfully) immortal, and in Tekken Tag Tournament 2 he uses the devil gene to create a rejuvenation potion, reason why he looks young in that game, though, this game is not canon but one would think that the same science laws would apply.  She is Asian."
gamernews,37oz8g,Fine-line,2,Fri May 29 18:03:04 2015 UTC,"For starters, she was dead but she has come back to life to settle her score with Heihachi in this game.   That is a very Tekken explanation. I imagine her creation went down like this.   Let's make another hot asian woman.  But weren't we going to make Heihachi's wife?  Just make them the same.  Then why is this grandmother so young?  I don't know, she's back from the dead? Fuck it. Look at this concept art.  Sounds good, do it."
gamernews,37oz8g,interbutt,2,Fri May 29 18:11:02 2015 UTC,"She has been dead since Tekken 1 and we've known that, this wasn't something that just came up out of the blue.   At the time of her death she was barely a mother let alone a grandmother.  This isn't the first time this has happened, Jinpachi (Heihachi's father) has also came back from the dead in T5, with the same appearance he had at the time of his death so there's a point of reference as to why she doesn't look like a corpse instead."
gamernews,37oz8g,Fine-line,1 point,Fri May 29 18:20:39 2015 UTC,"Ok, maybe she's not out of the blue because we know that Heihachi had a dead wife.

I envisioned something where killing a bystander would be game over, you'd just need to adjust the behavior of the other cars on the road and the physics of how much damage is done during a collision where that could still require some skill to maneuver and rampant disregard for property damage would stay A-OK without it becoming tediously difficult."

Finisher moves are brutal too, I think it's a little bit more dark, before Batman softened up, just straight young angst and wanting to murder."

I wouldn't be surprised if one island in GTA4 is bigger than the whole city in, say, 1 or 2.  Like it could even make sense from a narrative standpoint, too.  Origins is a prequel, right?  It wouldn't be unreasonable to say ""the city was a lot smaller back then.""  But it's good to know I was wrong."

His sidekicks abandon him because he tends to shut them out, especially on important things.  Personally, I'm wondering if Kevin Conroy is simply getting natural ""old man"" timber in his voice or if they asked him to put a bit of Old Bruce a la Batman Beyond.  Oh my shit, a Batman Beyond game would be pretty awesome right about now."

gamernews,37l7in,78512378951237895321,1 point,Fri May 29 01:19:37 2015 UTC,IIRC when the game was first announced Rocksteady mentioned Batman being more violent than usual (and more closer to how he was portrayed in AO) was an intentional narrative decision. For example go back and look at the announcement trailer and at 3:06 he smashes a guys head through a window. In the previous game's Batman wouldn't have done something that violent to anyone so I think him acting more violently in Knight is something they're doing intentionally which will hopefully get addressed at some point in the story. I think Rocksteady said it has a lot to do with how the Joker's death affected him.
gamernews,37l7in,maxis2k,32,Fri May 29 16:16:51 2015 UTC,I liked the little tongue-in-cheek remark at the end   Who taught you how to drive?   Well obviously his pare....oh....

gamernews,37l7in,xxdofxx,-3,Thu May 28 16:35:43 2015 UTC,Ugh. The combat is so repetitive and button mashy.

gamernews,37l7in,spikeyfreak,12,Fri May 29 13:40:33 2015 UTC,"I think,  while you definitely have a point,  different people get different things from it.   Some people like the simplicity.  They just want to be batman and beat up a field of bad guys in slow motion with gadgets.   The other side of it,  is that the combat is actually pretty deep,  while its almost impossible to fail and ""die""  (because you can just stand there and spam the counter button forever)  pulling off perfect combos and stringing together gadgets with your takedowns all while dodging knives,  thrown objects,  and bullets is actually pretty difficult to pull off,  and so while ""not dying""  isn't really that satisfying,  pulling a perfect ""batman""  feels pretty beastly."
gamernews,37l7in,galactic_punt,12,Thu May 28 16:13:55 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah. I often times let myself be killed and just restart if I fail a combo in the Arkham games. To me the point of the combat is to get as high a chain as possible and there's no point otherwise.   Plus it's different playing the game and watching it. Yeah it looks like they're standing around when you're watching the game, but when you're playing you 2-3 moves ahead planning who you're going to stun next, making sure they don't get guns out or throw pieces of the environment at you. It's much deeper than it is at first glance."
gamernews,37l7in,spikeyfreak,3,Thu May 28 16:25:12 2015 UTC,You can't spam the counter button.  There are enemy types that can't be countered.  The stun baton guy will cause you to get shocked.  The police shield guy will just shield bash you.  And of course the guys with guns will just blast you to bits.
gamernews,37l7in,spikeyfreak,3,Thu May 28 20:53:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, but people like to circlejerk about how ""repetitive"" things are in a game when they don't have 15 strategies with 4 variations a piece."
gamernews,37l7in,CDNRedditor,0,Thu May 28 23:44:33 2015 UTC,"I appreciate this perspective.   I find it kind of silly multiple people asking me if ive played the series; yes.  To me the design speaks for itself as much to what it's trying to accomplish.  I feel it does it well, however I feel I look for more punishment in my decision making and execution.   Perhaps im masochistic, or perhaps its because im 35 and remember Nintendo games pushing my stress level to the limit.  However the sense of accomplishment to me has forever altered my tastes in the challenge of a game and how well designed the game play.   But I appreciate the point.

I hope that it's all just skins and stuff, but then city was missing all the cat woman stuff which actually seemed to be pretty much partof the main campaign that just wasn't there.  Love the games, but they are the worst for this sort of stuff along with Bioware. It has the opposite effect to what they want on me. It just makes me sit out their games until the complete edition comes out a year later or so, or I lose interest and don't get it at all.  Anyone know what the deal is with this one? Is there any actual story content missing now I don't preorder with the right place, or can you not even get everything, do you actually have to choose between options, because that would seem idiotic..."

It had absolutely wonderful parts to it. Like Walatiki battleground, which I loved. They took the good old Warsong Gulch, and added the twist that you can steal the flag back, and threw in round-robin flag spawn locations. That was absolutely brilliant, and I totally loved that thing. Played the shit out of it. Then again, I'm the kind of sicko that really loved Huttball too, in SWTOR. We had a team that prided ourselves on winning matches with 0 kills, and really low damage done (what damage we did, came from CC abilities, not damage abilities). It was absolutely awesome.  But the rest of Wildstar? Very meh. Heavily instanced world, completely disjointed. Like, you'd go to a new zone and without looking at the map you'd have absolutely no concept as to where that zone fits into the world. Whereas successful MMOs, like WoW, formed contiguous land masses where you see the terrain change from one zone to next, and the world just feels solid and believable.  And it didn't help that they went for pedobear cutesy stuff with the whatever that race with ears and tails was called. Or that race of space bunnies giving you quests. Just rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. And quest themselves for the most part were completely flat and uninspired. And class balance was atrocious at best.  So, yeah, can't say I'm surprised this happened."

Blizzard is known for being a very thorough company and I'm sure they have tested to find the best FOV for their game. I could imagine it playes into the sense of speed and how hectic the game becomes when you can't see so much infront of you opposed to when you have a higher (larger?) FOV.  And I agree with the unfair advantage; the levels are buildt up to be engaging and force players into designed encounters. If you see 'too much' that probably would change it into your favour.   BUT I get why some people wants to change it since they get physical reactions to it. Hope Blizzard listens to the complaints about the queasy-ness and tries to make changes accordingly."

I prefer to play at roughly 85-90 as that's closer to what our actual FOV is when we look straight ahead, if you're using a eyefinity setup than you need closer to 180 to simulate an actual human FOV.   The approximate field of view of an individual human eye is 95° away from the nose, 75° downward, 60° toward the nose, and 60° upward, allowing humans to have an almost 180-degree forward-facing horizontal field of view.[citation needed] With eyeball rotation of about 90° (head rotation excluded, peripheral vision included), horizontal field of view is as high as 270°. About 12–15° temporal and 1.5° below the horizontal is the optic nerve or blind spot which is roughly 7.5° high and 5.5° wide   Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye#Field_of_view"

And yeah, even if we are able to manually change our FOV sliders, it still sucks that they won't have a slider in the initial release.

gamernews,37h7bz,Notsomebeans,6,Wed May 27 18:44:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly, and I know this is going to sound ""circle-jerky"" but I just feel like the original vision of the game was brushed aside when they introduced the MannCo store.  I am not against companies making money off their games by any means, but when it stopped being purely cosmetic and moved into an area that allowed people to buy guns, 2 things happened:  I no longer knew what was coming at me. Does that demoman have a grenade launcher? A sticky launcher? a sword? Does that heavy have a minigun or a natasha? Shotgun? Sandvich?  And yes, I know the counter argument is ""but those add depth! make you think!"" and I agreed, when each class had only 1 alternate weapon for each slot, but as time went on and classes got more and more and more weapons it became impossible to asses a threat before engaging it, which was the main reason that all of the TF2 characters were shaped so differently. If you listen to the developer commentary, they talk about all the work they put into you having the ability to determine what was coming at you, even in low light, or in a fast-paced area, and with the MannCo store, that balance, that role-oriented gameplay, died.    The second thing that happened was that Guns were being pushed constantly because valve wanted to make money off them. This feeds into and exasperates my first point.  I would still be playing TF2 to this day if there were vanilla servers. The beta of TF2 is the most fun I've ever had and I clocked 2k hours in TF2 total before the MannCo update."
gamernews,37h7bz,roogen,1 point,Wed May 27 21:43:28 2015 UTC,are you expecting blizzard to be heavy on the content updates?
gamernews,37h7bz,Robot_xj9,9,Wed May 27 20:11:39 2015 UTC,Of course! Why wouldn't you assume blizzard will be heavy on content updates? just look at all of their other current games.
gamernews,37h7bz,roogen,0,Wed May 27 21:02:00 2015 UTC,Yeah! I mean hearthstone has been out over a year and they've added a STAGGERING 185 cards!
gamernews,37h7bz,Robot_xj9,7,Wed May 27 21:49:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think Hearthstone is directly comparable to a card game like Magic, which releases only slightly more new cards a year, considering a lot of the cards they print are reprints of old cards. They've also released an entire new game mode, a phone version of the game, spectator mode, in addition to the 185 cards you mentioned. This is all with their smallest team on an active game at Blizzard; it's known that Overwatch has a much larger team than Hearthstone."
gamernews,37h7bz,funkyb,1 point,Wed May 27 21:59:06 2015 UTC,"It was mostly a joke, but I honestly think that hearthstone has far too little cards to be interesting, you see the same decks time after time, it's fine for casual play, which is what it's designed for, but there's simply not enough depth for me to really enjoy it.  Anyways, my opinion is that they should have released roughly ~300 new cards by now, but hey, that's what's great about opinions, you don't have to agree!"
gamernews,37h7bz,UniversalVariable,7,Thu May 28 19:46:27 2015 UTC,"One thing jumping out to me is that it's much less vertical than TF2.  The jumping seems more realistic and lower and fewer classes seem to be able to make large jumps like you see from the soldier, demo, and scout (and even engineer, pyro, and medic in certain situations).  The level design, too, looks closer to a CoD than TF2."
gamernews,37h7bz,TacoMcD,9,Wed May 27 20:04:15 2015 UTC,"Hanzo can run up walls. Pharah has a jet pack. Reaper can teleport to anywhere he can see. Windowmaker has a hookshot she can climb with. Mercy has a player teleport as well as a slowed descent. Winston has a jump pack as well. There's certainly not as much juggling/zoning as there is in TF2, but this seems a pretty far cry from CoD on every level. The maps seem far more stream-lined and less cover ridden than CoD's, and these maps are also inherently objective based like TF2s."
gamernews,37h7bz,carzy91,5,Wed May 27 23:10:00 2015 UTC,"and that's bad, why?"
gamernews,37h7bz,monkeyjay,-3,Wed May 27 18:36:48 2015 UTC,"Didn't say it was bad, didn't say it was good, just looks like more of the same to me."
gamernews,37h7bz,Robot_xj9,2,Wed May 27 21:43:15 2015 UTC,"So you made a comment with literally no content or opinion? It's pretty likely you meant it as a dig, or at least a sneer (I'm an internet detective and can tell by the '..' at the end). A sneer that is made with every mention of this game.   Yeah it's TF2 with differences. The differences being the bit people are excited about. Characters have ultimate abilities, and special abilities not tied to their weapons or ammo. You aren't making choices about loadouts so far as we can tell (whether you like that or not is another story). There are more classes to choose from with more defined 'roles'. Seems to be a lot more defensive options with shielding and denial abilities. In general a few of mechanics that tf2 doesn't focus on, like more character mobility in different ways (climbing, teleports, flying)."
gamernews,37h7bz,drizztmainsword,2,Wed May 27 22:08:37 2015 UTC,"It obviously takes inspiration from TF2, which isn't a bad thing. TF2 was amazing when it was released, I'm happy to see companies building upon the principals it originally had.   That being said, I don't think anyone would have an easy time arguing  that it's a TF2 clone, it's obviously a much different take on semi-casual scalable asymmetrical FPS gameplay."
gamernews,37h7bz,StokeYdral,4,Wed May 27 21:39:15 2015 UTC,"But everything had a cooldown timer? Sure, she has three stacks of it, but those stacks come back slowly, essentially a cooldown."
gamernews,37h7bz,monkeyjay,3,Wed May 27 17:36:23 2015 UTC,I feel like he probably missed that there were charges and a CD timer. I initially missed it as well since I was expecting it to be around the edges of the screen with the rest of the HUD.
gamernews,37h7bz,abdbatman112,2,Wed May 27 17:48:06 2015 UTC,"There will most likely be an overlay on the ability showing when the charges are coming back too, like on the rewind time ability. Seems to be an early ui thing with that little tiny '3'.   EDIT: I'm silly, the three chevrons in the middle of the screen also show her boost ability charges."
gamernews,37h7bz,drizztmainsword,-11,Wed May 27 18:51:52 2015 UTC,"She needs a cooldown nerf for her teleport, right now she is waaay ahead of most other characters."
gamernews,37h7bz,digital_misery,18,Wed May 27 19:58:55 2015 UTC,Yep. We can totally make balance calls on stuff like this.

gamernews,37h7bz,IMSmurf,-6,Wed May 27 17:48:43 2015 UTC,I feel like this game is going to have the steepest learning curve I've ever encountered.

gamernews,37cmtl,Veritasgear,11,Tue May 26 19:41:32 2015 UTC,Well that gives me hope that it will be a good game if they use the Witcher 3 team now that they have completed it.
gamernews,37cmtl,DrStalker,20,Tue May 26 20:28:35 2015 UTC,CDPR might get some little things wrong (No control over FOV without hacking the game with cheat engine?) but they have nice solid releases that never feel rushed.  The fact they won't even talk about this game for two years after finishing Witcher 3 suggests they know how much time they need and they intend to take it.
gamernews,37cmtl,randomly-generated,10,Tue May 26 22:47:02 2015 UTC,I'll never understand why devs don't just let people control the damn field of view.  I thought that was a standard feature 15 years ago.
gamernews,37cmtl,gizza,2,Wed May 27 01:40:34 2015 UTC,Do any 3rd person games have FOV control?
gamernews,37cmtl,Hopelesz,1 point,Wed May 27 06:14:56 2015 UTC,The elderscrolls games have fov control through console.

gamernews,37cmtl,twoVices,-1,Wed Jun 17 00:12:14 2015 UTC,a couple thoughts:  it can be an exploit?  it detracts from immersion?  performance issues?
gamernews,37cmtl,DrStalker,12,Wed May 27 02:27:00 2015 UTC,Exploits mean nothing in a single player only game.  Proper FOV adds to immersion. Issues with cut scenes would be fixed if the game properly supported fov (so I could play on 80 and watch cut scenes at 60)
gamernews,37cmtl,twoVices,-22,Wed May 27 03:00:33 2015 UTC,"hey that's super great.  thanks for the downvote.  dude says he doesn't understand something.  i throw out a few ideas.  your opinions are sure nice, though.  thanks for sharing them like they're facts."
gamernews,37cmtl,Reynbou,0,Wed May 27 03:49:09 2015 UTC,"Except FOV is literally tied to your screen size. So none of those excuses actually make sense excluding performance. So ""because consoles"" basically is the likely reason."
gamernews,37cmtl,randomly-generated,1 point,Wed May 27 08:53:59 2015 UTC,And performance is not an argument because if you had a choice to not use a higher fov because your computer sucks you could just not use it.
gamernews,37cmtl,Veritasgear,3,Thu May 28 19:02:25 2015 UTC,"Better than pulling a COD or Ass Creed... hope it's worth the wait. A little silly to put out that CG trailer so early, though."

gamernews,37cmtl,Konradov,2,Wed May 27 06:14:56 2015 UTC,I've been playing since release and I just found out its separated into acts. I guess I'll be at it for a while.

gamernews,37cmtl,yogi89,2,Wed May 27 08:52:16 2015 UTC,Are you only doing the main quests?
gamernews,37cmtl,echolog,2,Wed May 27 06:06:55 2015 UTC,It's easily a 50-60 hour game if you JUST rush the main story and do basically nothing else. It took me 70 on normal while only doing the contracts and treasure hunt side quests. I can definitely see it taking much longer on a higher difficulty or if you're going for a completionist playthrough.
gamernews,37cmtl,SirKillsalot,37,Wed May 27 09:58:01 2015 UTC,Why the hell did they announce it so early then?
gamernews,37cmtl,JorBob,28,Tue May 26 19:49:02 2015 UTC,"The announcement trailer was, in part, a job ad.   They had that frame near hidden near the end about it."
gamernews,37cmtl,spencer32320,9,Tue May 26 23:07:03 2015 UTC,They announced it to get developers interested so they could attract good ones for the development of the game.
gamernews,37cmtl,dontlookatmeimnake,47,Wed May 27 00:42:14 2015 UTC,It's like announcing you're pregnant the day before you fuck.

gamernews,37cmtl,BBQ4life,1 point,Wed May 27 11:28:08 2015 UTC,Best to always just ignore anything a 14 yr old says.  Reduces chances of getting grey hairs.
gamernews,37cmtl,Shatterbrain,-1,Wed May 27 13:49:24 2015 UTC,"The difference is that Inquisition was praised by console gamers with lower graphical standards, and Witcher 3 is criticized by PC gamers who expected better from CDPR."
gamernews,37cmtl,TheRepostReport,0,Wed May 27 13:51:21 2015 UTC,What the fuck does that even mean?
gamernews,37cmtl,Konradov,-6,Wed May 27 13:04:32 2015 UTC,It looks alright but the point is they sent the graphics straight into the ground so that previous gen consoles could run them. The Witcher 3 would look 10 times nicer if not for being massively downgraded for consoles. The fact that you don't know or you openly deny that is proof you don't know anything about the game's graphics and that you probably shouldn't be talking.
gamernews,37cmtl,Masteryeoj,8,Wed May 27 06:13:54 2015 UTC,"In a recent interview they pointed out that if the game couldn't run on current generation consoles it wouldn't exist - or it would be a shadow of its current scope. PC gamers that buy RPGs don't have enough cash between them to make creating a huge game (with a crazy long development cycle) like that even possible.   Severity of the downgrade aside, it's a damn good point to consider when we talk about everything The Witcher 3 could have been as a PC exclusive."
gamernews,37cmtl,andycoates,1 point,Wed May 27 14:51:34 2015 UTC,"Well, they should've done what Rockstar did: release a console version earlier to get that sweet console money and then release a definitive version with all the bells and whistles on the pc a year later. That way, CDPR gets what they want (tons of cash) and pc gamers get what they want (a game at the bleeding edge of pc technology)."
gamernews,37cmtl,callingcaerus,3,Wed May 27 06:01:26 2015 UTC,They'll probably patch the better graphics in
gamernews,37cmtl,TheRepostReport,8,Wed May 27 06:43:53 2015 UTC,"Nowhere in that sentence did I mention anything about the graphics being downgraded. Don't try and put words in my mouth.

gamernews,37cmtl,fatsack,-6,Wed May 27 07:26:02 2015 UTC,"It's really nothing spectacular, Witcher 3's graphics are pretty average at best. Crysis 1 had comparable graphics in 2007, 8 years ago."

gamernews,37cmtl,callingcaerus,-7,Wed May 27 06:20:33 2015 UTC,"No, but everybody else's points were that the graphics were downgraded and you don't know what you're talking about. One of the better games, sure, but it was still severely nuked."

It makes sense because W3 is so huge and rich in content it needed a lot of people working on it and CDPR has limited budget -> manpower. Also the cinematic from 2013 was created by Platiage Image which outsources all cinematics for CDPR so they didn't have to work on it at all.

gamernews,37buf4,DocSeuss,1 point,Wed May 27 07:33:52 2015 UTC,Aww damn.
gamernews,37buf4,Veritasgear,6,Wed May 27 14:38:24 2015 UTC,The trailer looks decent but why are the animations so stiff?  I think that criticism might apply to all video games actually.  Are the wire frame models that they apply physics to just too low poly to mimic smooth motion?  It feels like animation is the one thing that keeps games from really starting to look like CG movies.
gamernews,37buf4,sonicmerlin,7,Tue May 26 18:59:43 2015 UTC,"They may have strictly hand animated instead of motion capture then tweaking it.   The models definitely have enough geometry to be animating well.   That said, animations look ok to me.  Can't expect Shadow of Mordor quality here, the budget is no doubt quite a bit less"
gamernews,37buf4,filthy_sandwich,1 point,Tue May 26 21:25:16 2015 UTC,"Geometry has basically no bearing on the smoothness. Secondary motion like physically responsive soft tissues and cloth, sure, but the skeletal animation doesn't depend on poly count whatsoever. filthy_sandwich is probably correct in assuming that a lot of it was hand-animated, but it also comes down to how their engine handles playback and blending, that can really kill it."
gamernews,37buf4,startyourengines,12,Wed May 27 15:26:01 2015 UTC,If they have that nemesis system from Shadow of Mordor I might be interested.
gamernews,37buf4,bmystry,16,Tue May 26 18:12:52 2015 UTC,What an obscure thing to ask for.
gamernews,37buf4,Veritasgear,3,Tue May 26 18:17:44 2015 UTC,Isn't it being developed by the same guys? The guys that also made the Batman games? They seem to be using pretty similar stuff between games and it's been working so far.
gamernews,37buf4,bmystry,3,Tue May 26 18:19:04 2015 UTC,Rocksteady made batman. This is being made by avalanche studios and published by wb. I doubt it'll have the nemesis system
gamernews,37buf4,YXAYXA,3,Tue May 26 18:32:30 2015 UTC,Guess I just combined all the wb games to be from the same people. Shadow of Mordor has the exact same combat system as the Batman games but its open world and has the nemesis system which is the vibe I was getting from this trailer.
gamernews,37buf4,bmystry,1 point,Tue May 26 18:43:25 2015 UTC,"I mean, I guess the nemesis system could be in it but there's really no way to tell yet."
gamernews,37buf4,YXAYXA,5,Tue May 26 18:46:18 2015 UTC,I thought it was being developed solely by Avalanche but now I see that it is indeed being codeveloped by WB games. That would make sense with the Arkham style combat in the game. Good observation.
gamernews,37buf4,Veritasgear,2,Tue May 26 18:26:52 2015 UTC,The fighting looked similar but seeing the big boss dudes made me think of the Shadow of Mordor nemesis system.
gamernews,37buf4,bmystry,6,Tue May 26 18:32:08 2015 UTC,"Holy shit. This is the perfect place to cement the nemesis system as an actual game mechanic rather than a novelty. I can just imagine the different Warlords and stuff in game across a massive open world, driving to different areas. It makes me think somewhere along the lines of Red Faction Guerrilla ."
gamernews,37buf4,defea5ter,0,Tue May 26 20:45:07 2015 UTC,"I think the big boss dude is Scrotus or something, I believe he is the main villain in the game, according to game informer, anyway. I could be wrong though, that would be a cool game mechanic."
gamernews,37buf4,Veritasgear,1 point,Tue May 26 18:37:54 2015 UTC,"Uh... where are you seeing the co-development thing? Afaik, it's just Avalanche. WB's only publishing. I'm assuming the combat is in there because it's a pretty good combat system that's seeing increasing popularity in the industry (Sleeping Dogs was published by Square, but it's got similar combat, for instance, and Assassin's Creed, which is a Ubisoft series, has borrowed from Arkham as well).  Warner Bros Games Montreal is not working on this, as best I can tell. Neither is Rocksteady. Those are the two Batman developers."
gamernews,37buf4,DocSeuss,1 point,Wed May 27 07:33:08 2015 UTC,Oh okay so it IS just Avalanche. That was my initial thought.
gamernews,37buf4,Veritasgear,1 point,Wed May 27 14:38:12 2015 UTC,It's all good.
gamernews,37buf4,DocSeuss,3,Wed May 27 14:42:00 2015 UTC,"I really wished for Rage-Fallout stylized game. Massive (yet populated) open world, cars (of course), and some fps gameplay"

gamernews,37buf4,BlackAera,8,Tue May 26 15:08:25 2015 UTC,It's WB. You'll get fucked over with DLC at the least.
gamernews,37buf4,TerraChron,10,Tue May 26 18:19:28 2015 UTC,"I can't tell what's cut scene and what's gameplay,but this doesn't look that great in my opinion"

Honestly I find the overwhelmingly positive comments in this thread a bit suspicious, given how generic and lackluster this trailer was."
gamernews,37buf4,eldubyar,4,Tue May 26 20:48:13 2015 UTC,"I think the game would have been good 5 years ago, but too many ""open world"" games recently have followed the same formula.. JC2, AC, FC, Mordor, Batman, so it's just tiresome now. I feel like i'm playing the same game reskinned."

The good news is the vehicular gameplay will be fun, the bad news is the story will most likely consist of visiting red checkpoints on your open world map, doing the same repetitive base takeover, and turning them green to find more parts for your car."
gamernews,37buf4,CDNRedditor,2,Tue May 26 17:03:45 2015 UTC,"No, its because he criticized the game for no reason when all he had seen was the cinematic trailer."

gamernews,37buf4,boot20,1 point,Tue May 26 20:54:52 2015 UTC,The wasteland is no place for a conscience.   Pretty much the opposite message of the movies.
gamernews,37buf4,ZuP,2,Tue May 26 23:18:55 2015 UTC,That was a solid fucking trailer. Looks like a blast.
gamernews,37buf4,CoolGuySean,2,Tue May 26 17:02:46 2015 UTC,"If this came out 7 years ago, it would really look promising. Not saying it will be awful but it's a long way from spectacular."
gamernews,37buf4,rb_tech,1 point,Wed May 27 01:27:21 2015 UTC,"For anyone interested, Jeff Gertsmann from giantbomb.com talked about what he played of the game for E3 judge stuff on the newest Giant Bombcast.   For a quick summary:  Not too directly tied into the movie, few characters mentioned, NOT a Tom Hardy Mad Max, few areas that were mentioned in the film.  The combat is more focused on car combat than on foot. The developers really seemed to push that the main focus of the car combat will just be ramming into enemies.  He seemed to say that most people werent overly impressed with it, but this is a pre-release build so in theory there is still stuff they can tighten up."
gamernews,37buf4,Bologna_Ponie,1 point,Wed May 27 06:41:22 2015 UTC,Arkham series style combat with lethal moves? Yes please.
gamernews,37buf4,Frosty7130,-3,Wed May 27 18:45:30 2015 UTC,"Never get hyped for movie tie-ins. Concept looks promising, but odds are the game will be a disaster."
gamernews,37buf4,strobrod,16,Tue May 26 15:08:59 2015 UTC,"However, this is not anymore a movie tie-in, then Arkham City was a movie tie-in for the Dark Knight Rises."

gamernews,37buf4,PiR8_Rob,4,Tue May 26 19:18:22 2015 UTC,Thats like saying because the Dark Knight and Arkham City both had the Joker then Arkham City must be a movie tie in
gamernews,37buf4,PandaStyle00,-4,Tue May 26 19:20:56 2015 UTC,"Oh really? Immortan Joe was a pre-existing character in the Mad Max universe? Keep gobbling up the hype, man. A fool is quickly parted from his money."
gamernews,37buf4,PiR8_Rob,4,Tue May 26 19:24:56 2015 UTC,One reference to a movie doesnt make it a movie tie in.
gamernews,37buf4,PandaStyle00,-4,Tue May 26 19:26:56 2015 UTC,"Right, because they told you so. It's not like movie tie-ins have a bad reputation. Not like a game developers have ever lied to boost sales."
gamernews,37buf4,PiR8_Rob,1 point,Tue May 26 19:31:35 2015 UTC,I think you're confused. Mad Max existed before the movie. There is a Mad Max Universe with certain themes and characters. The movie just used those themes and characters to create their own story. The game did the same thing to create their own story.
gamernews,37buf4,CharmExclusive,1 point,Wed May 27 07:09:13 2015 UTC,"Because they told you so   What the fuck does that even mean? They are separate, the movie and the game.    Despite releasing in the same year, the video game is not directly connected to the 2015 film Mad Max: Fury Road, and was never planned as a tie-in. As a result, the game's setting and story is original and standalone"
gamernews,37buf4,PandaStyle00,1 point,Tue May 26 19:34:30 2015 UTC,"Warner Brothers are publishing a Mad Max game four months after they themselves release the first Mad Max movie in 30 years. Do you really think this is a coincidence?  No real way to prove it either way, I guess, but it sounds pretty unlikely to me."
gamernews,37buf4,strobrod,2,Tue May 26 20:35:01 2015 UTC,"It says that they were going to make 2 Mad Max games, but the one in development for the movie tie in was scrapped"

gamernews,37buf4,PiR8_Rob,3,Tue May 26 19:37:46 2015 UTC,"Just shut up, you sound like a conspiracy nutjob"
gamernews,37buf4,PandaStyle00,2,Tue May 26 19:53:17 2015 UTC,Don't know why you're getting downvoted for telling the truth. All the cars in the game look like they were modeled after the ones in the new movie. The people who are buying into the hype about it not being a movie tie-in are the same people who bought Gearbox's bullshit about Colonial Marines. http://i.imgur.com/J4LFqmG.jpg
gamernews,37buf4,PiR8_Rob,3,Tue May 26 18:44:04 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's Reddit. General pissyness? Corporate shills for Warner Bros? The Illuminati?  Anyone's guess, really."
gamernews,37buf4,strobrod,1 point,Tue May 26 20:45:31 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not a movie tie in, just happens to be releasing the same year as a Mad Max Movie."
gamernews,37buf4,Jaywearspants,3,Tue May 26 16:18:41 2015 UTC,"It's still a movie tie-in, man. Last I checked the first Mad Max movie was produced in the 70's.   Could argue that it's not an explicit tie-in to Fury Road, but the design clearly shows that they're borrowing heavily from it. Production on Fury Road started in 2010, mind.   And I seriously doubt it's a coincidence that they're releasing it now. Or that it's getting distributed by Warner Brothers Interactive."
gamernews,37buf4,strobrod,1 point,Tue May 26 20:23:10 2015 UTC,It's no more a movie tie in than Arkham Asylum is. It came out with The Dark Knight.
gamernews,37buf4,Jaywearspants,2,Tue May 26 20:49:23 2015 UTC,"Batman is a comic book series that has been published virtually non-stop since the 1930's by DC, spawning countless movies, games and other adaptations over the years. Hardly like the movie and the game were released in a vacuum.  Warner Brothers, on the other hand, will publish a Mad Max game four months after they themselves release the first Mad Max movie in 30 years.  I see your point, but I'd say there are some pretty obvious differences."
gamernews,37buf4,strobrod,2,Tue May 26 21:17:47 2015 UTC,What stops it from being a movie tie-in? It has references to characters only found in the new movie and new universe.
gamernews,37buf4,stanley_twobrick,-2,Tue May 26 20:10:09 2015 UTC,"The movie was actually a tie-in to the game. Game's been in development long before the movie was even filming.  Furthermore, some movie tie-in games are great, have you played any of the riddick games? They don't look amazing, but I promise you they are some of the best games you've never played."
gamernews,37buf4,Robot_xj9,3,Tue May 26 16:41:06 2015 UTC,The movie was actually a tie-in to the game.   I doubt that very much.
gamernews,37buf4,pinkshirtfedora,0,Tue May 26 17:51:10 2015 UTC,"Well the game was in development first, and I highly doubt it's a coincidence that they are both releasing this year, I actually addressed this in another comment and said:   I find it hard to believe that there was zero collaboration between the two studios. Which ever was planned first probably was the inspiration for the other, it's highly unlikely, in my opinion, that 2 pieces of media from the same source material being released relatively close together are completely separate entities. I may be being a bit pedantic, maybe you meant that neither was a ""tie-in"" in the sense that neither's story, art direction, etc influenced the other, and in that aspect I think you're correct."
gamernews,37buf4,Robot_xj9,3,Tue May 26 22:19:47 2015 UTC,"Thing is, the movie would have had drafts and concepts presented years ago, very possibly predating the game."
gamernews,37buf4,pinkshirtfedora,0,Tue May 26 22:29:18 2015 UTC,"A fair point, but we're starting to blur the line between ""tie in"" and ""same source material"", my point is that not every single project that uses the same source material is tied into the other projects."
gamernews,37buf4,Robot_xj9,2,Tue May 26 23:45:51 2015 UTC,"Didn't say all movie tie-ins are bad, but they always warrant skepticism. Of course there are exceptions to the rule, like Riddick, like the Lucasarts Indiana Jones games, a bunch of great Star Wars games, etc. But for every one of those, there are a ten or twenty others that are just absolute garbage."
gamernews,37buf4,strobrod,1 point,Tue May 26 19:47:13 2015 UTC,"But this one isn't a tie-in game, which makes everything else you said not relevant in this context."

Warner Bros just happening to publish a Mad Max game four months after they release the first Mad Max movie in 30 years? And they just happen to have major visual similarities?  But sure. Since there's no proof either way, let's say I agree it's not a tie-in as such, since people apparently have an issue with the way I use that word. Let's just call it a licensed game. Which it is. The exact same thing goes for licensed games as for explicit movie tie-ins. A few are good, the vast majority are utter shit."
gamernews,37buf4,strobrod,1 point,Wed May 27 05:18:18 2015 UTC,"Oh there was absolutely coordination between the two studios, no doubt about that, but I hesitate to call something a tie-in unless it's made for the explicit reason of cashing in on something."
gamernews,37buf4,Robot_xj9,0,Wed May 27 15:18:11 2015 UTC,"The movie and game are separate entities altogether, neither was a tie in to the other.  Also, the Riddick games are based on an engine built for the xbox/ps2 gen, and to this day still hold up pretty well. I have to disagree with you that they don't look amazing."
gamernews,37buf4,Veritasgear,2,Tue May 26 18:20:37 2015 UTC,"The movie and game are separate entities altogether, neither was a tie in to the other.

Here, I'll even break it down for you, so you can tell me what exactly you feel I'm ignorant about: 1. The game is a tie-in to a movie franchise. First Mad Max movie was only released like 45 years ago, so I understand if you somehow missed this. 2. Games that are tie-ins to movies are, as a rule (though not always), garbage.

gamernews,37bz8t,DTfan82,8,Tue May 26 20:06:26 2015 UTC,"If by ""causing the illumination"" you meant what is causing the pulse that gives vision, that is actually a very simple answer: it's a white cane (the stick blind people use when walking). The main character gives a tap with the stick and then ""sees"". It's not at all how it really works, but you can think Daredevil style of ""seeing"""

gamernews,37bz8t,Helter-Skeletor,2,Tue May 26 23:24:44 2015 UTC,A door creaking is not a very loud sound to be fair. & I figure they want opening doors to give you a bit of dread before you hit your cane on the ground to see what is in the room in front of you.

gamernews,37bz8t,gamerqc,-9,Tue May 26 18:52:40 2015 UTC,Not exciting at all. To me this looks like the Call of Duty of horror games. The main character desperately needs to shut up and the amount of scripted events was laughable. I didn't even feel the tension because everything was too predictable. To me it looks like the devs played P.T. and tried to make something less believable to ride on that hype now that Silent Hills has been cancelled. Unfortunately I don't see myself playing that game.

It sounds crazy stupid but that's kind of how the Ace Attorney games work, so they'll pull it off.  From the trailer it looks like the art's real similar to Dual Destinies.

gamernews,375oq4,ScarboroughFairgoer,5,Mon May 25 15:09:36 2015 UTC,"I actually enjoyed Lords of the Fallen but unlike the Souls series it's so clearly inspired from it's not really worth a repeat playthrough.  They have still failed to fix major performance issues (crashes, stuttering, etc) and frankly, I don't know why I'd support them in a second one because of this.  I thought the game had merit. It was by no means a standard setter or revolutionary but it had some features I was fond of (like the attack combos). Mostly, I defend it as an attempt that Westerners can try making a Souls game, too.  I found it stylish but not memorable, but at least an inspiration for people who want see more games like Dark Souls. I see the Souls series as something that should spur a genre and would love to see more games like it, Lords of the Fallen, whilst flawed, was a start to that."
gamernews,375oq4,MrTastix,14,Mon May 25 11:55:55 2015 UTC,Lords of the Fallen is most remembered for its gameplay and level design similar to the Souls series.   And not coming close to being as good.   I would love the Souls series to rip off the one good idea they had though. The bosses all had equipment you could get if you beat them a certain way. It's a great way to add optional challenge.
gamernews,375oq4,Fat_Pony,9,Mon May 25 03:35:16 2015 UTC,"I've never played Lords, but Souls did have certain equipment you could get from some bosses by doing things like cutting off their tails. A little more would have been nice though."

gamernews,375oq4,JamesofN,8,Mon May 25 07:40:28 2015 UTC,Guess I'm pretty alone liking the game. I played through it in about 12 hours and was entertained. Maybe it helped that I didn't encountered any game breaking bugs. I never played the DLC though since I read that it isn't really long and not worth the price. But I don't get all the hate it is getting here. Some people seem to be a bit elitist regarding the souls games disregarding the Dark Souls 2 was far away from being as good as the first one.
gamernews,375oq4,envirosani,1 point,Mon May 25 09:06:23 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed the game. Still have to complete it actually.

LOTF was very entertaining to play and I got tons of satisfaction out of it, myself. Should it be considered for goty? No, not by any means. But it was good. Level design and combat fluidity paled in comparison to souls games, but it was enjoyable in a different way. It definitely doesn't deserve the shitting on some people in this thread are giving it, who I'm willing to bet never touched the game in the first place."
gamernews,375oq4,KOWguy,3,Mon May 25 13:59:16 2015 UTC,"I doubt it would be called GOTY edition, but probably something like Ultimate or Enhanced edition. GOTY is just a blanket term for games that get re-released with all it's DLC and what not."
gamernews,375oq4,EVILSUPERMUTANT,-1,Mon May 25 17:02:55 2015 UTC,Hating a game without playing it is bad.  Hating people and calling them miserable and mean without knowing them is totally okay.  Got it.
gamernews,375oq4,renosaho,6,Tue May 26 07:53:33 2015 UTC,"I'll defend this game. It would not be worth the full price tag but at like $10 or $20 it is pretty reasonable, so wait til the summer or Holiday steam sale. It is basically Dark Souls but with weaker level design, but it does actually give you a direction to go. It is a fun game if you like DS and are out of things to play."
gamernews,375oq4,megatom0,7,Tue May 26 13:59:03 2015 UTC,If you liked dark souls but always wished it took an extra 8 seconds to swing your weapon
gamernews,375oq4,dietmoxie,11,Tue May 26 18:26:43 2015 UTC,"Considering the popularity of the Zweihander, I don't think many Souls players care how long it takes to swing the weapon."
gamernews,375oq4,enduser666,2,Mon May 25 04:04:29 2015 UTC,"I've played ultra great swords in souls and between the time difference it takes you vs them to attack in in LotF, the heat seeking attacks of enemies who can spin 180 degrees multiple times during the same attack string, and the almost non existent invul window while you throw your fat idiot body around during rolls, I have to say, fuck that game."
gamernews,375oq4,dietmoxie,0,Mon May 25 04:22:53 2015 UTC,Heatseeking enemies? Sounds like Dark Souls 2

gamernews,375oq4,goochlordbrah,1 point,Mon May 25 11:25:31 2015 UTC,"Really? To me it felt like Dark Souls light I guess, or even like a lengthy Dark Souls mod. Granted that isn't glowing praise for a full priced game but I think $10 it is worth a shot. I enjoyed it, but I could see if you found it underwhelming. I feel that ""horrendous"" is a bit too strong of a term for it.  Granted I played it recently after it has been significantly patched. I never had any issues crashing or otherwise. I would only label a game horrendous if it just outright didn't work or had completely broken mechanics."

gamernews,375oq4,Nushens,-5,Mon May 25 20:43:14 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls  Good Level Design   Yeah, 50% of Dark Souls is ok. The rest is just rushed and ugly. I love Dark Souls but you're just talking out of your ass."
gamernews,375oq4,w4rmill,1 point,Mon May 25 04:26:05 2015 UTC,By level design I meant more of the layout of the game and how you are kind of guided through it. DS gives subtle direction and allows for exploration. Lords of the Fallen doesn't have that openess that DS has. Yes DS has problems with like Blight Town and has at times ugly decor but overall it is interesting the way everything kind of connects to itself while still feeling like a more typical level design of a video game.
gamernews,375oq4,megatom0,2,Mon May 25 06:12:49 2015 UTC,"I agree if that's the case. I really like the way every area is somehow connected.

gamernews,375oq4,filthy_sandwich,2,Mon May 25 03:49:44 2015 UTC,It's actually a decent game. I got it on pc and I didn't encounter any bugs. Sure it doesn't have souls level design. But the combat isn't as slow as everyone makes it out to be especially with a skill build its easier and not as well designed but if you like souls games and monster hunter it should at least entertain you for a few hours.
gamernews,375oq4,tacoman3725,2,Mon May 25 04:50:24 2015 UTC,This game wasn't even in the top 30. This broken mess probably wasn't the top game the week it was released. Game of the Day edition maybe.

It sounds like they have designed it to be fun first and foremost and what I loved most about jc2 was the exploration of it. Finding secret islands with lost Japanese soldiers, finding a secret strip club in the sky. It all sounds like fun."

gamernews,36v35x,smpx,8,Fri May 22 14:36:16 2015 UTC,Same but I usually ended up going grand theft auto on someone and ended up in a police chace.

gamernews,36v35x,pzrapnbeast,2,Fri May 22 18:41:23 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. Its a big map and if you arent looking for any interesting places (or in my case an airport) I could see how one might glance over it without a second thought
gamernews,36v35x,link5057,3,Fri May 22 19:52:33 2015 UTC,There was a story?  I remember 2 missions and then months of exploring the island and blowing stuff up.

gamernews,36v35x,Rehd,1 point,Fri May 22 21:28:50 2015 UTC,In a normal playthrough the game requires you to explore and create chaos between story missions.   It would have been a really boring game if the exploring and creating chaos wasn't any fun.

gamernews,36v35x,Skrapion,3,Fri May 22 19:16:35 2015 UTC,"Oh defniitely.   There are games that take themselves too seriously, or focuses less on ""fuck it just have fun"" and more on ""this is an artistic story meant to make you question your emotions."" like The Last Of Us. And then there are games which are based around self-loathing. Dark Souls is a ""fuck you and fuck your fun"" kind of game.   Most games obviously are meant to entertain and amuse, but there are definitely games that are fun first and foremost, and make the narrative a secondary importance-- Saints Row is another series that has been doing this well."

gamernews,36v35x,Keboose,8,Fri May 22 14:50:52 2015 UTC,Oblivion and Skyrim are always touted for their huge worlds.  Witcher 3's size was compared to Skyrim.  Zelda Wii U as well in speculation.
gamernews,36v35x,Baryn,9,Fri May 22 17:51:25 2015 UTC,Since you mentioned the new Zelda I wanted to say Witcher 3 feels like what I expect the new Zelda to play like. Riding on a horse in open world and killing monsters.
gamernews,36v35x,pzrapnbeast,2,Fri May 22 18:42:24 2015 UTC,This is exactly the same thing it came to my mind the first three seconds I saw a Witcher 3 gameplay.
gamernews,36v35x,metatronsaint,2,Fri May 22 19:32:52 2015 UTC,Which is funny because when Oblivion came out everyone hated how much smaller it was than Morrowind.

gamernews,36v35x,Conjugal_Burns,4,Sat May 23 02:05:43 2015 UTC,That is why people use Oblivion and/or Skyrim as a litmus test of open world size.
gamernews,36v35x,Baryn,1 point,Sat May 23 02:28:13 2015 UTC,"It's funny to take Skyrim as a comparison point. Sure it's an open world game a lot of people played, but probably 99% of those people fast traveled 99% of the time, making the comparison point hazy at best.   I guess it's ideal for impressing though, people think Skyrim is really big even though it isn't, so you can just say that this game is X times larger which is hardly an achievement, and people will be blown away because they think it is."
gamernews,36v35x,kissapuu,5,Sat May 23 07:20:27 2015 UTC,What about just cause 2?  Edit: It's the same size.

While there were lots of places to go in Just Cause 2, there really wasn't that much to do. Everything felt empty. There was no real variation from town to town.

(not to everyone though) I just hope Just cause 3 will deliver lots of NEW stuff to get us in awe. Cause that's what Just cause 2 did to succeed. If it's too similar it will fail. I don't think it's the kind of game that should stick to past formulas. They should put in lots and lots of crazy cool shit and make their cheesy missions over the top mind blowing."

So hopefully their will be tons of new things to discover.  Just cause 2 was pretty much the epitome of emergent gameplay. The funniest things in that game were things the devs  never imagined anyone doing."

I consider ""sandbox"" a misnomer in the games industry; lots of people use it for games that I can explore for days but do nothing but.  I believe this why we coined the term ""open world"". Grand Theft Auto was long considered ""sandbox"" but honestly, other than a few mini-games and partying with hookers there isn't much to do in it. You explore, you kill things, and it's fantastic at that but there's no sand to make my castle with.  Though I'm probably just drawing semantics here. Just Cause 3 could be a great ""sandbox"" title but there has to be more to do or at least more ways to do it. JC2's world was fantastic but spending time in the desert or on the Mile High Club was the same as spending it anywhere else."

It's a sandbox with freedom to do whatever you want (at a specific level). I can't do absolutely anything I want in EVE can I? No I can't, there's more to do, but there's not a barrier level entry for sandbox games with, ""You need to be able to do X amount of things to be a sandbox.""

gamernews,36v35x,CancerousJedi,3,Sat May 23 09:58:12 2015 UTC,"Please point me to any evidence that says a sandbox needs things you've included or contradicts what I've said.   FYI, I've seen claims of games like Half-Life being sandbox titles. However, that isn't the point. Please provide evidence that says anything otherwise.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_game#S   A Sandbox game is a game that the player has the ability to alter their environment in some substantial matter, hence the term sandbox. The term sandbox is in reference to a child's Sandbox in which you can alter the landscape and build shapes. Not to be confused with the term open-world, where the player may roam openly through the world, without artificial gimmicks to direct a set path. The story driven aspect has no effect on whether a game is sandbox or not, but can sway if a game is open-world.  Many sandbox games are open world, as they usually go hand in hand and compliment each other well, examples would be Minecraft, or Trove. Examples of games that are sandbox but not open world would be along the lines of Robocraft. Example of games that are open-world but not a sandbox would be, Cubeworld, or Ultima I: The First Age of Darkness."

Climbing to the top of the bridge structure in first person was one of those few moments where feel a hint of acrophobia just sitting on your couch. Sadly assassins creed never did that for me.

gamernews,36moip,Scrutinizer,1 point,Fri May 22 15:18:58 2015 UTC,"Well they would have to. No third party devs really have any motivation to develop for this thing that most people aren't going to buy.   I don't care if you like the PS4 or not, it's obvious that project morpheus is a half-assed attempt to cash in on VR's popularity, just like playstation move was a half-assed attempt to cash in on motion controls.  It'll have 1 or 2 great games, a handful of 'good' ones and the rest will be shovelware.  All that being said, it makes sense for them to create their own first party studio to make games for it, becuase no other devs have any interest. It will be an interesting ride, but in the end I think Morpheus will end up just like the kinect, the playstation move, etc. etc. A forgotten peripheral trying to do something that another platform does 100x better, and that never got enough support to be worth buying.   Sorry to be so cynical, but I find it very interesting how console makers react to trends."
gamernews,36moip,Robot_xj9,4,Tue May 26 16:47:45 2015 UTC,I think you're missing the point.  A brand new studio means games exclusively developed for Project Morpheus.  They can lower polygon counts and visual fidelity to reach the 90 fps target.  This is exactly what's needed to make PM viable.

gamernews,365rbx,whitefalconiv,9,Sat May 16 15:34:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I loved AMD back during Intel's Netburst days. My Barton 2500+ at 2.4ghz and my x2 4600+ were beasts.

gamernews,365rbx,bravesirkiwi,5,Sat May 16 15:45:48 2015 UTC,"The advances in speed do seem to have slown, but I think it's because there's a huge focus on power consumption now. That seems to be the main pitch for new CPUs is better efficiency. They have advanced speeds with better hyperthreading and bigger buses and other things that dont show in the simple GHz number, but I think demand for faster computers has dropped significantly since most people are content with the power they have now. Computers do everything in the business world as quick as is needed these days, except maybe pathfinding and stock prediction. For video editing and 3d rendering and games though there is always demand for higher power and speed, which makes it sad that there is this lull.

gamernews,365rbx,Gazareth,1 point,Sat May 16 22:12:17 2015 UTC,"It's a little worrying, to be honest. For Witcher 3 the minimum specs are i5 2500k/Phenom II X4 940, whilst recommended specs are i7 3770/FX-8350. I'm of the understanding that i7 3770 is more powerful than the i5 4590, and therefore Oculus is saying an FX-8350 can't hold up against a weaker chip than CDPR are saying it can."
gamernews,365rbx,Blotto_80,6,Sat May 16 15:41:52 2015 UTC,"Core for core for most games the 3770 and the 4590 should be very similar performing (3770 has 100mhz edge but 4590 is newer), the 8350 can't hang with either of them unless the app is perfectly multithreaded and can take full advantage of all 8 cores. Even then the hyperthreading in the 3770 will close the gap.    The Phenom II shouldn't even be in this discussion as it is more of a Core2Quad competitor.   The 2500k can be almost as fast as the Ivy/Haswell equivalents."
gamernews,365rbx,luciferin,0,Sat May 16 15:53:26 2015 UTC,"the 8350 can't hang with either of them unless the app is perfectly multithreaded and can take full advantage of all 8 cores   Most games nowadays are beginning to do this, and I would argue that the Oculus should be optimised for as many cores as possible, since many-cores seems to be the way things are going with CPUs.   The Phenom II shouldn't even be in this discussion as it is more of a Core2Quad competitor.    Why not? If CDPR say it can be used to run their 2015 game, why can't it be used for the Oculus?   The 2500k can be almost as fast as the Ivy/Haswell equivalents.    Again, CDPR are saying the Phenom II is comparable with the 2500k in their game why are you saying otherwise? Isn't the Oculus a gaming peripheral?"
gamernews,365rbx,Gazareth,3,Sat May 16 15:56:53 2015 UTC,"It's most likely a case of ""Minimum Requirements"".  These are generally not enough to play the game well, just start the game.    In general, games aren't so much as reliant on the CPU as they are the GPU, so a weaker CPU will have less effect on the play-ability of a game than a weaker GPU would.   It appears that for their minimum specification they just decided that they'd make the cut off a 2010/2011 quad core when in reality the Intel minimum is faster than the AMD recommended.   For the Oculus, there is more going on than just rendering/playing the game. There needs to be motion tracking and perspective tracking for both video and audio output among other things I'm probably missing. These need CPU cycles on top of the already running game.  It would appear that Oculus took a more realistic approach to requirments and decided that current AMD CPUs just didn't cut it."
gamernews,365rbx,jaxxer,2,Sat May 16 16:50:11 2015 UTC,"It's most likely a case of ""Minimum Requirements"". These are generally not enough to play the game well, just start the game.   There's also the requirement with the Rift that the head tracking and frame rate be incredibly steady and reliable.  With games on a traditional monitor, you can absorb a 20fps drop in certain areas, or some stuttering when there's intense graphics.  If that happens on an HMD, you're suddenly making your user physically ill and risking them never wanting to use your device again.  I imagine that has a lot to do with their recommendations."

The Phenom II came out in 2009, not 2010/11. The FX-8120 actually came out in 2011, and is substantially more powerful so I don't think they did just take a time-frame, or they would've used that one.   For the Oculus, there is more going on than just rendering/playing the game. There needs to be motion tracking and perspective tracking for both video and audio output among other things I'm probably missing.    3D-Camera-based audio already exists in current games. As for the movement, all you're doing is adding another axis when compared with an analogue stick. The Wii Motion Plus was capable of 1:1 tracking on all 3 axes of both rotation and location when it came out in 2009. It ran on the Wii's CPU which was probably vastly inferior to the Phenom II X4 940, since the Wii came out in 2006.  Honestly you're coming off as very biased and unnecessarily dismissive of AMD's CPUs. Where have you gotten your information from? You know that the FX-8350 and 9590 can hold their own in practically every game nowadays, right?"

The highest end AMD was nearly $400 cheaper than the highest end Intel, and the lowest end AMD was still about $40 cheaper than the equivalent Intel. I got the prices from Amazon.  So I'm not sure if you were bashing AMD or if you were in favor of it, but the link you posted seems to be showing AMD in favor here."

Assuming that console hardware is exploited in roughly the same way as PC hardware (which is more and more the case, now that we have almost full-blown OS on these things), we have on the PS4 (from wikipedia):   two quad-core (=8 cores) at 1.6GHz, with 32kB of L1 cache and 2MB L2 per module GPU said to go to 1.84 Teraflops, have 1152 shader cores, and special stuff that make highly paralellized operations and central memory access faster. 8GB of RAM   Recommended Rift stuff:   The i5-4590 have less L2 cache, but litteraly blow away the frequency, at 3.3GHz. GTX 970: 3.2 tflops, 1664 cores 8GB+ of RAM   Sooooooo nope. Raw graphical processing power is way out of the PS4 capabilities. Memory might be an issue, and while CPU is arithmetically acceptable (8 cores at 1.6GHz versus the recommended 4 cores at 3.3GHz), sadly processing power doesn't work this way.  (all this is assuming wikipedia info are correct, and also ignore the fact that PS4 software support from the Occulus Rift isn't even on the horizon of possibilities right now)  And now, the mandatory ""pschh console"" stingy remark: when the PS4 got out, my already old computer had better spec. Stop thinking that these ""next gen"" doodles are actually powerful."

gamernews,365rbx,jacabo,1 point,Sat May 16 19:39:53 2015 UTC,"Morpheus will almost certainly only work with games exclusively designed for it. In other words, games that might be optimized for the PC and the Occulus might not work with Morpheus and the PS4 port, or at least, won't look nearly as nice."
gamernews,365rbx,Squishumz,9,Sun May 17 04:14:33 2015 UTC,"These specs are kind of meaningless. It's like asking ""what are the recommended specs for playing games?"" Sure, you can give a general idea, but there are hundreds of indie games that take almost no processing power, and AAA titles that bring it to its knees. On top of that, games require more power each year, so I don't know why they're saying the specs won't change. The '~3x more processing power required' part is better, if you're looking for the takeaway."
gamernews,365rbx,eifersucht12a,18,Sat May 16 14:55:52 2015 UTC,our recommended hardware specification is designed to help developers tackle these challenges and ship great content to all Rift users.   They are telling developers to make games playable on this hardware. If a developer makes a game that can't run on this hardware they probably won't be able to put an oculus seal on their packaging/advertising material.
gamernews,365rbx,jacabo,2,Sat May 16 18:25:17 2015 UTC,Good point. Still worth pointing out that users with less-than-recommended PCs aren't being completely shut out.
gamernews,365rbx,eifersucht12a,-5,Sat May 16 18:49:01 2015 UTC,It's a good thing oculus will come and go within a year of I'd be worried that that would mean dumbed down games for its sake.

The reason Red Orchestra did well is because it started as a free mod, and had a higher level of attention to detail put into it's gunplay than the constant WW2 arcade games. That's pretty much it.  The world really doesn't need a bunch of WW2 games all of the sudden. The craze will start again in the next year or two because developers of AAA games are vapid and lack any sort of creative license, so you really don't have anything to worry about. I enjoyed the tiny break from 8 million games about stalingrad and normandy, though.  But for real, 'historical accuracy' is boring as fuck. There are countless 'historically accurate' war games being shit out in all sorts of settings, each trying to ride the coat-tails of some blockbuster flavor of the month of it's time period. Historical accuracy is pretty much a giant sign saying 'You know exactly what to expect from this game. Expect no creativity, no diversity, and nothing remotely surprising. Give us money so we can rush out a sequel in a year that is just a minor reskin'."

Or similar. You are stating that because there were loads of ww2 games, that means there were no good ones. Its similar.   Red Orchestra was never that original? WHAT EXACTLY WOULD YOU REQUIRE FOR A WW2 GAME TO BE ORIGINAL? From what you say it would need aliens and for the world to be purple. Red Orchestra was the only game to ever feature the eastern front!! Thats massively original. It also had the most realistic gun play of any of the ww2 games ever released.   And i personally love historical accuracy and realism in gaming, so i cant get enough of ww2 games (When done well, which literally not one has ever done other than RO/RO2 imo) and decent modern warfare games like arma and project reality mod, (there are few others).  But i have to ask, what do you want from games then? It seems you will always be asking for more even if a game is awesome......"

Kind of the opposite, really. WW2 games were almost always shit. People just have selective memory and only talk about the tiny handful of good ones like Brothers in Arms and Company of Heroes.   Red Orchestra was never that original? WHAT EXACTLY WOULD YOU REQUIRE FOR A WW2 GAME TO BE ORIGINAL?   There are tons of other nations, battles, and general themes to be explored other than ""Here Russians. Here Germans. Smash together in Stalingrad and Kursk"". Ironically, Infinity Ward was one of the only wons to actually try this with certain parts of Finest Hour on the PS2. There's nothing interesting about playing the same factions in the same battles with the same equipment and the same gameplay over and over. That's why WW2 games died off.   And i personally love historical accuracy and realism in gaming, so i cant get enough of ww2 games (When done well, which literally not one has ever done other than RO/RO2 imo)   Graviteam Tactics, Men of War, Red Orchestra, Iron Front, Project Reality, I44, IL-2 Sturmovik, War Thunder, Silent Hunter, Microsoft Combat Simulator, DCS, Sniper Elite(Well, the original, anyway), Commandos, Hearts of Iron. These are just the ones I could immediatly think of off the top of my head without having to even look. And with the exception of a couple of those, all of them have come out within the last 2-3 years/released a sequel within that timeframe. And this is during the 'lull' of the WW2 fanaticism.

And what other game depicted the Eastern Front in a shooter/fps style? The reason there are not games from other fronts is because noone from their countries/regions are making games and they dont sell. Look at how badly RO2 has sold compared with other ww2 games to illustrate my point, given it is one of the best ww2 games out there (The best imo).   The Rising Storm expansion may be yet another Americans in ww2, but its one of the only games, once again, to depict the Pacific front, i think Medal of Honor: Pacific was the only other)  I agree there should be more games that have other fronts, Forgotten Hope for BF2 was fantastic for that reason, one of the few games to have the British in WW2, most imply that they never fought a single day during ww2 and America saved the world :D.  And yes i love almost all those games but we are talking about shooters, of which there is no choice in either genre (modern or WW2)."

gamernews,363m26,Scyths,2,Sat May 16 15:49:39 2015 UTC,It seems the general consensus is that Hardline should have pretty much been a Battlefield 4 addon.   But they released it as a new game. This is essentially a double whammy because Battlefield 4 was broke as shit upon release and it seems Hardline is somewhat following suit.  Battlefield 4 is now refined and fixed so you get a complete game as opposed to a core (no dlc yet) game in its infancy.  And probably the most major reason people are straying from Hardline is that they wanted Battle Fields. They wanted war. They did not want Law enforcement. You don’t scale down Battlefield.

I enjoy the infantry only with explosives banned before hardline anyway, I'd still like it if they had a mode that made guns a little harder to aim and have longer reloads, but not overdo it like arma or something, and dont say hardcore because that is stupid-mode, but I do like that it doesn't have doritos, but weapon damage models totally screws up that mode"

The AT-AT could be destroyed, but your teammates can run interference and cover you until you get close enough to the base. So badass. This is kind of how Robocraft works with the Megabots."
gamernews,3615b0,KungFuHamster,4,Fri May 15 15:45:29 2015 UTC,"Well this reminds me of how BF2142 worked. Each side had a Titan - carrier like craft, that the commander could slowly direct to area on battlefield. This Titan would provide supplies and support with gun batteries. Guys on the floor would cap flags to get a close by missile silo to fire at the enemy Titan, slowly bringing down its shields and eventually hull. The Titans could also be taken down from within once the shields are down. With BF4's naval strike there were talks at one point to bring this game mode in with carriers. You can argue that they did, but I'm not seeing it.  They could probably end up doing this with the AT-AT as the carrier. But like others have said, we wanted to pilot the AT-AT. I mean COME ON, its 2015 already!  They could drop the graphics level in favor of giving us these mechanics if resources were an issue. And there HAS to be space battles otherwise its not Battlefront. If past iterations could do it (and they did) they can bloody well do it now - and its their duty to."
gamernews,3615b0,Demented_ZA,3,Fri May 15 21:14:59 2015 UTC,"The mode in bf4 is called carrier assault, and while it's similar to Titan, it's not as fun Imo.  Still entertaining"
gamernews,3615b0,ittleoff,14,Sun May 17 01:25:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly? Not me. And I'm surprised that among all the reasonable criticisms of the new Battlefront, this got as much traction as it did. Those things are ridiculously slow and impractical. In Battlefront 2, once the novelty of piloting one wore off after about 5 minutes, they didn't offer any compelling gameplay whatsoever. And I can't see how they could change that in the reboot without fundamentally altering what the AT-AT was designed to be: a lumbering Goliath existing solely to be taken down by a nimble David.  edit: Look, I know the reddiquette expectation of not using the downvote button as a a sign of disagreement is a pipedream. Heck, I do it too sometimes. But could you please also leave a short reply as to why you disagree? I didn't think my 2 cents on the issue were that unreasonable :(    I mean adding playable AT-AT's would obviously take development time and resources, resources that could otherwise be spent elsewhere. If I'm in the minority on this and most people truly want to pilot AT-AT longterm, then those costs are worth it. I just can't help but wonder if people aren't more in love with the idea of playable AT-ATs than the reality of it."

In reality it might be as fun as the stationary AA in BF3, but design was more to blame and its the same here - it will depend on what they do with it. Yes it is another development time suck, but they can steal time from some other aspect which no one actually cares about (I'm sure there's a few, like wasting man hours on an early start on Battlefront Hardline...). The AT-AT could be successful if playable. They could give it sensory systems to help with support, it already has formidable firepower and lets not forget that this is a game that's supposed to be fun for all, so DICE'll probably balance the shit out of it so that a single ninja would be as effective taking it down as trying to kill an elephant by throwing sponges at it. If they put thier heads to it, it could be awesome, but my hopes aren't high since they mentioned we wont have space battles. I mean WTH!?"

We need articles written about what has happened here.  This is what it looks like when a bar has been set.  Not charging for the DLC is one thing, but from what I've heard about the size of Witcher 3, if EA had released this game it would be 1/4 the size at release and already have 2 years of paid for DLC in waiting.  CDPR gave us exactly what we've been wanting for years.  I have a few friends that aren't into RPG's so I might buy them copies just to pad the sales even further."

CDPRojectRed says it'll incorporate first timers easily into the story, but there's so much content in the whole witcher saga that there's no way you can even become close to realizing the full story unless you've read all the books and played all the games."

gamernews,36386m,akin4bacon,2,Fri May 15 22:42:24 2015 UTC,"There was probably technical, pracitcal and cost limitations. I am sure the Devs wanted to implement co-op but they couldn't figure a way to do so that made sense and/or worked.   This new system seems pretty awesome and also allows for some badass duel takedowns. To do that with an AI is easy, to do that with a human is much harder. It probably just didn't work and they did not want to have the only co-op feature to be just two people fighting 20 or so baddies."
gamernews,35zb8r,Torvusil,4,Thu May 14 19:47:36 2015 UTC,"That Hanzo stealing medic health at 3:15 tho.  Honestly, the game looks great.  It looks like there will be less overall variety of gameplay than TF2, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, especially for competitive play.  The flow was good, balance looked decent already, there was a similar feeling of pattern within the chaos that's one of TF2's greatest feats, all abilities that I saw had frequent usefulness, and they combined well with other characters (e.g. her grapple-to-teammate ability worked well in coordination with other characters).  I'm excited to see what emergent gameplay is discovered once it's out to the public.    --editing to say that if I do have a concern, it's pacing.  Previous videos seemed kind of slow to me.  This one was better, but that might have just been the effect of a more interesting map that bottlenecked/focused combat more.  We'll have to see where it ends up."
gamernews,35zb8r,Kinklebots,1 point,Fri May 15 15:42:54 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one not thrilled about this game? It seems sort of lack luster. These ultimate abilities seem like a chaotic mess. The variety of game play looks kinda of bland, like a dumbed down TF2, but with more vertical movement. On top of this most of the abilities seem to have significant overreaching spell effects that mask the game play by quite a bit.  I know Blizzard has a history of taking a genre and making it more accessible or polished in their own iteration, which I like, but this just seems off putting."
gamernews,35zb8r,omniblue,-1,Fri May 15 15:52:51 2015 UTC,"The ultimate abilities look kinda neat, but other than that I see zero reason to switch to this if you already play TF2."
gamernews,35zb8r,Scodo,3,Thu May 14 20:16:39 2015 UTC,"So other than the differences you can't see why anyone would play this? Same reason people play Heroes of the Storm, or LoL, or Dota2. For the differences."
gamernews,35zb8r,monkeyjay,4,Fri May 15 03:37:39 2015 UTC,I think there's significantly more classes (heroes) and it looks like they can do a lot of different things.
gamernews,35zb8r,lalobzre,2,Fri May 15 03:53:48 2015 UTC,I like the theme and art direction better. That's essentially the same reason someone would play Halo over Killzone or Battlefield.

I'd really like to see the ""Rise"" shout, and the idea that it's based off slow but inescapable antagonists from horror movies just sounds amazing.  How do you feel about the Chronomancer and Dragonslayer?"
gamernews,35xy66,TheCrimsonGlass,3,Thu May 14 20:59:57 2015 UTC,"They look cool. I bet their actual abilities will be less impressive to use than they look, though. GW2 is all about skills that are very short-lived, or have only marginal impact, or require constant upkeep to make relevant. It just bugs me that there are so few game-changing moves you can make that actually feel game changing. For a while, a super powerful ability was that you could teleport a short distance away in the middle of a skill channel. It was great, but hardly the most exciting thing to use. To compare in a PvE sense, the highest DPS for almost every class is to unload a big skill or two, then auto-attack."
gamernews,35xy66,ANewMachine615,2,Thu May 14 21:04:33 2015 UTC,"True, but I would honestly be pretty unhappy if the elite specialization made your character significantly more powerful. If it did, then there wouldn't be any point in using any of the other specializations, and it would really railroad the class. For that reason, I'm glad they don't seem game-changing."

The top couple reviews actually detail out what the differences are, where it's better, and maybe even where it might be worse.

I don't know what you mean by ""alpha"" but in my long experience as a gamer, it's almost always the case that whatever beta testers see is what the public will also see.  I'm not aware of any one time when the game magically improved between the time beta testers saw it last, and the first customers.  Even day 1 patches rarely fix every important problem.  It usually takes a series of patches to bring the game to a polished state, assuming it had a rough start.  (I've known game+company pairs that couldn't be brought up to snuff even after 6 months of patching.  I can think of a game that remained broken pretty much forever, even after countless patches.)  Some game companies release solid code though (at least sometimes).  But those that don't, well, beta testing doesn't help all that much, for them it's a tough slog to get to a polished state.  It's one thing to run a beta test and another thing to actually pay attention to it."

gamernews,35ubzv,Baryn,10,Wed May 13 19:30:44 2015 UTC,It's a huge shame that so many people dismiss it out of hand because it was initially a huge disappointment to a lot of Chrono Trigger fans when it is without a doubt one of the best RPGs of the PSX era. It still has imo the best soundtrack of any of square's games.
gamernews,35ubzv,chobi83,7,Wed May 13 20:16:08 2015 UTC,"It also has, IMO, the best story of any Square title save Xenogears.  Trigger was a rather straightforward adventure, even if it was an amazing one. Cross surprised me with how complex, strange, and dark it was by comparison."

Evaluating as a general gamer, however, it is still the deepest simulation within its subgenre(s) ever made, possibly only to be surpassed by MGSV. On top of that, it might still be the industry high water mark for cinematic cutscene storytelling.  If we ding MGS4 for its worst elements–a sloppy plot and a score marred by legal troubles–it remains at least a 9, IMHO."

It wasn't until later, with the popularization of the internet and hating what is popular, that it got a negative reputation.  Same as Final Fantasy VIII which had high scores upon release, but grew to be hated online.  All that said however, I think reviews and scores are a joke.  Its basically a handful of people telling millions of others what games to play.  And, as it has been proven, many reviews are based on hype and money, not actual quality."

gamernews,35ubzv,Colorfag,9,Wed May 13 17:35:26 2015 UTC,I'm surprised GTA V didn't make it on that list.
gamernews,35ubzv,Anzai,19,Wed May 13 18:57:41 2015 UTC,General consensus was that GTA IV was overrated so reviewers had that criticism of their work in n mind when it came time to award V with a score.  Similarly if a game got underrated then the reviewer is likely to inflate the sequels score even if it's just more along the same lines of the first game.
gamernews,35ubzv,Colorfag,12,Wed May 13 19:13:55 2015 UTC,"IV got a lot of perfect scores too. I thought that was odd, considering the game took a step back with regards to what the player could do compared to San Andreas."
gamernews,35ubzv,TheCoachMcGuirk,17,Wed May 13 19:27:13 2015 UTC,"More to do doesn't necessarily mean better game. Far Cry 4 has a hell of a lot to do, but it's all mainly tedious as hell. Similarly, San Andreas had a lot to do but much of it sucked. Going to the gym for example was something extra to do that made the game worse,"
gamernews,35ubzv,fawker,6,Wed May 13 19:42:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but they took away some of the more interesting stuff. Like the rpg type of elements for developing your characters stats, being able to interact with NPCs, the huge amounts of clothing to dress your character in, being able to buy properties - stuff that made it back in GTAV."

gamernews,35ubzv,Diplocephalus,2,Wed May 13 20:30:07 2015 UTC,"I think the story and presentation had more to do with its acclaim. At the time all of the cinematic stuff was genuinely new and cool, and just trying to tackle ""deep"" themes tends to get you brownie points from game reviewers even if what you're doing isn't necessarily novel or well executed (American Dream sux amirite guyz)."
gamernews,35ubzv,Colorfag,2,Thu May 14 01:25:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know if ""new"" is the right word. It was something rarely done then, and rarely done now. It certainly wasn't the first time someone tried to make a ""serious"" game."

gamernews,35ubzv,Lobotomist,1 point,Thu May 14 01:29:53 2015 UTC,"General consensus of whom to be exact and do you have a source supporting any of that? I can't even think of another series that this ""rule"" applies to.   GTA IV was the absolute shit when it released. Completely raised the bar for open-world games, and IMO wasn't topped in the genre until GTA V. It was the fastest selling piece of media ever released, and that was before COD broke the record every year and made it meaningless. It was on talk shows all summer. I remember because a friend who hated the series would send me links wondering why it was still so popular months after it released. Think The Witcher 3 getting a 10 from GameSpot is a big deal? GTA IV got the first 10 from IGN since Soul Calibur came out in 1999. GTA V didn't get perfect scores because while it outdid GTA IV across the board, it wasn't nearly as groundbreaking."
gamernews,35ubzv,Overlord1317,3,Wed May 13 21:42:03 2015 UTC,"General consensus of whom to be exact and do you have a source supporting any of that?

I was one of the ones who considered it the best GTA ever (until V came along) with 100+ hours on my PS3 and then 500 hours played on my PC version.  Never the less the consensus among actual gamers was that IV was a step away from the crazy antics that had come to define the series with many lamenting the more serious approach of the game when compared to Vice City or San Andreas.  As a result of this the critics were harsher on GTA V when it came along because they knew that they had overrated IV and did not want to be seen as buying into the hype train all over again. Hence why GTA V arguably a better game than IV received less ""perfect"" scores from critics who had previously jumped and given IV a ""perfect"" score.  You seem to think i am shitting on GTA for some reason, stop being so defensive. IV was overrated even if i personally loved it."

Personally, I never look at Metacritic user review scores because I feel they are skewed by people who strongly dislike the game and are more likely to write a review over your average player. There's also only 10,000 user reviews across all 5 platforms I linked.    As a result of this the critics were harsher on GTA V when it came along because they knew that they had overrated IV and did not want to be seen as buying into the hype train all over again. Hence why GTA V arguably a better game than IV received less ""perfect"" scores from critics who had previously jumped and given IV a ""perfect"" score.   This is the part you need to source. Without any backup this is pure speculation, which is why I called it out. Unless you can provide a source, I see no reason to believe games are ever reviewed this way. I can't even think of another series it would apply to."
gamernews,35ubzv,deuteros,0,Wed May 13 21:20:41 2015 UTC,GTA IV was excellent game. Dont forget that reviewers dont have time machine and can only review the game in context of technology at the time game is reviewed.
gamernews,35ubzv,slickestwood,2,Wed May 13 21:57:28 2015 UTC,What makes GTA IV a bad game was that it was a bad game.    I would say that GTA IV's ridiculous scores utterly obliterated any remaining faith I had in video game media.

gamernews,35ubzv,gameryamen,102,Thu May 14 14:46:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I really care what Gamespot thinks. Their video review of The Witcher 3 was absolutely dreadful.

gamernews,35ubzv,Neo-Calypso,6,Thu May 14 11:06:32 2015 UTC,"Actually, they were talking about on the GB podcast today, that the review and QL are going up friday, and Vinny is the one to be doing it."

Also Vinny somehow having time to play through a 100 hour game when he was just on Danswers saying he has no time to play games at home doesn't seem likely.

gamernews,35ubzv,ChicagoBulls1984,15,Thu May 14 02:20:42 2015 UTC,"Bias would be the reviewer having some sort of tie to the developer (financial, personal, etc). Being a fan of their previous work can't really count as bias, or the word simply loses meaning. Every movie critic who reviewed Godfather 2 had an opinion on Godfather 1 (most likely favorable). Being even a massive fan of the previous work doesn't mean you can't review the current work or all reviewers would be pretty much forced to only review things they disliked."
gamernews,35ubzv,UnDire,6,Thu May 14 22:53:32 2015 UTC,What do you mean by 'bias'? A review is a subjective thing. 'Bias' doesn't really apply in matters of opinion like this.
gamernews,35ubzv,Alpha-Leader,-1,Wed May 13 21:20:13 2015 UTC,"While you are right, the guy being a fan of the world is not really an issue of bias, it should color how much weight you put on his review. However a reviewer can very much be affected by their personal views or bias on a subject. That is why before you trust a review you should at least have a base understanding of the persons views on the matter at hand. This goes for critics for everything.  Movie Critics hate summer action movies. Does that mean they are bad movies? It is their opinion on the matter sure, but that opinion was formed by their personal view or bias of what they think a movie should be. Everyone has a bias, the trick is you need to figure out if for you that bias outweighs the value of their opinion on a matter when it comes to a review.  Bias  a particular tendency, trend, inclination, feeling, or opinion, especially one that is preconceived or unreasoned"
gamernews,35ubzv,ChicagoBulls1984,3,Wed May 13 22:40:33 2015 UTC,"but that opinion was formed by their personal view or bias of what they think a movie should be.    But their entire review is just them saying what they think a movie should be. That's what a review is. It's simply an opinion (admittedly with some objective stuff thrown in to support it). 'Bias' only applies to objective matters, and reviews deal almost entirely with the subjective."

gamernews,35ubzv,InvaderDem,-21,Wed May 13 19:20:30 2015 UTC,I want to see a new IP on the list/that praised.  Every single game on there is a sequel.
gamernews,35ubzv,Boreras,18,Wed May 13 19:30:40 2015 UTC,One reason for that's that good games often get improved upon by the sequels to make them basically flawless for their time. They know what they didn't quite get right the first time.
gamernews,35ubzv,Indoorsman,6,Thu May 14 08:08:27 2015 UTC,"Very few games hit it out of the park on the first go-round. Look at San Andreas compared to GTA3 (for all intents and purposes the start of that series) or Soul Calibur vs Soul Edge, or Assasin's Creed vs Assasin's Creed 2. Mechanics and graphics improve, story line gets tightened, glitches and irritations people had with the original get resolved."
gamernews,35ubzv,DougyAM,1 point,Wed May 13 19:35:44 2015 UTC,"But it is a sequel...   Sort of.  They're hopping genres a bit.  Witcher 3 is a non-linear game, which is a first for the Witcher series."

The pessimistic side of me says that they're deliberately giving a high score to a highly anticipated game to make their advertising clients happy.   I feel that YouTubers would be way more venal than these sites, because there's no oversight and nobody to leak the story. Gamespot is a collection of individuals, and whenever there's such a 'conspiracy' they must all keep it a secret. A single YouTuber on the other hand has it easy. YouTubers also have exclusive deals, or CPM deals, and we've seen before that there are lots of people willing to agree to certain terms without ever informing their public. E.g. Microsoft's Machinima deal:    video creators ""may not say anything negative or disparaging about Machinima, Xbox One, or any of its Games"" and must keep the details of the promotional agreement confidential in order to qualify for payment. In other words, to get the money, video makers have to speak positively (or at least neutrally) about the Xbox One, and they can't say they're being paid to do so."

gamernews,35ubzv,HugoWeaver,5,Wed May 13 20:33:53 2015 UTC,"Technically speaking at this point any site that bucked the trend and gave it a more ""down to earth"" score would gain many more hits than yet another review gushing about how great it is.  I am personally staying away from all the content of reviews because i want nothing spoiled, i have hardly watched any gameplay videos in the last several months etc.  But if a review came out against the grain i and probably a lot of other players would check it out to see if they have legitimate complaints or not."
gamernews,35ubzv,Schwillet,0,Thu May 14 04:06:19 2015 UTC,How about trusting the aggregate score instead? Maybe you're right about Gamespot but the other critics might give more honest reviews leaving Gamespot as the outlier.
gamernews,35ubzv,UnDire,-1,Thu May 14 02:05:37 2015 UTC,Giving it a 10 has probably made a huge increase to the traffic to their site the past two days. It was all over /r/games yesterday and today its a top post on /r/gamernews. Makes me a little skeptical.
gamernews,35ubzv,Dithinas,3,Wed May 13 22:02:34 2015 UTC,"So it sounds like this will have a very simple main plot of ""Find the girl"", but it'll be all the side-plots that will be the beef of the story. Much like Mass Effect 2 where there was a simple main story but the heart of the game was in doing the side quests to gain your crews trust, which ultimately tied together the final mission, and that turned out to be the best game of the series. If they get it right, I think I'm going to thoroughly enjoy this!"
gamernews,35ubzv,_Ganon,6,Thu May 14 01:37:44 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it has multiple main plots, just like Witcher 2. Was 2's main plot ""kill an assassin"", or was it "" find a girl "" or just ""not be a criminal"" or ""stop a conspiracy""? Witcher games merge multiple plots together."
gamernews,35ubzv,UnDire,2,Thu May 14 02:14:10 2015 UTC,"Definetely, but my point was that the emotional investment will be the side quests like ME2 by the sounds of things.

gamernews,35ubzv,c010rb1indusa,-6,Thu May 14 12:28:33 2015 UTC,"As a consumer who will probably be getting this for the PC, I'm not really convinced. After seeing the OP's link to the rest of Gamespot's ""Perfect 10's"" and finding GTAIV on that list (the PC port was terribly optimized for a long time, and probably runs worse than GTAV), I'm going to take it with a grain of salt and wait for post-launch reviews."
gamernews,35ubzv,deelowe,24,Wed May 13 20:09:40 2015 UTC,"The review for GTAIV was probably for the console version.  The PC version didn't come until much later.  Not to mention CD Projekt Red has, traditionally, been a PC developer, with consoles coming secondary to that, whereas Rockstar is the opposite.  Basing your opinion of a game on an entirely different game, from a different studio, in a different genre, with different goals, and a different development history is silly."
gamernews,35ubzv,AbsoluteOs,-10,Thu May 14 11:49:44 2015 UTC,"Is it really that silly? The review posted by GameSpot is for the PS4 version. Without a review for the PC version yet, I am not going to know if it is going to perform well on PCs.  Basing on track records is also silly. Maxis made a lot of good SimCity games in the past. Look at what happened to their latest iteration. Although CDPR has garnered a lot of goodwill with the PC gaming community in the past, there's no indication that this game will be optimized for the PC (besides their word).   I've never said that Witcher III will be a bad game on the PC. I'm being cautious. Caution when being a consumer is a good thing."
gamernews,35ubzv,heiland,4,Thu May 14 04:07:15 2015 UTC,"That is all true, but none of it is what you originally said.  Originally, you said you were skeptical of Gamespot's opinion because they gave GTAIV a 10 when the PC version did not perform well.  Which is a non sequitur and makes very little sense.  Here, in this comment, you've changed the argument.  Now you're skeptical because there's no PC review for the game, which is a perfectly valid reason to be cautious.  It's just not the same reasons you originally stated."
gamernews,35ubzv,heiland,1 point,Wed May 13 18:26:51 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure game reviewers don't put optimization issues as a large factor in their scores. Knowing whether a game runs well is one thing, and knowing what someone thinks about the game's actual content is a different thing. These review scores are for whether or not the reviewer liked the game, not how well optimized it is."
gamernews,35ubzv,dmol,1 point,Wed May 13 18:33:11 2015 UTC,"Basing on track records is also silly.   I disagree, many different aspects of business are intertwined with a companies reputation/track record.  You just need to factor in current knowledge of a company with their track record. The actual people responsible for Maxis's good reputation had all left the company years before Sim City 2013 was released. There was zero reason to believe that their reputation was intact.  Similarly much of the talent behind the early Bioware titles left before their slump around the time of Dragon Age 2 and SWTOR, so their reputation was not intact either.  Also see Dice with the release of Battlefield 3 and 4, many of the original members who founded Dice had left before those and many of the guys who got hired from the mod scene of 1942 to work on BF2 had also been long gone by that point.  Reputations are reliable so long as you know the company is stable.  A good company with the same people it has always had is more likely to produce a good game than a random new company.  Similarly a bad company with the same shitty people are more likely to release another turd that you should not buy."

gamernews,35ubzv,maxd,3,Wed May 13 19:13:19 2015 UTC,GTA IV didn't even release concurrently on PC. It was developed 100% for consoles and the PC port came around 6-8 months later if I recall correctly.  There's a big difference between that situation and this one as the PC is the lead platform for Witcher 3. It's not being ported over from consoles like GTA IV was. Not too surprising as CD Projekt Red is primarily a PC developer. All of their games thus far have been PC titles first and foremost.   I'm going to take it with a grain of salt and wait for post-launch reviews.   Absolutely. Everyone should always do this.
gamernews,35ubzv,HugoWeaver,1 point,Wed May 13 18:47:09 2015 UTC,"The xbox 360 version (the review you're referring to. The PC review was dreadful) is/was an awesome game. Same goes for GTA V. I'd put either of these in my ""best games of all time"" category. Some may not like the mechanics, gameplay, or setting. However, for what it is, it's a near perfect execution given current technologies.  I'd say the same for every other game in that list. They are all near perfect executions of what they are meant to represent.  That said, this is the PS4 review for TW3. So, PC or Xbox may have issues. Everyone should keep that in mind."

With that said, W3 looks really solid, my only fear is that it's too easy. It doesn't help that in the review he said something along the lines of ""it's a bit easier than other games you might be used to, so set the difficulty 1 notch higher"", the problem is if you already run max difficulty in games and it's often too easy.  An open world RPG that you just steamroll is never fun in the long run (see unmodded Skyrim as a prime example)."

gamernews,35tfys,TheHumanecentipede,1 point,Wed May 13 21:11:16 2015 UTC,"I'd say GT is much better these days. I go to the site daily and watch their shows & streams. They've lost a lot of staff since being bought by Defy but the people there (on camera) all seem like great people. Daniel Bloodworth wrote The Witcher 3 review (and did a Q&A on GT's Twitch yesterday) so feel free to look up his work (I only really disagree with his 'The Order' review which was high).  I've seen this, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61e_VXJReS0 and would agree with his premise, but from what I've seen, GT is very different now.  Lastly, I'm sure this sounds like super-shilling, but seeing how low their Twitch views are compared to the obnoxious sites/personalities kind of bums me out. If anyone's interested, their new-ish show GT Live is on Twitch tonight. Pretty much the whole staff is involved in these. Here's one of their better episodes (With Playboy's Pamela Horton): http://www.twitch.tv/gametrailers/v/4276824  GT Live airs Wednesdays at 6pm West coast (9pm EST)  Ok, I've hit Shill-amanjaro levels now, time to stop.

gamernews,35u3m0,on_with_disease,3,Wed May 13 15:12:09 2015 UTC,This makes my heart hurt
gamernews,35u3m0,on_with_disease,0,Wed May 13 15:12:55 2015 UTC,Yeah it's pathetic. You'd think after Bravely Default shattered all sales expectations that they'd go ahead and unleash more RPGs over here. I really wish I knew why they're so reluctant to give us Dragon Quest games.
gamernews,35u3m0,yineedname,3,Wed May 13 19:20:44 2015 UTC,"Well the Dragon Quest series has never had strong sales in the West. Dragon Quest IX sold at last 5 million copies in Japan, in the US it was a bit over 1 million. You can't just point at Bravely Default and say ""look, it works!"" when they have existing data that says otherwise."
gamernews,35u3m0,on_with_disease,1 point,Thu May 14 15:41:11 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty good sales number if you ask me, but this is the same company that said Tomb Raiders 6 million sold was ""unfortunate"" or something close to it.   Not to mention zero voice acting to translate is quite easy compared to what some companies go through to get their games over here.   But yeah, I can use Bravely Default as an example because they themselves were surprised. A new IP, selling as well as it did. Even got a sequel coming at some point.   They're just being straight morons over the whole thing, and there's nothing sales wise or anything in between that can justify it at this point. But I read an article today saying SE is more interested in the mobile phone space, so who knows if even their home land will get anymore solid games."
gamernews,35u3m0,yineedname,3,Thu May 14 17:01:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, internet commentor who apparently doesn't understand cost of production and ROI. You can't just say ""they're just being straight morons"" when they have probably done more than enough analysis to determine it's not cost effective for them to do it.  Besides, we got all the DS remakes, the only recent DQ game we've missed out on is the DQVII 3DS remake. It's not like they haven't given us nothing, and with this remake just announced there's absolutely no way we can say one way or the other than the US won't get this."

gamernews,35u3m0,on_with_disease,-1,Fri May 15 19:09:25 2015 UTC,"Not sure, but we did get quite a few on the DS. Which is why I find the fact that they've seemingly stopped supporting the 3DS even though it has a higher adoption rate, a bit puzzling.  Not to mention the outcry from fans for its arrival overseas and its endless praise on countless ""top JRPG"" lists from reliable publications.   It's really just a lazy move on my opinion. Oh but they can port the phone on Android and iPhones in Japan too, cause that's where the money is. It won't sell 2 million copies over here so why bother? /s"

gamernews,35uob4,JamoJustReddit,2,Wed May 13 18:25:57 2015 UTC,I don't know what you're talking bout.  HoW contains far better content than the last expansion along with many changes players have asked for.

I mean aware Destiny is incredibly flawed, but after seeing what the next expansion has to offer it doesn't deserve all the shit people like you give it.  Edit: also, ""atrocious waste of money for the consumers""?  Who are you to dictate how people spend their money.  I've purchased all the expansions so far and I'm still happily playing and enjoying the game.  Are you saying I've wasted money?"
gamernews,35uob4,JamoJustReddit,10,Wed May 13 20:58:57 2015 UTC,"That's the argument that pisses me off the most, when people call Bungie lazy or that they don't put In any effort.  Major non-gameplay changes is a sign of an active developer.  Also the changes aren't exclusive to the expansion.  It's coming to all players, but they just coincide with the release.    Is the game great?  No.  It still needs more content to be called great.  It's still fun.  Is it shit like you say it is?  Fuck no."

gamernews,35u4k0,mgilbert747,3,Wed May 13 15:23:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The way Season 3 ended, we almost need a companion DLC to be able to conveniently merge the possible endings for Season 3. Again, I just hope that the companion DLC actually has decisions that matter for the story, and not just which characters appear in Season 3 like with 400 Days."
gamernews,35u4k0,Jinno,3,Wed May 13 17:38:36 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. The decisions made in 400 days made little to no impact towards season two, other than certain characters appearing in Howe's Hardware. So lame. The only character that really mattered was Bonnie.. which was also a huge disappointment."
gamernews,35u4k0,mgilbert747,2,Wed May 13 17:56:07 2015 UTC,"I liked 400 Days okay for what it was, but I agree that its contribution to Season 2 was basically nil. Bonnie and Tavia are the only characters of any consequence, and they're both always at Carver's camp no matter what you did. The rest have one or two token lines and that's it.

They are free to spend their cash how they see fit.  What happens when the game is shit?  And when it comes to Assassin's Creed it will more than likely be stale shit with the same ""press B and only B to win"" gameplay that Assassin's Creed has pioneered for the past 10 years.  Or maybe Ubisoft will innovate more ways to try and weasel microtransactions out of their customers.  What will it be this time I wonder.  Purchasable keys to unlock the collectible chests?  Making the estate management portion of the game take place in real time but allow you to speed up the process by buying gems or trinkets with real money?  Who can say.  Nothings really been revealed about the game other than it exists and takes place London.  But that's more than enough to justify charging people 119 pounds to purchase the game right now.

On one hand this is yet another cheap cash grab. An thinly veiled attempt at reliving a time when Capcom wasn't shitting on its franchises.   On the other hand this a solid game. Not without it's problems, but solid. In addition to that, they're going back to add characters and at least some cut scenes in addition to an upgraded resolution.  Maybe Capcom needs this to stay afloat while they rethink their business strategy and decide how they're going to fit in with modern gaming.

You'd be surprised just how much formation plays in the de-escalation of civil unrest.  Riot police is much more than bashing shields against rocks and sticks.

Knowing EA of Europe they probably won't even beta test before release and rush in order to push the game by the end of the year. Setting is interesting though."

gamernews,35q4gl,TWOpies,-9,Tue May 12 19:29:24 2015 UTC,"Short answer is no. I am saying that over the past few years Ubisoft became as bad as Electronic Arts, hell even surpassing EA in terms of fucking up customer and milking the money. EA was being hated for DLCs, but at least with those you get extra play time in your beloved game while Ubisoft made you pay for in-game item with real money. So basicly Ubisoft officially became Electronic Arts of Europe by being complete douchebags."

I've played all the others and enjoyed all of them apart from 3.  New one looks cool, but I'll wait on how it performs and how stable it is. Unity was a big warning that Ubisoft is rushing things; Ubisoft shifting to a yearly cycle might not be the best move for the quality of their games."

Though it should really be termed a real-time-tactics rather than RTS.  Even setting aside the fact that you only have the ships you start each encounter with (which is a fine decision imho) most missions consist of concentrated battles with little cause to split forces or really control any sizeable portion of the map beyond your immediate objective.

gamernews,35ljhr,DrFeargood,5,Mon May 11 19:06:36 2015 UTC,This question doesn't even need to be asked. If the game hasn't yet been announced then of course there is an NDA.  Large companies like Bethesda put a lot of effort into the timing of their announcements using very complex marketing strategies.  Believe it or not the timing of announcing games in relation to release dates of that game (and even other games) can have an impact on the audience's reception of the information and  in turn sales numbers.
gamernews,35ljhr,Sunago,2,Mon May 11 19:19:03 2015 UTC,very complex marketing strategies? Are you sure you are talking about Bethesda?
gamernews,35ljhr,DrFeargood,3,Mon May 11 20:01:55 2015 UTC,As much as I don't like them sometimes I'm sure they employ a variety of marketing professionals.

gamernews,35ljhr,Sunago,3,Tue May 12 00:17:54 2015 UTC,"There are things like 'planned leaks' for almost any big company.

There are also 'happy accidental leaks' where the company actually likes that it got leaked if the feedback is very positive and unexpected hyping occurs. The Deadpool test footage trailer for instance was a Happy accidental leak. Planned leaks however almost never get confirmed as such though."

Some people want to play that game and nothing is going to convince them otherwise. It especially won't work for a franchise like this that already has a large hype and fanbase.

gamernews,35llno,Fa11enAngeLIV,-4,Tue May 19 05:44:32 2015 UTC,There was a post on here earlier of someone who apparently got a early release copy or something. Claims they pulled an EA. Someone more motivate/bored than I am could go find it and figure out what the story behind it is.
gamernews,35llno,Anzai,4,Mon May 11 14:50:21 2015 UTC,Maybe people shouldn't get so obsessed with specific graphical effects and just enjoy the content of a game then.
gamernews,35llno,silverside30,4,Mon May 11 19:53:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. Graphics can be nice, but in this day and age, games look good enough. Honestly, I think people's obsession with graphical fidelity is skewing AAA devs' perception of what people want, and this leads to gameplay and writing stagnation. Yeah games sure do look nice now, but most AAA games are grindy snoozefests. If they spent a tenth of their graphical budget on hiring a competent writer, I think games could be much more interesting."
gamernews,35llno,Anzai,2,Mon May 11 20:17:12 2015 UTC,"I'm getting pretty sick of 'cinematic' style games that end up basically being on rails. They look good, sure, but there's no emergent gameplay to be had in many titles now. The trailers always looks great to people, but they are strictly one playthrough only usually, and sometimes not even that. Graphics get you nowhere if the game isn't fun to play."
gamernews,35llno,sonicmerlin,2,Tue May 12 07:25:13 2015 UTC,Most game engines are still stuck on the PS3/X360 era though.  I'm really looking forward to seeing games made exclusively for the new gen.

Between the endless Early Access games that seem to never become fully realized or dwindle in to obscurity, maybe we should stop being ""excited"" and just be interested with calm, reasonable expectations.   Believe me, I get this rush in my stomach like a school girl when my Game Informer comes in the mail with the ""next big thing"" on the cover, or a news leak for a big unknown game.

There was a better video explaining the process that I can't seem to track down, but this video from NVIDIA explains both the process of scaling images up to match 1080p and also scaling down 4k images to 1080p."

gamernews,35h7ij,DistrictSleepsAlone,6,Sun May 10 15:29:00 2015 UTC,"The developers said not really as they will give a good round-up of the story in the game. Buy you can also check this post someone made that the developers refereed to, http://gamingpcforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Hw9k8X.png"
gamernews,35h7ij,goatsaredumb,5,Sun May 10 12:14:25 2015 UTC,"In Arkham and Shadow of Mordor, I would say the fighting is very snappy. That is, you snap on to enemies by just facing in their general direction, and that makes transitioning from one enemy to another very simple.   Witcher series combat is less straight forward. It's still possible to lock on to an enemy, by it's not automatic. Which means if you're not paying attention, it's totally possible to swing and hit air when they didn't even dodge. That being said, if you practice and get good, you can make the combat look very fluid like in this video, but don't expect it from the start.   Basically, the combat is more meticulous, you really have to pay attention. More than that, if you're fighting something other than humans, you're likely going to want to prepare by finding and reading material on them, which can identify weaknesses and attacks you should know how to avoid. On a fight-to-fight basis, it's generally much deeper than a lot of other games.   And for your last question, the lore is pretty great, so I recommend you play the other games, or at least 2. But you most likely won't have to. Developers have said that they put a lot of effort to cater to both fans and newcomers. I expect you'll get a lot more out of it if you've played the other ones, but I don't think you'll ever be lost for skipping them."
gamernews,35h7ij,DistrictSleepsAlone,7,Sun May 10 13:14:32 2015 UTC,"The combat in batman and mordor is also heavily dependent on scoring many hits in a row and dodging at exactly the right time, there isn't a lot of room for improvisation. The Witcher has always felt very open battle wise, at least to me."
gamernews,35h7ij,gizza,4,Sun May 10 14:52:49 2015 UTC,Very good point. The way The Witcher combat works really lets you play they way you want to.
gamernews,35h7ij,MrTastix,2,Sun May 10 15:31:37 2015 UTC,Exactly. Also I find the combat in the Arkham games to be extremely easy (as in there's very little danger of actually dying). The challenge comes from increasing your multiplier and combo bonuses. That's basically the complete opposite of The Witcher 2 combat in which you can die very quickly if you make mistakes.
gamernews,35h7ij,goatsaredumb,1 point,Sun May 10 15:36:20 2015 UTC,At least since the second game.  The first one was based on combos and timed attacks as well. You would have to time the next attack correctly or you'd fumble and have to start the chain again.  A lot of people didn't like the system as it felt clunky (so it was ultimately removed from TW2) but I liked it just for how different it felt at the time. I'd never seen something like it.
gamernews,35h7ij,jellyfish137,0,Sun May 10 16:16:14 2015 UTC,I think The Witcher nails third person sword combat. I haven't played a more fun or satisfying sword game yet.

I tried to play the first but the outdated clunky controls make it very hard to progress (at least for me anyway), so I just watched a youtube video which recapped on what happened. I then downloaded a Witcher 1 save which had the story decisions I would have made (who you side with, etc) and loaded it into Witcher 2."
gamernews,35h7ij,HollisFenner,12,Sun May 10 20:17:41 2015 UTC,I hope the PC graphics are better.

gamernews,35h7ij,Wasabi_Toothpaste,2,Mon May 11 18:49:32 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's bad, but it definitely just needs to be a tad darker. Mainly the blood is too bright."

gamernews,35h7ij,TheWordFromMars,1 point,Mon May 11 06:08:37 2015 UTC,"I love the colour. I'm so sick of games being all washed out and colourless. Gears of War 1 for example, or even Skyrim without mods. While I agree that super bright colours can look very 'videogamey', the antidote is not washed out colour. It looks just as fake, but also more lifeless. Very few games I've seen get it right in the sweet spot, but given the choice, I'll take colourful over drab.  And honestly, in this case, I don't even think it is too far in that direction. It's quite nice."
gamernews,35h7ij,Bamith,3,Mon May 11 06:24:24 2015 UTC,The colors look off In this. Like way too saturated. I really hope the PC version looks better than this (if this isn't PC). Either way I got it for free with my 970 and will play it because the gameplay looks solid.

gamernews,35h7ij,Wholemeal,8,Mon May 11 06:57:10 2015 UTC,How can you tell from this? It's all a bit low res compared to the real game anyway. Even if it looks exactly like Witcher 2 I'm sold. It's open world and massive.
gamernews,35h7ij,Anzai,6,Sun May 10 11:18:12 2015 UTC,"Thing is, we don't know if this is PC, PS4, or XB1. Plus there's a good amount of compression."

gamernews,35h7ij,gizza,2,Sun May 10 11:25:16 2015 UTC,Witcher 2 on Xbox 360 at least had some god awful shadows. This looked a lot better in that regard. I played the PC version as well but it was so buggy I ended up just buying the console version so my textures wouldn't just flat out disappear all the time.
gamernews,35h7ij,Ubyte64,2,Sun May 10 11:36:08 2015 UTC,"I would assume XB1, based on the button prompts in the bottom right corner.  However those would show up on a PC using a controller anyway, so who knows."
gamernews,35h7ij,pcultimate,4,Sun May 10 11:52:36 2015 UTC,"It's just you. Played TW2 recently, while it's still a great looking game, it's nowhere near this level. Character models are far lesss detailed, shadows are often weird, the lighting is actually pretty crap with everything having a wierd halo kinda glow around it.  Anyone who thinks TW3 is barely better than TW2 graphics wise is either delusional or has forgotten what TW2 actually looks like."
gamernews,35h7ij,xzybit,2,Sun May 10 11:45:12 2015 UTC,I was just gonna say that to this guy.
gamernews,35h7ij,pcultimate,3,Sun May 10 16:19:00 2015 UTC,"Nah, I don't think it's you. I used to say ""well, it's open-world"" or ""maybe it's the console version"" but even Angry joe's PC session looked... yeah. In fact, the first thing I did after it was to boot up Witcher 2. Then I blamed it on Youtube artifact but even in videos W2 looks better.  I think it's probably a mix of factors. Open-world. The small environments in W2 could be packed with detail never feasible in open-world (at least not out of towns and landmarks). And the fact that lighting and envrionmental effects play a huge role.  I'm more than certain W3 is breathtaking when looking at the horizon, sailing through a storm or walking the woods at night. At the same time, the reduction in fidelitiy is pretty noticeable when roaming the many fields in broad daylight.  Either way, it's a great looking game. Maybe I'm too picky. I played GTA V in 4k maxed out on a friend's beast of a dual Titan rig and... Idk. My reaction was more like ""oh, that's really clear."" Nothing like the first time I played Crysis or anything like that. :/"
gamernews,35h7ij,xzybit,3,Sun May 10 16:41:47 2015 UTC,"I know how you feel, there hasn't been a game that has blown me away graphically lately, most of them look very good now a days granted, but there hasn't been one where I was just amazed, maybe at one or other effect but not at everything"
gamernews,35h7ij,Pluckerpluck,1 point,Sun May 10 12:17:46 2015 UTC,"I think next gen's gonna be pretty subtle.\  Like, some of the advanced lighting effects and better animations are relatively subtle compared to previous changes in fidelity but holy hell do they make a difference. The improvements in animation is where I've felt the biggest advance, actually, and I love it.  Personally, I'm really invested in Star Citizen and if that pans out (and so far my experience with the devs has been stellar) I will sink into a VR fueled hole with that game. :O"

gamernews,35h7ij,HollisFenner,1 point,Sun May 10 13:10:42 2015 UTC,"maybe we'll even get a depth of field   Why do you even want this in a game? Without eye tracking it just doesn't make sense. In real life our Depth of Field is tiny, we don't want that in a game. It would be terrible.  Now maybe in VR with eye tracking it could become a thing (which would help lower the work done by the graphics card), but elsewhere I don't want depth of field at all.  Unless you're talking about something else all together. Also, what's wrong with fog right now, I've never had an issue with it?"

Originally I assumed you were paying more just to get a bunch of pretty ships to show off, but it seems like you can buy some pretty powerful ships.

gamernews,35ecrj,Tejirof,5,Sat May 9 22:26:42 2015 UTC,Thank you! That last example really nailed it home for me. I forgot you basically need a crew to fly the bigger ships so just owning one isn't much help without other people.

They replied:   The upgrade system for in game is still being discussed and thought out so i am unable to confirm how this will work i am afraid. However you will have to apply any upgrades pledged for now before the games launch.   So currently they're still under the impression that if you don't claim your purchases or upgrades before launch you will lose them. Which suggests that buying will no longer once game launches."

gamernews,35aa03,gamerqc,6,Fri May 8 16:51:14 2015 UTC,They mention developing for pc now.   Pokemon mmo. It is finally happening.
gamernews,35aa03,maxis2k,13,Sat May 9 06:26:23 2015 UTC,Prediction: Nintendo's first mobile games will be 'very good' not great. However sales will exceed Nintendo's revenue projections. As a result they will accelerate their mobile development and eventually exit the hardware business (2019). They will set the new gold standard for mobile casual games.
gamernews,35aa03,infinitelives,26,Fri May 8 15:24:49 2015 UTC,Prediction: it will be like pokemon shuffle or the other f2p games on ds
gamernews,35aa03,spdrstar,-6,Fri May 8 16:08:30 2015 UTC,That's fine. The F2P Pokémon games are totally nonintrusive like other F2P's. They don't even feel F2P.
gamernews,35aa03,TootsMagoon,11,Fri May 8 16:49:20 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but playing Pokemon Shuffle feels like playing Candy Crush.
gamernews,35aa03,zenshark,6,Fri May 8 18:14:16 2015 UTC,"I tried Pokemon shuffle because my 3DS wouldn't stop reminding me to try it.  I played about 5 minutes of it before I realized I would have to 'pay' to get more Pokeballs or wait a whole day just to play again.  Its the exact same formula as Tapped Out on smartphones.  And the gameplay was just a typical puzzle game.  Nothing unique like Meteos or Puyo Puyo or something.  So it wasn't even going to hold my attention as much as something like Captain Toad or heck, you could buy Donkey Kong 94 for $5 and play that forever.  The problem with mobile phone gaming is, it is a HUGE growing market, but not many traditional gamers are going to it.  So if Nintendo dumps their hardware and just runs to smartphones, they'll basically lose all their 30+ year old Nintendo fans, all to rush to this new market.  Nintendo is the one company in the world where console exclusivity is still a smart business model.  And as much as it may not look like it now, I think Smartphone games will see a massive drop off in a few years.  Heck, King is already seeing a huge drop off."
gamernews,35aa03,Robot_xj9,3,Fri May 8 20:40:49 2015 UTC,"As much as I dislike this prediction, it's worthy of discussion and shouldn't be downvoted.  If 15 million people pay $5 each, that works out to more revenue than 1 million people paying $60 each.  (Never mind the added benefit of mobile ""whales."")  If Nintendo mobile apps become majorly successful and draw in huge numbers of paying customers, they're going to have a hard time justifying the continuation of their less profitable home console/portable ""side business."""
gamernews,35aa03,whyufail1,1 point,Fri May 8 20:10:03 2015 UTC,Why do people assume Nintendo doesn't make that much money on their consoles? They out sale on handhelds over their competitors almost every time and do really well off their consoles due to the overwhelming amount of first party sales. These mobile games will most likely be puzzle and dragon style or emulated games people are playing on android anyways. It's just smarter to offer paid emulation then not profit at all from it.
gamernews,35aa03,WesWarlord,-2,Mon May 11 06:17:00 2015 UTC,Well put. Then imagine if they developed for PS4 & XB1.

Doesn't seem so laughable now that you have big players developing for mobile games. Nintendo already develops touched based games for their DS line, it makes perfect sense that their games will be better than the pile of trash currently on Play and AppStore.  They actually released a couple of mobile-esqe games on their 3DS system recently, most notable a pokemon beat-em-up called ""Pokemon Rumble Blast"" that includes micro-transactions."

gamernews,35aa03,ehManiacal,6,Fri May 8 17:41:41 2015 UTC,"Do you really think $40 games are going to swing on mobile? No, its going to necessitate the microtransaction baggage and design that I do not care for and don't fit what their current IPs are about. Lack of proper physical controls is also a big off putting point. Virtual controls and touch alone won't do the trick. Touch works on DS in conjunction with its traditional controls, but many would be iffy at best with only touch. Call me closed minded, but you're overly optimistic that this won't just be a bastardization of what people knew Nintendo for. (And how is twewy a good example? Reception of that was terrible because of microtransactions and a complete lack of support which resulted in it not working for a large number of people. Building for multiple platforms that are going to change is a whole other issue. Nobody is going to break out an old phone to play a game that only supports x version of iOS or Android)"

Maybe it will be in the future when we get mobile games as complex and as diverse as the standard console/PC games but that hasn't happened yet.

Because I just checked, and I'm still laughing at that prospect. The mobile market is huge not because gamers transitioned to phones, but because phones brought games to non-gamers. The good mobile games are very few and very far between, and the amount of serious gaming done on phones is, if not zero, so small as to be insignificant.  And the f2p games Nintendo has been trying are just as shit -- so much so that Pokemon Shuffle is literally Pokemon-branded Candy Crush. If Nintendo's mobile games end up being anything other than turning their IP into a low-quality cash-grab, I volunteer to get fucked by a unicorn in the middle of Hell's ice rink."
gamernews,35aa03,EmoryM,2,Sat May 9 07:20:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the idea that phone games will make people want to play actual games is a joke. People play phone games because they are cheap and easy to play ANYWHERE, not because they're yearning for a taste of a true video game. I predict this to be the next step on Nintendo's long journey from being the artists that brought us games like Majora's Mask, to being the sell outs who brought us games like a remake of Majora's Mask. They've realized their company can't be sustained by the mediocre and barely-satisfying games they've been making recently, so the easiest solution is to just make even smaller games that are even easier to make."

I'm not sure that the success of the 3DS can be attributed to having 2 screens (or 3D) as much as the library.  Same thing with the Wii U.  I've seen Nintendo ditch a handheld line before - the GameBoy - when a ""third pillar"" proved to be much more successful.  If Nintendo's mobile games achieve Puzzles & Dragons-level success then I don't expect it will be business as usual.  Hopefully the next Nintendo handheld is also an Android phone."

Nintendo joining DeNA, previously known as Mobage, is a sign that they may be taking on a different model of how they offer games. Mobage games have been known to take you to a certain point before you pretty much need to pay or you are stuck. That concept freaks people out.

gamernews,35aalr,jacknash,10,Fri May 8 12:53:30 2015 UTC,"The third and most tragic point has to do with the letter D. As in “enableD=garbage collector”. While we optimized the garbage collector (which cleans up “leftovers” on the server, so they don’t clog memory) and following some of the suggestions we got from our code-slinging community members, it did not seem to do the trick. We dug deeper and deeper into garbage collector settings but to no avail – each time the game would just use up the memory available and despite further optimization efforts this did not change considerably. The reason was finally found to be a missing “D” in the config file, which read “enable=garbage collector” instead of enabled. Of course we had looked at every line of this configuration file what must have been a hundred times, but you know how the brain tends to just create the word it expects to see, especially when you did not have more than two hours of sleep for days fighting a lag that was killing your game? This was one of the cases (and enable and enabled are not that far apart). Once we found it, we hit ourselves over the head repeatedly with blunt objects.    This is why you don't half-ass your code without error checking.  Your config file reader should ALWAYS spit out a warning when it finds an unrecognized variable.  The problem isn't that you made a typo or that you couldn't see it, it's that you didn't code properly in the first place to catch such errors."

gamernews,359qie,leighbo,1 point,Fri May 8 18:24:45 2015 UTC,"Awesome, you're here!  I'm just going to throw this out there.  What (I believe) makes these types of games successful is a) variety of quality loot  b) lots of said loot and c) gear changes your appearance.  Of course the gameplay needs to be solid and it looks like it is.  But being able to seek out and be rewarded with loot and have that change your character's appearance is the fuel that keeps players going.  Many similar action rpgs fail to do this and your character just ends up looking generic."
gamernews,359qie,elessarjd,2,Fri May 8 18:57:29 2015 UTC,"I totally agree!  I hope you will enjoy the exclusive feature of the game we will announce in the Kickstarter. I can't really say more right now, but this will definitively be the idea!"
gamernews,359qie,UmbraGame,1 point,Fri May 8 20:55:28 2015 UTC,If you're going that route of having gear change your character please can you make a website-based way to view all the armors and how they appear on the characters? I've been wanting that for D3 and other stuff but I can't find any.

gamernews,359qie,UmbraGame,2,Fri May 8 18:01:30 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the decision to put all the key information in each of the corners separated by a large empty gap for a hack-and-slash title.

gamernews,359qie,UmbraGame,1 point,Fri May 8 14:53:07 2015 UTC,About about having them form the 4 quadrants of a circular mouse cursor? That way they're always where the player's focus is.

gamernews,359tmc,Corrom,2,Fri May 8 15:44:53 2015 UTC,"The ads in the beginning are of the Brazilian government. They pay through the Ministry of Culture to get stuff made. Its mostly movies though.  Most people around here think its a huge waste of money because most projects funded would never have a flat chance in hell of being commercially successful on their own, and just serve as a huge ego stroking for politically connected, film school douches.  That's actually the reason why most of Brazilian cinema despite a few gems, is composed mostly of pretentious hipster circlejerks.  And now I see they are starting to fund games as well. Don't get me wrong, this game may turn out to be great. I just think we have better things to spend our tax money on."
gamernews,359tmc,Uptonogood,1 point,Fri May 8 15:53:05 2015 UTC,"Except they didn't got funded with just Tax money?

gamernews,359tmc,masasuka,0,Fri May 8 17:49:12 2015 UTC,"While it seems crazy that a country with so much abject poverty is setting aside money for the arts, I have no idea what percentage of the total budget is going towards this (my guess is it's not much), and I'm a vocal supporter of government-subsidized media. You're right - some of these projects would be commercial flops. But the art form is about more than just The Avengers and other major films which have a lot of flash but little lasting substance. The arts are about exploring the world we live in, and that doesn't always translate to ticket sales. Any country whose government helps produce media is on the right track in my book.  And this isn't to say movies like The Avengers don't have their place either, because they do. I enjoy mindless action more than most people, but if we're not creating thought-provoking art, we as a species are failing."
gamernews,359tmc,flumpis,1 point,Fri May 8 20:19:41 2015 UTC,"Art should not be funded by the government. The government should fund healthcare, social services, etc."
gamernews,359tmc,Raper-Of-Mars,-1,Sun May 10 00:31:29 2015 UTC,Why not? Art enriches the lives of citizens. Couldn't that be seen as a social service?
gamernews,359tmc,flumpis,1 point,Mon May 11 12:08:36 2015 UTC,"lol what?   Is a song going to help the people in need of urgent medical attention? Is a movie going to find a lawyer for a man who can't afford one? Is a piece of art going to help build a recreational center?  No, because art doesn't ''enriches the lives'' of people. It may be something nice to inspire us, but the goverment should spend their money that will help EVERYONE in an OBJECTIVE way.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a musician and compose sometimes, but art should be left to the art companies, not the government. Especially a government that NEEDS to invest in social benefits."
gamernews,359tmc,Raper-Of-Mars,0,Mon May 11 13:03:40 2015 UTC,"You consider yourself a musician and you don't think art enriches our lives?  Why do you personally play music?   No one is saying governments should break the bank contributing to the arts. Even a tiny bit of money (like a fraction of 1% of total budget) would be enough to make a difference and make some real great art. For reference, the US budget in 2014 was over $3 TRILLION. 1% of that is $30 billion. Taking a fraction of that and putting it towards social enrichment is a drop in the bucket and improves our lives.  Plus, governments that are established and not struggling to stay afloat don't have to choose between the situations you outlined and sponsoring a gallery of art or co-producing a documentary. They can very easily do it all. However, you're right - a government that NEEDS to invest in something like police and fire and doesn't have the funds to do anything else should stay away from sponsoring art, at least until they get their act together.  It's undeniable that the arts help people grow and better help us understand ourselves and the world we live in. The ""art companies"" (whatever that means) are obligated to turn a profit, and as such their work is compromised by money in a lot of cases. If you have programs that are unaffected by profits, artists can focus on the art and produce works with more power to stimulate thought and conversation."
gamernews,359tmc,flumpis,2,Mon May 11 13:47:53 2015 UTC,"I do think it enriches our lives, but not in a way that the government should use our taxpayer money on.  If the government were to invest in the arts, I believe that it may be more effective to invest in art SCHOOLS in order to form people who would be able to create such art. That seems, to me, like a better way to not only encourage creation, but can create more qualified individuals.  I'm not completely excluding the idea. It may be beneficial in the future. But right now, our government needs to invest in more objective ways of enrichment (ie Healthcare, etc.)  And I think you misunderstood my first statment . I didn't say that art doesn't enrich our lives. Just that social services enrich them a lot more."
gamernews,359tmc,Raper-Of-Mars,0,Mon May 11 15:26:47 2015 UTC,"First world countries don't need to choose between funding the arts and funding arts education. There is more than enough money for both. A number of countries do this. I agree that arts education is hugely important and that it can create qualified individuals. And as I mentioned, this doesn't require tons of money and can be done concurrently while, say, overhauling the heathcare system. Putting off something like this which has minimal cost (in the relative sense) means it will never be done, because there are always bigger issues plaguing us.   In addition, if the government stayed out of the arts, there would be a very noticeable void of content. If we remove government subsidies, you can say good bye to shows like Sherlock, which is a co-production of Hartswood Films, BBC, and WGBH (a PBS station located in Boston). You can also say goodbye (in part or in full) to such great shows as Monty Python's Flying Circus, NOVA, and Sesame Street, which likely wouldn't exist without public television, an extension of government-funded arts. I'm citing mainly TV here because I'm most familiar with it, but government-funded film is in the same category. It would be foolish to leave the production of arts, especially large projects like games and films, to private production groups since they are in the business to make money, not art. With government-subsidized art we can get closer to uncompromising visions than we can without them."

gamernews,3566m9,Slumberfunk,9,Thu May 7 15:29:03 2015 UTC,Does  FC4 use Uplay?    I might even buy it if it does not.

gamernews,3566m9,Cognittie,3,Thu May 7 23:18:18 2015 UTC,That is shitty.
gamernews,3566m9,--TacoLoco--,5,Thu May 7 20:51:27 2015 UTC,This game was really repetitive & average. Definitely one to miss if you're considering playing it
gamernews,3566m9,billywob,8,Thu May 7 23:22:51 2015 UTC,Agreed. It was essentially a reskinned Far Cry 3. Ubisoft has gotten lazy/greedy in the development cycle.
gamernews,3566m9,Veritasgear,4,Thu May 7 21:59:24 2015 UTC,"While repetitive, I wouldn't say it's average. I poured at least 100+ hours into it and enjoyed every minute."
gamernews,3566m9,Arcon1337,1 point,Thu May 7 22:39:59 2015 UTC,"While I enjoyed it as well, others may not be into that type of game. So it's a fair warning for those not interested in repetition."

gamernews,3566m9,Super-being,1 point,Thu May 7 22:40:02 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved Farcry 3. I gave up on Farcry 4 a few hours in (a few hours after you have those weird visions regarding the Indian gods and tigers and such). I felt the story lacked cohesion, and everything available to you felt like a poor attempt to just get you shooting things.   It's kind of like in any Ubisoft games you have all those faux-sidequests that litter your map, but in FC4, even the main quests felt as if you were playing a subpar sidequest."
gamernews,3566m9,cycophuk,6,Tue May 12 21:41:13 2015 UTC,And this is one of the reasons why I've stopped buying games day one.  Why bother when they will just package everything at a discount later down the line.
gamernews,3566m9,cycophuk,-1,Sun May 24 19:25:10 2015 UTC,"True, but companies are making it very obvious that the investment isn't worth your money or time when it's discounted or bundled so soon after launch."
gamernews,3566m9,PaintItPurple,8,Thu May 7 17:01:09 2015 UTC,"Why does discounting it seven months later (when most people will have already stopped playing the game) make it very obvious that the investment isn't worth my money or time?   Like rmh86 said, we already know the game will be cheaper in the future. If you want to get things as cheaply as possible, waiting is almost always the optimal strategy. But I don't see how it's very obvious that the investment isn't worth my money or time. If I wanted to play the game back in November and I bought it and enjoyed it, that seems like it was worth my money and time."
gamernews,3566m9,cycophuk,-2,Thu May 7 19:24:16 2015 UTC,"Look, this isn't anything to get riled up about.  If you are happy to drop full price on release date and feel you got your money's worth, then awesome for you.    However, for people like myself who don't see the point of paying full price when it will be next to nothing barely half a year later, don't see it as a wise investment.  It would be worth my time and money to play the games I already have, that I bought at a discount, and wait for prices to drop like they do the majority of the time.  If that means I have to wait a year so I can buy the game and all it's DLC for 10 bucks, then it's not a big deal for me.  I have plenty of games to keep me busy until then."

gamernews,3566m9,Jeembo,3,Thu May 7 20:20:49 2015 UTC,lolwat.  It's only been out for like 6 months and they're already announcing a goty version?
gamernews,3566m9,y0haN,2,Thu May 7 21:15:02 2015 UTC,I thought Microsoft had a clause to stop this happening.
gamernews,3566m9,Neo-Calypso,4,Fri May 8 02:15:55 2015 UTC,They have the exact opposite in their parity clause which is bring a game to their system but nothing else. But also I think that only applies to indies or something? It's obviously not an across the board thing because then they probably get even less third party games.
gamernews,3566m9,huenchu,1 point,Thu May 7 17:30:01 2015 UTC,this is what happens when a developer realizes that they're not selling the dlc as much as they expected so they resort to bundling it with the game so they at least sell a few thousand copies...but that's what they should have done at launch and release a complete game.
gamernews,3566m9,ProfessorStupidCool,0,Thu May 7 16:24:46 2015 UTC,"So wait, they've been selling an incomplete game?    What a terrible lingo this industry has developed."

gamernews,3566m9,SoefianB,2,Thu May 7 17:28:46 2015 UTC,"Not really, this version contains all the DLC at once, hence why it's called the complete edition.  The normal version doesn't have the DLC. But if you buy the normal edition and all DLC, you technically have the complete edition."

gamernews,351v0f,lucidvein,9,Wed May 6 23:44:50 2015 UTC,I'd like to be loyal to Oculus since they are the ones that got the ball rolling on this but we'll see how the specs are in the end.
gamernews,351v0f,Sabbathius,27,Wed May 6 17:14:36 2015 UTC,"It might even boil out to something simple - like which VR handles vision problems better. Like, I need glasses, and I hate contacts. If one VR accommodates me very well, and the other doesn't, the choice will be pretty clear.  The sucky part will be if none of them deal with glasses well, and I'll have to get Lasik or some shit just to play games.

I mean, if one set goes over regular glasses, and the other requires special-made lenses that could cost another hundred or two? Not to mention that as eyesight deteriorates with age, I might need another set some years down the line? Could definitely affect the buying decision. But yeah, we'll see."

gamernews,351v0f,64fanatic,1 point,Thu May 7 02:28:43 2015 UTC,Yea but glasses cost me 300-500+ for prescription changes and frames every 1-2 years. Long term  its a good deal. I'm saving up for Lasik and one of the reasons is more comfortable VR.
gamernews,351v0f,grassman7z7work,1 point,Thu May 7 03:03:53 2015 UTC,"LASIK is a great investment just from a purely cost standpoint. However, add in the value of always being able to see, not having to stress about breaking/scratching frames/glasses, and never needing to suffer though contacts, and the payoff is way sooner than you think.  Good luck getting LASIK! You'll be super glad when you do."

For my age and income, it's always been hard to find glasses I actually like.

It's about making sure you consider the team that is responsible for all these devices coming to market and the team with the longest development.    You know these other companies are just piggybacking off the buzz created by the Oculus.  Not that competitors can't make a better product.  Valve is greatly loved but when it comes to hardware they haven't made anything that stands out (steam controller anyone?).

gamernews,351v0f,lucidvein,2,Thu May 7 02:29:39 2015 UTC,I lost all interest in Oculus when Facebook took it over.
gamernews,351v0f,BeartrapSandwich,3,Wed May 6 21:36:55 2015 UTC,But John Carmack works on Oculus.. the guy that made the FPS genre.  I wouldn't write them off.
gamernews,351v0f,lucidvein,3,Wed May 6 20:54:11 2015 UTC,I would.   Oculus sold out to a guy who made billions selling people to advertisers. They could have a dream team composed of the greatest minds in gaming and they still wouldn't get any of my money.
gamernews,351v0f,BeartrapSandwich,3,Wed May 6 22:13:30 2015 UTC,It could go anyway.. facebook could push them to meet their demands.. or facebook could value the creative on the team and fuel them with bundles of money.. stay fairly hands off and then collect the profits when it's released.  I don't expect to see heavy integration into facebook or something like that.  Facebook was just looking for things to invest in because they got loaded.    Like I said could be a plus or minus we'll see how it goes but I wouldn't blow it off now.
gamernews,351v0f,lucidvein,3,Wed May 6 22:39:11 2015 UTC,facebook could . . . stay fairly hands off   I don't think their shareholders will be likely to appreciate that when VR goes mainstream.
gamernews,351v0f,BeartrapSandwich,2,Wed May 6 22:47:23 2015 UTC,All the shareholders care about is facebooks bottom line.  If oculus develops into a success and changes the way people consume media then it's a huge win for them.  It's not something you want to rush because you don't want it to become a fad.. you want it to become the future.    Then again with all these other companies seeing the interest and throwing their hats in the ring I'm sure this puts a lot of pressure to release a consumer version.
gamernews,351v0f,PalermoJohn,4,Wed May 6 23:08:29 2015 UTC,"All the shareholders care about is facebooks bottom line one quarterly report at a time.    Even if this generation of VR isn't successful, Oculus will be unable to prevent their new owners from monetizing them in whatever method provides the quickest profit. Baking in Facebook-style spyware into the firmware is inevitable given the monetary and political pressures involved, and I wouldn't put it past them to add mandatory advertisements too.   If Oculus wanted my money, they wouldn't have sold out their original fanbase. I'm still livid that Facebook has my personal information now thanks to my having pitched in on the original Oculus kickstarter."

We don't have final specs for things yet, but the stuff I read, Valve's stuff was real impressive. And if it beats Oculus to release by a few months? Could really hurt Oculus sales-wise.  There's still a wildcard here though - the porn industry. Historically, whichever tech the porn industry adopted, usually became the dominant one. VHS vs Betamax, HD DVD vs Blu-Ray, etc. So there's that too. But again, I'd wager that Valve's policy would be more forgiving than Facebook's, at least so far their licensing seems to be really friendly. But hey, guess we'll see how it all plays out."

gamernews,351v0f,hobdodgeries,1 point,Wed May 6 17:53:19 2015 UTC,Depends on how you look at it. Like the printing press didnt really come around until pornography was being printed and then it took off since you know... people like porn. Hell a pope wrote an erotic novel at one point and had it printed.   Pornography is pushing quite a few technologies as well in an attempt to future secure. The VHS stuff im not too sure about but its not doubt that the pornography industry has some big clout behind it in the form of consumers who just want porn.

gamernews,351v0f,ihatewil,1 point,Wed May 6 14:11:41 2015 UTC,"I think you are reading too much into it. John Carmack has been  telling devs on twitter to develop games with either a swivel chair or standing as it's focus. For movement (first person perspective) standing removes motion sickness. If your body moves in the direction you want to go, either in a swivel chair or by turning while you stand, you don't feel dizzy. This does not indicate any change in tech, at all.  It's pretty consistent with what they've been saying since before the DK2"
gamernews,351v0f,the_fascist,2,Wed May 6 14:26:50 2015 UTC,I tried it not too long ago. It was a roller-coaster demo and I was standing. I really had a hard time standing straight. My friend even had to hold me at one point. I hope to be able to get past that.
gamernews,351v0f,SarahC,2,Wed May 6 15:11:14 2015 UTC,"That has nothing to do with what I just said. You are not controlling directional movement with a rollercoster. We are talking about moving left and right, walking or running, like in a fps. Using the control pad to turn causes some people to get motion sickness. Standing and turning left and right in a circle solves this, so does using a swivel chair.  A rollercoaster you have absolutely no control of movement, you are just along for the ride, so of course standing straight would be near impossible :)."

Either this will HAVE to be the better product, have some seriously good reasons to get it (like having more support for games or apps or whatever), or it will simply bomb.

How did it go so badly wrong?"
gamernews,351v0f,ours,2,Thu May 7 11:56:32 2015 UTC,First to market is no guarantee of winning the market. Plus this is a new form of media and it's just the beginning (hopefully) in terms of mass adoption. These early devices are critical to allow mass adoption but I'm guess most people (i.e. not the kind of people that come to such gaming forums) will only get in at gen 2 or 3.  If Oculus somehow comes with a better product or released a better gen 2 product they can win back the market.  I think them just making sure there is a mass market for VR in the next few years is a very smart approach.
gamernews,351v0f,Cobalt81,1 point,Thu May 7 01:43:43 2015 UTC,"You're right, we don't know, but we also don't know how many gens VR will put out or how successful it'll be, anything of the sort. I honestly wasn't interested in VR when Oculus was getting big on and after kickstarter. I was happy to see it becoming a thing, but it didn't interest me. For some reason, I cannot explain why, but when Valve announced theirs, I was excited. It depends on price and number of supported games, but I have my eye on it, I may get it.  I once bought a Novint Falcon, a haptic device that replaces the mouse. I had a great time with it and loved using it, but its number of supported games was minuscule.   Both devices are niche by nature, only the hardcore or the enthusiast will even consider buying one. Of course, I'd love to see it get big and popular and hit mainstream. Maybe that's what Microsoft is trying to do with their device."
gamernews,351v0f,Incrediblebulk92,2,Thu May 7 06:34:51 2015 UTC,"For now the best sign for things to come is that many big tech companies are putting money into it, research, building prototypes, getting close/pushing those out to the market.  This of course doesn't guarantees that VR will finally hit mainstream and that's why Oculus says they are happy there is competition and why they rather have good VR than early VR.  If gen 1, despite the limitations most of these devices will have, make the impact VR has the potential do make, it's going to be big.  This is one of those tech that we can't doubt if it will be useful/fun/interesting. It's just a question if now is the time where the technology allows it to be implemented well enough at around the 200-600$ price bracket.  Microsoft is taking the Augmented Reality road but that's not entirely a different path and I bet one day most devices will integrate both. This is in a way the progression of what they tried (and kind of failed) in terms of UI with the Kinect. Google Glass tried that a bit but didn't go far enough the AR route and ended up as an expensive wearable camera with some HUD-like features.  Personally I'm really excited for this trend of VR/AR rushing to my doorstep and if I where a betting man I would bet that within 5 years it's going to be huge.  VR/AR has failed to be a hit beyond niches several times. I believe the time has come (thanks to the smartphone craze) and certainly can't blame some of the players to want to get it just right."

Interesting but only supported by a minority of games and too expensive/too much hassle for most to bother with. I'm certain that playing Elite, ArmA or Amnesia would be way better with one of these but the problem they face is convincing people to part with new console levels of money for a niece product.   I honestly can't imagine many people are fortunate enough to be able to completely isolate themselves for the world using one of these things. I can't imagine console developers supporting something that draws a lot of processing power away from their games, making them look/run worse while supporting a minority of players.   I hope they do well but I can't see myself buying any VR product anytime soon."
gamernews,351v0f,stayphrosty,8,Thu May 7 20:51:42 2015 UTC,"IMO, if they base ANYTHING on the console market they are going to be sadly disappointed."

gamernews,351v0f,supercouille,3,Wed May 6 20:18:24 2015 UTC,"no, you're not. but if you were you could build a pc for cheaper than the ps4 that runs faster (and gets much more than 15fps in most games). i think the VR experience has the ability to convince a lot of customers to go with PC, but that doesn't mean it has to be exclusive. i can also see a large market for games that will run on low-end machines, or for mods to older games that make the VR experience feel better."
gamernews,351v0f,hobdodgeries,-2,Wed May 6 20:55:09 2015 UTC,"yeah but im not trying to build a pc to put in my living room. I use my console for a shitload more than just trying to play games, and I dont really want a PC to sit in the ent center.  I do agree that it will bring people to pc, and thats cool and whatever, but it doesn't do anything for me. My comp is in my room for indie games/internet/porn, and my console is in the living room for general gaming/netflix/youtube/twitch/general stuff people in my living room are trying to watch.  And there is a market for games that run on low end machines, but visual fidelity is gonna matter somewhat in VR (depending on the game). A PS4 game running at 1080p at 60FPS is going to look MILES better than my pc running a game at 1080p 60FPS.   pc for cheaper   yeah I built my comp in 2008 for about 800 bucks. today it cant run shit. ARMA,PCars, and any AAA game is pretty much never going to run well, and its been doing this for years. At least i spent 400 bucks on something that will atleast run the shit i buy for it for the next decade or however long. Some people have that kind of income. I am pretty damn poverty so it's just not an option. My HD5760 and q8400 will just have to deal with it."

gamernews,351v0f,hobdodgeries,1 point,Thu May 7 00:32:50 2015 UTC,"The problem with getting 60fps on a console with VR is that it's not going to happen. Developers are struggling to hit 60 right now, if they started trying to render 2 different perspectives simultaneously then they'd have some real problems.   Developers are faced with the choice to either expend a lot of effort making the game work in VR and then spend the extra effort to make it work without VR. Or just save the money, time and work more on their game ignoring VR.   The pc is a bit of a different scenario here because it has so much overhead compared to the consoles that you don't have to worry so much about optimizing.

At one point 2 years ago every TV came with free 3D glasses, now it's almost rare. The problems with it were lack of content, it was hassle to the consumer and had a higher price.   I'm not saying that this VR stuff isn't impressive or has applications I just think that it won't be this huge revolution in gaming.   The kinect is in a similar position, very interesting technology that's been used by very few developers and is now not even sold with the Xbox. One of my friends came over recently and hadn't even heard of the kinect. That thing was supposed to be integral to the console at one point."
gamernews,351v0f,zap283,1 point,Thu May 7 06:32:38 2015 UTC,"By 3D I meant 1990-1998 when game designers needed to find how to correctly transition to home consoles with more power allowing for a 3rd dimension. At first, the games were so-so, until certain games paved the way for game mechanics, graphics, etc. Mario64, Metal Gear Solid, Goldeneye shattered what people thought games should be like.  You're right that it will need mass adoption for devs to really pay attention, because multimillion dollar budget games need a chance to succeed. But even then, once people will have adopted, there will be a transition phase: first, most games will have slapped on mechanics; second, some games will be smash hits and make us rethink video games how they are today.  We thought the Wii would do that. We were reluctant with the Kinect. But VR made well is the real deal."

There is a lot more interest in VR and if the price is right, I don't see why it wouldn't sell well based upon the reviews of the dev kits.

gamernews,356dby,owenyorkstudios,1 point,Thu May 7 14:08:11 2015 UTC,"Serious question : Isn't this game free to play now ? Or soon going to be free to play ? I'm not criticizing but a LOT of the new mmo's these days are quicky turning into free to plays because of how little they worked on their game or how little there is to do in it. It's really sad to see my favorite genre of games turning into this, but I'm gonna say that if there is one game I was expecting to turn into free 2 play soon was Elder Scrolls Online, even before the game was out, I saw this coming with the way they treated their customers and shady business decisions like locking an entire stupid all faction race to people who paid a lot more for a game that's not worth half of its initial price ... Just my 2 cents tho, I'm just a random dude on the internet no game company gives a shit anymore since all they care is how to suck your money out of you with as little effort as possible."

It is the first major installment in the Call of Duty video game series.  The game simulates the infantry and combined arms warfare of World War II. The game is based on the Quake III: Team Arena engine. It was accompanied in September 2004 by an expansion pack, Call of Duty: United Offensive, which was produced by Activision, and developed by Gray Matter Interactive, with contributions from Pi Studios. Call of Duty is similar in theme and gameplay to Medal of Honor, as it is made out of single-player campaigns and missions. However, unlike Medal of Honor, the war is seen not just from the viewpoint of an American soldier but also from the viewpoint of British, Canadian, and Soviet soldiers.

Store full of shitty games (/r/shittysteamgames)   GOG has plenty of shitty games too. So does Desura. So does your average brick-and-mortar game store. You're not wrong per se but this isn't a disadvantage of Steam compared to anyone else.   Can't play offline   I play Steam games offline all the time, e.g., on long plane flights. Some functionality goes away but the games work fine. If you look in the menus you'll see a ""Go Offline"" menu item, though usually it auto-detects that I'm not online and just does the right thing.   Stupid pricing (like if there were no exchange rates)  Early access  Pushing preorders as much as possible (they once had a system where number of preorders unlocked features, idk if they do this anymore)   The publishers set prices and decide to offer preorder features. Early access games are also offered by publishers; if a publisher wants to wait until a game is released, Steam doesn't force them to do otherwise. And early access games are clearly marked in the Steam store so you can avoid them easily. You should be upset at publishers about all these things, not Steam."

Store-bought retail games never had this issue but now that more and more games use some form of online DRM (whether it's Steam, Origin, uPlay or something else) we now have no choice.

gamernews,34y0ov,MrTastix,1 point,Wed May 6 01:18:54 2015 UTC,"I just typed out a massive reply to your deleted comment. I'll just post it here (not a flame, don't worry):    Look, I understand the point that you were making. Its just that you initially claimed that   ""It basically says that you don't own what you buy, you are just indefinitely renting them.""   and that is technically true of any game, song, movie, or any other intellectual property you use.  You mentioned the EU, and while I think you are touching on a valid issue, it's not the whole picture. In the EU, and indeed in most states in the US, if the user does not accept the Terms of Use, they are entitled to a refund of the software. If the IP owner changes their Terms of Use at any point after the sale, the user still has the option to refuse and receive a refund. I've never personally seen how Steam handles this, but I have to imagine that they have some kind of nominal process to satisfy their legal obligations, however well hidden it may be. I've worked for a couple developers now, including one that self-published for a while, and believe me when I say that this is a legal issue that does get enforced.  Even in the case of a console game disc, you don't own ""that copy"" in a legal sense. You have the media in hand, but you still only own a limited use license, which can still be (hypothetically) revoked under certain circumstances. The difference is one of enforcement; the rules are more or less the same, but the IP owner is pretty powerless to enforce their terms. This is probably the biggest reason that everything is going to digital distribution. It's not really about convenience; it's all about control.  And this is why Steam does what Steam does: to create a marketplace in which publishers can enforce their IP rights, for better or for worse. The issue entire debate revolves not around what rights you as a user have when you purchase a game, but rather how active the retailer is in enforcing the Terms of Use of your license.  In the case of GoG, they are almost entirely hands-off. That's pretty handy for users, but its not a policy that is going to make them very popular with game publishers. Why does Steam have all the new hit games? Because they made it a very desirable marketplace for publishers."
gamernews,34y0ov,Emberwake,2,Wed May 6 03:38:56 2015 UTC,"GOG has plenty of shitty games too. So does Desura. So does your average brick-and-mortar game store. You're not wrong per se but this isn't a disadvantage of Steam compared to anyone else.   It depends on what you mean by shitty. I wouldn't use the term but the average quality of games between Steam and GoG is not even comparable. GoG curates their library, which Steam stopped doing a long time ago. So although there are plenty of mediocre games on GoG, there is nothing close to Garry's Incident/Slaughtering Grounds levels of bad/broken."

You are using their system and they want to make sure the games attached to your profile are legitimate, which seems sensible to me.    For as much as everyone likes to bitch about DRM too, it comes from a very natural concern.  Software developers are in the awkward spot of making things that they know are being stolen and then any attempt on their part to try and control the legality of their own works' distirbution people get pissed off.    It's one thing to get pissed off at music CDs that intend to install some kind of shit on your computer, I think it's another for a company like Steam to try and find an inobtrusive way to routinely verify the legitimacy of their network.

Micro is what makes RTS games fun in the first place. It's the difference between being actively engaged, and just sitting there watching the game largely play itself through dice rolls and occasional input like you're playing on an Ipad.  Glad to see Eugen learned nothing from Wargame."
gamernews,352gsr,Sedition7988,3,Fri May 8 09:30:59 2015 UTC,It depends on taste. Some people like to micro intensive games like Starcraft and I hate it. I prefer working on the tactics and strategy than micro-ing every single unit at crazy APMs.  To each their own and the current games covers all of us.
gamernews,352gsr,ours,0,Fri May 8 13:09:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of starcraft(At least 2, anyway.), but having an RTS with NO micro like Wargame is just dull, and loses it's allure once the fancy graphics lose their appeal after 8-10 hours and you realize you've got a game with zero depth and substance.  Micro doesn't mean having to incessantly mash hotkeys for build ques rapidly. Micro means an added layer of depth and complexity to both units and structures that makes them more than just 'Move here. Stop. Attack.'. Grey Goo tried that and it was boring as fuck. Planetary Annihilation tried that and it was boring as fuck. Wargame tried it and it was boring as fuck.  Something as simple as properly realised cover mechanics like in Company of Heroes or World in Conflict change the dynamics of gameplay so tremendously. Even the slowest of games like Ultimate General, or Graviteam Tactics insert micro through control of formations, ammo types, etc.  Eugen doesn't believe in that. They believe that packaging a game with the absolute bare minimum of what constitutes an RTS will sell as long as they slap some real world equipment in it and let nationalist have dick measuring contests about wars that never happened.  And there is nothing to suggest they will abruptly change their anti-depth mentality with AoA. With Wargame, they almost went out of their way to remove as much control from the game as possible, so that you could basically put in the bare minimum of inputs and watch the game play itself(often through dice rolls and min-maxing of decks). All three of them came out in short order, and all three of them died insanely fast.  I'm all for making a game accessible to casuals, but this is the RTS genre. If you don't insert something to make the game interesting to enthusiasts or people who want to take the time to learn how to get good at the game, and enjoy high level play, then it will die in months. The casuals will drop it for the next flavor of the month game, and not bother sticking around to potentially learn how to play at higher levels, because there IS no higher level.  There is a reason Starcraft(Both BW and 2) still have a ton of players. There is a reason CoH2 is still alive and well. Complexity equals replayability."
gamernews,352gsr,Sedition7988,1 point,Sat May 9 06:19:33 2015 UTC,Obviously you are not their target audience. This is just like when car racing enthusiasts complain about not having sufficient pit-stops or the correct deceleration (when approaching corners) in Gran Tourismo - the game isn't being made for enthusiasts so don't play it if its not what you want.
gamernews,352gsr,Jiffyrabbit,1 point,Sun May 10 08:08:22 2015 UTC,"That's called being a bad game. You don't go into designing a game around being so shallow that there is almost no replayability as a multiplayer-centric title. That makes no sense. Company of Heroes is an example of an RTS that is aimed at a casual audience, yet maintains depth and replayability, and it's the most played RTS on steam right now."
gamernews,352gsr,Sedition7988,1 point,Sun May 10 17:53:26 2015 UTC,"Yet Starcraft 2, one of the most complex and micro intensive titles is seeing its competitive scene drop off in popularity.   There is a very large portion of the market that doesn't care about micro and just wants to play a game to pass the time. Eugen is targeting that segment, if you don't fall into that category no one is forcing you to play it.  There is a reason that Angry birds is more popular than Company of Heroes."

gamernews,34wg6j,final_Crucible,7,Tue May 5 18:06:36 2015 UTC,"Could be loads of reasons, protecting their intellectual property, wanting to keep things as is, but I figure most importantly is as a blanket statement of ""Anything that's not officially part of the game is not part of the game"".  You get some guys that make some porn mod, it shows up on Fox News as ""Grand Theft Auto has sex scenes in it and Rockstar is doing nothing about it, even allowing it!""  Here they can just say ""Well, it's specifically not allowed in the game.""  Remember how much trouble they got in to with Hot Coffee fiasco, that was a deleted part of the game that required you to mod it to access the files.  It was on disk, yeah, but never intended to be accessed."
gamernews,34wg6j,fatsack,6,Tue May 5 08:14:19 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, a patch that they released on the 30th broke the mods. Based on an assumption, this patch probably also implemented a new process in terms of security measures of how they dealt with mods in general. Just like /u/kinghfb said below, the system was pretty much an all or nothing approach with that update, and they didn't really think it through.  So they basically patched it to shut down the biggest tool to mod, and then begin to implement a system that auto-bans anyone caught using mods. This occurs over a weekend, where customer service is low, resulting in further fan frustration.  So far, we've got no word from any big news venues, nor from Rockstar on the reason why this is happening. My best bet is that this feature is mostly to stop cheating, but something happened that is causing it to spiral out of control. Hopefully, and this is a lot of blind faith there, they will jump in this week and fix this crap with a new patch...because GTA is a huge modding community and there is no reason they would suddenly start this. But until Rockstar makes a statement...all we are going to see is disgruntled people who are being banned and flaming the forums.   Come on Rockstar PR, it's about time you woke up and did some damage control."

They've had a year and a half plus to do this.      Yes technically cheaters are the ones who always ruin it, but PC games generally have pretty good anti-cheat systems in place since like 2005.  Rockstar just got hundreds of millions in funding from the console version to develop one of their own and they just decided to ban modding as a possible solution.  Even a simple DRM game files verification from Rockstar before/during online games would work, you're online anyways."

The other part conspicuously absent from all these discussions are the people who were already using mods to cheat were making the game unplayable for the rest of us. People turning on invincibility, invisibility, making their pistol fire rockets, etc. were beginning to be real problems. That was up until this making free roam basically unplayable.  Why no one is bringing that up to talk about is beyond me."
gamernews,34wg6j,sgamer,3,Tue May 5 18:24:57 2015 UTC,"While you have a point, hackers wouldn't be such a big problem if we actually had real dedicated servers. Not only we'd have admins and moderators to kick / ban people like that, we'd even have servers with no pvp, servers only for racing, servers only for large-scale TDMs, servers for roleplaying.... servers with no explosives... and as in most games, this would really reduce the amount of griefers, or at least enable players to move elsewhere.  I still don't understand how can they justify not making GTA:O with dedicated servers, even if they'd be hosted exclusively by Rockstar. They have the budget, they are high-profile, GTA:O was a huge hit - and yet we got such a shitty, cheap system that ruins any chance of people creating communities and expanding on the base game. It's a shame and even though it's a good game, I was very disappointed when I found out."
gamernews,34wg6j,Hypersapien,2,Tue May 5 18:38:08 2015 UTC,"Because those type of hacks will always be prevalent, and the only way to compete (not ""beat"", mind you) with them is constant updates and exploit patching. Disallowing mods in the EULA doesn't stop these kind of hacks (at ALL), but it does discourage the real mod-makers from wanting to work on the game with anything big, as it can get C&D'ed off the net at any time. With this being GTA V, people will still make mods anyway, but I doubt you'll see any extensive total conversions until this game is basically abandonware."

Granted rape is a terrible thing but you are still killing people in multiple ways, using/trading black market items, stealing (Grand THEFT Auto), etc. This game is meant to be as offensive and ""real"" as possible. It seems interesting that the line is being drawn at rape.  But I guess a community of people who will divulge in the humor of their sick fantasies could open up GTAV to other modding taboos such as introducing killable children or the ability to fuck chickens. Now I think that while it shouldn't be something that is forced on others like in this instance in multiplayer games: why can't people have the ability to freely express themselves in what ever way they want in their own single player sessions? What happens in GTA, stays in GTA."

You're only ever put in a position to hate the guys who clean up your messes.  Rape, on the other hand, is always personal.  You have to portray both sides of it to get something you could call ""effective"" or ""entertaining"" (if you're into that kind of thing).

gamernews,34yj4n,GerbilGrenade22,3,Tue May 5 18:22:42 2015 UTC,My opinion is:  The nostalgia in me says they have a chance.  The programmer in me says it looks like late xbox early xbox360 graphics right now from screen shots which will negatively impact it a lot.  Objectives and missions with online coop is a plus; hopefully there is also online/coop free roam.  Seems they will have character leveling which is a plus. Feed in getting better at skills (grinding for skills anyone? :P) with unlocking looks and maybe a customizable character and it could take off.  So; final outlook with 1 source as of yet is slightly optimistic with hopes that they add something new to the franchise without ruining what was good about the old ones.

It needed to stay quiet for a fair while longer - it needed time for people to forget the shit that Activision put out, and just remember what made the series great. THPS4 had some of the best mechanics, (I personally love Underground more, but that's more nostalgia for me than anything) and nothing else has really hit that high bar since.  I'm probably going to be a bit of a buzzkill, but they should have waited at least another year maybe even more, and dedicated the majority of the effort into the PS4/X1 versions - if they get the install base they need with the consoles.  It's too soon. People still remember how anemic Tony Hawk HD felt, as well as the pillaging the series felt up until RIDE."

gamernews,34uj9z,FamousAspect,110,Mon May 4 17:57:20 2015 UTC,I think I'll just wait for the GOTY edition.  I don't feel like paying $40 for DLC on release.
gamernews,34uj9z,SaulKD,34,Mon May 4 18:49:31 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, gamers keep showing WB, Ubisoft, EA etc. that season passes and DLCs are great even at $40."
gamernews,34uj9z,gamerqc,11,Mon May 4 19:00:03 2015 UTC,"I'm totally fine with this model for single player games as long as they later release all the content at a reasonable price. I don't see anything wrong with companies initially profiting off the first wave of consumers with more disposable income, and then selling to the more thrifty buyers in a reasonable time frame.   WB has a pretty solid track record of releasing a GOTY edition for half the price of the launch edition, with everything included, less than a year after the original launch date. GOTY Arkham games are often in Steam sales for $5-15. Last weekend I picked up Shadow of Mordor with a season pass for $25, and that game is only 7 months old. Originally it was $50 + $40 for the season pass."
gamernews,34uj9z,oaklandnative,2,Tue May 5 01:56:45 2015 UTC,I like your explanation.

I am lucky enough to have a job I enjoy that lets me get that money. I was not a dick or bragging in my post, yet I still got the kneejerk downvotes (at the time I wrote this). I kind of expected better from /r/gamernews, this isn't /r/gaming. I know that's not what you guys wanna hear but some people simply don't mind paying for stuff at a higher price to get it early. There is no revolution on the way where people are going to vote with their wallets in order to force publishers to put things out at a lower price. Sorry I can't join in the party of complaining about dlc costing money (or dlc's existing). Hell if anything I should be part of it since in NZ our game prices are way higher than the US."

Yes, it is my money, but because I can afford such things, I also know that I have a social responsibility for conscientious consumerism.  I choose which big box stores not to shop at, which foods I support and not support, and how I want to support the game community.  Besides, I don't miss out on the ""newest thing"" as I'm buying GOTY editions a year later and playing through those when the new games and DLC come out.  ~Dismounts from tall pony~"

Besides, I don't miss out on the ""newest thing"" as I'm buying GOTY editions a year later and playing through those when the new games and DLC come out.   Well... that's isn't that literally what missing out on the newest thing means? Getting it a year later means it is not the newest any more by definition.   It doesn't mean anything to most people since the game stays the same one year later, but I like playing things as they are released since I'm a bit of a graphics/animation nerd and a casual game developer so I like to absorb stuff early. I also kinda enjoy what people like and don't like about a game on places like reddit. And those types of comments and discussion only last a few months after a game is released. If I want understand those threads then a year later doesn't work for me."

The obvious inference here is: monkeyjay can also afford these things. monkeyjay has a similar social responsibility but is shirking that responsibility.  I don't understand how this doesn't imply that other people have a similar social responsibility.

So you don't pay because you have a social responsibility for conscientious consumerism. It was not much of a leap to say that because I'm doing the opposite of what you do you're implying that I don't have the principles you have regarding a social conscience (my shorthand for your exact words, I don't think that was too far off).

gamernews,34uj9z,rayzorium,0,Tue May 5 04:08:54 2015 UTC,"On principle, what's wrong with making new content down the line and charging for it?  And offering to sell it at a discount if you prepurchase?   Like what's so disgusting about it?"
gamernews,34uj9z,ReservoirDog316,5,Tue May 5 04:07:54 2015 UTC,"Nothing.   But there is a gigantic spectrum of DLC.  There is DLC that is already developed and put on the disc, which you have to pay to unlock. To me, that's bullshit.  There is pre-order DLC, which I also think is bullshit.  You don't have to look far for DLC that is bullshit. And frankly, when a game publisher makes hundreds of millions of dollars in profits, sometimes DLC feels like bullshit.  Of course, then there are games like Minecraft that charge a flat rate and continually update their game."
gamernews,34uj9z,TheKrakenArises,0,Tue May 5 04:45:56 2015 UTC,"On disc DLC is of course pretty bad.  That locks you out of a lot of choices cause it obviously made it in time to make it on the disc.    But preordering DLC at a discount?  What's so bad about that?  Nothing's forcing you to not get the individual DLC at the individual price.  But if you're already planning on getting all of them (for whatever reason), what's so bad about it?    Honestly though, most DLC sucks anyways.  I've only been truly satisfied by Bethesda DLC, Red Dead Redemption's DLC, GTA IV's DLC, Dark Soul's DLC and that's about it really.  For the most part, it always feels limited in scope and like the non voiced side quests in JRPGs.  So much of a fuss is kicked up over this stuff. At least the Batgirl DLC sounds pretty fleshed out (and being released a very far chunk of time after release) but gamers pick this one to get mad at for some reason."

And the vote is clear, $60 is an acceptable release price and more content down the road at an extra 50% is also fine. It's not high or low, it's just... fine. You shouldn't have to apologize for anything. Whoever is suggesting to ""vote with their wallets"" actually implies a community-wide boycott to bring the prices down, which is clearly not going to happen."
gamernews,34uj9z,vexos,2,Tue May 5 00:47:47 2015 UTC,Yeah I totally agree (sorry for comment that is essentially an upvote).
gamernews,34uj9z,monkeyjay,5,Tue May 5 00:53:24 2015 UTC,"This statement is about as vapid as ""the more you spend, the more you save"".   How so? In that case saying ""I'd rather wait a year and spend less"" is just as vapid since it's the exact same phrase. But for some reason when someone says that everyone is fine with it.    When I buy a game, I want to feel like someone wanted to sell me a game. I don't want to feel like someone wanted to take my $60.   Okay, that's fine. Then don't feel that way. I don't. It's just the necessary exchange for getting what I want when I want it.   What is the difference to you between ""being sold a game"" and ""someone wanting $60""? What does that look like? Do you only know after you buy the game? does it matter if you like the game or not?"
gamernews,34uj9z,monkeyjay,3,Mon May 4 23:52:46 2015 UTC,"To me it's like how some places sell alcohol, like at some big clubs or fancy hotels. They will have a selection of $1k bottles of vodka or wine. Some of these may be able to live up to their cost but many are just expensive to be expensive. They are no better than the mid price range ones but people will buy them because they have the money and want to buy ""the good stuff"".  While you are not shelling out $1k for a bottle of vodka you are paying $100 or more for what should be $60~ as we have come accustom to and can still buy plenty of complete games full of content without buying DLC or pre-ordering.  Maybe you don't care and that is fine but if you want to subscribe yourself to that logic remember this next time you want something that is too expensive that may be priced higher than it should stadium/event food, printer ink, internet, designer bag? Whatever it is there are people that have money for it and won't think twice to throw down the cash keeping said prices inflated for everyone else.  Cheers"
gamernews,34uj9z,fish_slap_republic,1 point,Tue May 5 00:04:35 2015 UTC,"Actually games should be $90-$100. Development costs have risen, but prices have decreased from the 90s and early 00s, and that's on top of inflation."
gamernews,34uj9z,ceol_,1 point,Tue May 5 01:23:51 2015 UTC,"No, professional software cost no where near blockbuster games to make but can set you back $300+ to buy. This is because there is a need for the product but the market is small so they have to charge a lot to make up for the development costs.  While development cost have increased so have the amount sold making up for the high costs.  If games NEEDED to be $90-100 then they would cost that much or all these game companies would go under for selling their games at $50-60 and are just as big as these games wanting you to shell out $100 some of it before the game is even out just so you can have a full game."
gamernews,34uj9z,fish_slap_republic,1 point,Tue May 5 16:26:40 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not being coy. It sounds like you're using flowery language without a point. Which is exactly why I asked you to clarify. Should be easy if you are calling me out for not understanding it. If the game is just as good either way then $60 is $60. The only one missing out is the person not playing it (unless they don't like the game then it doesn't matter what it 'feels' like to buy it).   At what point does a game publisher ""sell"" you anything? I don't go into a store and haggle with the clerk. Hell, I don't even go into a store. I look at some gameplay videos and if I like it I go onto steam or to a site and download it/get it delivered for the same price it's been for the last 20 years. As for DLC it's slightly different because there is content that isn't part of the 'base game' for whatever reason. It would be lovely if it was free, but it would be even lovelier if the whole game was free too, so why not just wish that? I never even said I was going to get this particular dlc at all, or that I was excited to. I was responding to the comment that said ""gamers show publishers that $40 season pass is fine"" in a condescending tone (that I'm sure I didn't imagine but I might have). It's true. I do show that with the money I spend because I want things early and I don't see my demographic should be condescended to because they aren't in an uproar about paying money for things.   If I'm literally asking you to clarify and you respond by not answering and then putting words in my mouth then I dunno what I'm getting out of this."
gamernews,34uj9z,monkeyjay,3,Tue May 5 17:03:57 2015 UTC,"If you think it's fair for me to pay an extra $20-30 got games like GTA or Borderlands just because I live in NZ/AU then you can go fuck yourself.  The fact that the minimum wage is higher means shit when you're paying more to live. Minimum wage here is set at $14.75/hr, after tax you'll be getting about $500 a week.  It's fine if you're living in a cheap ass ghetto by yourself but if you've got even one kid the prices go up exponentially, just as they do anywhere else. I'm not saying we have it worse but we have it relative to any other country yet we still have to pay more for video games.  As someone with a student loan I can't even afford to live in my own house where I live. I had to end up flatting just to pay the bills. It's not the cost of living that's the problem, it's the fact it's the same relative to any other country yet we pay more for entertainment."
gamernews,34uj9z,MrTastix,1 point,Tue May 5 01:49:48 2015 UTC,"We 100% do not get it cheaper than north americans as almost any percentage of median income that you want to use. The price point was set years ago when the NZ dollar was about 40% of the USD. Now the NZ dollar is about 75% of the USD and the price of games hasn't moved.   New release games here are $75 US. Sometimes a few dollars less. Sometimes 20% more than that. http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=United+States&country2=New+Zealand  So our cost of living is higher, our game prices are higher, and our median wage is lower.

If it can run without Arkham Knight, then no problem -- probably unlikely since that doesn't help to incentivize users to sign up for the season pass. Granted it's not a simple character swap, but it seems a bit strange to require buying a male-lead game if you only want to play the female-lead story.

gamernews,34uj9z,ukiyoe,4,Mon May 4 19:23:53 2015 UTC,"On average, male leads dominate the spot for the protagonist in video games. If there is a female option, uncommonly it's paid DLC. This extends to other races as well, not just gender. In the linked podcast, a 12 year-old girl did her own research, and some free to play games required her to play for dozens of hours before she could play as an avatar she could relate to.    There's an easy solution, and that would be to make it a standalone game like what Naughty Dog did for The Last of Us.    I'm a privileged white male so I can't personally relate, but since DC is trying so hard to bring in the female audience lately (they recently announced a new female heroes only cartoon series), you'd think they'd lower the bar of entry for female gamers. But then again, their main incentive is to add value to the DLC season pass for the existing die-hard fans, so there's a conflict of interest. They are separate teams after all!"

That was one of my major gripes with Arkham City. Night Wing and Robin seemed cool when I got to play them in the challenge missions, but there wasn't really much of a reward for those missions and I spent most of my time playing in the actual game, where they were completely inaccessible, so I didn't really get to do that much with them."

He doesn't really have any glide-y gadgets like Batman does. I'd rather anything with him be very self-contained so it would work for him.  Robin might work a little better than Nightwing, and it would be cool to add that, but it might also feel too same-y to Batman to really be worth the extra effort."
gamernews,34uj9z,EpsilonRose,1 point,Tue May 5 06:28:57 2015 UTC,"Nightwing could have some parkour mechanics or a more rapid-fire grappling system and from what I remember of Robin he was pretty different in play-style and gadget selection.

gamernews,34uj9z,Zephs,1 point,Tue May 5 06:40:30 2015 UTC,"Parkour would either be the same as Catwoman's, or feel like an Assassin's Creed ripoff.

gamernews,34uj9z,EpsilonRose,1 point,Mon May 4 21:46:16 2015 UTC,"...With how many versions of every character there has been, I don't think that phrase has any meaning beyond wild deviations like ""Now Nightwing has a tommygun.""

gamernews,34uj9z,Zephs,1 point,Mon May 4 21:28:32 2015 UTC,"It's something Batman invents in the far future. It still needs the glide-y wings to help direct it, which Nightwing's costume doesn't have. You might not care, but I'd bet a lot of the people that would want to play as Nightwing would rather he not be included than be added ""wrongly"", and I think one of the things that makes the Arkham games a success is not straying too far from the source material."

Oh, but don't make her invincible or too powerful, because that means women need an unfair advantage, and that's sexist. But be sure that she never shows any weakness or vulnerability, because that's triggering. Oh, and, If, at any point, she needs a man's help to do anything, then that's ""damseling"", and promotes patriarchy. And they had better change that costume. Her tight leather outfit has a ""dom fetish"" look to it that entices the men to attack her because ""she looks like she wants it,"" and that perpetuates rape culture. Overall, Batgirl is just being used as a ""fighting fucktoy"" fantasy for a bunch of white, cis, dudebros to have a circle-jerk to. It's disgusting."

The fact that we haven't seen any other batgirls besides Barbara doesn't mean jack-- we hadn't seen any signs of Jason Todd prior to City, but we still got the third Robin as opposed to the second.

gamernews,34v2y6,Anzai,5,Tue May 5 07:22:51 2015 UTC,"I want to give them an element of the doubt. I really do. For example, 12 maps may not be too bad, if the maps are HUGE, with a variety of different objectives and challenges and vastly varying terrain. Like, a Hoth map could feature a large open battlefield, as well as mountains and even frozen caves to fight in. And if the map is as big or larger than Battlefield 2 maps? It might be OK if they release just 12 maps like that. But if the maps are tiny, and vehicles are on rails? Meh.  Still, the game will sell insanely well. Between Star Wars fans, DICE fanboys and just really fucking stupid people who don't even try to get value for their money, it'll sell like hotcakes."
gamernews,34v2y6,Sabbathius,2,Tue May 5 13:03:21 2015 UTC,The game can still be very good. We'll find out at release.
gamernews,34v2y6,thepulloutmethod,3,Tue May 5 19:58:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm thinking if they absolutely nail the ambiance, feel and pace, it could be quite nice, even with limited kit selection and few maps. Though I still can't help but think that at that price point it'll still be a bit of a ripoff. Not even a single player campaign, just multiplayer with 12 maps? For a AAA price. And I bet they'll release a season pass for another $40 for a buttload of stuff, and other DLCs. Though this is really a separate discussion, gamers being unwise with their money."
gamernews,34v2y6,Sabbathius,1 point,Tue May 5 20:18:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I totally sympathize with the concerns.  I'm just hoping against hope that the game will turn out good.

gamernews,34v2y6,thepulloutmethod,1 point,Tue May 5 20:21:19 2015 UTC,"I honestly feel like they cannot screw this game up. Battlefront II is a great game, I'll give you that, but it's just a decent shooter with a Star Wars theme masked over it.   DICE knows how to make a great shooter and then having it as a Star Wars game will make it even better than it already is."
gamernews,34v2y6,HappyBull,3,Wed May 6 02:44:14 2015 UTC,"Thing is, they can't just re-skin Battlefield 3, for example. Consider things like going prone, crawling around, etc? Doesn't really work when you are an Imperial trooper dressed all in white. I don't think they can even tilt their head up so much in one of those helmets when prone to even look around. It'll look pretty ridiculous. And while it'll be easy for them to hide on Hoth, on a green jungle planet they stand out like sore thumb.  Next, in BF, you can get shot from pretty much everywhere, and others may not know exactly where fire is coming from. But in SW, that would mean lasers, where every round behaves like a tracer. So you immediately know where shots are coming from. Etc.   I don't know, I think they could end up with a really lukewarm shooter. It'll be pretty yes, but gameplay could be pretty mediocre. I would definitely recommend waiting for a beta or full reviews before giving them any money."

gamernews,34v2y6,HappyBull,1 point,Fri May 8 18:58:44 2015 UTC,I gotta say that's definitely a matter of a minority opinion. I loved the space battles and a lot of other people consistently say the same thing. Of course it could be better but you can't have an intricate 3rd person shooter combined with rogue leader quality dog fighting. Something's gotta be sacrificed and I think the space battles being a little bland is a better alternative than the ground fights sucking.
gamernews,34v2y6,Fox436,1 point,Fri May 8 19:06:59 2015 UTC,"Why are you assuming that the dog fights will suck? Why can't the game both have great ground and sky battles?? I imagine a game where the ground battles and sky battles are separate modes but both just as refined and intuitive as the other. No space necessary. Why are you assuming dog fights on land are going to stink? They'll be hell of a lot funner than past games I'm certain because of today's graphics, quality, and gameplay standards."
gamernews,34v2y6,HappyBull,1 point,Fri May 8 19:59:59 2015 UTC,I didn't assume anything. I'm simply stating that the lack of space in a sci-fi series named STAR wars is kinda idiotic.

gamernews,34j8m5,SuiXi3D,79,Sat May 2 14:20:22 2015 UTC,"Platform games were great in 2d and rarely worth a damn in 3d with the exception of Mario 64 (a launch title) and maybe a couple others in the early days (N64 and PS1-ish era).  Banjo-Kazooie had very solid controls, good visuals, entertaining writing, a large world and for many was a game they played extensively as a kid because they had an N64.  It was exceedingly well made and fun. We haven't seen many other 3d platformers that are at that level of quality since (though they do exist) and since Rare got bought by Microsoft and now tends to make Kinect games we aren't likely to see another Banjo game outside of this spiritual successor and the world is a little bit more gray as a result."

gamernews,34j8m5,Holyrapid,3,Sat May 2 02:46:15 2015 UTC,Very well put. I think 3d was pushed on gaming way too soon. I wish we had more 32/64-bit 2d masterpieces like Castlevania Symphony of the Night. It really shows how beautiful games could have been that generation.
gamernews,34j8m5,doooom,17,Sat May 2 04:34:53 2015 UTC,"If you can't get your hands on Banjo Kazooie for one reason or another  but are still interested in some solid 3D platformer Collectathons I have a few suggestions:   Ratchet and Clank. This is my personal favorite 3D platformer and if you're interested I can give you a rundown of which titles in the series are best to jump into and which to avoid. Jak and Daxter. Solid platforming, but bad gunplay (something Ratchet and Clank does loads better). Still a great series, worth jumping into any of the 3 main games. Sly Cooper. I haven't payed much of this series but what little I have is very solid and it's highly recommended. Super Mario 64, Sunshine, and Galaxies 1 & 2. You really can't go wrong with any of these. Sunshine gets some hate and while it's the weakest of the 3D Mario Platformers it is still better than most of it's competition outside of it's own franchise. Rayman 2. All the main Rayman titles are excellent but only Rayman 2 and 3 are 3D platformers. Rayman 2 is one of the best 3D platformers I've ever played and a personal favorite. Psychonauts. Not as solid on a technical level as the others listed here, but probably the easiest game to come by on this list and thematically awesome.    There are plenty of others i didn't mention due to me not having much experience with them (Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, Croc, etc.) but most of these titles are available in HD collections or as downloadable titles."
gamernews,34j8m5,pixel_illustrator,12,Fri May 1 18:30:13 2015 UTC,I have to disagree with you on Sunshine being the weakest of the 3D Marios.  I think it's actually my 2nd favorite after Mario 64 due to it actually having a hub world and some deeper platforming mechanics.  If I had to pick a weakest one it would probably be Galaxy 2 or 3D World if you're counting that one.  They just felt like level packs to me and not a cohesive adventure.
gamernews,34j8m5,I_LIKE_VIDEO_GAEMZ,2,Fri May 1 18:27:27 2015 UTC,Yeah for me the biggest turn off in a play former is lack of camera controls. M64 and Sunshine had true third person camera the entire game and I honestly think that's what makes the gameplay feel better than Galaxy.  The hub world is just as important to me as well.
gamernews,34j8m5,CoolGuySean,3,Fri May 1 20:30:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you for taking the time to post such a complete answer.  I have always been willing to play Ratchet & Clank, are there any good ones of Playstation 2 ? . As for Psychonauts, I have heard a lot of good things about it, I may give it a go."
gamernews,34j8m5,mrmodeste2,5,Sat May 2 01:16:52 2015 UTC,"Some people would argue that the only good R&C games are for PS2 haha! R&C1 is a good platformer but lacks the gunplay that would make the series so iconic. R&C2 has the guns but the controls are strange (they aren't bad, but they are weird in comparison to most shooter controls) and R&C3 has very accessible gun controls but is (IMO) not as strong a title as R&C2. They are all very good games though and you can't really go wrong with them. R&C Deadlocked is supposed to be very good as well but I can't personally vouch for it and its far heavier on the shooter side of things than platforming. All of these titles were originally made available for PS2 but can also be found on PS3.  Psychonauts is very good but as I said, it's a little sloppy in some parts. It has some issues with stuff like level geometry which is going to have you sliding off platforms and falling through floors, but it's not usually so bad that it gets in the way. The only exception to that is the final stage/boss which is very poorly put together and can be absolutely infuriating, but the game is still very good and you can pretty much download it on anything for very cheap."

This is my personal favorite 3D platformer and if you're interested I can give you a rundown of which titles in the series are best to jump into and which to avoid.   Let me guess...  Ratchet 1,2,3, and Deadlocked are a ""Yes"", while The PS3 ""Future tools"" games are hit or miss, and everything past that is shit right?  I fucking loooooove me some Ratchet, with Deadlocked being my favorite (The arena challenges, sooooo goooood) I cant think of another series that has consistently taken each previous game, expanded on it, and then made it better for the next game (Except maybe Crash 1-3)"
gamernews,34j8m5,Draffut_,1 point,Sat May 2 08:26:10 2015 UTC,"Pretty close. I agree on 1,2, and 3, I have not yet played Deadlocked (or any of the PSP titles). Though in my opinion the crown jewel of R&C is A Crack in Time. Best story, best gameplay, best graphics, only thing that it get's overshadowed on is replayability/content. Otherwise flawless, second best game is R&C 2. The worst game in the series is by far Tools of Destruction, which is not just a bad R&C title but a straight up bad game with loads of lazy ass game design and monotonous, overused bullshit (I'm looking at you poorly designed enemy waves in a shooting gallery with infinite health/ammo regen kiosks for the player).  For what it's worth, while it's not great, I don't hate All 4 One if only for the fact that it's decently fun in couch co-op. That shitty MOBA title can get the fuck out though.  Haven't played Into the Nexus yet either but planning on it. You mentioning Deadlocked has reminded me I need to get my hands on it and finally give it a go since you are not the first person that has told me of how great it is."
gamernews,34j8m5,pixel_illustrator,0,Fri May 1 18:53:43 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that the characters of ratchet and clank have been degrading. Not the story as crack in time has an amazing one but the characters themselves. Ratchet has mellowed out a lot, so much so that he takes the empathetic role that clank used to fill in the old games. You can see how everyone is extremely forgiving and empathetic to a fault. Everyone has to be friends especially in all 4 one and into the nexus. Nefarious wanting to be a part of friends made me angry. I think it cheapened his character is happens with ratchet in nexus when he confronts one of the the antagonists. I want to see some emotion in these characters again instead of every interaction being understanding. When was the last time ratchet blew up on someone. He did this all the time in the ps2 games but I can't think of him doing it since then. These games are trying to hard to focus on a younger audience and its losing quality because of it.   Also one more pet peeve, can we stop with having the same 3 weapons in every game. Everygame used to have a new gun pool but how many games has the combuster, groovatron, warmongerer, mister zurkon, and judicator been in."

Banjo-Kazooie isn't any less grinding in this regard, it was just much more original for the time and it has much more charm than say Assassin's Creed. The gameplay is fundamentally the same but the world and the characters is what set it apart. Same reason people don't give two shits if Nintendo does the same old tired gig."

gamernews,34j8m5,lud1120,4,Sat May 2 08:13:07 2015 UTC,It might seem like nothing but to me there is a HUGE difference between 2D and 3D platformers. 3D worlds have always felt so much more open-ended and you get to explore them at your own discretion. 2D platformers almost always felt like on-rail games to me.  I'm way more partial to 3D platformers that let you explore.  There are however 3D platformers that feel very on-rail anyway. Like Mario Galaxy 2.  MG2 has all the assets of an amazing platformer but restricts your camera controls and has a set path you need to follow which kind of infuriates me!

It doesn't feel the same no, but there's so little we have seen so far. A clumsy bear and a sarcastic bird is quite a bit more charming; but the developers want it to be as new and fresh as possible. No matter what this is just the first attempt the ex-Rare crew will make, and i'm sure more will come from them even if this game wouldn't be as successful as hoped.  Our nostalgia should not make us force them to not try out new things.  A female chameleon and a male bat isn't bad in any way, but I'd still like a backpack or something. We'll see how the development goes after this. A feathered bird or  dinosaur might be cuter for me."

Frankly, there's nothing too inspiring about a bear and a bird that wear clothes and travel together. What made them great was their personalities and the gameplay. We continue to think they're great because we loved them as children and had Yooka-Laylee came out when we were 10 or 12 we'd probably think the same of them, too.  The reason I see them as placeholders is because they cannot legally use the name Banjo-Kazooie. It is a spiritual successor for the same reason BioShock was: Legal bullshit."

Development of article  Banjo-Kazooie:       Banjo-Kazooie was developed by the same team that developed Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest.  Development of the game began in late 1995 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System under the project name Dream and used Rare's ""ACM"" (Advanced Computer Modeling) graphics technology, first used in Donkey Kong Country, to a very advanced level.  Dream was originally suggested as an adventure game that starred a boy named Edison, who owned a wooden sword and got into trouble with a group of pirates led by a captain named Blackeye.  However, Edison was eventually replaced as Rare felt he was ""too generic"".  The developers first tried with a rabbit and later a bear, who became Banjo.

Bug fixes and slow patches came out, so it became in a somewhat playable state. Now Act 2 is out and the game is complete, hopefully everything is buttery smooth. Although I haven't checked if that is the case."

How it feels and how the music plays a role in the game that would be awesome. It looks really neat. I'm not a big fan of that style of music but if it's integrated properly I don't think that'll matter. I enjoyed the designs and feel of that trailer!

Deep Silver wanted more of the same from Dead Island 2, Techland had some ideas they wanted to implement into their next Zombie game, which would change the focus of the brand, as a result they parted ways. And funnily enough, now Deep Silver has too change Dead Island 2, because Techland gave people too much with Dying Light, and if Dead Island 2 would get released as simply Dead Island, but bigger, they would struggle to sell the game. It's really funny when you think about this. They gave up on ideas that became successful title, now they are forced to rework their own game because of that."

It all comes down to personal choice so I'm not trying to invalidate your opinion, but I've been playing games for 15 years so everything started to feel the same to me after a certain point. Something like Spec Ops was a breath of fresh air and was truly memorable.   Sure I'd have more ""fun"" playing a CoD game, but I wouldn't be able to tell you a single thing that happened in a CoD campaign because its all so samey and forgettable for me by now."
gamernews,34f3vi,silverside30,-8,Thu Apr 30 20:19:57 2015 UTC,"I'd much rather have a fresh concept or something subversive than a ""fun"" but standard shooter.   But Spec Op's isn't fresh. In fact it doesn't even try to be. It's story (and you could argue gameplay details) might be subversive but that's it. It's exactly as by the books a TPS as CoD is an FPS.   Sure I'd have more ""fun"" playing a CoD game, but I wouldn't be able to tell you a single thing that happened in a CoD campaign because its all so samey and forgettable for me by now.   But those aren't the only two options. A well made game that subverts expectations is entirely possible. Spec Op's is not that. Spec Ops is a poorly made cookie cutter of a game (even if the claim is it was poorly made on purpose) with a subversive story line. CoD is also a cookie cutter template but it is well polished. I don't actually enjoy either title very much, but at least most CoD fans are aware of the fact that it's not a unique series, just big budget. Spec Ops fans tend to be convinced that the game is without flaw and the gold standard by which to judge ""ludo-narrative"" experiences, and that is just laughable if you ask me."
gamernews,34f3vi,pixel_illustrator,7,Thu Apr 30 20:28:14 2015 UTC,"From a gameplay perspective, yes, I totally agree. It is not fresh at all. But what it offered was a fresh experience. And that's what I want. I don't care if the gameplay is like other games I've played if it does something exciting with its story, message, themes, art style, etc.   Don't get me wrong, if the gameplay was amazing and fresh too, it would be a better game for it. And I'm not the kind of person to say the game is without fault, but for me, I appreciate a strong creative vision more than anything else. Sometimes if one area of a game is amazing it can make up for other areas that aren't as good.  If games want to be taken seriously as works of art, they need to have messages behind them rather than being fun ""products."" Which isn't to say all games need to try to be works of art. After all, blockbuster superhero movies don't go away because arthouse movies exist. There is always a place for all kinds of games. All I'm saying is that for me, I've been playing games for so long that I'm always looking out for stuff that at least tries to do things differently."
gamernews,34f3vi,silverside30,-3,Thu Apr 30 20:44:34 2015 UTC,"I can respect your reasoning (even if I disagree) until this:   If games want to be taken seriously as works of art, they need to have messages behind them rather than being fun ""products."" Which isn't to say all games need to try to be works of art.   No. They don't need to do anything to be taken seriously actually. They don't even have to do anything they haven't already been doing to be considered art. If you don't think games were art to begin with (as so many people seem to agree on) then your feelings on what art is and isn't are mired in some kind of outside ruling. There's an argument that some games are higher art than others, sure, but no game released, no matter how badly made, how base in it's gameplay or themes, is distinctly not art (unless I suppose it's a shameless reproduction of existing art/games... that would be the exception I can think of).   All I'm saying is that for me, I've been playing games for so long that I'm always looking out for stuff that at least tries to do things differently.   I'd agree with this, I am tired as hell of most AAA titles (especially shooters) myself having played them for 2 decades, and the result is my tastes require something different to hold my attention that what is offered by the status quo of AAA. What I don't agree with in regards to Spec Op's (and this is not necessarily pointed at you but in broader terms) is that some how the story is what we need to be focusing on in games to ""legitimize"" them or to set them apart. There are far more and greater opportunities for unique gameplay in games than there is story in games."
gamernews,34f3vi,pixel_illustrator,2,Thu Apr 30 20:52:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think I worded that a little too strongly. The topic of ""games as art"" is a whole other, huge discussion. Games have always been art, I agree. It brings up the question of ""What is art?""   At the most basic level, I think art would be anything that people create that exists solely to exist without a ""use value."" But then there's the question of what is ""good art."" Cave paintings are art, just as a modern sculpture is art. But if someone today released a modern equivalent of cave painting (i.e. stick figures with spears chasing a crudely drawn mammoth) to the art community, would it be considered good art? I don't think so. It's all about context and the idea of pushing the medium forward.   So while I'd say Pong is a work of art because it was the best we could do with interactive video graphics at the time, we have since pushed the medium forward. If someone put out a Pong-like game today, it would technically be a piece of art, but we probably wouldn't consider it ""good art.""   Obviously this whole topic is completely subjective. Artistic measure comes down to personal and aesthetic preferences. But for me, I seek out the ""new"" in games because that's what I feel is propelling the medium forward. I absolutely loved that Spec Ops had a self-reflective story that makes the player question their own actions. It was a fresh take on what stories can do in the shooter genre. It generated HUGE amounts of discussion online and is mentioned as an inspiration among some developers. It may not have had great gameplay, but it had a MESSAGE.   It definitely isn't for everyone. Obviously the message didn't resonate with you, and that's fine. But the way I look at it is, at least it's doing something fresh. The very fact that we are having this discussion now is a sign that it's causing people to think about what games are and what they should be."
gamernews,34f3vi,silverside30,3,Thu Apr 30 21:13:18 2015 UTC,"Totally agreed. IMO the game doesn't stand on it's own merit without the ""gotcha"", and is not worth the time spent to get to it. Might as well just play any other shooter and have someone tell you how guilty you should feel about it.  I'm not even against the message, it's a worthwhile thought. It's just the execution that makes it a tacked-on trollish ""lol u thought this was the game"" type of thing, when I'd really just like a game with solid mechanics. It's just kind of condescending when I think most well adjusted people think about this stuff anyway."

But yeah, the only thing the game has going for it is the guilt tripping, and that falls apart when you examine the ""choice"" you made and realize you never actually made it. The ""decision"" to not continue playing the game is one the game can never acknowledge, and by the games logic all the people that never played it are biggest winners (heh, I actually agree with that, but not for the same reasons.)"

I personally don't experience many problems with my self-assembled PC, but even I ran into numerous issues with Dead Island. For example, there was a high pitch whine that I wasn't able to solve, and I tried multiple approaches: on-board sound, dedicated sound card, another dedicated sound card that was built into the headphones. None of it worked. The controls were also wonky with the mouse acceleration. That was fixable, if you were willing to work with it though.  So, out of the box, Dead Island on PC was actually a pretty awful product, as a whole. And, to the best of my knowledge, they never addressed or patched these issues out. And there was a ton of glitches in the game itself.  So I totally get why a lot of people are down on that game. The game itself was decent, though not earth-shattering.

Maybe try playing some older games. The camera follows the player way too much- there needs to be a bit of ""spring"" to the way it moves to cut down on harsh movement."

If you remember, the original Assassin's Creed looked amazing and built a lot of hype, then disappointed on release. It was with the second entry that the series really came into its own. Hopefully this is the same pattern Watch Dogs will follow"
gamernews,34f48c,Veritasgear,1 point,Fri May 1 16:57:12 2015 UTC,Ubisoft is really good about listening to what their customers want in games. The next Far Cry will supposedly be based upon a public poll that was done right after 4 was released. I'm optimistic about what they can do with WD2.

gamernews,34f48c,Camulus,1 point,Fri May 1 10:14:20 2015 UTC,They announced that they had two more games planned after Watch Dogs. I haven't played the first but I think I will when I can get it for dirt cheap.   Would it be worth $20 to play it on PS4? I love open world games and parts of Watch Dogs intrigue me. Mostly the vigilante encounters in the world.

At best it's going to be closer to what was originally promised, or even exactly what people were expecting the first time. But considering that a lot of people were already burned, it's going to do worse, isn't it? People who bought the first one at launch are hardly going to buy it again with the risk of another disappointment."
gamernews,34f48c,Veritasgear,1 point,Fri May 1 13:57:57 2015 UTC,"Ubisoft, though somewhat souless, is still on of the better companies at listening to what their customer base wants. I assume that they will have learned from the many mistakes of the first, not to mention will likely change the location and add some cool new features. I didn't hate the first game, so while I am not going to preorder, I think I will remain optimistic about a sequel."
gamernews,34f48c,Anzai,1 point,Sat May 2 15:18:23 2015 UTC,"I don't hate the first one either, I'm actually playing through it now, albeit slowly. But why not just go with another IP with the same gta structure, using the same engine at this point. Surely something new they can hype is better than a mediocrely received sequel."
gamernews,34f48c,Veritasgear,1 point,Sat May 2 15:35:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe it has something to do with an already established story and schedule. Like maybe it's been all written out and planned, and would cost more to start from scratch than to try and fix the franchise. To be fair, they fixed Assassins Creed which was already an established franchise with AC2. If they can do anywhere as good as that transition, WD will be a great franchise."
gamernews,34f48c,Anzai,1 point,Sat May 2 15:42:49 2015 UTC,When did they fix Assassns Creed? I liked 2 but it's been pretty much all downhill from then on. I haven't played em all though because I lost any interest a while back. When did it get good again?
gamernews,34f48c,Veritasgear,1 point,Sat May 2 15:47:28 2015 UTC,"Well 2 was probably the greatest improvement, but Brotherhood was my personal favorite. A lot of people liked Revelations' story, and Black Flag was just a great game overall. The rest of the series I really can't speak for though. I think AC3 tried something new and didn't succeed. According to what I heard, Rogue had one of the better storylines since the original AC, even if the gameplay is just more of the same that was in Black Flag and... well... we don't talk about Unity."
gamernews,34f48c,Anzai,1 point,Sat May 2 16:03:23 2015 UTC,"I'd heard that about brotherhood, so I played it last year finally. Honestly, I find it much worse than two. It's all set in the one city and lacks variety, and the 'press a button' to kill everything with fellow Assassns seemed cheap as hell. Especially when it came to that arrow storm ability.  Plus I've always found the story in these games to be a convoluted mess. I've played a it of Black Flag and I quite liked it, but I lost interest once it became less about a rollicking pirate adventure and starting getting into magic space alien tech again. That game would have been so much better if it were not assassins creed at all."

It still requires developers to do some work to get it running on Windows 10.  This is Microsoft trying its best to get developers on their platform.  They REALLY need developers releasing apps on their platform.  The demo Microsoft did didn't even go smoothly, and all they were showing off was a basic app that finds hotels.

I just going to wait a year or so and get the complete edition second hand.  I would be very interested to see how many fence sitters they turn away with this horse shit compared to devotees who preorder and what the overall profit advantages is.

gamernews,346tn9,spdrstar,-1,Wed Apr 29 02:13:14 2015 UTC,So greed is the main purpose of pre orders?
gamernews,346tn9,Toastlove,6,Wed Apr 29 02:45:14 2015 UTC,To turn a profit and justify the insane amount of hours it took to develop this game is.
gamernews,346tn9,BoiledFrogs,3,Wed Apr 29 02:51:31 2015 UTC,It's to show returns on investment to show shareholders they millions that has been spent is being recouped. Games are made by businesses that will act like businesses.

gamernews,346tn9,Cykon,1 point,Wed Apr 29 11:29:04 2015 UTC,"JC2 really needed night vision of some kind. The game was also in desperate need of binoculars (eg. Crysis 2)  Multiple save game slots were A+,  however, the slots of save games needed more information, not just the gameplay time. Each savegame should list chaos earned, ammo, weapons, spawn location, and money in pocket.  I fear that in order to ""appeal to the console players"" , the savegame slots will be ditched (looking at you, Watch Dogs).     The entire system of the helicopter delivery redneck needs ditched.  Unfortunately, rumor has it that the entire monetary system of the world is being discarded.  This is a hint to  me that Avalanche is removing the RPG elements, and  taking the gameplay towards a more linear storyline, with greater emphasis on missions.  I predict that the system of finding every last item in a city in order to complete those areas will be scrapped by Avalanche. That was finding needles in a haystack, both time consuming and difficult.  JC2  had a lot to learn from COD regarding shooting mechanics.  I felt that JC2 with the shooting mechanics of COD and the enemy Ai of COD would be the ultimate game."
gamernews,346tn9,stry8993,-2,Wed Apr 29 12:52:48 2015 UTC,That didn't look like gameplay... looked like a scripted sequence in-engine... like Battlefront 3... not buying into this hype bullshit anymore.
gamernews,346tn9,spikeyfreak,3,Wed Apr 29 12:38:00 2015 UTC,Have you played JC2? It looked like game play filmed from detached cameras to me.
gamernews,346tn9,MeBroken,-2,Wed Apr 29 19:41:23 2015 UTC,"I have, and the first one as well. But its not really gameplay, is it? You're not watching someone play the actual game. Its watching some edited, sensatationalized version of 'gameplay'. Now I know that the GAMEPLAY is actually pretty sensation in itself, so, why not let the game speak for itself? Theres no... play in this. Theres game. And while its a fantastic game, I'm sure, so why not show that?"
gamernews,346tn9,stry8993,2,Sun May 3 08:53:49 2015 UTC,"Agree with Cykon.  Looked like game play ""filmed"" from different angles.  None of that really looked scripted.  Just Cause plays like that."

I love Just Cause, and I've played the crap out of the first two, and I'm stoked as hell for the third, but its just... I'm just trying to say, that we're getting hyped up over something that... it just doesn't show someone playing the game. You don't get to see HOW it plays. And with a trailer where they're talking about pre-order DLC, I'm just trying to say that its worrisome. I have faith that Avalanche will knock this one out of the park as well, and some of the changes they've proposed and stuff you can see in the trailer look great, but, the editing is what I think, in my opinion, makes this not really a gameplay trailer, and just... a trailer."
gamernews,346tn9,MeBroken,1 point,Wed Apr 29 12:54:14 2015 UTC,Let's just agree to disagree :) But about that pre-order DLC stuff.

I did like the DLC in the second game, I thought it added some neat stuff, but... man, there sure was a lot of it. I guess thats almost the new normal now. What with games like Total War and such offering entirely new game's worth cost-wise in DLC. Regardless though, JC and JC2 were great with or without the DLC, so we'll see. I hope they push Multiplayer into this one, and hired the dudes to do it, that'd be cool."

Both the scenario editor and character editors were already possible by breaking into the files, so next to no work was done there.  Also the DRM Free players getting penalised for not using steam?   I'm not saying that the content isn't appreciated, just I don't see how this update would cause any respect to be gained."

I was never expecting any additional content for this game (it didnt need it imo). I played it through 3 times in 3 weeks when it was released. The fact that they are still putting stuff out for it (despite the wait) is exceptional from a very small team that also have other projects to work on.  But each to their own man, we all have expectations in life, you just keep on keepin on with your disrespect towards 11 bit."

You stated you hadn't gained any for it.   At the end of the trailer it's stated 'So you can see why we took so long to make this update happen with all the new content we provided' which isn't the case.  I was one of the first people in the world to put a review to their first game. I have loads of respect for them. My statement only applies to this trailer and patch alone.

gamernews,344gti,PudgyPudgePudge,12,Tue Apr 28 16:05:01 2015 UTC,Konami is has been so fucking shady the past couple months. They need to get their shit together and communicate with their fans if they wish to continue having any respect from people. I mean you can't just fire/part ways with your biggest name game developer and try to keep it a secret. People aren't fucking stupid.

gamernews,344gti,Whompa,3,Wed Apr 29 17:06:14 2015 UTC,So we'll be getting more of the same diluted Silent Hill titles. No thanks. I'll keep an eye out for whatever Kojima/DelToro/Reedus (hopefully) put together on their own.

gamernews,341u0u,viperguy212,6,Mon May 4 02:46:48 2015 UTC,As some one with a 1440p monitor and a 980: Ultra
gamernews,341u0u,supermonkeyball64,4,Mon Apr 27 18:01:17 2015 UTC,"Shit, I got a 970 with a 1440p monitor. Be interesting to see how it fairs..."
gamernews,341u0u,echolog,2,Mon Apr 27 19:16:46 2015 UTC,I'm hoping my SLI 780's will hold up... I can't hit max settings on GTA V much less this beast.
gamernews,341u0u,Shunkan,-2,Tue Apr 28 00:37:18 2015 UTC,I am playing GTA V with this setup and it runs pretty well. As both GTA and The Witcher are open world I guess performance will be similar. I regret not getting 980 tho.
gamernews,341u0u,spencer32320,6,Mon Apr 27 20:34:05 2015 UTC,Just because the games are open world doesn't equate to any comparison with performance.
gamernews,341u0u,echolog,4,Mon Apr 27 21:35:27 2015 UTC,Rectangular buildings with nothing in them take up a lot less resources than miles and miles of forests with grass and leaves and other things that hate your hardware.
gamernews,341u0u,Shunkan,-3,Tue Apr 28 00:37:59 2015 UTC,"Of course, I was comparing them because both of those games are being released fairly close to each other and have similar environments(huge cities, large open areas with a lot of grass and trees). In my mind Witcher should run just as well as GTA unless there are some very advanced technologies used."
gamernews,341u0u,_Ganon,3,Mon Apr 27 21:56:31 2015 UTC,"GTAV is going to run far better on a computer than TW3 will.  They are not a good comparison to make.  You can tell just by looking at the recommended specs:  GTAV                      TW3 CPU: Intel i5 @ 3.2GHz    CPU: Intel i7 @ 3.4 GHz GPU: Nvidia GTX 660 2GB   GPU: Nvidia GTX 770 2GB   That's a fairly large gap in hardware.  Looking at the benchmarks for just the GPUs in some games, including GTA V at the end:                     GTX 660         GTX 770 Crysis: Warhead    40 fps          57  fps Far Cry 3          32 fps          50  fps Battlefield 3      83 fps          126 fps GTA V              42 fps          67  fps   Looking at the numbers, and with a small reminder that there is no science behind this because developers arbitrarily set the Minimum / Recommended specs, we could potentially see a loss of up to 20 frames per second between GTA V and TW3.  What should especially dishearten you is that CDPR has already stated that the recommend specs (GTX 770) will not run the game at max settings / 1080p, just like GTA V.  Until official benchmarks are available, nothing can be proven, but based on evidence provided I can confidently say that TW3 will run worse than GTA V, and just because you can run GTA V well does not mean you will run TW3 well."
gamernews,341u0u,Shunkan,3,Mon Apr 27 23:00:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for the in-depth info. I hope CDPR used that extra time well in terms of optimizing the game.
gamernews,341u0u,_Ganon,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:12:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'm actually super glad they finished earlier than expected. They have a lot of time left to test the game and iron out a lot of low-priority bugs, which is fantastic."

gamernews,341u0u,tobias19,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:05:18 2015 UTC,"I think that's more of a testament to how good Witcher 2 looked as opposed to being something against 3.

gamernews,341sk9,balickma,2,Mon Apr 27 22:05:29 2015 UTC,"In the case of Konami I think it means they're probably about to institute some radical changes.  This is just my speculation, but this may be a temporary voluntary delisting while they restructure their business.  If the changes they plan on making make it too difficult or impossible to meet the listing requirements for the exchange while they restructure, then that's one reason why they might voluntarily delist."

I'm going to address this first because this is an important point in your comment. Game companies don't want well thought out reviews. They want free advertising to expand the hype further.  To the rest of your comment, as somebody that knew AngryJoe and other Joe in highschool, this was the kind of stuff they found funny then, so they either thinks it's funny 12 years later or they are just selling out and trying to appeal to the highschool and stoner crowds."
gamernews,341me0,hothrous,8,Mon Apr 27 17:07:15 2015 UTC,"I like Joe's reviews, mainly because they are incredibly thorough and don't gloss over everything that might suck about the game. That being said, he's a grown man who still spikes his hair and dresses like Superboy. Sometimes his humor is cringey, but hes definitely better with a prepared script."
gamernews,341me0,Cat_Party,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:10:28 2015 UTC,"I've never seen any of his reviews I liked the style of. I used to have numerous disagreements with him on games, but sometimes we agreed, I see the same thing in his reviews, really.   Maybe I'd care more about his videos if it wasn't for the fact that he's shown about a years worth of production value increase in the 15 years he's been actually making videos with his friends."
gamernews,341me0,hothrous,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:31:26 2015 UTC,"I definitely always have to skip over his ""intro skit"" for every review. The style is definitely cringey but at least his reviews are extremely thorough. No one else I know of devotes 30 - 40 minute videos to a single game."

gamernews,341me0,Sergnb,2,Tue Apr 28 16:44:24 2015 UTC,"Cool to see some confirmation from someone who knew him. Just curious, was/is he a stoner? I feel like his attitude/rants are more indicative of a drinker than smoker. But ya, as a stoner myself I love listening to him rant about stuff I can see is blatantly wrong, like he is an avenger dishing out gaming justice, but when he just doesn't understand a mechanic or something I tend to find him pretty annoying."
gamernews,341me0,Metarete,2,Mon Apr 27 20:08:21 2015 UTC,"At the time, he was more of a drinker, but his smaller group of friends were the kind that would just get into anything available.    but when he just doesn't understand a mechanic or something I tend to find him pretty annoying.   This is the thing we used to disagree about a bunch. He always just said things were crap, back then, when they he wasn't immediately good at them."
gamernews,341me0,hothrous,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:17:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this, sheds a lot of light on the reviews themselves. Completely not trying to bash him - everyone has their things. Just interesting to note the tastes of a reviewer whom so many follow, including myself."
gamernews,341me0,Metarete,2,Tue Apr 28 20:48:08 2015 UTC,"Completely not trying to bash him    Believe me, I understand. I deleted a lot of stuff when replying because I'm happy for him that he's succeeding. That doesn't change the fact that I never liked him very much. Nor did I really care for any of the other people that were on the crew when he started."

Angry Joes review of one of the most anticipated games of all time?  He's going to make an ass of himself.  More importantly when you watch these guys play they're legitimately bad at the game.  These are the kinds of people you wouldn't want to pub with on your favorite co-op game, yet they're the people millions turn to when they want advice on what games to buy."
gamernews,341me0,Tantric989,6,Mon Apr 27 21:08:17 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much how 90% of reddit feels about these kind of reviewers it seems, but since most of the popular reviewers are this way, more and more YT channels unfortunately adapt the style.  I see no excuse for the poor skills though. Angry Joe and a lot of others have been in this game a long time, and I don't understand how you still play this bad. Is it on purpose cause they think it's funny?"

Running into the fence, constantly facing the walls, unlike Angry Joe no concept that the people watching might want to take in the scenery effects or see how important paying attention to the beastiary is to the gameplay.   @Joe, just use that guy as the comic sidekick don't let him make gameplay content videos please.. we want to see the things you were trying to get him to show not the process of you dealing with someone bad at the game who doesn't care."

But on the same hand, assuming that Scott Cawthorn really is wrapping the series up with this, then I really can't blame him. He's a fairly prolific developer with very little in the way of major success before this series despite having some technically well made games, hopefully the success of FNAF will allow him to bankroll some other projects that aren't just money grabs."
gamernews,3454ay,pixel_illustrator,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:15:22 2015 UTC,3 games in under a year is kinda of redonk. Is the game really that good? I personally have not played it but from what I seen there doesn't really seem to be much to the game in the first. place.
gamernews,3454ay,Upyourasses,2,Tue Apr 28 15:35:52 2015 UTC,"The gameplay is solid enough if you ask me, it doesn't make very much real-world sense but the titles are fairly polished and work well. They're basically time-management games that if played well allow you to progress without any jump-scares (think something like Diner Dash...kinda). In that regard I appreciate them because the jump-scares are treated as penalties (mostly) for playing poorly. The story is a clusterfuck that doesn't make any sense but has attracted a pretty sizeable (and by extension awful) fanbase because it doesn't spell everything out (which is arguably good for a horror series, but suspension of disbelief is pretty hard to keep up in a series where supposedly there are animatronics walking around a bustling Chuck E Cheese with rotting corpses in them and barely any patrons raise an eyebrow, and that's probably the least ridiculous thing in this series.)  Long story short, the gameplay is simple but decent, the presentation is polished and unique, and it resonated with an audience. It's a fairly original title and the developer has at least bothered to shake up the gameplay every entry, so they aren't just 3 reskins of the same game, even if the changes make little real world sense."

Isn't the point of a remaster to bring something that's out of date, or not compatible up to today's standards? I'm probably missing something or setting the bar a little too high.

To put it in context: (Garriott: Too Many Beta Invitees Hurt Tabula Rasa)   “We burned out some quantity of our beta-testers when the game wasn’t yet fun,"" he said, adding, ""As we’ve begun to sell the game, the people who hadn’t participated in the beta became our fast early-adopters.”  He continued, “And the people who did participate in the beta, we’ve had to go back to and say ‘look, look, we promise: we know it wasn’t fun two months ago, but we fixed all that. Really, come try it again.’ We’ve had to go out and develop free programs to invite those people back for free before they go buy it. So the beta process, which we used to think of as a QA process, is really a marketing process.”"

gamernews,33tjkl,davidverner,66,Sat Apr 25 14:14:44 2015 UTC,"The worry is with the introduction of Curated Workshops that free and open modding will be removed entirely, as in, it just won't be possible to do. You've seen the arguments before with developers like BioWare and DICE no longer supporting modding with their games, they say it's because it's too complicated for modders or because they don't have time to work on the tools, many users argue it's because they don't want mods to cut in to DLC sales. I don't know any more about it than you in that regard, but if you're running a curated modding marketplace and there's a site out there with lots of mods available for free (note: probably not the same mods, as that wouldn't make sense!) will you willingly let that continue or would you try to ensure all your mods were going through your curated marketplace? I guess it would entirely depend on the developer and publisher in question, but if you ask me, my main concern now is the DRMification and closing down of free and open modding, the concept that modding can only take place if it's done through one official platform to the detriment of all others. Because up until now that's definitely not what modding has been about at all.  And so, if you're wondering where the Nexus sits in between all of this, then you'll find us sitting where we've always been sitting, right here, without fundamentally changing. We're still going to be about the free and open distribution of mods for everyone and I don't see that changing any time soon. Sure, I've had offers. Lots of offers. And I don't discount anything at all, but right now, for the foreseeable future, there are no plans to shake things up at all. I have absolutely no idea how these changes within the modding community are going to affect the community here at the Nexus, but I think that there's still going to be a market for a site that continues to offer a free and open sharing platform, away from money, where people who want to continue modding as a hobby, not a career, can shine.   http://www.nexusmods.com/games/news/12444/?   The system works by presenting the mod author with a list of ""Service Providers"" when they go to upload their file. They're informed that they can choose to support none, one or more of these Service Providers and that any cut is taken from Valve's cut, and not from their cut. The cut percentage is 5%. Ergo, if a mod author does not select any Service Providers then the cut remains 25% to the mod author, 40% to Bethesda, 35% to Valve. If the mod author picks one or more Service Providers then the cut changes to 25% to the mod author, 40% to Bethesda, 30% to Valve, 5% shared between one or more Service Providers.  So what we have here is Valve coming to me, in a positive and open exchange, with no strings attached, offering to share some of their split of the profit they receive from specific mod authors who have specifically stated when they upload their mods that they would like the Nexus to receive some of Valve's cut of the profit. Wrap your head around it. Mod authors using the paid workshop system say ""I like the Nexus, I feel like the Nexus has helped me or the community at some point, I would like to support the Nexus, I'm going to donate some of Valve's cut to the Nexus"". So the Nexus gets a trickle of funds, for free, for no extra work and for no promises of allegiance or support of Steam Workshop. I can still express and already have expressed my misgivings and criticisms of the way things have been implemented and how I think the system can be improved. The only string attached to all this is that I cannot share the revenue details publicly. I have signed away my right to that privilege, as I'm reminded on the revenue page where it says ""Reminder: Sales data is provided for your personal use, and you've agreed to keep this data confidential (see: Workshop Legal Agreement)."". A small price to pay for a few groans of ""that's convenient!"" from the conspiracy theorists among you. If you want to see what I agreed to then the Workshop Agreement is open for anyone to view. As I'm not actually contributing anything (and I have had this clarified for me by legal counsel), those terms pertaining to contributions do not apply to the Nexus. So, the off-the-rails person on Reddit who claimed I'd sold my soul to Valve and that they could now commandeer all of the Nexus and twist it to its evil will, making us charge for mods as well are mistaken. Because I'm not stupid. Thanks.   ..   Most importantly, I pledge that any funds the Nexus receives from this will not be funds the Nexus relies on in order to survive. The Nexus has always been self-sustaining, relying on its users to help fund the site through adverts and Premium Membership. I would never jeopardize that by using Service Provider money to expand beyond the sustainable financial limits of these sites without that Service Provider money. What this means is, the Nexus can use the money, but it won't rely on that money in order to survive. As I mentioned in my Reddit response, the Nexus now needs to earn $500,000 a year in order to pay for the servers, the CDN, the bandwidth, the database cluster, the firewalls, the legal counsel, the accountants and the programmers. If we can bring in more money to pay for things that aren't needed but are surely wanted (like mobile support), that won't place a burden on the current financial requirements, without doing anything to further annoy users, like more ads, then hell yes! This is free money to support the Nexus, at the expense of Valve. It's almost poetic.   http://www.nexusmods.com/games/news/12459/?"

gamernews,33tjkl,Patius,14,Sat Apr 25 16:27:53 2015 UTC,And just imagine how much it costs to run Steam. Makes that 15% seem pretty reasonable.
gamernews,33tjkl,Slukaj,15,Sat Apr 25 18:49:40 2015 UTC,"That deal strikes me as odd. Both in that it implies Valve is willing to give them some of their money for nothing and that they're being called a service provider without providing an actual service. Also, money in fungible. I don't see how you can accept funds for a site without them becoming part of the funds the site uses to survive, unless you're straight up pocketing them."
gamernews,33tjkl,EpsilonRose,6,Sat Apr 25 16:42:09 2015 UTC,You don't think taking some of the server load off steam while aggregating a large portion of mods into a localized area is providing a service? What exactly do you think they should be doing to provide a service?
gamernews,33tjkl,EpsilonRose,-1,Sat Apr 25 22:36:12 2015 UTC,Are they doing that? I thought the payed for mods only come through steam workshop.
gamernews,33tjkl,playmer,5,Sat Apr 25 22:46:43 2015 UTC,"They do, but free mods come from both."
gamernews,33tjkl,EpsilonRose,3,Sat Apr 25 23:17:23 2015 UTC,What do you think The Nexus has been doing this whole time? All this agreement between NMM and Steam does is allow mod sellers to take a portion of VALVE'S profits and give to a 3rd party (I.E. The Nexus or any other site that hosts mods and uses personal bandwidth). Valve is literally giving away a portion of their profits to assist with server and bandwidth cost.
gamernews,33tjkl,EpsilonRose,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:27:13 2015 UTC,"If people are buying the mods through the workshop, then aren't they using the work shop's servers? If so, then the nexus is not providing adding server support or bandwidth  any more than tiger direct adds extra stock to new egg."
gamernews,33tjkl,smell_my_cheese,3,Sun Apr 26 02:38:03 2015 UTC,That's not how I understood it from The Nexus post. I understood it that the workshop simply showcased the mods.
gamernews,33tjkl,spikeyfreak,2,Sun Apr 26 02:44:41 2015 UTC,"That would be news to me. I was under the impression that they were completely separate and people had to upload their mods separately.

gamernews,33tjkl,CyborgDragon,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:49:34 2015 UTC,"No, the workshop provides the mod if you get it from there. The point about server load is simply that people downloading it from nexus aren't using steam's bandwidth"

Why?  As long as what he does with that money doesn't accrue any on-going costs that are greater than what the rest of the revue covers, then he's doing exactly what he says.  Hell, it's quit possible for him to use that money to do things he wouldn't be able to otherwise, and make the site MORE profitable.  If he were able to use it to create a mobile app, and that mobile app turns a profit, then he's just done what he said while increasing non-Steam revenue."

What has Valve given us that any other company couldn't have done? Specials and an easier way to access your games? My shelf is good for at least one of those.  Valve was a system designed to give devs an easier time patching games (without all the calls to customer service demanding fixes for bugs that were already patched) as well as introduce a new type of DRM system.  Now don't get me wrong, copy protection already existed and would have existed with or without Valve but just because you know you're going to die at some point doesn't mean you speed up the process by shooting yourself.  Digital distribution was already a thing and at best Valve has made it easier for us to obtain new games but many games now force us to use Steamworks or play no games at all. I would argue Origin is much better for straight digital downloads if it wasn't for the fact I don't want to be forced online to play/activate my retail game.  I have never liked Valve. I don't hate them but I am incredibly leary of them because of their huge holdings. I didn't trust them the moment they introduced that piece of shit DRM with Half-Life 2 and I sure as hell don't like them now that they've convinced more than half of the major publishers to do the same crap. I don't like the fact that because of discount deals they're somehow above criticism and for the past 10 years have failed to actually fix any of the problems they have, most notably related to support.  The fact that Valve, for whatever made-up reason, can deny me access to the hundreds of dollars of games I own ""lease"" annoys me. The fact I have to be online to activate a fucking retail game - a game I bought for real money in a real store - annoys me. The fact I cannot get decent support unless I bitch for a day on website like reddit annoys me.  I like Valve as a developer and innovator of software. I do not like them as curators and publishers."
gamernews,33tjkl,singularity2030,2,Mon Apr 27 14:57:36 2015 UTC,"A better question is what has Valve given PC gamers?    Huge exposure to smaller indie developers and their games  Several hugely popular games that are often used in competitive play  Release modding tools and SDK for all their games  Love it or hate it Steam is huge and offers massive, regular discounts on games from pretty much every publisher, making a single market place instead of many different ones all requiring their own accounts.

If the return policy was longer and reset after each patch to the game or when the mod author updated I'd feel safer spending money on mods. I know a lot of Mod Authors are good but it could take a long while to run into a game breaking bug, or one that just pisses you off, or if an update just breaks the mod and the mod author just cuts and runs."
gamernews,33tjkl,Squishumz,17,Sat Apr 25 19:13:59 2015 UTC,"We've been starting to see a dramatic shift in how software is developed recently. A while ago it was almost purely a big-boys club, with AAA titles dominating the market. Then the indies started to creep in, but the indies went about things very differently than the old AAAs. You started to get a more 'hobbyist' feel to a lot of games, meaning games could be less burdened by sometimes unnecessary polish, but at the same that lack of polish lead to games that felt unfinished, or buggy. A lot of indies, as people who were very recently hobbyists, don't have the same sense of duty to bugfix their titles. Modding is the next step further than that. Modders have typically received zero compensation, so there was almost zero expectations set on their shoulders. I'm afraid that many authors of these paid mods simply don't realize the gravity of what selling something means, so we'll just get a bunch of half-broken crap. Do I love a lot of the mods on the nexus? Sure. Are most of them buggy as hell and arguably not worth money? Yup."
gamernews,33tjkl,Squishumz,10,Sat Apr 25 20:04:05 2015 UTC,It isn't like AAA haven't gotten worse recently about releasing buggy unpolished messes with chunks of the game being sold later on in DLC.
gamernews,33tjkl,Squishumz,4,Sat Apr 25 20:31:48 2015 UTC,"Because indies showed them that they can get away with it. I'm not saying AAAs are perfect, but I'm saying that I have far more faith in a random AAA title than a random indie title, at least in terms of a baseline of playability.  Also, with indies, there seems to be less accountability, since each person is paying less. They're probably less likely to seek out a refund. With mods, how many people are going to bother trying to wade through the shit that is steam support to refund their $1.00 nude mod that broke with the latest patch? But at the same time, that doesn't make releasing broken mods for sale any better."
gamernews,33tjkl,Squishumz,2,Sat Apr 25 20:33:01 2015 UTC,"What’s the problem? Different products – different quality – different prices. If a content maker prices his software wrong, the market would get rid of him. I don’t understand, what makes the mod market so special that it represents a market failure where the price mechanism suddenly wouldn’t work?"
gamernews,33tjkl,Squishumz,5,Sun Apr 26 02:11:48 2015 UTC,"Because we're the vocal minority crying about what the majority of uninformed consumers will continue to pay for. They won't check if things are compatible; they won't check if the mod author has been updating; they don't care.  Look at the piles of trash that's in steam early access. People still pay for it. Look at all the day 1 DLCs and broken AAA game launches. People still pay for it. So yes, the price mechanisms work the exact same for both sides of the industry (i.e. people continue to pay for broken shit)."
gamernews,33tjkl,Coppercredit,2,Sun Apr 26 02:43:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes, but what’s the problem? Is somebody scamming anybody? Is it not voluntary to pay for a piece of software?

But then fly-fishing started becoming popular, and there was greater variety in the quality fly-fishing equipment being made, which the fly-fishing enthusiasts were happy about. But, since the new blood didn't care as much about fly-fishing as the original people, they were willing to settle for less, so the quality of the equipment started to drop. At this point, the old blood lost the honeymoon phase of ""wow, I'm so happy that everyone enjoys my hobby"", and it became ""wow, all these new people are ruining something I love"".  At this point we end up with questions about whether the old blood is just a bunch of elitists, or whether the new blood has (unintentional) ruined something for the old blood. Does the old blood have any special privilege because they were the people that caused it to become popular? What if the new equipment is so profitable that nobody makes the old high quality equipment anymore?  Bringing it back to gaming: personally, I think that AAA titles these days are significantly less fun on average than they were years ago, and part of the reason is that they're trying to hit the lowest common denominator to make up for their absolutely insane budgets. Since we can't tell these monolithic game companies that , we tend to take out our anger on the new blood that (unintentionally) caused this, even though that's not entirely fair."
gamernews,33tjkl,KorrectingYou,2,Sun Apr 26 04:37:28 2015 UTC,"Agree on the last point. The previous AAA I liked was probably Fallout 3. The only gaming I do now is the occasional couch coop. But should we yell at developers and new customers for that reason?  If there is a sufficient market need for more sophisticated games, one would think that some entrepreneur capitalized on that.   Maybe it’s the indie scene that will satisfy this need. If so, maybe we should applaud the introduction of platforms where smaller software units can get paid, rather than expect everything to be free. It is after all, markets and prices that have proven to be the superior system for advancements through history. People respond to incentives and so on…"
gamernews,33tjkl,Ashe_SDMF,3,Sun Apr 26 05:09:09 2015 UTC,"Most of my points have been about full games. I think the problem with these mods is the lack of accountability that comes with what are essentially microtransactions. I have absolutely zero faith in Valve curating the mods for long after the initial outcry has died down. Fuck, the workshop rules pretty much say ""your mod doesn't run anymore? Kindly ask the developer to update it"", which is just completely unacceptable. Steam takes their cut as the middle man and washes their hands of all liability.  I don't want it to sound like people are complaining because ""muh free stuff is goin away"". I'm fine with the developers of good quality mods being paid for their work. Well done weapon and texture models? Sure sell a few for $0.50, earn a few bucks if you want. Some of the really nice near-full expansions? Charge more; knock yourself out. But in either case, they damn well better continue to work indefinitely, otherwise I expect a refund. Steam will not be giving me that refund, and I don't think modders fully understand what it means when you start accepting payment for something.  With indies, their mindset almost doesn't matter as much, as they're in complete control of their product; Microsoft isn't going to suddenly release a patch to Windows that breaks everything. With mods, Bethesda can easily invalidate all of the mods, meaning the authors have to go back and fix them. Steam doesn't even let you download old versions of applications. This debate would be completely different if steam wasn't a giant pile of shit once you go beyond the basics of being a distribution platform."
gamernews,33tjkl,KoboldCommando,8,Sun Apr 26 05:42:20 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. Mods add content by your choice to a base game for no cost to you (most of the time) while it costs someone their personal time to work on and a site server space and bandwidth to host.   Using a mod is a personal choice. I'm not advocating pay for mods, because I probably wouldn't use them unless they were DLC size like Falskjarr (spl?) but you have to realize that regardless of the value you think they should have, they have some value due to how they come into being.   Personally, a donate to author w/ a small percentage going to the hosting site isn't unreasonable to me unless they're mods that add nothing of value (horse armor comes to mond)."
gamernews,33tjkl,InvaderDem,2,Sat Apr 25 22:41:29 2015 UTC,"Oh I definitely agree they have Value, some like Falskjarr Sky-Re, and Frostfall and others definitely have monetary value in my mind but the current system is too easily taken advantage of by less reputable authors. Valve once again put something on their store and told the customer it's your problem now. They do this way too often for my taste and I wish more people would hold them accountable for it. BTW I hate steam, I've hated it since I bought half life one and was like what the hell is downloading on my computer this isn't the game, so I am a little bitter at Valve's actions at that may sway my judgment on anything they do."

Vote with your wallet and stop blaming valve. No one is forcing you to use their platform for anything. The same mods they will be hosting will be hosted off of other sites like The Nexus. All valve is doing is allowing modders to monetize their work. How are they wrong for allowing someone to capitalize off of their own work?

gamernews,33tjkl,Nushens,3,Sat Apr 25 21:38:24 2015 UTC,"Does anyone else see the benefit of potentially having indie game studios that regularly produce premium content for games that you play?   I think the whole 75% thing is too high, but if that were lowered and companies could actually make enough to sustain themselves through the workshop then that could mean huge things for the next-generation of PC games.   Imagine the first Source 2 game release having four or five indie developers working full-time on mods and being able to estimate an actual profit and get investors involved instead of taking almost 10 years to finish a polished mod that they made nothing from.   I think this will be the case in the future and is hopefully what Valve is picturing. A way to support indie developers and allow for the players to purchase even more content for their games. If Valve only takes 35% of mod profits for their own games (which may or may not be the case, and this comment is just speculation) then that is a huge push to have indie development teams building mods for Source 2 games instead of whatever the next Bethesda game is built on.  the entire market has shifted towards DLC. I, as many of you, remember a time where great games had new free stuff released all the time and it was a great way to keep players involved. Sadly this is not the case anymore. Company pays team to develop something, company expects to gain a profit from it. This really isn't that absurd, gamers have become jaded and expect things for free.  If a modder wants money for his work then he should sell his mod. If he doesn't then he shouldn't sell his mod. All of you who are getting mad about modders (like the developer of 'SkyUI') for wanting to be paid for the hours of work and expertise they put into their mod need a reality check. This is WORK. They were kind enough to work for free. Now they don't have to work for free. They still can if they want to.  So back to my original point, the distribution of profits needs to be raised for the mod teams. This is what people should be complaining about. Not that they have to pay for stuff now. Someone should just make a ""Mommy and Daddy won't pay for my mods MEGATHREAD."""

It might sound low, but 25% is probably not far off of what it needs to be for talented modders to make a living."

gamernews,33tjkl,murderhuman,2,Sun Apr 26 13:03:56 2015 UTC,"So... yet again I see sensationalistic grasping at straws.  Has there been any hint whatsoever that Valve is going to ""shut down free mods"" or hinder them in any way?  Because To read any of these posts you'd think Valve had opened the gates and armies of doom soldiers had flooded out and kneecapped everyone who wanted to give a mod away, and yet I haven't seen anything from them about changing the free mods on the workshop or the availability thereof."
gamernews,33tjkl,81crx,2,Sun Apr 26 05:28:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the community is upset that what was once free is now potentially no longer free. The two arguments that are legit is that people can take free mods and upload them as theirs with a price tag on it; and that users should be able to request a refund incase the mod doesn't work for them or creates a game-breaking bug.  You have people saying there should be a donation button because Bethesda and Valve get too much of the cut, despite other distribution systems having a similar royalty rate. This also wouldn't fix people taking free mods and making it their own with a price tag.  They also never seem to acknowledge that if the modders create the content and put a price tag on it, that's in their right, because they created it. They say this has divided the modding community. Is that really Valve's fault? Or is it because some modders wish to be compensated for their work and others don't feel that way? Because if modders are putting a price tag on it, it must mean they've always secretly wanted to get some income from their projects - now they have an avenue to do so.  They just want it to go back to being a free service. How quickly these people have turned is no different than people who say they'll drop Netflix the instant a commercial airs. Honestly, one week ago Gabe Newell was the second coming of Christ. Now, it looks like he's far from that. How quick people are to turn on something is really shocking to me.  Me personally, I'd prefer it to go back to a completely free service, but I can totally understand the concept of modders being rewarded for their work if they wish to place a price tag on their work. Yes, Bethesda and Valve get a cut - one created the game and the other distributes the game and mods through their network. If you don't like the royalty rates, just don't get it or go through another service to get your mods.  We've been told time and time again to vote with our wallet - why doesn't this apply here too?"
gamernews,33tjkl,Ikinhaszkarmakplx2,0,Sun Apr 26 12:53:15 2015 UTC,"The risk isn't valve. It's the fact that Valve does want to force game devs to do or not do something. Valve really want to create a market that mostly runs itself. That's basically their dream. And it's not a particularly bad one.   For example, it's Bethesda that's chosen to take 45% of mod revenue. Valve takes 30% and often only 25%.  They're worried it will be Bethesda choice to curate the workshop and disallow free mods. Valve basically has to refuse this, which is what they don't like doing.   So the worry isn't really Valve, it's game devs. Hope that makes things clear."

He says he's beside himself that Valve refuses to pull his mod from the libraries of customers who already paid for it, but that's a standard clause Valve puts in all their distribution contracts, and it's absolutely necessary. To a customer, it's unacceptable to remove something you paid for without your knowledge or permission. Remember when EA pulled a bunch of games from Steam after the launch of Origin? Can you imagine if paying customers suddenly lost access to all those games?  The 25/75 split is shitty, but not as bad as you might think. By comparison, the standard split on Steam is 70/30 developer/Valve, but in this case, there's three parties. If you split the developer's portion in half with the modders, that would be 35/35/30 modder/developer/Valve.  So, it's a shitty cut, but as soon as he realized he misinterpreted the cut and asked Valve to stop selling the mod, they did."

They've integrated a one click install manager, mod browser for newbies, downloader and bandwidth costs covered on their end, etc, all important stuff which is going to be worth the percentage.  Then the publisher decides on their own cut, which seems fair since without their product you'd have nothing, since you're not making an independent game, you're tweaking somebody else's and relying on a lot of their work, such as the development/advertising/testing/risk/etc that they put into the original product to give you a solid foundation to work on with far greater ease.

gamernews,33qhfu,Bertilino,5,Wed May 6 07:30:59 2015 UTC,"No problem with paid mods. It'll be bad for the consumer, at least initially due to being forced to pay for mods that were previously free and that sucks a lot, but people deserve the option to get paid for their hard work if they choose to. Despite the initial suckage though, this additional incentive to make mods will pay off in the future with better, more numerous really well made and well supported mods.  The problem I have is just the absurd cut Valve is taking. It should be the other way around - 75% to the creator, 25% to Valve. At the current split it encourages modders to set the price sky high so they can get a fair amount of money."
gamernews,33qhfu,CrazyLeprechaun,5,Fri Apr 24 23:50:14 2015 UTC,its actually 30% valve 45% game developer 25% modder if i read it right.

gamernews,33qhfu,AJT217,2,Fri Apr 24 19:21:11 2015 UTC,Modders would be making money by taking advantage of assets made by game devs.  Any paid modding program should get sued very quickly.

gamernews,33qhfu,RumpleCragstan,-19,Fri Apr 24 23:10:27 2015 UTC,So many entitled gamers. Why shouldn't a Modder be compensated for his work if he chooses to Charge for it. If valve takes a cut then that is their prerogative as a service provider.    No one is forced to make their Mod paid. If you don't want to buy the Mods then don't.
gamernews,33qhfu,keepeetron,18,Fri Apr 24 23:46:01 2015 UTC,"The issue people have with the system is it's a bad system. The concept of paying for mods. Yes that's a good idea. But I want to buy a mod I'm sure will work, will continue to work, and is made by the person I'm buying from.  When I do pay I want the guy who did the hardwork to make the mod to get the money. I've already given Steam and the Publisher/Developer money in the form of the base game and any DLC needed for all the modding. Maybe a small cut for Steam for hosting the mods, but only if they make workshop easier for modders to use.  As it is the service incentivises overpriced simple mods to the point where if these where official DLC people would be angry. The lack of any publisher/Steam curation means that the theft of the work of others and poor quality mods will end up becoming rampant.  If these ""paid mods"" were rebranded to ""Community Expansions"" and cherry picked by the Publisher/developer than this outrage would be much subdued."
gamernews,33qhfu,Biological_Failure,2,Sat Apr 25 01:03:56 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, Steam's cut is the same that they get from any other product they sell, which I don't have any problem with. Bethesda's cut is the one that seems too large. They compare their percentage to the 15-25% given to authors of derivative works by Amazon Worlds, but the difference is that the works you buy through Amazon Worlds don't require any purchase from the base IP. The use of Skyrim mods automatically requires the purchase of Skyrim itself.  I do agree with a curated workshop. Bethesda's blog post stated that they absolutely wanted to avoid a curated workshop, but the difference is that, if mods are to be a product, there needs to be a way to protect customers from unknowingly buying completely broken products. Steam already does this in a sense, by not allowing just anybody to put their game up on their service. Paid mods should be allowed to be not fun, or not worth their price tag, just as many games on Steam are, but they shouldn't be allowed to be dysfunctional.  If they want to have a paid workshop in future games, a possible solution could be to have a Greenlight-style system for paid mods. A nominal fee per account and the fact that there needs to be some community interest before it actually goes on sale should discourage the uploading of huge numbers of low-effort mods. I imagine modders with a history of releasing quality free mods would also be more likely to see their paid mods reach the workshop."

In GoT they went for characters that were parallel to the ""super stars"" so it was a lot of familiar event but from a totally unseen perspective. I think that's a fantastic way of redoing a well-known story and it makes the game more of an independent supplement to the universe rather then something that seems like a pure cash-in.    You're right about the linearity though. I don't have an issue with it, but so far Telltales games has only ever let me choose if I want to be an asshole or sympathetic guy.

gamernews,33nbau,galactic_punt,20,Fri Apr 24 01:55:03 2015 UTC,"It's really not that shocking if you actually look at all their work and their support.  Valve is notorious for half-assing, or more accurately, implementing features, developing them halfway, then dropping them to do something else because they have fucking ADHD and can never see anything to completion."
gamernews,33nbau,Sedition7988,5,Fri Apr 24 03:05:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've become pretty irritated with their management style. I'm sure it works for them, and it sounds like an awesome place to work... but on this side, as a fan, as a consumer, it's a huge bummer.  They have no incentives. No management structure imposing deadlines. They're a private company, so there's no shareholder influence or higher publisher influence. And obviously fans begging them for things makes them budge not one inch either, so there's basically zero pressure on them to do anything.  If it weren't for the gravy train that is Steam, they'd be out of business working this way."
gamernews,33nbau,jdmoser,6,Fri Apr 24 04:28:27 2015 UTC,That's the biggest thing with Valve: Steam.  They stopped being a game studio in my eyes years ago. Not least of which because the last actual -game- they made that was actually theirs and not just some mod they threw money and artists at was Half-life 2. And that was -seven years ago-.  Valve to me is just digital gamestop now.

Apparently it's jsut the piracy thing.  I wonder if there would be such a backlash if the test-game were one that didn't have any mods yet, and therefore no non-steam places to download them and presumably steal them from."
gamernews,33nbau,Falkjaer,2,Fri Apr 24 05:19:00 2015 UTC,"here's the problem, there's a GIANT issue with 0 oversight on Valve's part, and yet they're still taking a 75% cut of your profits.   There are quite a few other issues, but the biggest one is that there's 0 accountability for someone who's taking your money, there's nothing that says 'oops, my mod that you paid for, destroyed your game... let me fix that as it's my problem now'.  This is valve supporting a buyer-beware platform. I understand what they're trying to do, but unless it's moderated, it's a terrible implementation. It's like charging someone to go in a swimming pool that has no lifeguards, and may or may not have sharks swimming in it, you'll find that out after you get in the water."

gamernews,33nbau,Falkjaer,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:35:14 2015 UTC,I'm curious what the big deal is.  What's wrong with giving people a way to make money on their hard work?
gamernews,33nbau,masasuka,7,Fri Apr 24 03:17:16 2015 UTC,"lets say, hypothetically, I go to a site like nexusmods.com, and I download one of the top mods not made by a big developer name, and then I post it on the steam workshop under my name. Now normally, there isn't a huge issue with this as there's no monitization, and as long as I'm referencing the dev, they should be getting some spotlight, helps move mods over that the dev's may not have time to move over to steam, or may not know that you can. Now, with this system, I can, hypothetically again, take a mod, upload it to the workshop, say it's mine, and start charging for this mod that 'I created'... Since there's no curation, and it's 100% up to the developer/community to police this, if I'm good enough, I can convince people to pay me, with little-no recourse for my plagiarism, and since it's digital, there's no real law saying this is illegal."
gamernews,33nbau,Falkjaer,3,Fri Apr 24 04:07:08 2015 UTC,"okay, so it's just the possibility for piracy that bothers people?  Like I totally get that, it's just surprised me that every single thing I've seen about this has been overwhelmingly negative.  I feel like Steam trying some new stuff that, if anything, could end up encouraging more mods, is a pretty cool thing, even if it does currently have some big flaws."
gamernews,33nbau,indenturedsmile,7,Fri Apr 24 05:17:00 2015 UTC,"For me there are two other big issues:  One, Valve and the game dev take 75% for something they made no contributions to (other than the platform itself).  Two, if a patch or other mod (or the mod dev) breaks the mod, you're now stuck with a useless mod that you paid money for."
gamernews,33nbau,Nushens,3,Fri Apr 24 06:09:38 2015 UTC,"One, Valve and the game dev take 75% for something they made no contributions to (other than the platform itself).   I also want to add that games that support mods/steam workshop are generally games that include the license to use their tools with the original purchase of the game. I saw an example earlier of it being similar Adobe charging people 75% of any profit for things generated in Photoshop or similar tools.   I think many people would be okay with paying Valve a fee or a small amount of the profit to use their Steam platform to sell their mods but 75% is absolutely ridiculous."
gamernews,33nbau,ceol_,4,Fri Apr 24 14:23:54 2015 UTC,It's not similar to that at all. You aren't using the Photoshop Network to publish your art. Your art doesn't require Photoshop be installed in order to be viewed. Whoever came up with that analogy is incredibly obtuse.
gamernews,33nbau,Nushens,0,Fri Apr 24 16:52:17 2015 UTC,"Your art doesn't require Photoshop be installed in order to be viewed.   You're completely right and that makes it that much worse. In the photoshop example they're free to sell to anyone and everyone as they're not limited to an audience who only has that program.  That isn't the case for this mod stuff, not only do modders pay for their tools but they also can only sale to people who own this software as well.    The whole idea is incredibly screwed up. I mean just look at this guys story."

Hint: It's way easier than steam mod publishing, there's no review process like there is on steam, no trial period to see if users submit any reports about your item being a scam, etc.You do not need to prove you are an author any more than on steam, in fact you need to prove it even less with ebooks.  And yet, uploading stolen content isn't rampant in all the ebook markets."

gamernews,33nbau,Kalthramis,10,Thu Apr 23 22:54:13 2015 UTC,Donating to a content creator does not equal buying their content.
gamernews,33nbau,LaznAzn,5,Thu Apr 23 22:59:59 2015 UTC,"Because once you cross that line and make it straight up paid content, now the mod creator has an obligation to support the product, but there's no way they'll be able to enforce that.  On top of this, mods will conflict with each other and be buggy and unreliable. That's just their nature.  Official paid DLC on the other hand is designed to work with all other content. Once you buy it, then it's just going to work.  On top of that, a huge amount of the modscene is based on sharing of ideas and content. Mods will incorporate assets and scripts from other mods. For example, with Skyrim, most mods rely on SKSE. What if the SKSE dudes feel like it's unfair for people to be charging for mods that rely on SKSE?  Traditionally, modders have created not for a desire to make money, but just out of a passion for the game, or an interest in honing their skills. So your insinuation that modders now suddenly all 'deserve' money for their work completely ignores the historical context of modding."
gamernews,33nbau,Shalterra,3,Thu Apr 23 23:01:14 2015 UTC,They have no obligation to support it if they charge money. They can offer it as-is. You are not guaranteed support when you purchase a product.
gamernews,33nbau,Shalterra,3,Thu Apr 23 23:04:25 2015 UTC,and its steam place to take 75% of their hard earned money? seems to me steam offering to buy the mods or something of that nature or just having a donate option would have sufficed.
gamernews,33nbau,yeeeaaaarrrgggh,2,Thu Apr 23 23:05:46 2015 UTC,"Currators get 25%. That doesn't mean the other 75 is Valve. Bethesda takes a cut, and considering some mods are 10Gb, a lot is also spent for server space/maitenance.   Traditionally, Valve takes 40% for most things on Steam."

Person B can just repost it, or has to change some shading colors? Etc.  2) Person A has a free Mod, person B posts it to be a paid mod; is it stealing their 'legal' property since it is a mod of a game that is neither persons legal property to begin with?  3) Person A posts a mod, Person B posts the same mod under their name taking credit.

Also, this is a very small amount of money. In order to support yourself you would need to generate enough sales to earn 800$ or more a month.

gamernews,33l9vq,Shit_Fazed,18,Thu Apr 23 13:40:05 2015 UTC,"That's exactly right. Companies that show you 'in engine footage' are essentially saying ""we think you'll believe anything and even if you end up hating the game, hey, we already got your $60""."

My other concern is always that a company will polish the shit out of the demo section but the rest of the game will be an empty husk.    I think an acceptable compromise are Let's Play videos.  I get to see someone playing and reacting to a game in real time.  The devs don't have to take the time to cut out a slice of gameplay, either, I think that is a big factor in the lack of demos these days.  Granted, you don't actually get to play the game, but if you know a think or two about the player, their tastes and their tolerance for bugs/glitches, you can get a good idea of what you're in for.  It's work well for me so far.

gamernews,33l9vq,supahmonkey,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:41:50 2015 UTC,"I didn't even think of the possibility of Nemesis. Shadow of Mordor (Monolith) and this (Avalanche) will/are both be published by Warner Bros so hopefully this means there will be some kind of Nemesis system in place, even if it's not expansive as Shadow in terms of number of [Captains] but it probably won't be called Nemesis if it's there."
gamernews,33l9vq,sonicmerlin,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:23:49 2015 UTC,"I liked the story and SoM had the best voice acting I've ever heard in any game.  It's just that the story was sooo short, and the side quests were basically tech demos (go here and use the stealth ability to take down 10 henchmen).  Actually I just realized it seems like this game is employing the same voice acting company used in SoM.  I think I recognized one of the voices.  And overall the VA seems really high quality.  Okay this game has me excited."

gamernews,33l9vq,stormotron91,18,Thu Apr 23 15:06:18 2015 UTC,"As good as this game looks, it slightly bugs me how when you're attacking a group of enemies, they take turns in attacking you. I feel this hinders the realism in games quite a bit, maybe if they gang up on you, you can do a move that debilitates them all so you can take them out one at a time"
gamernews,33l9vq,doublewhiskey88,6,Thu Apr 23 15:10:58 2015 UTC,It's a videogame. Why does it have to be super realistic?
gamernews,33l9vq,stormotron91,11,Thu Apr 23 14:47:11 2015 UTC,"No ones saying it has to be super realistic. On a side note, it's quite obvious how games are becoming more realistic graphically, which I think aids the immersion. I love arcade style games where the action or physics are exaggerated. However when games are aiming for immersion and realism, I think it's important to note that the AI is still a bit behind despite the realism at face value. Would you not agree that having the AI wait there turn to attack you is a bit... samey?"
gamernews,33l9vq,sonicmerlin,2,Thu Apr 23 15:33:35 2015 UTC,"The realism issue is why I have some issues with Dragon Age after playing a game like Fallout New Vegas.  You down an enemy in New Vegas and literally everything he's carrying you can take.  You down a powerful mage in DA: I and you get 7 gold.  I guess he had a self-destruct spell on that wicked staff and robe.  Also this game's combat system is basically the Batman Arkham system.  They often have enemies waiting, but occasionally they'll have up to 3 enemies attack at once and you can perform a counter (by tapping the counter button 3 times) with a realistic animation.  It would probably be more realistic if they had that happen more often.  On the other hand you'd be surprised how scared a group of people would be to attack a rampaging killing machine."
gamernews,33l9vq,Sabbathius,3,Thu Apr 23 16:24:00 2015 UTC,"There's three approaches to combat.  One is, most fights are one on one. The opponent can be really challenging, and your entire attention is focused on him. The second is, multiple opponents, but they still attack you one at a time. This is what this game seems to be doing, and it's highly annoying because they just stand and wait their turn. Third, and the best I feel, method is to have multiple enemies, all attacking you naturally, but you have the tools to deal with that - dodge out of the way, shake them off, etc. These usually result in the best experience, provided they don't overdo it (too many enemies can be a problem).  Realism or lack thereof isn't really a problem, unless it is immersion-breaking. And, in this case, I feel it is quite immersion-breaking. You're pummeling one guy on the ground, mercilessly, with a lead pipe, while his 8 buddies are standing there looking at you? That's just ridiculous."

Picked up the game on launch day and of course you can only play it on NN3DS (it's like the only game you CANT play on 3DS).   This series seems so elusive to me and I wanna play it so bad! Hoping to pick us Xenoblade X asap  Thanks"
gamernews,33lhvm,WeirdDudeInElevator,-1,Fri Apr 24 04:11:30 2015 UTC,"can somone please explain what this game is? i've seen lots of things advertising it but i still dont have a clue what it is, is it like pokemon?"
gamernews,33lhvm,lizardgurl,3,Thu Apr 23 19:38:09 2015 UTC,"Xenoblade Chronicles X is an RPG with a focus on exploration. While it is similar to MMO types of games (like world of warcraft), you will have the storyline typical of an RPG.  There will be a lot to see. If it's even close to it's predecessor on the wii it will have over 400 side quests from townspeople. These quests will connect other characters together and most likely allow you access to more abilities, items, equipment, and areas.  You will be able to explore on foot or in the mechs (called dolls) to ride around or fly through each of the continents. If you have friends who own a wii u you should be able to connect with them and play together to tackle tough monsters or reach new places.  The combat is somewhat similar to Final Fantasy XII or MMOs. Your character will auto attack the targeted enemy with either ranged or melee attacks. You can use Arts (skills) which vary based on each character. Their effectiveness typically relies on your position in the battle (Back Slash for example would do additional damage if you hit the target from the opposite direction they are facing). You'll also be able to fight targets inside your mech with different arts. Either way has it's advantages and disadvantages based on what you're fighting so you have to think about what you're doing.  Overall it's not for everyone but if you like RPG's this might be worth trying if you have the Wii U already."

gamernews,33h8m1,bnfdsl,4,Wed Apr 22 23:48:40 2015 UTC,"This actually raises a good point, Skaven sort of fill the same lore niche as 40k Orks, in that they're by far the most numerous and potentially dangerous race if only they could band together. Orks don't band together of their own volition because they like to smash each other up so much, and Skaven don't do it because of all their crazy political machinations. If Games Workshop did want to stay true to the Warhammer Fantasy lore then Skaven as a faction under player control would legitimately be totally OP.   I suppose they could implement a really strong happiness debuff as a sort of parallel to other Skaven factions taking control of your cities, but that sort of just seems like it would be annoying to play. If they aren't a major faction I could see them using Skaven as the rebel units every time a city revolts, using rebellions to simulate the rats taking a city through pestilence and subterfuge. That said, they're probably just DLC and won't act any differently to the other races what am I even talking about."

The dlc model for the latest total wars have been horrible because all the units are aesthetically similar with slight stat changes (aka barely any effort) but i think warhammer will have more bang for your buck since races and factions look way different and will probably have different magic and animations avaiable to them (unless the price is absurdly high for these)

Keep in mind it was released in 1997   Plus warhammer fantasy has loads of cool stuff that 40k doesn't, like magic, monsters, formations, cavalry and flanking.   Magic in fantasy is basically Warp powers in 40k, including everything from reading peoples minds, influencing them, time travel, immortality, rending peoples souls etc.  Monsters are present too, everything from chaos spawned demons to legitimately monstrous regular life on planets.  The other stuff you listed has its equivalents in 40k too.  Yes it makes more sense for CA to do a fantasy game rather than try 40k, but lets not pretend that 40k strategy games either have to be Dawn of War or Warcraft."

gamernews,33fzb0,Edward_Nygma,3,Wed Apr 22 14:55:19 2015 UTC,Man this game has been on my radar since that first E3 Trailer and I'm still just an excited. The original was so good it'll be hard to live up to it (especially with a silent protagonist).
gamernews,33fzb0,Baryn,2,Thu Apr 23 01:39:37 2015 UTC,i really liked that. this is the game i have been waiting for ever since i bought a wii u a few years back.

gamernews,33fzb0,Shugbug1986,8,Wed Apr 22 07:06:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly most of this game looks great, they just made a few poor character design choices that simply don't go well together with the aesthetic they wanted... The eyes, the skin, the face shape, the hair details, they all just do not work in my opinion. I love anime style characters, but this is as if each individual part was given to a different team with zero communication."
gamernews,33fzb0,tacoman3725,5,Wed Apr 22 08:54:05 2015 UTC,As I understand it they're trying to emulate the style used in the older xeno-series games. In my oppinion they've succeeded but also that style works better in 2d than 3d.
gamernews,33fzb0,Failoe,1 point,Wed Apr 22 09:01:23 2015 UTC,"In my opinion they'd of been better off with something closer to Phantasy Star Online 2's style, which is kinda similar but at the same time it's different."

If you are just talking about Xenoblade I can understand the visuals lacking a bit just due to the sheer scale this game is going to be.
gamernews,33i9a1,FlyingGoldenGoose,4,Wed Apr 22 19:06:17 2015 UTC,I think the gameplay is interesting. Definitely on my watch list. I don't care if people cry about the ultra-violence: it's not worse than say Manhunt or Postal.

It's really kinda interesting actually.   That being said, it's not the ulltra-violence people care about, it's the fact that the game is seemingly about killing innocent people.  I don't really care however. You can go on murderous killing sprees in a bunch of other games and no one cares. Gamesplay does look interesting as well."

gamernews,33ey2s,MilMuertes,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:19:23 2015 UTC,"What an odd coincidence, SmackDown! 2 was the very first wrestling game I ever played.  Anyways, in comparison, SD2 is practically an arcade game.  They've been trying to move to a more simulation-like experience, for better or worse, depending on which you prefer.  The biggest hurdle you'll probably experience will most likely be the controls; they've gotten a bit more complex over the years.  My advice would be to watch a few Let's Plays before deciding whether or not to get it."
gamernews,33ey2s,falconzord,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:45:49 2015 UTC,"That's kind of stupid; since wrestling isn't ""real"", trying to make a simulation game seems like asking for failure.

There have been a few patches to address some (but not all) of the glitches, but my biggest issues with the game are the fact that they removed quite a few of the customization options, and they removed the Highlight Reel replay feature, which allowed you to re-watch the last 10-15 seconds at any angle."

The only thing that kept me plugged in was the story, and after they drove that into the ground with pretty much every post-AC II game, all that was left was the gameplay.  And considering they never change it, it gets old quick. And no, Ubisoft, co-op is not fresh new gameplay. It's a lame gimmick that doesn't improve actual gameplay or combat. Especially when the combat was easy enough already."

Although I did hear that they've completely revamped how melee combat works (in that melee combat works is entirely viable and fun now.)  So yea...  Early access title is Early Access.   Looks like what is there has been polished and will be highly playable, but there's still a decent amount of content still to come.

gamernews,338c39,sonofawitch,43,Mon Apr 20 14:45:32 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  LoL is more gameplay-time grind,  HotS is more calendar-time grind.  If I play roughly 40 minutes every day I can get  12k gold per month in HotS, enough to buy one 10k hero per month.  If I get a first win of the day in League every day (often taking much more than 40m), I can expect approximately 9000 IP per month.  Also enough to buy a 6300 champ, but practically double the time investment.  Also doesn't include days where both games are a loss (for now FWOTD) or days skipped, which HOTS allows with the ability to store up to 3 daily quests.  So if you have a lot of time, you can get more reward by grinding out League games.  But if you are patient you can get a good reward simply by having played HOTS for a long time."

gamernews,338c39,FionaSarah,7,Mon Apr 20 17:01:45 2015 UTC,"ALL of my LoL playing friends, like literally every single one of them, argued that hero unlocks were superior to DotA's system. No joke. They said it encouraged players to ""master one champion"" at a time, and DotA's system made new players overwhelmed with choices. What the fuck kind of Kool Aid are they drinking where grinding for hours and hours for a single champion is in any way superior to having every level unlocked from the beginning?"
gamernews,338c39,FlamingSwaggot,4,Mon Apr 20 23:12:05 2015 UTC,Dota actually has a game mode where you can play a limited amount of heroes if you think you're overwhelmed.
gamernews,338c39,IMSmurf,3,Tue Apr 21 02:11:07 2015 UTC,"lmao Dota 2 starts with limited heroes though anyway to ease you into playing it.  I'd also argue that for the majority of heroes in Dota 2 their names and appearances give away what they're all about, whereas there's no hint at all in LoL - this actually made the game much easier to learn for me but I was lost in LoL. I cared more about what the enemy heroes were all about than my own."
gamernews,338c39,FionaSarah,1 point,Tue Apr 21 10:11:11 2015 UTC,"I think people who have never played a MOBA/MMO before would prefer it that way. It's easier to grasp things when they're given to you one at a time.  Granted I'd prefer having everything unlocked all at once, but they have to make money/give people an incentive to play their game more somehow."
gamernews,338c39,alex70031,12,Thu Apr 23 22:37:48 2015 UTC,"Longtime moba player. It is insane. It's done on purpose so the far superior choice is just to spend real money. So we can say it's ""free to play,"" but actually the cost is hours upon hours of grind.  Furthermore, having a limited selection of heroes is a significant disadvantage competitively. So it's pretty much pay to win too."
gamernews,338c39,ZiRALiX,7,Mon Apr 20 19:50:34 2015 UTC,"Thats one thing I love about Smite - you pay $30 for ALL the characters in the game FOREVER. I bought it in early beta and I've been playing ever since and I still get every character the day they come out. I wish more MOBAs would have this, Infinite Crisis has a character bundle pack too for $30 I believe BUT it doesn't include all NEW characters too I believe... but still, its something. Grinding out characters with in-game currency just takes way too long and a big character pack is amazing to me. I'll gladly throw down $30 on a game I'm enjoying. In LoL and HotS however those characters can be $10 A PIECE. Fuck that >_>"
gamernews,338c39,Nikedawg,5,Mon Apr 20 21:53:52 2015 UTC,"That's whaling monetization for you. From a business perspective the idea is that if you only charge a static price, say $30 or whatever, since some customers are willing to spend much more than that,  you are leaving money on the table. So you should make it possible for them to spend a lot more money so you can ""maximize returns"" on your rich players/customers."
gamernews,338c39,ZiRALiX,3,Mon Apr 20 22:10:05 2015 UTC,You could just play DOTA and not have to pay for heroes at all.

This isn't a grind game and that's why Riot is giving a way to grind faster only playing with friends. Because it's the game experience that counts.   Ok or maybe Im playing for 5 years now and I can't tell how crazy it is trying to get all these awesome champs nowadays.   Patience FTW though"
gamernews,338c39,Goodbye_Kenny,-1,Mon Apr 20 22:58:21 2015 UTC,"See I can't do that though, I don't ""main"" a role in any MOBA. I hop around and I like playing several characters per role. I get bored playing the same character over and over even if its my ""favorite"" (Athena in Smite / Leona in LoL / Aquaman in IC / ect) I cannot play the same character every game. I understand that a lot of people CAN do that but that style just doesn't work for me sadly."
gamernews,338c39,Nikedawg,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:01:12 2015 UTC,It's far from pay to win. A new player with 4-5 hero's shouldn't be playing competitively in the first place.
gamernews,338c39,alex70031,-5,Thu Apr 23 22:38:42 2015 UTC,"Excuse me but that's a pretty ignorant attitude. first of. LoL have, I believe, proven that F2p can be completely non-intrusive, and even sort of a bonus in a weird way.  Throwing a newcomer into a game with 50+ champions all with 4 personal spells (and 2 summoners) will overwhelm even the most hardcore player. So artifically limiting how many champs a new player will encounter in each game, helps new players learn the game first, and then worry about each champion later. Second, it's simply not true that the best champions will always be more expensive. Warwick is played at top level, and he is the cheapest tier champ, same goes for Annie, Amumu, Yi, Nunu, Ryze Sivir. You'll get about 70 IP for each match, double that if you got first win of the day. At 480 for the cheapest champs, it will take you 6 matches (with no IP boost or first win) to buy a new champ (played at top level).  But what about at higher level? Well, at gold or higher it will never become an issue, since you'll have to play a lot to even get there, so you would have already earned enough to at least get all the most important meta champs. And since most players tend to keep in one or two roles, they'll only need the meta champs, for those roles. And for bronze-silver it's simply a nonissue. Ask anyone who have climbed out of bronze, and they will tell you that you can play pretty much any champ and you'll be able to win, as long as you play half decently.  As for HotS. I've only played around 10 matches. but it seems to be, that it isn't so much about what champs you have, as it is about what champs you've played a lot with. Since you have to unlock abilities through play, a Kerrigan player who have played 50 hours + will always have an advantage against someone who just picked up Kerrigan. But I honestly have enough confidence in Blizzards gameplay team, that I wont think it will become a big issue. All you'll have to do is put the abilities with the lowest skill requirement at the bottom, and put the ones with higher risk/reward at the top. But as I said, I haven't played enough to really comment on that."
gamernews,338c39,Draber-Bien,5,Mon Apr 20 22:15:18 2015 UTC,"Second, it's simply not true that the best champions will always be more expensive.    This is a straw man argument; you are arguing an assertion I simply did not make, nor would I make it, because I agree, more expensive does not necessarily equal a better pick, nor does cheap = bad.   But the fact that you wrote that says to me you either did not really try to understand what I was saying or are just arguing for the sake of argument (as opposed to in pursuit of truth), so I have chosen not to read or respond to the rest of your comment."

gamernews,338c39,FionaSarah,4,Tue Apr 21 10:09:14 2015 UTC,"I prefer it because its much less daunting to have 6 characters to decide between rather than 100. I played dota for almost 100 hours and I never felt like I understood any character very well, but I was forced into playing the first characters I bought in HotS and League and learned them much better because of it."
gamernews,338c39,adledog,-5,Mon Apr 20 21:18:15 2015 UTC,"What part of it are you unable to comprehend?  If the game is not completely unbalanced you should be able to do just fine with having only access to a fraction of the entire champion pool. It's like saying ""I can't comprehend not having every possible card available."" in a TCG. If you're missing a card you either find a substitute (analog: a hero you already own) or you invest time/money to get the card."
gamernews,338c39,Mirodir,9,Mon Apr 20 17:36:04 2015 UTC,"Yeh, but you hit on a problem there. In mobas with purchasable heroes, in order to not have the game unbalanced, you have to actually design all the characters in a very flat way, making them all fit a rather generic role and be able to substitute for one another without any significant impact on power levels.  So you are actually limiting the diversity of the game by including unlockable characters.  That's why ultimately I settled on Dota 2, not just because all the heroes are unlocked, but because the way the heroes are designed, it's essential that they are all unlocked, since there's a lot more counterplay and tactics surrounding the diverse ability sets of all the heroes."
gamernews,338c39,Xet,17,Mon Apr 20 18:17:26 2015 UTC,"Except you have to be miserable while doing it if you are going to play so little. Want to play a certain hero? Too bad, you have to play as a StarCraft hero today.  And that's assuming you don't want to play ranked, where daily quests do not even matter unless you are an asshole that picks a Diablo support when your team needs a Hammer or whatever.  Even then, someone did the math and it's still way more expensive than LoL, both in gold and real money."
gamernews,338c39,sonofawitch,4,Mon Apr 20 15:39:11 2015 UTC,they added more gold bonuses for reaching new account and hero levels since that math was done

gamernews,338c39,ZiRALiX,3,Mon Apr 20 19:57:35 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly casual, play a few nights a week with friends, and I think it's just the mindset. Play quick match and try new heroes and do quests, level each hero to 5 for the extra gold, and before you know it you'll own 10 heroes that you enjoy and you can start on ranked modes.  Don't think of it as a gold grind, just play the game and the gold will come."
gamernews,338c39,Meatt,11,Mon Apr 20 16:03:57 2015 UTC,"Well, you can say that about every F2P ever. It doesn't make it any fairer."

gamernews,338c39,Meatt,3,Mon Apr 20 19:38:51 2015 UTC,"Main? I'm not sure that you've ever played Dota, because most people don't really ""main"" anyone. I'll play pretty much any hero that isn't a hard support fairly regularly, and I think most players that aren't new would say the same. Of course everyone has a favorite hero, but because of the way that counterpicks work you're strongly discouraged from just playing a couple, so being able to play a lot of heroes is extremely helpful. I said ""before you know it"" to mimic you, since you were defending a practice that I find to be despicable in any competitive multiplayer game (locking away important gameplay content behind a paywall/grind). The point is that in comparison to other games in the genre, HotS is much less fair in its use of microtransactions/grinding. They do not benefit the game in any way in comparison to giving everyone every hero for free."

You earn gold for buying characters much faster than you earn IP in League, especially while leveling up. There are character/skin sales weekly, which put characters at around 3.50$. You can also try out any character in a practice match, so you don't buy someone you'll hate. There's also a starter pack with three characters, three skins, and a mount for 5$. Also, unlike League, there are skins and color palettes you get for leveling a character up. I hated HotS in alpha but I gave it another shot recently and they really turned it around."

It's pretty much been the only game I've played. So while there are other things to take into account, it is by far faster than league of legends in terms of buying a hero. Especially with the new gold bonuses they added in.  I bought all my league champions with IP just like I did HOTS and it took me something like a year and a half. I'm missing the two newest champions in league though.  Granted league has what 130 champions now? 120? Hots has barely 40 I think."
gamernews,338c39,grey_sky,2,Thu Apr 23 22:44:39 2015 UTC,"I've been playing it a lot because it's much more relaxing than Dota 2.  I tried playing Dota 2 again, and the controls feel very clunky now.  There are certainly things that I like better in Dota 2, like pinging abilities too inform the team about being OOM or on cool down.  I was playing as Uther last night and some ass was complaining that I wasn't healing.  Would have been nice to be able to ping that my abilities were on CD.  I really wish it was skin based profit rather than character.  They could have even likely set up a market like Steam has for items too.  Characters are god damn expensive, and some skins are the same price or more expensive.  I don't plan to every purchase anything for real money because I don't want to support it.  Also there's the stimpacks that double XP/gold which costs like 10 bucks a month if you pay for it monthly.  So if you want to get heroes at a more decent rate (which will still take forever) you could be paying for WoW or something.  Furthermore, it's nice they have free heroes each week, but it's also kind of stale seeing everybody playing the same heroes.  So to sum it up, it's expensive and in my opinion not work paying anything for, but the gameplay itself is pretty fun."

There are daily quests that give gold, when you level your profile get gold, and when you level Hero (each hero has an overall level) you get gold. I've been playing for 2 months and own 12 Heroes and have enough gold to buy a 7,000 gold hero but I'm saving up for a master skin."
gamernews,338c39,grey_sky,5,Mon Apr 20 14:46:31 2015 UTC,"I think it's structured better from a player experience perspective on rewards. It's nice to see those big chunks of gold for doing quests and leveling heroes, so it might feel like you're getting more out of HotS.  Objectively though, it is significantly worse than LoL as far as time investment goes. The gold rewards for winning games are pathetic, and abysmal for losing.

Each day you get a quest that can equal 200, 300, 500, or 800 gold. Leveling a hero to level 5 will net you 500 gold but at levels 15 and 20 you get 3750 gold and you can do this for literally ALL 35 characters. Leveling to level 40 profile will net you 18000 gold (2,000g every few levels). Heros cost 10,000g, 7,000g, 4,000, and 2,000.   You can have your first 10,000 gold hero playing casually 1-3 matches (which last only 20 mins and will net you 30g a win) a night for a week. I recommend leveling ALL FREE rotation characters to level 5 which can take 2-4 games a character.   I found unlocks, when compared to LoL, to be A LOT easier.

But getting ""enough"" stuff for most people is extremely realistic.  It's also worth noting that heroes are the only gameplay elements to have to buy. They don't have runes like LoL or pets like Strife or whatever. They were planning to introduce a similar system, but the players didn't like it, so they just got rid of it."

gamernews,338c39,JakalDX,-5,Mon Apr 20 20:09:48 2015 UTC,"To me ""not thinking much and being very casual"" means having low awareness of objectives, chasing murky, trying to fight all the time even when you shouldn't (like at a level 9-10 disadvantage), and I consider those things low-level play/not playing to win. You have a point though.  I've got you matched despite having only 20 days vs your 3 months and having played a lot less games. You might say that's even better proof of the game not being very deep, but to me what that says is if you had taken a less casual approach, you would actually have made a lot more progress, instead of just breaking even with a 20-day player. It looks like at 20 days, your mmr was 2300-2400.  Perhaps our views are different because despite being close in mmr, I don't consider myself very good while you hold a higher opinion of your own ranking.  What specifically do you think hots missing that makes it shallow compared to other mobas?"
gamernews,338c39,ZiRALiX,7,Mon Apr 20 20:48:25 2015 UTC,"I'm no Diamond so take my analysis with a grain of salt, but taking farm out of the game eliminates a huge objective. Making creeps not worth gold doesn't just skip laning phase, it removes the ability to use creep waves as pressure. In League, for example, you can create a huge wave by causing it to slow push, and this creates a timer on the map in a sense. Either the wave pushes, the other team loses a large amount of potential gold and experience, and even a tower if the wave is strong enough, or they devote resources to clearing it and give up map pressure elsewhere. Removing gold from the game removes a huge statistic that needs to be addressed. It reduces the complexity of the game only having XP as well, since items and skills get bundled together with levels. Compare the itemization in DotA 2 to what you can do in HotS. It's not even close to the level of complexity.  The game essentially has no economy, which means you can't use the economy as a weapon against your opponent. You can't starve someone from farm, because they don't have to get it. Laning is basically everyone camping in a lane until its time to group for the first global objective, and thats about it.  Not to mention the mechanical complexity of the game is pretty lacking. The fact that Zuna was able to come in and be a top player doesn't say much about how much it takes to learn."
gamernews,338c39,Played_Out_Monkey,-1,Mon Apr 20 21:42:39 2015 UTC,"I think you have a great point about the absence of gold resulting in lower overall complexity. I haven't played DotA in a long time so I'm not that knowledgeable about it but I'd agree it's a more complex game as well. OTOH though I think some of the things that create additional complexity don't necessarily make it a better experience for players. For example, hero kills going to the last-hitter creating the mechanic of kill-stealing. I used to just play pubs on wc3 b.net and sometimes I'd accidentally steal the kill while just trying to do as much damage as possible, sometimes I'd last hit on purpose because it looked like they would get away otherwise; there would be disagreements and insults about stuff like that. I think it's nice that in hots that's one thing I don't have to worry about.  edit: I wonder what the game might look like if gold were in the game, and shared (for lack of better word) as well. I.e. when gold is gained, everyone gains it in the same amount."
gamernews,338c39,Platanium,1 point,Mon Apr 20 23:29:32 2015 UTC,"WC3 Dota =/= Dota 2 in the slightest. The game has evolved so much and is much more balanced from the early WC3 days and the average player is so much better as well. HoTS being more casual is not a knock against it or anything- it's exactly what Blizz is trying to do- it is objectively much more simple in every aspect when compared to LoL and Dota 2 (THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING!) However, I just don't enjoy their take on it tbh and find that it does end up losing depth when cutting out the complexity."

Last hitting, denying, builds, item decisions, experience efficiency has less personal responsibility, and plenty of other reasons. It's the appeal for some that may make the game more approachable. Definitely what people like, taking those mechanics out and it boils down to player preference for what's ""better"" but either way there's less depth to the game. It's like comparing Hearthstone to Magic. Jakal does a decent job explaining it as well  Only reason I brought up ranking is because you said playing the game casually would result in silver forever which is 100% untrue which was my point. I'm just saying that you can definitely play the game without really putting in effort and still do fine. The game is casual to the very core. Nothing wrong with that, but don't try to make it out to be more than it is as far as depth and complexity"

It's not suited to certain internet connections I guess, (unless it's actually a graphics/driver problem, which is also likely) but I don't think that is any different from a lot of other online games.

gamernews,338c39,Noir_,4,Mon Apr 20 15:30:45 2015 UTC,No new anything.  More announcement of announcements.  6 week+ patches make things a bit stale with the current limited hero pool.  Woo open beta and all that but there's nothing exciting right now for current players especially considering the gigantic influx of newbies that will significantly decrease the quality of quick match for a few weeks after open beta.  I'd also like to add that the game is VERY poorly optimized and needs some serious work.
gamernews,338c39,NSNick,3,Mon Apr 20 15:33:01 2015 UTC,That's what most people said when they actually started playing the game.
gamernews,338c39,Noir_,2,Mon Apr 20 15:33:10 2015 UTC,"Very debatable, but I think a lot of HotS game design decisions are so polarizing that it'll prevent it from being the best. Good? Absolutely. I know people who love it. But there are design decisions that I consider fundamentally flawed that prevent it from being an objective best."
gamernews,338c39,NSNick,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:50:56 2015 UTC,What are the most glaring examples in your opinion?
gamernews,338c39,Noir_,2,Mon Apr 20 14:59:42 2015 UTC,"The big thing for me is kind of a perfect storm situation. First off, we have team levels, which means that one bad person your team can put your whole team behind. This in and of itself isn't bad, as HotS is a team game, but being a level behind puts you at a distinct disadvantage in team fights. Not too terrible, since there are other objectives like merc camps you can sneak and use as a way to catch back up, but you run into a real problem with event objectives.   Event objectives happen at a certain time and have a great reward for securing them, so they work as team fight beacons, ensuring that the game doesn't become a PvE snoozefest. So teams must contest these objectives in order to secure them, since sneaking them (like a dragon or Baron or Roahon) is by and large not possible. The problem now is that the team a level or more behind absolutely cannot contest this objective because level advantage is almost everything in team fights.  So the team behind can lose the objective contest by throwing themselves against the brick wall that is the higher level team or by taking the consolation prize of merc camps. To me, this is a lose lose situation, an unbearably oppressive snowball mechanic. The talent spec system also feeds a bit into this, as the specialization options aren't really that extreme so there's little in the way of ""building"" to counter.  I also find the stealth to be done quite poorly from a gameplay standpoint. The ripple effect is simultaneously hard and easy to see, meaning that sneaking essentially comes down to the graphics settings and awareness of the non-stealthed player. I'm also not a big fan of how quickly characters can restealth. Personally, I don't think that stealth is something that should be on by default without some kind of counterplay/downside. At least in DotA, you have true sight wards and Dust of Appearance. The only thing you can do in HotS is throw out a skill shot to confirm that yes, the stealthed person is there, because time to kill in HotS is kind of ridiculously long. A stealthed character getting caught should equal extreme punishment in my mind."
gamernews,338c39,Moxormog,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:30:35 2015 UTC,"In regards to the objective clumping, I think they've somewhat mitigated this with different maps with multiple concurrent objectives, like Sky Temple with its up-to-3 simultaneous objectives, or Spider Queen's Tomb, with its ongoing gem collection and depositing. This splits the importance from solely levels to also numbers (5v4, etc.). I think not having one single map helps them to try to continually work this balance as they develop new maps as well.  As for stealth, that's definitely a touchier subject, but I will point out that AoE effects and skillshots decloak enemies, and there are a number of traits and talents that can help, like Tassadar's Oracle, Tyrande's Shadowstalk, and Rehgar's Farsight."
gamernews,338c39,Bloodhound01,2,Mon Apr 20 19:37:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah the newer maps definitely have some improvements but they're still too snowbally for my tastes. Demoralization comes quick for the losing team.  As for stealth, popping enemies out of it never feels good to me because they're back in stealth so soon. Maybe the lack of CC is what creates this feeling, since revealed stealth champs just walk away and restealth instead of blow up."

The spreadsheets you're talking about are just used by people who are new to the game. A good player will make their own decisions about items and skill builds based on the situations of the game- which is why the games are so enjoyable, you end up with a great sense of choice and you really do develop an individual play style.   The higher you are in skill the better you're able to express your understanding of the game through your builds and approach to the game. None of this is happening in the game- this is all just your idea of the game and how to approach the current meta.   After all that it's just down execution and if you have what it takes to make the things you like on paper work in the game. Some games are completely won in Dota/LoL because of being able to out think your opponents on a very critical level. I feel like the mental part of the game is completely taken out of HoTS for the most part (obviously there's going to always be some amount of strategy if you're taking objectives) and you're just left with the execution and a minimal amount of strategy when compared to the other MOBAs- which while interesting is not why I play these games."

I am pretty relaxed with playing. After the latest patch, I got a stimpack and that helped boost my gold output (that first hit is free), and decided since I put in months of playtime, more than usual games, I decided throw in another 10 dollars for a month long stimpack. I should be level capped after this pack has finished.   That has boosted my gold winning a lot.   But for me, it is not so much mining for gold, it is just playing the game. I will eventually put in 50 dollars to get some skins or mounts, but I think that is fair given how much I have played the game.

Shao Jun, the protagonist of Chronicles China, also had a major role in the AC short movie, Embers. The protagonists in the other Chronicles are two of the protagonists seen in the AC graphic novels.

gamernews,339jjl,ayotornado,-2,Mon Apr 20 21:37:05 2015 UTC,"I mean the idea more than the game but yeah looks like it fits the IOS  model by stealing mark of the ninja's design. I wish they took this concept, the female Chinese assassin, and made a real AC game with it..."

gamernews,337x51,filthy_sandwich,2,Mon Apr 20 17:24:12 2015 UTC,It's impossible to say it normally after seeing that video.
gamernews,337x51,CarpetFibers,2,Mon Apr 20 17:30:21 2015 UTC,This is a great premise for a game creator with limited resources. It makes the player investigate every nook and cranny of routine that exists in that single day.

I'm a huge fan of the series and at this point I dont have a doubt in my mind they are gonna make up for origins."
gamernews,3379oi,yeeeaaaarrrgggh,6,Mon Apr 20 06:30:20 2015 UTC,"It wasn't the same developers on Origins, so you are right not to worry."
gamernews,3379oi,Sidtreefish,2,Mon Apr 20 06:40:36 2015 UTC,rocksteady north I think? the game is still a glitchy mess.
gamernews,3379oi,yeeeaaaarrrgggh,5,Mon Apr 20 07:24:31 2015 UTC,"No, it was made by WB Games Montreal and Splash Damage. And yes, it was a buggy mess. I still had fun with it, though it is by no means on the same level as the previous two games."
gamernews,3379oi,Sidtreefish,4,Mon Apr 20 07:27:53 2015 UTC,Origins has the best character models imo. In the other ones Batman's face looks a bit...derpy.
gamernews,3379oi,ThaddeusMaximus,3,Mon Apr 20 11:51:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Origins is pretty much good if you enjoyed the combat of the other games and just wanted more of it. The predator sections were pretty meh, and the boss fights were terrible (but, Freeze excluded, they always seem to be in Batman games). The worst, though, was the Deathstroke fight, which is clearly reminiscent of the R'as al-Ghul fight without any of the buildup or setting that made the R'as fight interesting."

gamernews,339f1y,carzy91,2,Mon Apr 20 23:59:31 2015 UTC,Man... I'm so disappointed there's no single player story. You'd think that with all the Disney and EA resources pumped into this game that a well thought out original Star Wars adventure would be possible :(
gamernews,339f1y,WeirdDudeInElevator,6,Mon Apr 20 19:53:18 2015 UTC,Battlefront was never a campaign heavy game. EA is preparing a Star Wars single player game made by Visceral Games (the developers of Dead Space).
gamernews,339f1y,Madkat124,3,Mon Apr 20 20:30:31 2015 UTC,"On top of that, DICE just suck at campaigns. If I'm not mistaken, they even said they're considering taking them out of future Battlefield games."
gamernews,339f1y,valentinbk,3,Mon Apr 20 22:29:02 2015 UTC,That would actually be a great move. More attention to the multiplayer and no resources going on an uninteresting campaign
gamernews,339f1y,Spawn_Beacon,5,Tue Apr 21 00:21:04 2015 UTC,"Most likely a significant increase in MP map numbers ready for release day, that will be excluded and sold as DLC."

gamernews,3321vk,TweetPoster,5,Sat Apr 18 19:39:03 2015 UTC,People who have played this game: does it get better than the demo?
gamernews,3321vk,Keytap,6,Sun Apr 19 00:15:44 2015 UTC,Yes. I really enjoy the narrative.
gamernews,3321vk,ampex440c,5,Sun Apr 19 00:54:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's superb."
gamernews,3321vk,sturmeh,3,Sun Apr 19 03:49:23 2015 UTC,"Best episodic game ive played so far, even more so then walking dead"
gamernews,3321vk,Chasedabigbase,2,Sun Apr 19 09:11:56 2015 UTC,You're gonna get downvoted but it's true. Life is Strange did what Telltale's games did way better.
gamernews,3321vk,thedieversion,3,Sun Apr 19 17:36:33 2015 UTC,"Not going to downvote, but I disagree with that. 'Way better' seems like pretty extreme hyperbole.  I like Life is Strange a lot, but some of the faux-teen stuff is grating and the plot (so far) hasn't got nearly the weight of Walking Dead of Wolf Among Us."
gamernews,3321vk,i_literally_died,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:42:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed. And in both episodes I faced bugs related to the time-change powers, making me restart from a checkpoint."

gamernews,3321vk,downvote_heaven,11,Sun Apr 19 02:05:08 2015 UTC,Good game! Can't wait to play more.
gamernews,3321vk,DustbinJ,6,Sat Apr 18 20:03:57 2015 UTC,I agree- it's been very enjoyable so far. Episode 2's ending makes it clear that our actions will have consequences.
gamernews,3321vk,mikeburnfire,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:54:58 2015 UTC,In what sense? I thought the dialogue was pretty good.
gamernews,3321vk,comady25,6,Sat Apr 18 21:12:09 2015 UTC,"Say am I the only one that is rather put off then excited with episodic releases like this? People seem to go crazy about it. Rather then "" Omg it continuous""  it feels like "" so why didn't they push the whole game? "" and after a while I just don't care about it anymore."
gamernews,3321vk,LaronX,11,Sun Apr 19 19:12:55 2015 UTC,"It's pretty obvious that the episodes are being worked on in real time, so it isn't like we are missing out on the full story being available immediately as much as we are getting the episodes delivered as quickly as possible.   I can say it is kind if exciting having episodes. Since I picked the game up for super cheap pre release, I have something to be excited about every few months at no extra cost to myself.   People who want the whole story at once could always wait until the final episode and start playing when it releases."
gamernews,3321vk,coheedcollapse,4,Sun Apr 19 07:28:20 2015 UTC,"People who want the whole story at once could always wait until the final episode and start playing when it releases.   Well my point with that was by then I lost interested. There is a ton of games coming out and  ton of more media to experience.  Being ""forced"" into a episodic schedule made me drop the games in the past. I just stopped caring. I guess they are not for me."
gamernews,3321vk,LaronX,6,Sun Apr 19 07:55:40 2015 UTC,"If you'd lost interest because of the time in which it was released, maybe you weren't interested in the first place? All of that content and plot and characters (or whatever) that made you interested in the game is still there."
gamernews,3321vk,SolidFoot,2,Sun Apr 19 08:20:20 2015 UTC,I did. But I also like other stuff. With limited time I will choose the stuff I started while it was on break and was contentiously doing over some tiny bit of something that was good. But so was the stuff I was doing / watching now and it would end on a random cliffhanger.
gamernews,3321vk,LaronX,3,Sun Apr 19 13:55:23 2015 UTC,"Well what I think is there's two sides to this on the same coin for the reason of why there are episodic game releases   Not enough money to make the whole game, so putting episodes would fund the next stage of making the game. Some people think it's kind of cool of having ""In the next episode"" and leaving some kind of cliffhanger at the end.   Mostly it's the first reason."
gamernews,3321vk,LaronX,0,Sun Apr 19 15:51:01 2015 UTC,I don't know about point one. Telltale probably has the money and still does it and the guys behind this game have it published by Square Enix. It is by no means a small indi game.   As for the second. I guess. I was never a fan of cliffhangers. They are exiting but after the 3 time it gets annoying or by the time the series continues the excitement is gone for me.
gamernews,3321vk,LaronX,1 point,Sun Apr 19 07:48:01 2015 UTC,"True about them not needing any money, but they 'want' money and they found this way to do it because of reason #2, and plus it's kind of  like releasing a new game/expansion but not really, so marketing would be easier ""guess what? WE'RE RELEASING EP.X! GET EXCITED!"" see what I mean? so the game still gets to be relevant for a long time."
gamernews,3321vk,Chasedabigbase,1 point,Sun Apr 19 08:23:49 2015 UTC,"For some people. I guess that is true. For me it is more "" LOOOK WE GONE SELL YOU PART OF THE GAME YAY BE HAPPY!"" I guess it is simply not meant for me. But you probably correct."
gamernews,3321vk,SolidFoot,3,Sun Apr 19 10:22:28 2015 UTC,"I agree I'm usually not a big episodic fan, but LIS actually has done a really great job with it so far.  Had sp good discussions between 1 and 2 about our theories and predictions"
gamernews,3321vk,LaronX,3,Sun Apr 19 13:38:56 2015 UTC,How do you feel about regular TV shows that come out every week and take ~5 months to complete?
gamernews,3321vk,thedieversion,5,Sun Apr 19 09:11:03 2015 UTC,I ignore them until they are fully out. That's why I like service like netflix.
gamernews,3321vk,LaronX,3,Sun Apr 19 13:49:04 2015 UTC,Netflix doesn't have everything immediately though. Why wait when you can watch along with everyone else earlier?
gamernews,3321vk,thedieversion,1 point,Sun Apr 19 15:14:10 2015 UTC,Why care that everyone else is watching? I don't know about you. But my friends respect that I didn't see stuff and try to no spoiler it. Doesn't work most of the time. But by the time I get around to watch it I will have forgotten it.  I rather have a complete story the felt nice over cliffhanger moments that resolve themselves 5-10 min into the next episode( even worse it if is in the first 2 min and has no impact at all).
gamernews,3321vk,iaoth,2,Sun Apr 19 17:38:43 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean that it matters if you watch it when everyone else watches. Poor phrasing. I just meant, if you're interested in a show, you'd want to watch it immediately when it's out. Plus, cliffhangers between episodes keep it well paced and you have something to look forward to each week."
gamernews,3321vk,LaronX,2,Sun Apr 19 17:59:09 2015 UTC,"If you have time and interest left to do that, why can't you play a game when all the episodes are out? What's the difference?"
gamernews,3321vk,Moonshatter89,1 point,Sun Apr 19 21:52:34 2015 UTC,"If I don't forget the game I try to get around and play it. I recently did with the wolf among us. But I just had forgotten about it until I saw someone mention it again. The ""hype "" for the games pretty much dies out after the last episode is out for a month."
gamernews,3321vk,binarian,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:10:38 2015 UTC,"I get the impression that even though they have gone so far as to title each episode before their release, they may be making small alterations in real time to how the overall narrative plays out based on previous decisions by players for future episodes."
gamernews,3321vk,AtsuiPanda,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:21:16 2015 UTC,"Indeed. If you go back and watch the director's commentary on Sam & Max Season 1, they explicitly state that they changed some details about later episodes based on what people were saying about earlier episodes online.

gamernews,331u1d,Kennigit,-12,Sat Apr 18 22:03:13 2015 UTC,"Many Holocaust revisionists point to Jewish support of Hitler (and Stalin) as a reason to deny the ""senseless"" murder of millions of European ""Jews,"" Gypsies, and Armenians in the early 20th century. I believe they are barking up the wrong tree.  I am Jewish. I was adopted by a Jewish family as a baby. I was circumcized (against my biological mother's wishes). I had a Bar Mitzvah. I was a member of the ZBT fraternity. I was on the inaugural Birthright Israel trip. I spent my entire professional career as a real estate investor and private equity advisor. I personally know several powerful Zionist billionaires. I am as much of a Jew as anyone.  There is a reason Jews supported Hitler: Hitler was right.  I know genocide is a scary concept, but try to look at it this way, if you will. In the early 20th century, Ashkenazi ""Jewish"" bank scams, media lies, and collective economic terrorism nearly destroyed Europe. Then Hitler and Stalin woke up, repaired their economies, and slaughtered 90% of the European ""Jewish"" population (excluding the authentic German Jews).  The result was a century of peace and prosperity on the continent. But some survived, reproduced, and a century later their descendants repeated the same atrocious usury and have again brought Europe to it's knees. Not to mention the havoc raged by the phony Satanic ""Jews"" that fled Europe to America.  Imagine how much better life would be for everyone if Hitler killed them all. Sometimes the truth is a hard pill to swallow.  These animals are not Jews. They are really just a cooperative and educated band of Gypsies (descendants of the Egyptian Pharoah) otherwise known as ""The Seed of Amalek."" These ""people"" are a subhuman devil species incapable of the emotion ""love.""  In exile, they converted to Judaism to shelter themselves from the genocide God commands. The Holy Torah (and Bible, and Koran) commands God's real children to wipe their entire race from existence because they ALWAYS repeat these same crimes against humanity.  It is simply in their DNA, and so long as they are allowed to exist, they will repeat the same atrocities. Today, genocide violates international law, but most men and women understand that God's word supercedes the Geneva Convention.  None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who care not who makes the rules. It is Time.  ***For educational and discussion purposes only. I do not condone violence or unlawfulness. There are legal and peaceful solutions to the Jewish question. I only intend to spark this very necessary discussion."

gamernews,32y0yi,davidt0504,18,Fri Apr 17 20:44:19 2015 UTC,"Well we've probably had a total of 5 minutes of ""trailer"" footage so far, without anything in-game being revealed, so I wouldn't be too quick to make assumptions like that. There's like 10 base maps in battlefield 4, and that's not including the many DLC packs.  It's still very early for the developers to be releasing huge details like what kind of levels there's going to be and what the gameplay is going to be like. Once we get closer to release (like 2 months before), i'm very sure there's going to be more.  They've only showed Endor and Hoth because those are the most popular and memorable ""grand scale"" type settings in star wars."

gamernews,32y0yi,forresja,145,Sat Apr 18 16:52:49 2015 UTC,"""Game engine footage"" is a vastly different statement than ""in-game footage"".  This is all pre-rendered. Do NOT expect the game to look anywhere near this good or to have character animations anything like that.  I'm excited for the game, but boy do I hate misleading game trailers.  Edit: People have a problem with the word ""pre-rendered"". There is no real word for what the developers are doing. It's simply deception. I just didn't want to use language that might be perceived as hostile to the developer, but here we are.   What people are failing to understand is that these scenes are in fact from the game engine, but literally everything you see is scripted in a very careful way.  All the scenes are carefully created using as few assets as possible. They record their 2-10 seconds clips, tear everything down (not literally, that's not how game engines work), and move on to create another new small highly detailed scene to shoot the next shot. This allows the developers to go scene by scene cranking up the texture resolution, lighting (shadows), and asset density while still keeping everything ""in engine"", but not ""in-game"" or ""gameplay"". Notice the difference please.  They are recording this footage in highly detailed ""sets"" within the engine. There is nothing outside these sets, just like a normal movie set. If you take that level of detail and apply it to an entire map, it simply will not work.  Yes, this can all be done ""in engine"", but it cannot be ""in engine"" with 64 players on a full-sized map. Sorry, but that's simply not the reality of our hardware."
gamernews,32y0yi,BassheadPanda,26,Fri Apr 17 17:57:28 2015 UTC,"It's all part of a massive marketing campaign to generate hype because they know the final product will be a top seller, regardless of how close the actual gameplay will be to this.  I think everybody would rather see in-game footage but it just makes sense to hold that stuff for E3.  To a marketing team, an in-engine trailer is better than no trailer at all.  If it was another cinematic, people would be bitching even more about that.  I'll take the in-engine trailer for hype-building sake, and to give a glimpse of the direction of the vision."

A fine example of marketing, overzealous fans, and pre-ordering having a largely negative impact on the game industry. It's not all bad of course, but there are plenty of ""corporate"" people that now realize that putting a lot of money into advertising does more for sales than it ever would going into the game itself.  Which is why you see so many pre-order bonuses now! They want to lock that sale in early because they honestly don't care what happens afterwards. Sad but true. Same reason so many game reviewers end up with contract clauses that prevent them from releasing their review of the game until launch day or later."

gamernews,32y0yi,MikeSaidFred,14,Fri Apr 17 18:58:04 2015 UTC,"Pre-rendered is completely different. In engine means at most the events were stagged but the graphics and everything would still be close to that of ingame, whether this will be what consoles look like, probably not, but pre-rendered would look much better than this."
gamernews,32y0yi,lordcat,10,Fri Apr 17 18:22:45 2015 UTC,"It means that the game will be capable of creating graphics that look that good, but it does not mean that you will get a playable frame-rate with those graphics.  That could easily be being rendered at 1fps, sped up to the correct speed.  Although, even if it is 'staged' and rendered at 1fps, there is hope that future graphics cards could be powerful enough to render it at reasonable frame-rates., so it could very well look that good on hardware released in 2020."
gamernews,32y0yi,MikeSaidFred,2,Fri Apr 17 20:17:55 2015 UTC,"Again, pre-rendered and in engine are two different things. If they wanted to prerender that would look a lot clearer and a lot more smooth.   By stagged i mean they used in game assets and animations on a script to give you the scenes instead of being controlled by a player. That's why there are some jagged movements for the characters and some rough edges. Yes this is generally smoother than game play as the camera is in a set position and moves on a track making it easier on the engine to render but it's not ""pre-rendered"" nor is it safe to say game play wont be that smooth  Pre-Rendered implies they just took it in a 3d application with higher resolution models and made a movie out of it and took the time to render each frame, generally much longer than a single second a frame. I'm all for calling that out, but this isn't clearly pre-rendered.  This doesn't look that over the top for what games have done recently. I don't know how often while playing GTA V this week i stopped and thought about how damn pretty the game is. Mind you my machine is slightly beefier than most at a 980 but AAA games have never really been about toning it down, especially for when you're giving a teaser trailer.   Like i said to start, doubt this is what consoles will look like, but for high graphics settings on PC, not that far fetched, my man. Direct X 11 and 12 can do some pretty amazing things with the hardware that is available now, and by the end of the year i don't think we'll be thinking the same thing."
gamernews,32y0yi,Tangy92,4,Fri Apr 17 20:33:48 2015 UTC,"'Pre-rendered' does not mean that they used a 3d application or any of that. It's a common technique to create the cutscene in the engine then render it at ridiculous settings, then use the rendered frames to make a smooth video. Although the cutscene is 'in-engine', it definitely does not imply it is rendered in real-time."
gamernews,32y0yi,DaHolk,2,Fri Apr 17 21:53:19 2015 UTC,"Pre-Rendered implies they just took it in a 3d application with higher resolution models and made a movie out of it and took the time to render each frame, generally much longer than a single second a frame.   Except for the misconception that this 3D application can't very well be the engine, this is correct.  Pre-rendered is the opposite of real time. But ""in engine"" doesn't imply real time. Nor does it imply asset quality being the same, or particle effects being realistic. You are confusing in game footage with in engine footage."
gamernews,32y0yi,Shishakli,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:18:37 2015 UTC,You can also expect a ton of cinematic post effects to be applied to this trailer...
gamernews,32y0yi,DaHolk,0,Fri Apr 17 22:46:37 2015 UTC,"but pre-rendered would look much better than this.   Not if it is pre-rendered within that engine, with assets they produce for the game. (which still doesn't mean they WILL be in the game come launch)"
gamernews,32y0yi,FallenWyvern,3,Fri Apr 17 20:28:32 2015 UTC,"If I might remind you, the Fallout 3 trailer was pre-rendered using in game assets. That is, they took the assets (textures/meshes/sound) and brought it into something to render it out.   That doesn't mean it's bad. Just, don't buy the game NOW based on this video. This is still cool stuff.  Edit: The 'something' to render it out is still their engine, but like Source Filmmaker, they can touch that stuff up so that while it's not real time (because of post-processing effects, or to get around engine limitations like view distance) and then show people what they intend without it being representative of the final product."
gamernews,32y0yi,SupaBloo,6,Fri Apr 17 18:31:14 2015 UTC,"At this point, anyone who thinks any game will look like that is delusional. It shouldn't even need to be said that the game won't look like that.

gamernews,32y0yi,timewarp,6,Fri Apr 17 18:26:11 2015 UTC,GTA V for the PC is pretty close to this in terms of quality.
gamernews,32y0yi,SupaBloo,2,Fri Apr 17 18:58:33 2015 UTC,"To me, there is a clear distinction between what is cutscene footage and what is actual gameplay. No matter how good looking you make gameplay, it's really easy to tell the difference between gameplay and cutscenes.  GTA V does look good, but it does not look this good. The motion is not as smooth, the textures aren't as perfect, the explosions and animations are not as dynamic. It does look good, but nearly as good as this video."
gamernews,32y0yi,Saerain,2,Fri Apr 17 19:04:05 2015 UTC,"Hm. I was thinking that the animation seemed clearly scripted for this sequence, but as far as everything else I look at this and see either a modern PC game or a pre-rendered cutscene from 2001."
gamernews,32y0yi,uberphoenix,2,Sat Apr 18 10:49:34 2015 UTC,"Game engine is what the game will be running on. If you want an example of pre-rendered then any of Final Fantasy's trailers will give you that. This was an animated sequence using the games engine as if you was seeing an in game cut scene. So this is most likely what the game will look like, albeit without the perfect control of those speeder bikes lol.  I'm just sad its all episode 4-6 stuff, hopefully they add dlc for 1-3"

All that ""in engine"" says is ""the software we use can technically produce these images"". Not that it WILL do so in the finished product.

I'm sure these things exist within the engine, but this is a precisely crafted cinematic. Scenes are shot carefully and separately. There are no additional assets in each scene so that the lighting and texture quality can be cranked up to 11. This is easy to do when you're working with a fraction of the models that will actually exist on a full battlefield. The asset density alone would be enough to bring a lot of low-end computers to their knees. Textures and lighting will make it a lot worse.  I don't know what you did at EA, but I'm pretty experienced with Max, Maya, UE3, Unity, ZBrush, etc... As in, I was dumb enough to get an art degree and actually go to school for game design.  I believe that you've seen a presentation from the DICE team, but I also believe that you're not someone that actually knows how game design works.

Asset re-use? What are you on about? I'm not talking about re-use. Of course there are multiple instances of the same asset you monkey. I'm saying that having 200 trees with 4096+ texture resolution isn't feasible. The textures in that ""footage"" are 2048 at MINIMUM, likely higher depending on how close the particular asset is to the camera. It doesn't matter that the assets are re-used. Your computer would still have to render a lot of these trees at once. They kept the density of the assets high in each scene, but outside of each separate shot, there is nothing else going on. There is no rest of the battlefield. No lighting/shadowing, no assets, nothing.  Pretty easy to render something like that on a normal computer. Full-size battlefield? Not so much.   brilliant analysis. tell me, what do you mean by ""asset density""? do you mean loading a small set of unique assets and instancing them so they don't take up too much resources, LOD'ing and culling out the ones not in camera? oh right, you probably don't actually know what the fuck you're talking about, i won't bother   Literally the number of assets in a given area. The density of assets.  Except I do know what LOD is. Short summary, models lose detail with distance through reduced geometry and texture resolution. Culling things not on camera is self-explanatory.   i'm confused, why did you go to school for game design but learn a mix of 3d modeling programs and some game engines? also wtf are you trying to make with both max AND maya, and zbrush and unity? what pipeline is that?  oh... do you mean when you're trying to be an ARTIST learning game development? do you know that is a different thing from uh, game design?   We learned both MAX and Maya, but they allow you as a student to decide which modeling program you want to use. We know of Unity, played around with it in one class, and moved on to UDK/UE3. The reason we learn how to use both a game engine and a modeling program is so that we understand the pipeline and can make a decent portfolio with our assets actually inside an engine.  Is there a reason you think that knowing how to get your assets into a game engine is something you WOULDN'T learn in a game design class?   i don't believe that you're someone who knows the difference between game development and game design. and shouldn't open their mouths about shit they don't understand.   Cool story, buddy. What do you want to talk about then? I'd be more than happy to talk about it.  I'll be bookmarking this for when the game launches. I'm willing to make a bet that the game will have less asset density, lower texture resolution, probably less polygons on environmental assets such as trees, and worse shadowing/lighting. And a fraction of the animations used in this trailer, if any at all.  Tell me, why do you think the developers said it was ""in-engine"" footage and not ""in-game""? You really think they don't know the difference? You honestly believe they said ""in-engine"" footage instead of ""in-game"" footage for no reason?  Give. me. a. break."

For one the ""I am a soandso"" has been a running gag for so long here, because nobody truly knows.  Then you said you work for EA, which both directly yields downvotes just as a direct response (think about the faces of new acquaintances if you told them ""I'm a vocational serial rapist"", but in blue arrow form) and because that already implies bias. (Would an EA employee say ""yes of course it's all fake, the product will never look like that"" ?)  And if you add to that the scepticism about that being ""feasible"" on any gamer machine, opposed to actually being excessively bolstered by pre-rendering or running on a cluster or something...  I would venture a guess that given the history of development very few people find it honest to argue one should expect that fidelity on realistic machines (and not just the angles..)

For me personally, it was my favorite part of the last game. And I was stating that this is LITERALLY not Star Wars Battlefield. There is no reason (other than the fact that it is being developed by another company) that they wouldn't try to stay consistent, or even improve upon the previous formula. (And by that I mean Battefront II.  On that note, my prediction is that EA probably has another plan for space battles, either as DLC or a whole separate game altogether."

gamernews,32y0yi,TheyKeepOnRising,5,Sat Apr 18 07:40:46 2015 UTC,"So, in Battlefront 2 we had battles across many maps and several eras of the Star Wars universe. Clone wars on Mygeeto, rebellion on Tantooine, etc. Etc.  So it begs to ask....WHAT IS WITH EA'S OBSESSION WITH ENDOR IN THIS NEW GAME?!  Seriously! Everything from pre-apha concept art to the new trailer is just Endor Endor Endor! Forest speeder chases! AT-ST with Ewoks! Foresty rebels!  In my personal opinion, aside from the tactical standpoint, the forest maps really....weren't that great. Polis Massa, Mygeeto, Geinosis....those were awesome maps that would give me chills to see showcased.  Does it bother anyone else that we're only seeing Endor with a few second-long clips of other rebellion locations so far?"
gamernews,32y0yi,BestRbx,8,Sat Apr 18 05:03:20 2015 UTC,"The battle on Endor was iconic to that trilogy. The stakes were the highest. Even SW casuals can identify what that is from. It's the only battle where speeder bikes are, giving the setting the best opportunity to cram in as many vehicles as possible. Also, the environment is lush enough to attempt to impress viewers with detail.  Also, the prequel series is not in this game, so the maps you listed will not be there."
gamernews,32y0yi,espionage101,2,Fri Apr 17 18:26:38 2015 UTC,"Good to know....although I will be bummed about the maps. I'm sure they'll either make up for that with DLC or The Force Awakens content. I'd be thoroughly surprised if EA doesn't try to cash in on TFA DLC after the movie's premiere.  I understand the significance of Endor. I'm just worried about the diversity/quality of content outside that chunk of the game considering it's all they're really showing us to this point. Given, no gameplay has been released yet, so that's subject to change. It just feels like they're hiding something."
gamernews,32y0yi,Syn7axError,3,Fri Apr 17 20:31:19 2015 UTC,"Considering the game is meant to be released around the same time as the movie, I'd be surprised if it doesn't contain any TFA stuff. Actually scratch that, I'd be surprised if the first DLC isn't TFA directed."
gamernews,32y0yi,bigtabs,2,Fri Apr 17 21:04:25 2015 UTC,It is. They'll release a map based on the new planet of episode 7.
gamernews,32y0yi,MisterPompad,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:36:24 2015 UTC,It's possible that the other locations are not yet ready to be shown in such high detail. The game isn't being released for another 6-7 months.

gamernews,32xjdl,Tejirof,2,Fri Apr 17 18:29:56 2015 UTC,"So your earlier comment got me a bit curious. I went to the garage and sure enough, stored with batteries. I managed to clean out the housing with Qtips and some alcohol. I replaced them with 6 rechargeable energizer batteries.   The first game I tried was Batman Returns. This was the game stored inside the Lynx itself. I learned later that it helped keep the contacts on the game from oxidizing.  I was able to move Batman left and right. I could even jump but the attack button was useless.   On to Turbo Sub. This one wouldn't boot up. At one point the screen even said ""Insert Game.""  A quick cleaning of the game's contacts with the Qtip and alcohol and I was back in business.  This time I decided to press the ""flip screen"" button and sure enough, the screen flipped. However, now when I pressed A or B the screen would flip every time :D  Lastly, California Games. Again, I had to clean the contacts. Once started I loaded up Surfing as it was my favorite. A and B mysteriously kept booting me to the spinning license plate at the home screen. Then I remembered you only needed the directional pad to steer the surfer. I did manage to get in a few sweet 360's.  The video quality was as good as it should have been.  I could have almost counted the number of pixels on two hands. The colors were washed out and not very vibrant.  We have come a long way.   Man, thanks for the trip down memory lane. The sights and sounds instantly transported me back to my childhood.  Plus, I got to hear a gnarly chiptune rendition of Loui, Loui by the Kingsmen  Here is an album of the whole ordeal if you are interested"

But it is in-engine, and I know how previous games look on the Frostbite engine, so the models and designs probably won't look too far off."
gamernews,32t2yo,FreakyMrCaleb,10,Thu Apr 16 14:22:05 2015 UTC,I can not wait. This might be one of the few games I buy at the full $60 price.

I'm considering buying it again on PS4 down the line if I enjoy my time with it on PC.  Though I guess if it's good, buying the expansions on PC will at least give them some of my money."
gamernews,32t2yo,withoutapaddle,10,Thu Apr 16 20:26:30 2015 UTC,"Surely the company that made the video card paid a huge lump of money to have Witcher 3 sold with it, so buying the video card bundle does in fact support the devs."

gamernews,32t2yo,withoutapaddle,3,Thu Apr 16 20:33:52 2015 UTC,Why? They probably wouldn't do that deal if they were making less money.
gamernews,32t2yo,dannysmackdown,4,Fri Apr 17 05:19:45 2015 UTC,"Yes they would.  10,000 sales at $40 is better than an unknown number of sales at $50.  These kinds of deals happen all the time.  You think Sony pays the publisher retail price for every copy of a game they give away on PS+?  No."
gamernews,32t2yo,withoutapaddle,2,Fri Apr 17 05:30:53 2015 UTC,"No, for sure they don't. Why would they do it then? How do they end up making more money? What is the motive?"
gamernews,32t2yo,dannysmackdown,5,Fri Apr 17 05:49:15 2015 UTC,"The motive is guaranteed sales.  For example, you think your game will sell 50k copies, but Sony comes along and says ""Games of this genre typically get 100k downloads when they are free on PS+.  We'll buy 100k copies at 50% of the normal price.""  If you take the deal and it turns out that your game is not well received and sells only 25k copies, you came out ahead, because you sold 100k copies at half price (effectively gaining 50k copies worth of profit).  You also get free marketing by being mentioned in all promotional material for that month's PS+ games, and you get a lot of word of mouth because players will be playing the game who would have otherwise not tried it.  It's really only a bad deal if you're so sure of your upcoming success that you don't want to entertain the idea of guaranteeing a big block of sales if it means losing part of your profit on that block.  But even in the simplest sense, buying in bulk always gets you a discount.  We pay crazy cheap prices at my company for the components we use all the time because we buy them by the thousand."

gamernews,32t2yo,skocznymroczny,1 point,Fri Apr 17 08:16:59 2015 UTC,They had DRM for the non-GOG versions because they didn't want the game to leak before release. The DRM was removed after launch.  I'm fine with punishing pirates. The reason I usually hate DRM is that it mostly punishes customers. Using DRM to ensure everyone get to play at the same time is something I can support.

gamernews,32t2yo,fausto2405,2,Sat Apr 18 01:27:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, and renound for its bad control setup. The Witcher 2: Assasins of Kings was where I first found the witcher series. Much better, good controls and a great story. You can start straight off from there if you want too."
gamernews,32t2yo,randomly-generated,2,Fri Apr 17 07:51:50 2015 UTC,"I don't remember it having shitty controls, which is odd. The graphics were a tad old, yes, but it's an old-ish game (2007?).  What really sold me on it was the ambiance, the music, the details. Like, if it starts raining, the NPCs won't just stand there scratching their ass, like in 99.99% of modern games. They will run for cover. By comparison, I'm playing Pillars of Eternity that just came out, it's really a wonderful RPG with a Baldur's Gate-y feel (but not as much charm, at least for me), and it starts raining, and nobody reacts in any way. This kind of immersion is what really sold the Witcher for me.  There was quite a bit of humor in the game as well. ""The mill is being haunted again"" still makes me chuckle. Or when you meet a dentist, and he introduces himself ""Whatshisname, dentist."" and the witcher replies ""Geralt, witcher, immune to cavities."" and the dentist just sighs.  And the day/night cycle was something I really liked as well. As in, you could run around during the day, and it was mostly safe. But at night you couldn't go for a minute without tripping over something trying to rip your head off.   On the whole, it really worked for me. Oh, and camera angles. I remember there being quite a few the game was playable from. One was similar to Skyrim over-the-shoulder, another was isometric 3/4 angle, which was another nice touch. The game had a pause feature (IIRC?) so even with its action combat you could stop time and kinda work out what your best tactical options would be.  All in all, I found it pretty enjoyable. I actually liked it more than Witcher 2, which I felt was very claustrophobic. Like, you have this path into the woods out of Flotsam, but it's basically a narrow tunnel you must follow, with a few ""rooms"" you can explore. Lovely game, still, but Witcher 1 was just much more open, and the quests were much broader in scope. Like when you get the quest chain in Vizima to investigate something, you basically spend the entire chapter on that investigation, and there's many turns you could possibly take. Even the ending, I feel, was stronger than Witcher 2's.   But that's just me. And to be fair, I played it years ago, so I'm sure it felt a lot less dated then than it would now."

gamernews,32qurx,MikeyJayRaymond,75,Wed Apr 15 23:53:27 2015 UTC,"As someone who went the stealth route in the last game, I can say I'm very happy with this. The last game forced players into a specific path of choices rather than giving the full freedom the game should have had."
gamernews,32qurx,yoshemitzu,45,Wed Apr 15 23:59:13 2015 UTC,"That Barrett boss fight (the first one) was a rude awakening to many of us who thought full stealth, non-lethal was an acceptable way to play through the game.  Turned out it worked, ultimately, you just needed to carry around a big gun or two for the boss fights.  Edit: I carried the big gun for the later boss fights, not Barrett. Once you were already there, it's not like you could go back and get one. Sorry if that was unclear. I didn't have to restart the game or anything."

I guess I didn't bring enough stun gun ammo or something.  I remember trying to trick him by trapping him on the other side of a pillar, then cheesing his vision by moving left and right to keep him from being able to acquire me. Unfortunately, he eventually just clips through the pillar and grabs you."

gamernews,32qurx,silkyhuevos,5,Thu Apr 16 02:21:20 2015 UTC,"DEHR is a prequel anyway, so you can basically pretend the first two games don't exist.

gamernews,32qurx,king_of_the_universe,28,Thu Apr 16 11:11:33 2015 UTC,I can't wait to stealth the first 5 minutes before ramboing the rest of the game as usual.

gamernews,32qurx,yoshemitzu,-3,Sat Apr 18 01:27:56 2015 UTC,"If it's anything like the Director's Cut of HR then it'll still be horrible. I hope they learned from that don't just shoehorn stealth concepts in. The tweets imply they can be stealthed, but they still have to be completed.  I'd prefer they should just forgo boss fights entirely. The first game only had a few of them and all of them were entirely avoidable (with some encounters changing if you avoided them the first time).  ""You can't fight ideas with bullets."""
gamernews,32qurx,king_of_the_universe,3,Thu Apr 16 04:13:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think they were ALL avoidable. Obviously there's the one fight with invincible Gunther that you had to lose, but in particular I am thinking of the one in the Ocean Lab in particular. Of course, like most things in the game, the latter was relatively easily cheesed with a handful of LAMs and a well placed GEP gun shot, or with the right augments."
gamernews,32qurx,razzledazzlerootbeer,1 point,Thu Apr 16 05:55:11 2015 UTC,"the one in the Ocean Lab   As I recall it there's only one boss fight in the Ocean Lab, one with Walton Simons which you can completely avoid. If you don't kill Walton he tries to fight you again outside the Area 51 bunker but again you can continue without killing him."
gamernews,32qurx,redditwentdownhill,2,Thu Apr 16 08:36:55 2015 UTC,"IIRC, you have to use a glitch to get past Anna Navarre without killing her, but my Google Fu is failing me on this. The Deus Ex wiki mentions the ability to skip her, but it doesn't say how (unless I'm as bad at reading as googling).   Edit: Also, on the glitches page it mentions you have to trick her into opening the UNATCO door, but it doesn't say how.   Edit2: Ah, looks like you have to hurt her enough to put her in panic mode, then give her nowhere to go but the front door."
gamernews,32qurx,redditwentdownhill,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:12:56 2015 UTC,"How can you avoid him? He can see you even if you're invisible-to-humans, or does the invisible-to-cameras aug work on him?  As for tactical tricks, retreating will lure him to the ladder which he won't climb, so you can toss LAMs up wards through the opening. But you can't get around him this way.  Maybe you're thinking of just running through (e.g. adding the run/jump aug into the mix). That might work. I just did a Hardcore GMDX play-through where everything is fucking hard as shit, e.g. once the forced conversation with Walton ends, you're immediately shot to pieces by his plasma rifle. Maybe in vanilla DX1, running works because he's not so overpowered."
gamernews,32qurx,redditwentdownhill,2,Thu Apr 16 10:23:29 2015 UTC,Maybe you're thinking of just running through   Yes. You can't avoid talking to him but once the cutscene is over you can run right through to the next area if you've invested in the running augmentation. The battle is super hard otherwise.   In general investing in the running augmentation means you can run past a lot of enemies in the game without engaging them.  Video of meeting Walton Simons again in Area 51 if you didn't kill him. Again you can go to the next area without actually killing him.

gamernews,32q734,Anzai,3,Sun Apr 19 00:46:29 2015 UTC,"Looks decent. I just hope this game includes a no hud option. There's always so much going on in the demos they show. I don't want floating health bars above my enemies, or dialogue above NPCs that I happen to pass, or even my own health most of the time. I'm pretty confident they will though, they seem to have thought of everything else."

gamernews,32qiux,shlitz,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:04:25 2015 UTC,"Second Story is my favorite as well. Edge seems to be like the Claude in that they're both main characters, so probably wouldn't have been able to skip him. I haven't played SO4 yet, so I'm not sure why people  hate Edge Maverick so much (i don't think the name's that bad although it does remind me of Tom Cruise in Top Gun).

gamernews,32koqb,Geofferic,0,Wed Apr 15 09:51:41 2015 UTC,There was so much talk about this game and buzz around it but about a week after its release it seems to have fallen off the map almost.  Is there a a lot of replay value with this game? I had one friend at work who bought it and played it but he said after a couple of hours of playing he was able to build every single building in the game and he said that he became bored with it soon after.  Is this the case with other people?
gamernews,32koqb,Trevo91,8,Wed Apr 15 00:27:58 2015 UTC,"Remember that this is a niche game from an indie publisher. The initial hype was positive and the city-builder enthusiasts snapped it up on release, some scattered folks have picked it up since then because of all the stellar reviews, and that's about it.  There are fence-sitters out there who don't want to dip into the genre at full price, though. Wait until Steam drops a 66%-off sale on us... then it'll blow up again."
gamernews,32koqb,ApathyJacks,3,Wed Apr 15 02:07:10 2015 UTC,"Wait until Steam drops a 66%-off sale on us... then it'll blow up again.   Also, it's a Paradox game, so wait until they release the first (of many) expansions, and it'll blow up again also."
gamernews,32koqb,cecilkorik,7,Wed Apr 15 02:53:31 2015 UTC,"It depends on the aspect I guess. I have personally put a lot of time in the pursuit of the ""perfect"" city entrance. It keeps it interesting, so perhaps everyone has their own thing."
gamernews,32koqb,RealisticGentleman,2,Wed Apr 15 00:48:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. And yeah, I agree.  My friend from work has a very short attention span so unless something new is constantly shoved in front of his face, he will get tired of it"
gamernews,32koqb,Trevo91,6,Wed Apr 15 00:50:20 2015 UTC,"For me, the big focus of the game is the traffic (automobiles and pedestrians!) and infrastructure. It's not hard to just spew out a grid of large one way roads and cram it full of high density zoning, and you can certainly do this until you've gotten all the buildings, but that's not really the point. It's really something special to have a bustling city with traffic that flows exceptionally well because you took the time to lay out streets, walking paths, bus lines, and metro stations properly. The first time you successfully run a highway through your growing city is a pretty spectacular one. This game has made me care way more about on/off ramps than I ever thought possible haha. Plus, we can expect some expansions to liven things up!"
gamernews,32koqb,Noir_,3,Wed Apr 15 07:29:28 2015 UTC,"Different people will enjoy different kinds of games, obviously. But if you like sandboxy city builders, this is probably the best one in a decade. Personally, if I manage to get bored in a sandbox, I typically have nothing but my own imagination to blame."
gamernews,32koqb,cecilkorik,4,Wed Apr 15 02:55:04 2015 UTC,"I have 200+ hours in the game, tons of replay value.  The mods alone add so much.   If you are an experimental type of person you will have no problem getting at least 90 hrs testing different cites styles, mods, and  different maps.  There is so much going on it is fun just watching your city tick."
gamernews,32koqb,drnickmd,2,Wed Apr 15 00:51:09 2015 UTC,"Lots of addons and custom maps to provide some variety, but ultimately if you don't derive enjoyment from building and problem solving and creating new city concepts and watching them go to hell traffic wise and then finding solutions then these aren't your game. Just building all the buildings is not  a ""win""."
gamernews,32koqb,Tiquortoo,1 point,Wed Apr 15 10:41:22 2015 UTC,"This is a niche game for people who actually like citybuilders. If you get bored with building cities because you are ""able to build every single building in the game"" then the entire genre isn't for you."

What?  2) If you like city builders, then there is a near infinite amount of replay value in this.  Especially considering the amount of material already developed in the Steam Workshop at this early date.  There are some pretty amazing mods coming down the pike!"

I'd say people are busy playing it. There are hundreds of mods added every week and counting. There's always news about about this game. I don't see how it's fallen off the map. It's doing exceptionally well for being such a small studio in the first place.

After watching the trailer I was pissed because it looked like they were dumbing the controller down to 3 buttons instead of 5, but it's actually 6 buttons, 2 for each lane.   Definitely cool, but I think I'll get more nostalgia factor out of Rock Band 4. Ultimately it comes down to the songs available, and Rock Band already said they'll have the full DLC library and songs from past games. I don't think the new GH will be able to compete with that."

Last I heard, Harmonix said that they couldn't guarantee that they would be able to port songs from past games due to licensing.

I think the biggest problem will be that, since the initial experience is drastically less generic and memorable, it'll quickly become annoying. What used to be background fluff is going to be front and center now, even with variations it'll be the same experience every X times. I'm guessing they'll have a ""quick session"" mode that skips all the theatrics."
gamernews,32kjod,ukiyoe,4,Wed Apr 15 00:14:04 2015 UTC,"I watched both demo videos, and it looks like they record the performance once  as good, and once as bad.  All the choreography of the band and cameraman are exactly the same between the two versions, it's just that in the bad version the band members give you dirty looks and the crowd boos.  If you do bad, the game blurs (ala taking heavy damage in a FPS) to the bad performance, do well and it blurs back to the good performance."
gamernews,32kjod,elteej,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:48:25 2015 UTC,"That sounds about right, thanks for sharing. It really does sound like FMV 2.0, fading video tracks on the fly instead of sequential playback.  I find it funny that they're shooting for realism, but at the same time somehow a guitar noob is hired as a session guitarist to perform for what looked like a million fans.  ""Don't blame me, they hired me on blind faith!"""
gamernews,32kjod,ukiyoe,2,Wed Apr 15 18:31:31 2015 UTC,"It's going to be torture when you fail the same harder levels over and over to have the band members get mad at you in the same way over and over.

Its in phenomenal shape, sounds good, and is the right comfort level with medium gauge strings that I recommend for beginners.  What a great deal.  Of course my dad has played for forty years but rarely acoustic so he just wanted something cheap to dick around with.  He still calls them flat tops.

gamernews,32kjod,jacobwalks1,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:26:37 2015 UTC,What leads you to believe that they'll scale back difficulty? Every guitar hero game has had multiple difficulty levels
gamernews,32kjod,AnimaWish,1 point,Wed Apr 15 05:12:00 2015 UTC,"While I firmly agree with your comment that yes,  there has in fact been different levels of difficulty in prior games, I dont believe that they will make the legitimate skill required of said difficulty to a level in which is equal to or even maybe more difficult than prior games. I have a strong suspicion that this will be more of a general public game and the actual skill level of a lot of aspects of the game will be scaled back to match that of a general user of said game. I don't feel like the button layout of this new version will be able to add much ( if any) difficulty simply because they only alllow 3 fingers to be used and there are only so many combinations that I think they will use.  Many of them I believe are going to be simplistic. So while I do honestly hope this isn't a massive flop and I may end up throwing my money at it, I am holding back because of this overwhelming feeling I get that its going to be scaled back.

Its got to be difficult to be objective about a game you know is made by people who clearly hate you - going so far as to celebrate you not personally enjoying their game.  It just makes sense to not review it in order to avoid bias
gamernews,32k4zw,Arama,6,Wed Apr 15 08:08:25 2015 UTC,Oh I meant it was juvenile by the developer. It's definitely right not to review it

The constantly recording video editor in IV made the game nearly unplayable and only after tons of patches or even disabling it did a lot of people get a good experience out of the port. When news about the editor first leaked, it wasn't clear if the game was constantly recording, and that made sense because it was the constantly recording aspect of IV that hampered the game so much.   I'm really interested in how Rockstar can still maintain performance whilst constantly recording clips in V!"
gamernews,32g53a,Cley_Faye,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:22:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe they just did it super bad in GTA4. Continuously recording a few minutes of gameplay logs to replay them afterward is not costly at all, it's basically what Quake demo are, and we had them since forever."
gamernews,32g53a,Elizabethan_Insulter,2,Mon Apr 13 22:47:52 2015 UTC,"Quake and CS demos are something completely different than what GTA does. Those demos are basically recording model positions and status per tick, and that's why things like rag doll and other client side physics things will be different in demos than recorded live. Those demos are a lot less taxing then what GTA was doing, which was recording everything so that you could get all of the dumb physics. Anyway, in Rockstar we trust o7."
gamernews,32g53a,Cley_Faye,-1,Mon Apr 13 22:54:37 2015 UTC,"How are they that different? They record more stuff, but even then it's not that huge. Even if you have ~100 debris flying around, it's not gonna kill your system to record their position and orientation each frames, even less if they are slightly optimized to record only change in speed.  Anyway, it looks good, and since we have those powerbeast computer, might as well use them :)"

Turns out that's not the case, and it uses the usual GTA UI. There's no reason I can see why this won't make it to consoles, especially new-gen since the hardware differences in from PC are minimal.  I'm guessing timed-exclusive because of the changes that need to be made to make it work with the differences in console file systems, etc., and the early release makes a nice gift to the PC users for having to wait so long for the game."

I'll clarify: The RAM, CPU & video hardware are similar to what you would buy when building a midrange gaming rig in 2013.  This means the code written for PC can be made to run on consoles with only minor changes. This wasn't the case previous-gen, which used mostly custom hardware and different CPU architectures meaning a good portion of the codebase would need to be rewritten if it originated on PC.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4#Hardware"

gamernews,32g53a,IceShot22,2,Tue Apr 14 10:07:06 2015 UTC,"The quality of the output ""footage"" and in-game quality are unrelated because of the way these movie recorders work. I should know, I'm building one for a mobile game.  When you're playing, it's recording only the positions of objects (there's more to it, but that's the gist). This is why you can go back and change camera angles, etc after the fact. When you're done setting up your scene and export the video, it then renders it frame by frame to a file. Since it can take all the time it needs, even a low-end machine can output videos on crazy-high settings, assuming you have enough VRAM to handle the textures. For example, this is the method that Gran Turismo 5 on PS3 used to output photos like this at 5760x3240, but it took sometimes several minutes to render just that one frame."

gamernews,32bvz1,FlyingGoldenGoose,17,Sun Apr 12 13:24:51 2015 UTC,"Guys I'm one of the devs and some of the comments are really scary and demotivating to be honest.  Of course as an indie, it is not a super production but like most indie games out there the only way to have an objective comment about it is to actually play it.   The game design has be directed towards sensations, playability and fun. Give it a shot before you kill our morale please.  If you still feel like the game should be modified on various ways we have a tool in game that allows you to change the course of its development, hence the early access.  More info about the community-driven development tool is described here: http://www.stormunited.com/index.php/game/item/151-udh"
gamernews,32bvz1,studiopixelbeam,7,Mon Apr 13 02:15:39 2015 UTC,I think it looks cool and ill definitely be trying it out!

gamernews,32bvz1,MrOFoxy,2,Mon Apr 13 02:57:29 2015 UTC,"Dont worry about it man, the game looks great after looking into more. In your promotion trailers really find ways to show your audience on how the game differs from those on the market and why they should be interested. Work those value propositions!   I really like the development tool I might have to take that as some inspiration for the game Im working on."

gamernews,32bvz1,foolofatook29,-2,Mon Apr 13 20:55:14 2015 UTC,"I won't invest in an early access title if the dev is this easily upset/demotivated. Also, just don't do early access. Allow people to alpha test your game for free, and then charge once it gets in the beta/near release. Honestly I don't want anything to do with an early access twitch shooter that is going to need what I'm assuming is a ton of optimization, net code tweaking, and other things that will make it unplayable on a large scale at launch.   I hate that devs like you feel you have to do paid alphas. You are ruining the industry. Sorry if that hurt your feelings - but if you're putting something out there - get thicker skin."
gamernews,32bvz1,studiopixelbeam,1 point,Mon Apr 13 05:57:47 2015 UTC,"We have done free beta rounds, the game is stable and the netcode works great. The reason why we call it alpha its mostly because there are features we want in the game that are missing and various details are unpolished. It has nothing to do with releasing a broken game, its been many months we've been pushing the release back to propose a stable game that's fun to play right from the start. Just because other devs push super early builds doesn't mean every one of us does it. We've already been working 3 years on it you know :)"

gamernews,32b5ou,Zynnk,2,Sun Apr 12 17:48:31 2015 UTC,I'll be honest I've never played monster hunter and don't really understand what it's about.  This made it look like pokemon if pokemon had more monstery creatures and less turn based battles.
gamernews,32b5ou,Freekling,4,Sun Apr 12 17:59:00 2015 UTC,"Imagine Pokemon had a late night tryst with Demon Souls and had a baby.  It's got all the nuanced gameplay that can be brutal if you aren't careful like Demon Souls (and it's 3rd person adventure game,) but you're hunting a few dozen giant monsters with elemental properties like Pokemon. only you kill the monsters and make weapons out of their body parts."

gamernews,32b5ou,mizzrym91,1 point,Sun Apr 12 22:02:38 2015 UTC,"The controls work well on a system with two analog sticks. On Wii U and 2/3DS you can play Monster Hunter 4. I have the 3DS ver. and it's fun, but it's probably better on Wii U.  EDIT: Only on 3DS"
gamernews,32b5ou,Relemsis,3,Sun Apr 12 22:16:02 2015 UTC,"There isn't MH4U for the Wii U, just 3 Ultimate.  4 Ultimate is a 3DS Exclusive, but the circle pad pro/new 3DS setup does make it somewhat easier.  That said, Monster Hunter's combat is not nearly as camera dependent as DS/Bloodborne games are. The difficulty is the same, but what you're fighting is totally different (although the lesson of ""caution at all times"" does pay off well here too.)"
gamernews,32b5ou,Patius,1 point,Sun Apr 12 22:37:57 2015 UTC,Honestly MH4U was my first monster hunter game and it's controls are pretty solidly intuitive. The bow guns and bow areally kinda tricky but the melee weapons and Gun Lance are straightforward if you try the tutorials. This is on normal 3DS.

gamernews,329d1y,FlyingGoldenGoose,9,Sat Apr 11 19:35:21 2015 UTC,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare but Warhammer? Pretty much sold already.
gamernews,329d1y,Tagichatn,6,Sat Apr 11 22:05:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd say the gameplay reminds me more of Warhammer + Killing floor. Team vs endless waves of some enemy. Enemy probably has ""boss"" or different types.  Wondering what the objectives (if any) will be."
gamernews,329d1y,PalwaJoko,3,Sat Apr 11 23:32:16 2015 UTC,"That's true, I hope the melee system is as good as Chivalry though."

gamernews,329d1y,CurlyNippleHairs,4,Sat Apr 11 23:51:10 2015 UTC,It get's so much praise because there's probably more Chivalry players then there are Dark Messiah players.
gamernews,329d1y,SoberPandaren,1 point,Sun Apr 12 01:59:32 2015 UTC,"DMMM's MP was also different from the SP. I don't recall exactly how but the game had a poor release in general. Great melee combat and sound effects though.   Chivalry is pretty decent, not perfect but it also is in a niche market with the only other two realy competitors being Mount&Blade: Warband and briefly (as almost everyone realized how shit it was very quickly) War of the Roses (which is dead now) and they all played differently."
gamernews,329d1y,ehManiacal,1 point,Sun Apr 12 10:50:05 2015 UTC,"I've been saying it for years now, but if the Elder Scrolls had Dark Messiahs combat you would have one of the best RPG's ever made."

gamernews,329d1y,thetaprime,2,Tue Apr 14 11:19:26 2015 UTC,"There is as much point in Chivalry as there is any other game where you have a bunch of players trying to kill each other (so, most FPS games)."

gamernews,329d1y,thetaprime,4,Sun Apr 12 02:18:20 2015 UTC,"What, you don't want reverse overheads in the game? Lol. But in all seriousness, chivalry's appeal comes from the ability to actually choose how you attack. In most games, you just mash a button and get random attack such as stabs, overheads, side swings. But in chivalry, you can choose how to manuveur the sword which is sweet."

I remember back in the day there was fierce internet battle about if War of the Roses or Chivalry was better. Can't remember what the argument was for War of the Roses but it was Chivalry-esque."
gamernews,329d1y,MaddenedMan,2,Sun Apr 12 22:27:32 2015 UTC,"Roses had a Mount and Blade type combat system, but was utterly unbalanced, and because of it's heritage a lot harder to control than Chivalry."
gamernews,329d1y,Scrial,2,Sun Apr 12 00:57:02 2015 UTC,"Even more than just unbalanced, it took Fat Shark far too long to try and address many of its problems (like the balance) and they never really fixed it that well, although think they mostly did improve the poor optimization problems it had. To my knowledge though, Fat Shark NEVER acknowledged that the combat mechanics were also fundamentally flawed and even a ping of 100 resulted in noticeable problems (the netcoding wasn't great either).  Total Biscuit did a comparison video but he missed out on a lot of stuff, and while WotR looked great on paper it was pretty much a failure in practice for many good reasons. It had a small dedicated fan base but it completely failed to retain 99% of players, even during massive sales, going ""free 2 play"" (really just a trial mode) and when it was given away for free (partly by accident) it saw a huge spike of players that completely dropped off within a couple of days.   The sequel War of the Vikings didn't even register as a blip on the most played games on Steam charts when it came out it flopped so hard.   Fat Shark has a poor record for supporting their games in the past as well and it is amusing that they are even still around. Hopefully they don't fuck this game up like everything else they have made."
gamernews,329d1y,ehManiacal,0,Sun Apr 12 15:10:23 2015 UTC,War of the Roses was a pile of tripe.

They accepted $75000 from people, and are now putting their game on hold. How long will their new game take to develop? I'd wager at least a year, unless it's some shovelware mobile game. Will they even get enough money to continue Midora? Games are never a guarantee.  It looks like what happened was the project leader had absolutely no idea how to manage the scope of the game. It kept growing and growing, while the money kept shrinking and shrinking. This is what happens when you give inexperienced people money. The worst part is that there's almost no financial consequences with kickstarter. They never have to complete Midora.  I don't think it's malicious, because they clearly wanted the game to succeed, but I think these people were negligent in how little they knew about managing a project."

So promising. Yet so very, very bad."

War for the Overworld recently came out of early access - some pundits think it could have used another month in development before its full release. While I wish Realmforge & Subterranean good fortune in bringing the genre back into the mainstream. I'm very interested to see what the increased competition over audience will do to both titles.

gamernews,320d4i,Torvusil,3,Thu Apr 9 15:52:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry to sidetrack, but can anyone answer me this.  Aside from Starcraft 2, where have all the gather gold, gather wood, gather (insert thing here), build up a base and build up units and fight RTSes gone??  Is a name for those?  Ya know, warcraft 3, age of empires/mythology, empire earth etc?  I want to play that.  Anyone know?"
gamernews,320d4i,Roike,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:04:32 2015 UTC,"The genre evolved. Older games were simpler, more straight forward, and lacked much in the way of tactical depth, often boiling down to macro vs macro; A big reason starcraft was as popular as it was at the time for giving you units that had more to them than just 'move and shoot'.  The genre extrapolated on this, and things like formations, cover, concealment, inventories, abiltiies, etc. made the genre more complex, immersive, and fun for most. C&C and games like it were fun for their time, but they just haven't aged very well and are more of a nostalgic charm at this point. That's why games like Planetary Annihlation and Grey Goo died so quickly."
gamernews,320d4i,Sedition7988,-1,Thu Apr 16 08:37:11 2015 UTC,"Like any genre, RTSes have evolved, and moved beyond classic base building - I think World in Conflict was one of the first to move beyond the base building/supply gathering model, because dropping dudes in instead of building them is seen as more realistic than building them from scratch on the battlefield, and it gets the player into the action a lot faster and forces them to be more strategic with the few units they have.

The multiplayer is the highlight but the campaign is great, solid story, fun levels, and not over-the-top cheesy like MW 2/3 were.    Also, zombies.    For gettign an old one, I didn't play ghosts much, and wasn't a fan of MW3.  Black Ops 2 is the last one I really liked, but it's online community is probably pretty weak due to age.  If you just want a good solo experience though, definitely pick up Black Ops 1, and CoD4 if you haven't played it."

I know you stipulated against multiplayer, but I'm not sure if you're not looking for multiplayer in general or if you're focused more on not playing competitive multiplayer.  The Zombies modes in the Treyarch titles are fun 1-4 player wave defense co-op done in a neat way.  WaW also has Campaign Co-op, which is pretty unusual for Call of Duty."

For contrast, with the DE announcement trailer yesterday, the sense of excitement in the comments was palpable. The top comments here are sarcasm about how many CODs there have been.

What I mean is, when the thief is swinging from the rope, jumps, and pops another rope, in previous games you had to aim each rope. In this one, it looks like it auto-finds a target. Reminds me of Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones, where the ""dark Prince"" would swing similarly, and the ""grab"" was automatic. It looked good, but required no skill to do, iirc. Lots of stuff seems borrowed from Prince series, like bounding up a chute by jumping off the walls higher and higher. Not a bad thing by itself, but I feel it makes the game less ""Trine"" and more ""PoP"".  Still, looks damn good."

SOTSS had an awesome item crafting mechanic, fun battle, awesome art and music.  Then 'Til the End of Time was awful, and my friend who played The Last Hope said the battle system was almost unplayable towards the end of the game.  I'll try to keep an open mind."

gamernews,31w6dz,MG87,15,Fri Apr 10 03:07:43 2015 UTC,"I hope the cutscenes are rendered like this in the game.   It didn't affect alot of people, but I was very disappointed when Deus Ex:HR implemented washed out, pre-rendered cutscenes that couldn't light a candle to the detail and visual flair of the trailers.  Edit: I didn't realize that it has affected other people, as well. I often hear that the gameplay during the Boss battles were 'unbalenced', prior to the Director's Cut. However, little was said about the cutscenes or the screen turning completely black when conducting a lethal / non-lethal takedown on an npc."
gamernews,31w6dz,Nanowise,9,Wed Apr 8 22:55:59 2015 UTC,"I didn't like how different the cutscenes looked from the game, like you would get an amazing looking one of the city and then you start playing and everything looks washed out and yellow, almost to the point of it being a different art style."
gamernews,31w6dz,SnowyCaptain,2,Thu Apr 9 03:24:01 2015 UTC,"Console limitations. That's one thing that worries me about MD: They already said their engine is ""optimized for consoles and PC"" ... yeah. So PC version will be held back. Here's hoping for mods, so that in the end the gameplay looks better than the cutscenes. But I don't hold my breath when it comes to mods in that game."
gamernews,31w6dz,Keksus_,8,Thu Apr 9 05:08:48 2015 UTC,"If that's what they meant, they would have said ""optimized for consoles"". ""Optimized for consoles and PC"" literally means ""optimized for consoles and optimized for PCs.""  Whether or not you can take the statement at face value is another matter, as it would be marketing suicide to say ""optimized for consoles"". I guess you were hoping they would say ""optimized for PCs"", which would be equally suicidal.  So really, since you can't take the statement at face value, it doesn't mean the PC version will be held back nor does it mean that it will shine on high-spec PCs. It actually means nothing at all."

It's gonna be amazings!  Just look at how people praise games like Shadow of Mordor for its graphics, even though it was made to be playable on last-gen consoles.  This is going to be a leap forward."
gamernews,31w6dz,sonicmerlin,1 point,Fri Apr 10 05:28:10 2015 UTC,what annoys me is that it's not really a leap forward compared with pc. pc graphics were on that level for a long time now.
gamernews,31w6dz,Keksus_,1 point,Fri Apr 10 09:52:00 2015 UTC,"No they weren't.  PC games have just been ports of console games with high res textures and increased draw distance.  There hasn't been a new tech demo/game like Crysis since the original Crysis.  Although Star Citizen is looking like a good candidate.  There are a thousand more efficient ways of spending those increased CPU/GPU resources in a new engine than just increasing MSAA to ridiculous levels.  Just the new graphical tricks enabled by DX 10/11/12 will look wondrous when it's built into the game rather than patched on afterwards.  But there's also polygon counts, lighting, different kinds of textures, and of course much improved physics."

gamernews,31w6dz,Keksus_,2,Thu Apr 9 23:47:49 2015 UTC,"In-game looked way better than the cutscenes. They compressed the videos waaayyy to much. Not as bad as Mortal Kombat, though, to be fair."

gamernews,31w6dz,lilTyrion,18,Wed Apr 8 22:04:54 2015 UTC,Adam Jensen wants everybody to get along and he's willing to murder all the dudes to make it happen
gamernews,31w6dz,Mccmangus,7,Wed Apr 8 22:18:17 2015 UTC,ehh i guess. it seems to me that the trailer is portraying the difficulties of trying to be a motivator of change. Saving a kid. Is that a good thing when said kid goes on to blow up a bus full of un-Aug civilians?
gamernews,31w6dz,lilTyrion,3,Wed Apr 8 22:21:01 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, though I would conjecture that Jensen represents the motif of action. He won't sit by and allow the brutal beat down the police were heaping on the kid nor will he tolerate a group that uses terrorist tactics to effect change."
gamernews,31w6dz,TheSimpleArtist,3,Thu Apr 9 04:44:20 2015 UTC,Discrimination against Augs caused a terrorist group to form up from pissed off Augs which in turn causes more discrimination and so forth. The fight with who I assume is the leader takes place before the guy in orange places the bomb. Jensen is trying to shut down the terrorists to prevent more violence.
gamernews,31w6dz,SnowyCaptain,11,Thu Apr 9 03:17:56 2015 UTC,"Biggest concern is that it looks like they're taking an Arkham-style approach. Though this could just be to make an interesting trailer and it's too early to jump to that conclusion. That charge/boost into the group followed by melee'ing several guys at once is weird for a sequel to HR. Again, it's probably just to create a more cinematic trailer.  I'm still incredibly excited to get my hands on it, since Dues Ex: HR was incredible and I'd love to go back to that world. (Hopefully they'll let you be more creative with bosses this time!)"
gamernews,31w6dz,tairusu,10,Wed Apr 8 20:04:26 2015 UTC,That charge/boost into the group followed by melee'ing several guys at once is weird for a sequel to HR   That could be just a skill. Like dual takedown in DX:HR
gamernews,31w6dz,BTMPL,2,Wed Apr 8 21:37:16 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely. It's more of the aftermath of that technique that worried me (mildly), since he drops the one guy, then proceeds to take out the rest of the group one by one. It was probably just to show case the different skills and abilities and isn't representative of actual game play."
gamernews,31w6dz,tairusu,5,Wed Apr 8 21:42:48 2015 UTC,"This is the most likely, they just wanted a good combat sequence to make the video more exciting."
gamernews,31w6dz,thfrbiddn1,6,Wed Apr 8 22:04:45 2015 UTC,Personally I feel like it's a little two early to suggest that things in the video are to going to be in the final game. But who knows; I could be wrong.
gamernews,31w6dz,Zivodor,4,Wed Apr 8 23:20:51 2015 UTC,It's a CGI trailer... I wouldn't judge about the gameplay from a CGI trailer at all.
gamernews,31w6dz,Keksus_,2,Thu Apr 9 05:06:53 2015 UTC,"They had a similar sequence for the E3 trailer for HR, and you know how HR is now. I wouldn't be worried."
gamernews,31w6dz,SnowyCaptain,3,Thu Apr 9 03:06:45 2015 UTC,"I have to wonder if the skin hardening at the end of the trailer is a nanobot augment, like in the original Deus Ex. I haven't gotten around to playing HR so I don't know if those were in that one but considering it's a prequel..."

This preorder insanity is really getting out of hand if you don't even need to have a release date for a game company to begin soliciting preorders.  I believe this business model is called ""kickstarter"" and those aren't preorders, they're investments, and people who invest should be treated as investors."
