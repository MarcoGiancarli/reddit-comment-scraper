TheBluePill,3e36wn,crazymcfattypants,15,Tue Jul 21 17:44:21 2015 UTC,Some abusive megadouch is gonna ruin her fucking life.
TheBluePill,3e36wn,Greatjonunchained,17,Tue Jul 21 18:50:09 2015 UTC,They've already ruined her mum and sisters. She's just copying them. Stay with them no matter how terrible they are.   There's a double standard though. They stay faithful and serve their cheating partners. Would the reverse be true?
TheBluePill,3e36wn,smapho,19,Tue Jul 21 19:07:59 2015 UTC,"It's sad that after all this, she picks a perpetually homeless guy who lives in a car on her mum's driveway and does really childish stupid things. She's essentially copying her mum :(   My mother has been married to my dad for about 30 years. She got a college degree in architecture. He never finished high school. She is the bread winner. He can't keep a steady job because he's an alcoholic. I'm not a daddy's girl either and even though he has been sobering up I still feel somewhat awkward around him.  My sisters and I were not raised to be doormats. My mother always encouraged us to go to school and get an education because we should never have to depend on a man and we should respect ourselves.  Yet when she has a chance, she does tell me that she IS tired. It was never a woman's job to be the head of the house and she longs for the day my dad will kick his addiction for good and step up as a man. Wives are to submit to their husbands. Many feminists will say it's 100% not true and it's brainwashing or just preference, but either way it's 100% true for me and for many relationships I see. I want to submit to someone. I'm really prideful and I could never see myself being happy with an alpha, not any of these terpers anyway. Yet I also long for a man to take charge.  Not someone who bosses me around or completely disregards me as a person. But someone I can admire and look up to.  I think it is the internal idea that I should defer to a man on everything, that he should be the Captain and I the First Mate that I struggle with. Are we not equal? Should we not get equal say? Yet everyone following RPW seems to be very happy.  Picture a husband and wife having a serious discussion. The husband wants to move to a new state for work but the wife does not. He asks for her opinion because he loves her and takes her into consideration. After telling him her concerns she explains why she doesn't want to go. Afterwards the decision is in the sole hands of the husband. He decides not to go per his wife's imput because either she is correct or he just wants her to be happy.  Yes, you should get a say and if your man says otherwise than you should reevaluate your relationship. Throw that SMV crap out the window. You should be with someone you love and respect. Let's say the husband chose to move anyway. The RPW would go and trust his judgment. I am happy, not because I defer to ""a man"" for everything, but because I defer to my best friend and the love of my life for everything. RPW is not how to ""please men"" It's how to be the best wife to the man you love.  I am wondering if this shift in mindset came easy to most people? Did you naturally already agree with it? Was it a struggle? I'm really having a hard time here if anyone could share their story/journey with me.  It did come easy to want that dynamic because I was raised in it. It was a struggle to follow through with it in my relationship at first since my bf is pretty beta and I was already used to being independent I just kept taking the lead. I kept saying ""be a man and THEN I'll respect you"" but it wasn't until I changed first that my bf started being more assertive. I trusted his judgment and cared about his opinions and he became more confident in giving his opinions and final decisions. We are much happier than we were 3 years ago."

TheBluePill,3e22u0,OurLadyBolton,13,Tue Jul 21 10:40:01 2015 UTC,"So, if she gets A girl, one girl... it's fair that he should get two girls?  and   Daddy's busy.   lawl  This thread is actually pretty revealing of the red-pills. From the discussion of treating women like children:   An adult wouldn't need to explain himself so much to a child. Just get a new girl and show her off.  You wouldn't debate endlessly with a child, you would just say ""no"".   My father raised my sister and I explaining things to us as much as was needed for us to understand - sometimes more. He was extremely thorough in everything that he taught us, and making sure not only that we understood the rules that he set for us, and that we understood why they were rules, but also that we agreed with them. I can admit that this is an unorthodox approach, but it really makes me think that these red-pills were raised by, well, shitty parents. Parents that didn't explain things to their kids, parents that would just say ""no"" without offering reasons or even excuses to childish demands.   So, in this context, how were the blue-pills raised? Did the parents of BP's talk with or try to thoroughly explain difficult concepts?  Another revealing aspect... Interesting one of the contributors came out and said it, but:   Lots of guys here are still insecure deep down... ...They read this and project themselves into that same position...   I was surprised any of them could actually admit that much, but anyway, a lot of them are convinced that his gf has already been with another girl and is retroactively seeking approval. If the contributors to the conversation really are projecting themselves into it, then I would imagine many of them have been cheated on in past relationships. As a man, there is probably little else that could be more emasculating than to be cheated on. I really picture them leaving the relationship, angry and emotional, convincing themselves that women are all bunch of cheats and whores and so on, and... red-pill.   From the ""beta sins"" thread:   And I have some loser thought sometime "" I wish i was gay they are not worth it "".   Red-pill psychology can be endlessly fascinating.  EDIT: Holy fucking shit. His ""Update"" is... Wow. Fucking hell... It's easy to forget the seriousness of these people, at least, I tend to. So much of it is just so damn stupid that I often can't help but laugh, right? But then I'll see something that reminds me, these are real people with real convictions, with power to emotionally cripple and really do severe damage to someone. There are some borderline/fucking-overtly abusive relationships that crop up in MRP or rpwomen every so often, and then I remember.   These are fucking monsters.  I hope that girl, for her own safety, sanity, and general future, gets the fuck out. Reading that update made me actually fear for her. I can only imagine that comment after comment by the red-pills, each saying one horrible thing after another, one awful theory after another, she's already been with another girl, she's cheated on (you), she can't be trusted, (you) should have done this instead, (you're) a weak, beta ""male"" and (you) deserve every shitty thing that happens.  Fuck. Then he goes home, fucking brews on all that poison and then when she comes over...  I really have to wonder if this girl can even safely leave him even if she tried at this point. That update was legitimately scary."

Except he told ME that I needed to find a girlfriend... so he could justify fucking around on me. I said no. He would be allowed to have a boyfriend, because that way it's actually fair. He didn't like my modification.   What strikes me about this conversation (if it were real) is that the twerp keeps talking about cock. The girlfriend isn't talking about getting a cock. It's not a parallel at all. And why doesn't he just say ""no, I see this the same as if you were with a dude"" instead of pretending like he wants an excuse to get another girl? I don't get the impression that he wants to pick up another girl, I get the impression that he doesn't agree that girl-on-girl isn't cheating.   Communication. Use it, dammit!"

TheBluePill,3e08hs,TheDeadManWalks,3,Tue Jul 21 10:52:01 2015 UTC,He doesn't really act on it but it's implied through his diary and later on through his psych profile. The one I remember most vividly is when he writes that he suspects Ozymandias of being gay and will need to do further research. The wording uggests that it's an important matter for him to know and could change how he deals with Ozy later.  As for the sexism his psych profile shows that his mother was a prositute and as a result he has a fear of sex (When he worked for a tailor he always felt very uncomfortable handling womens underwear) and believes most women to be similar to his mother. He calls his landlady a whore for having several kids and IIRC even criticizes her for having children of mixed race.
TheBluePill,3e08hs,colmatterson,3,Tue Jul 21 11:03:51 2015 UTC,"I remember the Ozymandias part, and I remember thinking it was odd phrasing making it sound like his sexuality mattered to Rorschach. Of course, combined with the attitude Rorschach has towards women and heterosexual relationships, the argument could be made that Rorschach was interested in Ozymandias's sexuality because it might have been the same as Rorschach's - homosexual. Just to be clear, though, I'm not making that argument here and now, just stating that it could be made.  I don't remember that about his landlady, however. In fact, I thought I remembered it almost opposite of that - that he said she was alright, except for the lies she told to the media about himself, that he had tried molesting her, or pushing himself onto her sexually, something like that. I don't quite remember, it's been a long while since I've read Watchmen. I DO remember that what stops him from exacting petty vengeance on her is her children. He's scaring her, saying that she lied about him to the media and that he was going to punish her for it. But then one, or maybe more, of her children peek around the corner and he remember his own childhood, and decides to leave instead.  I dunno, we could debate this, but I think we would both have to reread Watchmen before we could make cohesive claims for our positions."

I think this'll be the push that makes me so thank you. We may just be interpreting things differently to each other, one of the joys of Watchmen is that it's written in such a way that it can have so many meanings.  There is a school of thought that Rorschach is a heavily repressed homosexual, it does fit with a few aspects of his character. Maybe it's one of many things to keep in mind for the next reread."
TheBluePill,3e08hs,colmatterson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:39:04 2015 UTC,"I haven't been thinking of rereading it, but this has been my own push for me to do so as well, so both ""you're welcome"" and ""thank you to you too"". So as I read it this time, I'll definitely be keeping the ""Rorschach is a repressed homosexual"" theory in mind. I shouldn't be surprised, but I actually didn't know that was a theory that has been tossed out and around before. Thinking about it and what I remember from Watchmen... Well, it isn't a totally absurd idea."

If that's true than it makes sense that kids who grow up like that are inadequate for writing female characters. They've never really been encouraged to relate to a female character.

In fault divorce, you have to cite a reason and justify why you want a divorce.  So let's say your husband cheated. Under older fault systems, you have to get a private investigator to find proof of the affair, bring that to court and petition to have a divorce on the grounds of infidelity.   In a no fault divorce, the court doesn't give a shit. You don't have to hire a PI, or provide proof. Your reason could be ""He looked at me funny"" and the court doesn't take that into account. You want a divorce, you got one.  Manospherians seem to hate no fault divorce. I'm not sure why. It's cheaper and easier to get a divorce, because you don't have to prove anything. But on the other hand, sometimes under fault divorce, the court would say ""Not good enough. No divorce."" if you couldn't prove a reason. So you had to stay married.  The truth is that fault divorce made divorce too expensive for lots of people. Both of my parents got a divorce under the fault divorce (no-fault divorce was made Australia wide here in 1975), and they had to prove that for the last seven years, they hadn't seen their spouse (which would give them a 'reason' - abandonment). It didn't actually keep people together.   If a merp was really worried about ""divorce rape"", then all that dread game they love would be a reason for divorce, and cost them more, because abuse is a reason for divorce.

Men get shamed for being virgins, and women get the old ""better find a man or you're gonna be an old cat lady"" spiel.)"

TheBluePill,3dwskq,TheChemist158,105,Mon Jul 20 04:36:23 2015 UTC,"Yesterday I spent the day with one of my plates, who I introduced to another and we had a threesome.  This girl knows I date multiple women and that I really don't care if she sticks around or not. I am currently working on a few business ideas so my time is precious.  So last night after us spending the afternoon in bed with another girl, then her letting me give her anal (second time meeting).   I actually thought that this might be relevant to the story somehow. Nope. It's completely irrelevant, but heaven forbid the internet doesn't think he is constantly surrounded by horny women at all time.   So after the day I was getting ready to leave and she hits me with. ""I am a woman, you should respect me""   Out of nowhere? That's an odd thing to say. Women these days.   To which my reply was, no.  Her draw dropped and she didn't say anything for at least 10 seconds.  She said what!! But you have to i'm a lady.   Oh God, I can't even try. Please, someone, post this to r/thathappened. This happened so fucking hard. Did she drop the chalk and run out of the classroom crying? Was that chalk Albert Einstein?    My reply: Respect is a highly valuable commodity which is to be earned. You say women shouldn't get special treatment for being women, but you think every woman should be respected just for that.  She said: But, that's not what i'm saying.  I said: That is exactly what you are saying.  She said: Your an asshole, I don't want to hear from you again.  I said: Ok, and left.   Definitely happened pretty hard here. Feminist (who you totally slept with) wants equality. Suddenly starts spouting ""Respect muh vagina"", and you say no, to wit she gets pissed at. The brave alpha shows no remorse and leaves the silly feeeemale to herself.   Woke up this morning with 7 missed calls and 11 texts, saying that she was sorry and that she wants to earn my respect. She saw how she was wrong and asked to cook me dinner.   Of course. I cannot think of a more likely end to this completely true story.   I will text her in a couple of days.   Stay strong, alpha.

TheBluePill,3dw45x,Kimmalah,25,Mon Jul 20 03:47:37 2015 UTC,i think RPers think bjs are degrading for women and that we get no pleasure whatsoever out of it (which i guess is true if it's with a RP man) and as we all know anything that is degrading to women is great!  but i personally loooovee giving a good bj to a guy i'm into so idk what they're doing wrong. probably being a fucking asshole doesn't help when you want to get a bj from someone.

(Men need pampering too sometimes)  Play the game where you tell him to close his eyes and guess what you're feeding him by taste and smell alone. (Could be done for dessert, with things like chocolates, and fruit, and frosting)  Pick an area of your apartment that you can set up with some pillows and blankets, so you can make a lovenest.  Maybe roleplay a little, greet him at the door with a drink, call him Mr. Lastname, flirt and tease like you're meeting him for the first time but have heard he's been working hard.  Set the mood with low light and candles, play instrumental music, give the place the ambiance of a romantic restaurant.   These all sounds lovely and fun, but of course it's downvoted because this,    Sounds like what a woman wants and not a man.   But, of course BJ appears frequently and are upvoted.

Downvoted.  and of course,   Are any of these things something your actual real life husband would like? These seem like things a woman wants. What does your actual SO like?

I'm not sure if this is what feminists mean when they talk about ""toxic masculinity,"" but that was the first thing I thought of when I read it. Men whose perception of worth and dignity is based on how he is perceived by women, what women he can have sex with, and what power he has over other men.   TRP is deeply sexist against men. It attracts men who are in pain, rubs salt in the wounds, breaks them down as individuals until they feel totally worthless. Then it offers them a way out by taking out their rage on women. Just sad.

I think if you were taking the 'ideal' notion of what someone calling themselves an 'MRA' should be that's probably right. However MRAs on reddit and, IMO, the majority of the movement itself seem to have a far stronger anti-women/feminism agenda than they do actually advocating for any issues men face in society.

TheBluePill,3dueoe,hibryd,8,Sun Jul 19 16:02:30 2015 UTC,"For as long as I’ve read and commented on Christo-Manosphere blogs a common thread has cropped up again and again; the debate as to whether women have the same moral agency or the same accountability for it as men.    Why isn't this debate over yet? There's been extensive research into this matter in the past. There're a lot of medieval Church manuscripts that can tell you all you need to know. I thought these guys were educated, given all the difficult words they (try to) use. So when a girl does it, it's no longer ''amoral''? Interesting. Also, if a girl does it, she's a slave to her whims driven by hormones and Cosmopolitan, as opposed to a calculating, rational Dark Triad Genius move. (or whatever they call themselves) So... she's actually extra a-moral? I don't think diving into these guys' brains helps mine though... my hamster's squeaking. (or is that its wheel?)    I’ve always found it fascinating because for all my dealing in cold harsh observable facts (...)   You are so intelligent and philosophical, wow, so deep.   I’ve never paused to consider that women might have some excusable reason for their ethically challenged behavior.    BIOTRUFFLES, you simpleton! We can't help it! I'm having an estrogen attack right now!   In my own estimate Hypergamy isn’t inherently bad or good – it just depends on whether you find yourself on the sharp end of it.   Like I said, amoral. Medieval scholars were wrong there, but for the rest of it, you guys seem to kind of agree.    My point here isn’t to reheat that debate,    Heating that corpse would smell quite ghastly. Indeed, rather not.     but rather to see how it feeds into the rationale that men are in some way responsible for what contemporary women have become,    Ghehe, am I the only one who, with this sentence, imagines some weird hybrid between Elliot Rodgers and a really prudish uptight vicar?    and how they’ll progress if men don’t assume some responsibility for women’s behaviors.   Dunno what he means by that but you can't really be an actual slut-monster all alone in your room wearing a Victorian dress... there's a male accomplice. But that's biotruffles ofc.    but are we presuming our concept of justice is one that’s universally common to that of women?   ''Women''- new studies on this weird species, delivered to you from 1459.    Much in the same way we were Blue Pill conditioned to presume that our idealistic concept of love was mutually shared by women I would propose that men’s concepts of justice, honor, and (from an intrasexual perspective) respect are dissimilar from those of women.   Some people see it as 'unjust' to not get their way, or hear a 'no', or something else they don't like that is actually amoral. I suspect this guy is one of those. She's nice when she does something that suits him, when she does something else that he doesn't like (and that something isn't nice, mean, moral or immoral,  has nothing to do with him or ethics) then she's selfish, shallow, mean, denying him something that he's entitled to, just another dumb vapid slut, etc.   For women, whatever actions serve Hypergamy are justifiable actions.   Yes. Go to any lady's room in a bar or other public setting and you'll see the floor and walls covered with blood, limbs and gouged eyeballs from women fighting over their Alpha of choice. Whatever actions, right?    All that needs to be sorted out is reconciling those action with the concept of justice held by men. In the intersexual arena, what best serves men’s imperatives is justice.   LOL!

Not really gay, I suppose. Maybe he'll try to argue he's bi or something.  Still, there are a handful of gay/bi guys among the TRPers. Jack Donovan is pretty much their apostle. They remain and likely will remain a tiny minority, though, and a fairly amusing one as well. /r/alttrp is a sub for them and it's tiny, less than 700 members. In my experience, pretty much all the gay TRPers are incredibly insecure ""masc"" guys who hate their fellow gays (even folks like the leather dudes and bears) for being too ~effeminate~. As a result, they desperately try to suck up to straight TRPers in the hope of ""turning"" the straight guys or at the very least getting a shred of acceptance they've received from nowhere else.  Needless to say, the plan rarely if ever works. Makes me feel a little bad for them, but not too much. Loosening up a bit and embracing the twink might do wonders for these 'masc' gay dudes, most other gay brothers I've met think they're trying way too hard."

If the woman also works, this hierarcy falls apart, because then there's no reason for the woman to be submissive if she's earning her own money and taking equal role in the relationship.

So taking a few women and spinning it into a biased tale about how any woman who dares to choose a career is doomed to spinsterhood forever is just false.

So, for a guy that has had a hard time ""scoring chicks"" ( oh God, do I hate that saying. It makes me cringe just typing it), I can see how it would appeal to a younger guy. These ""nice guys"" see their friends hooking up while they are the perpetual wingman sitting at home while their friends are getting laid. Like another poster said, the amount of macho bullshit that is constantly being shoved in our faces that equate sex with masculinity is incredible. You see women saying ""I want a nice guy"" but then go home with a Red Pill douche. After the nice guy graduates, gets a good job, and is doing well, these girls decide that they screwed up by ignoring him and then want to date or whatever. I have seen some of the posts on TRP and they have a name for it. Please excuse the vulgarity but they call it the ""cock carousel"" meaning that after a young lady has ""sowed her oats"" then they want a relationship with the nice guy. When looking at it from that point of view (and again, I personally do not subscribe to that philosophy), I can understand it a little better.    yeah, ok. Doesn't TRP have a monthly thread begging their subscribers to pretend they're not terpers out in the wild? Bet you a dollar this guy's a twerp on another account and one of his bros gilded him.

Her first ultrasound is when she would have known she was having twins.  Which means she peed on the stick and found out she was pregnant WAY more than two weeks ago, as the guy's post claims. She found out she was pregnant, saw her doctor to confirm, saw her doctor again at about 4-6 weeks, saw her doctor again at about 10 weeks, had an ultrasound to figure out she was having twins, and then bought her husband 4 baby shoes and 2 baby onesies because ""two weeks ago"" she found out she was having twins?   terps don't know how shit works, more news at 11"

Tubal ligation sits at about 2% of women becoming pregnant after the procedure. Unfortunately that idiot TRPer doesn't understand that no birth control method (aside from abstinence) is perfect.

I worked with a young lady who had the same type of IUD I do (hormone version), and she got pregnant with her IUD in place and then because of the complications due to having the IUD that doctors didn't want to remove for fear of damaging the fetus, then miscarried.

They aren't acting out of anything other then selfishness and a sense of entitlement. Chances are, the only person playing that game is them.

Thoughts:  -Even IF they believe 'AWALT': that still does not excuse making another person's life miserable. I don't like certain people, but I won't abuse them just because I don't like them. If I choose to get into a relationship with a person I don't like: My own stupid fault. Even if my SO treats me like shit (and actually does something bad to me, as opposed to 'just existing as an unlikable person') than it is still not okay for me to start manipulating and emotionally destroying him. So, even if you believe AWALT and whatnot, their behaviour is STILL not okay imo, and the manipulation etc isn't just a shitty belief but a conscious decision to treat a human being with feelings a way you'd never want to be treated yourself.  -I happen to be so lucky to know (of) several manosphere people (different flavours, though) and they're for the most part not people who got totally screwed over by a harsh life, but are immature people who grew up pretty privileged in an emotionally safe and stable environment.  -I'm capable of understanding that Man A isn't Man B, (I can't even compare people, brain won't do it, I just see totally different individuals), and thinking AWALT is a self induced blindness for individuality. It just shows how little you understand about 'people' and spouting your ignorance as a form of new-found wisdom just makes you look like a total buffoon.  -As said before, they consciously plot their abuse. That by far outweighs anything else.  -A criminal might end up in jail. That sucks for him. Perhaps he even had a really difficult childhood. Being in jail is no fun. But he did it himself. I mean, this person suffers to a more or lesser extent, yes, but what's the point in saying 'I feel sorry for people who're in jail'? Not that they don't deserve humane treatment, but... why them, they have victims and they made shitty choices. Not a native speaker, but hopefully what I mean comes across. I don't think there's much of a point in feeling sorry for them. Like... yeah. Being a Terp probably sucks. Now what?   At the same time, I do hope they end up in a better place than where they're at now. But I find it hard to feel sorry for abusers.

Evo psych isn't really accepted science.  And the use of the term ""low status"" is kind of misleading. It means guys who are doing poorly in a video game and has nothing to do with how he is in real life."

TheBluePill,3dijyc,vivestalin,23,Thu Jul 16 22:12:09 2015 UTC,"Well that isn't really how sociological studies work. There is no information in the study of the real lives outside of the video game of the men in question. You can choose to personally interpret the results to mean something much broader, but that isn't what the study is saying.  If we are going to make fun of TweRPs for using evo psych or faulty interpretations of studies, then we should avoid using evo psych or making faulty interpretations ourselves.  A better interpretation is that these men in this highly competitive environment were more likely to express negative emotions and act more aggressive when it was a woman achieving a higher status than them in the game than when a man achieved higher game status.   This suggests that men behaved according to a social hierarchy. When they were performing poorly – i.e. they were lower status – they did not challenge a male-voiced teammate, but they did challenge a female-voiced one.   I just think that the article should have stopped before going all evo psych ""beta male""."

From my experience playing games online, men bully women because they want to genuinely have sex with them and must stand out among the other men to garner their attention. Getting someone's attention doesn't always have to be a positive experience. Some women enjoy being berated because they are smart enough to not take it seriously, especially IN A VIDEO GAME.   I love being bullied online by men! It definitely makes me want to have sex with them because clearly bullying=they want to have sex with me=I want to have sex with them! I totally wanted to have sex with that guy who stalked my posts on my main account last year! I got him banned from a subreddit, which clearly meant that I wanted to have sex with him!

TheBluePill,3dijyc,Suppiluliuma_I,32,Fri Jul 17 08:08:20 2015 UTC,"For clarification ""Low status"" in the context of this study mean men who are performing poorly at video games.  From the abstract:  We show that lower-skilled players were more hostile towards a female-voiced teammate, especially when performing poorly. In contrast, lower-skilled players behaved submissively towards a male-voiced player in the identical scenario. This difference in gender-directed behaviour became more extreme with poorer focal-player performance. We suggest that low-status males increase female-directed hostility to minimize the loss of status as a consequence of hierarchical reconfiguration resulting from the entrance of a woman into the competitive arena. Higher-skilled players, in contrast, were more positive towards a female relative to a male teammate. As higher-skilled players have less to fear from hierarchical reorganization, we argue that these males behave more positively in an attempt to support and garner a female player’s attention.

TheBluePill,3dijyc,idigmythology,3,Thu Jul 16 19:14:22 2015 UTC,"My WoW hardcore raiding experience tells me the same thing. I was always top of my DPS score for my class/spec, I was always regarded as a great addition to the raid. The guys who played well looked at me as equal, and we would share strategies and shit. I did fairly decent in arenas too with my two male friends who never said anything sexist to me unless it was clearly a joke (and I would respond something similar in return, it was fun). But the rest? Peck peck peck. I had the advantage at least of them not knowing my gender, because there was no way to talk in the game unless vent/TS info was shared. So I'd let my skills do the talking. And considering most guys use female avatars, there's no real sense in assuming I was a real girl.  What can you do? I guess nothing. Since I learned very early in my ""online gaming career"" that you have to throw punches as you take them, I'd trash talk them too. I'm not proud of this, but it's something I felt I had to do in order to get respect from strangers in games. I have to say it worked, but to be honest, it's not how I am IRL.

""Low status"" has to be measured by some criterion and that should be an obvious question about the study for anyone. The term is often used for socio-economic status, but that raises a serious problem for any study because among a room full of men socio-economic status is not always obvious.   Gaming scoreboards create a very clear hierarchy. This actually seems like a great way to investigate how people might react to their place in a hierarchy and to women 'disrupting' hierarchies.

I'm not saying you should shower her with positive attention, either, since that's never going to come off well. But other than feeling threatened, I see no reason to react with hostility because you hear a female voice.  I used to play on a server which was owned/run by a woman, and it was hilarious to watch the guys who harassed women get destroyed by those same women.

TheBluePill,3dijyc,Capncorky,14,Fri Jul 17 04:09:33 2015 UTC,"Notable is the idea that bullying is a way to reinforce the pecking order and manifests more in strictly regulated and competitive hierarchy. My immediate thought was toward the red pill boys. They bill themselves as a self-improvement sub, and talk about sexual strategy, but its all about wanting to attain alpha status because they literally cannot conceive of any other social order other than a strict hierarchy. Which is so silly.   And they claim that this is based on evolutionary psychology, which is BS. They have no refined understanding of primate or early human behavior at all they are working with the most rudimentary understanding of animal societies. If we were close relatives of dogs, it might make sense. But primates? nope.  First of all, primate mating behavior varies tremendously, ranging from monogamy to (gasp!) polyandry (MMF is the preferred family structure for tamarins, dyk?).  Even if we narrow down to our closest relatives, Chimps, their theories don't hold up. Despite popular belief, there is no consistent mating advantage to being an alpha chimp. In fact, females will frequently evade alpha males while in estrous, and sneak off to mate with the betas because they are better mates and parents. Its an evolutionary advantage NOT to be an alpha, because a) you're more like to successfully mate and b) you're less likely to die in a stupid fight for superiority.  But try talking to them about actual primatology and they plug their ears and repeat their mantras."

Intimacy is no more a right than sex is. People may crave it as much as others crave sex, but at the end of the day no one owes you that, either.

The thinking here is that, indeed, sex is a human need and thus there should be a positive right to be able to have it.   He does know sex leads to pregnancy pretty frequently without contraception, right? And pregnancy is - by a Grand Canyon sized jump - a health issue, especially considering all the fuckery pregnancy can do to a person it absolutely is a matter of personal health & the right to govern one's body. I'm not an expert, but I'm fairly confident feminist will lobby for BC access for men when it becomes available. Hell, condoms are free at any health clinic you want to visit.   This is like saying access to STD checks means sex is a right. AND completely ignores women who take BC for medical reasons - like cramps - and not for sex.   In other words, it seems that women tend to see sex for women as a universal right but not for men.    All this has done was prove that feminist fight for the right for women to control their bodies. Taking BC does not entitle a person to sex - just the same as picking up a condom from the health clinic doesn't mean Stacey the nurse has to hop on your junk because its a ""right"" of yours to fuck. Jesus. Fucking. Christ.   However, this ignores two fundamental human truths. The first, and less important one, is the increased male sex drive which is higher than that of females. This means that men actually have a greater need for sex than females.   Ah, and here we go.   The second is the mate selection process that casts men as initiators and women as the far more selective sex. In other words, an unattractive female will have a much easier time finding a sexual partner than an unattractive male. There is, when it comes to access to sex, a gender disparity favoring women.   Alright, I'll concede that. I don't think it's that black & white, but there is truth to it.   If sex is part of health care and health care is a human right (I don't agree with either of these points by the way), then feminists need to be straightforward about the fact that they are okay with depriving a significant segment of the male population of their rights.   Let's take this at face value for a second: how would feminists - or, anyone - go about addressing this absurd overlook of rights? Would you force women to fuck men they have absolutely no desire to fuck? Does the 'right' to sex trump a person's right to consent and agency? What - exactly - is the strategy to fix this gross violation of this 'right'?"

TheBluePill,3djfyi,carriondawns,3,Thu Jul 16 20:55:54 2015 UTC,"What - exactly - is the strategy to fix this gross violation of this 'right'?   There is actually one part of his rant that could be addressed. It's this:   The second is the mate selection process that casts men as initiators and women as the far more selective sex.   Men are cast as the initiators generally. And women are encouraged to be more passive. This (I imagine) does generally lead to men experiencing more active rejection than women do. For the most part, a woman just doesn't get noticed. For men, they're actually told no. Those two things have different impacts on the ego.   The solution, of course, is to encourage both men and women to initiate and to encourage both to be as selective as their values system demands. With society not shaming those who are non-selective, and those who are extremely selective.   Long story short. Feminists are trying to fix this. RPers are trying to perpetuate it."
TheBluePill,3djfyi,micahjava,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:00:16 2015 UTC,"I'd say we are all entitled to intamacy and sex, just not from any specific person. If someone else doesn't give it to u, they are not violating your rights."
TheBluePill,3djfyi,juniperbunch,4,Fri Jul 17 20:47:41 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's a difference of need and entitlement. Yes, human beings need socialization to be fully functioning members of society, which includes intimacy and sex. But entitled? No. That implies that it puts the responsibility of YOUR happiness on another person, regardless if they have any interest in your happiness or not. Just because that guy Ted down the street hasn't gotten laid in a while does not mean that I, a person who has no interest in Ted, need to make it my duty to give him the intimacy he needs.    You might say, yeah but if you say no that's your right and Ted can find it somewhere else, but it stands to question, so who's job IS it to make sure Ted gets his intimacy? Sure, I say no, but does that make it Linda from down the streets job? Who's going to be the one at the end of the list the responsibility of Teds happiness falls to?  Intimacy is a need, not an entitlement. Humans are entitled to nothing in this world."

TheBluePill,3djfyi,SnapshillBot,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:04:01 2015 UTC,"The last line was not meant seriously.  If there was a right to sex that is similar to the right to work, the government would have first try to find out what social conditions are responsible for the inability of some people find an intimate partner. And then it would try to find ways to help those people.  My best guess would be that the underlying cause is mostly some degree of social isolation (and that is a much larger problem than just lack of sex). That is the problem social programs would need to tackle (hypothetically speaking). Though fully fledged terpers would have to get a lot of toxic ideas out of them as well."

TheBluePill,3dim6v,TheCodeSamurai,8,Thu Jul 16 21:39:26 2015 UTC,"I'm bored, so let's try a dissection. Ready the scalpel!   ""Hi, I'm Noh Wang, and I think I'm a hopeless case.    All you need to do is get some homophobia (the sexism square is from the sidebar and environment before I got to this passage) and you get hate bingo!    I'm Chinese, 5'1, 110lbs, a virgin, and hopelessly shy. Women never notice me, and I can't muster up the courage to talk to them. I've never looked anyone in the eye since I learned to walk. Every night I go home and soak my pillow with tears, hating myself for being me. I know I will never be Alpha, but can you please help me, or just tell me it's hopeless so I can kill myself (except I'm too much of a pussy to actually do it). I'm so miserable. Please help.""   Wait: does being alpha entail killing yourself if you think about it or someone dares you?    You are talking like a bitch. Don't talk to me as if you were a bitch.   Example: Woof! Woof! wooooooo... Well, that's at least what happened when I asked one how they talk.   I'm going to take a wild guess here, Wang, and say you were raised with an absent, uninvolved, or pussified father.    Well that got heavy fast. I'm also intrigued that it's the father's role to tell their sons, ""Hey son, if you ever need help because you're in a tough time in your life, make sure to ask for help while avoiding any language that puts responsibility on you and instead, you should ask for help in your life like you're asking for someone to get you a glass of water: just say ""I'm thirsty"" and get your wife to do it!""   Because you are speaking woman-language to me, and you are trying to get woman-help.   So I'm taking from this two things: that women by nature speak in grovelling tone to their male friends/captains, and that the help that you'd give women is not worthy of men.   This actually is a good encapsulation of the problem: this advice shouldn't be gendered. Self-esteem issues and generalized physique problems are not gendered, and the same advice should hold true.    You are trying to get me to rescue you. To fix your feelings.    Yeah, fuck that shit! Why would I ""fix"" your feeeeels when I could just slap you across the face and tell you to pull yourself up by your bootstraps?   To dry your bitch-tears and tell you it'll be all right.   Fun fact: bitches have different tears from the rest of us. Also, why would I tell you you'll be all right? That might even give you the hope you need to turn your life around!   That's how bitches talk. Bitches talk like that because it works for them. If I see a cute little piece of girl crying and begging for help, my male protective instincts are going to kick in.    First of all, ""cute piece of girl"" is really more along the lines of ""Hey! I just came back from the morgue and I have a cute new piece of girl we can mount on the wall!"" and less ""Hey! A cute piece of girl just asked me to sort her life out despite my complete incompetence in doing so!"". Secondly, do you just tell men who ask for help to go fuck themselves? The answers will come soon.   I'm going to feel some sympathy, and maybe pick her up, dust her off, and parent her a little bit, teasing her for being so upset at this silly little problem   Eh, your life is in shambles right now, but who cares! You're a bitch!   and here's what we're going to do about it. Then I will fuck that bitch so deeply that whoever pulls me out will be declared King of All England and Scotland, and things won't seem so bad anymore.   I mean, what would be the point of having a ""relationship"" where my partner was a proud human being who didn't need me to sort her life out!   That's men are wired.    Evo psych biotruffles and bad grammar. I wanna see a parenthetical citation or I'm calling bullshit.   Bitches talk like that because it works for bitches. If they cry, big strong Vikings like me come along and give them a big helping of Alpha male attention and Alpha male cock, after which they have nothing to cry about anymore.   The Vikings killed babies by throwing them up in the air and catching them with spears, so I would skip adding yourself to that group. Also, I was getting the impression your made-up strawman wanted more than just a single fuck and some attention.   And bitches taught you to talk like that because they are bitches and that's what they know.    Wait, what the fuck? Are there classes on this? Where can I sign up? Can I at least marathon a TV show to teach it to me?   Bitches aim for sympathy because it works for them when they do. But you know what you get if you talk to me like a bitch? Contempt, that's what.    Except if you are a bitch, because we just discussed what happened if a bitch did that. Wait, but don't all bitches ""talk like a bitch"" by definition? So while giving them ""Alpha male cock"" you're also disgusted by them (wait a sentence) and holding them in contempt? Your head is a fascinating place.   You disgust me. It's as sickening as if you had put on lipstick and a dress. Because you are not a cute little piece of girl, you are a man. And you sicken me when you don't talk like one.   Sorry, I forgot the transphobia square of hate bingo. Also, I guess this isn't really just trans people, but also transvestites, so put that on a square too. And I guess we could just make the homophobia square generalized LGBT hate, so yay! You won hate bingo!   The first thing you need to do, Wang, is talk like a man. Don't aim for sympathy.    Why would you want someone to sympathize with your problems? Don't make me laugh.   Aim for respect.  The bitches who raised you never taught you to aim for respect because they don't know how, and it doesn't work for them anyway.    So your imaginary strawman's absent/uninvolved/pussified father was also a bitch?   Of course they don't do it. A bitch aiming for respect is as disgusting as a man angling for pity.    Two things here: men don't ever deserve pity (not even the people who have cancer or die in a plane crash or whatever?) and bitches don't deserve respect (even the ones who win Wimbledon or climb Everest or shit like that?).    It's as sickening as if she had stopped shaving her legs, put on a false mustache, and started swearing like a sailor.    I guess this is a new game of hate bingo? Square one is filled!   Bitches get sympathy. Men get respect. Drill that into your fucking skull, Wang. I know you have very little to brag about right now, but if you do not strive for my respect, I will not help you.   Wait, but I thought this guy didn't get respect? He is a man, so wouldn't he get respect? Also, no one asked you for your help, FYI. You mimed someone to do it.    So if all you have is pain, then impress me with how manfully you bear it.   Fuck yeah! Just take all that pain and push it deep down inside of you until you develop mental health problems! Then push that down in there until you flip out and strangle the clerk at the DMV! Wait, shit.   Take responsibility. You have a long road ahead of you, but show me you're ready to pick up your fucking backpack and march, and I will point you in the right direction.   I'm gonna ask for a second opinion on the right direction.    Tell me this: ""Hi, I'm Dam Sun, and I've got a shit-load of work to do. I'm Chinese, 5'1, 110lbs, a virgin, and hopelessly shy. Women never notice me, and I haven't yet mustered up the courage to talk to them. I don't look people in the eye, and I have a lot negative self-talk that I need to fucking stop doing. I've read the sidebar, and I know many of the places I need to go, but there are so many things to fix that it's hard to know where to start. What I think I need is a set of easy intermediate goals, a few homework assignments to get me started. So I'm asking for suggestions.""   This is really more of a denouement if you will, so I'll skip restating myself, but I will point out that you got the racism square of hate bingo again!   Now at least you're talking like a man.    You stopped writing soon after this, so I'm gonna have to cut it close and call another hate bingo win!    I'll still kick your lazy ass for being lazy and needing your hand held, because I came up with this shit and did it when there was no TRP at all to help me   /r/humblebrag   ""I figured out how to be a jackass without any jackasses to help me out!""   but at least that kick will be a force pushing you in the right direction. At least you'll be worth berating, which is a start, and more than you'll get from talking to me like a bitch.   Wait, you're berating your strawman right now! How is that more than you'll get the other way!   Better yet, read the fucking sidebar, lurk TRP and askTRP, work on yourself as if you were just another man who needed the standard advice and not a custom program, and, a year later, write me this: ""Hi, I'm Long Wang, and I've made some progress I need to know how to capitalize on. A year ago, I was a 5'1, 110 lb Chinese guy with severe shyness. I read the sidebar, went into monk mode, started lifting, cut sugar out of my diet, did a cycle or two of Test-cyp and Tren, practiced talking to strangers. Now I'm 5'1 and 160 lbs and ripped, and I can look people in the eye and talk to them. I've started seeing women's eyes sparkle when they look at me, but I don't quite know how to turn attraction to lays. Any advice on good resources and tactics for sealing the deal?"" Then you'll have my respect.   So we don't have enough time for another game of Hate Bingo, folks, but can I at least say that Long Wang is so unoriginal I have like butterflies in my stomach? Also, you do know that most monks don't spend their time getting laid and kicking ass, right? Really more of an intellectual job, that one.  Eh, that took a long time.

It’s the RESULTS from working your job –the security of a house, the happiness brought on by items bought using your paycheck- that truly provides these feelings for them.  That’s not to say she isn’t impressed with your ability to work that job, but because she has little to no understanding of the complexity of that job and learning about said complexity does not provide her with the “feel-good” sensation she requires, she deems it as unimportant. It exists outside of her perspective.   TIL that no woman has ever been a Senior Technical Engineer, ever.   Ever hear a woman utter the phrase ""I want this moment to last forever"" in a RomCom?

Americans still talk about their ""Puritan work ethic"" and the rugged individualism of the people that formed the foundation of the U.S. cultural values before the American Revolution. Australians, it seems to me, have nothing like that. Their two largest economy sectors, education and mining, both revolve around siphoning money from other social groups -- indigenous Australians and foreign students who choose Australia as a third choice when, for whatever reason, they are unable to go to school in a more favorable English speaking country. From what I can gather, Australians of English descent are overwhelmingly racist, but because their economy is so much based on the sycophantic relationship with the social groups whom they must interact with (Asian students and the indigenous peoples) they must keep it to themselves. It does not seem to me to be a heritage to be really proud of....any shame?"

TheBluePill,3ddjvh,FeminaziJournalist,12,Wed Jul 15 20:42:51 2015 UTC,"So basically women are all sluts who put up token resistance because they don't want people (j/k women and betas don't count) alpha males to find out they are sluts, so if she gives you any sign that she doesn't want your ALPHA PEEN, just ignore that and rape away?  Yeah, kinda figured that's what that was about. Ugh. These people disgust me. Reading things they post reminds me of that time in high school when I overheard a conversation between a bunch of chicks in <extra curricular group I was casually associated with> talking about some total creep who raped one of their friends, and how he'd previously assaulted and creeped out a bunch of chicks both present and not present, and one of them made a halfhearted joke about how it was practically part of <group> initiation to have this dude try to grope you, and then they said his name and it was the dude who had raped me a year prior and he had raped this other chick more recently so then I just buried that shit for a couple years because I didn't want people to blame me for this other girl's rape because I didn't speak up...  Just total bad grossness."
TheBluePill,3ddjvh,extroire,3,Wed Jul 15 21:14:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly. And unfortunately it is a pretty common practice in our society, although people generally don't use those words. A large amount of people think it is okay to pressure or manipulate someone into sex. Here is an article about a study on this topic (although I think a study that looked at what all genders are willing to do to other people, and what kind of behavior they think they ""should"" accept or give in to would be a lot more valuable for drawing social conclusions). It's an entitlement thing. A lot of people think that they are entitled to pressure someone into sexual activities, even more so if the other person has already consented to other things. It's pretty shitty.  I'm so sorry that happened to you! That's really scary. I recently discovered the guy who raped me is now in a position of power and influence in Greek life on my campus, and it really makes me wish that I had pushed harder with prosecuting him or some other action against him. But know it isn't your fault that the guy did those things to other girls. That's his fault. And at some point he will get what is coming, especially since he seems to repeat this behavior so often."

But I have largely weeded out the racist and sexist crap from my upbringing out, so I've got that going for me, which is nice."
TheBluePill,3ddjvh,extroire,3,Wed Jul 15 23:53:15 2015 UTC,"Well seeing a therapist would most likely help you with you're social problems and anxieties, whether you are autistic or not. It might be a good idea to try going to one (or a few since it can be hard to find a therapist that works for you), even just to reduce your personal stress.  That's really great about overcoming crap from your upbringing! We all have prejudices we have to overcome. My parents are pretty liberal as far as Deep South baby boomers go, but I still look back, amazed at how many sexist, racist, and socially/economically prejudiced ideas I have ""weeded out"" in the past 3 years since starting college.

TheBluePill,3dfv34,myfirstredditaccnt90,10,Thu Jul 16 02:13:43 2015 UTC,"Judging from the drawing style, I believe the creator of this comic is a guy who has massive insecurities about his Asian heritage (IIRC he's Eurasian) and has a huge inferiority complex.  So I think in this comic he's having a go at white guys who complain about white woman - black man relationships yet have no problem with white men with Asian women. Also, you'll notice that the author has drawn the Asian woman in an ""ugly"" manner because he's got a grudge against Asian women who apparently always go for the superior white guys and never for nice, Asian guys like him. Basically viewing them as ""race traitors"". It's also why the Asian woman says she won't ever date Asian guys.

They just never keep them for long.   Also, I highly doubt this guy's fiancee and ""sub"" know about each other, or that he sees anything wrong with that. And ""on the line"" could mean anything from ""she's obsessed with my mighty thundercock"" to ""she replied to one of my private messages when she was bored.""   If you are in the scene and want to fuck a dominatrix on your terms, don't take her shit, treat her like a sub, and explain to her that she fails to register on your radar as anything other than a submissive.There are no true dominant women, just women who have never been put in their place.   Probably worth pointing out that this is some people's fetish, so it may work well in the short run on those people if you can find them and manage to hide that your lack of respect extends further than is healthy. And in my experience, guys like this tend to get the ""I am not dignifying your infantile behavior with a response"" glare from female dominants and then prove their alpha status by desperately trying to get the women who are ignoring their existence and having fun conversations with people they actually like to pay attention to them."

Being submissive does not make a person weak, and does NOT imply that they want to be raped/degraded/etc. There are many different ways to submit to a partner sexually and BDSM is not a shadow community on which to take out your fucked up sexual fantasies.

Nobody is dehumanising anyone.   They constantly say that men communicate overtly, but over-exaggerating a message and expecting people to get that and not be offended is pretty covert communication. And it is so easy for people to read the exaggerated stuff and think ""Oh, that's a good idea.""  Also, they may not be straight up saying women aren't human, but they sure are dehumanizing us. Even AWALT is dehumanizing because it removes human variability from women. No one can take away my humanity from me, but that doesn't mean that TRP isn't dehumanizing women in their narrative and in the minds of their followers.   So I have no idea why you guys invest so much time and energy into attacking and arguing with them and stressing yourselves out.   I'm not stressed out. This is how I relax between studying and work. And just because I would never go for a TweRP doesn't mean that I don't care that they are spreading such a shitty, illogical ideology.  Also, they never exempt any women from ""AWALT"", especially not for intelligence (many of them think even intelligent women are so emotionally driven that we aren't as intelligent as men) so every time they say that they are attacking and insulting a group I am a part of.   I tend to be more sided to TRP because I've been hurt way too many times by female actions that I can't make any sense of.   Everyone gets hurt, it's part of life. I have been in crappy relationships, I have been used, I have been abused, and I have been raped.

It's not like TRP is spreading lies, as a confused guy there is a lot to learn from that subreddit and apply it to my own life in various shades of purple. TBP rarely teaches me anything except that I think I will avoid 'intelligent' girls from now on.   TRP is spreading lies. Women mature past the age of 18, women are capable of being logical, not all women want to be supported by a man, not all women will cheat on their SO. There is no AWALT in the real world. They are lying every time they say anything like AWALT. And here at TBP we are not trying to teach anyone anything, just point out why TRP is wrong and hopefully get some TweRPs to realize that.  I'm sorry you have trouble with women, but there are plenty of other places that you can go for help with that.

I wouldn't expect anybody to jump straight into something and claim to be an expert without reading/communicating and spending the relevant time to understand and extract what they need to learn for themselves. Anybody that does that is an idiot no matter the subject material. It's not TRP's fault that idiots exist.   they may not be straight up saying women aren't human, but they sure are dehumanizing us. Even AWALT is dehumanizing...   I'm not a big fan of their catch phrases but it stands for ""All Women Are Like That"" it doesn't mean ""All Women Are Literally The Same"". Sure there are exceptions but I have to agree that men and women generally have certain characteristics that are unique to their sex. Denying this is more de-humanising than acknowledgement in my opinion.   I would never go for a TweRP   How would you know for sure if a guy is a TRPer? Also, plenty of guys are already aware of the types of ""tactics"" used by TRPers that have never heard of TRP. TRP is just one of many resources. And some guys simply learn from experience.   Also, they never exempt any women from ""AWALT"", especially not for intelligence (many of them think even intelligent women are so emotionally driven that we aren't as intelligent as men) so every time they say that they are attacking and insulting a group I am a part of.   Intelligence is subjective. I would say in general guys are usually more logically minded than girls, this has nothing to do with me believing anybody is superior, and again, there are always exceptions   Just because some individuals hurt you doesn't mean that everyone is the same way.   I never said it for that reason. I just like to think I understand a bit better why I was hurt and how I can prevent it in future. There is a certain type of male-female psychology which doesn't make sense and while I think TRP has a very negative way of looking at things, they have shed some light on a lot of things which would have continued to confuse me and/or hurt me again in future. I can avoid these situations now or deal with them and hopefully maintain my future relationships a bit better.   TRP is spreading lies. Women mature past the age of 18, women are capable of being logical, not all women want to be supported by a man, not all women will cheat on their SO. There is no AWALT in the real world.

Again, it's up to the reader what they want to believe. I believe that TRPers support each other in a common cause but each member is an individual with their own life going on and hopefully forming their own unique opinions and experiences rather than trying to be a clone or follow a preacher. I don't believe in AWALT but it's not far from the truth and it's a pretty solid template for the behaviour of most girls under certain circumstances.   I'm sorry you have trouble with women, but there are plenty of other places that you can go for help with that. And they will tell you to be confident, work on yourself first, enjoy your own hobbies, don't be codependent. You can get all that advice from anywhere, even shitty clickbait articles, but without all the AWALT and woman hate.   Thanks but self improvement is common sense and men and women will always have problems with eachother. I think there is something to be learned from TRP and I like to consider what they say. In my eyes, if what they say wasn't true, TBP wouldn't exist. Nobody would be debating against TRP if it was internet geeks talking garbage. I don't agree with all of TRP as I've said before. But I also don't agree with girls reading glossy magazines and taking advice on how to control their men. An ex of mine once told me about the way her friends talked about manipulating their boyfriends and I do find it quite scary. I feel more assured having a resource like TRP and being able to avoid being mistreated, I'd rather be prepared for the confusing situations and attractive enough to my partner that they won't leave me/cheat on me for stupid reasons that I could avoid."

If none of it worked, I can only assume they/we would figure out what does.  Life already taught me most of what I learned on TRP.

You know what I find depressing? I can't tell what's real and what's not. What's natural and what's socially engineered into us from birth? All I know is, there have been plenty of times in my life where I thought I was doing the right thing and fighting for love, but what I was really doing was pushing love away.

Good for you if you can spot game and avoid it. I really dislike cocky ignorant alpha male types, especially when girls find them attractive it makes me cringe so bad. Personally, I wish I could just be myself and find an equally attractive girl who would be my best friend for life but it doesn't work like that for most of us. I try to stay true to myself but I wouldn't hesitate to use some TRP tactics to instigate and/or improve a relationship when required.   I am admittedly a smug married to a gross level. My husband is the coolest person I've ever met.   That's good for you and for him. Savour every moment while it lasts. I don't think I'll ever be able to go back there, not like I was before. I'll always be on my toes from now on. As for TRPW, each to their own... I don't think TRP males care about TRPWs' existence either way.   I am really curious what you think you could have done to avoid the breakup? I could be misreading what you're writing but did she ""destroy"" you maliciously or are you saying that the relationship destroyed you without malice from her end?   She ended the relationship. She told me she wanted to be friends and that we would maybe get back together one day. A week after the breakup she said she wasn't sure and wanted to call it a break but no matter what I suggested she seemed to do the total opposite. Almost every reason she told me that we needed to break up, I assured her that she was wrong but she wasn't interested in being logical, she apparently couldn't forget how I made her feel in certain bad situations... But I don't control her feelings, that was all her decision to feel and perceive things how she perceived them. No amount of reasoning could compete with her feelings. Anyway, she basically strung me along for 9 months after the breakup and I was like a puppy dog doing everything she asked of me, pouring my heart out at every opportunity she gave me. She didn't do anything inherently malicious, but she allowed me to alleviate her pain and comfort her and re-assure her when she was feeling hurt. Eventually I couldn't take it any more and I started to get distant... then she decides she wanted to make it work again. Me, wanting to prove myself as a good guy, I went along with it again and allowed her to have what she wanted until she kicked me to the curb again.  There was no real reason for us to be broken up. We were amazing friends, loads of shared interests, we respected eachothers space and freedom, the sex was out of this world... I feel that I pushed away a lot of golden opportunities to win back her affections by giving her too much love. If I had done the opposite and used a bit of jealousy tactics and not told her what she wanted to hear every time I had the chance, I could have made her attracted to me and saved the relationship. What I feel I did, was make myself look very weak and made her lose respect for me. Now it's been way too long and all the awesome things we built are buried in the sands of time apart which is very sad. I don't want to build all those things with someone else again. I was once as happy as you probably are with your husband, if not happier... But I'm more sided with TRP now. I don't want to be destroyed again.  Edit: woah, sorry for the huge rant."
TheBluePill,3dednh,platitudypus,6,Thu Jul 16 16:30:26 2015 UTC,"I don't like to see people suffer, but one person not wanting to be in a relationship is a perfectly good reason to break off a relationship. No further reasons needed. No justifications. I'd want to know why, too, in your place, but I wouldn't invalidate my SO's thoughts and feelings by saying they had to prove to me why we should break up, and if they couldn't prove it, they were irrational and malicious."
TheBluePill,3dednh,EatSkeetSleepRepeat,-2,Thu Jul 16 19:44:14 2015 UTC,"I agree... But she strung me along constantly giving me hope then breaking me, then giving me hope, then breaking me again. When I was nice and caring and trying to be a ""good guy"" I obviously wasn't attractive to her yet when I ignored her or kept my distance, she wanted to talk and even wanted to get back together when I left her alone completely then when she got what she wanted, she destroyed me completely.  Point being - If I had just been an asshole during the breakup, I could have turned it around and saved an amazing relationship. I'm certain she will regret letting me go in future, she probably regrets it now. She always pops up now and again but I can't forgive her after what she let me go through for fear that she'll do it to me again. I don't understand why she treated me like that when I was 110% trying my best to give her exactly what she said she wanted... Considering she was once the best friend I have ever had who could talk to me openly about anything we could ever imagine yet she can't/won't explain her actions during the breakup... and that's why I will never trust a girl again and why I'm more RP than BP.  And that's just the worst situation I've dealt with. I have had plenty of other encounters with girls which defy all logic."
TheBluePill,3dednh,MissMaude,4,Fri Jul 17 12:05:12 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your candor and I'm sorry you went through what was obviously a painful breakup.    Good for you if you can spot game and avoid it.    I really don't believe I am a special snowflake in this regard, in my experience most women don't like this behavior. To quote my husband, ""Game is just sad people taking advantage of other sadder people.""   In general I do not understand TRP denial/ignoring what seems obvious to me: some people are garbage. No disrespect but it sounds like your ex was a nightmare person from garbage town not because she was a woman but because she was selfish and manipulative. TRP is an attempt to make sense of a senseless world where some people are just jerks. I think its attempts are hamfisted at best and at worst result in pushing away the non-jerks.    Savour every moment while it lasts.    Was that a read? :) But really, a happy marriage isn't something that happens to you- it's something you build and foster. I don't think I found my soulmate, I think I found a good man with whom I share values and life goals. We fight well. We're committed to growing together. That's not magic and that doesn't fade. I think in a very high level way, TRP and I are aligned on that but I think their approach is flat wrong."
TheBluePill,3dednh,Sleela17,5,Thu Jul 16 17:31:24 2015 UTC,"you aren't the types of girls that TRP wants to attract and I would assume that they are not the types of guys that you want to attract either... So I have no idea why you guys invest so much time and energy into attacking and arguing with them and stressing yourselves out.   I can't speak for everyone, but the reason I have such a visceral, negative response to it is that I was raised in an environment that (aside from the religious influence) most TRPers would consider ideal, and it was horribly traumatizing and left me with a lifetime of emotional issues. I then dated a man who, while he didn't call himself ""red pill"" (I'm not even sure if the movement existed at the time), exhibited the traits that RPers aspire to. He ended up being abusive -- first emotionally, then verbally and financially, and toward the end physically. When I read the RP forum it's like I'm looking into the minds of the two men who have caused me the most pain in my life: my father and my abusive ex-boyfriend.  The fact that they're trying to attract emotionally stunted, immature girls is WHY I have a problem with it. I was that girl when I was 19, and I fell for what would be considered a ""red pill"" guy. It got me abused and stalked.  And the usual response to me telling this story is, ""Well if he was abusive we wasn't TRULY red pill/alpha/whatever,"" so if that's what you're going to say don't bother. I don't care if TRP's goal isn't to create abusive men. The ideas they preach are the same ones that lead to men being abusive. I've seen it many, many times and I'm over the excuses."
TheBluePill,3dednh,gregariousnefarious,3,Thu Jul 16 17:53:40 2015 UTC,"I am sorry that happened to you, and am appreciative of your insight. I wholeheartedly agree...trp makes more excuses than actual points. Debating them is like trying to nail jello to the wall....but since their whole deal is to excuse themselves from the responsibility of being good people,  it's no surprise"
TheBluePill,3dednh,gregariousnefarious,3,Thu Jul 16 19:34:12 2015 UTC,"No, they're definitely spreading platitudes that are false (at least cannot be applied across the board). Just cause you were hurt and want someone to tell you it wasn't your fault and that it was HER NATURE that made things go south does not mean it's true. Note: I'm not saying it WAS your fault, but trp is all about removing any male responsibility for failed relationships.  It takes 2 to fuck something up, almost always"
TheBluePill,3dednh,EatSkeetSleepRepeat,-1,Thu Jul 16 18:55:43 2015 UTC,"True... Kinda... Not saying such a thing couldn't exist but I've never met a girl who likes to accept responsibility for her actions in a relationship. Most times I've been wronged by a girlfriend, the girl has ended up making it all about her because I got annoyed and reacted to what she did.  Problems in a ""decent"" relationship are usually always pinned on the guy. But when the guy tries to fix the relationship (in my experience and friends' experiences) it's basically a crazy guessing game because the girl is most likely either lying, sugar coating or she genuinely can't understand her own thoughts enough to have an honest conversation.  Most problems in relationships as far as I can tell are resolved by the guy stepping down and allowing the girl to ""win"" the arguments, buy her flowers, take her out to dinner etc. and forget about it until she decides to bring it up in the next argument."
TheBluePill,3dednh,gregariousnefarious,3,Fri Jul 17 12:33:09 2015 UTC,"Interesting, my experience is not in line with this assessment of how women win arguments all the time just due to emotionality, if anything being emotionally compromised makes a lot of women retreat from conflict because they feel overwhelmed, or start in on a topic that's not relevant to the matter at hand. Sure the dude might do something at that point to make her feel better, but the root of the conflict may well remain unresolved and is thus bound to come up again and again. Perhaps you and your friends are dealing with emotionally immature women (age does make a difference when it comes to relationship conflict resolution and the degree to which either partner denies responsibility for an issue). I don't know. What I do know is that if you find yourself dating someone who refuses to take responsibility for negative outcomes that affect you directly, you should back off and assess whether or not they can gain some empathy for you, in which case proceed to work with them on it rationally, or whether they're just too selfish to be in a relationship with you."

The girl will retreat/ignore/withhold sex and the guy will convince himself that he wronged her or she will manipulate him into getting what she wants... whatever way you want to look at it, girls usually always get the apologies.   I've never had a relationship with anyone over 25 admittedly.  And yes, I will in future be backing off and ignoring the girl until she talks to me and resolves the problem. I won't be literally dread gaming her but if she wants to believe that I'm sneaking off to see someone else when I go out for a drive to clear my head... that's up to her. She can talk to me when she's ready."
TheBluePill,3dednh,EatSkeetSleepRepeat,-6,Fri Jul 17 14:43:56 2015 UTC,"I know that I messed up. I'm not a TRPer but having found TRP,  I think I'm more prepared for my next relationship. There are some immature, angsty peope on there but on the whole, it's pretty interesting to read."

TheBluePill,3dednh,EatSkeetSleepRepeat,-1,Thu Jul 16 19:31:07 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go as far as dread gaming... but next time a girl tries to manipulate me by refusing sex, I won't be pandering to her."
TheBluePill,3dednh,gregariousnefarious,2,Fri Jul 17 12:23:00 2015 UTC,"I think that goes without saying, people who use sex in a relationship to get their way aren't to be trusted. But I think the trp trope that women are always leveraging sex is dead wrong and makes them forget that women like sex too, which pushes the needle of perception of sex as a commodity exchange even further into the red. Sex is not a commodity that women use to get their way, at least not healthy women who actually fancy their partners. If you feel that you're being denied sex in a relationship and it's manipulative, then there are a few things going on: she's not sexually attracted to you, or she's got some other issues to deal with. Either way, you're better off not trying to think of a way to ""trick"" her into wanting you like trp advocates, but cutting to the root of the problem, which is either that she doesn't want you sexually as much as you want her, or you've got a broken perception of her libido and motives. I feel like trp dudes who don't score with a gf as much as they want are very likely to make an attribution error and assume that the girl is trying to manipulate them with a commodity, where that's rarely the case."
TheBluePill,3dednh,EatSkeetSleepRepeat,-2,Fri Jul 17 14:07:20 2015 UTC,"I know that girls like sex. I've had girlfriends tell me in the past how their friends use sex to get what they want thogh and that disturbs me... If a girls libido doesn't match mine then the relationship isn't going to last. It doesn't matter what her reason is, unless of course she's going through a temporary bad time I can understand that and I'll support her.   Withholding sex during arguments instead of resolving the problem, however, is a really bad choice. It leads to bitterness and cheating. I would't hesitate to use some fear/jealousy tactics if my girlfriend is both ignoring me and withholding sex instead of resolving the situation... on top of that, I like to resolve arguments by having sex. No amount of arguing resolves an argument but some good passionate angry sex usually relieves the tension and allows the 2 people to open up and talk about it properly after the sex. Of all the best relationships I've had, argument sex was a key element."
TheBluePill,3dednh,AWeepingAngelsThesis,30,Fri Jul 17 14:32:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you don't ask a fish how to catch it! Feeeeemales lie about what they want to throw betas off the trail. What they REALLY want is a certified alfalfa who can figure it out for himself."
TheBluePill,3dednh,maybe_little_pinch,25,Wed Jul 15 17:58:53 2015 UTC,"As a fisher, I sure would love to ask the fish what they are eating that day.

TheBluePill,3dednh,AWeepingAngelsThesis,19,Wed Jul 15 19:35:02 2015 UTC,"The other problem with that analogy is that most women WANT to have sex, whereas most fish DON'T WANT to be speared through the lip, drowned, and hacked to pieces with a knife.   I think twerps use that analogy because for most women, sex with a twerp is about as appealing as being speared through the lip, drowned, and hacked to death with a knife. So twerps assume women view all sexual interactions that way, when really, women just don't want to sleep with twerps."
TheBluePill,3dednh,assistantpimppancho,6,Wed Jul 15 20:25:11 2015 UTC,"Good point. ""you don't ask a fish how to catch fish"" doesn't make sense. It's more similar to ""you don't ask victims how to be robbed"".  Having women tell you what women like is beneficial to everyone. Women get sex. Men get sex. Everyone is happy. It's more like asking a fish how to avoid accidentally hooking it while you drop food in the water for it to eat."

TheBluePill,3dednh,gregariousnefarious,3,Thu Jul 16 10:41:53 2015 UTC,"A reason they do this is one of the appeals of RP when people first join. The same way cults build membership. The message doesn't seem crazy at first and they use the promise of something people want to draw them in.  Usually people go to RP because they were hurt in the past. RP talks about how everyone is really the same deep down. If you know for certain what will happen, you can't get hurt. They are scared of vulnerability and lack of control. RP promises answers to this things and how to work them in their favor.  The same way cults seem reasonable first with a promise of something people want, usually based on fears they have. A common example is answering where they go when they die. If you know for sure, it'll be less scary. Pretty much the same idea.  This guy denying you know what you want, wouldn't work for him because he would have to admit he doesn't know. Which is scary."

TheBluePill,3dednh,gregariousnefarious,3,Thu Jul 16 15:42:12 2015 UTC,"Good post. Having spent some time on TRP forum, I can answer why this is. Many or most there have decided that the ONLY strategy to deal with women is ""pump and dump"". Women are incapable of loving, so they only exist for sex. If you want someone to actually talk to, talk to your bros. Women have no value other than sex acts and maybe cooking you a meal, but if you want to talk about real things with them then you are clearly BLUE PILL BETA.   Of course, their strategies ""work"" on specific women who are easy to manipulate, which is exactly who they are pumping and dumping. It's way too hard for them to go for a woman that actually wants a real relationship, so they run away from those types.  And of course, women don't know what women want, that's what men are there to tell them for.  TL;DR Pump and dump is the only viable strategy with women, because AWALT"

TheBluePill,3dednh,gregariousnefarious,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:10:24 2015 UTC,"Yep. Also, women who are pumped and dumped who want a relationship then reinforce their beliefs about women....running away from said player (hypergamy), trying to get positive attention in unhealthy ways (shit tests, comfort tests, girl dread), and blowing up the relationship with drama. I mean, who likes getting used? I'd act like an irrational child if I were emotionally invested in someone who played hot and cold all the time....especially when I was new to the dating game"

TheBluePill,3dednh,Iwillpixiecutyou,3,Thu Jul 16 18:44:40 2015 UTC,"Yep that sums it up pretty nicely. It's a great feat of self delusion and collective mob rage. And anytime some woman disputes their tactics, it's either 1. You're ugly so who cares what you think, or 2. You don't know what works with women because women are soooo irrational they have no idea what they like.    It's amazing to me that they never consider the reasons why many women won't cop to liking ""bad boys"" and players: namely that these guys hurt women often, and since women are also constantly warned against players by parents, friends, and mentors that it causes women to feel ashamed of negative romantic experiences with men who treated them like meat (basically,  you deserved it because you weren't smart enough to steer clear of that douchebag). In an ideal world, trp users would have some empathy for the possible pain that women experience when they hook up with or date an a-hole, at least in that way they'd realize that although everybody makes mistakes and gets hurt, most people grow from that experience and it helps them learn what they actually do want. This is not to say all women have a bad boy black knight in their past, but I know many women who do (myself included), and although that experience was not ideal, it taught me a guiding principle that's been the roadmap for the rest of my dating life: find someone who is kind and unselfish,  who I can be kind and unselfish toward in return, and steer clear of self centered assholes who dgaf.    Another thing that troubles me, with all the above being considered, trp dudes are looking to be that ""mistake guy"" who, if he lands a reasonable woman, will leave him when the ugly specter of crappy behavior rears its head. That they are seeking to exploit women who are inexperienced and may not have the self worth to see (and get mad about) dating someone who's treating them like crap is a given, and as such all their negative beliefs about women are reinforced.   Example time:    Trp dude dates Alex, a hot college girl with no prior relationship experience. He dread games her and she gets mad and leaves,  finding someone else to suit her tastes. HYPERGAMY UGH BITCHES!!!! or...she sticks around because she doesn't think she deserves better, but she's an emotional wreck because she feels unloved, and sometimes attempts to get this dude to show her some kindness, possibly through passive aggressive and covert communication... FUCKIN IRRATIONAL BITCHES BE CRYING AND SHIT TESTING ME ALL THE TIME ARG!!!    Trp ""philosophy"" really is a hot mess, because its goal is to kill empathy toward both women and men and dull emotional growth, instead of letting people reflect when they fail at love, it reinforces behaviors that poison the well in relationships.     Finally, and I know I've rambled but it's cathartic, trp denigrates women who have learned things in life, which is a bad call if you're trying to find a sweet, awesome person who will work to make you happy.  Without my ride on the cc (see a few ltrs, strs, and an ons here and there), I would suck in bed, wouldn't know that some arguments are just not worth having in relationships,  would be likely not to stick with a good dude (for me) because I wouldn't really know what I wanted, and would tie my self worth too closely to the approval of my partner. So the trp dudes are setting themselves up to date women who will piss them off even more,  all cause you just can't trust a slut to pair bond. What a fuckin joke. Edit typos"

TheBluePill,3deodf,Imperfect_Company,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:28:48 2015 UTC,"No, I think it is useful to establish the answer to the first question as well: Would any discussion of sexual strategy be sexist?  According to Google, ""Sexism or gender discrimination is prejudice or discrimination based on a person's sex or gender"", and prejudice is ""preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience"".   In any discussion of sexual strategy, as opposed to an exposition, you are going to get assertions that are wrong, because that is the nature of a discussion. Such statements, because they are wrong, are not based upon reason or actual experience, and since they pertain to sexual strategy, are probably specific to a gender, and could therefore, according to the above definitions, be considered sexist.  Therefore ANY discussion of sexual strategy is going to contain statements that are sexist. So of course TRP, since it is just a discussion of sexual strategy, is going to contain sexist statements."
TheBluePill,3deodf,Zachar1a,4,Thu Jul 16 18:08:42 2015 UTC,"Would any discussion of sexual strategy be sexist?   In the context of TRP, this is a misleading question.

TheBluePill,3de489,SlyStallonesForearms,2,Wed Jul 15 15:43:21 2015 UTC,Yes. Expected to be proactive in obtaining relationships. It would be strange to someone who is used to simply choosing from potential suitors.
TheBluePill,3de489,SlyStallonesForearms,2,Thu Jul 16 17:43:15 2015 UTC,"Does it make you sad that among young, healthy, socially functional individuals, neither gender generally needs to be ""proactive in obtaining relationships""? If a genuine mutual attraction exists between two people, then it doesn't actually matter who says, ""Hey, do you wanna...""/""So how about we..."" because by that point you both already know it's on because of your mutual attraction and social skills. The idea that women ""simply choose from potential suitors"" is ludicrous. If you're the kind of guy that never spontaneously forms a connection with women or who women never hit on, then that's on you bro.

Not applicatable to every individual but more prone in one side of the population. This leads to 'creeps' and 'losers' in men and 'sluts' in women. The inability to acquisition sex in one gender and the inability to be selective in another.   I personally don't judge a woman for being a 'slut' more than I do a man being a loser but appreciate that these are the attributes that for the most part genders subscribe to. Why do men and women view virginity so differently. Why are women very quick to use virgin as an insult to men whereby a man wouldnt to a woman? Why would a man probably be less insulted by being called a slut than a woman. Sexual strategy. They differ. My only point. Calling guys creeps or virgins is the equivalent to calling gals sluts...until we all merge into a homogeneous unigender.  Anyway your personal attacks and ""them"" mentality (I wouldn't consider myself akin to a lot of RPs, but appreciate some of their principles to be true) makes me realise you are not worth debating.

It is literally going up to people who are going about their business (shopping, etc.)   The suggestion that it's impossible to approach without it being harassment seems a bit ridiculous. What about in a museum or library? What about an amusement park?  It's possible to be friendly and not-pushy and start a conversation with people in public. I've gotten girls numbers on transit 3/5 times I've asked after chit-chat.   Typically I'll open with ""Mind if I ask how your day's going?"" And if I get no response I'll answer ""Nevermind, have a good one"" and go back to my cell or my book or whatever.   Man, talked to a cute Russian girl on the bus the other day. Forgot to ask her number before I got to my stop, then I just left, hoping she was switching buses too. It was very sad, she was really cute and very friendly.   I'll also start talking with guys on transit when I'm bored, hell I do that more often cause they're less defensive, I'm more likely to get a conversation.

TheBluePill,3de489,SlyStallonesForearms,-14,Thu Jul 16 04:02:34 2015 UTC,"Broad use of the word harassment I think. The point is..creeps are around, they exist. But they are a byproduct of women (for the most part) expecting to be approached for romantic liasons as opposed to approach and be upfront themselves.  Even if this guy is a creep, he is the inevitable byproduct of this reality. RP would argue that women and men are not equal, they differ on how they obtain sex and relationships.

I've actually taken to using very, very precise terminology whenever discussing social welfare programs.  It tends to make idiots shut up.  WELFARE is the only term the nutters use when the programs are SNAP, TANF, WIC, UI, and so on and each of them have specific requirements that weed out a lot of the things they claim that are happening."
TheBluePill,3dc9i5,ForgedIronMadeIt,17,Wed Jul 15 04:24:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a lot of people don't realize the amount of requirements people have to meet (and prove on paper) to get these government benefits.  They don't just sit around eating bonbons and collecting their welfare check. A lot of people on government assistance are working multiple jobs, there are some pretty stringent requirements that have to be met, there are usually time limits on benefits, and even ""welfare checks"" are usually not even enough to pay rent.

Absurdly enough, some people (men) have this idea that other people (women) sit around popping out babies in order to cash in on welfare programs for the benefit of children.  This is patently untrue.  Most of these single mothers are working one or more full-time jobs, and the reason programs like WIC are needed is because (a) we don't have pervasive birth control programs for teens and the poor, and (b) it's next to impossible to support oneself, let alone oneself and a kid, on one full-time minimum wage job."

Pretty much single mothers are viewed as women who make bad choices. And that's a problem with all races and classes. Society perceives them a certain way (individuals may not, but that's different) and it puts them at a disadvantage. Then when these women have to make things work in a system that is failing them, they get in trouble. When we have a minimum wage that isn't livable (and a huge pay gap for minority women), childcare that can cost hundreds of dollars a month, an education system that is failing to teach, etc. there are many women who do what they have to to make money so they can care for their kids. These women are viewed as ""bad mothers"" and are often punished for trying to maintain a job and care for their kids. Then people claim things like ""Single mothers raise criminals/sluts"" and the whole concept of the ""welfare queen""."

She had a quota she had to meet to remain eligible and her TANF ended in six months or when she became employed. If she couldn't find a job on her own in a certain time frame, they would make her come into 8 hour daily classes(which she did)."
TheBluePill,3dc9i5,assistantpimppancho,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:17:55 2015 UTC,"I hope your sister is doing better and has a more stable life now!  TANF, which I would say is what most people think of when they think ""welfare"", has some of the strictest requirements. You can only receive it a total of 60 months out of your lifetime, with some extensions for hardship (like domestic violence or ""extreme cruelty"").  Most people cycle in and out of poverty due to life circumstances, instead of remaining under the line for years. But, the definition of poverty in the US is really low, especially when compared to the ""average"" standard of living. A lot of people need TANF for things like medical bills for an unexpected illness or injury, repairs for their car (which is often their only form of transportation since public transportation in the US sucks and rural and even suburban poverty is extremely common), temporary unemployment, or other big one-time expenses. But if they qualify, and if they do all of the required paperwork and proof, they really don't receive all that much. There is a state minimum of $10, so some people may only receive $50 a month. That will pay for groceries if they are lucky enough to live near an inexpensive grocer. And if you are trying to pay off a medical bill from when someone got hit by a drunk driver, or when someone got diagnosed with cancer, it is going to take a long time for a small amount of money to build up enough to help. And all that time counts on the ""clock"".  /rant. I spend a lot of time studying this and going out to volunteer with the at need people in my state through periodic free health clinics, volunteer tutoring in public schools, and getting resources to homeless men, women, and children. Many of these people really need help, and it angers me to no end that so many people who could help them think, ""Oh, they must be lazy and are just living on state money."" Ugh."

However, if you search around on the Internet for shelters in your area, or look at museum and other community center websites you will find something. There are also Big Brother/Sister programs, and really just contacting low income schools in your area and asking if they have any volunteer programs.  I'm really glad your sister is doing much better! That's a hard thing to go through, something most people in the US will never have to deal with, so it is really admirable that she is doing well.  There is a lot tied into why the anti-welfare narrative still sticks, like how many middle class Americans don't think that people under the poverty line should have things like a refrigerator or a cell phone. I guess they think poor people should just eat all their food out of cans and not have access to any sort of technology that makes life easier."

The program is barely sufficient to cover your basic nutritional needs without additional money.  (Most recipients of this work, but fall below the poverty line or are otherwise unable to provide enough money for food.)    Temporary Assistance for Needy Families -- welfare in the traditional sense.  Cash payments to those with demonstrated need.  The program is extremely strict on who can apply to the point of absurdity in many cases.  If you do not have children, you cannot get in.  If you cannot get to a doctor to get your medical condition evaluated and reported, good luck with that.  I don't know the actual payments off the top of my head, but I doubt that it is generous.  WIC -- Women, Infants, and Children.  A program for pregnant women, people with infants or small children.  Pregnant women are targeted to prevent malnutrition during pregnancy (lets just say that a woman needs specific things during pregnancy to prevent some horrible situations).  People with infants who qualify can get formula or other baby food.  (Maybe diapers?  I don't remember.)  UI -- Unemployment Insurance.  On your paychecks, one of the payroll taxes is unemployment insurance.  If you lose your job, you may apply for UI on the basis that you earned those benefits.  In bad economic times, you might run a deficit in this program, I guess.  I don't remember how much of a percentage you get out of your previous salary, but that is how they calculate it.  I have never used any of those programs and frankly cannot see how I would ever use them.  I've been employed my entire adult life and the field I am in is very demanding.  Even if I never make use of them, I am extremely happy to pay into them and wish they went further.  It means that there will be fewer sick, malnourished women giving birth to sick infants.  Fewer men, women, and children will go hungry.  The United States is a place of great prosperity but goddamn it is it cruel to the less fortunate.  Yeah, sure, there is abuse and some of the people in those situations might be there as a result of their own choices, but they're still human goddamn beings."

So when a woman expresses her sexuality, they find the fact that they can't control it to be frightening, and fear often leads to fury. This often goes hand in hand with the old Madonna-whore complex. Sex is dirty, females are pure. If a female has sex, she is now tainted.

Is someone who is perpetually single and sleeps with people once a year or every 6 months in serial monogamous relationships promiscuous?  No.  But their count will be pretty high by the time they are 40.  A lot of people have some  years when they sleep around a lot, and some when they don't.

Also, a silly attempt at explaining their unhappiness in terms of broad social norms. If all women were chaste, they'd have a problem with that too and would spin out some narrative about the ice cold women who can't pair bond because they're too sexually on guard.

Therefore all women are good only as sluts, not as LTRs/wives. And that is the fault of feminism - not TRP. No, no, twerps would prefer women to go back to the time when virginity was the most highest valued thing a woman could offer, but since we're not going to do that any time soon they'll just have sex with all the ""sluts"" and lament the good old days of yore.   It's all bullshit. What gets really fun is playing with the idea that women having casual sex is going to be the downfall of society. If they truly believe that, then twerpers having casual, carefree sex with women is contributing to the end. However, I haven't seen them saying that sorta thing in a while.   TL;DR: They want the virgins, but they settle for the ""sluts"" and cry about how horrible those sluts are."
TheBluePill,3d9f2b,Shady_Intent,20,Tue Jul 14 20:03:56 2015 UTC,"I think it might also be an aspect that they want to control their surroundings, or their 'world', and especially women (who are eventually a part of his 'world', just by being there, goes for everyone). They link women to ego, reward, value as a man, not being a virgin loser etc, and when women have sex with other men besides themselves or even desire to, they have to face the fact that they can't control people or 'reality'. The desire to have influence, control over your surroundings is normal, because when you feel like you're losing grip, almost anyone'll feel bad about that and will want to regain 'control', either by actually doing so or by creating a false sense of control for instance by compulsive behaviour. This is normal. But when there's great insecurity, anxiety or lack of sense of identity/personality, the desire to 'control' things will be a lot stronger. Given all the implications that come to the subject 'women' (at least, to them), women basically going their own way undermines that control.   There's no magic spell to make a person love you obsessively forever, there's no magic spell that'll make a person only want you for sex, there's no magic spell that shuts off another person's identity/mind or independent thinking. I think this might scare some people, not just Terps. The basis lies in insecurity and lack of a sense of being comfortable with oneself.  But that's just what I suspect."

In fact, entire religions and governments and laws were erected to achieve this end. Its interesting to think 5000 yrs of this misogyny boils down to the sexual and emotional insecurity of a few powerful men.  The difference is now that women are not economically disenfranchised anymore (although not for altruistic reasons, just fortunate history). Those  legal institutions are mostly gone but the toothless religious ones remain, as does sexual insecurity of far too many men, ergo TWRP"

Because my sister is maybe a 6, and has 15 partners at the age of 19, how the fuck am I going to eventually 'settle down' with an 8+ with a very low count/traditional values.

Meanwhile they went out to bars and porked everything that moved, some of them with serious girlfriends at home. He told them they were nuts, and asked them if they really wanted a woman with almost no sexual experience? He just basically got blank stares and grunts. IDK if they were redpillers or just idiots, but it seems to be a common theme even outside of RP land.   Theory #2 on this - if RP'ers want to ""spin plates"" like these guys do with a wife or GF at home, it would help their cause if she was naive both relationship-wise and sexually, since she's less likely to clue into what is going on. That way they could cheat with impunity and still have the wifey at home."
