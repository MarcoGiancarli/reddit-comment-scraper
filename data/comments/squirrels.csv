squirrels,3duf2x,Grim_Squirrel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:04:44 2015 UTC,"Loved the part about them having to use plastic nuts so the squirrels wouldn't eat them. But there was one squirrel that would bite them, so they had to use some dental thing to make the nut from. And there was some squirrel that was biting that also. So they had to make the nuts out of some metal. But then there was also this one other squirrel that would bite the metal nuts."

squirrels,3dw4bh,jakepeter11,2,Mon Jul 20 00:52:16 2015 UTC,"That's a boy, and usually the greys that are missing tail fur are boys. Eastern Greys get along quite well except during the breeding season, and then the boys fight and bite and pull each others hair out to try and get the favour of the females.  He's pretty calm. I think he was hoping you brought snacks :)"
squirrels,3dw4bh,mtlchk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:03:51 2015 UTC,Thank you for the info :D Unfortunately I had nothing for him as I just left work on my walk home and didn't plan to meet him.
squirrels,3dsuvh,mtlchk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:14:28 2015 UTC,"I'll need photos to age him/her and tell you what type of squirrel this is, for a start.  You should keep with the oral rehydration solution until you see good, clear pees. Young babies must be stimulated to urinate and excrete, and they will not go on their own. It's very important that you learn how to do this and that you do it at every single feeding as leaving them with a too full bladder and bowels puts them at risk for bladder infection, which can even kill them if the infection gets in the kidneys, or painful abdomenal bloating which hurts and could result in digestive problems which would also do them harm. Here is how you stimulate them to excrete and urinate http://www.squirrelrehabilitation.com/stimulation.htm  I'll leave you with that, for now. The ORS needs to be about body temp, and be very careful with that hot water bottle. You have let the baby get dehydrated to within a few inches of death, and now the next terrible thing that could happen would be that you dry him/her out further with too much heat.  The heat source needs to be gentle, like an electric blanket on the lowest setting with towels on top and then the sleeping box placed half on and half off of the blanket. This way the baby can escape the heat if there is risk of hyperthermia, which will also kill.  So give oral rehydration solution as close to once an hour as you can over the night, and as much as s/he will take. Do not force feed, as this will also kill them by causing something called aspiration pneumonia. Let the baby drink, and do not squeeze the liquid in. Neither let the baby suck down too much liquid too fast. They have powerfully strong diaphragms, and they can easily suck in enough liquid to almost drown themselves before they are able to stop the stream.  I think you are getting the idea by now that most inexperienced people kill the orphaned baby squirrels that they mean to help. It's so great that you are kind enough to help and it's even better that you ask for help from someone that has a better clue than you do. But... baby squirrels are better off with people who have experience with them. There is so much to learn that it's really ridiculous, and most people are just not up for that, even if they do have the time.  So please let me know where you are, and I will point you to local wildlife rehabilitation services. Also, the baby likely had/has orphaned sib(s) who need(ed) help, too. Did you check the area well for other babies? Can you do it now, if you didn't already?  Sorry to overload you with potentially scary info, here. You're a good person, but I am just being honest. You nearly let him/her die of neglect already. Caring for baby squirrels is ridiculously time and labour intensive, and you need to read and read and read. Do you think that's something you are up for? So far it looks like not, to be blunt. And I am sorry that that sounds rough.   Squirrels, and especially N American Reds are not good pets. Rarely, they can be happy companions, but never ""pets"". Reds are scrappy and territorial as hell, btw. It's rare that tree squirrels can even be happy companions. They're wild, they need to be treated as equals, they have fantastic memories and hold grudges when you don't treat them with respect and as equals, and their basic, wild needs are in conflict with our lifestyles, making conflict inevitable. They have not been bred for 1000s of years to live with us like dogs and cats have. You need to make a complete paradigmatic shift to live well and happily with a wild animal (and vice versa), and even then, they only bond to one person, usually biting everyone else. Oh, and they can bite very, very hard. And they do. How does all that mesh with your lifestyle, if you look at it honestly? It's not a commitment that most people should try taking on, and it will usually lead to tragedy for one or both parties.  Well, I am crossing fingers and toes that your little friend lives through the night. Thank you for helping, and I will check up on this thread first thing for your pics and location. :)"
squirrels,3dsuvh,mtlchk,3,Sun Jul 19 06:10:02 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, he didn't.   I do know what you mean. I work in a boatyard, so we looked around as best we could, but I'm still surprised that he found his way into our office.  We did our best, with our limited knowledge. I also live on an island with a ferry service, so getting any supplies was going to be dicey.  Let me put it this way...it's 8am, and the first boat of the day hasn't left yet.  I do know they are territorial, as we have a squirrel who visits our bird feeder and woe to the other ones who attempt to come close. His displays are...impressive to say the least.  I'm sad that the little guy didn't make it. We did what we could with our limited knowledge. I didn't see your message until now, and should have gotten up more during the night to feed him.   At least he was warm and safe for part of his short little life.  Thanks for all your help."
squirrels,3dkpwq,Cassius999,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:34:44 2015 UTC,"North American Red squirrels have been documented to adopt closely related orphans, and I personally suspect that other tree squirrels do this, too. Why? Well, because of how orphans often seem to be trying to get adopted.   Of course they are doomed if they don't get help, so that simple fact can make them take the chance, however remote it could be. But why not take the remote chance of waiting, instead, even though it is unlikely that mom might come back after a certain point in time? Why not do that... unless there is a better chance of getting help outside the den?  No, at least a lot of them get out into a hostile and dangerous world to ask for help. I think it's genetically programmed behaviour because the behaviour of their species is such that it stands a better chance of paying off than waiting does - ie that they might get lucky and that their aunt or grandmother might take them in. Surely they didn't evolve this behaviour as an adaptation to a few rare, kind humans, after all. Pretty much anything else would ignore or eat them, too, so scratch that."

squirrels,3b9ags,fadingsignal,3,Sat Jun 27 00:52:23 2015 UTC,"One of the first rules of wildlife rehab is that if we can't catch it, it'll probably be fine. As someone else said, squirrels can survive some pretty crazy falls, I wouldn't worry."
squirrels,3b9ags,CritterTeacher,2,Sat Jun 27 06:37:22 2015 UTC,"For sure there is a chance s/he is fine. The smaller a being is, the less a fall can hurt them. I once watched a BBC science program where it was said that you could drop a little being the size of a mouse off of the Burj Dubai and it would probably be fine. Wow.  It depends on what s/he fell on and with what body part, but there is a good chance that there was no serious injury at all. If something was broken, s/he would not have been able to run away like that. And if there was serious head trauma such that it would cause a neuro injury, s/he would likely have been unconscious or at least very dizzy and woozy, ergo easy to catch. So yes, there is a good chance that the squirrel is just fine :)  Edit: thanks for caring, btw :)"

squirrels,39ky8t,reddoggie,2,Fri Jun 12 13:27:06 2015 UTC,"I saw the original of this ages ago. Apparently the squirrel was fostered as an orphan and became friends with the cat. That's not something I would advise as it usually ends very tragically, but by a huge and flukey stroke of luck for the squirrel, it didn't, in this case.  The story attached to it is that the squirrel still hangs around the house where he was raised and though released, still visits the cat. Oh well, they are smart enough to tell the difference between different cats and dogs. Their eyesight is much more acute than ours is, too, enabling them to see the difference between two orange cats. Hopefully this one will be ok out in the world of less friendly cats :)"

squirrels,38ydf6,weirdonerdfreak,18,Sun Jun 7 22:05:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the post :)  First of all, that's a mama. The spring babies that were born in February and March are now young juvies that are spending time outside on their own, but they still come home to nurse at night. This is when the mama's nipples are biggest because they only make as much milk as they need. Older juvies have big stomachs, so the mamas make a lot of milk, and this makes them look fat and their undersides look patchy. They are not fat or bloated, all of that is milk that her body was making all day while she foraged.  Second, the eeeiah noise is the ""all clear, I hope!"" noise. It's the third stage of their alarm call which they do to notify other squirrels in the area of a potential danger. The eeeiah says, I just saw something dangerous, but now I don't see it. It might still be in the area, so look out, but I think it is gone. It is a question to other squirrels, too, because she is asking if they can see the threat that has moved beyond her view. She says ""I just saw something bad, but now I can't see it. Is it safe to come down?"" and then the other squirrels in the area will take a careful look and respond with a first stage alarm call if the threat has only moved near by where it is now visible to them. Squirrels look out for each other in this way by protecting each other from predators or other dangers.  Finally, the pancaking. This is what I mean by pancaking https://www.flickr.com/groups/squirrelpancakes/pool/page2 Squirrels flop out like pancakes when they are tired, too hot or when they just feel like resting. She felt safe on her branch, and so she flopped out while she waited to hear the news about the rotten cat or dog, basically.   It's doesn't sound like anything to be concerned about, but thanks so much for caring :)"
squirrels,38ydf6,mtlchk,6,Sun Jun 7 23:58:52 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the answer! I'm glad to know there was nothing to worry about :)
squirrels,38yv4m,Nostradamus1,6,Mon Jun 8 00:28:05 2015 UTC,"Yes :)   If they get upset by anything such that they feel unsafe, they will move their babies, but they will also move them when the babies are getting ready to go out on their own to practice their jumping and climbing skills.   Mama may pick a tight spot that feels very covered and safe for little babies, but then she will move them after their tails start to fluff up to a place where they will have food to forage in their first, short and tentative sorties out into the world. She'll pick a place where she can watch them closely and where they can encounter a reliable food source that she knows, such as a maple tree that is dropping its seeds in late spring and early summer.  It just depends on how many options she has. In a small park surrounded by busy streets, probably not. But in a neighbourhood with a lot of trees, and not much traffic, yes."

Unfortunately, I think they are feeding cows milk, judging from the consistency. The squirrel looks so weak, too, which would be due to his not being able to get enough nutrients from cows milk. No animal can digest cows milk well, except for cows and some humans who evolved the ability over a few thousand years.  I left them some info on their video.

At my university's campus they were very bold, but they never climbed on  me!  Oh also if you get nuts still in the shell it's fun to watch them break through."

squirrels,36ly1d,mtlchk,1 point,Wed May 20 15:45:22 2015 UTC,My jeans are tapered and quite thick so i didn't feel the claws.
squirrels,36ly1d,cmotdibbler,1 point,Thu May 21 05:57:30 2015 UTC,"The squirrels that I raised learned how to climb my bare skin without scratching me. They are quite smart, and they do feel bad when they hurt you by accident.  Anyway, you don't get scratched when they climb on clothes. Bare skin, sometimes, but they quickly learn how to be gentle with the softy humans. I even have a wild friend who climbs on my arms with no scratching :)"
squirrels,36ly1d,mtlchk,2,Thu May 21 06:05:50 2015 UTC,"That is really cool. I've always enjoyed squirrel antics and acrobatics but my wife absolutely hates them for digging up the garden. The squirrels seem to be able to distinguish between us (who is more likely to put out seeds or nuts vs make stomping noise). At my university (UMich) they were too fat to climb up your body, they would just waddle in front of you and demand food. They've been noted for more than 100 years"

squirrels,36ly1d,mtlchk,1 point,Thu May 21 14:21:32 2015 UTC,This really makes me want to keep squirrel food on hand at all times. What kind of nuts do you recommend?
squirrels,36ly1d,Tesabella,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:29:57 2015 UTC,"Unsalted, roasted almonds are a nice choice for a treat. They are probably the most nutritious tree nut. But walnuts, hazelnuts, etc are all very nutritious and memorable foods for them. They're nutrient rich, and quite a treat since wild foods and discarded junk foods are nowhere near as delicious to them as a nut is :)  In truth they are basically omnivores. They will eat anything we eat and then some, but they do stick mostly to a vegetarian diet.  Still, if you want a squirrel to love and remember you, bring nuts :) Peanuts are fine in small doses, but tree nuts are better for them."
squirrels,36ly1d,mtlchk,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:35:23 2015 UTC,"In the shell or out of the shell?  I've had a few of the campus squirrels damn near walk right up onto my feet, but I had nothing to feed them nor any idea what to feed the."

squirrels,36betn,mtlchk,3,Mon May 18 11:23:32 2015 UTC,I just want to squish him against my face. This might sound a little weird--if you haven't smelled a squirrel before they smell really good. My grey squirrel did anyway.

squirrels,36betn,snugglebuttt,3,Mon May 18 19:51:35 2015 UTC,"A very mild smell that's fresh, natural, a little like pine or cedar maybe. Very clean smelling. It was the same even after she would stay outside for days at a time, so it wasn't just because she was a rescue."
squirrels,36betn,mtlchk,3,Mon May 18 14:00:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, they smell like the woods, but a bit sweet. Their musk is a wonderful smell, and very mild. I miss it, too."
squirrels,36betn,snugglebuttt,2,Mon May 18 14:03:35 2015 UTC,I always thought it was probably so they were hard to track for predators or so other squirrels couldn't follow their scent to find their buried nuts. Either way they smell good =)
squirrels,36betn,mtlchk,3,Mon May 18 19:52:43 2015 UTC,"They actually remember where they bury most of those 1000s of caches. Their spatial memory is much superior to ours.

squirrels,36betn,Waterrat,1 point,Mon May 18 19:54:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert. I have heard that spatial memory plays a large part. I have heard that smell plays a large part.  I have, however, seen multiple squirrels pretend to bury something. I know for a fact that these squirrels are attempting to trick onlookers or onsmellers (probably the former). I do believe this has been scientifically documented, but, if not, I'd be happy to testify.   I've seen my grey bury stuff in blankets, my clothing, a stray t-shirt, and cat litter, among other things. I know they can find them again. Sometimes I just feel like science doesn't really understand how."

She knows that I am safe and give treats, plus I chase the alley cats off with a squirt gun!   One of them is already getting curious and returning my friendly overtures. I think they will be good squirrel friends, growing up :)"
squirrels,36begn,WhenWhereWho,6,Mon May 18 00:32:09 2015 UTC,"This is a North American Red squirrel, and s/he would be just under 4 weeks of age since their eyes open at four weeks. They develop quickly compared to other tree squirrels.  Your first order is to rehydrate. You need to do this carefully since you have an eye dropper. The rehydration solution should be warm, but not hot on the skin, and you should drop just a little in the mouth, allowing the baby to swallow. But don't let him/her get suction on that eye dropper because they have powerful muscles. S/he will suck down so much liquid that you will add risk of pneumonia to the already existent troubles that this little one has. Nonetheless, rehydration is crucial for tiny beings as they dry out fast. Dehydration can easily kill them. Here is a simple, homemade recipe, but pedialyte is better. You can get pedialyte at the drug store, and so can you get oral syringes for giving medicine to babies. Oral syringes are more easy to control than eye droppers. Get the smallest size you can, though. Here is the homemade rehydration solution recipe: http://orphanedwildlifecare.com/squirrelcare.htm#8 In fact that whole page is great except for the fact that last I checked they recommended sunflower seeds as a staple food. Seeds are not a good staple for growing squirrels as they have a huge amount of phosphorous and this limits calcium availabilty. Other than that it's a very concise and useful reference page.  So you rehydrate for 24 hours, maximum, and hopefully by then you have a line on a caring and good rehabber. Here is a big list to help you to find one: http://www.mary.cc/How%20To%20Locate%20a%20Wildlife%20Rehabilitator.html Her page is also great if you want to browse around it for info.  Next, it is not as gross as you think, and if you care, you will do it. Baby squirrels need to be stimulated to urinate or excrete. You can do this with a warm, wet, soft wash cloth, with a moist q-tip or cotton ball or even with your finger, but gently. It should feel like mommy's tongue nuzzling up. That is the pressure you are aiming for when you do it. They cannot go on their own. This is to keep their den clean and clean smelling so as not to attract predators. If you don't do it, the baby will be in considerable discomfort and at greater risk for a UTI, which can even be deadly if not treated. Here is how to do it with some slightly unpleasant photos http://www.squirrelrehabilitation.com/stimulation.htm  You need to keep the baby warm, but not hot. A heating blanket on the lowest setting, half off of the box the baby is sleeping in so that s/he can move if it gets too hot is the simplest way to do it.  Also, there are probably more orphans if this baby is dehydrated. Here is how to check http://www.squirrelrehabilitation.com/dehydration.htm The pic doesn't look too bad, but pictures are a poor indication. So try to check the area for sibs, if possible.  Finally, I am told that reds are roamers, so keep a lid on that box. Hopefully that is all that happened to this little one, but do check for sibs just the same, if you are able, please.  If you have any questions, please either reply to this thread or PM me :)"
squirrels,36begn,mtlchk,3,Mon May 18 03:05:08 2015 UTC,"For Posterity:  Squirrel Baby  from WhenWhereWho sent an hour ago  Thank you so much for all your help! She seems so happy to get water. We also gave her some goats milk, as directed by another site. She's not eating as much as I thought she'd be. Would you still consider her round four weeks if she has her bottom teeth? The top ones are barely in yet. (This is the squirrel rescue you were so kind to give help with haha)  Cheers!  re: Squirrel Baby  to WhenWhereWho sent just now  Oops, here is the link http://www.squirrelrehabilitation.com/supplies.htm  re: Squirrel Baby  to WhenWhereWho sent a minute ago  Goats milk is really digestible, unlike cows milk, so that is ok, for the short term. For the long term she needs more fat and nutrients than she can get from goats milk.  Here are some more comprehensive feeding instructions along with some good formulas on the next page. Esbilac goats milk is said to be very good, but he doesn't mention Royal Canin for puppies. He's in Florida, so they may not have it. It is a european company that makes a superior product than other commercial formulas. Fox Valley is the best-cheapest option with few babies having problems on it, but you will need to mail order it.  For aging, what I read is that this baby is in her third week of life. I have no experience with reds, though.  As a rule, you move from rehydration to formula once you are getting good pees. Goats milk is watery compared to formula, though, and should not be too hard to digest. Watch for diarrhea as that's a potential killer and the reason why you rehydrate first (primes the digestive system)  She needs sibs, growing up. Reds are mostly solitary, so they get cranky, aggressive and ungrateful as they age. They don't have much of a behavioural basis to be happy with humans, even if they were raised by us. Other tree squirrels are much more social, so there is leeway when it comes to when to release, or even if to release if the animal is non-releasable. Not so with Reds, from what I am told by those who have raised them.  So she is going out in the world, period. Pretty much. She'll need to be around others of her own kind so she can learn to ""speak squirrel"". I encourage you to look for a wildlife rehabber that does reds and has some... or else find her sibs and send the whole family over.  Thanks for a Great Save :) You're a kind hearted person :)"

I guess the wildlife rehab people will know that, too, and nurse them until they are ready to wean."

squirrels,35pma2,Waterrat,1 point,Wed May 13 22:03:02 2015 UTC,"They had gotten out of the tree and fallen to the ground. I suspect mtlchk was correct that they were trying to explore for the first time...I'm betting the one I call 'Frisky' was the instigator to pull the rest along. My dad found them when they were in a fenced-in backyard, but he spoke with someone who had seen them earlier, before they'd gotten into that location; that person was sympathetic but didn't know what to do to help."
squirrels,35pma2,DocJennifer,1 point,Fri May 15 00:59:51 2015 UTC,"Here's some interesting info for you, if you release them back to your yard, mom will remember them. Eastern Greys depend on kin relationships, especially during the first year of life, but later on they strike out into new areas. Or rather, epecially the males do, but females tend to den very close to their moms and other close female relatives.  So... since you are a squirrel-kindred person, you might want to offer your property for a pre-release cage and then a release house. It's a joy to watch them find their feet in the world, and you will do them a great favour by putting them back in their kinship web :) I believe they are able to recognise each other by scent, because their sense of smell is amazing, and they definitely have unique relationships to each squirrel in their area.  I've even seen a mom hug and groom/kiss her year old son's head. She'd been blowing him off because she had new babies that needed all her attention, but once they were old enough to explore, she let her young adult son know that she was sorry and still loved him. They're much more socially complex than most people understand :)"

My guess is that you have grackle nests in the trees near the squirrels and the squirrels are eating their eggs or getting too close.   Honestly, leave them be. The grackles should be done nesting soon and they will move on. The squirrels aren't nearly as mobile and they will endure."

squirrels,35jbc6,uncle_boner,13,Sun May 10 22:51:00 2015 UTC,"Squirrel brains continue to grow throughout their lives. Shortly after reaching adulthood this causes issues because the brain starts to compress inside the skull. In an effort to relieve pressure to avoid hemorages, the dendrites of the neurons start to die off, resulting in less connective tissue. This also causes a sharp spike in dopamine to make up for the deficiency. Now anyone who knows their neural psychology knows this leads to schizophrenia. So these squirrels almost all end up schizophrenic, with bouts of paranoia, hallucinations, and random moods swings. But most importantly I'm making all this up and most likely they're just playing around."
squirrels,35jbc6,Twystoff,10,Mon May 11 00:25:55 2015 UTC,"they're just playing around.   This :)  Like all the clever animals, squirrels like to play throughout their lives. It does serve a neurological function, actually, as play increases ones learning capacity and keeps ones reactions sharp. Plus the simple joy of it is a boost to the immune system, helps them process out stress hormones and keeps them primed and attentive to learn more, even as they age. :)"

Gotta be wary when you're just a little guy.  It's also possible they're communicating with other squirrels. Squirrels (greys at least) are pretty social. They play with each other, so this could be an invitation to mess around."
squirrels,35jbc6,snugglebuttt,1 point,Mon May 11 09:37:07 2015 UTC,"Most likely just weird playfulness--they do a lot of that, but if I recall correctly erratic behavior can be indicative of rabies."
squirrels,35jbc6,scurius,2,Mon May 11 18:10:32 2015 UTC,"I wish people would stop being so dumb about rabies.   First of all, squirrels are not a rabies vector species, even according to the super cautious CDC. Check their website on that if you doubt me.  Second, yes, you can tell if an animal is rabid by how it behaves. It's transmitted by saliva or by eating the brain. If you see an animal frothing at the mouth, be wary, but you almost certainly never will, so don't worry about it.  Third, yes, it's damn uncommon. It's been wiped out over huge swathes of North America. Here in Canada we vaccinate some species by leaving oral vaccine in bait for them to eat. It's not a hard disease to manage, and that is why it is almost gone.  Squirrels don't get rabies. Also, don't worry about rabies.  Pardon my slightly harsh tone, but it is a pet peeve of mine :)"

Five years ago I rescued some orphaned baby squirrels from a horrible neighbour who wanted to kill them. I nursed and raised them, myself.  I learned a great deal about them and then about other squirrel species, too. I've got a really good memory, especially for things I care about, and I've done a lot of reading/talked to a lot of people about squirrels and how to help them when they need it."

I feed a lot of wild ones on my college campus and I've taken a ton of photos of them. They are such interesting creatures, their behavior sometimes is fun to watch. I've seen them lay on the concrete prone like this with their arms and legs spread out (someone told me they do it to cool down), sometimes they stand on their hind legs for a while, chase other squirrels. It's so much fun to watch them! I wish they would trust me and climb on my shoulders though :("

squirrels,350yeh,Deidara77,2,Wed May 6 23:12:51 2015 UTC,"Well..... Yes and no. They are omnivores, like us, and can really eat anything. But if we are talking about a diet staple, then yes, because cookies are very low in nutrition. If you are giving it to a wild as a treat because you have extra cookie and are a nice person, then that's fine and even helpful. Calories are hard to come by in the wild world, and it would help that squirrel pack on winter fat to keep them alive until spring if you gave it in Autumn. Otherwise it's just a tasty thing for them and won't hurt them as a treat.  Also, if we are talking about a growing baby juvie, then yes it's bad, because they really need extra good nutrition to develop strong bodies. Everything a growing squirrel eats should be a healthy thing.  If you want to help a wild juvie-baby that lost his/her mom, then boo balls are what you want. There are many variations on the theme, but all include formula for baby squirrels and a good rodent block. Here is one recipe http://squirrelrefuge.org/booballrecipe.html I'd sub a bit of the coconut oil with hemp seed oil so that the squirrel gets all the essential fatty acids needed for brain and neural growth.  Yea, that's a lot to drop on you. But anyway, that's the healthiest squirrel treat you can offer :) They're really tasty, too, and actually more yummy than cookies ;)"

squirrels,34xgcs,RuunaFish,3,Tue May 5 11:04:33 2015 UTC,"Woah, what a big family. It's not common for them to have so many.  Squirrels are very doting and devoted mothers, which is why they have smaller litters (usually two to four) and not until they are more than one year old.  Yes, they are normally still nursing at that age, and I knew a wild mom who would nurse her babies until they were at least 16 weeks old, and I think 18 weeks, once. That was an exceptional mom, that I knew, but they often go longer than the regularly prescribed 10 week nursing period, just more like 12 to 14 weeks, not as long as Porchy Mama did.   Those little guys are 8 to 9 weeks old. They're nursing twice a day and eating solids, too. But their molars are not fully in, so they cannot eat everything. And they are still growing fast, so need to calcium and protein in moms milk. She has so many that it is only practical to nurse them on the ground, hehe."

squirrels,34xgcs,reddoggie,3,Tue May 5 18:24:00 2015 UTC,"It looks to me like they are nursing. In the mammalian world, nursing usually stops when Mom's hormones change, causing her to not tolerate the behavior anymore. (She scolds them, they move on to other food sources.)   I would imagine in this case you are either: 1) Looking at the last day or two she's going to put up with the behavior 2) For some reason she hasn't undergone the hormonal change yet 3) Mom is unable to fend off the little creeps due to sickness/weakness, or 4) there's a food scarcity"

squirrels,34qmuz,uncle_boner,0,Sun May 3 23:09:47 2015 UTC,"I normally wouldn't direct people to thesquirrelboard.com because there is way too much drama and controversy on there, but they do have a section where people can post about reputable breeders.  Flying squirrels are highly social, so you need a pair, at minimum. They are possibly the only squirrel species that can normally be a happy companion to the RIGHT kind of person.  They're wild animals, they're nocturnal, they're extremely intelligent, they have very special diet needs, and they need a lot of play, exercise and love, else they can become depressed and self mutilate.   As I said, very social, and also wild natured.   So there is a place where you can post and talk to other people who keep them as companions. You should think about it carefully, though, as it's a decision that could make you miserable, cost you a heap of money and break a beautiful animals heart if you make the wrong one. You need to be a very patient, accepting, easy going, compassionate, observant and tolerant person who has a natural knack for understanding wild animals to be happy with such a companion and vice versa, for that companion to be happy with you.   It's definitely not for everyone, but because SFS are so social, they can adapt to living with a person and be happy with it - provided they have lots of space, lots of out-of-cage play time, and other SFS friends."

In most states it's perfectly legal to kill and or trap squirrels, especially if they are considered pests which is most likely the case with your condo complex. For instance here in FL this is the Wildlife Commissions stance on the matter.  ""A landowner may lawfully live-trap or humanely destroy nuisance gray squirrels without a special permit or license. Live-captured nuisance squirrels must be released or euthanized within 24 hours of capture or trap inspection. In addition, nuisance squirrels may be transported and released at an off-site location that is within the county of capture and a minimum of 40 contiguous acres if the animal is a native species; the releaser has written permission from the owner of the release site; and the transportation of the wildlife does not violate any rabies alert or area quarantine issued by a county health department or county animal service. Relocating wildlife is seldom biologically sound, the animal often does not survive.  You can receive technical assistance for squirrel problems by contacting your nearest FWC regional office."""

I assume you're talking about (eastern?) grey squirrels (sciurus carolinensis). If you really want to denounce your neighbor you could call the game warden, but remember that you'll still have to live next to your neighbor afterwards. There could be some sort of legal provision for eliminating ""pests"" or something, especially if it's someone's primary residence... There's a chance your neighbor is within his rights.  Do you know what your neighbor is doing with the squirrels? Have you tried talking to him? If he just wants to get rid of the squirrels you could offer to take them somewhere else."

squirrels,33b064,TheJigen,2,Tue Apr 21 02:28:35 2015 UTC,"Well, idk. It's possible he had a thyroid problem that made him sluggish and put on weight, just like a human could.   Flying squirrels need to be pretty sleek to glide, so I wouldn't think that's normal. I've seen eastern greys get chubby in autumn as they pack away fat stores to survive the winter, but I have never observed flying squirrels in the wild.   Probably they try and get fat, too. None of the tree squirrels hibernate, and flying squirrels can climb as well as glide. Since they cannot slow their metabolism for winter they must try to fatten up to live through it like other squirrels do."

squirrels,31owbd,Jatz55,5,Tue Apr 7 00:16:31 2015 UTC,"Yea, that is a baby juvie. In fact, squirrels have terrible depth perception because their eyes are placed on the side of their heads. This allows for maximum field of vision and lets them avoid predators, but it puts them at a serious disadvantage in the trees.  Baby squirrels have to learn to compensate for this, and this is why he is bobbing his head. He is moving the tiny area of depth perception around trying to figure out if that is a line or a ledge that he could jump onto. He makes the wrong guess. In the wild, 80% of them die in their first year of life, and it's likely down to making the wrong guess about whether a jump is safe or possible when a predator is also in pursuit.  They have prodigious memories and actually make most familiar jumps by memory. They have a huge capacity for triangulation, location recall and 3 dimensional spatial maps in their brains that puts humans to shame.   They're pretty impressive animals, and this is one reason why: This is what the hardware that they are born with allows them to do, straight out of the box. And now look up and see what they can make it do, with good luck and practise, waaaaay up in the canopy.  Squirrels are pretty amazing :)"

That's a mutation that blends with normally coloured individuals. First generation leucistic squirrels have blue eyes, and their babies are light furred with dark eyes, unless they breed with another squirrel that has the same, recessive gene for blue eyes (unlikely in squirrels).  So this guy is probably the offspring of a white-blonde, blue eyed parent and a lightly coloured, but normally melanistic squirrel with brown eyes, not an albino squirrel."

If you're worried about that, try doing another night feeding, I guess, but they are probably getting enough, provided you did your good research on that."
squirrels,30xmjw,mtlchk,2,Tue Mar 31 17:43:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I spent all night/part of this morning researching since its been a while since I raised a squirrel. I believe she's 5 weeks, but she was nearly skin and bones. I think she had been on the ground for quite some time. I finally got her to drink some pedialyte and check on her roughly every 4 hours. She's still sleepy, but has perked up and is showing more and more interest in food."
squirrels,30rnyh,SirMarks-A-Lot,3,Mon Mar 30 03:08:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, he needs to come down. Do you have photos of the others so that I can tell you their age?  They must all be orphaned siblings, and they cannot survive on their own. You need to get him. He's most likely to die within a few days of dehydration, and things like berries or grapes cut in half could attract him out of his hiding place.  Once he's out, he needs to be caught and brought to his siblings to be cared for and released together. A fishing net makes a good trap. You can put food in the net and then lift it all up once he is in the middle. Or a towel over top of him, or just grab the little dude. You don't have to worry about touching them. Just wash your hands afterwards in case they have worms, is all.  The only concern about capturing him is that you get it right the first time as they don't usually give second chances.  OR, if you have a gentle and steady hand and are good with animals, you can coax him to you and grab him in a somewhat less frightening way that way. Lip smacking (bruxing), self grooming like a squirrel does and deliberate blinking all convey friendly intentions in squirrel language, and these gestures will help put a nervous squirrel at ease."

I'd estimate his length from tip of nose to end of tail was about 8 inches if that helps you determine age. The others are about the same size. Poor little guy :( Imgur  This one is a pic of where the nest is Imgur. It is up in the large hollow of the sawed off branch. Earl is still living here. There is the corn holder that he can easily get to and you may be able to see that I've smeared a couple spoonfulls of peanut butter on the tree that he seems to enjoy but only when I'm not near by. I've also left a small bowl of water on the ground directly below. I'm pretty sure if climb up to the nest he will just flee. Unfortunately I'm at work now but when I get home I'll check on him and see if i can coax him down.   Thanks for your help!
squirrels,30rnyh,mtlchk,3,Mon Mar 30 14:55:32 2015 UTC,"He's around 6 weeks old. Fox Squirrels need to nurse until at least 12-14 weeks old, and from my observations, squirrels may nurse weeks longer than that in the wild. There is really no chance that he will make it alone at this age.  An easier option to catch him is using a humane trap like the have-a-hart traps. I understand that these are pretty widely available at hardware stores in the US. If you have to be away a lot, that would be more practical. Is there someone around to monitor the trap every hour and take him in when caught?"
squirrels,30rnyh,mtlchk,3,Mon Mar 30 16:12:32 2015 UTC,"How is it all coming along? I'm thinking of your little, lost boy, too :)"
squirrels,30rnyh,mtlchk,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:47:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the delay, I don't actually log on to my account too often.   So I contacted the rescue that came out for Earl's siblings to see if they had any humane traps I could borrow to catch him and take him to them. They said if he seems ok they would prefer to not take him out of his home and to keep doing what I've been doing (putting out water, corn and smearing peanut butter on the tree). He seems a little less skittish of me but still won't come right up to me which I guess is a good thing. I don't want him to loose his natural instincts :)  I was out of town over the holiday weekend so I was a bit worried about him but when I got back he is still living in his nest and doing well. I will try to get a good picture of him in his tree and post up.  Thanks for checking in!  Edit: random oopsies"

You can also look for other shelters in the area. Its fine to ask if its a ""no kill"" shelter, in my area they are, thankfully. Squirrels are adorable but they are still wild animals, and may have diseases.  Good luck!"
squirrels,2y0hw1,SpaceDantar,1 point,Thu Mar 5 14:37:51 2015 UTC,"In fact they don't carry any zoonotic illnesses. They're very clean and safe to handle, even and especially when compared to domestic cats, which may carry illnesses that infect us."
squirrels,2y0hw1,mtlchk,1 point,Thu Mar 5 18:10:12 2015 UTC,Unfortunately they're not 100% safe. See : http://squirrelrefuge.org/page52.html and http://www.cdc.gov/rodents/diseases/
squirrels,2y0hw1,SpaceDantar,1 point,Thu Mar 5 18:38:40 2015 UTC,"Well, nothing is 100% safe, but squirrels are very safe to handle.  When it comes to disease we need to worry about other humans and domestic animals. The more genetically similar an animal is, the more likely it is that viruses may pass between our species. And animals that live parallel lives with us like domestic animals, their parasites and house dwelling rodents like mice or rats are also more likely to carry them as either species can be a reservoir for the infection, transmitting it to the other because of proximity of habitat.  In general, you don't need to worry much about getting sick from wild animals, and squirrels are especially clean compared to most."
squirrels,2y0hw1,mtlchk,2,Thu Mar 5 19:22:16 2015 UTC,Sometimes baby squirrels fall out of their nest while the mom is out gathering food and she comes back for them. If he didn't pick it up and it still appears to be abandoned I would contact a local veterinarian that specializes in exotic type animals.
squirrels,2y0hw1,Hitbysquirrel,2,Thu Mar 5 16:36:07 2015 UTC,"Not a good idea. It's not a pet and it won't be a pet. Best to take it to a wildlife shelter. When it's grown, they can release it in your yard.  Also,if you don't know how to care for baby squirrels, you can kill them very quickly."
squirrels,2y0hw1,Waterrat,1 point,Thu Mar 5 22:15:08 2015 UTC,"Here is a page with good advice as to what to do with an orphaned or lost baby. http://www.squirrelrehabilitation.com/found%20baby.htm  Sometimes they fall out of the drey, and in that case the mom will take the baby back, regardless of whether you touch it or not. Wild animals don't reject infants that we touch. That's a myth. There is advice about how to reunite on the page above. Mom will take the baby back even many days later.  Reuniting a fallen baby squirrel with mom is the best thing to do, provided there are no serious injuries. Squirrel moms are extremely devoted to their young. For example, I recently met an adult with a broken jaw that had healed without being perfectly set. That squirrel must have fallen from the nest as a baby and been nursed back to health by mom. There is no other way she could have survived that injury. That's pretty amazing as it would have required very tender and patient care from mom.  Finally, where are you? If this is an orphan the best thing to do is take it to an experienced wildlife rehabilitator. At the least he should have good advice on how to care for them.   They need to be released at around 6 months of age, and a solo raised squirrel won't do well since s/he won't have grown up learning how to communicate and socialise with other squirrels."

squirrels,2vlnp4,Venomousx,0,Thu Feb 12 06:14:55 2015 UTC,"It's a treat. I give her one a week. You really think she got her chub with crackers? She eats fresh fruit and veggies, mushrooms and mixed nuts otherwise. Occasionally she'll eat my fingernail when she thinks they're too long.  Plus.... Your healthy diet list advocates several things not found in nature. Other than an occasional kashi cracker, she gets foods she's going to have access to here in my woods behind our house. The only reason I still have her is because she didn't have a good coat or fat layer for winter here. She was a rehab from an August litter. She'll be released by the end of March when the new babies need rehabbed. And when they're older, I might give them a cracker once a week, too. Thanks for your concern. Jeez. I thought it was a cute pic."
squirrels,2vlnp4,Venomousx,0,Thu Feb 12 12:57:51 2015 UTC,Your healthy diet list advocates several things not found in nature.   That's because it's a diet specifically for squirrels that do not live in the wild. Which given the picture it's easy to assume that she's your pet.  Anyway you can choose to get defensive when people show concern over an animal's diet or you can choose to see it as us just wanting to make sure squirrels are as happy and healthy as possible. Your choice.
squirrels,2vlnp4,Venomousx,3,Thu Feb 12 13:14:44 2015 UTC,"For now, yes she's a pet. Only because I'm a rehabber that is giving her a better chance at survival since she was a late summer baby. The winters here are brutal. She goes outside and has tree time and other interactions with regularity. Am I being defensive? I don't think so. Wasn't asking for advice on how to feed her but you felt it necessary to  give advice. Just putting up a freaking cute pic of her. Btw.... I took in a squirrel that had been raised on OREOS. She was hateful and mean. Addicted to the sugar. She now lives out back in my woods and is probably beating up other squirrels for their lunch money."

I wonder if she watched him grooming the humans and got a yen for him to do it to her. Squirrels do groom their close friends/relatives in the wild, usually in bed, though :)"

squirrels,2tzfcz,hacelepues,4,Wed Jan 28 17:47:51 2015 UTC,You are a fine person for helping. Right now warmth and access to water are all you can do while you see if it recovers.
squirrels,2tzfcz,susanshoos,5,Wed Jan 28 18:19:12 2015 UTC,How do you recommend giving it water?  Not sure if I should handle it or not.
squirrels,2tzfcz,susanshoos,2,Wed Jan 28 18:20:12 2015 UTC,A teeny bowl if that's all you have but a syringe or a small pet water bottle with a spout that you could hold to his little mouth. Even bottled water with the sippy top would work. I'm rooting for you :)
squirrels,2tzfcz,susanshoos,3,Wed Jan 28 20:12:36 2015 UTC,I tried putting a soaked qtip close to his face and he flipped out. I wrote that story as a reply to another comment here if you want to read.   But that was very stressful for the both of us haha so I'm not sure how to go about giving him fluids. Maybe I could drop something he can eat that absorbs water in there? Is there anything like that?
squirrels,2tzfcz,susanshoos,1 point,Wed Jan 28 20:45:10 2015 UTC,Dishcloth or sponge to suck? A piece of wet bread to eat?
squirrels,2tzfcz,snugglebuttt,2,Wed Jan 28 20:56:57 2015 UTC,I wasn't sure if they could eat bread. I guess if it's already wet it's not like it's going to expand more inthe stomach!  I'll do that.
squirrels,2tzfcz,susanshoos,1 point,Wed Jan 28 21:30:31 2015 UTC,"I like /u/snugglebuttt's suggestion about the microwaved rice but if that's not possible, you have done a wonderful job :)"

squirrels,2tzfcz,snugglebuttt,1 point,Wed Jan 28 22:12:10 2015 UTC,"The rice isn't for eating--it just gets warm and will keep your little buddy warm. I don't know why scientifically, but microwaved dry rice will hold heat pretty well. Make sure it's in a sock or cloth so that it won't scald your new friend.  Squirrels, ideally, shouldn't eat bread. That said, a little bit won't hurt. They are omnivores and can eat tons of stuff, it's just that some things are more healthy than others. Nuts are the best of the best."
squirrels,2tzfcz,snugglebuttt,2,Wed Jan 28 22:24:45 2015 UTC,"I once saw a squirrel eating a chicken wing... yeah haha.    Well he hasn't touched the pecans.  He was very very still when I last checked on him... it's hard to see through the box but I thought he might have died.  So I lifted the pillow and he's breathing but back to being very very still, like when I first found him.  I hope his condition isn't worsening :/  We'll see.  Making the rice sock now."
squirrels,2tzfcz,snugglebuttt,5,Wed Jan 28 22:27:18 2015 UTC,"Photos of the squirrel http://m.imgur.com/a/h9cl6  He's still alive. I shelled a peanut and put it in there with him, close to his face. I don't know if he can grab it but it looks like his nose is twitching more now. Perhaps the smell?  He seems pretty aware."
squirrels,2tzfcz,TheJigen,2,Wed Jan 28 18:19:38 2015 UTC,So sorry for the little guy. You certainly made him more comfortable :(
squirrels,2tzfcz,Flurried,1 point,Thu Jan 29 02:01:00 2015 UTC,"Probably not from a fall...these little guys can fall from 100+ feet and still not get injured, mine jump off the roof all the time. Don't know your location i.e. weather hot or cold as well as other predators hawks, eagles, the neighbors cat. I feed mine peanuts in the shell and sunflower seed mix, and a pan of water. Make calls to a few vets and ask for more advice. Good Luck"

My dog used to do that, too. They both look at me and pose.  One of my squirrels grabbed my phone and looked at the screen while I was video taping her. We sat on the couch and watched the video together. She seemed really interested while watching it. I think she understands what it is now because she poses like crazy haha. It's amazing how smart squirrels can be. So many people just don't understand this. They're smart, playful, clever, loving, energetic, beautiful, little creatures.  These are my outdoor pets. I think of them as my furry little babies. I love them and take care of them as if they were my children."

squirrels,2rk0sd,Waterrat,2,Tue Jan 6 22:43:00 2015 UTC,I also put two things of hot water out for them every morning since it's always frozen now. Sometimes they just hover over the water for the warmth. One time I saw one of my babies lick ice to try to get some water and I felt so bad. So now I provide them with plenty of water and nuts. They're the most spoiled little squirrels but I love them so much. I don't have children and I never will so my squirrels are my babies.
