linux4noobs,3e3xi9,lotsoscott,4,Tue Jul 21 19:38:49 2015 UTC,"A lot of shell scripting isn't necessarily straight up bash, but definitely involves a lot of GNU tools.  Some things I recommend try out when they're getting started (after understanding basic syntax). These aren't in a specific order.    Scripting an SFTP upload/download (also helps user learn about keys, and potentially some SSH) Scripting regular FTP (upload/download - with auth too!) (likely to learn tools like expect) Write a script that renames files. (maybe upper to lower case, vice versa etc). Write a script that can read files and print out their content (make sure it can handle files with spaces in the name). Formatting matters! Use terminal colors for bonus points. Get a little dirty with sed and awk. This is often situation dependent. Sending email from the command line (so your script can email you if it fails/passes - tip, you can often ""email"" a cell phone number to get texts instead). write a script that runs a command - make sure you know how to check the exit code if it ran correctly or not. (And perhaps capture it in a variable and display a custom message if it fails). Take a script you previously wrote and incorporate some kind of logging (redirecting stdout or using something like tee). Make sure your logs have some kind of timestamp (date command). Make a script you wrote have exit codes for various errors. Make a script that takes command line arguments if you haven't already. Run a script in cron - try to use a variable or alias from your bash_profile. This helps in understanding why cron might not be able to run your job correctly (interactive vs non-interactive).   Books like the Oreilly ""Bash Cookbook"" are super helpful for getting ideas for things too!"

Please don't be discouraged. usually it is very easy to get up and running. your experience is atypical but the issues you mentioned can be resolved. Let's tackle them one at a time.  Please make sure you are using Ubuntu 15.04 64bit if your PC supports 64bit.  you can either purge he nvidia drivers you installed to get up and running again, or it may be quicker/easier to just do a fresh install so we can help you overcome your issues.  I suspect that wifi is the most important issue, so let's start there. Until the wifi is working you'll need to use an ethernet cable connected from your computer to the switch/router to access the internet.  You will want to make sure that ubuntu is up to date before continuing.  Open up a terminal with CTRL-ALT-T and run the command:   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade   after that is done you'll need to restart the computer.  Now that it's up to date see if wifi is working. if not, see if there is a recommended driver available in additional hardware.  if all that fails we need to know what make/model of the wireless nic is with the following command:   lshw -C network   you can paste the output here. Please make sure you use the CODE tag so it is formatted easily to read."

Definitely look into virtual desktops for your situation; they're a true ""game-changer"".

It just works for me better.  The main problem I guess is because I use LXQT. So, when a game starts and changes the resolution, it can mess where the panel is, and it isn't always viewable. I can command 2 (stupid macbook) and get to a new desktop, but then I can't often find the panel. And as pcmanfm-qt takes over the deskop, no rightclick menu either.

I removed the eSATA cable (just in case), moved my SDD to port 5 and the 4HDD's to 1-4; set IDE/AHCI respectively.

Instead, why dont you consider using your Windows license key and run the Windows applications inside a virtual machine?  VirtualBox is free, and has a ""Seamless"" mode that I frequently use.  Basically it adds the windows start bar to your linux desktop, and programs you run from it work just fine, because they think they're running on windows  In my opinion this is easier than Wine, or Dual Booting.  You need to have your Windows installation media and license key, however."

Hibernation is possible but there are additional steps required. For arch linux you have to adjust the bootloader config and the initramfs. I think for Ubuntu it's the same.   If you want use it for hibernation the size of the file should be at least the size of your RAM.   By the way using an encrypted swap partition does work too.

Though Vorbis would be the next best. Opus has very little device support, but it works for me, so that's what I use.

It's like virtual RAM used to be in Windows. They say it's a good idea to have twice the size of your RAM allocated to swap. That said, I don't have any swap on my current build and it doesn't really suffer.  The rest of the space (50GB - 6.5GB for install - swap partition) is the space you'll have to install your programs on. It would be a pretty bland experience if you just installed Ubuntu and didn't do anything with it.

Copy the Ubuntu .iso to a USB drive or a dvd, set your bios to boot ""UEFI only"" and boot device to the Ubuntu drive you just made. Have both old and new SSDs running and the installer will give you an option to install it to the new drive. You just have to know which SSD is which so you don't accidentally install it on the Windows drive.   This way you can have grub option for both OSs when booting.

You can also use MS Office online for this. If you go to a technology college they'll probably have Windows and maybe Office available for free or a low price that you can put in a virtual machine (archive it and back the archive up...).  There's no 1-click way to do full disk encryption with multi-boot. At most you can do home folder encryption but that's not 100% secure. Encryption is useful e.g. for laptops in case they get stolen, but you should not play with it unless you know what it'll do. Even so, what should have happened is that Mint wiped Windows and installed itself as the only OS, but you had problems unlocking Mint :/  Linux will feel alien for the first month or so. You may feel limited but that's because you don't know how to do the things you previously knew. Some things will be harder and others easier than Windows. With patience and enthusiasm you'll get used to it, and Windows will start to feel awkward in many things ;)  I recommend doing experiments and trying distros in virtual machines, so that you can explore Linux without screwing up your main system.  You don't need to learn the command line (shell) but if you want to do more advanced things it's useful to know the basics. Coming from Windows, the command line looks like an ancient thing that only some people use, but it's actually a very powerful tool. Many advanced tools (not meant to be used by non-technical people) only come in command line form, because it's universal and many times it isn't harder than a quick glance at the manual (man <name>) and looking at a few examples. Here's an excellent free book on the Linux command line (currently down because SourceForge is having problems in the last couple of days, try archive.org). The PDF is very thorough, you should probably only read the basics and what you need. Don't worry if you don't grasp it right away, you only get used to it by using."

Word, Powerpoint and so on: Microsoft Office doesn't run (natively) on Linux. However, LibreOffice can open and save Microsoft Office formats. If you have very elaborate documents with lots of tables and so on, you might find slight differences to thing like formatting and spacing, but most Office documents will work just fine in LO.  If you want to be sure before you make the jump, you can get LibreOffice for Windows and makes sure your most important files look right in it. It's free (gratis and libre).  If you absolutely need 100% compatibility with MS Office, there are various ways to run Microsoft Office on Linux. You can install Windows on a virtual machine (which requires a Windows licence), or run Windows software on Linux using a compatibility layer called Wine. For Microsoft Office, I would recommend using Crossover, a commercial version of Wine that helps fund Wine development. It costs money, but it's much less than a Windows licence."

linux4noobs,3duahh,dwitman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:30:20 2015 UTC,"MS office file formats are such a closed sources mess that even Microsoft itself can't be relied upon to accurately interpret the files across platform depending on what sort of formatting and features your documents include.   A document created on a Windows copy of office often won't render or print correctly on the online version or the Mac version of the same software, made by the same company, so if you heavily rely on office the best route for a beginner will be to either dual boot or set up a windows virtual machine that runs Windows Office. Most distros will install along side windows these days easily for a dual boot setup, but you should back up your critical documents to physical media or the cloud before you install, in case you accidentally nuke the windows partition.   I suspect most of your professors will be willing to open and grade documents that are created with Libre Office, as I believe it creates files MS Office can read, but, again, the formatting might not (probably won't) hold up between software, and any documents they supply  for you might rely on features of MS office that Libre office doesn't yet support well."

linux4noobs,3dude5,Kahru,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:50:12 2015 UTC,I have had this problem on and off with all versions of Ubuntu. Usually if clears up with a reboot. I suspect it has something to do with the SD drive unit going into powersaving mode and Ubuntu not recognizing it when it wakes up on a card insertion.  On Windows you can use powermanager to disable powersaving mode on usb devices (and the sd reader is actually a usb device). But I don't know how to do that on Ubuntu.

First of all, I do not see an EFI partition on /dev/sda your primary drive with windows. see on your thumbdrive on /dev/sdb the 2nd partition is Id type ef. That is required for booting in UEFI mode.   Was windows installed while the system was originally set to legacy bios mode instead of UEFI? That would explain the lack of an EFI partition. Also the primary drive should have a GPT (GUID Partition Table) as well since it has so many primary partitions and no extended partitions.  Now an important questions:  1) how did you resize the partition and create new ones?  2) Did you move any partitions to the left or right of the disk?  3) by any chance you didn't add an msdos partition table did you?"

linux4noobs,3dr0f5,neibrhoodnobody,5,Sat Jul 18 16:53:17 2015 UTC,"Please ignore the poor formatting, I'm on mobile but I do want to help. So here's what you'll need to do. Firstly, do you have a running computer you can access the internet from? I'm assuming you do, since you got Mint going in the first place.     Download (http://www.linuxmint.com/download.php) the ISO for your selected distribution (I'm partial to Mint for newbies myself, but to each his own). I'll continue with the Mint install since I'm most familiar with that. Use Rufus (http://rufus.akeo.ie/) to format and install the ISO to your USB drive. From Windows. This will also make it bootable by the target host computer. In the host computer, access the BIOS options; disable secure boot and enable legacy boot (or if you can select boot override, we can use that option as well). Boot into the USB by either the boot override option, or selecting it as the primary boot device on BIOS options. Once in the live session, click on the ""Install Linux Mint"" option on the desktop. If will open an installer much like the ones you're used to in Windows. When you get to the disk partitioning, use this method (http://www.linuxbsdos.com/2014/07/02/manual-disk-partitioning-guide-for-linux-mint-17-kde/) to partition your disks, or just let the installer do it for you if you're not comfortable partitioning yourself. This is the part of the install that formats and segments your disk. Windows does this during the installer, but will automatically select the necessary options for you without any input. Finish the install wizard, then click on the reboot option. Restart your computer and remove the USB drive and you should boot into a fully functional, shiny new Mint desktop.    If you have any issues along the way, PM me or post here and I'll do what I can to help. Don't get discouraged, you can do this, you're almost there and it's worth the effort."

linux4noobs,3dr0f5,floppybutton,3,Sat Jul 18 17:37:54 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't have any issues with the SSD. They are rated for enough sector rewrites to last you over a decade of continuous disk activity. Much more than a HDD, and even then you shouldn't see any issues with your OP"

linux4noobs,3dr0f5,floppybutton,3,Sat Jul 18 18:20:15 2015 UTC,"OK so it looks like your computer isn't recognizing the SSD, since Kingston is usually the USB drive, and there isn't another device showing up here. Try shutting down, then verifying the connections on your SSD are good, then start up again.  You could also try to run the partitioning software and see if it shows up in there, as it might just not be formatted yet.  As for Xubuntu, that's the cool thing about Linux! Xubuntu uses a desktop environment called XFCE4, which you can easily install after you're in your Mint install. All you have to do is run the command  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xfce4 xfce4-goodies -y   After that finishes, log out and you'll be able to select XFCE as your preferred environment when you log back in.

Pick the option ""I want to do something else"" and you'll be brought to the the disk manager (gparted).

Hit the complete icon (or submit, or something like that, I can't remember what it's called) and it will delete the partitions. Go back to the previous page after you've deleted all the partitions, and select the option with a name like ""Let Mint partition my drive for me"" and select your SSD to install from.

Also I see you're not using any compositing effects (shadows and etc.) which you propably could use :) Also take some time to try some desktop environments in a virtual machine by installing Mint variants and *buntus (use a program like VirtualBox) (installing DEs in your system can mess some things up, and it's problematic for beginners)."

linux4noobs,3dqr8d,MaggotStorm,19,Sat Jul 18 15:27:13 2015 UTC,Apt is the package manager for Debian and all of it's bastard children and should be the only thing you use for at least a year. It is used to search and install programs from the repos.  Yum is the CentOS equivalent. Learn it.  Configure/make etc.. are used when compiling source code into binaries for installation and you shouldn't be using them until    you have a thorough grasp on how to find existing programs ready made and available in your repos. Understand how to make use of error messages Understand dependencies Are competent at maintaining your existing system Understand what it will take to take over the maintenance of programs that your system has been doing for you. Have a clue about avoiding malware A bunch of other shit
linux4noobs,3dqr8d,registereduser2,4,Sat Jul 18 15:38:44 2015 UTC,"This is sort of a reiteration of what /u/registereduser2 said.  Apt is, like was mentioned before, the package manager for Debian and its derivatives. Almost every distribution has a package manager: yum for Red Hat and its derivatives, pacman for Arch, portage for gentoo. The gist of package managers is that they let you download and install pre-compiled binaries. It pulls ""packages"" from public repositories that house them.  Software entries in repos are really nice in that they list what dependencies they need. The package manager will see this and say ""hey, you need this other package as well to be able to run this one. I'll go ahead and install that one too for you because I'm a great guy"".  Additionally, all updates to software are managed through the repositories. If you want to update a package to the latest version, all it takes is a simple  yum update package_name   and it'll take care of everything for you! Other package managers work this way as well.  Sometimes when you uninstall a package, it'll have lingering dependencies that nothing else depends on. The package manager will notice this, and give you a heads up when you go to remove it! This is extremely useful for combating software clutter.    Now, on the other hand, you have things like makefiles. This are quite a bit different. In theory it's the same thing as a package manager, but the bulk of the work involved installing software (there's a lot--we absolutely take package managers for granted) is handled by you instead! Makefiles are for software that you compile yourself (sort of).  Makefiles are scripts that consist of a bunch of commands to run that will eventually result in an compiled piece of software. Typically, they consist of commands that run the compiler, effectively compiling everything for you! The compilation process is initiated by running make in the directory that the source code is in (there will be a file called makefile in there, so you know it's the right place).  Once you have the compiled software, you have to install it! That's where running make install comes into play: it'll install the software that you just compiled. Installing a software is basically setting the software to be runnable by multiple users on the system (as opposed to just compiling it, which restricts the usability to that user and the directory you compiled it in).  Not every system is the same, though! I run gentoo, and that certainly won't have the same configuration as your CentOS system, right? This is where ./configure comes in (I realize this is out of order, the process is always configure -> make -> make install). ./configure will look at your system and configure the software to work best with what you have so that, after compiling and installing, it runs at peak efficiency (in a perfect world--this isn't always the case in practice, but it's still necessary). This is also the part of the process that lets you know if you're missing dependencies. It won't install them for you, but it'll let you know which ones you need.  You have to run ./configure make and make install inside of the directory that all of the source files are in. ./configure is essentially saying ""hey, look in the current directory (.) for a file called configure, and execute it. Knowing how to execute files in the current directory on the fly like this is very good knowledge to have.    So, what's the benefit of using one over the other? Why not just use the package manager for everything? Well, the package manager pulls from public repositories to get the binaries. Not everyone is able to have their software in the repositories, (un)fortunately. This is a security matter--you wouldn't want just any software in there, right? You'd want only trusted software! Software that you know isn't going to harm your computer. Trusted repositories (as opposed to untrusted ones, which do exist and you can use them if you desire) are very careful about which software they choose to host. If a piece of software is installed from a repository and it harms a user's system, the ones who manage the repository are the ones at fault for betraying the trust of its users.  Software that doesn't come from a repository typically needs to be compiled and installed by the end-user (you!). Sometimes they come as pre-compiled binaries, but not always.  Sometimes the software you get from a package manager isn't best suited for your system. If you have access to the source code, you can compile it yourself with configuration options that are best-fit for your system. This requires a very firm grasp on the configuration of your system, so I would recommend doing this only when you can't install something via the package manager.    This ended up being a much longer post than I anticipated. In short: package managers are great, and even the best Linux gurus will use them often, as it's the easiest way to install software. I wouldn't recommend compiling and installing software yourself unless you absolutely know what you're doing (i.e. you know what a compiler is doing when it's compiling software). Compiling stuff yourself does not have the reputation of a public repository to back it up, so there's always risks involved. On the plus side: you have access to the software's source code! If you can, you're able to read for yourself what the software is doing and if it will negatively impact your system.  I hope this answered your question sufficiently!"
linux4noobs,3dqr8d,TheGreekBrit,2,Sat Jul 18 18:14:21 2015 UTC,"Alright so this is my situation: I'm trying to install Cryptol, al language that appears to have no yum install. For it I need Haskell and CVC4. I am having trouble using haskell ' s yum install and CVC4 doesn't seem to have one.  I know I'm really bordering on spoon fed info here, but do you think you could walk me through the process? I've googled  specific guides but they all seem to be doing different shit"
linux4noobs,3dqr8d,TheGreekBrit,3,Sat Jul 18 18:43:43 2015 UTC,"It's your lucky day! It's crazy dead at my work today, so I've got a lot of time to explain it to you! (note: as of the time of me finishing this post, my shift ended)  First of all: don't be ashamed for needing help! Being a lone wolf gets you nowhere in this world. Always ask for help when needed. People are generally pretty willing to help!  Anyway, I just installed it on my server running CentOS 6.6. Going forward, this is the version I assume you're running on. If what I say doesn't work, let me know which version you have and I'll adjust the commands (if that's the problem, that is).  So, the reason you're likely having issues is because you can't find the package haskell in the yum repository, right? That's because it isn't there! Fortunately, there's this really cool repo called EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) that has it! This is a really popular repo, so it's a good thing you're learning about it now! It has a bunch of stuff in there that isn't in the default repos that Red Hat derivatives use by default.  Here's how you tell yum to use this repo:  yum install epel-release side-note: this isn't the only way to get yum to use another repo  So now you told yum to use this fancy EPEL repo. You run this:  yum install haskell  but it doesn't work! Damn you TGB, you lied to me!  Not so! Yum caches all of the information in its repos periodically. Haskell isn't there because the information for the EPEL repo isn't in yum's cache yet. How do you update the cache? Like this:  yum update  In reality, this command updates all of your packages. This works for what we're doing, though.  So now you have the EPEL repo cached and ready to go! So now you run this again:  yum install haskell  No package haskell available.  Dammit TGB stop screwing around! You said haskell is in the EPEL repo, but it's not there! You lied!  Again, not so! This is a fantastic introduction to the fact that packages don't always have the name that you think. Package managers have a way to help you out with this, though! Check it out:  yum search haskell  Holy butts that's a lot of packages! Effectively, this searches for a case-insensitive package in the repos that you have. In this case, it's pulling a whole bunch from GHC that you don't need. The package that you do need is called haskell-platform.  yum install haskell-platform  It works!!!! Moving on then.    The process for getting CVC4 and finally Cryptol is the same as I mentioned in my original post. Get the tarball. You can get the files like this:  wget http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/builds/src/cvc4-1.4.tar.gz  and you extract it like this:  tar xzvf cvc4-1.4.tar.gz  (if you need clarification about any of the above commands (or any commands in general), shoot me a PM)  So now you have the source! Go into the directory you just extracted (it's called **cvc4-1.4), and run:  ./configure  make  make install  Oh tits, make fails! Why is that? Well to put it briefly, CVC4 requires special shit to install it. You'll need to do a couple things first:  cd contrib  ./get-antlr-3.4  This will install antlr which is evidently a dependency for CVC4. Additionally, it will give you the ./configure line you need to run after this. It will be the very last line of the output of the previous command, and will look something like this:  ./configure --with-antlr-dir=/root/cvc4-1.4/antlr-3.4 ANTLR=/root/cvc4-1.4/antlr-3.4/bin/antlr3  Go up one directory with cd .. and run that line. Be sure to run the ./configure that you're given, and not the one I just showed you. The one I have has the working directory as /root/cvc4-1.4, which is just where I happen to be working on my system. Don't worry about this, just use the one the previous script gave you.  After that, just run make  IT FAILED. STOP GETTING MY HOPES UP TGB.  I'll spare you the details, but the gist of it is that CVC4 also has boost as a dependency. Install it like so:  yum install boost boost-devel boost-doc  then run the ./configure line you were given earlier once again. It should complete successfully this time!  Now run make  HOLY DICKS ON A HAMSTER TGB IT WORKED THANK CHRIST  Yes indeed it did! Wait for that to finish (this will take a couple minutes, you should grab a snack!), then run the following to verify the installation:  make check  make install  Finally, try running cvc4 It should bring up the CVC4 prompt, which looks something like CVC4>  After that finishes and there's no errors, it's time to finally install Cryptol!    Grab the Cryptol ZIP if you don't already have it. Because it's a zip file, you unzip it differently than you would a tar archive:  unzip master.zip  cd into the directory that gets created (cryptol-master), then run make (there's no configuration to be done this time! you can tell because there's no configure file in this folder).  Aww yiss, feels good right? Now just run make check then make install and you'll be done!    Whew! That was fun. To put this into perspective: if Cryptol and CVC4 had packages in the default repo (or EPEL), this would just be a simple yum install cryptol and you'd be done! Crazy, right? Use the package manager whenever possible!    I have to take off from work right now because I'm half and hour into overtime. If you have any trouble, or if you have any questions, feel free to shoot me a PM and I'll try and help you out!  Enjoy Cryptol!"

For posterity, here's the issue you're having:  (root@host)-(09:29am-:-Jul 19)-- (cryptol-master) make fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git cabal sandbox init cabal: unrecognised command: sandbox (try --help) make: *** [/root/cryptol-master/.cabal-sandbox] Error 1   What's this mean? Well, it means that it's trying to run cabal sandbox init but sandbox doesn't exist. If we do cabal --help like the error says, we can see that this is indeed the case.  Why does it try to use something that doesn't exist?? Everything is perfect and--  (root@host)-(09:34am-:-Jul 19)-- (cryptol-master) cabal --version cabal-install version 0.10.2 using version 1.10.2.0 of the Cabal library   Argh! Outdated version!

Guess we have to update it manually, then.  I'm sorry for cutting this short, but work is busier than it normally is on a Sunday. The gist of it that I found is that GHC is pretty dated, so Cabal is in turn dated. You need at least version 1.18 to use sandbox. I would recommend getting rid of ghc and installing it fresh with the latest version (at least 7.8 will work I believe).  Sorry again!

I think the best advice you can get is to first try everything with CentOS virtualized. When there's no risk at all, you are much more free to experiment at your leisure. VirtualBox and VMWare both offer free solutions to do that, check them out.    And I'll second /u/registereduser2 about Yum. Package management is basic knowledge you should spend some time learning.

linux4noobs,3dqr8d,dumpster_dinner,0,Sat Jul 18 16:12:53 2015 UTC,"CentOS and Fedora are so similar that CentOS can really be considered an LTS version of Fedora. Fundamentally everything you do in Fedora is done the same way in CentOS. The only big difference is that Fedora has more and more up-to-date packages than CentOS, but that can addressed by adding the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repository to a CentOS installation.  As far as the original question that was presented by OP, I would defer to the reply made earlier in this thread by /u/registereduser2. I would also agree that a newbie shouldn't go anywhere near a make file until they at least grasp the basics of package management."

If you had simply deleted the partition table, or formatted the partition, you could have probably recovered it with TestDisk or PhotoRec.

You don't really have a ""system"" toolkit, although all of GNOME's bundled apps use GTK and all of KDE's tend to use Qt.  Instead, an application can choose one of those toolkits (GTK, Qt, SWT, AWT, Swing etc) and use its functionality, so for Q1 and 2, yes, an application will be dependant on a certain toolkit and will abide by the rules of that toolkit. Some applications can be compatible with multiple ones, but it's a pain and rare as the application will effectively have to check which windowing toolkit it's using when it wants to do anything and make sure to only use the functions of that toolkit.

You'd probably find that Mint would automatically load and install the fglrx drivers, anyway. If they give problems then you'd download and install the AMD proprietary drivers in Linux.

How can I resize an LVM partition?  For the domain name, you'll need to update the IP address within the dns servers - most likely with your domain registrar... For example on GoDaddy.  I suggest that you be very careful about doing this. Ensure that you firewall (most likely your router) only opens the required ports. Would be safe to ensure that the firewall is enabled on Ubuntu as well - and again, only open required ports."

linux4noobs,3dn9ex,kaymer327,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:07:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not too familiar with ownCloud... But with plex, you just need to create a free account on Plex.tv and login with that account on your PlexServer and all of the clients (Plex App on your phone, tablet, Roku, etc). You can also access your plex remotely via plex.tv.  This is assuming that your router is configured properly to allow Plex remote access. Most routers support UPNP, so you shouldn't have to do anything. Otherwise you'll have to setup a port forward.  So once the plex accounts are all connected and remote access is successful, no need to worry about your domain name or IP...  Now, if you wanted to access OTHER things... That might be a different story and you'll need DNS to be updated.  So you have an IP and a domain name. DNS is what puts those 2 things together. From your terminal type ""nslookup reddit.com"" and it will return reddit's IP(s). You need to tell ""the internet"" how to make that connection. This is generally done via your domain registrar - see my previous GoDaddy example. Check with your registrar for specifics about getting that done. It's usually a quick/easy thing, but takes time to replicate once setup."

Never tried Gone Home though.  However I do have a host of games that have issues, probably due in part to the tiling WM I use. I have probably about a half-dozen or so games that if I want to play, despite having a Linux version, it's easier to deal with in in Windows. They will do wonky things that have to do with screen size and window position, and often mouse tracking issues.  The new Jagged Alliance game I can't play in Linux due to my mouse not correctly tracking, for example. A good portion of the games will detect my desktop resolution and automatically set themselves to it. Which kinda sucks because I have a fairly large, asymmetrical multi-monitor setup and it doesn't recognize that. Just thinks my resolution is like 4k something by 3k something."

While unity is a 'heavier' DE, its my experience that having >2GB of RAM and at least 512MB of vRAM will allow unity to run seamlessly. My weakest machine, a mid 2010 macbook, has 1.7GB RAM, 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, and 256MB vRAM - it runs ubuntu 15.04 w/ unity pretty well, although if I don't remember to close out accessory programs I'll sometimes run short on memory, but its a small hiccup that happens rarely (couple times a week, maybe, and I carry this thing around nearly everywhere, everyday). The only other problem it has are that some desktop effects look a bit off if the machine is taxed, but I attribute that to the poor amount of vRAM on the machine.    Power consumption-wise, I've found unity to be a tad bit of a battery hog. I'd estimate that the macbook has at least 10% greater battery life when using xfce or mate. So while its a little more consuming compared to these 'light' DEs, I've no idea how it compares to other 'heavy' ones. Of course, this bit is quite anecdotal, so YMMV.

Everything tends to be bigger in GNU/Linux (at least from my experience) so while a ~120 PPI monitor running at the default DPI of 96 may be uncomfortable in Windows it'll look just fine in Xubuntu for example. I'd say focus on finding one with a better display and don't worry about HDD size since a decent brand new HDD will only set you back $40 at the most. Take note as to how thick the HDD is before purchasing one though.  Note that for most use an older model with a C2D will do you just fine. My T500 (RIP) with a T9700 IIRC was able to play 10-bit 1080p video flawlessly and I could watch 60 FPS Twitch streams via Livestreamer with no problem. If you're gonna be working with VMs or whatever perhaps something with an i7 would be better-suited for you.  Check the ThinkWiki to see which models are affected by particular manufacturing mistakes before making a purchase, but generally-speaking the T420 is a good choice. Some tripfag whose name I've forgotten also made a comprehensive guide to purchasing used TPs here.  Good luck."

That's why sometimes, it's a very good idea to use   ls xyz*xx??

linux4noobs,3df0tg,Gatsbyyy,33,Wed Jul 15 19:29:44 2015 UTC,"The reasons that made me use it:  1) Free Software philosophy. This was a shock to me when I discovered it and I felt in love immediately. It felt natural and generous in opposition to all the artificial limitations imposed to the user by closed licenses, an ecosystem where free riders are welcomed and not tagged as pirates? Count me in, of course I immediately asked myself what I could contribute, and even if my coding skills aren't good enough to send a patch to the Kernel it feels great when a bug you reported gets fixed, a feature you suggested gets implemented, when someone says that the HowTo you wrote was helpful, when the translation you make becomes official... It's so easy to become part of it.  2) Choice. It's not an objective on it's own but a byproduct of permissive licenses, it's so easy to fork an existing project that the amount of choices available in Linux is astonishing. Distros, Desktop Environments, editors... You almost never have to put up with decisions you dislike, there are plenty of alternatives to check. The only time this failed to me are Music players, there are tons of them but I still prefer Foobar2000, but well... some projects follow it's shadow so perhaps one day.  3) Learning. You can easily install a Linux distro by clicking next next next and only use it to view cat pictures, but if you have the slightest interest in the inner workings of an operative system the freedom you get in Linux or BSD is unmatched, you can change, add, or remove components to your wish, man you can even recompile the Kernel if you feel so! If you, as most people, learn by doing, Linux is paradise.  4) Community. You might have heard that hackers are rough, yes they are if you feel entitled to get a poorly constructed question answered, but if you present them an interesting problem things change a lot. So linking this to point 3, if you wish to learn you will learn from the best.  5) Convenience. Lots of software available right there in my distro without fishing around Internet, a single command to upgrade your whole OS, highly reduced risk of malware... where do I have to sign?"
linux4noobs,3df0tg,lumentza,18,Wed Jul 15 20:26:51 2015 UTC,"6) Stability. If Linux breaks, I probably got a little overzealous in tinkering with things I maybe shouldn't have.

linux4noobs,3df0tg,ChaosCon,4,Thu Jul 16 02:44:55 2015 UTC,"7) Security. Code is in the open. Chances of corporations capitulating to gov't requests to include backdoors are reduced (won't say eliminated - there are probably hardware backdoors). Used to be tinfoil stuff but lately it's been shown to be a valid concern.  Not to mention the superior permissions model.  8) Variety.

The few friends and family that I have managed to convert to linux end up spending less time ""fixing"" things.  Let's take the example of a laptop that doesn't get used that much. Two or three weeks have gone by and you dust off the old laptop and power it on. Windows spends the next 30 minutes applying updates and rebooting half a dozen times before you can actually get anything done. On linux you're looking at 5-10 minutes and often without needing a reboot.  The installation process is another area where I think linux is a clear winner. When a friend calls and asks ""hey what's that software you use to convert videos"", I can just send them some terminal commands and be pretty sure they won't mess things up. In windows my friend could have a hijacked (toolbar helpers) browser that inserts a download now link. This is especially frustrating when the friend says, ""that link you sent me was for the wrong software"". It's even worse if they actually fall for the decoy links and install even more toolbars because they trusted you to send them a good link."

(I'm assuming Joe and Sally are nearly computer-illiterate people who only use computers for sending e-mails, browsing the net and using facebook).   Less lags. The system starts quicker, the programs start quicker. Even if one window freezes, it usually doesn't paralyse everything else that's open. You know that thing when your computer magically slows down after some time of use? Your system and programs are producing lots of junk files, your hard disk got stuffed with rubbish and your system is getting slower and slower. Linux doesn't do it. Your software doesn't produce that much junk, and your system doesn't need 1/3 free disk space to run normally. I've seen Linux running normally on 2% free disk space. Have you ever had to buy a new computer because your old one was too slow to run the newest software? I could find you a type of Linux that would work perfectly OK on that old computer. With all the newest programs. Are you confused with security, random toolbars appearing in your browser, your search engine changing to ask.com and other weird shit? It comes from programs you install, and sometimes you don't even know you're installing something. You don't have to worry about it on Linux. Here, you install programs from a big collection of perfectly safe, clean and tested software that doesn't sneak any unwanted crap into your computer. It's possible to install something dangerous, but you won't even know how to do it.  You can update all your software at once with a couple of clicks, at the time of your choice. Individual programs won't be showing you annoying messages about needing to update. You might nor remember about updating most of the time, but when you do, you'll update everything. You already have drivers to most of the things you would want to connect to your computer.   To sum up: you're probably used to computers being whimsy machines that cause random problems, freeze out of the blue, and need someone to set them straight. On a user-friendly kind of Linux, things just work with no effort on your side - unless you actively find out how to mess with your system."

For instance, sourceforge still seems to be a source for packages in i.e. arch linux. Although, (edit: looking)so far, only PKGBUILDs here that compile it themselves though.  But they have a much better shot at being clean/safe, the source code can be read, and it can be recompiled. There are at least two (slow moving afaik) projects to try figure out source-binary-correspondence. I think there should basically be a project that. 1) collects checksums of compile-results comparing with distro results.(source-binary correspondence) 2) perhaps there is git(/svn/mercurial/etc)-source-release-source comparison to be done too. 3) where people indicate what source code they read/to what extent of understanding, to try get a grasp on coverage..

However, popular stuff might also be the way to try reach as many people as possible. It also helps if it is a small amount of code.  If i take i.e. Ubuntu, and who is in touch with development there, i feel safer with Arch, to be honest. Although neither i know too well. Ubuntu is clear about eventually wanting to make money, which seems like a ticking sound to me. And for the number of developers that look at it, having more bare distro probably helps.

linux4noobs,3df0tg,Linuxllc,2,Wed Jul 15 23:20:14 2015 UTC,"Command line tools, especially command line package managers, make using your system so much easier. If I want to update software on Windows, and the software doesn't have a built in updating tool (which is deplorably common even today), I have to go to the software developer's website, hope it's in the same place, hope that the update installer is easy to find, hope that it's not bundled with Bonzi Buddy Ask.com or whatever other toolbar has sponsored the download, hope that I don't have to download an enormous file and get interrupted halfway through by Windows or IE [which I am cursed to use at work] failing at something or other. The package manager (I use Linux Mint so that's apt for me) eliminates basically all of these worries. There are also some special purpose command line tools (including the gcc as well as several genetics tools I sometimes use) that work way better on Unix-like systems; on Windows you may have to use Cygwin to get them working. Of course, that's not a Linux specific advantage; OS X, the BSDs, and proprietary Unices also have great command line support as well. And I have to say, Powershell is very useful and versatile and vastly enhances my Windows experience, but it just doesn't play nice with *nix command line utilities, for the most part.  Another great thing about Linux is how easy it is to customize your system. Don't like how your windows, taskbar, or dock are set up? There are tons of window managers available, and most allow a really high level of customization as well. Hate your file browser? Just pick a different one. There are relatively few things in Linux that are visible to the end user that you're actually bound to in any significant way, in contrast to Windows.  I've also noticed, for the most part, Linux boots faster and runs faster than Windows, although the only WMs I ever use are xfce and LXDE so that may have something to do with it. Still, this means that you at least can make a Linux system boot very fast and run like butter, whereas it's a lot harder to do that with Windows without just throwing better hardware at it.  All that having been said, I think that most every OS has a place, and there are some use cases (e.g. PC gaming, certain specialty software‚ÄîIIRC the speech recognition and TTS software we use at work only works on Windows) where I would never try to convince someone to use Linux."

linux4noobs,3df0tg,Aniform,2,Thu Jul 16 04:11:25 2015 UTC,"I started using it way back in the day for practical reasons. I wanted a Unix-like system at home so I could work on my programming assignments for school instead of living in the computer lab on campus. The University where I attended used Sun workstations for our Computer Science courses. I also couldn't afford to upgrade to Windows 95 (poor Computer Science student!) because I would have had to buy a new computer.  I'm a tinkerer by nature, so Linux was a natural fit. If you like figuring out how things work, customizing, tweaking, exploring, learning, and aren't fazed by the possibility of breaking and having to re-install/fix it then Linux is a great way to explore and learn about computing.  I fell in love with Free Software and Open Source Software after using Linux for a while. Proprietary systems that can't be altered, or that force you to agree to terms that I don't like, bother me now. They have their purpose, but I prefer to avoid them if I can.  From a technical perspective I like Linux because it's designed around some good philosophies (everything is a file, small single-purpose programs that you can combine to accomplish things, etc) and is predictable. I've been using it long enough that I have a really good mental model of how it works so it's easier for me to troubleshoot problems or bend it to my will. There's an incredible amount of information and help available on the Internet, so there aren't any barriers to learning about it.  I make my living as a programmer, so I spend a lot of time using computers. It has been really nice to have a system that basically works the same now as it did twenty years ago, and the same OS on my desktop also runs our servers."

But if you ever decide you want to use your computer to do... more  than just what you can do with the apps you bought for it, well then you are ready to start exploring the world of computer programming. And when it comes to computer programming, from the very most basic, beginner, simple things to a Ph.D level computer scientist, Linux is by far the best operating system to use.  The reason is simply that Linux gives you 100% control of every last little tiny detail of the entire system, while still (unless you make a really  big mistake) functioning completely normally when you don't know what you are doing."

They were really un-intuitive. Second thing I hated about the compiler was... well I just got really tired of looking up problems as a new programmer only to find that issue I was having only existed with the MS compiler.  Anyway, I started using the Windows version of GCC, MinGW, then eventually decided to install Linux on one of my laptops. I've been through about five distros and settled on a few favorites. It's really obvious that Linux was originally a programmer's operating system, built by and for programmers. It's very programmer friendly.

For myself personally, I too had a failing windows box and no way to fix without forking over some bucks I did not have.  The timing was perfect.

I stayed because,   No viruses No constant system warning and notifications interrupting me every few minutes or every time I begin a new task.

Using software that has been made by a big community (and also has been looked at by a big community which has zero interest in exploiting your data) sure is nice and the process is absolutely fascinating. Having the chance to look at (and even modify!) the code that powers your machine is very interesting and feels adventurous (to me). Also, if you are in some techy career (from programming to sysadmin to having to process large data or having to automate some silly tasks), Linux certainly caters more to your needs than, say, Windows does.

linux4noobs,3df0tg,ishouldbeworking69,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:05:32 2015 UTC,"Linux is a UNIX clone which adheres closely to what I refer to as the Principle of Best Compromise.  This means that while Linux isn't optimal in every single area, (and is, in my opinion, frankly horrible in some) it represents the proverbial Middle Way.  Hardware support is still occasionally slightly behind Windows, as is GUI stuff, but security is much better.  If you find a sufficiently bare bones distro and know what you are doing, you can do whatever you like with it.    The most powerful automation in existence.   UNIX was originally developed by a telephone company, and used for the purpose of automating exchanges.  Windows users will mention things like PowerShell, Auto-It or AutoHotKey, but the POSIX text userland and scripting language is still the simplest and most effective means of creating simple software machines in existence.  Learn about logic gates and the truth table, and then learn shell scripting.  UNIX is literally an element of religion for me.  For nearly 20 years, I passionately believed that its' command line represented the manner in which humanity was divinely intended to interact with a computer; and that belief has only started to lessen because I've discovered FORTH.  Still, while FORTH is awesome, it is sufficiently abstract that most people will never hear about it, much less use it.  Command line UNIX includes around 75-80% of FORTH's advantages, if you know what you're doing; most of the remaining 20% includes the rough edges which make it inaccessible to mainstream users, and is not necessary for the vast majority of use cases.  The command line interface is UNIX's single greatest strength.  More than anything else, if you are going to use Linux or any other UNIX, this is the reason to do so.    Hardware support.   Given that POSIX compliance is something I care more about, (I can run OpenBSD in vmWare on a Windows 7 host, which might make Theo unhappy, but it means I don't need to care about the fact that he doesn't support a lot of my hardware natively) this isn't an issue for me; but if you want POSIX (or close; Linux developers are expressing a lot of contempt for the standard these days) on x86 bare metal, then Linux is the way to go.  *BSD is always behind Linux in this area, although FreeBSD is doing everything it can to become mainstream these days, tragically.    The best native graphical user interface support available on open source UNIX.   While I don't like GNOME myself, I still consider KDE's old file manager, Konqueror, to be the single greatest GUI application that I've ever used.  A lot of other people also do apparently consider GNOME awesome, and there are lots of other options.  While all of the older window managers will run fine on *BSD, GNOME is intended to work with systemd, which is Linux only.  When it comes to the GUI, Microsoft are still the reigning champion.  Still, if you don't mind the very odd blemish here and there, the fact that Linux also gives you the command line as described above, more than makes up for it.    The best generalised security available.   I say generalised here, because OpenBSD is a system which specialises towards security.  However, OpenBSD does so in order to gain the last proverbial 10-20% which most people will not need, and in some cases sacrifices performance and other things in order to get it.  A lot of OpenBSD's goodness tends to eventually get backported to Linux anyway, given sufficient time.  Linux also still has UNIX's traditional permission model for files, and still utterly humiliates Microsoft on the security front, in general terms.    The widest file system support in existence, that I know of.   Linux can read virtually any file system from any computer architecture, past and present, that you can think of; and probably several that you can't.  Even if I was still going to use *BSD for everything else, I'd use Linux as a central file server.    Greater modularity and flexibility than *BSD.   Linux's overall design allows you precise control over exactly how much or how little of the system you want, to a much greater degree than the BSDs.  This makes it a better choice in the embedded space, or for other scenarios where you only want a kernel and a shell, but don't have room for luxury."

You don't have to scour the internet, try to find the right program, and just cross your fingers and hope you don't get McAfee or some stupid toolbar. You don't usually have to restart your computer to install updates. And your computer won't ever do that thing where it tells you ""Oh hey we're shutting down in 10 minutes. Do you want to put it off for four hours?"". Linux never restarts by surprise. You're in control. It's not as intimidating as it seems. There's documentation for damn near everything, and you don't need to scour the internet for it either. Man pages are your friends! It's free (as in beer). You don't have to pay for the OS, and you don't have to pay for most (any?) programs. You can donate if you like, but if money's tight or you're just cheap, it can save you some dough.

When you use sudo you always use your own password. So you only need to remember your own password to do root things, you don't need a second password for the root user, which you may forget, or which may be stolen.  If someone steals your password, then there is little you can do to stop them unless you have two-factor authentication like storing a symmetric encrypted private key required for login on a USB device, in which case they need to steal your physical key and know your password.  If you do setup a password for the root account, it just opens up one more attack vector for a malicious person to use to potentially login to your system as root, possibly over a network using something like ssh. If root has no password, they have to go through your user account first, which is ostensibly easier for you to control, and then they have to use sudo.  The sudo program also lets you configure more precisely which programs that users can execute, by configuring the /etc/sudoers file."

linux4noobs,3dgofi,jhereg10,2,Thu Jul 16 03:19:16 2015 UTC,Right. I have a chunk of GiB on my 2TB local disk just for swap. It's mainly there so I have some overhead if I run out of RAM. Having swap means I can (slowly) kill whatever is using too many resources.
linux4noobs,3dgofi,sticky-bit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:08:26 2015 UTC,Swap being utilized isn't a problem.  Regularly swapping is though.  The difference is between swapping out an unused process to disk and using the memory for caching disk access versus regularly reading/writing swap in active processes.  Typically you won't have much swapped out though.
linux4noobs,3dgofi,mowrawn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:15:35 2015 UTC,There are cases where you want your system to use more swap. For example if you value performance more than responsiveness.  Swapping out rarely accessed memory allows the system to use more memory as disk cache thus improving performance.

The KB article specifically says:    Note that you must have the HWADDR=<MAC-Address> line also in the ifcfg-ethN file so that NetworkManager knows which interface to ignore. NetworkManager does not use the interface name (eth0, eth1, etc.) because the names may change.   Personally, I wouldn't disable NetworkManager if I was going to take the RHCSA/RHCE tests. I would use the NM_CONTROLLED=<yes|no> parameter as this seem more appropiate for the test.

This is seriously fast. You get the performance of a RAID-0 stripe with the reliability of the underlying RAID-1 mirrors.

I wasn't talking about the MAC filter - the way my router ""reserves"" IP addresses is via MAC address (the MAC filter is in a different configuration section).

Thanks again!"
linux4noobs,3daapw,somewhat_sven,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:53:25 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm sorry I misinterpreted the post. The MAC reservations are basically setting the IP on the router for that device rather than setting it static on each devices. In both scenarios, the IP you choose has to be outside of the range.   I would recommend using the MAC reservation table for devices such as phone and laptops, and set static IPs  for devices such as media servers and AP's"

You're putting to much thought into it.  When a device makes a DHCP request for an IP, the DHCP server looks up the MAC address against the lease file.  If a lease is not assigned, the server grabs a file out of the pool based on the network the requests comes from.  When you assign a static IP to a MAC, the lease is created when the service starts up."

USN for Firefox 39 is here: http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2656-1/. It states the security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 39 only affects Ubuntu 14.04 and newer. That would be a reason for Firefox 39 not becoming available for Ubuntu 12.04. In case we've all forgotten; you only get package upgrades for security fixes on a Ubuntu release. For a few applications you don't just get backported security fixes, applied to the original version shipped with your Ubuntu release, but you get the latest upstream release. Firefox is one such example. Is it too difficult to backport security fixes for Firefox otherwise? I don't know. Point however being that with upgrade to Firefox 39 you are secure on Ubuntu 14.04 and above, and without that upgrade you apparently are equally secure from the things fixed in Firefox 39 on Ubuntu 12.04.   http://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=199433  So I guess I'm fine, I don't think Firefox even gets used on that system (it's my moms), but I though it might be an indication of the laptop falling into a general outdated state, but it seems it's just Firefox.  Edit:  That thread starts out talking about a serious stability issue with Mint 13 32bit & Firefox 39, so if there is no security fix that effects Ubuntu 12.04, then I can see why it's been skipped.  My other systems  Mint 17 Cinnamon 64bit x2  Mint 17 Mate 32bit  Ubuntu 14.04 64bit  All have auto updated to Firefox 39."

More simple browsers usually have less security issues because they‚Äôre not a target for malware developers. Another thing: The browsers are usually limited to the most needed stuff (browsing of course, bookmarks, and maybe some ad filtering options or a simplified add-on function).

linux4noobs,3d6pux,lingben,4,Tue Jul 14 16:57:04 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat several years ago and after exhaustive search, settled on linux mint.I hated Ubuntu's unity desktop environment. Lubuntu is light but it looks ugly and it doesn't have the same polish in terms of codecs and multimedia. Xubuntu and Elementary are two other contenders and to be honest I don't remember why I didn't go with them. elementary probably because it was still not yet an established distro and it locks you in too much to their way of doing things.  I'm running linux mint xfce on an even older laptop with a slower processor and only 2GB of RAM. The OS at startup takes up only 175 MB of RAM and uses less than 1% idle at startup. btw that's about 25MB more RAM than lubuntu (which uses the LXDE desktop environment vs. the XFCE desktop environment). With 2 GB I didn't care - with 4GB you will care even less!   With 4GB of RAM you can even use cinnamon rather than xfce. But if you want it to really fly, go for xfce. Running Cinnamon should use up only about 450MB of RAM. The rest would be available for whatever else you do on top of the OS (not counting the swap partition of course).  As well, linux mint is probably the best choice for a new linux user. Arch, CentOS, Gentoo, Fedora, etc. are great but they have much steeper learning curves. LM comes with everything you need out of the box and there is a wonderful community behind it, either at forums.linuxmint.com or /r/linuxmint. since it is built on ubuntu (debian) there is tonnes of information online about how to do things (for example, how to update libre office, how to install new themes, icons to give your laptop a new fresh look, or make it look like an Apple OS even!)  I've even set up laptops for family and friends who have used windows for eons but are not tech savvy and the switch for them was extremely smooth. They don't have to worry about viruses, malware, and there is no blue screen of death. Every laptop I've set up with linux mint has run for years without one single hiccup. Here's a recent review singing its praises.  Grab the iso from here and use unetbootin or pendrivelinux to put it on a USB stick; that lets you check it out and if you like what you see, then install (pay attention to 32 vs. 64 bit) http://www.linuxmint.com/release.php?id=23  Of course, make sure you backup any data from the HD if you install over it. You can also use the installation wizard to easily set up a dual boot and install linux mint alongside your win OS.  If you do decide to go with linux mint, don't forget to check out this very helpful, guide for tweaking it after install: https://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/  Honestly, there are so many linux distros that it is very tough to choose. Try them out on a live USB to test drive them before you decide. Keep in mind that desktop environments can be swapped out, and so can themes and icons, pointers, etc. Everything is customizable!  To find other distros, take a look at http://distrowatch.com/ (right hand side list... notice that mint is even more popular than ubuntu, even though it is a derivative of it!)  edit: adding a bunch of links and references"

linux4noobs,3d6pux,jollyn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:51:34 2015 UTC,"I'd stick with an Ubuntu base if you're still not comfortable in Linux. Most guides for doing things on Ubuntu are geared towards beginners so it might be a little too dumb but I think it's better to get comfortable with current Linux before jumping into anything weird. Check out lxde, xfce, and mate. Their all different desktop environments and you can theme all of them to make them look different than the defaults pretty easily. Also turning off any sort of compositing will make things look a little worse but the performance improvement is pretty big, especially on the integrated graphics in the core 2 duo chips (and if you have discrete graphics turn that shit off and enjoy your newfound battery life). Once you pick one of the desktop environments, you can grab lubuntu, xubuntu, or Ubuntu mate respectively. I do think you can get better performance out of Arch or one of it's derivatives but Ubuntu is more user friendly imo. Crunchbang(++) was one of my favorite distros back in the day but I've heard mixed things since the original fell off and the reboot started.   I had a x201 so I was in the same boat as you for a while so if you have any questions about squeezing more performance or battery life out of your laptop feel free to ask."

I might add that Mint has a fairly large user base (the largest of all Linux distributions, according to some - albeit pretty speculative - reckonings) and much of the technical advice on can find about Ubuntu holds for Mint too."

Gentoo takes this a bit further by being source-based meaning everything must be compiled, which is not at all beginner friendly, but results in an amazingly fun distro.  LFS takes this to an extreme by only giving you a guidebook to reference as you essentially build your own distro from the ground up."

The best way to learn the Linux command line is to learn this programming language.  The name of this programming language is called ""Bash"". Use Google to search for resources on how to become an efficient Bash programmer.  Also, definitely learn how to use the Vim and/or Emacs text editors. Do NOT become dependent on Nano for editing files.  Also, learn about other command line related software for doing daily tasks. Like play music with mplayer, surf the web with lynx, do E-mail in mutt.  You will eventually learn when it is good to use the command line and when it is good to use the GUI. Basically, the GUI is useful for graphics (obviously), so if you are working with graphics or videos, or presentations, or documents where fonts and layout is important, or spread sheets, or you have to browse the web, just use the GUI. For everything else, use the command line."
linux4noobs,3d2509,deux3xmachina,5,Mon Jul 13 04:09:38 2015 UTC,I see this emphasis on vim/emacs a lot. What's wrong with nano exactly? I know how to use vim but remembering all the bindings is tricky and nano has it all laid out for you - seems simpler for editing small text files. I'm just curious as to why learning vim/emacs is deemed so necessary when most distributions ship with nano as default editor.
linux4noobs,3d2509,Ramin_HAL9001,5,Mon Jul 13 06:20:47 2015 UTC,"Most distros also include either Vi or ViM. But really, it's all about preference. There's very little necessary in Vi, Vim, or Emacs that can't be done in some other editor, they're just some of the more powerful tools because you can customize the ever living hell out of them to do whatever you need to do, quickly.   If you're mostly just tweaking a few dotfiles, don't worry about it. You won't see much benefit."
linux4noobs,3d2509,rice_pan,2,Mon Jul 13 07:01:29 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Nano is a fine piece of software and perfectly useful.  But Vim and Emacs are essentially the Integrated Development Environment (IDEs) of choice for shell scripting languages like Bash. I think if anyone is really interested in becoming a proficient Linux user, they should really learn how to write shell scripts (which is how you get better at learning to use the command line). And if you are going to learn shell scripting, you should use the correct tools to do it, and that means Vim or Emacs, and not Nano.  Emacs is the most powerful editor, but in my opinion it is not really as useful of a tool unless you also learn the Lisp programming language. Most of the power and customizability of Emacs comes from creating and running your own Emacs-Lisp scripts.  Vim, on the other hand, is almost  as powerful as Emacs but not quite (for example, Vim does not have the ability to do terminal multiplexing where as Emacs can, but that is an unimportant detail for beginners), but in my opinion it is generally easier to learn as compared to Emacs. Vim also has it's own scripting language (which is terribly ugly compared to Emacs-Lisp), but I still can and do use Vim as my editor for every programming project, even though I don't know anything about Vim's scripting language. So in my experience, Vim is useful without knowing anything about how to program it, Emacs is not so much.  Don't worry if the Vim key bindings are difficult to remember. Once you learn them, they are useful in many places. Vi is not only the default editor on the majority of Linux and Unix distros, but other programs like less and man have come to use the Vi key bindings."

Personally, I don't like Canonical all too much, so I lean towards Mint, but whatever floats your boat.  Moving to Arch. I love Arch, because I love redoing everything every week or so. Little extreme, but that's me. A lot of distros, by their very nature of pre-installing stuff, make it just a little harder for you to configure everything. Arch doesn't have that. You get the bare minimum at the start.

A lot of users are saying use Gentoo or compile a kernel, but those are way more advanced tasks.  If you're not comfortable with Linux yet, you need to start off gradual and move on as time allows.  Mint is the #1 distro on DistroWatch by a huge margin (some 2000+ points over Ubuntu) and for very good reason.  It's incredibly user friendly, easy to use, highly supported and most tutorials that work for Ubuntu will work for Mint as well, as both are Debian-based.  I'm just starting to use Arch and I really enjoy the modularity/customiziability, but I can see a few shortcomings in ease of use and availability of packages compared to other Debian-based distros."

Mint is very customizable and does a great job with having themes and other options available for it.  I use the Cinnamon version and it has some great customizations available for it, as well.

linux4noobs,3d2vmu,Linuxllc,2,Mon Jul 13 10:18:50 2015 UTC,"Vi was originally a UNIX program which allowed you to edit file ""visually"" (hence the name). Vim is an open-source, backwards-compatible clone of the original Vi. Often, the file path /usr/bin/vi is just a symbolic link to /usr/bin/vim, but Vim will notice if you entered the command vi instead of vim and (unless you tell it not to) will set it's key bindings to be more similar to the original vi program, enabling some settings and disabling others to be as backward-compatible as possible.  Linux is a clone of UNIX, so many of the built-in commands were cloned as well. Although Emacs was the editor of choice for GNU/Linux (Emacs was invented by the founder of GNU, Dr. Richard Stallman), once Linux became popular it was only a matter of time before someone cloned Vi as well. There were a few clones, Vim became the most popular.  But what makes Vi unique is it's default key bindings and user interface. You can put Vi key bindings into almost anything text-related."
linux4noobs,3d2vmu,Ramin_HAL9001,2,Mon Jul 13 10:38:29 2015 UTC,"If you start Vi on a modern Linux system you'll get Vim running in comparability mode.

You press i to enter insert mode (there's one or two other keys that will do that, and move you the statrt/end of a line at once) and actually type something, press Esc to enter normal mode where you can run commands, things like find and replace. I like to think of vim as an editor with its own command line, it needs two modes to prevent running command when you meant to type and vice versa. You save your file with :w or :w newname and exit with :q or :q! to not save.   A simple tutorial using the vimtutor command."

Just to see how it's setup currently. https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/gg309170.aspx  I don't like how you label each partition.  PQService  System Reserved  eMachines   I would renames them where I can identified each one better.  An exclamation mark beside a partition means that GParted encountered a problem when reading the partition. With NTFS the most common problem is that Windows was not shut down properly and that the NTFS file system is in an inconsistent state. An inconsistent NTFS file system can be fixed often by just booting into Windows (Windows should automatically run ""chkdsk"" on the partition) and then using the menu option Start -> Shutdown. If that doesn't work, you can also run ""chkdsk /f /r"" on the drive letter for the partition from a Windows command prompt and then reboot into Windows twice.  What you are seeing is just an indication that this partition does not yet contain a filesystem. Right clicking on the line that shows the exclamation point in a red circle will bring up a context menu that allows selection of a filesystem to format the partition with.  I would assume eMachines has Windows install on it. System Reserved is your Master Boot Record. And PQService is your recovery partition. Find out for sure. Rename, unless you like how they are named currently.  If I'm right on your currently partition setup. Either shrink your eMachines partitions. To make room for Ubuntu. Or have Ubuntu set-up to do it for you.  Now, redo your Ubuntu USB flash drive. Reformatted your USB flash drive and reinstall Ubuntu Live back on to it.

linux4noobs,3d1w1p,Ran4,2,Sun Jul 12 21:16:43 2015 UTC,"well it depends if you have PHP running as an apache module or as a standalone FPM. If it's running as an apache module, you need to find out what service account your apache processes are running as. You can find this out via  ps aux | grep http ps aux | grep apache   One of those should return a few processes. I haven't used apache in a while but one of the processes will probably be running as root while the child processes (the one that do the work) will be running as another user, such as 'apache' or 'www-data' or whatever that specific version of apache felt like using that month. If you're running PHP standalone, you'll need to do the same steps above but you'll be looking for the service account that PHP is running as.  It's that user that needs write permissions to the config file(s) you're talking about. Let's say for example that it's running as the user 'www-data', it might be better to find out what groups that user belongs to and give that group permissions to the files.  groups www-data   Chances are, one of the groups that user is a member of will also be called 'apache' or 'www-data'. We'll assume that it's 'apache'.  Now go to where that config directory is located and run this  chgrp -Rv apache /var/www/html/ampache/config/ chmod g=rwx -R /var/www/html/ampache/config/   That will give the 'apache' group ownership and read/write/execute rights to that directory.    With all that being said, it sounds like it's complaining that php has TOO MUCH access and it's wanting you to make the config file non-writable  chmod 755 /var/www/ampache/config/ampache.cfg.php"

Ubuntu Gnome is using GDM as Login Manager and the newest version of Nautilus. Evolution is the default mail client. If you want to install themes and extensions you need the gnome-tweak tool. You could test Ubuntu Gnome in a VM (Virtual Machine). Install Virtualbox or/and the gnome-tweak tool from your software-center.   Hope that is helpful.

When I go to the extension website, it keeps saying it can't detect a running copy of GNOME on my system. Is the only way to get it to work is by installing Ubuntu GNOME?  EDIT: Seems Chrome/Chromium has dropped support for NAPI. That's why I can't get the extension to work. FireFox it is!"

My first experience was when I had to take out email addresses from a excel files and put them in a text file with python. Then i found that i could do that with grep in one single line. Then i took out the mht version of the excel and ran grep over it. It was fun! I hope you find it useful too! :)

Hard drives can die at any time and over the years i have seen them die on new os installs.    Perhaps due to the workout they get.    With that said you should be able to delete the C:  partition and remake one that is for linux.  Some distros will want a second swap partition.  i normally just use gparted to delete the partition to free up some 'unallocated' space then let the installer partition the space as it wants.

Edit:  IMHO using a secure browser (Firefox + NoScript + an adblock variant) and not running code you are unfamiliar with (random scripts, or something that says, do curl example.com/something.sh | sh, or unknown binaries) will remove a lot of the risk you are worried about preventing."
linux4noobs,3cvo2p,xenow,5,Sat Jul 11 05:08:29 2015 UTC,"Does an unencrypted boot partition (but everything else encrypted, such as an LVM on LUKS setup with an unencrypted boot partition) pose any security risks?     In itself it is not a security risk. It does not make your install more insecure than an unencrypted install.   But with an open boot partition one can always replace the kernel file with one that logs your password.  To prevent this you should set a BIOS password, so one can't easily start something from a USB or CD to access your data.   But even then someone could take out your drive and use it on another computer to replace the kernel file.   There are two ways to prevent/notice that:  SecureBoot, then your firmware won't load a modified kernel.   Or you but your /boot partition on another medium like a USB-Stick or sdcard. But then you have to look after your sdcard all the time. Otherwise it wouldn't make sense to separate it in the first place.   A bootloader password (GRUB) does make sense. Because you want to protect all components in the chain. But with uefi you can directly start the kernel, but that is another story.     I could not find a way to set up Secure Boot for Arch Linux ‚Ä¶    SecureBoot just verifies that the software it starts wasn't altered. At the moment there is no tool chain for arch to make the process of configuring SecureBoot comfortable, you have to do everything yourself. And i have yet to find a step to step howto.     I could not find a way to set up a form of mandatory access control such as AppArmor used in Ubuntu.    It makes sense on a desktop to. It is good to shield applications from each other.   But in most cases it is too much hassle for users. Fedora for Example uses SELinux and many people just deactivate it on their Desktop. Another problem is that the profiles for applications are not as good as they could be, but still better than nothing.   But on the other hand there is the philosophy security by complexity reduction. So you run less code you trust instead of more code that add complexity as well as security.   A MAC system like AppArmor makes sense if you don't trust your applications. If you only install applications your trust‚Ä¶ then it is not so much necessary.  But this doesn't mean that trustworthy applications don't have bugs and can't be taken over.     People say antivirus/anti-malware programs are not necessary because viruses/malware are quite rare on Linux. It seems odd to me that this is a justification for no forms of antivirus/anti-malware--is having one overkill or actually not necessary?    There is Linux Malware, but most of it is defunct. And the lone examples are always Trojans. An alert user is still the best protection against malware. Protection against Trojans is almost 99,999% of the time protection against known Trojans. And there are so few under Linux that it is REALLY hard to find one.   Except for targeted attacks, but there are no anti-malware products that protect against those.   Also Anti-Malware Software is a problem in itself, it has root right (also on windows) and is a very good target. See 10years of news about malware that uses anti-malware software to enter a system.     I currently have to enter 3 passwords, 1 for root user, 1 for normal user, and 1 for the encrypted drive.     Deactivate root and configure sudo. One password less.    Could I somehow have a setup that requires me to enter only one string of text to accomplish both while still have reasonable security? I doubt it, but might as well ask it anyway.   You could use automatic login for your user, but that only works at home.  Or you can configure LUKS to use a key file. That key file can be on a usb-stick or sdcard. Or you get a yubikey to unlock your LUKS drive.    What does a screen locker do and why do I need one?     It locks the session so you can leave your computer for 5 minutes without somebody else changing your wallpaper and do other funny stuff.     Why do I need to use sudo nano to edit things in the home directory for everything except dotfiles?    No you don't, except the files are own by root. Take a look at chown -R."

On Linux, the number of viruses, as far as I know is in the range of 10s. They are mostly the experimental sort, are well known and all are in practice ineffective or harmless on a standard setup (fully patched). An anti-virus would be redundant.      You are much better off keeping your system up to date regularly. No need for anti-virus/anti-malware.

If you used the following command you might have another problem:   sudo rnsapshot daily ; sudo shutdown -P now   The problem is that sudo only authenticates you for a period of time (default 15 Minutes) so if the process takes longer, the second sudo would wait for your input and the system would not shutdown.  Solution:     sudo sh -c ""rsnapshot daily ; shutdown -P now""   This opens a shell (sh) with root rights (because sudo).

Then run:     ./configure; make; make install   this tells you need some dependencies first. Since I'm a sane person I simply installed sdl and sdl_net package from my package manager (pacman) (this it sdl v1.2.x, not the sdl2)  If it's not available in your package manager then find it somewhere  and then you compile the game  ./configure   this will check if you have all dependencies  If success, then you run make to actually compile it  make   but I couldn't compile it, some erros with ints so I looked in arch aur, and there is maelstrom, so I looked at pkgbuild file (https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ma/maelstrom/PKGBUILD) to see how they compile it, and it seems they apply some patches. One of them is 64 bit fix, which seems to be needed  you can find the patches in this package  https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ma/maelstrom/maelstrom.tar.gz  so apply the 64bit patch, from the game source dir run:  patch -p0 < /path/to/file.patch   there is also scores.patch, no idea what it's for but maybe useful  then, again run  ./configure; make   finally, as root run make install  sudo make install   it will install the program in system, if you have the game already installed from package manager then you should uninstall it first, to avoid existing file conflicts  Finally you can launch it with  Maelstrom"

Word from one noob to another - I'm sure you do this but if you don't have a folder for bookmarks that are helpful with stuff you want to do to linux.  A few of mine are;    WineHQ  (great for running Windows programs on Linux) PlayOnLinux (Works with Wine to make virtual drives) Doing this will make it less likely for programs to conflict and crash, also if you ruin one you wont ruin them all. I made a tutorial (a terrible one lol) here on how to isntall World At War using both PlayOnLinux and Wine, if you watch the first couple of minutes it'll show you how to install both of these. Synaptic Package Manager Think of this as sort of like ""Ubuntu software centre"" but on crack; you can select multiple files for removal, upgrades, installations etc etc and it will do them all at the same time (instead of Ubuntus software centre where you do them individually) Use with caution! Gnome-Look Is also a pretty cool website; this is where making Ubuntu becomes yours - here you can download desktop and folder themes and here mouse themes (I link them individually because me being an idiot it took me a while to figure out which was the right themes to download lol). Ubuntu desktop guide when all else fails you can check out the Ubuntu desktop guide, or check the community help at AskUbuntu.com although be sure to search for your question first, either in Google or AskUbuntu as chances are, someone, somewhere has had the same problem.   Edit: Also, when you said    Look forward to learning more about Linux/Ubuntu on the way...just not this way >.>   Unfortunately for me at least and many others the only way to get used to Ubuntu/Linux is to break it and figure out how it works, it's why I'm still pretty useless with Linux lol.

Learned that the BIOS password is stored within the chip itself, encrypted, and cutting off all power won't reset it. Similar to how a SSD can store and encrypt its password if the owner ever decides to. Manufacturer claims they can't retrieve or reset it either due to encryption and the Internet is very suspicious of anyone asking ways to reset such password without proof of ownership and understandably so.   Therefore, I basically have to replace the entire board for a new one unless my brain can recall the password. Given this episode though, I had low expectation for my brain."

Getting in there with a vacuum hose and a can of compressed air is a good idea, but if you're hearing fan rattles the writing is on the wall - they have to be replaced. At least, that's always been my experience.  As a stop gap,you can peel the little sticker back on the hub of the fan and carefully put part of a drop of light mineral oil in there (that's how you lubricate the fans). Do NOT use sewing machine oil or any other organic oil (soybean comes up frequently): they'll get gummy due to the heat and then you'll be sorry. Very sorry."

linux4noobs,3cjcc2,jrhiggin,10,Wed Jul 8 14:44:20 2015 UTC,"I think this is most of the problem. I seldom use fancy search operators; 90% of effective searching is knowing what keywords are relevant to your problem.  (I do use Google Verbatim by default, because Google's default autocorrections are rage-inducing when combined with the OSS world's quirky application naming conventions. Yes, I did actually mean flask, not flash; thanks, Google.)  Something which I think is particularly a problem for Linux newcomers is the lack of experience in diagnosing which part of their system is responsible for an error: a specific application, or a specific distro, or an underlying library, or a kernel. So for example they'll search for a solution related to Ubuntu when actually the problem has nothing to do with Ubuntu specifically and a solution can be found in an Arch forum.  Searching for error messages is often informative -- but with the caveat that a novice user may not understand which parts of the error message are too specific and should be excluded from the search (e.g. their own username appearing in a file path).  There are no shortcuts for learning this stuff, unfortunately.  But it could be helpful if whenever someone in this forum provided an answer which they found by googling they were to show more of their working -- explaining how they selected the keywords to search for, how they decided which of the results were relevant, etc.."

A few I can write down from the top of my head:  1) Focus on keywords more than complete phrases. Adding things like ""the"", ""of"", ""how"" is unnecessary, and some unnecessary words may divert the results to something less useful.  2) Avoid ambiguous words or expressions. If a word could have multiple meanings (for example, ""driver"" - computers and cars both have drivers) use further terms to specify what you mean. Error codes help in this, as do using technical terms (that are unlikely to be used for anything else).  3) Often you have to keep ""refining"" your search. Didn't find anything useful? Change a little what you searched and try again. Sometimes you get results that are unrelated, so you add another word to filter more; sometimes you don't find anything, so you remove something to increase the likelihood of finding something.  4) With experience you kind of learn what sites to look for in the results - for computer related stuff, this often means forums where people answer similar questions or blogs with tutorials.   5) The most important thing is just going out there and doing it. It is the kind of stuff you can only learn by doing it (and failing often in the start)."

I don't use full sentences, or words like ""it"", for example, because it's common and not specific to my problem. Of course, always include ""linux"" and perhaps your distro too, but most importantly always all crucial words.  But the biggest problem is definitely giving up after only clicking a few results, and reading the snippets from the site to see if it's what you need. I regularly will go to the 2nd or 3rd page of results if I have to. Get good at scanning a page and don't read the whole one if you need to. Open up result links in a new tab so you can exit out of it fast and get back to the results page. It takes practice, but once you get the hang of it, if it's out there you'll find it."

I see a lot of ""my thing doesn't work, help me fix it."" This kind of question wouldn't possibly get you anything from Google. I think it's not so much not knowing how to do a web search, but more of knowing how to troubleshoot. Without knowing what's going wrong with your computer, you don't know what to find a resolution for. The way I usually search for a solution to a problem is to find some kind of error code and simply dump that into DuckDuckGo. When you find an article or forum post asking specifically about that error code, read through the comments and quite often you can either find a solution, a link to someone else who did find the solution, or someone saying it can't be resolved at this time. I guess it stems from the whole ""knowledge is power"" thing. The more information you have to feed into your web query, the better results you're going to get back."

However from a practical standpoint, whether it's an apple vs. broadcomm vs. HP device--that does not matter.   Since your LAN mac address is not exposed to the Internet, this makes zero difference 99.999% of the time, and for a typical home network user whose PC is behind a NAT firewall, this makes no difference whatsoever. Typically the only practical reason to override the burned-in mac address is to bypass a security control such as: the mac address that is assigned by an ISP to the router issued to the subscriber; in order to use a linux box instead, the linux device would need to spoof the burned in mac address of the router (and the router would be put on the shelf, as duplicate mac addresses won't work).

You've downloaded two good desktop distros, both have nice GUIs, on both you can change this ""desktop environment"" from Unity/Gnome3 to any number of others from KDE to i3. None of this is relevant to learning to support servers.  However, both of these two ""desktop"" OSs can have any of the classic server apps installed. So, install OpenSSH, Apache, etc and open up a terminal and start getting into the command-line. (A quick search of this subreddit will show plenty of suggestions for learning that)  PS: There are two main families of Linux used in business - Debian/Ubuntu and Fedora/RHEL/CentOS. The differences, on GUI-less servers, are pretty small but you'll see them in Ubuntu vs Fedora (apt vs dnf, different places to define networking, differing permissions to logs etc)."

By this logic, is almost not every question already been asked? I mean, look at this subreddit. There are a lot of the same and similar questions in which people could use to become knowledgeable in Linux. By following the rules set out by this piece we are going to see a serious drop in questions and activities.

You instead have to split them up like this:  find -name '*.aaf' -o -name '*.3gp' ...   The -o is just an ""or"" operator so you get all results that match ANY of the patterns. You could also try searching for files above a certain size (I assume films will be the biggest files and all the stuff you want to delete are pictures or .nfo files or something, which are rather small). You could try something like this  find -size +1G -exec ...   to operate on all files above 1G.  For your second command, you would just exec rm without any arguments. But find has a builting delete command that can handle deletions, like this:  find -name 'sample.*' -delete   One last tip: Before you execute a potentially dangerous/destructive find command, strip the -exec or -delete bits to make a ""dry run"". This way, you see which files it would operate on, and can adapt your search patterns accordingly. For example, if you execute  find -size +1G   (no exec stuff) and see that it finds a lot of stuff you don't want to keep, you can raise the threshold without moving stuff you didn't intend to move."

linux4noobs,3cfou0,Linuxdirk,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:39:55 2015 UTC,thanks. so i set BIOS to boot from usb and just plug ext HD instead of usb stick?  i will get an ext HD and try windows on ext first and if doesnt work then go other way.  Is there somewhere i can go online for info on how?
linux4noobs,3cfou0,xalorous,2,Tue Jul 7 17:53:03 2015 UTC,Exactly. You need to install the boot loader on the external drive and configure it to load the system from the correct partition and that‚Äôs it for Linux.  For Windows: I don‚Äôt know.

If it's fat32 or ntfs it would just error out (I think.) I've never edited 'permissions' or 'owner' in Linux and I'm assuming it wouldn't work. Which is why the next step would be reformatting and attempting to mount. If there's errors there it's something with the way VirtualBox is handing over the drive to the vm.

Essentially, (I'll warn you now that I've never installed Ubuntu/Mint without automatic partitioning so be careful with this):   Find your drive letter eg. /dev/sdc (could be b or d or ... at the end; a is probably your hard drive, don't touch it) Wipe the drive and create a sing ext4 partition taking up the whole drive. When installing you'll see a list of options such as install Ubuntu or install Ubuntu beside windows. Click on ""something else"" Select your partition, /dev/sdc1 if c is your letter. Mount \ there; format if required. Make sure all the partitions the installer is going to create have the same letter and that that letter is the correct drive.   It may want you to have a separate /boot in which case create a 500MB partition at the head of the drive and a second one taking up the rest of the space. In this case format /dev/sdc1 as fat32 and /dev/sdc2 as ext4 putting / on /dev/sdc2 and /boot on /dev/sdc1.  Edit: from the link it appears you have to select where the boot loader goes.

Afaik both Chrome and Steam set up their own PPA to provide updates.     Regarding PPA lists:   The German Ubuntu wiki showcases this interesting (but old) anecdote as lesson to be careful with your PPAs:  google translate link  Basically someone made a small, privately-hosted PPA intended for beta testing with a small usergroup.  Some bloger picked up his PPA link and added it to his list of ""recommended must have"" PPAs. The resulting load more or less ddos'ed his homeserver.

TW is a bit easier to install and configure, but Arch has a more active and larger community.  One command issued at the CLI on Tumbleweed ""sudo zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/games/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/ games"" will get you access to the ""Games"" repo. You can then use the GUI software manager in YaST or use Zypper from the CLI to install minetest 0.4.12, which is the latest version as of today.  http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/games/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/x86_64/ will let you see what else is in there. Keep in mind that there's more stuff in the base repos, and even more is available in the OBS, which can be searched from http://software.opensuse.org  All that said, you can also just keep doing what you are doing and adding PPA's to Ubuntu/Mint.

linux4noobs,3c3vsf,RadicalMelon,44,Sat Jul 4 14:55:42 2015 UTC,"It's not too confusing really.  You have basically 3 options for mainstream consumer grade video cards these days:   Intel NVidia AMD   Intel  Uses open source drivers that are included as part of the kernel in pretty much all Linux distros. This is the very best supported option for general use.  You can do some gaming on Intel video, but performance drops off pretty fast in the more demanding games.  It is amazing how many actually work well though, especially in the higher end/newer Intel cards.   If you have Intel video, there's really nothing you need to do... the video drivers will be installed by default and kept up to date by your preferred distro.  NVidia  Has both open source drivers and proprietary drivers.  The open source drivers are easily installed - most distros provide them by default if NVidia is detected during install.  The high end performance of the open source drivers for NVidia is dismal, but for basic desktop use they are absolutely fine.  If you want to do any gaming, you pretty much need to install the proprietary drivers.  The quality of the proprietary drivers from NVidia is really good (mostly).  If you're into gaming, this is the generally accepted option because virtually ALL games for Linux work, and work very well on NVidia. There are issues... but they are general ""gaming on Linux"" issues.  AMD  Has both open source drivers and proprietary drivers. The open source drivers are easily installed - most distros provide them by default if AMD is detected during install.  The high end performance of the open source drivers for AMD is surprisingly good, and constantly improving.  If you want to do any gaming, you can usually just use the open source drivers.  The quality of the proprietary drivers for AMD is... awful. They work, but they are a mess.  Pretty much all AMD users will tell you to use the open source drivers and forget about the Catalyst drivers.  Given that the open source drivers are decent, it's not a bad suggestion. :-)  Which is better?  That's hard to say.  If you're into gaming and you are not fanatical about using only open source software in Linux, then I'd highly recommend NVidia because, if a game will work on Linux, it WILL work on NVidia with the proprietary drivers... every time (assuming you don't have other issues unrelated to the drivers or the video card).  Whereas with AMD, even if the game is well supported, and works with NVidia, it can be hit and miss with AMD.  More hit, but there are misses and the occasional game that simply will not work on AMD.    Windows games that are known to work in Vanilla Wine, Crossover, or Play On Linux will work on NVidia, but are hit/miss on AMD with a few I've seen that are miss on AMD for various reasons... sometimes they only work with the Catalyst drivers, other times they flake out no matter what driver you use with AMD.  The Linus thing  The whole Linus comment thing was related to how NVidia works with... not not with... the open source community. It has little to do with you as an end user unless you're involved in the development side of Linux. I wouldn't base my hardware choice around the comments from Mr. Torvalds any more than I would base my hardware choices around comments made by Mr. Stallman.  They both have very valid points, but it's not really something you need to worry about right now."

linux4noobs,3c3vsf,jdblaich,3,Sat Jul 4 17:16:15 2015 UTC,Everything you said is correct.  Linus said fuck you to nvidia's lack of cooperation. Nvidia is now more forthcoming.
linux4noobs,3c3vsf,AiwendilH,3,Sat Jul 4 15:14:59 2015 UTC,"Nvidia: Mainly two drivers available. The opensource Nouvea drivers and the proprietary Nvidia drivers.  The opensource drivers are made by reverse engineering and guessing how the nvidia hardware works...they hardly get any support at all from nvidia. Nvidia hardly provide hardware specs or anything. The state of the opensource drivers reflects that very much...they are usable maybe for some light 2d work but hardly offer any advanced features. Running 3d games it out of question for those at the moment.  The proprietary drivers from nvidia on the other hand are top notch....but always go a bit their own ways. The openGL implementation is probably the best that exists but also goes far further than what the official openGL specs allow. This might help in some case to get a little bit better performance but a soon as you go there it will fail on openGL implementations that are spec conform. Also certain shared extensions are a bit neglected...things like xrandr, KMS, egl took always very long to make it in the drivers and even then is often not complete. But in terms of performance the proprietary nvidia drivers are the way to go...nothing comes even close. Also in terms of stability they are among the better drivers linux has to offer. Nvidia offers legacy drivers branches for older cards. Always again nvidia ""freezes"" a certain driver release and only adds bugfixes and keeps that driver series around for older cards. This way nvidia even offers drivers back to nvidia TNT cards.  Intel: For intel there exists exactly one driver...the opensource driver. It's official supported and worked on by intel, integrates in the kernel and all in all a pretty solid driver. It lacks the newest features sometimes though. Biggest problem with intel graphics for serious 3d work is that the hardware is just not powerful enough. From the driver side intel graphics probably offers the best user experience over all...the user basically has to do nothing at all..it just works.  AMD: A lot people will disagree with this...but generally AMD is just a huge clusterfuck. Same as nvidia, two different drivers...a opensource driver and a proprietary drivers from AMD.  Unlike nvidia AMD offers help for the opensource driver with manpower and documentation. So the opensource drivers are in a pretty good state. They support 2d and 3d. On the 3d end they don't support the latest features so you for sure won't get the performance your card theoretically can offer. Here you can get a pretty good overview what works. Overall...for desktop usage and light gaming these are the drivers you probably want to use. One problem is that they are very actively developed and if you want to stay ""state of the art"" with them you will have a lot of system maintenance to do. If that is not so important for you sticking with the version the distro provides will give you a pretty pleasant experience.  Now the clusterfuck part....the fglrx/catalyst drivers. Yeah...they are pretty bad. The openGL implementation of AMD is simply terrible. (that is not a linux thing..it's just as terrible in windows only most people never need openGL there). Legacy support is just as bad...every few years AMD just cut out all older cards and doesn't support them any more. The stability is...getting better but still not comparable to the other drivers (except Nouvea). AMD recently announced that those drivers are not meant for gaming at all and more for high grade customers and programs that work with openGL (CAD, modeling). The 2d performance is in most cases worse than of the open source drivers. But...and that is probably the only reason why those drivers get any attention at all...the 3d performance is better than in the opensource drivers and they support more features. They still don't even get close to what the hardware of the card could provide but for latests games they are often the only choice.   One more thing should be said about AMD...because it always comes up again. The state of the AMD drivers were never good. They were bad even when it was still ATI. When AMD bought ATI it got a little bit better for the opensource world. They started to help out with the open source drivers. And this even worked to some extend..the open source drivers are pretty good by now. But they are still not even close to be a match for the nvidia proprietary drivers. And the situation back then was very similar to how it is right now. AMD said they will help out with the open source drivers (and did!) and everyone was hoping that AMD card will finally become a valid alternative. Now...almost a decade later they are still not match for nvidia cards in linux. And history repeats itself...AMD again promises it will get better...they again announce that the open source driver will be a integral part of their strategy...only difference now is that nobody really beleives it any more. I don't want to guess what is going to happen...but I recommend taking the same caution with AMD cards as you would with buying pre-release games...there is no guarantee that the situation will improve.  Overall...if you want to support opensource, go with intel. AMD is the second best option there if you need a bit more power. Nvidia is terrible and deserved the ""Fuck you"".   If you want a pleasant user experience go with intel...second option being nvidia proprietary drivers. AMD open source drivers are okay but if you want to game expect a lot of tinkering with your system.  If you want performance you can choose between nvidia, nvidia and nvidia."
linux4noobs,3c3vsf,CalcProgrammer1,2,Sat Jul 4 15:52:59 2015 UTC,"Everyone else has said it pretty well.  Basically if you aren't gaming, you'll do well with pretty much any of the big three (Intel, AMD, nVidia) with both open or closed drivers.  If you are gaming, you can do light gaming with Intel but really you want to go for either AMD or nVidia.  The next step depends on how much you care about open source:  If you care heavily about open source (which I very much do on my Linux side) then you want to go with AMD.  Their open source drivers give the best open source driver+hardware experience on Linux.  They fully support power management, reclocking, video decoding, and OpenGL 3.3.  They also support native Direct3D 9 via the Gallium-Nine project for getting the most out of Wine gaming.  Unfortunately, performance isn't quite up to par with the Windows drivers and OpenGL 4.x features are not fully implemented.  CrossFire support is also lacking, so if you have a multi-card AMD setup you're best off sticking to Windows (as AMD's proprietary driver sucks so bad CrossFire can actually perform worse than single card with open drivers in Linux).  If you don't care about open source at all, go with nVidia.  Their proprietary driver is top notch and runs things just as well as their Windows driver and supports the full OpenGL API up to the latest version.  It lacks KMS (which means your text-mode terminals will be stuck at 640x480) and requires a bit more pain to install, but is generally not too difficult.  You'll have limitations on which kernel/X releases you can use, so if you're always running the development branch code this may not be the choice for you.  Also, anyone using nVidia should at least be aware of how anti-openness that company is.  They lock down the firmware on their newest cards with hardware-level encryption which prevents the reverse engineering and development of open source drivers.  I can not seriously recommend anything from them due to their absurdly horrible business practices, but I guess it's better than just not using Linux at all.  Personally I dual boot, use Linux for most non-gaming tasks and light gaming with AMD open source and then do serious gaming on Windows with my CrossFire setup.  Windows is proprietary and untrustworthy but for gaming that's fine.  I want my Linux side to have as much open source in its kernel- and privileged-level workings as possible."

I was given an r9 280x, a nearly top level gfx card when i got it. It was to replace my gtx560, a middle of the road card of a few years ago. The 280 is a beast, really nice, except, I've been playing Borderlands 2. This game is very obviously bent towards nVidia. The much, much better amd card does not perform as well as the older nvidia. So I switched back. So just keep in mind, you may find a game that has been linuxified, only to find out its also been nvidia'd."
linux4noobs,3c3vsf,SirDifferential,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:41:25 2015 UTC,"The comments have been good, but one point is missing: NVidia Optimus. For a few years now laptops have been made with two graphics cards, the Intel's integrated one and a dedicated one by NVidia. This was problematic for quite a while around 2009~, but nowdays this has largely been fixed by the bumblebee project. I'm using a laptop with optimus to run even OpenCL on the dedicated card and it works.  I've found out that Intel's drivers, especially for OpenGL, lag lightyears behind. In some cases on Debian I can't even launch some non-game GUI applications with the Intel card. The issue with Optimus is still that you pretty much still need to specify which programs to run on the dedicated card. A friend of mine said that on Gentoo the system automatically detects when to use the dedicated card, so development has been made."

In a terminal window just type fdisk -l to find the drive location you want to install to.  Then sudo dd bs=4M if=your-iso-file.iso of=/directory/found/using/fdisk.  What problem are you having with unetbootin? It won't open? Or does it spit out an error when you try to create a bootable USB?  If the second one is your issue then I would download gparted and remove all the partitions on your USB drive or do it via fdisk /directory/given/with/fdisk/command (usually something like fdisk /dev/sdb)  Edit: Clarified some information to prevent someone misunderstanding me and removing partitions on their hard drive.

You'll need to boot off of some Linux Live OS (install cd/usb) to fix grub and add Windows as a boot option. It's easy from the command line but you can use a GUI repair tool as well.

linux4noobs,3c23il,valgrid,5,Sat Jul 4 02:12:32 2015 UTC,"Do you know of a good tutorial for ext4 data recovery?   No, i don't.  Some things:  The worst enemies of data recovery are carelessness and impatientness!  First you read the whole manpage of ext4magic. For comfort and concentration i recommend printing the manpage on paper. When you really understood how the program works (e.g. you can specify the path of files to recover) then you continue. Take a piece of paper and write down the command you want to run.   Mount the filesystem as read only and have enough space free on another device. Look at the file structure and determine which path the lost files had.  Then run the ext4magic command. Do something interesting while you wait. Maybe take a walk, listen to a podcast, solve a Rubik's Cube, dye your dog yellow or read a magazine.  When the process finished take a careful look at the recovered data. Make notes what you miss and copy (not move) relevant data in a folder for reviewed files.   If you miss important files look at your notes and think if the command lacked some option or a path. Then if necessary rerun ext4magic with new paths or options.  If ext4magic does not help, then try testdisk.    So why do i recommend taking notes and use real paper? Well data recovery is serious business. If you loose important or much data it really needs some time to restore it and even then you can have a pretty messy restore (weird file names etc). If you only lost few semi-relevant files the process described by me is a bit too cumbersome and time consuming. But doing a good restore can take many hours or several days. Especially with broken file systems or media. Your problem is pretty easy but it never a bad idea to practice something carefully while the stakes are low. Or pay someone huge amounts of money to do it right for you."

I also don't consider rm to be poorly written; I simply have to be careful about what I am doing.  Proactive individual responsibility confers more advantage than paternalistic convenience and ""safety.""   Always explicitly specify the directory that rm should remove, in the command.  rm -v ""${PWD}""/file # This tells rm to only delete a file in the current directory.   If you want to be even safer, move the files you want to delete to /tmp first, and then use rm from there.   Always use rm's -v flag, to give you a record of what rm is doing.  This flag isn't supported on OpenBSD, but it is everywhere else. Don't use the -rf flags unless you have moved the directory tree to /tmp first. Don't use rm non-interactively.  (In a script) Never use rm as root.  Move the file to /tmp, change its' permissions to your non-priveleged user, and then delete it as said non-priveleged user.

Third, since you are using Play Linux which is a modern ubuntu derivative, it will be GRUB2, not Grub.   Grub2 will recognize the Windows partition and provide you an option to boot from it. At some point in the installation of Play Linux it will ask you where to install the bootloader, and you will choose to put it on the MBR of the  SSD.  (which will probably be called ""sda"".)  See   http://askubuntu.com/questions/184155/where-to-install-grub for more info.  Your SSD willl likely have at least 4 partitions: 1-a tiny windows system partition for Bitlocker and recovery; 2-the main Windows 7 partition; 3-the main Linux partition; 4-linux scratch space.  Your HDD needs at least 3 partitions for data storage, which can either be created added afterwards or during the installation process: 1-NTFS storage space for windows; 2-EXT4 storage space for Linux; and  3-FAT32 storage space for sharing between the OSes. I would make this less than 127 GB in size because Fat32 really doesn't work well with large partitions. (corruption is likely with big Fat32 partitions, and  Windows natively wont even let you make them bigger than 32Gb)  If you want, you can also mount your windows partition in linux using  NTFS-3G and your linux partition in windows using  Ext2Fsd.  I have done this without problems, long ago, but it is theoretically a risk.  perhaps there is someone else here who can provide more experienced guidance on using NTFS and Linux together in 2015.  IF you don't set the mountpoints for the partitioned HDD up during installation, you will have to add them to your fstab file later on linux side.  (so it might be easier to do it during the installation)"

My buddy has used Windows forever.  He has a comp sci degree.  He doesn't write programs, doesn't want to learn anything new, works on cars, and has a difficult time accepting that once you get down and dirty with any OS it takes time to learn and that you must adjust your thinking.  I tell him that Linux isn't Windows and was never intended to be a clone.  EDIT:  I've finally accomplished in getting him to use Linux.  He put his GF on Linux and 8 years ago we converted his GF's father to Linux, and he is building a new computer that he says he intends to use as Linux only.  It has been a rough road getting him to think differently.  If you just want to use Linux then no problem.  If you do some atypical things in Windows you likely will have some problems.  If you complain about them and get frustrated about that you are probably better suited to staying with Windows.

You have to install from a Debian repository instead. But this requires that particular software to be included in a Debian repository in the first place, not just be distributed as a standalone .deb package.  As user you tried to play by the rules. It did not work. Go to github and fill a bug report. Tell the author his install instructions for Debian don't work for you and provide this error message."

Some say that it helps you identifying malfunctioning/defective programs but to be honest: If it‚Äôs broken, it‚Äôs completely broken and not only in some parts.

Yes, it is VERY recommended, because it is a good security practice. When you install software packages from a repository in a working Linux system, usually they are cryptographically signed and the package manager handles that transparently for you. When you download an install iso image, you have to do that manually yourself, to make sure you did not get a broken or altered image."

linux4noobs,3byqjn,RegsStandup,3,Fri Jul 3 06:29:39 2015 UTC,"MX records are essentially pointers - they specify where your e-mail server is. MX records must point to another hostname/domain/subdomain which resolves to an A (or AAAA for IPv6) record. A records point to an IPv4 address. Here is what you need to do (I'm presuming you are using Namecheap's DNS servers): Login to Namecheap and pull up the domain. On the right hand bar, click All Host Records (under Host Management). Fill in the first row with the following (| indicates the next box): mail | <yourIP> | A | 1800 Now go to the bottom of the page and click User (Mail Server's Host Name Required). Then click I will specify my own MX records. Click save. Now a new set of boxes will appear in the mail area. Type the following in them: @ | mail.<yourdomain> | 10 | 1800 Then click save.  Basically what you are doing is defining (with the first set of boxes) that mail.<yourdomain> is a server located at the IP address <yourIP> Next, you are instructing any e-mail sent to <yourdomain> to be routed to the e-mail server located at mail.<yourdomain>"

The 10 in my case indicates the priority. You can set multiple MX records in your DNS and an email service will try to send the mail first to MX record 1 and keeps trying a higher option until it is sent or run out of MX records. So MX record 10 will be tried before MX record 20 etc. Then the address, which should just be the address of the server hosting your mail service. As you can see a domain name is also allowed so in case of an IP change you only have to change 1 record.    In my case I use the mail service provided by Microsoft, which was free back at the time.    Hope this helps.    Edit: another example that uses multiple MX records: http://i.imgur.com/7IZxjZk.png"
