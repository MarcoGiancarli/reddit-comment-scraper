janusVR,3e1p31,puzzled_ok,6,Tue Jul 21 07:30:12 2015 UTC,"You should make a room, then :P  A lot of the constraints come from the fact there's no establishied virtual reality web standards yet, a lot of people are individuals just learning the XML language (which is what the early internet consisted of). Right now, Janus as a company just consists of /u/jamesmccrae , and a lot of the content is made by community members. In the future, James will probably add support for better rendering, but a lot of his focus is on the architectural side of things. The program itself is written from the ground up in C++ rather than using existing engines like the Unity and Unreal Engine, so a lot of the groundwork you take for granted in most games isn't there yet.  Janus was born only about a year ago, so it still really is a test bed, but just like the early 2d internet had to grow organically, so does this one."
janusVR,3e1p31,dizzket,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:43:21 2015 UTC,It seems like it's quite possible to have better environments and models in JanusVR right now.  Do you think the lack of quality (as in polish) content is due to the community not having the tools or having the expertise?
janusVR,3e1p31,dizzket,2,Tue Jul 21 07:48:41 2015 UTC,That and the fact that a lot of community members are busy with jobs/school etc. :P There's no unified design language yet as well. Janus has some UI stuff it needs to improve on.
janusVR,3e1p31,captainbenis,2,Tue Jul 21 07:50:33 2015 UTC,Using baked lightmaps and custom shaders you could make some really amazing rooms. I think the quality of rooms looks very similar to the quality of new developers using unity. Janus developers have no way of monetizing their rooms at the moment so I'm guessing it's not economical to spend hundreds of hours optimizing their rooms the way a successful indie dev can.
janusVR,3e1p31,NXT_Aussie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:18:05 2015 UTC,"A lot of the stuff we have been working on is 'in confidence' - we have made lots of much better rooms, but we can't show anyone yet."

And it has to load/build in under 5 seconds - including the time to download all the assets."
janusVR,3e1p31,NXT_Aussie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:08:23 2015 UTC,25MB total for everything   Is that 25MB max. for a room?
janusVR,3e1p31,macromarco83,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:23:33 2015 UTC,"Yep - the whole room - as a general guide we try to stick to that - too long to load and no-one is interested. You can make a room as large as you want, FireFox has lots of rooms with 100MB textures (Mars stuff) - takes ages to load - nothing is pre-compiled remember, all done on the run."
janusVR,3e1p31,NXT_Aussie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:30:56 2015 UTC,It's the same as opening a website with a LOOOOT of stuff and large images on it or loading a large flash game

janusVR,3e1p31,captainbenis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:48:34 2015 UTC,"There can be methods to improve that. Compressing object files saves lots of room, so if Janus develops a packaging standard like .objz or .daez which is just all the objects and textures for that item compressed and can use it directly from a host then that'd be great.  From a designer's point of view, you also want your room to be low lag so having thousands of polygons floating around or not optimizing objects or displays can be problem for visitors. Dizzket's experiments of level of detail switchouts are great attempts at improving this."

janusVR,3e1p31,dizzket,2,Tue Jul 21 13:31:02 2015 UTC,I wonder whether support for dynamic lighting and shadows would be possible within janus.

janusVR,3e1p31,FireFoxG,2,Tue Jul 21 16:50:05 2015 UTC,"I think there's a few issues at play here.  One is the same reason the early internet looked like it did, people are still learning the tools and best practices.  To make a really polished room you need skills in 3d modeling, glsl shaders, js, Janus XML, maybe some server side coding ability if you want to generate code dynamically.  So very few people have all these pieces and there's limited documentation, tutorials, examples right now that are geared towards Janus development.  Then there are vr specific issues like maintaining a high consistent framerate, and special design considerations for vr.  I think the quality of the content will improve as new tools like the blender export add-on are adopted as well as additional tutorials, etc for those learning new skills themselves."
janusVR,3e1p31,Nukemarine,2,Tue Jul 21 15:52:19 2015 UTC,"Short answer... money.  Long answer.  Janus has the ability for every single room to have it's own lighting engine via GLSL.  It takes high end game studios years to perfect and optimize a lighting engine, then a few more years to model everything around that engine.  Literally years.  Then there is the consideration for download speeds, since this IS the internet.  Most people put a cap on room size around 10-50mb.    And most importantly, Frame rates.  If people can't hit 75-90fps with a gtx970, then it can induce VR sickness.  There is only one company right now that is doing triple A level graphics with frames rates that high... Elite Dangerous, and they have very little in terms of poly count detail (it's in space, not much out there), But the download is also 100+ GB.  It will be a while (year or 2) until we see websites in Janus that look like GTA5.    PS, this definitely is a test bed for the time being. Janus is and has been completely built, from the ground up, by a single person, (/u/JamesMcCrae), And all without a single dollar of funding.  IMO, It looks pretty freaking epic considering this is all user generated content.  The project is completely owning all other VR projects in it's funding class, and even some that have considerable funding... In both raw amount of content and the polish."
janusVR,3e1p31,qster123,2,Tue Jul 21 19:42:51 2015 UTC,"There's a few reasons:   Janus VR is a web browser meaning you need to download all the object files and textures in a reasonable time. 100mb objects look beautiful and life like but they take forever to download. Janus VR is sort of a ""game engine"" like UE4 and Unity, but its pretty much a one-man (James) operation though hopefully that part expands. The other game engines have larger teams but they're not dedicated with creating a 3D web browser. Hosting. Again, Janus is a web browser so people need to have a place to put the high quality content which isn't always available. Hopefully this improves and other techniques come about (distributed hosting for example). Limited talent in all the areas. As Janus gets popular, this changes. You'll start seeing groups made up of programmers, server experts, artists, musicians and designers team up on a project that makes for a cool vr website.   If it helps, think of Janus VR 3D browser like a the 2D web browsers 20 years ago. Compare the 2D web now to then and it not just the graphics, but everything that improved. Likewise, it'll take time to figure out the best way to offer VR content over the web."

janusVR,3e131b,NXT_Aussie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:02:46 2015 UTC,This is fucking genius. You could load and simulate rooms in the multiplayer server and play games that only you and your friends could join.
janusVR,3e131b,captainbenis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:07:29 2015 UTC,"I've mentioned this to James before and he says it's doable. Basically, have a ""channel code"" which is used for generating the URL hash. As long as all your friends have the same code then you only see each other. Pretty simple really since that's how he keeps people in the same 9 digit positions but different URLs from seeing each other.  It can also be done on the server side but that might take a bit of work since you should be registered with the server. That could be useful as instead of sending player data to everyone it's just to people in your channel.   This would be useful for certain events where you want multiplayer capability but don't want anyone and everyone being visible."

I've also never tried putting the room code inside a frame, I don't think that would work unless you provide the direct link to the frame's own html file.

janusVR,3dlblm,7373737373,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:30:13 2015 UTC,"If IPFS is used and the room is addressed by a standard multihash, the only way to update the room would be using javascript (as the original source is content addressed and immutable). However, if IPNS names are used, we could automatically poll for updates - as soon as multiple names per peer instance can be published I will update the addon (I added the UI already). In that case the last published update of your room can be found under: hash(yourpubkey)/path/to/room The IPFS devs are also planning to create a pub/sub mechanism we could integrate."

In most cases, your files won't even leave your computer, unless there is a huge demand for your room - in that case the bitswap protocol kicks in.   I'm not sure if JanusVR needs a server at all, and even if, I might consider starting Python's SimpleHTTPServer as a module in the directory.

janusVR,3dh3er,aLuzh3n,2,Thu Jul 16 05:41:00 2015 UTC,"To give you the quick explanation on UVs: consider a single triangle of the cube.  You understand that the endpoints of the triangle are defined in 3D.  For each endpoint, you can also define a UV point which is defined in 2D.  This set of 3 2D points defines what triangular-shaped region of a separate texture (in 2D, ranges between 0 and 1) will be sampled, and how the triangle will be shaded.  Thus, for the two triangles defining the ""front"" face of the cube, you want to choose these 2D UV points for each endpoint such that they sample the entire websurface (really just like any other texture), i.e. the 4 corners of the front face will each have one of the UV positions (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,0)."

janusVR,3dh3er,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:47:51 2015 UTC,"It is all about choosing the right UV parameterization for your cube, and then just using a websurface_id corresponding to an AssetWebSurface on it, as usual in the markup.  If you want the cube that has the exact parameterization used natively in Janus, use /assets/primitives/cube.obj.  In fact, because the primitives are available by default in each Room, you can just create an Object with id ""cube"" and it will automatically be linked to this built-in primitive.

I think ideally you reuse the existing ""chat"" method.  Add an additional (optional) attribute ""toUserId"", which means the chat message is meant for that specific user.  For the recipient's ""user-chat"" event, we could leave it unmodified, but then it would be impossible for the client to differentiate between a message sent publicly or privately.  Thus we should also include the same ""toUserId"" attribute as well (which will generally be the same as the userId of the user who gets the message, but the existence of this tells us that it was a private and not public message.  (I would have just used ""userId"" instead of ""toUserId"", but this attribute is already used to identify the sender of the chat message.)  I'm open to suggestions on how to further improve the above."

So I decided I'd just go with 5566 and leave it unencrypted, but now Janus always wants to connect via ssl and so it won't.  The only way I've been able to get it to work is by deallocating/reallocating the room, then it will finally try non-ssl and it works fine.

I am actually thinking to contact these guys who do Mumble, and ask if there's a way I may be able to more-tightly integrate Janus with that, and remove the need to run the separate Mumble client.  It would also be good to have channels that are based on the current URL, so that conversations, as in reality, remain in the room.  I've liked my experiences coding for Mumble so far.  Edit: you've reminded me about someone in my lab who does audio processing stuff, for the purposes of synchronizing facial animation to it.  The approach is semi-real time.  Maybe I'll drop him an email now."

I installed it with the default settings, maybe it'll work now?  EDIT: Nope. No luck.

janusVR,3bw0hi,gunpigEW,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:21:53 2015 UTC,"Also, I would like to note that hand_pos is located around the head area of the player. I was under the impression that it was the palm.  So when setting an object to the hand location, you never see the object until you release control and look around/up at it.  This also somewhat affects the direction of the hand, as it's never truly accurate as to where your hand is actually pointing towards. So when trying to use the hand direction in place of individual finger direction, it's pretty off."

janusVR,3buaqa,harenae,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:34:20 2015 UTC,I'm not having the same problem. Could you try what aussie has suggested. Otherwise would you mind providing more details about your setup? What hardware are you running? What peripherals do you have plugged in? How many monitors do you have? Are you using a rift? That sort of thing :)
janusVR,3buaqa,MrM0bius,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:18:08 2015 UTC,"No rift, one monitor, and what do you mean by hardware? 4gb ram with an AMD A6 processor, if that's what you mean.

If an expansive plugin does great stuff and takes a lot of time and effort to develop, I have no problem with a dev charging for their work.  If someone thinks that's an excessive cost, then they are still free to develop something similar themselves."
janusVR,3bnuqg,MrM0bius,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:59:44 2015 UTC,"I agree, allowing profit off of plugins could allow people to make a living off of it, and developers would have more resources to put into development."

janusVR,3bnuqg,FireFoxG,3,Tue Jun 30 20:34:56 2015 UTC,What are some examples of plugins that could be created?
janusVR,3bnuqg,qster123,2,Tue Jun 30 19:59:46 2015 UTC,"Role playing plug-in: Server controls the avatars, javascript and even HTML (via #sync) to create a fully controlled RPG world on specific websites. These could be either ""Metaverse"" style or ""Ready Player One OASIS"" style or whatever.  Activity Recording Plug-in: Think ""ghost recording"" on steroids where the server records all activity during a set time. It'll replay this activity as needed. For example, a website wants to always show the previous 12 hours of activity to the new visitors. Another reason could be for recording a play or Machinima video. Yet another is recording a special event.  Friends List Plug-in: Lets users choose who can see them, limitations on avatars, muting options, etc.  Site Translation Plug-in: Register and the server will #sync non-Janus websites that have popular translations created for them. Could also contain different flavors.  Seriously, there are nearly unlimited ideas when it comes to how servers can improve the ""Multiplayer Metaverse"" aspect of Janus VR in addition to interacting with the web. Everything is going over the servers and that allows for some cool interfaces that don't require James to make changes to Janus. Even more, some plug-ins could allow direct communication with other social VR applications. Again, Janus need not get involved.  Janus VR - a closed source browser operating with an open source multi-player server that allows closed source plug-ins. Sounds like an amazing approach."

This object would be a picture of a message box, and when you hovered over it, you'd see a comment left by a user.   When a user walks into a room, the server would ""inject"" these comments by ""synching"" the user with the contents of the database for that room."

I don't know why we should consider it, so would love to hear your thoughts on this one in particular and how it compares to the ones we have considered already."
janusVR,3bnuqg,timschwartz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:01:33 2015 UTC,"Here's the difference, as I understand it. With the GPL, if someone modifies your code and distributes it, then whomever receives a copy has the right to copy, modify, or distribute it. But if someone modifies the code, and only runs it on their own servers, (without distributing the program to others), there's no requirement for them to make the modified source code available, not even to the users who connect to the server. So for example, some large corporation could take the server code, make a bunch of improvements to it, and run it on their own servers, without having to distribute their improvements as source code.  Affero GPL adds an additional requirement, that the users who connect to the server, must have access to the modified source code that is running on the server. In effect it closes that loophole where someone could benefit from the project's license, without passing that benefit on to their users."
janusVR,3bnuqg,captainbenis,2,Wed Jul 1 00:55:34 2015 UTC,"Ok. I'm actually okay with someone taking this and modifying it on their own server and not contributing those changes back if they don't want to do so. I see no scenario in which I think it would be okay to demand they make their code available.  However, if distributing it, then I think it's good for everyone to see what those changes actually are so they can make informed decisions as to whether they should actually use it or not."

janusVR,3bnuqg,MrM0bius,2,Wed Jul 1 06:50:26 2015 UTC,"I vote LGPL2.1, I think a forced open-source requirement for plugins might discourage companies from developing software for the platform."
janusVR,3bnuqg,MrM0bius,3,Wed Jul 1 07:34:21 2015 UTC,"All of scene is MIT licensed because it gives people the most freedom of what to do with it, that's what I'd recommend."
janusVR,3bnuqg,eVRydayVR,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:33:00 2015 UTC,"The argument for GPL would be that we would be fostering an open source community of plugins/mods where everyone could help each other build better things and ensures collaboration. You could still sell your plugins if you want, but others could also distribute them after you sell them. Most likely people would end up charging for their time to build something rather than sell the same piece of software over and over again. Personally I think this is a better model and has the advantage when it comes to ensuring quality and security through transparency.  My vote is for GPL3."

I don't typically bookmark websites I've not gone to yet. As for the information idea- I like where you're going with it. Like you said- it might be tricky putting some kind of interactivity above a door. Maybe it should fly out from one side or the other or something like that.

If you're using Youtube on mobile it will get portions of the video depending on the size of the video, I think that would also mean if the video is paused it will stop downloading and that particular spot, which I don't think Janus does.

janusVR,3bdi1e,FireFoxG,2,Sun Jun 28 09:44:59 2015 UTC,"If you can figure out how to implement ambisonics encoding/decoding in Qt then yeah that would be awesome.  I think part of the issue now is that Janus just throws everything to your local codecs for processing and doesn't really micro manage anything at this point.  As an audio guy I'm totally in agreement that we're going to need some progress on that front.  If you're recording live, straight to ambisonics that's like a MS setup, but with an extra figure 8 mic for top/bottom, correct?  So an omni channel and  L/R T/B mono channels (with the secondary channel out of phase on each).  Is that the way the encoded format is structured as well?"
janusVR,3bdi1e,MrM0bius,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:03:48 2015 UTC,"You have the idea yeah. Take a look at the Soundfield Microphone. The figure 8s are arranged in a tetrahedron. You can encode to ambisonics using other 3D microphone arrangements though, encode from recorded material in other formats (typically with dimension loss, e.g. 5.1 -> ambisonics where there is no z-axis) and you can encode to it from a number of different signals (say, stereo and mono) which is what I'd propose.  Failing that, it is possible to build a simple stereo version similar to the compromise I made for my website. It really only gives you left/right and a sense of relative distance, but it's easy to do.  What's Oculus doing? I would have assumed they'd have some binaural sound implementation."
janusVR,3bdi1e,MrM0bius,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:56:44 2015 UTC,"yeah oculus is doing the realspace plugin for unity and ue4, but I don't know if it is otherwise opened up in the sdk, such that non-unity ue4 apps can access it.  AFIK realspace is just FFTs and time domain transforms reconstructed to a create a binaural soundfield, I've heard it sounds pretty good though.  I really like the idea of the Ambisonics B implementation though, again reconstructed to a pseudo binaural config (since headphones are the target).  Are Z axis transforms still audibly apparent (via eq shifts, etc) when you mix down to binaural from ambisonics?  Or would you need to write an algorithm to fake that separate from the typical ambisonics stuff?"

janusVR,3b8zmb,NXT_Aussie,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:53:10 2015 UTC,"To clarify, He's asking if we could associate .obj and .dae files with janus.exe , so you just click the mesh files on windows and it opens Janus directly to that object file.  Kinda like if you open an html file, it will open your web browser to view it.  Edit;  If you associate Janus with a filetype, it kinda works but the pathing is screwed up because it's not XML encoded.  When you associate, it starts you in a room path like this.   c:%5CJANUS%5Capollo17.obj   when it should be   file:///C:/JANUS/apollo17.obj   James, If you figure out a way to make janus read the top filepath via command line, then Janus could directly open any file that are associated, including HTML filetypes."
janusVR,3b8zmb,FireFoxG,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:38:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's not an essential function, but would make it easier to open local files or webpages without having to copy the address and file name."

You don't know how much I appreciate this :D  I'm Dizzket, and my experience with Janus ranges from The Dot Matrix , to The Wikiverse at Usagii.net , as well as doing a lot of random spur of the moment conceptual work. I stumbled across Janus around February of 2014, and I've been making demos for it ever since.  Currently, I don't have a rift, and I've not even tried one (embarrassed to say so after having worked with Janus for this long.)  The main obstacle between me and a rift has been, well.. I'm 19, and just getting my financial footing in the world, and I've been saving most of my money for bills and college.  Thanks!"

Some of the most notiable being My Wolf3D room and My apartment.  Ive also helped with leap motion integration, and have always been interested in where consumer VR is going.

Qt itself doesn't support this, but I may be able to use existing libraries to support that like http://www.openldap.org/  But if it's only used as a means of authentication that might be overkill, I can read about it and if it's not too complex just implement that part directly in the client.  Also, /u/macromarco83 cooked up a separate solution for authentication, that I've been meaning to get around to implementing."
janusVR,3b61e4,JamesMcCrae,3,Fri Jun 26 07:41:55 2015 UTC,"Qt itself doesn't support this   Well, all it needs is a password field:  {""method"":""logon"",""data"":{""userId"":""ProudMinna333"", ""password"":""blahblah"", ""version"":""40.3"",""roomId"":""e562b2e1339fc08d635d28481121857c""}}   The server will query the ldap server and accept or reject the client based on the result.

janusVR,3b61e4,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:01:06 2015 UTC,"yes, it's there, but I've removed the test users"
janusVR,3b61e4,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:01:39 2015 UTC,"So I have gotten to work on this, and encountered a potential issue.  The issue is that the server does not ever send a message back to prompt for a password, which means that technically the client is unaware that entering a password is ever required.  Instead, the server closes the connection if it's expecting a password and none (or the wrong one) was supplied.  It would be possible for Janus to prompt for a password at this point, but this is a huge assumption - the connection was closed by the server because of a password problem.  I would like to avoid assuming this, and have something in the protocol for this.  On the other hand, it would be possible for people running Janus to manage the user/pass lists manually (i.e. some submenu where people can enter the server, username, and password they would like for each server they connect to).  But this would not make using Janus easy by any means - e.g. a new user heads to a new room, which connects to a new server requiring authentication, which doesn't work.  The user of the client may have no idea why - they would be expected to know to go into the menu settings and add this specific server/username/password to the list.    If the server replied on logon with e.g. ""method: password"" - some kind of message back from server to client like that - then I am certain that a password is needed, and I could add in some UI prompt into the Janus client to deal with that.  If there is already some means by which the server signals to the client that a password is necessary, let me know.    Otherwise, I would propose the following:  In the event of no password supplied, after processing the client's logon packet, server replies this (excuse the improper formatting):  method: error, data:{message: Password required}   In the event a password is supplied, but it's wrong:  method: error, data:{message: Password incorrect}   I think having separate messages from the server for each of these two cases will be additionally helpful from the client's perspective (as these messages from the server can be displayed to the client in Janus)  I am also interested in any suggested improvements you may have to the above.  Emphasis on simple, intuitive, and minimal."

janusVR,3b61e4,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:10:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe the server could instead send a list of methods it supports, then the client could decide whether it should notify the user.

Reversed text (white text on black) is notoriously more difficult to read than black on white. Also an issue I have with this is that it doesn't appear very HUD-like. When I enter a menu of sorts in VR, it should look like a menu- not a physical object. If this menu popped up in front of me, it would look like part of the world, not like a layer on top of the world that only I can see. So- this looks a bit more like a web design than a VR interface. My $0.02."

janusVR,3b4221,solidwhetstone,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:58:58 2015 UTC,"To build a UI in VR, you're going to need a VR headset. Otherwise you won't be able to test your work. There are a lot of things that seem like they should work when looked at on a desktop monitor but when you see them in VR they look strange/unreadable. While your design here looks nicer on a desktop monitor, the direction James is headed with the semi-transparent large buttons will probably be a more usable solution in VR. Think big buttons, icons, 3D space. One of the things I plan to work on is trying to establish design patterns that can be used across all interfaces that involve menus or settings- and there is already sort of a paradigm that exists in scifi to have semi-transparent blue interfaces (see minority report, star wars, etc.). These kinds of interfaces are different enough from real life- and they are remind us of the holographic interfaces of the movies.  All of that said- I can't reiterate it enough- if you're going to build interfaces in VR, you need a DK2. Going without is a bit like building for the desktop from a mobile browser."
janusVR,3b4221,Nukemarine,3,Fri Jun 26 02:07:04 2015 UTC,"Most of my concepts are meant to toy around with specific ideas rather than to serve as any sort of draft, and this one was created to experiment with the idea of unifying the browser with the menu.  I do agree that I need a VR headset (and I'm a bit ashamed that I've been developing for Janus for the past year and a half without one).  I think that elements from movies being carried over into a virtual interface is a good idea, as long as they're practical. Although it seems like VR would be the perfect medium for skeuomorphism, I feel that we'll develop abstract ways of handling information that don't reference the real world in any direct way. The only difference is that we have another dimension to work with. For instance, turning your downloads folder into a giant room full of doors leading to different files only further complicates reaching the information. Turning the folder into a filing cabinet that you use with your hands is neat, and it gives the user a sense of what exactly they're working with, but are there more efficient ways of navigating files than using your fingers to flip between physical folders? Will the action you're performing fatigue your hands? And if the user lacks the necessary hardware and has to use the system built for hand tracking with their mouse, it'd feel a bit like trying to control a mouse cursor with a gamepad.   I think one of the most important things for VR design is keeping all information unoccluded, whether it be by other geometry, the angle it's displayed at, or the way that it's organised.  I'm still not sure what the solutions are for these problems, and I think it's something everyone has been working to try to figure out.  I also think that whatever interface is created will need to function well on a 2D monitor, because a large amount of traffic comes from people without any sort of HMD, and that will continue to be an obstacle."

It's great to get some critique and alternative viewpoints on stuff, because that's how great things are made."
janusVR,3b4221,solidwhetstone,3,Fri Jun 26 04:27:13 2015 UTC,"Dizzket has been making VR content for over a year. While he doesn't have a headset due to financial issues, he does get feedback from those that do have headsets and makes some pretty compelling content. FireFoxG is another user that did similar content without using a HMD for the longest time.  For UI, yes again, a headset helps. However, anyone can close their eyes and visualize a 3D space with the interface wrapping around. I've done that myself plenty of times (whether the imaginary translates well into the virtual is another story, but sometimes there is success).  Personally, I appreciated the more solid looking menu from last year. Instead of a floating HUD, it was a ""button room"" you called into existence and could walk around. Solid looking menus offer problems with regards to text placement, but I find it more compelling than thin floating HUDs."
janusVR,3b4221,MrM0bius,2,Fri Jun 26 03:48:09 2015 UTC,"I can see based on the voting that people in this thread don't like my input! :D  I think if Dizzket needs an HMD maybe we should all pitch in to try to get him one. I'd be willing to throw down $50.   For UI, yes again, a headset helps   No, it's essential. Visual design isn't enough- usability is the key. And the way to build a good interface is to design, test, design, test.    Personally, I appreciated the more solid looking menu from last year   I know that's your personal preference, but the problem with a solid menu that sits in the world is that users can't tell if other users can see their menu. On the desktop- a solid menu always works. It just always does. But in VR, a solid menu can seem like part of the world. A VR menu has to look different enough from the rest of the world- it has to be HUD-like in some way (doesn't HAVE to be the way I described above, but it does need to be HUD-like).    Instead of a floating HUD, it was a ""button room"" you called into existence and could walk around.   The thing about a menu is that it should be usable no matter where you are without having to leave your experience. Forcing the user to enter a separate room to make settings changes is poor usability.  Please don't take my comments to Dizz as me shitting on his design, I'm not. As a web design- it's nice. But it would need to be tested in VR on a number of users. That's all I'm saying."
janusVR,3b4221,solidwhetstone,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:14:06 2015 UTC,"If you read my posts you'll see I don't like to use binary language. As Dizzket and FireFoxG has shown their ability to make compelling VR experiences even without HMDs made me back off the idea that their essential. However, both guys will agree they'd prefer to use an HMD, but I would not say ""No more ideas from you until an HMD"" to those two as they've shown they know what they're doing.  That said, hmm, a business plan to get Dizzket a DK2 so he can save for the CV1 might be a good idea. I'll be down for $50 as well.  For the menu issue, I've had experience with the HUD and I've seen what Janus and Time Rifters have done with solid menu interfaces. The solid ones seemed cooler. With Janus, you don't have to move around them, but you can (many have not realized that yet).  The ""button room"" was not a separate room. It was the menu of buttons that popped in front of you when you pressed ESC. I get that made menu labels a bit more limiting than the form they take now. However, they were cool and I miss them. I also think that in a VR setting they were functional. They formed around you and seemed like a HUD, however it turned out if you moved they stayed in place. That said, one did have to enter the ""bookmarks"" and ""workspace"" rooms that could be tedious and has been improved with the current UI having it accessible with button presses."
janusVR,3b1u8g,dizzket,3,Thu Jun 25 07:54:42 2015 UTC,"Did a bookmarks concept inspired by /u/crusaderofman .  How it works is that Janus saves out the thumbnails into a bookmarks folder, and correlates them with the urls.  Each fireboxroom can have a description correlated with it.  There's also a server saved out when a room is bookmarked, and Janus checks it to see how many people are online.  This can help people find each other.  What would happen is when you open up Janus, you start in a blank white room, and you see this bookmarks area. This would help people quickly navigate to the most populated parts of Janus.  Sometimes people don't want to go for a walk to find their destination. A 2D UI to get around would help massively with exploration, and encourage people to move more."

This would greatly improve connectivity between users as well and could later serve as a form of security, only letting you connect to the servers you've approved via the bookmarks. Connecting to a new host server would give you a warning about going to an unknown place, accept or deny content from the author."

I think it is extremely important, so let me explain:  The menus look a lot cleaner now, so that's an awesome step in the right direction. Unfortunately, there are more ease of access issues than just menus. I don't want us to simply declare victory and move on.  We recently had a thread about some of the in-world navigational issues. That is another major component to the ease-of-access issues. That is also where Second Life made some of its major mistakes. JanusVR needs to be as easy to use as any other modern VR application.  I know we can do it. I really want to see us continue down the usability path and not move on after making some great progress in one area.

I think many of us have struggled to understand this component, but have never come up with a sound solution or plan of action to help narrow this gap.   What kind of flaws do you see in the navigation and how do we attempt to make them friendlier? By navigation are you referring to the portal system? Personally I think we need some sort of map to help people figure out what is it that you can do in a 3D web browser, and how do you get to the experience you like. /u/dizzket came up with an exceptional concept of a ""Neural Map"" that could be helpful if implemented.  I'm 100% behind you, though. We need to improve ease of access outside of UI elements."

Visual cue when mouse and keyboard are grabbed by surface and player is immobilised   I'll defer to those with more expertise with user interfaces (such as the two volunteers in this thread) on how to solve them.  The other big thing I suggested was simplified navigation/selection scheme for everyday users. They really need a dead-obvious and simple interface that is not burdened by the complexity required by content creators.   I probably could have made it more dramatic, but here was my experience with clicking on things and all sorts of weird unpredictable things happening.  Losing control of the interface because you clicked on something that was created through a back-end technological distinction that you didn't know about (a websurface) is an example of a bad experience that needs to be avoided."

It might look weird but it prevents cases where the environment completely blocks the menu If not in flight mode, menu's height is same as avatar. You'll notice this in rooms where you fall on entrance. Important should Flight mode get disabled. From mumble: For Bookmarks have either a ""Next Page/Prev Page"" button and display 10 bookmarks (one person had a tall stack of 22 bookmarks). Another idea is put stacks of 10 with stacks filling up around the player along a curve (right side of stack, then left side of stack, then 2 stacks to the right, then 2 stacks to the left). Webviews - Great that we can have multiple pages. In the future I'm sure we'll be able to resize, position and orient making it a very important menu page. Until then, I recommend instead of a straight line, the extra windows circle around the user like the IMGUR room. More windows mean a more large circle.   Again, great job on this.

But it better be the best avatar out there.  As many bells and whistles as possible.   Convenient (more convenient then ripping a model and making it myself) I need to be able to change quickly   However, I think we're still looking at a few months to a year before it's common to purchase an avatar."
janusVR,3atsdi,konchok,3,Tue Jun 23 13:59:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm, Personally I think this is the wrong demographic here for this question. I think we should just go for it, but for ones similar to the ones in the voxel rooms we should change the minimum possible, like $0.50 or something - sent you a render too with your avatar, adds a bit more value than just having a new avatar - Edit. Could even get them 3D printed =)"
janusVR,3atsdi,qster123,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:03:39 2015 UTC,'Send us a photo of you and a 150 word bio about yourself and have a custom pixel avatar built that is personal to you'  This sort of thing could really work. Add a fancy render with themed background in line with the hobbies or interests expressed in the 150 words. Add the ability to have a 3D printed version sent directly to your home using a third party service. This makes it more like you are buying a piece of interactive art that is bespoke to you. I'd buy one :)   As demand increases you could give commission to modellers to make the avatars on a case by case basis. And commission to artists to draw the avatars in fancy poses in the style of poster art.
janusVR,3atsdi,Lewis_P,2,Tue Jun 23 16:52:08 2015 UTC,"That is a tricky question. I'm not sure I would buy avatars to be honest but I don't know whether that's just because I am capable of making them myself. Perhaps if they were sold as big packs of unique and interesting characters for $5 or something then maybe. Maybe if there was a way to make them exclusive somehow?  A tool that could come with a bunch of preset avatars to choice from and the ability to chop and change components may work. You could add value through consistent free expansions containing additional components in response to requests from the community (capes, hats, shields, weapons, faces, shoes, etc.) You'd have to think carefully about the pricing structure. If it can form a tool that will generate avatars that can be used in any context (if it can just export objs for example) that would certainly warrant a higher price than a janusVR exclusive tool but I still think you'd likely struggle to sell it for more than $5. Also worth considering existing software when thinking about the feature set and pricing structure. Here are some existing examples I was able to find:   Adobe Mixamo (which appears to have a free/pro pricing structure) Autodesks Character Creator (also has free and premium packages) Make human (completely free I think) Daz 3D (similiar to make human)   EDIT:  To answer your question directly:   So would you buy an avatar?    I don't think so. I may be more inclined to buy a pack of 100 avatars, but I doubt I would ever buy a single avatar.  Also of note is whether the avatar will be rigged and things."
janusVR,3atsdi,Lewis_P,2,Tue Jun 23 13:59:25 2015 UTC,"Hmm, as someone who as invested the time into being able to create for Janus, I don't know that I personally would pay for avatars.  However, when the general consumer market opens up, I think there will certainly be some sort of market for avatars.  As long as they are priced reasonably, maybe around $2-3 for premade, non-exclusive avatars (or to build one with a mix/match tool).  Considerably more for custom, exclusive avatars.  While I don't generally go for the Janus/Second Life comparisons, as far as avatars go, established markets like that may provide good guidance for pricing and user tastes."
janusVR,3atsdi,MrM0bius,2,Tue Jun 23 15:34:51 2015 UTC,I wouldnt.   It doesnt really add to my experience I kind of like seeing crazy custom avatars of other users though.
janusVR,3atsdi,Im_not_lonely,2,Tue Jun 23 18:28:18 2015 UTC,"While it's early to use this as a revenue generator, the security you'll create around the servers to handle this will be very useful.   The security method though is the interesting question. Currently, it is set up that anyone that knows the URL to the avatar can then use that URL for their own avatar. As mentioned, people with a JSON sniffer could tell what your avatar HTML is when using Janus.   One way around that involves James changing the transmitted avatar and sync data so that URLs are hashed prior to transmitting over multiplayer. While not 100% it certainly reduces the risk of hidden URLs being shared.  Another could be that I have a registered account with the multiplayer server. I can log on via the chat or maybe a webview page. The servers can then determine if my username gets access to that avatar URL.  Basically I say go for it if only for the experience and experimenting this will allow. That it creates a market for content creators and content consumers is just a bonus."
janusVR,3atsdi,Nukemarine,2,Wed Jun 24 03:19:06 2015 UTC,I really have no interest in furthering this sort of 'security'.
janusVR,3atsdi,Nukemarine,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:20:06 2015 UTC,"The part about hashing URLs in the avatar file would have to be on the Janus program. It already happens with player's current URL info so it makes sense.  As for security, I assume if you're hosting the buying and selling of avatars there has to be some form of secure transactions available. If you provide that, people are going to ask how are their products which was purchased with money kept unique? Obviously there's no bullet proof solution since the data has to be shared publicly in some format so that users can display the avatar.  Again, I don't know how you and Qster are going to approach this. Even if you don't consider the security options the experience gained is worth it."
janusVR,3atsdi,Nukemarine,2,Thu Jun 25 23:38:32 2015 UTC,"Secure transactions I certainly have interest in, but when you have a digital product and share it on the internet, there is no good means of protection, and most of the means that try this (like DRM) I have moral objects to... so the uniqueness is not something I have an interest in providing. I'm interested in selling convenience, not exclusivity."
janusVR,3atsdi,Nukemarine,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:54:46 2015 UTC,"Hence the security by obscurity with regards to URL links in the avatar data which will be a James/Janus thing. The data is not locked down but a reasonable level of tediousness is added to prevent average users from accessing data people don't want completely public. That tediousness makes a $0.50 avatar very secure because its not worth the effort to figure out the actual URL. Now, I wouldn't trust a piece of a data that's worth $50 but then why would someone put that on the open internet.  What will happen in the future though will be servers that care about such things will control avatars. The data won't be private, however the servers can at least say ""On here, you're not wearing that avatar because you not registered as having access to it"". Open servers/web sites like VR Sites won't care but maybe a MMRPG server will.  Again I say go for it. Problems that can't be predicted will pop up and the solutions that come about will prove useful on a wider scale."
janusVR,3atsdi,timschwartz,2,Fri Jun 26 00:12:37 2015 UTC,"The problem with saying ""you can't wear that because you don't have access to it"" is that it's the same as saying ""no one else can see what you're wearing because no one else has access to it""."
janusVR,3atsdi,nikkmitchell,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:17:36 2015 UTC,"The ""you don't have access to it"" is no more than the hat program for TF2 or any other accessory store for online games. Sure, I could probably hack my own TF2 to have my character have a hat, but there's likely no easy way to make the servers allow others to see that hat.  However that's a far in the future, many websites many servers thing with companies figuring out what their users want. But really, it's more like a message board where you can select the avatar image that's shown by your message. Some sites have strict rules, some don't. Its up to the server and website owners.  Let's say there's a secure multiplayer server for Janus that's a first person shooter variety. The servers on there look at your avatar data that it relays to other players. The servers could replace the avatar data with different URLs so on their browsers you look different. That helps with looks of armor and weapons for instance.  I'm sure it'll be more complicated than that but this sounds like a reasonable type of restriction because its creating a controlled game environment.  For open browsing and open multi-player, yeah, kind of silly to think that can be controlled and still keep the open nature. However, these ideas will start to develop."
janusVR,3atsdi,vicxvr,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:56:46 2015 UTC,"It would have to be pretty inexpensive considering anyone can just copy the avatar as soon as they see it.   Second Life has the same issue, maybe see how much custom avatars sell for there?"

janusVR,3akinc,konchok,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:32:02 2015 UTC,42.7: 85fps   You got only 85 fps in the lobby with a Geforce 980? So weaker GPUs like a Radeon 7870 are pretty much guaranteed to have < 75 fps?
janusVR,3akinc,NXT_Aussie,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:26:23 2015 UTC,Janus works better with AMD cards than NVIDIA currently. So you can get much better performance out of a Radeon for some reason with Janus right now.

As for Janus, I think adding a parent portal history to the portal system would be the best thing right now to complete the transition to the new architecture. Also, if you go through the Usagii portal, and walk to the right into the experiments door, it typically crashes every time. That's pretty much all I can think of."
janusVR,3aj35k,dizzket,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:43:25 2015 UTC,"As for Janus, I think adding a parent portal history to the portal system would be the best thing right now to complete the transition to the new architecture.   I'm interested in knowing more about this. Is this a trail of the initial room and all the doors that someone has gone through, which would be used to recreate the environment upon a crash?"
janusVR,3aj35k,Atari_Historian,2,Mon Jun 29 20:46:05 2015 UTC,"Right now, if a room is deallocated, its parent portal in the child room will be disabled.  If you reenable the parent portal, it will grab the URL from that parent portal, and scan that URL's website for the room that you're standing in, and place the exit point over that portal. This works if you have a single portal to the room that you're in inside of the place you're trying to reach, but when you have multiples, there will be a conflict about where to place the exit point.  Keeping a history of these exit points rather than generating them based off markup would work consistently."
janusVR,3aj35k,dizzket,3,Tue Jun 30 04:39:12 2015 UTC,"#1 PRIORITY: Usability for new users. Period. I know that a lot of people may feel that you're not making progress if you're not adding new features and pushing the edge, but you need to give these people a back seat for just a tiny bit. This is not the priority of your mainstream users who adapted to your software, so you shouldn't expect a massive vote count on this. Make JanusVR simple to use where I can put someone with a general familiarity with VR apps in front of it and they will quickly be productive. As a bonus, this should provide value (in terms of viewership) to those who create content in JanusVR.  Also, sorry to hear about your personal troubles. I've been in a similar situation myself, and I hope that it turns out well for your in the longer term."
janusVR,3aj35k,Atari_Historian,6,Sat Jun 20 22:47:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with this 100% and I'd like to throw my hat in to help out. I've been in design and usability for over a decade professionally, and I've already been a part of a project to build a game in Janus. Without a good initial user experience, Janus will never take off."
janusVR,3aj35k,solidwhetstone,3,Sun Jun 21 04:40:19 2015 UTC,"I know I recently went through this as a new user, partially discovering that being on Mac wasn't helping. Hopefully none of my comments were taken as a sign of dissatisfaction. I know I'm new to this group, but as VR enthusiasts I think we're all in this together.  I had a post about use cases and later noticed that LewisP had a similar post. Normally when I work with customers we look at goals in terms of longterm vision and desired KPIs. It's good to both dream of what this might look like 5-10 years down the road and also to quantify what JanusVR's goals are and what should be considered a success.  Based on those we compile a list of use cases (containing a feature or a group of features) and prioritize them. I don't claim to know the diversity of what you have in mind, but I'm guessing that when looking at everything at once the task seems daunting. It will be helpful to take the time to determine what features you have on the table, what are most important in the near term and to design the user experience before jumping into the code.  So to circle back, if your near term goals involve more users logging in and/or creating content, then on boarding, simpler personalization features and more structured tutorials might be some of the more relevant right items now.  As a UX/UI designer I'd be glad to contribute where I can be it on boarding or something else. :)"

Your personal life of course takes precedence and I hope that everything turns out alright for you in this. It's not always easy to remember that even though we love your software and have high standards (some you've most excellently set yourself) we're all also human. Being human is good, even though it hurts at times. –hugs– I have every confidence that you'll get through this and be the better for it in the long run.

With launch windows now established and only 6-9 months out, I feel like stability improvements/optimization are the key things to be focused on.   It may be time to consider moving to a stable/experimental branch system so that new users aren't put off by the bugs new features invariably bring.  (new user orientation and proper bug tracking would be great as well, I always liked Trac for software project management)."
janusVR,3aj35k,timschwartz,3,Sat Jun 20 23:19:27 2015 UTC,"Many thanks for the stability improvements! Room construction has improved significantly after the updates. I definitely think the stability of Janus should always be the top priority as we approach consumer HMD days, we don't want to be losing newcomers to a Snowcrash. ....see what I did there? (;  If possible, a web client would be a great addition. If we could embed a miniature Janus client to our 2D webpage, we could feature both the 2D and 3D versions simultaneously. I think this might help with the transition to a 3D web browser as well as show the benefits of using the technology. It also removes the need for a download if a new user just wants to try it out.  In regards to edit mode, it would be outstanding to be able to create geometry from vertex points. Tab through the assets until the vertex asset appears. Place your vertex, create and place more vertices. Then select 2 verts to create a line, continue connecting verts until the polygon is closed and a face can be made.  I understand the difficulty of the latter, but the ability to create geometry right inside of Janus could become a key feature that makes the program more adoptable. Just think, what if you never had to download a 3D modelling software to get started making cool things in Janus? Obviously many would still use other modelling software, but a basic feature allowing this could be the base for something more sophisticated down the road. Even if we were only able to make geometry on a single plane, it would be neat."

And I know that this really only happens for me, but the fact that I have to choose a new username every time I load JanusVR is beyond insane. There's a really strange bug, where if you visit a room, then you bring someone else into that room, you will be invisible to them, but you can see them. This really screws up multi-player syncing.   But once 42.x is all worked out. (And feel free to add small features if you'd like). I think many of us would like the next major update to be VOIP."

janusVR,3aj35k,dizzket,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:54:56 2015 UTC,"The scenevr integration is a very good thing.  But I can't see JanusVR and SceneVR maintain stability with SceneVR's dynamic elements because of new features that are still being added to both.  How would you recommend handling this?  I think I've said this before, but I think the simplest solution is to have Janus to parse the SceneVR static mark-up and ignore anything dynamic, such as javascript.   Do you agree? If not, is there a way to synchronize the javascript in a safe way to avoid crashing and to maintain compatability throughout updates to both SceneVR and JanusVR?"
janusVR,3aj35k,aluchan,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:11:33 2015 UTC,"Robust stability should probably be the first priority. Joint second priority would be VoIP and some kind of 'new user' detection to send new users straight to a tutorial upon start up. There has been a fair amount of discussion about the ease of use for new users. Immediately forcing them through a short tutorial on first start up would be beneficial I think.   edit: Relating to stability, something needs to be done about the significant screen-freeze when clicking on portals that contain heavy assets. Having the screen freeze while in the rift can make people feel notsogreat :)"

janusVR,3ae5k5,MrM0bius,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:22:47 2015 UTC,"Very cool script! :) This reminds me of a feature request I had - the ability to set the 'src' attribute on a Video or WebSurface dynamically using JS. I tried various ways to hack around that like dynamically spawning new websurfaces and destroying old ones, but without the src attribute I'm limited to a hardcoded list of starter URLs. Didn't specifically try for Video, but the spec looks similar.  Currently I'm using the same WebSurface for both the ""console"" and ""theatre"" screen in order to mirror my video selection screen for easy access from the back of the theatre. In this case, if I could get and set 'src' dynamically, then the vrsites.com/yt/[id] proxy would be great for selecting the video on a smaller WebSurface and then using a JS bridge to set the larger movie theatre screen video to the vrsites youtube proxy.   I'm generally going for the ability to view my usual 2D video websites inside the theatre (YT, Netflix ..), which is feasible since we have a good 2D web browser inside Janus (silverlight might be tricky)."

For it to be true 1:1 the height should be scaled down. Most of NASAs topography models do this to better illustrate the changes in elevation."

janusVR,39upu3,collectingbones,3,Sun Jun 14 23:11:05 2015 UTC,"It's a good question. If JanusVR becomes a successful metaverse, then asking 'what is it for?' will be akin to asking 'what is the meaning of life?' haha.   If you consider janusVR as a potential alternative universe within which we will occupy, then it seems strange to ask what the goals are for this alternative universe. What are the goals of our current universe? Does it have goals?  Personally, I believe we attribute purpose and meaning to our lives and the universe and the same will be true of any alternative universe we may inhabit. JanusVR will have no inherent goals or purpose, it will be its occupants that have goals and find purpose in their lives.   So in short, I think aside from existing as a stable platform and alternative to the 'real life' universe, janusVR will have no inherent goals or purpose. It is up to us, the occupants of this alternative universe, to find purpose and meaning in our virtual lives :)  edit: man, I need to lay off the weed... [jk]"
janusVR,39upu3,Lewis_P,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:36:21 2015 UTC,"I like where you're going :)  I had some of my own questions when I was looking around. ""Oh, I'm in a cinema. Why are there chairs here? Should there be chairs? At what point does the inclusion of these skeuomorphs become detrimental?""  I'd say that surfing the web is kind of like what you're talking about. There's not always a real defined goal, you just kind of meander along flying off tangentially from time to time as your interest gets distracted by something new. You're able to do that because of the sheer amount of content that is available and linked together on the web. From the perspective of the web though there's a defined purpose.  You can't cruise along the palm-tree lined oceanside in a red Cadillac convertible without a bunch of stuff happening.  Maybe that doesn't make sense, but it seems like although life may still lack meaning, a metaverse needs some kind of purpose or more likely a collection of purposes."
janusVR,39upu3,Lewis_P,2,Mon Jun 15 23:38:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe that doesn't make sense, but it seems like although life may still lack meaning, a metaverse needs some kind of purpose or more likely a collection of purposes.   I think there is a distinction to make between the universe and the experiences within the universe (for clarity, where I say universe here I mean both meta and real life).  A cinema serves a purpose, a cafe serves a purpose, a table serves a purpose, the objects and activities within the universe can all be given purpose and meaning by people, but that is fundamentally different to the universe itself having purpose.  In the case of the real world universe, I see no evidence that it has an inherent purpose. I guess the difference with the metaverse is that we know that it will be a man made construct built to simulate a universe. In that sense there is evidence of a purpose; to be a stable alternative to the real world universe. This sort of purpose is abstract from the occupants residing in the metaverse i.e. it should have no impact on the meaning and purpose that occupants of the universe have/generate/feel or attribute to objects within the metaverse. Just as we don't consider the purpose of google chrome while we browse reddit or watch youtube videos, or the purpose of the universe while we glance at our watch to check the time."
janusVR,39upu3,MrM0bius,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:14:31 2015 UTC,"I'll put forward that the users need to purpose the universe and not the other way around (that the universe has purpose). I wonder what place a seat in a cinema has in a metaverse? I don't know of any command to sit nor do I think you can skirt down the aisles to get to a particular seat. It raises a number of questions. Why does a virtual character need to sit? Should the metaverse mimic our own universe? To what degree is that helpful and to what degree is it burdensome or limiting? If you have a million people in a room watching a live video, should their avatars block your view because they are virtually present with you?  The difference is that the real universe has a vast set of building blocks and rules that have allowed us to build formidable things and still be challenged by unknowns. This metaverse is based in Janus VR and that requires these things be coded. Unless the parallels to building blocks and rules exist already in Janus VR, we won't have the same flexibility. It's something that probably needs to be built and improved over time like all products (Google Chrome included)."
janusVR,39upu3,Lewis_P,3,Wed Jun 17 00:50:20 2015 UTC,"I'd say the use cases are many and varied, among them:   General recreational socialization: watching videos, listening to music, chatting, sharing internet content, social events Demonstration of products, services, software Games, both actual games within Janus and rooms for promotion of retail VR games Education, virtual ""field trips"" and enhanced classroom content, social and creative tools for online learning. Commerce? VR storefronts, we're not there yet, but I see a case for them, especially for retailers who have access to 3d assets of their products. Business Collaboration, I could see a social, visualized internet platform such as Janus being useful for a variety of business uses including: vr teleconferencing, virtual conferences, research collaboration, collaborative ArchViz projects."
janusVR,39upu3,DelanaQuinn,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:55:39 2015 UTC,"These are the types of things I was imagining as well.  Aside from multi-user scenarios, I’d also envision personal use that would range from quite simply a tranquil and personalized space, extend to work or leisure in the sense that you could take advantage of the benefits of 3d surfing, listening to music, chatting in a single environment (generally be connected in either an active or passive way) and finally a ‘physical’ place to store, organize and access your digital stuff. As we move more and more towards cloud based systems and away from local storage, the latter might become more relevant and enticing. Wouldn’t it be nice if it became your virtual home? Somewhere safe for your data and all that personal information? Maybe an aggregation of your social networks and feeds? Somewhere that you might access on fly along the lines of augmented reality as opposed to something complete immersive?  A little dreaming.. In any case, use cases like these and the ones you mentioned start to bring up questions that, as a designer, I can’t help but ask. :)  For example, my initial instinct entering Janus VR aside from looking around the virtual environment and seeing what I could do was to attempt to learn the controls and personalize my identity. God forbid you look like a noob! Users will want to make the experience their own. They’ll want to name themselves, create an avatar that represents them and a space that they can be proud of. Did you have a similar experience?  That’s a use case that we haven’t really considered in our list but feels vital for the success of something like Janus VR. Personally, I didn’t really have an easy time doing those things despite working in the technology field and with a basic knowledge of coding.  As we build up to some of the scenarios you mentioned, we’ll find a bunch of use cases embedded within them. Friends want to get together and chat while watching you tube videos for example. There are a few things that need to come together to make even that happen.  I guess what I’m driving at is that generally we should focus on making those things which we feel would make Janus VR compelling easy to do for everyone. I’m not saying that there’s not some effort in that direction already but it’s a key component that could still use some work.  I’m willing to help out, but for the meantime all I can do is write long reddit replies ;)"
janusVR,39upu3,Lewis_P,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:22:02 2015 UTC,"For example, my initial instinct entering Janus VR aside from looking around the virtual environment and seeing what I could do was to attempt to learn the controls and personalize my identity. God forbid you look like a noob! Users will want to make the experience their own. They’ll want to name themselves, create an avatar that represents them and a space that they can be proud of. Did you have a similar experience?   This has been a hot topic about janusVR for a while now. I think that a 'breakout' first time user experience to introduce the user to the fundaments of janusVR would be beneficial. The question is whether this is stretching a little too far in to the 'centralised' territory that perhaps janusVR should steer clear of. Personally, at this stage in its development, the benefits of ensuring that every first time user is shown how to change their name, create portals, chat to people, would outweigh the negatives. The focus at the moment should be on ensuring a positive experience for every user to keep them coming back and to keep janusVR growing."
janusVR,39upu3,DelanaQuinn,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:30:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed!  Do you have any idea who might be working on something like that?  I believe the on boarding experience should even go a little deeper into the functionality. If we determined some use cases which we thought were crucial, beneficial or compelling to the different ways that users might want to use Janus VR above, then creating additional instructional resources within the VR might help both adoption and content creation. I'd certainly benefit from something like that in any case!  Do you think this is the right path? Are there resources that already cover some of this?"
janusVR,39upu3,Lewis_P,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:34:57 2015 UTC,"I may or may not be on the right page here but it sounds like a phenomenal idea. I can't answer who'd be working on it since I'm a noob here but most all browsers have their main landing page. This page for janusvr should have the instructions, download links if any, an embedded room or however it works, a full search function even if it just routes google for now, but also a search of user rooms, themes, etc.   A starting portal of sorts and let people surf the web, surf vr, surf jansvr room/sites, and if it's doable and still gives some experience without having to wear vr goggles (which will get old quickly when people need quick info here, on the fly, right now)...all the better.   I wouldn't mind helping develop it soon as I get a more solid understanding of it ;-p  ETA For the official record I wentto janusvr.com and they have a nice site but it didn't show me what, exactly, this even is. I saw the you tube video and the sphere which was cool but for all I know it's just fancy video graphics. There's no working example anywhere in an easy to spot location. Big fail for people who really aren't too sure what it is or why they need it/want it. It's been 2 reddits that have given me more info. Fail for janusvr on that note. :-( Janusvr.com should be that portal space first and foremost..."
janusVR,39upu3,Lewis_P,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:23:02 2015 UTC,"A vr sites search engine is a great idea. I think it is probably something that is on the radar already for /u/qster123.    ... some experience without having to wear vr goggles (which will get old quickly when people need quick info here, on the fly, right now)...all the better.   While I agree that it should work in 2D. I think I disagree about the suggestion that people might use vr to get info quickly. The true value of janusVR is the VR element. Being able to feel as though you are physically occupying rooms with others is something special. If you just want to find out some quick info, I don't think you would use janusVR, you'd probably google it on your phone.   For the official record I wentto janusvr.com and they have a nice site but it didn't show me what, exactly, this even is.    This has been an ongoing issue. The problem is that its near impossible to explain what janusVR is in a manner that is clear and concise. I wrote a thread about it a while ago here.    There's no working example anywhere in an easy to spot location.   Perhaps it's unclear that it requires standalone software and doesn't run in browser.    Janusvr.com should be that portal space first and foremost...   The developer is pretty responsive to feedback. If you have suggestions for how the site could improve, would you mind making a post about it so the community can contribute their thoughts :)"
janusVR,39upu3,Aquareon,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:13:04 2015 UTC,"One quick comment: While you might be right that Janus VR won't often be used for a quick drop in-drop outs, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't be able to get in there and start doing what you want to do quickly. Even walking to your bookmarks and finding the right door will seem tedious after a while.  Personally I'm still wondering about whether users will want to quickly access things or quickly reach out to someone within Janus and drop out after a minute or less but I guess we'll find out.  Speaking of which, are there usage statistics that anyone is monitoring? Data would tell us a lot."
janusVR,39upu3,DelanaQuinn,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:21:06 2015 UTC,"I wasn't even sure what to do but downloaded the software and installed/ran it. I landed between two big black squares with what appeared to be desktop wallpaper of a snowy blue/white mountain. I clicked around and nothing happened. I shut it down and tried again just to make sure it wasn't the program.  I clicked the black squares a few times and pushed the WASD keys and figured out it moved me - to a point - and worked the mouse a bit and managed to end up in a pretty cool lobby place with a bunch of signs. I found the scrolling tutorial thing and then moved around the whole place to see what was there. Most of the ""doorways"" I clicked on or attempted to move to didn't do anything and I went nowhere.  Eventually I figured out how to click on it and wait for the loader thing to happen and then I could go through. I went into several ""rooms"" that really looked like people uploaded 2d images of 3d stuff and most everything was empty. I went to some room, forgot offhand but there was a variety and I went into this gray room with ramps to higher levels til I made it to the roof. Figured out how to jump over the side and land on the floor because it was way faster than scrolling all the way down. Wondered if JVR has heard of teleporting with a mouseclick...  Checked out a couple more rooms and since I found absolutely nothing happening, none of the rooms looked like cool 3d builds - even similar to the lobby or ramp room - just square space with 2d images as backgrounds you can move through to nowhere in particular - I wasn't sure what the appeal would be.   Coming from SL and opensim and being able to build elaborate builds in a space that can be terraformed, and moving quickly via teleportation, and having an avatar at all that was somewhat appealing, it was hard to find an affinity with JVR. I wanted to. I wanted to discover all the cool options to actually build in 3d, have a wholly different space than just a square room with posters you can walk through...  To the comment about 2d info - I based that off of the comments about this being a foundation of a real metaverse and 3d web so I assumed the ""web"" part still applied and no, people are not going to fetch the vr goggles and rig up to explore for information, obviously. But then again, given the ability to create breath taking worlds, immersive environments with unity, or UE, or even SL and Opensim I don't know how JVR can compete with that with the boxes and posters. It might be cool to check out but if that's as much as you can build up an environment it's not going to make it out of the gate.   If I had a choice between any of the rooms I visited when I finally figured out what it was about, and the absolute crappiest world built in unity I'd pick the latter because it'd be actually 3d immersion.   JVR reminded me of the old attempts at 3d rooms minus the cartoon furniture.   Not knocking it - I may still not be entirely sure what the point of it is - this is just my experience and it may help the devs in some small way see things from a clueless noobs point of view on ease of use and purpose, style, form and function. I offer it all with all due respect."
janusVR,39upu3,NXT_Aussie,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:09:52 2015 UTC,"Fascinating account of your experience! Thank you!   I'm going to go through what you've said and try to respond to the issues you have raised. It's too easy for this to seem dismissive of the problems you have raised. So I want to say upfront that the solution is not to inform individuals who bring up these problems, but to bake the information in to the experience itself. Also note that I'm not a developer of JanusVR, just a long time fan and contributor :)   I have a feeling that your account is fairly typical of a fairly significant proportion of first time janusVR users, which is a problem for janusVR.   The main cause of some of the problems you mentioned relate to the loading of assets in rooms. There is currently no visual indication that assets are being loaded, which can cause confusion. I think the 'loading' visuals were removed in a fairly recent update for some reason.   Re: the quantity of doorways in the lobby. I think it is overkill at the moment, many of the doors are placeholders (I think). The lobby should probably include doorways to major categories of experiences and not much else. A portal to the tutorial room, a portal to vrsites subreddit, a portal to the featured content, a portal to the vrsites lobby, a portal to key contributors, that should be about it I think.   The issue regarding the quantity of empty rooms with pictures on walls stems from the 'user created' nature of all of the content in janusVR. What you are describing sounds like the default room that is common throughout janusVR as it is the room you are given when you set up an account with vrsites. I think more needs to be done to filter out those rooms so that users can discover the 'cream of the crop'. Visiting /r/vrsites in janusvr is probably the best example of this at the moment. Perhaps more emphasis should be placed on this doorway in the main lobby. For the time being, I think barriers should be put up in the lobby to prevent users attempting to go through all of the placeholder portals.  You can already teleport with a mouse click, if you click and hold where you want to go. If that isn't clear from the instructions, I can rework the visuals.   Regarding building in janusVR. It's actually incredibly easy to do (once you know how... which is the problem!). Here is an example of how quickly content can be brought in from blender/sketchup: video. I'm not sure how to communicate this to users. If a more comprehensive tutorial experience is built, maybe it should include tasks such as building steps to reach a higher platform or something.   Like I said, I hope this doesn't sound dismissive of the problems you faced. Descriptions like yours are far more valuable than any discussion between long time users of janusVR."
janusVR,39upu3,dizzket,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:11:22 2015 UTC,"So there are already some resources in janusVR that cover this. There is a tutorial room off the main lobby that shows you through some of the basics. There has recently been some infographic style instructions added to the main lobby. The problem is that nobody will find the tutorial room in its current location, or know to click on it if they haven't figured out the controls.   I think knowing the right path is complicated. There is value in allowing people to discover some things themselves and this is great when people engage and figure things out. The result is that they feel like they have earned something or learned skills using their own initiative. However it doesn't always work and those who are unable to figure things out will likely quit and never return. The opposite end of the scale is to have player accounts with logins so that people can have something they feel ownership over (like in Altspace). This would be great for friends lists etc, but detracts from the openness and decentralised nature of janusVR.  I think the middle ground is for janusVR to detect first time users and drop them immediately in to a short tutorial that ends with them in the main lobby having been informed of the controls, how to change their name, chosen an avatar etc. I think some of the community might have been working on something at some point, maybe /u/dizzket? I believe this would be a short term solution that is only necessary while janusVR finds its feet and establishes itself. In the future I can see interaction with janusVR being streamlined to the point where a tutorial is not necessary."

janusVR,39upu3,konchok,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:36:40 2015 UTC,"Hello. I've just learned that this exists and it's raised a couple of questions to help me clear the fog of novelty.   One thing I have wanted since the 1990s was a 3d website. The absolute closest I've ever seen has been a set up called Jibe, which is similar to a second life world, fully interactive, multi user, etc in a web browser. Unfortunately their demo site prompts that it requires a unity plugin which was discontinued so nothing actually loads. They use Unity to build the levels which I'm assuming are the equivalent of a janusvr room but the downside is they think they're going to actually get away with charging people 1500 bucks to get the package. There's a reason they've not done much since 2012.   I can't find any sort of working demo for janusvr real time, a website, a 3d web room or whatever it is, to see what exactly it's supposed to be or do.   My long time agenda was a 3d website with multiple rooms and the fun jazzy stuff of scripts like js, css, dhtml, and now moving to html5 and webgl...but with the same interactivity found in the second life/jibe environments. I wanted visitors to be able to just move about inside, interact with things, turn corners in a natural movement (like in sl) instead of right arrow scrolling right, for example. I didn't want it to crash if more than 15 people happened to be on (or in??) the site at the same time.  I wanted a dedicated room for visitors to watch movies or read books or play games, socialize, hang out, etc. I wanted the main page to load up when my domain/url is called and there's no lag, there's no plugin download business, no heavy software to install, no viewers to install or run, no third party dictating what content could be on my site or in my rooms.  I wanted it to function the way my website functions only with immersive, interactive, intelligent 3d environments.  Is this what janus offers? If so is there an example i can check out - that isn't a picture of what it is but showing me actually what it is without me having to download a bunch of stuff? Is it functional at all without virtual reality goggles? Surely the VR goggles would be more optional, nobody will every adopt janusvr as a vr browser if the only way they get the experience is putting the goggles on all the time.   Thanks!"
janusVR,39upu3,konchok,2,Wed Jun 17 02:07:32 2015 UTC,Yes - everything you want is in janusVR right now.  Download janusVR from www.janusvr.com - no rift required

They see the potential of using Janus to preview their display setups and to show to customers unable to travel to their location to see how the displays will turn out.  I was tickled to have it working on the VS2.  I had the leap on the desk and the hand on the projection was matching really well. Really sad my phone was running out of battery and not saving videos/pictures. Had some good ones.  Bottom Line: JanusVR isn't just a curiousity. VR has a real application that results in earnings.   James, if ever you need to do a demonstration down in Atlanta, I have an open invitation to come back. If Janus could work with Scalable Displays you could preview a dome's location in a dome.

Maybe a smaller button on the bottom that says ""View Rooms"" that leads to some sort of index.  Making all of the UI elements in this space seem like they're a part of the 3d area would be aesthetically pleasing and fit with the theme. (like shadows on the floor)"

janusVR,38qscl,sirkitree,5,Sat Jun 6 00:54:13 2015 UTC,"The welcome screen for vrsites.com should probably include the steps necessary to have your own virtual real estate. My suggestion would be:    Step 1. Sign up for VRsites   [upon completion of sign up, take user back to these steps, with step 1 ticked]  Step 2. Download JanusVR  [open in new tab to allow user to return to steps with step 1 and 2 ticked]  Step 3. Visit your room  [force the user to launch janus directly in to their room using a 'launch my room' button. This would probably require some work on james' end. Add the users name in text to the room so they can tell its their own room, also included in the room should be instructions to close janus and return to vrsites to see Step 4. The room should say have text in it saying 'Welcome to your room, you can control the content of your room in one of two ways, directly in JanusVR or using the vrsites editor' etc.]  Step 4. Begin customising your room in code  [step 4 should be a 'click to enter the room editor' button. Takes the user directly to the editor with the code for the room they were just in. Use speech bubble pop up things seen on most website tutorials to indicate the locations in the code of the things they saw in the room. Then ask them to upload an image and tell them what XYZ coords to use so that it appears on the wall. Then add a 'test my room' button that launches janusVR directly to their room.]    Thats the basics and probably enough to get them going. You could then consider introducing them to the ability to edit the room within janus, or maybe introduce them to the manual of potential things they can do with their room. Whatever the next step is, it should take things slow. There is a tonne of stuff that you have to understand in order to edit rooms effectively, so its important that the user is introduced to it slowly :)  edit: Also, the home page for vrsites.com should not ask the user to sign up when they are already signed up. The buttons should be replaced with 'room editor' and 'my stats' or something :)"
janusVR,38qscl,Lewis_P,1 point,Sat Jun 6 09:57:27 2015 UTC,[force the user to launch janus directly in to their room using a 'launch my room' button   Yes this is an OS specific thing in which you have to register a particular protocol.

It's a free service, so many people just sign up to see what it's like.  Realize that work's involved and leave.  If you want a higher percentage of users, you have to communicate that there is some amount of reward for that work.  And at the beginning, lots and lots of hand holding."

There needs to be a websurface and instructions RIGHT in front of people that allows them to get a room, and tells them what VRSites is. Perhaps also making the homeroom portal picture animated or pop more.  Also, having a ""featured rooms"" section would motivate people to make a room and get it up there.  Also, the default room is kind of confusing. Have ALL the instructions in every new room, with ALL the resources people need.

janusVR,38qscl,Nukemarine,2,Sat Jun 6 04:43:20 2015 UTC,"How does that compare to the old VR Sites where maybe 10%, if that many, of the ""rooms"" had actual content behind the door? If it's on par then I'd say good job.  My next question is how many rooms on average are there counting both the front door and the other rooms that don't get doors? I assume it's much, much higher as I've created a dozen or so rooms myself without even trying. If that's a very high number, it might point to having a ""New Rooms"" doors in the VR Sites lobby to show off all this hidden stuff most will not see. Just let the newest content be near the entrance if that can be arranged. Even better, have a voting mechanism along with a decaying rank so quality new stuff gets shown ahead of below average rooms.  Also, I hate to say it, but maybe, just maybe there needs to be some default template rooms. Way I imagine, the templates are cool bedrooms, living rooms, art galleries, etc. When people pick a template, they're fill in the ""blanks"" with images, objects, movies, texts, colors, links, etc both from URLs or from VR Sites defaults. These get created and placed as the user's front room. The old q.vrsites.com is a great example of this where people could choose a poster and a video. However, templates should have more things to input so that when its created it has a sense of being something new and unique."
janusVR,38qscl,qster123,3,Sat Jun 6 09:55:54 2015 UTC,"My next question is how many rooms on average are there counting both the front door and the other rooms that don't get doors?   There are 123 people who have at least 1 room. There are 216 rooms.   having a ""New Rooms"" doors in the VR Sites lobby   I like this idea a lot and have created a ticket for it. I think we could present it like a hallway or something different than a hotel in order to separate it from the 'hotel address' or 'home' concept; make it evident it's a adynamic listing.   Even better, have a voting mechanism along with a decaying rank so quality new stuff gets shown ahead of below average rooms.   Been thinking about this one for a while and no good way to implement just yet. But rest assured the gears are turning.   default template rooms.   This is definitely something we want to provide. I'd like to setup a competition or something for people who are already familiar with JanusVR to submit these and have a panel of people who judge them and select winners in a few categories. I think this would be great PR in general for JanusVR as well. I may start a new thread about this one."
janusVR,38qscl,qster123,2,Sat Jun 6 15:32:15 2015 UTC,"The idea of doors being positioned by rating is something in our queue, but it would be arranged via JS - otherwise the owners of the doors will be confused as to why their homes are moving! We all have category banners that will soon be shown above the doors.  Templates for sure are a good thing, I'll rebake my beloved office and put that up as one, with a few pictures and such."

Just reading the suggestions it brought to mind how virtual world grids like second life and os grid set things up for the absolutely new and clueless. Nothing is left up to them to figure out. They are automatically placed in orientation space with signs explaining the basics, then on to moving, then arrows pointing to starter avatars and freebie content left by more experienced creators, then they are given some easy places to explore and get the hang of it - which could be the 'featured rooms' - all leading back to the starting location.   Then they can go to a sandbox and practice building stuff or they can get their own space and start hunting for content. And as they become more experienced they can evolve their builds and avatars however they wish...and start enjoying the space.   But until they're ready, there are tons of social spaces they can go check out, find  a scene they like, meet other netizens and find a groove.   There should be a choice so people who don't have time or aren't ready for the learning curve can skip it and just go room hopping to see what it is all about and be able to return to the learning area when they're ready...and others can follow the path/arrows through the whole instructional course before being set loose into the ""open"" metaverse...  And for the love of christ don't start nickel and diming people to death as soon as they get their bearings...give them the freedom to spend money or not at their discretion and not making it a barrier to a better user experience. Hundreds of thousands of user accounts in second life and the like are abandoned because unless you're prepared to fork over hundreds of dollars for premium content you can just walk around humping poseballs until the novelty wears off.  I watched a demo of one of these rooms with spaceman avatars and they don't walk. They skidded across the room. Is there any actual realism to these rooms/avis and interactivity or it is like 2d paper sliders? Just curious. I don't have a rift so I can't even access any of this stuff. I'm just reading up on it to get a better idea what's on offer and how easy (or not) it is to create rooms and get into it all.  How many rooms can you make?   ETA: are there poseballs? can the avatars do anything or are they stiff paper dolls that slide all over the place?"
janusVR,38no54,Atari_Historian,9,Fri Jun 5 11:43:07 2015 UTC,The Internet wasn't built by one company or group. It was agreed upon by many different groups and is still very fragmented. The key for a good browser like janusvr is that it be able to render sites built in other ways. So if Facebook comes along and says they're going to start building vr environments using fbml (for example)  then you'd want Janusvr and any other vr browsers to be able to render that. Janus isn't the metaverse (it's a browser for the metaverse) and other things that come along won't be the metaverse. The metaverse is just a word to describe a virtual Internet. It will still largely function the same way- sites and pages and links.
janusVR,38no54,solidwhetstone,3,Fri Jun 5 18:33:05 2015 UTC,"This is the one big thing that needs to be understood here. VR in the media has been ramming down our throat for decades the idea of one connected VR, that for some reason in the future people only use the internet to play Second Life and WOW clones in VIRTUAL REALITY. The truth is, it isn't going to be one thing that captures what the metaverse is, just like the internet as we know it today isn't dominated by poor Second Life and WOW clones. Sometimes a guy just wants to post dank memes on Reddit in the metaverse."
janusVR,38no54,ThatPersonGu,5,Sat Jun 6 19:58:44 2015 UTC,"I think there's a fear of developing for the wrong metaverse.  ""What if I develop something, then (google, facebook, etc) makes one that's a million times better and it'll be for nothing.  Even though this is a reality, the skills learned still makes the risk worth it.  I may build for the wrong program, but the knowledge I learn is easily transferable to VRchat, Altspace, or whatever else might come out."
janusVR,38no54,konchok,3,Fri Jun 5 17:12:56 2015 UTC,"Well stated. I like reading what you write so I'm anticipating what you're coming up with. When it comes to fears, I have a few. I'll try to list them in order.   Advertising. I'm very afraid that the metaverse is going to become just like the 2D web in this regard and (like heading into New York City) you feel visually violated and inundated with the crap that people are trying to push down your visual cortex. We've got to find a better way to monetize. Silos. The internet itself is starting to silo, with various forms of networks that can only be accessed by different programs. The regular web held out for a long time due to the adoption of standardized formats (HTML, CSS, JS) and many ways to access that content (the various browsers). But with VR, no one has agreed to any sort of standards and therefore everyone is going it their own way. I'm still hopeful that we can come up with some standards so that (for example) apps like JanusVR and SceneVR can render the exact same markup and you can view the metaverse in your choice of browser. Defeat. By that I mean I'm afraid of the people who I think are pushing forth my/our shared vision of the metaverse ending up feeling defeated enough by the 'big guys' to abandon their projects. Even if Google, Facebook, or some other company with tons of money ends up with a very popular platform that many people end up adopting, I hope that they'll continue anyway. I mean, there are tons of websites out there that have better alternatives (and I typically root for the underdogs) but they don't give up. A more recent example might be Ello.co which is trying to be a better form of social sharing and writing. In this regard I guess I'm comparing the various VR apps to websites, which isn't really the case unless they all start running on a standardized language/format, but you get my drift I think."

janusVR,38no54,NXT_Aussie,2,Sat Jun 6 13:16:41 2015 UTC,"My whole approach to VR right now is;  Even if what I'm working on doesn't succeed, I will have at least made some dent in how the future internet will operate at a fundamental level and I'm gaining skills in the process.  The first part of my goal is already realized.  Janus has already had a huge impact on what people picture as the future internet, and I helped build a large fraction of the fundamentals in room design and stuff.  I get to say I was there for the beginning, and I helped build it.  The second part is the potential money maker.  Even if Janus fails, I think my experience and skills in the realm of VR internet should help to put me near the top of ANY MetaVerse construction site or game design.  It's hard to ""lose"" if you learn enough along the way.  As for competition... I want it... BADLY.  Competition drives innovation, The benefits of that process will bring the masses, and the masses bring me customers."
janusVR,38no54,FireFoxG,2,Fri Jun 5 23:50:13 2015 UTC,"The 'metaverse' as put forth by Snowcrash will not come to be. Instead, it'll be as we see now with the 2D web and we're already glimpsing with Janus: individual sites with their own unique (though uniform in some aspects) method of communicating with them. That it'll be in a 3D or VR format will not change that. As long as the browser of choice can understand, display and allow input/communication then all is well.  True, Microsoft has nearly a 50% market share in the 2D browser world source, but there's more than enough options and variety from competitors to call that dominant. The same will happen with the 'metaverse' where different browsers offer different flavors and benefit but the ability to traverse the web in VR will remain. The multiplayer servers will be even more diverse.  TL-DR: Fear not for it is impossible to own the metaverse so long as it is impossible to own the internet."

janusVR,38mght,_central_,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:54:08 2015 UTC,"Well you always have the option to lock the assets, so maybe this would push for more locked rooms to prevent stolen assets. I know I don't lock enough rooms as I probably should heheh"
janusVR,38mght,Nukemarine,0,Sat Jun 6 03:11:21 2015 UTC,"Locked rooms don't offer much in way of security at the moment since people can just go to the URL directly in a 2D browser and copy/paste from there.  Where security for assets might occur then is from multiplayer servers and use of the #sync aspect. The website owners have an account with the servers which are the ones that send the actual HTML when people enter the room. The URL's HTML or maybe even the Javascript is the one that tells the server what actual HTML to send and Janus updates the room cause it thinks an #sync was sent.  With that, having a locked room means your assets will be very hard to copy as the actual URL to those assets are pseudo hidden. It would take a JSON sniffer program or something like that to grab the HTML sent over the multiplayer connection."

Could help give you a nice value add over traditional hosting, providing some vr-centric features.  It has the advantage of a dual backend, so it can use webgl if available, but it has it's own js rendering engine if webgl isn't available.  This means it actually works from inside janus, unlike most canvas based 3d viewers (check out their live demos, they all seem to load fine on a websurface).  Though of course things look better and render faster if you're using it in a modern webgl browser."

You should consider exploring methods of making holobuilder content compatible with janusvr. If you can grab the URL of the photosphere and the coordinates plus URLs of any other assets, and place that data in to the right places within a custom HTML file, you could easily view holobuilder content in janusVR.

janusVR,386sew,CrusaderOfMan,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:44:30 2015 UTC,"Great idea! Always love your concepts, simply brilliant!  So, my interpretation is that this side panel would be it's own website pinned to the left/right of the websurface in the ESC menu? The ""Productivity Mode"" window would read all content from the webpage (or even just the URL)  you're exploring, allowing you to open it in Janus with the click of a button, or link somebody else to the page?  You would also be able to communicate through text and voice through the side panel website. Could this be the answer we were looking for for VOIP?!? Always being connected (ability to turn off with multiplayer toggle) to the webpage offering those services would allow you to share voice and text data through applications hosted on that page? (I think back to when FireFox was using tinychat and the ESC websurface to do something like this)  P.S. ""Dizzket, you suck."" xD"

janusVR,37n43d,MrM0bius,3,Thu May 28 21:12:42 2015 UTC,"So, when using the default room templates, you can't actually texture or modify them because they're all pulled from local assets.  What you can do is pull the room assets from the program directory and upload them to your host.  Then you can load them like any other AssetObject (in this case either don't use a room template, or use room_plane with visible=""false""), this way you can texture them, apply an image/video/websurface, basically anything you can do with a standard asset object.  You may also want to open them in a 3d editor and modify them (add ceiling/texture/etc).  Of course you can also just do without the room template altogether and just create your own room with a 3d editor or something like sketchup (just load it as an asset object with collision)."
janusVR,37n43d,konchok,1 point,Thu May 28 21:27:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that's incredibly helpful.  On a side note, do you know how to operate sketchup2room?

Not sure what to do messing around with console, or what have you."
janusVR,37n43d,MrM0bius,2,Thu May 28 22:03:55 2015 UTC,"My advice don't use sketch-up to room.  You can export out the file as DAE natively then apply them to an html page by hand.   sketch-up2room uses a laggy shader and orients all objects at a 90 degree angle(it corrects for the mistake, but it makes room edits a pain)."
janusVR,37n43d,konchok,1 point,Thu May 28 22:43:24 2015 UTC,"You're right of course about the exports being at a 90 degree angle, but that's actually sketchup's default orientation (Z up).  As mentioned below, removing the shader is a quick notepad replace command away, and I actually find the  built in shader quite nice, it's only laggy when you get too many point lights (or in rooms with lots of polys), a few point lights mixed with an omni and a directional, doesn't cause much of a fps hit, plus there are some nice options for flickering torchlight, spotlight, etc.  I also find it much easier than manually laying out the html for a complicated scene, also easier than using the Janus editing tools.

If you're getting errors, check the following:   All components have a name/desc and it does not include spaces or special characters like # & , etc. (this means the default Component#10 type names must be changed).   Make sure each component is completely exploded to geometry, components inside of other components won't work. Either follow the sketchup2room tutorials for lighting (both in the package, and the VR room tutorials from inside Janus) OR be sure to remove the shader_id=""default_shader_id"" attribute from your objects manually in the exported html, this will allow the default Janus shaders to handle lighting (otherwise everything will be very dark because it's using the sketchup2room shaders, but with no lights being defined)."

With each dot being a spherical portal with XYZ coordinate determined by a database that assigns 3 values to each URL based on traffic data.   Were you thinking of using the absolute values or ranks? If you're going to use absolute values, to make it look a little more evenly distributed you could apply a log transformation. Without a logarithmic scale it might difficult to visualise lots of rooms with 1 or 2 visits at the same time as a few rooms with hundreds of visits."

janusVR,37jplu,MrM0bius,1 point,Thu May 28 17:58:28 2015 UTC,"I think ranking the values would make more sense as you'd get less gaps between points in the space.   You can get an idea of the problem with using absolute values if you try plotting a bunch of small values (<10) on to this:  http://hotmath.com/learning_activities/interactivities/3dplotter.swf  then one or two large values (>50). You will have to zoom out so far that the smaller values become indistinguishable from each other. One solution is the rank the values, which causes the space between each point to be equal, or you can use a log scale:  A standard arithmetic scale would be:  0 - 10 - 20 - 30 - 40 - 50 - 60 - 70 - 80 - 90 - 100  Which means there is a significant distance between the low values (<10) and the high values (>100)  However with a log scale:  0 - 10 - 100 - 1000 for example  The distance between 0 and 10 is the same as the distance between 10 and 100, which would accommodate for having lots of rooms with very little traffic.  What I'd imagine you'd need is a way to grab the traffic data, convert it in to a nice readable format in a table or something (either using ranks or log scale), then a way to generate a txt document for a room that uses the values from the table to assign XYZ coordinates to portals. Personally I have no idea how to do any of that haha. I could probably make an excel document that converts a table of absolute XYZ values in to ranks or log scale, thats about it.  edit: I'll do a doodle :)  edit: I done a doodle :)"

Collision is done by the CPU, and every triangle is calculated (which is kind of a bad way to do it, but it'll probably change in the future.) These sorts of calculations are incredibly slow to do on the CPU.  The visual model can be a good number of polygons. 50,000 will run on a potato computer, and 200,000 will run pretty well on most others. It's less the visual polycount and more the number of separate objects you have in your room that will lag it. If you have one model that's 500,000 polys, it'll run faster than 5 100,000 poly models. This is simply because the renderer has to switch between drawing each model, and set up stuff for each object that reduces draw efficiency."

If you want several people to be able to interact in Janus, you'll need to run a multiplayer server on a machine and also you could have a simple web server to serv the html/firebox code and assets. There are several different web servers you can use for this, some might even already be installed. It all depends on the os of the server machine. The multiplayer server is nodejs and can be found here To use it, you need to be able to run janus like so: ""janusvr -server my.server.ip http://my.janus.room.server"" I don't know if you can make script files like windows bat/cmd files or *nix sh/bash scripts, but that'd be a solution I guess."

Of course on the other hand, if lighting is baked on the object textures, or if the normals are messed up, the lighting=true would look weird.    It would be great if there was a quick and dirty way to specify lighting on the fly, like a mock query string or something (ie http://www.blah.com/myCoolObject.dae?lighting=false).  Don't know if that's at all possible though."
janusVR,375zfb,MrM0bius,1 point,Mon May 25 14:21:08 2015 UTC,Great point. How about this: If it has .mtl or such then it's set to false. Objects without and are just .obj by itself have default lighting.

janusVR,375zfb,JamesMcCrae,3,Mon May 25 14:50:11 2015 UTC,"So direct links have edit mode enabled, so it's easy enough to toggle the lighting.

janusVR,375zfb,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Tue May 26 00:23:47 2015 UTC,"It's easy to edit objects once someone learns how. For new and average users have problems with just bringing up the ESC menu and changing settings there. I doubt they'll know without coaching how to edit an object to change settings inside of Janus. With .obj rooms, this would not be an issue as most will visit to look at the object. However, the problem I was noticing was linking other people's objects on /r/VRobjects that were not designed with Janus in mind. A number of those (Ironman, Far Cry, Chun Li, etc) looked bad with lighting turned on. The average user will see the object, think its crap and leave. As the average user experience should be the thing we're most concerned with improving, that should trump the benefits a designer would get visiting his object file with Janus for editing purposes. The designer will likely just set up a local HTML file with additional objects to help with editing the model's appearance.  I started a pseudo campaign to bring attention to VRobjects and Janus' ability to display .obj links. Hopefully, there will be more new users giving Janus a go with that subreddit being one of the destinations. Wanted their experience to be smooth if possible."
janusVR,375zfb,sirkitree,2,Tue May 26 01:17:24 2015 UTC,"I dispute that if the geometry is set up right (faces flipped the right way, normals correct), they shouldn't look bad with lighting enabled.

janusVR,372v11,Nukemarine,2,Sun May 24 10:13:00 2015 UTC,"Short term, I believe that Janus could have a simple translated room. Near the entrance is an embedded video (or normal page if 'full screen' can be solved) on a large screen just as we'd see with image and video links. Far away out of view are screens for 3D over/under, 3D side by side and 360 sphere. At each location is a control panel that changes the view when clicked. This could be either teleports the user or replaces the screen. This could require Javascript as a simple approach.  Long term, there should be something sexy presented that displays the other things YouTube offers: video description, user comments (including their avatar faces), suggested videos, sharing and rating options. However, all that is already available as a 2D option. Hopefully by that time, Janus has other options to make this doable or maybe YouTube itself offers its own solution."

Oh also, AMD cards don't seem to work in direct mode at the moment, so be sure you're running in extended with the rift set as primary (for me I also have to make sure my main monitor is running at 75fps, which means dropping the resolution, your may not need to do this though depending on your configuration)."

janusVR,36z8sc,Lewis_P,2,Sat May 23 11:27:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know about this, I mean, the way this is handled on the web right now is with javascript. Basically any user can see a web page while it's loading and it is up to the creator to put in a loading bar (maybe a literal bar here, lol) or prevent the user from seeing anything.  I haven't messed around with it a lot yet, but does Janus have anything equivalent to document.onload for when Janus has parsed all the markup? Or window.onload for when everything is finished loading? 'Cause if those existed, you could, I don't know, put a player in an elevator or something until your lobby loaded, at least."
janusVR,36z8sc,_central_,2,Sat May 23 16:55:09 2015 UTC,"A suggestion on top of a suggestion.  When you walk out of the room, unload everything that isn't in the primary tag from memory."
janusVR,36z8sc,konchok,1 point,Sat May 23 22:50:05 2015 UTC,I don't recommend this as some will put all their assets within this tag for whatever reason. That then undermines the stability benefits of deallocation. When a room is loaded it's in cache anyway so should not be a big deal.
janusVR,36z8sc,konchok,2,Sat May 23 23:07:44 2015 UTC,"If they put all of their items in primary, then the system is the same as we have now.  If they don't we see an improvement in performance, there is literally no downside."

janusVR,36z8sc,konchok,2,Sun May 24 12:59:51 2015 UTC,"I should clarify, this only applies to rooms that have not been deallocated yet.  If you have deallocation set to one, it would still deallocate fully.  But if you had it set to 2, it would deallocate non-primary assets.

janusVR,36z8sc,dizzket,2,Mon Jun 1 20:15:31 2015 UTC,"Another thing to do would be to have something like the lowsrc attribute which let you specify a smaller version of the same image. So you could have a low poly, normal shaded model model of the room which gets loaded first, then replaced by a high detail one once it's finished loading.  As for judder, I guess all the model parsing is already in a thread (?), but you still have to move stuff onto the GPU, which might be where the dropped frames are."

I have WipeOut XL for PS1, the music is cool - prodigy even!  Even the names and logos and everything of the companies were cool in that game, like ""Feisar"" and so on :)  Really great art style.  In JavaScript, you could encode a spline for the centreline of the track, and then the player's position relative to that spline could be used to define the orientation (the roll angle as qster mentioned) and so on.  I know, I know, much easier said that done :)  If I had infinite James's I would delegate one for this task."

It isn't quite clear enough and that's something that will likely improve for the next one :) For the event, I think a couple of people were shepherding the bewildered towards the expo from time to time.  I didn't organize the event, but I think the key to doing it globally is picking a time and day that is suitable for all of the major sectors (2PM PST on a sunday seemed to work quite well). And having a start time that allows a fair amount of time before any scheduled events start (like talks) also helps."

And changes that you made were incompatible with the system. (not your fault, it's a growing platform, change is required)  For this reason, I feel that non-dynamic content should be the only thing that transfers over.  Like others have said, I also think that it would be great if you could also translate Janus code, but again only non-dynamic content."
janusVR,36vwop,Nukemarine,2,Fri May 22 15:23:26 2015 UTC,Hmmm where would the images be hosted?  Person A has a big avatar. Person B enters the room and their client detects that Person A has a large avatar. When are the three images generated? Has Person A's client done that work already and hosted them somewhere? Or does Person B's client have to download the avatar and generate the images?
janusVR,36vwop,Lewis_P,2,Fri May 22 16:43:22 2015 UTC,"It could be something the client does automatically instead of having to be hosted. It'd probably load one avatar, generate the LOD, and then move on to the next."

janusVR,36s9ie,Lewis_P,3,Thu May 21 18:38:35 2015 UTC,A number of demos use camera bounds so it seems to be something that the SDK provides.   Hopefully when the Hive and CV1 come out the need to worry about camera bounds will be a non issue for the most part. That's assuming a 15x15 walking area for client demos is more than enough.
janusVR,36s9ie,Nukemarine,2,Fri May 22 00:08:39 2015 UTC,"Well, I think there a few ways to approach this.  You coul have mulitple copies of the models around the viewpoint turned at different angles.  Then as someone views it, they don't move around, just turn in place.  So forward is a long shot of the car, turn around and you are peering in the driver window, etc.  Another is to put some prim walls up around the model.  I suggest making a sphere and wrapping it around the model. Then you have a nice collision to keep them contained.   Am I understanding the problem correctly?"
janusVR,36s9ie,gunpigEW,1 point,Thu May 21 22:42:24 2015 UTC,"Yep, those are exactly the sort of ideas I was thinking :) I was planning on having a conventional quarter scale model directly in front of the viewer when they put the headset on, so they see that and think 'oh cool'... then have a series of full scale models around them to catch them off guard when they turn around.  The problem is that without a visual indicator of the camera bounds it will be a little tricky to set up in such a way that I can guarantee that the viewer will remain in the FOV of the camera."

janusVR,36ltml,qster123,2,Wed May 20 09:53:39 2015 UTC,might want to look at creating a youtube page template that would use videojs + videojs-youtube as that can force html5 and auto-target quality settings as well.  dunno how it would behave with the 360 videos from youtube though.

janusVR,36gz37,qster123,2,Tue May 19 10:29:56 2015 UTC,"Hmm.  You are describing parameterized models, and proposing all avatars follow some set of standard parameters.  The main problem with this is that someone may wish to create a model/avatar that doesn't follow this standard (e.g. everyone is a spaceship instead of a biped).  That said, having rooms/worlds where the parameterized models can differ, and being able to set those parameters interactively and save them for later visits, that could be cool."
janusVR,36gz37,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Tue May 19 23:20:43 2015 UTC,The idea is to have the parameters setup by users client side then optionally be usable by servers/sites when managing avatars. If someone wants to have spaceship avatars they can just ignore the parameters. For this kind of avatar managment to get any traction long term it would need to be done client side.
janusVR,36gz37,Lewis_P,1 point,Wed May 20 00:34:08 2015 UTC,"Sounds interesting. So you would have an array of avatar parts to choose from. Perhaps a simple numbering system might do it.  Nose: 3, Eyes: 5, Hair: 2, Mouth: 6, Torso: 2, Legs: 8, etc.   As long as the order of parts remained constant, the avatar creation could result in a single number; 352628 in this case.  In a default room/server these numbers would load the corresponding hard-coded avatar parts, resulting in your vanilla avatar that you built. However, room creators/server owners could prescribe custom parts to these numbers in order to inflict a 'theme' on the user.  edit: I think this would be nice as an addition to the ability to straight up load in your own prebuilt avatar if you want to. I think room creators should probably be give the ability to override what the avatars in their room looks like if they want to."

janusVR,36b2uv,JamesMcCrae,4,Mon May 18 01:52:59 2015 UTC,"hmm... I did a bit of research, and it looks like the issue might be because webGL is disabled by default in Chrome for linux. Do any of the examples on this site load for you? I'll definitely try to fix the error message at least :P"
janusVR,36b2uv,JamesMcCrae,3,Mon May 18 06:03:25 2015 UTC,"WebGL seems to be working (all those examples work).  Some separate configuration for enabling WebGL for addons maybe?  (Or perhaps there's an incompatibility with plugins between Chrome and Chromium?  I'm using Chromium 41.0 64-bit).  My hunch was that the errors halt the plugin's execution somehow.  But you know what, save yourself the trouble doing troubleshooting on this - I'm sure it works awesome on Windows or with Chrome, I'm just being fussy :)"

It'd also be cool to be able to click on portals, and maybe even have a list of the portals in the room next to the screen."
janusVR,36b2uv,Lewis_P,2,Mon May 18 00:11:06 2015 UTC,"yeah, I know about the issue with commented rooms. I'd like to fix it at some point, but it makes parsing the html a bit more difficult, so I haven't gotten around to supporting them yet. I'd also like to do something about links, I hadn't thought about giving a list of links. That might be useful"
janusVR,36b2uv,dizzket,2,Mon May 18 05:54:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's a lot of potential in this sort of thing. It's almost like a bridge between the metaverse and the internet. Can't wait to see where it goes :D"
janusVR,36b2uv,qster123,3,Mon May 18 06:04:08 2015 UTC,This has so much potential. Would it be possible to embed previews like this on to websites?

janusVR,36bfya,qster123,2,Mon May 18 06:52:24 2015 UTC,thanks mate
janusVR,36bfya,NXT_Aussie,6,Mon May 18 07:07:12 2015 UTC,"Great show!  Top Feature request for JanusVR: VOIP and management tools to go with it. I'd say hold off on anything else new until we get something that can work in game.  I understand it will be a challenge. It ain't easy.  I'd suggest making ghosts that are labeled ""follow me to the lecture hall""--basically robot ushers.  If you want to get fancy you could have a switch in JS that triggers them to start ushing.  Looking forward to the next one!"
janusVR,36bfya,gunpigEW,3,Mon May 18 03:51:41 2015 UTC,"Here are the top four suggestions that are considered mandatory for Janus VR development based on mumble discussions over the last few days.   Voice communication out of the box (VOIP). Noted as a missing element that is standard in the other social vr programs. While Mumble is useful (ex: we can still chat even if Janus crashes), it also requires new users to know how to install and set-up a third party program. Individual user Javascript support. This will help with custom user interface and remove the burden from James having to implement it in direct code.  CSS for VR. Central made a detailed post on this. This can help alleviate the need for translators coded directly in Janus. IIRC could this be like grease monkey scripts from way back when? Desktop access inside of Janus. James mentioned he's working on this. If successful, this can be a killer user interface that removes the need to remove the headset for tasks."
janusVR,36bfya,vulkare,3,Mon May 18 03:59:43 2015 UTC,"I strongly agree with gunpigEW. I thought the concept and execution of the show was really great, but my experience was totally brought down dealing with Mumble. I popped in casually, having not used JanusVR for two weeks. I definitely was interested in the Expo, as that is quite refreshing and innovative. The first of it's kind in VR. However, as a casual user, I was not familiar with the inns and outs of the issues of dealing with Mumble. First off, my frame rate dropped horribly whenever Mumble was running. Without Mumble, I got a silky smooth 75fps. But when it runs, it consistently dropped to about 60fps, introducing judder and choppiness. I do have a good card, the GTX 970 with an Intel Core-i7 and 8 gigs of RAM ( I meet the recommended requirements for CV1, just announced by Oculus ). In the Expo, when it came time for questions and answers, I spent 15 minutes asking people how to fix the issues I was having. This is a bit destracting to them and myself as we would all rather focus on the expo itself. I tried the suggested tips such as disabling layers, but it didnt help at all. The next problem is that as soon as I went in, I could here everyone talking no matter if I was close to them, or even in the same room. I later found out there is a way to configure it to interact with the game to take distance into account, but I failed to set that up. I messed with it for 10 minutes then gave up. When you compare that to something like VR-Chat, where you go in and it all ""just works"", it's a night and day difference. I know you are all completely aware of the need for built in VOIP, so I just put this here as an illustration of the problems that can happen. Other than that, I did really liked the Expo and am pretty excited by how well it was put together and look forward to more events like that!"
janusVR,36bfya,Lewis_P,4,Mon May 18 14:30:50 2015 UTC,"I had a great time at the Expo last night, spent over 6 hours in the DK2 (~7PM to ~2AM). Plus I finally spoke (briefly) to some of you guys. I've got a lot of thoughts on how it went, so I've consolidate them all in to this post. Overall I thought the event was a massive success, any criticism is only an effort to make the next one even better :) I've split my feedback in to separate topics that others can use to structure their feedback if they want.  The Venue  The centre looked fantastic. The lighting was effective (both the artificial lights and the sunlight coming through in places). The entrance area was informative. The map presented an excellent overview of the space though it would benefit from additional labels. If it were possible to set a portal to be spherical, the map could be a live feed of the room including mini attendees walking around. The centre itself could be a little taller next time, maybe even multi-levelled. The added height would increase the sense of awe. The individual 'youtube clip' rooms felt a little redundant, I'm sure in the future they could be used to greater effect for showing off particular stands in 'private' booths. The general layout seemed to work fine, though could have benefited from a more linear route (like an Ikea store). This would ensure that every stand was seen by every attendee. Minor issues with loading for some (pink walls), possibly caused by the addition of so many avatars, or the 4k textures. Could consider the use of placeholder geometry that would load in immediately then be occluded by the real model once it loads. This would prevent people from having to enter an entirely empty expo centre while it loads.  The Stands  The stands were an excellent idea. They did a great job of creating the 'expo vibe'. They could be a little taller, around 2 meters (though I'm 6 foot 3 in real life so tend to have an avatar around that height). I'm not sure that the small websurface podiums at each stand were effective and some were reporting that the youtube clips were not working (probably a codec/flash issue).  The Comms  Mumble seemed to not cause too many problems. There was talk about the overlay causing slow down for some. There were a couple of instances of people saying in chat; 'how do I actually hear the lecture?', which suggests that more needs to be done to inform users some how. I think there is a strong case for a 'first-user setup mode', that introduces the player to the basics, allows them to change their name and avatar, and instructs them on how to install mumble. Having built-in voice in the future would certainly resolve many of the problems with people talking over each other and the required segregation. That said, the splitting off in to separate voice channels to join discussions with the individual speakers worked better than I thought it would. The text chat became flooded at times, could consider; press C for local chat, C again for global chat, third time to hide chatlog.  The Talks  The talks were informative and engaging. There were some very minor griefing issues with mouse cursors on the stage during the talks. Not a big deal, but worth mentioning. I thought the splitting in to separate groups worked better than I expected, though it may be better to have it set up with multiple speakers on the stage at once after the main talks, then you'd get the familiar ""I have a question for James..."" from the attendees during Q&A.  The Attendees  The general atmosphere was friendly and calm throughout aside from some mildly heated discussions about the nature of the metaverse during the 'after party' haha. The size of the lecture venue was just right for the quantity of attendees. The quantity of avatars was causing crashes for some, could consider introducing a file size cap on avatars. I returned to the main lobby on occasion and it always had users wandering around, I wonder how many missed the event as they did not know to click the 'special event' door. Is the graphic on that door hard-coded? Could it link to a /door.png that can be updated for these events?  Overall  A definite success and I can't wait for the next one.

janusVR,36bfya,NXT_Aussie,3,Mon May 18 09:43:18 2015 UTC,"Great turnout, servers ran nicely.  The next event we hold will be better."
janusVR,36bfya,Alarmed_Ferret,3,Mon May 18 01:37:30 2015 UTC,"Given the conference setting, here's some things that were noted:   Instead of the traditional lecture hall have a more circular, stadium seating layout. The chairs are sort of a good idea to give a good reference on where to stand your avatar. Most people did seem to use the seat location even though it wasn't necessary. If a screen needs to be used, place it ""behind"" the presenter and offer a Javascript autofacing feature. That way, to everyone viewing, they have the perfect view of the screen no matter where they sit. Have a clock or clocks visible to presenters and viewers. It's easy to get distracted in VR and social events like these may overlap other events. As noted today, all the presenters were running against the clock and not realizing it. Temp hack solution: Telling people to suspend multiplayer temporarily while loading rooms. At the end of the conference people went off into different groups. It might be good to design a room at the conference where there are three or more sectioned areas for further discussion with presenters. A simple instruction sign at each area can tell the mumble channel and who the presenter is.  At the conference ""map"", have numbers in the areas. Off to the side, tell what events are in those areas. Maybe a javascript to teleport to the area if a player clicks on that number. If ""on ESC"" is available in js, have the map appear behind players when they access the ESC menu again with clickable teleport. For Q/A, have microphone stands set up. Can help with queuing and getting to everyone's questions."
janusVR,36bfya,NXT_Aussie,2,Mon May 18 01:56:39 2015 UTC,I like the microphone stand suggestion. It was a little confusing on who was speaking and when it was your turn.

janusVR,366c0e,sirkitree,3,Sat May 16 16:06:49 2015 UTC,"What if you created a ghost by scrolling through preset head and body selections? Then all the user would have to do is ctrl+RMB to change their avatar, and it would allow them to customize it as well. And then we don't have to worry about saving out a text file or anything"
janusVR,366c0e,CrusaderOfMan,3,Sun May 17 03:53:33 2015 UTC,"I do like that idea, but it's still fairly limited. We do have quite a decent collection of avatars already, but I don't see this as a major step up from going to a chibi room (for example) and ctrl+clicking. But it would be a step in the right direction!"
janusVR,366c0e,konchok,2,Sun May 17 13:48:23 2015 UTC,I had an idea a while back where using blend-shapes you would be able to create a unique body & a unique face.  But for it to work you would need a way to export a blended shape into a model.  Here is how I see something like this working.  You go into a character creation room. Change the features for the face. Change the features for the body.  When they're finished use the blend percentages as input to php to create the object.  Store the object at VRsites which then can be used as a pre-made avatar.
janusVR,366c0e,konchok,1 point,Sat May 16 21:25:24 2015 UTC,"I haven't messed with blend shapes at all yet, but I can appreciate the idea. THe first part sounds the hardest, and having tools within Janus to manipulate blend shapes is certainly beyond me, but I wonder if there are any webgl took that do this... /me searches"
janusVR,366c0e,Lewis_P,1 point,Sat May 16 22:42:03 2015 UTC,I can do all the local javascript for the blendshapes if you can find a way to export the blendshapes into a single model.
janusVR,366c0e,konchok,1 point,Sat May 16 23:55:51 2015 UTC,"Could the values associated with the blendshape variant that the player has created be somehow incorporated in to the userid.txt rather than requiring exporting? Everyone would have the same avatar model, just with different blendshape values to create their unique variant."
janusVR,366c0e,aLuzh3n,2,Sun May 17 00:29:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it would require that each of the model variants are included which will bloat the player avatar size.    Edit 1: I feel like there's a future opportunity to compress blend shapes for all vertices that are identical between models.   Edit 2: I might be able to break the model into pieces (static pieces vs blended pieces) for example, (because I can't think of a better example)breast size, female avatars may want to be able to set breast size.  So you could make the body excluding breasts, and a variety of breasts to adjust size, shape, etc.  You use nested objects to apply the breasts correctly and you don't have excess vertices for the rest of the model."
janusVR,3667ms,sirkitree,2,Sat May 16 15:24:09 2015 UTC,"Cross-platform support is high on my priority list, and it doesn't seem the 0.6 SDK release supports Mac or Linux any more.  So until it does, it might be a while before I update the SDK version to support layers and so on."
janusVR,3667ms,JamesMcCrae,2,Sun May 17 04:08:26 2015 UTC,It hurts to hear them dropping Mac/Linux support after you put so much work into the ports S:

janusVR,3667ms,qster123,1 point,Sun May 17 10:32:11 2015 UTC,"I could technically update the Windows version to 0.6 and then have some branches in the code to use the right SDK version function calls (0.5 or 0.6) and so on.  This alone wouldn't be a big deal.  The problem with the above is that the versions become more different as I add in features which are exclusively supported by the new 0.6 and Windows.  Don't want to add ""features"" to Janus' spec that are unsupported on specific platforms - this is not good.  In an ideal world, Janus would perform equally well and features would be equally supported on each platform (I've already done a pile of work for this to be the case, and even ignoring this SDK fragmentation issue, there's still far more work to be done - e.g. no blendshapes yet and other graphics issues on OSX due to my use of OpenGL compatibility profile)."
janusVR,3667ms,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Sun May 17 20:18:20 2015 UTC,"Ah, right. I do remember that being mentioned. In that case, we might want to tell people somehow they should be on the pre-0.6 firmware."
janusVR,3667ms,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Sun May 17 13:45:46 2015 UTC,"The way forward is to continue with the latest 0.6 SDK for Windows, and continue to the link to the 0.5.0.1 for the other OSs.  However, I'm hesitant about adding features exclusively supported by 0.6 because this causes even greater differences between OS (both in terms of the code diverging, and the behaviour/experience users get being OS dependent)."

janusVR,3658h6,NXT_Aussie,3,Sat May 16 06:55:57 2015 UTC,Very cool (and polished video too!)
janusVR,3658h6,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Sat May 16 11:12:28 2015 UTC,"Glad you like it :) I've been thinking more about whether it would be possible to have this set up so that it can be interacted with without requiring a controller (you just walk around in circles in the real world). For this to work, janus would require a mode where the body stays roughly underneath you when you walk around, otherwise you'd leave it behind. I guess the current solution is to hide avatar and the future solution would probably require animation, but is there some middle ground?"
janusVR,3658h6,Lewis_P,2,Sat May 16 11:52:16 2015 UTC,"Cute, nice work!"

janusVR,35xg13,Lewis_P,3,Thu May 14 09:24:29 2015 UTC,"Yesterday I wrote this where I mentioned issues about the feeling of being trapped when using a websurface. Then I went in to janus and immediately found a new player stuck next to websurface. They had clicked the surface, become immobilised because the surface had grabbed their mouse and keyboard and they didn't know what had happened and were unable to ask for help. I informed them that they needed to right click to esc the grasp of the websurface and then they were free of their shackles and thanked me.  I think a visual indication is neccessary to inform players of where their mouse and keyboard focus is. Not sure exactly how it would work but a way of dimming everything apart from the websurface would be ideal.  (please excuse the weird textures in the GIF, the lobby is evidently too heavy for my little macbook air to handle)"
janusVR,35xg13,Nukemarine,2,Thu May 14 09:28:32 2015 UTC,"I'll add that a message ""Press ESC or Right Mouse Button to escape webview"" shown above the webview (or maybe at a location 1m in front and .5m above the player) in addition to this would be great.  We do fall into the trap of knowing how to navigate Janus that we forget new people might get easily confused through no fault of their own."
janusVR,35xg13,Atari_Historian,3,Thu May 14 10:23:51 2015 UTC,Yep and it is all too easy to think that issues are resolved by directly instructing the person who brings up the problem in a reply on reddit. Telling someone on reddit that they need to do xyz to resolve their problem is fine for that person but does nothing to prevent the problem arising for future users.
janusVR,35xg13,dizzket,2,Thu May 14 11:46:23 2015 UTC,Yep and it is all too easy to think that issues are resolved by directly instructing the person who brings up the problem in a reply on reddit.   THIS.  Treating them as user education issues is something that is unlikely to scale well. They're pointing out underlying issues.
janusVR,35xg13,Atari_Historian,3,Thu May 14 16:39:24 2015 UTC,"Another idea is to just not lock the player movement unless you've clicked on a text field, and show the cursor at wherever you're looking."
janusVR,35xg13,dizzket,1 point,Thu May 14 18:43:32 2015 UTC,How would you handle a case like the JanusVR FAQ (right of spawn) where you want to scroll down on the initial page without actually selecting the contents?
janusVR,35xg13,Atari_Historian,2,Thu May 14 18:50:00 2015 UTC,"You'd still have to click down to select contents, but the 2D cursor would just be on whatever websurface you were looking at. If you wanted to scroll down, you'd just use the mousewheel, or click on the down button on the right side of the page."
janusVR,35xg13,Atari_Historian,2,Thu May 14 18:59:12 2015 UTC,"In addition you could make it so that if the player gaze leaves the websurface by a significant amount, it is deselected returning control to the player.  Gaze detection in general would open up a lot of potential. 'on_look' coding would probably be useful :)"
janusVR,35xg13,Atari_Historian,2,Thu May 14 11:11:20 2015 UTC,"I hope that diverse views are welcome, because I'm seeing this from a different angle. (It doesn't seem to contradict your proposal, though.)  When I was in the lobby, I clicked on doors. I clicked on a weird sign that turned out to be a door. I clicked on the clock. I clicked on paintings. I clicked on signs. Most of that made sense. But when I clicked on a list of who was currently logged onto JanusVR, all of the sudden, I lost control. I was booby trapped.  From my perspective, I had no way of knowing that this particular sign was based on a different form of technology (HTML), and ultimately, as a pure user, I'm not sure that I really should care what the underlying technology is. This could just as easily been a GIF. Why do I even want to interact with this sign?  If this is something that I might want to capture my mouse and interact with, then that should be indicated to me as I look around, rather than have me play the guessing game of what is or isn't interactive.  So that's something that I though wouldn't be interactive, but it turned out to be interactive, apparently based upon the underlying technology used to present it (HTML).   On the opposite side, we have the Janus VR FAQ. I had no idea that was an interactive object that I could scroll down on. If I had known that, I would have wanted to scroll down and see more. But that wasn't advertised to me.  So:   The decision of what is or isn't interactive should probably be divorced from the underlying technology (if it isn't already -- I am a Janus newbie making assumptions here) We need to advertise (to someone who is looking around) what is or isn't interactive on their screen. No booby traps (unless intentionally done as an effect)."
janusVR,35xg13,Atari_Historian,1 point,Thu May 14 17:04:11 2015 UTC,"Yep, what you are talking about is a websurface (the same websurface shown in my gif in fact). So when you clicked on it, it took control of your mouse and keyboard, completely immobilising you. This is the exact problem I'm trying to figure out ways of addressing :)  Ultimately content creators are in control of what they want their rooms to look like. They can put websurfaces anywhere they want to and cause all sorts of booby traps. The question is what can be done to help the users;  Option A is to try and inform all content developers that their rooms should make websurfaces clear. This is an ok solution, but certainly not scalable.  Option B is to embed a visual cue in to janusvr so that users are always aware of when they are interacting with a websurface. My proposed solution here helps when people have accidently clicked a websurface by dimming the rest of the world around the surface, an additional measure may be necessary to help users understand that what they are about to click on is a websurface (changing the cursor like 2D web browsers do, for example)"
janusVR,35xg13,samrudloff,1 point,Thu May 14 17:23:41 2015 UTC,"Option C is to embed a visual cue in to janusvr so that users are always aware of what is an interactive object, and to further indicate when they are interacting with a websurface.  I'm fine with what you propose as a way to indicate what is being controlled and the scope of that control. What I'd also want to see is a way to visually represent what can be controlled.  An example would be an automatic glow/outline (or some other distinction around or near the borders of interactive objects) to indicate their nature -- just through sight alone. Have the ability for a room's designer to disable that feature is just fine when it doesn't fit with the room's artistic direction. They're on their own to come up with a different scheme.  I wouldn't mind the cursor changing to let the user know that they are on top of an interactive object. But I'm not excited about feeling my way around the environment if that is the sole means of communicating what is or isn't interactive. I think that it is an additional part of the solution.  EDIT: Possible ninja edit on the last paragraph. Hopefully done before you see this and reply."

Test room here  I've gone back through the versions that I have and it looks like it may have been introduced between 41.0 and 42.0. The slow down is not present in 41.0. I don't have any of the versions between so I can't narrow it down any further than that.  edit: i think this bug explains why the dinosaur scaled drawings room is completely unusable (for me).

janusVR,35wjyo,Lewis_P,2,Thu May 21 07:18:09 2015 UTC,Fixed!  Will be in 42.6 when it releases.  The problem was that paragraph textures were updating every frame (a bug introduced when adding ability to change text dynamically with JS)

janusVR,35wjyo,Lewis_P,1 point,Thu May 14 04:50:33 2015 UTC,Or you could have a warning dialogue of some sort if Rift mode is on.
janusVR,35wjyo,Nukemarine,2,Thu May 14 06:50:35 2015 UTC,"I think I agree with the concerns of the others. A button that pulls you to your desktop and opens the directory is fine for a desktop program, but feels odd in VR. You almost need a desktop viewer like virtual desktop, within janus... That way you wouldn't need to exit the program. I'd imagine this might take a fair bit of work though :/  An alternative solution could be to add a shortcut to the settings folder inside the janus root folder. So when people go snooping around for the userid.txt file they will likely stumble across the shortcut that takes you there. I have done this myself just because I can never remember where the settings folder is :)"
janusVR,35wjyo,qster123,3,Thu May 14 09:05:59 2015 UTC,"This is a great idea. Create a shortcut to the user's roaming JanusVR folder since it'll also have bookmarks, userid and workspace files as well in there.  Until desktop interaction can occur inside of Janus, it's best not to have anything that exits Janus VR while using the Rift."
janusVR,35wjyo,qster123,1 point,Thu May 14 10:08:43 2015 UTC,Same as Firefox said but you'll also need to delete your settings.txt file as the settings button position conflicts with the show help button.

janusVR,35u5f8,Atari_Historian,5,Wed May 13 15:11:34 2015 UTC,"CLARIFICATION:  When I talk about the Second Life problem, what I mean is this --  Second Life had a single interface that tried to serve the needs of two different communities at the same time.  The first is what I would define as the standard user community, which is those who consume the content that everyone else makes. Their experience is that they want to run around and look at things and interact with things.  The second is the builder community which actually creates the content. They might want to do the same thing, but they also need to be able to build things.  Because Second Life chose the same interface to serve both group's needs, they ended up where these kind of problems usually go. They throw in the minimum needs of each group into a single interface. Then they pile a few more goodies on top of that. The normal users got the shaft with the unnecessary complexity that was needed by the other group..  So, I think, what I'm asking is this:  Do we have the right interface which meets the needs of someone who just wants to browse contents? We need to treat these users as a different group. Are the clicks, displays, and other commands geared towards that group? Does a normal user need a mouse that is distinct from headlook?  We also need to recognize that normal users are going to need more hand-holding than the content developers. They are not going to want to edit their avatar in a text file. They are confused and distracted by irrelevant options. They just want to have fun early on with a very shallow learning curve.  So, the direction that I'm pointing you in is:  1 - Create a distinct user interface for the everyday user. (If this informs you to make changes in your developer interface, that's fine too.) Strip away all distractions. Make easy navigation the #1 priority, followed by world and user interaction.  2 - Add functionality which hand-holds users in performing basic tasks (like avatar creation, as mentioned)."
janusVR,35u5f8,Nukemarine,3,Wed May 13 22:36:24 2015 UTC,I had discussed this near the beginning of Janus/FireBox switchover. Here's the reddit post I submitted though there was not much discussion on it at that time.   I agree that there should be a simple interaction mode then the more complicated designer mode and maybe a troubleshooting mode. The ESC menu for instance is offering lots of options but really those should be hidden until a player selects the appropriate interaction mode.
janusVR,35u5f8,Lewis_P,2,Thu May 14 16:14:26 2015 UTC,"This relates to distilling the description of what janusVR is aiming to be. What it is trying to achieve is complex, but that does not mean the experience should be complex. There should be a stripped down default mode that allows for a clear core functionality and an advance mode that unlocks the full potential of it."
janusVR,35u5f8,Lewis_P,1 point,Wed May 13 22:49:26 2015 UTC,"This relates to distilling the description of what janusVR is aiming to be.   This hasn't been nailed down? Okay, I recall the previous post on this topic. I have a long-winded way of getting to that point, but I agree.  I see that the previous discussion got pretty low-level. I'm wondering what the thoughts are on a high level? So, just my looking around at what JanusVR is today...  I would currently categorize what I see as a something I would call a Creativity and Content Metaverse. Or perhaps a Content Exploration Metaverse. So, it would be the same category as Second Life or High Fidelity... but distinctly different in design. The focus is on creating environments and visual contents to be shared with others.  When I call it a ""Creativity and Content Metaverse"", you might compare that to a hypothetical Experience Metaverse, Social Metaverse, Mixed Reality Metaverse, or even a Commercial Metaverse.   Other than the tension of the underlying goals, there is not reason why something can't be placed in more than one category. But at the same time, a Metaverse could emerge from one of those perpsectives, but still have elements of a Creativity and Content, Experiences, Social interaction, Mixed Reality, and Commercial focus.  So I'm starting to stray from the initial point. But that's how I view how JanusVR fits into the Metaverse spectrum (assuming that some sort of Metaverse experience is the goal here).  What are the thoughts on the scope/design/intent of this project?"
janusVR,35u5f8,Lewis_P,1 point,Thu May 14 15:49:13 2015 UTC,"I'm sure James has got a pretty good vision for the 'space' he sees janusVR occupying. The challenge is in effectively communicating that vision to the users while the manifestation of that vision is still under development.   It's easy to forget that Janus is continually evolving. I agree that it currently portrays a predominately 'creativity and content' based experience to its users. But that is mainly because that is what the community has focused its efforts on developing. There are some commercial aspects that are on the horizon with the casino room, banner ads as posters and a couple of efforts to create storefront style rooms. It doesn't feel as 'socially' focussed as something like vrchat, but I think that is probably because janusvr doesn't have built in voice chat yet. This cross discipline potential for janusvr presents a challenge during development because it can cause it to appear to be the master of none.  I like to remind myself of the parallels to 2d web browsers. When you're visiting your favourite website, you are not thinking about the fact that you are using chrome, your mind is occupied by the content of the website and the experience that the website is providing. I'm hopeful that the same will be true of the metaverse one day. JanusVR is not the metaverse, it's the shoes you wear when you want to go out and explore the metaverse. Just like chrome is the browser you use to explore the internet."

When you say browsing do you mean browsing the spaces in Janus? While content on VR Sites and Dizzkets wikiverse is indexed and searchable there is no way to currently jump to other places except via portals - an instant teleportation system when using a web surface would be great.  If you could paste your userid.txt file into pastebin.com and put the link here we'll be able to fix that.  Shift-tab is an excellent idea.  Yes other people will see the portal you create, it will show the url and who created it. People that join Janus afterwards will not see the portal."

But VOIP integration is difficult, so who knows when it'll be added.   Understood.  Be aware that you probably have had all sorts of users holding down ALT and saying all things into their microphones and wondering why everyone is ignoring them. Obviously, that's a bad experience.  It should be easy to whip up up some code to inform the user. If the user presses ALT, detect if a mumble process is currently running. If not, inform them that they're talking into dead air. It would be nice to lead them to instructions to install/enable mumble.  It is probably not worth bothering to see if mumble is currently configured and actively working unless that turns out to be drop-dead easy. Just the detection and the message should be a relatively easy change that provide value to new users. (Or experienced users who forgot to start Mumble or accidentally killed it.)  Or run the detection and display the message upon start-up."

Someone has suggested in the past a method of opening an 'incognito' portal, which is probably a good idea (though it would add even further to the inherent complexity of janusvr). Portals are all public with the exception of your bookmarks room, which is sort of pseudo public, I think people can enter your bookmarks, but will see their own bookmarks."

janusVR,35u5f8,_central_,1 point,Wed May 13 22:58:43 2015 UTC,"Portals are always public when you are in multiplayer    Consistency is good. No argument.  I think my only remaining concern is a really small one. Assuming that I'm understanding the interface correctly, we're giving a griefer the power to block access to an important portal with their own portals. Here is an example.  Not a big concern today, but later down the road, it is going to be a problem.  This could be mitigated with some logic to make sure that a personal portal either doesn't block another portal [harder to code], or simply isn't too close to an existing portal [easier to code]."
janusVR,35u5f8,_central_,1 point,Thu May 14 02:15:44 2015 UTC,"This griefing method is certainly possible. At this stage in janus development I'd be cautious of mitigating too much for potential problems such as these. You can end up stifling developing and adding even more complexity to the core experience. There are other such issues like the ability to delete people's portals as they create them or fill the room with portals or delete the floor out from underneath people in some cases or have a big cock as an avatar or spam the chat with advertising or stalk people by following them around. All of these are potential detrimental factors to user experience. In time I'm confident janus will evolve to a point where many of these issues are naturally eliminated either through streamlining of processes, increases in room creator controls or some other currently unknown method.  As for the solution to the exact issue you mentioned (placing portals in front of portals), with edit mode on the user can simply delete the portal that is in there way. I know this isn't a very good solution as it requires the user to take action in response to a griefer (which is usually exactly what a griefer wants), but it's a step in the right direction. An alternative solution could be a 'safe mode' where you can only enter portals that you create yourself, or are part of the room."

At this stage in janus development I'd be cautious of mitigating too much for potential problems such as these. You can end up stifling developing and adding even more complexity to the core experience.    I respect your view, but my information security training tells me that security is best done proactive, and not reactive (often in response to one event or an ongoing series of events). I would encourage JanusVR developers to address this and other in-world issues early on.  I understand if this is not a popular view."
janusVR,35u5f8,dizzket,2,Thu May 14 14:45:23 2015 UTC,Oh you're right. I think there is a difference between security based issues and general griefing. Every effort should be made throughout development to ensure the program is secure and safe to use. I guess I was thinking more about jokesters and pranksters rather than hackers when I wrote that trying to mitigate for them can stifle development.
janusVR,35u5f8,_central_,2,Thu May 14 14:49:21 2015 UTC,"Actually, we still differ. :)  I'd roll the exploit of in-world conditions (for griefing) under the umbrella of security considerations. They are of a different form, and I'll be the first to admit that they're not as critical as code vulnerabilities. But they still should be addressed early on.  No denying that in-app abuse is is a much stickier topic when you're talking about a virtual world. There is the underlying tension of wanting to give everyone a hammer so they can build something, but at the same time, not use that same hammer to bash other people's skulls in. :)"
janusVR,35u5f8,qster123,2,Thu May 14 15:05:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, empowering people without limitations results in anarchy haha. You're right it is a balancing act between providing power and limiting the effect of that power on others. I'm just super cautious when it comes to discussing what limitations should be applied and how they are going to be applied because of the risks; primarily the added complexity and confusion that they often bring.  I consider the ability to hard lock rooms to be a successful way of dealing with a problem of this ilk. People were capable of blocking player's paths in the lobby, so content creators were given the power to lock the room to prevent players from spawning objects. This works because it doesn't feel like the player has lost their power to create objects, it feels more like their ability simply doesn't work in that room. Like their power has been temporarily suppressed rather than removed.   However, consider the problem of players placing portals in front of other portals to cause people to accidentally access their content. There are a number of ways I can think of to get around this problem; limit whether other people can see custom portals (either through a toggle in the esc menu or a room based rule for content creators), or you could limit how close together portals can be placed to one another, or you could allow content creators to allocate zones in which portals can not be created. All of these options may resolve the problem, but they run the risk of feeling restrictive to those who are not trying to grief."
janusVR,35u5f8,Lewis_P,2,Thu May 14 15:24:23 2015 UTC,"Ensuring that janusvr is intuitive is a difficult challenge. The community has had discussion in the past about this (here for example).  As you alluded to, new users are dropped directly in to the world without being informed of what the purpose of the experience is. They can figure out how to text chat, but are not sure whether it is global. They can speak using left alt like it says in the instructions but it only works if they have mumble, which they probably don't. They can create portals but are not informed of whether they are public or not. I think a custom 'first time user' interface is probably necessary allowing you to enter your name, pick an avatar and informing you of the basics perhaps using something similar to the tutorial room. This alone would allow new users to feel more connected to janus and give them time to settle in to what the experience is all about.  A lot of the tutorial and esc menu elements could probably be handled by websurfaces allowing for text entry. However I believe there is something off about the current model for interacting with websurfaces in janus and I have an idea of what it might be. I believe Janus has a learning curve that is detrimental to user experience. When you click on a websurface you give up control of your body position and orientation in favor of navigating the 2D site. This is not communicated to the user. It essentially paralyses you causing you to be completely immobilized until you right click again. The same sensation occurs when you press TAB to enter a URL or T to chat, you are left immobilized. I believe this can cause confusion for first time users who are prone to getting stuck in these instances. I think a simple visual indication that a websurface is active would alleviate this problem (something as simple as a glowing highlight around the surface that currently has your mouse and keyboard would probably be enough)."
janusVR,35u5f8,Lewis_P,3,Wed May 13 18:39:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, a start-up wizard would make a great addition. Like when you start chrome or firefox, they'll do the little tutorial thing saying:   ""Here's your bookmarks, settings, homepage. Clicking this will do that, etc.""  You know, just things that pop up on your HUD and tell you what's up when you boot for the first time. It would make a dramatic difference to the initiation of new users."
janusVR,35u5f8,BlueSatoshi,3,Wed May 13 20:48:34 2015 UTC,"I've suggested in the past that a sort of tag based hud overlay is used that can be activated through gaze to inform the user. Like this sort of thing. For first time users this could display instructions in context. You look at another player, it informs you of their name and that you can press T to chat to them. You look at a portal and it tells you where it leads and that you can click it to open it. This sort of thing :)"
janusVR,35u5f8,MrM0bius,3,Wed May 13 21:08:26 2015 UTC,"That sounds really useful even for not-new users!  Maybe certain items would have default info they would always display (other players and doors, like you said). And when you first booted up, there would be ones about the basic functions.   Maybe there could be a title attribute, same as html, for other stuff?"
janusVR,35u5f8,MrM0bius,1 point,Wed May 13 21:37:20 2015 UTC,"When you click on a websurface you give up control of your body position and orientation in favor of navigating the 2D site. This is not communicated to the user.    Good observation -- I don't like the feel of it when that happens. And putting on my new user hat, it adds to the confusion."
janusVR,35u5f8,FireFoxG,2,Wed May 13 19:23:25 2015 UTC,"Up until now, I thought that a portal was a doorway shaped item or a tall oval. Now that I clicked on ""Special EVENT"" in the spawn room, I just realized that I have absolutely no idea what is or isn't a connector to another room.  My mind is blown (and not in a great way). Anything can potentially be something that leads me into another room, like the wall that has a list of who's online.  As a new user, non-standard room entrances confuse me. I need to have a way of clearly understanding what is or isn't a room.  FWIW: It just so happens that I'm currently writing a general guide on the topic of portals. Unfortunately, the part about the graphical representation of the portals will probably will have to be broken up into a second part. But one important aspect seems to be a clear visualization of what is a portal and where it is going.  EDIT: The list of users that was online also demonstrated something that is bad from an interface perspective, I clicked on the list of who is online and all of the sudden, I lost mouse control. This didn't happen when I clicked on other areas of the screen, so I have no idea what made this area special, then as a new user, I have to fight to regain control of my ability to look around again. That was a bad experience."
janusVR,35u5f8,konchok,3,Wed May 13 19:10:33 2015 UTC,"Example:  Show a random person this image and ask them to identify the rooms that they can click on to enter.  Now show a random person this other image and ask them to do the same.  If they're having trouble (and they probably are), it is because there isn't a constant visual metaphor for them to grab onto. Without that, they lack the context to understand the world around them."
janusVR,35u5f8,STEALTHM0UNTAIN,4,Wed May 13 19:17:04 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with this, and I'm not a new user. Often when I'm wandering around, I'll be clicking on random things just to see if it's a portal.   I don't think having a visual modifier on portals is a great answer though, as that can ruin the look of a room. A cursor might be a better indicator. Something that turns into a door on portals and a pointer on clickable items."
janusVR,35u5f8,Lewis_P,2,Wed May 13 20:42:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Consistent visual language is vital, especially in the lobby area. In other contexts, content creators should be able to set portals to whatever suits the aesthetic they are trying to achieve (like the vr bar for example). Maybe portals should glow when they are directly looked at to indicate that they lead somewhere."

You can also set lighting to false and just bake the lighting yourself, it does make the textures large, but it generally looks really nice.    You could just set up the sketchup2room shaders manually if you want, the automated system still works nicely if you're models are in skechup, but you can also just manually assign the shader enter the position/col/strength/etc values directly into the shader file (look at the very bottom section, under all the functions, set lighting or something like that)."

We have these vr web browsers here in their infancy, and to make the web treat them like web browsers, we'll need them all to be able to parse the same markups, and use markup as close to what the current web uses."
janusVR,35s76u,Wiiplay123,1 point,Sat May 23 17:11:50 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, it's like you ripped the idea from my head and actually made some sense out of it all! I'm not a true web developer, but I have a passion for the potential of VR and changing the way the internet works. With only a VERY basic introduction to HTML and a decent knowledge of C++, I've leveraged the possibilities JanusVR allows and at some point along the way, things seemed as though they could be simpler.  Without truly understanding CSS, it was hard to express how information could be stored outside of a script, and thus reverted to tags. I will say, though, that implementing a ""style sheet"" was a forerunner on my mind when developing my premise expressed in the document I posted. JS can be cumbersome at times, and doesn't necessarily need to be used in the way I've mostly been using it; allocating objects or object properties on cues.  I'm extremely interested in the Hover and Active traits, as that would simplify a large amount of code (my code, anyways xD) as well as allow you to do things such as shaders and even pop-ups and more. Forward direction specified through .left, .right, etc. on a local or global scope is absolutely brilliant and would definitely help people (such as myself before this ) with rotations and overall providing simplicity and clarity.  In summary, to be able to use CSS to assist scripting and construction of rooms within the 3D web would be a gigantic leap forward for the new generation of web browsers. It has the potential to streamline the creative process of room development/organization, all while adding another piece of existing web development technology (in a slightly modified way, as always :D) to the ""JanusVR: Original 3D Web Browser"" toolbelt."
janusVR,35s76u,Wiiplay123,2,Wed May 13 03:01:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was your room deallocation post that inspired the part about distance. I meant to include some LOD (which /u/dizzket came up with, I think) CSS as well. I'm not sure how much of this is implementable in Janus at this point, especially the hover, and active stuff. James would need to integrate event handlers and the CSS somehow. But it would fall in line with the door hover-cursor thing people were talking about.   The trick with CSS is how simple it is. It is almost entirely just:  (object I want to target){     property-for-it: value-of-property; }   And with SceneVR coming along as well, I figured rather than having each client parse the other's code, we might as well start coming up with a web standard, it is a web browser after all!"

janusVR,35nu0y,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Tue May 12 22:37:59 2015 UTC,"It's not entirely clear to me either what the purpose of this function was, but it appears to remove/zero out a property.  The first argument is your ""dictionary"" (really a term for a hash to each property/object - for example room.objects is one of these), and the second argument is the ""key"" (really just a string that is the key for the hash - in the case of the room.objects the js_id's are the keys).  I'm not sure it has anything to do with keystroke suppression.  Here is the source code for it:  QScriptValue RemoveKey(QScriptContext * context, QScriptEngine * engine) { QScriptValue hash = context->argument(0); QString key = context->argument(1).toString();  hash.setProperty(key, QScriptValue());  return engine->undefinedValue(); }   Now on the subject of keystroke suppression:  Checking the docs, you are supposed to use preventDefault() if you want a keypress to be handled just by the JS, and not by Janus natively.  Going through the code, I have made some changes to the keystroke tracking which broke this behaviour, but should be fixed for 42.3.  So e.g. if you have a room.onKeyDown event and it's for e.g. space, you can call preventDefault() if this condition is true, and your character in Janus should no longer jump."

Not in the next update precisely, but it would be nice to be able to edit documents from within Janus."
janusVR,35l1xf,CrusaderOfMan,2,Tue May 12 16:33:40 2015 UTC,Many things are possible :)  I'll add a note about this.
janusVR,35l1xf,JamesMcCrae,3,Tue May 12 19:11:50 2015 UTC,"i'm actually kinda surprised nobody has done that yet on the server side since it'd be pretty easy.  Just setup the routing and then the action called to recognize when it's asking for a file and then files of a particular type, setup a room template from which to serve each type, locate any file dependencies (like materials for objects) and then push the data model to the room template.  edit: i guess the caveat would be how to recognize if it's an asset request or a page request, though that shouldn't be too difficult to take into account.  I know I had a bit of middleware to handle the request checks for my janus filebrowser...i just don't know if it still works with Janus given how long it's been since I've worked on that project, though the principle should be the same....i think, i'd have to do some retesting to be sure."
janusVR,35l1xf,codenamesrcl,2,Mon May 11 13:05:51 2015 UTC,"Same thing came to mind when I saw the post (here). I'd add that the room should probably have an invisible floor to prevent models from being obscured by the ground plane.   On a related note, is there a way for janus to determine the in-game dimensions of an .obj? The maximum width, depth and height for example. Knowing basic dimensions like these may make it possible for janus to assign cuboid collision meshes on the fly to all objects under a certain size (~1m). I think having simple collision meshes for all objects under this size makes sense."
janusVR,35l1xf,Lewis_P,2,Mon May 11 13:00:13 2015 UTC,"James has mentioned that bounding boxes are trivial so it seems making a collision box based off that is also trivial. Probably would be trivial then for checking if the bounding volume is less than 1 cubic meter then make it the minimum. However, there's really no need for minimum as you can use the cube primitive as the collision model.  I wonder if this could be taken further though. What if Janus can create a Voxel Collision mesh based on an object. A 10cm cube is the default voxel, and Janus calculates how many voxels and where they should be to fully cover the object. Of course, this could be further improved by merging faces of the various cubes."
janusVR,35l1xf,Lewis_P,2,Mon May 11 13:19:51 2015 UTC,"I figured that for objects under 1 metre cubed, having a cuboid collision mesh would be pretty indistinguishable from a complex collision model (until we can pick up objects with leap or push them around with physics). However for objects over that size a more detailed collision mesh is probably necessary. Voxel collision meshing sounds cool, though seems like it might take a fair bit of work.  The application of the dimension detection idea in the context of this thread, was to prevent problems with viewing huge OBJ (in terms of dimensions), janus could check the size of the obj and scale it down appropriately."
janusVR,35l1xf,CrusaderOfMan,3,Mon May 11 13:38:06 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, the dimensions of the object are inaccessible. You only really know the the position of the object. If you were to define the dimensions though, you could add them to the position values to get a bounding box. This is how I go about selecting an object with the leap hands, and it seems to work fairly decent as long as the object isn't too irregular."
janusVR,35l1xf,JamesMcCrae,2,Mon May 11 15:15:48 2015 UTC,"This change will be in 42.3 - rooms are now generated with the geometry for URL's ending with "".obj"" or "".dae"".  In the case of .dae, texture/material info is in the file.  In the case of .obj, Janus will look for a corresponding file with the same filename but ending in "".mtl"".  E.g. this one works:  http://ourmetaverse.com/assets/objects/light.obj  attempts to load:  http://ourmetaverse.com/assets/objects/light.mtl  which is found.  In cases where it's not, the HTTP request fails and the OBJ model gets shown with default grey material applied."
janusVR,35l1xf,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Tue May 12 22:26:51 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling this will make resource sites much more fun to navigate.   ""Here's an image on the object. Click on the image to see it"". Helps keeps room memory low and should remove some tedium when it comes to sharing content.  James, out of interest, do direct link to video and audio files load their own room like image files do? If not, might be useful. With audio files though, if you ever add directional audio the it could open up to a ""speaker"" room with audio coming from specific locations of the speakers."
janusVR,35l1xf,JamesMcCrae,2,Tue May 12 23:40:31 2015 UTC,"Hmm, video is another good idea that's not in yet.  Probably can get this in for 42.3 as well."
janusVR,35lfp1,Nukemarine,2,Mon May 11 13:46:36 2015 UTC,"Lewis_p wrote in another thread about using a minimum 1 meter cube as a collision for small objects. This got me thinking of an old idea for Janus to somehow create a simplified collision mesh for objects to reduce lag. Something like turn the object into its voxel equivalent with like 10cm cubes (if at scale of 1 1 1). Probably a complicated request so I just looked at auto voxel converters. So, this site came up after a quick search. Might be a nice tool."
janusVR,35lfp1,JamesMcCrae,2,Mon May 11 13:53:22 2015 UTC,"Even using voxel-based representation can still lead to many triangles in the collision mesh (as you've seen in some of the minecraft rooms that were imported into Janus).  That said, once you have prior knowledge of the structure, you can then do tricks to minimize the triangles to test collisions against.  Interesting site, I poked around looking at some of the other projects."

From my brief glance through your text (don't have much time today haha), a couple of ideas came to mind that are probably already covered but figured I'd voice them anyways.   Re:Rooms within rooms  I think having additional rooms within rooms (all on one URL) should be part of a reworking of how portals are scripted.  Currently I think you set a portal using <link> or something and it always takes you to a new URL. I'd suggest swapping this for <portal> and treating it like the <room> code, where you can nest a new set of asset locations (for assets loaded in the primary room). Included in the <portal> code could be a labelling system to allow 'Portal A' to take you to 'Portal B' in the same room allowing for portal guns and easier 'teleporting' around a single environment."

janusVR,35ki7f,Nukemarine,1 point,Mon May 11 16:21:00 2015 UTC,"I never thought about the idea of the portal to portal travel, that's a good one. It would be something like setting up W.A.R.P. locations, but instead you would be able to see those assets you define as well as use a portal to take you there. I love the portal idea, I wish we could use it a bit more in a few different ways."
janusVR,35ki7f,JamesMcCrae,2,Tue May 12 01:03:02 2015 UTC,Yeah the portals are incredible and there is definitely so much potential for applications we haven't even thought of yet
janusVR,35ki7f,qster123,1 point,Tue May 12 08:25:28 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting idea. At the moment, it can only be created with portals and buffer zones. I suggested something similar where we define grouped assets which are defined in separate text files.  So, just to summarize your points:  Deallocation distances: When you're far enough away, Janus removes those objects as if it had deallocated a room.  Grouped rooms: Rooms (and objects in the room) can be defined assets. These rooms are then placed in the locations. They also can have deallocation distance set and even teleport portals connecting them.  Personally, instead of them being called ""rooms"" just call them ""groups"". When defined as an asset, the ""group"" can be defined by a text file with the objects, images, sounds, and even overall room set."

janusVR,35f9ay,FireFoxG,1 point,Sat May 9 22:30:37 2015 UTC,"You could, in theory, do this via the webviews.   It would require that the webpage JS editor constantly saves the JS code written to a txt file, and the page you are would need to constantly reload the JS library for every letter press.  That program in the video seems to be purpose built for what you see.  In Janus you would have to purpose build a web API that can do the same thing.  If you could do without the seemless real time updating of the code, then it's possible with nearly any website that can output a plaintext file via a website editor.  For example VRsites, or any domain hosting website that has html editing capabilities built in.   Basically, edit in the html or JS plain text of the webpage you are in via the built in janus webviews.  save, then reload the room to see the changes.  PS, this awesome guy built a real time Debian based Linux VM terminal into Janus. You could control whatever from within janus.  https://hackaday.io/project/5077-metaverse-lab/log/16066-hacking-within-vr-pt-2"
janusVR,35f9ay,codenamesrcl,1 point,Sat May 9 21:44:32 2015 UTC,"hmm, i'd probably go for a more modern approach if i could.  Connect a socket server to the page editor and janus.  On save for traditional or on tag complete/changed for a live mode, the editor sends a message to the socket server which broadcasts it to anybody hooked up to the room, notifying that that room has changed and use the new markup instead, calling for a rerender of either the entire room or just the marked changes to the room.  The acknowledgement of the message itself would have to be opt-in per user, as it's annoying for some to explore a big place and then have things suddenly change on them without much notification.  For a live mode, marked changes would be a part of the message.  Methodologies like this are used pretty regularly, most notably in watch-based build processes (grunt, gulp, etc) and BrowserSync for those who use nodejs as it triggers live refreshes.  Unfortunately we don't have the ability to remotely call for a refresh/rerender or hook in new assets without refreshing the entire markup.  Though it'd be cool to see the approach attempted as it would bring you closer to that ""seamless live mode"" that people seem to want.  It'd be useful for local-side editing as well, working off of a local node server through janus and then pushing to the remote server for staging/production releases and then just stepping from the dev hub to the production site."

janusVR,35f9ay,CrusaderOfMan,1 point,Sat May 9 22:36:35 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see something like this! Without having to open a webview, a possible solution might be having something like a ""document view"" feature. It would work similarly to a websurface, however it would be confined to local documents within your workspaces folder or through a new folder within the appdata folder used for the errorlog, userid, etc. Specify the document in the HTML, if it can be open (anybody can edit and make changes) or closed (only specified userids can edit and change).  If we could open those local text files within Janus and have the ability to edit and save them right from the webroom, this might be the most effective way to iterate and build right from within VR without ever having to take the headset off or continuously log in and navigate from the webview. Of course you would still have to refresh to see the change, but it would no longer require you to reenter credentials every time you make a change."

janusVR,35dk9j,konchok,1 point,Sat May 9 09:10:47 2015 UTC,"An idea I'm throwing around: deallocating intermediate rooms.  So say you start at room ""A"", then navigate to B, C, D in that order i.e. A->B->C->D.  At D we realize we may want to deallocate, so we deallocate from the middle (rooms B, C), and then relink A's child portal to D's parent, changing the relationships to A->D.  This could be cool, and would solve the problem, but also be potentially confusing (the way you return is no longer the way you took in the first place).  But it might be fun to try anyway."

I agree with Konchok about keeping the paths (and portal creation location if any) in memory after deallocation.   So I go A>B>C>D>E>F>G.  Deallocation then is lower case so it's really a>b>c>d>e>F>G now. As I go back to D, the previous parent room autoloads so it's  a>b>C>D>E>f>g.  The paths back to G are still saved even though the rooms are deallocated. If I walk back to G, any portals I created are also saved.   In my head I imagine that re-entering a deallocated room autoloads all autoclosed doors and recreates links that were created while you were in that room previously in your browsing chain.  Assuming the memory load is minimal, all portals created on that path can be saved. Only when a path is broken (delete a portal either individually or resetting a room) will those links down the path be lost.  Should make for smooth navigation and save lots on memory. Plus, if saved, that can open the door for quick movement to any room in the navigation path in a later update. This is similar to current browsers back/forward showing the 10 links in the browsing chain you can quick select."

I don't think my Macbook can handle running Mumble on top of screen streaming to my mobile HMD, I had thought about using voice-to-text as I am finding myself more comfortable using Janus while standing up and using a gamepad (currently using Wii remote, might have to upgrade soon, sounds like it's handy having all those buttons)"

Place an object in the level that has the racetrack physics you want when controlled by keys, like a flat kart or something similar. Then have a key-press attach the player to it so they ""drive"". Your idea to have a gradual acceleration curve until it maxes out a velocity would be fine on a browser but horrific in VR. You want to avoid non instantaneous changes in velocity where possible or at least make the change in velocity happen very quickly so the total time spent accelerating is low."

Glad you got to run around with some other folks on here :)  Some observations as I watch:  U S A G ""Two"" - I've got start calling it that :)  Leap Motion and flight mode difficulty - I think this is a problem with the program in fact.  Having some back and forth with Kip from Leap now and we have been going over the interface and how I may improve it (e.g adding indicators to show position of fingertip in sphere, adding a deadzone for the vertical axis, expanding the activation region, etc).  Janus will have a project page on the Leap Motion website soon!  Crash when leap is activated during video playback - very strange, I think a coincidence, but noted.  I recently added a way to access the Leap motion stuff via JS (so you could e.g. pick up things in the room), I wonder if this is tied to that?  I'll have to look into it.  Was obvious you set up positional audio when you were chasing dizzket around the dot matrix.  He would get about 10 metres away and you could barely hear him :)"

It was great getting personal tours and seeing areas I had not yet visited. As for the leap crash, I have been able to re-create it on 4 different occasions now. It only seems to happen when I raise my hands to see them. As long as I don't engage the Leap, it seems to work fine. I am interested to hear what you find out so if there is something I need to change on my end it can be done. Also, I should be in there again recording this weekend at some point and was curious as to your recommendations of rooms to visit that would make a good impact on the video or just some of your personal favorites?

janusVR,353g9e,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Fri May 8 22:50:20 2015 UTC,"Animations right now are only supported by blendshapes.  That means you define multiple OBJs/DAE for each pose (a base and a set of targets), and then you modify the blend weights via JS (normally between 0 and 1) which does vertex-based blending between the shapes.  It's pretty rudimentary animation support, but somewhat powerful (you can do walk cycles, facial animation, etc)"
janusVR,353g9e,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Sat May 9 00:38:35 2015 UTC,Oh! Blendshapes.. we don't quite advocate for this technique in Visual Effects (movies) due to its unrealism.

janusVR,34w23t,sirkitree,2,Tue May 5 01:58:52 2015 UTC,"Right on! We have the ability to be in or out of the multiplayer experience as we wish, but to the degree of being connected with other users without their knowledge of your presence can be alarming, for lack of a better word.

janusVR,34w23t,Lewis_P,2,Tue May 5 11:38:59 2015 UTC,"struggle is here. lol.   it is sad, that someone else was faster than me to mess around with the server. PS i already cutted the comunications with wireshark, but i was to lazy to make a little fake client to mess around with all the objects in the rooms or catch users by moving objects, portals and javascrips. The other thing was there was so many updates in the last time i dont had time to check every thing for changes in the transmissions...  what will you do when other clients apear?  will you lock out other clients then janus? then the vr web will be scattered. it is the worst you can do.  it is like reddit will ban FireFox and Chrome and only allows InternetExplorer to post here... do you want this? No this is not what a web page is for.   now is the moment to look at janus what it could be and what not. i see a very fancy webbrowser with the chance to define a HTML for VR and allow others to use this definitions to create own browsers some day VR-HTML and the W3C HTML can be one to define a webpage in 2D and 3D in the same time. but janus have to be developed in this direction:    using css for placing objects and texturing them. (by class, by id and so on..) define all elements of HTML in a 3D contex add javacripts for reloading parts of the rooms (ajax)   but i see a lots of wasted time and there are many bad playful/gameish ideas around with no real solution e.g. ""we need a lockable door for private comunications"". The game solution is to add a door into the world, but you can tell your client to teleport to every location and to tell the server the same thing... in the end this is always in your hand. The real solution, the web/internet solution, is to open a P2P connection between 2 users and cut of the conections to the janus vr/babylon presence servers.   banning will not help against users with bad intentions they will find ways to break everything. and find a way to mask them selfs, it is a lost fight if you start it. look at the current webbrowsers and learn from them why decisions was make the way they did. why is XSS forbidden? why is the default the way it is ... and how they allow the interactivity between the users on a page (chat boxes...).  For my evil plans:   step 1 creating different rooms at least the same room with different names to creats at least 6 portals simultaneous step 2 create script to catch user by setting the positions in the room each render tick step 3 dont allow the user to click a object (first to disallow the modifing the objects in the room) and place the object each time in the face of the user.  step 4 move the user by trigonometry functions (sin, cos) in 3d space so fast he cant click on the ESC menue and dont hit hit spot in a long time again (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph) step 5 create bot to catch users in the contraption. by adding moving objects in a room to hold the user inside of the cube of portals (see step 1) step 6 moment the user starts clicking to activate the portals. then he will be hold by javascript till he shut down janus vr by Alt + F4...  step 7 put every thing into a java/c# application to run it on a RaspberryPi 24/7.   the steps 1,2,3,4, are tested and they will work  i made a nice little room for ""the server is placing your Y position on each frame"" as experiment even ""Backspace"" to the entrance portal dont work because your position will be overwritten the moment you tip your toe into it. (in my opinion i want ""no script"" and full control over my avatar (speed, flying, teleportation, coclip) every thing else is force against me...)   the steps 5,6,7 are possible too because janus will deliver the positions of each other users in the room to display the avatar. then the bot can send the commands to move or create a portal and the collision objects to move others around. the step 6 is possible because the ESC menue is renders on a fixed space behind near objects (on the same Z level/clipping into each other).  in the moment janus attempt to be a metaverse and a webbrowser and i hope the webbrowser side wins here because it can change every thing in the web. on the other side as metaverse it can be the next broken mmo with a room designer like second life or wow..."
janusVR,34w23t,The_Real_Black,2,Wed May 6 21:22:59 2015 UTC,"Interesting points. Though it is far easier than that to force the user to quit janus, just put something in the room that will crash janus. I think the real fear is more about personal data and attaining access to user's files through hijacking mouse control and stuff.  The issue of other clients coming along that can maliciously interact with janus is interesting. Personally I will choose the browser that provides peace of mind and actively has security measures in place to try to prevent that sort of thing. In the same way that I choose a browser that has the ability to have ad blockers. I feel others would likely do the same, so I think there is an incentive for janus.  Peer to peer connections would be interesting. It could work like the xbox live party system where you invite people to 'join your party' then you are grouped with them and isolated from everyone else.   banning will not help against users with bad intentions they will find ways to break everything.    You are probably right, the better option is to allow room creators to have greater control over what all users can do within their rooms. Rather than trying to ban individual users."
janusVR,34w23t,The_Real_Black,1 point,Wed May 6 21:44:45 2015 UTC,"""crash janus"": this is one idea, but then the user is not forced to do any countermeasure to it, janus would just end. with my idea the users will feel helples tilll the close the program. (Idea for crash janus: i have to test with endless JS scripts ( while(true) {i++}; ) to kill janus...  the ""join a party"" idea is a great idea after joining the user can edit in rooms together but other will be spared by the their  changes and converse.   ""greater control over "" i see the different solution deliver just the room and let each user do what ever he want to do with the room like webpages right now. each user can remove parts of the page (adblock) without interfere with others. only if some one will join to gether there changes can be shown to each other."
janusVR,34w23t,The_Real_Black,1 point,Thu May 7 20:43:38 2015 UTC,"The real solution, the web/internet solution, is to open a P2P connection between 2 users and cut of the conections to the janus vr/babylon presence servers.      This negates the purpose of the multiplayer server completely, but if you want to connect directly it'd be a good idea to be able to reconnect directly to each other somehow.     why is XSS forbidden?     Well, it's not been requested, and if you want to use it, it might not be allowed because of the security problems with it.    One thing you don't seem to have noticed is that janus is under development, getting all the features needed working first of all, THEN start worrying about security etc.. We KNOW there are a lot of problems in janus now. Oh, and the reason we'd like to have a ban/block feature is so it'll be possible to demonstrate janus, have conventions and other things without disruptive people just greifing and being obnoxious because they can.    If you have questions about janus, ask, if you have an opinion, write a reddit post.    If someone else wants to make a separate janus client, good for them, we'd  encourage that.    I mentioned the ban feature because of what the person was doing the other day was killing the server, and it didn't look like it was unintentional. It looked like he/she was trying to kill the server."

(maybe some one here sees me to kill he multiplayer aspect, but i unterstand the fun of vr meetings and all the stuff. social vr wil be a great part of the new internet i know it, but the current path is very bad in a security way)  xss is in the moment possible with active multiplayer option in janus vr every one can change everything in the rooms the moment you enter it. i search and close 8 hours a day XSS holes in webpages as my job and i see janus build this thing into its core mechanics. its hurts me a bit inside because XSS wasn't a big deal some years ago old code wasn't prepared for it and fixing this is very very hard and time consuming. there is no we will fix these holes later if you could avoid all of it right now.   if some one is trying to kill the server welcome to the world of hosters. a 24h ip block after a attempt is pretty usual thins a firewall can do."
janusVR,34w23t,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Thu May 7 21:27:23 2015 UTC,"the server and the client are two completely different things. xss has nothing to do with the server, so if you want it as a feature or not, please make a new thread with a feature request."

janusVR,34pwu0,vrgamerdude,1 point,Sun May 3 14:39:13 2015 UTC,"These would all be very helpful. I especially like the no avatar at first idea, since upon logging in I was a large black woman with a very strange name... The very first thing I had to do was jump back out to figure out how to rename and change my avatar. Upon reflection I ,guess I could have just opened a page and searched from within the app but it didn't occur to me at the time. Still one of the most interesting apps in VR IMHO []-)"
janusVR,34pwu0,Lewis_P,5,Mon May 4 03:01:35 2015 UTC,"Very interesting! Key points that I picked up on:   Struggle to reset rift. Perhaps a splash screen instructing to reset rift before start-up would help a little? I agree with the first-time-user-mode idea firefox mentioned below. Leap for navigation is fiddly. Consider replace with teleporting mechanic maybe? Now that crosshairs are a thing, maybe you could look at where you want to go, place your hand in the volume below for 2 seconds and it sends you there. Rooms need to spell things out as clear as possible to improve user comprehension and ultimately user experience. Personally I think the world explorer room actually does more to explain itself than most other rooms, which highlights how important addressing this problem is. Entering rooms prior to them loading may be detrimental to immersion. That said, no idea what the solution to this problem is.    A positive note is that users still 'get' how awesome janus is despite its quirks :)"
janusVR,34pwu0,konchok,3,Sun May 3 15:47:26 2015 UTC,"Why is his eye position at the floor?    This is a perfect example as to why I should be able to set the avatar and avatar attributes in my room.  Everyone who sees this video is going to be confused as to why the rocket launcher is way above his head without realizing that his head is on the floor.  BTW vrgamerdude, thank you for taking a look at the phase room!"
janusVR,34pwu0,vrgamerdude,1 point,Sun May 3 20:33:05 2015 UTC,"NP.. It is the reason I logged on. As for the eye level... I seemed to be having issues with the height of my avatar for some reason. Even after a reset, I felt like I was about 3ft tall the entire time."

janusVR,34pwu0,konchok,1 point,Mon May 4 03:38:09 2015 UTC,"Eye position. after a recent update is tied to the avatar.  The avatar you were using had a bad eye position, probably because it is a new feature.  If you want to jump into VR, I can help you get another avatar."
janusVR,34pwu0,JamesMcCrae,3,Mon May 4 03:43:28 2015 UTC,"Nice!  Rough start - R to reset head, space to jump/use warp-pad, one-handed leap controls (index fingertip), and so on.  I really appreciate these first-time impressions because they tell you a lot about usability problems.  Too bad about judder - deallocate depth 1 would close portals and may have helped with judder.  And despite a crash that ended the video I liked the kind words at the end :)  Going to link to this on janusvr.com, thanks for the link /u/FireFoxG"
janusVR,34pwu0,konchok,3,Sun May 3 21:18:55 2015 UTC,"I really think deallocate needs to go both ways,  people don't always go back through doors that they entered, and the more doors you go through the worse the performance."
janusVR,34pwu0,JamesMcCrae,4,Sun May 3 21:47:05 2015 UTC,"Right.  This would fix the problem with going ""too deep"" and allocating too much memory."
janusVR,34pwu0,Nukemarine,1 point,Sun May 3 22:15:57 2015 UTC,"One solution is to deallocate after the third level. Currently it's:  First level normal and you can see through the door to parent room.  Second level, door is closed to parent room. So make it deallocate after the third level.   For going back to the parent room, Janus could automatically keep reloading 2 rooms deep as the user backtracks. The only trick is Janus remembering the backward path URL and location in the parent room the door was created (something it currently does not do IIRC). With cache turned on, this should look seemless.  For those that set deallocate depth to 1, just move the steps up one level so parent portal closes as you walk through and deallocates parent rooms that are 2 deep. This can make deep walks into the web more manageable for even the low end computers."
janusVR,34pwu0,vrgamerdude,3,Mon May 4 02:14:47 2015 UTC,"Hey James... Thanks for the comments and for watching the vid.... Admittedly, this was a rough video for sure, and I was not prepared very well before making it. I really meant what I said at the end though..... I had the opportunity to hang with you guys once in the VR Bar a few months ago and it was one of the best times I've had in a social VR setting yet. I really do believe that this is the beginnings of the new internet. I will be spending more time in Janus for sure, and will be posting more vids as I do []-)"
janusVR,34pwu0,qster123,2,Mon May 4 02:54:12 2015 UTC,Nice to see another perspective on Janus - I may have to re-think the doors I've used a VR Sites showcases and Flynn's is a bit of an FPS killer in the DK2
janusVR,34pwu0,vrgamerdude,2,Sun May 3 15:35:15 2015 UTC,Thanks everyone for watching.... Sorry for the rough quality of the vid... I was in Janus and decided on the fly to capture this and share it with some friends back home that have not been in VR yet. I was really blown away by all of the changes that were made since the last time I had logged in several months ago. Once I learn and explore a bit more I will definitely be posting more videos to help share this with the world []-)

janusVR,34p7mu,NXT_Aussie,1 point,Sun May 3 12:20:23 2015 UTC,"I assume the client should do the following to be really effective:  In Janus   Typing ""#mumble"" transmits that text along with the username to babylon.vrsites.com in mumble. In the homeroom, there's a list of users currently on the babylon.vrsites.com server in mumble.   In Mumble   There's a ""JanusVR"" user we can communicate with Messages from Janus VR via #mumble get sent from that user Text messages in Mumble get forwarded to the Janus VR text chat to include the username. When a new user logs into Janus VR, a mumble message is generated as well. In Janus VR homeroom, the ""Mumble Chat"" wall shows users and the mix of text chat from both Janus and Mumble going on.   With that, given the number of people that hang out in mumble there's very good player awareness. Should reduce the number of users that show up, see just the homeroom, get bored not realizing what to check out, and leave."

It is a significant graphical step up from the previous lobby (I became acutely aware of this when I briefly went back to the old lobby). The assets used (trees and shrubs etc) and textures and baked lighting all look great!  A little bit of constructive criticism :)   it is quite dark: it may benefit from a lighter ceiling texture or more skylights to get some god rays coming in. the four 'wings' are difficult to tell apart: could consider using colour theming. The four wings could even be clearly categorised like this. With one wing housing all of the tutorial and avatar selection stuff relevant to new users. A second wing could be all about weekly featured rooms. The next could be 'sponsor' rooms or more permanent features. The fourth could be for special event rooms. Or whatever. The wings may already be categorised like this, it's just not yet clear enough what each wing is for :)   edit: just noticed that the mental model of the lobby that I used to base the drawing from differs quite a bit from what it actually looks like haha. I think it's still clear what I was trying to show :)"

In 42.1, It shoots up to around 800mb and crashes every time.  I'm going from the new lobby to the manifold, playing that, crashes rarely on just that... Then I go to the marvel room off the vrbar, and I always crash on that when played after the manifold video.  Videos are seem to be maxing my ram out before crashing, which is why I can watch a smaller video like the manifold from a fresh start, but the higher rez videos crash me out nearly every time. more then 2 vids and I crash every time.  You may not be crashing because your titan has massive amounts of Vram. Or you have lots of normal ram  Maybe try an older comp?  My setup  http://i.imgur.com/YJjxeoU.png"

janusVR,34ok57,sirkitree,1 point,Sun May 3 08:17:11 2015 UTC,On Nuke's point about crosshairs landing on the nearest surface. I think it has been confirmed that this is how microsoft's hololens achieves 'gaze detection' and controller-less selections. I'm pretty sure it would be possible to mimic their method within janus using a 3d cross hair and  leap. It would be really cool to be able to explore ideas for hololens within janus.  How it works in hololens is that you look at what you want to select using a 3d cursor in the centre of your field of view that lands on the nearest surface. Next you make an L gesture with your finger and thumb to let it know you are ready to make a selection then tap your index finger to your thumb to confirm selection. If that could be achieved with leap within janus I'm pretty sure it will drive a large quantity of VR enthusiasts and developers to janus to check it out :)
janusVR,34ok57,Lewis_P,1 point,Sun May 3 11:19:13 2015 UTC,"I'd love to be able to do some basic modeling with leap.  On the modeling front, grouping or selecting multiple objects at once would be huge as well."
janusVR,34ok57,macromarco83,1 point,Sun May 3 14:04:09 2015 UTC,"My concern is that the further down that path janus goes the more it may be expected to have even more game-engine-like functionality. I think it's currently possible to nest objects in code though, right? I don't know. If it is already possible to do that, then a method for doing it within janusvr would be really useful :)"
janusVR,34ok57,macromarco83,1 point,Sun May 3 14:11:55 2015 UTC,"The use case I'm thinking of is that when I'm in the rift and spawning primitives to build with, I should be able to select multiple things in a certain configuration and copy/paste them together, or change certain attributes like pos, xyzdir, and scale. I don't know what this has to do with being a game engine, but then I've never programmed a game."
janusVR,34ok57,dizzket,2,Sun May 3 15:27:26 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I totally agree that that would be useful! I'm always building tree like structures out of primitives in the lobby that i'd love to be able to easily duplicate or scale or colour or whatever.  Guess I'm falling for the slippery slope fallacy. 'The more tools james adds for building and editing rooms within janus, the more tools people will request james to add to better build and edit rooms within janus.' This is not strictly true as there is probably a comfortable middle ground between where janus is now and something as crazy as garry's mod or unity or blender. The ability to select multiples and group objects seems like a pretty standard feature that janus should have"
janusVR,34ok57,dizzket,1 point,Sun May 3 15:56:14 2015 UTC,"Longtime bug:  On linux, qhen the JS Debugger is activated and a JS error is detected, the debugger displays and freezes janus unless I leftclick and hit f9 to let go of the mouse, I can't do anything. If the debug window is closed when this happens, it pop's right back up again and janus continues to be unresponsive until it's closed and then close the debug window. ONCE, the debuge window popped up and janus did not freeze up, but I can not describe the conditions or version I was on at that moment.    Could you have a quick look at this since it makes it very tedious to do JS development/debugging when you have to restart janus every time an error occurs.    Other than that, I love janus long time :)    The cross hair is very much apreciated by me both in desktop and vr mode since you don't have to click and ""feel"" your way to the target you are looking for.

janusVR,34nqvc,Nukemarine,1 point,Sun May 3 00:29:00 2015 UTC,"In the Rift, will this crosshair behave like the cursors do, smoothly move over the object? Hopefully that's the case and the crosshair is an object that scales to simulate looking at farther away objects. The scale should not have a cut-off like the cursors currently do.  Dizzket in game made a good suggestion that if the crosshair moves over a clickable portal then it changes to a click finger or something similar to tell the user this is a ""hyperlink"". I assume something like this: Normal - crosshair, Link - clicker finger, Webview screen - monitor, Ghost (to change avatar) - small man."
janusVR,34nqvc,Nukemarine,2,Sun May 3 01:44:14 2015 UTC,"Right now the cursor will appear at a fixed distance, it should appear about 1 metre out.  It may work out much better to have a cursor that projects out to the geometry along the gaze direction, I may have to try that next.  But for now the intention is in Rift mode you wouldn't be using the cursor.  Re: different 3D icons based on what's moused over, it's a good idea.  I will have to think about how to do that efficiently (right now object picking/selection happens on cursor release, while the mouse is held I am just sampling normal/depth info)"
janusVR,34nqvc,dizzket,1 point,Sun May 3 01:56:00 2015 UTC,"Got. For the 2D users, the fixed crosshair should help a lot.   Might be worth experimenting with the HMD controlling the pointer on the webview screen. For people like me that use controllers, that might be more user friendly than trying to find the mouse (the mouse axis mapped to my controllers are set too high to be useful). If so, that leads the way for a better UI when people use Janus VR on tablets."
janusVR,34nqvc,dizzket,1 point,Sun May 3 02:08:05 2015 UTC,"I don't know really anything about OpenGL, so excuse my complete ignorance, but couldn't you have portal triangles draw a specific colour to another buffer, and then have Janus sample that buffer to determine the specific kind of content you're mousing over? I could imagine it being costly for high polygon stuff, but links are typically 2 triangles (not counting the glow, and also not counting circular portals) I'm not sure if it's the painting of pixels to the buffer that's costly, or switching between drawing different triangles?  Or maybe I just wrote a paragraph of dumb incoherent stuff :D Hehehe  If you could determine the content type, though, you could have a specific cursor image for opening portals, another for interacting with web surfaces, etc. etc."

janusVR,34mg1e,sirkitree,1 point,Sat May 2 14:06:16 2015 UTC,Interesting.  I have made some significant changes to how Janus clears and reallocates (for instance when doing room reloading or resetting).  Could you report back with 42.0 and tell me if you're having the same issue?

janusVR,34g5wm,FireFoxG,2,Thu Apr 30 21:44:09 2015 UTC,... yet I still see no instruction(s) outlining how one can either scale or apply a texture onto a room template?
janusVR,34g5wm,NXT_Aussie,2,Thu Apr 30 22:29:25 2015 UTC,Jump in the mumble channel and I'll help you
janusVR,34g5wm,Lewis_P,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:48:57 2015 UTC,"generated    Thank you for all the replies guys. I really appreciate this. Its nice to see so much contribution for such a small question.  With respect to finding a solution to my problem, I have opted to simply use the ""room_plane"" template as my default room for basic collision. As I am already comfortable with amateur-ish modelling using blender I will just create my own models and import them. Resolving collisions is something I'll care about after these first steps are completed.  Many thanks and much appreciated."
janusVR,34g5wm,FireFoxG,1 point,Fri May 1 20:30:40 2015 UTC,"To apply a texture to an asset object, you set the texture in the code. As stated here. However what I think you're asking is how to apply a texture to one of the default rooms templates. I don't think that's currently possible. You're better off building the room either using cubes that you have added to the asset list with textures, or by building the general room layout in sketchup. Hope that helps :)"
janusVR,34g5wm,konchok,1 point,Fri May 1 07:23:57 2015 UTC,"http://wiki.blender.org/  Janus is just a 3D VR web browser.  You have to learn 3d modeling, or download 3d models, or pay a person to make models.  I highly recommend starting with Sketch-Up or Blender."
janusVR,34g5wm,MrM0bius,1 point,Fri May 1 10:23:52 2015 UTC,"We're a small, but dedicated group.    I would recommend using the information that /u/firefoxg posted, and after trying to get it working.  If you run into a roadblock join the mumble channel.  There is usually someone inside that can help you.  As for workflow,  I find the first thing that I do is start with one of the presets for rooms.     Set the room changes that I want such as gravity or walk speed. Add assets to your room(this is done before the room tag) Then use right click with edit mode on to spawn the objects into the room Finally use room edits to position, scale, and rotate objects."
janusVR,34g5wm,codenamesrcl,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:54:30 2015 UTC,"Right now the template rooms are fixed in scale and texture I believe, best to use your own geometry for the room for full control; possibly using room_plane with visible set to false if you want general floor collision.  If you don't have prior experience in a 3d editor, there's a good sketchup converter for Janus.    Maybe we should work on a set of general user generated template rooms to help get people started."
janusVR,34g1iu,derekworld,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:03:45 2015 UTC,"Hey, if you want to use general default lighting instead of no lighting at all, just remove the shader_id=""default_shader_id"" from each object line, but leave lighting=""true"".  This will just use the default Janus shaders.  Also, the sketchup2room converter has it's own built in shader for omni/directional/point/spot/etc, check out the lighting sections of the tutorial files for more details.  You can get some pretty good results using those shaders as well, though it does require some setup."
janusVR,34g1iu,MrM0bius,1 point,Fri May 1 02:28:20 2015 UTC,"Oh, and if you're using things from the 3d warehouse, here are some quick hints to save you a headache:   Components will export as separate object assets, instances of the component will export as new instances of the same assetobject. Make sure all components are exploded all the way down to pure geometry (no components within components), just right click>edit component>select all>right click>explode - rinse and repeat until explode is no longer an option. Make sure all Component Descriptions/Names have no spaces or special characters.  This means the default names like ""Component #18"" need to be changed or they won't export correctly. Putting a + in front of the Component Desc/Name will export without collision.  This is absolutely necessary for complex models (more than 10-20,000 tris).  You can always use a simplified collision model if you need collision."

janusVR,34dtw5,NXT_Aussie,1 point,Thu Apr 30 10:47:43 2015 UTC,I was thinking more of a 95 thesis.
janusVR,34dtw5,Nukemarine,2,Thu Apr 30 10:53:31 2015 UTC,Janus is good but I don't think it's a 1500 year old established religious order just yet.
janusVR,34dtw5,Lewis_P,2,Thu Apr 30 11:21:50 2015 UTC,"Regarding the mouse cursor. Maybe a translucent mouse cursor should always be visible to the player (not to others), then when left click is held the mouse cursor becomes opaque and other's then see it. This could serve as a cross hair and assist in button pressing etc. :)"
janusVR,34dtw5,Nukemarine,2,Thu Apr 30 10:34:00 2015 UTC,"Agree, something that can be toggled in settings. Instead of a cursor though, make it a crosshair. Just like the cursors, they flow along the objects in the room showing where we're looking but won't change with the mouse movement or where we move the cursor with the mouse.  Basically we can always tell our centered look angle."
janusVR,34dtw5,Lewis_P,2,Thu Apr 30 11:21:05 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I hadn't considered the fact that the mouse cursor technically moves away from the centre then is snapped back to the centre, then moves away again whenever you try to rotate your player. It only behaves like a cursor when you click and hold because it no longer effects your orientation. A crosshair makes far more sense :)"
janusVR,34dtw5,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Thu Apr 30 11:24:14 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately these things are not in 42.0 which I've just released, but I've added these to my notes so the issues are now on my radar.  I will tackle some of the easiest of these for 42.1."
janusVR,34dtw5,Nukemarine,1 point,Sat May 2 21:21:59 2015 UTC,"If F9 is not appropriate, which button is appropriate to spare you the weird looks? Might be a good idea. At the moment, when you press the mouse button it appears at the center of your screen. Even if you're not centered you can easily move it. About crosshair, might be a good toggle option. Maybe even have it flow across the environment like the mouse arrow does. Not sure what you mean about right/left and such unless you mean copying what you typed. Being able to click on links in the chat menu has been suggested before, so good idea. Crouch is more a gameplay element. Gameplay elements are more the Javascript area which anybody can work on.  Agree about keymapping. Same goes with controller Not sure about the delay in flight mode. It might be engine based with regards to gravity. There might need to be a sound menu that allows us to add our own sound links. If the sounds annoy you then press Mute (M), plus rooms can suppress sounds as well. F4 is quit? If so, I agree that should be changed to something like CTRL-F4. There may need to be submenu options. Personally I like the virtual menu button you can move around. However, an equivalent websurface might be better for more detailed options and settings.   Thanks for the suggestions. However, please understand that there's currently only one programmer for Janus VR and that's James McCrae. He can only give so many hours a day and has to prioritize on top of that. Past experience has shown that you do better asking instead of demanding in addition to offering justification. Sometimes due to language barriers (English is not everyone's first language here), there might be misunderstanding and bad reaction to wording when a negative tone was not intended.   In addition, since Javascript is available, if you know how recreate in game what changes you think work better (basically, show don't just tell). Likewise, if you can't JS then see if you can talk another into doing it for you."

janusVR,34ddj8,dizzket,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:35:28 2015 UTC,"Yes.  I didn't think of this is a bug, rather a limitation of Janus' UI for changing collision_id setting.  But I will make a note to retain the collision_id set in the markup, and toggle that instead.  (And if the markup does not define a collision_id, then it will set the collision_id to the id.)  Does that sound reasonable?"
janusVR,34ddj8,dizzket,1 point,Fri May 1 22:28:48 2015 UTC,"Yes. I didn't think of this is a bug, rather a limitation of Janus' UI for changing collision_id setting.   Honestly its so niche that I wouldn't worry about it.  Anything with a separate collision model is likely to be large scale architecture or landscape and thus locked.

On a Mac you should already have the necessary codecs for mp4 playback iirc.  Other than that it should be playing properly unless the assetvideo is not in assets or the video is not in the room or both (no source code and no relative path reference so I can't judge those).

janusVR,347yao,JamesMcCrae,2,Wed Apr 29 04:45:58 2015 UTC,This is amazing. I know the initial purpose was for potato inside® computers but if this also helps keep the frame-rate steady for VR then it really should be added to Janus.
janusVR,347yao,qster123,1 point,Wed Apr 29 09:24:17 2015 UTC,So this is why I felt like my performance was always all over the map depending on the room.  I never considered LOD.
janusVR,347yao,owlboy,2,Wed Apr 29 03:53:15 2015 UTC,Portal visibility is another reason.  When there are many open portals expect performance to vary based on where you're standing and what direction you're looking in.  Looking through portals is costly (especially if the room on the other side has a lot of geometry)
janusVR,347yao,JamesMcCrae,2,Wed Apr 29 04:47:52 2015 UTC,LOD though portals seems like a valid special consideration. But that would have to be done in engine etc to work.
janusVR,347yao,owlboy,3,Wed Apr 29 11:48:12 2015 UTC,"The JS in the room can just do a url comparison: if player and room URL match do the LOD as usual, and if not, render objects at lowest LOD (since they are viewed through a portal)"
janusVR,347yao,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:57:07 2015 UTC,"You disabled javascript when you leave the room! Plus it breaks things, and I don't think it's a good idea. Also, sometimes the lowest level LOD will be reaaaaally bad, and kind of defeat the purpose of portals being a view into the room as it is."
janusVR,347yao,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:57:15 2015 UTC,"Right.  And you're right if we have JS updates in other rooms, it will break things."
janusVR,347yao,TheCorsair,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:40:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was able to get a frame increase of about 70 fps with this system, and I'm sure if it was everywhere in Janus, overall performance would be way higher. I'm not sure Javascript works through portals anymore, though, right? Then again, that'd probably just be extremely buggy since the calculations are based off of x and y, and that's not factored in with the portals."
janusVR,347yao,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:00:24 2015 UTC,"I’ve worked a bit with stereoscopic portal rendering, and I agree, it’s a beast. I’ve been thinking about a few cheap workarounds, such as generating two stereoscopically aligned cube maps of the room once it’s loaded (Or have those cube maps available in the server files of the room), and then use that to decrease the amount of geometry viewed through the portal. That has many problems of its own, like not being able to see any people or movement through the portal once it’s generated, and it’s hard to get it to look convincing, just to name a few. Though, looking at this code, you could just set the rooms to use their lowest poly models whenever you’re not in the room, and just looking in through a portal. Not sure if any of that was useful, just some random thoughts. Love your work, by the way; you’re an inspiration, man."
janusVR,347yao,Koolala,2,Wed Apr 29 21:35:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks very much!  I've also considered the cubemap approach, and while cheap to render I don't think it's very convincing, especially when wearing an HMD.  That said, there is probably some ratio of distance to portal and the portal's size where it may be much harder to distinguish."
janusVR,347yao,HAZARDU5,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:51:45 2015 UTC,Switching the portal out with a cubemap at a distance may be something to consider.
janusVR,347yao,macromarco83,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:44:27 2015 UTC,What about this combined with an option to have a portal proximity limiter set to that same distance?
janusVR,347yao,NXT_Aussie,1 point,Sat May 2 20:29:40 2015 UTC,Yeah - it's pretty hard to discern depth at long distances so a cubemap could work well in those instances.

janusVR,347ope,JamesMcCrae,3,Tue Apr 28 23:22:48 2015 UTC,"Just from my own experience, I prefer the 'comfort mode' where it's a quick turn to a snapped position. Instead of it being instant viewpoint change, you still can see the turn happen.   I simulated this by mapping a controller, then setting the turn to being a mouse that was set up fast enough that just tapping the controller moved me the 30 degrees. This has been very comfortable to me.  Suggestion - Make the turn cover 30 degrees but take somewhere between 0.1 seconds and 0.5 seconds (little experimentation for comfort). This will recreate the effect explained with this video where comfort mode was first discussed. The creators of Gallery responded about my discussion on it here"
janusVR,347ope,Nukemarine,2,Tue Apr 28 23:50:07 2015 UTC,"I think it would be a nice option for people, perhaps turned on by default and a button to simply disable it... or have you done that already and I'm behind again? ;)"
janusVR,347ope,sirkitree,2,Tue Apr 28 23:49:00 2015 UTC,"It's a selectable button in the ESC menu. Speaking of which, that menu is getting pretty crowded. James might need to create a way to do sub-menus."

janusVR,347ope,dizzket,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:21:36 2015 UTC,"That would a much cleaner way to do it - having a single button called ""settings"" that modifies the websurface to show all of that.  Edit: or even if the settings had its own websurface off to the right, that might work well too."
janusVR,348o3n,koomer,2,Wed Apr 29 04:17:55 2015 UTC,"Yep.  This is due to hasty overnight implementation.  The interval is every .5 seconds.

janusVR,345jmy,Lewis_P,5,Tue Apr 28 13:56:49 2015 UTC,I share your suspicion.   But I am sure that there's more I could do to communicate it better.
janusVR,345jmy,JamesMcCrae,3,Tue Apr 28 23:38:38 2015 UTC,"As I'm currently adjusting to my new job, I'm not as active as I used to be, in a couple weeks that might change, but yeah, the short bit.  Every month I go to the NYVR meetup and I explain what I do in VR.  Most of the devs there know what I do but pitching it to first timers or consumer-facing business people has become rather routine.    I explain what Janus is in 2 simple sentences.  If the person is interested, they usually are, then I explain more in detail and about what I do in particular (particularly with my Janus Ebooks project, that's been a real draw).  I did a talk back in September/October at the meetup and drew a lot of interest from devs and companies (more for ""hey, do you want to buy our super high res models"" because I'm a content creator and developer, not James).  I'll probably do another talk in the future once I get my new concepts done.  I think that the PR side of things could definitely be improved.  Janus is always being improved in some way so I'm not worried about the software side.  I think that more of the intro style rooms like the one Dizket had would be nice.  Also what got me off the ground was Oculushut's youtube videos, those were really informative.  I think that if we got a JanusVR youtube channel going that would be cool, or at least a network of the content creators so we can point to a bunch of how-to or making-of videos for people to watch, learn from, and be inspired by.  I'll probably edit this more when I get home....yeah, I've got a lot of thoughts about this."
janusVR,345jmy,codenamesrcl,2,Wed Apr 29 14:29:48 2015 UTC,"I feel that MMOs have a lot of experience in this exact thing.     They start with a character creator/ character selection.  This immediately gets people invested in their character.  They then have a starter map.  This is where the basic game play mechanics get introduced. And finally they give the player direction with quests.   JanusVR offers none of these.  No character creation, the tutorial explains how to use janus, but doesn't explain how to create in janus, which is what keeps people using janus.  And finally we don't give a direction for players.  Here are my suggestions to fix this.     We need to have a door way for new users.  ARE YOU NEW, GO THROUGH THIS DOORWAY!!!! Make it a linear path that you need to walk through before you're given a door way back to the main lobby. Start with avatar selection. If we can somehow make a way to have an avatar creator, that'd be awesome. Now that you have your avatar, use dizzket's tutorial. Then place them in a sandbox world, but don't just give them textured blocks,  give them modular blocks to build a castle.  Or other themed ideas.  Have different sandboxes for different themes. show them that they can press CTRL-S to save the room.  (James CTRL-S needs a rework, it's too complicated for new users) once they have made a room, that's where vrsites should step in.  Oh, you've saved a room.  That's awesome host it on VRsites. Which brings me to another point.  VRsites needs to be useable from within VR. Currently you can only view rooms in VR.  Now you put them back into the home room.  The home room needs to display dates for major events.  4/28 CONCERT IN THE VRBAR, 4/29 DANCE PARTY IN THE DOT MATRIX, 4/30 FIRST PERSON SHOOTER TOURNY.  (These are like the quests of an MMO, they give the players direction)"
janusVR,345jmy,konchok,3,Tue Apr 28 15:50:48 2015 UTC,"I think something that we've forgotten.  JanusVR's major draw is the ability to make your own content.       the tutorial room doesn't show how to make content. VRsites doesn't allow you how to make content (while in JanusVR) The workspace folder, which is supposed to be your workspace is not used by any of us, because it's useless.   If you give people a way to make something they will want to show it off.  And janus does allow you to do just that, it's just the learning curve for making content in JanusVR is super steep.  James suggestions to ease new user experience.   When someone presses CTRL-S you need to do a proper download.  Allow people to name the file, to place it in the folder of their choice etc. Workspaces aren't friendly.  The workspaces txt is in the appdata folder, which no lay user will understand how to access.  And there's no easy way to edit rooms within the workspaces folder.    Imagine going into your workspaces door, theres a button, you press it and a new door is created. The room has an invisible floor and a web surface that has all of the firebox code for that room.  From there you can build out the rest of the room while in the room."
janusVR,345jmy,konchok,2,Tue Apr 28 16:09:27 2015 UTC,"Perhaps janus should scrape through all subdirectories of the workspace folder when it's loaded, searching for html files.  It then dynamically creates a custom ""workspaces"" room which has portals with filesystem URLs to each of the searched-for HTML files.  Edit: this would make the workspaces.txt file obsolete.  But you're right, since it's been moved ""far away"" from the actual workspaces directory that's with the executable, getting rid of it may make more sense.  One downside of this approach though would be that workspaces MUST be a subdir in the workspaces folder, they can't be anywhere on your filesystem (with workspaces you can do ../../.. and so on and break out of it if you wish)"
janusVR,345jmy,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:35:57 2015 UTC,"How about a hybrid model, where you use the workspace.txt for directories that are not in the workspace folder, and ""scrape through all subdirectories of the workspace folder when it's loaded"""
janusVR,345jmy,konchok,2,Wed Apr 29 05:18:18 2015 UTC,"I'd add that when you create something in a room and hit control-s (or equivalent as hitting command-s has weird repercussions for me on mac), that what you've created now becomes a part of your room. I understand that this requires that 2 components be more closely integrated but it feels like that's what needs to happen.  It would also be useful if you could find something in the Janus world and copy it to add or modify in your own space. That would help users build content more quickly and with a look under the covers, hopefully understand things better.  Lastly, it would be nice to have some additional basics more easily accessible. Putting up a web surface, video or picture feels a little complicated right now for most people. In today's era of youtube and instagram, users should be able to easily add that type of content. As someone trying to transition from 2D web to 3D web, the first step will be to import content from their 2D web.  There are additional opportunities in the latter case where breaking down those 2D websites into objects that can be played with in 3D would be very helpful and provide users with quicker ways to transition something 2D over to 3D."

janusVR,345jmy,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:34:07 2015 UTC,"Which brings me to another point. VRsites needs to be useable from within VR. Currently you can only view rooms in VR.   I'd love to hear your thoughts on this as well.  There is a way to edit a room within VR Sites. You hit ESC and log in, then you have full access to the editor and can paste your code from a ctrl+s. Hit save and then refresh the room in VR. Sometimes caching get's in the way, so it's not an amazing experience but it works. It's clunky enough that I'd still rather not do this in VR, so like I said, I'd love to have more ideas around this."

Also a websurface on the first page that you can sign up would be good.  The goal is for it to be easier to sign up for vrsites in vr than on a 2d browser.  Also, an excellent example of editing in VR is the Usagii wiki.  And I think that there's a lot of improvement that could be done as well."

janusVR,345jmy,Atari_Historian,2,Wed Apr 29 11:20:26 2015 UTC,"Continuing konchok's idea of character creation. Maybe a fundamental thing that Janus is missing is a sort of set up process. First time users are immediately dropped in to the lobby with no opportunity to input their name or choose their skin, which leaves them feeling a bit confused. Having a set up room may provide new users with a greater sense of what's going on. Janus could recognise when it is opened for the first time (by checking for a userid file or something) and place new users in a 'new user lobby' that is more explicit with instructions, avatars to choose from and a door to the tutorial room."
janusVR,345jmy,JamesMcCrae,2,Tue Apr 28 23:57:15 2015 UTC,"I can't help but bring up a humorous analogy here.  TV guide.   I don't know if you've got that in your country (I'm from Canada), I think it's a north american thing.  It's like a magazine with the intent to assist you in tv viewing.  The idea of having a guide for watching television.  The options are literally: power, volume, band (uhf/vhf, back in the day) and channel.  Shows in the guide are time-indexed.  A company decided they should be the ""guide"" of this.  They did well!  With Janus it's like damn.  There are too many knobs compared to that."
janusVR,345jmy,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Wed Apr 29 09:10:06 2015 UTC,"Interesting parallel. It got me thinking about digital tv guides.  With set top boxes, the television guide is a 2D interface that communicates programme information, streamlines navigation and reveals complex functionality within the correct context to improve comprehension:  ""would you like to set a reminder?"" - when you press ok on a program that is not on yet  ""storage space approaching maximum"" - when you set something to record and you have less than 10% hd space left  I guess the equivalent for janus would be a 3D overlay that is displays when a button is held to show routes to destinations in order to assist in navigation and overlays of descriptive information when you look at certain objects or portals. Like this sort of thing."
janusVR,345jmy,dizzket,2,Wed Apr 29 10:19:08 2015 UTC,"Your image (funny by the way) reminds me of a tag built into HTML already (img's ""alt"" attribute), intended for browsers that historically were text-based or just not capable of rendering images.  There, you would define alternate text, just like you've done with each of the objects in that scene, to describe the content of the picture.  Really, this alternative visualization gets you to a more-abstract representation (language) that is closer to the markup/definition of content itself."
janusVR,345jmy,KlockoBL,2,Wed Apr 29 22:02:17 2015 UTC,"I think Lewis is on to something. I could see this sort of descriptive ""mouseover"" being immensely useful in a lot of things. The box would pop out of the object and face you, and give you useful information about the object.  Right now it's really hard to put information into Janus that looks presentable. If you want to, you either have to use a paragraph, or a bunch of lines of text. Sometimes, there's no room for this sort of stuff to stay, so it'd be cool to have it nested inside of things. (For instance, in the new homeroom, there's really no space to have informational text next to the gallery images.)  Perhaps the information could be a little more subtle, as well.  There could be a marquee above the chat log that tells you what you're looking at.   I'm sure this'd be way easier to implement than a floating chat box.  Also, this can be used to allow 2D browsers to see the contents of a room. You'd get a description like: ""A red wooden chair. A large television set. A statue of a naked dude taking a shit.""  This would also be useful to demonstrate information about portals you're about to enter."

Where as you mouse over something, the text description appears in a band and is context sensitive.   Another side note thing that I only half understand: Are elements like the text content of the chat log exposed and useable? For example, would it be possible to grab the text from the chat log and theoretically dump it on to a display like a pipboy in game using some fancy new text attribute like:  Text pos=""1 1 1"" fwd=""0 0 1"" col=""0.5 0.8 0.5"" scale=""2 2 2"" contents=""chatlog""  The reason I ask is that I believe the more access content creators can have to elements like this the better. This marquee idea could be another example. If this information was exposed, the community could do the work of figuring out how to make fancy pop up windows appear when you look at objects that contain the alternative descriptions. Just a thought :)"

janusVR,345jmy,codenamesrcl,1 point,Thu Apr 30 10:36:20 2015 UTC,"My brain went a different direction when reading your comment. From the thread below, maybe it wasn't really what you were driving at but:  The one thing that really bothers me about television and TV guides are the arbitrary mappings of channels. What do those numbers mean and why are we stuck with them? Networks still have a place, but pivoting off of other criteria is quickly becoming the norm. We're already breaking through time constraints with DVRs and on-demand, why are we still stuck with channel numbers that change based on geography and don't really mean anything to a viewer?  To navigate somewhere I don't want to have to click on or type in an obscured reference to what I want, I'd like something straightforward that I can remember without making other indirect associations. Web domains do this to a certain degree but even those can be cryptic esp. when adding folders and specific files. Bringing those over into Janus VR when not referencing a specific web site feels contrived. Strangely, I think that AOL had something with their keywords approach. Type in 'VRBar' and there's a portal that will take you there. Combined with search capability this would give users a much easier way to type in what they're looking for without having to write out or paste in an url. A good example right now is typing 'home' which brings you to the lobby. I'm not aware of other keywords, but getting around would be so much easier if I could just type in what I want instead of remembering an exact 10+ character url."

janusVR,3438qz,Atari_Historian,3,Mon Apr 27 23:23:41 2015 UTC,"For your observations,   VR hardware and software is evolving rapidly. There are limited rules for deciding what a metaverse is or how it should behave. It is difficult to create a metaverse. Competition already exists. There will more than one metaverse.   For all those reasons, This is why I think the winning metaverse will be the one who most openly encourages user created content for the first year or 2(until it's larger then any other, thus attracting the corporate class).  Open source, in this early phase, would likely be a major hindrance since it tends to slow innovation to a crawl as people bicker over what is added to the main branch.  Those reasons are also why I think the corporate based(profit first) approach of many Janus competitors will end in failure.     There will be many different possible sources of revenue for a metaverse provider to choose from.   This is true, and FAR FAR more potential then something like the current 2d browsers could ever dream of since the data acquisition and immersion is so much greater.    For the beliefs,  I agree with everything except the last point "" A metaverse is most likely to be created and maintained by a small team effort, web-based company, or gaming company (rather than the telco or an organzied non-profit model as given in science fiction).""  These early primitive forms of the metaverse are most likely to bring the best innovations... But to ""make it"" to the vast masses, there is no way a small low cap company can support such a vast undertaking as fundamental as the internet.

This effect is easy to see with the rift off, and you rotate the rift around with your hand and look at what is happening on the monitor at the edges of each eye view.  I agree though, it is annoying.  Hmm, I wonder how I could fix it.  Maybe setting some internal GL states for textures to clamp to edge instead of repeat before calling ovrHmd_EndFrame would fix it?

janusVR,33xuws,qster123,3,Sun Apr 26 18:03:10 2015 UTC,"Transparency is always an issue in non ray-trace/ray-cast based rendering pipelines. What you are likely seeing is the transparent bubble causing the opaque polygons inside of it to fail the depth-test which results in them not drawing. In order for that bubble to work it needs to draw after all opaque objects in the scene so that it doesn't cause any to depth-fails for them. The asynchronous nature of web requests is likely causing the order that objects finish loading and therefore the render order to not be deterministic which is why it's sometimes working and sometimes not. The transparent bubble will also cause issues for other opaque objects that may draw after it such as other avatars or room assets.  I'd just remove it and try to avoid transparency when possible for any rendered asset. It is the cause of quite a few rendering issues that require some very computationally expensive techniques to fix. You can Google ""Order Independent Transparency"" to find info on it.  An easy way to explain the problem is that each pixel rendered writes it's depth into a texture with the maximum depth value at the far-clip being 1 and the minimum depth at the near-clip being 0. Before a pixel has a fragment shader fired up for it it checks that it's depth value is less than or equal to the value that already exists at it's location (all positions default to 1). Because a transparent object will still write depth values to this buffer even if it is fully transparent when rendered it will cause any future fragment that is ""behind"" it in the world and therefore has a higher depth value to fail the depth-test which causes it to not render at all. It's an optimisation that saves fragment shader instances from being fired up for fragments that are occluded by others but it's not designed to handle transparent or translucent fragments."
janusVR,33xuws,Devlin1991,1 point,Sun Apr 26 20:36:21 2015 UTC,So how come in the old vr sites lobby I had chibiis inside a transparent ball and that always worked. Edit: awesome reply though thanks :D
janusVR,33xuws,Devlin1991,1 point,Sun Apr 26 20:46:21 2015 UTC,"It was likely just a string of luck that always resulted in the chibi object always rendering before the ball did, even in cases where that happened you would likely still see issues if you walked close enough to clip the ball into any other object or if other avatars walked behind it. The rooms that have lots of translucent tinted glass also suffer from this issue, you will often see other avatars vanish when they went behind one of the glass panes because it depth-fails them.  The low-cost workaround is to render all opaque objects before the transparent ones then sort transparent objects by their depth before rendering them in a back-to-front order so that the closest transparent objects don't depth-fail the further away ones. Sadly that technique has some limitations of it's own such as not being able to handle intersecting transparent objects among other things which is why there are some more complex techniques that solve most of the issues but come at a harsh performance penalty in comparison to just doing the cheap one and designing your scenes around the limitations."
janusVR,33xuws,Lewis_P,1 point,Sun Apr 26 20:55:28 2015 UTC,"I ran in to the same issue when I was playing around with translucent pngs in here. I wanted the ball around kerrigan to show the sky behind the walls. So I made it translucent (I seem to remember translucencies behaved differently to transparencies) and set it before or after (can't remember) the walls and it made it so that you could see through the walls when you look through the ball.  For your lobby you likely placed the chibis first, then placed the translucent ball on top. This meant that the chibis were called first, and were always displayed.[speculation as I know nothing about this stuff :)]  For your avatar, is there a way you can bring in the ball separately in the userid code and play around with the order of the code to see whether that effects it?"

You can tell adobe to remember your exception for that site, which translates over to janus too.

Then open in janus, and the exception is saved for that website forever.  Not exactly user friendly enough, but a step up from having to download and configure mumble.  I figured there might be a workaround of some kind, but it seems that auto allowing mic use is quite a security risk.  We need to ability to click the plugin windows.  edit, another hacky option...

janusVR,33jz9p,CrusaderOfMan,2,Thu Apr 23 03:15:35 2015 UTC,I'm borrowing one from work I like that there's a hardware mount Leap provides that attaches to the front of the Rift so I don't have to do a little DIY solution ;-) The tracking range kind of sucks though - I need to have my hands right in front of my face to get the finger tracking accuracy needed. I use it every now and then. I'd probably use it more if there was more integration with JanusVR and more practical uses apart from gimmicky stuff. I'd be interested in shooting lasers out of my hands (or performing open heart surgery). Uses in puzzles could be interesting for some precision controls. Flipping people off. Right now I'm sorta limited to doing that in GTA V. Not sure what you mean by this? Grasping stuff with a closed fist seems to be pretty standard functionality for picking up objects in other Leap demos that I've used.
janusVR,33jz9p,HAZARDU5,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:53:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! By the panel, I mean something like the ESC menu. If you could have icons that you select to toggle on/off what sorts of things would they do? Like open a websurface or teleport to home, create an asset, etc.  I'll edit to make it a little more clear. Thanks again!"

janusVR,33jz9p,JamesMcCrae,2,Sat Apr 25 20:47:14 2015 UTC,"Would like to participate, if it's cool :)  *1 Yes  *2 Tracking isn't robust, specific hand configurations self-occlude and are tough to track  *3 Interesting natural alternative input  *4 Any natural manipulations really  *5 Pointing well (though there's a way to get around this by creating a direction starting from the user eye, crossing through fingertip, and then out into the scene, which could work pretty well)  *6 No idea.  Something akin to the current main menu maybe, but where you could press the buttons?  A 2D browser that was fully leap-compatible would be sick (use leap to scroll two finger or actually click on things by pressing them with your index finger).  Damn, just realized I could implement this in a day probably...  *7 That one sucked :)  Better is this idea I brought up in 5, but you need to have some mechanism that says ""shoot/click now"".  A negative part of the leap input is there's no discrete guaranteed events you can measure, it's just points constantly moving in space.  *8 It's cool tech for sure, explore!"

And by take, I mean re-write to your standards :D No rush on getting that out though, there's probably more important things to do!"
janusVR,33jz9p,Lewis_P,2,Thu Apr 23 08:37:05 2015 UTC,"Yes I have the VR mount for it. I used to use a large piece of adhesive putty but it would sometimes fall off, swing on the cord, and swat me in the mouth, which was never fun. Most: world feels more real when I can see my hands. Least: Horrible tracking quality that you need to ""learn"" how to not cause it to freak out. Not often, there are not enough applications or games that I feel are improved by it, most of them I'd rather use a M+KB with. Gestures to interact with stuff like waving to open/close doors, gesture to enable a laser then pointing it with a finger to direct someone's attention to something, some crude IK to animate my avatar's hands(could be separate objects as a temporary workaround) to line up with the leap when the hands are visible. No one in particular, they all have uses. Having access to the full range of Leap info (pinch strength, gesture events, etc) as well as the raw inputs (so we can use a JS gesture library to extend the functionality) will open up way more ""doors"" so to speak for us to experiment with. I had an idea to spawn un-opened bookmarked portals on your finger tips then by tapping one with your other hand index finger they would detatch from your finger and scale up to connect with the floor say 2 meters in front of you and auto-open. I'd like to see the ability to make macros for janus interactions and bind them to an easy to use leap GUI similar to the SAO one or Hovercast. See examples in the two videos above. I'd like to see more interactivity in general in Janus rooms via Javascript so having each interaction use an abstraction layer would make it easy to have either a keyboard input or a leap gesture have the same result in the room. Building Leap only interactions is interesting but I think it's too niche to focus on and segmenting the small userbase isn't the best idea, the most interesting rooms are the ones that promote multi-user interaction and limiting it to only Leap users would just be mean ;)"
janusVR,33jz9p,Lewis_P,1 point,Sat Apr 25 20:39:33 2015 UTC,"Similarly, I detest the tracking and how screwy it can be. Gestures are a little tricky, but if you provide enough of a tolerance range you can get something to work. For example, I had experimented with the index and thumb together which worked alright but it wasn't nearly good enough to be relied on as a gesture.   Have you messed around with the hand positional data yet? I'm interested to see how you've implemented it, if you've done so (: I really like the idea of picking something off of one hand and having that cue another action!"
janusVR,33jz9p,Lewis_P,2,Mon Apr 27 18:53:40 2015 UTC,repost from here as I think it is relevant.   On Nuke's point about crosshairs landing on the nearest surface. I think it has been confirmed that this is how microsoft's hololens achieves 'gaze detection' and controller-less selections. I'm pretty sure it would be possible to mimic their method within janus using a 3d cross hair and leap. It would be really cool to be able to explore ideas for hololens within janus. How it works in hololens is that you look at what you want to select using a 3d cursor in the centre of your field of view that lands on the nearest surface. Next you make an L gesture with your finger and thumb to let it know you are ready to make a selection then tap your index finger to your thumb to confirm selection. If that could be achieved with leap within janus I'm pretty sure it will drive a large quantity of VR enthusiasts and developers to janus to check it out :)
janusVR,33iqne,HAZARDU5,2,Wed Apr 22 21:11:57 2015 UTC,This seems quite relevant to our interests. I know I'm often running into issues shifting from 2D design tropes to 3D VR experiences. Still have a lot to learn!

Janus is eventually going to get to big for a single home, so an offline one would probably be best.  But I do like the Ctrl+Key to set home, I wouldn't use H however. If a user is transferring all of their short-cut knowledge from a browser like chrome Ctrl+H goes to your history. Maybe Ctrl+N, that starts a new window or tab, so setting your home would work."

In addition, right now there's a button to ""show in 2d"", but I could add the reverse - a ""show in 3D"" button that could spawn a portal to view the site in 3D, allowing you to go back and forth between these dimensions a little more easily."

I have got an autoconverter kicking around that can convert janus scenes to scenevr content. Currently the best thing to do is to build your scenes for scenevr, then you can view then with scene or janus, and it'll work on the scene mobile viewer. Adding janus loading to scene is doable, but I don't know how multiplayer would work, and reimplementing the janus javascript API would be massive:  tldr: build it using scenevr markup to view in janus or on mobile :)"

The javascript between janus and scene is similair, but scene has scenequery, so you can use a jQuery like api for your scripts.

Downside to this is that it makes it difficult to avoid walking in to a portal and trolls might make it difficult to get around by surrounding you with portals :)   This would essentially be a toggle to turn on 'proximity open' with 'no live preview'. This option could include 'live preview upon click'.  At least with this option you wouldn't see in to the room unless you clicked it. You could still accidentally walk in to it though, so it's not perfect."

On another note, on the latest 40.x versions, it seems I can't get vsync to switch of, even if it works fine in 39.3.  So I can't really give you any stats on if it's any better there or not.

So if we take away the usual 20-50% of the open source driver and then another generous 20% for PRIME rendering offloading, it's still underperforming badly here. At least that is good to know.  The CPU usage of Janus VR is around 85%. The GPU load is about 40-50%.  Hm... It might be the job of a profiler to figure out what the problem is here.

There's a distance from portals where Janus still renders views through portals due to large FOV (via rift and such displays) and portal dimensions (portal might be huge) and so on.  You need to both not look at it and be some distance away from it that is proportional to its size.  I made it conservative so the portal always renders through and there's no graphics problems for FOV up to 180.  Also, of course there is an FPS hit rendering a view through a portal - it's rendering another room, and there are then multiple stages of rendering.    Regarding use of mesa, I think you are alone.

janusVR,32m4zs,magicleapmotionfrog,2,Tue Apr 14 22:05:18 2015 UTC,"tldr: Content is king, communities sprout around content and the two feed each other to sustain, service loyalty rather than ""room"" loyalty for visitorship, make stuff that is unique to the web.  May the service be with you, cuz the Force may not be if it's a non-magic zone.  I think that it will become less about coming back to the same room than it will be to coming back to the same place.  I make that distinction only because the space can change but the base location doesn't change.  IE same address, different content than before.  We have a loyalty to services now adays and this plays well with the VR web as it's an extension of service based loyalty.  I think that the social aspect of VR still requires at least some content to gather around to seed the community and sustain itself beyond the initial ""wow"" period.  It's like going to a bar to socialize and yet there's no drinks, food, or music, it's just not doable without something to jumpstart everything.  Booze everybody up, that's always a fun time.  With the VR web and the metaverse concept, I think it will be very much the same though with regards to continued visitorship.  Any place that you take a fancy to, whether it's for it's content or it's community, falls under the revisitable category (reddit is a testament to the latter being seeded by the former and continuously sustained by the cycle of content and community, drill down further for particular subreddits but I see reddit being like a planet and each subreddit being an island or region).  The content or promise of content drew you there, and the continued service of social or content or both keeps you coming back just to check in.    Example: I usually don't read the same article multiple times on my favorite news site, yet I come back to the base site often to see if there's anything new.  The counter would be with a specific youtube video I guess so maybe not so strong an argument, maybe more for the particular content type of focus.  Games, video sites, broad spec social media, traditional news sites, all of these services include in some form this pattern of serving content to startup and community to sustain via the loop.  Bring on the cat picture bars and Youtube lounges!  And Ready-Player-One style game planets with zone rules, i'm down for that.  I still go back to one of Josh Carpenter's comments regarding WebVR content and how it should differentiate itself from standalone VR applications.  This was from one of the metaverse panels that James was a part of actually, great talk overall.  The whole dynamic mashup concept where we leverage the web's open content mentality to mash different pieces of content together into something cool.  I think we'll see the popularity of continuous-space based aggregators in that 5-10 year span you are talking about as it offers something to experience that's not quite so trivial to construct outside of the web realm (tried a few experiments based on this idea a little while ago, it's cool stuff, if the generation is done appropriately and consistently, and the choice of content sources meshes well, I may have another go at it later this year once I get some other stuff done).  Edit: include additional brick and mortar content to build up that wall of text, also some additional notes"
janusVR,32m4zs,codenamesrcl,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:25:33 2015 UTC,"Interesting read and I agree about the power of good experiences. Content that facilitates good experiences will be key to the success of platforms like janusvr. Interestingly, I don't think all good experiences depend on complex content. Geometrically and codedly(?) simplistic content can be sufficient to trigger a sense of awe (the precursor to the desire to tell others of your experience).   In order to experience something it must engage with you on some level either passively through visuals/audio, or through a responsive system that reacts to you in some way. There are probably an infinite array of possible experiences the human mind can have. I'd imagine the range is constrained slightly for VR representations of experiences, but still vast. It would be interesting to study what attributes make for an awe inspiring experience in VR and examine how they differ from 'real life' experiences.  Omegle has a hook, it places you in front of strangers and allows you to communicate openly. This unusual situation works because of the freedom of expression and anonymity that it provides. Experiences like this have been successful in the 2D web, but I'm not sure exactly the equivalent for the VR space. Maybe only time will tell what the most successful experiences will be in VR. Also, they probably won't remain successful as we've seen with the 2D web. Experiences can become stale and must evolve to continue to be stimulating :)"

Does janus recognise that the file is not obj before trying to download it to other users? If so how and where does it do this recognising? My guess is that the local client for the user with the .exe for an avatar does the checking and only 'broadcasts' the userid if the file works. I dunno :)"
janusVR,32lysv,Lewis_P,2,Wed Apr 15 09:39:15 2015 UTC,it would open the file and try to decode the obj as an obj nothing more
janusVR,32lysv,samrudloff,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:00:45 2015 UTC,fair enough :)
janusVR,32lysv,Lewis_P,2,Wed Apr 15 13:03:07 2015 UTC,"like sam said, janus would download the file in question, and then decode the file using a given reader, in this case something for reading the obj model format specifically.  If it's not a valid obj then nothing more is done other than throwing some exception stating that the file is not a valid obj possibly.  It's not like it's starting it like an independent application or code block (ie a script or call order)  It's the reason why archives hidden behind images are possible (among other reasons), depending on what you use to read the file, it could be a straight image (a very large image for it's resolution maybe) but open it in 7-zip and it's a legit compressed archive.  But man it works great for comic books where the image can be the cover."
janusVR,32lysv,codenamesrcl,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:08:55 2015 UTC,"Very interesting. In my ignorance about the topic I guess I'm just irrationally scared of 'malicious files' because I literally don't know what they are capable of actually doing.    janus would download the file in question, and then decode the file using a given reader, in this case something for reading the obj model format specifically.   So is there any legitimate reason to fear that a malicious file downloaded by janus as instructed by a userid.txt could actually do something malicious while chilling out in the 'cache' folder? (guessing the cache is where it would go, unless it never makes it way to other users because janus doesn't bother if an exception is declared)  The obvious parallel I can think of is to web browsers. Websites contain fairly typical content that is downloaded immediately upon opening a page. However when a site tries to force a download of a different type of file or in a different kind of way, like when you click on a download button or whatever, you are prompted by the browser to confirm that you want to download the file. I guess this safeguards against websites auto-downloading malicious software on to your computer. Does janus have safeguards like this? Does it need safeguards like this? Am I over thinking this? haha"
janusVR,32lysv,Lewis_P,2,Wed Apr 15 13:52:10 2015 UTC,"it's not a bad thing to consider the security implications of implementations, particularly since we are treating janus like a web browser and rendering engine and for the most part we've been operating on an honor system of sorts with regards to content and interaction.  I'm not an expert in the security aspects of browsers, particularly with the current vectors for spyware/malware beyond the bugged executables and cookie tracking.  I just use common sense on the web and it's been working.  I don't know how Janus operates at a system/code level now adays, though I can imagine how based on how I would do things.  Will we need more security safeguards and filtering, absolutely, directed towards what vectors, that I'm not so certain of.    My first inclination would be to look at how the Javascript layer will interact with the Janus core going forward, as JS is always a prime candidate.  Eventually we will need a more fleshed out API to do requests and other server interactions."

Before the day began you lacked the knowledge, but by the end of it you implemented the feature.  So I think that jump, to where you were before and after, the length of that chasm, might be some way to express quantitatively what ""hard"" is.  So, subjectively, and it might not satisfy you, but the hardest updates were those things least considered since they are low level - for instance switching everything to VBO from my old-school OpenGL knowledge.  Though there was a very tangible FPS gain in that case.  Another example is the portal system itself.  But this was a mental exercise.  I think this was a great breakthrough in creativity, I don't think the world has ever seen a seamless internet browser where you could peer through websites.  I do think I invented that (and I'm looking now at everything historically).  And of course related to that is implementation, so yes of course the invention of that feature could be considered a ""hard update"" (it was quite a bit of work to implement)."

Re: a, b, c.  sin() is cyclic about 2PI (one route about the circle in a unit called radians), so thing_a scales the rate at which that happens.  Thing_b is an addition (hey I know sin() evaluates between -1 and 1 so I'm offsetting it by thing_b), and thing_c multiplies to take a value that ranges between 0 and 2 (when thing_b = 1) to some scale that is real (I chose 4.9 because 4.9*2 = 9.8 which is acceleration of gravity on Earth)"

janusVR,32ar1x,NXT_Aussie,3,Sun Apr 12 10:43:13 2015 UTC,"In terms of the markup (and no offense Ben if you're reading) SceneVR markup is a subset of the functionality in JanusVR.  So I piped it in that way.  This is obvious if you press Ctrl+S in a SceneVR room, you'll see exported (roughly) equivalent JanusVR markup."
janusVR,32ar1x,autowikibot,3,Sun Apr 12 11:02:35 2015 UTC,"No I totally agree, scenevr is just slowly implementing things that Janus has done for ages, so this seems like a totally sensible way to add support for scene."

janusVR,32b7pz,The_Real_Black,2,Sun Apr 12 06:33:34 2015 UTC,"Feedback on bad user experiences is far more valuable than feedback on good experiences :)   Your comments highlights a problem. I'm just not sure about the correct solution. I think it's important that website owners have complete control over the content on their sites. However I do understand the need to protect the user from exceptionally annoying experiences. Or at least ensure the the user can always escape the experiences. I think the current measures do a pretty good job of allowing this with f to fly and backspace to go back.   I think there is a problem with esc menu occlusion. Perhaps it should be closer, like an open magazine in front of you, rather than 6 foot columns of buttons. Maybe it should always be spawned at the height of the eye position too to ensure that the tall and short avatars are catered to.   I think there is also a problem with falling through the floor when the rooms models have not loaded by the time you enter. Again, probably the fault of the content creator and not janus, but a measure to prevent this might be useful nonetheless.   Your comments might hit a nerve with some because some of the issues you raised are not really to do with janus but with the content the community has created :)   Edit: would you be able to provide links to the rooms you think are broken so that we can see if we can fix them?  Depends on who owns the room really, but there's a chance the owners will be on this sub reddit."

janusVR,32b7pz,NXT_Aussie,1 point,Sun Apr 12 06:46:26 2015 UTC,yes  that is why janus will fail.   the user can always create portals why wold you like to stop him from moving a broken portal? makes no sense.  Edit: there a some rooms (like the redit default room) with a broken back portal you can not move thou the statue the backportal is clipping in so you want this broken stuff? not going back? not nice for an user experience...
janusVR,32b7pz,konchok,2,Sun Apr 12 07:06:41 2015 UTC,"""This is why janus will fail""   You're being an alarmist for no good reason.  If you don't like his room don't go to it.  And better yet, make your room with your rules.  If your rules are better people will go to your room.  Don't be abusive with your posts or comments on reddit."
janusVR,32b7pz,Lewis_P,2,Sun Apr 12 07:19:11 2015 UTC,The reddit room translator is broken on Mac I think. So the entrance portal enters in the middle of the room and the walls are blank (havnt checked this recently but it was broken a couple of days ago I think)
janusVR,32b7pz,NXT_Aussie,1 point,Sun Apr 12 10:32:22 2015 UTC,"Users can't always create portals, a lot of this is room/server controlled. janus is not my room, or my server. janus is just  the platform.  This allows anyone, to do anything - no-one gets to decide on 'the rules', that is left up to us.  EDIT  We have been chatting, and a 'get me the hell out of here' button is something that would be good for janus, takes you back to the previous room."
janusVR,32b7pz,Lewis_P,1 point,Sun Apr 12 07:12:20 2015 UTC,Maybe a button combo would make more sense if the user is stuck without being able to use the esc menu. Personally I have not experience a situation I could not get out of by back spacing or pressing f to stop myself falling
janusVR,32b7pz,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Sun Apr 12 10:29:46 2015 UTC,+1 for the button lets use backspace   like teleport player back to entrance and stop every skript and if the player would fall auto fly mode.   but it is the users experience do you force the user into YOUR experience or would it be better to let ihm HIS experience?  my opinion is clear the users experience first!

Having interesting places and things to do is valuable and drive more people to try Janus out.  Beyond that, maybe more in the ways of tools or tutorials or other how-to type guides.  The server code portion is completely open so if you guys come up with new ideas there to do something that couldn't be done before which could be compelling I'm happy to explore those possibilities too.  I have a couple ideas of my own on that front I've not been sharing too much because I think they have some huge potential, and they could fit really well with the Janus system.  Making this a subject for one of the weekly/every-other-week get togethers is a possibility too.  Have a collaborative brainstorm :)"

janusVR,31l31z,dizzket,3,Mon Apr 6 02:53:57 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest problem James faces with accepting the communities help is that what we would contribute would probably not fit well in the overall design of Janus. Only he knows how it all works together, and I'm sure he's thorough when developing new code to implement, something that we might not be as proficient at as he would be.  Personally I think the best thing the community could do to give James a helping hand is advertise and bring as many people as we can to Janus to experience how amazing this idea really is. Examples would be things like the reddit room translation and how it makes Janus look a little bit more impressive to first time users. We could help write guides, like update the HTML doc (http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~mccrae/projects/firebox/notes.html) or improve on the JS implementation doc (http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~mccrae/projects/firebox/js.html).   I think the biggest reason Janus hasn't gained as much traction as it should (and thus resulting in potential business opportunities for James) is because the expectation the user has when first trying Janus isn't exactly met, for lack of better words. Janus offers huge potential but it's not clearly mentioned when you first get inside. You don't see how easy it is to make a web room, how easy it can be to change your avatar, how with a little bit of effort you can manipulate your HTML assets through the coordinate grid using JS, you don't actively see all of the regular members of Janus walking around the lobby or even know if anybody else is connected to join you in your adventures through the 3D web or ask them for a few pointers or cool things to see.  Maybe we could all band together to collaborate on a new room where the best things in Janus are presented to you the first time you log in. Instead of connecting to the lobby after a first time download, you would spawn here and the information would be right there in front of you. I know Dizzket made a simple tutorial room a while back, but I think it's about time to improve upon that.  Spawn in on a ride through Janus, press enter when ready to begin the tour, which will move you through an explanation of what's up. ""Welcome to the 3D web! You can visit web pages by entering links through -tab-."" | ask player to enter a website, animation to signal left click to open the portal and when they walk back out the ride will resume. ""Normal 2D websites will render inside of a cube for you to browse normally while special web rooms use Firebox markup to generate 3D webrooms."" Take them to a websurface that shows a basic Firebox Room with the doorway next to it, showing them the contents. Show them how easy it is to make a sketchup model, export as dae and implement. Or even by creating something with primitives like in the sandbox.  Sorry for writing an essay... But I had to throw the ideas out there. We all would love to help James, but he's the only one that can do the actual source programming. The best alternative we can provide is try to make the end users experience better, right from the draw. Suck them in and give them something to stay for, show them why we stick around and the potential we see, how drastically different Janus is from any other program you've downloaded and how one day it WILL change the world."
janusVR,31l31z,CrusaderOfMan,2,Mon Apr 6 20:49:48 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. The success of JanusVR is heavily dependant on its first time users understanding what JanusVR is capable of. I fear there is a disconnect between what the regulars (us) and the newcomers perceive to be 'JanusVR'. I don't think the issue is to do with the functionality of the client as it is already more than capable of delivering incredible experiences and opportunities to everyone with a DK2. The issue is in the communication of these capabilities to first time users.  [In my opinion] At it's core, JanusVR is a multiplayer 3D representation of the 2D web. Primarily, it allows users to explore the web in 3D with others. Secondarily, it allows users to create new content associated with their own websites and share it with others. These are not the easiest concepts to communicate. Currently, I'm not sure either of these core functions are made clear to Joe Bloggs when he enter JanusVR for the first time. I suspect he sees a lobby surrounded by billboards and doesn't know what to think of it. Maybe we should be doing short surveys in Janus of the people we suspect to be first time users to find out what they are thinking.  The good news is that I believe this is something that can be remedied by the community (us) and does not depend on new functionality or bug fixes etc. It is a problem that can be solved by some clever infographics, interactive tutorials, automated guided tours, amongst other things. Perhaps it could be a topic for an upcoming Saturday get together?"
janusVR,31l31z,Lewis_P,2,Mon Apr 6 21:20:57 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, we could definitely try to get as much feedback as possible out of Saturday's get-togethers. I think we could come up with a small list of important questions we could ask that would give us some great feedback. I would even go as far as creating a room/websurface site for it, where the new user could submit a simple form that outlines the questions, which we could then sort through together and collaborate on new ideas from the info.  Bottom line, we need to figure out the best ways to present the full potential of Janus without overwhelming the first time user. It'll be a challenge, but I definitely think it'll help Janus gain the traction it deserves."
janusVR,31l31z,CrusaderOfMan,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:16:19 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of chatting about it possibly during the get togethers.  I think those events draw the ""newer"" crowd in and it's good to get their candid feedback too"
janusVR,31l31z,JamesMcCrae,2,Mon Apr 6 23:50:33 2015 UTC,I did a little illustration to demonstrate what Janus is since it really is hard to tell what potential lies inside of Janus when you first spawn in.

janusVR,31l5d7,Nukemarine,2,Mon Apr 6 02:48:50 2015 UTC,"I definitely like the idea of the server side being able to provide more functionality. Perhaps it would enable others to help take off some of the burden from James.  I'm not sure how it would technically work yet, but if a page had something like a <server></server>  tag that the client could send to the server with a specific api call or event that the server could then trigger a plugin or something and send data back to the client afterwards perhaps. I dunno.  It would be neat though if you could go to, say, any vrsites.com room and always have some sort of extra feature provided by the vrsites server. For example a simple login system that works in conjunction with our room management system."
janusVR,31l5d7,sirkitree,2,Mon Apr 6 03:29:50 2015 UTC,Just be warned: This will create a lot more traffic than you might think...
janusVR,31l5d7,macromarco83,2,Mon Apr 6 06:35:59 2015 UTC,"Right. Many to one might not be a great solution, but the idea of the server side trying to take off some of the load, however it might be worked out technically, I think has merit. Trying to look for solutions, not just problems is the point."
janusVR,31l5d7,sirkitree,2,Mon Apr 6 13:29:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if specifying server config within the client markup is a great idea.  Rather why not have the hosting server have a page (in this case room) management system akin to your standard CMS where you can control not only the content of the page/room (in our case the markup, but I see something like a WYSIWYG style WebGL world builder for the far future for those who don't want to mess with markup too much) but also page/room level config before publishing/updating.  Now a server api for the client is a different thing altogether, and I'd really like to see the JS side being able to send related requests via the already existing socket.  That is unless the chat server is separated from the raw multiplayer server, you know what I mean :).  So if the server is supposed to host some kind of netcode/gameserver support, then the game script on the client side can properly interact with the server side core."
janusVR,31jly3,qster123,6,Sun Apr 5 18:51:53 2015 UTC,"These things aren't high priority.    There are things like broken windowed mode, broken OSX support, broken direct-to-rift mode on AMD hardware, and general issues with crashing that are fundamental and so more important than tacking on additional 10-30 minute things.  I've done this feature tack-on stuff plenty historically and it's cool for a minute and then the interest in it dies, and people still struggle with the fundamental problems.  Sorry I seem in a bad mood, just finished with being yelled at and not getting enough sleep.  It might seem like I do nothing but I spent all my free moments on this."
janusVR,31jly3,JamesMcCrae,5,Sun Apr 5 20:45:03 2015 UTC,"Someone said it's your birthday, so happy birthday dude c: You're putting so much effort out, and it can be hard to try to find motivation when everything fills up with requests and bug reports.

janusVR,31jly3,konchok,2,Sun Apr 5 21:37:57 2015 UTC,"We all know you've been working hard.  The more features that are added the more things break.  You need to get things less broken so that it's possible to add more features in the future.   But don't think for a second that features that you add don't get used.  Sometimes it just takes a bit for someone to figure out where it's useful.  Fog is a good example.  I've been using fog a lot more recently because I've figured out how it worked.  And lastly, I'll admit that I'm guilty of asking for the ""easy quick 30 minute feature"", and some of that has to do with a general lack of them as you increase performance and breadth of JanusVR.  But what the most important thing is (   and it's not javascript :)   ) is your health.     You've accomplished by yourself what entire teams of software engineers have failed at.  But we don't want you to be  a Martyr James.     You're awesome, have a good day!"

Totally empathize with you - I've been trying to develop a bunch of content related stuff done in Janus and it's taking way longer than I expected due to the complexities of building things from scratch around a new engine and doing the 3D modelling work. Trying to find a nice work/personal projects/life balance is also tricky for me right now.  Definitely focusing on the critical areas like stability totally have to come first - there's already a lot of toys in the JanusVR sandbox already. I'm sure we can wait a bit longer for new cool stuff :-)

janusVR,31hrmw,rod156,1 point,Sun Apr 5 06:19:50 2015 UTC,"Also, although minor, I might note that settings are destroyed (settings.txt, bookmarks.txt, etc) when replacing the app (OS X bundles copy whole, they don't keep diffs) so one should ship a script to be ran before deploying new versions or have the settings stored in Application Support.  Just a suggestion."
janusVR,31hrmw,rod156,1 point,Sun Apr 5 06:30:17 2015 UTC,"Oh really?  To my knowledge the .app is actually a directory containing the files.  The disk image dmg which contains this .app directory does not contain any settings.txt, bookmarks.txt and so on, instead these are all generated by janusvr in the /Contents/MacOS subdirectory of the .app on first execution.    So there shouldn't be a problem when you copy it over a ""fresh"" version of Janus because it doesn't include these files."
janusVR,31hrmw,rod156,2,Sun Apr 5 06:45:09 2015 UTC,"In OS X, .app bundles are treated as if they were single files by Finder (although like you mentioned, they're actually folders), so when you copy and replace the current app installation, any internal folders are cleared (since the new copy doesn't have those txts, and Finder doesn't merge/keep older files from the old bundle).  This doesn't apply if one copies the app to a new location, but then you'll have to copy the settings from the old app's MacOS to the new one."

janusVR,31hrmw,The_Real_Black,2,Sun Apr 5 06:20:23 2015 UTC,"I'm having a bug where Windows doesn't have a windows icon for Janus.  To be more specific.

janusVR,31hrmw,qster123,1 point,Sun Apr 5 08:18:21 2015 UTC,"Awesome improvements! :D  The JS IDs should be prefaced by a unique user number, because when people build they often overwrite each others creations (this made the sandbox contest at the social event impossible)"
janusVR,31ia7d,The_Real_Black,2,Sun Apr 5 09:51:30 2015 UTC,"I would have turned off the multiplayer if I cared.  Also, the portal you see carries no information other then the address and the user who made it.  They can't see the IP address under any circumstances since the client of any user is only connected to the intermediary multiplayer server.  While it's in alpha release, I think Janus should not start in a default 'multiplayer off' until the program gets the core ideas in place.  Security is a primary concern, but innovation sometimes breaks some eggs to make an omelet (to quote an American aphorism).  If others are concerned about this, please voice it  For the time being, turn off the multiplayer if you are working with sensitive content. (this is a multiplayer internet browser)   For any content developers, designating locked=""true"" will turn off collaboration for anything, including the websurfaces."

Like moving other players or blocking them by creating objects their ways without a noclip mode or going offline and edit mode to remove the blockade there is no protection to this. even with edit mode alone the object will be transmitted again if it is moved again, deleting a object alone is not enough. (I noticed the update with the spam blocker for links +1 for it James)   And Janus is transmitting some informations like the Username in this case at least there should be a protection for local files and folders. Like is the target 127.0.0.1 or a local folder the portal it shouldn't be shared with others and it makes only sense if it is a shared directory every one can reach it like a folder on a server.    i hope for an solution i can define witch user can see my action and potals like ""add FFG to shared content list""  so you can decide ""add TRB to accepted shared content list"" so you can see my actions and if i add you we can work together in the same rooms. it should be like a handshake nothing one sided/rough on-off like the multiplayer mode is like now. wee need something fine tunable:   multiplayer on should be ""see other users"" in the rooms. (everything on off) accepted shared content list (ASCL) i see someone elses actions (if he is sending it to me) ""trusted users"" (send) shared content list (SSCL) i send actions to specific users (if he is accepting it) ""trustworthy users"""

PS I will delete the image in some hours.  Edit2: You see the player in the background? He is not using flight mode he was moved by a box upward! XSS everywhere!!!"
janusVR,31ia7d,HAZARDU5,1 point,Sun Apr 5 09:54:14 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't see the problem with being able to block other players or move them around using objects. Wouldn't be much fun if the objects you placed had no impact on other people around you. I enjoy making staircases and tree-like structures precisely because other players can climb on them.   In my opinion a noclip mode would damage the experience. If you don't want to be hindered by a particular griefer or object, then turn off multiplayer until you have moved to where you want to move to, then turn it back on again. There is obviously scope for griefers, but there should always be scope for griefers. We shouldn't limit the experience for the majority just to prevent the minority :)  As for our private information. All firefox has done by creating that portal in Janus, is the direct equivalent of what you have done in a 2D browser by posting a screenshot of his directory. It is not the fault of Janus (in his case) or your browser (in your case) for allowing you to do this. It is the responsibility of the user to take care of their private information. If FirefoxG chose to be more cautious with his portal placement, the issue would not have arisen. But he probably isn't that fussed about it.  All that said, there are probably other more hidden privacy issues that I'm not aware off and I'm sure James is on the case with whatever they might be."

janusVR,31gwl3,CrusaderOfMan,1 point,Sun Apr 5 01:04:18 2015 UTC,"Basically, yes.  Just a persistent web surface with a voice communication system embedded.  If James made some changes to broadcast out position data, then the page could, in theory, allow for positional sound like mumble already does it.  The text chat could also be included on this layer, making the chat log a defacto web view for voice, camera and/or text."
janusVR,31gwl3,CrusaderOfMan,1 point,Sun Apr 5 01:10:26 2015 UTC,"I like where you're head is at on this, I think it could definitely work if done right. You would only transmit position data if 1, you enable it and 2, you must be connected to the web address of the communication client, otherwise the server doesn't have to constantly deploy the position of everybody in Janus. If the client were to be hosted from janusvr.com or another trusted site like vrsites, we could potentially open the possibility of file/asset sharing by uploading and downloading the files through the websurface. We could even disguise it as a phone or something xD  I propose the idea of having a personal dashboard, where you can toggle a websurface to act something like a smartphone. It would be a local HTML file so you can modify the layout to suit your preferences and add/remove components of the dashboard. From here you can connect to the chat service, view your assets and downloaded files (provided we can have the folders added to our local files), switch through your different avatar setups, etc. It would be neat if we could add to the options of the dashboard from our own webrooms, allowing us to display information/settings and such specifically when you are within the room boundaries."

The OSX version has the blending stuff commented out.  You can try uncommenting it and you'll see the shader stops working correctly once you uncomment more than one attribute in the calculations (attribs which are unreferenced iin main() do not get compiled in).  I think this is a limitation of OpenGL on this particular platform.  The solution is likely to modernize the OpenGL version I'm using and use a core profile.

I looked at few js libraries for circuit design, and there totally might be something out there, but they all seem so tied up with the canvas ui that it might be a lot of work to make them useable in Janus (unless you were just to stick it on a websurface, but that kind of defeats the point of the 3d visualization).

Rooms  The rooms themselves are stored in the database on the old site, and those will be migrated to the new site as 'nodes' and if you're email matches between the old site and the new, then you will have these listed underneath 'My Rooms'.  Domains, such as zion.vrsites.com I'm hoping will migrate alright as well. The plan there is to just redirect any of the subdomains to the main domain. So a link such as http://john.vrsites.com/1/537/ should redirect to http://vrsites.com/1/537/ which in turn will redirect to the url for the migrated node (which is based off of the author and title of the node).   So in this instance, http://john.vrsites.com/1/537/ will ultimately turn into http://vrsites.com/sirkitree/welcome-to-the-bitgridio  Hope that all made sense!"

janusVR,30sjuw,dizzket,2,Mon Mar 30 10:13:55 2015 UTC,"The figures on the top left and bottom right are an abstraction of the faces of the god, Janus. The arrow is a bit of a motif representing telecommunication across the world, the mouse cursor, and moving through space. I'm not so sure about the arrow on the letter ""U"", though, but I decided to include it anyways. The letters ""VR"" have their own horizon, and the effect is meant to symbolize something of a window, as if you were peering into another world.  The catchphrase is a play on ""world wide web"" :D  I was bored at 3 AM and decided to do this. If I ever completed it, it'd be done in Illustrator, similar to https://imgur.com/a/CSrp7 and https://imgur.com/a/w19xJ  The font was inspired by Ready Player One, and the colour scheme is a bunch of different shades of greenish and extremely subtle blue for no real reason whatsoever. The geometric style I was going for was something of heavy angles contrasted by the curvature.   Any criticism? :D"
janusVR,30sjuw,Lewis_P,3,Mon Mar 30 10:16:33 2015 UTC,"Looks really interesting. I didn't see the faces until you pointed them out and I think they are the most intriguing part and probably deserve more emphasis :) They looked to me like the icon for 'new file', which is interesting.   I'd be tempted to make more of deal out of the portals, but its difficult to not evoke Portal  I made a cheeky little alteration, hope you don't mind :)  The arrows now play off each other and sort of imply a portal with two faces looking through it.  EDIT: Might have a little too much emphasis on 'down arrows' now, which imply downloading to most people.  EDIT2: Hmmm, upside down doesn't really help"
janusVR,30sjuw,Lewis_P,3,Mon Mar 30 10:32:19 2015 UTC,"Oh, the rotated look is really interesting! Yeah, perhaps either through contrast or by geometrically defining the faces more I could get them to stick out better. They're also definitely a lot more visible in the rotated version.   I tried doing something with portals, but getting portals, the heads, and some sort of indication of the internet into a logo is hard without making it look too busy.   Thanks for the comment! :D I really appreciate it."

janusVR,30sjuw,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Mon Mar 30 11:27:17 2015 UTC,"So i've dabble a bit today when I've had time to.  here's a little food for thought  I think the current janus logo works because of it's recognisable silhouette. So i've played around with the figurative faces in your idea in the same general layout as the original janus logo. I put a box around the one I think works ok, but still needs some work. It retains the two faces, with the addition of a hint of a location pin. The pin also suggests a V, for virtual maybe. The arrows as eyes might suggest multiple players...... if you squint and imagine the main pin is player one and the two down arrows are other player locations... bit of a stretch but meh haha. With a bit of work it could convey that idea."

I've deactivated it in nvidia-settings and verified it with glxgears, but the framerate sticks to 61fps in desktop mode.    EDIT: Wow, cpu usage has dropped radically too!! Loving the ability to resize the window independent of aspect ratio :D I have had some problems with using ovr 0.5 so I haven't bothered to test rift mode yet. (Ubuntu 14.04.2 as always) Have you tested rift on linux with 0.5 ? I haven't had much luck with ovr 0.5 since testing it yesterday, hence why I'm asking if you managed to get it running properly. For example, if I open the Config utillity for 0.5 and try to measure IPD, the rift's display just flashes between black and white. Same happens on my main monitor when I set the rift to clone my main monitor. Back to Janus: Have you changed how portals work? When opening a portal, everything you see through the portal before you enter it is rendered behind the portal as if the portal slices the new room there the portal is spawned.. very strange and a bit cool at the same time :P JVR segfaults when exiting some video rooms, open youtube.com, click on a video or two (they don't play, just the loading circle and no audio) then exit the room and the segfaults.

To replicate, start janus, open esc menu, try to click on the bottom third of a button that has a button beneath it, upon press the button below is activated.

janusVR,30id3k,konchok,1 point,Fri Mar 27 19:21:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, works fine in the rift.  It has no way of grabbing the head track values from the rift, but in practice this doesn't matter because the sphere is so large relative to the realistic tracking volume of the rift (tracking offset from rift is maybe up to around 2-3 ft, in a sphere with a 960 m diameter, that's like 0.07 % offset, so negligible).  Basically it just centers the sphere at eye_pos offset from player.pos. Check out the last room I posted to /r/vrsites for and example, just add a bunch of primitives to see the skyboxy effect (though honestly most of those 3d images make poor skyboxes due to foreground objects)."
janusVR,30id3k,Devlin1991,1 point,Sat Mar 28 00:06:36 2015 UTC,"Cubemaps are inherently better as the texels per degree of your view is more even across the entire sphere of viewing, EQ maps often have seam artefacts at the poles. You could position a cube the same way and use a cubemap instead, or use 6 quads and have a texture per-face, this is how Janus does it skyboxes normally."
janusVR,30id3k,Devlin1991,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:14:35 2015 UTC,"Agree entirely (I typically use cubemaps when I can), but when creating a site/room that pulls from web assets, it could be desirable to use equirectangular images because of their prevalence online.  This allows you to quickly link up to existing assets somewhere on the web already in this format, without having to figure out how do the conversion to cubemaps and separate images on the fly. And with the resolution limitations of the rift, a good quality equirectangular looks just fine."

janusVR,30erg7,konchok,4,Thu Mar 26 19:56:21 2015 UTC,"I'm on my phone but I'll post the link when I wake up. A great alternative to using any of the Janus collision code is to use a JS physics library and let that handle everything including the player movement. I had the beginnings of a ""Wipeout"" style obstacle course using this method but it's on hold until I finish up Uni. I'm a pretty big advocate of the ""room"" being in charge of everything with Janus only serving as a renderer with some added QoL stuff like the mumble integration and room navigation.  Most of the features you want can be added via JS libraries, I see Janus as a web browser not a game engine but I think integrating a few JS libraries by default into Janus would make things easier for everyone, especially if they need tweaked to mesh nicely with Janus. Better to do that once than have to update shared links to the modified libraries everytime an update breaks something."

janusVR,308gy2,konchok,3,Wed Mar 25 09:17:31 2015 UTC,"Synopsis for the lazy :)    USER INTERFACE DESIGN  ● The “physical” design of interactive elements in VR should afford particular uses.  ● Every interactive object should respond to any casual movement.  ● Clearly describe necessary gestures with text-based prompts.  ● Interactive elements should be appropriately scaled.  ● Place text and images on slightly curved concave surfaces    INTERACTION DESIGN  ● No movement should take place unless it’s user-driven.  ● Keep in mind that human hands naturally move in arcs, rather than straight lines.  ● Limit the number of gestures that users are required to learn.  ● All interactions should have a distinct initiation and completion state.  ● Ensure that users can interact with objects occluded by their hands.    OPTIMISING FOR VR TRACKING  ● Include safe poses to avoid “the Midas touch” where everything is interactive.  ● Encourage users to keep their fingers splayed out.  ● Keep interactive elements in the “Goldilocks zone” between desk height and eye level.  ● Filter out implausible hands.  ● Use visual feedback to encourage users to keep their hands within the tracking zone.  ● Avoid interactions involving fingers that would be invisible to the controller.    HANDS AND BODY  ● Create or select virtual hands that are appropriate to the setting.  ● Virtual hand positions should match real-world positions as closely as possible.  ● Only render the user’s body in situations where you can expect reasonable agreement. While being disembodied is disconcerting, having multiple inconsistent bodies is usually worse.    SPACE AND PERSPECTIVE  ● Adjust the scale of the hands to match your game environment.  ● Real world cameras are likely to be misaligned with the user’s eyes. Making the placement of the virtual cameras agree with the real world cameras may result in rescaling.  ● Use 3D cinematic tricks to create and reinforce a sense of depth.  ● Objects rendered closer than 1.5 meters (within reach) may cause discomfort to some users due to the disparity between monocular lens focus and binocular aim.  ● Use the appropriate frame of reference for virtual objects and UI elements.  ● Use parallax, lighting, texture, and other cues to communicate depth and space."

janusVR,305nld,HAZARDU5,2,Tue Mar 24 22:15:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah it would. Could be problematic if the multiplayer experience needs to be consistent between various iterations of the room. I can understand that this sort of functionality could be useful to change the state of the room when the code is generated on the server based on URL parameters, however right now the best workaround is to manipulate the state of the room using JavaScript. If the state needs to be preserved between sessions for a single user the cookies functionality could be useful (e.g. opening a 'door' in the room then closing JanusVR and coming back to find it open again)."
janusVR,305nld,HAZARDU5,1 point,Tue Mar 24 23:39:19 2015 UTC,"i don't care multiplayer i want a single user experience in my webshop anyway and there is a lots of stuff server-sided that is not possible to push into javascript (and i tryed it... to much stuff for JS/Ajax). with JS alone i have to recreate a full webshop fremework and backend and a lot of stuff more so i dont have time for this and many webshop fremeworks a build similar. Stuff like user steering ""landing page"" > ""list"" > ""item details"" > ""cart/trolley"" > ""checkout"" > ""index"" is always a new page and the shops need this layout to work there is no option to avoid it (for now) exept a new reimplementation (to expensive for too small market). in Janus there are suddenly >6 rooms between the user and the exit of the side -> BAD user experience. better the user can turn around and exit the shop.  cookies are good for the the items in the cart and a notepad function the rest dont care if some thing is open or not."
janusVR,305nld,codenamesrcl,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:50:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah JanusVR is kinda not very good at the whole communicating between JavaScript and the server thing. Potentially you could try working around this by having your store use AssetWebSurfaces and placing buttons on them in order to add items to a cart (you could use a different AssetWebSurface that links to http://www.youronlinestore.com/cart/add?product_id=1234 to add product #1234 to your cart when the large 'Add to cart' button is clicked in the AssetWebSurface) You would also use a AssetWebSurface to list the items in your cart on some kind of display board in the room.  With this method you'd be separating e-commerce transactions and shopping cart management from the actual 3D experience of browsing through 3D products in VR. The 3D view would only be used for product selection, while 2D AssetWebSurfaces handle adding to cart and checkout / payment which allows the user to complete a transaction.  You'd also need to do some experimentation to ensure that typed text inside the AssetWebSurface doesn't get sent to everyone else in the room as this would be very very bad from a security perspective when you enter your credit card details into a payment page. A potential workaround for this would be to build your own multiplayer server and add functionality to disable multiplayer information being sent in specific rooms (i.e. the room with the payment counter).  Please bear in mind that you should NEVER take credit card information yourself and post it from the client to your own server. Payments should always be taken on a payment gateway page of a payment provider such as PayPal so you don't bear that liability yourself.  In short, e-commerce in JanusVR is kinda tricky right now and is probably going to require a bit of getting stuck in and coding some custom solutions yourself until additional functionality is added to the JanusVR client."

I'm not really sure if anything resembling production-level use cases should be done in janus unless it's through websurfaces (kind of like what hazardus was saying) or it's a static offering.  There's just so much that can't be done or would have to be hacked together for the time being, at least in my opinion.  Especially if you are heavily reliant on server logic and/or ajax.  These things can be handled by websurfaces, but it seems like you want this done within a 3d context."

janusVR,305nld,konchok,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:15:13 2015 UTC,"I think e-commerce in VR needs to be treated more like a mobile application than a traditional server-side page based e-commerce system like your envisioning. Again, for the best experience it would be better to place the bulk of that logic into JS for the time being.  Potentially if you're already using Shopify you could choose to provide your list of products all on a single page as AssetObjects then use JavaScript to paginate cycling through that list of provide filtering of that list using predefined product tags or categories. This would allow you to have everything all in a single room, perhaps laid out like a traditional physical store with displays of 'featured' products. For more detail users could opt to browse your catalog which would bring up the filterable list of 3D objects showing 10 or so products at a time as an overlay. Each product would have an AssetWebSurface containing a 'Buy now' button associated with it that is included in the page. You'd then apply the different AssetWebSurfaces to a button in your UI to allow the user to add the item to their cart.  Again, final checkout could be an AssetWebSurface which lists all products in your cart in a 2D format. This could be visualized by creating a kiosk at the virtual checkout (similar to when you go to pay at physical grocery stores at self-service checkouts)."
janusVR,305nld,MrM0bius,1 point,Thu Mar 26 00:24:03 2015 UTC,not if i can reload the room. and yes i have similar ideas for the layout. but like i said for easy enhancing of a existing webshop engine i can not rewrite everything (at least it is not cost-effective for an company to rewrite an engine just for VR) even the mobile shop got some page changes in it so it is not a big change anyway.   i need a solution for an existing webshop in a 3D webbrowser that can be the same features like a 2D browser so i dont need to argue why we have to redo everything with a lot of manpower for a very small market.
janusVR,305nld,MrM0bius,2,Thu Mar 26 18:31:37 2015 UTC,"That's kind of the problem with VR at the moment. If you want anything good you have to invest time and money up front with very little promise of return. But developers who are early adopters have to do this otherwise modern VR will never become mainstream.  My suggestion above would allow you to keep your existing Shopify web shop and allow you to have a VR version in the current version of JanusVR with minimal structural changes to your existing shop, as long as you're willing to code a bit of custom JavaScript for it."

janusVR,3029qd,Nukemarine,1 point,Tue Mar 24 01:21:29 2015 UTC,"Although it's too early to really give it a decent chance, the idea is about securing assets. If the HTML is delivered to Janus directly this creates a layer of security. By removing the CTRL+S option, that adds another.  Delivering the HTML securely we already learn how to do with Avatars. Those are basically mobile webrooms after all. Yet, no one can easily copy another person's avatar without some hacks with either Janus or the multiplayer server.   With that concept, it's conceivable the multiplayer server acts as an honest broker which delivers door to the player which leads to a room that the server again offers the HTML. All the object files and HTML are hosted elsewhere in a non-advertised location, however the owner gave access instructions to the server to share or #sync with other players.  Boom. Unless one hacks the cache file or the multiplayer stream to decipher the MD5 Hash (?), they're not able to CTRL+S or even see the URL of the room they're in.   This in turn adds confidence to people that'd like to display secure assets for users of Janus without excessive fear their stuff can be easily copied. Obviously it could be copied (same as assets in any game gets copied) but that takes talent the average use will not have."
janusVR,3029qd,sirkitree,2,Tue Mar 24 11:06:44 2015 UTC,"I still think it's silly to try to protect assets on the web. It's like trying to make sure people don't copy an image from a website in my mind, which is fruitless and pointless imho."
janusVR,3029qd,codenamesrcl,1 point,Wed Mar 25 01:28:45 2015 UTC,"i've been on the fence about which direction things will go with this.  I think the ctrl-s thing is a bit excessive, i'd be more apt towards a protected attribute marker so that when janus outputs the markup any protected url would be cleared out.  But i'd still get the rest of the markup, not the most browser-y of outputs, but I think it's a decent middleground.  as web developers we are used to the idea of sharing everything because if it's publicly exposed by the server then it's free to all regardless of what we say or do.  Authentication changes things a bit but not much.  Minifying and uglifying is more for performance than obfuscation. Better to share with the community without walling off and simply get attention drawn to our portfolios, build our reputation and such.  I'm all for sharing everything that I make as along as it works, i'm not into early alpha code sharing, beta sure, but not alpha.  I think the argument for protecting certain assets like high poly 3d models is valid for now because of the time put into producing such assets can be quite long and people want a protection on the cost of production at least for a time.  I think things will eventually progress towards a commission based model being the norm like with what we see with freelance web designers and agencies, but that's a whole different conversation altogether.  So the protection makes sense for now because there hasn't been a real incentive to showcase these models in full online.  People can just browse the image previews and judge if they want to buy the model being offered.  With this whole idea of a VR metaverse and virtual goods for sale however, the notion changes.  People want to sell their models and they want people to ""preview"" the whole thing in VR before purchase.  I think it'll be interesting if servers start encrypting model files and then leaving the client to decrypt through some one way scheme ( i can think of a few ways to do it, it's an interesting problem to think about in general ).  Or going the flash/node route and chunking the file and leaving the client to assemble on the other side.  Or ideally both, that'd be interesting, expensive, but interesting.  Cuz really all you need otherwise is a network monitor to figure out request traffic and reading responses.  tldr; Protection makes sense, I'm not really for it in the long term but I understand the reasons behind the desire."

The problems are not persistent, upon restart they often go away. It's probably an issue with lack of RAM or processing power.  Running on MacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2011)   OSX 10.10.2  1.8 GHz Intel Core i7  4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3  Intel HD Graphics 3000 384 MB  I turned off shaders to help the FPS a little, its usually around 30 FPS when I stand still and goes down to about 12 FPS when I move.  I think a dedicated ECO mode would be really useful. Not sure exactly how it would work but perhaps it could apply a check to every file to restrict files over a certain file size from downloading. It could turn off stereo vision (as suggested here). It could replace heavy textures with stock textures maybe? It could remove some of the functionality that slows janus down (multiplayer, draw distances, object counts, I dunno). Could involve a wireframe mode? Could involve on the fly compression?  Efforts toward implementing an ECO mode may reveal opportunities for optimisation in the normal mode.  Food for thought :)  EDIT: I think the glitched out lobby looks pretty cool.

So you'll have this problem in every non alphanumeric/symbol key (ctrl, alt, shift, caps, tab, etc etc).  The keyCode output is instead an ascii control character if memory serves which won't output properly to the console, hence your problem.

Assigning the texture via the image_id=""blah"" was my missing piece, I was trying to assign it through the mtl/dae directly.  I can write some super simple js to use the photosphere like a skybox, for when that is the easier option.  It would eliminate all the hand work needed to convert the equirectangular images to cubemaps.  Might not be ideal for a very large room though as you could potentially run into issues with max draw distance clipping (and of course you'd need to load the photosphere object and include the script).  Nice to be able to do it both ways though, depending on your needs.  Now we just need some nice 3D/360 looping video clips of static scenery, like waves or leaves blowing, and we could make some incredibly realistic backgrounds for Janus rooms.  Though I guess camera tech isn't quite there yet for 3D/360 video."

janusVR,2zw8kb,MrM0bius,1 point,Mon Mar 23 22:23:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, or you could do it with a 3d editor.  Just create the 3d scene with a little looping animation, then render out each frame as a 3d equirectangular.  Oh and check this out:  http://janusvr.thevirtualarts.com/sphere.html  I used your 3d photosphere images, plus some more I found, and did the little js to make the sphere work as a skybox (stays centered on your eye pos wherever you go).    I also did some js to make a sort of slideshow.  Just click the mouse to cycle through the images.  A lot of the images needed 3D reversed, and some I left out because I could never get acceptable convergence on all sides (like the boat).  But I ended up with 13 proper 3D 360 images that work pretty well.    Though none of these is really suited for a normal skybox because they all contain content too close to the center."

janusVR,2zug63,sirkitree,2,Sat Mar 21 21:54:56 2015 UTC,The scenevr servers grows over time too. I'll hit you guys up once I've looked into tools for solving this.
janusVR,2zug63,captainbenis,2,Sun Mar 22 05:41:25 2015 UTC,"probably the best solution for figuring out memory leaks would be to use the process resource monitor for basic figures on memory usage if you aren't already using some kind of node app monitor service.  Could also build out your own monitor api by expanding on the logging functionality with a live monitor for the admin (ie users online, their session, the server state, etc)  first place i would look is to see if the server is handling disconnects correctly, because it may be leaving disconnected users alone without removing them from the session tracker.  The second place i would look is how rooms are handled at the server and session level, as those two are rapidly expanding and contracting arrays/sets.  If not handled correctly they could certainly accumulate over time.  i rewrote the janus server using socketio and ws (two server implementations) as a test to see if people could just outright host their own servers on heroku/openshift and thus alleviate the need to depend on vrsites' server but never could get janus to connect to them, despite the fact that the web surface could connect to both implementations just fine.  Until janus gets better debugging i won't know why (ie. did i do my port of lisa's functions wrong or did i miss something else entirely?  is janus even attempting to connect to my server or is it just falling back to vrsites because it's the first server it knows?).  I kinda wanted to see if socketio would be feasible because it's server cluster handling would be handy for the future (not to mention it's graceful fallback to xhr polling if the browser doesn't support pure sockets), ws because it's a really lightweight implementation that's a bit more flexible than node's raw socket implementation which lisa's implementation uses."
janusVR,2zug63,codenamesrcl,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:26:31 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Did you open source your work?   Of note, I think anyone could host Lisa's version. In fact I know a couple are, but the client is set to connected to vrsites by default. There was also a recent change in which you can choose which server to connect to in your <Room> tag as well.  I'd be interested in seeing and possibly helping with the socket.io work you're talking about, but would also love your help on the existing server code. We could send pull requests to Lisa's project, or fork if the response isn't what we desire.  Thanks for the suggestions on the disconnects and rooms. I did notice that the rooms array was not being cleared and that could pile up pretty fast, but it's not a ton of data so I decided to look elsewhere first. I should try that out though."
janusVR,2zug63,codenamesrcl,1 point,Tue Mar 24 00:20:44 2015 UTC,"so i wouldn't have done my test if the room's server attribute update wasn't there, so yeah, tried the update with my implementation the first time around, didn't connect and Janus doesn't report why the attempt failed (or if it even attempted at all for that matter, my server side monitor didn't even report an attempt to connect).    So the socket.io implementation is in development limbo for now while I focus on other projects.  It was meant to be a weekend hack-a-thon style implementation for someone who wanted to host it on Openshift so I gave myself only 3 days to get it done before setting it aside.  I won't bother open sourcing something that doesn't at least work at baseline.  I may return to it later if Janus can get a full debug mode, which would be a big help on a lot of fronts other than the socket server implementation.  The slight problem with lisa's implementation is that it doesn't include the option to set the host ip (doable by using the longer version of the native socket server constructor) and the implementation doesn't include a pass through option to the http server (dunno what else to call it honestly) which is required by Openshift since it uses it's own routing layer on top of whatever router you use at the app level.  I'm probably wrong on this and didn't pour through the construction enough, but yeah, just up and ported to socketio.  I'm not particularly fluent with node's native socket implementation, should probably learn it sometime but not interested right now.  I suppose I could try to write on top of the existing implementation but I'd rather just use an existing socket library to expand on future options.  At the very least allow server admins to broadcast server-wide announcements to users through a websurface."

janusVR,2zuzvl,konchok,1 point,Sun Mar 22 00:57:49 2015 UTC,What's needed is a way to iterate through player position data where the players also  have the same room id in javascript. This would probably be a bit ugly.
janusVR,2zuzvl,macromarco83,1 point,Sun Mar 22 02:19:00 2015 UTC,"If you take a look at the server api, you'll notice that player position and ID can be transmitted to the client, but I don't think it does anything with cursor. I'm not sure how James is currently tracking that.  Player position (at least) I'm pretty sure you can get fairly easily within the room.update() function by looking at the player.pos, but I may be misunderstanding what you're looking for here."
janusVR,2zuzvl,sirkitree,2,Sun Mar 22 17:29:32 2015 UTC,"player.pos is only for the clients player.  I want other players positions.  As for cursor position, I can see other peoples cursors so it must be going through the server."
janusVR,2zuzvl,HAZARDU5,1 point,Sun Mar 22 17:43:51 2015 UTC,"Last time I checked the entire player avatar including position was sent to the server by the client. It seems that Session.move() is relaying the player position data from the original client to all other connected clients - I suspect James has repurposed 'position'  variable and is stuffing all the players data into it. This explains why he was able to add shared player cursors, Leap Motion support and synced JS variables without changing any of the server code.  You could try altering the server code to sync all players current positions JS variables by adding this data to the position variable in Session.move()"
janusVR,2zrylu,VeryGrumpyTiger,4,Sat Mar 21 04:06:59 2015 UTC,"In the ESC menu, make sure you have ""edit mode"" turned on. The rotation is actually the location of three points (xdir, ydir, zdir) that are all 1 meter away from the center/origin and are all 90 degrees from each other. If you know the right hand rule (thumb up, pointer out, middle pointing to your left), this makes it easier to visualize. The middle finger is xdir, the thumb is ydir and the pointer is zdir. Best bet though is just use orientation settings in Janus VR.   In your xdir '1 0 0' ydir='0 1 0' zdir='0 0 1' example, that's the default and is for facing forward. Using the Right Hand rule, turn your pointer (zdir) finger to the right. The thumb (ydir) is the same, but now your middle (xdir) finger is at old location of the pointer and the pointer is opposite side of old middle meaning it should be the negative of the old xdir value.   So you want xdir '0 0 1' ydir='0 1 0' zdir='-1 0 0' which should point your object to the right. Notice the value of xdir is what zdir used to be while zdir has a negative value of what xdir used to be? Also, ydir stayed the same."

janusVR,2zbbs7,Nukemarine,2,Tue Mar 17 10:41:52 2015 UTC,"I would use the room we use now - I like meeting new people - but very soon, the ability to start where ever you want will be important."
janusVR,2zbbs7,konchok,2,Tue Mar 17 12:28:02 2015 UTC,This misses the point.  It should be super easy to change the home room.

janusVR,2zbbs7,MrM0bius,2,Tue Mar 17 22:23:32 2015 UTC,Unfortunately this always starts you at 0 0 0 even if the room position is different from that.  It also loads onload objects relative to this incorrect position.  I should write a proper bug report for this one.  For example if you go to janus.exe http://janusvr.thevirtualarts.com/streetview.php it actually loads you in the middle of the globe!  Then you fall to your doom and reset in the proper position.

janusVR,2za92u,NXT_Aussie,5,Mon Mar 16 22:30:05 2015 UTC,"I'll agree with a caveat. If ""portals"" are turned to off, players can create portals in the room, but they're not public. Really, if a room is locked down, this should be the default as well.  Reason is I don't think we should inconvenience people's travels away from a web room. I have no problem limiting how people can interfere with the experience of others though. Locking down rooms so created objects and portals are not displayed to others can accomplish this."
janusVR,2za92u,Nukemarine,2,Tue Mar 17 01:39:27 2015 UTC,I think this is a great alternative.
janusVR,2za92u,konchok,2,Tue Mar 17 03:37:43 2015 UTC,"That is a better idea, make portals=""true/false"" mean  'are portals visible to others yes/no'  I've updated the comment at the top."
janusVR,2za92u,MrM0bius,2,Tue Mar 17 03:51:24 2015 UTC,Could you use the suppress default (or something like that) function in JanusScript to just eat the Tab key?  not sure if that would work or not.  Don't know if you even need to mess with redirecting portals to another room.  Users can always just go into their esc menu bookmarks room to open new portals.
janusVR,2za92u,codenamesrcl,2,Mon Mar 16 23:31:10 2015 UTC,"nope, key interception doesn't work because js key event handles and janus key event handles are separated"
janusVR,2za92u,MrM0bius,1 point,Tue Mar 17 00:18:16 2015 UTC,"This is from the Janus JS guide:   room.onKeyDown(event): Invoked when the user presses a key. ""event"" is an object with a property ""keyCode"" that indicates the key that was pressed (e.g. ""W"", ""A""), and a function ""preventDefault()"" that when invoked prevents the default behavior for the key press from taking place.   That preventDefault() function looks like it could fit the bill.  That being said, I don't actually know that it works as advertised."

janusVR,2za92u,MrM0bius,1 point,Wed Mar 18 00:39:57 2015 UTC,Yeah the existing scripting faq is limited and maybe a little out of date as well.  I keep hoping we'll get an overhaul of the scripting system sometime in the future and can start fresh with docs then.  I remember some murmurs of a grad assistant working on this a while back.
janusVR,2za92u,codenamesrcl,1 point,Wed Mar 18 04:10:12 2015 UTC,"yeah, that was the guy responsible for getting qt's js engine in to begin with, he's since finished with his work so it's been passed back to james  unless there's another UT student working on this now."
janusVR,2za92u,MrM0bius,2,Wed Mar 18 17:20:50 2015 UTC,"There are 2 ideas here.  One idea is to stop people spawning portals in a room, cluttering it up and generally making it untidy, by turning off 'tab' altogether on a 'per room' basis.  make portals=""true/false"" mean 'are portals visible to others yes/no'  The other separate idea is to stop people directly opening portals to a room.  Say you have a sequence of rooms, A, B, C, any portal opened by 'tab' to B or C redirects to A, so the only way to get to C is to walk through A and B.  Yes, anyone could still make a room and link a  door straight to C, but this idea is more about design than security ATM."
janusVR,2za7df,konchok,2,Mon Mar 16 22:17:14 2015 UTC,"I think I figured out what's going on here.    So a person with a much higher framerate, because they are effectively adding smaller increments, will often, but not always (depending on how the math works out), have additional update cycles after the last cycle that counts for the person with the slower framerate.  For example if your timer is set for 100 ms and your updates are 13 ms apart you'll stop adding height at 91 before the next update crosses the timer threshold. Where a person with a higher framerate might have updates that are 3 ms apart, they would stop adding height at 99 before crossing the threshold on the next update.  To fix, you'll probably need to specify the max height directly rather than relying solely on the timer.  Maybe something like adding:  else if ((ernJump.timer + 20) > ernJump.date.valueOf()){    player.pos.y == (acceleration * .001) * millSec; }  This should give a 20 ms grace period in which the jump height is set to the maximum value allowed by the timer.  Might want to make the grace period a variable so you can play with it to see what actually works best.  A 75 fps update should be around 13 ms for reference.  So 20 ms should catch at least one update consistently down to 50 fps."
janusVR,2za7df,MrM0bius,1 point,Wed Mar 18 05:16:12 2015 UTC,"On second thought, there's probably not a 1:1 between js update cycles and framerate, though both would likely be faster on a faster machine.  I'm not entirely sure about this though."
janusVR,2za7df,MrM0bius,1 point,Wed Mar 18 05:20:10 2015 UTC,I had already made the fix.  But still didn't understand why the bug effected individuals with high frame rates.  That makes a lot more sense now.
janusVR,2z8n43,konchok,3,Mon Mar 16 15:24:49 2015 UTC,"just gonna tack on another suggestion to this comprehensive list that i had before, but better to lump these things together as I agree with most of these points.   Full Debug Mode - options flag to output a full debug report on most if not all events going on in Janus.  Reason being so devs can figure out exactly what's going on when something goes wrong (ie when trying to test changes to the multiplayer server code, i can't figure out why Janus isn't attempting to connect to the new server or is failing to connect)   and some other comments   2 - Thought we had that at this point as a markup attribute, it's been a toss around suggestion for at least half a year now 3 - I actually think you could work in some cool stuff with wireframing so that you have a wireframed room that the user can immediately go in and explore, and then when the onLoad is triggered, then drop the wireframe because the actual assets and collision geometry have been rendered.  I should really create an example for this, I've been meaning to demonstrate the concept for a while now.  The problem that I see with locking out the portal during load is that the user won't know what's going on in the mean time and it's annoying to wait at the door, possibly more than looking at the loading progress.  I kinda wanna see each Object tag have it's own onLoad event handler option if it doesn't already because then you could hide each individual wireframe as it's corresponding asset/object finishes rendering. 5 - Ya, agree with this, onload trigger should be treated the same as in html, specifically when the room has fully loaded/rendered.  Additionally, there should be an onEnter/onExit event emitter. 7-8 - Generally agree, media controls in general would be good (play/pause, onStart, onPause, onEnd, onBuffer, volume, seek, time, etc) but I'm not sure if it's possible to do all of that using QtMultimedia using the system codecs.  I'm relatively confident that the play/pause, onStart, onPause, and onEnd features could be doable.  For 8 you can just disable system sounds and use your own during events.  I guess it would be nice to have those as being part of a room config, but seems like we are reaching the point where we should just have a separate config setup tag for rooms instead of continuously adding on attributes to the room tag, especially as the options grow more complex and require subtags to spec things out.  9 - I think this might be a clash with Mumble and the sound attenuation option, I will have to test this out for sure."
janusVR,2z8n43,codenamesrcl,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:40:17 2015 UTC,"It would be cool if we could see the progress of everything that's loading with KB/sec, percent, size, time remaining, etc."
janusVR,2z8n43,Wiiplay123,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:36:02 2015 UTC,"2. The mark-up can be used to disable both in really hacky ways.  You can disable flight by making the min & max value a rediculously large number.  And if you set run speed to zero you'll disable fly mode.  But these are not proper ways of disabling flight mode or teleport. 3.  An alternative would be to have control over the order that things are loaded into the room.  But if that's the case, we still need to get rid of hover mode.  (When you're hovering because Janus is afraid you'll fall through the floor. 9. Can we please move away from Mumble.  Not a small suggestion but please have a built in sound engine that takes microphone as input."
janusVR,2z8n43,codenamesrcl,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:46:04 2015 UTC,"I'm all for prioritized/queue/group based asset loading, I described a nifty way to do it some time ago but it never got picked up.  I think that even if we have this though, due to the nature of rooms, I still think we need to have some form of immediate space so that the whole no-floor-collision thing is addressed without relying on an invisible floor and the user get's at least something to observe while the main assets are loading/rendering.  It's all about main wait time and interaction in the meantime. the Mumble thing is not an easy thing i would wager, i would simply say don't use sound attenuation, it's a buggy feature to begin with in Mumble.  And honestly it ruins part of the immersion audio wise.  Do your surroundings hush while someone is talking to you, I think not (though sometimes I wish it were true).     I think for the long term a lot of things need to be replaced or better integrated.  I've said in the past that things right now are rather patchwork, they work, but it's patchwork, not something that can be relied upon in the long haul.  But a lot of those patchwork things would take a long time to replace/overhaul.  A roadmap would be useful i guess, but it depends on James if he wants to establish one and more importantly, follow it."
janusVR,2z8n43,Lewis_P,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:34:03 2015 UTC,"1 Room control over entrance portal size. - I agree, though it may cause conflicts between the size of the portal that you want to have in your room and the size the portal wants to be when you open it. What if I want a small portal to the vr bar, but the vr bar wants the portal to be massive?  2 Flying/teleportation control - I agree, more control over flight should be added, including disabling flight completely and flight speed. On a related note, maybe a gravity modifier? I think a maximum teleport distance can already be set using 'teleport_max_dist'. This disables teleporting when set to zero i think.  3 Open portal upon load completion. - This should probably be an attribute of the portal in the code for the room the portal resides rather than the room the portal links to. You can currently set whether a portal auto-loads. An attribute for 'open only when loaded' would be cool :)  ...  8 Voices. - Maybe a toggle to go between beeps and voices in the esc menu?"
janusVR,2z8n43,The_Real_Black,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:55:04 2015 UTC,"1- no because it is the designer of the current side to define the shape! and on the backway the larger door would lead into spaces without the current site want it (e.g. you have a little hallway the Portal fits into then there is the wide open gate on the way back there is a chance to fall out of the collision mesh.)    2- no! some feels more comfortable tf they can fly do not force people into a movement they dont like.  3- this is a good idea, but hard to implement if content is loaded asynchronous   4- +1  5- no there a to many problems if you are opening some rooms and all of the scripts starts running. and to interact with the player it is better to know when a user entered the room and not only loadet it.   6- nice  7- yes there is a lot of things to to.  8- k  9- yes this should be fixed"
janusVR,2z8n43,Lewis_P,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:35:37 2015 UTC,2- no! some feels more comfortable tf they can fly do not force people into a movement they dont like.   This is a decision that should be made by each site author not the platform provider (janus) in my opinion :)
janusVR,2z8n43,The_Real_Black,2,Mon Mar 16 23:39:01 2015 UTC,in my opinion it should be the users option to set the walking speed for him self and not the site creator or janus
janusVR,2z8n43,Lewis_P,2,Tue Mar 17 06:34:34 2015 UTC,"Fair point. But what if you want to make a racing game for your vr site? Or you want to make a flight simulator? Or a space sim? Or a small room where slow speed would be necessary? Allowing the site creator total control over these sorts of attributes (speed, flight etc.) are what make these things possible in janus :)  If you don't want to mess with the users speed, having the option allows you to choose not to mess with the users speed."

janusVR,2z8n43,MrM0bius,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:52:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, Maybe, No Maybe.  I see your reasoning, my reservation is that this could lead to crazy big portals being spawned in public areas. (maybe the current scheme is ok) You can already do this (basically), though a simple true false could be nice.  Just set min and max teleport to the same high value to disable.  You can either set run speed to 0 or use scripting to eat the F key (I think). Again, mixed on this, you can create waiting rooms with autoloading portals to the main room to get some of these  benefits.  What happens if a single asset or something never loads?  Then you end up with the whole room unaccessible. Any and all fixes to player freezes should be top priority, very uncomfortable in the rift.  Happens under certain conditions with some room loads, audio loads, websurface loads. I'm ok with this as is, but if there was to be a onLoad plus an onEnter event, that could be handy.  You could always just put the pieces directly in the room code, instead of having the generated by js. Cool, again, you can make this happen with js, I've done it several times for this very thing, just make it large and follow player pos, but not player rotation.  Done. Volume please please please.  plus either pan or separate vol L and vol R Meh, I know the sounds have a personal connection for James and they don't bother me.  Easy enough to change locally if you want.  Plus you can disable in rooms. I'd love see some sort of built in audio chat instead of mumble.  Maybe something webrtc based?  Maybe then it could be used for client to client data communications as well."

Considered auto_play but the same issue - false by default when used elsewhere.  Maybe another attribute name?"
janusVR,2yxvan,JamesMcCrae,2,Sun Mar 15 12:00:51 2015 UTC,auto_view?
janusVR,2yxvan,NXT_Aussie,2,Sun Mar 15 13:36:15 2015 UTC,I think that it's fine being off by default.  In most cases you do not want a webview to load until someone interacts with it.
janusVR,2yxvan,konchok,1 point,Sun Mar 15 14:30:41 2015 UTC,Something like 'halt_load'?
janusVR,2yxvan,Lewis_P,2,Sun Mar 15 22:17:45 2015 UTC,"for now you could load/pos the object that will eventually hold the websurface, bind the onclick to assign the websurface_id attr when clicked, then unbind the onclick handler.  basically 3-5 lines of code  could then also create a button to close out the websurface via removing the websurface_id...if that's even a thing, i don't know how the memory allocation works with the websurfaces, ie. is the memory deallocated if we close out all instances of a particular web surface.  I should probably research this."

Even with the Rift, this could provide some increased immersion, especially since people are generally seated at a desk and will have a limited field for 1:1 motion in their normal computer environment."

janusVR,2yshkw,konchok,2,Thu Mar 12 13:16:21 2015 UTC,Right now Ctrl+B adds the URL of the room you are in as a bookmark.  Perhaps pressing it again inside an already-bookmarked room removes it.  This would be easy to implement.
janusVR,2yshkw,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Sun Mar 15 12:13:09 2015 UTC,nice and simple
janusVR,2yshkw,NXT_Aussie,1 point,Sun Mar 15 13:34:57 2015 UTC,"it's definitely one of those legacy deals that i think should stay for at least a little while longer.  The bookmarks if anything else act as a go-to for stuff you might want to visit if you can't immediately have it in the home plaza and don't want to sift through the vrsites subreddit, so it's great for newcomers who might not know how to navigate the plaza and it's immediate sub-rooms.  My own personal bookmarks have always been kept on a local server instance (first php + sqlite based, now nodejs + nedb based) that i can edit via the web view and access via the bookmarks.  If i have a place i want to keep track of or quick access, i just copy the url to the room and go to my bookmarks/server location to add the url.  dunno if anyone else would find this implementation useful as it requires the usage of a local-side server or a personal server instance (like on openshift, heroku, w/e)"
janusVR,2yshkw,codenamesrcl,2,Thu Mar 12 13:24:25 2015 UTC,Well then at least allow for an intuitive way to remove book marks.  Editing a .txt file is not intuitive.
janusVR,2yshkw,Lewis_P,2,Thu Mar 12 14:34:30 2015 UTC,"Perhaps the bookmarks.txt file should be placed somewhere where it can be overridden upon ctrl-s, or if it could behave more like the userid.txt which gets updated when changes are made.  Could an argument be made for having control of the file name that would be used when you ctrl-s? Rather than always being an output with time and date. I dunno, it would probably cause more problems that it would resolve."
janusVR,2yshkw,codenamesrcl,1 point,Thu Mar 12 14:50:20 2015 UTC,"a while ago i think we tossed around the idea of two bookmark files for standard users, the system bookmarks and user bookmarks, dunno if that was ever implemented.  Again my propensity for self implementation makes me forget if proposals are ever officially implemented, because I'll usually go the 'fck it' route and just do my own implementation for my own needs or experimentation.  The system bookmarks would be what they are now, system recommendations.  But the user bookmarks file (bookmarks2 i think was the proposed name), would be where the user would store their own bookmarks so that it persisted through janus updates.    i agree that a better edit mode would be better for built-in personal bookmarks overall as that's a nifty featureset given the breadth of content being created and sometimes forgotten."
janusVR,2yshkw,NXT_Aussie,1 point,Thu Mar 12 16:35:20 2015 UTC,"A while a we chatted about the idea of importing ALL the bookmarks from whatever browser you use now, and displaying them as bookmarks in janus, a way of quickly giving people access to their existing stuff"

janusVR,2yshkw,MrM0bius,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:25:58 2015 UTC,"I think I'd like to see some of these updated, but not just removed outright.  There's a wide array of more interesting content from the community now that could be sampled with the default system bookmarks, giving new users a more current picture of Janus.    Also, a split layout for system and user bookmarks could be handy for clarity, whether or not they're in one or two files doesn't matter much to me.  I'd like them to see them accessible from the same room, but just differentiated by labeled rows or something.    Also as mentioned above some functions to add/remove/reorder bookmarks directly from the bookmarks page would be great."
janusVR,2yshkw,codenamesrcl,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:04:55 2015 UTC,"another benefit for separation of system and user bookmarks, system added feeds.  using some server-hosted service/aggregator, janus (or preferably a third party plugin) could request the top(n) trending rooms in the VRSites subreddit as well as other feed-based trend sources if/when we get them in the future.  then render those various feeds to different levels/floors of the bookmarks room."

janusVR,2yorg4,The_Real_Black,2,Wed Mar 11 20:59:09 2015 UTC,"Cross-site scripting:       Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in Web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject client-side script into Web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same origin policy. Cross-site scripting carried out on websites accounted for roughly 84% of all security vulnerabilities documented by Symantec as of 2007.  Their effect may range from a petty nuisance to a significant security risk, depending on the sensitivity of the data handled by the vulnerable site and the nature of any security mitigation implemented by the site's owner.

janusVR,2yorg4,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Mar 11 20:59:47 2015 UTC,"Point taken, and on a traditional browser I'd agree, but the Janus JS implementation is so heavily restricted that beyond potentially crashing the other client, I don't thing you could hurt much.  There is no access to either the filesystem or to external web assets like you have in a normal browser (even the janus websurfaces can't talk to the js), so you could still only manipulate assets already loaded and specified by the room code, and only while others are in the same room."
janusVR,2yorg4,codenamesrcl,1 point,Wed Mar 11 22:21:31 2015 UTC,"i think the point is that you should avoid designing around a concept that will eventually be exposed to stuff like XSS or variable injection attacks, if at all possible.  Basically if we want ajax of any kind, or socket access for that matter, we have to take stuff like this into account from the start."
janusVR,2yorg4,codenamesrcl,1 point,Thu Mar 12 13:16:02 2015 UTC,"Let me break down the request a bit then.  What would be the safe way to sync js variables between clients that are not already accounted for by room object attributes?  What if the custom variables were limited to just strings or even just integers?  Is just syncing a json string by way of a text object the better way to do this?  Why wouldn't that method be subject to the same sorts of potential exploits if people were so inclined?  Sorry for all the questions and if some of them sound stupid, I'm probably just totally missing something due to lack of experience with web security issues."
janusVR,2yorg4,The_Real_Black,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:47:55 2015 UTC,"usually what i would do is run heavy validation on both client side and server side, using the client as the first wave and the server as the final say before broadcast.  Because we need the server to be a little more generalized with it's request handling (the way it is right now is that it's just a middleman messenger with no further processing) and we aren't running customized server implementations (yet), and there's no specialized server side api for us to make use of within the scope of Janus JS (we just emit and receive), we would have to do most of the validation on the client side before passing it off to the server to broadcast to the rest of the room.    the restriction on types is a good start, as we can eliminate any values that don't abide by a simple typeof check.  Further taking out the simple stuff like hidden eval and function calls basically negates a lot of the really bad stuff that can happen on the client.  The rest boils down to how people can interact with the data.  Pure text input is probably the biggest concern, we don't have it yet but we will eventually have it, as that's where a lot of the crafty stuff can be done, eval submits.  I don't expect many people to use eval, but i would just avoid using eval expressions at all costs.  the last part is more of a minor wall, but minifying and uglifying production code is always a simple deterrent that takes like 10 seconds to do before release.  the text object is a possible way, but it exposes quite a bit of data that the user doesn't necessarily have to see in the markup.  we don't have many other ways to do things though with the restrictions being what they are.  If we could just sync a sanitized request through the socket, with Janus acting as a second layer of sanitizing the request, that would be a decent way of doing it within the current system."

janusVR,2yjpft,Lewis_P,3,Tue Mar 10 11:15:45 2015 UTC,You can kind of do this for specific objects with some js scripting already.  Set an onclick that points to a function that makes the object pos equal to the player pos + an offset value.
janusVR,2yjpft,MrM0bius,2,Tue Mar 10 12:35:07 2015 UTC,"ya, you can do this, tried it in the past, works ok but you need another key to work the un-accounted for x/z axis or do multiple drags because the mouse only covers y + x/z at a given time (at least how i did it).  Ended up not pursuing it because I wasn't satisfied with my implementation.  it would probably be better to have a 3-axis dragging tool like you do in most modeling applications.  so the onclick would just move a generic translation tool to the center of the element selected, allows for resizing to extend the arms to beyond the volume of the object, then just drag using the axis arrows with the event handler just translating the related object relative to the translation tool's own movement..  i actually have a backburner thing I may want to pursue in the future to do a webgl based desktop client (like a node-webkit app or something in the browser for mobile) to do broad area design/wireframing that exports to janus/scenevr/etc.  If for any other reason than my interest in learning three.js and better node-webkit development."

janusVR,2yeaco,Nukemarine,3,Mon Mar 9 01:41:21 2015 UTC,"Regarding default rooms: Would it be possible to procedurally generate rooms based on typical signifiers found in all non-vr website code? Background colours? Meta-tags? I dunno. Perhaps that way the physical properties of default rooms could relate to the content on the website in some way. That gets around the issue of portraying a fixed aesthetic.    On the ESC webview or the room's webview there are right click options to links on webpages that tells Janus to use those links as assets (video, websurface, audio, obj, etc.). Users then can use these assets while editing the sandbox.   I really like this idea! You're in a room and you want to put a picture of Jennifer Lawrence on the wall for whatever reason. You google search Jennifer Lawrence in the ESC menu webviewer. Find the picture you want. Right click to add it to the assets of the room. Then place it on the wall."
janusVR,2yeaco,Lewis_P,4,Mon Mar 9 12:04:52 2015 UTC,Because reasons.
janusVR,2yeaco,codenamesrcl,3,Mon Mar 9 12:21:58 2015 UTC,"basically what you are describing is a generic translator....yeah, see my previous work on that.  It's possible, i've got an algorithm made up, but it's hard to do it in c++ without a DOM constructor (i did my mockups in nodejs with cheerio with reasonable success).    As a developer and designer, I think such a generic translator would benefit from user preferences/add-ons and suggestion to the algorithm, such as what assets to use in what scenario and what not.  This becomes more of a personal trip through the web rather than a group driven, but you can easily switch between global and personal translators.  As such the translator wouldn't be built into Janus, rather it would be either a service hosted on the user's machine or via a third party server that would take your url request, fetch the source markup, process it through the algorithm and your preferences, and then return janus markup for Janus to render.  Through a third party service, you could have that same unified experience if you and your group translate through the same service and also have a unique translation based on the settings the service admins set.  Just an idea XD."

janusVR,2ycsrh,CrusaderOfMan,12,Sun Mar 8 18:06:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for the kind words!  Very motivating to continue working on things.
janusVR,2y8nko,MrM0bius,2,Sat Mar 7 14:07:08 2015 UTC,I think it would make sense that the portal continues to spawn as it does now - at a standard position a meter or two out from the user.  I guess the only problem is if you're really close to the websurface it may intersect.
janusVR,2y8nko,JamesMcCrae,4,Sat Mar 7 18:22:27 2015 UTC,Could you turn the web surface into a portal? If they close the portal it becomes a websurface again.
janusVR,2y8nko,konchok,4,Sun Mar 8 17:01:21 2015 UTC,That's a spiffy idea!  I like it.
janusVR,2y8nko,FireFoxG,2,Sun Mar 8 18:31:49 2015 UTC,Rotate it 90* and set it to the side of you?
janusVR,2y8nko,Nukemarine,1 point,Sat Mar 7 21:51:39 2015 UTC,That was my first thought. That it spawns where your bookmark door would be if you press ESC. Another option could be Janus teleports you back two meters and spawns  the portal one meter in front of you.
janusVR,2y8nko,Nukemarine,1 point,Sat Mar 7 23:35:55 2015 UTC,"I think that's a reasonable way to do it (certainly from an implementation perspective), but it's probably fairly common that you'll be close to a websurface (and that the websurface may well be on a wall, causing the portal to be lost in the wall), just the nature of things.  Though users can generally work around that kind of thing by adjusting their own position.    Was just thinking if we had flexibility in the spawn position, it could make for a cleaner experience.  Either way, this would open up some additional options for using a websurface to specify the load options for a room, etc."

janusVR,2y7ef6,konchok,1 point,Sat Mar 7 18:46:49 2015 UTC,"OK - so it doesn't crash (crash meaning what it always means, the OS halts the program).  The reason it's doing this is because it calls the onclick function for all JS scripts that you bring in.  And so the issue seems to be that ""chess"" variable is only defined in one script but not the other.  This is a side effect of having each script run on its own (no values are shared between them, because this could lead to other problems combining scripts).  One way to solve this would be to somehow specify in the markup which AssetScript contains the function, but this seems like a pain.  I will have to come up with a better idea.  Maybe there's a way to ensure that variables/functions exist in each JS environment before calling the code."

janusVR,2y5948,konchok,3,Fri Mar 6 16:13:25 2015 UTC,"If we could just get volume and pan attributes (or just vol_L and vol_R), which are accessible in JS.  Plus maybe a pause function.  I think we could do a lot with that manually.  Could easily fake basic positional audio with some simple functions if we know the player pos, head rotation, and the object making the sound's pos, just alter pan and volume as needed.  If we had some sort of EQ filter and delay functions we could do even better."
janusVR,2y5948,MrM0bius,2,Fri Mar 6 16:31:34 2015 UTC,"just to put it one step further  if it is possible to use Qt's Audio classes, then use it as the default audio engine and have the OS audio (k-lite or other system assigned audio) being an opt-in or fallback.  then have the opt-in be part of the AssetAudio tag.  It paves the way for additional changes and options to the media handling side (like libVLC integration or some other additional plugins) while still allowing for tight markup with the use of reasonable default settings and handling.  I still like k-lite audio for playing non-web supported tracks/streams and as a general fallback if qt audio should fail in some way."

janusVR,2y4dvq,dizzket,1 point,Fri Mar 6 09:43:29 2015 UTC,Yeah I was thinking that if it was built-in functionality it could be made more authentic as shown in /u/dizzket 's video by adjusting the camera position and perspective as the user was looking through one of these portals. Not sure if this is currently achievable using JS only as it would only modify the width and height of the portal right?
janusVR,2y4dvq,konchok,1 point,Sat Mar 7 02:27:37 2015 UTC,Or rather than having a portal that does it.  If we had a variable that scales both player size and ipd proportionally that could be called in javascript.  (That's only in effect while in the room with the javascript)
janusVR,2y4dvq,MrM0bius,1 point,Fri Mar 6 16:15:54 2015 UTC,"I believe you can accomplish this with some Janus JS scripting.    Make a doorway object and note the position.  Write a function to scale to whatever size you want, have it scale the player size, head_pos, eye_pos, and eye_ipd as needed.  Then in the update function write an if statement so that if player.pos goes through the space with the door, it will run the scale function.   This reminds me, I've had intentions of doing an alice in wonderland experience in Janus since way back before it was plausible.  I actually think it could be done pretty well now, falling down the rabbit hole, eat me, drink me, trippy shaders on the rooms, could be awful nifty."

This is the functionality that I was wondering if it's currently possible.  I think as VR gets more mainstream it's only a matter of time before people are shopping in virtual stores, and it seems like a natural transition to have already established ecommerce websites become a full-fledged experience in a VR browser like Janus."
janusVR,2xxc3i,MrM0bius,2,Wed Mar 4 21:51:48 2015 UTC,"Setup 3d models of all objects, write code with server side language, write into the janus js an onclick for the 3d buy now button, that would be tied to a function to bring up a websurface with the shopping cart to complete the transaction."

A million 'buy now!' buttons on every little thing sounds awful.  Maybe you could make it a VR shopping experience that's a little more akin to it's real-world counterpart, for example you might fill a shopping basket and bring it to a counter for 'checkout'?"
janusVR,2xxc3i,The_Real_Black,2,Wed Mar 4 23:28:39 2015 UTC,yes every webshop is awful... yes amazon is awful... sorry but there is a lot of webshops around the world it is part of the internet so it will be also part of the vr-web too.  and no one will push a basket around while shopping this idea is too game'ish.
janusVR,2xxc3i,thatsnotmybike,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:35:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying there shouldn't be web-shops, just that I hope it doesn't become only or even majorly web-shops.

Not that there's anything wrong with that content model; as well advertisement and real-world sales pretty much MUST exist to fund any of the 'good content', but as a (almost literally) captive consumer, I hope that developers continue appreciate that I'm not only hanging out in Janus to go shopping.

janusVR,2xxc3i,MrM0bius,2,Wed Mar 4 20:33:38 2015 UTC,"You'd just need to break out the payment elements into websurfaces.  The actual shopping/browsing experience can be highly VRified.  You can get as crazy and complex as you want.  You'll probably want to do the main site in something dynamic on the server side like php or node or perl, and have that write the room code and the janus js files depending on variables you specify in the url, like category, item, etc.  Then use the Janus js to spice things up with movement, dynamic objects, etc.  It would be work, but I see no reason it couldn't be done."
janusVR,2xxc3i,Sgeo,1 point,Wed Mar 4 23:55:31 2015 UTC,"I would very strongly suggest not using JanusVR for ecommerce while it isn't yet 1.0. There could be an unknown amount of security issues lurking around, it's effectively a web browser that hasn't had a lot of eyeballs on it yet."
janusVR,2xxc3i,HAZARDU5,1 point,Thu Mar 5 04:40:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, until we can reliably get SSL working for communication between client and your server there could be some major issues when implementing e-commerce.

janusVR,2xx0lq,MrM0bius,1 point,Wed Mar 4 15:56:19 2015 UTC,"so here's the deal on nodejs deployment.  Most providers are going to be auto deployment based (git based for the most part)  I haven't tried instancing a multiplayer server on any of my openshift accounts, i'd suggest using Heroku but I'm not sure on the ssl situation there either.  pretty sure it's the same generic router like with how openshift does it.  I might take a stab at this on one of my openshift nodes later today."
janusVR,2xx0lq,codenamesrcl,1 point,Wed Mar 4 16:26:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your help.  I tried just removing the ssl section from the config file, but it looks like there's more to it than that.  Let me know what you find.  Upside is in my testing, I did manage to get a janus server instance running on my home windows machine.  It's mostly straightforward, except for the ssl stuff.  You need to install openssl, register a default openssl.cnf file, then open the generate_key and run those commands manually to get the server-key/server-cert files.  But once that was sorted, everything is running great locally."
janusVR,2xx0lq,codenamesrcl,1 point,Wed Mar 4 17:04:00 2015 UTC,"yeah, basically what's happening is the server code is not using Openshift's environment variables, which are important in actually starting a server instance.  Basic stuff like what host to use (since your perceived app address is just a route handle on openshift, the physical host is different, the wonders of cloud hosting).  I got the web server hooked up, i'll work on the socket stuff later. i haven't used the base net module in a long while, too used to socket.io i guess.  openshift can be a big pain to do first-setups on for node applications because of all of the security.  Stuff like there's only 4 open external ports so i have to change the config around, then make sure that it's using all of the openshift specific stuff, etc etc.  But once you get the initial setup it's pretty tame for management and deployment."
janusVR,2xx0lq,codenamesrcl,1 point,Wed Mar 4 18:04:21 2015 UTC,"so i got everything working for now except for the secure sockets, that'll be for last i guess when i get everything else i want to do done, it's easy enough though.  I'll probably rewrite the whole server deployment code so you don't have to do this yourself.  But just as an fyi on what's going on under the hood.  Essentially Openshift's routing layer exposes only a select few ports to the outside by default, the only ones that are really necessary and standard at this point.  80, 443, 8000, and 8443, for http, https, ws, and wss respectively.  The server however, is always listening on 8080, and it gets the routed request from openshift's router.  So even though your socket server will be listening on 8080, when you connect to the host via 8000 it'll know that you are trying to create a web socket.  This is done entirely out of security and non-conflict.  The server level router (basically a small handler function) would have to figure out what kind of request was made based on this port or protocol, then redirect the request to the appropriate handler (web server via http/https, socket server via ws/wss)  I'll probably rewrite the server setup for Openshift using a different socket library, i'm using ws for now since it's just deadpan easy to setup on openshift, but i may do a full port to socket.io for future expansions.  I'll probably do a dry code run when i get back from work."
janusVR,2xx0lq,codenamesrcl,1 point,Wed Mar 4 20:44:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the big help on this, and for the explanation, I really like to know the why so I'm more prepared next time I encounter similar issues.  I did ssh in and look through the logs, but I don't really have a thorough enough understanding of either node or openshift to troubleshoot properly."
janusVR,2xx0lq,codenamesrcl,1 point,Wed Mar 4 23:47:58 2015 UTC,"bad news, janus just doesn't connect to my server implementation, i don't know why exactly (janus doesn't post any kind of error for this so i'm kinda running blanks).  It connects through the browser and my test client just fine, just not in janus.  So i guess i'll just figure out a way to retool lisa's original server code to run on openshift.  It's a shame though, at least for now while i figure out what's going on.  Doesn't even seem like janus is trying to connect to the server because i don't get any kind of server side error from my logger.  So either my server is just flat out refusing connection from however janus connects to the socket server, or an error is popping up in janus and i'm not getting an error report."
janusVR,2xx0lq,HAZARDU5,1 point,Mon Mar 9 02:48:00 2015 UTC,"Boo.  Oh well.  I'd offer to help troubleshoot, but with the lack of error info, well two blind troubleshooters are probably not much more use than one.

janusVR,2xx0lq,codenamesrcl,1 point,Mon Mar 9 18:31:15 2015 UTC,"hell, i don't even know how the connection handling works, because when i change up the markup to use a different server and refresh the room, the old server connection attempt is still there  but yeah, i think what we need is just a full debug mode where janus just spits out a long log of everything that's going on in a single page load, just a wall of debug text to do a full test run.  I'll make the suggestion"
janusVR,2xx0lq,HAZARDU5,1 point,Mon Mar 9 19:06:47 2015 UTC,Hey /u/codenamesrcl did you manage to get a socket.io implementation working for the server? I'm thinking of replacing all the existing messaging handling between the client and server with socket.io over Easter and was wondering if it's actually do-able before I attempt it. ;-)
janusVR,2xx0lq,codenamesrcl,1 point,Wed Mar 25 05:41:05 2015 UTC,"I didn't actually get it to connect to janus after i ported lisa's essential functions to use socket.io.  It works fine in the browser and websurfaces, just not with Janus as a multiplayer server (i've been using the room attribute to set the server, not going through the terminal flags).  Janus doesn't report much in terms of connection status and hangups, i've been saying it'd be nice if Janus had a verbose or debug flag just so I can trace through what's going wrong with the connection attempt.  The port-over to socket.io is fairly straightforward though, took me only 2 hours to actually write the initial server portion, the rest of the 2 days or so that I gave myself was for testing and improving the non-multiplayer aspect as it became apparent that I wouldn't get any real progress on the multiplayer connection unless I rewrote everything from the beginning.  I don't see a reason why it wouldn't connect to Janus if the server implementation is done just right, I just cheated a bit by using lisa's code as a base instead of rewriting everything from scratch and just basing things off of the api documentation.  I would definitely make another attempt as it makes for a great socket server for the websurfaces if anything else."
janusVR,2xx0lq,HAZARDU5,1 point,Wed Mar 25 13:09:14 2015 UTC,I was speaking to my co-worker last night about potential reasons why only the web surfaces would be connecting and not the multiplayer component. He theorizes that it could be due to socket.io providing an HTTP encapsulated socket to clients which will work fine for connections from JavaScript which normally use HTTP.  It seems like /u/JamesMcCrae has implemented raw socket connections between the client and server for multiplayer instead of HTTP/HTTPS. I'm unable to observe the traffic between the client and server when it sit listening to the JanusVR port using Charles web proxy because Charles only observes HTTP/HTTPS traffic. The only way I've been able to observe traffic in the past is using a packet sniffer to observe the raw packets between the client and server.  Changes may need to be made to the JanusVR client to support HTTP socket connects to multiplayer servers. If this was implemented it'd give us greater flexibility to put JanusVR servers behind load balancers designed for web services (such as the ones in Amazon Web Services).
janusVR,2xx0lq,codenamesrcl,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:26:12 2015 UTC,"i thought about that as i saw that lisa's implementation doesn't use the http server to run the sockets, didn't think that would be the reason though, but i guess that makes sense in hindsight as to why it doesn't work, i thought it was done more for separation of port occupation than anything else (ie the socket server occupies a completely different port so there's no mixup as to where the request is going, instead of relying on the ws/wss protocol)    thanks for the clarification (and your co-worker too).  I thought about socket.io's nifty node cluster handling as a future thing for running off of Openshift/Heroku scaling servers, guess that would go double for AWS deployments."
janusVR,2xx0lq,HAZARDU5,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:40:37 2015 UTC,"Since the server doesn't really work correctly with SSL at the moment you could just delete the following lines in config.js:  ssl: {         port: 5567,         options: {             key: fs.readFileSync('server-key.pem'),             cert: fs.readFileSync('server-cert.pem'),         }     }  The server.js file should just skip over the ssl part when the server starts up."
janusVR,2xx0lq,codenamesrcl,1 point,Thu Mar 5 19:08:59 2015 UTC,"Right on, thanks for the suggestion.  I actually tried that very thing, but it failed with another error.  That does explain why I couldn't connect with ssl on my home pc janus server.  Codenamesrcl has informed me that there are issues with port availability and environmental variables in the openshift deployment that need to be addressed.  Mentioned he may try and rewrite the server code with socket.io and to be openshift friendly."

I think having effective ways of automatically converting non-vr rooms to vr rooms will be really important for Janus.   Just some ideas: Could it look for common file names like 'banner.png' or 'logo.png' (or whatever) to place images on the walls taken directly from the website? What about extracting colour schemes to create themed rooms based on the background images/colours of the website? Maybe something can be done with metadata? What about doorways off the main room using links based on a search for common page names on the websites (like these).  edit: Side note:  I've noticed in the past when I had deleted the <assets> code for an object but forgotten to delete it's <room> code bit, that it would cause issues in the room (not being able to click properly). What currently happens if an image/object is placed in the <room> but it's URL is not defined in <assets>? Could a room always have images on the wall, but those images would only appear if they have been found on the website and added to the <assets> list? For example you could always have 'logo' image on the wall, but that image would only appear if 'logo.png' had been found in the directory of the website and the URL added to the <asset> code for the image.  edit edit: If none of that makes sense, ignore me.

Compared to blend shapes, skeletal deformations are compact/low dimensional, and you can use kinematics to get any target pose (the constraints can come from e.g. VR-focused input devices that provide hand endpoints and so on, and you can use inverse kinematics to find a configuration for the bones and then deform the avatar accordingly)"

I'll give you my standard sketchup2room advice from months of trial and error.  Make sure every component has a description and name, and that they don't have spaces or special characters #, etc (default names often use these, it component#81).  The component description will export as the .obj name.  Also make sure all components are exploded all the way to pure geometry.  Just right click - ""edit component"", ctrl+A to select all, right click - explode and repeat until explode is no longer an option.  Also make sure that all faces you want to keep, have a material applied to them.  Faces with the default material will be discarded.  (If you have a lot of default faces you want to keep, a plugin/extension like material replacer is very helpful).  Finally, there's a powerful basic shader system built in for directional/point/spot/ambient/flicker lighting.  Follow Lisa's tutorials if you want to use it.  Otherwise, if you want to use default Janus lighting, open the output html in a text editor and remove the shader_id=""default_shader_id"" lines from the code."

janusVR,2xlvtg,konchok,1 point,Sun Mar 1 23:05:43 2015 UTC,Is there any kind of upper limit to the amount of text that can be stored in a Text element? i.e. will it handle large JSON objects encoded as strings?
janusVR,2xlvtg,HAZARDU5,1 point,Mon Mar 2 05:26:23 2015 UTC,"i guess is this to allow access to data not attached to a sync target (though I'd have to ask why)?  Just trying to understand the context for variable storage.  If that's the case then I guess JSON would be the most sensible option as long as you aren't creating bulky strings.  This is more about performance than anything else though, as you have to send the string and then the receiver has to parse that string.    I guess if Janus only syncs Janus attributes only, then you'd have no choice in the matter but to use JSON to sync library-level variables.  Honestly I haven't fiddled around with the sync stuff yet."
janusVR,2xlvtg,codenamesrcl,1 point,Mon Mar 2 14:01:24 2015 UTC,"My specific situation atm is my connect 4 board.  To make sure the variables for current column position don't get out of whack with each other when one person resets and the other doesn't.  The pieces sync back to their starting positions, but the counters for each column don't reset unless both players trigger the reset function independently.  I should try and see if you can create custom attributes for members of room.objects and if those custom attributes would sync along with the standard Janus attributes.  That would be an ideal way to do it."
janusVR,2xlvtg,codenamesrcl,1 point,Mon Mar 2 14:35:43 2015 UTC,"in this case, shouldn't one player be declared the game-host so that when the host resets (either when the host confirms game over or both sides confirm an arbitrary reset of the game) then the guest is asked to reset and the host won't start the game again until the guest confirms reset finished.  In a public setting you might have a host side and a guest side of the playing field, so there's a clear marker of who is the guest and who is the host.  In reality this doesn't matter as much but might make for an interesting play-park/arena setting.    I just imagine old guys in the park who sit down at a chess table and wait for opponents to join where the first guy is the host of the guest.  When the game is done either side can leave and whoever is left is the host, if both leave then the field is simply unclaimed.  The field waits for a future host to claim it and the wait-for-opponent process repeats.  Each field would be marked with a unique id so you can keep track of each field separately so spectators can keep track of every game going on without much trouble (other than the speed of their connection to keep up with the syncs, but that's a common problem for everybody)  it's a lot of back and forth with the sync calls between the host and guest and spectators, but it may make the game process easier to manage for a guaranteed two player game like this.  Might make action lists easier to handle as well, ie. what did player x do with their turn.  The actual sync would be short, with the game clients on either side keeping track of events as they occur since it's a guaranteed send-wait cycle between both sides.  keep in mind I don't know the limitations of how Janus does sync right now, so take my suggestion with a (hefty)cup of salt.  I'm thinking it's a lot like how basic sockets work, but maybe that's a bit optimistic."
janusVR,2xlvtg,codenamesrcl,1 point,Mon Mar 2 17:40:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a little optimistic :)  I managed to get it to work by keying off the values of an object that exists for all.  Currently when you sync objects, they appear in the other clients' rooms, and even appear to have the correct js_id's but those objects never get entered into the other player's js objects dictionary, so they can't be manipulated by js.  I'm now triggering the load game/reset game functions by changing the col values of the game box on the shelf, just using that as a state changer.  I'm sure there are other maybe better ways to do this, but right now I've got something working at least."

But if you have gotten previous versions of Janus to work which integrate the OVR SDK 0.4.x, then this itself probably isn't the issue.  Also, the past few versions I've made some changes in terms of what flags are passed to the OVR SDK for setup, so that might be the reason (e.g. ovrHmdCap_NoVSync and ovrDistortionCap_LinuxDevFullscreen which are specific to the Linux build).

The weird thing is that attribs[0] is 3 when glXChooseFBConfig() is entered even though it is set to GLX_FBCONFIG_ID just a few lines before that...  I grepped the oculus rift sdk and this should the value:  LibOVR/Src/CAPI/GL/CAPI_GLE_GL.h:        #define GLX_FBCONFIG_ID 0x8013   Is it weird that it is defined in the oculus rift sdk? In mesa it is already defined:  include/GL/glx.h:#define GLX_FBCONFIG_ID                        0x8013 include/GL/glxext.h:#define GLX_FBCONFIG_ID                   0x8013   Since I can't change the oculus rift library that you compiled in (maybe I can LD_PRELOAD it?), I did an ugly, ugly hack in mesa  diff --git a/src/glx/glxext.c b/src/glx/glxext.c index 68c359e..7891ab4 100644 --- a/src/glx/glxext.c +++ b/src/glx/glxext.c @@ -396,6 +396,9 @@ __glXInitializeVisualConfigFromTags(struct glx_config * config, int count,      for (i = 0; i < count; i += 2) {        long int tag = *bp++; +        if (tag == 3) { +                tag = GLX_FBCONFIG_ID; +        }         switch (tag) {        case GLX_RGBA:   That ""fixes"" the matching of a Visual and Janus VR creates a window now. Interesting.  That would surely be interesting to single step over...  Anyway, reading the spec it says  GLX_FBCONFIG_ID Must be followed by a valid XID that indicates the desired GLX frame buffer configuration. When a GLX_FBCONFIG_ID is specified, all attributes are ignored. The default value is GLX_DONT_CARE.   but the following value is a 0, so glXQueryDrawable() does not succeed to get the id of the window.  I still think this is related to how the initialization is done... Can you somehow call the oculus rift initialization... later? When breaking on glXQueryDrawable(), there doesn't seem to be any window yet. I believe (!) that when the window is first created, and only then the glXQueryDrawable() stuff is run it would work better...  Anyway, In 39.1 I get this segfault, but possibly only because of the hackery with a drawable that is 0...

janusVR,2x35dk,codenamesrcl,1 point,Wed Feb 25 08:08:36 2015 UTC,"it's not quite that simple since Qt multimedia relies on the OS to direct it to what codecs it can use for what formats.  When you install K-Lite and set it up (or gstreamer on linux if memory serves), you are writing to the registry that the OS can access these codecs with these rules whenever an application asks the OS to handle the processing of file X.  it's not as simple as dropping in dll files into the build.  For example I set K-Lite's rules to not use LAV in Janus and instead use ffdshow because I want working subtitle support in my theater rooms.  But when I open up a video in MPC, it uses LAV.  To integrate a codec pack, first off it probably wouldn't be k-lite but probably the vlc core (think it's still libVLC) or QtAV (another cool project), you would have to change how Janus judges media formats and how to handle them, at the worst case you'd leave it to qt-multimedia as a failsafe last-resort.  At best case you would have a rule chain for the users to set up, because maybe I want to use the MadVR renderer, or tweak the decoders, instead of using Janus' ""built in"" codecs.  Still, that's a lot of work and a lot of time spent in my mind for not a lot of benefit beyond quality of life for first setup."

janusVR,2x1gql,thatsnotmybike,1 point,Wed Feb 25 00:52:02 2015 UTC,"Cool.  I'll apologize I'm not familiar with the architecture of JanusVR, I'm a newbie to the whole VR scene :)  Best thing to do is assign a global UUID for each user and never transfer anything sensitive (maybe users can even define what's sensitive), and a one-way hashed token the user can carry around as their identifier.  That identifier should also include a salt known only to the authenticator.  When I see multiple 'authentication' servers proposed for public services I just get a little anxious about impersonation.  Would these authentication servers always refer to a central hashing authority, or would they all provide that service?  You'll get mismatches and easy hacks if anyone can be authoritative.  Also a token alone can be stolen or (eventually) guessed; it's one of the bad things about cookie-based logins.  That said it's also usually 'good enough', leaving the client security up to the end user."
janusVR,2x1gql,codenamesrcl,2,Wed Feb 25 01:18:26 2015 UTC,"when it comes to stuff like this, treat it as if you were developing any other application.  Makes the job a lot easier since it is just another web application when it (will) come to authentication and services.  I'm all for tokenizing logins, I'm also all for ssh style auth keys as a more permanent solution for each machine on a per-service level but I get the feeling most aren't XD.  I'd like to just have an SSO method so I just login once and the SSO logs me into each service I connect to it when I need it.  Keys can be refreshed every so often yada yada yada.  The issue of impersonation is always going to be a problem when dealing with service-based-anything.  It's like someone grabbing your username in a new game.  You'd have to challenge the service provider for the name with reasonable credentials.  Ask any prominent Youtuber about this kind of stuff.  I think we have to remember that Janus is a web browser, not a game, and as such should be relatively server agnostic.  Up until this point we've been server dependents but that's not the end goal.  We'd like to be able to tack on service plugins as we see fit.  Eventually social media style comm services for VR will be a thing and it would be nice to have our pick of services to use at our leisure, whether it's just a VoIP service like Mumble or a full fledged social giant like facebook to connect with our friends not only in Janus but in other WebVR and Social VR applications while using our HMD."

It could be a bit like an email address."
janusVR,2wxixh,dizzket,1 point,Tue Feb 24 00:32:05 2015 UTC,"Mmm... Not big on the idea of the single central server.  In terms of other servers getting your password, if there's going to be a password dialog, the info of the server requesting it will be clearly displayed.  Also, different servers should have the flexibility of having different kinds of accounts and so on, so having some central thing like this I'm not sure makes sense in general."
janusVR,2wxixh,dizzket,1 point,Tue Feb 24 00:48:35 2015 UTC,"Well, you'd have a choice over who you registered with, so it wouldn't be entirely centralized. It'd also make stuff like a friends list a lot more viable."

Aussie and a couple of us have been talking about this today. Authentication should really be as optional as possible, but centralization of a ""social account"" is really the more elegant way of approaching it. It would also create a market. Anyone could become the ""social network"" for your client, and provide you with services. Get on mumble when aussie and the rest of us are on, so we can all talk about it :D  Multiplayer data would still be provided by multiple servers, though."

janusVR,2wy5gq,Nukemarine,2,Tue Feb 24 03:10:54 2015 UTC,"Not a bad idea.  This is already supported partially via the MD5 hash of the URLs for pages you go to.    The missing ingredient is a way to specify that ""channel"" string - which changes the MD5 URL hashes - without actually broadcasting this to others (e.g. when making a portal with an edited URL string, anyone nearby can observe this so it's not at all private, and further it does not have global effect with all rooms you visit onward).   So the command say ""#channel blah"" would then modify how the MD5 hashes are done (appending the channel name ""blah"" to the string for each URL in some manner - simplest is to just directly append it) and then updates to the server will only then be ""listenable"" by others who are subscribed to those same URL+channel string combinations - since the server only forwards on updates to those who are subscribed to specific rooms (which as mentioned would be the combo of URL + channel name).  I don't think it would be too tricky to add this.  Edit: Also, resetting to the ""global"" channel would just be the command ""#channel"" (meaning an empty string for channel, which appended wtih a URL will just produce the same hash as the URL by itself).  Edit2: I've added notes to do this on my ""pending"" page."

janusVR,2wvi5y,JamesMcCrae,2,Mon Feb 23 16:20:41 2015 UTC,"I would just have a help page that can be accessed from the main menu through the personal webview.

The page can be styled into an efficient single-page help app as well as a reference doc that can be accessed from Janus as well as from the desktop if the personal webview is too small.  It's much easier to update such things as well when it's a standard page.  A simple Bootstrap based single-page app would be sufficient and easy to create."

If you have the disposable income and a good machine already in tow, then I guess getting a DK2 now is justified.  Otherwise wait for CV1.  And this is coming from a DK1 and a Gear VR IE owner/dev.  I skipped DK2 entirely.  As far as making web content for Janus is concerned, desktop works perfectly fine which doesn't require a rift to use.  Granted, you don't get quite the same experience while developing your spaces but you can do everything while in desktop mode and then ask a DK owner on Janus to verify VR specifics.  But yeah, it's cool that people are getting exposed to VR at the university level instead of wandering to meetups and conventions.  U of T as in Texas right?"
janusVR,2wkx7h,codenamesrcl,2,Fri Feb 20 19:58:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, and U of T as in Toronto Canada :)"

I didn't try Janus until last week, and am now addicted to building stuff in it.  I regret I didn't try it sooner.... I saw it a long time ago in its firebox state and didn't give it much thought for some reason. I guess it was because it wasn't really promoted much, and the early screenshots didn't look too exciting."

Probably a ways off before we don't need a keyboard though.  Also, not sure the MS api is the best route, but hey, I'm all for whatever works."
janusVR,2wj2qy,MrM0bius,1 point,Fri Feb 20 20:32:10 2015 UTC,I've used speech input quite a bit since I liked to use a controller. Works quite well though it can cause head aches if you're chatting in mumble while speech recognition is active. Just remember to tell it to quit listening when you're not using it.
janusVR,2wifqj,dizzket,2,Fri Feb 20 03:56:30 2015 UTC,"Basically, links are created on the right, scroll to the left and are deleted. This makes it easier to fit a lot of different links in one small space (external websites/random rooms/ etc)  If we had access to modifying portals via Javascript, this could be done, and we wouldn't have to worry about the space limitations of the front room."
janusVR,2wifqj,Lewis_P,1 point,Fri Feb 20 03:58:18 2015 UTC,I love this idea :) I'm sure there are other applications for moving portals that we just haven't thought of yet. Moving spherical portals could have some really interesting applications for example.

janusVR,2wivy2,NXT_Aussie,3,Fri Feb 20 08:22:17 2015 UTC,"just turn multiplayer off then, that would solve basically everything you've mentioned thus far.   I would say that most of these things should be delegated to a dedicated and persistent config setup, stuff like multiplayer on startup and portal sharing.  And if you need private portals then just load the portals in your bookmarks room as that's always private context."

janusVR,2wivy2,codenamesrcl,3,Fri Feb 20 14:01:06 2015 UTC,"Couldn't disagree more.  As stated by others you can easily disable multiplayer if that is your preference. Also, the Janus JS isn't really capable of implementing per room multiplayer yet (though it's getting there).  Eventually a per user block function will probably be implemented along with a friends list and such.  Remember early days, but in my opinion, multiplayer is one of the best parts of Janus atm."
janusVR,2wivy2,MrM0bius,1 point,Fri Feb 20 20:24:16 2015 UTC,"open social will always be a mixed bag without moderation factors built into the server and associated services like we all know at this point.    We still haven't seen a 30ft dick avatar yet but hey, in all due time.  It's pretty much the Second Life conundrum if you ask me.  The open social is the single most amusing and single most abusable aspect of Janus.  Friends list stuff I'm less sold on for now, I know how it would likely be done but it's up to someone to pony up a server to service that functionality depending on how deep it'll go.  And yeah, JS, really early days with a lot to consider when it comes to security and quality of life stuff for both developers and end users."
janusVR,2wivy2,codenamesrcl,1 point,Fri Feb 20 22:09:59 2015 UTC,"Friends lists are coming soon enough.  For now you can either turn off multiplayer, make your own server, ignore it, or just go into a different room.  Janus does not communicate at all with the outside world if multiplayer is off.  Also, yes the multiplayer design is definitely going to change as development continues. What we have now is mostly just a test bed for maximum capability and freedom. In the future, it will likely function on a per website basis, and/or a plugin system(akin to skype or mumble etc), Giving the user and webmaster control(For example, disney.com will heavily moderate it's own multiplayer server)"
janusVR,2wivy2,FireFoxG,1 point,Fri Feb 20 08:31:41 2015 UTC,"Interesting point of view. Personally I find the multiplayer coupled with the freedom of expression that JanusVR facilitates to be one of its major USPs.  I agree there are issues with nudity and other explicit content, I'm just not sure that removal of the multiplayer is the right solution. As others have said, if you would like a more private experience, you can turn off multiplayer for now. Again, this is probably not not the ideal solution but it works for now.   Creating private portals is not a bad idea. Perhaps holding a modifier key when creating the portal or something. Just like regular web browsers."
janusVR,2wdae5,MrM0bius,2,Wed Feb 18 23:27:27 2015 UTC,"Your work has a lot of potential, and it's one of the best practical uses of Janus I've seen so far! :D  An idea I had for wrapping around the earth was, instead of having two models of the planet laid out, you could cut one model in half, and then using javascript, place that half in the appropriate spot depending on where the player is.  Can't wait to see what you do with it."
janusVR,2wdae5,dizzket,2,Wed Feb 18 23:48:11 2015 UTC,"I changed the way I do it, so there's just one extended model that doubles the far sides about 25% on each side, just as far as you can see.  To keep the fps up, I also had to tile the collision model into 8 pieces, so it doesn't have to calculate collision for the whole earth each update. (not sure how much of that is active yet, lots of changes in my working test version, but I need to sort some things out before taking it live)."
janusVR,2wdae5,dizzket,1 point,Thu Feb 19 00:56:50 2015 UTC,"Hey /u/JamesMcCrae , if you put in portals that can link to other locations in the room, MrMobius wouldn't have to do this fancy tiling, and it'd also show portals and warp pads on the looped world :D (typing in someones name like that notifies them right?)"

janusVR,2wd5hh,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Fri Feb 20 10:05:06 2015 UTC,I would actually recommend linking to both the hosted file we recommend now and also to the main k-lite site in case people want the most up to date build or a higher build than basic.  Stuff like viewing container formats with softsubs (like most subbed anime as MKVs) is only possible right now with the Full and higher builds of K-lite.  I still have to test out the new LAV build they included in the most recent version so I can't say that rule still applies right now.  Just thought I'd put that out there in case people were doing local theater rooms or something like that.
janusVR,2wd5hh,codenamesrcl,1 point,Thu Feb 19 14:03:13 2015 UTC,"Right.  The link I added to downloads is to the ""official"" site.  The reasons I was hosting a local version (1) I know that version works (2) The ads and things on the site can lead you elsewhere"
janusVR,2wd5hh,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Fri Feb 20 10:06:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that big green button is a bloody trap.  There are 4 versions of k-lite package on the site (basic, standard, full and mega) Which version of k-lite were you hosting?"
janusVR,2wd5hh,codenamesrcl,1 point,Fri Feb 20 13:29:54 2015 UTC,"if memory serves, we were suggesting Basic which includes everything you would need to play baseline video in Janus including streamed content and the like.  For most Janus users this is 100% sufficient.  I like watching anime though, so I need Full because it includes a few extra things that allow subtitles to be rendered correctly in Janus.  LAV's subtitle renderer at the time did not render/position subtitles correctly in Janus for whatever reason.  This was last July that I made the changeover to Full to watch anime in Janus.  I don't have much hope for the new builds but I will probably test out the new LAV build this weekend just to see if I can eliminate the need for Full for my purposes."

janusVR,2wb782,dizzket,1 point,Wed Feb 18 23:50:15 2015 UTC,"Since the rooms would be children and not parents this might not be important.

janusVR,2wb782,NXT_Aussie,1 point,Thu Feb 19 03:07:50 2015 UTC,"Suggestion - Deallocate children rooms when you shut the door.  Was exploring VR Sites for new content which means opening lots of doors. Realized the rooms would not deallocate (set to 1) unless I moved into the room and then backed out. Closing the door did not deallocate.  Guess that means differentiating between a soft close (room is not being drawn but stays in memory) and a hard close (room is deallocated). There may be benefits for a soft close when you move X meters away. Likewise there could be a ""soft open"" option when one is X meters away from a door where Janus loads up the room into memory. I'm guessing something like that will create crash city it areas like VR Sites though."
janusVR,2wb782,Nukemarine,2,Thu Feb 19 03:32:40 2015 UTC,"You're quite right that closing a portal will not deallocate the room behind it, even if it's a child and the deallocate depth is set to 1.  I'll have to think about it more."

If, when you pressed F5, all elements in the room persisted until they were overwritten by new elements, and were removed if they no longer existed in the markup, the refresh would be seamless. :D It'd also make it impossible to move through walls by spamming f5 as well."

Some questions:   You mentioned a while back that you'd like to have all these things meaning both the user avatar settings and the user settings in one file. Do you think it's better having separate files like this? Are you considering an elegant method to let players edit their menu's appearance while in game?  I haven't experimented with it, but can we add additional items like a ""chair"", ""lamp"", ""sex slave"" ""personal robotic assistant"", etc.? On that point, can we edit the bookmark, avatar and web view portions of the menu at some point in the future?   Future idea:   (from Konchok) Setting a ""playermenu"" asset in Janus rooms that's set to a .txt file. Players hitting ESC see the ""playermenu"" button name. Click on it, and your ESC menu alters to the setting of the Janus room. Great for creating player huds or interfaces that's tailored to web sites. Not essential as this could be done with Javascript.  Buttons that bring up different menu layouts. Click the button and a different layout comes up. Could be useful for creating EDITING MODE, GAME MODE, VIDEO VIEWER MODE, etc. One way is have a main template settings.txt, followed by a menu01.txt, menu02.txt, etc.   Another option (selectable) would be going into the ESC menu could mean you want to be off multiplayer and in your own private room. Basically, you ""teleport"" to the ESC menu which is its own room then ESC again to go back to original room. Something like an ""on escape setting"".  As always great update. Pretty sure there'll be user menu templates that'll be shared which can be fun. Some people are more creative and efficient with their layouts."

And many times (but not all times) cause me to crash.  It used to be better.  To recreate crash, quickly move from one side of the portal to the other repeatedly in a loading intensive room (I recommend ""The VR Bar"").  Edit:  I also crash if pressing F5 in the VRbar.

People are going to understand things so much better and faster in the future learning through VR versus a textbook.

A person with no avatar created a spherical portal to a nice terrain room. I went into it. It's quite beautiful. I explore it. The trees look very moist, and the terrain is very well-optimized. The shaders on the trees make it alot better, and the relaxing music is, well, relaxing. After spending some time in this beautiful room, I look up towards the gigantic spherical portal surrounding the world, and begin flying towards it. Suddenly, Harold Lott's head appears in the portal. His eyebrows move up and down, and his eyes are glowing red. Harold Lott's head melts, and Thomas The Tank Engine appears. He smiles. The screen begins shaking, and everything is distorted. JanusVR crashes and I see a text file on my desktop. It's called ""MONEY.txt"". I open it. It says:  LODSOFEMONE   The Notepad window is fullscreen, for some reason. I close the window. What I see next sends a chill down my spine.  It's Thomas The Tank Engine's face merged with Harold Lott, with bite wounds everywhere. There is a hole in the forehead with bits of brain oozing out, and half of the face's skin is peeled off, gore sticking out. I hear a long, loud beep, my screen starts flashing rapidly, and then my computer blue screens. My computer starts to overheat, and then my computer literally melts into a pile of goo."

Deallocation strategy #1 also only auto-loads rooms once as well.  I like how when you exit a room, portals in that room close, and the thumb is shown. For example, this makes the link to the Roxy look much better when looking at it through the entrance portal, works very well with strategy #2  NOTE  It does autoload rooms, it just doesn't draw the room, even F5 doesn't make it redraw./"

Not sure if you already do this but if you are looking for ways to minimise wasted draws you could write a quick function to do view-frustum testing then for any active portals don't bother drawing them or their rooms if the portal failed the test. I know you already do scissor tests for discarding fragments but preventing the draw entirely would be an even bigger save."

janusVR,2vn41h,Lewis_P,2,Thu Feb 12 11:12:46 2015 UTC,"Better to bake in any static lighting, computing static or stationary lights per-frame is wasteful.  Naive forward lighting has to shade every fragment once per light (at a minimum it has to compute if the fragment is close enough to the light to compute the full lighting). A fragment is a screen pixel generated for an object, if multiple objects overlap then they each have their own fragment computed and whatever one was the closest to the camera will remain at the end. This is called overdraw and is a huge performance hog in forward rendering. There are a few ways to combat this:     Occlusion culling Deferred renderer ""Early Z"" via a depth pre-pass to allow for only 1 lighting computation per screen pixel at the cost of additional draws. This is nearly always a performance gain as long as the lighting isn't super simplistic. This doesn't work with translucent objects so they need to be drawn afterwards using the normal method preferably in sorted Z order so that they overdraw in the correct order."

I'm an audio guy by trade (audio software and mastering) so I would love anything that could expand our options there.  You know if we only had a volume attribute for Asset sounds, we could fake positional by having 2 audio tracks, one just left, the other right, then you could adjust the relative volume based on player position.  (you'd need to make sure you could synchronize the start times for the tracks as well)."

Mind you, there are good examples out there showing how to use JS to keep objects with you (like the twitter feed in Aussie's bar if you press O, or that room with the gun arm where you can shoot bullets, examples like those)"
janusVR,2vmawk,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Thu Feb 12 07:56:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's more for positioning 2d elements or UI in 3d space at a comfortable viewing distance in front of you. I've got some basic stuff working in my Wasteland room, but right now it's positioned in the bottom center and it rotates oddly when you look up/down.  I've checked out the Twitter example in the VR Bar - it's a good implementation but not quite what I'm after. I'm looking to create NPC dialog boxes in the tradition of RPGs when the players talk with NPCs so it'd be nice to keep the text a consistent size over the players viewport, no matter where the player is looking or what angle they turn to."
janusVR,2vmawk,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Fri Feb 13 01:02:32 2015 UTC,"It's just a bit more math.  You'll want to incorporate the player's view_dir and up_dir.  You'll also need the cross product of those two for the third vector.  Set these to the xdir, ydir, zdir (orientation) for your object so it faces you regardless of view direction.  Lastly you'll want to translate the object outward - add the player.pos + player.eye_pos + player.view_dir * distance_you_want.  Also note that if you have the object too close to the eyes, the vergence angle will be severe and it can be uncomfortable."
janusVR,2vmawk,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Fri Feb 13 01:15:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry I'm a bit of a math retard - so basically when you say ""cross product of those two"" vectors you mean:  1) multiply player.view_dir with player.up_dir i.e. scalarMultiply(player.view_dir,player.up_dir)  2) set the resulting vector to the object.fwd property of the Image object so it always faces the player  3) perform a translation along the z axis of the object using object.translateZ(player.pos.z + player.eye_pos.z + player.view_dir.z * distance_you_want)  Not entirely sure about #3 - I think I'm missing something there...  If we could get access to sub-objects in a group via JS we could set the positioning up in HTML and then just move the entire group to face the player instead of manually positioning each one ;-)"
janusVR,2vmawk,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Fri Feb 13 01:42:57 2015 UTC,"No you want to use cross product.  From the JS docs:  - ""cross(v1, v2)"": returns the cross product of v1 and v2.   And no, don't use the object.fwd property.  Use xdir, ydir, zdir.  You are defining the 3 basis directions for the shape (the zdir is the direction pointing ""forward"", the ydir is the direction pointing ""up"" and the xdir is the direction pointing ""right"").  You want to use cross product because it gives you a third vector orthogonal to the two you pass in.  You may also need to normalize this vector."
janusVR,2vm47t,konchok,1 point,Thu Feb 12 03:29:25 2015 UTC,"you could pass an identifier value to the onclick handler function which might pass the js_id or some other internal id to identify what js object is passed.  I haven't tested if we already have an event object passed to click handlers or not, that would save the trouble of passing in the id directly into the onclick attribute of the tag.  but yeah, for now the ye-olde way should work fairly well for markup-defined elements.  <AssetObject id=""pawn"" src=""http://eternul.com/assets/objects/pawn/pawn.dae""/>  <Object id=""pawn"" js_id=""pawnb1"" onclick=""handlePieceClick('pawnb1')"" />  function handlePieceClick(id){     //do stuff }"

While you can use integers strings as property names in the array format room.objects[jsidattrwhatever], which makes sense if you treat it as a hash, you can't use them in the object dot format (alla room.objects.jsidattrwhatever).  So there's a major disadvantage right there with code flexibility.    I would go with what james suggested and use a proper string prefix and then attach the numeric id at the end.  then just pass the straight id around and resolve the actual js id at the event handler.  using a prefix would then allow you some additional js_id flexibility as you can identify the object's library affinity through it's name prefix.  This will be important when you start to use multiple interaction libraries in the future.  Straight numerical id's become unwieldy when you start to mess around with multiple libraries at once."

janusVR,2vhycz,macromarco83,3,Wed Feb 11 03:44:17 2015 UTC,"Hmm.  Problem here is that a bunch of draw calls are made for each Object instance.  So it's not just about total number of triangles in the room.  I have a feeling if you were to batch/combine a lot of these together in modelling software and export as one giant OBJ (or whatever), the framerate would improve.  To test this, konchok was playing with cubes with JS and made 2000 Objects.  Edit: Just tested and yeah, framerate hit.  I get 50 FPS with DK2 on when there's thousands of objects, just used this experiment room:  http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~mccrae/projects/firebox/img/janusvr_r35_0_multiscript.jpg  One solution to speed things up would be for Janus to somehow batch all this geometry together, however, people will often expect to be able to move this and one and that one after the fact, or change other properties like colour and so on, which would require regeneration of the batching.  So it's a tough issue - you'd need some flag or something to say ""this Object's properties won't change, so batch it"".  That property could be the locked attribute for example, but still there might be people who want to modify the properties of locked Objects via JS, so... hmm...  The short term fix is to put all those instances together in your modelling software and export it out as one big OBJ.  Or even, for example, tile it 3x3 - which will yield roughly a 9x improvement in performance."
janusVR,2vhycz,JamesMcCrae,2,Wed Feb 11 05:02:05 2015 UTC,"Hm, that might work. Batching, are you talking about the grouping a la the same thing done with your lobby clocks ?  How about some form of object complexity reduction when outside a certain distance?"
janusVR,2vhycz,JamesMcCrae,2,Wed Feb 11 05:13:47 2015 UTC,"No, I am not talking about tag grouping in the HTML file.  I am talking about grouping in an OBJ geometry (think Maya or Blender) sense.

I've been playing around with making photographs in to 3D scenes over the past couple of weeks and I've had an idea stirring around in my head that I wanted to air. I'm sure I'm not the first to think of it :)  360 photospheres are really cool. It would be even cooler to be able to dynamically project the imagery of the photosphere on to any asset within the photosphere. I tried to draw what I mean... not easy. So I'll just rely on a couple of google images to portray what I mean.  Similar to this  and this  and this  If this is achievable the potential is pretty far reaching; the environments of 360 video concerts could be built so that you can walk around the stage. You could stand on the correctly textured floor plane in a 360 photosphere. The buildings in 360 photographs could be physical objects that you can walk around (obviously only faces visible from the centre point of the sphere would be textured correctly).  As with all of my silly ideas, this may not be something necessary for the core client, but a future extension or something."

Paracosm uses a render farm for doing just static construction (high detail though, so there's that factor), don't know if we are going to have that kind of power available to use that soon.    But honestly the 360 photosphere won't be needed at that point so kind of defeats the purposes of the projected texture idea.  We'd just have real scale constructions from scans."
janusVR,2vf5u9,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Tue Feb 10 15:56:04 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, hadn't considered using depth data. I was thinking a more manual process of dropping in primitives at the approximate locations and scales, then having the photosphere automatically project the texture on to it (by ray tracing(?) maybe, I don't know). It wouldn't be anywhere near as precise or impressive as integrating depth data with image data. But the effect might still be impressive (particularly for floor planes, buildings and other objects in photospheres that could be replicated with primitives).  edit: Thinking about it. It is probably asking too much of JanusVR (a web browser) to implement features more suited to 3D modelling software. But meh, no harm in putting ideas out there :)"
janusVR,2vf5u9,Huntereb,3,Tue Feb 10 16:38:57 2015 UTC,"So this idea of projection of texture - this is why UV texture coordinates exist.   You could imagine having some geometry, and some input texture.  Creating a UV map for the geometry (where points on the surface of the geometry ""look up"" points on the input texture), such that the texture appears to follow this spherical projection, just needs to be done.  Now if you had geometry that was moving around over time, you'd have an issue using the above.  But, you could do this via a GLSL fragment shader (you would use the normalized vector from the sphere centre to the point on the surface to derive a UV coordinate (e.g. a theta and phi in spherical coordinates, and perform texture lookup based on that vector (using the theta and phi as the x and y on the 2D input texture)).  Doing this, you could move either the sphere centre or the geometry (the motion is relative) and it would update accordingly.  Even cooler, if you had a depth map in addition to the texture, which both varied with time, you could use a combination of vertex and fragment shader.  The vertex shader would extrude out vertices of a densely sampled sphere based on the depth value (so large depth values cause vertices of this ""spiky ball"" to shoot out farther).  Of course this would only look right from a viewpoint at the sphere's center."
janusVR,2vf5u9,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Wed Feb 11 01:37:22 2015 UTC,"Sounds awesome, but I'm curious how such a thing would effect framerate. If it's actual ""projection"", I could see a bit of a performance hit."

janusVR,2ve8yl,konchok,1 point,Tue Feb 10 23:08:49 2015 UTC,"You know.  I was thinking about this, and I'm not sure this is a bug.    When I worked on this Janus code it was the intention that in edit mode, you wouldn't have the JS events fire.  Using Janus's builtin editing mode to move the pieces is an easy way to do things, but it's not the best or most intuitive way I think.  I think the best way to do this, is to use the standard non-editing mode click events.  So for instance, a normal click on an object ""selects"" the object (achieved via Object's onClick function).  Then, you have a JS variable that tracks the js_id of that last clicked on object.  Then, during the following mouse movement update (e.g. in the onMouseMove function or following onClick function), you write JS to position the chess piece where the cursor_pos is.  That way, the user can intuitively can click/drag the pieces to move them around - rather than having to fiddle with enable edit mode and pressing QWEASD and all this business.  And you can still use JS to constrain the possible positions that the pieces can go to - e.g. constrain them to lie on a plane, constrain them to never leave a box/cube (I'd leave room to drag pieces on/off the board as they are taken/promoted), and so on...  For even more improvements to usability, you can colour the selected piece (so they know what piece will move the next time they click)."
janusVR,2ve8yl,konchok,1 point,Wed Feb 11 02:00:45 2015 UTC,"This project started before the sync update.  So, for maximum re-useability I am still using the classic syncing vs. the newer sync commands.  And while I may just end up rewriting the js to work in a more intuitive way, I still feel that this should be considered a bug.   I don't understand the advantages to having JS events not fire while editing. Is there a problem that could occur if I as a room owner could detect with JS if someone is in edit mode?  In this example it's a chess board, but for the more general example.  What if I want people to make updates in a defined area, but not outside of that area.  Without being able to use js while they're in edit mode, I have to do updates every frame to see whether or not they've made changes.  vs using the obvious check of whether or not they clicked the mouse, which is a requirement to get into and out of edit mode."

I was trying to tame the black magic that is multiple layers of partial transparency in Janus.  Depending on the order the layers decide to load you get different results with various objects behind the transparency being occluded.  I've used JS to reorder the layers depending on player position, and it works great when the layers decide to load in the order of the room code, but that doesn't really happen very often.  So I was trying to generate the objects in JS to have a little more control over when they load, but they require cull set to none so you can see them from both sides, so no dice there.  I will return to putting them in the room code, layer order be damned and I'll just deal with the occlusion until we can either access cull_face from js or we have a way to specify a particular load order.

Using a cubmap rather than side-by-side, over-under, or alternate-frame rectangular/spherical maps for displaying it. Parallax wouldn't be an issue since it's normally meant for a stationary viewer. It would also have the advantage that you only need to decode video frames for the faces that are in view, possibly allowing for performance savings at the same video quality or IQ increases at the same performance.   If you wanted the viewer to have some positional movement you'd likely have to use a grid of cubemaps and interpolate them to find the pixels that are the current best-fit for each eye similar to how GI is done. /wildSpeculation"

I'm guessing they are sever rendering the equi slice method, maybe a slice per gpu on a massive render farm or something, combining the slices into the 3d equi maps on server, and porting over a full 360 3d equi map.  The potential here is massive, since all the GPU stuff for mobile could be outsourced.

As for if a room could make you ""freeze"".  I've made rooms that have caused Janus to crash.  Janus is still really new, there are many things that cause Janus to crash.  Saying ""I want Janus to be secure, do it now!""  is not a reasonable request.  If you have a specific case within Janus that you feel is not secure then feel free to bring it up.  P.S. as for #sync, anyone can send out the command which will cause everyone to sync to them.  It takes absolutely no consideration as to whether or not you are the oldest."

Stability is a whole different issue but that's not the in the same conversation as security.  The whole #sync thing belongs in this conversation as stability and user experience, i wouldn't put this in security just because of the nature of what is synced and its affect on the source, which is non existent.  What will have to be secure are the applications/addons/plugins/whathaveyou created to provide Janus user with additional services.  I agree that security should be on the list of considerations when listing design specs and roadmaps but I doubt that James could do all of this alone and still pump out features like he is."

janusVR,2us5wh,MrM0bius,2,Wed Feb 4 18:56:08 2015 UTC,"i said before (and on many other occasions in the past) that the way janus treats markup is as raw XML.  Since the ampersand is a xml reserved character, you have to escape it, and double escape if memory serves.  therefore you have to xml encode everything you pass as a link or markup.   I did this in my php implementation of the file browser (dunno if you saw that or not way back when), let me dig up the encoding process i did for that.  but yeah, the ampersand is an annoyance, not a huge deal though if you just pass it through an encoder before serving.    edit: my work computer is ass and can't run janus well, i'll run the code and a sample by you when i get back.  try the double encode (&amp;amp;) because if i remember way back when, like last april or w/e, when i was doing c++ translators for janus, you wanted to have a double encode so that the first decode pass which constructs the xml tree to traverse would read the first amp escape as the amp to escape the real amp on the markup so that in the presented markup the real amp is displayed correctly.  Call it a double pass if you will because the tree assembly takes one whole pass on it's own.  second note: i had to triple encode the example just for it to display correctly, that is three amps because the browser takes one of the decode passes, so after the browser's pass it is amp;amp; that you probably want to try."

janusVR,2uq6u1,HAZARDU5,1 point,Wed Feb 4 09:00:28 2015 UTC,"Does this fix apply to sounds triggered via JS as well? In my wasteland room at http://www.uxvirtual.com/wasteland/ I can currently play the user a wind blowing sound loop the moment they open the portal to the room as I'm doing this as a one-time event once during the room.onUpdate() event. It's kind of a neat effect for the user, as soon as they open the portal they're greeted with the audio atmosphere of the room.  My only gripe is that the JavaScript still runs and audio still plays when the portal is closed. You have to delete the portal in edit mode to actually make the JS stop, although even then the audio still plays. It'd be great if all sounds (including those triggered via JS) were stopped when the player closes the portal."
janusVR,2uq6u1,konchok,2,Wed Feb 4 09:08:49 2015 UTC,I've tightened up a great deal how things work.  Music only plays on trigger on room entry.  I'm no longer playing JS when you leave the room (it's resource intensive and framerate is king).

janusVR,2uq6u1,Nukemarine,2,Wed Feb 4 11:18:49 2015 UTC,"Ok, played with this some.  It's super neat as a user, but also frustrating as a room creator. I would propose that you make this a room code option for links rather than a user option in the esc menu.  That way people can use it when they design around the functionality, and it won't just break things.  Pros:  Looks really cool, can enter portal from all sides! (love this), flexibility in determining where in the room you enter (sort of), better view of room before you enter  Cons: Entering (and exiting) anywhere in the room, even very far from portal, can be disorienting, and can break room interactions since the player can spawn anywhere. Sometimes you can be standing directly in the middle of the portal, but since your head position is not inside the bounds you don't actually go through without making a diving motion with your head. maybe could be triggered by player position instead of head position.  Neat feature though.  If you could map the entrance position/angle to the corresponding sphere in the other room, instead of to the room bounds as a whole, I think it would be more useful (plus again I beg, code option, not user option :0 )."

Then just make the photosphere large enough that it will always encompass the contents of the room, but not so large that you run into problems with the max draw distance.  Basically just put this in your room.update function and you should be set:  room.objects[jsidofphotosphere].pos = player.pos;  (this function assumes that the origin of the photosphere is in the center, which it typically is)  Check this room (and it'sscript) for an example:  http://janusvr.thevirtualarts.com/roxytest.html"

It also helps to know if you intend to use a rift or not as that makes a difference in expectations.  good benchmark would be if you can run other standard made-for-vr demos at a solid 60fps, you can probably run a ""standard"" janus room.  for reference, before i built my new rig i was running a   Phenom II X4 965, 3ghz (undervolted) and a GTX 560 TI 448, overclocked a bit  and i was getting 60fps on desktop in a standard room, about 45 in rift mode for the same standard tests.  things have gotten a bit more complex since i had that rig, and optimizations for nvidia gpus have been done as well by James since then, so i would say that a decent i3 (sandy bridge or later) and a gtx 670 would be a fair baseline for a standard room in rift mode.  amd equivalents would be something from the past 3 years and a 6870 maybe, i'd have to get those who have AMD based rigs to chime in here for more proper opinions on that front."

janusVR,2uic7r,Lewis_P,3,Mon Feb 2 12:01:15 2015 UTC,"Transparency, as far as real-time graphics goes, tends to be something tough to deal with...  If you compute the ordering in depth, you can render this way.  The strategy in Janus is to render non-transparent objects and then render objects with transparent textures at the end.  Even still, there are edge cases with portals and rendering through them and things like this where it doesn't work in all cases.  And even if you have per-object transparency sorting, geometry can go in front of and behind each other in various ways.  I tried some code I thought GL supported for handling this, but it turns out it's not OS portable and only worked on the Linux build, like enabling:  glEnable(GL_MULTISAMPLE); glEnable(GL_SAMPLE_COVERAGE); glEnable(GL_SAMPLE_ALPHA_TO_COVERAGE);   And although this did work, there were weird sampling strategies used to make it happen (dithering)."
janusVR,2uic7r,JamesMcCrae,2,Mon Feb 2 12:45:48 2015 UTC,"I had a suspicion it was a tricky thing to implement. I figured there was some specific order to the rendering going on behind the scenes, after seeing PNGs with translucencies behaving strangely depending on where in the html they were placed. Some assets are visible through translucencies in PNGs, while others are not, depending on when the assets are loaded (from what I can tell).  I wouldn't place it on a list of 'urgent features janusVR must have', just would be a nice addition if it were possible :)"
janusVR,2uic7r,dizzket,1 point,Mon Feb 2 13:00:56 2015 UTC,"Even though it results in a lot of strange things at the moment, it'd still be nice to have the attribute. If someone wants transparency right now, they're going to do it anyways, but have to jump through quite a few more hoops (creating a transparent png).   A good use case would be using a GIF to create water movement, and then the transparency attribute to make that GIF semi-opaque, since that is impossible to do with the GIF format alone."

janusVR,2ugat3,HAZARDU5,1 point,Mon Feb 2 07:31:16 2015 UTC,"Just wondering how the JS files are loaded in under the hood? Do they load asynchronously like the other assets and if so, is the javascript only executed once all the JS assets have finished loading?"
janusVR,2ugat3,HAZARDU5,1 point,Mon Feb 2 08:49:08 2015 UTC,"They will both load and call their respective functions (onLoad, onUpload and so on) asynchronously.  For instance, if one script fails to the load, the other will continue to work as usual.  Mmm, I should actually be more clear.  Because there is definitely some amount of synchronizing happening (when the functions are evaluated for each AssetScript).  So Janus has a main update loop.  During this time the JS files are requested if that has not yet happened.  As they JS files are received via HTTP, Janus creates a JS engine/environment for each to run them with (as an event when the HTTP data is received).  This ordering is the ""asynchronous part"", since different JS data can be loaded at any time.  Now back to the main update loop, each time Janus updates, it iterates through all AssetScripts checking if the HTTP data has come through and the engine is set up.  For those that are loaded, it runs the appropriate script function.  (This bit I would say is ""synchronous"" in the sense that, once all JS scripts are loaded, they will have their functions evaluated in a specific order).  So it should be clear that there is no guarantee that the onLoad/onUpdate functions work in any particular order.  The order is highly dependent upon when those HTTP requests for data come through."
janusVR,2ugat3,HAZARDU5,1 point,Mon Feb 2 09:20:19 2015 UTC,"So I think you're saying here is that the JS files run in their own sandbox and we can't access variables between JS files? Or will it let us define a custom library class ""JanusTools"" in one JS file and then access ""JanusTools"" in another JS file called ""main.js""?  It'd be great if we could get the latter working and some kind of room event when all the JS files have finished loading. Otherwise we'll need to wait in the onUpdate function in our main.js for all our dependencies to load before executing the rest of the room code that has dependencies in other JS files..."
janusVR,2ugat3,HAZARDU5,1 point,Mon Feb 2 09:34:00 2015 UTC,"Right, so things declared in one JS file will not be seen in other ones - except for Janus specific stuff like the room Object, its objects, the player Object, and so on (these are read/writeable in all JS files).  For example, if you declare a global var in one JS file, it won't be accessible in another (each JS script for the room runs in a separate environment)."
janusVR,2ugat3,dizzket,1 point,Mon Feb 2 10:00:06 2015 UTC,Ah righto. To work around this could we add a reference to our libraries in JS onto the room object? i.e. room.janusTools = JanusTools then  access room.janusTools in another JS file?  Or are custom defined properties on the room object only available in each JS environment?

janusVR,2tyu7s,Redsolace,3,Wed Jan 28 15:02:50 2015 UTC,"I've heard a rumour that JanusVR is limitless :) Though in reality it's probably most limited by people's hardware and internet connections.  The rooms in JanusVR are governed by specific html present on websites. JanusVR can open and view any website (hit TAB). Websites where the necessary code is present generate 3D environments, any other site appears as websurfaces. Think of JanusVR as a web browser. The client does not inherently contain the content necessary for all of the rooms you see in Janus, it downloads the content when you enter a portal based on the html present on the site, just like a regular 2D browser. Content for sites you frequent is stored in cache so that the content does not need to be downloaded every time, again similar to 2D browsers.   As in if someone makes something extremely buggy in a janus hub, it won't bother anyone unless they choose to open the door?Or could it put the Janus hub offline if it were bad enough?   A lot of people are experimenting with JS, heavy assets etc, which can cause crashes. Typically you will only experience these crashes if you are the one opening the portal. Someone else placing and opening a portal for themselves that causes them to crash should not cause you to crash. I don't think it's possible to make a room so bad that placing a portal to it in the lobby could kill the lobby. It would be like posting a URL on reddit that takes you to such a buggy website, that it kills reddit somehow. It would be an interesting experiment to see whether it's possible, but I'm not sure it works like that (I'm no programmer myself). Perhaps it would be possible to exploit this bug to do it, I dunno.  Sign up on VRsites.com, smash a room together and see how you get on. You can easily have a half decent room built in a single evening, even with zero programming experience :) There is a nice big manual here.   edit: I'm no expert, just a fan. This is just my perception of how JanusVR works. Could be a completely different story behind the scenes :)"
janusVR,2tyu7s,Lewis_P,2,Wed Jan 28 15:41:39 2015 UTC,"i can think up of a lot of ""limitations"" but most are more or less temporary or require a lot of work to fix but are definitely doable.  Lot of work arounds to most of these limitations however so I'm not too concerned about it.  no ajax/lazyloading, limited to a single js file per room (not a huge deal if you are using a build system), no interop between 2d and 3d browsing, playback is limited by the codecs you use (like enabling subtitles in mkv's and other container formats is only doable right now through a very particular codec path, not huge but still a limitation of setup).  JS is still early days, working which is cool, but still early days.  Ton of other things like lack of custom translator fallbacks (which you can do using a middleman-esque server but not the ideal, works rather nicely though)  but like i said, most limitations are not hard limitations, just a limitation at present and there are more than enough workarounds or quick-hacks to get things to work the way you want within expectations."

Although that does mean that currently Janus is limited by whatever html's limits are.   But based on what I've seen so far i'm pretty excited. I've yet to see anything really extensive besides Usagi, and that does have a lot of simple models and empty space. So maybe extremely large or heavy amounts of detail turn things sluggish and that's why im not seeing it.  There was one room I entered that took forever to load and seemed to contain HD textures. I wouldn't mind waiting if it was something awesome that I plan to keep loaded for awhile. But people are creative, I think even with simple models we'll see some pretty amazing content.   I'm so happy with what I've seen so far, watching reviews within Janus has actually been an enlightening experience, I actually forgot that I was doing something that is normally done easily through a browsing session.

janusVR,2tpd3c,HAZARDU5,1 point,Mon Jan 26 08:34:40 2015 UTC,"Been thinking about this more in the context of shared state for objects in the room and I guess we'll have to be careful not to set the 'sync' property to true for any object that automatically animates when the room is loaded i.e an automated elevator that moves up/down on room load.  As a workaround would be neat to design a room where there is a puzzle that requires 2 players to hit switches in the room. When the switches are activated they will turn green (have their col property set to Vector(0,1,0) ). The JS will be watching for each of these to turn green and will set the 'sync' property of the switch to 'true' so it's green state is transmitted to all other connected clients. These will be additional JS on each client watching for BOTH switches to turn green which will trigger an elevator platform to activate for the current user. As this should happen at the same time the triggered elevator movement should also happen at the same time for all connected users.  Another use for this would be to use the 'sync' property on a text object located in a remote section of the room, use JSON.stringify() on a custom JS only object then JSON.parse() it when each client detects changes to the object. This way all clients can share JS variables and objects that don't belong to any JanusVR objects. A real world example of this would be to store a global 'score' variable inside this text field and share it with all clients. This would enable competitive multiplayer games with shared scoring in rooms.  In the context of bots, a new JanusVR bot could be written in node.js to act as an intermediary to pass content to and from a web server to enable us to save high scores to a permanent leaderboard in a MySQL database. All the bot would need to do is listen for any object syncs from clients.  Of course right now all this is very exploitable as all it takes to cheat and win is to modify the JavaScript on your client, but that's pretty much the same scenario as any regular web browser so steps would have to be taken on the server side to validate scores."
janusVR,2tpd3c,HAZARDU5,2,Mon Jan 26 09:24:50 2015 UTC,"Yep, setting sync on load would be a bad idea.  Generally you want it when other ""control"" events happen.  Also, things aren't final with that - just experimenting to see what works :)"

No longer need to jiggle every piece of one of my portraits of Shurui just to show people :)  So if a bot was chilling out in the sandbox, saying '#sync' every time someone entered the room or once a minute (as long as #commands were hidden from the chatlog), would the sandbox be 'persistent'?  ps. I wouldn't even know where to begin to implement something like this, just putting the question out there :)"
janusVR,2tpd3c,HAZARDU5,2,Mon Jan 26 10:47:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if the bot will be able to transmit the JavaScript object properties if you make it say ""#sync"" unless you fully simulate the JanusVR client on the server side in node.js or find a way to run a full JanusVR client in a Windows or Linux VPS ;-)"

janusVR,2tpd3c,HAZARDU5,2,Mon Jan 26 17:28:14 2015 UTC,However... if you took the time you could build a simple system into the headless bot to store and send back the object properties every X seconds or when another user enters the room to help maintain the state of the room for these new users.

Then on the next update, all that Object info/markup goes out with the next packet for others to receive (and the Object's sync booleans are set to false).

I managed to sort it by only updating the physics at a maximum of 75Hz. I'd be happy to do small changes like this myself, pull requests for small patches, etc."
janusVR,2tpd3c,HAZARDU5,1 point,Mon Jan 26 21:13:12 2015 UTC,Wouldn't it be up to the developer to only run the physics every X milliseconds by comparing Date.now() to a previously stored value in order to wait until the desired number of milliseconds had passed? It should probably use the user's system clock for this as FPS can be too variable depending on the wide range of hardware that your room is displayed on.  This is pretty much standard for most of the HTML5 games I've worked on so far as often we have to have the physics logic or secondary animations run a little slower so we don't make people's devices explode :-P
janusVR,2tpd3c,MrM0bius,1 point,Tue Jan 27 00:19:57 2015 UTC,That's exactly how I limited it but I do feel v-sync should be a toggle in the esc menu.

The advantage is control over the shadow map's resolution, the disadvantage are the artifacts/rough edges at the shadow boundary.  There are also shadow volumes, but these are dependent on the geometry casting the shadow."

So I pulled together a couple of the doodles I had done over the past couple of months and composed a short story about a penguin. Then arranged the elements in Janus. I'm really happy with the results! But would welcome any feedback :)  I have a friend who has a company that makes children's books. My plan is to approach him about the possibility of me remastering his books for a VR environment. This room will serve as a proof of concept that I'll eventually try and show him at some point.  Is there a method for setting up Janus so that the executable loads directly on to a certain website? Just so when I do get a chance to show him, it will be as straight forward as possible.  So far I have not introduced any animation. GIFS and rotating elements will probably be the next ideas I explore, just because I know I can achieve those :)"
janusVR,2tj6ix,codenamesrcl,2,Sat Jan 24 18:21:11 2015 UTC,cool to see that you are moving forward with the concept  i forget if we still have the capability to do janus protocol links (janus://whateverthelinkis)  but that would be my top method if it's still a core function.
janusVR,2tj6ix,qster123,2,Sat Jan 24 23:47:58 2015 UTC,janus:// links broke a while back
janusVR,2tj6ix,codenamesrcl,2,Sat Jan 24 23:58:48 2015 UTC,i guess the alternative would be to use a launch argument and then make that into a shortcut/shell script  that'd be neat to use for instant demos
janusVR,2tj6ix,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Sun Jan 25 04:15:09 2015 UTC,"This is really awesome and we were discussing it today.  I thought about doing a similar arrangement where you navigate this way by continuously turning right, but each time you go through a portal you'd go to a new ""page"" of the book.  So you could spiral inward indefinitely.  (In this analogy, it's like the central axis is the book spine :) )"
janusVR,2tj6ix,sirkitree,1 point,Sat Jan 31 09:36:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks :)  it definitely makes sense to split the pages with portals. That would allow for each page to have associated audio. I'll keep experimenting with layouts and methods. I really want to add gifs with transparency to add a little more life to it. I've noticed that when a png with transparency has a part of the image that reaches an edge, artifacts appear on the opposite edge. Don't know if anything can be done about that. It's not a massive deal, just means that the imagery must not meet the edge if you want a clean border. You can see examples in my other room full of doodles."
janusVR,2tj6ix,sirkitree,2,Sat Jan 31 10:20:58 2015 UTC,"Great idea. I had a similar one a while back about creating popup books in VR. Just imagine a popup book opening and you can walk around, then turn the page and a whole new world opens up for you to walk around in."
janusVR,2tj6ix,qster123,1 point,Sat Jan 24 19:07:44 2015 UTC,"Perhaps the next evolution of my little experiments will be to create a scene that you walk inside of, rather than view from one angle. It could have a foot path running through the scene with content on both sides of the path. Might convey more of a sense of narrative. I have a couple of ideas for short stories that might work in that format."

janusVR,2tebcs,Devlin1991,2,Fri Jan 23 12:22:48 2015 UTC,"On another note, I know everyone's system clock is a bit different (by seconds or even minutes), but considered having Janus connect to one of those time-reporting servers, so that there would be a global time for everyone in Janus that was (roughly, and I mean within tens/hundreds of msec or however good I can get it) synced."
janusVR,2tebcs,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Fri Jan 23 20:03:38 2015 UTC,"Neat.  Not sure what your timeframe is but if there are any reasonable improvements I can make to the JS component, I'll try to do so."

janusVR,2tebcs,__AM,1 point,Fri Jan 23 20:24:26 2015 UTC,"Brainstormed some ideas tonight, a few JS additions that would help a lot are:    Ability for the JS to alter an object and have it sync as if it was the player manually altering the same object with edit mode. This could be a function separate from the default position set so that it doesn't cause fighting between multiple players scripts that aren't set up for this. When multiple players are in a room I'd use some sort of ""master player"" flag to limit this functionality to a single player who uses it to sync the positions of objects for new players (see other request below) who enter a game already in progress. If the master leaves it would pass onto the next oldest player until the room is empty. List of the other players info in the room. Used to control things like view-aimed flashlights, HP bars above players, etc. This would also let us check for ""new players"" and if found a script could touch each dynamic object once to network sync it for them. I plan to have gameplay involving ""flip/move"" switches similar to how the chess board works by the player moving the small version triggering the the JS to move the big version."
janusVR,2tebcs,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Sat Jan 24 00:48:52 2015 UTC,"Hmm.     #1 I think could be achieved in a simple and elegant way by just adding a boolean ""sync"" to all objects that represents a state of ""send my info to others"", which would be read/writeable via Janus and the JS engine.  So in the JS you'd set this to true, and on the next frame update in Janus it would send out the Object data as an edit operation. Think I might work on this tomorrow - plans tonight :)  (In fact, if I did this, I'd rewrite the way the existing collab editing operations work to use this boolean, so it all works via the same code .  A global ""sync"" operation - a much-asked-for feature - then merely consists of iterating through and setting the ""sync"" booleans for each Object in the room to true, and then all that info will go out with the next packet or some other means of scheduling to keep packet size bounded - e.g. 5 Object syncs per packet.) #2 Also doable.  What would the ideal data structure be for this?  An unordered list?  Or something like we're doing with objects - a map/hash where the id is used as index/key?  Or do you have something else in mind?  As people come and leave the room, what should ideally happen?  (On this note, maybe out of the scope for the game jam but for extensibility into the future, beyond the Janus attribute builtins for players (e.g. pos, dir, etc.) it would be great if the JS could tie additional properties to players dynamically (or on a per-room basis), and even send/share these custom properties to others.)"
janusVR,2tebcs,__AM,1 point,Sat Jan 24 01:36:21 2015 UTC,"A hash would be best, I think, then you have O(1) instead of O(n), plus ease of use. When people enter/exit, fire off events that communicate their ids and what's happened. Also, yes, that is a very good idea."
janusVR,2tebcs,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Sat Jan 24 01:50:01 2015 UTC,"RE:#2 map is probably best for the O(1) access, perhaps have room.playerJoin & room.playerLeave callbacks so that the JS can manage any handover of information that is needed between players. Allowing JS to add to the player object would be useful but ideally letting the JS use it's own map with the same indexes would be better since it avoids any naming conflicts and avoids bloating the shared player map. JS can write to the cookie if it needs to maintain states across rooms, etc. Once we have JS web calls that can be used for any inter-player transfer of information and that would avoid unnecessary usage of Janus servers for JS data transfer.  I think the most important thing that should be a quick addition would be to let us list JS files sequentially in the HTML and have Janus append them automatically so we can write modular components and treat them as libraries. No more copy pasteing or using a script/tool to join them together."
janusVR,2tebcs,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Sat Jan 24 02:12:44 2015 UTC,"Problem with just appending JS files is that they don't combine well - consider two files that define their own room.update functions, how is this resolved?"

Does F9 not let you get over to the debugger window?"
janusVR,2tebcs,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Sun Jan 25 20:50:23 2015 UTC,"When the debugger pops up the mouse stays inside Janus and rotates the camera. If I press F9 and move the mouse out it jumps back to Janus window as soon as my mouse enters either the Debugger window or the janus window(the windows component of it is usable: minimise, close, maximise, resize via edges, etc).  I'm using tab, arrow keys, and F10 to navigate the debugger atm, it's semi-usable but not ideal."
janusVR,2tebcs,HAZARDU5,1 point,Sun Jan 25 20:59:18 2015 UTC,"Ah.  Hey, I was thinking to implement the ""sync"" boolean attribute today.  Do you have any final thoughts on that?  Will it be of use?"
janusVR,2tebcs,konchok,1 point,Sun Jan 25 21:03:13 2015 UTC,"I think adding a boolean to each object in the room.objects map that can flagged to false by the c++ after a sync and can be flagged true by the JS to trigger the sync would be a great addition. Means that the room JS has control of what should be synced and when. It would let us do different sync tickrates for different objects and even limit who can trigger syncs by some sort of name hash check (people could cheat this but it would be a decent system until we have serverside JS). Another option would be a function in javascript that takes a js_id as a parameter and triggers a sync, you could hook it up to a c++ event listener rather than polling the entire object list every frame looking at the boolean values.  I've got a room now that hijacks the WSAD keys when you cross the room boundary without you really noticing then has full physics support between the player and the scene. Being able to trigger JS events that use server synced physics objects (traps, etc) would be the next thing on my list towards the Wipeout style game we are making."

The grid in the back is also part of the project, although its purpose has yet to be added :D  I still have a lot of work to do, but it's well enough now to where I'm satisfied with taking a break from it for a little while. Eventually I'd like to be able to add a method to custom translate the objects you create, and once you're satisfied with the outcome you can save the .js script out and then apply it in your room!"

Then if some cheeky bastard changes their copy of the file to a penis then the MD5 hash of the file will change and the other clients will be like ""nooo don't download from that guy he's full of lies"". ;-) That way the server would just serve up the JanusVR tracker information for downloading the file, or the original URL of the file as a fallback.

Responsibility for maintaining the mapping from keys to values is distributed among the nodes, in such a way that a change in the set of participants causes a minimal amount of disruption.

Setup a callback chain so that when one phase is done, the next phase is popped from the queue to start downloading.  Place the objects and loading animations like you are doing now.

Euler angles seem to the standard for defining rotations in markup languages.  Am thinking to have two tags, one to define a orientation (XYZ euler angles) and another to define change in orientation/rotation over time (XYZ euler angles which define degree per second rotation)."
janusVR,2sugeg,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Sun Jan 18 18:11:07 2015 UTC,"Euler angles... I've read up briefly on them and understand the basic principle, but it's an interesting topic for sure. This seems like a math class I'd really enjoy! Well, provided I can see all of their functions in VR :D  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles   The three elemental rotations may occur either about the axes xyz of the original coordinate system, which is assumed to remain motionless (extrinsic rotations), or about the axes of the rotating coordinate system XYZ, which changes its orientation after each elemental rotation (intrinsic rotations).   Would it be correct to assume the revision will have the extrinsic rotated coordinate first (xdir, ydir, zdir) and then the addition of the intrinsic rotations, secondly specifying the ""pivot point"", if you will, of the rotation (xpiv, ypiv, zpiv) with the last tag specifying the course of the rotation in degrees per second (xdps, ydps, zdps)?  Or did I misunderstand something? :s  <Object id=""Ball"" pos=""0 0 0"" xdir=""1 0 0"" ydir=""0 1 0"" zdir=""0 0 1"" xpiv=""0 0 1"" ypiv=""0 1 0"" zpiv=""1 0 0"" xdps=""45"" ydps=""0"" zdps=""45"" />  The subject of movement through a coordinate system has always intrigued me, but the proper understanding has evaded me for quite a while... Probably because my mathematical education is currently paused somewhere in the midst of trigonometry, but still this concept is something I feel that I can grasp, especially if I can see the math happening on a 3D grid inside VR while I learn it!"
janusVR,2sugeg,JamesMcCrae,2,Mon Jan 19 23:22:18 2015 UTC,"So in the above example, you wouldn't use both xdir/ydir/zdir and xpiv/ypiv/zpiv, because they achieve the same thing (setting initial orientation of the Object).  Also the units of rotation would be in degrees, so unless you meant rotating only by 1 degree, these values would generally be different (most commonly multiples of 90).  Also, I would use ""intrinsic"" rotations.  So if for instance I want to rotate about Y then X then Z, after rotating about Y (say 60 degrees), I don't want to rotate next about the global X axis, but rather the local X axis for the object.  Thus the X axis used is one that's the original X axis, but rotated 60 degrees about Y first.  Make sense?  (Or think of it like this, the Y rotation defines ""turning"" or ""yaw"", then the X rotation defines ""looking up or down"" or ""pitch"".  You wouldn't want to rotate about the global X axis because the axis of rotation would be off by 60 degrees since we first rotated about Y.  So the correct X axis to use is the one local to the object - that is the global X axis but after the 60 degree Y rotation - this will give us the expected behaviour of rotating ""to look up and down"").  Note that the order of rotations is important.  It's a different transformation if I first rotate Y, then X, then Z, versus Z, then Y, then X.  I agree with you - interactive examples or animations would be a great aid in understanding this stuff."

janusVR,2sksil,dizzket,3,Fri Jan 16 00:47:17 2015 UTC,"That would be fantastic, although currently it's a problem if all the clients try and broadcast changes to object position using Javascript at the same time. In practical terms if users were to visit my Wasteland room and the change in height of the elevators in it were broadcast whenever it was changed by the JavaScript, the timing for how long the elevators took to travel would be all messed up as the elevators activate without any kind of user input.  For this to work effectively you'd need to have the server determine which client’s JavaScript has priority for that particular object update before broadcasting it to other players. I.e. the server would assign a ‘master’ client whose JavaScript updates would be broadcast to everyone else with priority if other clients were trying to broadcast that room objects updates at the same. If the master wasn’t broadcasting changes to an object then other clients would be allowed to update that object. This would allow my automated elevators to work without interruption, but still allow any other user to come along and click a button to activate a seperate elevator and have those updates broadcast to all the other clients including the master. If the master client disconnected or timed out the server would choose a new master to have priority in the room to ensure continuity.  Looking at some of the Unreal Engine 4 multiplayer tutorials help explain these concepts a bit better than what I've written: https://www.unrealengine.com/blog/blueprint-networking-tutorials  Basically it's a matter of ensuring persistence between all the clients and the server where the server is not doing all the heavy lifting and is just acting as a pass-through for all the clients so everyone can share the same game environment."
janusVR,2sksil,HAZARDU5,2,Fri Jan 16 04:24:27 2015 UTC,You make me realize how even simple suggestions are a lot more complicated then they seem.
janusVR,2sksil,konchok,1 point,Fri Jan 16 06:03:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pretty much. It's the same deal with the authentication for users and reserving screen names & having portals that persist even when you log off and log back in. All requires server changes / databases etc. Just need a couple of weeks sometime to actually sit down, code and test these bits of functionality before they can be merged into the official server code."
janusVR,2sksil,HAZARDU5,2,Fri Jan 16 06:18:06 2015 UTC,"man, netcode in general is a messy issue  i think we'll get there in time as other stuff on the JS side is built out more, i'm gonna go nuts when we get right-proper ajax requesting and lazyloading of assets."
janusVR,2sksil,codenamesrcl,1 point,Fri Jan 16 14:16:06 2015 UTC,"Yep, this is pretty accurate.  The goal would be for the clients to manage this themselves, and the server just passes messages on.  Also, since JS runs in the background updating objects potentially every frame (rather than just on user input as the editing mode works now), one player's JS engine instance would need to be given ""control"", otherwise there will be ""fighting"" over object properties (which in fact can happen still anyway when two players manipulate objects in the editing mode).  Of course, I'd love to have all of this happening one day soon.  I had an urge a while back to make an MMO-style room inhabited with monsters and so on.  A real multiplayer experience would have all the monsters (position and other states) synchronized between clients."
janusVR,2sksil,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Fri Jan 16 15:29:45 2015 UTC,Having an authoritative server that runs the JavaScript and sends state to everyone is what scenevr does. It'd be awesome to make Janus connect to a scenevr server :)

janusVR,2sksil,HAZARDU5,1 point,Sun Jan 18 19:17:23 2015 UTC,"James, if you can just add a simple function that does the equivilant of wiggling an object in edit mode (sync_object), we could totally do something cool with   To do the master/slave stuff between clients, you'd just have the first person that comes in check for a signal, and if they don't see it, they're the master. Someone could write that management in Javascript with no input from you whatsoever.  Anyone else who comes in will get their signal, and be assigned a slave. If there was any conflict, (someone went offline for a moment and didn't get the master signal) there'd be a variable keeping track of who has been in the room longer. The person who'd been in there longer would be the master.  All Javascript calculations would take place on the master's script, and the sync_object function would pass it through Janus. Everyone in the room would receive these calculations just like they would if someone was wiggling objects in edit mode.  :D  (like serrriousslyy add this function just so we can mess with it! all it does is ""wiggle"" the object {minus the wiggling} )"

janusVR,2sksil,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Tue Jan 20 02:18:00 2015 UTC,"Also, the ""wiggling"" idea is not a bad one, might want to only wiggle some objects per packet though, since a room with piles of objects will result in a very large single packet.  I definitely think though that there should be some notion of a ""master"" for the room, so things like synced games can be played."

I think it would be cool to be able to turn on measurement tools. When toggled on, click and hold right click to begin measuring. Perhaps it snaps to an axis (which can be changed with TAB). Or it works in 3D space. Or both :)  My interest is in exploring new methods of communication between product designers and their clients, particularly in cases where the client is also the intended end user of the product. The design of bespoke products for children with neurological conditions for example. Since the resurgence of VR I’ve been interested in the potential for remote consultations with clients using VR and 3D cameras etc, but haven’t had the time (nor expertise) to try out these ideas.  As Janus is a virtual space with 3 dimension, it would be neat to be able to measure the space with ease. I think it may open up a lot of potential for fields of research such as mine.

The original purpose was for doing precise room plans so i could go straight into blender with at least good approximate measurements for what I wanted, but it'd be trivial to design a script to do this in empty space too.  Pretty much create a 3d cursor at the user's position to start, then adjustable/moveable using whatever combination of controls the user wants.

janusVR,2sdl21,konchok,1 point,Wed Jan 14 16:53:27 2015 UTC,"concatenating the texts is not enough due to mandatory room.update, room.onClick, etc. functions that create conflicts within the code.  Unless you made it so that these functions don't have to be assigned to room."

janusVR,2s9mge,konchok,3,Tue Jan 13 09:45:26 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvU-srHhQxw  Demo of a Real-Time Non-Euclidean Ray-tracer  That vid has a spherical portal.  An interesting idea is to have a bubble where a whole room is rendered at micro scale (room max draw scale / sphere external diameter = perceived scale from outside).  Then upon passing the event horizon, the user is either A) scaled down to match the bubble universe or B) the external universe is scaled up to match or C) the scale of both rooms are inversely scaled(IE. small bubble becomes big and big becomes small). C would be the best option since the ""entrance and exit bubbles"" allow for a defined point in space to be the ""anchor"" of the 2 worlds."
janusVR,2s9mge,FireFoxG,2,Tue Jan 13 14:44:04 2015 UTC,"Intriguing idea. I'mma do a doodle :)  EDIT: Like this sort of thing? (I added a pink colour to the hemisphere for dramatic effect, I realise your concept did suggest that they could be transparent)  EDIT EDIT: As for my thoughts, I think it would be a really useful. It is similar in principle to some of the ideas talked about here. Like using the contents of one room to populate another room. I can definitely see the concept of navigating between ""different rooms"" being blurred in the future."
janusVR,2s9mge,Lewis_P,2,Tue Jan 13 11:50:54 2015 UTC,"I imagined the same thing you commented about in your edit and it makes complete sense. However, that would be easier to implement than the idea that /u/konchok is mentioning.  Placing a janus room within a janus room seems doable as it'd be like looking at another avatar that doesn't move. That sounds like a cool extension of the idea I suggested. Hopefully James sees this thread and considers that if he considers the idea of Janus rooms as objects.  Konchok's idea though needs to have the rooms be separate if I understand correctly since the ""chess game"" will need it's own javascript rules to operate that'll not interfere with people outside that bubble.   The idea sounds fascinating though. Instead of a portal (door) to another universe that's basically infinite in size, it's a bubble verse with a limited volume where leaving that volume puts you back in the main universe. If you don't click on the bubble or reclick to close it, you move through it like you would a closed portal and just interact with the main universe inside that volume. However, click on the bubble and you'll enter that small universe and bound to its rules while inside.   It feels feasible just going off tricks you can pull in Janus such as making a 500m wide portals. Well, that and how the ESC Menu is pulled off."
janusVR,2s9mge,Nukemarine,1 point,Tue Jan 13 13:08:02 2015 UTC,"I like your doodle :).  Yeah, I think you understand the basic premise.  After James left I started a discussion about simple changes that could have potentially large consequences.  And me and Crusader started talking about this idea.  I'm not sure how difficult it would be to change portals to hemisphere shape in the code, but if it's a fairly straight forward change, I hope James will add it."
janusVR,2s9mge,Nukemarine,2,Tue Jan 13 22:48:09 2015 UTC,"Bubble portals or bubble-verses sound like a better term.   As far as how Janus knows what to create, that could be - create a portal. When you first open it, Janus reads the Firebox code, realizes it's a bubble-verse and changes the flat portal into a bubble portal (Janus can say ""morphing to bubble portal"").   The question then is what determines the size of the bubble? Can that volume be altered. Can a bubble be smaller on the outside or even the inside?   Really, it's a cool idea. I thought of something similar, but it was meant more like a wormhole portal replicating what we saw in the movie Interstellar (basically create a skybox based off the entry origin texturing the outside of the teleport sphere). You're going one further making it a smaller universe that's functionally visible instead of a just a fancy portal. Really cool idea overall."
janusVR,2s9mge,Lewis_P,2,Tue Jan 13 13:17:05 2015 UTC,I like the idea of bubble verses that are bigger on the inside. Can't tell if it's like the Truman Show or just a snow globe :)
janusVR,2s9mge,JamesMcCrae,2,Tue Jan 13 13:54:38 2015 UTC,"Very cool.  Doesn't even need to be spherical though - for instance I can just picture embedding a FireBoxRoom inside another FireBoxRoom at a different scale (and yeah, it would be awesome to see people who inhabit that room at a tiny scale).  You could have a FireBoxRoom that shows a collection of smaller FireBoxRooms of interest simultaneously.  This is a pretty cool idea.  Long ago when I made ""the drunken surfer"" with the minimap this thought had occurred to me, but I didn't get it to the point where you could see the avatars running around on the minimap."
janusVR,2s9mge,Lewis_P,2,Wed Jan 14 18:36:42 2015 UTC,"Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think a cube of translucent portals would actually achieve the same effect and might be a little more achievable (from a rendering perspective perhaps?). Here's an example of what I mean.   I think the difficulty with this alternative is that currently each room can only have one main entrance portal location. With a cube you would require at least 4 entrance portals that take you to the room from four different directions."
janusVR,2s9mge,Sgeo,1 point,Tue Jan 13 13:21:46 2015 UTC,"Would it be possible to have a portal go to foo.html?entrance=a, one for foo.html?entrance=b, etc? The server can process that to determine where entrance portal is. Would it be possible for a custom chat server to decide that these are the same page (can pages even use non-standard multiplayer servers? I still don't know how multiplayer works). Also, guess the cube wouldn't be see-through all the way, since someone with entrance portal A would see the inner room but wouldn't see the entrance portal on the other side."
janusVR,2s9mge,qster123,2,Sat Jan 24 08:09:57 2015 UTC,I'm sure james mentioned a while back of the possibility for any object to be a portal :)

janusVR,2s4h6k,Nukemarine,2,Mon Jan 12 02:42:12 2015 UTC,so....you want templating/partials  i can back this for those who aren't already doing them server side.  as long as the position settings on the group are relative adjustments to the partial components default positions (or vice versa i guess).
janusVR,2s4h6k,codenamesrcl,1 point,Mon Jan 12 03:21:47 2015 UTC,"Guess ""templates"" makes sense as a term. I agree that relative adjustments are very important to this. Looking at the recent avatar object update, I notice that adjusting avatar scale also scaled the additional objects in a manner that even positions are changed to keep everything looking properly scaled. I hope that means ""templates"" could easily be treated the same."
janusVR,2s4h6k,captainbenis,3,Mon Jan 12 03:49:54 2015 UTC,"You can do this quite simply with a static site builder (see the scenevr ruby scripts, or the sirkitrees yeoman scripts or do it in php) I personally don't think this should be part of Janus."
janusVR,2s4h6k,codenamesrcl,2,Mon Jan 12 06:43:09 2015 UTC,"it's one of those things that's nice for people who don't want to go the server route yet, i see it as being similar in request to having a client side templater like Handlebars which isn't too hard to ask for given how janus processes markup as is.    I think some (or most) people have a hard enough time keeping up with learning 3d modeling and texturing/lighting/shaders that it's tough to add on a server side language on top of that.  I think in time most will eventually get around to learning PHP/C#/Ruby/Node/etc just because their needs will expand with the limitations of pure static markup with a little JS mixing and no Ajax/limited socket access."
janusVR,2s4h6k,MrM0bius,2,Mon Jan 12 14:00:06 2015 UTC,"Great idea.   More like groups than templates i think from the description.   I would say this is a little different functionality than server side compositing,  since i assume this would give you the ability to use janus edit mode collaborative tools to manipulate the entire group  together."
janusVR,2s4h6k,Lewis_P,2,Mon Jan 12 05:40:19 2015 UTC,Is this basically the ability to place rooms as asset_objects in other rooms?  Because that would be cool :)

That's unlikely as Mumble does text-to-speech and is already integrated into Janus.   Ok, I have an idea. Kettling and others have made bots. What if one bot is designed to be logged into Janus and Mumble at the same time. The bot relays all text chat in Janus VR to Mumble.

janusVR,2rwgcn,CrusaderOfMan,1 point,Sat Jan 10 03:35:06 2015 UTC,"seeing as how we have text to speech in mumble and have seen how good that is (in short, useless if not just outright funny), i'm lukewarm on the idea for communications, i get the feeling that more people will just use voip or straight text chat, the in-between just doesn't fit all that well.  Now text-to-speech on non-communications-based functions, now you are getting somewhere."
janusVR,2rwgcn,codenamesrcl,1 point,Fri Jan 9 22:09:53 2015 UTC,Having access to text-to-speech via Javascript would be pretty awesome for providing dynamic audio feedback for the user without going to the trouble of pre-recording dialogue. Especially when developing quick demos where you don't want to have to go through all the production work and just want to get stuck into the coding.
janusVR,2rwgcn,HAZARDU5,1 point,Sat Jan 10 01:26:31 2015 UTC,You might be able to do this with a web based text to speech like google translate or something that passes the text through a url.   Just generate the playsound source url dynamically with js.

It's not the best since Full Screen in YouTube will not display in Janus (launches on it's own window). Pretty much means you're left with a 850x550 resolution that's in a browser window with scroll bars visible.   If there's a way to get the full screen resolution ie 1080p or 720p then it would look amazing.   As for 360 photos, there might be some techiques. One is 3D skybox where Janus points your POV to six (or eight) directions for the skybox, takes a screen shot, saves for later use. Another could be giving a 5 degree x 180 degree POV stereo, rotate the neck model 52 different spots for screenshots, those get merged to each other for a really good S3D 360 image."

But I'm certain there is one since that's a common use scenario and it was done before the in-menu-enable-debugger button was included.  Honestly i gave up on using the qt script debugger a long time ago and just wrote a quick debug/logging library with a dev/prod mode flag to enable/disable logging.  Then I just include the logging library in my builder setting so it's included with the rest of the scripts during concat.  I did this mainly because I wanted sourcemap style debugging (i concat a lot of module libraries for my janus stuff) but I didn't know if sourcemaps were supported by Qt.  Most of the time you just need a quick log+location printout to figure out what went wrong and where anyway.  Just browse the log through a scrolling paragraph element in janus if you are doing real-time testing or save to a hard file if that's too much of a hassle."

I banged out the library in an afternoon while trying to create an in-janus source editor (this was before websurfaces became good, now i just use a node based source editor in a websurface).

Similarly, it would be neat to create, for example, a little person that has a note taking function that wanders around your avatar. It would be holding a scroll with all your different notes. I could then give you this object with it's script for you to have and use. We could all gift each other (or even sell?) these ""programs"" and use them whenever we wanted."

janusVR,2r3ef8,chimerical26,5,Sat Jan 3 02:51:07 2015 UTC,There's three modes that I would want.    Mode 1: Individual.  Everyone sees their own thing. Mode 2: Shared. (what you're suggesting)  Mode 3: Hosted. One individual has control and everyone else sees what he sees.   I think the modes that are allowed should be set per display and should be completely seperate from whether or not a room is locked.

janusVR,2r3ef8,konchok,1 point,Sat Jan 3 07:02:14 2015 UTC,"Mode 3 is interesting. In halo forge you can create arrangements of assets in multiplayer to make custom maps. To stop others from moving your objects, you can hit right on the d-pad while an asset is selected it locks the object so it cannot be accidentally moved. Once locked, no one else can interact with the object or unlock the object. Only the person who locks the object can interact with it.   Maybe something like this would work in Janus. If you want to edit an object (or interact with a websurface) without being interrupted you 'lock it' with a keyboard shortcut or something. It is then associated to you and you alone.  EDIT: Don't know enough about coding to know exactly how this might work. But I'm imagining something similar to how you can select the collision mesh for an object.   col = """"   then right arrow to change it to   col = ""cube"".   The equivalent might be   locked_to = """"  Means it is unlocked and anyone can interact with the asset. Right arrow changes it to:  locked_to = ""Lewis_P""  Meaning only the user with the name ""Lewis_P"" can interact with the object."

There was a boolean which keeps track of whether a script's room.onload function had yet been called.  Unfortunately on room reset this boolean was not set to false, causing the room script not to call onload when you hit F5.  Then, e.g. if you create an object - like your instructions thing - it would be undefined, and thus the JS would fail, halting the engine.

janusVR,2qu7ng,sirkitree,1 point,Tue Dec 30 19:00:56 2014 UTC,"Not exactly sure what you're hoping to accomplish with this, but it sounds like you just want to be able to control a particular websurface in Janus with outside UI elements. Like have typical browser navigation elements (back, forward, refresh, address) represented separately from the websurface, but control the websurface itself. Is that it?  I wonder if you could accomplish the same thing with http://socket.io which is a widely adopted library."
janusVR,2qsww4,FireFoxG,1 point,Tue Dec 30 09:43:14 2014 UTC,"You can use videos for dynamic shadow map already.  However, it's a single texture so you have to pre-multiply the shadow map with the diffuse in frames of the video file.  Just assign the Object's video_id attribute to an AssetVideo."
janusVR,2qsww4,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Tue Dec 30 09:50:28 2014 UTC,"I would need giga pixel video to do a city, or even a room though, because of the pixel per inch to match a tiled texture.  Basically, as an example, if a plane flew over my manifold city, I could have the shadows on the ground moving to match it.  BTW, check out the city :)"
janusVR,2qsww4,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Tue Dec 30 09:57:09 2014 UTC,You'd have the same problem anyway?  (you need a video resolution that matches your texture resolution)  Checked out manifold university/roxy outside.  What's new?
janusVR,2qsww4,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Tue Dec 30 12:13:25 2014 UTC,"You'd have the same problem anyway? (you need a video resolution that matches your texture resolution)   For the diffuse yes, but for the ambient layer(shadows), I can get away with far less texture size since is just a black and white gradient.  I basically, need video support for the shadow layer only.  The city would need an insane sized video to match the tileing diffuse I have, but my shadow map does the whole city at around 1.5k x 1.5k (which is a worse case situation because the city is so large with dozen of sq km of surface area)  The whole city now has awesome shadows :)  Edit, another example,  If you have ever seen independence day, when the huge ship comes over the city.  Imagine having a dynamic video shadow for the whole city as the ship goes over. pic of what I'm talking about"
janusVR,2qoh3g,dizzket,3,Mon Dec 29 04:07:15 2014 UTC,"The idea is basically get clients to index the entire internet, submit analytic information for website owners, etc, and reward them in arbitrary lights and noises by making it into a game :D  People would get competitive about their level and achievements, because that's basic human psychology. Muahahaha B)  That sounds super evil, but it already happens in the traditional web. (Plus this'd be an opt-in program)  This could be a legit way for James to make money to keep developing Janus. Google makes Chrome, but makes their money off of their internet services. An ads service and analytic service would be awesome as well.  This indexing system would only index rooms with FireboxRoom code. Also, you'd be able to get three dimensional heatmap data, directional data, and whatever other aspects you opt into. There could be a list of things that you'd like to publicly share, like position, name and direction etc., and they'd all give you a bit more experience, but you could disable them and not transmit that data.  This would also give people a sense of purpose within Janus. They're earning status points and discovering the internet. It'll also inspire the growth of the VR web.  If you didn't want to be a part of this program, you'd just press a button and it would turn off."
janusVR,2qoh3g,HAZARDU5,2,Mon Dec 29 04:09:13 2014 UTC,It'd be great to offer users the opportunity to tag rooms they visit. The crawler code I've previously written to index JanusVR sites is pretty rudimentary in picking out key words. Humans do this a lot better than crawlers for 3D content right now so that'd really help with indexing the rooms and making them more searchable.

It managed to erase all the files in the install root (userid's, workspace.txt, bookmarks.txt) though not any of the folders.  I tried again to the default C:\JanusVR and that seemed to work fine.  No big deal, all my actual workspace folders and assets were maintained, just have to set the locations again and figure out some head positions for avatars to rebuild the userid's.

janusVR,2qai07,NXT_Aussie,2,Wed Dec 24 21:51:24 2014 UTC,"One simple compromise could be that Janus VR snaps to 1.0 as the default instead of 0.1 when in editing mode. The objects, images, primitives, etc snap to the nearest 1.0 value when first placed. Also, initial orientation will always be (1,0,0 0,1,0 0,0,1) when snap setting is 1.0 which gets rid of e6 rounding errors that currently pop up.  I am hoping James will make a way for us to use declared assets as texture attributes on objects. Something like in editing mode, one tab section is Texture="""" and you scroll through all image_id, video_id and web_id assets. Janus applies the correct setting depending on the texture.

janusVR,2pyie2,JamesMcCrae,2,Sun Dec 21 07:48:45 2014 UTC,"Not sure if I'm doing something wrong, but there seems to be an issue with the primitives not loading.   I opened my room Immediately built a box fort (as one might expect) Added a 'Keep out!' sign Saved the room and quit janusvr Copied the saved text files content to my vrsites room at vrsites.com (as I usually do to save my progress) Returned to my room to find that my box fort no longer exists, but the sign is still there Saved the room a second time to see what had happened. The script for my box fort is present in the text file but it does not manifest in the room :(   Here is the output file for my room  EDIT: Noticed my error log mentioned it:  [Sun Dec 21 15:19:43 2014] error loading ./assets/primitives/cube.obj"
janusVR,2pyie2,Lewis_P,2,Sun Dec 21 13:08:46 2014 UTC,"OK, fixed, will be in 32.5 when I release it.  The problem was it was writing out <AssetObject> tags for the local primitives, which Janus should not do.  When trying to look for your room it would look (online) for ""./assets/primitives/cube.obj"" etc assuming you were overwriting the ""cube"" id for AssetObjects, and of course not find them.    So the fix was just not to write out those builtin AssetObjects (you'll be able to make your room work for now if you just delete the following lines):  <AssetObject id=""capsule"" src=""./assets/primitives/capsule.obj"" />  <AssetObject id=""cone"" src=""./assets/primitives/cone.obj"" />  <AssetObject id=""cube"" src=""./assets/primitives/cube.obj"" />  <AssetObject id=""cylinder"" src=""./assets/primitives/cylinder.obj"" />  <AssetObject id=""pipe"" src=""./assets/primitives/pipe.obj"" />  <AssetObject id=""plane"" src=""./assets/primitives/plane.obj"" />  <AssetObject id=""pyramid"" src=""./assets/primitives/pyramid.obj"" />  <AssetObject id=""sphere"" src=""./assets/primitives/sphere.obj"" />  <AssetObject id=""torus"" src=""./assets/primitives/torus.obj"" />"

janusVR,2pyie2,NXT_Aussie,1 point,Sun Dec 21 21:25:22 2014 UTC,"I know there was some debate over whether primitive objects should be included. My two cents is that at this stage in janusVR's development,  actually exploring the impact of these additions is far more valuable than just discussing their merits :) Personally I think it will encourage creativity and lower the entry level for building vr rooms."
janusVR,2pyie2,NXT_Aussie,1 point,Sun Dec 21 10:42:39 2014 UTC,"Right.  I think I've got a good compromise here.  It avoids creating a new tag for each primitive type since it's in the ID, and in the event another page uses one of these reserved IDs e.g. ""cube"", the AssetObject in the markup ""overwrites"" the local cube AssetObject, and it all works as intended."
janusVR,2pyie2,NXT_Aussie,1 point,Sun Dec 21 10:45:23 2014 UTC,"You should obsolete the use_local_asset function and make the room templates as primitive objects. (Or at least the home room.) Then again, it'd be weird having it be in the default spawn menu.   Hmmmmmm  Only reason I bring it  up is because it's strange having two methods of local assets."
janusVR,2pyie2,Lewis_P,2,Sun Dec 21 18:46:29 2014 UTC,You're right.  It would be cleaner to just use Objects for everything.

janusVR,2pq3ov,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Fri Dec 19 03:15:00 2014 UTC,"Yes.  For instance when I run Janus with v-sync off I'm getting performance in the 100's (sometimes 1000's) of FPS, on both Linux and Windows.  This assumes you are using updated graphics card vendor's drivers for both OS's."

I've been getting increasingly annoyed with Linux' (and/or Nvidias) way of handling multiple displays. It doesn't save settings, and from what I can tell, there's no easy way to switch refresh rates. I tried it in CompizConfig, but that doesn't seem to take. Xrandr says that my main monitor is running at 120hz, and the rift at 75hz. That in itself could be the problem, but I don't know how to change it in Linux.  Are you doing anything in regards to your screen-setup prior to starting JanusVR, James?"

janusVR,2pmoa0,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Wed Dec 17 23:57:16 2014 UTC,"Good idea on the editing mode. This also frees up ""Shift+Click"" and ""CNTL+Click"" for left and right which can be other intuitive navigation choices.  Edit Mode Off suggestions  Left click no longer automatically accesses Web pages or teleports. Right click no longer used to exit web pages. This allows use of Right Click menus on web pages.  Shift+Left Click - teleport and web access function.  Hold down left click, press Shift for this mode, release Shift to cancel or Left Click to activate     When holding down Left Click, press Shift to make the hologram appear. Releasing Shift makes the man disappear while releasing Left Click makes you teleport.  On a portal, Shift+Left Click causes it to open (if not already) and teleport through.  On the web page, you access the web page. Shift+left click again to deaccess (another option appears on the right click menu). On a player, you teleport in front of and face the player On an image or video asset, you enter VIEWER MODE. In viewer mode, you have options to change how you're viewing this image or video. As this would merit a whole new Janus VR version, I won't expand on this for now.   Shift+Right Click - Project View function. Only your orientation works. Use R or Select Key to reset view   When holding Shift with right clicking, a green hologram appears. Releasing shift projects your view to that hologram spot.  On other users, your view position (not orientation) is shifted by that player's movement.  On a portal, your view is shifted to 1 meter directly in front (scaled to size of portal).  On a web pages, images or videos, your view is shifted to center and 2 meters away (adjusted by scale of asset) from the object.  While in web page mode, Shift+Right Click centers your view and orientation to the where your cursor presently is at.   CNTL+Left Click - no function at this time  CNTL+Right Click - Copy Functions   On avatars or ghosts, changes your avatar.  On portals, copies the URL to clipboard,  On webpage (not accessed), copies current URL of webpage to clip board.  On web page (acessed), this starts highlight then copies highlighted area to clipboard when Right Click is released.   ALT+Left Click - Demonstration Function    hold down ALT makes your cursor visible to other people.  On release, the cursor becomes a signalling arrow that lasts for 1 second Release on users or ghosts to put arrow above the avatars Release on portal to cause ""glow"" to flash  ALT+Right Click - no function at this time   With there being an official Edit Mode, this could also be a good time to discuss more efficient layout with regard to how editing works.  This could be a good time to use the NUMPAD as a navigation input.   Not sure the full use but with ""Num Lock"" off that gives access to Arrows, Home/End, PgUp/PgDn, Ins, /*-+, Enter in addition to the right thumb resting on the actual arrow keys. So the 789 and 456 positions would be the QWE and ASD equivalent. The + could be Jump, the 2 could be Flight.   It's not a thought out suggestion and from what I understand most don't use the NUMPAD to navigate anymore but it might be worth discussing to see if it merits inclussion."

janusVR,2phryz,CrusaderOfMan,1 point,Tue Dec 16 18:48:20 2014 UTC,I really like the idea of grouping assets together. I guess the first step towards that would be being able to select more than one object at a time.   I'd imagine exporting the room as a .obj is a whole other ball-game.
janusVR,2phryz,Lewis_P,1 point,Tue Dec 16 21:03:48 2014 UTC,"I'd more so like the grouping of assets within an ""edit room mode"" feature. I agree that exporting as an .obj would be rather difficult.

janusVR,2ph2rr,macromarco83,1 point,Tue Dec 16 15:16:31 2014 UTC,"So there are various strategies to culling - view frustum and occlusion shown here, in addition to using LOD models.  Janus currently does none of this stuff :) (so it's an area for potentially great improvements).   In terms of LOD stuff, I'm not sure whether you'd want Janus doing arbitrary surface simplification or you would want to have preauthored LOD models, which would be supplied to Janus.  The latter is probably best, since you get a guaranteed look that way.    This LOD stuff would also relate to download priority - you'd want the lowest poly models first since they show up fast, and you could render those first, until the high poly geometry comes in."
janusVR,2ph2rr,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Tue Dec 16 17:45:01 2014 UTC,"That sounds right, I have to admit that I don't really know many of the terms for this so I'm just trying to explain things as I go along.  ""Preauthored LOD models"", are we talking about low, medium and high poly models for everything in a room/world ? how would this then work for a room where you for example have a mesh hill or two, or a mesh terrain. How would this work in the high/med/low poly mesh sense ? Would it render each part of the mesh dependent on distance ? (Or is this even possible?) Like if you have a very tall statue, down around the feet you would notice the poly count more than say the middle or top of the statue. Could you then use 3 versions of the statue that have high, med, low poly where you then render the lower 1/3 of the high poly, then for the middle, render the middle of the medium poly model, and for the top, tender the top part of the low poly model ? Ergo, is it possible to load only a part of a model ?"

Getting several hundred fps in home room alone on that old card. I'm still finding the bouncing head thing on the bot to be somewhat strange :P  A few minor bugs: The text box/chat box renders behind the chat log, making it hard to read what you are writing.  The mouse cursor has a strange tendency to render at two different depths. An example is that I was trying to select a object/image on a wall and noticed that it looked strange with the dk2 on. CLosed one eye, then switched to the other, on one eye the cursor was where it was supposed to be and the other eye, the cursor was gone or rendered behind the wall.

janusVR,2pbvk4,codenamesrcl,1 point,Mon Dec 15 08:26:48 2014 UTC,"OpenGL, awesome.  I'm wondering if JanusVR is for web-content only or if it can also be used for local files like a 3D desktop?  If it has local content as well, you might want to think about embedding an emulator framework to allow people to play emulator games within the VR world.  I implemented something called libretro into my 3D desktop program in just a few days of work.  I was limited because my project is not OpenGL, so I wasn't able to have support for emulators that require hardware rendering,  However, JanusVR is OpenGL and shouldn't be too hard to implement that very important HW acceleration.  If you're interested, and JanusVR is written in C++, I can setup a sort of bare-bones C++ class for a libretro implementation that you should be able to easily expand upon by tying in the OpenGL calls that I was unable to do in my project.  No credit is needed.  I know expanding a project from 1 person to multiple people involves a lot."

It also puts them on the fast track to inside out tracking software which Carmack had been working on recently.  I wanna see if they integrate in the tracking api into the SDK proper or if they stick to plugin based like they did for Visisonic's RealSpace 3D sound.  I spoke to them about a C++ based sdk which they said that it's on the immediate horizon while they work out the plugins for Unity and Unreal.  Janus integration would be sweet and give a (now) highly probable peripheral option alongside the Leap.  I guess we'll see what happens.  13th Lab is working on 3D reconstructions in real time for simulation work in VR.

He's a really top class motion capture expert where he does a lot of research at the Graphics and Motion Lab at NYU's Courant Institute.  I took a motion capture class he was doing at the undergrad level and was a lot of fun working with the first generation Kinect and diving into stuff like photogrametry.  But this guy is just ridiculously talented and knows his stuff, still working in the professional world doing mocap setups for movie studios.  Oculus is still on course to being a ridiculously huge thinktank and on the way to being a first party developer of content.  Maybe a consulting company if they want to loan out guys like Prof Bregler to studios wanting to do mocap for applications/games...honestly i don't know, they have a whole university's worth of researchers and engineers."

Edit: and yet it still comes out as a pure stream of thoughts, sigh.  There is room for everything in VR (if we ever run out of room in the multiverses of the metaverses, boy are we screwed), but iterating on present day is far easier for the user to grasp from an interaction standpoint.  Grounding things in existing mental models makes interactions less of an obstacle to a good experience.  It's part of reason why the movie theaters and cockpit games are such low hanging fruits in terms of ""just making sense for VR"".  It's a reliance on just the basics of VR as we know it.    It's the reason the past works so well because we have preconceived notions of how the world may have been ""back then"" based on prior education or experiences of other renditions.  The future is in everyone's imagination and it's different in vast ways for each person, even at the upper echelons of futurists I'd imagine.  We have a hard enough time sometimes training people to use their heads to look around after years and years of using mice and controllers to do that.

Biological evolution has tailored us to feel comfortable in the physical environments we usually reside in. While technological evolution has pushed new features in to our environments that we have had to psychologically become comfortable with.   VR has the capacity to replace environments entirely which is perhaps too much of a stretch for us to continue to expect to feel naturally comfortable residing within. Hence relying on representations of familiar environments.  Maybe, and I'm sure others have considered this thought, the 'uncanny valley' idea that is so frequently talked about regarding human likeness dipping in to unfamiliarity as it increases, could be applied to environments in some way."

Now how that would work with Janus right now, was thinking about toying around with janus cookies and a short listener bound to the room's update event.  No existence proof yet but another experiment i want to try out in the future for fun.  Also not sure if a cookies query will reload the cookies file each time so that external changes are imported, doubtful, but worth trying at least, should probably do a lower level test for this before going forward with cookies based stuff (really wish we had a sqlite instance for this kind of thing, oh well, i'm a hacker at heart i guess if this is the solution i came up with).  If open outside browsers are fair game, then i guess having a chrome or firefox window open is also a potential path using a similar workflow.

I find that much easier to deal with than using qt's debugger now adays, particularly because line numbers don't mean much to me since i concat everything into one script for janus using nodejs+gulp.  if you are savy with nodejs, i would highly suggest you go with a common build system like grunt, gulp, etc.  Having a JSLint-or-equivalent tool really helps with catching common errors/mistakes that are bound to happen, along with packaging/concatenating/minifying scripts and other such things that are just common to the workflow.  Having a change-watch tool is also a godsend, copying changes automatically to your test environment as you code so you don't have to copy-paste constantly if you separate the code from the environments."

Is there a general problem with Nvidia and Janus? Has it been identified and just needs work or is it still a mystery at this point?"
janusVR,2o77zf,codenamesrcl,2,Thu Dec 4 15:54:27 2014 UTC,"yes, there is a general performance problem with nvidia compared to AMD, this has been known for a while now.    i got a 970 waiting to be dropped into my new rig (gotta finish assembly tonight) and i have a good idea of what i'll be getting from janus.  Generally you should never have the drivers force vsync globally, it should be forced on a per application basis and/or let the application decide if vsync should be used via it's own settings.  i can't test janus until my new rig is finished because i'm dropping in parts from my existing rig as well (psu/hdd's/odd), even then it wouldn't be on my existing 560ti so i couldn't even give a comparison between 30.5 and 30.6"
janusVR,2o77zf,macromarco83,1 point,Thu Dec 4 16:42:34 2014 UTC,"you'd probably get a very similar result on both the 560ti and the 970. The problem is with how Nvidia deals with OpenGL. They fucked up (I got a 750Ti just 1.5 months ago and I'm having the same problem). AMD/ATI has it down good, on old ati cards, people are getting results up in the 2-300 fps in heavy polygon count rooms where nvidia cards would cause you to wonder if the machine had frozen. The VR Bar is a good place to test it, on ATI cards, that room flows like silk, but (like with me) with Nvidia cards, it drops down to 15-20  fps most places in the bar even on 30.6-7  Fuck you Nvidia!!"
janusVR,2o77zf,codenamesrcl,1 point,Thu Dec 4 19:22:56 2014 UTC,"hmm, would've thought that even a little bit of extra horse power would make a difference over a 560ti.  i guess i'll find out for sure when i finish my build.  gonna be gaming away from janus for the weekend probably as my focus will be on rewriting the core of my janus file browser into nodejs (about halfway done with the conversion after about a day or two, no janus testing required).    honestly it's something i'm not all that concerned about since the driver benefits are always worth it for other applications, it's not like janus is my only performant application in use.  My only janus comparison will come from my janus file browser which wasn't a problem even with reasonable poly theater templates, not super texture heavy though with the templates i'm working on."
janusVR,2o77zf,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Thu Dec 4 20:05:08 2014 UTC,I'm wondering where you've gotten information regarding nvidia's inferior opengl support.

janusVR,2o77zf,JamesMcCrae,1 point,Thu Dec 4 20:15:46 2014 UTC,Thanks. I previous had the vsync setting to let the application determine this (which I would prefer to keep). Is there a way to tell Janus on launch to turn off vsync itself so that I can have it on for other applications?

janusVR,2nw5rg,macromarco83,1 point,Tue Dec 2 20:44:59 2014 UTC,"honestly, i'll take the lower fps in the janus client if it means i get those back in the standard games that i play, which i will when i get my 970 plus the rest of my new rig.  i'll just brute force it to 90 with the sheer raw powah.  it's always a tradeoff you have to consider when doing builds no matter what.  i gotta snag a copy of the latest z0ne build from pixelrouter when i seem james andrew next time, would probably run butter smooth on a 970 and i need the practice if i'm ever going to challenge the all time high score (cris miranda, i'm coming for that record).  i'm honestly tempted to just drop in my old 5770 after i assemble my new rig and see what fps it will get off of a 5770 and a Phenom II 965, just for shits and giggles."

janusVR,2npe70,macromarco83,2,Sat Nov 29 21:17:33 2014 UTC,"Hey, I don't know if this is the right place for it but:  A few suggestions:  Chat / PM   Have a filter on the method user_chat that filters messages with for example @username (since ! is used for other things) as a private message to the user in the same room. And since messages/chat's in the same room are not broadcast too other rooms, have a small separate ""mail"" system for server-global mail for users/players. (this might require a database running on the server, I'd love to try building this part for you) A ""clear chat messages"" would be nice (#clearmsg, or something like that) A chat messages scroll-back (page_up/page_down?) like you see in quake/half life and other games that have a command console, so we can look back on what's happened in the chat.   Friends list etc:   I'd also love to get my hands dirty on this part if possible. I have several ideas on how to implement it in code, not that much in gui :P but I'd love to try.   Misc:   Some documentation on command line arguments for the janusvr executable, or a /? -h --help function. On the same note, being able to start in ""windowed mode"" is something that would be handy.   More far-fetched:   Sound originating from users or from objects. if you saw my turkeys bouncing around the home room the other day, that would have been a good place to where it'd be funny if I/we could have them making ""gobel-gobel"" sounds :P I am working on making some bird bot's that might liven up the homeroom, and also try putting some A.I.(of some sort) into them to react to events in the room, but it would be a lot nicer if I could get them to chirp. I'm talking about positional sound sources :/ and as far as I've been told, you don't have much experience with sound ?   Anyway, this is just a small list of suggestions, I hope some of it is something that would be nice to add.   Source"

janusVR,2nl3zh,sirkitree,4,Thu Nov 27 16:04:14 2014 UTC,"For any models with collision, make a second limited dissolved mesh to reduce the poly count and use that for the collision mesh. It's better to have a single large mesh, image, etc, rather then a 1000 individual parts.  More stuff means more draw calls, which means more lag. Use the right sized image for whatever your going for. A ""physically"" small image does not need to be 2k x 2k resolution (I'm guilty of not doing this as much as I should)  Reuse everything that you possibly can(except meshes).  Every image you can reuse, every video, etc... is all stored in the render pipeline only once. (the meshes are the exception because its better to have a single larger mesh then a ton of smaller meshes because of the draw calls) If you have a decent computer which gets 120 fps in a room (particularly AMD), Then you can be sure the Nvidia guys of the same gen GPU are only getting 40 or less FPS.  Keep this in mind when making rooms so that even lower end computers can see decent frame rates.  For example, when I'm getting 160 fps in a room, most Nvidia cards are right around 60fps in the same room.  See this thread for computer/FPS comparisons http://www.reddit.com/r/janusVR/comments/2kyop0/janus_vr_fps_test/ High rez video is a huge drag... The rifts do not have high rez, so they don't need 1080p videos. Unless you are going for realism... don't put bathrooms, trashcans, etc, the small details... into your room.  People are not going to say"" without a bathroom in this house... I'm not getting presence""."
janusVR,2nl3zh,FireFoxG,2,Fri Nov 28 07:27:51 2014 UTC,"I agree with all of this except on the re-use of meshes.   Sometimes it is actually better to have multiple instances of geometry rather than grouping it all into the same mesh  if you have a lot of repeated features.   It's a trade off between  model complexity vs # of draw calls,  gotta find the right balance (remember when the big bunny theater loaded as 1 mesh it was 50% slower than when it used mesh instances for the seats).   Sometimes it just takes some trial and error to find the right balance."
janusVR,2nl3zh,MrM0bius,2,Sat Nov 29 14:52:33 2014 UTC,"Splitting the meshes helps with collision calculations as well.   If the room is a single mesh,  the collision is calculated for everything,  all the time.   With separate meshes,  it only calculates collision when it sees you're within the bounding box of the object.  So objects with complex collision models are best left outside of the main mesh (though i second your thoughts about a limited dissolve or decimate on the collision mesh being good practice.)   Also,  if the object doesn't need colision (especially small detailed objects), you should  just leave the collision  out completely."
janusVR,2nl3zh,MrM0bius,3,Sat Nov 29 15:01:23 2014 UTC,"It'd be nice write a tool like YSlow for Janus rooms, that gives you a performance report, recommending steps you can take to optimize the room. Reduce model size, reduce texture size, etc."

janusVR,2niq36,codenamesrcl,1 point,Wed Nov 26 22:13:44 2014 UTC,"on it's own, no, you would need a headless browser to load the comments before attempting to translate the markup.  Titles can be done as is with smart selectors, though that's probably not how the current translator works.  I had been toying around with a new imgur translator in phantom/node about 1-2 months ago which gets the content pretty fast and accurately as long as the selectors are written properly, i didn't get around to finishing it to the point where it constructs organized janus markup.  All it did was scrape the gallery images and their titles.  I remember that sam was working on a man-in-the-middle-esque project in the same vain at the time to avoid having the client/service relationship between janus and the node translator system.  If we are going to get that kind of content (comments or anything loaded via scroll detection ), then we'd have to think about integrating a node or phantom instance just to make the creation of translators like that easier ( i'm fine having node separate but i know people don't like that idea very much ).  Might even be better to use imgur's api rather than build a raw page translator if we are talking about more long term options."
janusVR,2niq36,captainbenis,1 point,Thu Nov 27 05:20:42 2014 UTC,You could use the imgur api and write a converter from the json. I did something similair for reddit galleries using their json endpoint.

Oh, I should also mention, when others are subscribed to the URL and receive others' movement events, the JSON stuff for ""data"" actually all ends up in an attribute called ""position"" when forwarded from the server."
janusVR,2n4roh,MrM0bius,1 point,Fri Nov 28 18:12:54 2014 UTC,I know :) I've been having the bot output the entire JSON string that is sends/receives so I've been able to pars it and understand it pretty well.  The info you posted is a lot of help too!!
janusVR,2n4roh,macromarco83,1 point,Sat Nov 29 15:59:46 2014 UTC,"The new portal system is really cool! :D I moved a bush in one room and watched as it changed in another.  You should try doing some more portal physics type stuff like in Portal. It'd be cool to be able to teleport using them, or put one on the floor and one on the wall and jump through it. It'd be way more fun to get around Janus with a portal gun than instant teleportation.  Even without a portal gun, though, just having physics when moving through the portals would be great, and being able to place them on floors and ceilings and stuff."
janusVR,2n4roh,MrM0bius,1 point,Sun Nov 23 05:02:42 2014 UTC,"Finally got the time to give this a spin (actually bought the leap for this), I really appreciate adding the functionality. I'm just wondering if this version is a bit buggy though, i seem to lose my hands quite a bit, sometimes one will still track but not the other. I compared with another demo and it seemed to track okay?"

janusVR,2n4roh,dizzket,1 point,Sun Nov 23 12:40:40 2014 UTC,I have a guy on the Facebook page saying he can't get it working at all. What are the standard pre-requisits to having the leap working with Janus?
janusVR,2n4roh,sirkitree,1 point,Sun Nov 23 19:21:56 2014 UTC,"Also if using a Dk2, be sure to calibrate by pressing R (otherwise it may be working but you're just not seeing your hands since the view isn't right)"
janusVR,2n4roh,dizzket,1 point,Mon Nov 24 02:05:58 2014 UTC,"I have started looking at DanBeard's bot for the earlier versions of JanusVR and have been playing with it to see if I can incorporate some logic or ""AI"" to it. What I see in the code is that it is using a roomID to where the bot pop's up when you run the code. The ID is for the old homeroom and is only visible for the older versions of janus. what is the new home room's ID or is there a better method I can use for it to join the home room without statically putting the room id into the code ? If possible, I'd like to get it to start on my own room/site so not to bother the rest of the good folks in the public home room :) I will be needing to fool around with it quite a bit until I get it working properly :P"
janusVR,2n4roh,MrM0bius,1 point,Sun Nov 23 20:16:11 2014 UTC,"I think the roomID is just the md5 hash of the room url, press / in the homeroom to see the url.   (someone correct me if i'm mistaken)"
janusVR,2n52ae,JamesMcCrae,2,Sun Nov 23 04:19:10 2014 UTC,"Heading out in just a moment, hopefully everything goes smoothly with setting up and I didn't forget anything.  I'll probably be James_IMMERSED in Janus, if you want to come harass me :) (virtually or at the event!)"
janusVR,2n52ae,Nukemarine,2,Sun Nov 23 12:57:56 2014 UTC,Give us a heads up if you want some people on the internet to help interact with your presentation or demos if any. Have fun!
janusVR,2n52ae,Devlin1991,2,Sun Nov 23 16:01:11 2014 UTC,I'll try to pop on if you give us a heads-up.
janusVR,2n4q4p,Nukemarine,2,Sun Nov 23 01:57:14 2014 UTC,"most of those things would be cookie based, at least for right now.  A more modern solution would be what we have now in browser-land, localStorage.  Effectively this is a sqlite database used to store local-bound data that can be accessed by the browser after-load through JS.  It has an advantage over cookies in that the size stored by any one domain/site is virtually unlimited.  Of course the page developer has to take advantage of this in order for it to be of any use to the end-user but it's relatively trivial to program if the developer wishes to use this kind of feature in their rooms.  It'd be cool to see this happen in the future, as it allows for exactly what you want, client-side state persistence.  And the access from JS is dead simple.  Everything is a Key/Value pair (a dictionary).  You could write a simple 2 function library to handle the GET and SET commands which could be copied to any room that needs to use it.    Most if not all user-settings can be stored in this manner so you could go as far as offering to teleport the user to the last place they were in the room (like if the room is exploration based) or for storing bookmarks for room coordinates ( user would be presented with a micro-scale room map and a list of saved coordinates to navigate to ).  The only issue, though minor, would be carrying over the db.  Janus would only have to check if a db file is present, if so then use that existing db file, else create a new one.  I haven't had the chance to test the limits of Janus cookies yet, but I'd be willing to bet most of these things can already be done with straight cookies as long as the data size is not too large.  Content injection is a different thing entirely, it's something that belongs in the same realm as markup interpretation through a middleman (what the translators are).  Can we do it, sure.  Should we be able to do it in every room, not so sure about that, maybe.  I definitely see the point for a few things like injectable UI scripts and libraries (greasemonkey-like stuff), but for complete content replacement, not sure, probably another room attribute flag to consider."

janusVR,2n3hdw,totes_meta_bot,2,Sat Nov 22 18:39:42 2014 UTC,Will opening a new room still refresh the website in case it's been updated? Also how hard would it be to add the render mode cycle button back in?
janusVR,2n3hdw,dizzket,1 point,Sat Nov 22 18:28:47 2014 UTC,"No it won't refresh via opening a new room (part of the point, to reuse the assets).  Will have to double check whether a Ctrl+R/F5 works though.  Re: render mode cycle.  Easy for some render modes - 2d, sbs, sbs_reverse, harder for Rift mode.  The reason being the newer 0.4.x SDK takes the buffer and does its own things with it, I have to add in things to enable/disable this before cycling."

One thing ;) when I look at my alternate Chibii in the same room the head is much higher than the body http://imgur.com/5gIBZN2"
janusVR,2n3hdw,HAZARDU5,1 point,Sat Nov 22 18:27:17 2014 UTC,Thanks man :)  Re: head bug - fixed in 30.3!
janusVR,2n3hdw,--jt--,1 point,Sun Nov 23 02:19:28 2014 UTC,I'm thinking that it'd be nice to expose some of the graphics and rendering settings for people with slower machines so users can adjust them. I'm presently running JanusVR inside a Virtual Machine for development on OSX and since the updates to the starting room and VRSites lobby my FPS grinds to a halt when entering these rooms :-(  Also had to disable auto-loading the new JanusVR lobby from the starting room as the amount of shaders running in that room doesn't play nice with my VM...
janusVR,2n3hdw,sirkitree,1 point,Sat Nov 22 21:42:49 2014 UTC,Yes. This plz. I have no idea when I'll be able to upgrade my potato - let alone buy a rift - but I'd sure like to get involved in building my own rooms. :)

janusVR,2n3hdw,HAZARDU5,1 point,Sun Nov 23 02:02:10 2014 UTC,"Re: VRsites lobby.  It might the webview/video playing (it's kind of hidden but is in an adjacent area).  That might have something to do with it?  Re: JanusVR lobby.  Interesting, there should only be 1 shader at work though (located in /assets/shaders/trans_frag.txt )"
janusVR,2n3hdw,HAZARDU5,1 point,Sun Nov 23 02:21:00 2014 UTC,After some experimentation it looks like there's some sort of performance bottleneck when looking through the portal to the JanusVR lobby from the user's personal 'home' workspace. Entering the portal or starting from within the JanusVR lobby seems to fix this.
janusVR,2n3hdw,HAZARDU5,1 point,Sun Nov 23 04:30:15 2014 UTC,Although if I download a copy of the lobby and view it through the portal in the workspace room the issue doesn't happen.
janusVR,2n3hdw,HAZARDU5,1 point,Sun Nov 23 04:34:24 2014 UTC,"Interestingly, when adding the JanusVR lobby as a bookmark link then activating the portal in the bookmarks room the issue isn't present either."
janusVR,2n31sd,EvilSchwin,2,Sat Nov 22 15:25:41 2014 UTC,Get the 30.2 update.  I have made some very huge improvements to memory allocation in this update.
