nfl,3e38jo,EatSleepJeep,32,Tue Jul 21 17:02:30 2015 UTC,The NFLPA shares details of all contracts with all registered agents in the interest of competitive compensation. They always leak.
nfl,3e38jo,jasoncongo,8,Tue Jul 21 17:22:11 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they will at some point, but the article says its team policy to not disclose contract info. That doesn't mean AP of his agent or something won't tell the media."

nfl,3e38jo,Takeme2yourleader,4,Tue Jul 21 17:55:54 2015 UTC,Patterson has been totally average (or below) at this point.
nfl,3e38jo,bee1010,4,Tue Jul 21 17:59:53 2015 UTC,It's tough starting chemistry with a rookie qb. He will come around. I think he has potential. That's my opinion
nfl,3e38jo,Takeme2yourleader,3,Tue Jul 21 18:09:03 2015 UTC,"To me, it's not about chemistry. Patterson just isn't in the right spots when running his routes. It's hard for Bridgewater to depend on him in a timing and anticipation offense when Patterson isn't where he's supposed to be."
nfl,3e38jo,StateFairShare,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:01 2015 UTC,So you don't think he will improve a lot this off season
nfl,3e38jo,fiction8,2,Tue Jul 21 18:41:37 2015 UTC,I'm not saying that he won't but he had Greg Jennings to learn from last year and Jennings is one of the better route runners in the league.

nfl,3e38jo,krashmania,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:52:51 2015 UTC,I think Jarius is better at this point.

I'm seriously hoping the training he's done this offseason helps him step it up, and the dude is incredible in space, but he needs to get polished up still."
nfl,3e38jo,Imbrandnewhere,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:28:43 2015 UTC,He has potential. I believe he will be way better this year along with a good running game to help out. And improved chemistry with teddy

But you can't evaluate players based on potential and say they look good.

nfl,3e38jo,superfeds,3,Tue Jul 21 17:20:54 2015 UTC,"PFT reporting that the only guarantee is for this season, and the Vikings will still have to make a choice before the 2016-17 season to cut or restructure again. Doesn't change anything."
nfl,3e38jo,superfeds,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:25:32 2015 UTC,"Without knowing the details, its hard to speculate on that.  However, the value of the contract isnt changing...just how its paid out.  So if they move money up front, that just makes it easier to cut him down the road, and more years arent being added.  There are only 2 years left on it after this one.  Rest of the career is a big stretch"
nfl,3e38jo,c0ur4ge,28,Tue Jul 21 17:15:58 2015 UTC,"After 2015 he had 0 guaranteed money and way more non-guaranteed money than he could realistically expect to be paid. Without this restructure, he almost certainly would have been cut after this year. That's part of the reason he held out. It's reasonable to assume that that was the point of the restructure, to make it feasible for him to play here beyond 2015."
nfl,3e38jo,bretris,4,Tue Jul 21 17:23:25 2015 UTC,"It probably makes managing the cap a bit easier, which is what the Vikings wanted, but we dont know to what extent.  Thats why its hard to speculate without the details, Im sure it will come out soon.  Even if he does play out the length of the contract, he really likes money and he doesnt seem to have any great loyalty to the Vikings.  He will be 33 when the contract is up...and at that point I could see him playing elsewhere rather easily.  Like I said, rest of his career is a big stretch at this point."
nfl,3e38jo,Dybs_On_That,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:34:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, provided his legs stay under him over the next couple seasons, he'll probably keep playing. He wants some more fodder for Canton."

nfl,3e38jo,admvp,9,Tue Jul 21 18:37:36 2015 UTC,"Have to wait for the details before you can really judge this one. Almost all restructures for star players just convert non-guaranteed money to guaranteed bonuses that provide immediate cap relief to the team, but this is a unique situation.  Usually they are great for the players - they get more guaranteed money, they get it now, and they are harder to cut in the future because they have more dead money (so they get more of the non-guaranteed money). It's usually bad or neutral for the team - they borrow cap space from the future to get it now, but it can bite them if the player unexpectedly declines.  Peterson, as an old runningback, is a prime candidate to suddenly decline (and yes, 30 is old for a RB). So I'm really intrigued to see what concessions Peterson had to give up to get the increased ""security"" he says he received, if he gave up anything."
nfl,3e38jo,LackofOriginality,3,Tue Jul 21 17:31:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, hopefully he actually took something of a pay cut in exchange for this. Having the non-guaranteed portion made his contract extremely flexible for the team just in case he does hit the brick wall.  I don't think he will, and I think this is a good idea for both parties, but if he does, oh boy. We're fucked."
nfl,3e38jo,zombiexsp,4,Tue Jul 21 17:47:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think he will, and I think this is a good idea for both parties, but if he does, oh boy. We're fucked.   First of all, I agree that he is unlikely to hit this magical 30 year old wall and I can't wait to throw it in the face of all the doubters (how anyone can still doubt the guy is beyond me but that's another story). Anyway, I think saying we'd be fucked is taking it too far. Almost all of our significant talent is on rookie deals. By the time we need to start doling out big paydays to guys like Rhodes, Bridgewater, etc. Peterson's contract will either be gone or be in its last year. It's not like we're tying up $15 million a year for the next five years."

nfl,3e2h5e,Puckfan21,6,Tue Jul 21 15:55:01 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS  Let me start by saying, the movie wasn't atrocious...just the last couple of deals became increasingly more unrealistic.    They trade their first (7) and the next two years worth of firsts for the 1 pick.    So this was realistic enough as it was largely molded on the RGIII trade.    They then trade their second and next two years worth of seconds for the 6 pick.   So this is where things get ""questionable."" I mean, Bill Belichick probably takes that deal just because he loves to trade down (3 seconds for my first?? DEAL, DEAL!!!!!). But the idea that the (jaguars?) new GM was all flustered at a couple guys dropping....and needed time to regroup....This is a bit of a stretch...but I get it..it's a movie. You need a protagonist. It isn't totally unrealistic someone would take 3 second rounders for 1 first rounder. The compensation is a little low, but not so horribly bad that it's beyond unbelievable.    They trade that six pick for the 7 pick plus their original next two first round picks and a punt returner   This was just silly. There is NO way Seattle gives back all those picks..and the returner. There just isn't. Pretend you're Seattle and just acquired the browns next 3 first round picks...Then with that #1 pick, The browns don't take the QB?   Later, they get rid of their next 3 second round picks to move one spot ahead of Seattle.  Let's pretend you are Seattle. The brows have no first picks for the next 2 years (they used the first overall on the LB), and no second round picks for the next 3 years. They are sitting at #6 threatening to take the QB, they just passed on. They know have had 2 opportunities to take him (if you ignore the pre-draft conversations), but they still won't take him???  What do you do?   You call their bluff. If they want the QB, they've just mortgaged the next 3 years on one LB and one QB. Good luck building a team with no first or second round picks the next two years.   And if the browns don't want the QB (which they have shown they don't...TWICE), they've just mortgaged their future and you (SEA) still got the QB you wanted, and you still have 3 years of first round picks, and your punt returner.   I know I am pretty smart.... but I should not be the smartest GM in the room."

nfl,3e2h5e,zeek0us,9,Tue Jul 21 14:29:50 2015 UTC,"The Grossi article referenced by TheScore:   One and done: The departure of Dr. Jamil Northcutt as Browns director of player engagement after 15 months won’t make a ripple with their football-starved fan base.  Northcutt was a nonentity to fans. A former college linebacker at the University of Mississippi, he didn’t make (or miss) a tackle, or directly influence what happened on game days.  But in the politics of Browns football, Northcutt was an inordinately major “player” in the 2014 season – a confidante of GM Ray Farmer and, it turned out, a thorn in the side of Mike Pettine’s coaching staff.  And Northcutt’s ouster – which the club is characterizing as a mutual parting – reflects a seeping rift between Pettine and the GM who is facing a four-game suspension for breaking NFL rules by texting, and badgering, coaches in the press box booth during games.  On game days, Northcutt had an undefined role on the sideline. Sources have told ESPN Cleveland that Northcutt was a recipient of Farmer’s in-game texting, and that he relayed messages from Farmer to the coaches. Another source said that was absolutely false.  There is a story of Northcutt having a confrontation with defensive coordinator Jim O’Neil during that horrible 23-7 loss to the Houston Texans on Nov. 16, in which nondescript Houston running backs Alfred Blue and Jonathan Grimes combined for 49 carries and 210 yards on the ground. O’Neil did not take kindly to Northcutt’s intrusion during the difficult day, sources said.  That unexpected loss, with the Browns sitting atop the AFC North at 6-3, was the beginning of the end of the 2014 season.  There is also a story of Northcutt having a “conversation” with offensive line coach Andy Moeller concerning the non-use of reserve guard Vinston Painter after the injury to center Alex Mack. According to a source, that was outside the boundaries of Northcutt’s job description.  The doctor is in: The position of “director of player engagement” or “director of player programs” continues to evolve with NFL teams. The job entails assisting players, particularly incoming rookies, in making the transition to life in the NFL and life after the NFL.  Mundane tasks like scheduling visits to the Ohio DMV and lining up real estate agents coincide with regular meetings to educate players on financial traps and NFL substance abuse and personal conduct policies. The position of “director of player engagement” has become a season-long extension of the ever-enlarging NFL Rookie Symposium program.  Many teams fill the position with former players, who have “been there, done that.” When Farmer replaced former Browns tight end Aaron Shea with Northcutt, he termed Northcutt’s appointment “a very important hire.”  Northcutt held three college degrees from Mississippi, including a doctorate in higher education earned in 2013.  Northcutt came to the Browns after six years as assistant athletics director for internal operations at Mississippi. Before that, he was with the Kansas City Chiefs as player development coordinator while Farmer was director of pro personnel director with the Chiefs.  While Northcutt was eminently qualified to deal with “player engagement,” the team had an unusually difficult year keeping some players “engaged” in their jobs.  Northcutt inherited the serially suspended Josh Gordon. But three rookies had particular trouble adapting from college life to the demands and challenges of professional football – cornerback Justin Gilbert, quarterback Johnny Manziel and running back Terrance West.  It may be unfair to tag Northcutt with the respective transgressions of the three rookies. Then again, it’s hard to recall a Browns’ rookie class that had more high-profile knuckleheadedness.  Going forward: I’m not saying that Northcutt’s departure represents a turning point in the relationship between Farmer and Pettine. Actually, that occurred when Farmer texted coaches in the booth during games, which was counter-productive to the team’s ability to win and compromised Farmer’s credibility with the coaches and, to a degree, the players.  But Northcutt’s departure is not insignificant, either.  Neither Farmer nor Pettine have the job security under owner Jimmy Haslam to pull a power play. In a way, each still needs the other to succeed.  But the tug of war appears to be on."
nfl,3e2h5e,giannini1222,11,Tue Jul 21 14:44:33 2015 UTC,"Northcutt inherited the serially suspended Josh Gordon. But three rookies had particular trouble adapting from college life to the demands and challenges of professional football – cornerback Justin Gilbert, quarterback Johnny Manziel and running back Terrance West.  It may be unfair to tag Northcutt with the respective transgressions of the three rookies. Then again, it’s hard to recall a Browns’ rookie class that had more high-profile knuckleheadedness.   It's 4 players. All you had to do was keep Gordon, Manziel, Gilbert, and West (if you count being awful at Instagram being a high-profile knucklehead) in check out of 50 some other guys who had their shit straight. If you can't keep even one out of 4 guys from not being morons, then yeah, you're not doing your job. Furthermore, Manziel had to go fix himself, West and Gilbert seem to be working behind the scenes, and Gordon had to go to Randy Moss, none of which seems to have direct team influence so much as it had direct player influence (ex. Haden going to Manziel and Gilbert).  So yeah, he failed. He was fired. I don't understand how that indicates a power struggle? Yes, you had characters, but it's your job to keep those characters in check."
nfl,3e2h5e,randalflagg,0,Tue Jul 21 14:46:21 2015 UTC,"That's some really good writing. Mostly hearsay but still at least interesting and paints a story. One would think one of Pettine and Farmer already has the upper hand with haslam, but I guess the other might be gone already if this were the case."
nfl,3e2h5e,sgSaysR,8,Tue Jul 21 14:53:30 2015 UTC,"No, that's some really shitty writing, which is par for the course for Grossi.  The ""mostly hearsay"" is point is the key.  The dude is generally full of shit, and likes to stir the pot with his dramatizations."

The timing of this is suspect."
nfl,3e2h5e,Brokewood,21,Tue Jul 21 15:13:41 2015 UTC,Just another Tony Grossi clickbait article. There's a reason he got fired as the Brown's beatwriter. Constantly making stuff up for attention.

nfl,3e2h5e,zeitfalle,3,Tue Jul 21 14:08:36 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely guarded against that too. Still, I have a hard time believing Brady put together some elaborate cheating scandal for a few tenths of PSI, so I find it nearly impossible a GM would risk this type of punishment to ask players what kind of pizza they want after the game... Is this punishment viewed as fair or over-reactionary?"
nfl,3e2h5e,Earl51,5,Tue Jul 21 16:38:10 2015 UTC,"Question.  Why do so many deflategate detractors keep saying it was only ""a few tenths of PSI""?  Wasn't it 1.5-2 PSI lower than average for most balls?"
nfl,3e2h5e,Resident_Wizard,2,Tue Jul 21 16:58:15 2015 UTC,"Here yea go!   What is the consequence of rejecting Anderson’s statement that he used the Logo gauge pre-game? The Ideal Gas Law, according to the League’s consultants, establishes that the psi of the Patriots footballs at halftime would have been 11.32 to 11.52 due solely to the temperature impact on the footballs. (pg. 113). With the Logo gauge, 8 of the 11 Patriots footballs are in the Ideal Gas Law range and the average of all 11 Patriots footballs was 11.49 — fully consistent with the Ideal Gas Law’s prediction of exactly what that psi would be. THAT IS, RELYING ON MR. ANDERSON’S BEST RECOLLECTIONS, BASIC SCIENCE FULLY EXPLAINS THE DROP IN PSI OF THE PATRIOTS FOOTBALLS DURING THE FIRST HALF."
nfl,3e2h5e,wongo,4,Tue Jul 21 17:46:51 2015 UTC,"So, the end of the article is the most important piece.    Apparently, this dude failed to do his job properly as three rookies failed to adjust to the pros well.    Maybe thats why he got fired?"
nfl,3e2h5e,Oedipustrexeliot,3,Tue Jul 21 13:54:46 2015 UTC,Wait is that logic you're using? Stop that right now. I'll have none of that here!
nfl,3e2h5e,godtogblandet,3,Tue Jul 21 16:12:44 2015 UTC,"Initial reaction is this guy, Northcutt, who got fired failed to understand who his immediate boss was. If he's going against Pettine's wishes or pushing his buttons all in the name of the GM of course he's going to be released.   I think Farmer is learning boundaries for his role and took a large penalty for not understanding them early on.  On a large scale the report is junk and makes the same inference that could have been made when the whole texting thing came to light."

They won ten games, and in the NFL that's always an achievement.  But that year was the year that the AFC North was matched against the AFC East and NFC West, two terrible divisions (with the exception of the strong Patriots and the adequate Seahawks).  Moreover, the Bengals were having issues, and the Ravens had entered a terminal powerdive that would end Steve McNair and Brian Billick's careers.  The next year, they had two of the better divisions in football in the AFC South and NFC East, as well as a Baltimore team that had magically put itself back together over the offseason, making the division much more difficult.  But yeah, even though I can understand why it happened, that doesn't make the next season any less devastating to Browns fans."

Johnny Unitas was hurt in the preseason in 1968, but Morrall led the Colts to a 13-1 record, won MVP, and made it to the Super Bowl. Unfortunately for Morrall, you probably remember that SB more for a certain promise Joe Namath made.  Two years later Unitas was again injured, this time in the middle of a game, but Morrall came in to lead a come from behind victory over the Cowboys. In Super Bowl V.  A couple years later he was cut and ended up on another team as a backup. The starter got hurt in Week 5, but Morrall stepped up again and led the team to 11 straight wins before the starter came back for the playoffs.

nfl,3e2azz,Shart_Film,19,Tue Jul 21 14:02:34 2015 UTC,This always makes me wonder how many TDs Brady could have thrown against the Titans in 2009. He threw 5 in the second quarter and was pulled after he threw his 6th in the first series of the second half.   Although he probably didnt need to start the second half of that game...
nfl,3e2azz,fatheadbob,17,Tue Jul 21 13:47:48 2015 UTC,"By that example, should Matt Flynn's game against the Lions in the final week of the 2011 season count?  In the eyes of certain fans, that game proved that Peyton was the real NFL MVP for 2011 despite not playing a game."
nfl,3e2azz,JudasZala,11,Tue Jul 21 13:54:13 2015 UTC,"I would count it as a fluke game, that somehow earned him a starting job, which he then lost. I think the whole 2011 Peyton MVP idea is completely stupid. You cannot win the MVP award if you don't play a game."

nfl,3e2azz,opeth10657,12,Tue Jul 21 14:07:24 2015 UTC,Well the Lions had Orlovsky as their QB in 2008 and didn't win a single goddamn game.  This included one moment where Orlovsky ran out the back of his own end zone in a game the Lions lost by two.
nfl,3e2azz,DealerCamel,4,Tue Jul 21 15:09:12 2015 UTC,And that team was entirely built on the QB being a HOF QB. Most QBs would have done poorly there
nfl,3e2azz,Lystrodom,3,Tue Jul 21 15:04:27 2015 UTC,And those certain fans are idiots then.
nfl,3e2azz,abmmm,30,Tue Jul 21 15:32:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that was a fluke as much as it was a fantastic supporting cast in an offense that inflates stats. I think Foles would have similar numbers in that situation every time. Best RB, O-line, and deep threat in the league that year with Chip Kelly running the offense.  I feel so hypocritical saying this considering how much I thought Fole was elite talent not so long ago...but any QB with a pocket presence, solid accuracy, and the ability to make basic progressions could've did what Foles did in '13."
nfl,3e2azz,momsbasement420,13,Tue Jul 21 13:21:26 2015 UTC,"That being said, a lot of quarterbacks struggle to do just that. Nick did it at a high rate with great decision making that year, not to force passes. Even last year he was a pretty solid quarterback before going down."

nfl,3e2azz,GoldenSpikes,6,Tue Jul 21 14:41:11 2015 UTC,"Having watched a lot of analysis on Foles from last season he very often was running from ghosts. He would backpedal and hold on to the ball too long even when not pressured. Everyone likes to put his struggles last season on the o-line but a lot of his issues where self inflicted.

I get that the FA QB market is what it is, but it shocks me how many Browns fans are legitimately excited for McCown. The guy got straight outplayed by Mike Glennon."
nfl,3e2azz,BlindWillieJohnson,4,Tue Jul 21 14:18:25 2015 UTC,That shouldn't be a knock on Glennon though. Glennon was a serviceable QB his rookie year. Pretty decent numbers he put up. I have no clue why Lovie started McCown over him.

nfl,3e2azz,BlindWillieJohnson,15,Tue Jul 21 18:27:05 2015 UTC,Agreed... And people in Chicago are still wondering why we didn't re-sign him and cut Cutler.  Outlier..

nfl,3e2azz,clyde_drexler,64,Tue Jul 21 13:09:14 2015 UTC,"I think that can be explained by his neck injury though. I don't think he would have been a top back in the NFL, but at least a good RB."
nfl,3e2azz,jfoster15,19,Tue Jul 21 13:37:46 2015 UTC,Houston also had him bulk up by about 15-20 lbs to be more of an every down back and he lost his speed because of it.

nfl,3e2azz,Rpm1080,42,Tue Jul 21 15:34:38 2015 UTC,"In retrospect, CJ Spiller's 2012 season seems like a statistical high. It's hard to tell for sure though because of how often the guy's been injured in his career, not to mention that the general consensus is that he was utilized in the wrong ways later in his Buffalo career.  I loved watching him play though, so I'm hoping he finds some success with the Saints."
nfl,3e2azz,Daron720,9,Tue Jul 21 13:18:34 2015 UTC,I really hope he can return to form like that in new Orleans. He's such a fun player to watch.

nfl,3e2azz,Puldalpha,20,Tue Jul 21 14:08:39 2015 UTC,Give me a break. I'm tired of hearing the excuses for ML. Fact of the matter is he got paid for the outlier season and never was as good of a player as he could have been.

He was a decent enough player, but not a close to 20 sacks guy.   Then I thought Connor Barwin's 2014 had a similar vibe. Not that he's a bad player or anything.

nfl,3e2azz,thabe331,11,Tue Jul 21 13:04:26 2015 UTC,"Although he directly contributed and was probably the #1 reason for the wins, his stats are absolutely garbage. 12TD:13INT, 51% completion percentage, 5 fumbles. On the ground he went for almost 600 yards and had 7TDs but another 6 fumbles.  Quite the strange stat shit. I think he could easily keep those identical numbers up but the success he had with the team would be quite different."
nfl,3e2azz,full_fire,5,Tue Jul 21 13:22:47 2015 UTC,I always remember that game winning drive he had with all the 4th down conversions as being great. I went back and watched it a little while ago and man was it awful. He got bailed out on nearly every throw.

nfl,3e2azz,chrisbechicken,21,Tue Jul 21 15:04:19 2015 UTC,Justin Forsett's season last year was kind of a fluke.
nfl,3e2azz,keithcoleslaw,34,Tue Jul 21 14:02:14 2015 UTC,It's hard to call it a fluke without seeing what he does in the future. It may be the start of something great for him.
nfl,3e2azz,xboxonelosty,18,Tue Jul 21 14:22:28 2015 UTC,"He is already 30, I just don't see him having a lot of great seasons after this past season. He produced last year but the years before that he never really produced."
nfl,3e2azz,keithcoleslaw,8,Tue Jul 21 14:30:02 2015 UTC,"I think Forsett can still produce in a big way. Over his 6 seasons in the league, he averaged 97 rushing attempts per season. Compare that to someone like AP who has averaged 256 per season. Being 30 has always had a ""doomsday"" feel for RB's, but Forsett has much more tread left on the tires than other RB's in the league that are 3-4 years younger.  Also, the Ravens picked up Trestman as their OC. I'm not sure how much Baltimore followed the Bears the last two seasons, but Forte was a (underrated) monster. He also broke the all-time NFL single season record for receptions by a RB.  Forsett seems to be able to catch out of the backfield well and caught 44 passes last season. He's now the undisputed #1 RB on the team and should see even more touches."
nfl,3e2azz,winegums,3,Tue Jul 21 15:12:17 2015 UTC,"He was never a starter in the past either. I think he can still contribute for a few more years. Either way, I wouldn't call him a fluke yet. He may turn out to be one though."
nfl,3e2azz,xboxonelosty,5,Tue Jul 21 14:32:37 2015 UTC,Do you think he will fall off the map this year?
nfl,3e2azz,wafflestoompa,7,Tue Jul 21 14:17:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think he will be completely done, but I don't think he will produce anywhere near what he did last year. I think either Lorenzo or Javorius will take away a lot of his carries by the end of the season."
nfl,3e2azz,keithcoleslaw,5,Tue Jul 21 14:22:57 2015 UTC,"Really? I feel like Lorenzo has had his shot, plus with that new contract for Forsett?"
nfl,3e2azz,SwedishLovePump,5,Tue Jul 21 14:36:03 2015 UTC,"I think it's all Forsett. He was incredible last year. Like Sproles, Forsett is small enough to find holes that others wouldn't be able to sniff out. Watching him run between the tackles is like watching the Millenium Falcon bursting out of the Death Star at the end of Jedi - you think he's been nabbed then he just pops out. I think he still has two years left of very solid production, despite his age."
nfl,3e2azz,_Alvin_Row_,6,Tue Jul 21 15:04:01 2015 UTC,"Christian Okoye was the first name that came to my mind, but I dunno how flukey that was.  Mark Rypien in 1991 may be the true right answer."

nfl,3e3284,Maad-Dog,8,Tue Jul 21 17:34:03 2015 UTC,"Lol same. This is actually where I have Stafford in my rankings. I feel like they're kinda disrespecting Kaep though, IMO he's in the same tier as Cam and Stafford."
nfl,3e3284,Novh,5,Tue Jul 21 17:32:15 2015 UTC,"Media really likes their extremes with Kaep. The season after the Super Bowl he was going to be the best QB ever, now they think he's a bum. I'd put him in this tier."
nfl,3e3284,streetxmanifesto,3,Tue Jul 21 17:43:28 2015 UTC,"He's declined (at least statistically) each of the past two years, so that's not surprising to see him get a worse rap now then when he was taking the league by storm.  The good news for him is that there are examples of successful QBs with early career slumps."
nfl,3e3284,rhadamanthus52,40,Tue Jul 21 18:14:28 2015 UTC,"Of course Wilson goes over Romo. Clearly this is about who you would rather have going forward as opposed to one year. Wilson is a solid top 10 with no major injuries. Romo is a solid top 10 held together with duct tape.  Otherwise, how else could you explain Andrew Luck being a good 3 spots higher than he should be?"
nfl,3e3284,Terrell2,10,Tue Jul 21 16:33:42 2015 UTC,"That's actually an excellent point. I feel everybody is half-surprised when Romo (or even Ben) is ""still able to"" perform at such a high level, whereas Luck has been exceeding already high expectations every year."
nfl,3e3284,zk3033,4,Tue Jul 21 17:40:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The Cowboys lost Murray, and the Seahawks added Graham. Romo may have been a better passer than Wilson in 2014, but it seems like the point of the article is who will be at the top next year. I don't think it's a total stretch to put Wilson over Romo in that context."
nfl,3e3284,nohipstersallowed,6,Tue Jul 21 17:48:52 2015 UTC,"Wilson got Graham, but the Cowboys still have Dez, Witten, Williams, Beasely and the OL.  Losing Murray stings but I still think the Cowboys are setup for a better passing game than the Seahawks."
nfl,3e3284,CrownReserve,4,Tue Jul 21 18:12:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure. I think there was some forward thinking, but it looks like this mostly reflects what these evaluators thought of the QBs now, or what they think they will be this year. I don't think the evaluators took this as a medium or long term projection ranking.  If this was about which QB you wanted going forward Luck would be #1 or #2 and Brady would be a few spots lower just based on age and likely years left in the tank.  I think many league insiders just value Luck higher than the rest of us. Here is a quote from the start of the article:   The 35th and final insider, a longtime defensive coordinator, could not believe it when I told him five of the previous 34 had left Andrew Luck outside the top tier on their ballots. ""Those five guys didn't play against him. He is a 1, I am telling you. He is f------ good. Nobody blocks anybody up front, and he is still good."""
nfl,3e3284,rhadamanthus52,4,Tue Jul 21 18:21:01 2015 UTC,"i don't think it's only about who you'd rather have going forward. otherwise, peyton wouldn't be in tier 1 because his ""going forward"" is almost certainly just one year. no coach or GM is going to take that over having any QB in T2 for the next 5-10 years."

nfl,3e3284,Yji,8,Tue Jul 21 16:11:56 2015 UTC,"Geno should be ahead of Matt Cassel. But then, given the rumors from Buffalo's training camp, so should E.J. Manuel and Tyrod Taylor."

nfl,3e3284,ocyries,77,Tue Jul 21 17:37:50 2015 UTC,"Big Ben should be above Luck IMO. Had an incredible season last year, and I think he could be in the running for MVP this year. Also, two rookies being on the list at all is stupid. Camp hasn't even started yet, and they're already in the mid 20's?"
nfl,3e3284,Suddenly_Something,8,Tue Jul 21 16:16:56 2015 UTC,I'm really happy to see Ben in that Tier 1. His year last year was absolutely nuts. Leads the league in passing yards while also maintaining a great 32-9 TD-INT ratio. He also had the third highest comp % in the league last year only behind Romo and Brees. Ben had an absolute monster of a year.
nfl,3e3284,Juventus19,5,Tue Jul 21 16:30:41 2015 UTC,"Even though i will never forgive the steelers for robing my dearest warner from riding off into the sunset with another championship, i have to say Ben has always been a great qb and its a shame that most people overlook him when talking about our generations great qb's. You would think his multiple rings would carry more weight."
nfl,3e3284,Big_douche,5,Tue Jul 21 17:08:57 2015 UTC,Yea he is criminally underrated. Dude has been behind some putrid offensive lines in his career and just he keeps on chugging along. Glad to see my homerism isn't totally blinding me.
nfl,3e3284,Juventus19,5,Tue Jul 21 17:46:59 2015 UTC,I don't know if he's criminally underrated. More overshadowed by Rodgers/Brady/Manning/Brees. We're in a pretty fantastic era for quarterbacking.

nfl,3e3284,cooleymahn,5,Tue Jul 21 17:50:22 2015 UTC,honestly besides the obvious top guy/guys (brady/rodgers) it's really hard to pick and choose between the next group of guys who is better than who. They all do things great and some of them do some things better. Its hard to compare players in a vacuum and say one is really better than the other because football is a team driven/dependent sport.
nfl,3e3284,Big_douche,38,Tue Jul 21 17:06:36 2015 UTC,"Big Ben should be above Luck   This really shouldn't be debatable. Ben, Brees, Rivers, Romo...they all should be higher than Luck"

nfl,3e3284,royhibbertnicekisser,23,Tue Jul 21 17:37:29 2015 UTC,Sorry but what exactly have Rivers and Romo accomplished that Luck hasn't?
nfl,3e3284,joeroknows,18,Tue Jul 21 16:50:49 2015 UTC,"longevity, they been great qb's for much longer. Rivers has been the qb of a #1 ranked offense.  Romo was able to go from an undrafted nobody to the starter of the cowboys with one of the highest career passer ratings. So they have accomplished a fair bit."
nfl,3e3284,Big_douche,13,Tue Jul 21 17:14:54 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what pisses me off about rankings that QBs with longevity are ranked below QBs who have had a few good seasons. I mean in the long run luck will probably be in the talks among Peyton, Brady, Rodgers and Brees but as of right now he should be way lower."
nfl,3e3284,rob_var,47,Tue Jul 21 17:22:43 2015 UTC,Romo - 9 straight seasons with a Qb rating between 90 - 116 and 5/6 of the last seasons with 10 or fewer INTs  Rivers - 7 straight seasons with a QB rating between 88 - 106  both have 2+ seasons with a QB rating over 100 (Rivers has 4)  Luck's accomplishments: 1 good season with a 96 QB rating and 24 total INT/Fumbles
nfl,3e3284,MoveIsCostingMe,14,Tue Jul 21 17:14:33 2015 UTC,"I think age plays against Romo, Ben, and Rivers, in a way that it doesn't against Luck. Sooner rather than later, the first three guys are going to fall off a cliff, whereas traditional QB dating has Luck just entering his prime."
nfl,3e3284,slash196,9,Tue Jul 21 17:40:08 2015 UTC,"If this was truly about age and upside, Tannehill would be above Palmer."
nfl,3e3284,oberstofsunshine,7,Tue Jul 21 17:51:13 2015 UTC,"Well, clearly it's not JUST age and upside, obviously past performance AND team success have been factored in. I mean, we say ""NFL Coaches/Evaluators"" but most of them probably haven't watched any of these guys in much detail. I probably know more about Andrew Luck than half of them."
nfl,3e3284,slash196,3,Tue Jul 21 17:54:54 2015 UTC,"It's not a keeper league rating system taking the next five years into account (is it?), it's a ranking for this season."
nfl,3e3284,zag83,3,Tue Jul 21 18:07:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but given that it's a prediction, they all have an age risk that Luck doesn't have. Will they ALL certainly fall off next season? Almost surely not. But individually there is a non-negligible risk that they'll have the last season of their careers next year."
nfl,3e3284,slash196,2,Tue Jul 21 18:08:39 2015 UTC,He's definitely less injury prone being younger but everyone in the NFL is susceptible to injury. I don't think he deserves to be put ahead of those guys based on what could happen to them.

nfl,3e3284,Dharma_Lion,6,Tue Jul 21 17:39:12 2015 UTC,"But that's what I'm saying. He had one of the best seasons of any QB last year.

nfl,3e3284,jlacomb17,2,Tue Jul 21 17:36:43 2015 UTC,"Last year he was statistically the best QB in the league (passer rating and QBR if you like that stuff). I don't know how you can say that Russel Wilson or Philip Rivers are better than him.   With the way that teams are set up, I believe he deserves Brees' spot at #6. Or you know, just take Luck out of the top 6 and have Romo at #6 and Brees at #5 or the other way around."
nfl,3e3284,Deified,4,Tue Jul 21 17:38:29 2015 UTC,"Just me, but Luck played behind a pretty abysmal line, with limited RB support, and while TY is likely an above-average WR1, he's no Dez Bryant.  You put Luck on that Dallas offense and, well, I think it's an upgrade even before you account for Romo's health issues."
nfl,3e3284,fairly_legal,3,Tue Jul 21 18:03:13 2015 UTC,"Last year he was statistically the best QB in the league (passer rating and QBR if you like that stuff). I don't know how you can say that Russel Wilson or Philip Rivers are better than him.   But that's just one year. Since 2012, when Wilson came into the league:   Passser rating: Romo 99.5, Wilson 98.5 Passing Y/A: Romo 7.8, Wilson 8.1 Rushing Y/A: Romo 2.6 (4 yards/game), Wilson 6.4 (31 yards/game)   They are about equal as passers, despite Romo having way better receivers / offensive line, while Wilson is a way better rusher, is younger, and has been healthier.

This is the part that I think is funny b/c it is apparently very accurate, yet so misinformed at the same time.   His .500 winning percentage in those games (16-16 record) is best in the league over that span among those 11 quarterbacks.   So, in reality 50-50 is actually quite a compliment, but apparently that person doesn't realize it."

His yards, yards/attempt, TDs and TD% have all gone down the last 4 years. He still puts up big numbers but I feel like that has mostly been due to having such high numbers of attempts every year. I'm not saying he's not good. I just don't think he's as good as he was 4-5 years ago and Rivers, Romo and Wilson are all probably ahead of him IMO."
nfl,3e3284,benjarmb,2,Tue Jul 21 17:43:22 2015 UTC,"He's been in the 650-670 range the past 5 years, so I'm not sure what has really changed.   He's an elite QB so the ball is in his hands a lot, and it's there often because when he has a bad defense, or you know the worst in NFL history in 2012, he is playing from behind a lot.     It should be expected that his stats will fall, since he has been putting up all-time numbers on offense.   His stats from last year are still better than most in the league.  I don't see how being tied for 1st in passing and 6th in touchdowns means he isn't elite, but I'm probably biased"

Nope, not happening.  I like the Rivers and Wilson ranking, until I realized that Romo was below them, he should be #5 or #6 around Big ben and Luck.  Ryan > Flacco, but that's minor.  Palmer is too high, he's had too many injuries for that, Tannehill and Kaepernick are both way too low, Kaepernick the same as Dalton are you kidding me? Both Tanny and Kaep should be above Smith and Palmer.  Carr is way too high as well, he should be around Bridgewater's level.  This is probably one of the worst lists I've seen/."

If you want to hold that against him, particularly going into next year, then it is easy to understand his low ranking. A lot of people, myself included, don't believe Peyton can play a full year of football anymore.   While I feel Rivers, Romo, and Brees and Big Ben all clearly played better than Andrew Luck did last year, and will out perform him this year also. Romo, Big Ben, and Rivers were all in contention for MVP at one point or another, and Drew Brees even in a bad year is better than almost everyone else.   Luck makes a lot of amazing plays and wins his team a lot of games, but Romo, Rivers, Brees and Big Ben do that too. Generally against better teams, and make less mistakes when doing so"

I'd rather see Ryan above both or below both (and IMO it's slightly above both).  Overall though I'm not liking this overwhelming consensus I'm seeing that constantly puts Flacco above Eli.  It just makes me feel that people think there is a giant disparity between them that doesn't exist.  Eli having another strong year in this offense should help correct that and the overall perception of him in general.

Luck's TD% gap is actually larger than the gap between their interception percentages (6.5-5.3 to 2.6-1.5). I don't disagree that Ben performed better overall, but he didn't beat Luck in literally every way. Ben also had one of the best running backs and receivers in the league, whereas Luck had Trent Richardson taking pressure off of him.  Again, I think Ben played better but I can see why the experts like Luck above him going into next year with a running back and a lot of weapons and considering Luck has done nothing but improve his passer rating every year since he's been in the league."

First weekend I was there, I woke up at around 9 and turned on the TV, all excited for football.  Church.  I was like ""The fuck? Maybe Fox doesn't have a morning game today."" So I changed to CBS.  Church.  Fuuuuuuuu.  Waiting until 1PM for football is stupid. Even worse is night games not ending until like 11PM."

nfl,3e34ix,Dent18,8,Tue Jul 21 17:23:36 2015 UTC,"I love living on the West Coast. It's great for football ending around 8 on Sundays, then I can watch The Good Wife.   Football at 10 am is also awesome, I wake up around 9, smoke a bowl while checking my fantasy lineups and then I'm ready to go at 10.   I feel badly for my friends here who go to church, I play cribbage with a guy who is from Michigan and he's a Lions fan and he has to DVR every game because he goes to church on Sunday mornings.   Another good thing about the West Coast is that most of the Raider games are in the afternoon, so I can watch Red Zone in the mornings (and watch my fantasy scores) and then have the Raiders in the afternoon, it's a great routine."

I really feel like the only reason stadiums are so expensive is because they can be.  If the taxpayers stopped chipping in they'd magically get a lot cheaper to build.

Had he tried to build it in Boston, that stadium would've been much more in-line with numbers you see for every other stadium, just on property value alone. As it is, Kraft only asked the city for a few upgrades in infrastructure to help traffic flow to the stadium.   Gillette Stadium was also opened 13 years ago - the same year as CenturyLink Field in Seattle (which cost $430 million), Ford Field in Detroit ($430 million) and NRG Stadium in Houston ($352 million) - so it's not as much of a shining example of ""stadium frugality"" as you might think when you look at the other stadiums that opened that year, teams just weren't spending stupid money on stadiums yet."

I say ""almost"" because, while the Kroenke stadium plan is 100% private money, they are seeking some tax reimbursements for some of the gameday ""public services"" (shuttles, police and fire, etc). But we're still talking small amounts compared to the cost of the stadium complex.  Likewise, the Carson stadium plan is entirely privately financed.  On a similar note, Levi's Stadium was ~90% privately financed. The city of Santa Clara kicked in $114 million on the $1.3 billion stadium."

Just look at the Packers.  Their operating revenue for last season was damn near $400 million.  These teams are not operating paycheck to paycheck.  I can guarantee you most teams can build a $750 million+ stadium and have it paid off well before 10 years is up.  Without pulling a single dime from taxpayers pockets."

Let's say total profit per year is ""only"" $50M. Sure stadiums would be more difficult to afford.

Billionaires don't buy teams because they aren't extremely profitable."
nfl,3e02oz,sicknarlo,5,Tue Jul 21 02:57:46 2015 UTC,"Billionaires don't buy teams because they aren't extremely profitable.   One of the main reasons to buy a sports franchise, which we've seen play out several times recently, particularly in the NBA, isn't to pocket the annual profit, but to hold an appreciating asset. Even if you ""only"" make $50 million a year (which the Packers are expected to have made in 2014 and is also a record for the franchise), it doesn't matter if you can sell it 5-10 years down the road for double what you paid.   In 2008, Stephen Ross paid $1.1 billion for the Dolphins. Last year, Terry Pegula paid $1.4 billion to purchase the Bills (currently the record sale price for an NFL team) and two years prior, Jimmy Haslam bought the Browns for more than $1 billion. In 2014, Forbes valued the Dolphins at $1.3 billion. You can bet that a team in Miami, one of the top 10 markets in the country, will sell for much more than the Bills, which are one of the smallest markets in the NFL, and the Browns.  The Bills sold at about a 40% premium to their Forbes valuation (which at the time was about $935 million). Let's do a hypothetical and say that Ross sells the Fins at the end of this season, and we'll also assume he made an average of $8 million each year (the supposed operating income of the team in 2013, far below $50 million). Under that assumption, he only made $64 million in income over the 8 seasons he owned the team, but if he sells his team at a 25% premium to the club's current valuation (just to be conservative), he will make $525 million from the sale to go to his $64 million in operating income (which assumes he doesn't pay himself a salary and pockets all the OI), for a nice $589 million profit. And that's being conservative. In reality, the Dolphins would likely fetch close to, if not more than, $2 billion."

nfl,3e02oz,hoponthe,109,Tue Jul 21 02:51:35 2015 UTC,"It's pretty universally agreed upon that new stadiums have little to no positive economic impact.   Quote from this article:   Coates' study, released in 2003, reports that ""economists have found no evidence of positive economic impact of professional sports teams and facilities on urban economies.""  ""These results suggest at best (that) professional sports teams and facilities provide non-pecuniary benefits like civic pride and a greater sense of community, along with consumption benefits to those attending games and following the local team in the media; at worst, residents of cities with professional sports teams pay a high cost for the privilege, both in terms of large public subsidies and in terms of lost income and employment,"" Coates concluded.   The opening of this article:   There are a lot of things economists disagree about, but the economic impact of sports stadiums is not one of them.  “If you ever had a consensus in economics, this would be it,"" said Michael Leeds, a sports economist at Temple University. ""There is no impact.""  Leeds studied Chicago – as big a sports town as there is – with five major teams.  “If every sports team in Chicago were to suddenly disappear, the impact on the Chicago economy would be a fraction of 1 percent,” said Leeds.  We talk about sports a lot, and we pay a lot attention to them, but when it comes to the actual revenue teams generate, the impact is minuscule.  “A baseball team has about the same impact on a community as a midsize department store,” Leeds said.  That’s for a sport with 80 home games a year. NFL teams only play eight.   One last quote   ""The basic idea is that sports stadiums typically aren't a good tool for economic development,"" said Victor Matheson, an economist at Holy Cross who has studied the economic impact of stadium construction for decades. When cities cite studies (often produced by parties with an interest in building the stadium) touting the impact of such projects, there is a simple rule for determining the actual return on investment, Matheson said: ""Take whatever number the sports promoter says, take it and move the decimal one place to the left. Divide it by ten, and that's a pretty good estimate of the actual economic impact.""   Edit: preemptively answering the question of 'why?' that people may have, adding new stadiums doesn't add new money into local economies. It just redistributes money that was already in the local economy.   Edit 2:  A quote from Forbes:   The upshot from UBS: “Independent academic research studies consistently conclude that new stadiums and arenas have no measurable effect on the level of real income or employment in the metropolitan areas in which they are located. Feasibility studies for professional sports facilities often fail to account for the substitution effect. Individuals generally maintain a consistent level of entertainment spending so money spent on sporting events typically comes at the expense of cash spent in restaurants, on travel, and at movie theaters.”  The UBS study also notes: “…sports crowd out other types of economic activity. The physical infrastructure of a city, whether it’s a private hotel or a public airport, cannot abruptly increase capacity. As a consequence, sports fans tend to displace other visitors. As a case in point, Robert Baade and Victor Matheson at the College of the Holy Cross have examined the number of visitors to Beijing during the Summer Olympics of 2008. Tourist arrivals for the month of August did not fluctuate year-over-year and the number of visitors to Beijing actually declined on an annual basis. Similar results can be found for Olympic Games held in the US and for such sporting events as the Super Bowl.”"
nfl,3e02oz,mrdov,93,Tue Jul 21 04:18:02 2015 UTC,"That's the same argument for hosting FIFA games and the super bowl. The thing is, they ultimately end up having a higher cost than the revenue it brings in.   The NFL is a private business, and as such it's books are closed to the public. Until they demonstrate a need for public funds to build these stadiums, which bring in so much revenue for the public, they should be building their own stadiums.   Edit: a word"
nfl,3e02oz,Dristone,46,Tue Jul 21 03:02:12 2015 UTC,"You're going against tons of research here. The money people spend in the stadiums is entertainment money; if it wasn't going to the NFL it would go to the other things. Stadiums, at best, have a tiny marginal benefit."

Remember it's not just about the money spent.  It's also about the money not spent.  Stadiums and their parking lots are big and tend to occupy a lot of space that could be used to make money in other ways.  You also need to remember that those huge hotel/restaurant/bar pay days happen only 8 times a year in the NFL.  Also, most of the money spent would have been spent in the city some other way anyways.  When you buy a ticket that's just less money you end up spending at the theatre.   20+ thousand people travel to an away game in another city   When does that ever happen?  Super bowl?"

I'm not saying there aren't other operating costs, but teams are making a lot of money."
nfl,3e02oz,theguy_12345,16,Tue Jul 21 02:14:11 2015 UTC,"Player expenses are not just the salary cap.  Players also receive a benefit package that is around 30-40 million a year per team.  In 2013 the Packers expenses for players was 171 million, I haven't seen it broken down yet for their most recent financial report.  Other teams also don't have similar local revenues to the packers.  Last year they were estimated to be 12th in the league in terms of total revenue.  This year they could be even higher as they had an increase of 12.9 million in local revenue due to their new pro shop and stadium expansion."
nfl,3e02oz,Kalanar,6,Tue Jul 21 03:57:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing with the relevant point that benefit packages contribute no small part to player expenses. That  is certainly true and needs to be taken into consideration.  However for anyone looking to estimate the size of this package be careful trying to estimate the number by subtracting the league cap from one year of total player expenses. In a given year almost no team pays out the cap limit due to the way signing bonuses are calculated. This is particularly true for the Packers in 2013 since it was the year they signed Rodgers to a long term deal with a $35M signing bonus. All that money was counted as player expenses for 2013 since it was cash payed on signing, however Rodgers only counted ~$12M against the cap that year due to the way the contract was structured and prorating of signing bonuses. Player expenses were at a local maximum in 2013, and were proportionally lower in 2012 and 2014."
nfl,3e02oz,rhadamanthus52,2,Tue Jul 21 10:08:43 2015 UTC,Would Green Bay be on the lower end due to market size or is that offset by the teams popularity?
nfl,3e02oz,LazyHobo_,4,Tue Jul 21 02:49:03 2015 UTC,"Market size probably impacts TV revenue most, which is the shared portion the NFL distributed. Larger market teams may sell more merchandise, but A) I don't know if that is considered local revenue or not and B) Green Bay is pretty popular nationwide as far as that goes. I would imagine local revenue is mostly ticket sales, concessions, and local sponsorships."
nfl,3e02oz,jimbo831,8,Tue Jul 21 02:56:10 2015 UTC,"I've tried to look into this, but it's difficult to find information on the stadiums true revenue and costs since most of these facilities are privately held.  What I have been able to find at a high level is the following:  Stadium Revenue: $100M (source Forbes - states NFC North teams avg $75M just for for club seats/luxury boxes)  Stadium Naming Rights Revenue : $20M (see 49ers & Cowboys deals w/Levi's & AT&T respectively)  If you divide this into 8 games, it's about $15M per game in revenue.   The Minnesota Vikings  are building a new stadium and have some public documents on the funding and operating expenses  (http://www.vikings.com/assets/docs/stadium/DES-plan.pdf).  If I have read this correctly, it appears the costs to run the stadium are are $3M for the games + $11M annual expenses which equals $1.75M in cost per game.    At this point, $15M revenue (assumes the Vikings stadium will get a similar naming deal as the Cowboys and 49ers) - $2M costs = $13M net  There are some things I can't get many specific details on, but there are also ""accommodations for NCAA basketball, a Super Bowl, amateur baseball, Major League Soccer, concerts, civic,  community and not-for-profit events"" which will provide additional revenue.  I'm sure I'm missing other costs, but it appears the owners are getting a hell of a deal by getting all of this city/state support.  Please feel free to check my math.  BTW, I'm not picking on the Vikings here - it's just the best example of public data I was able to find."
nfl,3e02oz,SoupSandwichTX,9,Tue Jul 21 04:27:02 2015 UTC,"The Vikings won't own the new stadium, it's owned and operated by the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission. Meaning not only do they not profit from other events held there, but they also have to pay a yearly rent of 8.5 million (+3% each year, up to 20 million)."
nfl,3e02oz,nomaam05,3,Tue Jul 21 07:58:59 2015 UTC,"That's the league's revenue, not the teams. This is nearly entirely from media deals done by the NFL and redistributed to the teams."
nfl,3e02oz,mandelboxset,2,Tue Jul 21 02:38:33 2015 UTC,"I thought the profit sharing was 7.24 billion. So that wouldn't be the total teams income. That's just from league wide promotional stuff and TV contracts.   Each team also earns income from local advertising in their stadium, tickets, concessions, merchandise and team sponsorships.   Considering that, it is quite likely that all other sources of revenue could be enough to cover all expenses. Especially when they have a new, publicly funded, stadium.   And even if the NFL has 6.24 billion in expenses every year. They would have been able to pay back ALL those cities in payments of just $235 million every year. Which is less than what Green Bay just got at their share of THIS YEARS profit sharing.   And you can't tell me that running the NFL costs 6.24 Billion every year, so they could have paid it off much faster."

The city looked at it and decided the long term cultural, societal and branding exposure of having a world class facility, NFL team, premier NCAA events and possible Super Bowl outweighed the short term benefit of paving over potholes. I agree with them.  Everyone wants to act like it's purely a dollar and cents game, when it is far from it in reality.

Also, re: education spending, that's a huge, really vague statement. Is that in tax dollars only? Per capita? Because we're a pretty big, pretty rich country. Does it include private education?

It doesn't benefit the city and it hardly benefits the fans (I know myself and many others would take a few less comforts in exchange for far cheaper ticket prices).

Pandering to some 200k  luxury box crowd because they actually see that money is the reason owners want these over the top stadiums so badly, and that is pretty BS that people pay for that reason."
nfl,3e02oz,jkypoo,2,Mon Jul 20 23:12:43 2015 UTC,"I agree the stadium is probably just fine from the average fans perspective.

It's also important to remember that teams specifically want this to be the debate's frame. It's in their best interest for fans to turn on each other because then they won't band together.

And no, they don't threaten to move or increase ticket prices massively. Man, I love football, but I do hate the NFL and what comes with it."
nfl,3e02oz,GoBackToUzbekistan,14,Tue Jul 21 14:28:01 2015 UTC,"I used to be against using public money for stadiums, but as I've gotten older and learned how the world works, I am ok with it.  For starters, this practice is common in all industries.  Apple could call up Oregon right now and ask for money to move their headquarters to Portland, and Oregon would almost definitely offer them a ton of money to pay for the move.  Because bringing Apple to Oregon would bring a lot of jobs, which the state profits from in the form of income and other taxes.  New high skilled workers in the state spend money and buy expensive houses, so more sales tax and property tax as well.  Big win for Oregon.  Apple could then use that offer from Oregon as leverage to get California to pay to build a new office building to stay in California.    This happens ALL THE TIME. For example, Maryland just paid $4M to McCormick (the spice company) to build them a new office complex because the company threatened to move to Pennsylvania.  Maryland realized that it would cost our state more than $4M in lost tax revenue by letting McCormick leave the state.  So the question to ask here is, how much money did those states/counties/cities receive in additional tax revenue that they wouldn't have if they allowed the NFL team to leave the state?  You have to include sales taxes from every ticket, parking pass (many cities add an extra ""entertainment"" tax to things like this) and concession purchased in the stadium.  Plus all the businesses that tend to pop up around the stadium that would otherwise not be there lead to more sales tax, income tax, etc.  Depending where you are, a lot of this extra tax revenue comes from out of state visitors which is even better for the local economy.  The state makes money from taxing the income of all the stadium workers, players, managers, team executives.  Plus the opportunity cost of not having to pay unemployment for some % of the citizens that would otherwise be out of work if not for the jobs provided by having the team in town.  So it sounds bad when you say it like that, but ignoring the revenue that cities get from having NFL teams is not telling the whole story of why cities give teams tax money in the first place.  It's not a charity for billionaire owners.  It's an investment in their own economy.  TL;DR:  The states don't chose to pay for stadiums with tax money because they like football, they do it because in the end it results in MORE money for the local economy than letting the team leave town."
nfl,3e02oz,brandn487,10,Tue Jul 21 12:52:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah but the thing with corporations is that there is an argument to be made that a company staying in a state provides an overall net benefit to everyone in the state. No economic study has ever shown that building stadiums or arenas has yielded a net benefit for a city or state. I think the stadium that considered the closest to being a success in that respect is Camden Yards in Baltimore.   Jobs argument - NFL teams provide very little in the way of high quality jobs. They're not Google or Apple who are likely to provide engineers and programmers, they are closer to Wal-Mart or Target. The majority of the people employed are being paid near minimum wage. You'd probably be better off paying for a Wal-Mart. And don't forget, when cities provide tax credits to corporations, they tend to do it industry wide. The city of Montreal for instance provides tax credits for all video game companies that want to set up shop there. Eidos, EA, Bioware, Ubisoft all have development houses there. You're probably looking at at the very least, a 1000 programmers and engineers combined right there. With sports, you only attract one franchise.   Tourism Dollars - So we'll use the Vikings for this. The city of Minneapolis and the state of Minneapolis combined to spend $500 million to help the Vikings build a new stadium. That means they get 10 weeks guaranteed of pro football - 2 preseason, 8 regular season and maybe another two games in the playoffs. Maybe one year if they're lucky, the NFL might hold a Super Bowl in Minnesota. I can think of a lot better ways of increasing tourism. Especially when you consider that that stadium is not going to be in use past February except for the occasional concert. How does that stadium attract tourists to Minneapolis in the summer when the city is actually a suitable place to vacation?   The other thing to consider is that most of the tourists that visit a city for sports will be paying the majority of their money to the sports franchise. The city gets no cut of the ticket sales and that's the the bulk of the money right there. The travel costs aren't beneficial to the city. A group of buddies might stop into Minneapolis on a Saturday, pay for a night at a hotel. Go to two restaurants, see the Vikings play the Bears and then fuck off back to Chicago on Sunday evening so they don't miss work on Monday. 8 weeks of that is not exactly great use of $500 million. This argument is even more ridiculous when you consider how far out some of these stadiums are from the cities they're supposedly based in.  Tax Revenue - Most cities will never see those gains. You have to provide infrastructure for these stadiums and they often have to hire extra security during game days. Public transit routes etc.  The only reason we give sports a pass is because people take sports way too seriously. Look how countries bend over backwards for FIFA or how the Olympics continually scam cities into going broke. If Lena Dunham suddenly announced tomorrow that she was moving the entire production of the hit show Girls to Jacksonville because Jacksonville gave her $100 million, everybody would be pissed - even fans of the shitty show. As for the taxes gained from the 57 or so millionaires and all the execs, most athletes are taxed differently since they play half their games out of state - and sometimes country. This argument is even more moot if you happen to be in a state with no state taxes like Florida."

nfl,3e2edm,Jurph,4,Tue Jul 21 13:08:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not positive about us using TE-as-FB plays like you're saying. We still have Kyle Juszczyk at FB, and he's a pretty good pass catcher. If I remember correctly, he actually led Harvard in TD receptions his senior year."
nfl,3e2edm,Samuel_L_Jewson,5,Tue Jul 21 15:39:09 2015 UTC,"It would mostly be as misdirection.  You can have the FB chip and go out for a pass, or have the TE pull inside and block for the RB.  Since the TE and FB are both eligible, and both fairly big-bodied guys who can block or catch, you can rotate them around to mess with the defense."
nfl,3e2edm,Jurph,2,Tue Jul 21 15:43:20 2015 UTC,"Fair point. I'm sure we'll have the TE pull inside as well, I'm just saying that we shouldn't count out Juszczyk being involved in that sort of thing."
nfl,3e2edm,Samuel_L_Jewson,12,Tue Jul 21 15:46:28 2015 UTC,Pitta is done if the docs can't clear him now I really do not see him being cleared later.  He really should not be playing anyways best of luck to him and his endeavours because he was amazing in 2012

Do some reading about what actually happened, he lied to police, that's it. His friends, who he testified against as the main witness for the state, were acquitted on the basis of self defense.   Also for the record, two people died in that barfight so saying ""Lewis killed a guy"" is generally a giant neon sign saying you don't know the facts."

And AFTER his public apologies?  I don't get this grudge you've got. Ray Rice turned out to have done a terrible thing, and I wasn't among the people clapping at the preseason game. But I also don't judge the people who were that hard, if I'm being honest."

If he does nothing, he goes to court, the Wells report is not enough in an actual court room since it's filled with ""maybe"" ""probably"" ""we found nothing but 5 mill after we have to fill pages"". My guess is that Goodell and Kraft sort of made a deal to sweep this under the rug (remember Kraft saying he was ok with the decision and was not gonna appeal anything?) but Brady apparently cares too much.   Brady has already stated he will appeal unless he is exonerated. Not to mention this might be Brady's last season and while the case is in court he will be able to play."

It wasn't 4 games because he got some dudes to take a little air out of some equipment, it was 4 games because he intentionally tried to fuck with the investigation.   He tried to hide evidence, told people to lie, refused to cooperate ... all that shit is bad news. If he would have owned up to it right from the start it would not have been nearly as big of a deal.  So how can Goodell fucking let an appeal go through. That's an insane precedent to start. If you let guys who intentionally impede your office trying to get to the truth off, then everyone is going to do it.  Brady should have just been upfront. The coverup is ALWAYS worse than the crime."

The only thing worthy of ""cover up"" status would be that Brady didn't submit his phone for review.  But even then Wells' said he didn't need it as he had the texts from the ball attendant's phones."
nfl,3e398q,icepickjones,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:23:47 2015 UTC,"They can downvote, I don't care. I read the report, I know what it says. The report proved that McNally and Jastremski successfully conspired to  deflate the balls. There's the video evidence and the, ya know, actual balls that are 2-3 psi lower for the Pats than the Colts from the game. That's pretty established. Plus the texts of them talking about doing it and how the needle would be provided.  The texts that sort of implicate Brady and the weird phone records of calling a guy you hardly talk to 12 times in a week because of an investigation are one thing, but really all he had to do was say ""Eh, I like the balls as low to the regulation level as possible"" and walk away but instead he denied it in a blanket statement, said shit didn't matter (the fuck would you say that?), and then got obstinate when they tried to investigate.   It's such a dumb little thing. But I understand why the commissioner's office is going to drop the hammer on someone who thinks they are too big for the game. Brady thought he didn't have to cooperate and stonewalled them when they tried ... that's the only reason he got punished.  Otherwise it was a lot of circumstantial stuff that looped him in, and enough that he could deny, but the Pats organization was going to get hit no matter what."

Then the text messages between McNally and Jastremski talking about over inflating as a joke and McNally calling himself the deflator. And Jastremski saying he will give him a needle to deflate the balls.  And after the game McNally lies baout having taken the balls in the bathroom. Something like that is easy to forget I guess.

Players with his type of on-field reputation have a natural advantage in awards I think.  Not only that but the Vikings could very easily be a playoff team.
nfl,3e2gzk,olig23,76,Tue Jul 21 13:58:59 2015 UTC,I would be fucking stunned if they even consider giving MVP to AP.
nfl,3e2gzk,Dogdude351,35,Tue Jul 21 14:04:19 2015 UTC,"Even if he has a 2000+, 15+ TD type of season in which the Vikings surprisingly win their division thanks to a strong ground game?

nfl,3e2gzk,AquaPrison,14,Tue Jul 21 14:30:28 2015 UTC,"He would have to break the single season record for yards and touchdowns and even then if Rodgers, Brady, Manning, or any of the other top 6-7 Quaterbacks have a great year I could see AP losing it.  The NFL really needs a squeaky clean MVP  to remove the mess of last year."
nfl,3e2gzk,Bison66,6,Tue Jul 21 15:03:40 2015 UTC,"As much as I agree with the NFL needing a standup guy for MVP, that's just not how the MVP voters roll. If AP ends up leagues ahead of everyone statistically and the Vikings make the playoffs, he absolutely has a real shot at winning. The award is performance on the field based and how it translates to a teams W-L record, not about his demeanor off the field. There are other awards and achievement recognition for those things."
nfl,3e2gzk,AquaPrison,6,Tue Jul 21 15:35:08 2015 UTC,"Eh... I just think that odds for AP having an MVP-esque season are really slim. He would need to have an absolutely monstrous year at the age of 30, after spending the vast majority of the last season on the inactive list. Not to mention that the year before that, he was still great but wasn't on his 2012 level.   I think half of the MVP voters (who are primarily sports journalists) won't vote for him no matter what, which already eliminates his odds. So if he wants to get them on his side, he needs to spend the next year squeaky-clean, beg for forgiveness, and put up absolutely monstrous numbers. This is the same media that crucified Michael Vick for years after he went to prison for killing dogs. AP was just found to have beaten his own children, and then acted like a child afterwards with almost no punishment."

I mean how many people don't vote for Roethlisberger because of his own non-convicted issues.  While I am totally on board with anyone who says he ""shouldn't"" win it.

My Boba Fett took me just about two years and multiple thousands of dollars to build but people can do it for much less if they're not trying to be as meticulous as me.

Swap Reggie Wayne for Andre Johnson and Frank Gore for Trent Richardson and you could easily see his numbers improve to 5,000 yards+ and ~45 touchdowns just on sheer volume. A few less turnovers and he's a solid contender."
nfl,3e2gzk,jambo312,16,Tue Jul 21 14:57:54 2015 UTC,"""On Pace"" means nothing.   Having a few good games in a row puts you ""On Pace"" to break all sorts of records.  The great ones keep the pace.   We will see how he does with his new cast"

If you take a small sample size (even 4 games is too small to start predicting season totals) with 2 or even 1 good games for a qb they can look like legends."

nfl,3e2gzk,astew90,18,Tue Jul 21 15:30:07 2015 UTC,This was not a few good games. It was nine games into the season.
nfl,3e2gzk,astew90,103,Tue Jul 21 15:17:02 2015 UTC,"Tony Romo and for good reason   MVP winners need to be on a team that performs well. That Dallas team is very good offensively and the defence is not half bad either He has that monster o-line to help block for him. Not throwing under pressure is always beneficial to a QB I believe that now that Demarco is gone, the team will shift to a more pass-friendly team. More opportunities mean better stats Dez Bryant, one of if not the best receiver in the game, is back and as seen with Calvin helping Stafford, I think a similar thing could happen stats-wise"
nfl,3e2gzk,charlos72,36,Tue Jul 21 13:58:03 2015 UTC,I came to say Romo with a logical argument and was expecting it to get trashed. I'm not only shocked to see this has the most upvotes but it's from a non-Cowboy fan.  I don't know what's going on but I love you.

nfl,3e2gzk,Runna4life,8,Tue Jul 21 14:21:22 2015 UTC,"He's certainly got the talent to win it, but I think the Cowboys offense played to their full potential last year, I don't see a lot of room for growth. Demarco had an amazing year, the offensive line had an amazing year, Dez had an amazing year, Romo had an amazing year. All were relatively healthy.  .# 3 is the best reason he could win it. If the Cowboys throw 700+ times Romo could break records, otherwise I don't see it happening."
nfl,3e2gzk,jmcdon00,2,Tue Jul 21 16:11:24 2015 UTC,"His biggest challenge will be having the same level of performance, very efficient, with a higher volume of passes, which is incredibly difficult for even the best QBs. It's also harder to stop the pass when you fear being ran over on the ground. That all said, the Oline might allow whoever the current RB is to be a credible threat, mitigating this shift."
nfl,3e2gzk,19683dw,4,Tue Jul 21 16:52:52 2015 UTC,"I have this weird sense that after being surprisingly good last year, Dallas's D is going to return to form and be pretty bad."
nfl,3e2gzk,fathan,7,Tue Jul 21 16:36:23 2015 UTC,"I doubt it, we objectively upgraded our defensive line and the young guys there show promise. If Lee stays healthy then our linebacker corps is B+ to A grade. The only uncertainty is our secondary. Byron Jones has the intelligence and athleticism and Scandrick played well last year. We will see."
nfl,3e2gzk,keanex,2,Tue Jul 21 16:53:23 2015 UTC,Also Brandon Carr played out of his mind the second half of the season.
nfl,3e2gzk,thechamp4774,3,Tue Jul 21 17:41:41 2015 UTC,I agree 100%. I dont think we are going to be top 10 worthy but we should fall somewhere in the middle. Added pass rush will help the secondary and with the return of Lee things are looking good.
nfl,3e2gzk,bovice6990,2,Tue Jul 21 17:07:19 2015 UTC,"I could see a top 10 if Gregory and Jones work out and Hitchens and Crawford continue to progress. A lot of our defense really showed much better later in the year, if Hardy produces 10 sacks I think we'll be great.  A lot of ifs but I'm excited to see how we do."
nfl,3e2gzk,keanex,3,Tue Jul 21 17:14:34 2015 UTC,That is a lot of ifs haha. Don't forget D Law! He def showed some flashes last year. Plus old man Mincey helping out too. I think our D-line could be sneaky good this year.
nfl,3e2gzk,bovice6990,3,Tue Jul 21 18:07:03 2015 UTC,"Injuries are the only thing that might cause that to happen.  But adding Randy Gregory, healthy Sean Lee, Byron Jones, and Greg Hardy, even if everything else remains the same, the defense is vastly improved."
nfl,3e2gzk,Shart_Film,2,Tue Jul 21 17:27:19 2015 UTC,"1: Dallas lost the most consistent RB in the game over the offseason and their defense benefited immensely from the time of possession the offense was able to secure. There is more talent on defense this year, but it will be a longshot to measure up to their defensive performance last year.    2: Point conceded.    3: DeMarco being gone is probably going to hurt the passing game as teams won't have to respect Randle as much as Murray.    4: Dez has been there for awhile."
nfl,3e2gzk,zeitfalle,10,Tue Jul 21 17:19:40 2015 UTC,"Since everyone already cleared all the obvious candidates, I'll go ahead and push forward the idea that if Stafford can win in GB, he has an outside shot at it, especially if he makes a few minor steps forward.  Unless Rodgers has a year like last years, of course.  Then fuck everyone else getting it."
nfl,3e2gzk,LobotomistCircu,9,Tue Jul 21 14:55:51 2015 UTC,Geno Smith...  hahahahhaha jk my guess is Aaron Rodgers.
nfl,3e2gzk,keobR,17,Tue Jul 21 15:07:07 2015 UTC,"So I agree with some, but have some dark horses!  PROBABLE:    PLAYER REASONING    Aaron Rodgers As long as the offense plays as well as last year, he will have a good chance.  He got it last year even though he shouldn't have (IMO).   Peyton Manning Still lots of weapons, plus a half decent OLine. If they pull out a 13-3 record, I think it is his.   Tony Romo Just be healthy Tony, you have a chance to take it all the way.  He will need some good stats behind that line, but if AaRod falters, it can go to you.   JJ Watt If Clowney comes back strong, that defense will be fearsome.  I can see Watt breaking the sack record.   DeMarco Murray If he can duplicate last years efforts in Philly, he will be in the discussion.    DARKHORSE FAVORITES (these only possible if above do not perform to their best):    PLAYER REASONING    Cam Newton How can you not love Cam?  I think he can be healthy and strong all season, putting up some impressive numbers to a 3rd NFC South title and a 12-4 record.  For this to happen, others above have to struggle.   Carson Palmer Cause Bruce Arians is a mad scientist and won 10 games last year.  Think what he could do with Palmer at the helm.  It could look like 70% completion, 40 TD's, 5 INT's.   Joe Flacco A couple new coaches, including Trestman.  While tresti wasn't a good HC, he might be a good OC.  He did have the #2 offense in 2013 after all...  This could mean BIG numbers for the Dragon.    Homer Pick - Matt Forte - He puts up pretty solid numbers every year for us, and if we get our OLine stable, he could have an even BETTER year. This hinges on how the Bears do though, if they make the playoffs (even at 10-6), I think Forte could win it..."

nfl,3e2gzk,Rutawitz,2,Tue Jul 21 15:53:55 2015 UTC,"Well considering Eli hasn't missed a start since he took over for Warner back in 04, I think it's safe to say injury isn't too great of a concern. Ignoring that, however, the Line is somewhat improved this year even with Beatty injured, so I think Manning does have a VERY dark horse candidacy at MVP with additions in Vereen and Harris (who they claim they will use but personally I doubt) as well as guys you would imagine are bound to at least remotely improve like Randle and Donnell, topped off with a return of Cruz. Don't get me wrong, I have high doubts ALL of this falls into place perfectly, but for the sake of argument I figured I'd just lay out the blueprints to this potential MVP season."

nfl,3e2gzk,terminator3456,9,Tue Jul 21 14:53:20 2015 UTC,"It's tough, but the odds are that it will go to a QB. The QB with the best shot at having the best season is Rodgers. At this point, he's the safest choice.   Recent repeats have been prevented by a variety of reasons:   2010: Brady won and in 2011 Rodgers had an all time great QB season.  2011: Rodgers won and in 2012 Peterson had an all time great RB season.   2012: Peterson won and in 2013 Peyton had arguably the best QB season ever.   2013: Peyton won and in 2014 he played banged up and regressed to his mean a bit after 2013. Additionally, Rodgers played superbly.   It's tough to repeat, but repeats in the past 4-5 years have been prevented largely by an even better performance the following year. So would I say that Rodgers has a better than 50% shot at it, hell no, but I'd say he has a better chance right now than other potential candidates and has the best chance to do even better than last year's performance."

nfl,3e2gzk,Backpacks_Got_Jets,9,Tue Jul 21 13:41:04 2015 UTC,"Offensive lines are going to be spread pretty thin between Watt, Wilfork, and hopefully Clowney this year. That front seven has the potential to be brutal."
nfl,3e2gzk,ZipMcCockup,19,Tue Jul 21 14:12:38 2015 UTC,"If Watt has similar numbers (and I mean pretty much the exact same numbers), but with a few more offensive contributions, and one more interception and he still has a good shot. I think the deciding factor would be if Randy got injured on a kickoff and Watt took over field goal duties and nailed a 30 yarder."
nfl,3e2gzk,dseals,11,Tue Jul 21 13:58:56 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think Watt can do it statistically.  He needs to singlehandedly win a game or two for the Texans - and hopefully against the Colts.  He needs to make a game-sealing (or division-sealing would be better) pick-6 or something like that to really elevate his MVP bid.  I think it's been pretty much decided over the last two years that the voters aren't going to give it to him based on ""merely"" a dominating statistical performance, so his best bet instead is the Disney story."
nfl,3e2gzk,oorza,6,Tue Jul 21 14:06:15 2015 UTC,"Sadly I think you're right, which is why I threw in the 30 yard field goal. He'd still probably finish second, but I think if he just showed off some ridiculous versatility (which O'Brien loves to do) then he'd still be in the running."
nfl,3e2gzk,dseals,3,Tue Jul 21 14:15:40 2015 UTC,"He needs to singlehandedly win a game or two    Well he did that against the Bills pretty much.

Like if Rodgers and Romo were removed from the equation last year, Watt would probably have beaten Murray because the Cowboys were pretty stacked outside of Murray."
nfl,3e2gzk,Occams_Lazor_,3,Tue Jul 21 14:59:40 2015 UTC,"Doubt it. It's not ""best player"" or ""best player relative to his position"" or Watt would have won it last year, because the gap between Watt and the next-best DE was far greater than the gap between Rodgers and Romo.  It's ""most valuable player,"" which is a stupid award in a game with one position that's vastly more valuable than the rest. QBs are just the most valuable, even if they're not a huge outlier. And even if a defensive player wins, it's pretty much always going to be a DE...  For what it's worth, I think Watt was the player of the year last year, no question, over Rodgers all day-- but Rodgers was more valuable because his position gives him more opportunity to contribute."
nfl,3e2gzk,troglodyte,2,Tue Jul 21 15:02:53 2015 UTC,If it was best player relative to position then Shane Lechker would have won some.  Best player doesn't mean best compared to others only at your position who are currently playing football.

nfl,3e2gzk,Afalau,12,Tue Jul 21 15:15:01 2015 UTC,The last defensive player to win MVP was in 1986; the last MVP from a non-playoff team was in 1973.  Watt absolutely does not win MVP unless the Texans make the playoffs. Last year was not his best shot.

If it weren't for Aaron ""Throw 6 TDs in a half"" Rodgers last season, it would have been between Romo and Watt, and for good reason.   Rodgers should be on a preseason favorite list, as should Watt and Big Ben.   All four are in a position to put up crazy numbers again, which typically translates to an MVP trophy  AP is pissed, so I'm scared of what he'll do next season. Probably going to be in the conversation.   My dark horse MVP though, and someone I would love to see win it: Mike Evans. I think if he continues to put up crazy numbers and helps Jameis' transition from college to the pros go smoothly, while keeping Tampa in some sort of contention, then he could be the first WR to win MVP. I think the media spotlight that will be on Jameis will help bring more attention to Evans and allow him to shine.   Another reason I think he will succeed enough to win an MVP, just look at the teams he has to play next season. The only real defense they will play is the Panthers twice and the Rams once. That's just ASKING for gaudy offensive numbers from the Buccs.   If he continues to grow as he has the past three years of his very short football career, with an off season of NFL training and coaching that will benefit him a TON, he may well be able to break 2k next season.   But he also may suffer from a rookie QB and Tampa continues to wallow in obscurity. Guess we'll just have to wait and see."
nfl,3e2gzk,TheOriginal_G,4,Tue Jul 21 14:44:45 2015 UTC,"Technically yes, we will have to wait and see.  But practically, you can write that dark horse prediction off as absolutely not going to happen.  For ANY WR to get consideration they'd have to break the yardage and touchdown records (1,964+ yards, 23+ TDs), and have no other team mate contribute much in the passing game (otherwise his QB would have had a good enough season to draw votes himself).  To expect him to do that with a rookie QB, on a team that was the worst in the league last year is a bit ludicrous."

nfl,3e2gzk,ahungrybatman,13,Tue Jul 21 13:22:34 2015 UTC,I like Brees and the talk of his alleged downturn is in my view simply wrong.  BUT  I thin it's less likely he wins MVP than in any prior season. Simply because the Saints are clearly going for a more balanced approach. If they do have a good season I think Brees naturally takes less of the credit than in prior years and that Payton will get more props for changing the approach.
nfl,3e2gzk,olig23,8,Tue Jul 21 13:27:49 2015 UTC,I mean the Packers went with an extremely balanced approach last year and it got Rodgers MVP.
nfl,3e2gzk,blackcash,8,Tue Jul 21 14:40:06 2015 UTC,"I think the difference is that the saints were known as a one dimensional passig offence. One where Brees was regularly flirting with the single-season passing record. So while it's certainly hypocrisy, I think it's tough for Brees to have a statistical down turn and still get votes to the extent he did prior.  On top of that there is a perception (an incorrect one imo) that he has declined and so when his numbers are less gaudy in a more balanced team I think that only feeds the narrative.  For Rodgers he is regarded as the best, regardless and in his prime."

We have some castoffs coming in to fill major roles in the secondary and a lot of guys are still playing hurt and/or coming back from surgery.   Sherman elected not to have surgery in the offseason and if he goes down, a lot of what we've built on defense will struggle. That, along with the fact that Wilson has been put in a ""Flacco"" type situation where he basically has a year to prove that he's capable of carrying the team before he either gets a contract or walks means that there's definitely a conceivable situation where he is made the center of the team and either carries us or fails miserably."

I hope the Chiefs do well. I like so much about that team. I love Arrowhead and it's atmosphere, Jamaal Charles, Andy reid, Justin Houston, Derrick Johnson, Tamba Hali, Dontari Poe... but I do worry Smith is the limiting factor for them."
nfl,3e2gzk,olig23,5,Tue Jul 21 13:56:56 2015 UTC,Not a shot in hell Smith wins MVP. The only players that would from the Chiefs would be Jamaal Charles whose best chance was a couple years ago when he lead our team in rushing and receiving and had a monster year but wasn't even mentioned.   The only other would be Justin Houston who really hasn't been recognized much outside of this sub despite tying the single season sack record and being the highest paid linebacker ever and second highest paid defensive player. His contract was hardly even mentioned on ESPN while they had huge segments on Dez and Demryius getting contracts. But since he plays defense and he's not JJ he has no shot unless he breaks the sack record by a few and plays amazing all year.
nfl,3e2gzk,ImJustAverage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:33:53 2015 UTC,"No offense, but I don't really see how some of what you said helps or supports the argument in Alex Smith winning MVP. Maclin and Kelce? Absolutely, great points. Charles? Ehhh, I almost feel like he takes away from Smith as a candidate more than he helps. When you have a guy who turns screens into 20 yd gains and handoffs into touchdowns, it makes it difficult to give the QB more credit than the RB, which is what you would need here. Reid as coach obviously isn't a negative point, but the way I personally see it is that if he couldn't coach McNabb to one (granted he was very close), then it's highly unlikely that Smith is the guy to do it for him. As for the defense, I don't really see what that helps Smith with as an MVP. Does it help them win games to make him look better? Sure. But it also keeps opposing teams to low scores, meaning there likely won't ever be a game where they have Smith throwing 45 passes or so. You make a good argument for the Chiefs to make the playoffs, but I don't think it supports an MVP season for Smith all that much."
nfl,3e2gzk,xenongamer4351,5,Tue Jul 21 14:33:55 2015 UTC,"The QBs most likely to do it:   Peyton Manning because of name recognition, age, and general gravitas. Tom Brady has a really fantastic chance to come back from suspension and lead a winless Patriots team on an undefeated run to the playoffs and win the MVP that way. Andrew Luck, Philip Rivers and/or Drew Brees are likely going to lead the NFL in volume stats for most of the year and will have an MVP bid that way.   The other offensive players likely to do it:     Marshawn Lynch is always a viable candidate due to his role in that offense. DeMarco Murray has a really strong chance to lead an exciting run-first offense without a successful QB and set/pace a bunch of records along the way. Adrian Peterson could very well set the single season rushing record this year just running on rage.   And the defensive player:   JJ Watt, who would have a viable MVP if he continues his statistical dominance, the Texans make the playoffs without a strong offensive standout player, and he's the reason for a couple marquee wins, especially if he makes the play to win the division.   Out of all of these options, my bet is on DeMarco Murray.  The backlash from QB-only MVP voting is growing and he's in the best position of any RB to do a bunch of really ridiculous things, both statwise and in terms of making history.  My gut feeling is a QB needs to have a really historical season to win the MVP this year.  I don't think the MVP voters are likely to give it to Aaron Rodgers in consecutive seasons unless he does something really unprecedented like set the TD record again."

And that's honestly what I feel like it would take for Rodgers to win again."
nfl,3e2gzk,oorza,6,Tue Jul 21 13:38:10 2015 UTC,"You have to do something historically special to win consecutive MVP awards.   Not really?

Outside chances:  Ben Roethlisberger, Tony Romo, JJ Watt, Adrian Peterson, and not even being a homer, Cam has a chance if he can return to his 2011-2012 numbers with a full healthy offseason behind him and revamped receiving corp."

nfl,3e2n44,BlindWillieJohnson,11,Tue Jul 21 14:14:38 2015 UTC,Seriously.  Whiz already undressed the guy to the media a few weeks ago.  He was already on the bubble.
nfl,3e2n44,aksoileau,15,Tue Jul 21 14:16:36 2015 UTC,"He wasn't really on the bubble. I think they would have kept him over a guy like Nicks. It's only his 3rd season and they traded up to get him at 34, and it wasn't a sunk cost just yet. I think Whiz ribbing him in the media is just Whiz's coaching style when he thinks he can get more out of a player than he is getting, he's a serious old-school hard-ass with players sometimes. Now I think they're waiting to hear more about the case. They'll probably cut him is its serious. The Titans have taken flyers on some guys with behavioral problems before; Lewan, DGB, Mettenberger, Cox and its amazing that a guy with no previous history was the one to fuck up first. You just can't predict when one of these guys does something really stupid."

nfl,3e1uef,jfgiv,7,Tue Jul 21 13:52:44 2015 UTC,This is always to go to answer here and I agree it helps.   Just don't expect the stats or outcomes to line up. There's lots of Madden-born football fans that think a WR had a shitty game with 80 yards or a QB sucks if he throws for 3500 yards.   Don't even get me started on Madden off seasons.
nfl,3e1uef,westsideozzie,-4,Tue Jul 21 13:41:29 2015 UTC,"QB sucks if he throws for 3500 yards.   To be fair, in today's game that's a really bad total unless you're also threatening defenses with your legs."
nfl,3e1uef,ThePaddingtonBear,4,Tue Jul 21 14:53:20 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say it's really bad. Andy Dalton and Tony Romo aren't really bad.
nfl,3e1uef,westsideozzie,4,Tue Jul 21 15:10:31 2015 UTC,"Romo threw for 3700 yards and would have thrown for more had he not been backed by one of the league's best running attack. Dalton is Dalton. He's not terrible, but he's hardly anything to write home about."
nfl,3e1uef,ThePaddingtonBear,3,Tue Jul 21 15:16:05 2015 UTC,You're making my point. Romo isn't terrible and stat heads would look at 3700 yards as a sign he's no good.   You mention the rationale behind the stat and its 100% correct. If you only play Madden you miss those kinds of details.
nfl,3e1uef,westsideozzie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:33:04 2015 UTC,Romo isn't terrible and stat heads would look at 3700 yards as a sign he's no good.   No they wouldn't. Stat heads understand context. They're the ones who have been banging Romo's drum for years.
nfl,3e1uef,ThePaddingtonBear,6,Tue Jul 21 17:18:58 2015 UTC,This is a great suggestion. Madden is excellent for learning the rules of the game. Especially at first when the game can be a little confusing.

nfl,3e1uef,JB1549,54,Tue Jul 21 18:07:41 2015 UTC,As an NFL fan not from the U.S. (Australia represent!) I found the best way to get into American football is a combination of the Madden video games and playing Fantasy whilst watching a few games here and there. Both teach you player names and give you a basic understanding of positions and rules. Plus with a couple of mates it can be a great deal of fun
nfl,3e1uef,RyanWithPants,17,Tue Jul 21 09:12:41 2015 UTC,Also from Australia and agree with all of this. The NFL game pass is also (kind of) cheap and you can watch any of the games live or delayed. The rules are kind of hard to grasp at first but the referees and commentators do a reasonable job at explaining what is happening.
nfl,3e1uef,mkyle12,10,Tue Jul 21 10:49:07 2015 UTC,fantasy football definitely increased how closely I follow the sport.  That is good advice.

nfl,3e1uef,BucsCapacitor,3,Tue Jul 21 12:11:26 2015 UTC,Some teams feel like they are in a smaller market because of having less internet presence and not winning much over the last few years.

Even though they've been a miserable franchise for over 100 years, they still are a top-5 fan base (when looking at the merch they sell). They are historical, and they are in one of the largest cities in America.  If you go to a Bears game in Tampa (which I unfortunately am doing this year) you will see that Bears nation is strong.

But, say if you were a young kid, and you had never heard Norwegian before, then someone spoke to you in Norwegian, could you kind of understand it? That would be pretty cool.  Also, I'm not sure if I'm in the minority, but out of the Scandinavian languages, Danish seems the easiest to interpret as a native English speaker. I don't know if that is due to having Jutlanders settling much of Britain back in the day, but it does seem like their grammar is easier to interpret than Swedish. Or maybe I'm just a silly moron."

nfl,3e1uef,lagitech,17,Tue Jul 21 09:25:32 2015 UTC,"About the points. I see fans of other sports say that NFL just inflates the score to feel good about themselves. These are just trolls, usually, but I don't think people outside the fan base understand why the score is the way it is and it can confuse you when you first watch.   List of ways to score points, lowest to highest:   PAT (Point after Touchdown) - 1 point - basically guaranteed, but can be missed or blocked Two-point conversion - 2 point - instead of going for a PAT, the team decides to try for 2. They have to get in the end zone again for it to be successful. If they don't, they get no points other than the Touchdown. Safety (offense gets tackled inside their own endzone) - 2 points - Offense gets tackled inside own end zone. Sometimes can be for different reason, like a penalty, but most of the time it's getting tackled in the end zone.  Field Goal - 3 points - Team decides to try for 3 using their Kicker. Usually happens when team is on opponents side of the field and it is 4th down or time is almost out in the half. Here's a video of infamous missed field goals Touchdown - 6 points - When one team gets the ball across the opponents goal line while maintaining possession of the oddly shaped ball. Multiple ways to accomplish this."

I strongly recommend picking a team and rooting for them, but you don't have to do that immediately. The smart thing would be to learn about and follow the league for a year or two, and before you know it, you'll naturally fall in love with a team for various reasons.

Also a website meant for UK fans that helped me learn about different teams/ the game is here"
nfl,3e1uef,FreshRain,3,Tue Jul 21 12:11:01 2015 UTC,"It's a very easy sport to get into. There are only games three nights of the week (Thursday, Sunday, and Monday) and Thursday/Monday usually only have one game per week.   If it's available, I would suggest getting NFL Game Rewind. You can watch the games at your own pace (especially nice given the time zone discrepancy.) I worked most Sundays last year, so it was nice to be able to sit down and watch games on my day off, provided I could avoid spoilers for a day or two.  If you can, watch with friends or family. Football is a great communal sport. In fact, that's a lot of its charm. Since it's really easy to keep track of the entire league (compared to say, hockey or baseball, where the frequency and scheduling of games makes it a task just to keep up on your own team, let alone the whole league) so it's easy to be on the same page as other viewers. 'Game day' is its own mini holiday every week. A lot of fans have rituals. Don't worry too much about having 'your' team at first. It's part of the design of professional sports to want to have someone you root for, but if you try to use deductive reasoning to find a favorite team, you might find yourself jumping ship frequently. Just watch a wide spread of teams, if possible, and someone will rise to the top. Since there are so few games in a football season, each game carries more statistical weight, that is, it makes up a larger percentage of the season. A bad football game is worth 1/16th of the year, whereas a bad baseball game is worth 1/162nd of the year. So emotions between teams run high, and rivalries are more intense in football than I think in any other professional sport in the US. Once you find a team, you'll more importantly find the three or four or five or thirty-one teams you just absolutely hate. Don't be afraid to ask questions, especially here. Football fans love to share their knowledge, since we're all so brilliant and should be coaching. It's a complicated, intricate game with a lot of subtleties and nuances that may take years to pick up on. 'Chess with giants' is the conventional turn of phrase."

There is 1 game on Thursday night.  This is like ""friday junior"" the work week is almost done, you can drink and watch the game knowing the next day is Friday.  Sunday is THE DAY.  You better have off work and have nothing to do.  Usually about 5-7 games start at 1pm EST and 5-7 games start after they end around 4pm EST.  Then after those games end, there is the Sunday night game.  This is the finale to a great sunday funday.  Then Monday night is 1 final game.  It sucks to go to work Monday, but that night you can unwind and watch the final NFL game of the week.  If you want to get frisky, bet a game.  Place $25 or something and watch the entire game.  It makes it much more interesting.  Pick a favorite team, I suggest the Philadelphia Eagles.  They have never won a Superbowl and are definitely the most interesting teams coming into this season.  They have a 3rd year coach who has implemented a new style of coaching consisting of ""sports science"" and a constant ""hurry-up"" offense.  They play fast, little time between plays.

nfl,3e2cyk,fawkeswow,40,Tue Jul 21 16:40:25 2015 UTC,Bet ya constantly hearing that it was all the OLine really pisses Emmitt off
nfl,3e2cyk,MrJoobJoob,15,Tue Jul 21 12:49:49 2015 UTC,"Emmitt Smith recognized from the beginning of his career that he couldn't have achieved what he did without his stellar offensive line.  Referring to his 1991 rushing title:   ...I sneaked around our locker room and dropped Rolex watches into the lockers of each of our offensive linemen - the guys who clear the path for me to run. Each of the watches was inscribed with this message: ""Thanks for the 1,563 rushing yards: NFL Rushing Title. Emmitt Smith""   Edit: spelling."
nfl,3e2cyk,powersnake,10,Tue Jul 21 16:47:01 2015 UTC,truth hertz.... And Emmitt was a great running back.  You couldn't be an average back and gotten those yards. He was very talented. But that OLine tho......  Both can be true.
nfl,3e2cyk,SputnikFace,2,Tue Jul 21 15:38:49 2015 UTC,He was very fortunate as far as injuries go too.  I get the feeling career rushing records are going to be hard to break in this day and age with current size and speed of players.  Injuries will play a huge factor.  He was a great player.

I can understand if an athlete doesn't want to acknowledge greatness, but let's stop pretending that they're professionals on the subject of talent evaluation."

The dude's livelihood was basically destroyed after that and Jordan had a large part in propagating the myth that he was ""cut,"" and there he is on stage at the HoF mouthing off about the guy making a mistake again.  Fuck Michael Jordan."
nfl,3e2cyk,-Shank-,-28,Tue Jul 21 15:29:35 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, because we know Sports writers don't stretch the truth either, and as someone who was held back from Varsity (I went into school a year early and wasn't at the age limit), it made me quit, so it's a bigger deal than you think even if the guy isn't trying to save his ass. I also don't know the dudes name, I don't think anyone really does, so how would he be systematically held out of jobs? People are salty at MJ, I mean if I was a fan of the other teams back in the day maybe I would be too. He talks about how he's great because he is, if you don't like it, beat his records, do better than him then you can put him down.

Completely irrelevant anyways, I'm not taking anything away from Jordan on the court. He's the best player ever and was my favorite player in the 90's.   The main reason he has such a bad reputation now are the myriad instances of him being a horrible human being, not because he's the best to ever do it and unabashed about that.

nfl,3e2cyk,SharksFanAbroad,7,Tue Jul 21 15:40:58 2015 UTC,Okay well the title of this is out of context and sounds worse than it is.

nfl,3e2cyk,Tubbier-Wombat,4,Tue Jul 21 16:23:20 2015 UTC,He said 2500 yards doesn't say 2500 rushing yards. Murray was pretty close 2500 yards.

nfl,3e2cyk,mrpapagiorgio,-3,Tue Jul 21 16:26:39 2015 UTC,Kobe peak was never really that impressive but how long he was dominant was really impressive.

nfl,3e2cyk,realsomalipirate,5,Tue Jul 21 17:13:56 2015 UTC,"You can disagree with Kobe being better than Lebron, but saying Kobe's peak wasn't impressive is bullshit. He had a 9-game streak of scoring 40 points at one time. He had a 4-game 50 point streak in 2007 (and had 43 in the subsequent game). He scored 81 points in a game.   And before you say that he was on a shit team in all of these; the 9-game streak was in the 2003 season when he still played with Shaq.  What does a man have to do to impress you?"
nfl,3e2cyk,1l1l1l1,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:36:01 2015 UTC,Meant compared to a Lebron or a Jordan. I still say Lebron's 2013 season (year the Heat won 27 straight games) as a two-way monster still trumps anything Kobe has done. Or really any year Lebron had those insane PER ratings

I just remember my friend and I both texted each other at the same time shocked at how douchey he sounded.   Then there was Montana big mouthing Brady over deflategate but I'm pretty sure he apologized for it.   Why can't retired players just respect the talent below them.

DeMarco did leave a lot of meat on the bone.  I think it's less of a shot at DeMarco, but more of a testament of our offensive line & the trust the Cowboys have in their backfield going forward.  I'm pretty sure Emmitt has a right to be an optimistic Cowboy fan.  I don't think Emmitt is really threatened by his legacy because of DeMarco. *edit (so no reason to discredit him)"
nfl,3e2cyk,DYELBro,4,Tue Jul 21 15:32:59 2015 UTC,"I dont get what he is actually saying.  Is he saying a better running back would have got more? Or that DeMarco quit on plays?  Make bad reads and hit wrong holes?  Or what?  I really dont get it.  He says DeMarco did the best he could with his individual talent, so I take that as DeMarco could not 2,500 bc he did his best.  He would have to perform better than his best to get 2,500.    I am just real confused about his comments.  They seem to bounce between admiration for the job done, criticism of the running back, praise for the O-Line, and credit to the running back.  Reading through the lines I think he is saying a better running back would have gotten 2,500 yards.  But he had BETTER lines and never whiffed that, so I am just keep scratching my head.  Once you dissect his words here, I think in an attempt to be PC he has criticized everyone and contradicted himself numerous times."
nfl,3e2cyk,TwoChe,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:59 2015 UTC,"I think some points to consider.  Emmitt praised Demarco all last season  Emmitt said he would pay to keep Demarco in the offseason  All running backs leave yards on the field.  I don't know if it's safe to say it was 2500 yards worth as Demarco made plays other running backs couldn't.  But Demarco missed holes, and his speed wasn't breakaway.  I think he's praising the o-line.  And hyping up the current cowboys rbs saying 'hey, there's yards out there for you to get'   Emmitt has never had a way with words (see his television career), but the dude has always been humble.  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt that he wasn't trying to slight DeMarco."
nfl,3e2cyk,DYELBro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:03:56 2015 UTC,I don't know if he is saying a better running back would have gotten 2500 but watching demarco last year there were plenty of times he could have gotten more yards but he always seemed to try to run over/through defenders instead of going around them. I think that is probably the same thing Emmitt and Randle are seeing when they talk about leaving meat on the bone last year.

nfl,3e2cyk,Lyndell,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:47:38 2015 UTC,Eh I get where /u/jegnomesimpson is coming from though. I'd still put LeBron outside of my top 5 all time personally. He'd be right there with Kobe and Bird. He hasn't overcome Jordan or Russell or Magic etc etc in my eyes and thats not including guys that I don't think get a fair shake like Wilt. You wanna talk all time talent he's probably the best basketball player ever. Production he's probably getting right next too top 5.

nfl,3e2cyk,Lyndell,2,Tue Jul 21 15:57:14 2015 UTC,And the best player for about 5-7 of those years.  Kobe was the best player for about a decade and I dont have him in my top 3. Only getting 2 titles out of that HEAT team was terrible.  They themselves thought it was a dynasty.  They were stacked and should have lost to no one those first 3 years.  Losing to the Mavs in 2011 should be a forever blemish on his legacy.  He has too many big time let downs like that.

He is going to start having those save it for the playoffs seasons.  Late 20's is usually when players go super hard.   I dont see LeBron winning another MVP, and I dont see him getting a title with Cleveland in the next 2 years at least.  If he a shot at a title he will have to leave Cleveland and team with a super squad to make it happen.  So if he ends his career with 2 titles, 2 finals MVPs and 4 MVP's I would not put him top 3 all time."
nfl,3e2cyk,TwoChe,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:33:51 2015 UTC,Kobe was never the best player in the NBA at any point. For most of his success he wasnt even the best player on his team.  Late 90/00s Shaq. mid 2000's Duncan/Garnett late 00's-now LeBron.
nfl,3e2cyk,ACPhila,2,Tue Jul 21 16:56:15 2015 UTC,LeBron hasnt been the best player in the league either of the last 2 seasons.

Were there instances where he left yards on the table? Probably. But make no mistake, there were also instances where he created yardage that other backs probably wouldn't have by driving through contact and fighting for extra yards. At the end of the day, he is a great player and he will be missed. That's not to say he can't be replaced, but to belittle his accomplishments is foolish and pointless."

nfl,3e2cyk,Runna4life,27,Tue Jul 21 12:42:22 2015 UTC,"The fact that Smith ran behind a line with 30 combined Pro Bowls and never got 1800 yards proves that no, he couldn't have."
nfl,3e2cyk,IMLOwl,-3,Tue Jul 21 13:15:54 2015 UTC,"Well, in 1993 he rushed for about 1,500 yards with over 100 less carries. While averaging 5.3 YPC. Let's say he crashes and burns and gets 4 yards per carry on his next 110 carries (which would put him at 392, like Murray) that puts him at 1,926 yards  which puts him over Murray. Let's say he got 110 more carries and averaged around 4.9 YPC, which is much more likely than 4 yards per carry. That puts him at 2025 yards.   Conclusion: In 1994 if Smith had been given more opportunities he would have been way over what Murray did. Don't blame him for not rushing for more than Murray when he didn't get the same amount t of opportunities."
nfl,3e2cyk,Runna4life,6,Tue Jul 21 14:35:40 2015 UTC,In 3 other season he had in the high 300s in carries and didn't beat 1845.
nfl,3e2cyk,IMLOwl,-3,Tue Jul 21 14:41:13 2015 UTC,"That's not a fair way to judge it. I used both the 4th seasons of their careers. Demarco could bust and never go over 1000 yards again. Does that mean he's better than Emmitt because of that single season? No. He could rush for 1800 yards for 10 more years. Does that mean he's better? Yes.   My point is in the same season of his career, if Emmitt hadn't gotten injured he's have easily taken Demarco's record."
nfl,3e2cyk,TwoChe,10,Tue Jul 21 14:52:46 2015 UTC,"It's not a question of who is better. Emmitt Smith is a hall of fame player.

Assuming they all started on the 20, that's 179 carries at 80 YPC for 14,320 yards, and yet he could only manage a meager 2253 yards or 2 whole kilometers from scrimmage.

nfl,3e2cyk,Shart_Film,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:36:14 2015 UTC,2105 is a hard number to beat. But some things gotta break right.   You have to be a super running back in PEAK FORM You have be ready EVERY WEEKEND. you tune out one week and the record attempt will be up in smoke. The passing game has to be average level. 1984 was Kemp Years.  Coach has to be willing to feed you the WHOLE year.

nfl,3e2cyk,Nexus369,3,Tue Jul 21 16:56:35 2015 UTC,"Just upvoted you.   I wouldn't be surprised if Eagles fans are annoyed at those comments - anyone would be over their team's newly acquired, prized FA. But that doesn't take away from the fact that a former (great, franchise) player is making assenine assertions that he could have done it better when (A.) he never did despite (B.) having a better line, during an era where (C.) teams were passing much less and (D.) his QB was less efficient than Tony was the given year.  I realize all Emmitt is good at anymore is stringing together unintelligible sentences, dancing, and repping the star, but he should shut his mouth and stick to the latter two while not detracting from another Cowboy's success."

Visiting the various 49er and Seahawk msg boards, and listening to the sports radio shows for the two cities over the past few years confirms to me that these two fan bases very much dislike one another.  That is a rivalry, no matter how recent it is.  I ""hate"" the 49ers the most right now, but I also still ""hate"", and have ""hated"" longer the Broncos and the Raiders."

The 49ers-Seahawks ""rivalry"" is a fad, and with Harbaugh gone and the Niners bound for mediocrity, it's probably going to die out sooner rather than later."
nfl,3e384y,TimeShinigami,2,Tue Jul 21 18:45:33 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree.  It was a short rivalry, but it was a legit and intense rivalry for the few years it lasted.  Arguably the best two teams in the league, with recent HCs that had a history (and beef) in college, with very similar styles of play (top defenses) and with very young, athletic QBs.  And two cities that are, generally speaking, close to one another geographically. I remember the 2013 season clearly, and honestly the 49ers were the only team I really feared.  And as such, I hated them.  I suspect many other Seahawk fans felt the same way, and I'm guessing many 49er fans felt that way as well.  At it all together and that is a rival.  A new rival, and maybe not a long term rivalry, but the mutual dislike was very real."

nfl,3e384y,Afalau,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:07:54 2015 UTC,Irrationally??  Seems pretty rational though.
nfl,3e384y,Terrell2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:15:26 2015 UTC,no i meant internal. i can feel the anger infesting from my insides :(
nfl,3e384y,jimsorrell,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:57 2015 UTC,Hmm that's the first time I've heard that phrase.
nfl,3e384y,SeadderalCheatHawks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:19:32 2015 UTC,"Really?  Usually I only get angry if I know our team didn't play as well as they could've. I feel like this game was both teams at the top of their form, and in the end the Seahawks won it.  No anger or regrets here, especially after we saw them completely dismantle the greatest offense of all time."
nfl,3e384y,WhatMyHeartHeld,4,Tue Jul 21 18:31:05 2015 UTC,"Someone yesterday posted that I would be furious when I saw what fell to #18. And they were absolutely right.  Who in their right mind thinks this game should be as low as #18? And does that mean that the boring, except for the last 10 minutes, NFC Title game from this year is higher? Recency bias, you are a destructive mistress."
nfl,3e384y,pietya,3,Tue Jul 21 17:27:24 2015 UTC,Last 4 minutes.  10 minutes is too generous.

nfl,3e2zbh,kksred,8,Tue Jul 21 16:15:07 2015 UTC,People like you are why I feel like I have to apologize before I tell people who my team is.
nfl,3e2zbh,starthirteen,-5,Tue Jul 21 17:13:37 2015 UTC,It's called a rivalry. Maybe you missed most of it when you hopped on the bandwagon in 2002.
nfl,3e2zbh,kksred,9,Tue Jul 21 17:23:56 2015 UTC,"The constant need to shoehorn in Patriots comments has nothing to do with rivalry. Your comment was pedestrian at best, and completely unnecessary, adding nothing to the conversation.   But what do I know, I'm just a bandwagon fan."
nfl,3e2zbh,starthirteen,-4,Tue Jul 21 17:27:28 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry. i forgot that bringing up the fact that their best player in their recent memory came to their rival and won a SB ring does nothing for the rivalry. I bet jets fans just enjoy being reminded about that.   And ""adds nothing to the conversation""? Seriously? Go look on any thread. 90% of the comments add nothing to any conversation."
nfl,3e2zbh,kksred,6,Tue Jul 21 17:30:54 2015 UTC,"So because 90% of all comments are useless, you think you should make useless comments too? Just doing your part to help the entire fanbase look like sore winners?  Good job, guy. Keep fighting the good fight."

So that would presumably be exactly what you're after. But likely won't be out until 2016. They have a blog and twitter.  There's Front office Football. That's good, but the UI is dated. Still fun to play though."
nfl,3e2ohg,olig23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:30:55 2015 UTC,I'll 2nd front office football. I especially like that you can call the plays during a game and see the play by play. It's all text-based though. Deep game with tons of variables for each player. I had a hard time winning a game during the demo period that I was able to play it.
nfl,3e2ohg,JB1549,14,Tue Jul 21 18:01:23 2015 UTC,There was an NFL Headcoach game for PS2 and Xbox.
nfl,3e2ohg,CanlStillBeGarth,16,Tue Jul 21 14:24:21 2015 UTC,"God that was the best game. The last time I played it I started off with a job from the Detroit Lions, spent about 18 hours making the best team I could in the offseason and ended up going 9-7. Somehow making the playoffs, somehow beating Mike Holgrem and the Seahawks on a game winning field goal, and then it was all a blur until I won the Super Bowl.  I haven't played since."

nfl,3e2ohg,sfzen,9,Tue Jul 21 17:09:02 2015 UTC,"Deeproute has been fun for a long time. There's always a balance issue or twelve, but I come back every day.    Basically, you simulate the NFL, controlling player personnel and game-time strategy through drafts, free agency, and a full season/playoffs against other human (and occasional CPU) owners.  Timing varies from league to league, but, typically, each simulated week of the season takes place over a single daily turn."

nfl,3e2ohg,Keeks_marone,2,Tue Jul 21 15:03:39 2015 UTC,"Got it on Steam sale for 16 I think, and it's quite enjoyable. All text based but there's a LOT of depth to it, from drafting players with specific tendencies, to game-planning each week, to calling plays during the game. The UI at times is convoluted but you can do a crapload with this game."
nfl,3e2ohg,hobbes9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:11:48 2015 UTC,I got football manager 15 for 25 bucks so comparing it to that its significantly less advanced for the same price (ui especially)

nfl,3dzh9f,BlueTeamTV,311,Mon Jul 20 20:03:44 2015 UTC,"Instead of making another post, here's another Tweet from Darren.   ""Packers now have 360,760 shareholders who own shares that have no value & cannot be traded. Waiting list has hit 115,000 names.""  Check out @darrenrovell's Tweet: https://twitter.com/darrenrovell/status/623221350765719552?s=09"
nfl,3dzh9f,WillFight4Beer,257,Mon Jul 20 20:07:54 2015 UTC,"It's always been remarkable to me how well the Packer's ownership model works out. In most cities, the teams have to go to taxpayers whenever they need to build/improve stadiums. In GB, they essentially just invite anyone who would like to contribute funds to do so, and everyone's happy with the arrangement. The shareholders get to support their team, the team gets money, and people with no interest in the team aren't forced to pay anything.   Edit: as a couple other people have mentioned, apparently the Packers have still sought taxpayer funds in the past for significant renovations. So still not a perfect arrangement, then. TIL."
nfl,3dzh9f,ygaddy,79,Mon Jul 20 20:32:54 2015 UTC,"and people with no interest in the team aren't forced to pay anything   That's not true. There is a .5% sales tax in Brown County that was the primary source of funds for the big ~$300M expansion that took place in 2003.  There was a taxpayer referendum to approve that sales tax hike, and it only narrowly passed. Lambeau Field is actually owned by the city of Green Bay (not the team).  Long story short, stadium financing is just as convoluted in Green Bay as it is with any other pro sports facility."
nfl,3dzh9f,DanGliesack,16,Mon Jul 20 21:21:45 2015 UTC,"Most stadiums are owned by the cities and not the teams.  The difference in Green Bay is actually just that it's probably a pretty good deal there, whereas it's probably not a great deal for most bigger cities."

However, it only affected Brown county (where Green Bay is located) and has just recently been retired.  No question the Packers are less reliant on public funds than others, though."
nfl,3dzh9f,SensibleMadness,26,Mon Jul 20 21:34:11 2015 UTC,"It's a unique situation  that probably wouldn't work anywhere else.  The team has been there forever, and the city is small enough that there isn't a whole lot else going on.  The whole town's identity is wrapped up in the team, and almost every resident wants to keep it that way.  Without the Packers, nobody outside of Wisconsin would even know Green Bay existed.  There's really no other city that is so synonymous with its football team."
nfl,3dzh9f,faffri,26,Mon Jul 20 20:49:17 2015 UTC,"The only reason it worked for Green Bay and no other small towns that played in the NFL in the 20s and early 30s is because Green Bay was one of very few places in America where the economy grew stronger during the great depression. While all the other small town teams folded or moved to bigger cities (Lions for example) the booming paper industry in Green Bay ensured that the local businessmen could financially support the team in various ways and prevented them from moving permanently to Milwaukee where they already played some home games and continued to do until the mid 90s.  Just like the Packers had incredible supporters so did many other small market teams back then but the only thing that kept the Packers where it is now was it's geographical location. When the economy is collapsing, the number 1 priority isn't saving the local sports team playing in a league that wasn't that popular yet on the national level. Luckily for Green Bay they didn't need to worry about that then."
nfl,3dzh9f,chasingstatus,9,Mon Jul 20 22:04:23 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't it work anywhere else? Most teams in the NFL have pretty giant fan bases. Every team could easily be publicly supported. It would take a massive initial effort, but that money would be paid back to the fans in no time, because the NFL would now have the fans' interests at heart, instead of the owners. That means lower ticket prices, no blackouts, no more ref strikes or lockouts. Really, the only thing stopping this from happening is that cities built all these stadiums that they let the owners have control over. If new stadiums didn't have to be built, a completely public NFL would be the easiest thing in the world."
nfl,3dzh9f,jarsnazzy,7,Mon Jul 20 21:31:25 2015 UTC,The only thing stopping it is that the billionaire owners all got together and decided that no more teams were allowed to be owned by the fans.

nfl,3dzh9f,chasingstatus,4,Mon Jul 20 21:36:53 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think every NFL team could be like this. A few would have to move (looking at you Jacksonville), but most teams have enough fans willing to support them. People joke about how Packers fans are dumb for spending $250 for a piece of paper, but that money is coming from the state of Wisconsin anyway. This way it just comes from the people who actually enjoy Packers football. Plus, instead of an owner trying to squeeze every dollar out of the franchise, the Packers are still middle of the pack (was it 18th?) in ticket prices, despite having the highest demand in the league. Furthermore, every dollar of profit is either put back into the stadium or donated to charity.   It would take a HUGE concerted effort from municipalities across the country, but I believe an entirely public NFL could and should exist. Owners are so unnecessary in this league. They rarely add anything of value to the team (all they added is capital that could be provided by fans, as with the Packers) and they continually act against the best interests of players and fans, in order to line their pockets. I mean, fuck, the Packers have no great incentive to increase profits and they made $26 (or whatever the number was, close to that) million this year. Just imagine all the money that owners who only care about profit are making. That money could instead stay in our pockets, or go towards making sure that all stadiums remain up to date.   TL/DR: Owners are entirely unnecessary and probably the worst part about football."

Why? Because the NFL is all about branding and marketing...and with that comes the notion of ""perception is reality.""

(Just visit our sub during the season for all the ""I'm a fan of x team and will be at the Coliseum this Sunday; will i get stabbed?"" posts.) Is it unfair? Sure it is.

nfl,3dzh9f,Boyhowdy107,13,Tue Jul 21 00:13:01 2015 UTC,"people today are probably watching less actual TV with the advent of the internet.   And this is precisely why you'll continue to see sports TV revenues and their caps grow like gangbusters in the next few years. People are time-shifting with DVRs and streaming things online later to binge. So they are either fast forwarding through ads or watching the equivalent of a few 30-second ads which total to a lot less than if you watched it over the air.  Sports are a live event that 99% of the audience won't time shift. A few big TV shows are also live events, which is why networks are really trying to push Twitter hashtags and the second screen experience (i.e. stuff you consume simultaneously on your phone or laptop) because those things plus a fear of spoilers convince people to watch shows live and sit through the ads. But for the most part, sports are the only television property that delivers for advertisers the same kind of ad air space as was common for television a decade ago. So that makes it increasingly rare and valuable real estate, and that's why these TV deals for leagues are going up exponentially. And right as I finish writing all this out, I realize another guy who responded summed this up in a lot fewer words. Oh well."

The hubris of sports owners has always baffled me. They hold cities hostage trying to get unreasonable demands met but never seem to volunteer a profit-sharing system. They just reap all the rewards.

nfl,3e2pgl,rebelde_sin_causa,16,Tue Jul 21 14:32:57 2015 UTC,"I can see that perspective but I'm still not sure it's the best choice. It's so hard and unpredictable to win a Super Bowl that selling out for a 1 year run almost never works. The Ravens took 5 consecutive years of getting to the divisional round or further until they finally managed to get a ring. I think even in Buffalo's case, statistically, Tannehill gives them the most chances at a ring in the next 10 years and thus is their best bet.  edit: also, think you're slightly underestimating the Browns. They play in a very hard division top to bottom and with Brian Hoyer were in the thick of a playoff race last year. I think they're every bit as talented as Houston/Buffalo."
nfl,3e2pgl,Moruitelda,25,Tue Jul 21 14:38:30 2015 UTC,"The reason that Brady's the right answer for Buffalo is that they've assembled a rare collection of deep talent across the board, except at quarterback. If Brady comes into Buffalo, it's the best team in the NFL (on paper). I think the odds of Brady's Bills winning a Super Bowl in 2-3 years are at least as good as Tannehill doing it in 10, since the Bills are at what looks like a roster talent peak right now that's about to start withering away as great players move off rookie contracts and start eating up cap room.

I don't see the Bills having to restart financially in 2 years under that scenario.   I'd have to look further into it on spotrac or something.

I think of all the guys you mentioned losing McCoy would be the least worrisome for the Bills. I think Williams contract number will actually go down helping the team.

nfl,3e2pgl,Suddenly_Something,7,Tue Jul 21 15:08:44 2015 UTC,"I'm really kind of tired of hearing this narrative everywhere as a way to just blanket dismiss everything the AFCN did last season. I understand the North played relatively weak divisions, that doesn't change the fact the Browns played the Bengals, Ravens, Steelers(3 playoff teams) for 6 games last season while the Bills played the Pats, Jets, Dolphins for 6 and the Texans played the Colts, Jags, Titans for 6 games. I certainly know which of those 3 I would least want to face for half of my schedule.   So in reality the Browns played 8 playoff teams out of 16 games last season with another 2 games coming against 9-7 teams."
nfl,3e2pgl,Dorito-Dink_and_Dunk,5,Tue Jul 21 15:16:46 2015 UTC,"SOMEONE has to win intra divisional games.    The reason they Browns played 3 play off teams, was because those 3 teams won more games due to an easy schedule. Otherwise they likely wouldn't have been IN the play offs.   Take for example the AFCW.   The chiefs played this out of division schedule.   Rams, Cardinals, 49ers, Seahawks, Steelers, Titans, Jets, Bills, Dolphins, Patriots: 3/10 were below .500, 2 where .500. They finished 9-7, defeating both Super Bowl teams, but not making the playoffs because the Ravens and Bengals managed a single win more."
nfl,3e2pgl,Dorito-Dink_and_Dunk,5,Tue Jul 21 15:20:36 2015 UTC,So you're telling me in the last 4 seasons the fact that those 3 teams have made the playoffs a combined 9 times(out of 12 possible) is because they all just had easy schedules every single time? Okay.

The Bengals Played:  Bills, Jets, Dolphins, Patriots, Vikings, Lions, Bears, Packers, Chargers, Colts: 4/10 below .500, 3/10 at .400, 3/10 winning records.   The Ravens Played:   Bills, Jets, Dolphins, Pats, Viks, Lions, Bears, Packs, Broncos, Texans: 5/10 below .500, 3/10 at .500, 2/10 above .500.   2012: The AFCN played the AFCW and NFCE, they sent 2 teams to the playoffs,   The Bengals went 10-6 for a wild card birth.   Out of division the played:   Redskins, Eagles, Giants, Cowboys, Raiders, Chiefs, Chargers, Broncos, Jaguars, Dolphins. 6/10 below .500, 1 at .500, 3 above .500  2011: The AFCN played the AFCS and NFCW, they sent 3 teams to the playoffs.

nfl,3e2pgl,GGerrik,26,Tue Jul 21 14:42:51 2015 UTC,"But if Brady is on the Bills then that means Brady is no longer on the Pats, so the AFCE now shifts in the favor of the Bills. I take the biggest Superbowl chance I can get right now and have EJ learn under a veteran like Brady for a few years. The AFCE is a hard division for QBs because of those D-lines, so I'm not sure if simply transferring Tannehill to another team in the division would be that big of a difference."
nfl,3e2pgl,zk3033,7,Tue Jul 21 14:54:42 2015 UTC,"I hadn't really thought of the affect on other AFCE teams as a result. It would certainly set the Bills up the best, this season, when thinking in that perspective. May even put them far enough ahead to get a first round bye. I still think the long term solution is the best for a team but you made it a somewhat tougher decision in my mind."
nfl,3e2pgl,zombiebillnye,13,Tue Jul 21 14:59:15 2015 UTC,"Why? He hasn't even reached the playoffs with the Fins. Who says that the Bills will have a good All-around team in 3-4 years? Brady on the Bills this year would make them at least the heavy favorites to win the AFC. Dont get me wrong,Tannehill is a good QB,but there were other good QBs on good teams that didn't win the SB in the last years."
nfl,3e2pgl,HaruSoul,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:56:47 2015 UTC,It took him a few years to get better having limited experience at QB in college. I think last season was the best indicator of what you're getting out of Ryan in the next decade and the Dolphins were contending for a long time before an end of the season collapse.  I also think the Bills have a better roster than the Phins(sans quarterback) and a better head coach. I think with Rex Ryan and the young defensive pieces they have Tannehill would make them AFCE favorites for quite a while.
nfl,3e2pgl,HaruSoul,5,Tue Jul 21 15:01:03 2015 UTC,"Thats all true. But would they have that roster with a 100mio QB? They dont have to spend much money on the QB at the moment. They could probably not afford one of their DE/OLB otherwise etc etc..Brady would guarantee you a very good shot the next 2-3 years. Tannehill MIGHT do that for more years, but thats just not sure."

nfl,3e2pgl,Mustang1718,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:00:55 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Brady is a sure-thing that increases the talent of the group he is working with. Tannehill has been flying under the radar, but still hasn't quite proven himself.   Give me Brady so he can give us the LeBron effect. Both for the elite talent and for already having having the experience of making it to the top. That is very valuable. It's why we brought in guys like Whitner who have been to a Super Bowl.  You also mention young talent. They will develop quicker with this type of effect. And I would make an argument that we should be more in a win-now mode as some of our key guys such as Joe Thomas and Dansby are still going to be in their prime for the next 2-3 years. Your team can vary quite a bit over 10 years."

nfl,3e2pgl,PRE_-CISION-_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:58:25 2015 UTC,"When I think of us having Tannehill, I picture us being around the same level as the Chargers. Where they float around a wildcard spot each year and pick around the 20s. That actually makes it a bit tougher to keep your consistency as all the best players are down around the early picks. It's why the boom-or-bust doesn't scare me.  I have only been paying super close attention since the 2013 season, but I would say only the 2002, 2007, and 2010 teams showed a ton of promise over the last 15 years. Even thinking back to the ~2008-2012 eras makes me flinch. We've picked up some core pieces during that time, but that era is how  we our reputation. I don't think a Tannehill-type would have done much for us through there. We would be the current Raiders situation.

Kaepernick's across the body (and the field), wrist flick without setting his feet against the Rams was one of the most insanely difficult throws I've ever seen a QB make and it wasn't just that he made the throw - he made an ill-advised throw look easy.

Sometimes he has a beautiful deep pass, but his true strength is rocketing balls into small windows (ie stafford windows). Also, very few QBs have the pure arm strength to make throws from any angle like Stafford can. He is known for his sidearm for a reason.  A big reason Stafford hasn't turned the corner into becoming a great QB is that he trusts his arm too much and makes risky throws he shouldn't.   Bonus Stafford cannon gifs:   vs Falcons                                         vs Cowboys vs Bengals"

He also is still improving EDIT: Apparently I'm cross splicing Tannehill with someone else who has arm strength, but still, he reminds me a lot of Chad Pennington, which isn't a bad thing"
nfl,3e31k2,CashBunny,19,Tue Jul 21 16:05:50 2015 UTC,Cutler and Kaep have probably the two strongest arms in the game. best arm? really?

nfl,3e31k2,irspangler,11,Tue Jul 21 18:05:33 2015 UTC,Best arm? Are you kidding? He easily has the weakest arm out of the three.
nfl,3e31k2,seawied,2,Tue Jul 21 16:18:31 2015 UTC,"Nobody in the NFL has a stronger arm than Kaepernick. I feel pretty confident about this. Cutler is probably Top 5.  I know Tannehill has a good arm, maybe a great NFL arm. But Kaepernick and Ryan Mallett have probably the strongest arms in the NFL that I've seen. Then I'd go Newton/Cutler/Flacco followed by Stafford/Rodgers/Big Ben.  It would be really difficult to try ranking them. I'm obviously just doing it anecdotally, but Kaepernick and Mallett never seem to have any arc on their throws relative to their peers - the ball is a frozen rope almost every time."

Russell Wilson is a borderline MLB talent. But Kaep looks like he can throw 88-90+ mph heat from the mound. I have no idea what kind of command he has, but that's fucking incredible.   Throwing a football and throwing a baseball are too very different talents. The mechanics overlap in places, but baseball is a lot more arm-dominant. Plenty of QB's can throw heat in the NFL, but Kaepernick's arm is strong enough to throw heat in 2 different sports.  EDIT: Included link.  EDIT2: Russell Wilson throwing out a 75-mph first pitch at a Mariners game. The scoreboard coyly flashed 98 mph, but it was clocked at 75 mph. Russell may not be throwing as hard as he can, but he's still putting a lot into that throw."

I think the end of this season will solidly decide who would be a better franchise player."
nfl,3e31k2,Afalau,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:06:49 2015 UTC,"My issue with Kaep is how he seems to abandon the pass far too easy. You watch him drop back and when his first read doesn't work he starts scrambling. I think he could be the better QB if he can develop as more of a passer, because he has a great arm."
nfl,3e31k2,MyTime,15,Tue Jul 21 16:08:46 2015 UTC,"You watch him drop back and when his first read doesn't work he starts scrambling.   Old criticism is old.  He goes through his reads, but if the pocket starts breaking down a little bit, he'll start scrambling instead of sitting in the pocket for a bit longer. He's just not as calm in the pocket as Tannehill is."
nfl,3e31k2,Afalau,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:25:18 2015 UTC,"Old criticism is old? If it's still valid, is it old? He's likely to have a tough year this year, and many will fall from his bandwagon if they haven't already."

I think some improvements on the O-line, getting rid of Roman, and consistency in the weapons around him are going to make this a year where he really has to prove himself. If VD puts it together, Boldin is close to last seasons production, and Torrey Smith can stretch the field, I think we will see a more efficient Kaep."

nfl,3e31k2,JanuaryJoe5,3,Tue Jul 21 18:11:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah people on here get very worked up that I don't care for Tannehill. There's a few reasons.    For one, he is really inconsistent. Whenever he has a great game, he follows it up with a total dud (thinking of the wins against NE in Miami the last 2 years and going to Buffalo and laying an egg). Similarly, I find him super un-clutch. If Miami needs a game winning drive, I normally assume that won't happen. Also don't know how a QB doesn't take advantage of having Mike Wallace on his team.  People are also high on him from the Denver and Green Bay games this year but I'm not going to rain accolades on a QB for games that his team lost when he could've done more at the end. It's more intangible, but I just don't think he cares very much. I got this vibe from Hard Knocks. Stuff like not even knowing the divisions of football until he was in training camp. That doesn't make me think of a guy that beats himself up all offseason for not doing enough for his team because he clearly doesn't care that much about prestige from the NFL; he isn't a fan like someone like Eli is, it's a job for him. There's a difference between being cool on the field and just giving off a vibe of not really caring about the mark that he leaves. Cutler also doesn't seem to care too much, but I think he's more physically talented than Tanny and I'm not letting just this year get in the way of that.    So, that's about it. Just generally unimpressed by him. It's a very unpopular opinion here, but there you have it."

It's hard as fuck to do that with 5 people. By myself... No one cares. I just get up out of someone's seat if they claim it. With four other people it'd probably be a mess.

nfl,3e2s2d,jprovoj2,6,Tue Jul 21 15:58:35 2015 UTC,"The snap count timed perfectly is pretty much the essence of Polamalu. The Flacco strip sack sealed a HUGE game. But...BUT.  That pick against the Chargers. I...I'm going to try to break this down using only the English language, but I may need to hire a poet.   At the time of the tip Polamalu is approximately five yards from the ball running in the direction of the ball. I'd guess he was moving somewhere in the area of 90% of his max speed. His angle is towards the ball first, player second. His approach allows him to see that the ball is indeed tipped/hit away by two other Steeler defenders (Ike Taylor and someone I can't identify because apparently in 2008 they used potatoes instead of cameras).  He changes his approach towards the ball rather than the player and leaps to get his hand under it. His outstretched arm places his hand fingertips divine intervention of some sort under the ball as it is mere blades of grass from the ground. As he's doing so he realizes that his forward momentum is causing the ball to tilt away from him. He pulls his fingertips back towards himself as he causes a slight gravitational anomaly that bumps the ball back into his hand as he curls around it for the interception.  The above exchange transpired over the course of less than two seconds. TWO SECONDS. That road you drove on to get to work today? The engineer who designed it likely used a reaction time of 2.5 seconds to account for bad/old/inattentive drivers. This is approximately the reaction time of your average coma patient.  Polamalu saw the play unfold in front of him, reacted (correctly), and made one of the best interceptions of all time in the time it took Cell-Phone Mc-notpayingattention-Businessman to spill his coffee on his good work shirt, drop his Nokia Mjolnir through the floor of his car, and very narrowly avoid running over little Jimmy because he was chasing his ball across the street.  I'm going to miss seeing that hair fly around on the field this year so much..."

We were playing Minnesota and starting out our first year under Trestman. Hester had been really upset during the offseason, going as far as to consider retirement. He's noticeably different that season, starting off with a pedestrian week 1 and just seemed a bit... off.  Opening kickoff, Cordarelle Patterson runs it back for a 105 yard TD. I was pretty deflated and it seemed most of Soldier Field was as well.   Patterson kind of had a certain swagger scoring and you could tell as soon as Hester put on his helmet that is was a ""oh hell no this rookie isn't showing me up on my home field"" look in his eye. As soon as Hester gets on the field he's going fucking nuts. He's jumping in the end zone and suddenly turns around and starts pumping up the crowd and doing a ""this is my house"" thing with his hands. He turned around, slapped his helmet and was breathing like he just finished a marathon and ripped off an 80 yard return. It was the most hyped I'd ever seen him. It was like the dude snapped at the thought of anyone ever showing him up in his own stadium  He ripped off a huge 80 yard return and wound up with 249 returns yards that game with an average of 50 yards per return.  It was like an outpouring of emotion that I haven't seen before or since.   Plus, Cutler put up another clutch performance for the second week in a row and won it with 10 seconds left."

nfl,3e1uef,jfgiv,7,Tue Jul 21 13:52:44 2015 UTC,This is always to go to answer here and I agree it helps.   Just don't expect the stats or outcomes to line up. There's lots of Madden-born football fans that think a WR had a shitty game with 80 yards or a QB sucks if he throws for 3500 yards.   Don't even get me started on Madden off seasons.
nfl,3e1uef,westsideozzie,-4,Tue Jul 21 13:41:29 2015 UTC,"QB sucks if he throws for 3500 yards.   To be fair, in today's game that's a really bad total unless you're also threatening defenses with your legs."
nfl,3e1uef,ThePaddingtonBear,4,Tue Jul 21 14:53:20 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say it's really bad. Andy Dalton and Tony Romo aren't really bad.
nfl,3e1uef,westsideozzie,4,Tue Jul 21 15:10:31 2015 UTC,"Romo threw for 3700 yards and would have thrown for more had he not been backed by one of the league's best running attack. Dalton is Dalton. He's not terrible, but he's hardly anything to write home about."
nfl,3e1uef,ThePaddingtonBear,3,Tue Jul 21 15:16:05 2015 UTC,You're making my point. Romo isn't terrible and stat heads would look at 3700 yards as a sign he's no good.   You mention the rationale behind the stat and its 100% correct. If you only play Madden you miss those kinds of details.
nfl,3e1uef,westsideozzie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:33:04 2015 UTC,Romo isn't terrible and stat heads would look at 3700 yards as a sign he's no good.   No they wouldn't. Stat heads understand context. They're the ones who have been banging Romo's drum for years.
nfl,3e1uef,ThePaddingtonBear,6,Tue Jul 21 17:18:58 2015 UTC,This is a great suggestion. Madden is excellent for learning the rules of the game. Especially at first when the game can be a little confusing.

Playing an O-lineman really helped me understand what was going on in the trenches."
nfl,3e1uef,JB1549,54,Tue Jul 21 18:07:41 2015 UTC,As an NFL fan not from the U.S. (Australia represent!) I found the best way to get into American football is a combination of the Madden video games and playing Fantasy whilst watching a few games here and there. Both teach you player names and give you a basic understanding of positions and rules. Plus with a couple of mates it can be a great deal of fun
nfl,3e1uef,RyanWithPants,17,Tue Jul 21 09:12:41 2015 UTC,Also from Australia and agree with all of this. The NFL game pass is also (kind of) cheap and you can watch any of the games live or delayed. The rules are kind of hard to grasp at first but the referees and commentators do a reasonable job at explaining what is happening.
nfl,3e1uef,mkyle12,10,Tue Jul 21 10:49:07 2015 UTC,fantasy football definitely increased how closely I follow the sport.  That is good advice.

nfl,3e1uef,Necroluster,24,Tue Jul 21 11:10:13 2015 UTC,The Bears do not have a relatively small fan base. Every Chicago team has a huge following due to it being at top 5 (if not top 3) market.
nfl,3e1uef,BucsCapacitor,3,Tue Jul 21 12:11:26 2015 UTC,Some teams feel like they are in a smaller market because of having less internet presence and not winning much over the last few years.  Bears probably have a bigger following than seattle but if I went by what I read off the internet I would assume seattle is one of the biggest NFL teams.
nfl,3e1uef,phileagles,4,Tue Jul 21 16:56:24 2015 UTC,"I haven't been a Bears fan for very long mind you, but wherever I go online people call the Bears irrelevant and used-to-be. That may not be very fun, but I feel the fans I talk to really love the team, and that attracts me. I have no idea how Chicagoans and Americans in general feel about the Bears though. It seems the Bears are always in the shadow of the Blackhawks."
nfl,3e1uef,Necroluster,7,Tue Jul 21 12:21:04 2015 UTC,"It is indeed a good time to become a Bears fan and not be called a bandwagoner, I don't deny that. But to call them a small fan base is like calling the Cubs a small fan base. Even though they've been a miserable franchise for over 100 years, they still are a top-5 fan base (when looking at the merch they sell). They are historical, and they are in one of the largest cities in America.  If you go to a Bears game in Tampa (which I unfortunately am doing this year) you will see that Bears nation is strong. Half the stadium will be Urlacher jerseys.  Bucs, Panthers, Jaguars, Titans, Texans...THOSE are teams with relatively small fan bases."

But, say if you were a young kid, and you had never heard Norwegian before, then someone spoke to you in Norwegian, could you kind of understand it? That would be pretty cool.  Also, I'm not sure if I'm in the minority, but out of the Scandinavian languages, Danish seems the easiest to interpret as a native English speaker. I don't know if that is due to having Jutlanders settling much of Britain back in the day, but it does seem like their grammar is easier to interpret than Swedish. Or maybe I'm just a silly moron."

These are just trolls, usually, but I don't think people outside the fan base understand why the score is the way it is and it can confuse you when you first watch.   List of ways to score points, lowest to highest:   PAT (Point after Touchdown) - 1 point - basically guaranteed, but can be missed or blocked Two-point conversion - 2 point - instead of going for a PAT, the team decides to try for 2. They have to get in the end zone again for it to be successful. If they don't, they get no points other than the Touchdown. Safety (offense gets tackled inside their own endzone) - 2 points - Offense gets tackled inside own end zone. Sometimes can be for different reason, like a penalty, but most of the time it's getting tackled in the end zone.  Field Goal - 3 points - Team decides to try for 3 using their Kicker. Usually happens when team is on opponents side of the field and it is 4th down or time is almost out in the half. Here's a video of infamous missed field goals Touchdown - 6 points - When one team gets the ball across the opponents goal line while maintaining possession of the oddly shaped ball.

nfl,3e1uef,FreshRain,3,Tue Jul 21 12:11:01 2015 UTC,"It's a very easy sport to get into. There are only games three nights of the week (Thursday, Sunday, and Monday) and Thursday/Monday usually only have one game per week.   If it's available, I would suggest getting NFL Game Rewind. You can watch the games at your own pace (especially nice given the time zone discrepancy.) I worked most Sundays last year, so it was nice to be able to sit down and watch games on my day off, provided I could avoid spoilers for a day or two.  If you can, watch with friends or family. Football is a great communal sport. In fact, that's a lot of its charm. Since it's really easy to keep track of the entire league (compared to say, hockey or baseball, where the frequency and scheduling of games makes it a task just to keep up on your own team, let alone the whole league) so it's easy to be on the same page as other viewers. 'Game day' is its own mini holiday every week. A lot of fans have rituals. Don't worry too much about having 'your' team at first. It's part of the design of professional sports to want to have someone you root for, but if you try to use deductive reasoning to find a favorite team, you might find yourself jumping ship frequently. Just watch a wide spread of teams, if possible, and someone will rise to the top. Since there are so few games in a football season, each game carries more statistical weight, that is, it makes up a larger percentage of the season. A bad football game is worth 1/16th of the year, whereas a bad baseball game is worth 1/162nd of the year. So emotions between teams run high, and rivalries are more intense in football than I think in any other professional sport in the US. Once you find a team, you'll more importantly find the three or four or five or thirty-one teams you just absolutely hate. Don't be afraid to ask questions, especially here. Football fans love to share their knowledge, since we're all so brilliant and should be coaching. It's a complicated, intricate game with a lot of subtleties and nuances that may take years to pick up on. 'Chess with giants' is the conventional turn of phrase."
nfl,3e1uef,vadkert,3,Tue Jul 21 12:48:55 2015 UTC,"This video was made before the SuperBowl (the ""final championship game"") a few years ago and is IMO a great and entertaining intro to the sport.

You can watch through Gamepass which costs around 250€ per season or try the VPN trick: Gamepass is free in Argentina and the Netherlands.   They are going to show 2 games per week on German freeTV (ProSieben Maxx) this season, so you might get that by Satellite dish."

nfl,3e1uef,Usedbeef,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:36:46 2015 UTC,"One thing extremely casual fans don't understand (AKA my girlfriend, mom, and grandmother) is that 90% of games are played Sunday.   There is 1 game on Thursday night.  This is like ""friday junior"" the work week is almost done, you can drink and watch the game knowing the next day is Friday.  Sunday is THE DAY.  You better have off work and have nothing to do.  Usually about 5-7 games start at 1pm EST and 5-7 games start after they end around 4pm EST.  Then after those games end, there is the Sunday night game.  This is the finale to a great sunday funday.  Then Monday night is 1 final game.  It sucks to go to work Monday, but that night you can unwind and watch the final NFL game of the week.  If you want to get frisky, bet a game.  Place $25 or something and watch the entire game.  It makes it much more interesting.  Pick a favorite team, I suggest the Philadelphia Eagles.  They have never won a Superbowl and are definitely the most interesting teams coming into this season.  They have a 3rd year coach who has implemented a new style of coaching consisting of ""sports science"" and a constant ""hurry-up"" offense.  They play fast, little time between plays.  Also the coach (Chip Kelly) also released some of the biggest, highest profile players...and then signed other high profile players from other teams...reshuffling the core of the entire team."

No national pastime has been documented as well as NFL Films has documented American Football.  iTunes is a great (paid) source as they have a section for every team.  They do a weekly recap after each game and an annual one for every season.  Watch the ones of the teams you are interested in.  It is a great source of history to see the rivalries such as the Bears - Packers, Cowboys - Redskins, etc. Welcome to the NFL!"

Visiting the various 49er and Seahawk msg boards, and listening to the sports radio shows for the two cities over the past few years confirms to me that these two fan bases very much dislike one another.  That is a rivalry, no matter how recent it is.  I ""hate"" the 49ers the most right now, but I also still ""hate"", and have ""hated"" longer the Broncos and the Raiders."

Arguably the best two teams in the league, with recent HCs that had a history (and beef) in college, with very similar styles of play (top defenses) and with very young, athletic QBs.  And two cities that are, generally speaking, close to one another geographically. I remember the 2013 season clearly, and honestly the 49ers were the only team I really feared.  And as such, I hated them.  I suspect many other Seahawk fans felt the same way, and I'm guessing many 49er fans felt that way as well.  At it all together and that is a rival.  A new rival, and maybe not a long term rivalry, but the mutual dislike was very real."

nfl,3e384y,guga31bb,16,Tue Jul 21 16:48:07 2015 UTC,"Is this really that bad? I recognize I'm biased, but this was a pretty great game that came down to the wire, plus its a conference championship between two division rivals in a rivalry that was really starting to heat up.  It probably doesnt deserve to be top 20, mind you, but I don't think recency bias is the only reason this is high."
nfl,3e384y,thepikey7,3,Tue Jul 21 17:27:51 2015 UTC,"I would say that was the climax of the rivalry.  Two great teams, two coaches with a history, players that hate each, an offseason of matching roster moves. The older rivalry teams can talk about their historic rivalries but none had such a heated single season against each other like that."
nfl,3e384y,Pksoze,6,Tue Jul 21 18:21:53 2015 UTC,"Eh, when you said yesterday people would be livid about the placement of the game I was expecting a lot worse than this. This was a great NFCCG and made up for the dud earlier in the day and the dud that was to come in 2 weeks (and the divisional weekend was a real dud too)."
nfl,3e384y,Fig_Newton_,4,Tue Jul 21 17:44:55 2015 UTC,"I don't see what the problem is.    Stakes: winner goes to Super Bowl Personal drama: culmination of Carroll-Harbaugh, Sherman-Crabtree, 2 teams from same division meeting in conference championship game Star players: the last time Willis-Bowman would ever share the field, Justin Smith, Boldin, Davis, Gore, A Smith, Lynch, Sherman, Thomas, Chancellor Back and forth game, neither team was ever in total control, game came down to last posession   This (yes, extremely homer-iffic) post lays out an argument for being one of the best postseason games of all time."

I think those( minus the last two and SB 38 nd Idk what Giants-Niners game you're talking about so I'm DQing that one too.) are all great pivotal games and deserve their place above it on the list. But you're ignoring how crucial this game was and everything built up around it  the Hawks and Niners had both been fucking garbage for quite a few years before they got their coaches. Then they built two monster teams. The Coaches hate eachother. Every game was heated. Two young QBs. Two Staunch defense. Sherm's rant. If you give it ten years, twenty years, you're going to remember his rant. That play. It's the most memorable game of this decade so far.   EDIT: And that hurt to say coming from a guy who ""Can't Wait!"".

I thought before the game, and I still feel that the winner of that game was going to win the SB.  If the 49ers win, I'm not saying they beat the Broncos 43-8 (I don't think the Seahawks would either in a rematch), but I do believe the 49ers would have beaten the Broncos probably 7 out of 10 times.

I also don't know the dudes name, I don't think anyone really does, so how would he be systematically held out of jobs? People are salty at MJ, I mean if I was a fan of the other teams back in the day maybe I would be too.

They seem to bounce between admiration for the job done, criticism of the running back, praise for the O-Line, and credit to the running back.  Reading through the lines I think he is saying a better running back would have gotten 2,500 yards.  But he had BETTER lines and never whiffed that, so I am just keep scratching my head.  Once you dissect his words here, I think in an attempt to be PC he has criticized everyone and contradicted himself numerous times."
nfl,3e2cyk,TwoChe,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:59 2015 UTC,"I think some points to consider.  Emmitt praised Demarco all last season  Emmitt said he would pay to keep Demarco in the offseason  All running backs leave yards on the field.  I don't know if it's safe to say it was 2500 yards worth as Demarco made plays other running backs couldn't.  But Demarco missed holes, and his speed wasn't breakaway.  I think he's praising the o-line.  And hyping up the current cowboys rbs saying 'hey, there's yards out there for you to get'   Emmitt has never had a way with words (see his television career), but the dude has always been humble.  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt that he wasn't trying to slight DeMarco."
nfl,3e2cyk,DYELBro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:03:56 2015 UTC,I don't know if he is saying a better running back would have gotten 2500 but watching demarco last year there were plenty of times he could have gotten more yards but he always seemed to try to run over/through defenders instead of going around them. I think that is probably the same thing Emmitt and Randle are seeing when they talk about leaving meat on the bone last year.
nfl,3e2cyk,dumasymptote,0,Tue Jul 21 18:28:57 2015 UTC,Your last sentence is a misunderstanding of the point I was making.
nfl,3e2cyk,SharksFanAbroad,-6,Tue Jul 21 15:43:19 2015 UTC,Why do you assume that about Michael? Lebron is nowhere near his legacy.
nfl,3e2cyk,JegnomeSimpson,15,Tue Jul 21 14:44:45 2015 UTC,LeBron is above Kobe's in most ways.
nfl,3e2cyk,Lyndell,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:47:38 2015 UTC,Eh I get where /u/jegnomesimpson is coming from though. I'd still put LeBron outside of my top 5 all time personally. He'd be right there with Kobe and Bird. He hasn't overcome Jordan or Russell or Magic etc etc in my eyes and thats not including guys that I don't think get a fair shake like Wilt. You wanna talk all time talent he's probably the best basketball player ever. Production he's probably getting right next too top 5. Championships he's still not top 10 despite being able to get there pretty easily.
nfl,3e2cyk,axle69,2,Tue Jul 21 15:24:17 2015 UTC,"My top three are LeBron, Wilt and Jordan simply as the greatest players to play. Legacy wise Jordan is above the rest. But I think you have a team with those guys you're eventually going to win a ring."
nfl,3e2cyk,Lyndell,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:29:27 2015 UTC,No way LeBron is a top 3 NBA guy already.
nfl,3e2cyk,TwoChe,5,Tue Jul 21 15:51:11 2015 UTC,He's been in the league for about 12 years.
nfl,3e2cyk,Lyndell,2,Tue Jul 21 15:57:14 2015 UTC,And the best player for about 5-7 of those years.  Kobe was the best player for about a decade and I dont have him in my top 3. Only getting 2 titles out of that HEAT team was terrible.  They themselves thought it was a dynasty.  They were stacked and should have lost to no one those first 3 years.  Losing to the Mavs in 2011 should be a forever blemish on his legacy.  He has too many big time let downs like that.
nfl,3e2cyk,TwoChe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:17:47 2015 UTC,"It was questionable till Lebron hit his prime, KG, Tim Duncan all could be considered. I personally give the nod to KG."
nfl,3e2cyk,Lyndell,0,Tue Jul 21 16:23:45 2015 UTC,"And I guess in my mind I dont expect LeBron to the best player in the league ever again.  He is going to start having those save it for the playoffs seasons.  Late 20's is usually when players go super hard.   I dont see LeBron winning another MVP, and I dont see him getting a title with Cleveland in the next 2 years at least.  If he a shot at a title he will have to leave Cleveland and team with a super squad to make it happen.  So if he ends his career with 2 titles, 2 finals MVPs and 4 MVP's I would not put him top 3 all time."
nfl,3e2cyk,TwoChe,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:33:51 2015 UTC,Kobe was never the best player in the NBA at any point. For most of his success he wasnt even the best player on his team.  Late 90/00s Shaq. mid 2000's Duncan/Garnett late 00's-now LeBron.
nfl,3e2cyk,ACPhila,2,Tue Jul 21 16:56:15 2015 UTC,LeBron hasnt been the best player in the league either of the last 2 seasons.
nfl,3e2cyk,TwoChe,0,Tue Jul 21 17:02:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I didn't say anything against that though. Jordan's legacy is 100 times what Lebron's is. He put a league on the map, basically made Nike. Untold billions, man. He's untouchable."
nfl,3e2cyk,JegnomeSimpson,0,Tue Jul 21 15:38:05 2015 UTC,"At what point do championships start to count? Yeah, Lebron's great, but he only has two championships at the end of the day. That's all that matters..."

nfl,3e2cyk,Lyndell,21,Tue Jul 21 18:50:43 2015 UTC,"well, Barry could have easily had 2500 more total rushing yards than Emmitt.  All he had to do was not retire too young."
nfl,3e2cyk,NiceSasquatch,4,Tue Jul 21 14:06:50 2015 UTC,I don't think any sane person would argue against that.
nfl,3e2cyk,keanex,11,Tue Jul 21 15:41:59 2015 UTC,"And he needed to play behind something that resembled an offensive line. If he had the line Smith ran behind, god damn."
nfl,3e2cyk,CravingToast,4,Tue Jul 21 14:23:59 2015 UTC,Sanders had an ok runblocking line
nfl,3e2cyk,herpendatderp,2,Tue Jul 21 16:32:38 2015 UTC,"Sanders holds the NFL record for most carries for negative yards. If he had anything that was remotely close to what Smith ran behind, his legacy would be untouchable."
nfl,3e2cyk,CravingToast,10,Tue Jul 21 16:35:37 2015 UTC,His running style is why he had so many negative yards
nfl,3e2cyk,LincolnHigh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:13:12 2015 UTC,His running style existed because lanes collapsed too quickly. He had to be shifty to get positive yards.
nfl,3e2cyk,CravingToast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:51 2015 UTC,"No, he was shifty because he was always looking for the home run and not taking the single that was right in front of him."
nfl,3e2cyk,lethalcure1,5,Tue Jul 21 19:02:46 2015 UTC,"Sanders would have averaged 8ypc and rushed for 3,000 yards.   Not really, but it wouldn't have been crazy farfetched."
nfl,3e2cyk,keanex,11,Tue Jul 21 15:42:42 2015 UTC,But what would he do in game 2?
nfl,3e2cyk,poohster33,0,Tue Jul 21 17:28:07 2015 UTC,"Could've taken hits better too. Damn, I get really tired of this conversation."
nfl,3e2cyk,thenatesummers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:39:06 2015 UTC,I mean you had to know that one was coming. Can't have Emmitt say something a bit ridiculous and not have it returned with a similar scenario in regards too him.
nfl,3e2cyk,axle69,2,Tue Jul 21 15:25:56 2015 UTC,It's definitely ridiculous.
nfl,3e2cyk,thenatesummers,-3,Tue Jul 21 15:29:18 2015 UTC,"2500 yards isn't ridiculous? Ok well my man A Rod is gonna throw 65 TDs next year, but only if he wants to."
nfl,3e2cyk,Balticataz,12,Tue Jul 21 16:59:01 2015 UTC,"I saw some opportunities there that was left on the football field where he could’ve had 2,500 yards...   Like if every right read was made? Every block executed? Every step placed perfectly? Every slight grab and stumble avoided? Yeah maybe. But that's true with every player on every down."
nfl,3e2cyk,keanex,4,Tue Jul 21 14:00:24 2015 UTC,"Demerco would cut plays shorter than necessary because he liked contact, many times with his own blockers even. I am appreciative of the season he had but he rarely made a defender miss open field, rather he'd run right into them."
nfl,3e2cyk,keanex,6,Tue Jul 21 15:44:12 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with that, but also how many times did that running style get him more yards, pushing up field rather than dancing around. It's just a vague/hard to measure subject."
nfl,3e2cyk,Shart_Film,3,Tue Jul 21 17:01:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not suggesting dancing around, but attempting a cut in the open field wouldn't hurt."
nfl,3e2cyk,cdoink,3,Tue Jul 21 17:15:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and I freakin love that about him."
nfl,3e2cyk,PMeist,2,Tue Jul 21 17:35:00 2015 UTC,"I'm a Cowboys fan but I find this whole meat left on the bone theory a bit ridiculous. DeMarco had a tremendous season. Were there instances where he left yards on the table? Probably. But make no mistake, there were also instances where he created yardage that other backs probably wouldn't have by driving through contact and fighting for extra yards. At the end of the day, he is a great player and he will be missed. That's not to say he can't be replaced, but to belittle his accomplishments is foolish and pointless."
nfl,3e2cyk,Capn_Cook,11,Tue Jul 21 18:25:33 2015 UTC,"According to Emmitt Smith, Murray left a lot of meat on the bone."

nfl,3e2cyk,IMLOwl,10,Tue Jul 21 14:07:42 2015 UTC,"""DeMarco, you had a great season, but I could have done it better"""
nfl,3e2cyk,Runna4life,30,Tue Jul 21 12:42:22 2015 UTC,"The fact that Smith ran behind a line with 30 combined Pro Bowls and never got 1800 yards proves that no, he couldn't have."
nfl,3e2cyk,IMLOwl,-4,Tue Jul 21 13:15:54 2015 UTC,"Well, in 1993 he rushed for about 1,500 yards with over 100 less carries. While averaging 5.3 YPC. Let's say he crashes and burns and gets 4 yards per carry on his next 110 carries (which would put him at 392, like Murray) that puts him at 1,926 yards  which puts him over Murray. Let's say he got 110 more carries and averaged around 4.9 YPC, which is much more likely than 4 yards per carry. That puts him at 2025 yards.   Conclusion: In 1994 if Smith had been given more opportunities he would have been way over what Murray did. Don't blame him for not rushing for more than Murray when he didn't get the same amount t of opportunities."
nfl,3e2cyk,Runna4life,6,Tue Jul 21 14:35:40 2015 UTC,In 3 other season he had in the high 300s in carries and didn't beat 1845.
nfl,3e2cyk,IMLOwl,-4,Tue Jul 21 14:41:13 2015 UTC,"That's not a fair way to judge it. I used both the 4th seasons of their careers. Demarco could bust and never go over 1000 yards again. Does that mean he's better than Emmitt because of that single season? No. He could rush for 1800 yards for 10 more years. Does that mean he's better? Yes.   My point is in the same season of his career, if Emmitt hadn't gotten injured he's have easily taken Demarco's record."
nfl,3e2cyk,TwoChe,9,Tue Jul 21 14:52:46 2015 UTC,"It's not a question of who is better. Emmitt Smith is a hall of fame player. It's a question of a hall of fame player making ridiculous statements about another guy failing to do something impossible when even he, with arguably the best line in history, was unable to get even close to it."
nfl,3e2cyk,MonkeyInATopHat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:54:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and he is still 500 short with your favorable analysis.  Assuming he doesnt break down.  While you responded to a paraphrased quote, the real goal for him to reach is 2,500 yards.  Because that is the mark Emmitt mentioned.And while this O-Line is great, his was even better.  1990's Cowboy O-Line was GOAT"
nfl,3e2cyk,Runna4life,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:52:31 2015 UTC,"Or it's totally possible that all those extra carries lead to an injury and he doesn't.  Hypotheticals are dumb.  He got what he got, no more or less."
nfl,3e2cyk,Rays8JenningsFan,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:53:05 2015 UTC,"No, the reason he didn't get all those other carries was because of an injury."

nfl,3e2cyk,JACJet,-6,Tue Jul 21 13:58:58 2015 UTC,"STRONG hater. What, are you saying Emmitt Smith isn't a great RB?"
nfl,3e2cyk,amart824,4,Tue Jul 21 14:46:02 2015 UTC,"If he truly left no meat on the bone (trust me I went back and reviewed the tape) he could have scored a touchdown on the first play of every single one of their 179 drives. Assuming they all started on the 20, that's 179 carries at 80 YPC for 14,320 yards, and yet he could only manage a meager 2253 yards or 2 whole kilometers from scrimmage.

nfl,3e2cyk,Shart_Film,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:36:14 2015 UTC,2105 is a hard number to beat. But some things gotta break right.   You have to be a super running back in PEAK FORM You have be ready EVERY WEEKEND. you tune out one week and the record attempt will be up in smoke.

nfl,3e2cyk,Nexus369,3,Tue Jul 21 16:56:35 2015 UTC,"Just upvoted you.   I wouldn't be surprised if Eagles fans are annoyed at those comments - anyone would be over their team's newly acquired, prized FA. But that doesn't take away from the fact that a former (great, franchise) player is making assenine assertions that he could have done it better when (A.) he never did despite (B.) having a better line, during an era where (C.) teams were passing much less and (D.) his QB was less efficient than Tony was the given year.  I realize all Emmitt is good at anymore is stringing together unintelligible sentences, dancing, and repping the star, but he should shut his mouth and stick to the latter two while not detracting from another Cowboy's success."

It's hard as fuck to do that with 5 people. By myself... No one cares. I just get up out of someone's seat if they claim it. With four other people it'd probably be a mess.

In most cities, the teams have to go to taxpayers whenever they need to build/improve stadiums. In GB, they essentially just invite anyone who would like to contribute funds to do so, and everyone's happy with the arrangement. The shareholders get to support their team, the team gets money, and people with no interest in the team aren't forced to pay anything.   Edit: as a couple other people have mentioned, apparently the Packers have still sought taxpayer funds in the past for significant renovations. So still not a perfect arrangement, then. TIL."

There is a .5% sales tax in Brown County that was the primary source of funds for the big ~$300M expansion that took place in 2003.  There was a taxpayer referendum to approve that sales tax hike, and it only narrowly passed. Lambeau Field is actually owned by the city of Green Bay (not the team).

The whole town's identity is wrapped up in the team, and almost every resident wants to keep it that way.  Without the Packers, nobody outside of Wisconsin would even know Green Bay existed.  There's really no other city that is so synonymous with its football team."
nfl,3dzh9f,faffri,26,Mon Jul 20 20:49:17 2015 UTC,"The only reason it worked for Green Bay and no other small towns that played in the NFL in the 20s and early 30s is because Green Bay was one of very few places in America where the economy grew stronger during the great depression. While all the other small town teams folded or moved to bigger cities (Lions for example) the booming paper industry in Green Bay ensured that the local businessmen could financially support the team in various ways and prevented them from moving permanently to Milwaukee where they already played some home games and continued to do until the mid 90s.  Just like the Packers had incredible supporters so did many other small market teams back then but the only thing that kept the Packers where it is now was it's geographical location. When the economy is collapsing, the number 1 priority isn't saving the local sports team playing in a league that wasn't that popular yet on the national level. Luckily for Green Bay they didn't need to worry about that then."
nfl,3dzh9f,chasingstatus,9,Mon Jul 20 22:04:23 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't it work anywhere else? Most teams in the NFL have pretty giant fan bases. Every team could easily be publicly supported. It would take a massive initial effort, but that money would be paid back to the fans in no time, because the NFL would now have the fans' interests at heart, instead of the owners. That means lower ticket prices, no blackouts, no more ref strikes or lockouts. Really, the only thing stopping this from happening is that cities built all these stadiums that they let the owners have control over. If new stadiums didn't have to be built, a completely public NFL would be the easiest thing in the world."
nfl,3dzh9f,jarsnazzy,7,Mon Jul 20 21:31:25 2015 UTC,The only thing stopping it is that the billionaire owners all got together and decided that no more teams were allowed to be owned by the fans.

nfl,3dzh9f,chasingstatus,4,Mon Jul 20 21:36:53 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think every NFL team could be like this. A few would have to move (looking at you Jacksonville), but most teams have enough fans willing to support them. People joke about how Packers fans are dumb for spending $250 for a piece of paper, but that money is coming from the state of Wisconsin anyway. This way it just comes from the people who actually enjoy Packers football. Plus, instead of an owner trying to squeeze every dollar out of the franchise, the Packers are still middle of the pack (was it 18th?) in ticket prices, despite having the highest demand in the league. Furthermore, every dollar of profit is either put back into the stadium or donated to charity.   It would take a HUGE concerted effort from municipalities across the country, but I believe an entirely public NFL could and should exist. Owners are so unnecessary in this league. They rarely add anything of value to the team (all they added is capital that could be provided by fans, as with the Packers) and they continually act against the best interests of players and fans, in order to line their pockets. I mean, fuck, the Packers have no great incentive to increase profits and they made $26 (or whatever the number was, close to that) million this year. Just imagine all the money that owners who only care about profit are making. That money could instead stay in our pockets, or go towards making sure that all stadiums remain up to date.   TL/DR: Owners are entirely unnecessary and probably the worst part about football."

That's seriously a load of bull.
nfl,3dzh9f,Mongo_Straight,2,Tue Jul 21 02:17:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it wasn't all that impressive. Granted, it was only the initial proposal and there's likely a lot going on behind the scenes, but the prognosis isn't good as it stands now.   However, and this is purely my own crackpot/tinfoil-hat speculation without any sources to back it up, I could see the NFL working with the Raiders and Oakland to get something done behind the scenes. Why? Because the NFL is all about branding and marketing...and with that comes the notion of ""perception is reality."" People that aren't Raider fans generally associate the Raiders' time in L.A. with the gang/criminal element that still haunts them to this day. (Just visit our sub during the season for all the ""I'm a fan of x team and will be at the Coliseum this Sunday; will i get stabbed?"" posts.) Is it unfair? Sure it is. But that's still a popular  opinion and the NFL knows this. If When the NFL comes back to L.A., they're going to want to hit all the target audiences: corporate types, families, folks with lots of disposable incomes, etc. The Raiders' reputation, unfair or not, may threaten that.  TL;DR: Who the hell knows?"
nfl,3dzh9f,TheFakeTomTelesco,23,Tue Jul 21 03:10:17 2015 UTC,"Nope.  Need to pay the ~200million for player salaries, staff, operating costs for the stadium, old loans, taxes/fees, etc.  When it's all said and done, the $10 million jump from last year's ""splitting of the pot"" should cover the salary cap increase and little else.... leaving... well... our tiny, tiny ticket sales to cover expansion into a $1Billion stadium."

I'm sure there is more revenue for an NFL football team than ticket sales after all the dust settles.  Also how ""tiny"" are you ticket sales. According to this you sold 93% of your tickets for home games last year, but I don't really see how percentages matter for gross revenue. You sold more total tix than Indy and Pittsburgh."

nfl,3dzh9f,Boyhowdy107,13,Tue Jul 21 00:13:01 2015 UTC,"people today are probably watching less actual TV with the advent of the internet.   And this is precisely why you'll continue to see sports TV revenues and their caps grow like gangbusters in the next few years. People are time-shifting with DVRs and streaming things online later to binge. So they are either fast forwarding through ads or watching the equivalent of a few 30-second ads which total to a lot less than if you watched it over the air.  Sports are a live event that 99% of the audience won't time shift. A few big TV shows are also live events, which is why networks are really trying to push Twitter hashtags and the second screen experience (i.e. stuff you consume simultaneously on your phone or laptop) because those things plus a fear of spoilers convince people to watch shows live and sit through the ads. But for the most part, sports are the only television property that delivers for advertisers the same kind of ad air space as was common for television a decade ago. So that makes it increasingly rare and valuable real estate, and that's why these TV deals for leagues are going up exponentially. And right as I finish writing all this out, I realize another guy who responded summed this up in a lot fewer words. Oh well."

The hubris of sports owners has always baffled me. They hold cities hostage trying to get unreasonable demands met but never seem to volunteer a profit-sharing system. They just reap all the rewards.

nfl,3e2pgl,rebelde_sin_causa,16,Tue Jul 21 14:32:57 2015 UTC,"I can see that perspective but I'm still not sure it's the best choice. It's so hard and unpredictable to win a Super Bowl that selling out for a 1 year run almost never works. The Ravens took 5 consecutive years of getting to the divisional round or further until they finally managed to get a ring. I think even in Buffalo's case, statistically, Tannehill gives them the most chances at a ring in the next 10 years and thus is their best bet.  edit: also, think you're slightly underestimating the Browns. They play in a very hard division top to bottom and with Brian Hoyer were in the thick of a playoff race last year. I think they're every bit as talented as Houston/Buffalo."
nfl,3e2pgl,Moruitelda,25,Tue Jul 21 14:38:30 2015 UTC,"The reason that Brady's the right answer for Buffalo is that they've assembled a rare collection of deep talent across the board, except at quarterback. If Brady comes into Buffalo, it's the best team in the NFL (on paper). I think the odds of Brady's Bills winning a Super Bowl in 2-3 years are at least as good as Tannehill doing it in 10, since the Bills are at what looks like a roster talent peak right now that's about to start withering away as great players move off rookie contracts and start eating up cap room. Tannehill gives you a second shot after another rebuild, but Brady gives you the best shot with the talent that's already assembled."

Once they shed McCoy's absurdly large RB contract that opens up quite a bit of money to retain Watkins and their defensive pieces. Tannehill's cap number is also very friendly for a franchise QB. I don't see the Bills having to restart financially in 2 years under that scenario.   I'd have to look further into it on spotrac or something. If it was financially prohibitive and it would cause a rebuild, wasting a good 3-4 years of Tannehills prime seasons, then I would agree Brady may be the better option."

McCoy's not going to be the problem. Hughes, Mario Williams, Dareus, Bradham, Cordy Glenn, and Stephon Gilmore are going to be the problems.   Plus, if you shed McCoy, that's losing one of the key elements that makes the offense so dangerous."
nfl,3e2pgl,SeanJuan,0,Tue Jul 21 15:07:46 2015 UTC,Running backs are replaceable with late first/high second round picks. I think of all the guys you mentioned losing McCoy would be the least worrisome for the Bills. I think Williams contract number will actually go down helping the team. I can't imagine Glenn or Bradham would cost a ton of money. If the Bills managed to keep Dareus and Gilmore under contract they should be fine.
nfl,3e2pgl,batman0615,3,Tue Jul 21 15:12:34 2015 UTC,I think Williams contract number will actually go down helping the team.   If he decides to restructure.    I can't imagine Glenn or Bradham would cost a ton of money.   NFL teams appreciate their value more than your average fan. Glenn will probably demand at least $8M/year and Bradham might break $6M/year. They're very much underrated contributors to this team.

Le'veon Bell, Gio Bernard, Eddie Lacey, Jeremy Hill. There's been tons of good running backs in the 2nd or later the past few years. Cherry picking a couple exceptions doesn't make that untrue. Running backs easily have the best bust ratio of all major skill positions right now."
nfl,3e2pgl,MG_III,2,Tue Jul 21 15:20:45 2015 UTC,"Cherry picking?!  That's literally two out of three of the last #1 drafted RBs.

nfl,3e2pgl,Moruitelda,2,Tue Jul 21 15:24:26 2015 UTC,The last 2 years the running backs selected in the first two rounds have been:  Bishop Sankey(Jury out/bad pick)  Jeremy Hill(Good pick)  Carlos Hyde(Jury out)  Gio Bernard(Great pick)  Leveon Bell(Great pick)  Montee Ball(Jury out/bad pick)  Eddie Lacey(Great pick)  That's a minimum of 4 out of 7 being very good players.

I certainly know which of those 3 I would least want to face for half of my schedule.

Take for example the AFCW.   The chiefs played this out of division schedule.   Rams, Cardinals, 49ers, Seahawks, Steelers, Titans, Jets, Bills, Dolphins, Patriots: 3/10 were below .500, 2 where .500.

I take the biggest Superbowl chance I can get right now and have EJ learn under a veteran like Brady for a few years. The AFCE is a hard division for QBs because of those D-lines, so I'm not sure if simply transferring Tannehill to another team in the division would be that big of a difference."

Brady on the Bills this year would make them at least the heavy favorites to win the AFC. Dont get me wrong,Tannehill is a good QB,but there were other good QBs on good teams that didn't win the SB in the last years."

I think last season was the best indicator of what you're getting out of Ryan in the next decade and the Dolphins were contending for a long time before an end of the season collapse.  I also think the Bills have a better roster than the Phins(sans quarterback) and a better head coach. I think with Rex Ryan and the young defensive pieces they have Tannehill would make them AFCE favorites for quite a while.
nfl,3e2pgl,HaruSoul,5,Tue Jul 21 15:01:03 2015 UTC,"Thats all true. But would they have that roster with a 100mio QB? They dont have to spend much money on the QB at the moment.

Tannehill has been flying under the radar, but still hasn't quite proven himself.   Give me Brady so he can give us the LeBron effect. Both for the elite talent and for already having having the experience of making it to the top. That is very valuable. It's why we brought in guys like Whitner who have been to a Super Bowl.  You also mention young talent. They will develop quicker with this type of effect. And I would make an argument that we should be more in a win-now mode as some of our key guys such as Joe Thomas and Dansby are still going to be in their prime for the next 2-3 years.

Where they float around a wildcard spot each year and pick around the 20s. That actually makes it a bit tougher to keep your consistency as all the best players are down around the early picks. It's why the boom-or-bust doesn't scare me.  I have only been paying super close attention since the 2013 season, but I would say only the 2002, 2007, and 2010 teams showed a ton of promise over the last 15 years. Even thinking back to the ~2008-2012 eras makes me flinch. We've picked up some core pieces during that time, but that era is how  we our reputation. I don't think a Tannehill-type would have done much for us through there. We would be the current Raiders situation.

That was about a 15 out of 10 on the difficulty scale.  Stafford is a MUCH better touch passer and is a more accurate QB overall. But I've yet to see anyone with a stronger arm than Kaepernick save maybe Ryan Mallett...maybe."

I never ever want to see him do this again, but at least he can do it.   There's also this one:  https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rGhoNG7rBrS-CHNpK1aks4ToM8E=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2442746/kaepbomb.0.0.gif  And also my favorite throw by him: https://usatthebiglead.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/vernon-davis-td-catch-and-wall-crash.gif  If it's true that he overhauled his mechanics, he may be able to do some special things. Of course that's complete homerism by me. But if he's capable of throws like that last one, where it seems like half his body is heading towards the sideline, then a refined Kap something I can get aboard."

I don't think you watch Stafford very much since he really doesn't have that great of a deep ball. Every time pff stats are posted for deep balls he tends to be below average. Sometimes he has a beautiful deep pass, but his true strength is rocketing balls into small windows (ie stafford windows). Also, very few QBs have the pure arm strength to make throws from any angle like Stafford can. He is known for his sidearm for a reason.  A big reason Stafford hasn't turned the corner into becoming a great QB is that he trusts his arm too much and makes risky throws he shouldn't.   Bonus Stafford cannon gifs:   vs Falcons                                         vs Cowboys vs Bengals"

nfl,3e31k2,seawied,2,Tue Jul 21 16:18:31 2015 UTC,"Nobody in the NFL has a stronger arm than Kaepernick. I feel pretty confident about this. Cutler is probably Top 5.  I know Tannehill has a good arm, maybe a great NFL arm. But Kaepernick and Ryan Mallett have probably the strongest arms in the NFL that I've seen. Then I'd go Newton/Cutler/Flacco followed by Stafford/Rodgers/Big Ben.  It would be really difficult to try ranking them. I'm obviously just doing it anecdotally, but Kaepernick and Mallett never seem to have any arc on their throws relative to their peers - the ball is a frozen rope almost every time."

Russell Wilson is a borderline MLB talent. But Kaep looks like he can throw 88-90+ mph heat from the mound. I have no idea what kind of command he has, but that's fucking incredible.   Throwing a football and throwing a baseball are too very different talents. The mechanics overlap in places, but baseball is a lot more arm-dominant. Plenty of QB's can throw heat in the NFL, but Kaepernick's arm is strong enough to throw heat in 2 different sports.  EDIT: Included link.  EDIT2: Russell Wilson throwing out a 75-mph first pitch at a Mariners game. The scoreboard coyly flashed 98 mph, but it was clocked at 75 mph. Russell may not be throwing as hard as he can, but he's still putting a lot into that throw."

nfl,3e31k2,JanuaryJoe5,3,Tue Jul 21 18:11:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah people on here get very worked up that I don't care for Tannehill. There's a few reasons.    For one, he is really inconsistent. Whenever he has a great game, he follows it up with a total dud (thinking of the wins against NE in Miami the last 2 years and going to Buffalo and laying an egg). Similarly, I find him super un-clutch. If Miami needs a game winning drive, I normally assume that won't happen. Also don't know how a QB doesn't take advantage of having Mike Wallace on his team.  People are also high on him from the Denver and Green Bay games this year but I'm not going to rain accolades on a QB for games that his team lost when he could've done more at the end. It's more intangible, but I just don't think he cares very much. I got this vibe from Hard Knocks. Stuff like not even knowing the divisions of football until he was in training camp. That doesn't make me think of a guy that beats himself up all offseason for not doing enough for his team because he clearly doesn't care that much about prestige from the NFL; he isn't a fan like someone like Eli is, it's a job for him. There's a difference between being cool on the field and just giving off a vibe of not really caring about the mark that he leaves. Cutler also doesn't seem to care too much, but I think he's more physically talented than Tanny and I'm not letting just this year get in the way of that.    So, that's about it. Just generally unimpressed by him. It's a very unpopular opinion here, but there you have it."

nfl,3e2s2d,jprovoj2,6,Tue Jul 21 15:58:35 2015 UTC,"The snap count timed perfectly is pretty much the essence of Polamalu. The Flacco strip sack sealed a HUGE game. But...BUT.  That pick against the Chargers. I...I'm going to try to break this down using only the English language, but I may need to hire a poet.   At the time of the tip Polamalu is approximately five yards from the ball running in the direction of the ball. I'd guess he was moving somewhere in the area of 90% of his max speed. His angle is towards the ball first, player second. His approach allows him to see that the ball is indeed tipped/hit away by two other Steeler defenders (Ike Taylor and someone I can't identify because apparently in 2008 they used potatoes instead of cameras).  He changes his approach towards the ball rather than the player and leaps to get his hand under it. His outstretched arm places his hand fingertips divine intervention of some sort under the ball as it is mere blades of grass from the ground. As he's doing so he realizes that his forward momentum is causing the ball to tilt away from him. He pulls his fingertips back towards himself as he causes a slight gravitational anomaly that bumps the ball back into his hand as he curls around it for the interception.  The above exchange transpired over the course of less than two seconds. TWO SECONDS. That road you drove on to get to work today? The engineer who designed it likely used a reaction time of 2.5 seconds to account for bad/old/inattentive drivers. This is approximately the reaction time of your average coma patient.  Polamalu saw the play unfold in front of him, reacted (correctly), and made one of the best interceptions of all time in the time it took Cell-Phone Mc-notpayingattention-Businessman to spill his coffee on his good work shirt, drop his Nokia Mjolnir through the floor of his car, and very narrowly avoid running over little Jimmy because he was chasing his ball across the street.

We were playing Minnesota and starting out our first year under Trestman. Hester had been really upset during the offseason, going as far as to consider retirement. He's noticeably different that season, starting off with a pedestrian week 1 and just seemed a bit... off.  Opening kickoff, Cordarelle Patterson runs it back for a 105 yard TD. I was pretty deflated and it seemed most of Soldier Field was as well.   Patterson kind of had a certain swagger scoring and you could tell as soon as Hester put on his helmet that is was a ""oh hell no this rookie isn't showing me up on my home field"" look in his eye. As soon as Hester gets on the field he's going fucking nuts. He's jumping in the end zone and suddenly turns around and starts pumping up the crowd and doing a ""this is my house"" thing with his hands. He turned around, slapped his helmet and was breathing like he just finished a marathon and ripped off an 80 yard return. It was the most hyped I'd ever seen him. It was like the dude snapped at the thought of anyone ever showing him up in his own stadium  He ripped off a huge 80 yard return and wound up with 249 returns yards that game with an average of 50 yards per return.  It was like an outpouring of emotion that I haven't seen before or since.   Plus, Cutler put up another clutch performance for the second week in a row and won it with 10 seconds left."

nfl,3e2j2i,g00dn1ghtm4r3,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:03:54 2015 UTC,"Doubt the addition of Maclin does that much for you. Last year was a career year for him that he likely won't reproduce, especially not as the only WR in Kansas City worth talking about and with Alex Smith under center."
nfl,3e2j2i,4thdontcare,10,Tue Jul 21 15:17:07 2015 UTC,You really think that the jump from bowe to maclin isn't huge? Maclin is the exact kind of reciever that Smith loves to throw to.
nfl,3e2j2i,sumo_kitty,-3,Tue Jul 21 15:32:47 2015 UTC,"It's not huge. You're overrating Maclin based on a career year in a better offense.   That's how big name free agency works. You buy the career year and you get the average, which bluntly isn't much better than what you were getting out of Bowe.   Worse, he's still the only WR worth starting on your roster, which means the perimeter coverage can focus completely on him. The odds he'll be anywhere close to as productive as he was last year are very small."
nfl,3e2j2i,4thdontcare,6,Tue Jul 21 15:47:12 2015 UTC,They also have to focus on Travis Kelce and DAT will begin to play out of the slot this year.

nfl,3e2j2i,PWL73316,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:59:30 2015 UTC,"Kelce and Charles, sure, but Maclin has never been more than a moderately above average WR. He come off a career year in a high volume offense. He's not going to a high volume offense, especially for WRs. Alex will hit Kelce deep more than Maclin because he doesn't trust throwing it outside to a WR unless the DB is completely out of position."

nfl,3e2j2i,olig23,6,Tue Jul 21 15:33:07 2015 UTC,"I like the Chiefs, they've got so much going for them. But I wonder if they are going to find themselves in the same situation that the 49ers did, perhaps to a lesser extent.  Specifically, as much as the stats look good I think Alex Smith limits that team. It was the same in San Francisco. He can't throw the deep ball and as far as I can tell has never really been able to. Does everything else very well, but that's a limiting factor. It brings the whole defence closer to the LOS and makes each drive need to be methodical and long. Which by simple law of averages means that those drives end in punts more often.  Obviously, while Harbaugh's decision to move on from him was bold, and got them to a Super Bowl I think it's also apparent that the Chiefs do not have a young player like Keapernick knocking on the door to take over. So they will stay with Smith, and should.  Regardless, they have a very strong D. that's a given in my mind. They're getting close to that stage where everything is in place except the QB. Not many teams can say that."
nfl,3e2j2i,ReturnOfTheStormHawk,9,Tue Jul 21 13:49:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's also apparent that the Chiefs do not have a young player like Keapernick knocking on the door to take over   Wasn't Murray not too far outside of the 2nd round in mock drafts before he did his ACL? Theoretically, history could repeat itself."
nfl,3e2j2i,materhern,7,Tue Jul 21 13:59:28 2015 UTC,"Before his ACL, Murray was considered a mid to late second rounder that would need some developing but had a lot of potential.  Then the ACL.

nfl,3e2j2i,IIHURRlCANEII,12,Tue Jul 21 14:18:00 2015 UTC,"I think this year will be the year if we see if Smith can do it.  He now has the best WR he has ever had, he still has Charles, and now Kelce is the TE1.  If our line is just average he will have around him the best offense he has ever had."
nfl,3e2j2i,4thdontcare,11,Tue Jul 21 14:54:54 2015 UTC,"Alex can throw the deep ball, you just have to scheme it so he doesn't have to make a difficult coverage read between the snap and the throw. If you can set up the read pre-snap, it's golden, but any read post-snap and it's a whole different story.   While he is incredibly intelligent, he doesn't process information very quickly so he very often needs to see the open before he makes a throw rather than throw it based on anticipation of open based on the coverage read and the route leverage.   As you go further down-field, that gets more and more problematic due to the flight time of the ball. He can make those throws, we've all seen examples of it, but in this league you are the player that the majority of your plays says you are, not what the exceptional ones say.   Granted, it's not so easy to set up these just put it up there where our guy gets it or nobody gets it throws, which is why defenses can focus even more on the intermediate game and force him to dink dunk down the field with 4 yard curls, which as you have mentioned means you end up punting quite a bit and relying on the defense for field position and your kicker for points."
nfl,3e2j2i,sillyhatday,4,Tue Jul 21 14:54:09 2015 UTC,"The real limiting factor for us and the rest of the AFCW is that a deity plays QB for Denver. You have two losses you can write off of your schedule right off the top. They're going to win 11 games at a minimum, and likely more. I laugh at all the Manning fall-off chatter. I'll believe it when I see it. Even if he does regress some, Manning at 80% is still an all-galaxy QB. I think you're looking at 13-3 as the minimum threshold to win the division."

nfl,3e245d,impactblue5,2,Tue Jul 21 15:01:46 2015 UTC,"The issue with Rivers is the possible relocation of the team. If that's settled, he'll re-sign, no question. And I don't doubt they stay in SD. They're not moving, or they'd be talking about it with the Rams not the Raiders.   With Weddle, he's making a big stink so he can get a bigger contract. It's just negotiation crap. Nothing to worry about there either, his agent is just telling him to seem like he's unsatisfied and willing to leave, so he'll get more money.  No worry on either front. They'll both be back, I have no doubt."
nfl,3e245d,sportsmcgee,5,Tue Jul 21 15:49:15 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't see Rivers finishing somewhere else, dude has been the face of the franchise for a decade now. Hopefully something gets done."
nfl,3e245d,denvertebows15,3,Tue Jul 21 12:36:03 2015 UTC,"I said the same thing with Peyton and now he's my division. At the end of the day we want the great ones to stick with one team. Heck I wanted LT and Junior to be a Charger for life, but that didn't happen. My brain couldn't compute seeing Junior in a Dolphins uni for the first time."
nfl,3e245d,FirstThings1st,3,Tue Jul 21 17:56:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you got a point. Never would I've thought Manning would be in a Broncos uniform or LT in a Jets one."
nfl,3e245d,Corosis,3,Tue Jul 21 18:01:51 2015 UTC,I don't think Rivers is gonna sign a deal as long as the Chargers are still planning to move to LA unless they get a new stadium deal in San Diego. He's been pretty vocal about not wanting the team to move.
nfl,3e245d,impactblue5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:55:03 2015 UTC,He could get a contract that is relatively even on a year-to-year basis or have an opt-out if traded or the team moves. Thus he can retire if he can't plan in San Diego anymore.
nfl,3e245d,denvertebows15,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:46:29 2015 UTC,I think he would rather pressure the FO by not signing anything until a stadium deal gets done. He has all the leverage here.
nfl,3e245d,JennerUntucked,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:24:10 2015 UTC,Honestly wish he was more publicly vocal to put more pressure on the team to work with the city of SD.
nfl,3e245d,cooleymahn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:58:17 2015 UTC,Me too I think it's real shitty that teams use LA as a tactic to get their grubby mitts on taxpayer money and then keep all the profits. If I had the money I'd just start my own team in LA and tell the rest to fuck off and stop using it as a tactic.

nfl,3dzr7c,TheSlinger,6,Tue Jul 21 01:54:51 2015 UTC,Lee Smith is the guy and no he'll likely just be another blocker. We drafted Clive Walford outta Miami who is more of a complete TE. He gets me all gooey so I think he'll start.

nfl,3dzr7c,recoverybelow,6,Tue Jul 21 00:38:48 2015 UTC,Marquez North and Croom have the size. Malone could be something special too.  We're good. The legacy is still alright.
nfl,3dzr7c,CheddarJalapeno,10,Tue Jul 21 01:15:30 2015 UTC,"Hunter started off incredible and just became more and more underwhelming over time. There was a brief period (2011 before the injury) when he looked like one of the best receivers I had ever seen. I don't think he had any problems with the physical recovery, but he just didn't have a great attitude and just underachieved from there."
nfl,3dzr7c,VariousLawyerings,9,Mon Jul 20 22:25:15 2015 UTC,"You think he looked good then, you should find highlights of his first year at UT before he tore his ACL. Probably the most dynamic receiver we'd had in the 2000s. Such a waste of talent."
nfl,3dzr7c,Methuga,6,Tue Jul 21 00:44:07 2015 UTC,He and Patterson were supposed to herald in a new era of UT as WRU. :(
nfl,3dzr7c,jethanr,6,Tue Jul 21 00:58:04 2015 UTC,Shhh on the WRU thing. This isn't a good time for that. Might be some Clemson fans around here
nfl,3dzr7c,CheddarJalapeno,4,Tue Jul 21 01:16:43 2015 UTC,"And Rogers, too. On one hand, it would have been amazing to see the three of them on the same field together. On the other hand, that might have saved Dooley's job. He was in his ""I'm literally not going to recruit anymore"" phase by the start of the 2012 season, so that would have set us back even longer."
nfl,3dzr7c,VariousLawyerings,4,Tue Jul 21 02:22:40 2015 UTC,"No doubt about it. I was at UT from 2010 to 2013, so I got to follow Hunter's career trajectory a little too closely :(  Literally the worst possible time to become a Tennessee football fan."

nfl,3dzr7c,bleedblue89,12,Mon Jul 20 22:35:14 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, by the time we play Mizzou I'm basically blackout drunk/ depressed until the regular season is over. I have no idea if he did well against us or not. Though I do vaguely recall Matty Mauk going like 7/25 and beating us or some horseshit like that?"
nfl,3dzr7c,Palchez,4,Mon Jul 20 23:04:37 2015 UTC,"If you think that was bad, you should've seen us against Florida this past year. Mizzou had 119 yards of offense, including Mauk going 6-18 with 20 passing yards.  And Mizzou won 42-13."

nfl,3dzr7c,Slippery_Nips_,121,Mon Jul 20 21:18:20 2015 UTC,Maybe it time to throw a 1yr contract at Reggie Wayne.
nfl,3dzr7c,New__York__Bozo,98,Mon Jul 20 21:40:01 2015 UTC,Or James Jones?  He's 5 years younger than Wayne and hasn't really had any severe injuries.
nfl,3dzr7c,SeantotheRescue,39,Mon Jul 20 21:44:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Jones seems like a good fit. Solid possession receiver to help out with a core of young receivers. I'm glad the Raiders had him last year"
nfl,3dzr7c,RoswellSpaceman,30,Mon Jul 20 22:05:15 2015 UTC,"How has nobody signed him yet? He's a very solid WR. Hell, I wish the Eagles would cut Cooper and bring Jones on board as a slot receiver."
nfl,3dzr7c,New__York__Bozo,26,Mon Jul 20 23:00:25 2015 UTC,"It boggles the mind.  He lead the league in touchdowns a few years ago and hasn't really had a notable injury, and he's only 31.  You'd think the Seahawks are hungry enough for receivers to at least bring him in for camp.  The only thing I can think of is he's getting fucky with negotiations like he did with us before going to Oakland instead."
nfl,3dzr7c,You_coward,5,Mon Jul 20 23:22:46 2015 UTC,"To be fair it was a very strange leading the league in TDs. It was the most inconsistent display ever, but I guess it worked."
nfl,3dzr7c,New__York__Bozo,3,Tue Jul 21 05:07:45 2015 UTC,"At the end of that season if someone told you that he'd have been cut from a team, then never picked up by anyone going into 2015 without any injuries or off the field issues, you'd call bullshit though, right?"
nfl,3dzr7c,MegatonMessiah,3,Tue Jul 21 05:50:39 2015 UTC,"Definitely one of the stranger moves (or, lack thereof) of the off-season so far."
nfl,3dzr7c,ZaalbarsArse,11,Mon Jul 20 23:20:47 2015 UTC,we picked up a fair donkload of receivers this offseason so i reckon well be fine
nfl,3dzr7c,Slippery_Nips_,4,Mon Jul 20 22:14:34 2015 UTC,"Adds: Nicks, Douglas, DGB.  Nicks: past his prime with hope of a resurgence. He can be a solid ball catcher.  Douglas: a solid 3 or 4 option, not an impact player.  DGB: a very high ceiling. I've followed his career since high school and this kid can play. The question remains is if he can stay on the field. He could be the savior of the receiver core.  Still have: Wright, Hunter , D. Walker.  Walker: arguably the best player on the roster last year.  Wright: a rising star at the slot if he can get a guy to throw him the ball. Hopefully mariota.  Hunter: likely gone, at least a suspension.   What Wayne would give you:   Super Bowl Champion Experience and a careers worth of work with Manning which could help the development of Mariota. Also, a guided hand in cleaning up DBG. A 3 WR set of Nicks-Wright-Wayne with Walker at the TE. That would be a tremendous help for Mariota in the passing game. It would allow DBG to get less attention and run open to open spaces as a big target. You also have to worry about his health, but if he was the #1 receiver then it would be a larger concern.   The only other option is James Jones, as aforementioned by some above in the thread."

nfl,3dzr7c,bburchibanez,11,Tue Jul 21 13:56:44 2015 UTC,"He is honestly not horrible, just underwhelming. We didn't need to force the ball to him, so it didn't happen. He very well could be solid for you guys. Just don't expect him to ever get any separation. Any burst that he had is gone."
nfl,3dzr7c,steve_millers_joker,2,Mon Jul 20 21:36:29 2015 UTC,I think right now he's sitting somewhere around the 4th-to-5th spot on the depth chart assuming Hunter is out of the conversation. So he was going from most likely not making it to having a decent shot now that he's not competing against a much younger/bigger/faster player. I hope he can come in and contribute on special teams like we had Derrick Hagan do last year.

So one day, I was shooting at one of the side goals at the TRECS just minding my own business jacking up threes and chasing my rebounds. Unlike most days, many of them were going in, and I guess this caught the attention of Ja'Wuan James and Zach Fulton because they asked me if I wanted to be on their team. Obviously I said yes, and they said they had some friends coming. One by one, their friends arrived, and the two teams shook out like this:  Ja'Wuan James, Zach Fulton, Jordan McRae, Kenny Hall, and me  vs.  Trae Golden, Cam Tatum, Justin Hunter, Jarnell Stokes, and Da'Rick Rodgers  It was so surreal.

A rising star receiver, a rookie with massive boom/bust potential, a serviceable number 3, and some veterans along with a low drafted player who can make an impact."

No one is mentoning him, but I always thought this guy would be a solid starter in a number of other teams other than Falcons. When Julio was injured for almost a whole year, Douglas was massive. So he's more than a solid WR3, he's actually a great WR2 option as well."

None of his acquisitions from his first two drafts panned out to be amazing players; most had short careers. He's improved on this since then, essentially drafting the whole Legion of Boom and building a strong Super Bowl contender in 5 years' time.  Harbaugh has only missed the playoffs once with the Ravens. I like the consistency and fight he brings to games."
nfl,3e370g,DCMurphy,15,Tue Jul 21 16:49:08 2015 UTC,Pete also had little say over the roster during his time in New England.

Aside from Curtis Martin leaving, the team was largely the same talent-wise. Admittedly, our star WR also went to IR that year.  Carroll is a great coach, but given his history in New England I don't think I'd want him over Harbaugh."
nfl,3e370g,DCMurphy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:53 2015 UTC,Carroll admitted that he didn't have his philosophy as hammered out and sold well enough to the players until a year or two in USC. Fair to say that he's vastly different now than pre-2000s Carroll.
nfl,3e370g,Shitty_Thesis,7,Tue Jul 21 18:52:10 2015 UTC,"Just to play Devil's advocate, I wonder if Browns fans would say the same about Bill Belichick, who coached them from 1991-1995, and compiled a record of 36-44, with only one winning season.    Seems like both Belichick and Carroll have learned from their prior mistakes and improved."
nfl,3e370g,MegaRAID01,8,Tue Jul 21 17:32:05 2015 UTC,His lack of success was more of a knock on Kraft IMO. He said himself that it took him a while to become a hands off owner and that's when we really saw success. Pete was the tail end of the Kraft hands-on era.
nfl,3e370g,browndudeman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:54:07 2015 UTC,"Was Kraft that hands-on as far as drafting goes? I think I remember the opposite from Holley's Patriot Reign, but I could be mistaken."
nfl,3e370g,DCMurphy,3,Tue Jul 21 16:56:37 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Kraft stuck his nose in all personnel decisions until Pete left. Parcells and him never got along for that reason. Terry Glenn was Kraft's choice in 96 (I believe), and Parcells was publicly displeased."

Kraft is on record saying one of his biggest regrets was not letting Pete control personnel. Holding him responsible for those draft picks is really uninformed.
nfl,3e370g,seafoamstratocaster,8,Tue Jul 21 17:34:26 2015 UTC,"I take Harbaugh. One of the big reasons is age, Harbaugh is 52 and Carroll is 63. But besides that, Harbaugh has been to 3 AFC Championships, won 1 Super Bowl and his teams have never had a losing record. Harbaugh is actually the coach in the NFL I'd want most if Belichick were to retire."

I can only say that what Carroll's done with the Seahawks is amazing. Seattle used to be where football died and now it is one of (if not)  the most complete teams out there and a very serious contender year after year. I know it's not all on him but you know what I mean.  John Harbaugh on the other hand has also displayed an amazing record of consistency and success. The Ravens simply cannot be taken out of the equation season after season, come injuries, free agency or whatever you want, Baltimore is always a tough team.  I'd take Harbaugh (John!) over Carroll only because I would really like to punch his face."

Pete only signed a two year extension on his previous contract, which runs out at the end of 2016.    Still love Pete so much, and from a personnel/drafting perspective, he probably does more for the Hawks than Harbaugh does for the Ravens, though I am not sure."
nfl,3e370g,MegaRAID01,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:05:37 2015 UTC,Isn't Pete the oldest coach in the league?  Or pretty close with Coughlin.  I doubt either has much longer left.  I can't imagine the toll the stress of running an NFL team into your 60s puts on your body.

nfl,3e370g,thequietone710,3,Tue Jul 21 18:25:36 2015 UTC,"I'd take John for the Patriots because I believe it would be a smoother transition for the team.   Everything I've read about Pete's style is that he's a players coach and more on the Rex Ryan side of things than the Belichick side of things.   Having a roster that's been under Belichick, I'd prefer to keep things on this side of the spectrum and that's why I think John makes the most sense. He'd be able to come in and as he's had a plethora of OCs under him already, I believe we'd be able to keep McDaniels under him and continue the offense along the same vein we've had.   It would be an interesting transition. Though taking Harbaugh from the Ravens makes the AFC that much easier to win."
nfl,3e370g,GGerrik,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:16:10 2015 UTC,John Harbaugh. He's has kept his team competitive through massive roster changes and several coordinator changes.   Carroll has built a great team but he hasn't proven that his team can maintain that high level of play after his core players leave/take up most of his cap.
nfl,3e370g,McRawffles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:42 2015 UTC,"I think it's very well a toss-up either way. You can't argue with the results that either have produced.

nfl,3e32sz,Dude4445,2,Tue Jul 21 17:07:42 2015 UTC,I see your point. Just the Chiefs in my mind didn't throw a Td to receiver lay year and we were never really close when playing against each other. I don't really see how they have improved much either. I think our defense is vastly improved and people really underestimate the difference with Kubiak calling the plays.

I could see them running a lot more, and Peyton's stats going down a bit, but him still playing really well.  I think the Broncos have the opportunity to absolutely kill it this next year.  I realize its been SB or bust the last couple years, but I won't be surprised in the least bit if they represent the AFC this year."
nfl,3e32sz,Lurkalo,3,Tue Jul 21 16:44:16 2015 UTC,"I think that one of the benefits to Kukiak's offense being fused with Manning's is, ironically, giving us a better shot at beating your Patriots. Forsett was reall doing some damage in the playoff game. I think with a running game to work as a crutch against the Pats defense and BB's usual mastermind game plan, we have a better shot at beating NE than we've had in the last few years."

It's more of the function that states can't legalize weed because there's a federal statute directly illegalizing weed.

nfl,3e2xq0,Upuser,4,Tue Jul 21 18:18:21 2015 UTC,"From my team's perspective?  Defense, defense, defense, and more defense.  I know, there's been a lot of hype about the passing game, but who the Hell knows?  Quarterback's a rookie, don't tell me about sure things until they've done it.  Like in the pros.  Where it matters.  But the defense?  Well, we've got a defense-first coach whose philosophy is a variation of something that has the team's name on it.  Have two of the best defensive players in football today.  Signed a bunch of people over the last two years who should be a really good fit.    Make no mistake, how the Bucs improve or stagnate this year rests on the defense.  Any best-case scenarios definitely do, anyway."
nfl,3e2xq0,LansdowneStreet,2,Tue Jul 21 15:40:21 2015 UTC,"You've gotta be excited about that offense man. Jameis with all those skill players and a draft of almost entirely offensive players. I hate the Bucs but if I were a Bucs fan, man I'd be pumped. Y'all are setting Jameis up for success. I fear y'all. Maybe not Sept 20, but the Dec 13 game will be different."
nfl,3e2xq0,liftbrah21,3,Tue Jul 21 15:43:22 2015 UTC,"You've gotta be excited about that offense man.   The best two players on the team are on defense.   Y'all are setting Jameis up for success.    One problem:  We already expect him to be great.  RIGHT AWAY.  As someone who takes exactly zero stock in college football as a feeder system to the NFL, I'm dubious.  However, I know Lavonte David's great and I know Gerald McCoy's great.  And as a Bucs fan I also know what a damn great defense looks like."
nfl,3e2xq0,LansdowneStreet,2,Tue Jul 21 15:53:08 2015 UTC,"I'd be excited for Mike Evans. With a competent QB, he could easily be an elite receiver."
nfl,3e2xq0,Suddenly_Something,2,Tue Jul 21 15:55:40 2015 UTC,"Oh I like Evans, and I like the idea that we might run the football what with our four RBs (even if the running game is dying, sadly).  But if you're asking me what I'm most looking forward to, well, our coach is a defense guy, our best two players play defense, the best teams we ever had were dominated by defense...I mean where else would I look?"
nfl,3e2xq0,LansdowneStreet,3,Tue Jul 21 16:00:48 2015 UTC,"As an aside, what are your feelings on Bobby Rainey? I don't really watch the Bucs, but admittedly have picked up Rainey in fantasy before and he seems to kill it when he's given the touches. I know Sims was a bit of a disappointment last year, but still seemed to get the start over someone like Rainey. Does he just have a low ceiling, or is there something else I'm missing?"
nfl,3e2xq0,Suddenly_Something,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:06:42 2015 UTC,"I know Sims was a bit of a disappointment last year   Um, he had no offensive line and was hurt when we drafted him, what part of that is disappointing again?  Rainey is a football utility man.  A Brock Holt type if you will.  He was the best kick returner we had last season, got plenty of carries as a running back, and served as a gunner on the punt team.  I like Rainey, but as far as starting him he's probably the fourth of our four RBs."
nfl,3e2xq0,LansdowneStreet,2,Tue Jul 21 16:22:07 2015 UTC,"what part of that is disappointing again?   Like I said, I don't watch the bucs much. I'm simply going by his stats. 2.8 Y/C and 185 yards over 8 games doesn't really fly off the page at you, but he looks pretty good as a pass catching back. I get his personal stats probably don't tell the whole story obviously."
nfl,3e2xq0,Suddenly_Something,2,Tue Jul 21 16:38:22 2015 UTC,"There is one extremely important fact about last year's Tampa Bay Buccaneers that I feel a need to remind people about:  Our offensive coordinator showed up for exactly 0/16 games last season.  He had a stent (outpatient heart procedure) a couple of days before the season and never came back.  So in addition to a crappy line and Sims coming off a major injury, he was getting plays called for him by a first-year quarterbacks coach that was forced to take on OC duties days before the season started.  We'd seriously have been better off with a kid calling plays out of Madden."
nfl,3e2xq0,LansdowneStreet,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:04 2015 UTC,"Ah, well this is something I didn't know, thanks. From what you saw last year, do you think Martin is a lock for the starter position at RB or do you think it will be more of a competition?"
nfl,3e2xq0,Suddenly_Something,2,Tue Jul 21 16:43:48 2015 UTC,"Make no mistake, how the Bucs improve or stagnate this year rests on the defense. Any best-case scenarios definitely do, anyway.   I couldn't disagree more. This offense was 30th or worse on every front. Minimal improvement on offense will help the Bucs improve. The defense was actually pretty good after the debacle that occurred in Atlanta.   New OC Dirk Koetter working with Winston is the thing I'm most excited for, this could be the first true Franchise QB in Bucs history. If thats not exciting, I dont know what is."
nfl,3e2xq0,BobLbLawsLawBlg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:19:38 2015 UTC,"If thats not exciting, I dont know what is.   Honestly, I refuse to have any opinion on Winston until he plays football I consider at all relevant, which through no fault of his own he has not yet had the opportunity to do."
nfl,3e2xq0,LansdowneStreet,2,Tue Jul 21 16:20:41 2015 UTC,"I mean he can't be worse than this:  http://files.shandymedia.com/images/body/thefumble/tearsofmccown.0.gif  I'm a Gator fan through and through - it was difficult for me to get on board with Winston. As the draft process went forward, there was little doubt that he was the best QB available. He has an understanding of so many concepts and the confidence to put the ball where he wants to.   I have concerns regarding ball security, but that is the only real ON THE FIELD concern I have. If he can bring that INT Rate down to 2.5% - 3% I think we have ourselves a guy who in 5 years will compete with Luck for the best QB in the business. Again - thats super exciting."
nfl,3e2xq0,BobLbLawsLawBlg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:27:16 2015 UTC,"I mean he can't be worse than this:   At the same time Josh McCown is far from the only (or even the primary) reason that offense was so inept, and expecting that Winston alone will change it all is insane to me.   I have concerns regarding ball security, but that is the only real ON THE FIELD concern I have.   I have to tell you, there is no greater concern about a quarterback than his indifference toward turnovers, and I sure hope Jameis Winston doesn't believe he's as ready as fans do, because someone's going to need to advise that nature right out of him.  My hope for that guy this season is that he listens to veterans like Evan Smith and Logan Mankins.  Mankins played for one of the best quarterbacks ever, and is regarded around NFL circles as a really good leader.  Far as I'm concerned that makes him the most important thing about our offense.  Because without leadership, this rookie is just a rookie.  It's not that I'm not ""on board.""  I don't believe in CFB as a feeder system.  Period.  So Winston might as well not have existed before May, far as I care.  But again, what's the most exciting thing?  How about a defense that might start reminding us of the best thing to ever happen to professional football in Tampa Bay?  Because seriously, David's that good, McCoy's that good, Verner's that good...it's on the table.  Winston could be the best quarterback we've ever had and I'd still be more excited for what I like to think of as Tampa Two.0"
nfl,3e2xq0,LansdowneStreet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:33:27 2015 UTC,"I have to tell you, there is no greater concern about a quarterback than his indifference toward turnovers   Brett Favre is the all time leader in INTs. 11 of the top 15 in career INTs are or will be Hall of Famers. Pushing the ball down the field is a risk. Interceptions will happen. Turnovers will happen. Efficiency is the key.    I don't believe in CFB as a feeder system. Period.   I really don't know what to say about this. There is empirical data showing that players drafted out of college have longer careers than those who don't. Those who play in bigger programs and conferences have higher success rates than those who don't. Those who are drafted higher have a higher success rates than those drafted lower. This is not like College Hockey and the NHL. The NFL is a league where 99% of players are former college players.   As for the defense: There still is no outside pass rush. The safety position is still a mess. This isn't the Dungy Tampa 2. Its definitely closer to elite than the offense, but I believe the offense has more potential. Three 6'5""+ receivers, an O-Line that is finally being overhauled and most importantly a QB with more potential than anyone on the roster.   To each his own, I guess I just see it differently."
nfl,3e2xq0,BobLbLawsLawBlg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:04 2015 UTC,"Brett Favre is the all time leader in INTs.   Brett Favre ended his team's season twice when he threw very terrible interceptions in the fourth quarter of playoff games.  Interceptions will happen, but if they happen too often it simply doesn't matter how good you are.  Remember, the Bucs have a Super Bowl because of exactly that.   This is not like College Hockey and the NHL.    You're absolutely right.  In college hockey pro teams are allowed in (you draft guys before/while they're in college, making college hockey an ACTUAL feeder system).  College hockey works.  College football just makes money.  To clarify I prefer hockey's draft WELL over football's draft and if we're going to pretend CFB is a valid feeder system then we should start drafting NHL style.    People act like CFB is on par with the AHL or baseball's minor league system, but it's not.  Not even close.  College football related to the draft is a mess and I do not take it seriously, nor will I ever again.  It's a money grab.  And it is not, in any way, the sport they play in the NFL.   a QB with more potential than anyone on the roster.   Lavonte David is the best player on this team and has the highest ceiling (the go-to comparison is best Buccaneer that ever lived Derrick Brooks"
nfl,3e2xq0,LansdowneStreet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:12:35 2015 UTC,"Brett Favre ended his team's season twice when he threw very terrible interceptions in the fourth quarter of playoff games.   I would rather have had Brett Favre than any QB who has ever played for the Bucs (yes that includes Steve Young). Being afraid to make the clutch throw is the difference between a guy like Chad Pennington or Mark Burnell and Matt Hasselback or Joe Flacco. I would rather have a QB who is a threat to make a comeback than not.   I think you've missed the point about College Hockey. Look at the best players in the NHL the vast majority of them did not play College Hockey.   As for your opinion of College Football, that's your choice. I don't see it that way. To say College Football is a mess in relation to the draft is a minority opinion that I can't take seriously.   As for Lavonte David, I agree he is a great player. He does not have the highest ceiling though. A great QB is more valuable than a Weak Side Linebacker. If given the choice between a B+ level QB and an A+ level WSLB, I'll take the QB everyday and twice on Sunday. We've never had a B+ QB. We've had seasons with a B QB (Doug Williams 79, Brad Johnson 2002, Jeff Garcia 07, Josh Freeman 2010), but we've never had a guy who you could rely on year in year out to be a top 5 QB. Winston has that potential, hence he is the player with the most potential on this roster."

That would be a perfect middle ground (12-17 more yards than a 40yard dash) and allow you to compare directly to the 100m (tryingn somehow to account for the 60m being indoors before peak)  It's a decent start but the fundamental differences between a 40 and a 100m are gigantic, to the point where people here have no idea that Olympic sprinters (you ignored Jeff Demps) essentially choreograph every step they take in a race."

nfl,3e1vfa,mkdz,2,Tue Jul 21 11:55:23 2015 UTC,"Why didn't you look at 60m (55m if needed) times for sprinters indoors?   Sadly not many data is available for 60m indoor race and not much NFL player compete in the event.. I will consider it if I find one.   you ignored Jeff Demps   I will add Jeff Demps but since his name don't appear in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40-yard_dash I don't include him at first.    How did you control for track surface, spikes, and blocks?   I don't honestly. But since it is a estimation only it is free to added any arbitrary value on the number to reflect that. Since the difference of real and estimated number is small I will just leave it alone.   differences between a 40 and a 100m are gigantic   Here I assume that the acceleration would not increase in first 20m in 40-yard dash or 100m sprint. Obviously non-professional sprint athletes (e.g. NFL player who don't compete in track) are not able to keep up his speed in later course of race, but here we are just estimate first 40 yards(36 m) of sprint by good sprinter so I think it is ok. I think slow player that cannot keep up his speed will cause his time to inflate a bit more, but since the error itself will let slow player run a slower speed than  actual one, I guess this point can help to compensate it."

It takes time but I would venture a good amount of the 5332 people with recorded 40 yard times since 1999 ran track. Heck cut off people who didn't run under 4.60 (or 4.50) and it cuts off over 10% of the search.  For recent years, here is the site with all track times  but otherwise it's just searching on NCAA old results.  Using high school times is not good for something like this.

nfl,3e1vfa,jnthnsu,5,Tue Jul 21 12:41:57 2015 UTC,"I did the math for a Usain Bolt 40yd dash a while back.  You can look at Usain Bolt's 100m split times here and here.  So he ended up running 30m in 3.78s (including reaction time). It took him .86s to run from 30m to 40m. So at that pace, he would have covered the 6.576m to get to 40yds in 6.576 / 10 x .86 = 0.566s. So his 40yd time would would be 3.78 + 0.566 = 4.35s If you do it by subtraction: 4.64s - .86s x (10m - 6.576m) / 10m = 4.36s  Reaction time in the 100m is usually around .15s, so if you subtract that off, Bolt would run a 4.21s 40yd dash. Bolt was also a relatively poor starter."
nfl,3e1vfa,KingDamager,2,Tue Jul 21 13:17:56 2015 UTC,"The estimated 40 yard dash numbers don't pass the eye test to me. I ran the 400m in college and, though I didn't run the 100m, I could hit 11.00 at my fastest (hence why that wasn't my event). I could NEVER have come close to a 4.5 in the 40 yard dash, maybe 4.7, but even that's a maybe. I'm fairly confident that a 4.3 40 yard dash is much more special than a 10.5."
nfl,3e1vfa,ihateconnecticut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:35:08 2015 UTC,For me who are dead last in any sprint event held I really don't know how fast should be called fast. NFL combine is tested for once only while players can run 100 for many times. As I mention adding somewhere between 0.05s and 0.1s in 40-yard dash would be realistic for combine situation. I know in running it is quite a margin but in statistic it is a very small number when compare to fitness of regression line.

nfl,3e2npm,JaguarGator9,13,Tue Jul 21 14:16:27 2015 UTC,His stats are pretty decent but the lack of pro bowls and only one all pro is concerning. It shows that he was overshadowed by superior receivers. Also even though he had 8 1000 yard seasons he never led the league in anything and his best season was 1303 yards/ 95 receptions/ 8 tds which is pretty dismal for a standout season.

He was remarkably consistent, reliable in just about every way you can think of, but he was never really even one of the 5 best receivers in the league, never scored 10 touchdowns, never surpassed 1300 yards (1303 is his highest single season mark), and for all of his 1k seasons (8 of them), 5 just barely scratched the 1k yard barrier. His 07-09 seasons in Baltimore just look to me like the product of being the only passable receiver in town (164 targets in 07). The man was good, but - even disregarding the glut of WR talent trying to get in to the hall at the moment - the first two words that come to mind when considering a HoF career really shouldn't be consistent and steady. There have been HoFers who were inducted based on long, consistent careers, but Masons wasn't long enough or consistently productive enough to qualify."

He has to compete with Marvin Harrison, Torry Holt, Isaac Bruce, T.O., Randy Moss, Hines Ward and he does not beat out a single one of those candidates. I don't think he even beats out Ocho. He was still a great player and isn't too far off from the hall, but there isn't much of a chance with so many greats.  Edit: Oops"

He was as tough as they come. One of the best route runners I've ever seen. He could stop on a dime and had great hands. He played with so much heart. I'll never forget his gritty performance against the Cowboys in 2008. He dislocated his shoulder in the first quarter and kept playing with one arm. He still had 6 receptions and a TD."

nfl,3e2npm,SealTheLion,2,Tue Jul 21 19:01:28 2015 UTC,"Here's my argument for, and I've argued this in the past:  Mason held the record for most all-purpose yards in a season until the kickoff rules changed a few years ago (Darren Sproles), and he's still #2 after all that. In addition only five WRs in the history of the NFL have more 1,000+ yard seasons than Mason: Rice, Moss, Owens, Tim Brown, and Jimmy Smith (another contender for the most underrated). Dude never played with an elite QB or an elite offensive mind, yet he found ways to produce year in and year out."
nfl,3e2npm,innnikki,2,Tue Jul 21 17:28:37 2015 UTC,"Oh man, this is one of the toughest ones to date, and I might be talking out of both sides of my mouth here. It's so hard to believe with his production he only made two Pro-Bowl rosters and one All-Pro.   Look at his stats compared to Art Monk's: nearly identical.   Monk - 940 catches for 12,721 yards and 68 touchdowns. Also 3x Super Bowl champion though. And look how long it took him to get in.  Mason - 943 catches for 12,061 yards and 66 touchdowns.    Monk barely got in, and he has the championships to back his stats.   Mason only made the 2000 All-Pro. Look at the 2000 All-Pro Roster: it included the likes of Randy Moss, TO, Marvin Harrison, and Rod Smith. TO and Moss are locks, Harrison is going to get in eventually, and Smith is fringe.   But that kind of speaks to the career Mason had, and why he is probably not going to be a Hall of Famer.   Mason was a consistent, valuable producer on every team he played for, but not the ""game-changer"" that some of his peers were.   I suspect he will be strongly considered, maybe make it in one day, but he's so difficult to judge."

A 1 cut back is someone makes one cut to get through the whole and uses speed to get away from the secondary, think demarco murray.

And I guess change-of-pace could be any running back that comes in and changes the pace of the running game from the starter; I guess a good example was when Reggie Bush or LenDale White would sub the other out at USC."
nfl,3e22f2,SharksFanAbroad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:01:59 2015 UTC,I would say Danny Woodhead and Darren Sproles are the best examples of scatbacks today. Shady is pretty balanced.
nfl,3e22f2,snufalufalgus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:18:11 2015 UTC,"""Scat back"" to me refers to guys who are fast, pass catching, change of pace guy.  Sproles is a perfect example. Maybe Spiller.    Also Marshawn Lynch isn't just a downhill runner. He has lateral agility that is ridiculous for a man his size. What comes to mind for me is Alfred Morris"
nfl,3e22f2,CalPolyJohn,5,Tue Jul 21 16:25:58 2015 UTC,Change of pace back is typically a second or third running back that has a different running style than your 1st string running back. This difference in running style can cause scheme or matchup problems for the defense.
nfl,3e22f2,IcariteMinor,4,Tue Jul 21 12:40:53 2015 UTC,"Tail-back: usually a power back who sets up deep in the backfield to get more speed before getting the ball. Heard more in college, some years it's trendy, some years it's not.   Half-back:another name for running back. Some people will try to tie other associations to it, but there is nothing universal.   Featured back: RB who will get 60+% of the carries."
nfl,3e22f2,GravelLot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:31:56 2015 UTC,"I've always used TailBack and HalfBack interchangeably.    Also, to get technical, the Fullback is also a Running Back - running back includes all backfield runners.  But over time the term Running back is morphing into specifically what we know as the tail/halfback.  Honestly, it's all confusing.  The terminology for backs has gone through so many changes as the game has progressed that they make less and less sense.  I mean, in an I-Form, if the QUARTER back is nearest the LOS, shouldnt the back behind him be the Half and the tailback be the full?  But no, it's the opposite."
nfl,3e22f2,CrownReserve,2,Tue Jul 21 15:41:35 2015 UTC,"A change of pace back is a guy that doesn't get the majority of touches as a running back but just comes in here and there when the starting RB needs a rest for a play or two.  Not sure what other terms you need help with.  Running ""between the tackles"" literally means running between the two tackles on either side of the offensive line. It means you're an interior runner.   ""Cutback"" means you start running one way and then you cut and run the other direction. I've always thought Arian Foster was a good between the tackles runner that has good vision to see cutback lanes. Many runblocking schemes are designed to create cutback lanes. See this play.  ""Third-down back"" refers to a running back that is a good passcatcher and (ideally) a good pass blocker. Since often on third downs the team is passing, the third down back is a guy that can come in and assist in the passing game catching passes. Ex: Giovani Bernard."

nfl,3e22f2,LedZepp42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:11:28 2015 UTC,"Downhill running is more of a style of running where the RB will mostly try to run straight to the end-zone.  He can obviously still cut or something to gain more yards, but typically his most effective weapon is his momentum.  He probably wont spend much time dancing behind his offensive line waiting for a hole either.    Think about when you actually run down a hill.  You dont really make turns, you just run straight down really fast.  Its direct."

nfl,3e2ow0,bbbwwwthrow,10,Tue Jul 21 14:26:04 2015 UTC,"Even if Miami elected to cut player x to sign Mathis, that doesn't relieve cap space necessarily, does it?   It varies between contracts.  The Dolphins have about $10M in cap room according to OverTheCap. So they could potentially sign Mathis, I suppose.  The way that cutting players works has to do with how much guaranteed money they have, and what their signing bonus is. Miami currently has 12 players who would result in a hit to cap space if they cut them, most notably Ndamakong Suh because he signed that giant contract.  But, for instance, if the Dolphins decided they were done with Cameron Wake and cut him, they would save $7.65M against the cap.  The case for most of their players is that if you cut them, you save less than a million dollars against the cap."
nfl,3e2ow0,DCMurphy,8,Tue Jul 21 14:41:33 2015 UTC,"Here's the way I see our 2016 cap situation:  Not playing on 2016 current cap number:  Cam Wake - $9.8M. I see a restructure with a decent bonus to free up some cap  Suh- $28.6M. Slide $6M or so into 2017 which is a $15.1M hit currently  Fields- $4.3M. Cut to save $3.5. No brainer  Grimes- $9.5M- if he falls further in 2015, cut him to save $6.5M  Dion Jordan- bye +$3.5M  That's about $20M without much of a headache. Grimes would hurt but he's getting older anyway.  I also expect the cap number to be ~152M (+$9M from this year), instead of the $150M being projected now. We could roll over another $3-4M from this year with Mathis signed.  So that's about $25M to work with plus a potential Wake extension. Don't have to blow up the team too badly"
nfl,3e2ow0,gth829c,4,Tue Jul 21 14:55:08 2015 UTC,Please do not even hypothetically cut Wake he's my favorite.
nfl,3e2ow0,raw-sienna,3,Tue Jul 21 16:20:37 2015 UTC,For one year? Yes. For two? Almost certainly not. Not without some real wrangling.
nfl,3e2ow0,Moruitelda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:55:23 2015 UTC,"They could make it work, but it would be tight. They are $10 million under the cap this season, but are already over the cap for next season because of Suh and Tannehill and some other contracts. If they signed Mathis, they would almost assuredly have to cut Dion Jordan and at least one other large contract and if so, would have no manueverability next offseason. They already are paying giant money to Albert and Pouncey and adding Mathis for $8 million is almost 30 million to three offensive linemen."
nfl,3e2ow0,IMLOwl,4,Tue Jul 21 14:37:44 2015 UTC,"To be fair, offensive line is a great place to invest your cap into.   That said, because of the contracts they've heaped onto other players they really don't have the cap to invest into Offensive Line."
nfl,3e2ow0,GGerrik,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:35 2015 UTC,"Is an offensive lineman who is 33 and missed 8 games last year a good long term (2-3 year) investment?  And that O Lineman has already said he wants a lot of money.  Essentially Mathis wants a good deal, a better deal than he had with the Eagles which was already a good deal.  Is that a good investment?"
nfl,3e2ow0,TheSubversive,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:59:39 2015 UTC,"it's just not really something i can see happening. the only way we land him is if he takes less money to play in miami (which being a state without income tax could actually be more money than a bigger offer in a state like ny). he doesn't look interested in leaving any money on the table though, and has said he's ""in no rush"" to sign anywhere. he's definitely waiting to see who the highest bidder is."
nfl,3e2ow0,reaper527,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:55:42 2015 UTC,"Oh god I hope so, a 30 plus guard that's going to demand more than one year and a decent sized contract? Go get 'em boys,  worry about that salary cap when you get there."
nfl,3e2ow0,2busy2blizzy,5,Tue Jul 21 14:59:09 2015 UTC,He's still a top tier guard and his asking price will likely drop from what he was asking the Eagles. Getting him on a 2-3 year contract would be a wise investment for them if they can swing it.
nfl,3e2ow0,CravingToast,3,Tue Jul 21 15:06:34 2015 UTC,I really think he could be got for a 3 yr $16M with ~$7M signing bonus

nfl,3e2ow0,pboly44,3,Tue Jul 21 15:57:54 2015 UTC,Haha what? Theres 10 teams out there that would sign him for 3/16 in a heartbeat
nfl,3e2ow0,gth829c,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:05:59 2015 UTC,he was cut by the Eagles at a $6mil deal. No trade partners wanted that contract. So you're telling me suddenly teams will be willing to to do a 3 years $5.25million deal?   He is most likely going to get a $3-4 million deal for 2 years.
nfl,3e2ow0,GingerDirtyMitts,2,Tue Jul 21 17:18:09 2015 UTC,"He was cut from  $6.5 and $7M cap hits. It's not unreasonable to assume he would get  $7M, 5M, 4M"
nfl,3e339y,IronV2,26,Tue Jul 21 16:13:25 2015 UTC,"ESPN got rid of it due to the NFL pressuring them to stop showing it. It got replaced by C'Mon Man.  That being said, I'd love it if we had a thread every Tuesday where the best hit from every game is shown (and possibly voted on)."
