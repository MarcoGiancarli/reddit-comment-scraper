RES and reddit devs occasionally chat about implementing features or checking that things won't break.  There's certainly interest on the reddit side about bringing over popular and useful RES features, but one of the main problems is dev time.  One of the hurdles facing bringing RES tools in-house is that RES is built on a different architecture than reddit, so it's not a simple copy-paste job. RES also provides a lot of power-user features that aren't necessarily appropriate for the general reddit population."

Enhancement,3d55dz,wub_wub,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:22:02 2015 UTC,You could simply use private rss/json feeds for unread inbox.
Enhancement,3d55dz,andytuba,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:50:14 2015 UTC,"https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite/issues/1428  Got any ideas for fetching the unread feed?  The best idea I have right now is ""on pageload, if RES doesn't know the RSS URL, fetch that preferences page and scrape it for the feed"".  then hafta deal with if the user changes password, then the URL changes - so if fetching the feed returns a permissions error or 404 or something then RES will have to scrap that URL and ... show a warning icon instead? show nothing?  tldr: you should know better than to say ""simply"" :p"
Enhancement,3d55dz,wub_wub,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:21:12 2015 UTC,"There are few issues with that approach.   RSS/JSON feeds are disabled by default on new accounts iirc. Those feeds contain private data, while I guess it's not an huge issue because RES stores password anyway it's still something to keep in mind. Considering points 1 and 2, enabling that feature by default and adding it to RES storage, which is plaintext doesn't sound like a great idea for every account automatically.   Some ways to solve it:   In the account switcher next to delete/move button add ""Enable Inbox Updates"" or something like that, which when clicked will log into the account, fetch the JSON url, and add it to the database. Add a global button that does the same as the individual button above. Get the URL when the account is first added. Makes most sense if you have that feature enabled by default.   In all 3 options you have one issue to solve, enabling the urls. You can either do it:   Automatically. Easiest to use, easiest one to break if reddit changes preferences layout, and I don't think RES changes any of the account settings now - so it might not be something you want to start doing. Give instructions for users on how to do it. Can lead to confusion and unnecessary help threads if not done properly. Some combination of the above, semi automated. Maybe a popup that shows on the preferences page when you visit /prefs#enableFeeds, maybe highlight the element or something like that.   But to do any of the above you have to log into the account. Which leads to another set of possibilities on how to solve it.   Add the JSON feed when the user logs in. Makes most sense but requires user to log in into every account. Log in automatically. Not the best idea because the user might be on a network or device where she/he doesn't want that kind of data logged.   Now, taking all that into account I'd go either with:   Global enable unread updates, enabled after user logs into account, settings are changed automatically to enable private feeds. Easiest to use and leaves little to no room for user errors.   OR   Tell user to log in and to change settings, then fetch the private feed url and store it. Too much work from user perspective, but least privacy invasive and it will show reddit text regarding those things too.   Some other thoughts regarding storage and scaling:  Since you're only storing unread messages count the storage is under little load, however updates might be an issue with a lot of accounts. Maybe do checks proportionally to the number of accounts e.g. if there are 2 accounts do checks every 60 seconds between accounts, if there are 30 do checks every 5 sec between accounts to leave room for other requests - OR simply limit it to top 10 accounts.  Edit: as far as the invalid feed url goes, user will have to change password in his RES account settings if he wants to keep it as alt account in RES. Do the same thing again as on initial enabling when password change is detected. Maybe display a popup notifying the user that the messaging updates are disabled for one or more accounts (without publicly displaying username) if the user didn't change his/her password in RES settings and didn't trigger the update.    Sorry for the wall of text, I was just writing what I was thinking on how I would approach solving that."

You can hide comment karma correctly and post karma imperfectly by injecting CSS (use Stylish or something) - here's a PM I sent someone else who asked, so it doesn't match your use-case completely:   Some parts can't be limited to one user.  Use the following (you may remove the :not(:hover) to prevent the karma from showing when you mouseover, and you'll of course have to replace USERNAME with your username [case-sensitive]):  /* Hides comment karma and userbar karma for you */ .userkarma, .tagline:not(:hover) > a[href$=""/user/USERNAME""] ~ .score { display: none; } .user { font-size: 0; } .user a { font-size: 10px; } /* Hides profile page karma for everyone (can't be limited to one user, except perhaps with @-moz-document) */ .profile-page .titlebox .karma:not(:hover) { color: transparent; } /* Hides linkinfo for everyone (can't be limited) */ .linkinfo { display: none; } /* Hides post karma for everyone (can't be limited) */ .thing > .midcol > .score:not(:hover) { color: transparent; }    You can hide post karma correctly with JS, and the following will do that (mostly).

How quickly it starts indexing your user page is up to Google (other (arguably better) search engines are available); some may be based on time, and you just have to wait until the next crawler comes along, while others may be activity based, and won't come until you've created enough new content (comments/posts) that your user page is worth indexing anew."

EDIT: Perhaps it isn't as possible as I thought; it seems Reddit as an entire site has disallowed web crawlers (for the most part), so things can't be indexed easily... wonder why on earth they even have the option to opt out then, considering it shouldn't ever work in the first place?

It hasn't been stable.  A release involves a lot of annoying (virtual) paperwork and a really cumbersome process for some browsers, and basically requires that I block off an entire evening just to work on RES.

The changelog has to be authored, the website needs to be updated, the wikis have to be updated, the automoderator configs need to be updated, the announcements need to get posted, the forms for each browser extension repo have to be filled out, various other witchcraft and black magic occurs (if you want a release to take less than 2 months from the time you upload it with Firefox you must sacrifice at least 3 goats and pray to various gods)...  Both Andy and I are at relatively new jobs at companies that demand a LOT out of us, and so our free time is less and less as well.

Open a notepad and copy the text in the file into it, then there should be a line with @match. Delete ""http"" from that line (leave the asterik and the rest of it) and save it. Then rename the file from xxx.txt to xxx.user.js and drag that file into your firefox browser. A greasemonkey popup to install it should come up and then just enable it. Hope that helps!

My firefox auto update just kicked in and my RES is reverted to the one from addons.mozilla.org and now I have the same tabs as yours.  RES version from git is 4.5.4 but the one from addons.mozilla.org is 4.5.4.1-signed. My guess is firefox think my RES is outdated and replaced it with the stable version. I don't know if it's the same in chrome.  I turned off RES auto update for now and reinstalled the extension from git. I'm already subscribed to /r/RESAnnouncements and /r/Enhancement so I don't have to worry if I'll miss any update.

When you see the ""RES updated"", its usually because Firefox trashed all your data. RES assumes you are a new user (since you have no data) and shows you that page.  Why? Because Firefox has a bug that throws away data sometimes, on updates or when it closes - RES is looking into solutions, but its a long road.    So what can you do?  A. Use a different browser  B.

Enhancement,3aq8ly,allthefoxes,6,Mon Jun 22 19:27:21 2015 UTC,This is not exactly true. the front page only grabs posts from 50 subreddits (100 if you have gold).

RES has absolutely no ability to influence the post/subreddit content of your front page, it can only manipulate the page after Reddit's servers provide it to you.  I notice that you do not have Reddit Gold, so when you have 162 subreddits subscribed, Reddit selects a random subset of 50 subreddits to display on your front page when you load the front page (Reddit Gold members front page posts are selected from up to 100 subreddits).   Notice I said subreddits, not posts -- the number of posts on your front page is a different number, and can be specified. If you have 100 posts on your front page, those posts will be chosen from 50 random subreddits that you subscribe to.  It's likely (or so I would guess) that many of your 162 subreddits are specialized and/or have a low content submission rate, so when it selects a subset of 50 to show you, and 40 of those subreddits have had no submissions in the last 12-24 hours, suddenly your front page will be dominated by the huge amount of submissions on the remaining 10-ish subreddits.

I know it isn't something that RES controls, it's more of a reddit issue - but I also was posting and paging Allthefoxes in hopes that there might be a workaround.

But I've also got /r/gaming, /r/games, /r/pics, /r/pic, /r/news and a few others that are major subs that should be up at the top... yet these two specific subs (Random acts of amazon subs) sometimes flood my page.

Enhancement,3a3c3s,13steinj,8,Tue Jun 16 22:13:59 2015 UTC,Someone suggested something similar before. Let the current behavior of RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible unchanged and add another type of nightmode compatibility (something like RES_SR_Config/ShutUpRESICanHandleDarkThemeMyself). I like this one because it won't piss moderators who already have working nightmode friendly theme.
Enhancement,3a3c3s,Liwaloka,2,Wed Jun 17 00:30:17 2015 UTC,That is not what I mean. The current behavior of nightmode by itself is:  *Enable Nightmode.* Inject Nightmode Styles. If side has `RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible`:     pass Else:     disable sub style   Whereas I want it to be  *Enable Nightmode.* If side has `RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible`:     pass Else:     disable sub style     Inject Nightmode Styles.
Enhancement,3a3c3s,Liwaloka,4,Wed Jun 17 00:39:12 2015 UTC,"Whereas I want it to be  *Enable Nightmode.* If side has `RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible`:     pass Else:     disable sub style     Inject Nightmode Styles.    You assumed every moderator who have created nightmode friendly theme has covered every part of reddit and RES by their own CSS. This is not the case. Most of them only change background colors to be softer, darker menu bar, use non bright images, etc, and let the nightmode injected style handle the rest like comment/post text colors, markdown editor toolbar, big editor, res main menu, account menu, and every RES popup. If RES stopped injecting nightmode style to subreddits that have RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible in their sidebar, those parts that are handled by RES nightmode style will become bright and will annoy those moderators.  If you don't mind with that then fine. But you're not everyone so IMO adding second method of nightmode compatibility is the best way. Mods who already have working nightmode friendly theme can continue using RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible. You and everyone who wants to create a new theme can use the alternate nightmode compatibility mode."
Enhancement,3a3c3s,Liwaloka,2,Wed Jun 17 01:02:12 2015 UTC,"Okay, how about this instead then:  *Enable Nightmode.* if side has `RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible+NoInject`:     pass elif side has `RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible`:     Inject Nightmode Styles. else:     disable sub style     Inject Nightmode styles   Would that work then? Of course, that's fake code for the sake of concept."

Enhancement,39x12x,andytuba,11,Mon Jun 15 15:33:21 2015 UTC,"You can already probably hack the browser to work with RES. That's not the problem.  The problem is that Vivaldi doesn't actually officially support browser extensions right now and so any support offered by RES would be mute if Vivaldi goes in another direction.  The software level support is there, but there's no tie into vivaldi itself or documentation about what changes Vivaldi is making.  Vivaldi itself is still not officially released. It's a set of software snapshots.  RES has never officially supported BETA software.  I would wait until Vivaldi officially releases the browser, and has detailed documentations for an extension API.  It may be similar enough to chrome, but that doesn't mean that there are hooks into the browser UI yet, like for the subreddit CSS toggle.  tl;dr Vivaldi is still working out the kinks, and isn't really 1.0 yet. Vivaldi also has no real Extension documentation yet because they're still working on other features. Give Vivaldi time to grow before trying to force RES to support it."

Enhancement,39f5f7,yeahigetthatalot,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:39:28 2015 UTC,"RES supports regular expressions in the filter list. You can add stuff like the following and it'll work:  /.*weight.*/i /.*hate.*/i /.*dislike.*/i   The slashes delimit the pattern, i says ""ignore case"", .* is shorthand for  ""anything"", and the text is obvious.  So with just those three filters, any sub whose name contains any of those three  words won't show up on /r/all.  Regular expressions are really powerful. Their syntax can be cryptic to those  new to them, but it really puts the power in your hands to customize your  /r/all experience.  I believe it's somewhat outdated, but http://regularexpressions.info is a good  place to get started learning regex."

Adblock filter lists are user-maintained by overseen communities in the same way, and this kinda thing would allow for user-created filtration of memes (for instance) which is a much-desired killer feature which would be damn near impossible otherwise.

I wouldn't bother with /fatpeoplehate/, filtering /fat/ will cover all current and future possibilities. With regex a full string match isn't required, so filtering /fat/ would filter /r/fatpeoplehate, /r/peoplefathate, /r/hatepeoplefat, etc.  The leading and trailing slashes are just there to indicate that it's regex (JS regex syntax).

Enhancement,39fccw,xsenis112,2,Thu Jun 11 10:04:38 2015 UTC,I keep seeing reports of this broken.. Gonna have some folks investigate.
Enhancement,39fccw,andytuba,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:29:28 2015 UTC,I'm having the same issue. Thanks for looking into it!

Enhancement,39c7h1,andytuba,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:59:42 2015 UTC,"Hmm.. wouldn't it be possible to instead enumerate through all the comments of the user to check if it was up/downvoted. Wouldn't reqiure storing them all, but I guess would require a lot of CPU cycles."
Enhancement,39c7h1,andytuba,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:02:45 2015 UTC,"API only lets you get 1000 items max, and only 50-100 items at once.  Basically, RES is in a terrible place to record which comments you've voted on except for maybe the last 100 things."

Enhancement,39d7wo,LankyTom,6,Wed Jun 10 23:54:20 2015 UTC,"IE doesn't even really support extensions.  However, when Windows 10 comes out, it will use Edge instead, which RES plans on supporting"

Enhancement,39d7wo,posam,2,Thu Jun 11 07:07:37 2015 UTC,Surface users tend to use IE as it is the best browser for it some how.

Enhancement,39atvj,allthefoxes,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:45:32 2015 UTC,I can only see the option to change the way comments are sorted. Is there an option to change the way posts in a sub are sorted as well? Maybe I'm just overlooking it.
Enhancement,39atvj,allthefoxes,2,Wed Jun 10 15:07:50 2015 UTC,"Oh, sorry. Can't do that as far as I know"
Enhancement,39atvj,tech_engineer,2,Wed Jun 10 15:09:30 2015 UTC,is there at least an option is RES so that when clicking from the Dashboard on a subreddit it will open it with different sorting than Hot? I like to visit subreddits by New and every time I click on the Dashboard then go to New....
