Libraries may be able to direct you to copies of his books, and there are summaries online.   If you have specific questions though, we're here to help. Generally you'll find that English language heraldry derives partially from Norman-French and thus from Latin, although some of the words have shifted. Colours and metals for example:   Ar.  - Argent (white/silver) Or. - Or (gold/yellow) Az. - Azure (blue) Gu. - Gules (red) Prp. - Proper (as coloured in nature - at least in theory) Prp. - Purpure (purple) Sa. - Sable (black) Ve.

I was looking for that coat of arms, but coudn't find a quality rendition, or even a correct one, so instead I found the blazon and drew it myself.  Blazon is: Chief, a castle or on field gules, and on the other half a field or, with two crossed cinnamon sticks, three nutmegs and twelve cloves.

Some just say 'castle', but the windows are almost always blue so I just copied mine from the coa of Spain as such.  The blazon I found (from several sources) is in English, but it's not clear if it's translated from the original, or blazoned afterwards, so it's possible that it's not complete, but it's definitely the castle of Castille.

For example, you can have Argent, a polar bear Proper and it doesn't break the rule of tincture even though it's white on white.

It is sometimes seen as a royal colour (tyrian purple - associated with emperors), but more usually when combined with gold, but my personal opinion on why it's avoided as a main colour on arms is twofold - proper purple dye is enormously expensive, and having part of your household colours be purple could be crippling to your budget, and secondly purple is quite a variably shade, varying from almost red to almost blue, and sometimes out towards brown.  Solid bold consistent colours lie at the heart of heraldry."

heraldry,3bvp63,ltsaGiraffe,3,Thu Jul 2 15:14:49 2015 UTC,"Image Source.   Napoleon's brother Louis Bonaparte was installed as King of Holland on 5 June 1806. Originally the arms of the new kingdom were to be like those of the Kingdom of Italy: an eagle bearing a shield, with the arms of the United Netherlands, the lion, now royally crowned. In December 1806, A. Renodi in Paris designed arms quartering the Napoleonic eagle with the lion of the United Netherlands. Around the shield was the French Order of the Grand Aigle. Behind the shield are crossed sceptres, typical for Napoleonic heraldry, and above the shield, Napoleon's star. A few months later, on 20 May 1807, King Louis (now called ""Lodewijk"") altered these arms, adding a helmet, leaving out his brother's star and replacing the Grand Aigle with his own Dutch Order of the Union and the old Dutch devise Eendracht maakt macht (literally ""Concord makes strength"", often translated as ""Unity makes strength"") around the shield. Exemplary for the innovation in Napoleon's heraldry are the two hands coming out of clouds from behind the shield holding swords, designating King Louis as Connétable de France.   Source."

Keep the rule of Tincture. You can find an Atlas of heraldic terms here, and a library of public domain images you can use for your own arms here. Dont quarter your arms, it implies a combination of 2 or more sets of arms. And in the same vain dont use an inescutcheon or canton.  While the charges of your arms should have symbolic value to you, avoid overburdening it with symbolism or refereeing to the same symbolism with different charges. Avoid cliché if every musician would use a harp and every farmer a head of corn, heraldry would become very boring. Point is, make something you like not something that would be expected of you. If you are a farmer and want a head of corn, go right ahead. But dont do it because you think you should, or have no other option. Dont use to many colours, like with charges i would try to limit it to using 3 colours or metals, however like with the amount with charges if you can make it look good with more, then its fine."

heraldry,3axyd2,Krynnadin,2,Wed Jun 24 19:39:57 2015 UTC,"So, I guess we'll start at the top.  Coats of Arms were eventually used to show ones possessions. Depending on where the CoA originates from (maybe you can provide some data on that) a CoA either belongs to a individual and their direct heir ONLY upon death (British style) or can belong to a whole family (more of a continental style). If it is in fact british of some sort, a CoA was meant to ONLY belong to one person at a time, and that's it. This will make it easier to figure out who it belongs to.   So let's have a look.  The exterior CoA isn't logical. It has full arms displayed on it's field. This doesn't make sense. Nor does it have a motto, which is optional, but would make the search easier.   The exterior CoA is a circle, which leads me to believe that if this was in fact a proper CoA, it belonged to a woman. Women typically displayed their husbands arms (sometimes impaled with their father's arms) on a lozenge (more commonly) or a circular field.   The Cresting looks to be a plain helmet without a crown, indicating that the person was no higher in the pecking order than a noble. This will become relevant when we get to the interior CoA.  The Blazoning of the crest would be something like:  A Lion with two tails parted rampant COLOUR between two trumpets plumed with 4 feathers.  I'll EDIT more in later. I'm at work and need to do some digging.  The helmet isn't open, so the owner is not a knight, nor is it a tournament helm, so it's not a scottish baron or chief. The mantling doesn't have ermine inside, so it's not royalty or anything really high up the noble tree.  The inside CoA is more interesting. Lacking colours or more a more detailed CoA, this could be difficult, but it is a proper achievement.  Blazoned: COLOUR, a Chevron COLOUR, between in chief two ORDINARIES and in base an ORDINARY COLOUR all within a bordure COLOUR.  Do have any idea what the ordinaries are? That will help a bunch. The colours helps too, but not as much as the ordinaries do.  The crest for the inside CoA looks to be a coronet (maybe a german coronet?) with three feathers.  More information here would be helpful."

More information about it over here; copy pasta:   Escutcheon  The coat of arms of Haarlem consists of a redshield with a silver sword with golden handle under a white Jerusalem cross and flanked by 4 white six-pointed stars. Above the shield is the Imperial Crown of Austria under barren branches holding two Damiate bells, all held up by two golden lions standing on the mottoof Haarlem. Several heraldic elements have their basis in the history of Haarlem. The motto of Haarlem is Vicit vim virtus (Latin for virtue conquers violence). The barren branches refer to the burned trees in theHaarlemmerhout, which were burned again and again during various sieges, most notably during the siege by the army of Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut in 1428. Haarlem had taken side with the Cods in the Hook and Cod wars, and thus against Jacoba of Bavaria. The bells refer to the damiaatjes. Two bells were given to the city of Haarlem's St. Bavochurchto commemorate the heroic cutting of theharbour chain during the Siege of Damietta (1218) with a ""saw ship"", a legendary ship equipped with an iron saw fastened along the bow and front keel. This ship sawed through the harbour chain and allowed the fleet to attack the city, which was a success.  Wapenvermeerdering  According to local legend, the original shield of Haarlem contained simply the four stars on a red background. As a result of the heroic deeds in Damietta, the Holy Roman Emperorgranted Haarlem the usage of a sword and the Patriarch of Jerusalem granted the use of a cross. This story is known as the ""Wapenvermeerdering"", or ""Addition to the Arms"". In portrayels of this legend, the emperor is shown with a red beard, since he is supposed to be Emperor Barbarossa.  As Haarlem historians love to point out, Emperor Barbarossa died in 1190 well before the siege of Damietta took place in 1218, so the story shown in the painting is just a Haarlem fantasy of greater knighthood and glory in the Crusades.  During the Hook and Cod wars in the County of Holland in the 15th century, Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor supported thebourgeoisie in the cities (Cod) in their fight against the nobility in the countryside (Hook). During these wars Haarlem, like the other cities Dordrecht, Leiden, Amsterdam, and The Hague loaned large amounts of money to Maximilian I. The emperor granted Haarlem and the other cities the right to use his personal imperial crown in their coat of arms, out of gratitude for these loans. In the coat of arms of Haarlem, the Imperial Crown is positioned on top of the escutcheon."

heraldry,39r89c,Decabowl,2,Sun Jun 14 02:22:34 2015 UTC,"I am, admittedly, making all this up, but maybe for most Europeans dolphins were basically mythical creatures that they've only heard about, but never seen.

Well in 20th century people knew exactly what dolphins looked like.

heraldry,39oqid,PressureCereal,3,Sun Jun 14 21:31:00 2015 UTC,"This is a saltorel (singly) embattled. A saltorel is a curtailed (couped) saltire, and it can also be emblazoned as a saltire couped. Some authors prefer saltire humetty which is the same as couped but specifically applied to certain ordinaries, like crosses and saltires, instead of couped which is more properly applied to charges.   Another common device that looks a lot like this is the Cross of St. Julian.   It is sometimes also encountered as the term fillet saltire, which is more properly applied to a saltire that reaches out to the edges of the shield in one dimension but is curtailed in the other (a ""squashed"" or ""stretched"" saltire).     Interestingly, I looked around for this coat of arms, and many variations can be found, for example the saltire can be raguly instead of embattled (i.e. with oblique battlements instead of orthogonal), and it may be a proper saltire and extend to the edges of the shield rather than being humetty."

Zapornica also means the wooden beam you lock your castle's gates with, something like here. Which makes sense (more than a cart block), since the Bosnian nobility would certainly make the point of them being the last gate of Europe before the invading Ottomans. Other variations, with Moorish heads, also fit that meaning.  Incidentally, the last stand of Bosnian kingdom was in the town called Ključ (the Key)."

As to the crescent, I had a chat with a chap at the South African Heraldry authority and he said that in South African heradry as long as the crescent is there to mark cadency, it is up to the artist or armiger where and how it is placed. Cadency is enforced, but the method is not as strict as the English or Scotch are.  I did first see what the crescent would look like at fess point like this, but I just didn't like the look of it. So I changed the chief star to a crescent."

heraldry,39danv,Szwab,2,Thu Jun 11 00:12:54 2015 UTC,"Taken from Hugo Ströhl's Deutsche Wappenrolle (which is available as a reprint, much cheaper than the original).  The fields of the shield show: as the inescutcheon the Duchy of Saxony, (1st row) the Landgraviate of Thuringia, the Duchy of Kleve, the Margraviate of Meissen, (2nd) the Duchy of Jülich, the County of Landsberg (behind the inescutcheon), the Duchy of Berg, (3rd) the Saxon palatinate, the Thuringian palatinate, (4th) the County of Orlamünde, the Lordship of Eisenberg, the Lordship of Pleissen, (5th) the Burgraviate of Altenburg, a field Gules (representing the monarch's regalia), the County of Brena, (6th) the County of Mark, party per pale Lordship of Römhild and Princely County of Henneberg, County of Ravensberg.  The helmets and crests represent, from dexter to sinister: the Duchy of Saxony, the Landgraviate of Thuringia, the Princely County of Henneberg, the Margraviate of Meissen, the Duchy of Jülich, the Duchy of Berg.  In the Wappenrolle, Ströhl gives a full, almost page-long, blazon for this and all the other coat of arms of the German states and the Prussian provinces of the time. He blazons not just the shields and the crests, but also the supporters and the orders, like in this example:   Around the shield, hanging from a ponceau-red band with a dark green bordure, the Ducal Saxon-Ernestine House Order. (Created by the Dukes of Altenburg, Coburg-Gotha and Meiningen on 25 December 1833 to commemorate the founder of their dynasty, Duke Erenst the Pious.) The badge is an eight-pointed white cross with a golden bordure and balls on the points, the cross's angles are filled with golden lions. The medallion, encircled by a green oak wreath that is bound four times with a golden band, depicts, inside of a golden lined blue ring the half length portrait of Ernest the Pious in gold. In the ring, the orders motto appears in golden letter: FIDELITER ET CONSTANTER (faithful and enduring)."

heraldry,39dpd4,Random-banana,5,Thu Jun 11 01:49:19 2015 UTC,Normally no. Azure is blue and can be any shade. There is the non-standard tincture called Bleu-Celeste but it is considered unheraldic by some.
heraldry,39dpd4,Decabowl,3,Thu Jun 11 07:46:35 2015 UTC,I'd avoid it if at all possible. Some jurisdictions historically depict Azure as a light shade and it would lend itself to confusion.  Quarterly of a colour and a metal with a charge in the centre would be alright though.

Carrying these arms his name would probably be Renaud de Foix-Henneberg, or in more german fashion Renaud Grav von Henneberg-Foix. But that is up to your imagination. Your mash-up seems to work quite well, its called quartering in Heraldry. I made a slightly higher res version for you here, i did however use a Cock not a Hen (female chicken) for the Henneberg CoA since I couldn't find a nice svg Hen. The Henneberg arms are called canting arms, with the name of the family/place being represented visually with a Hen and a mountain on the arms. Something you might want to add to your design or backstory is a fitting crest for on a helmet above the CoA. This being about a knight his CoA would not be complete without a crest."

So, what I put together, would that 'work' as a set of arms? I read briefly on how you can't have metals touching etc but I was a bit lost regarding the cocks vs Foix placement.  Father being of Foix, should this place Henneberg on the sinister side?  edit also you were right to use a cock rather than a hen, the CoA from the Arms roll I linked shows them using a cock and not a hen"

Are you female? You may find that an oval or cartouche is a more pleasing and easy to work with shape for your arms. Lozenges tend to cramp things up. Many North American women simply use a shield.  As for blazon, if you ditch the bordure I would go with:  Per pale Gules and Azure a coelacanth embowed Or holding with its mouth a bezant."

I know that many North American women use shields nowadays, and I certainly appreciate the equality aspect of it, I like the lozenge/cartouche because of it's uniqueness and it's indication of female identity.   The word bezant indicates a gold coin, yes? I'm not sure if I want to go that explicit on what the roundel indicates, as a coin would maybe imply a pursuit of material wealth, which wasn't what I meant by precious things.  Thank you for your input though."
heraldry,3911w2,Fummy,6,Mon Jun 8 14:28:23 2015 UTC,"Many heraldic terms allude to certain objects but don't exclusively mean them. Yes, a bezant is a gold coin but in heraldry it is any gold roundel. ""Roundel Or"" will always be simplified to bezant.  The best way to achieve visual balance is to have half colour and half metal. That means adjusting the proportions of your central charge accordingly if you drop the bordure, which I still think you should. White generally is not found as a heraldic colour so what you show as white would actually be silver."

You are utilizing a different fish, different partition of the field, and a different metal. I wouldn't worry about it.  Given that you are American, you are free to adopt and bear a crest, motto, and mantling. Mantling will generally be of a metal and a colour from your arms, so, in this case, gold and red or blue.

What you are referring to is a coat of arms, of which the crest is just a component. One cannot have a crest without also having a coat of arms.  When people think to themselves What are my family's arms? they've already made the mistake of assuming that they have arms. The vast majority of people weren't and aren't armigerous.  In the Anglo and Scots heraldic traditions, you must trace your male line ancestry back with certainty as far as you can go. If any of those male-line forefathers bore sound arms (i.e. didn't assume the arms of another family as others do today) then those would be the arms that you are entitled to bear or difference, but only if there is a legitimate line of descent.  If your genealogical search doesn't turn up anything then you can assume arms of your own (except in Scotland, where it is very much illegal). In some places with heraldic authorities this is frowned upon but little if anything can be done about it. Be aware that your coat of arms would not be protected though.  If you find later that you actually did have a coat of arms this whole time then you can quarter it with your assumed arms."

Would it be a combination of the two?   You could always impale them to show both lineages.   Before you do anything, I would say see if any of their other descendent bear the undifferenced arms, as even in a nation where there is no heraldic authority it is good custom to not have the exact same arms as someone else.

heraldry,3907hb,cfvh,3,Mon Jun 8 19:07:24 2015 UTC,"Don't impale two coats of arms. Impalement generally indicates marital arms.  You are almost certainly not entitled to arms on your mother's side unless she is a legitimate male-line descendant of Greene and her father is dead having left no sons. Additionally your father would need arms for you to quarter them with.  In order to determine if your father has arms, you need to trace your legitimate male line ancestry as far back as you can, finding a patrilineal male ancestor who bore arms. If you do, they are yours, but the fact of the matter is most people are not entitled to arms because their male line ancestors never bore them. Therefore, it is folly to assume one automatically has arms.  Your best bet if the above fails is to assume arms of your own, creating a design following the basic tenets of heraldry, unquartered, and as simple as possible."

In some heraldic authorities, yes, it needs to be patrilinealy descended, but in others is does not have to be. Laws of inheritance when it comes to heraldry differs from nation to nation."

heraldry,3907hb,cfvh,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:20:35 2015 UTC,"If you can't justify quartering the arms then you sure as hell shouldn't be impaling them either. Yes, he's American, but that doesn't mean one should totally ignore heraldic convention.  You're also assuming his ancestors have arms that he would be entitled to. If he bears arms he is not entitled to then he is infringing the heraldic rights of those actually entitled to the arms.  When one wants to become a part of the heraldic community one should not start off going against its basic conventions. Adopting marshaled arms, particularly ones composed of arms one may not be entitled to, is frowned upon."
heraldry,3907hb,shadowmask,2,Mon Jun 8 21:30:12 2015 UTC,"I simply disagree. Conventions exist as a staring point, and nothing truly interesting can be achieved unless they are defied.   The trick is knowing what they are so you can defy them with terrible purpose."
heraldry,3907hb,DreadLindwyrm,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:33:51 2015 UTC,"The problem is that heraldry is also a language.  Certain conventions have meanings, and thus an impaled coat is a marriage, normally with no expectation that the children of that marriage would inherit both coats of arms; quartering implies inheritance of two or more coats of arms; an escutcheon of pretence indicates that the coat holder is married to an heiress, and that the children of the marriage are expected to inherit both coats, and the estates associated with the coats.  Ignoring the conventions would be like writing the sentence ""Eagle square blueberry"", and then just saying ""it's only a convention that a sentence includes verbs as well as objects and subjects"", or indeed saying ""I'm the legal descendent of King Richard and heir to his possessions"", and then being surprised when someone challenges you on it."

heraldry,3907hb,DreadLindwyrm,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:06:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone here said creating your own is laughable. In fact, it is encouraged. Marshalling arms isn't ""creating"" though, especially when you haven't demonstrated that you are entitled to said arms. One shouldn't adopt marshalled arms if one isn't armigerous, rather, one should adopt a single coat.  If you were to use the Greene arms alone, you'd be claiming that you are a direct male line descendant of him, which obviously is not possible if you have a descent through your mother. If you were to impale the arms with something else, if would appear as if you were a male married male line descendant of his or a female married male line descendant of his, depending which side you placed his arms on.  You could take elements from the maternal coat and utilize them in a new design of your own, alluding to the Greene ancestry without copying it wholly."

In a field ""per bend,"" (like yours) ""per chevron,"" or ""per fess,"" the upper portion of the field is first referred to; in a coat ""per pale ,"" the dexter side is the more important; and in a coat ""quarterly,"" the tinctures of the 1st and 4th quarters are given precedence of the tinctures of the 2nd and 3rd.  Finally since the tinctures are mirrored between the field/charges you can use counterchanged.

I'll have to search my books a little more thoroughly to give you a definitive answer, but in short:   I've found a coat of arms where a charge is issuing from the right. It's the coat of arms of Cornock, and its proper description is Gules, issuing from the sinister side a cubit dexter arm unvested, fesswise grasping a sword proper. Note that I just copied this description but I have some issues with its accuracy since to my knowledge a bare arm is not ""unvested"" but ""proper"".  Charges may be partial. Parts of lions are very frequently to be met with, particularly as crests. In fact the most common crest in existence is the demi-lion rampant.  A couple of terms you may have missed are naissant and issuant. Issuant is applied to a demi-lion when it issues from an ordinary, e.g. from the base line of the chief , as in the arms of Dormer, Markham, and Abney; or from behind a fesse, as in the arms of Chalmers. Naissant, sometimes written nascent, means issuing from the middle of an ordinary, as shown here. It is sometimes (understandably) confused with issuant, which is properly restricted to charges which rise from the upper line of a fesse or bar, or the lower line of a chief.   The phoenix for example, a somewhat uncommon heraldic charge, is always represented as a demi-eagle issuing from flames of fire, and somewhat more commonly as a crest: It occurs as the crest of the Seymour family ("" Out of a ducal coronet a phœnix issuant from flames of fire"")."

Yet the name never really changed, they have always been known as the Order of St John of Jerusalem.  The modern appearance as the Sovereign Order of Malta is yet different. The order was sovereign from 1113 (as recognized by the pope). It had its own sovereign territory from the 14th century to 1523 (surrender of Rhodes), then it held the Sicilian fiefdom of Malta from 1530 to 1798 (surrender to France). From what I could find out, the order's sovereignty was internationally recognized in 1822, so has been since then, that the Sovereign Military Order of Malta exists in its current form, as a souvereign entity without a territory."

It is more a continental thing though where each of the 16 quarters had to represent a noble family in and of itself. Good luck to whomever wishes to fake that though..."
heraldry,386cdz,cfvh,3,Tue Jun 2 13:26:38 2015 UTC,"As in Germany arms aren't differenced between members of the same family, they are usually family arms, shared by at least by all legitimate members of the family in the male line (traditionally these are also the people who share the family name).  There are no legal requirements to register a new coat of arms or to have it granted by any authority, but nevertheless registering it at the Herold association is considered the ""proper"" way to do it.  People who register their arms there usually allow them to be used by all male-line descendants of their earliest known ancestor in the male line. So attributing arms to one's ancestors is common practice here, but it would be strange to register arms for a family that you don't belong to, so you'd need to find one male line descendant of each of the other 15 families."
heraldry,386cdz,Szwab,5,Tue Jun 2 14:08:21 2015 UTC,"Well all the question is whether it is allowed to attribute arms to the dead. As you said that used to be common to do it, but most of the time the arms were attributed to historical or mythical characters who didn't have any known current heirs.  As for the Seize Quartiers, the thing is that aristocrats used it as a proof of their ""pure"" noble blood. So attributing arms to people who didn't have any would be seen as cheating I guess. But that nobility game is irrelevant and ridiculous nowadays.  Some purists here would tell you that it's not allowed, that arms have to be assumed personally by someone alive, etc., etc. I prefer arms as a family symbol, so in my opinion it would make perfect sense for all male-line descendents of a common ancestor to decide to share his attributed arms (or have them closely related), even if he never had any.  But there's a consequence: since the arms you attribute to your ancestors will naturally be inherited by his direct descendents, I think you need their (at least tacit) approval to do so. Think of it more as a symbol for your cousins than for your family tree. It means you'll have to work on your genealogy to find those cousins, which can be pretty funny. That's what I hope to do. As for now I only imagined one attributed coat of arms for my mother's great-grand-father.  Anyway, you can also disregard everything if you want, it's all just a pretend game. Just for the sake of it, it's really funny to collect information about your ancestors and build arms that represent them. My comments are only if you want it to be somewhat recognized by others."

heraldry,37w431,Szwab,9,Sun May 31 07:40:50 2015 UTC,"A coat of arms has a shield. This shield may be depicted alone or with additional elements, like the ones coats of arms usually have, i.e. helmets, mantling, and a crest. Or even more, like supporters, crowns, mottos, etc.  Now that's not everything. All this has to adhere to the rules of heraldry. E.g., a photograph on a shield is not a coat of arms. A coat of arms is a unique symbol (at least unique in one jurisdiction), representing one or several (related) persons, or any legal person (like a club, a company, or an administrative unit). Also, coats of arms are defined by their blazon, not by one specific image, so they can be drawn in different styles and are still the same coat of arms. This is true even for countries and other territorial units, who in practice often use just one specific version of their arms.  The seal of the USA contains a coat of arms in the centre: there is an eagle in a typical heraldic pose, with a shield on it. The shapes and colours on the shield adhere to heraldic rules.  The Soviet emblem on the other hand, does not have a shield or a crest. So it's not a coat of arms. I'd say, coats of arms are a subset of emblems, so we call it an emblem. The Soviets deliberately didn't want to use a coat of arms, which they saw as aristrocratic. But they still had an emblem, which they used where other states use their coats of arms."

They signify role as well as rank.  The Soviet Union was (supposed to be) a classless state; there was not supposed to be any individual person or entity more important or of higher social stature than another. Everyone was supposed to adhere to one communist ideal, so there was one emblem meant to signify that one state and one communist ideal. Individuals were supposed to be humble, not important."

Now, the helmet is not strictly part of the arms, but is part of the achievement (or overall display) of the arms, and in this case being a simple helmet turned to the side would indicate an untitled bearer (i.e. not a noble).

heraldry,37s2wl,h0axpunk,14,Fri May 29 22:57:05 2015 UTC,"First of all, be warned that you might not be entitled to any coat of arms. Most people aren't. And coats of arms are never connected simply to surnames, but always to lineages or families. You have to be able to proof your descent (usually in the male line) from someone who was definitively entitled to those arms.  I just googled ""Agnone stemma"", and this is the first thing to come up.  It's the coat of arms of the City of Agnone. Unless there's also a family named Agnone, that uses the same arms, this is not a family or personal coat of arms.  The shape of the shield or the exact shape of the gryphon or anything else means nothing, heraldically. The arms is always and only defined by its blazon, i.e. its description in heraldic terms. The specific style or shape is left to the artists, and may only indicate the period in which the specific drawing was made.  Also, colours, animals or other objects don't have any hidden meaning. Heraldry is not a secret language. If the meaning isn't obviously hinting to your family's history or name (see canting arms), like the 'A' here, they don't mean anything specific (except of course for the meaning that the original creator of the arms intended). Sometimes there are legends about why a coat of arms looks like it does, but you can't read that from the arms.  In the version I linked above, the crown is a mural crown, which is common for Italian municipalities. In Italy, golden mural crowns indicate city status, silver crowns are for other municipalities. Crowns above the shield would be an indicator for a rank of nobility. Inside the shield they don't have any such meaning, but it's still not that common for commoners to have a crown in their shield."
heraldry,37qf8g,cfvh,5,Fri May 29 16:01:17 2015 UTC,"Anne-Marie Dagmar Ingrid was born in 1946 and is the youngest of Frederick IX of Denmark and Ingrid of Sweden's three daughters. In 1964, two weeks after her eighteenth birthday, she married King Constantine II of Greece.  Since Constantine II is a male line descendant of Christian IX of Denmark, he is also a Prince of Denmark and bears the arms of Denmark as a dynastic inescutcheon over his Greek arms.  There are differences in Anne Marie's and Constantine's Danish arms, however... Look at the third quarter. The Danish inescutcheon of the Greek arms (dexter) have a silver stockfish on a red field, representing Iceland. Anne-Marie's Danish arms do not.  Iceland was part of the Danish realm until 1944. It had been a kingdom in its own right from 1918 up to that point. The arms of Iceland actually changed in 1903, after Constantine's branch began reigning in Greece (1864), to a silver falcon on a blue field. The change did not take effect in Greece since their royal family issued from an earlier Danish king. The Icelandic falcon was dropped from the Danish royal arms only in 1948, four years after Iceland became a republic."

In both cases the inescutcheon displays an actual active title, not just the dynastic arms. When Victoria became British queen (and thus the thrones were separated), the inescutcheon was removed, even though the dynasty hadn't changed."

But remember the overall idea is still to create a distinctly recognisable emblem. This one seems a little busy, maybe.  Also, while it is the current vogue for there to be distinct symbolism and meaning to the charges and devices, remember it's not necessary, nor required. It doesn't have to act as a pictogram with something from every aspect of your life.  Now, that's all just IMHO.  The biggest issue I see is the azure on sable field. Yes, I see the fret is outlined in or, but it's still kind of low contrast. There are always exceptions, of course, but the general rule in heraldry is ""metal on colour, colour on metal, never metal on metal or colour on colour""  Think street signs. It's about creating contrast so that it's easily viewable from a distance.  Still lovely to see people taking an interest. Good stuff, keep it up."

The coat of arms of Stavanger and the logo of the municipality of Stavanger, the latter featuring a mural crown.  From ""Stavanger and its Surroundings"" by Véronique Mignot-Bari: ""In the past, this symbol was often mistaken for the branch of an oak tree, but the assumption that the city's emblem was really portrayed by a vine branch was reinforced little by little over the years. It was firstly confirmed by the discovery of a silver seal dating back to 1591, with the vine branch design, and then, upon consulting the Stavanger council archives, it was concluded that the vine branch was, in fact, the most used."" [...] ""In 1939, after much controversy, it was decided by 46 votes to 22 to use the vine branch on the Stavanger Coat of Arms. One of the deciding factors was that, as the vine branch symbolises wine - therefore alcohol - and as Stavanger was known for its abstinence, this would add more credit to its mission against alcohol abuse. Another reason was that the vine was also a symbol of Christianity, which would equally add more weight to this theory.""  From Wikipedia: ""Hallvard Trætteberg (1898–1987), a leading specialist in heraldry, was commissioned to design the official coat of arms of Stavanger, a work that lasted from the end of the 1920s until approved in 1939. His design is also used as the city's arms, flag and seal. The coat of arms is based upon a seal which dated 1591. It shows a branch of vine (Vitis vinifera). Which leaves and branch type that is depicted on the coat of arms has been hotly debated. The original meaning and representation of the vine remains unknown."""

Think about how white and argent would look if you had them as different tinctures. For example: ""Argent, a wolf White"" would just be a plain white shield as it would be white on white.  And to be fair, I'm not positive it is even a thing in Portuguese heraldry. There are only two examples of Portuguese heraldry which uses white as a separate tincture and this could well be just a case of bad heraldry."

Years ago {71}I came across the statement that a white label belonged only to the Royal Family, and could be used by no one else. I am sorry to say that though I have searched high and low I cannot find the authority for the statement, nor can I learn from any officer of arms that the existence of such a rule is asserted; but there is this curious confirmation that in the warrants by which the various labels are assigned to the different members of the Royal Family, the labels are called white labels. Now the label of the Prince of Wales is of three points and is plain. Heraldry knows nothing of the black lines which in drawing a coat of arms usually appear for the outline of a charge. In older work such lines are absent. In any case they are only mere accidents of draughtsmanship. Bearing this in mind, and bearing in mind that the sinister supporter of the Prince of Wales is a unicorn argent, how on earth is a plain label of argent to be depicted thereupon? Now it is necessary also that the label shall be placed upon the crest, which is a lion statant guardant or, crowned with the coronet of the Prince, and upon the dexter supporter which is another golden lion; to place an argent label upon either is a flat violation of the rule which requires that metal shall not be placed upon metal, nor colour upon colour; but if the unicorn is considered argent, which it is, it would if really depicted in silver be quite possible to paint a white label upon it, for the distinction between white and silver is marked, and a white label upon a gold lion is not metal upon metal."""

They're alright for crests and supporters, but when used on the escutcheon they're often indistinguishable from other tinctures. When I first saw your arms I assumed the sanguine was gules.  Also, I'd recommend abstaining from using supporters as they are usually only granted to people with honours. People assuming arms only need an escutcheon, helmet & mantling, crest, and motto at most.  The crest should be placed on top of the helmet and both should be solid colour -- assuming the eagle is just supposed to be blazoned ""Or"".  The grapes aren't really necessary being at the bottom. If it's supposed to be a compartment, then the vine should be big enough so that the supporters can stand on it. However, like I said, I don't recommend you use supporters. Though a heraldic artist could incorporate them as an external detail as artistic license, like being behind the shield. Or, you could even make the double headed eagle in the crest hold a bunch of grapes instead so it will always be in the coat of arms despite artistic interpretation.  Regardless, it's a good start."
heraldry,36q7qw,Mididoom,2,Thu May 21 10:55:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the informative response.  I didn't know that supporters were for people with honors.  The crest definitely needs work, I put it as a placeholder while I decide the details of the helm I like, but I guess that can always be adjusted later so I should use a better placeholder.  The grapes are representative of my hometown and I was trying to incorporate them somehow.  Ill see if I can get a good representation of the eagle holding them because I like that idea.  How would that affect the blazon?  I liked how you wrote it."
heraldry,36q7qw,Decabowl,2,Thu May 21 18:24:21 2015 UTC,"No worries. Just to elaborate, within the College of Arms (England) and I think also the Lord Lyon (Scotland), supporters are only granted to people with some kind of honour or who are royalty. That's why it's recommend that people assuming coat of arms in places without a heraldic authority shouldn't use them because it's presumptuous. However, supporters can also be used in national, civic, and corporational heraldry.  Yeah, I'd do that too. Coming up with your own coat of arms is a lengthy process. I've been at it for about 6 months and I'm still not entirely sure. I'm considering posting what I've come up with so far on this subreddit. I think there are some sites that offer free consultation on this sort of stuff which helps speed up the process, but I can't remember where. I'll post it if I find it.  Cool, that sort of symbolism is awesome. The blazon would probably become:  ""(Party) per pale azure and gules, a double headed eagle displayed in chief grasping in its dexter talon a cluster of grapes and two lions passant sinister in base, all within a bordure Or""  I made the grapes Or since I think it would look better than proper (Purpure slipped vert (purple fruit and green leaves and stem)) within the design, but it's up to you."

I always thought they were only in the British Isles and North America.   That's because Anglo-saxon freemasonry and Continental freemasonry are quite different and have split in the 19th century.   In Anglo-saxon countries, freemasonry is still working as originally: it's a hierarchical secret society with a required creed; itsmembers help each other, but they don't have a common political agenda (on the contrary political discussion is banned).  In Continental Europe (and Latin America), though, the masonic lodges became the meeting place of liberals, republicans and bonapartists after the fall of Napoleon and the restauration of absolute monarchy throughout the continent. Those lodges embraced secularism (removing the requirement of faith, which prompted the schism with Anglo freemasons) and actively fought against the Catholic Church. They had quite a big impact on politics and history of Catholic countries, for instance on the unification of Italy. That's where all the conspiracy theories on masonry come from.  Now as for Denmark, it follows the Swedish rite, which is yet another branch of freemasonry. It is specifically Christian, bans members from favoritism between each other, encourages them to do charitable work, and has a deeply mystical tone."

heraldry,35mxmn,alphaomicron,2,Tue May 12 09:18:22 2015 UTC,I wouldn't assume it is bleu celeste and I wouldn't encourage it either...
heraldry,35mxmn,cfvh,1 point,Tue May 12 14:04:32 2015 UTC,I know you don't like stains but I think Bleu Celeste and Argent go well together. Of course it can easily be Azure but I think a darker blue would definitely look worse.
heraldry,35mxmn,Decabowl,2,Tue May 12 19:25:40 2015 UTC,"Bleu celeste isn't a stain, it's an attempt to introduce another tincture when it's simply just azure depicted in a lighter form. It is particularly problematic when one needs to find the blazon from an emblazon. We cannot assume it is bleu celeste when some habitually depict azure itself to be lighter.  Heraldic tinctures should be limited to the simplest identifiable colours with no distinction made between lighter and darker shades. How many different shades of each colour do we need?"
heraldry,35mxmn,cfvh,1 point,Tue May 12 22:26:36 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I totally agree with you. I also dislike the numerous ""extra"" tinctures that exists... I just like sky blue and white."

And while what you describe should work, (I know of some Dutch family arms who do this with different tincture.) it might have a little bit to much of a White three of Gondor vibe for my taste to have a single unrooted tree argent."
heraldry,35mxmn,alphaomicron,4,Mon May 11 21:18:33 2015 UTC,"I guess it's not so much that it is cluttered. For me the two trees are equally strong as focal points, so when I first look at it I'm not sure where my attention should go. A single tree would solve this issue. Having two trees on differently coloured fields could also solve this issue (as I would sequentially 'read' the shield from left to right), but then it could be confused to be an impalement. Maybe it's just me though?"

heraldry,35mxmn,Decabowl,7,Mon May 18 17:56:36 2015 UTC,"No way.  These are crowded.  My design-sense tells me that the acorns might get ""lost"" from a distance, but I'm sitting here looking at the thumbnail and they're still legible.  Nice work."

heraldry,35mxmn,alphaomicron,5,Mon May 11 22:00:54 2015 UTC,"Yes! Making them smaller would definitely be an improvement.  Also, should it not mention that the trees are 'eradicated' ?  edit: Maybe also specify that they are oak trees? Novice at blazonry here, trying to learn."

heraldry,35mxmn,cfvh,3,Tue May 12 00:17:54 2015 UTC,"Not a problem. If they were vertically aligned it would be in pale. If they were diagonally it would be in bend if going right to left and in bend sinister if going left to right.   In general, you can arrange charges in the position of most ordinaries and just call it in [ordinary]."
heraldry,35mxmn,cfvh,5,Tue May 12 00:36:07 2015 UTC,"I think this is freaking cool! One of my favorite coat of arms right away!  I do agree with what /u/alphaomicron said, that:    For me the two trees are equally strong as focal points, so when I first look at it I'm not sure where my attention should go.   but it was only for a moment before I understood the whole coat of arms and now that sensation is gone. So I don't know if it's a problem that even needs to be resolved... but perhaps you could try intertwining the roots of the two trees in the middle; I suppose it would turn the two figures into one and alleviate the focal dissonance, maybe..  But really: I'm jealous -- in a good way :)  Couple of questions: Is that your personal CoA? Did you draw it yourself or is there a new CoA designing software I haven't heard about?"
heraldry,35mea8,Jw1105,6,Mon May 11 18:20:03 2015 UTC,"The arms are traced back to an old communion cup that is dated around 1625 and part of a set of 4, one for each of the villages connected to the local church. With the lack of nobility in Friesland and the use of a latin motto, it is likely that a cleric possibly the local pastor of the so called ""Aengwirden"" designed these.   The blazon, literally translated from Dutch reads: In sable (literally black) a skull from the front, resting on two crossed bones, everything in silver, with from the eye sockets each three ears of grain with stem all in vert (literally green). Motto: On a white lint in black capitels: ""Ressurrectio"" (Ressurection).  Note the Vert on Sable, it is very possible that the tincture system as we know it today had not yet made it to that rural part of the world."
heraldry,35mea8,Decabowl,4,Mon May 11 18:37:31 2015 UTC,"Regarding the Vert on Sable: if something is part of a charge but different in colour, it does not have to follow the rule of tincture since it is not said to be charged on the field but coming from the charge.   For example, you could have a lion Or on a field Gules that is armed Azure. Normally you couldn't have Azure on Gules, but in this case you could. That might be the same for this arms if one can say that the ears of grain are coming from the skull."
heraldry,35mea8,MoggFanatic,5,Mon May 11 19:42:42 2015 UTC,"That is a good point if it is blazoned a bit creatively it could be correct. Al tough it wouldn't be without discussion.

heraldry,35mqvw,alphaomicron,7,Mon May 11 22:13:13 2015 UTC,"Bosnia did it a little better, with a stilized version of the country's shape.  What unites the two countries is the fact that they have to avoid any symbols (incl. colours) that are associated with only one of their ethnicities, so they are almost required to use a non-historic design that doesn't carry a lot of meaning.

Not being a member of the UN won't stop these 110 states from treating Kosovo as a fully sovereign state.  Indeed, the greatest obstacle to Kosovo becoming a UN member are the veto of Russia and China. China in particular doesn't want to recognise Kosovo as that would undermine their claims on Taiwan (also not a UN member, but de facto very much a sovereign state).  Like I said initially, it depends on who you ask. It is a rather tricky matter. Presumably you are from a country that doesn't recognize Kosovo? I guess that's perfectly fine. But that opinion won't stop Kosovo from being treated as a sovereign state by a whole lot of other states.  edit: spelling and wording"
heraldry,35mqvw,alphaomicron,-1,Tue May 12 17:15:03 2015 UTC,"De Jure, it is not a state. Plain and simple. Russia and Chinas veto essentially will forever block it from functioning as one in its own right. UN membership has become the symbol of statehood in essence, there are far too many things it cannot do, and rights it is not entitled to, without membership.  Can it function as a quasi state? Yes, but then so can say, pennsylvania, in almost the same way."
heraldry,35mqvw,dzoni1234,3,Tue May 12 17:31:54 2015 UTC,"Actually...  de jure statehood is established by treaty between various states, generally bilateral treaties.  UN recognition helps, but it is not the requirement to be a state.  It can effectively acknowledge the existence of a state, and confirm its existence, but non-recognition by the UN does not prevent it being a state.  Then again, there are bodies recognised by the UN that are not technically states as they don't have any land - Sovereign Order of Malta for one, (maybe) Palestine for another (depending on whether you want to count the disputed territories in Israel as theirs).    Even China and Russia have quasi-diplomatic relations with Kosovo at the moment, and their veto could be withdrawn at any time, leaving it far from being ""blocked forever""."

heraldry,352v8b,nelg,5,Wed May 6 18:59:22 2015 UTC,"Sable, a summation operator argent.  I've thought up a variety of symbols to represent myself through the years (usually in the form of emblems/seals), so I already had some themes to work with. Admittedly it wasn't very hard to turn into a coat of arms as the elements have always been simple.  The capital sigma is used in mathematics to represent a summation operator, a symbol I picked because of my personal motto: Progress is the sum of efforts. It is doubly appropriate due to my background in physics and mathematics. I suppose it is a rather untraditional heraldric charge, but I figured if Stenungsund Municipality can have a diagrammatic representation of a hydrocarbon molecule in its coat of arms, I can have a mathematical operator in mine. I also like the idea of themes found in heraldry moving with the times.  The colours are chosen as I have always enjoyed the simple elegance found in black and white typography, and in particular my love for blackboards (no doubt from spending countless hours watching professors scribble stuff on them).  I have intentionally chosen to omit any crest, helm, supporters, mantling, etc. Not only am I fan of minimalism, but all those elements add a sense of grandiosity which I feel would misrepresent my personal views. I am just a small living organism flying around the universe on a rock after all.  I am happy to hear any thoughts and suggestions!"

I'm not sure if you can rotate a chevron, but you could have that and two bars argent on sable."

Would this way of blazoning the hydrocarbon molecule be needed because in medieval times such a thing was unknown? Where would one draw the line?

In my humble opinion, a summation operator is not a letter or number, but as much a symbol as a lot of common charges.

I find it odd that one would insist upon not having a crest given that a coat of arms itself is seen by most people as ""grandiose"".  Coats of arms are based off of medieval armory... The mantling (representative of a war-tattered surcoat), helm (obviously part of the armor), and crest (for tournaments/jousting) are all integral parts since time immemorial. If one doesn't believe in any of those then one really shouldn't believe in the shield either.  Letters, numbers, et cetera. The summation operator exists in the same realm as numbers and letters. It is the Greek letter sigma, after all."
heraldry,352v8b,DrostanRoss,2,Thu May 7 03:13:00 2015 UTC,"No worries, no party pooping taken! It is exactly this kind of feedback and discussion that I was looking for.  I was aware that text/numbers are considered poor practice (which I tend to agree with). However, my thought process was as follows: A summation operator and a greek letter sigma are actually distinct things. One is a mathematical tool, the other a greek letter. It is the mathematical tool that I wanted as a charge, it just so happens to be denoted as a large capital sigma. This is indeed very nitpicky, and I guess you are perfectly correct in that mathematical notation is wholly within the realm of letter and numbers. I will use the suggested method to get around this issue (thanks all!).  Assuming you agree that contemporary heraldry should be free to adopt contemporary themes, how would you suggest wholly theoretical constructs be represented? Perhaps by drawing analogies to things/processes that exist physically? What if such an analogy is not possible?  Regarding helms/crests and other such things, I am most familiar with swedish heraldry in which a crest and helm are supposed to be inseparable from the shield, and I've seen plenty of examples of arms without such. However, now that I think about it these tend to be the arms of places (such as the Stenungsund Municipality example I gave in the OP). I need to find out if the rules are different for individuals.  It IS a bit odd to insist on just having a shield with the rationale I gave, and for years I avoided making a coat of arms at all for this very reason. This was meant to be more of an experiment to answer the question ""IF I had to represent myself with a coat of arms, what choices would I make?"". I originally looked up if there were alternative shapes other than a shield, but it seems these are reserved for women or clergy.  Apologies for the essay... I like to discuss things."
heraldry,352v8b,Dgtre,2,Thu May 7 10:57:24 2015 UTC,"Assuming you agree that contemporary heraldry should be free to adopt contemporary themes, how would you suggest wholly theoretical constructs be represented? Perhaps by drawing analogies to things/processes that exist physically? What if such an analogy is not possible?   Personally I would say go for it and see if you can use charges, ordinaries and subordinaries as an analogy for your idea mainly because it makes the arms that much more personal to you. On the other hand, for something like the summation operator, I don't see it as being that poor practice as it is the only thing on the shield. If you used a string or something then yes I wouldn't quite agree with it.   Regarding helms/crests and other such things, I am most familiar with swedish heraldry in which a crest and helm are supposed to be inseparable from the shield, and I've seen plenty of examples of arms without such. However, now that I think about it these tend to be the arms of places (such as the Stenungsund Municipality example I gave in the OP). I need to find out if the rules are different for individuals.   Municipalities sometimes do not have helms and mantling as they are an organisation rather than an individual and thus your town can't literally wear a suit of armour. Individuals on the other hand do have helms and mantling (except for women in some areas since they never went to war generally) so I would say you probably should have some. In saying that, the shield is the most important piece of a coat of arms as it will be the most widely used part of it. When arms are used, in most cases it is without the crest, helm, mantling and supporters anyway."
heraldry,351kb2,BaronIronside,3,Wed May 6 10:05:00 2015 UTC,That's more of a crest than a coat of arms.  I would expect to see something like that sitting on top of a helmet.

Napoleon re-established the nobility in 1808 out of the desire to create a stable elite comprising both the old nobility and prominent members of the middle-class. While suppressing old titles, he introduced the hierarchy system of denoting the individual's occupation with the Empire's state mechanism on the arms themselves.  Personally, as much as I fancy the Empire, I think the heraldic system was quite ugly with the slapping on of elements with no real concern for aesthetic presentation. Reform of the heraldic system to be more in line with Napoleonic principles could have been done without altering the old mechanisms too profoundly."

Exactly. I like how everything was standardized, and some symbols such as the imperial eagle and bees were amazing, but overall most of those coats of arms end up being just ugly.   People can say what they want, old French (or English) shields look much nicer than those quasi-squares. Using so much vair. Why?! It's almost always an eyesore. Putting ordinaries such as cantons and quarters automatically without concern for what is behind. At least if it was a chief, the other elements could have been reorganized to fit under it.

You see the semy of lilies on blue and you know you are dealing with french royalty. Black eagles on gold is a sign you should start behaving yourself in front of the emperor and so on and so forth.   So actually making the heraldry so rigid that not only your rank but also career is on there pleases my inner OCD. By just looking at the arms you know with whom you are dealing before ever getting close to the man.   But yeah, the execution of it was certainly ugly.

heraldry,34u25j,SamMcKitt,5,Mon May 4 15:48:25 2015 UTC,"Charlotte, like her uncle Harry, would have to have a label indicating her genealogical position, that is, a great-grandchild. She would have a label of 7 points.  Daughters of heirs in direct line typically have crosses Gules with some other charge on their labels. For Charlotte, I would recommend that points 1, 3, 5, and 7 of her label be left blank. Points 2 and 6 would have a cross Gules and point 4 (the middle) would have an acorn Gules. Basically:  Blank-Cross-Blank-Acorn-Blank-Cross-Blank  Upon becoming granddaughter of the sovereign at Charles' accession, a warrant could be issued dropping the outer two points of the label so she would bear a label do five points. Points 1 and 5 would have a cross Gules and point 3 (the middle) would have an acorn Gules. Points 2 and 4 would be blank:  Cross-Blank-Acorn-Blank-Cross  Upon becoming daughter of the sovereign at William's accession, a warrant could be issued dropping the second and fourth points, leaving a label of three points:  Cross-Acorn-Cross  As Prince George is a direct heir, he should have a label of three points like his father, the center point with an acorn Gules. He could keep these arms right up to the point he becomes heir apparent, when he would have a plain label of three points.  The crosses Gules could all be switched out for escallops Gules as well.  EDIT: Here is a schematic for my thoughts on Charlotte's arms... E for England, S for Scotland, and I for Ireland... The charges on the labels are crosses Gules (borne by every eldest daughter of a (future) sovereign except for Charlotte of Wales, I believe) and acorns slipped and leafed Gules (a nod to the mother's arms). Top left as great-granddaughter, top right as granddaughter, and bottom middle as daughter of the sovereign."

Would the tree be called eradicated because the roots are showing, or would there have to be more definition in the roots for that to count?

If the number of points is not important to represent the person/entity to whom the CoA is assigned, you can definitely just use ""stars."" The tree one is more tricky. The only thing I know for sure is that the tree that is represented on the flag/CoA of Gondor is the White Tree. As you can see here, all representations of the tree seem to show it uprooted, so the blazon should probably definitely mention that. Conversely, some interpretations seem to display something resembling leaves on the tree, so I don't think that detail is specific to this CoA, and as such should not be in the blazon.   Edit: I just noticed that some of the CoA in the link above have pentagrams instead of octagrams, so I don't even know about that anymore. Perhaps the correct blazon should just mention ""stars"" as opposed to any name referring to the number of points of the stars."
heraldry,33t41u,VladVV,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:13:43 2015 UTC,"This page seems to think that the stars are five-pointed, but who knows if that was Tolkien's intention. I guess that it really comes down to how it was described in the books, if Tolkien specified a specific number of points or just said ""stars"". I thought as much. After all, why even put the roots there if it wasn't mentioned in the blazon? I don't know about the leaves thing, though. It looks to me more like a majority portray the tree without leaves, so those that do might be taking a bit of artistic license. If I recall correctly, the tree didn't have leaves during the events of the book on account of it being dead, so it would stand to reason that the Gondorians, when portraying it in their arms, would leave out the leaves. It was only after Aragorn became king that they planted a new sapling, so maybe the ones with leaves are the arms of Gondor in the Fourth Age? Purely speculation, though."
heraldry,33t41u,dedokire,2,Sat Apr 25 19:22:10 2015 UTC,"Well, okay.  In addition to this, I've noticed that far from all interpretations of the coat of arms display the stars chevronwise. A majority display the stars as an enarched fess, and most don't ensign the tree with a crown.

That year had also been designated as the International Year of the World’s Indigenous Peoples by the United Nations, an event that inspired the heralds to propose as supporters “raven-bears,” a new heraldic beast combining two creatures that are particularly significant in aboriginal symbolism. The colours repeat those of the arms.  The supporters stand on an outcrop of the geological formation known as the Canadian Shield, representing the solid foundations on which the Authority has been established. The rock is strewn with red maple leaves and gold maple seeds. The motto, HONORENTUR PATRIAM HONORANTES, means “Let us honour those who honour our country” and it emphasizes the nature of heraldry as an honour granted by the Crown and its status as a major component of the national honours system.  Arms of the Canadian Heraldic Authority Arms of the Canadian Heraldic AuthorityThe shield features the maple leaf of Canada charged with a smaller shield, which indicates the heraldic responsibilities of the Authority.  The crest consists of the crowned lion resting its paw on a shield, symbolizing the fact that the Governor General is the head of the Authority and that heraldic emblems are honours flowing from the Canadian Crown.  The supporters are special heraldic beasts, half raven and half polar bear. Many First nations in Canada regard the raven as a creator or transformer, while the polar bear is known for its strength and endurance. These supporters represent the responsibility of Canada's heralds to create symbols for a wide range of Canadian institutions and individuals.

(Source)  The legal text defining the arms is: ""Das Wappen der Stadt Papenburg zeigt einen von links nach rechts steigenden schwarzen, gekrönten Löwen im roten Feld"", a blazon in heraldic terms would be ""In Rot ein linksgewandter, schwarzer, golden gekrönter Löwe."""

A note on Eltonjohnworld.com says:   ...high above on each wall is Elton's coat of arms. It shows a knight's helmet, and below piano keys, gold discs, and his motto: ""Eltono Es Bueno"" (Elton is good).   Note that the discs are not gold in this picture; however, this excerpt from http://www.heraldica.org/topics/famous/music.htm indicates the shield itself is correctly colored:   Roger Forder writes: According to the December 1988 issue of The Heraldry Gazette, Elton John's shield is blazoned as follows:  Per saltire gules and or, in fess two pellets pierced and  in pale as many plates also pierced, on a chief argent issuant in chief seven pallets retrait two three and two sable.   The arms were granted in 1986.  The chief indeed represents part of a piano keyboard;  the pierced roundels no doubt represent discs (i.e. records  -  vinyl and silver/platinum?);  red and gold are apparently the colours of Watford Football Club of which EJ is/was Chairman.   As a side note, ""El Tono es Bueno"" means ""the sound is good"" in Spanish, but that is a clever double entendre."

heraldry,32f1z8,Mididoom,2,Mon Apr 13 07:07:10 2015 UTC,"Here's my opinion of each of them, since I want attention to see some debate.  NSW: Too cluttered. I don't like the St George cross and the lions  I think it'd be better to reference Wales rather than England for name's sake. Also, wheat and golden fleece are in so many different colonial arms that it starts to become cliche and meaningless.  EDIT: Just realised that the lions can represent Wales. It'd be nice if the rest looked less British though. Also, dragons are cooler. Just saying.  QLD: Worst one here. Faux-quartering? Check. Use of ""proper"" to sneak past the rule of tincture? Check. Boring generic symbols that could apply to any state? Check. It reminds me of communist heraldry. The crown's OK for canting, but I don't see what the maltese cross has to do with anything. I know not everything in heraldry has to mean something, but still...  SA: Awesome. All it needs is some supporters.  TAS: It has potential, but the faux-quartering ruins it. I like that it used apples and hops because it was the first place in Australia to grow them (yay, relevant symbolism!) and I like the creative way of representing hydro-electricity. However, I think there could be a better crest.  VIC: Generic. It could just as easily be the coat of arms of any other state of even Australia itself. For the escutcheon, I'd put something like a gold bordure/orle to reference gold as the national mineral. Supporters are literally just the motto. The crown for namesake/canting is fine IMO.  WA: Nice, but I don't see why it has to have a crown in its crest. I'm generally against the opinion of royal symbols in state heraldry unless it's canting (Queensland, Victoria) because I don't see what the individual states have to do with the British Monarchy."

heraldry,31upcn,Jw1105,7,Tue Apr 21 14:14:27 2015 UTC,"So I promised to post more if I though of anything, I had some time to kill so made this little guide about starting heraldic research in the Netherlands. A lot of it overlaps with genealogical research, but I hope it is useful anyway.   How to find out if your family has a coat of arms if you are Dutch:  In the Netherlands the use of coat of arms by urban merchants and artisans was very common, and throughout the golden age when literacy reached levels unprecedented anywhere in Europe at that time even many farmers decided to adopt arms either to sign legal documents, or just to decorate their farm houses. Besides the high literacy rates, big middle class and generally well to do independent farmers the fact that Dutch Roman Law permitted anybody to adopt and carry arms resulted in a very large amount of burgher arms. The Dutch Heraldic Databank alone has a collection of around 100.000 of them. This large amount of arms makes it more likely that you find historic arms which are appropriate for you to bear then in countries that had a much more official type of registration like in England or Scotland, however it does far from guarantee it.  Step 1: Who were my ancestors?  To find out if any of your direct male ancestors made use of any arms it is first of all important to find out who they were, what they did and where they were from. Since we are only interested in our direct male ancestors we are going to make something called a Patrilineal Descend Serie (Stamreeks). Fortunately when doing genealogical research about Dutch people, the vast majority of it can be done from behind a computer. There are two different kind of sources you will work with, first of all are records from the Civil Registry (Burgerlijke Stand) introduced in the Napoleonic time and holds all the records from after 1804. These records are published by the Dutch government after a certain period and most pre-war Civil Registry records are no openly available on the website listed below. The other kind are DTB Books ( Baptism, Marriage, Funeral Books) which mandatory held registration of all Dutch people since the Eternal Edict of 1611. The first source you will use is: www.Gahetna.nl (Available in English), this is website maintained by the Dutch government and is a goldmine of genealogical data. It has most Pre-War Civil registry records, a lot of DTB records, Military records, VOC records and much, much more. The second main source is: www.Genver.nl an amazing collection of images (scans) of Civil Registry, DTB and many other sources. It is much harder to use since it is not digitalized, but it holds a collection of 43.864.667 Dutch and 18.375.044 Belgian scans of genealogic material. Besides that there are many other websites like www.Delpher.nl holds a searchable records of most newspapers ever published in the Netherlands. And there are regional projects like the Bommelewaardse Boom on www.juweliervanwijnen.net that has mapped most of the families origination from the Bommeler, Hoexe and Alblasserwaard. Other government websites that can be of use are for example the Dutch Family Tree Database http://www.stamboomnederland.nl (Partly available in English) or the Dutch Family Name Database http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/nfb/ In general, google is your friend. Try searching one of your ancestors with a unique name, the Netherlands has a very lively and open genealogic community and there are 1000’s of digital ahnentafels out there, there is a fairly big change that somebody somewhere has done at least part of your work for you. With these tools you should be able to track your patrilineal family line till at least the 1700’s.  Step 2: Checking the obvious sources:  As mentioned earlier the Dutch government set up a database of arms and has a collection of around 100.000 arms. You can search it by name and check it out at www.heraldischedatabank.nl, however this is not always a useful source since a big part of these arms are from the Muschart collection. An old and very big collection of arms on fiches that have not yet been fully digitalised. If you do get a hit on your family name here there are two options. Either it has a name or a place attached to it and you can be quite certain if these arms belonged to your ancestor or not, or there is very little information available. In which case you can either pay the Central Buro for Genealogy www.cbg.nl , who maintains the database, to look it up in their archive or go down there yourself in The Hague. The Next source that has a huge collection, but very little information. But is probably worth checking is Rietstaps, Amorial Général. A work made by the Dutch herald Rietstap documenting most of the arms used in Europe at his time. An online version is available here https://archive.org/details/armorialgnra01rietuoft , there are also illustrated versions out there and ones easier to search, but this one is on the most reliable website. You can find a few of them fairly easy using google.  Step 3: Less obvious sources:  Hopefully these sources and genealogical research have snowballed you on what you need to know or the direction you need to research in. However if it has not taken you far enough in the rabbit hole to find your way yourself there are still some option you can try. In some cases i have found very useful information in the pre-Napoleonic land registries, mainly useful for farming ancestors, most of them have been transcribed, digitalized and can be found here http://www.hogenda.nl/hogenda-leenkamers/ . Another tip is to take a close look at what your ancestors did or if they had any secondary functions. Even if they are come from humble birth, are farmers or artisans there is still a change they held other functions like church elder or deacon, member of local government as Schout or Schepen. If your ancestor did NOT live in a city, these functions would have been open for anybody. However within city walls most of these functions would have been oligarchised, and you are not a descendent from a “regenten” family, you will probably not find your name there. If you find individuals like these, local archives can be your best bet. Most of them have an index of their collection online, however your will most likely still have to either go down there or pay them to scan the item in able to view it. Another source you might be dealing with is De Nederlandsche Leeuw the main magazine for genealogical and heraldic research in the Netherlands. They are digitalised and searchable on www.knggw.nl , but not free to look in the actual text. You can either order a digital version from their website, or go to a scientific library, they might carry the magazine.  Conclusion:  I hope this little guide has given you enough tools to start of your research. Make sure to share the result on the subreddit if you find anything. We always enjoy seeing our readers personal arms. If you have any questions about this guide or Dutch coat of arms you can contact /u/jw1105, I might have the answer if I have the time and knowledge.   It might be a litle bit more suitable for a Wiki then a FAQ, but i hope somebody can use it anyway."

heraldry,31upcn,Mididoom,3,Wed Apr 15 15:15:05 2015 UTC,"new to this sub, but some questions i would have...    the significance of helmets, style, face on or side on, does it mean anything?    different styles of shields (and diamonds, roundels etc.) also shields at an angle (eg. arms of Sir John Swinton)    is the mantling just at the designers discretion, any significance of different types,    and more questions along these lines, pretty much the very basics"
heraldry,31upcn,Mididoom,3,Sat Apr 11 00:48:01 2015 UTC,"We'll add those to the FAQ, and I can answer them here as well.  Different types of helm generally indicate the rank of the arms' owner. The styles of helm vary by the country but in Britain and other Commonwealth countries they are:  Commoner: steel helm, visor closed  Knight: steel helm, visor open  Nobleman: silver helm, gold bars  Monarch: gold helm, gold bars  A man may display his arms on any form of shield from any era, but a woman may only use a lozenge (diamond) or a cartouche (oval), since a shield is a military device and women traditionally don't go to war. This rule also applies to clergymen in some countries. Displaying a shield at an angle is just a stylistic thing imitating the way shields used to be displayed in the Middle Ages.  Asides from its colour, mantling is completely at the artist's discretion, and can be as realistic or as fanciful as he pleases."
heraldry,31upcn,Krynnadin,3,Sat Apr 11 06:56:57 2015 UTC,"Some of these rules hold true only for the British Isles, etc. Women may use shields in countries where arms are assumed, etc. in Canada, women do not have to use lozenges."

heraldry,31rpk3,captain_goodnight,8,Tue Apr 7 17:21:53 2015 UTC,"There isn't actually such thing as a family coat of arms. Arms belong to individual people, not entire families; sometimes two people with the same surname can have entirely different arms. Unless you or your direct ancestor has a grant of arms from the College of Heralds you have no right to bear arms.   Having said that, Burke's General Armory records several arms for people of the name Gill. Some of them are in Hertfordshire, meaning it's quite possible you're related to one of them. If you really wanted to, you could trace your ancestry back to them and then use a version of their arms with the appropriate differencing marks to show your descent.

And finally, the badge, a zebra holding an abbot's crozier, is an allusion to the zebra crossing cover for Abbey Road, the Beatles' final album to be recorded, and also the location of EMI's Abbey Road studios, where the album was recorded."

It depicts a gonfanon which is a special type of banner that was popular during that era especially in religious Christian context. It might be that the one was based on the other or it may just be a coincidence since the motif, while unique to our eyes, enjoyed some popularity in history.

It was first adopted by Italian medieval communes, and later, by local Guilds, Corporations and Districts. The difference between a gonfanon with long tails and a standard is that a gonfanon displays the device on the non-tailed area, and the standard displays badges down the whole length of the flag.

Also is cool.  Made it in an online program because I had the 2 AM heraldry bug and I couldn't be patient with anything else.  Blazon: Azure, border gules, bull statant toward sinister or.  Motto: Percute Peccatum (Strike Sin).  I tried to make the arms reflective of three things: my name, my personality as I see it (so self-flattering), and my worldview. There is also an element of irony within it.  The azure field represents Jupiter, the chief god of the ancient pantheons, as an allegory for order, authority, and justice. It also calls to mind peace, serenity, and the common good.  The border gules represents firstly how sacrifice is necessary in order to maintain said common good, and secondly that chaos and bloodshed always lie outside the boundaries of civilization. It also is an element that is present on the arms of my family's home region.  The bull or is that tincture as it represents my first name, which means ""golden."" In line with the previous elements, it represents wisdom, strength, and steadfastness. It is also reminiscent of my family's origins as laborers and cattle-farmers.  There is a great theme of dualism that I tried to put into the arms. The bull is facing sinister because I have personal feelings of upstartness and lack of place, due to an expatriate lifestyle and being moderately well off and coming from a modest background originally. Also it can represent the sin and the disorder that is within all men, including myself, and that we should consider it a dishonor. Additionally, my middle name means ""usurper"" so it can represent that.  The bull also calls to mind the minotaur, a classic dualistic symbol and representative of the worlds of men and the world of gods and beasts, which in Homeric text are the worlds of civilization, and the worlds of barbarity. One can also see in the bull an ironic gesture twoards the Golden Calf of Biblical lore, which shows the sin of pride and misplaced worship which we are all prone to.  Also I think the Minoans are super cool so the whole bull/minotaur fits with them.  Overall, you get the idea that the azure field, peace and tranquility, is emanated from one interpretation of the bull, and that the animal wards off chaos. Or, you can see the bull as a fifth column within the azure field, threatening to destroy it.  The crest is a rooster for three reasons: first of all my family's peasant background, and the rooster is a common symbol of farmers and agricultural life. My family name means ""victory of the people"" and the rooster is my national symbol, so it's reminiscent of that. Lastly, the rooster symbolizes in some Christian interpretations the victory of light over darkness and good over evil.  Comments, criticism?"

The current coat of arms (shown on the right), adopted in 2002, shows the arms of the three historic regions Bačka, Banat and Srem, each originally granted by the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy.  The traditional coat of arms is from the 1848 revolution. Serbians had proclaimed a state then in southern Hungary (today's Vojvodina). They called it Serbian Vojvodina and adopted a coat of arms that featured an eagle, the Hungarian crown and the Serbian cross.  Based on this history, some parties wanted to introduce the coat of arms shown on the left, which they call the ""traditional"" coat of arms, and which looks suspiciously like the Serbian one. The bill that was introduced to the Assembly also proposed a secondary flag which looks exactly like the Serbian one, just without the arms. Lacking the support of the pro-autonomy parties, the bill failed to get a necessary two-thirds majority.  Google translated story from a Serbian newspaper"

It is supposed to replace the old coat of arms which got declared unconstitutional by some court due to it ""containing religious imagery and/or representing only a single constitutive ethnic group"".  On this latest proposal the red and white colors are there to symbolize the Banja Luka region, while the golden bars are supposed to represent the artistic, material and non-material heritage of the city. The crown is there to symbolize the city's position as the administrative center of the Republic of Srpska. The two bulls symbolize tradition and the literary heritage of a Banja Luka writer Petar Kočić who was an opponent of Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia (and are therefore seen as contentious by some). Finally the motto ""Славна и света"" which transliterates to ""Slavna i sveta"" and means ""Glorious and holy"" is about the Vrbas river and is taken from the work of the Serb poet Jovan Dučić. (edit:) The branch below is a chestnut branch, as the tree is the most recognizable symbol of the city due to it having a lot of them along its streets and them being featured in most pictures and postcards of the city.

The design here is much better as it follows the tincture rules, very easy to recreate and is much less albino-y. However,  as you rightly pointed out, the simpler it becomes, the more likely it's not unique. The best way you can test this is by putting the blazon into Google and seeing if it spits out an answer. Try rewriting you blazon in different ways and different iterations.   Remember, good arms are simple, but not necessarily minimalistic. The arms should say something about you. When they are too generic, they lose meaning.

heraldry,2z5dow,elencus,14,Sun Mar 15 19:02:20 2015 UTC,"Good first attempt. Here are a few of my recommendations:   Don't make it Quartered: Quartered arms are almost always due to two armigerous people marrying. Don't divide your arms. Too many charges: You have, in order of importance, a fox, a goat (is that a banana or are you just happy to see me?), a Cross potent, an uprooted tree, The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, an hawk, a owl and another Cross potent. You're arms are looking more like an Christian albino petting zoo than something noble and dignified. Keep it simple!  Non standard crest: Croatia and The Holy Roman Empire may get away with sneaking more coats of arms, but it doesn't mean it's advisable or prudent. Stick to one Shield with on helm and one crest. Your blazon is wrong: The first and fourth quarters are the foxes, and the second and third are the randy goats.   I hope that helps! Remember that my tongue-in-cheek recommendations are not meant to be malicious.... unless your a goat, in which case: Baaaaaad heraldry!"

heraldry,2ykn34,Krynnadin,2,Tue Mar 10 20:20:16 2015 UTC,"This is more or less how it works in Scotland. The standard system looks something like this, but matriculaters have the option to request some specific difference if they want something more distinctive than a generic bordure.   The main difference would be that cadency is mandatory in Scotland, which makes more sense to me. This is how it was in ancient heraldry; there are records of siblings suing each other over use of the undifferenced arms. The idea that junior family members may use the undifferenced arms is a modern one. And where do you draw the line? How distantly can you be related before you lose the right to use the chief's arms?"
heraldry,2ykn34,SamMcKitt,3,Tue Mar 10 20:28:30 2015 UTC,"I feel arms should descend in perpetuity in the legitimate male line be they differenced or not, or through women with no brothers leaving issue.  Mandatory cadency is a nice idea but it is not effective where there are concerns about the cost of matriculation, etc."
heraldry,2ykn34,Krynnadin,3,Tue Mar 10 20:31:45 2015 UTC,"I do agree that the cost of matriculation is ridiculous. Some form of matriculation is necessary because the armigers themselves can't be trusted to create lawful and unique differences, but I think it would be better for the matriculations to be practical documents rather than expensive illuminated parchments. That would seem to conform to ancient practice; for example, this 17th century matriculation is plain and unadorned, and would cost a fraction of the current price to produce."

heraldry,2y3rqn,Mididoom,2,Fri Mar 6 17:29:22 2015 UTC,"That seems better. Using the hatching system the tinctures of the field would be Or and azure, though I can't make out the tinctures of the ermine spots and whatever those things in chief are (ingots? billets?). Thus a blazon might be: per bend Or and azure, in chief two ingots [tincture], and in base as many ermine spots [tincture]."
heraldry,2y3rqn,chevronel,1 point,Fri Mar 6 17:43:46 2015 UTC,"It's also possible that the dexter side is just plain ermine which of course would be on argent. Since this all comes together on a tiny medallion and hence no room to put lots of minute detail into it and based on the hatching system mentioned above, I would suggest that it might possibly be blazoned: Per Bend, Or and Ermine (the horizontal lines could just be diapering), two Billets fesswise [tincture]. You would not have to state dexter/sinister or chief/base as ermine is it's own thing and thus the two billets would naturally belong to the primary division.  But these things can be tough to determine from such a small sample."
heraldry,2y3rqn,cfvh,2,Fri Mar 6 18:00:48 2015 UTC,"I doubt it would be diapering; it's just horizontal lines, not spirals or floral forms like diapering is usually.

heraldry,2y3rqn,Mikixx,1 point,Fri Mar 6 18:04:56 2015 UTC,"Could well be but then that would make the Ermine spots black (I have never seen them in any other color) which would put black on blue. There are so many possible mistakes to be made on something that small (manufacturing, artist interpretation, etc.) but I am inclined to agree with you on the Azure. I'm not sure we can ever know the tincture of the charges though, that's why I opted for a simpler blazon."

When the field is black with white spots it's called ermines, when it's gold with black spots it's called erminois, and when it's black with gold spots it's called pean.

So theoretically you'd never see American arms with affronte facing helmets or open visors or any supporters at all.   I think that from an artistic point of view that would be a horrible travesty. There is a great tradition of encircling arms with belts (garters) of orders and in ecclesiastical heraldry you see the tassels of office.

heraldry,2xl3kx,cfvh,0,Mon Mar 2 19:59:49 2015 UTC,"Because in Western Europe, ( including much of Germany),  there are no ""family"" arms, because arms are strictly for the identification of individuals, not families, with rules for distinguishing the arms of members of the same family. In theory, no two living people should carry the same arms at once, although arms can be inherited.  In Eastern Europe, (including much of Germany) there are some places where there are indeed ""family arms"". Italy AFAIK follows the Western tradition of individual arms for individuals."

heraldry,2xl3kx,Polskan,1 point,Mon Mar 2 22:00:31 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I'm no heraldry expert and the little I know is from my own family history and our coat of arms.  However I can't find sources stating that there are no ""family"" arms in much of Germany. On the contrary, all I read so far is that individual arms are the exception and family coat of arms are the norm in Germany – for nobility as well as commoners.  There is a distinction between ""Familienwappen"" (family arms) and ""Personenwappen"" (individual arms), but the latter refers mostly to individuals holding public office and clergy, or in some cases to persons who have no offspring and when arms can't be endowed retroactively."
heraldry,2xll35,Decabowl,4,Sun Mar 1 21:29:26 2015 UTC,"TL;DR - That only happens if your mother has no brothers.  Normallly you only inherit arms from your father. Your mother will have brothers to pass the family arms on to their children. However if she has no brothers, her arms will die out unless her children inherit them. Thus the children quarter the paternal and maternal arms together, placing their father's arms in the first and fourth quarters and their mother's arms in the second and third, like this.  If one of the children marries another woman with no brothers, the process is repeated. If a lineage marries a long string of brotherless women, their arms can end up featuring dozens and even hundreds of quartered arms, which has interesting results.  An older method is 'composing' in which the children incorporate symbols from both arms in one unquartered shield. However this often produces ugly and confusing results, so quartering is the universal method nowadays. Note that it's always referred to as 'quartering' even when there's more than four arms in the shield."
heraldry,2xll35,Decabowl,1 point,Sun Mar 1 22:26:29 2015 UTC,"That only happens if your mother has no brothers.   To be fair, that all depends on the laws of inheritance and whether women can inherit.   Where I am from, women do inherit coats of arms along with their brothers so I got my mother's and father's coat of arms. But then, I am nowhere near being in a noble house."

It symbolises Christ's (the cross) dominion over the world (the orb), literally held in the dominion of an earthly ruler (or sometimes celestial being such as an angel). When held by Christ himself, the subject is known in the iconography of Western art as Salvator Mundi (""Saviour of the World""), or in statuary as the Infant Jesus of Prague.

It appears to be linked to one of my ancestors from the 1600s.

Would anybody be willing to redraw this for me in vector and colorize it according to the text here? I'm sorry I don't have any more information than this nor any in English, but I hope it's enough.

On the red - golden bewulsteten (hair-ish) helmet with the same ceiling , a closed , right and left red golden flight (wings).  In other words, I think: Gold Background with two red diamonds.  Then red 'mountains' with two golden pickaxes.  Then a helmet with red-golden flowing hair with the 'hair' on top the same going into Red-golden wings.  Now, the actually coloring of the whole thing -- well, you'll want someone from art school for that.  Mine would be really bad."

heraldry,2x15dh,1magecrafting,2,Wed Feb 25 15:32:11 2015 UTC,"There is no significance to the angle of the shield. In fact, shield shape and angle are never specified in a blazon.

heraldry,2x15dh,bubbleyhoney,2,Wed Feb 25 16:49:30 2015 UTC,"The ""band around the helmet"" is the wulst - or as it appears in the text ""bewulstet"", which should be red-golden.

heraldry,2x15dh,bubbleyhoney,2,Wed Feb 25 09:25:56 2015 UTC,"I take it that the wing colors are meant to be red on one side and gold on the other, like a parrot's wings. Is this unusual for a coat of arms?"
heraldry,2x15dh,1magecrafting,2,Wed Feb 25 14:44:08 2015 UTC,"No it's not unusual. I've only just realized the above translation missed this detail, but it says   ein geschlossener, rechts goldener und links roter Flug.   or    closed wings, golden on the right and red on the left   which means the wings' colours in /u/12kohl's otherwise excellent attempt are switched. Crude mspaint illustration of my understanding. Correct me if I'm wrong."
heraldry,2x15dh,cfvh,1 point,Wed Feb 25 16:50:17 2015 UTC,The metal color (gold or silver) is usually on the inside of the mantling (cape that protects the helm from heat) and the primary color (red or gules in this case) is on the outside.
heraldry,2x15dh,1magecrafting,1 point,Wed Feb 25 17:02:58 2015 UTC,"Interesting. So for the ""hair"" (mantling), I most likely need to reverse mine to match /u/12kohl's, as well as swap colors for each wing to match /u/bubblehoney's."
heraldry,2x15dh,cfvh,1 point,Wed Feb 25 18:06:02 2015 UTC,12kohl's second attempt is correct on both counts. Primary color (red) on the wings is on the Outside and the dexter side on the crest and his mantling is also correct with the gold on the inside. Try to picture the wings being folded up on a bird (instead of displayed) and the red would be all that showed until it took flight and then the underside would be gold.
heraldry,2x15dh,1magecrafting,2,Wed Feb 25 18:33:12 2015 UTC,"Excuse me when I keep poking. I just fail to see your reasoning and I'm here to learn, so I have to ask.  Does ""dexter"" gain a special meaning when it's related to closed wings; like ""outside""? I know it doesn't and wouldn't make sense when we're describing a pair of open wings. And I've never heard of anything like it for closed wings until now.   Or, and it's in no way meant to be offensive, did you just ignore what the German text said (Flug/wing/vol rechts/right/dexter golden/or) in favor of the more common tincture?  I know I shouldn't have painted over the mantling in my sketch and don't know why I did.  Again: not trying to be a dick here, I'm just stupid."

Ah, now I'm starting to understand how the wording is being used. If wulst is the torse, bewulsteten must be a German grammatical use of the noun as an adjective; in English it might be ""betorsed"", for torse-laden, in this case a torse-laden helmet, and the torse is red and gold."

Photoshop is a pixel pushing program. Illustrator (and several other programs) create vector graphics. Vector graphics allow you to scale from business card to billboard size because they are math, not pixels. The text is simply the blazon in German and quite simple to translate. Also those arms are not yours even though they may have belonged to someone in you family's history.

heraldry,2wrpj5,cfvh,3,Sun Feb 22 16:19:40 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea but the issue is that arms tend to be granted once a prince attains age of majority, whereas a dukedom tends to be granted at marriage. I wonder, why do York and Edinburgh show an escutcheon all over and the others have the ""ducal"" arms in the fourth quarter?  Personally, I wish both would be granted earlier. As for differencing the royal arms, I think bordures would be interesting, with labels used for the direct heirs."
heraldry,2wrpj5,DreadLindwyrm,1 point,Sun Feb 22 20:18:38 2015 UTC,"A problem here:  The escutcheon over the arms has a normal interpretation as Arms of Pretence, where a husband will bear the arms of his wife's father on top of his own if the father in law has no male heir, to indicate that he ""pretends"" to the position of head of her family.   It is also possible that it might be granted as an enhancement to the arms, but then it tends to be smaller, or obviously not a set of pretence arms.  A canton of the duchy arms could have value here, but at least in theory the duke has personal arms (differenced versions of the royal arms) and arms of office (the actually duchy arms themselves).  For example, Prince Charles, as Duke of Cornwall uses the arms of the Duchy (sable, 15 bezants or), but as himself uses either the Prince of Wales' arms, or simply the royal arms differenced with a label as heir."

heraldry,2wl33g,ng556,3,Fri Feb 20 20:39:48 2015 UTC,"The Problem with using these arms is that they belong to, and is used by the Duke of Anjou, the Legitimist pretender to the French Crown."
heraldry,2wl33g,cfvh,4,Sat Feb 21 01:25:24 2015 UTC,"They don't really belong to him. Arms of dominion such as these aren't like ordinary arms: they pass based on ownership rather than being passed down hereditarily; hence why British princes and princesses have to be granted differenced versions of the royal arms, rather than automatically inheriting them. The current Republican government currently rule France; thus they have the right to use the arms."
heraldry,2wl33g,ZeroJanvier,1 point,Sat Feb 21 01:33:37 2015 UTC,"The republican government has never borne these arms and does not maintain them in any way whatsoever. Therefore they do not have an inherent ""right"" to these arms. They could easily usurp them and force their usage over time but they definitely won't.  It's silly to apply monarchical arms to France considering they never could agree on which dynasty should rule them. France is a republic because it is the form of government which divides them the least.  Royal arms were not used in the exact same way in France as they are in the United Kingdom. Since French succession rights are inalienable and the Duke of Anjou is the senior male line descendant of Louis XIV, the arms are his."
heraldry,2wl33g,startwearinggreen,2,Sat Feb 21 14:18:33 2015 UTC,"Pretty nice! I really hope for the French Republic to reclaim the fleur-de-lys, our national symbol by right. If all those other European Republics can use their old royal arms, so can we.  Here are some things that should be fixed though:   There's a typo on ""Fraternité"" The Phrygian cap on top of Roman fasces is a good symbol but it looks awful, which is precisely why it isn't depicted on the current emblem. The fasces are enough. The sides look empty without supports. It would be good to re-include the laurel and oak branches that are in the current emblem and have always surrounded the fasces in previous republican emblems."

So for the sake of argument it should be treated as separate.  The question is: should NI be given precedence over Wales? I do not believe so. Wales has belonged in the union longer Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland was the last territory to join the union.
