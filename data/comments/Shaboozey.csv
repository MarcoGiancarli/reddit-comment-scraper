Shaboozey,3dzsay,bloodstainer,11,Mon Jul 20 22:50:33 2015 UTC,I think you've got it wrong. Shaboozey was the catchphrase he came up with for a character he made in a DC Universe online video. He liked it so much he started using it for other things. He bought shaboozey.com and that became the name of the minecraft group for his rpgmakers series.  Just to note I don't recall of the shaboozey video ever got uploaded to his website. It may have been part of a livestream. The character was a mummy with an afro.

Russel's jokes are entirely without malice, and the fact he has so many fans from all cultures speaks to how his humor is broadly accepted.  He saves most of his ""mocking"" for his own race, and Indians love him.  Racial humor isn't racist.  John Pinette did some racial jokes, but again, it was not for the purposes of insulting or mocking, just funny observational humor.  And no comedian had less malice in his heart than John Pinette."

Shaboozey,3db1k5,Gearsofhalowarfare,5,Tue Jul 14 21:55:14 2015 UTC,"Crendor and Jesse started a podcast Cox n Crendor in the Morning.  They originally got the idea for it during...man, something...a podcast?  For it being a funny wacky morning ""drive FM"" style talk show.  They eventually funded it through Patreon, though they never came close to hitting any of the stated content goals.  People got angrier and angrier about it, most saying ""make it per episode"" and when they did, they bitched because they felt this was going to be exploited by them to get more money. Jesse has been involved on the ground floor with Blizzard's MOBA Heroes of the Storm, and loves the game - despite his loathing of other MOBAS, maybe because it's so unlike them - so much so he's funded a HotS e-sports team Stellar Lotus.  His collection of streamers Team Low Expectations won the inaugural Blizzcon HOTS event and then won their first challenge after. He eventually moved into an office space where Jirard and his crew and Dodger have set up.  Both he and Dodger are trying to better separate work and home, and they both claim to be more productive in their office space, and more relaxed and at ease in their home time. Beyond that, he had a ""year of a million subs"" promotion to attempt to push his channel past the 1,000,000 mark. This was mostly a push by himself to a) better his content, and b) focus on his fans are really make people want to sub in if they haven't already.  He didn't hit the goal, but he's not too upset. He's started up a Cox-Con in Britain that came out of his committing to another con which then collapsed. He was looking forward to it - had a great time the year previous - and decided to start his own con, which was really just a ""meet Jesse at a bar and we'll shoot the shit and take silly pictures"".  This year he's making it a full blown con, and TB and Genna, Crendor and Sam and Dooger are all coming - I think some of the RPG Makers will be there too (surprised if Lewis isn't there at least)."
Shaboozey,3db1k5,hackmastergeneral,3,Tue Jul 14 22:21:10 2015 UTC,"I also have a feeling he and Dodger being in the same space as Jirard's crew will lead to more collab content and just general increased interactions.  I hope so.  They need to get Multiplayer Mayhem back on the go.  They tease a Scary Game Squad renewal - I can't imagine it without Greg, but he's said it will.  I hope they bring Dodger in to replace Greg. That would make it absolutely FUNDERFUL. Oh, Scary Game Squad was something Jesse, Jirard, GregWilmot and Davis of The Warp Zone did one night, getting drunk and playing P.T. It was so popular they then made a complete playthru of Fatal Frame which, if you weren't here for it, is hysterical as they get drunker on Evan Williams and more scared. Davis being scared shitless is hilarious, as he keeps grabbing Greg."

They initially didn't disclose that these were paid for by the devs, and later made sure they did.  This really only affected guys like TB and Angry Joe who are reviewers/critics, the rest like Yogs, Dooger, Jesse, Crendor, Markiplier etc are LPers so it's less of a ""conflict of interest"" thing for them and more a ""just be open"".  However, TB was clear that his reviews of both were done long before any paid deals were floated his way, and his participation was entirely down to how much he enjoyed the games.  I doubt Mojang could throw enough money at him to convince him to do some Minecraft paid content."

Shaboozey,3br2ld,rolls20s,5,Wed Jul 1 16:09:27 2015 UTC,Same here. The start of the terraria series is what introduced me. TB's Magicka series also introduced me to the Yogscast.

Shaboozey,3br2ld,randomdrifter54,6,Wed Jul 1 14:14:16 2015 UTC,Same for me too! Back when I used to watch Yogscast I was a little younger but I also feel that they lost a lot of the appeal that they had back then.  But at least they introduced me to TB :)

Shaboozey,3boaj3,arcpollux,2,Tue Jun 30 20:34:30 2015 UTC,"My personal theory:  The Watcher is a an insane man who thinks the house is alive because of a former tragedy. The Watcher, in his various letters sometimes personifies the house, saying things like ""It cries out in pain"" because the new people renovated it. Maybe he suffered some sort of horrible incident, like part of the house collapsed and hurt him, or killed a family pet or injured a sibling. That was the ""First Coming."" The ""Living"" house lashing out at its occupants. Now the Watcher watches the house waiting for the Second Coming, another accident, perhaps caused by the Watcher himself. That could also be a clue about ""Young Blood."" maybe The Watcher saw a child get hurt, and it traumatized him.  Obviously, this is all pure speculation, but if I've learned anything from Jesse it's figuring out the little holes in stories, and fitting a plot together from clues."

We tried to hit the episode amount monthly, but with Jesse traveling a lot in addition to both of our work schedules, it didn't happen as much as we had hoped. With this change, we'll be able to only charge you when an episode is created. We probably should've done this format from the start, and apologize that we didn't put out as many episodes as we had planned, but tried to make up for it by making these episodes twice as long as older ones. In addition, we've lowered the $5 to $4 and $20 to $10 so that it's easier to give per episode. Thank you for your continued support and patience as we figure out what the best and fairest way to get the podcasts out is.    eh, hmm   it didn't happen as much as we had hoped.   understatement of the century, it didn't happen ever, hit 8 once, mostly 2 to 4. nowhere near 10-15   making these episodes twice as long as older ones   we'll see, but I liked that they were shorter... hmm"

As for another two dudes talking podcast, I would say Hello Internet is pretty good. It's CGP Grey and Brady Haran(numberphile) who are two educational youtubers talking about first world youtuber problems and cool science things. They also have some animated shorts made from the podcast on the Hello Internet YouTube channel.  If you like people bullshitting about news stories then the Bugle is pretty good. Jon Oliver and Andy Zaltzman. They don't age great, since they are based on topical news stories, although they're still pretty good. If you don't like puns this is not for you, Andy Zaltzman is infamous for his pun runs which are pretty awful."

Two of the hosts have been there since the start, and 2 others have since been replaced by one of their most popular guests. Pretty laid back, small amounts of gaming talk (not much other than civ these days, but they all started as gaming youtubers), mostly current events, and they joke around a lot.  It's usually around 3-4 hours long though (one episode per week), rather than 30 minutes. They do also have a weekly 1 hour version as well called PKN, which usually has two of the 3 hosts. I heard the newest episode has some audio issues with the guest but otherwise they are usually good on the tech side.  I think it's on iTunes, podbean, and the video version is on YouTube."

Shaboozey,3afl4p,icefall5,99,Fri Jun 19 18:59:16 2015 UTC,"In the last 6 months, there were roughly 22 podcasts released.  For $500 on Patreon a month, they suggested they'd do 10 a month. They missed their mark by 38 podcasts and got 7x the money they requested for that goal.  I'm not going to suggest this is some kind of scheme or conspiracy or any of that trash - they're genuine people who hugely over-estimated either a) how many people would contribute or b) what they could achieve.  The problem is, they haven't tried to rectify it within the 9 months since the Patreon started. I wish I could justify giving them $3 on a per-podcast basis,  but I can't get over the fact that they accepted the income for 9 months before discussing the fix.  If they want to build back audience trust, they need to take down the Patreon entirely for a period and prove that they're going to deliver the content the audience pays for.  For now, I'm out."
Shaboozey,3afl4p,KingStrangelove,13,Fri Jun 19 19:28:35 2015 UTC,"Same, I reduced my pledge from 5-1 probably gonna drop it after this month. It's pretty inexcusable."
Shaboozey,3afl4p,cpudude30k,16,Sat Jun 20 02:18:04 2015 UTC,"It's worse than that. Their goal was 15 before they added   We try to for a minimum of 10 podcasts per month, but hope to produce more.   to the Patreon page in December of '14.  In LA time, podcasts were released as such   2014  August: 1 (possible target of 15-20)  September: 6 (target set at 15 (mentioned in one of the first few podcasts))  October: 8   November: 6   December: 5 (changed target to 10 (put in Patreon description))  2015  January: 4  February: 3  March: 3  April: 3  May: 2  June: 1 (so far)    The excuses have been illness, or traveling, or ""con season"". But the excuses have gone on for almost a year now, and they keep taking the money every month anyway.  When they take a company's money for a promo, they at least have to do the minimum to fulfill their contract. It makes it look like the value that money over money given to them directly by their fans. With the per month setup on Patreon, there is zero accountability. It's like they are selling hype and hope to fans for next month, every month.  The Patreon must say this for a reason   We Don't Even Try   And if this reads as such, yes, I am quite salty about this."

This doesn't concern me personally since I'm not a patron, but I think this has reached a level where some people might want to get refunds. From what I hear these crowdfunding sites don't tend to have those sorts of systems though.  Looking at those numbers, they were over the half way point to the target once. Its reasonable to assume that every now and then they would miss few episodes, but they didn't reach the half way point most of the time.  This change should have been done a long time ago or they should have lowballed it from the beginning. Target of four episodes a month or something."

Shaboozey,3afl4p,TweetPoster,14,Fri Jun 19 19:00:43 2015 UTC,"Personally I find it weird that no one here realises that they actually care a whole lot more about the money than many of you want to admit... I'm not sure if it's because you're fans or simply too naive.   Crendor's mentality basically boils down to ""I don't really have a passion for what I do and how I do it as long as I make money"". And Jesse has never beaten around the bush that he's more than willing to sell out for tons of things. He's far from an objective and fair person (which he never claims to be nor has to be), and he always plays the ""funny act"" around getting stuff and money to make it look ironic, while it's pretty obvious that integrity isn't high on his list.   Nothing about their behavior in regards to this surprises me. It surprises me that most of you are still trying to damage control it, despite being disappointed."
Shaboozey,3afl4p,DoubleDot,3,Sat Jun 20 13:17:32 2015 UTC,"Crendor's mentality basically boils down to ""I don't really have a passion for what I do and how I do it as long as I make money""   not sure what to think about that. I don't think that's true. He has passion for it , although his personality might suggest otherwise."
Shaboozey,3afl4p,gryfincol,7,Sat Jun 20 14:30:28 2015 UTC,"He's in the money making business and he does so by making videos of things he likes or loves.  Which is different than him loving the fact that he makes videos about the things he loves.  There's a small but important difference between the two. Everything he says in any podcast, group conversation, or general opinion-related videos come across as him having the mentality of getting a larger audience and making more money first, enjoying what he does second.  Compare that with for example TB who clearly has a passion for his work, along with obviously handling it as a business.  I'm not saying that I dislike Crendor (or Jesse) nor their content. I'm just saying that they're not as integral as I'd expect a respected YouTuber to be.   The fact that after months of simply hussling their donaters they're only addressing the situation after much criticism (in a very poor and unsatisfactory manner might I add), says enough about their mentality."
Shaboozey,3afl4p,DoubleDot,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:00:50 2015 UTC,"I think they just like to joke around about that stuff rather than actually just caring about the money. They're both good people, they just tend to be lazy sometimes."
Shaboozey,3afl4p,tonybateman,3,Sat Jun 20 17:23:15 2015 UTC,"I think you're mistaken about the money part.   Yes, they're good people. I'm not saying they're out to scam people. I'm saying they're not responsible when it comes to at all times trying to be integral and respectable towards your viewerbase."
Shaboozey,3afl4p,DoubleDot,5,Sat Jun 20 17:27:51 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I think this has mostly been on Jesse rather than Crendor though.
Shaboozey,3afl4p,tonybateman,-4,Sat Jun 20 17:50:32 2015 UTC,"I think you are blatantly fucking wrong.  Also I have no idea what you are trying to say with the use of the word ""integer"".  Crendor gives of the ""I don't care"" vibe, but the content he makes takes a lot of time to set up and edit.  He puts a LOT into it behind the scenes.  Yes, he's in it to make money - obviously - but comparing him to TB is not fair.  TB is aiming a lot higher than Crendor.   As far as Jesse, I have to say you must never watch any of his stuff.  If you ever watched any of his Q and As or his Vlog material, it is obvious Jesse cares deeply about his fanbase and respects them a great deal.  His twitch channel was for the longest time (and I think still is) a one-time donation rather than a subscription.  Both are normal people who wound up doing a thing that makes them a lot of money, and they are bad at managing their time.  Dodger is the same way - has a hard time sticking to a schedule for content."
Shaboozey,3afl4p,hackmastergeneral,8,Sun Jun 21 04:30:29 2015 UTC,This would be for the best considering how few episodes they actually make.  Biggest issue with this is people who pledge high expecting a few episodes can get screwed if they actually make 10 episodes in one month.

Shaboozey,3afl4p,arcpollux,10,Fri Jun 19 20:55:15 2015 UTC,"I like to believe so myself, but they introduced the Patreon 6 months ago(?) so the ""mistake"" have been happening for all this time and yet nothing has been done. That's a lot more than general laziness."

While the per-episode plan sounds interesting, I feel like it only really functions to quell everyone saying BLOOBLAA YOU TOOK OUR MONEY, rather than fixing the actual problem (more episodes).   But I agree with you when I say I don't feel cheated. They aren't rich oil barons, its more like they're the friend who's a little irresponsible and forgets things. But I still want them to improve"
Shaboozey,3afl4p,splshcl,3,Sat Jun 20 01:13:46 2015 UTC,"I'm confused by how this is worded.  Are they saying they're going to accept donations when episodes come out and not monthly?  That's actually a really good idea... unless they've got a crazy game plan to ramp up production on the podcast.  I doubt that's the case though.  I don't really care that much about the decision.  I'm a huge fan, don't get me wrong, but Jesse and Crendor are not known for keeping promises which is part of the reason I've yet to donate.  I love the guys to death, I never use adblock on their channels and all of that, but if they keep screwing with their Patreon thing, I have a feeling they'll just end up making a bunch of people upset."
Shaboozey,3afl4p,omnialcatraz,7,Fri Jun 19 21:04:15 2015 UTC,"Patreon is built as a ""donation"" platform for content creators. It has a few different donation methods, the one that they currently use being the monthly donation one. The other commonly-used one is that they tell the site every time they've published a new podcast, and the site keeps track of that and then collects donations from people based on the number of creations as opposed to the amount of time that has passed. (I think they still do monthly billing just to keep things simpler/cheaper for the site, but the bill is based on the number of ""creations"" the person/group put out during that month.)"
Shaboozey,3afl4p,omnialcatraz,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:20:41 2015 UTC,"Ah!  Thanks for clearing that up.  I always thought Patreon was in the family of sites like Kickstarter until I learned it was all for donations, but I never new how it worked."
Shaboozey,3afl4p,Hirork,3,Fri Jun 19 22:34:24 2015 UTC,Frankly I'm glad I never put into the pot cos I never believed they could deliver what they were promising.  If they change it to a per episode basis I might consider weighing in.  I kind of feel bad for those of you who feel ripped off but at the same time if you've felt ripped off yet still kept contributing for months on end it's kind of your own fault at that point.
Shaboozey,3afl4p,BlueSapphyre,2,Sat Jun 20 22:50:50 2015 UTC,"at the same time if you've felt ripped off yet still kept contributing for months on end it's kind of your own fault at that point.   Totally agree. But be careful, you'll get called out of victim blaming if you try to point this out."

Shaboozey,3afl4p,BlueSapphyre,4,Fri Jun 19 22:17:29 2015 UTC,"Hm. I'll probably pull my pledge then. $1/month was reasonable no matter the amount of content, but $5-10/month is outside what I'm willing to pay."

Shaboozey,39ug74,munsosl8,6,Sun Jun 14 23:49:33 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with this.  The power is in our hands to just unsub if we aren't satisfied with the amount of content or lack thereof they are pumping out.  Do they need money from us to produce the show? No.  It's just to show our support for their work.  It's not like it's someone who just quit their job to focus on youtube, and needs some help starting out so they can upgrade their equipment.  When Jesse streams he always downplays the donations.  He doesn't need them. They both don't.  So if you don't think they are working hard enough, don't show your support. They'll get the message."

When he's on trips he still does the podcast most of the time, and even the lounge. CnC is a lot shorter than both of those so I don't really feel like he has an excuse.

Shaboozey,39ug74,tonybateman,23,Tue Jun 16 18:54:17 2015 UTC,I feel like he certainly doesn't owe me anything I really enjoy his content that I can watch for free with some minor ads. Though he does owe his patrons.
Shaboozey,39ug74,Shiftemonk,5,Sun Jun 14 23:07:58 2015 UTC,"is it harder to do? yes, it is. many times over. jesse has literally nothing at all to do with the production of the podcast, or the lounge.   he doesn't record. he doesn't edit. he doesn't process it. he doesn't upload it. he just shows up for a couple hours then leaves. hell, he doesn't even make topics, he just reacts to things.  C&C he has to do all of those things. not trying to make excuses for him, but you saying it isn't hard work is a bit ignorant"
Shaboozey,39ug74,juggalonumber27,4,Mon Jun 15 07:20:59 2015 UTC,How is it harder than the content he normally does? What's the difference between doing a let's play episode of 30 min playing W3 and recording a C&C episode?
Shaboozey,39ug74,Diggasson,0,Mon Jun 15 07:34:31 2015 UTC,"Well he can play for a couple of hours, edit it into 3 or 4 parts and that's that for some playthrough episodes. C&C takes coordination with Crendor. Cooperative material always takes a bit extra work, and sometimes, as Jesse has said before, the C&C episodes just aren't interesting and gets deleted forever.  And lastly, from what I can hear, Crendor also records on his computer, because the sound quality is better than what is possible from a VoIP program.  This still doesn't justify him not living up to the expectations he set himself in regards to Patreon, but honestly, it not something done in just an hour."
Shaboozey,39ug74,JakeRay,2,Mon Jun 15 17:22:38 2015 UTC,"I really don't see how it would be that hard or time-consuming to do. The coordination thing one assumes they'd have down at this point after 100+ episodes and years of co-operation.   That Crendor was recording his part on his own computer was a given, there's little chance of getting that quality otherwise.   The editing of the sound-clips themselves can mostly be automated via for example a chain in audacity/audition that removes background noise, adds whatever effects they use. The transfer of the file itself from Crendor to Jesse shouldn't take long either. Of course if they do it in raw wav format then it might take a bit.   The syncing of the two clips should take less than a minute, add the intro and outro, export audio and upload audio then done. If an episode is 30 minutes long then if they're on top of things it should be done completely in an hour from beginning of recording to uploading.   Of course I know very little of how they produce it all, just going on personal experience in such matters."
Shaboozey,39ug74,Skjuludde,-1,Mon Jun 15 22:52:12 2015 UTC,"Of course. It really isn't difficult.  But you only include the technical aspect of the product.  Sometimes, the material just isn't funny. Which Jesse has said before, there are LOTS of hours of podcasts that will never see the light of day, because they're bad.  Creating a Let's Play is pretty much just reacting vocally while playing a game. It's easy, the game gives you all the material (of course, Jesse is excellent at reacting, and it's not effortless - I couldn't do it better).  But with Cox&Crendor, they pretty much has to make shit up all the time, and we all know Crendor lives a boring life (Jesse's words, haha!).  It's hard making shit up out of thin air, and if they don't do that, the show would just be about traffic, weather, sports and the news story of the day. It could still be good, and I would still enjoy it, but I think they would lose some of their mojo if they dumbed it down.  So give them a little more credit. The format is not optimal and could use some spice, but that takes work. Let's Plays gives Jesse the material, and editing is easy enough from there - but with the podcast, they need to find the material, and the material might not be good."
Shaboozey,39ug74,JakeRay,2,Mon Jun 15 23:54:38 2015 UTC,"Most of the times I remember them mentioning podcasts that don't see the light of day, it's the ones that encounter technical problems such as getting corrupted or lost somehow.   It's hard for some, not for others. Jesse does it for a living and also CnC is essentially him having a conversation with his long-time friend. I'm not trying to diminish their work, but they're not painting the Mona-Lisa.   I've given them plenty of credit. I listen to their podcast every single day, I have their shirt and I have donated to their patreon since it started up until a bit over a week ago. But let's be honest. The show is basically two very good friends talking about whatever the hell they feel like talking about, and that's how it should be."
Shaboozey,39ug74,Skjuludde,-3,Tue Jun 16 00:11:11 2015 UTC,"You might be right, it's not very hard.  Still, I'd rather want a healthy Jesse who gets his sleep, than the opposite. He might start prioritising CnC as soon as his schedule and health allows it.  edit/ Well waddayouknow, they did a new kind of CnC on youtube this time."
Shaboozey,39ug74,JakeRay,3,Tue Jun 16 00:22:32 2015 UTC,"Of course but I'd also rather want a healthy Jesse who gets his sleep and who upholds his patreon goal. The thing is, after ten months of not once meeting the set out goal I wouldn't hold my breath about CnC getting prioritized. The past five months have been 3 episodes a month on average. It's too many months of taking money and delivering a third in return."
Shaboozey,39ug74,Skjuludde,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:38:29 2015 UTC,I've heard Crendor a few times offer to do the editing for Jesse but I'm guessing that hasn't happened for whatever reason.
Shaboozey,39ug74,tonybateman,3,Tue Jun 16 23:52:30 2015 UTC,"No anger or finger pointing or anything, but I was thinking about sub-ing to the Cox and Crendor patreon and I'm glad I haven't yet.  I acknowledge that the guys have a lot going on and that's fine. I'm just glad I'm not paying money for content that's not being received."
Shaboozey,39ug74,musicchan,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:30:33 2015 UTC,"This is a difficult subject because it there is no real understand of what Jesse Cox's working days are like. We can claim to know how difficult it is to edit videos and how much time it takes to create a C&C episode, but none of us really know.  However, what is important to remember is that Patreon is essentially a wage payer. It's a tool for people to get paid. It isn't a one-time donation, but a monthly payout and when content is fluctuating between a few episodes to nothing at all, there is a problem.  What needs to happen is for an honest re-evaluation of C&C, whether it is realistic to put them out frequently or something that will remain sparse for the next few months until either Jesse or Crendor chooses to discuss it.  There are people willing, myself included, to continue supporting C&C on patreon, even if it means receiving only 1 episode a week. But there needs to be clear what patreon supporters are getting for their money.  I don't want Jesse and Crendor to suddenly feel like slaves to the patreon promise, to force themselves in to recording, even when they don't want to. But what I do want is for them to be realistic about what they can deliver, because right now they are being paid a wage for delivering on almost no content. There needs to be an open and honest discussion about what they can realistically deliver, if they can even continue to do the patreon model at all and allow people to re-evaluate their pledges and adjust them to what they feel is fair, rather than continuing to pledge their money, unsure whether they'll even get anything for it.  This isn't like Youtube videos. I wouldn't complain about Jesse missing a day on youtube, not streaming as much or not being on the co-optional podcast. This is all free entertainment and the support he receives is completely passive from ad revenue. I'd have no right to complain and would never think of it. However patreon is direct money and people are giving out their money, not knowing whether they just threw money away that month."
Shaboozey,39ug74,Dimnos,5,Tue Jun 16 22:50:10 2015 UTC,"You're right, it's impossible for us to really know exactly what goes into it. However, we can make somewhat educated guesses on the matter. What makes CnC or Jesse's videos appealing is all about the personalities making them and their chemistry and very little to do with any technical stuff. As such if you and I were to make a podcast episode of 30 minutes, the process shouldn't be all too different from theirs.   Either way it's such an easy thing to fix it. Reset the patreon, make an announcement that it's switching to paying out per episode and done. Anything other than that or meeting their set out goal is unethical at this point."

It's understandable that people get frustrated when a video they're waiting for doesn't happen but c'est la vie, it happens.   Jesse isn't obligated and doesn't owe us anything, plus I highly doubt he's doing it to be spiteful.   We don't know everything that's going on in a YouTuber's life and why should we? Everyone is entitled to a little privacy. I don't know about you but quite a lot of times when I make plans they fall through, whether it's my fault or not, it just happens because that's life.

Shaboozey,39ug74,Diggasson,19,Mon Jun 15 07:35:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with the sentiment overall and with the channel then yes, he's not obligated and doesn't owe us anything. But with the podcast he does as long as it's set to pay out monthly and as long as the goal is minimum 10 episodes.   I've been tweeting him once a day for the past week about how he should change the patreon to pay out per episode, but I've gotten no response. It's such a simple thing to do. Change it to pay out per episode, announce the change and done. He can return to making podcast episodes whenever he want.   As long as he and Crendor takes money and saying they will do something in return for this money then proceeds to never once fulfilling that, that's when I have a problem."

As for asking Blondie to ask Jesse about that, I clarified in a response post that I at least would like him to send these threads to Jesse because Jesse doesn't read a lot of fan comments and has rarely ever acknowledge this subreddit at all, so he wouldn't necessarily see the actual issues people have written about on here and only just the short ""complaints"" that people send him on Twitter."

But the Patreon page is still getting money monthly from people who were not getting the content quota they were promised for a long time.

If we go back in time, to when the podcast started, they put out over  30 podcasts in their first two months - more than was originally promised by the Patreon page - and that was before they were even getting paid!  It just makes me mad seeing them essentially do nothing with all the Patreon money when there are people like Wildbow (a writer of web serials) who makes the majority of his income from his $2000 Patreon, while working full time on his writing."
Shaboozey,39io2m,qodz,13,Fri Jun 12 23:04:36 2015 UTC,"As I tend to normally do, yesterday I was listening through various episodes from the Co-Optional Podcast and the TGS Podcast. I stumbled upon episode 62 of the TGS Podcast featuring The Completionist aka Jirard.   In it they were talking about kickstarters. During it Jesse mentioned the need for transparency and that the way the Skullgirls handled their kickstarted was good because at least then people know that they aren't bsing them.   Later on they came back to the subject and the need for transparency and openness.   Jesse: ""Oh seriously. If I ever did a kickstarter I'd make a youtube channel that was like ""This is what happens on a daily basis. I'm going to do a vlog daily: Like today we did this and tomorrow we're going to do this"". Like that's the kind of stuff that I would just so everyone knows and is constantly updated. Because it kills me spending money on people and then you don't hear from them for months. Like ""What are you doing right now? Where did my money go?"".   Obviously kickstarter isn't exactly the same as patreon but the general thread weaves through it. Sure you can get updates on his life through following his Twitter, but that's not really in relation to the patreon and the podcast. You can find out that he's going to a convention, but there's no way you'll know how that should affect the podcast."

Shaboozey,39bqop,DaveyDDial,3,Fri Jun 12 01:41:55 2015 UTC,This was the single reason i ever subbed to that bloody channel. It appalls me that their communication can be that bad with their viewer base. The least they could do would be release what they had...
Shaboozey,39bqop,Zyvaron,15,Mon Jun 22 15:09:37 2015 UTC,But didn't they already film some episodes? Are they ever going to be available?
Shaboozey,39bqop,Laamakala,8,Wed Jun 10 19:33:59 2015 UTC,They had bits of interviews in the announcement trailer.  Kinda disrespectful to the people that were interviewed tbh.
Shaboozey,39bqop,Gundato,10,Wed Jun 10 23:11:39 2015 UTC,"How so?  There is a big difference between having something filmed and having an episode (editing/cutting stuff together to flow more gooderer), and if the people who were passionate/cared about it are gone, it makes no sense to just dump a bunch of crap.  Also: Crap gets cancelled all the time, and lots of interviews get left on the cutting room floor because they just don't fit the narrative of the show/network/whatever.  I get that you are annoyed it is cancelled (I am too as I liked the premise and I like the Cox), but The Internet's tendency to call everything ""disrespectful"" mostly just betrays a lack of understanding of how things work."
Shaboozey,39bqop,Sl33prkeepr,9,Thu Jun 11 03:51:03 2015 UTC,Didn't Jesse also call this on the podcast way back when G&S first started shooting the show. I can't remember which exact podcast number it was but sad to hear anyways.
Shaboozey,39bqop,Quindo,12,Wed Jun 10 18:57:58 2015 UTC,is it just me or does jesse seem to have bad luck with being on shows that get canceled after the first episode and/or require replacement hosts?
Shaboozey,39bqop,Painismymistress,6,Wed Jun 10 20:51:26 2015 UTC,Noo... And now i´m sad :(
Shaboozey,39bqop,tonybateman,4,Wed Jun 10 18:55:23 2015 UTC,"Perhaps now we'll get a few more CnC episodes per month. Maybe that's wishful thinking, but I'm not sure what else he would be busy with besides his own channel stuff. Here's hoping anyway."
Shaboozey,39bqop,magmafrost,0,Thu Jun 11 06:03:36 2015 UTC,He's been busy with travelling and being sick. Far more than any normal person.
Shaboozey,39bqop,TheRealJulien,2,Tue Jun 16 04:46:16 2015 UTC,"Well, that's a disappointment. Jesse, I hope you get another shot at doing this sometime and maybe editing what has already been filmed into a proof of concept. I really would have loved to see this.  Between TableTop and Learning Curve, I think I would have even put up with all the Felicia Day content and subscribed to Geek & Sundry, but as it stands, I think I'll stick to my guns."
Shaboozey,39bqop,rahrahsan,3,Fri Jun 12 17:16:22 2015 UTC,"To be honest I am kind of surprised Geek and Sundry is still around, it looks like Tabletop is the the main draw of the channel."
Shaboozey,39bqop,BlueSapphyre,3,Thu Jun 11 18:41:20 2015 UTC,"Co-optitude and LARPs also do really well in view numbers, not nearly as much as Tabletop. And Spellslingers is also great."
Shaboozey,39bqop,Gundato,2,Fri Jun 12 14:05:59 2015 UTC,"They also fairly recently branched out into twitch and, at the very least, are one of the few combinations of ""good sized community"" and ""not ridiculously toxic and meme'y""."
Shaboozey,39bqop,rahrahsan,3,Sat Jun 13 17:30:01 2015 UTC,Is that possible on Twitch?
Shaboozey,39bqop,Gundato,2,Mon Jun 15 00:46:35 2015 UTC,"I was as surprised as you. During their inaugural charity stream they had pretty big exposure, fairly large numbers, and a more or less decent chat. And that was with quite a few very attractive women rotating through the hosting duty.  The secret is basically they have a pretty strong mod team and pay attention. A lot of the popular streamers embrace the twitch chat mentality for donations, whereas G&S know that their target demographic isn't the core twitch demographic, so they can afford to piss off the people spamming ""kappa"" if it means that the people who WILL give them money stick around."
Shaboozey,39bqop,magmafrost,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:48:48 2015 UTC,"And then LARPs finished. I'm only subbed to wait for S2, or in case anything I'm interested in shows up on Tabletop (like Dread. That was great)"

Shaboozey,39bzlx,Feuer-Kampfer,11,Wed Jun 10 19:08:02 2015 UTC,"Good job Jesse, you were more positive in one episode than Ross was in 3."
Shaboozey,39bzlx,ThereGoesMySanity,2,Wed Jun 10 22:37:23 2015 UTC,"Jesse's job was to be The Bundle of Fun Who Saves The Day. Ross's was to be the warden who is locked in there with them. Argue the premise is flawed (a lot of the folk in the gamegrumps subreddit are, and I am inclined to agree), but they ""played"" very different characters in the show."
Shaboozey,39bzlx,Gundato,9,Fri Jun 12 00:11:39 2015 UTC,Jesse finally visits the grumps. So much yes.
Shaboozey,39bzlx,NitroBA,5,Wed Jun 10 21:56:26 2015 UTC,"I fangirled so hard when I was watching this. I saw the vid before this post so I was like ""Who's it gonna be? Holly? Markiplier?""  And then Jesse came on and I unorinically squealed. I regret nothing"

Shaboozey,38obk7,PodcastInvestigator1,62,Fri Jun 5 14:47:27 2015 UTC,I don't think anyone can disagree with you. 2-3 episodes in a month is inexcusable.
Shaboozey,38obk7,elfranco001,50,Fri Jun 5 15:03:38 2015 UTC,Im OK with Jesse doing what he wants with his channel and content up until the point he takes money from his viewers and doesn't deliver on his promises. I can also excuse someone missing the target every now and again because of other projects / events etc - but 10 months in a row? Thats just not on.
Shaboozey,38obk7,Zimzams123,33,Fri Jun 5 15:34:29 2015 UTC,I would say 15 eps was a little unrealistic on their part.  However 2-3 is a little low.  1 a week is probably the right pace.
Shaboozey,38obk7,asianwaste,15,Fri Jun 5 16:00:51 2015 UTC,"i was so excited when they announced the patreon and saw that it actually made the goals but this is just sad. ive pulled back from funding it after seeing it has become this. i dont like jesses attitude when he talks about this and how he just laughs it off. 3500$ is too much just to laugh that he doesnt have time, 10 months in a row"
Shaboozey,38obk7,Axenor,4,Fri Jun 5 19:47:12 2015 UTC,Can I see a source of him joking about it?
Shaboozey,38obk7,Scott1044,24,Sat Jun 6 10:40:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not a big fan of anyone taking that much money and not producing the promised product.   I often feel this way with crowdfunded projects, be it kickstarted or patreoned. The concept of crowdfunding is great, but I am afraid more and more people are getting disillusioned, when they notice content producers are not delivering promised products. If this trend continues, crowd funding will go the way of the Dodo."
Shaboozey,38obk7,ChekhovsRPG,19,Fri Jun 5 15:22:15 2015 UTC,"You can set Patreon to payout only per-deliverable (so in this case, per-episode) rather than monthly. I think that works better, because the creator doesn't get paid unless they actually produce content. Now, of course the quality of the content could still be a variable, but it's a step in the right direction."
Shaboozey,38obk7,rolls20s,5,Fri Jun 5 17:45:03 2015 UTC,Hypothetical Help is doing the per episode thing. I like that more than the set amount per month.
Shaboozey,38obk7,MrDTD,2,Sat Jun 6 02:58:00 2015 UTC,Same as co optional animated.. That has only put on 3 videos this year.
Shaboozey,38obk7,mattiejj,2,Sat Jun 6 09:15:35 2015 UTC,"I like this model better aswell, but if you look at FilmCow, the maker of Llamas with hats, he has a patreon set up this way and gets 900$ per video. And since he got the patreon, he releases lower quality 2min videos much more frequently than before. So you always have to trust the person you give patreon money to.  Or the viewers should get more aggressive with canceling that stuff."
Shaboozey,38obk7,stainless7221,2,Sat Jun 6 09:10:41 2015 UTC,Its similar to kickstarter.  People have started to realize that theres a chance a product won't simply be delivered.
Shaboozey,38obk7,Molomar,12,Fri Jun 5 19:32:41 2015 UTC,"Right on point, i love this podcast and id love to have more of it. If they don't at least give us some kind of explanation I'm definitely pulling my pledge."
Shaboozey,38obk7,MasterFGH,15,Fri Jun 5 15:49:55 2015 UTC,Just pull your pledge now and renew it when you'll actually get what you've been promised. Any less is just perpetuating this whole thing and not giving them a reason to care.
Shaboozey,38obk7,JohnJimco,12,Fri Jun 5 22:08:06 2015 UTC,"Additionally, from the donation button on his Twitch profile (all emphasis his):   PLEASE DO NOT JUST GIVE ME MONEY. If I've earned it, consider investing in future videos. This is for when I do exceptionally well in your mind, not because I'm begging.   Everyone tweet this thread at him (@JesseCox), post it on his Facebook page, whatever, get his attention. Throw Crendor in there too (@wowcrendor, Facebook, wowcrendor@gmail.com), but I'm pretty sure this is 85% on Jesse.  I will 100% bring this up during the next Patreon meetup if they haven't commented on it somewhere by then."
Shaboozey,38obk7,icefall5,4,Fri Jun 5 22:01:01 2015 UTC,"I threw a few questions regarding this to him in the twitch chat during his latest stream, but it was probably lost in the chat."
Shaboozey,38obk7,Skjuludde,3,Fri Jun 5 23:59:36 2015 UTC,"It's pretty much all on Jesse, sadly. Crendor is notoriously (is that the right word) known for having free time to do things (even on short notice) and from time to time mentions how things don't happen because Jesse is busy. I feel bad for Crendor because he's kind of being dragged down here by association."
Shaboozey,38obk7,tonybateman,11,Thu Jun 11 06:14:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah the ""we don't even try"" subtitle on their Patreon page now seems just a bit sad."
Shaboozey,38obk7,OscarTheTitan,9,Sat Jun 6 09:59:23 2015 UTC,"I think jesse really should see that. Then again, there's a high chance that he's already aware of this. I mean after all, the CnC patreon clearly states that the team gets 3,5 grand a month regardless of the content produced while promising at least 10 episodes a month. Go figure."
Shaboozey,38obk7,FINblade,2,Fri Jun 5 18:42:04 2015 UTC,"It doesn't actually come out to the figure that's stated. People pledge with payment methods that doesn't come through, patreon takes their cut, and a few other things. That said, they get the majority of the money stated on the site."
Shaboozey,38obk7,thesirblondie,3,Sat Jun 6 09:41:26 2015 UTC,"Patreon seems to take a five percent cut on each donation. As such, and even if I'm being extremely rough with the calculation, the team would be making at least three grand a month. Assuming that the guys split their profits, it would still be around 1500 USD each. That's a substantial amount of money for making a third of the content promised, no?"
Shaboozey,38obk7,FINblade,10,Sat Jun 6 10:09:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for making this, because i have been thinking about it a lot, almost every time i listen to the podcast. I was about to make this too, but now i don't have to.  I think they should really change their model to ""per podcast pay"" and not monthly, because it just never is fair. Changing it to 5 per month would also work i think.  Also i think, if they really would do 10 episodes of the podcast a month, it would be garbage. They start lacking stuff to talk about already.  But in conclusion you are totally right calling it unethical! I feel the exact same way, even without being a patreon myself. I would be really pissed if i gave them money every month for this."
Shaboozey,38obk7,stainless7221,10,Sat Jun 6 09:06:23 2015 UTC,I'm not a Patreon backer - don't have the spare cash - but I really do feel Jesse and Crendor need to address this. I'm fine with the amount of content being produced because I don't pay for it.  I can totally understand those who do contribute being upset.
Shaboozey,38obk7,hackmastergeneral,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:46:17 2015 UTC,"I still give them a dollar a month, but before December of last year I was giving them $5 each month. I have a 40 minute commute to work each morning and I was my than willing to pay that much to make it more entertaining, I was legitimately excited about the ""revived"" CnC. A dollar isn't much, but I'm considering pulling out all together because they obviously have."
Shaboozey,38obk7,haloshade,6,Wed Jun 10 02:43:38 2015 UTC,"I pulled my money from their patreon a long time ago, they flatout lied to everyone and 3.5 grand a month is a pretty expensive lie. I kinda wish everyone would pull their pledge as at this point you are giving them money and getting not even half what you were promised."
Shaboozey,38obk7,JustiniZHere,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:04:06 2015 UTC,"With how Patreon works, don't they only get money if they actually make content?"
Shaboozey,38obk7,aztech101,6,Sat Jun 6 01:38:48 2015 UTC,"They have it set to be paid monthly, so no matter how many podcast they make they still get money, they could do a month with no podcast at all and still get nearly 4 grand."
Shaboozey,38obk7,JustiniZHere,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:38:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, me too. I love Jesse and Crendor and CnC animated is for me still one of the funniest stuff on the internet and had they promised, say, 5 episodes per month, I'd gladly pledge the same money, but overpromising by this lot is really bad and when they realized they can't actually deliver, they should've pulled the Patreon and possibly return the money.  The patreon was supposed to be a mean for them to do CnC without it hindering them financially so they can actually do CnC for profit and not as a sidenote whenever they have free time."
Shaboozey,38obk7,gorocz,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:12:09 2015 UTC,they should've pulled the Patreon and possibly return the money.   I would have even been fine with them just lowering the podcast per month advertised on the patreon down to say 5. It's a more reasonable number for them it seems and still allows people to fund them if they don't mind 5 a month.
Shaboozey,38obk7,JustiniZHere,15,Thu Jun 11 17:43:12 2015 UTC,"Its a simple case of getting conned.  Both Jesse and Crendor are really lax guys.  With no one actually forcing them to do anything, of course they're not going to do shit.  They're just gonna be happy with the money they get while throwing a bone out occasionally to keep people from whining.  It wouldn't be a big deal though if they just edited the patreon to reflect the fact that they aren't going to make that many."
Shaboozey,38obk7,Molomar,12,Fri Jun 5 19:20:31 2015 UTC,"I think this is heavily on Jesse's shoulders, in pretty much every time CnC recording trouble has came up in some videos or streams it is ""Jesse was/is busy"" and Crendog would have been available.  I wrote about this underperformance in Episode 97 thread and since that there has been 6 new episodes and likely 3 Patreon paydays if June has already been deposited.   Updated figures are therefore   ~ somewhere around 37000-38000$ total   ~900$ per episode since Patreon start  ~350$ per every episode ever (103 episodes)  (minus taxes and Patreon / other fees and divided to 2 persons)  But still, that is a lot of money thrown at them without getting much promised stuff in return. I wonder where this money is actually going, Jesse's E-sports team and all Ikeas in North America?"
Shaboozey,38obk7,Mademies,5,Fri Jun 5 20:08:38 2015 UTC,"They should just make it be x money for each episode, that's much better for the audience and they don't need the stable influx of money like some smaller people do."
Shaboozey,38obk7,Nightshayne,4,Sat Jun 6 08:57:41 2015 UTC,"I DO think that the 15/month was unrealistic but I do think one a month is silly as well.   However, iirc, Jesse has been running around a lot (Poland for W3, UK as well I THINK?!, not to mention E3 round the corner and his HoTS team shizz) Maybe it'll increase after that?   I am kinda doubtful but you can hope, I guess.  Question to the Patreon pledgers, is there still that monthly TS meet up thing?"
Shaboozey,38obk7,Keneshiro,14,Sat Jun 6 06:32:02 2015 UTC,"However, iirc, Jesse has been running around a lot (Poland for W3, UK as well I THINK?!, not to mention E3 round the corner and his HoTS team shizz) Maybe it'll increase after that?   Most likely a factor, but at the same time it's all a matter of priorities at the end of the day. In no other line of work you're able to take money in exchange for something, not deliver that something and instead travel around the world going to conventions, events, promotions etc. and be able to use that as an excuse for not delivering.   Besides if he knows that he'll be preoccupied with all these other projects and commitments, it would've been as easy as change the patreon to for example being per episode instead as well as making a full announcement that that has happened."
Shaboozey,38obk7,Skjuludde,5,Sat Jun 6 07:57:07 2015 UTC,Even on the road he should be able to do a 30 minute skype-call.. maybe not as high - quality but a fillershow looks like he tried at least.
Shaboozey,38obk7,mattiejj,2,Sat Jun 6 09:21:29 2015 UTC,"True. Not disagreeing that 3k(I think) for 2-3 episodes in appalling. I honestly think if he is gonna continue like that, he has to put an announcement on the page. Can't make unreasonable goals if he can't handle it.   I remember him saying that they were gonna 'come back and do more' but it never happened"
Shaboozey,38obk7,Keneshiro,2,Sat Jun 6 08:05:44 2015 UTC,If it was per episode then there would be no other problem other than wishing this great podcast was made more frequently.
Shaboozey,38obk7,Skjuludde,1 point,Sat Jun 6 08:36:45 2015 UTC,"Unlikely, but could you imagine 3k an ep? (I mean, that's what they're kinda making now, but still..)"

The thing is, they've been saying this since the beggining. That Jesse has a lot of work and that Jesse was doing a show for G&S, that they are gonna be at one con or another, but after that, CnC is gonna catch up again. But it never did. It just dies out more."

For our sake and Crendor's sake I reeeeeally hope he doesn't do that but I wouldn't doubt it.

I don't see the minimum amount listed on their page anymore.

Paying for content monthly and not having it delivered as promised for almost a year is not entitlement, and finally complaining about it after 10 months is not entitlement.  Its communication you dumb ass whore, because people come here to give their concerns because they care, a non-caring fan would just stop paying after August or September last year.

Personally, a dollar isn't that big of deal to get worked up over. And people who are getting worked up just sounds like they suffer from #FirstWorldProblems."

Shaboozey,38n9r0,Vertiguous,3,Fri Jun 5 09:01:50 2015 UTC,"I was hoping Jesse would try to swim over to the city he didn't have a pass to get into. I did that completely by accident, I wasn't even playing attention and didn't realize I needed a pass. It was just the shortest way from point A to point B to just swim across.

Shaboozey,38ajso,herper147,46,Tue Jun 2 23:26:01 2015 UTC,I just refrain from watching the HoTS streams and accept that most people will behave that way when playing any kind of moba. Especially solo-queue.
Shaboozey,38ajso,Tearyn_,16,Tue Jun 2 23:38:33 2015 UTC,"To be clear, i don't like it, and i personally tried hard not to be like that back when i played MOBAs.  But I've seen enough people who are not usually toxic become so when playing those games that I no longer hold it against them as individuals."
Shaboozey,38ajso,Tearyn_,2,Wed Jun 3 03:44:24 2015 UTC,It was always the opposite for me. I get super frustrated in other games but dota makes me zen master. Hear no evil speak no evil. Totally do some evil now and then though.
Shaboozey,38ajso,etree,29,Wed Jun 3 08:33:44 2015 UTC,"Just wondered why nobody brings this up   Well, he calls it ""Heroes of the Salt"" for a reason. He's aware of attitude and they've talked about the over-competitiveness on the Cooptional podcast a few times. I think he probably gets extra views from people that like seeing him flip out.  That said, it's not my cup of tea either. I stopped watching the HotS streams a long time ago, and I have a friend who even unsubscribed from Jesse's youtube channel because of those videos."
Shaboozey,38ajso,rolls20s,8,Wed Jun 3 04:41:14 2015 UTC,"I like watching streamers that get angry etc, but usually they are pros or actually very good at the game. Watching a low rank player get angry just makes me sad."

Shaboozey,38ajso,rolls20s,3,Wed Jun 3 18:38:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. I guess his feeling was that someone who can be so toxic wasn't worth his time. He wasn't a big fan of Jesse outside of a few specific Let's Plays anyway."
Shaboozey,38ajso,elfranco001,16,Wed Jun 3 19:10:29 2015 UTC,He is really toxic for sure. He is the kind of player i hate to play with.
Shaboozey,38ajso,thesirblondie,2,Wed Jun 3 03:06:35 2015 UTC,Salt is bad for the heart
Shaboozey,38ajso,Xeropix,8,Thu Jun 4 00:23:37 2015 UTC,"He's very new to MOBA style games in general, and is going through that phase, that I'm sure most people have gone through with that type of game, where he thinks it's always the team's fault that they're losing because he's played longer than them."
Shaboozey,38ajso,SirVelocifaptor,6,Thu Jun 4 12:26:36 2015 UTC,So glad I skipped this phase. Played with toxic people one match and told myself that I ain't ending up like that
Shaboozey,38ajso,RookieBalboa25,2,Wed Jun 3 01:29:39 2015 UTC,"My friends begged me to play LoL.  I played it once, they were angry.   I quit. I never see them play it now. Like you said, just a phase."
Shaboozey,38ajso,SirVelocifaptor,2,Wed Jun 3 11:06:12 2015 UTC,"The thing is though, the behaviour is a phase, not the game. I still play Dota a lot."
Shaboozey,38ajso,MentlegenBacon,5,Wed Jun 3 17:14:24 2015 UTC,"I love Jesse, but I've avoided all of his HoTS streams for awhile now. He reminds me of the player I don't want to play with. :p"
Shaboozey,38ajso,TragicMagic44,6,Wed Jun 3 19:22:53 2015 UTC,I know at one point in the podcast jesse mentioned he didn't like playing Pvp games( it was referencing starcraft) because he gets so competitive. For whatever reason he likes hots enough to play it on stream but that competitiveness is remarkably apparent. Made worse by the mentality inherent to the moba genre. I honestly can't stand the games for that reason alone.
Shaboozey,38ajso,therealsealman,2,Wed Jun 3 05:39:31 2015 UTC,I too am very competitive but it doesn't make me angry. I just urge the team to carry on and raise morale as this will make us more likely to win.  Whining and calling them idiots is only gonna make it worse.
Shaboozey,38ajso,Nightshayne,4,Wed Jun 3 04:28:58 2015 UTC,"When I first read this post, I interpreted you as overreacting to Jesse's rage moments. I watched a lot of Jesse's Heroes gameplay when he was streaming with Crendor and Husky. His saltyness from back then was pretty funny and silly. I haven't been tuning into his streams as regularly as I used to.  I just tuned into his stream now, and my goodness, I see exactly what you mean. It's pretty unnecessary how annoyed he gets. His teammates are making mistakes, but I'm also seeing him do a few bad plays.   I understand that it can be disappointing when someone you admire or respect acts childish when playing a game (DOTA ruined one friendship in particular for me), but IMO, it's really not worth addressing. Just know that toxicity in a videogame isn't always a direct reflection of their character. I don't care for the way Jesse talks to his team, but I know that he's still a big ol' sweetie pie and I feel comfortable continuing to support his stream and content."
Shaboozey,38ajso,Jairus30,2,Wed Jun 3 07:32:25 2015 UTC,"Chu8 went over to HotS now? Loved watching him play Dota and when he went over to Hearthstone it was still good, he is a very cool guy."
Shaboozey,38ajso,Mabuss,3,Wed Jun 3 21:58:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah he is super chill, I had never heard of him before HoTs but he mentioned he used to play DOTA and some SC2.  Plus he explains a far amount of what he is doing."
Shaboozey,38ajso,therealsealman,4,Wed Jun 3 11:16:02 2015 UTC,"There is a big difference between him raging at other players in the game chat and him just raging to himself. If he types it in game chat he should be reported for harassment. If he is just raging to himself, his teammates don't know it so no harm done IMO. I don't watch his streams so I don't know which he does."
Shaboozey,38ajso,hackmastergeneral,5,Wed Jun 3 11:24:16 2015 UTC,"Bit of both, but he often types in chat to call teammates idiots or stupid because they didn't follow him. I don't mind people raging to themselves we all do that sometimes but it doesn't hurt anyone."

Wasnt one of the big selling points that it is totally team-based and has no snowballing? Played it once and went straight back to Lol and never touched it again, so i may be wrong, but i got the impression that Hots was so incredibly anti-competitive that it would be impossible to be ""toxic"" (at least by League/dota standards)"
Shaboozey,38ajso,Zimzams123,2,Sat Jun 6 16:37:10 2015 UTC,"It's actually become the opposite. If one player is doing poorly, he's pulling the rest of the team down since they'll all be falling behind in EXP.   Teamfights are also more common in hots, from what I can tell, because the objectives are so important. If a player doesn't show up to a teamfight, then you're at a severe disadvantage."
Shaboozey,38ajso,kamistra,2,Wed Jun 3 12:54:47 2015 UTC,The trouble is those same people that were toxic in LoL come over thinking this game is casual and they are the best and so end up losing and blaming the team and spread their toxic behaviour here.   I played LoL for 3 years and I ended up quitting because of the community.
Shaboozey,38ajso,Iandrasil,-2,Thu Jun 4 12:31:37 2015 UTC,"It isn't casual? Also isn't the whole point that you win and loose as a team, unlike Lol where if your midlaner feeds then that can ruin the game for the other 4 people? If you dont think you did anything wrong, blaming the team seems like the next logical step to me"
Shaboozey,38ajso,SaintKairu,6,Wed Jun 3 13:37:23 2015 UTC,"Because you gain experience as a team, a feeder can make the game snowball harder in HoTS. Instead of just having fed the midlaner, you have a fed entire other team."
Shaboozey,38ajso,BlueSapphyre,3,Wed Jun 3 13:43:21 2015 UTC,Hmm thats an.. interesting mechanic. No wonder Jesse gets upset
Shaboozey,38ajso,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:04:24 2015 UTC,"Jesse isnt, half the player he thinks he is :)  He plays Nova like any other newbie, just running around waiting for someone to have low hp - and trying to snipe them..

Shaboozey,38ajso,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:20:45 2015 UTC,"So Jesse is totally representative of most people who play ARTS games is what you're saying? I've got 750+ hours in dota2 150 hours in HoN and a couple of hours in LoL, they're pretty much all like this.  Also he does give advice but advice is rarely taken in these games as people either tend to believe they're right and who is giving them advice is wrong no matter how legit the advice is.  This is why I only play this game in a premade group of 5, the objectives are too team oriented to make it doable with people who are unco-ordinated (and way too often unwilling to communicate) when it comes to the team effort."
Shaboozey,38ajso,Caramel_Meatball,2,Wed Jun 3 00:35:14 2015 UTC,Just because it's representative doesn't make it right.
Shaboozey,38ajso,DeGeiDragon,0,Wed Jun 3 15:56:44 2015 UTC,The salt is why people watch. It's been a running joke for a long time.
Shaboozey,38ajso,pithy_fuck,10,Wed Jun 3 20:37:39 2015 UTC,"I don't mind someone being salty, we all are sometimes. But I find insulting team-mates to be a step too far, its all fun and games if he is moaning about them on stream but in game chat seems like its just ruining everyone's fun as we all hate that guy that bitches and moans for the whole game if you dont do what he says then blames you when it goes wrong."
Shaboozey,38ajso,KelloPudgerro,-3,Wed Jun 3 11:32:56 2015 UTC,Maybe it's just not your cup of tea. I watch Heroes of the Salt for the rage fits. It's quite entertaining to me.
Shaboozey,38ajso,MuhEsports,7,Wed Jun 3 11:39:46 2015 UTC,I like watching people get mad but I find theres a difference between being salty and being toxic.   I like it when streamers lose it and start screaming to the stream but not when they are doing in game to other players as it just ruins it for everyone involved and it just paints this game as just another MOBA filled with ragers and kids.
Shaboozey,38a12v,Nitrate112,6,Tue Jun 2 21:24:31 2015 UTC,"I truly wonder if Jesse will ever, and I do mean ever, remember he's leveled up and has skill points to use."

Shaboozey,37zywu,zIRaXor,11,Mon Jun 1 09:44:19 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely play it first before watching anything about the game. Once you get a few hours in, you can probably start watching it without any spoilers.  That said, his series isn't that great yet due to the fact that the entire first area was spoiled for him when he got to play the game early at CD Projekt Red.  However, It'll most definitely get better once he's in areas he hasn't already been to and he's not going through the motions replaying everything."
Shaboozey,37zywu,LARGames,1 point,Sun May 31 22:17:00 2015 UTC,I still dont understand why did he disable tutorials when most of the time he has no idea what hes doing. Its different to disable them if you have played the whole game but after just few hours in poland imo its not enough but oh well
Shaboozey,37zywu,Axenor,6,Sat Jun 6 07:56:46 2015 UTC,"Jesse has said this time and time again, he's one of those old school RPG gamers, in every literal sense of the word of a TRUE old school RPG gamers. You can expect him to explore, a lot, and not just a lot, he will literally see an interesting rock formation and he will just HAVE to journey there just to see if it holds any stories or cool treasures.  He will have that same interest in flowers. He will do every side mission along with the main quest and won't leave any stone left un-turned."

I don't think they've ever made 10 per month.  So what's the deal? Have either of them made any mention of this? It seems very scammy. At the rate they're going do they even need a patreon?

Shaboozey,37ei22,Orchuntsman,3,Wed May 27 01:13:17 2015 UTC,Did you watch the prologue? It was pretty clear what happened.
Shaboozey,37ei22,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Wed May 27 01:39:10 2015 UTC,"I went back and watched Jesse's 1st video, didn't answer the question. What happened that lead Geralt to leave Roach and Triss at the end of the 2nd game. Last I remember from Jesse's Witcher 2 series is Geralt, Roach and Triss walking together away from where the final part of the game took place."
Shaboozey,37ei22,Elkkumania,3,Wed May 27 05:35:09 2015 UTC,They talk about it when you meet them. In short Roche went to face the invading Nilfgaardians and defend Temeria and Triss went into hiding because Redania is hunting mages and sorceresses.
Shaboozey,37ei22,Merrena,1 point,Wed May 27 08:59:59 2015 UTC,"Since Geralt got his memory back he started looking for Yennefer, who later contacts him by letter.  Since he's with Vesemir, we can probably assume Geralt went back to Kaer Morhen or met Vesemir while he was on the Path and they decided to travel together.  No idea why everyone split off, but you find out what happens with Triss and Roche in W3 and what they have been up to.  I believe the time skip between 2 and 3 is about 6 months."
Shaboozey,37ei22,plspirit,3,Wed May 27 06:19:59 2015 UTC,"Witchers stay the winter in Kaer Morhen, it's spring as Vesemir mentioned, so i assume one winter has passed since Witcher 2  Witcher 1 took place in 1268, Witcher 2 1271 and Witcher 3 1272"

Shaboozey,379hyn,Rolpege,6,Mon May 25 23:37:29 2015 UTC,"Love how that story came full circle. I discovered it the other way around, did the noonwraith first and then the griffin. But man, that hit hard."
Shaboozey,374dlc,mrpoopypantss,4,Sun May 24 19:40:23 2015 UTC,"Why is Jesse so against that Nilfgaardian? We haven't seen him do anything bad and the only reason Jesse doesn't like him is apparently that he sent soldiers after griffins that were killing several people. He even found a weeks old corpse that had apparently died after a long time in agony.  Seriously, does he have knowledge of what's going to happen or is being a dick to the captain for no reason?"
Shaboozey,374dlc,LordSwedish,12,Sun May 24 20:49:30 2015 UTC,"In the Witcher 2 Nilfgaard had a part in the assassination of Temeria's king, whom Geralt had sworn allegiance to, and then Nilfgaard used this advantage to take over Temeria. So Geralt, and Jesse by proxy, are predisposed to not really get along with Nilfgaardians."
Shaboozey,374dlc,Xeropix,10,Sun May 24 21:07:25 2015 UTC,"I think it has to  do with the fact that the Captain seemed like such an honorable man and was so nice and welcoming, yet he had failed to mention the reason that the attacks where happening is because he requisitioned his men to kill the female griffin (sending the male into a frenzy). We never hear about two griffins attacking people because they caused the attacks, add that to what the alchemist said about ""First they clean out the monsters then the people"""
Shaboozey,374dlc,Bishopkilljoy,1 point,Mon May 25 00:46:00 2015 UTC,Well we do hear about the two griffins attacking people because Jesse found several skeletons and corpses around the nest.
Shaboozey,374dlc,LordSwedish,1 point,Mon May 25 09:07:47 2015 UTC,But much less frequently and less aggressively.
Shaboozey,374dlc,gooblaster17,1 point,Tue May 26 01:33:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, the point is that sending soldiers to kill the griffins was a perfectly valid decision and doesn't mean the captain had any sinister plans. Nothing the Nilfgaardians have done so far (in this town anyway) shows any indication of them being particularly villainous."

Shaboozey,368vtq,Nihilore,5,Sun May 17 08:27:09 2015 UTC,"Disclosure?  EDIT: Disclosure now in the Video Info section.  Either I missed it before, or it was added after I saw it."
Shaboozey,368vtq,the_icebear,6,Sun May 17 14:56:31 2015 UTC,"It's sort of there, buried deep in the video info. But I agree that it could be better visible. Doesn't Jesse usually just call these ""Jesse sells out"" to avoid any confusion? Though to be honest I could see why potential sponsors wouldn't like that..."
Shaboozey,368vtq,Nzgrim,5,Sun May 17 17:55:49 2015 UTC,Certainly not in a great spot. I wouldn't have known if it weren't for TB's video. He had it plastered all over.
Shaboozey,368vtq,RousingRabble,4,Sun May 17 19:59:37 2015 UTC,"God I wish people would just get over this whole thing. If you are a reviewer or news type person (like TB) disclosure is important.  If you are an LPer, what does it matter WHY the pewrson is playing a game? This video is no different than any other video he makes.  Noone comes for Jesse's professional opinion on games, noone wants Jesse reviewing games (not that he has any interest in this anyway), they come to watch him play a game.  I think if you are making editorial content, disclosure is important.  If you're just playing the freaking games, who cares if he got paid to play it? This whole issue has been a tempest in a teapot."
Shaboozey,368vtq,hackmastergeneral,5,Mon May 18 01:08:16 2015 UTC,"Well, it's the law, to start with.   Secondly, if Jesse likes a game, that game is going to sell more. It doesn't matter that what he does isn't editorial, because Let's Players sell games too. If Jesse makes a lot of videos on a game, it implies that he likes the game. Knowing that the reason he continues making videos of the game is important, which in this case is because he's getting paid."
Shaboozey,368vtq,thesirblondie,1 point,Mon May 18 08:10:34 2015 UTC,"Yup -- he may not do critical content, but that doesn't mean the opinion doesn't matter and it's important to know if the opinion is biased.  Having a bias isn't a problem. Having a bias that people don't know about is.  But ultimately, it is such a simple, easy thing to fix -- there really isn't a reason not to. TB had notification of the deal in three different spots. It was impossible to miss."

Shaboozey,362nyp,thesirblondie,8,Fri May 15 19:08:56 2015 UTC,"If you want more TB&J, I suggest you check out their very shortlived Dead Rising 2 series.  If you want another long series, I suggest you check out Saints Row 3 with Crendor. Outlast is another good C&J series, if you're into Horror games.  One more great collab series is Resident Evil 6 with Cry.  If you're looking for solo series, my personal favourites are Fahrenheit - Indigo Prophecy, Beyond Two Souls, and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance."

The duo first rose to fame as actors on the children's television show Byker Grove, during which and in their subsequent pop career they were respectively known as PJ & Duncan – the names of the characters they played on the show. Since then, they have had a very successful career as television presenters, presenting shows such as SMTV Live, Friends Like These, Pop Idol, Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway, I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, PokerFace, Push the Button, Britain's Got Talent, Red or Black?, and Text Santa. In 2006, they returned to acting with the film Alien Autopsy. In October 2014, it was announced that the duo would present the 2015 Brit Awards.  Ant is the taller of the two at 5 ft 8 in (1.73 m), and Dec is two inches shorter at 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m).

Shaboozey,33ljp1,Moaz13,2,Thu Apr 23 14:37:16 2015 UTC,Wasn't it changed to 10 episodes? And it takes a lot more than 30 mins of work a month. It's more like 30 mins per episode.
Shaboozey,33ljp1,BlueSapphyre,6,Thu Apr 23 15:11:17 2015 UTC,I know but on average in the last two months we got 1-2 episodes per month.
Shaboozey,33ljp1,Skjuludde,2,Thu Apr 23 15:37:20 2015 UTC,Yeah I noticed it slowed down a lot after the initial burst. It's not as infrequent as pre-patron accouncement days. But still 1750$ a month per head is not a small sum of money. It should be a higher priority you'd think.   Oh well. Got a new episode recently :)
Shaboozey,33ljp1,BlueSapphyre,-3,Thu Apr 23 18:39:34 2015 UTC,"But still 1750$ a month per head is not a small sum of money.   Once you factor in cost of living and taxes, that's not a lot of money. To put it in perspective you could be a dockworker and make $200k in Cali."
Shaboozey,33ljp1,Skjuludde,3,Fri Apr 24 12:00:10 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't be, if it was their only revenue source.  However let's say it takes them combined 3 hours per half an hour episode. 10 episodes a month would constitute at least 30 hours of time invested. That would result in over a hundred dollars per hour invested. In other words, still quite a lot of money."
Shaboozey,33ljp1,BlueSapphyre,2,Fri Apr 24 12:07:11 2015 UTC,But doing more episodes isn't going to make them significantly more money.
Shaboozey,33ljp1,Skjuludde,7,Fri Apr 24 12:11:54 2015 UTC,Of course not. Just a matter of upholding promises and doing right by their fans.
Shaboozey,33ljp1,Vendetta4825,2,Fri Apr 24 12:20:08 2015 UTC,You say that like a dockworker is a low level job. They have waiting lists to get into that union that most people never see the end of. They make a ton of money for not a lot of work.

I skimmed down cos someone said ""Though it doesn't seem like she herself is hiding anything, judging from her tweets."" and I skimmed her feed but only found one reference to him and that was about a cosplay, maybe I missed something more obvious between pics of cats ;) end edit.  Sure Sam is well known, but Lady Crendor?  And that's working on the assumption that the woman in Crendor IRL videos is his GF and not a friend or sister (TBH I don't look into their social lives).  So if she is just some 'random' woman not famous on the internet, would she be willing to have eyeballs on her?  I know I wouldn't in her shoes.  If this announcement was closer to cox con and she was still unknown, I assume any photo released with a fan kissing/hugging the Cox could be seen as ""is this her?"".  Best analogy would be actors dating actors/celebs vs actors dating regular people, yeah you can stick a microphone in front of Angelina Jolie when they are on the red carpet for Brad's latest, but doing the same to someone who married them when they were in accounting and the other was unknown, its kinda odd until they have been on the social circuit more.  edit: I do not know if Leila Idrissova is the lady in question, or who she is and what she does, I could google further, but TBH it seems creepy, nothing sprang up at me saying ""I make the videos on the YouTubes guys come check me out."" so she could be any one or anything, but out of my need to know comfort zone."

I bet Jesse doesn't go to aquariums because of things like this.  Although, every time I hear him complain about sharks, it always makes me wonder just why exactly he is even afraid of them?  The only sharks that are super mean and will go out of their way to eat you are bull sharks.  Unless you decide to piss off a great white(ahem lady in the video).  The point is, sharks aren't all that mean.  They'll bite your head off if they feel like it but most of the time, they won't care about a person.  Now, I'm curious about something else.  If Jesse is so afraid of sharks then is he also afraid of crocodiles and alligators?  I know I am.  Crocodiles are way more badass than sharks.  At least you can escape a shark by going on land.  Crocodiles will just chase you."
Shaboozey,32v3fs,Detension,9,Thu Apr 16 23:26:06 2015 UTC,"I hate geek and sundry's idiotic ""one channel, all the shows"" model, you can't upload videos too quickly without YT throwing a fit, and if you don't watch enough episode of a channel it can vanish from your sub box, I only watch table top and spell slingers on that channel, the rest is garbage (until Jesse's show comes on) they should split the different shows into separate channels, no need to wait for one to end before airing the next then and no risk of missing the shows you do want to see because you didn't watch enough of the other shows."

Shaboozey,32v3fs,Spyro_A_Dragon,-4,Fri Apr 17 12:33:33 2015 UTC,Yeah! And Jesse should make a separate channel for each of his play throughs. Just because I want to watch Farcry doesn't mean I want to see Dragon Age. /s

Shaboozey,32jily,Kursoc,24,Tue Apr 14 08:14:43 2015 UTC,"Probably not. His content slowed down a lot because of side-projects like co-optional boardgames, organising coxcon, and doing a yet to air geek and sundry show. Even the Cox n Crendor monthly amount of episodes mentioned on their patreon was never reached because of reasons we don't know. I think Jesse had too much work to play a whole array of ""clickbait games""."
Shaboozey,32jily,mattiejj,13,Tue Apr 14 09:01:51 2015 UTC,"He started several series of too long games.. And his geek & sundry show hasn't started, which might've brought in new viewers and subs...  Maybe Rollplay will provide the neccesary boost ;)"
Shaboozey,32jily,Crudelita5,4,Tue Apr 14 11:26:21 2015 UTC,"Problem is that the whole YT'er scene is basically a HUGE petri-dish of personalities. 140 characters over the web can unravel whole partnerships that were built on what both parties thought would be a mutual understanding on some principles which is only shown once the going gets tough. (As we've seen by GG or TB calling out the Yogscast on their Kickstarter debacle.)  This inherently bears the risk of any partnership falling through REALLY fast if your standing with the other parties isn't super good. From what I've grasped the same happened to one participant of the Blood-Bowl League, who had quite the standing with Polaris (and our favourite three knuckleheads within it) and played his hand wrong and alienated a whole bunch of viewers.  I think the lesson we all can learn from this is that YT'ing for your daily income is the same as working every job where you have to collaborate with other people, It can enable you to be your best and even motivate you to go beyond what you thought capable. But at the worst times it can become bullying at the workplace, going so far as that your workplace is semi-transparent and can influence your very own income flow."

I'm not just saying that out of some personal preference.  It only seems like more videos following Jesse, Greg, Jirard, and Davis with their special guest, Evan Williams, as they go through scary games would rake in the subscriptions."

It's kind of like what happened to the original co-host of ""The Greenlight.""  Josh was his name I think, but anyway; Jesse had to replace him with Jared Rosen after something crazy happened with the original co-host.  I'm not saying Jesse is cursed, but he seems to be cursed since all of his co-hosts end up dropping off the face of the internet after some sort of fallout.  Now, I wonder which is more depressing.  Never seeing the fabulous Evan Williams again, or having one of the main personalities of the show replaced as if he were never there."

There is nothing more than some simple, basebuilding+upgrades and this rather underwhelming combatsystem.            The randomness just sets you up for frustration and seeing that you'd probably spend a lot of time just grinding points to get enough STR to win the random cointoss, I doubt it is a really ""fun"" game in the longterm."

Assuming for a moment that G&S DID have a problem with Jesse, why did he host one of their inaugural shows on their twitch channel (he interviewed one of the Skull Girls devs) and why is he still in a lot of their promotional footage for said twitch channel? Also, I believe he is due to have another episode of that soon (he left to set up coxcon almost immediately after the first episode)"

There's so freaking many of them, it takes ages, and the only difficult thing about them is usually trying to locate the small stuff in an area (like the mask), which just makes it tedious..  Also, that Goat ending was about as anti-climatic as it could be."

His south park videos showed anal probes and pretty much made fun of every stereotype possible, a guy fucking a horse and a child's mum and dad doing it in the background, his saints row video has a lot of adult content in the game (A purple dildo bat anyone? :P), has a scene where you race using people in gimp outfits pulling you on a chariot and he constantly made hitler jokes through out the series... I doubt what ever GTA V has could possibly top half the stuff he airs on his channel.  I would probably hate a lets play of the missions and story but I wouldn't mind him and Crendor to jump into the online content and get into their normal shenanigans.

Shaboozey,31tzio,jittyot,9,Wed Apr 8 07:46:10 2015 UTC,"Well, most of the series are self contained.  (I say most because the original spins off into Solum)  IMO, the strongest one is Rollplay: Swan Song, it's basically a space epic (they fly around in a spaceship and do stuff).  My second favorite is Rollplay: Mirrorshades.  It has Dodger in it, and it's also sci-fi (but it's 80's scifi, so if someone from the 70/80's predicted the future).  The West Marches is a one shot style, which means, most weeks it has new guests (minus jp), so 3 of the 4 adventurers are completely different, but the environment stays the same.  Rollplay (no subtitle), was the first, and that continues onto Solum (which has like 3 seasons or something now, honestly, I don't keep up with it).  Dark Heresy is the one TB was in, and might get restarted soon (TB said once he got over cancer he would like to)  Then there is R&D, which has several mini-series style playthroughs.  Each one is self contained, and I've only seen a couple of them (I think there is 5 or 6 total).  Jesse's first one is the best imo (R&D: Numenera).  There is actually a viewers guide of sorts at http://itmejp.com/rollplay/"
Shaboozey,31tzio,banana_pirate,3,Wed Apr 8 08:17:02 2015 UTC,I know there's one where dodger is pregnant with a demon baby (she mentioned in the podcast)   Any lead on which one that is?

Shaboozey,31tzio,Udal,3,Wed Apr 8 11:43:24 2015 UTC,"In addition to what /u/link07 said, Apocalypse World is also pretty fun. Fallout style post apocalyptic world. JP plays an awesome character in it. It is an R&D series.  However, if you want to see Jesse in a maid outfit, Maid RPG is where it's at."
Shaboozey,31tzio,Halefire,2,Wed Apr 8 15:50:33 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, how did I ever forget Maid RPG, it's by far the funniest, even if the story isn't the greatest"

Shaboozey,31tzio,nived321,3,Wed Apr 8 21:15:00 2015 UTC,"What I said to /u/jittyot is probably the best overview of each individual series I can provide; the viewers guide I linked at the end of that post is a bit better.  If you mean a brief overview of the purpose, well it's just streamed and recorded dungeons and dragons (well, that's a game system, so really, it's just considered ""rollplay games""), that many (myself included), find entertaining because it's kinda like a fantasy book or tv show"

Twin Peaks is one of my favorite shows, having originally watched it in October to see what the hype was about with the third season really made me appreciate the series. It's really disappointing to see Lynch leave after creating a unique universe with the quirkiest cast of characters I've ever seen on television. I hope the new show runner can keep up with Lynch, hopefully it'll be his co-creator Mark Frost."
Shaboozey,31kpr6,haloshade,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:26:51 2015 UTC,"I have never watched it. In fact, I first heard about Mr. Lynch was through Crendor's magnificent ""brain fish"" quote. I have since then watched one or two of his ""music videos"" and decided that was enough crazy for the month. Is the series better?"
Shaboozey,31kpr6,haloshade,2,Wed Apr 8 03:30:35 2015 UTC,"The series did something that none of his work could really do: make it palatable to the common audience. Unlike his other works which are really surrealist and out there, Peaks was a combination of his surrealism and fascination with the supernatural with something the typical TV watcher of the 90s was familiar with: soap operas.  The story is about the investigation of the murderer of Laura Palmer, who was perfect teenaged girl in her small town of Twin Peaks, WA near the Canadian boarder. She was the prom queen, a selfless volunteer, and much more. The series follows Dale Cooper, FBI who was sent to the small town to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding Palmer's death, as he investigates the clues get stranger and stranger until they become surreal and supernatural leading to a whole bunch of hidden lore about the town.  That's just the A plot, running parallel to the main plot are a whole bunch of B plots about the town's citizens after Palmer's death and Cooper's arrival, from the Palmer's family struggle with their daughter's death, to a power struggle between the two most powerful people in the town. These B plotlines take on the style of a soap opera, but the quirkiness of all the characters, and the overdramatic actions they take turns the entire soap opera plot into, at least how I saw it, a parody of a soap opera but played straight.  So what you end up getting is an odd blend of a serious supernatural FBI investigation of the murder of the town's favorite girl in the foreground but with a quirky soap opera playing out in the background. It's, in my opinion, a really refreshing series even if it is 24 years old. It's a damn good piece of entertainment."

As for the game, it was a no-brainer as soon as the console configuration was announced. They'd be stupid not to do it."

Shaboozey,2zxutm,rezala,2,Sun Mar 22 20:57:59 2015 UTC,No he has not played it yet. But he has said on a stream (I don't remember which one though) that eventually it will be played.

Shaboozey,2zwycx,aznidb,1 point,Sun Mar 22 16:55:13 2015 UTC,He literally hated the game.  I played it myself and thought it was okey.. the beginning was a bit shitty and it just isn't a real horror game. Which is why he didn't upload it for scary game squad.
Shaboozey,2zwycx,insef4ce,1 point,Sun Mar 22 17:08:09 2015 UTC,Ya from what he said it was badly designed.  Either the game was super easy or unfairly hard with no middle ground.
Shaboozey,2ztcdc,apathy_syndrome,2,Sat Mar 21 16:04:17 2015 UTC,I don't know if that exists for type-0. Type-0 hasn't been released outside of america til now. He may have been talking about 13-3 lighting returns. Which makes more sense in since its the only recent final fantasy rant i remember.
Shaboozey,2ztcdc,HecticTangent,2,Sun Mar 22 04:05:49 2015 UTC,You're almost definitely thinking of 13-3. Jesse and TB said in the last podcast that type 0 is supposed to be good.
Shaboozey,2ztcdc,Gukiguy,1 point,Sun Mar 22 12:46:05 2015 UTC,"The same however can be said for type-0. There are too many terms they threw in like palintstine and l'cie and cie'th. They could of just used generic terms like country, chosen, and undead."
Shaboozey,2ztcdc,HecticTangent,0,Mon Mar 23 23:20:56 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Terms and proper nouns enrich the story and the world, and it makes us feel immersion on the game/book/movie/story.  Throwing many terms or proper nouns is not a bad things. If you read Game of Thrones (an example of great writing) you will find yourself flooded with proper nouns.  The problem with Type-0 is the vain tentative of writing something really good (the idea is awesome) with almost no experience and/or no literature technique. You can expose information through a lot of channels in a game: visual, written books or notes, dialogues, action, et cetera.  The problem for this game is that THE BEST pieces of writing are scattered on random NPCs (maybe the intern was a good writer, different from the bosses). So, instead of showing us and making us feel part of the story, they throw us some information through dumb dialogs. Sometimes they want to be a good writer and do not TELL US the information, so they try to show in a poorly executed way that almost no one gets. And I bet while they read their game script they think they were the best writers ever.  There are plenty of games that show us little pieces of – or almost no – information and we are told the tales of the world by taking our own conclusions (Dark Souls, anyone?).  My opinion is that Type-0 has a great idea and a bad writer. Maybe someone could have done this an excellent game. But – in my opinion – they focused too much on the engine and forgot to hire a person who could expose to everyone the story they wanted to tell in an intelligent and non dumb-guessing way (my neologism for when they guess that us, the players, are dumb and cannot understand some concepts)."
Shaboozey,2ztcdc,PointOfParadox,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:14:26 2015 UTC,Would you say the same for the idea and legend of etro behind ffxiii series. Because I did enjoy the legend there however only characters like caius and yeul carried it out well. I have not play much type-0 im still working on it. But i very much enjoy its world story and i enjoy the idea of crystals making l'cie instead of fal'cie.   Its funny you mention dark souls because i am way more entranced by bloodbournes story right now and its distracting me from playing final fantasy lol.
Shaboozey,2ztcdc,HecticTangent,1 point,Wed Mar 25 20:47:12 2015 UTC,"I cannot give you an answer for this FF - XIII question. I did not play FF - XIII yet. I am sorry =(.  But I guess the writing on Square Enix games have to step up their writing (they have vices from other medias, like Animes. But they did not incorporate the qualities).  There are games like Bioshock that show us a really good example of how the path of writing on games is supposed to be. Or maybe (for RPG series) DragonAge, where the lore is not thrown on your face through dumb dialogues.  I hope Square Enix steps up on it. I really do."
Shaboozey,2ztcdc,PointOfParadox,1 point,Thu Mar 26 11:51:37 2015 UTC,"You're likely thinking of 13-3 Lightning Returns. He's ranted it about it a few times, but you are probably thinking about this one where they watch the trailer for the game and he goes off on it after he downed a bottle of Irn Bru.   Also, the longest discussion/rant on the game is here after he gave up on the game (which is still in a playlist on his channel)."

Shaboozey,2zdb7p,mattiejj,14,Tue Mar 17 21:50:32 2015 UTC,"I think this is ""not angry, just so disappointed"" reaction like with so many other content creator Patreons have proven to be.   Their Patreon has been on since September, so that's likely 7 monthly payments now. Received sum was larger in the start, 3800$ now. Using this sum as example, they have received 26600$ (minus taxes I assume?). 34 episodes since September makes that about 780$ per episode (minus taxes). If we stretch the sum to all 97 episodes from all way from Nov 2012, that is still 275$ (- taxes) per episode.  That amount of money for audio only podcast they originally promised 15 episodes per month, now 10 per month, actual amount since Patreon start hovering little under 5 per month. So much more content should be happening."
Shaboozey,2zdb7p,Mademies,1 point,Wed Mar 18 00:50:11 2015 UTC,"That was something I DID find strange. I recalled that they promised 15 a month, but I was hesitant about how realistic it was.

I hate when game packs in 5 differen difficulty, all of them being horribly balanced. What happened to designing a difficulty that the game is intended to be played on ? All that happens with sliders is dev design difficult to be ""Not challenging at all"" , ""Way to challenging"".   Games are a experience, and if dev dont have a specific difficulty in mind it just becomes a mess.  This game is hard, fucking hard at times. I started getting Donkey Kong flash backs of getting killed hundred time over on a single stage. But I worked my way through it, learning a little bit every time till I could clear a sequence."

I wasn't there but reportedly he went HAM at the girls, he was FURIOUS.  it was the ""Team Brutus"" vs ""Team Ceasar"" stream, but i only found Dodgers PoV  Edit: While no PoV from jesse was found, the last few minutes of the stream are Jesse at his saltiest https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ckXcWn0IJg#t=664s  I feel really sorry for what the girls probably went through during this game."

Shaboozey,2xece8,Zenopus,2,Sat Feb 28 10:18:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if no longer friends is applicable, they certainly stopped the co-dependent series after this and there's been no plans to continue ever since, but i'm not sure we could say the friendship is over, only Jesse and one of them would be able to confirm that, anything more is just speculation.  Maybe if you combed through Jesse's tumblr back when he had posts from June 2012 you might get his word on it.  Edit: this post made everything sound suspicious as fuck, what i meant is that both parties involved probably just moved on to do different things, it's been so long that i feel it would be a disservice to open such an old wound like that if there is any.  This Video by chiib seems to indicate there is no bad blood, it's a half a month later from the live stream, they probably just got too busy with other stuff and had to stop the series."

Shaboozey,2x5fr8,pumacatrun2,6,Thu Feb 26 12:38:40 2015 UTC,"Considering what Jesse did with the Greenlight after the Mattingly fiasco, there is a chance he may be replaced but I'm not sure about it and if so who. Greg announced on Twitter that him and Jirard are no longer friends, kind of indicating they are on somewhat bad terms in the least to be breaking up after 4 years of working together, so I doubt they'll be collaborating on any videos, TOVG or not. It's unfortunate, and I kind of feel that Jirard is being a little bit more professional about it, but just wait and see, hopefully the SGS can continue in some form at least. Thankfully it won't be affecting Multiplayer Mayhem, I look forward to that the most each week usually."

Shaboozey,2x5fr8,pumacatrun2,2,Thu Feb 26 05:56:01 2015 UTC,"Basically Josh Mattingly - the guy who used to be on the Greenlight with Jesse before Jared Rosen - harassed Zoe Quinn, a game dev, claiming to be drunk, blah blah blah sexism in the gaming journalism press, his reputation was tarnished and she got away as the victim despite the horrible things she has done with her own relationships etc. that have been covered up.  http://www.jforcegames.com/blog/index.php?itemid=333  Just google 'Josh Mattingly Zoe Quinn' if you want to find out more.  Jesse replaced him with Jared, it was Mattingly's decision to stop collaborating on the series, and all was forgotten."

Shaboozey,2x6ab6,Keneshiro,2,Thu Feb 26 02:26:10 2015 UTC,"she is in the lore but it really doesnt matter how you spec her cos artificer spec can work as a melee aswell but imo its better as ranged. same as blackwall, he is the best tank this game has cos of the champion spec but jesse uses him as a 2hander for some reason"
Shaboozey,2x6ab6,Axenor,1 point,Thu Feb 26 09:39:21 2015 UTC,I've been using him as dps as well since I had specced Cassy into tank by the time i met him. I am curious why Jesse gave Sera melee thp since she seems to get hit quite frequently. I personally have went one melee 3 ranged since I find the AI a bit dumb in melee and I can't be arsed to tactical mode it.
Shaboozey,2x6ab6,Keneshiro,2,Thu Feb 26 10:14:19 2015 UTC,"yeah the AI seems brain dead and using rogue as melee was almoast impossible even with tactical cam but after you get the masterwork ""guard on hit"" melee rogue rarely takes health damage anymore. jesse even mentioned that he made cole into ranged, i wonder why he flipped the roles. maybe he dont give em too much of a thought and made sera melee just cos he already had varric as ranged at the time"
Shaboozey,2x6ab6,Axenor,1 point,Thu Feb 26 10:23:54 2015 UTC,"True true. I can't put up with micro managing till I get the masterwork so unless they come with swords/daggers, all my companions become range."

Forge doesn't exist for 1.8 yet, which is to be expected considering the time that usually takes. and then there's sponge which a layer on top of forge that is itself unfinished, so that one will be a while too."

Think a reverse of the SPARTAN-II recruitment process from Halo; instead of a clone to make people think they're dead, a new clone with a lifespan of only a few hours is created for whenever he needs to be on camera.

Shaboozey,2vyj3p,Genoms,5,Sun Feb 15 09:18:17 2015 UTC,I'm thinking busy jesse upgraded in silence cause the man is busy and didn't have time to record and detail the upgrade process?

Shaboozey,2v07ea,shaboozeybot,4,Fri Feb 6 17:54:01 2015 UTC,I like the look and feel of the game but if it's just an endless series of that simplistic RNG combat system it seems like it would wear thin pretty quickly.
Shaboozey,2v07ea,Gryndyl,3,Fri Feb 6 22:08:42 2015 UTC,"Think the problem is the game doesn't really communicate that well what it was. It's not an action RPG that relies heavily on combat. It's simplistic, in a way rouge-like of old had simple combat mechanics with a little mix of turn based tactical mixed in (positioning matters a lot to determine who you can hit and what skills you can use), but the core of the game is the party and resources management.  You need to know when you can risk that one more room and when you should cut your losses and perhaps abandon the quest altogether just salvage as much as possible.   In the end tho, if you're not fan of older rouge-likes (ADOM, NetHack, Angband) you probably won't enjoy the game that much."
Shaboozey,2v07ea,SynthFei,2,Fri Feb 6 22:38:12 2015 UTC,"This game is so good. I normally don't buy early access, but it's getting some great reviews."
Shaboozey,2v07ea,BlueSapphyre,2,Fri Feb 6 18:13:25 2015 UTC,"Heads up. The game is very buggy right now. It's crashed almost as many times as I've played it.  I found a bug to save your characters after they die.  The balancing is way off (certain characters are way imbalanced, certain stages are near impossible with the enemies you face, lots of other issues).   But, if you can deal with all that, RNG and the frustration of permadeath and a big focus on resource management, then it's a really fun game.  (I like the game well enough. But, TB has a point. There are plenty of complete good games out there. If you want to get this game, you should be aware of what you're getting into.)"

Shaboozey,2udjnz,theseekerofbacon,1 point,Sun Feb 1 04:58:38 2015 UTC,"They played fairly well but they were more or less evenly matched until around 20:00, when the enemy team completely fucked up that 5-man core push at bottom.  Tychus got too ballsy and got picked off, then they started retreating in preparation for mines, but unfortunately the squishiest of them were in the back and both got picked off. It was all over after that, they were never all-5 up again afaik."
Shaboozey,2udjnz,Halefire,1 point,Sun Feb 1 06:22:43 2015 UTC,"Which makes sense if the comp of Jesse's team wasn't so thoroughly fucked. The other team should have pulled ahead really early and ran away with the game. But Jesse's team got unbelievably lucky.  They needed to the other team to be hopeless (which they were, if you watched the exp, Jesse's team was consistently ahead).  They needed to fuck up the objectives (even when they got a more powerful golem, they handled the situation wrong and Jesse's team was able to pull further ahead).  They needed to not know how to play (so Jesse's team could pick off their heroes one by one until march of the murlocks could do enough AOE to help even things out).  Jesse's team needed to know how to play (to overcome two healers, murky only good for pushing and the squishiness of Aba and Valla).  The only thing Jesse's team had going for them was Crendor cloning Valla and being able to do a bunch of burst damage. But, their focus on the objectives, the other team royally fucking up and bribe being the last piece of the puzzle, they pulled through.  TL;DR It was the perfect storm of ridiculousness.  (Disclaimer: I know next to nothing about the game. This is just stuff I picked up watching Jesse mine salt.)"

Shaboozey,2udjnz,Droggelbecher,2,Sun Feb 1 13:46:41 2015 UTC,"He's really weak, but fun to play. When you get killed as murky you only give the enemy team 25% hero xp instead of 100% like other heroes. It's basically a waste to even use talents on you, and just makes you annoying. Since he can place his egg anywhere and spawn from anywhere he can easily backdoor an enemy base.   He's a lot weaker than every hero in the game right now, but so fucking annoying to deal with. It takes a fair bit of skill to really be effective as him."

Shaboozey,2u6q4q,EgoPhoenix,1 point,Fri Jan 30 10:48:50 2015 UTC,It was probably a see-it-early type deal.  In which case you'll just have to wait for it to come out on the channel.
Shaboozey,2u6q4q,Starheaven07,-1,Fri Jan 30 18:27:18 2015 UTC,The Cox n' Crendor Youtube channel.

Shaboozey,2u6q4q,otto4242,1 point,Fri Jan 30 13:11:48 2015 UTC,"Well the PAX one said it was a pax exclusive, so I can imagine it won't show up on the regular channel for a while."

Shaboozey,2tresd,Xdeser2,2,Wed Jan 28 05:30:49 2015 UTC,"There were a fair number of proper questions and I think the ""polish sausage"" thing may have helped filter out a few extra awkward moments."

Shaboozey,2tresd,JakeRay,7,Tue Jan 27 12:16:32 2015 UTC,It's not. The people that ask those kinda questions aren't usually the most social butterflies.

Shaboozey,2trtfu,HylianSamurai,2,Tue Jan 27 04:05:09 2015 UTC,"However, the game's atmosphere was perfect by always keeping you on edge; the best I've seen since P.T."

Shaboozey,2trtfu,HylianSamurai,3,Tue Jan 27 03:58:13 2015 UTC,"I imagine it'd difficult because, unlike regular series where they can film short segments, they have to find the time to get drunk and play through most/all of a game in single sittings.  Between trying to schedule it, finding the right game and making it actually watchable is going to slow the roll of the series.  And that's fine. It's better than becoming pewdiepie.  Though, when silent hills comes out, I'll be fighting for the first spot in line to hear Davis literally pee himself...  That was an incredibly odd thing to write."
Shaboozey,2trtfu,theseekerofbacon,1 point,Tue Jan 27 18:01:08 2015 UTC,What's wrong with getting drunk and recording a little every day? :p

I can't imagine them playing anything more complex than this when this game was almost too hard for them.  edit: bring it fanboys, sorry i find super drunk people to be obnoxious"
Shaboozey,2trtfu,shiny_dunsparce,5,Tue Jan 27 07:11:35 2015 UTC,"Don't use the downvote button as a way to disagree, people."
Shaboozey,2trtfu,TimeLordPony,3,Tue Jan 27 21:49:09 2015 UTC,"In their defense, the game is incredibly dimly lit. So not only is footage of the ending half of the game lousy, playing it is significantly harder. If I played for 4-6 hours to get that ending, or the ending it originally had, and I wasn't drunk, I'd be pissed"
Shaboozey,2tnqu4,Kazzran,6,Sun Jan 25 22:44:26 2015 UTC,"Oh god, half the the questions are cringe worthy and so awkward."

Some of these guys sounded older one was even in college and were just asking random stupid questions trying so hard to be funny like ""how do I stop my friend being hungry"" or ""How do i get drunk"" something along those lines. Think Jesse and Crendor were good sports about it all but it was cringy."

It's the type of pathetic otaku-weaboo thing that throws up so many cringe moments one after the other that you feel compelled to write them down into a giant list of failure.

Shaboozey,2tjphn,Industrialbonecraft,-9,Sat Jan 31 08:16:23 2015 UTC,Mostly this makes me want to find whoever wrote the scripts for that game and garotte them.  Slowly.

Shaboozey,2thke6,Crudelita5,3,Sat Jan 24 10:05:24 2015 UTC,"In case of a big ""YT Crash"" only his corporation would be going under, some goes for liability. The company basically is ""armor"" against the bad sides of being a bigger YT'er"
Shaboozey,2thke6,thesirblondie,4,Sat Jan 24 12:30:01 2015 UTC,"Who calls a podcast ""One of iTunes' to watch""?   Someone who works at PAX? Alternatively Jesse or Crendor (in case they wrote it). It just means its one to look out for, if you haven't heard of it yet.   And the animated shorts are just kind of an aside. The podcast is the main attraction, no?   The animated videos have several hundred thousands of views each. The podcast usually reaches 50k-100k listens each. I'd say the animated videos are a major staple."
Shaboozey,2thke6,thesirblondie,1 point,Sat Jan 24 08:29:39 2015 UTC,Huh. Always assumed the podcast was bigger.
Shaboozey,2thke6,thesirblondie,1 point,Sat Jan 24 15:01:46 2015 UTC,"Well, we're talking 50-100k 15 times a month (750k-1500k monthly) to 250-600k once a week (1000-2400k monthly). But since Danny has been busy for the last few months with life, there hasn't been much in the times of animations. The podcast is without a doubt the main attraction, but dismissing the animations as ""just a sideproject"" would be to undermine the success and popularity of the animations."
Shaboozey,2thke6,Keneshiro,1 point,Sun Jan 25 01:43:36 2015 UTC,Yeah podcast is definitely the main attraction I just never saw the animations as as big as they are. That's super cool! I wonder how Danny feels about his sudden magical success.

Shaboozey,2tdapm,KingGorm272,7,Fri Jan 23 09:20:32 2015 UTC,The spoopy figure was in view a good half a dozen times before they noticed. It was driving me up a wall.
Shaboozey,2tdapm,Holybasil,2,Fri Jan 23 10:27:39 2015 UTC,"I actually liked that they didn't notice. I found it weirdly enjoyable in the same way as when you're watching a horror film and you spot the gribbly unspeakable monster stalking the victim character. At first you're scared, then you're sitting there grinning while waiting for the penny to drop and the shit to hit the fan.  Which it did. Beautifully."
Shaboozey,2tdapm,bitscreed,2,Fri Jan 23 20:31:28 2015 UTC,"Well they are pretty drunk. Hell, I didn't even notice the figure till you mentioned it, to be totally honest."

Shaboozey,2sktdp,Clayor,2,Mon Jan 19 20:55:22 2015 UTC,"I was interested to see if the game have better or worse parkour than Mirrors Edge, bad parkour could really sink the game. As far as I can see it doesn't look as fluid and quick but not by much, and that may just depend on the player and the players experience with the system.    So it looks good enough at least and the general game look decent as well.   And a big plus that the melee weapons actually react when hitting something instead of making a sound a mysteriously passing through the object being hit."
Shaboozey,2sktdp,Sasamus,2,Fri Jan 16 14:08:33 2015 UTC,"I watched a little of a developer stream a while back and it looks like there are skill points you can put into parkour, so hopefully it gets more interesting the more time you put in. The skills I saw were takedown moves, but there's probably some for faster climbing or higher jumping in there. Plus one other pretty cool skill :p"

Far Cry 4 and DAI are both incredibly long games and I'm personally not one to watch playthroughs of games that encourage you to create your own story (since I'd rather make my own). Because of that there's definitely been a dearth of watchable content on Jesse's channel for me in the last...long while.   The video of Depth was somethin' else though, I must say."
Shaboozey,2s1i31,Halefire,2,Sun Jan 11 09:17:09 2015 UTC,well these kinds of playthroughs are the bread and butter of jesses channel cos he enjoys them alot and that is fun to watch. nothing wrong with just watching fan fridays tho if that is more of your thing
Shaboozey,2s1i31,Axenor,1 point,Sun Jan 11 16:33:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if he wants to hit the year of the million, he's be better served having one long lets play going on at a time and focusing more on series like SGS, Greenlight and Multiplayer mayhem.  Shorter and more reliably entertaining series will do well to bring in and hold on to more casual viewers while the single long play will be great for the longer term more dedicated viewers."

Shaboozey,2rfcsy,BlueSapphyre,-9,Mon Jan 5 19:10:58 2015 UTC,"since everything is now greenlit through steam   Wrong, there's at least 1920 games that are waiting to be released."

Shaboozey,2rfcsy,paszklar,2,Mon Jan 5 19:58:33 2015 UTC,"First of 1920 games on the waiting list doesn't mean any of them are any good. Some probably are, but there is a lot of crap out there.  Secondly, it's not like they didn't greenlight, what was it, like 500+ games in one batch last month. It's not very difficult to get throught the process nowadays (and it's more based on luck than anything else). As it was said in the first video after the reboot, in the past, more often than not, when the video was out, the game would already be out of greenlight. Because of how randomly valve approves games, there isn't much point to limiting yourself to the games on the waiting list.  All in all, the problem isn't with Greenlight the show, but with Greenlight the valve program. At this point imho valve is just letting it die while they are probably working on a way to let anyone publish on steam, rendering greenlight obsolete.  Now, in the current format, the show can cover any good indie game, but there is nothing preventing them from showcasing games that ARE on greenlight  Edit: Sorry, replied to the wrong post - it was meant for the parent comment - but whatever, you hopefully get my point."

Here's hoping it's just a busy phase for him and they'll get back to trying to fulfill the promises. As much as I love those guys it kind of leaves a bad taste if they keep going how it's currently going.

It's hard to make a proper analysis when you're not stating the settings you play on, are you implying that you get bad fps even with lowest settings available? Looking at your setup I'd say you should be able to run medium settings just fine, maybe your harddrive is to blame? As the steam page claims ""System Requirements: Requires file system support for files up to 8 GB"", now I'm not completely sure, but if you don't have said file system then maybe that can be a cause to the extreme FPS problems you describe?"

Each show they have is completely different though so not everything is going to appeal to everyone.  Either way, there's no sense in being worried about them having sole creative control or anything like that considering how the channel has gone so far (each show being so different and catering to whoever is hosting that particular show)."

Shaboozey,2q1mie,JohnnyValet,4,Mon Dec 22 06:02:31 2014 UTC,Stealth is super overpowered in that game. I've cleared out fortresses stealth only.
Shaboozey,2q1mie,etree,2,Mon Dec 22 14:20:35 2014 UTC,"Stealth is ridiculously easy in Shadows of Mordor, but it's very annoying that the game forces you to play each mission a specific way through the whole thing."
Shaboozey,2q1mie,Archaic44,4,Mon Dec 22 14:50:32 2014 UTC,"While I enjoy the added challenge of completing something in a way outside of your comfort zone, instant fail states ruin a game's feeling of freedom.   What I've been saying is that this game needs a sandbox mode. Allow all powers to be unlocked without missions, give us both maps, and unlock warlords. I would even be okay if this were only available after beating the main campaign."
Shaboozey,2q1mie,Zahnan,2,Mon Dec 22 17:57:47 2014 UTC,I definitely agree. The game felt like a really long tutorial that sets up some good mechanics. The game could be a lot more with much more replay value if they kept expanding on the army mind control functions.  Things like graug riding hardly get used after the one mission and mind controlling feels weak. It only controls a few specific orcs around the leaders you have so it's not really building an army but rather a large squad.
Shaboozey,2q1mie,Archaic44,2,Mon Dec 22 18:34:35 2014 UTC,"I actually avoided the main story so long that I accidentally made myself virtually immortal without ever getting the mind control power. I still haven't beaten the game 30 hours in.   For me, the soul of the game came from my arch nemesis, Ugakuga The Reckless. Early on I accidentally died in a fight, and promoted a bunch of captains. Still angry about the fight, I charged back and tried to kill them multiple times. Most of them died, but one learned all my moves, and became a max level anti-hero. For days he would thwart all my plans; even ones he had nothing to do with. It became my only goal to eliminate him. I cut through a hundred orc captains on my quest to attain the power that would send him back to the earth in which spawned.  One day on personal mission where I was promoting the weakest captains so I could eliminate the warlords easier, an alarm sounded. In the chaos, one voice rung through. The pale orc that haunted me. But what was this? He only brought two orc with him, and he was around the side of a building?! I antagonized him, and drew him away from his army, and finally put a wraith arrow through his skull.   Bloodied, and weakened, I stood over his body in disbelief. I had won, but there were no trumpets, no cheers. Just silence and cries from distant slaves.  That was the real story of the game. It was only later I learned that if their body is laying down in the Army tab that they can come back..."
Shaboozey,2q1mie,Zahnan,2,Mon Dec 22 18:58:38 2014 UTC,That's cool you managed to create such a powerful nemesis but did you try all of your moves on them? usually if nothing else works you can just blow them up by luring them from fire to fire until they try to run.
Shaboozey,2q1mie,Archaic44,3,Mon Dec 22 19:48:49 2014 UTC,"That's cool you managed to create such a powerful nemesis but did you try all of your moves on them? usually if nothing else works you can just blow them up by luring them from fire to fire until they try to run.   I did! But I was focused on melee at the time, and he became completely resistant to all forms of melee attacks. I tried to lead him into a fire, but even with that, and all my arrows, I was no match for him. He almost never traveled without a pack of orc, so I could hardly ever even get close enough to leave a mark. He was a warlord without the title. He was stronger than any Warlord too."
Shaboozey,2q1mie,Zahnan,2,Mon Dec 22 19:55:59 2014 UTC,That's pretty brutal. Congrats on the revenge!
Shaboozey,2q1mie,Archaic44,1 point,Mon Dec 22 19:57:36 2014 UTC,"I ran into an captain that was immune to literally everything.  The only way I could damage him was to wraith flurry him.  But only the attacks leading to the wraith flurry finisher because that counted as a melee finisher.  Took a little while, but I got him down low enough to mind control.  Strongest warlord ever."

Shaboozey,2q1mie,Zahnan,1 point,Tue Dec 23 01:47:13 2014 UTC,"The one I have has most of the same things, but is immune to ranged attacks.  Fire can still hurt him though.  He didn't get enraged by anything, He didn't have deadly or backlash, but he did have a poison weapon and No Chance."

Shaboozey,2p8v5a,zzyster,2,Sun Dec 14 16:00:30 2014 UTC,For me I enjoy the Far Cry videos but have found the Dragon Age vids quite boring. They felt too repetitive to me. I'm sure if I were playing the game myself I might enjoy DA:I but watching it just doesn't work for me while there's enough variety in the FC4 vids to keep me interested. So I'm with the original poster in wishing he did more FC4 vids.

Shaboozey,2oputr,Hasaki-,3,Tue Dec 9 17:59:50 2014 UTC,"Dang. Didn't think about that.   We might have a movie plot here: the idea of creating sentient mini-being inside my head out of sheer will power, then feeling that being's misery as it realizes it was only meant to be a duplicate of someone else. Then it slowly spirals into depression, and wants only to die, but can't because it's trapped inside my head and the only way it can die is if I die. So it starts sending subliminal messages for me to kill myself, and I almost do. Then Guy Hero saves me somehow. The End."

The schizophrenia thing is a really common issue and there is a very good post that we usually refer to when people bring it up and really it should be on the sidebar (if it had been Jesse and Crendor would probably have seen it) but anyway, if we get this done I'll email it to Crendor, I mean I'm fine for them to take the piss out of us, hell it was funny and I laughed, but I just would rather not have an unhealthy portrayal of our community, we don't really deserve it."

Shaboozey,2npefp,Caridor,5,Fri Nov 28 22:28:32 2014 UTC,Keep in mind its total reviews are less than 600. Thats not enough to have a real accurate assessment imo. Compare that to Agarest's over 1000 reviews and ofc itll be skewed.
Shaboozey,2npefp,Rasral123,1 point,Sat Nov 29 04:04:59 2014 UTC,"Agreed, but if we want to look at a ratio, Agarest has a positive to negative ratio of around 4:1, (Rounded up from 3.61) while Freedom Planet has about 78:1. (Rounded up from 77.78) Having double approximately double the number of reviews (551 vs 1057) wouldn't really make up for that disparity.  Anyways, voting is over I think, being nearly 2am PST and FP has 57% of the vote."
Shaboozey,2npefp,Rurdet,2,Sat Nov 29 09:41:03 2014 UTC,Didn't even know about this but I'll definitely be voting for Freedom Planet- entirely of my own choosing as well!

Shaboozey,2npefp,theseekerofbacon,2,Sat Nov 29 12:50:26 2014 UTC,"I'll give an opinion. Jesse's time on stream is going to be fairly limited. My guess that between the anime RPG game and the sonic style game, the anime RPG game is more likely to have a long, drawn out and unswappable intro. It'll probably start out really slow too.  So, do everyone a favor, for an interesting stream, set up Jesse for what's eventually going to be a giant fail fest with the sonic game.  Because, we all know what's going to happen. Jesse's going to get too carried away talking to the GOG guys/the audience/telling a story and miss out on a game mechanic, mess up constantly due to the lack of the game mechanic and possibly flip out over his frustration. And we'll all love it way more than just sitting around reading text and probably getting bored.  Edit: Just realized that I made this comment really late and the straw poll is closed.

Shaboozey,2n5a6j,patdkkm8,2,Sun Nov 23 10:03:44 2014 UTC,I'd be okay with that.
Shaboozey,2n5a6j,Doozerpindan,5,Sun Nov 23 11:37:53 2014 UTC,No...no more Evan Williams?
Shaboozey,2n5a6j,otwem,2,Sun Nov 23 14:17:00 2014 UTC,"I hope whatever they play it stays below 10 parts. I just cant keep watching a 40+ episode series. A 3-hour one-off, though, would be amazing."
Shaboozey,2n5a6j,BrandenKP,2,Sun Nov 23 19:44:12 2014 UTC,Fatal Frame was only 22 parts. That's not ridiculously long. I kept pace throughout the series and didn't grow bored or burnt out at all.
Shaboozey,2n5a6j,BrandenKP,1 point,Sun Nov 23 20:19:00 2014 UTC,"To each their own, but there is a marked drop in viewership the longer that series went on."
Shaboozey,2n5a6j,BrandenKP,2,Sun Nov 23 20:22:59 2014 UTC,That is with almost every Let's Play series on YouTube. People begin things but drop off later.
Shaboozey,2n5a6j,BrandenKP,-1,Sun Nov 23 20:38:50 2014 UTC,"EXACTLY! You prove my point! The majority of people find things boring the longer they go on. I wasn't trying to say Fatal Frame was special, just that it's not a good idea to have it trail on for a while, and that people will have more enjoyment out of a one-off in the vein of Greenlight than they will with a series about one game."
Shaboozey,2n5a6j,fincbdrummer,2,Sun Nov 23 21:04:27 2014 UTC,"Well then you're asking to change his content drastically, which would alienate a lot of his viewers and fanbase."
Shaboozey,2n5a6j,BlueSapphyre,-2,Sun Nov 23 21:43:26 2014 UTC,"What?  What I'm saying is to use common sense, and then my own opinion. What he does is what he does. What would be optimal is fewer episodes, and longer episodes, because the more episodes you add the less view you get per. There's some algebra that could be done to figure out the optimum ratio, but it's really down to whatever works for him. My bias is that I love marathon episodes, not shorter, more serial ones."
Shaboozey,2n5a6j,Zahnan,3,Sun Nov 23 22:12:24 2014 UTC,"Well, that makes no sense revenue-wise. Unless he gets triple the views of a normal episode on a longer episode that could be split in three normals, there's no way that can be lucrative. Besides, I think it's safe to assume based on the average length of a youtube let's play's episode, most people gravitate towards the optimum length between 10-20 minutes, making Jesse's stuff already on the lengthier side."

Shaboozey,2mta75,frimen,6,Wed Nov 19 22:43:14 2014 UTC,the brightness filter on the video thumbnails causing the extension to use ~190mbyte of memory after like 10 hover cycles. it would use ~60mbyte without the brightness filter.  i would recommend using opacity transition like this: http://imgur.com/8cicN6B (i've unticked your lines)  this way it isn't even reaching ~80mbyte. put the thumbnails into a simple wrapper div with black background and you will get the same dark effect you have now.  the height transformation on the video containers causing a lot of repaints and can not be hardware accelerated. it might worth figuring out a different animation using translate transformations instead of height. maybe like a collapsed credit card thing.  nice jesse ascii art though :D

Shaboozey,2mr5ik,Keneshiro,3,Wed Nov 19 16:04:58 2014 UTC,That obnoxious doodleydee noise near the end is the Origin achievement noise. In order to kill it go into your Origin/sounds folder and rename achievement.wav

Shaboozey,2mlzrn,Waytofind,9,Mon Nov 17 23:41:39 2014 UTC,"Further explanation from TB:   source: http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sih2ra   So this is about Co-optional Animated. Our animated was being funded by Polaris to make the videos and he was being paid reasonably well as a loss-leader for the channel, since Polaris takes a percentage of everyones earnings and in theory anyway is supposed to reinvest some of that into content. Now that he's off the Polaris channel the funding isn't there anymore, but many people have expressed the desire for the animated shows to continue.   I'm going to be funding him on a per episode basis for $200 each and he is looking to viewers to see if the rest can be made up with Patreon crowd-funding. Ideally, this will only be a temporary solution. If the animated series does well and we are able to make it commercially viable with things like merchandise sales, I should be able to fund the whole thing myself and Patreon funding will no longer be required.   The animators Patreon page can be found here if you wish to contribute - http://www.patreon.com/cooptionalanimation - Animation on Youtube is unfortunately difficult to monetize well, due to Youtubes annoying tendency to give lower CPMs based on lower run-times, which is why you see so many animators using the Patreon model to fund regular episodes. Hopefully things will work out and it won't be necessary to do it forever, but I'd like to see this guy get paid a reasonable amount for what is a lot of work per episode. Thanks for reading."
Shaboozey,2mlzrn,Rurdet,3,Mon Nov 17 23:41:53 2014 UTC,Now that he's off the Polaris channel   I haven't kept up with much news when it comes to meta-channel affairs. What's the reasoning for this?
Shaboozey,2mlzrn,Enlightnd,3,Tue Nov 18 04:54:35 2014 UTC,Podcast was taken of Chanel by TB. So no more animations needed I guess.
Shaboozey,2mlzrn,uhohimdead,3,Tue Nov 18 07:16:54 2014 UTC,Just gave $5. love the animation and would like to see them continue.

Shaboozey,2m1jv8,Enlightnd,2,Wed Nov 12 15:18:26 2014 UTC,I learned about this now and started watching today (got weeks one and 2 in so yeah I watched a lot). I only have one problem and that is that so far JP being the host seemed the least interested in what's happening most of the time.  Otherwise I like the setting so much I think I'm gonna run a campaign of this when we are on a break from our Pathfinder campaign with my friends. (DM needs a break from DMing every now and then so we do a few weeks of another game).

Can't remember if it was a sponsored event or a public one.. But jesse is usually good at disclosing sponsor-stuff, so if it was sponsored, i imagine he'd written or said so somewhere.

It was a simple observation, that usually when a game is that close to release, the publisher sends out preview copies or invites lots of journalists to events.  Bioware or EA seem to try something different by having preview streams of their game on twitch and trying to control the flow of information before the game is released."
Shaboozey,2kzrm8,thesirblondie,1 point,Sun Nov 2 00:34:56 2014 UTC,"Interesting that they single out Jesse when the Beard Bros. had access at the same time, most likely because they're friends with WillofDC."

Shaboozey,2kcv2a,HylianSamurai,2,Sun Oct 26 21:12:33 2014 UTC,"It does not seem like it will be limited, they have talked about other scary games, plus they have already recognize P.T let's play to be kinda of a pilot for the SGS serie, so hopefully they'll get going.  Personally i really want to see them play the amnesia, i know it is a go-to game for scary videos but having Davis meet the invisible monster while drunk, i believe, is priceless."

An upatched one at that as far as I can tell looking at the game.  Either way, he's limited to 12 days. But, I'm sure as hell on board for a full let's play of this when it finally comes out next month. Hell, stuff might clear up enough for him to actually do it at that point."

Shaboozey,2k84i3,ThomasGeek,2,Fri Oct 24 23:49:55 2014 UTC,"I think the idea is interested in concept, but part of it seems counterintuitive to me. The embedded twitch player is an odd choice. I would have assumed that clicking the banner would open the twitch channel in a new tab instead of that dropdown window. Keeping that window open for the rest of a (multi hour) stream seems like an unlikely use-case scenario and if it's merely to preview the stream, clicking on the banner to open a new twitch tab seems like more logical choice. I'm making some possibly incorrect assumptions here about how you've put this thing together, please don't be cross if I got something wrong.  Some questions: Are you using Chrome's notification API to notify users of new videos and when the stream is live, or is it just the little exclamation mark/T next to the button? Also, I'm curious; do you check for new content by connecting to the Youtube/Twitch APIs in the background, are you scraping webpages or something else?    Other than that, I think it looks pretty good. Hope you keep working on it. :)"
Shaboozey,2k84i3,ChineseArts,1 point,Sat Oct 25 00:33:59 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the feedback on this! With the embedded twitch player, the idea behind it was to let the people preview the stream without closing the window they were currently working on Chrome, so they could see if it's something they want to watch. From there you can click on a link that takes you to it.    But yes, at first it was just the banner and clicking on it would take you straight to the stream, hovering your mouse over it would open a smaller box that would show the stream, like so in this older version: http://puu.sh/cco2k/6e3ee8e971.jpg (don't mind the stream title text, it scrolls horizontally)  I'm not using Chrome's notification API, I was actually looking into it if it was something I should use to notify the person as well. At the moment it's just a chrome badge that switches between ""!"" and ""T"" depending on if new videos are on or the twitch stream is live so people who are constantly surfing on the web, or have facebook open on their second monitor when they are playing games, can see the badge, it should be fairly easy to notice but if I can improve upon that, I will.  I check content by using YouTube's version 2 API because version 3 is kind of... bad, at least in my opinion. Same with twitch, they are just simple json pages that you can pull information from, anybody has access to them.   Thank you very much for the feedback, very much appreciated.(:"

The office, in one form or another, is older than both the United States Constitution and the United States Declaration of Independence. Benjamin Franklin was appointed by the Continental Congress as the first Postmaster General in 1775, serving slightly longer than 15 months.  Until 1971, the postmaster general was the head of the Post Office Department (or simply ""Post Office"" until the 1820s).  From 1829 to 1971, he was a member of the President's Cabinet.  The Cabinet post of Postmaster General was often given to a new President's campaign manager or other key political supporter, and was considered something of a sinecure. The Postmaster General was in charge of the governing party's patronage, and was a powerful position which held much influence within the party.    Image i     Interesting: Albert S.

You can hold the Dodge button to immediately run instead of having to wait like 2-3 seconds until the character automatically starts running. The materials and weapons that you don't manually collect on the battlefield are collected automatically after the battle. The one thing you have to remember though is that there can only be 20 dropped items on the battefield at any given time. If more than that drop, then the ones who dropped first will disappear. This essentially means that you shouldn't go out of your way just to collect something. As long as you ignore only some of the items (i.e. less than 20), you will get them after the battle anyway."

Shaboozey,2jc8k0,thesirblondie,1 point,Wed Oct 15 18:56:21 2014 UTC,"Well sometimes even when steamers use content they have gotten permission to use, the automated system claims that it is illegal (sometimes because it doesn't know, and other times because random people claim copyright for tracks that they did not make, or own), and then the system says, yep you don't own that, what's worse is that is doesn't just take the time in which the track plays, imagine a 1,5 minute track used illegally, that will sometimes claim up to (or more) 30 minutes of the video, for no friggin reason...   The automated copyright strike system, is somewhat flawed one might argue :c"

Shaboozey,2is87z,shaboozeybot,5,Thu Oct 9 18:56:58 2014 UTC,"I guess it's unavoidable that he has had to do this voice over since he didn't have a mic there. Loving the fact that he can talk over it with footage though, instead of just talking about it on the podcast.  Also, I am really pleased with the front message about him being sponsored to the event. Honestly, I think Jesse does it best with stuff like this.  Side note: Never did I expect to see Jesse on /r/Games . I WOULD like to hear more negatives on the game by him aside from the story though. But then again, they might been limited to a few things only."
Shaboozey,2is87z,Keneshiro,3,Fri Oct 10 01:14:03 2014 UTC,"Normally like Jesse, but voicing over pre-recorded footage (even if it is him playing) from a press event? No thanks..."
Shaboozey,2is87z,JDGumby,2,Thu Oct 9 19:58:23 2014 UTC,I agree but at the same time I wanted to see the footage and since he had no mic there this was the only possible solution no?
Shaboozey,2is87z,bawhee,-7,Thu Oct 9 23:41:01 2014 UTC,"Well, lets see. I got around 50 bucks for a RPG like this in my personal budget.

Shaboozey,2is87z,Antrix32,2,Thu Oct 9 19:33:26 2014 UTC,can deliver a story without underpants sex   The Witcher doesn't really handle sex any better than DA:O or 2 did aside from actually having nudity. The only sex scene that really felt appropriate to the story was the one (spoiler) with triss in the pool.
Shaboozey,2is87z,Riversz,1 point,Fri Oct 10 22:55:12 2014 UTC,"Although I like the Witcher stories as well as the people behind it, I will not pay full price for an RPG where I can't play as female or customize my character's appearance at all.  OT: I wonder how the interface will be on PC, namely the inventory/equipment screen I hope will be completely remade for mouse/keyboard and that 'finding hidden items' mechanic seems like it needs to be presented differently too. Other than that I am enthusiastic about the game and this video has made me more enthusiastic yet again."
Shaboozey,2is87z,Dazbuzz,1 point,Fri Oct 10 10:32:59 2014 UTC,The whole point of The Witcher is to play as Geralt. Why on earth would you expect to be able to customise your character?
Shaboozey,2is87z,Antrix32,0,Fri Oct 10 12:05:28 2014 UTC,"I can see where they are coming from. The witcher is all about geralt and I personally am fine with that, but customizing a character has been a fundamental part of western RPG's since they started..I can see why not having it available would be disappointing."

Shaboozey,2iqksy,Keneshiro,3,Thu Oct 9 14:41:08 2014 UTC,A fair chunk of people tend to find games that need fluidity rather than precision are better suited to controllers.
Shaboozey,2iqksy,aztech101,1 point,Thu Oct 9 15:25:11 2014 UTC,"Really? I'm surprised. Then again, I've rarely used a controller so my idea of fluidity is somewhat skewed"
Shaboozey,2iqksy,Keneshiro,2,Thu Oct 9 16:25:50 2014 UTC,"As someone who has tried to play Shadows of Mordor, Assassins Creed, and Batman Arkham games with Kb+M and a controller, a controller is definitely better for maintaining combos and fluidity.   ...now, I'll use Kb+M for FPSes all day long, because precision is important there."
Shaboozey,2iqksy,TacticalBacon00,2,Thu Oct 9 17:41:24 2014 UTC,Interesting. I tried AC with a controller and I was horrible at it. Even my friend who was watching over my shoulder was confused about it as well
Shaboozey,2iqksy,Keneshiro,1 point,Thu Oct 9 18:29:11 2014 UTC,"Eh, some things work better for different people. That's one of the best things about PC gaming, you have so many options.

Shaboozey,2iqksy,Keneshiro,2,Thu Oct 9 18:34:11 2014 UTC,I'm guessing that (besides the arrow portions) the joystick gives you better control of the character than using WASD. Kind of like how racing games are objectively better with a control.
Shaboozey,2iqksy,theseekerofbacon,0,Thu Oct 9 17:12:14 2014 UTC,Rotating the mouse moves the direction you are facing.  I find the Kb+M combination excellent for this game.
Shaboozey,2iqksy,5_lbs_of_Bacon,0,Thu Oct 9 18:08:37 2014 UTC,"I never said it was bad. But, the controller probably ends up being more comfortable, easier to learn and probably a bit more responsive. Moving the joystick at those intermediate angles is probably easier in combat than working with the 8 directions that are options with WASD and adding in mouse control.  Shooting with the arrows will always be better with mouse and keyboard. But, it's not even remotely surprising that as many people find the control a better device for the rest of the gameplay."

Shaboozey,2ifeci,shaboozeybot,15,Mon Oct 6 06:53:05 2014 UTC,They get $4000+ monthly to release at most 2 episodes a week.
Shaboozey,2ifeci,Moaz13,7,Mon Oct 6 19:23:12 2014 UTC,"Yeah I would not be pleased if I had donated for this, at $500 they said it would be enough to work on it full time and they got 8x that amount and somewhere Jesse said they would do at least 15 a month, hopefully they will or have explained to the donators why they haven't been releasing these more regularly."
Shaboozey,2ifeci,vradar,3,Mon Oct 6 20:25:56 2014 UTC,"At first they said 20, but they quickly backpedaled that."
Shaboozey,2ifeci,Reddickk,5,Mon Oct 6 21:47:28 2014 UTC,"The (reasonable) excuse used to be ""We don't get paid for it, so because of all the other things we do that we get paid for take so much time, we can't do it that often"", but now it's ""We don't have time to do it because of all the other things we do that pay us, but we are going to take money for not doing it anyway."" It's becoming scummy. In one Jesse said 15 a month.  Here are the counts since they started taking Patreon money,   August: 1 September: 6 October: 1 (in 8 days, so on pace for 4 this month)"
Shaboozey,2ifeci,DampBritches,3,Thu Oct 9 00:57:48 2014 UTC,"For as much as Jesse preached about not wanting to take our money, this seems like a really douchy move on his part.  They made promises that they aren't even seemingly trying to keep, and have raked in a bunch of extra cash for it.  They have made roughly $500+ for each episode they have done so far. I know they need to be able to make some income off of doing it, that's all fine and dandy. But I know they aren't losing that much money from taking time out of doing their YouTube thing, to make these.  Taking advantage of your fanbase is not fucking cool guys.  And am I the only one who feels like the podcast is less entertaining now?  There have been a couple of good ones, but in general it just seems like they have a ""lets gets this over with"" attitude about it."
Shaboozey,2ifeci,Lightsworn_Redditor,3,Thu Oct 16 23:39:18 2014 UTC,"I'm holding on, giving them time to get in to routine, but if it's less frequent by Nov I might just pull out my donation completely. I love this podcast more than most I listen to but the posting schedule isn't worth the $5 I'm paying."
Shaboozey,2ifeci,haloshade,4,Tue Oct 7 02:25:43 2014 UTC,"Could be worse, Kurt the guy who does Farlands or Bust launched a Patreon a few months ago and has yet to do either a vlog or podcast as promised."
Shaboozey,2ifeci,nopeitsnotme,3,Tue Oct 7 09:42:21 2014 UTC,"So fulfilling every other goal promises and actively preparing for vlog and podcast goals by planning carefully and publicly in his videos, launching the vlog channel and purchasing audio and video equipment for both is worse than this? I am willing to give Cox and Crendog time to get into motion but saying that they are doing better than Kurt is not really something anybody should say."
Shaboozey,2ifeci,Mademies,4,Tue Oct 7 12:56:29 2014 UTC,"In 2 and a half months, they have made 8 podcasts, and they have taken in about $4k a month.  That averages out to over $1,000 per 30 minute podcast so far.  Less than 1 a week."
Shaboozey,2ifeci,DampBritches,1 point,Thu Oct 9 00:53:55 2014 UTC,"First off, they need to get the schedule together. People  kind of demanded drunk scary games and multiplayer mayhem. So that takes up a bunch of time, he just started two new lets plays and he's in the middle of getting learning curve off the ground, green light back on track and hopefully sprinkle in some fan fridays.  I'm not sure what Crendor is up to. But, I'm sure the time difference doesn't help. I'm sure when they set the goal they didn't foresee so much stuff falling on Jesse's lap all of a sudden. I mean, sure they shouldn't have promised that many episodes. But, you do have to keep in mind that there's been a shit ton of stuff Jesse's been working on/catching up with after his long convention season.  Once it all settles down, then the podcast should find it's rhythm."

Jesse does not get paid beforehand by the viewers to make that stuff, but he and Crendor do get paid by the viewers to make those morning shows. There's the difference and its a clear difference. These morning show should in principle come before everything else.  I don't know if Patreon has a refund feature, but i think that would be the fair thing to do. I mean the 500$ milestone description includes ""...the show would be able to be supportive enough for us to work on it full time"" and we are sitting at over 4000$ right now.  They probably should have gotten back to the rhythm of making these episodes daily and only after that launched the Patreon campaign.  People who support this campaign should really let Jesse and Crendor hear about this. Anyhow, rant over! Lets hope they get to that rhythm."
Shaboozey,2ifeci,Juhzor,1 point,Thu Oct 16 19:16:34 2014 UTC,"Lets be honest the podcast isn't high quality, it doesn't require much more than setting a time to do it then spending 30 minutes at most searching for random stories to talk about for a 30 minute show so an hour a day lets say.  Considering they are getting $2k a month each for it I'm sure that's a lot more than they would get for a random promotional deal from polaris or a dev so really should have a higher priority especially when it takes so little time."
Shaboozey,2ifeci,vradar,2,Tue Oct 7 21:46:12 2014 UTC,"Recording it doesn't take too much time. Browsing reddit for a couple stories probably doesn't take too much time. But, we don't know what goes into the prep (getting the call together, checking equipment, sound equalization), the post (editing, encoding, uploading) and whatever else goes on that we don't know about. What people assume takes 40 minutes to put together might take 2-4 hours to do. And that's if they can find the time that works for both to even record (keep in mind that crendor goes to bed around 6 am pacific so is probably asleep in the morning when Jesse might have time to do the podcast).  And he's not dealing with just polaris deals. Seriously, besides speed runners (which was a convention deal) and the smite thing, what other deals has he done? They're not very common.   His big things now are two full series that people have been pestering him to do and a full show on geek and sundary that can actually really help his career and exposure.   He literally had to spend three days at Disney filming everything taking away time from his lets plays, other series and even the podcast which he had to make up for after he got back. Not to mention that he's probably going to be called back for re-dos regularly over the course of editing the show.  If it was 6 months ago, then sure, I'd say he really didn't have much excuse. But, right now the guy's working his ass off for the entertainment of his audience. Something has to give.   But, I agree it shouldn't be the thing that they're receiving 4 grand a month for. He shouldn't have promised as much (once or twice a week would have been enough to make everyone happy). But, the guy isn't just walking away with everyone's money while laughing away and ignoring everyone. He's busy.   When it calms down, the podcast will probably find it's rhythm and schedule and everyone's going to forget about this.  Either way, the first couple of months back were bound to be rocky anyways while they were figuring out their schedule.  I say, give them some time. If you contributed, stop if you don't think they're going to deliver. But, to jump down his throat because he hasn't found a way to add extra hours to the day kind of being the best possible example of how entitled people are on the internet.  Expecting something and being disappointed it isn't being delivered is fine. Expecting him to stop other obligations without any sense of what he's actually dealing with accomplishes nothing but make the guy feel like shit when he's already disappointed in himself as is."
Shaboozey,2ifeci,theseekerofbacon,3,Tue Oct 7 23:39:53 2014 UTC,Then they shouldn't have taken money to do it until they were ready to actually do it.
Shaboozey,2ifeci,DampBritches,0,Thu Oct 9 00:58:54 2014 UTC,"That's not how kickstarters and crowd funding works. You propose future project and ask people to contribute to it. And he wasn't insanely busy when they started it. So they probably were ready to do it.  Here's the thing I don't think you're getting. I agree that they shouldn't have promised so much. I agree that people should stop donating.  What I don't like is people demanding that he put these things out when he clearly got a lot busier than he expected. Be disappointed, stop donating, keep asking him where the the episodes are. Whatever. But the people who think that that they just record and upload don't understand the process."
Shaboozey,2ifeci,theseekerofbacon,1 point,Thu Oct 9 01:29:08 2014 UTC,"What I don't like is people demanding that he put these things out when he clearly got a lot busier than he expected.

If he can't do it close the patreon and offer refunds or give the money to charity. If he doesn't have time to do something he is taking money to do, he shouldn't be taking the money."
Shaboozey,2ifeci,DampBritches,2,Thu Oct 9 02:32:48 2014 UTC,"Seriously, I'm saying keep bugging him about it. To stop donating until he starts delivering and don't just take it.But, if you don't understand how life can get out of hand in a really short time for someone with a life as variable as his, I'm not sure what's left to say in this conversation."
Shaboozey,2ifeci,theseekerofbacon,1 point,Thu Oct 9 02:48:58 2014 UTC,"He hasn't made the podcast that he takes money for, a priority.  And that is on him.  He made it seem like because it didn't make money, it wasn't a priority. But apparently that wasn't the case.  Else there would be podcasts.  $4k a month is 48k a year, well over the median salary in the US which i like 30k (median household income is about 50k, for 2 people), even them spitting it is 24k each, and this is just a side project.  If a near fulltime salary isn't enough for them to care to do it, nothing is enough,"
Shaboozey,2ifeci,DampBritches,1 point,Thu Oct 9 03:48:36 2014 UTC,"He's currently working on some projects that are taking up ALL of his time and will do much more for his career than a stupid podcast that only appeals to the fans he already has.  I personally can't see how he even has the patience to even do the podcast at this point. I mean, the frustration I'm getting from talking to another fan is just short of causing me to rip my own hair out.  He's been at this for a month.  That month just happened to be when a shit ton of things got scheduled.  Give him a month for those obligations to finish. If it doesn't pan out, demand refunds because he's clearly not following through.  But if you seriously can't see how taking on projects that'll benefit his career for possibly years to come over a podcast that only appeals to people who are already watching his stuff, then there really is nothing left to talk about.  I'm done."
Shaboozey,2ifeci,theseekerofbacon,-1,Thu Oct 9 05:17:17 2014 UTC,No1 is demanding anything from him and complaining about people feeling entitled to something they actually paid for is silly ofcourse they should expect something for their money.   Anyway I'm sure Jesse will find a way to either refund or make it up to the donators since he has gone out of the way before to compensate people for things that weren't even his fault but hopefully he can avoid this in future.
Shaboozey,2ifeci,vradar,1 point,Thu Oct 9 05:28:33 2014 UTC,"Look, I'm not sure if you're reading the other comments in here. But, a lot of people just refuse to acknowledge that he's got other things going on right now. Stuff that he can't control (like learning curve, he's probably has to change everything he's doing to fit the geek and sundry's crew's schedule).   A lot of these people are stopping just short of accusing him of stealing their money. And almost none of them are willing to wait for his other obligations to let up. Hell, knowing Jesse, he'll probably end up doing extra episodes to make it up if he ever gets his scheduled fixed enough to even do the podcast. And if he can't, he's demonstrated that he's willing to put his fans over the money (cox con as an example). So, I'm sure he'd refund the money. Beyond the fact that he clearly cares about his fans, it'd be career suicide to just take people's money and walk away.  The thing that's really ticking me off is that I'm a huge fan of Jesse's. And I can clearly see that what he's doing now, the stuff that's stopping him from doing the podcast is only serving to help his career. Building the connections at geek and sundry, boosting his subs with SGS and Mordor, building relationships with companies like Nintendo so he can get games like Hyrule Warrior early. He's working his ass of to make his channel the best it can be. And right now, he's just got too much on his plate to do the podcast on a regular basis. And a lot of people in this thread are just stamping their feet and treating him like shit for doing what's best for his channel, himself and (in the long run) all of his fans."
Shaboozey,2ifeci,theseekerofbacon,2,Thu Oct 9 05:54:51 2014 UTC,"Then he should just come out and say this then, as far as I've seen he hasn't properly commented on this though correct me if he has. It's fine if hes busy and the podcast has to go for now, but then he needs to speak up and either say hes gonna make up for it or refund the people that have donated for said month silence just makes it worse, people don't give much leeway when it comes to something they are actually paying for.  Also it doesn't help when you hear crendor say when asked on his stream that ""Jesse is the busy one and he's offered to help edit and upload the podcast to help get it out and Jesse either refuses or just doesn't respond to him"".  That still doesn't mean it's ok to call him a thief or anything else, he just made a mistake in taking on too much at once at the time he also started charging for the podcast so keep asking but be nice about it."
Shaboozey,2ifeci,vradar,1 point,Sun Oct 12 21:57:32 2014 UTC,People shouldn't have donated near as much as they did.
Shaboozey,2ifeci,expozedforfunnies,1 point,Mon Oct 6 21:45:58 2014 UTC,"Is it really that difficult to set aside a half hour a day to do the podcast? I know Jesse is busy but crendor says all the time he has to wait for Jesse to edit and upload and he is bad at doing that in a timely manner, so why not let crendor do that stuff then and just have Jesse show up?

Shaboozey,2ifeci,theseekerofbacon,-1,Mon Oct 6 18:52:29 2014 UTC,"Their understanding of the digestive system has to be some of the worst I've heard. Bears have completely different biological systems that work when they're hibernating.  The the digestive system doesn't shut down (unless you're in specific circumstances like a flight or flight response), if it didn't break down the food it couldn't use any of the nutrients or calories. The only thing that contributes to fat is taking in more calories than your body can burn. And the body doesn't know when it's going to get another meal so it stores the excess as fat to be used for energy later if food doesn't do the job (like what happens during regular meals).  The don't eat after 6 has nothing to do with biology. It just helps to promote better eating habits as most people have dinner around 6 and any eating after that is generally snacking.  And lastly, the body is a machine. One that runs better when it has more fuel. When it's low (you haven't eaten in a while) it can slow things down to conserve energy. But, after you eat (around a half hour to an hour afterwards) the stuff you ate has broken down enough for the body to absorb the nutrients and any slow down in effect ceases.   (I really do like these guys, but listening to them talk about anything in regards to science or research makes my butt clench harder than Jesse's game play [for certain games])  Edit: Nevermind, they started trying to interpret dreams. Turning off the podcast now..."

Shaboozey,2i0m29,theseekerofbacon,1 point,Wed Oct 1 21:55:00 2014 UTC,I cant wait for more but i'm wondering why no [Part 1] on this one?
Shaboozey,2i0m29,darkstorm69,-5,Wed Oct 1 21:01:46 2014 UTC,"Hahaha. The part in the lore of the Hand of Sauron where the Talons get all killed if they don't bring home the dead Talons. Such utter bullshit...  I'm always imagining the writers gathering around going: ""Ok, listen, we need to make clear that this is the bad guy. I mean really the bad guy. Unbelievable bad! It's not enough that he slits the throat of the protagonists family! No, there has to be something that really drives home how bad this guy is! Killing innocents just doesn't cut it here!"" - ""Oh, I know let's use something where he does something completely nonsensical to his elite fighters, which this guy doubtingly has. Something anyone with the least bit of tactical sense and a desire of progression would never do, something which would most likely completely hinder this guy from coming to this power or keeping it in the first place!"" - ""Uh yeah, that's a great idea""...  Otherwise this seems an ok game, I guess? I mean, it looks like AC in Mordor. Question is after how many orc heads one does lose interest in the game. I get the sense that the LotR franchise has the same problem like Star Wars got in the past, as Campster talked about in his Peak Star Wars episode.  On another note: I ask myself, if one time there will be a fighting game where the damage model is realistic. So more of single hit kills, but not only the direction foe-->player, which would just up the difficulty to the max, but also player-->foe, but still with the fluid fighting like in AC/AA/SoM. You would really need to block otherwise it would be over, but you could slash through enemies much faster because they're less spongy."

There was already one of those, way back on the original Playstation. Two, in fact (the one I linked had a sequel).  EDIT: Missed the part about the 'fluid, AC (or Arkham, or Shadow of Mordor, but definitely AC or Arkham did it first) style fighting'. That one was close (though strictly one-on-one, and more primitive being from that long ago), though."

Those people are not your friends, they are waiting to kill you. If they don’t give you shit and you don’t give shit back that is not real friendship.  2.) The meaning of life is to have fun because one day you'll be dead, so until then strap cones to your arms, dance around like an idiot, fall in love, and have babies.

Shaboozey,2gynz0,Dexiro,0,Sun Sep 21 09:53:33 2014 UTC,"I totally disagree with you. Pixel-graphics work here because of the lack of detail, which makes everything more eerie because you cant really understand what you see.

Shaboozey,2gynz0,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Oct 6 06:58:30 2014 UTC,So this seems like a machine that turns people in to robots but keeps their skeletons for structural support.  The 3 videos are basically of a guy who had it happen to him and now doesn't understand what happened. You can hear him say he doesn't know what happened in the last video.  That's my view on it anyway.

It's a shame that he has these annoying traits when he actually seems like a pretty cool guy before and after they play a game. Of course, just my opinion."
Shaboozey,2gynz0,Kemsta,1 point,Sun Sep 21 17:49:16 2014 UTC,The name of the game doesn't make it obvious that they're robots. They could be creatures that were like humans but not quite.
Shaboozey,2gynz0,Dexiro,1 point,Sun Sep 21 18:10:20 2014 UTC,"I was informed in my comment that ""uncanny valley"" basically always indicates very human-like robots.

Shaboozey,2ge8uf,theseekerofbacon,4,Mon Sep 15 04:27:14 2014 UTC,General ideas:  Be yourself  Be original  Find a niche  A better than average mic is important  (Based on the million times Jesse/ TB/Dodger have talked about this)
Shaboozey,2ge8uf,Xeropix,3,Mon Sep 15 05:01:12 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it basically comes up at every panel they do, but of course there is no harm in asking. Truth be told about 90% of the questions they get are either recycled or are just someone who wants approval for their own opinion. (especially questions for TB)  What's also important to keep in mind is that both TB and Jesse basically hit the jackpot when it comes to Youtube growth. This is not supposed to mean they don't deserve it, but at the time they got big on youtube the stars aligned for them.   They started at a period when Youtube wasn't as overrun with gaming content as it is now, for several reasons, one of the main ones being that for a long time people with good equipment and skills in broadcasting and editing were few and far between. They became Youtubers in gaming before the gaming industry had decided to use bigger Youtubers for promotions etc. If you start right now, you will never have footage of something first compared to bigger Youtubers who often get access to the same stuff weeks earlier. Just compare the Cataclysm beta that got TB and Jesse most of their early views with the WoD beta. Back then they got a key and worked day and night to get content out as soon as possible. This time around all the bigger youtubers associated with WoW got their key before the beta even went public. A smaller channel covering the same stuff a lot later has no chance against a large channel with an established viewerbase. WoW peaked in Wrath and even though few people would think about it that way now, Cataclysm was among the most anticipated games of all time (even though it was just an expansion). More than 10 million people played at that point and awaited every bit of news about the new expansion eagerly.   My main point being: If you start a channel expect it to be a slow and long grind to get more viewers. And don't expect to make it as quickly as Jesse or TB did. Almost no one could ever start a channel (or make it your main occupation in the case of TB, as he already had it earlier) and make a living off of it as quickly as they did."

Shaboozey,2fe15f,DireBiscuit,1 point,Fri Sep 5 06:05:51 2014 UTC,"Odd about the Taxi customs in New Zealand and Australia but I can see why they make sense. Outside of London, people often get into the front seats of taxis all the time. It's only with 'London' Cabs that you get in the back, owing to tradition.  Also wee bit of Ancient History Incoming: All the talk of Roman Emperor's having thumbs up/down is a modern invention. In Roman gladiatorial combat, when one fighter was down, the Roman Emperor or the Governor of a Province had the authority to decide whether the losing combatant could live. Often they'd go with the will and mood of the audience but only they had the power to decide the fate of the gladiators.  Contrary to thumbs, if the Emperor/Governor/Host gave the sign of Mite (mee-tay, latin slang meaning ""mercy"" or ""life""-The palm of the hand was flat and raised vertically, similar to giving a stop or halt sign), the losing fighter was spared. If they gave the sign of Eugolo (U-go-low, ""doom"" or ""death""-either the palm is raised horizontally or a closed fist) the loser was killed. Gladiators could never kill without the permission of the Emperor or Governor. If they did they'd be put on trial for murder.  So why was it changed? One of the most popular stories you might hear for this one is that Movie Makers of the mid 20th century, were paranoid that the signs might be interpreted by the cinema audiences as Nazi Salutes so they changed them to thumbs up or down based on a painting from 1872 called 'Pollice Verso' (Latin phrase meaning 'turning of the thumb').   Sorry for the lesson but I just find it quite fascinating and the story about it being changed rather funny."

I remember an older podcast where he said ""fuck off, you should be able to speak English"" (another episode about advice concerning travelling where the last advice was to at least learn some basics of the language of the country to travel to like ""hello"", ""bye"", ""Sorry, I don't speak <language>. Do you speak English"" and thank you) which is wrong at best or just flat out ignorant.  And now the ""I'd like to tip Japanese people just cause because people are stupid for not taking free money"". I mean, for them, it's such a big deal that the waiter will refuse it no matter what and run after you if you just leave it on the table.  And ""I pay for you service"" is not an excuse for being a rude arsehole (which is apparently what you are if you sit in the back in a NZ taxi)."

Shaboozey,2f913z,DespairZA,2,Tue Sep 2 14:24:03 2014 UTC,"I bought this game based on Jesse talking about it, the story and turn-based stuff was a lot of fun, the RTS battles were a little easy though as i just gave my dragon all the passives and auras and he was pretty much invincible, so i would just rush and spam. going to replay it sometime with different choices to see what happens, it's such a ridiculous game and so much fun all up"
Shaboozey,2f913z,Nihilore,2,Wed Sep 3 08:55:04 2014 UTC,"I want to buy it (and Original Sin from the same series) because of Jesse (also because they, plus Divine and Beyond Divinity, would mean that my experience with the series is complete), actually, but cashflow is not great."

Saints Row 3 I also bought because of Jesse (and Crendor) with their LP.  I've bought a lot of games because I watched someone else play it and thought I'd like it too. about a 50/50 right/wrong ratio."

It's jarring to go from stuff always being centered to this one thing that isn't. The icons are too small as well. You can't clearly tell what each upgrade is by just looking at it. To finish my rant, the thing that hurts it the most for me is the fact that its too dark. The whole thing is full of muted lacks and dim yellows while the rest of the game is bright and bouncy.

Shaboozey,2e10i1,thesirblondie,1 point,Thu Aug 21 13:30:27 2014 UTC,"They said in one episode of the podcast that they would do it almost everyday, or something like that. A lot more than now anyway. Once they actually get paid by Patreon then hopefully they follow through with that. Good chance they will though since they would have incentive to spend their time doing it. If it's just like it is now then there wouldn't have been a point in putting the Patreon thing up to begin with, I'd imagine."

Last time was early June, before that it was mid February, before that December.  It's not cancelled, it just hasn't come up.   Edit:  If I had to guess when it will come up again, I'd say probably early-to-mid September, it's pretty much a dead zone for game related stuff, no major conventions, no hyped releases.  That said, it's a guess."
Shaboozey,2duhc7,aztech101,1 point,Mon Aug 18 02:12:28 2014 UTC,"Okay, thanks a lot for the info, I'm just glad it's not cancelled, that's probably one of my favourite co-ops he did until now. Well, then I'll wait and hope."
Shaboozey,2duhc7,bloodstainer,1 point,Mon Aug 18 02:28:27 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the co-op nature of that game makes it just something they do whenever they feel like it and both have time. I really like it and its games like that make me miss games that aren't on PC."

Oh, and if you still has some extra power to spare you could install sonic ether's unbelievable shaders or something. It would look incredible."

Shaboozey,2dq07r,ObsoletePixel,2,Sat Aug 16 17:57:56 2014 UTC,Jesse's pc could handle it.  Java would decompile in seconds though.
Shaboozey,2djpyn,odie420,5,Thu Aug 14 15:45:48 2014 UTC,Why not wait until they post it publicly or talk about it?
Shaboozey,2djpyn,dkwolf,5,Thu Aug 14 15:52:02 2014 UTC,I didn't think about this.  If some one else thinks I should take it down I'll remove it until they announce it.  I was just checking up on it and noticed it was up.  I would love to hear some thoughts on this.
Shaboozey,2djpyn,subsevid,2,Thu Aug 14 16:10:05 2014 UTC,"I think this is very dangerous. We dont know if its legit, and people are paying money. This might be a scam."

Shaboozey,2djpyn,subsevid,1 point,Fri Aug 22 07:46:46 2014 UTC,"Yeah, they also put a link in the most recent episode, so it's safe now. But honestly, it seemed pretty fishy before."
Shaboozey,2djpyn,Laamakala,1 point,Fri Aug 22 08:55:11 2014 UTC,"I'd say it's fine since it's open and not that many people are on this subreddit. Once Jesse makes an announcement about it, more will come."
Shaboozey,2djpyn,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Thu Aug 14 18:55:51 2014 UTC,Yup. Crendor said Jesse didn't have time to upload the video before he left for CoxCon.
Shaboozey,2djpyn,RainbowRaccoon,1 point,Thu Aug 14 15:56:08 2014 UTC,They have mentioned the patreon though? Right at the newest (June 24th) podcast's start.

Shaboozey,2djpyn,thesirblondie,1 point,Fri Aug 15 11:51:20 2014 UTC,It is legit
Shaboozey,2djpyn,thesirblondie,0,Sat Aug 16 14:38:54 2014 UTC,how do you know? Theres no artwork on that patreon.
Shaboozey,2djpyn,Scrapshark,1 point,Sat Aug 16 14:45:53 2014 UTC,Because I have asked them about it a while back :)
Shaboozey,2djpyn,subsevid,-1,Sat Aug 16 14:59:15 2014 UTC,You asked Jesse and Crendor a while back if this random paetron with a handful of members is real?
Shaboozey,2djpyn,Scrapshark,1 point,Sat Aug 16 15:34:40 2014 UTC,"They originally didn't allow people to subscribe/donate to it. I asked Crendor or Jesse (I don't remember which) on Skype if they had made it, and they said it was legit :)"
Shaboozey,2djpyn,subsevid,1 point,Sat Aug 16 15:52:37 2014 UTC,Hey guys I'm not sure if this was posted yet.  I didn't see if when I sorted for new.  But the patreon is up!!!!  If this is a repost I'll remove it just let me know.

Shaboozey,2djpyn,SeLfKiLlEr,1 point,Fri Aug 15 14:20:27 2014 UTC,There's a reason I used PayPal for this. If it turns out to be fake you can just issue a charge back.

Which was a damn shame since I've heard so many good things about it and was able to watch like, an hour's worth of the relatively boring beginning part of the game. Thank you so much!"
Shaboozey,2dgw57,shaboozeybot,1 point,Wed Aug 13 20:01:55 2014 UTC,"The funniest part of this whole video is knowing that it would be jesse's turn being extremely angry if he were the one driving ahead first.  I haven't played all of the Resident Evil games but I see their bits of gameplay between cutscenes more like World of Warcraft boss fights.  First you learn the mechanics, then you practice it until you beat it. Some bits of gameplay are just much easier than others."

Shaboozey,2cpiif,DrmFox,3,Tue Aug 5 18:07:03 2014 UTC,Kewl!
Shaboozey,2cpiif,thesirblondie,3,Tue Aug 5 19:13:28 2014 UTC,"Well, that'd explain why he's been hanging out with G&S so much lately."
Shaboozey,2cpiif,JDGumby,2,Tue Aug 5 22:41:49 2014 UTC,Cute.
Shaboozey,2cpiif,Quindo,2,Tue Aug 5 22:53:14 2014 UTC,Was this a joke or is it real?

Shaboozey,2cpiif,spam-monster,2,Wed Aug 6 01:46:26 2014 UTC,"Love it, but can we get Jesse a teaching jacket that's properly tailored?"
Shaboozey,2cpiif,nateddit,2,Wed Aug 6 04:50:48 2014 UTC,Teachers live on about 50k a year. They don't tailor their jacket.
Shaboozey,2cpiif,weabot,2,Wed Aug 6 19:14:28 2014 UTC,"I kind of love how Amy looks in that video, sat next to Stan Lee.  I think she is genuinely trying not to squee out all over him."
Shaboozey,2cpiif,hikariuk,2,Wed Aug 6 07:25:54 2014 UTC,"How can they afford to run a channel with quality content like this? I mean, they have just about the same amount of views as a let's play channel like Jessie's gets. Am I underestimating the pay youtubers get or overestimating the cost of those shows?"
Shaboozey,2cpiif,weabot,2,Wed Aug 6 19:11:49 2014 UTC,"They DID have to go to indiegogo to fund the third season of tabletop, so there's a clue that it's pretty difficult to get by on what they get from ad revenue."

Shaboozey,2cpsjm,thesirblondie,2,Tue Aug 5 21:15:58 2014 UTC,You should probably post details such as where the train is departing from and returning to.

Shaboozey,2cpsjm,NuclearGX,1 point,Wed Aug 6 21:01:04 2014 UTC,"Nice, thanks! I'm not getting there until 4ish, will you still be around?"

Shaboozey,2cnoud,shaboozeybot,3,Tue Aug 5 04:09:21 2014 UTC,I'm pretty sure publishing footage of Jesse trying to play strategy games should be classified as crimes against humanity.

Shaboozey,2cnoud,Veggieleezy,1 point,Tue Aug 5 15:20:30 2014 UTC,I am amazed by how terrible Jesse is at this.
Shaboozey,2cnoud,Cthulhus_desire,1 point,Tue Aug 5 14:44:44 2014 UTC,"I know this is Jesse we're talking about, but I found it almost unbelievable how bad he was in some ways. Let's review:   Misreading Noth's Hero Power - Possibly an honest mistake to think that an AI's hero power would not be written from a first-person perspective like all the other hero powers, since no player would ever have it at their disposal. Failing to understand Noth's Hero Power even while playing against it - It should be obvious almost immediately if your theory doesn't match what you're seeing in practice. Jesse even says ""I don't get how this works"" without trying to understand. That's just ignorant. Pausing to read the card text on a new card the boss plays - Understandable, not everyone reads the card spoilers. Pausing to read the card text on one of his own cards - If you don't know what the card does, why did you put it in your deck? Trying to target a stealth minion with two separate spells - Just blatant lack of knowledge of game mechanics."

Shaboozey,2civlr,Taskew,1 point,Mon Aug 4 00:47:21 2014 UTC,"Aah ya. I tried the old free version and it was interesting, but after watching Dodger livestream the actual release version the other day... I really feel like it's not much of a ""spectator"" game, so I can't really blame Jesse for that one. :P"

Shaboozey,2ca7ea,shaboozeybot,2,Thu Jul 31 22:35:09 2014 UTC,"Fucking zombie sharks and unrealistic level design.  I've not played the RE series before. Is it ALL like this? Just fucking zombies everywhere and shots going all over the place?  Side note: We've seen Cry, Jirad and Jared on Co-Op month. I'm assuming Dodger will be Dead Space DLC and Crendor for WoD beta maybe? Then what is Jesse playing with TB? I really hope it's Divinity"
Shaboozey,2ca7ea,Keneshiro,3,Fri Aug 1 08:21:56 2014 UTC,"The original was a lot more focused on being unsettling-scary, and regular zombies. There is a remake for one of the last-gen consoles, if you want to play it. Jirard reviewed it.  Jessse did Whistleblower with Crendor already."
Shaboozey,2ca7ea,thesirblondie,2,Fri Aug 1 08:33:45 2014 UTC,Oh yeah. Forgot about Outlast dlc. Them dicks man.   Thanks blondie :D

Shaboozey,2c6wqw,shaboozeybot,1 point,Wed Jul 30 23:54:59 2014 UTC,"I listened to the podcast and found your remarks about romances in Bioware games interesting. I've played Bioware games for years, and it's worth pointing out that in a much older title, Baldur's Gate II, there were a lot of consequences for relationships. If you initiated a relationship with more than one character, especially if it was with an evil drow named Viconia, they would make cruel remarks about each other. Taking the wrong side could have dire consequences - not just breaking it off with you, but leaving your group permanently altogether. (The Viconia relationship was pretty complex even by today's standards; she really messed with the player's brain)  I think Bioware departed from this style inadvertently. In Mass Effect and Dragon Age: Origins, many relationships only developed in the Normandy or before resting in camp camp whereas in Baldur's Gate II they would happen anywhere, and usually not in any sort of privacy; the other members of your group could comment on it. They made this change since it was pretty immersion breaking when Aerie (for example) would complain about her wings right before you're fighting Thaxll'ssillyia the Shadow Dragon. ""NOT NOW AERIE!!!"" (I know it's happened to more than just me...)  It's interesting how in that game even the non-romance relationships had impact on the player's party. Some NPC were intolerant of each other and would instigate arguments and fight to the death sometimes. While it was annoying to lose party members, it felt like they existed to more than just entertain you."
Shaboozey,2c42e1,shaboozeybot,8,Wed Jul 30 04:25:38 2014 UTC,That was waaay more emotional than I expected it to be. Great game.
Shaboozey,2c42e1,pyjamalovingbanana,6,Wed Jul 30 06:15:38 2014 UTC,"Man, that shot with all the crosses just hit me really hard. At that point with the narration it just makes you think about all the stories of all the dead soldiers and how they might be just like Emile. Wow."
Shaboozey,2c42e1,hascow,3,Wed Jul 30 15:13:49 2014 UTC,"Still how Karl lives ? I guess they wanted ending , not to be too sad."

Shaboozey,2br2ol,kiskae,2,Sat Jul 26 17:08:28 2014 UTC,"You can hide archives after the broadcast, they simply wouldn't show. He kept the archives in case the local copy failed to record."
Shaboozey,2br2ol,amenolt,2,Sat Jul 26 17:28:32 2014 UTC,He also does a lot of random streaming and he will sometimes stream his research for a WTF is video. Most of those do not make it to youtube.

Since the game runs at 60 its perfectly out of sync.  I imagine it's too late to change the video capture format, as this was was probably all recorded in one sitting.

Not blaming Jesse or anything, just relaying (basically) what Crendor always says on his streams."
Shaboozey,2bdb3k,Keneshiro,3,Tue Jul 22 16:47:32 2014 UTC,"Hmm... Odd. I remember someone actually linking to the Patreon and I had a good look at it. Rather reasonable terms imho. Jesse probably closed it. But yeah, damn it Jesse, we want to throw money at you."

Oh the Patreon page is up (unless they removed it over the past week since I last checked...), it's just not activated so you can't throw any money at it. That's the thing, supposedly, Crendor keeps saying he's bothering Jesse to deal with. I understand there's more to it than just ""flicking a switch"", though, and Jesse's busy, but I really wish he'd find the time to work out all the systems and finer details so it could be turned on. >.>"
Shaboozey,2bdb3k,Keneshiro,2,Tue Jul 22 17:02:25 2014 UTC,Me too man. Me too. I'm guessing Jesse might be a bit busy due to the whole Co-Op month.
Shaboozey,2bdb3k,Quindo,2,Tue Jul 22 17:13:51 2014 UTC,"Bah. Jesse has been this way with this podcast for a long time and I just don't understand it. They get a good amount of views on each of the channels for the podcast and they get bugged about doing the show constantly, so why doesn't he prioritize it? Makes no sense to me at all, and it is a little annoying since Crendor has repeatedly offered to do all the editing and such if needed since he has more time. Argh."
Shaboozey,2bdb3k,crackitlikeamofo,1 point,Tue Jul 22 18:50:17 2014 UTC,I think Jesse might be getting a fair bit of 'extra workload' with the whole Co-Op podcast thing.  I think he is trying to get caught up with all his series because I saw a greenlight video in my feed the other day.

(Although admittedly the gendarmerie are part of the armed forces, technically.)  Also you're a German entering German held territory wearing a French army officer's uniform. I think what you're going to tell people is the least of your worries.  Or maybe biggest."
Shaboozey,2aqfrl,shaboozeybot,8,Tue Jul 15 04:04:30 2014 UTC,"I can't tell if Jesse missed what happened at the end or if he just didn't go into his mind blown mode and explain what happened because he was tired, but the car they escaped in was the guys car from the first game and the smoky figure that came out of the door was the character from the first game. So this isn't so much of a prequel to the game as it is an alternative view of what was going on. The first game was all about getting in and figuring out what was going on, where as this your on the inside so you know what the deal is but now your trying to escape, very cool ending in my opinion."

I figured he would never be back since what he did was total career suicide which is a lot more severe than the rather tame in comparison split Jon did with Game Grumps.  My last comment was in jest because Josh seemed to be a generally rad dude and I enjoyed his time with Jesse in past Greelights, that's all. Except for the unfortunate case of underlying depression and potential repressed sexism fueled by his brother's suicide. So sadly Josh's chances of coming back a quite slim indeed..."

Apparently I remembered the wrong time though, it's 30 seconds, not 15.  After that it wouldn't matter if you watched 31 seconds or all 40 minutes, he'd get the same money.  I think we used to have this discussion over at TB's subreddit every month or so."
Shaboozey,2agl0a,Ihmhi,2,Fri Jul 11 23:42:13 2014 UTC,Depends on whether it's a trueview ad or not. There's like four different types of ad that all act differently.

I think it comes down to feeling like he really doesn't care, with the tea break in this one and the constant sipping of it throughout the rest. He just seems really unprofessional I was ok with him being there in the last one for extra commentary when Jesse was screaming his pants off. It comes down to the fact that he bores me and if the whole channel was like this I wouldn't sub and would never come back."

Just so sick of the deliberately retro look that infests so many indie games over the last 6 or 7 years (many times due to lack of artistic skill, though definitely not in Shovel Knight's case - I might not like the look, but that doesn't mean I can't tell when it's done very, very well).  Give me something like Gianna Sisters: Twisted Dreams or the 2D sections of Sonic: Generations (sad that they added the mandatory 3D sections to ruin the game :( any day."

Shaboozey,29egkc,Asyx,2,Mon Jun 30 13:03:28 2014 UTC,"Shipping, derived from the word relationship, friendship or worship, is the belief of (or desire for) two people, often fictional, to be in a romantic relationship. [...] The methods of shipping can include creating images of two characters a fan wishes to be shown in a loving relationship with one another or writing fan fiction stories on web-based boards in this same context."

Shaboozey,28z4be,Boneary,2,Tue Jun 24 17:04:51 2014 UTC,"Hm, I can only speak for German History classes, where I felt like WW1 was mainly covered to explain how its fallout contributed to starting the Third Reich and WW2.. And that coverage was far briefer than that of WW2.  Then again I feel like 50 % of my school's history classes were about WW2, 40 % about East and West Germany, and 10 % about ""Egyptians and Middle Ages and WW1 and everything"""
Shaboozey,28z4be,gRaF_rOTZ,2,Tue Jun 24 20:43:47 2014 UTC,"I'd say yeah 50% devoted to WWII is the same here, but with less focus on the cold war compared to the egyptians and middle ages, but it depends what kind of history you choose to study, my school at least had a modern history syllabus and schools history project which was more focussed on specific things, crime and punishment through time, medicine through time and The Troubles in Ireland were what I studied on that particular syllabus."
Shaboozey,28z4be,Boneary,1 point,Tue Jun 24 22:26:27 2014 UTC,"I never got to choose between different History classes/projects unfortunately. Could be because I went to school in pretty small towns and they didn't have enough teachers for stuff like that, dunno. And the only stuff about Stone Age/Bronze Age/Egyptians/Greeks/Middle Ages/anything before maybe the 1800s was crammed into 5th grade. It's entirely possible I'm forgetting something though, my first History classes (5th grade, elementary school was just a little bit of local history that wasn't a seperate subject) were in 2000 or somewhere around that time, and I don't have the best memory"
Shaboozey,28z4be,gRaF_rOTZ,1 point,Wed Jun 25 15:14:54 2014 UTC,Can confirm this. We covered WW2 almost every single yearn in school while WW1 was only very briefly covered. Although East/West germany had less coverage for me and Middle Ages had a bigger part and we had a lot of the some of the important stufff that happend after WW2 that germany was not directly involved in.
Shaboozey,28z4be,DainAEmik,1 point,Tue Jun 24 21:13:32 2014 UTC,WW1 was mainly covered to explain how its fallout contributed to starting the Third Reich and WW2   I have a similar experience in Sweden.

Shaboozey,28j6va,thesirblondie,6,Thu Jun 19 09:03:24 2014 UTC,"Jesse Cox is another big deal in the world of video game YouTubers. His 640,000 army of subscribers rack up tens of thousands of views for his episodic content, and he tends to focus on one or two games at a time, producing dozens of episodes before moving on to a new set of games.  ""I may differ from most YouTube commenters talking about an issue like this,"" he offers. ""I think much of the 'importance' of YouTubers in the gaming world is perpetuated by YouTubers wanting to be important in the gaming world.""  YouTuber coverage can potentially make or break an indie game, he reasons, but when it comes to big publishers and AAA developers, most of the big-name don't actually care about YouTubers.  Take E3, for example -- Cox found that, while he received invites from publishers to visit booths and play games, he clearly was not given the same access as the traditional press.  ""You can get invites, and yes, you will be shown around booths, but you will never have the access that traditional media has,"" he says. ""Because the people in charge of these companies still respond to them far more than they will ever respond to you.""  Having said that, he adds, ""In the last year or so they have been reaching out. Which gives us hope. But to say that YouTubers are as important as written press I think is a misnomer. To indie games, yes, very much so. But the big AAA companies are still not sure what to make of us.""  How does an indie studio go about getting covered by Cox, then? The YouTuber notes, quite bluntly, that the hype surrounding a game before release can have a great impact on whether it gets YouTubed or not.  ""While I loved Child of Light for example, none of my audience wanted to watch it,"" he explains. ""Other times I want to play things like South Park and everyone watches. I think it's more about the popularity of the subject matter and the hype behind the game.""  ""Which would make it very easy to just pump out the games people are talking about at the moment - many YouTubers just do that. And I wish them all the best. But, I will continue to play games that interest me, and the internet is welcome to come along for the ride."""

Shaboozey,28c0he,shaboozeybot,5,Tue Jun 17 01:58:15 2014 UTC,I got genuinely sad at the end. Great game tho.
Shaboozey,28c0he,MrDrops,5,Tue Jun 17 22:15:57 2014 UTC,"Me too. Slowly realising what's going on throughout the game then seeing the mother crying over a problem she can't manage to fix...that was tough to watch. The ending explains a few things though. Jesse made a joke at the beginning that she was putting the kid to sleep really early, which actually was because she knew what she needed to do next. And I'm fairly certain she also knew that the dad had gotten custody of their kid and that was her last time seeing him, on his birthday.  To make matters worse, all those empty paint buckets and the easel with no painting on it towards the end makes me think the mom used to be an artist who gave up on her dreams (to start a family?), then her and the father broke up (pretty recently, since there are all those cardboard boxes laying around). She lost everything and turned to alcohol for relief, then became addicted to it.  I feel horrible for her. She has nothing left and she knows losing you is what's best for everyone."
Shaboozey,28c0he,TheOnlyNeb,4,Wed Jun 18 01:33:16 2014 UTC,Damn this game was brilliant
Shaboozey,28c0he,Razier,3,Tue Jun 17 03:43:08 2014 UTC,So is the dad a good guy or what?
Shaboozey,28c0he,JealotGaming,4,Tue Jun 17 16:08:27 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the father is supposed to symbolize safety. That's why he and the bear have the same voice."
