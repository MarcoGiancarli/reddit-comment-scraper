FloridaMan,3e2mq7,neuropean,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:08:17 2015 UTC,Florida Man is having an off day I guess.
FloridaMan,3e2fhy,jaimmster,2,Tue Jul 21 13:04:02 2015 UTC,So did they taze and arrest him yet?
FloridaMan,3e2yy4,ferretflip,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:42:20 2015 UTC,all I can picture is the guy yelling swords repeatedly
FloridaMan,3dywl5,stankmanly,17,Mon Jul 20 17:37:15 2015 UTC,"Submitted yesterday, though this is a much better article. The little detail that the volunteer was shot with his own gun is pretty hilarious, and elevates him to florida-man status in his own right."
FloridaMan,3dywl5,gargles_santorum,6,Mon Jul 20 19:21:47 2015 UTC,Florida Man shot a guy just like that yesterday
FloridaMan,3dywl5,DeviousAardvark,2,Mon Jul 20 20:11:14 2015 UTC,Is this the second florida man story this month involving sea turtles?
FloridaMan,3dywl5,cardenaso10,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:23:57 2015 UTC,Nope that was yesterday. Same story
FloridaMan,3dywl5,killer8424,3,Tue Jul 21 00:35:11 2015 UTC,The one where he was riding a sea turtle and attacked an alligator? Phooey.
FloridaMan,3dywl5,cardenaso10,4,Tue Jul 21 01:07:49 2015 UTC,Jesus I forgot about that one. Get your shit together Florida.

FloridaMan,3e2i1k,Farn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:21 2015 UTC,one would think the bot that checks such things would do a better job.
