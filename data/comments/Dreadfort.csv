What happened to the foolish boy-king was... ah unfortunate... but the Stark heir (Arya Stark in books, Sansa Stark in show) has married our Lord's trueborn and noble son Ramsay.

The wildlings kill all the shithead brothers and nurse him back to health. Sam returns from Oldtown after finding an ancient scroll that says you need to play a special ocarina song and the Others will stop being mad at you. It works and everyone loves Jon. The Others go wherever whores go and are never heard from again.  Dany shows up with dragons and starts fucking shit up. People immediately realize that Jon is the only one who can get her to stop being a bitch. He plays an ocarina song that is unlike anything anyone has ever heard before. The leaves tremble, the clouds come down to kiss the earth, and Dany can't remember why she was so angry. She looks into Jon's brown eyes and realizes for the first time in her life that she is in love. This is her true sun and stars.  Jorah, J-bear, my favorite character has to stand there and watch as the woman he loves makes out with her own nephew.  The ocarina bullshit convinces everyone that Jon is king. Ramsay realizes that the reason he was so mean is that he was gay the whole time. He loves Reek, he really does. He just didn't know how to tell him. He begins a loving relationship with Reek when they are reunited. Jorah has to watch them make out too, and it's almost as bad as Dany/Jon. Dany promises them the rule of the Iron Islands as man and Reek once they help her win the throne. They leave Roose and Walda behind to happily fuck and people the north with vampires.  The group heads south after finding some dragon collars and leashes in the Winterfell crypts. That's what was down there the whole time, the big secret. Fucking dragon leashes. And some more ocarina music books. Mance finally tells Jon he's a cunt and challenges him to a musical battle. Mance loses, but not for any reason that makes sense.   When they get to King's Landing two years later, Cersei is pissed. Her and Dany have a slap fight. Dany is about to lose but Drogon settles things nicely. Tyrion comments on how good his sister smells burning. Alongside Jon and Dany, they set their asses on the dais, since they were the Ones all along. They will rule as a triarch, because it's the first time anyone's ever had that idea before.   As we pan out, majestic music swells. Then Hodor runs into the throne room, screaming... you know what. No one understands. He is covered in offal and shit and has a sign around his neck. I reads ""Reek.""  Hodor is appointed captain of the Kingsguard. At the first small council meeting, he is upset by the news of Dorne's rebellion. That's okay though, because Pycelle reveals the fruit of his last thirty years' labor - a nuke. The last shot is a mushroom cloud above Dorne."

I don't go in for Bolt-on mostly because I think they actually love each other if nothing else in the world. Roose telling people he hates his son is always fishy to me. Nobody does that and even Cat finds it weird. I mean, would Domeric have been able to accomplish what Ramsay has? Would most people?   If they lose Winterfell, Ramsay will definitely survive.

In a coat of skin or a coat of red,  a Bolton has his blade,  Of course Our blades are Sharp, my lord,  and thin and red and stained.

Dreadfort,3ce8m9,Duh_And_Or_Hello_,9,Tue Jul 7 05:50:50 2015 UTC,"From Westros.org   The Boltons are an ancient and powerful house of the North who once ruled as Red Kings from the Dreadfort. Their land reached from the Last River and the White Knife to the Sheepshead Hills. It has been suggested that the legendary Night's King was a Bolton.  Since the Long Night the Red Kings were bitter rivals of the Kings of Winter, the Starks of Winterfell. The Boltons achieved some successes against the Starks, with Kings Royce II and Royce IV burning Winterfell. The Boltons are said to have flayed the skins of several Stark lords and hung them in the Dreadfort. According to rumor, some Bolton lords wore the flayed skins of their enemies—including Starks, such as the son of Bael—as cloaks. This practice has given the Boltons a sinister reputation.   The last Red King, Rogar the Huntsman, submitted to Winterfell when the Andal invasion of Westeros was also beginning. King Theon Stark, the Hungry Wolf, and the Boltons defeated Argos Sevenstar and his Andals in the Battle of the Weeping Water."

Dreadfort,3ccfj6,Franco_Andres,16,Tue Jul 7 03:41:18 2015 UTC,"Ahem, our lord's trueborn heir is called Ramsay, not Ramsey. Will you offer a finger or a toe for flaying? Rest of post is out of character.  Now in the books Roose really came off well to me. He's a bit of an asshole in that he stabbed his king in the heart and minor stuff like that. But he has no shame and is a brilliant political player. For every dirty move he makes he finds somebody else to blame. He blames Robett Glover for the disastrous battle at Duskendale, whilst he gave the order. Knowing full well they were disastrous at well. He then blames the Brave Companions for all the trouble in the Riverlands, even though he himself causes quite a lot of it.  Then his masterpiece, the Red Wedding. He removed his liege lord to end a war the North could never win. In this he not only saved the lives of countless Northerners who otherwise would have died fighting a hopeless cause against a Lannister-Tyrell-Baratheon(who really are Lannisters) alliance.  He also through brilliant political action makes himself the overlord of the largest region of Westeros, one of the strongest and most powerful men in the realm. But what his greatest achievement is, is that most people in Westeros are blaming this on the Freys, not the Boltons. Yes they realise Roose was complicit in it, but because they hate the Freys more and there are so god damn many of them people sort of forget to hate the Boltons.  Roose is a mastermind politician who doesn't shun to use a dirty trick once in a while. In the books Ramsay is really just a bit of a prick.  In the show however Ramsay is portrayed so majestically by Iwan Rheon that I could not help but fall in love with the character (shameless r/gayforbolton plug). He still is a bit of a prick, but the acting is so fucking great that you love Ramsay. You know that what he's doing isn't exactly nice, but damn it that guy looks good when doing it and he really comes off as the likeable, nice psychopath. Show Ramsay I like almost as much as I like book Roose"

Roose might be the only pragmatic person in the entire story.   If you could accuse one character in the stories for having cheated, and read the books, it would be Roose."
Dreadfort,3ccfj6,aaldan,3,Tue Jul 7 03:16:50 2015 UTC,"I'm fascinated by characters who are willing/enjoy things like torture and gore. Roose is especially interesting. He's ruthless, allows his son to do a lot of crazy shit, but he's just so cold and mysterious that I want to know more about his end game. Surely, he can't expect Ramsay to hold onto an entire dynasty once Roose isn't there to control him?   In the show, Ramsay is damn near invincible at this point. I figure if I keep rooting for him, the GRRM and the showrunners will eventually get the hint and off him."
Dreadfort,3ccfj6,sleepyjack2,2,Mon Jul 6 20:58:41 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think Roose knows Ramsey is on a ruinous path but will use his zeal (in being legitimized and advancing their holdings) to forward his ultimate goal (which as you astutely noted is unclear). If Ramsey is cut down, I think Roose will show little to no give a F**s. His *real heir is in that Ham Frey girl."

I like his character, and yes, also the sadisticness of his character. I prefer the show version of him to the book vesion, and like his sadistic games. I think it's mainly because torure adds a new depth of emotion to the story: Fear becomes terror and courage becomes even more courageous. Joy and relief are magnified because even little things will seem amazing, and all emotions and acts have such a strong meaning. When Reek kills Miranda to save sansa from her arrows, he's not just risking his life, he's risking so much more. The same with sansa grabbing that corcsrew and many other things."

So I started to actively cheer for Skeletor to win, I cheered for  COBRA, I cheered for The Million Dollar Man.

Sure, maybe they can be a bit cruel but so far it's working like a charm and I doubt your average joe up north will be very sad that there's no huge rebellion anymore. Starks were loved because they were in charge and powerful not because they were good, Boltons will be the same. Speaking of Starks, their poor decisions and ""honor"" have caused much more grief than anything Roose and Ramsay ever did. Where is the honor in lying to your wife about your bastard son, where is the honor in treating a bastard son like shit, where is the honor in sending the entire westeros into war by supporting someone you know nobody wanted as king? Roose took the steps needed to save the realm and further his house in the process.  Plus Ramsay is hilarious while also scary."

Lord Lard's plan is working out soundly and he's five steps ahead of Roose. Which is why he has the balls to insult the Freys so openly: he's not afraid to die because he knows the Boltons/Freys will have their comeuppance, and his vengeance plan is in its final stages. Also, during this scene, through Reek, you'll notice that Roose has a hint of fear in his eyes.  Roose doesn't strike me as a man so easily afraid."

Dreadfort,3bsyc3,MordorsFinest,8,Thu Jul 2 07:28:14 2015 UTC,Our Lord went for a Jolly stroll and decided to finish off that Rebellious Stannis while he was out there.
Dreadfort,3bsyc3,JoTheKhan,-4,Thu Jul 2 10:38:41 2015 UTC,No but actually i didnt see this scene in the episode.
Dreadfort,3bsyc3,MordorsFinest,5,Thu Jul 2 10:42:30 2015 UTC,Should be the last episode when Stannis decides to set up camp and start to siege Winterfell and Lord Bolton's forces decide to meet him in the field.
Dreadfort,3bsyc3,JoTheKhan,-6,Thu Jul 2 10:44:08 2015 UTC,Lord Bolton sent a lot more though... The 20 good men who ravaged Stannis's camp wouldnt be that great if they were caught on camera
Dreadfort,3bsyc3,MordorsFinest,3,Thu Jul 2 11:08:32 2015 UTC,"yeah those were the vanguard, there was a whole army that charged Stannis but this was the first shot from the sky of the scene."

Dreadfort,3brb8c,ktg1678,3,Wed Jul 1 15:35:46 2015 UTC,"[spoilers]  I've read about half the books, but this video makes me really excited about new information. Rob Stark's lovely, lovable by the audience as well as Rob, young lady bride disappears in the book. I didn't know what happen to her. She just wasn't mentioned. I didn't think she died. I'd hoped she'd escaped into obscurity, perhaps even back to her homeland. HBO GOT, however, has a much more dramatic and exacting end for her with this new possibility: that she was indeed a Lannister spy. This is fairly exciting, to think that a book and screen character I really liked/loved could actually be sinisterly employed.   Correct me if I'm wrong with any spoiler-rich book & screen details."
Dreadfort,3brb8c,FrozenCaveMoose,11,Wed Jul 1 16:52:25 2015 UTC,"Her character does not exist in the books, Robb marries Jeyne Westerling, the daughter of the lord of The Crag, who nurses him back to health after he is wounded while taking The Crag. She was not present at the Red Wedding, and her whereabouts are unknown. The Great Northern Conspiracy fan theory has her hiding either with The Blackfish in the Riverlands or in The Neck under the protection of Howland Reed."
Dreadfort,3brb8c,TheUnrepententLurker,4,Wed Jul 1 17:05:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you, good sir. That was the information I sought.  I recall the name of her origin, now. I'm still glad that she disappeared into obscurity rather than face a crossbow's wrath."
Dreadfort,3brb8c,FrozenCaveMoose,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:24:47 2015 UTC,"Huh? She was at Riverrun with the Blackfish but she is there when Jaime gets Riverrun to surrender and she is sent back to the Crag. She will be in the prologue for the Winds of Winter, many speculate the Brotherhood without Banners will attack the Lannisters escorting her and Edmure Tully"

People are dumb.  Tywin was always so much worse.  Littlefinger for sure.  Arguably both Theon and his dad.  Even the heretics who don't like the Boltons should have put Lord Roose on the list before Lord Ramsay.  Just because you don't see them personally torture someone (WHO DESERVED IT) on-screen, you ignore the sins of people who have started or instigated gigantic continent-wide wars and caused thousands if not tens of thousands of innocent deaths?    </rant>"

Dreadfort,3biy2a,slowmoon,3,Tue Jun 30 01:11:48 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that Twyin pointed the Mountain in a direction and the Mountain did as he pleased after that. Seriously, he is a fucking mad dog. You point him in one direction and get the fuck out of the way."

Dreadfort,3biy2a,slowmoon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:51:18 2015 UTC,No one wanted to marry Tyrion anyway. The mere fact that the Lannisters had a dwarf in the family was (in Tywin's eyes) dragging the family name through the mud. What harm was there in him marrying a lowborn girl?
Dreadfort,3biy2a,mrbibs350,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:54:52 2015 UTC,Tyrion was an imp but he was a Lannister Imp. Eventually a wife would have been found simply because of his name. Marrying a lowborn just dragged the Lannister name lower in Tywin's eyes.
Dreadfort,3biy2a,Rickymex,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:42:22 2015 UTC,"Just speaking of events during the actual series, he had the Mountain burn the riverlands as retaliation for Cat taking Tyrion.

At the Battle of the Green Fork, Tyrion notes a flight of arrows hitting both Stark and Lannisters alike. Roose Bolton commanded the Northern force and sent Stark loyalists into the field while keeping Bolton men in the reserve force. It's very likely that Roose is responsible for the friendly fire."

He had no idea Ramsay was still alive until the Theon took over Winterfell. At that point a new opportunity presented itself.   The fact that Robb lost the Karstarks and the Frey's probably didn't help much either.

This derivation of the name may however be spurious. The Flemish themselves referred to the weapon as a ""spiked staff"" (gepinde staf). Another theory is that it's related to Germanic/English ""dagger"", so instead of ""good day"" it may have meant ""good dagger"". ""Dag(ger)"" isn't used anymore in current Dutch, while ""goedendag"" is still correct in current Dutch as ""good day""."

I like honesty.  Ramsay is a character I did not like in the books, which is probably because GRRM writes a buildup where you are supposed to dislike Ramsay. But in the show Iwan Rheon made such a brilliant performance as Ramsay that I've completely fallen in love with the show character (only a little bit homo)"
Dreadfort,3afju1,puddingkip,24,Fri Jun 19 19:57:36 2015 UTC,"Seconded.   edit: That said, let me expand on that. In the show, I love them both. Iwan has done a bang up job with Ramsay and he can do no wrong for me. If Jon is dead on the show (which would be so much bull), I'll still watch for Theon, Ramsay and Arya.   In the books, however...Roose is great, very complex from book one, but Ramsay is so far out there it's very hard to like him. He might be one of GRRMs few irredeemable characters. The Mountain might be another. And Theon would be a third EXCEPT that Ramsay got a hold of him. Tortured him and twisted him until Theon is finally sympathetic again. No quick death for him, he gets to see how badly things turn out because of what he did, and who he turned on. He gets to see who dies because of him, houses torn apart because of him. He gets to come out the other side, not whole but changed, a broken man who all but weeps to hear a few birds say his name. Who mourns his brother, Robb (who was a truer brother to him than any son from Balon Greyjoy's loins)  Without Ramsay, you have no Theon redemption arc. Without Ramsay, you lose this wonderful story of a broken man who is in no place to make big changes for the better, but he still tries there at the end.  You need Ramsay for that, and for that fact alone, I love the character even if I cannot abide his treatment of children or women or, hell, anyone."
Dreadfort,3afju1,Duh_And_Or_Hello_,2,Sat Jun 20 00:35:48 2015 UTC,"I love your explanation of Theon's situation. Indeed, Theon tried to reap and not sow as his forefathers did, but he didn't know how to wield a metaphorical Ironborn scythe and the fruits of his harvest were brief and bitter indeed.  And agreed, in the books Ramsay is supposed to be Joffrey level of unlikeable but with the way Iwan Rheon portrays him, he comes off as quite a brilliant smartass and even though he does plenty of despicable things, but he's also very intelligent and strategic in his own right and you can't help but think it'd be fun to have a few drinks with the guy to see what he'd do provided you were on his good side."
Dreadfort,3afju1,GingersPMMeYourBoobs,3,Sun Jun 21 18:29:13 2015 UTC,That's a very interesting and well thought out character analysis. ^

Dreadfort,3afju1,GingersPMMeYourBoobs,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:07:51 2015 UTC,"I had no idea who those people were. I had to Google it and what the hell? Roose is set in a medieval world where mass murder and assassination are common. All nobles engage in this kind of behaviour.   That is not the same as mass murdering innocent children at a high school. I'm not even sure how you made the connection. Besides, Roose is a purely fictional character set in a fictional world, those kids were real and in a real world"
Dreadfort,3afju1,Timonidas,12,Sat Jun 27 14:17:45 2015 UTC,"Roose is very similar to Tywin.  Tywin just got lucky he was literally born on a chunk of gold. Roose earned his position as warden of the north, where Tywin just has to not fuck it up too badly (with a little work because of his father) to retain his position as warden of the west.  House Bolton is what house Reyne would be if they had Tywin on their side"
Dreadfort,3afju1,ArmedShadowfox,3,Sat Jun 20 13:35:21 2015 UTC,"Tywin just got lucky   That's very debatable. Yes, Tywin lucked out by being born in to wealth but he very much was a worthy leader and figurehead.  By all accounts we know of, Tywin Lannister was the epitome of the lion. He was ferocious yet calculating and even his enemies respected him. When Tywin Lannister spoke, both kings and peasants paid attention. It can very well be argued that the ""lion's share"" of House Lannister's current success is solely due to the actions of Tywin Lannister.  Aside from that, not a bad assessment. I'm positive Roose Bolton approved of how Tywin took out both the Reynes and the Tarbecks and would do the same but probably with less drowning and more flaying."
Dreadfort,3afju1,Finchios,5,Sun Jun 21 18:39:16 2015 UTC,"I like them both, Roose is the evil mastermind kind of person. Always quiet, merciless, but not unneccesarily gruesome. He is a subtle guy who knows his shit. And ramsay is his psycho sidekick, mad psychokiller sadits tortures with pleasure makes everyone fear his Name and seems to be OP at everything he does, his like the Joker just as good fighter tactician and whatnot, people shiver in fear if they here storys about shirtless ramsay sneaking in their castles."
Dreadfort,3afju1,ArmedShadowfox,5,Sat Jun 20 06:21:20 2015 UTC,To me Ramsay is the one character in the show that IS wholly evil. He has no motivation to be the way he is. Power hunger is not a reasonable option when we have cot her characters with so much more range. He's the least believable character for me which pisses me off because Roose is one of the most believable.
Dreadfort,3afju1,OogleGRRM,3,Sat Jun 20 16:36:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's an unbelievable character. These sociopathic people exist in  our society, it's only our modern societal constructs which force them to behave in ways that they don't stand out to us like Ramsay does in his ""time""."
Dreadfort,3afju1,ArmedShadowfox,2,Sun Jun 21 02:27:31 2015 UTC,"right but the point is GRRM stated there will be no ""wholly evil"" characters in ASOIAF, like the Orcs in LOTR. Maybe D&D aren't following that path 100% but if u want me to hate Ramsay for treating people like shit, you'd better have a good reason for him to be behaving the way he does.   Why did Robert start his rebellion and remained bitter decades after? He loved Lyanna.  Why is Danny hellbent on reclaiming Westeros? To avenge and reclaim the Targaryen dynasty.   Why did Robb march toward Kings Landing? To rescue his father and sisters.   Why is Ramsay an asshole? Fuck it, dude's just a prick. (Not good enough)  He needs a scene where we get to know his true nature. A scene that allows him express his motives."
Dreadfort,3afju1,SchurkjeBoefje,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:37:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's fair to say that there are no evil peoples in GoT, like your example of the Orcs.

Dreadfort,3afju1,weitnum,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:55:39 2015 UTC,Idk you're not really addressing my point. I am not saying there are wholly evil people in GoT EXCEPT for Ramsay.
Dreadfort,3afju1,ArmedShadowfox,2,Sun Jun 21 21:21:00 2015 UTC,"One could make the argument that if Ramsay really is an unempathetic psychopath, he perhaps cannot be considered 'evil' (which is a dubious and notoriously vague definition in even the best of cases) because he is legitimately mentally ill."
Dreadfort,3afju1,lordemort13,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:34:52 2015 UTC,Idk I mean Joffrey is pretty evil.
Dreadfort,3afju1,mrbibs350,2,Sun Jun 21 03:26:44 2015 UTC,"that's a good point but see in his case what I see it is that Robert wasn't a good father to him. Robert even tells Joffrey ""I should have taught you how to be a man"" IIRC. This leaves a big ""missing father figure"" hole in Joffrey which leaves him to run amok.   Roose at least has several scenes with Ramsay that establish his connection, ultimately developing their relationship as a father-son household. So there's no reason Ramsay would be off the rails (in the SHOW- I know the books are quite different), considering he has his father. My father treated me worse in my early teenage years than Roose does toward Ramsay. Roose treats him likes a proper son now. Being a bastard doesn't seem to have shamed Ramsay in the precise effect that he would be so hostile towards everyone. If anything, that would come from being treated like shit and neglected most of his life- including current events, which is not what we've seen."
Dreadfort,3afju1,LordDreadfort,7,Sun Jun 21 04:34:41 2015 UTC,"In the show I like both of them, but Roose is my favourite character because of Michael McEllhaton (spelling). He is just so perfect.  In the books I like Roose but Ramsay.. not so much."
Dreadfort,3afju1,Haramune,15,Fri Jun 19 23:53:35 2015 UTC,Have you seen this?
Dreadfort,3afju1,aspdpositive,2,Sat Jun 20 06:25:53 2015 UTC,"Well, Roose is an admirable character mainly because of his no-bullshit policy: when Jaime Lannister tries to threaten him with annihilation, Roose simply responds with ""Lannister enmity means little to Bolton"". The entirety of the noble houses of Westeros cower before the Lannisters, and yet here is a relatively minor lord telling them to go piss off. Yes, that was an overture for the beginning of negotiations, but still the underlying policy was sound.  Another example of similar attitude is when Ramsay tries to overreach and is immediately brought back to his level with the 'Don't make me rue the day I raped your mother' line - probably the second most memorable quote from the series so far with the abovementioned one being firmly at the top."

Dreadfort,3ad5xs,Cryptophagist,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:29:20 2015 UTC,Ramsey actually respects Jon in the books and it's hinted at by Ramsey's actor as well.  Ramsey uses him as an example of how someone born a bastard can rise to the very top.
Dreadfort,3ad5xs,Gigglestomp123,2,Wed Jun 24 14:16:37 2015 UTC,"Yet in the books it is Ramsay who is said to have been the one to be controlling Reek when he believed he was Theon Greyjoy, and took Winterfell. It was Ramsay who flayed the boys to make it seem like they were the Stark children. Jon Snow posed a threat. He always did.  Honor would have stolen him away, and he would have wanted revenge, and started another war with our Great Lords of the Dreadfort. Anyone that isn't family, cannot be trusted."
Dreadfort,3ad5xs,Gigglestomp123,2,Wed Jun 24 19:21:53 2015 UTC,"Well just because Ramsey respects someone doesn't mean he won't flay, dismember or displace them."
Dreadfort,3ad5xs,grrrrumble,2,Wed Jun 24 19:50:50 2015 UTC,I don't think he even really respected him. Just showed him as an example. Tommen is a bastard too.
Dreadfort,3ad5xs,avianrave,8,Wed Jun 24 20:56:04 2015 UTC,Until the Roose Bolton unleashes the twist of the century... HE is Jon Snow's dad. Hence why both Ramsay and Jon have dark hair while also being natural leaders.

Jon had the opportunity to marry the hottest woman in the North (but for our Lady and our Lord Ramsay's wife), and Stannis would have served him Winterfell... He told the False King to fuck off and respected our Lord Roose as Warden of the North.  Truly, Jon Snow was not an enemy of our great house."

Dreadfort,3acffs,dynex811,9,Fri Jun 19 00:13:54 2015 UTC,At that point it is mostly wimpering.
Dreadfort,3acffs,mandiblebutt,48,Fri Jun 19 03:01:59 2015 UTC,"Because the Boltons are not included among the Great Houses of Westeros.  When you talk about the best burgers you've ever eaten, why would you mention steak?  It's irrelevant to the conversation, as it is in a league above all else.  THE Great House of Westeros shouldn't be bandied about in a discussion about the pissant Lannisters and Starks and Tyrells."
Dreadfort,3acffs,I_Buck_Fuffaloes,8,Fri Jun 19 02:22:52 2015 UTC,"It's sickening how the Starks were considered to be THE Great House by the sheep. And now that the Boltons are in the same position that the Starks were in (you know, minus being cunts), the Boltons don't get the same recognition. WAHH, OUR FAVORITES ALL GET KILLED BECAUSE THEY'RE NAIVE AND DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO PLAY THE GAME. Clearly, they're afraid of acknowledging reality, and that reality is that the Boltons are THE Wardens of the North. KING OF DAH NORTH indeed.  EDIT: I do believe Arya Stark is coming along nicely. Her blades were indeed sharp. She could make a good addition, assuming she knows her place amongst the Boltons."
Dreadfort,3acffs,Capncorky,3,Fri Jun 19 02:04:36 2015 UTC,"Really it's the Starks' fault for being so naive as to think they had a chance of winning just due to their sickening self-righteous ""morality.""

Dreadfort,3acffs,Nevermore0714,-6,Sun Jul 5 07:50:51 2015 UTC,No no. You didn't annihilate Stannis. The show writers did that for you. You simply helped. A little bit. They basically served him to you on a platter.
Dreadfort,3acffs,skullshark54,7,Fri Jun 19 07:19:42 2015 UTC,"Who are these show writers? Stannis lost because he put all his eggs with some crazy religious chick. Relying on magic to kill your enemies and win your battles is reprehensible, he stood no chance once he met a house that are both cunning and have 20 good men. It's a pity he used cowardly tactics to kill his brother Renly, Renly would likely at least have put up some sort of a fight than the humiliating massacre at Winterfell that was Stannis. A pathetic loss for a pathetic child killing ""king""."
Dreadfort,3acffs,grrrrumble,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:27:17 2015 UTC,Yea if you actually read the books. You would know Renly is absolute trash especially compared to stannis (Robert is steel. Stannis is iron. And Renly is tin pretty to look at but not very useful otherwise. Point is this. In the books as of right now Stannis has an army and has reinforcement on the way. Exactly as you said he didn't put up a fight in the show because the showwriters decided to take his army away and make him do a total 180 on pretty much everything his character stands for. Stannis is a military genius you think that he would walk up to winterfell without scouting? That is not Stannis. that is the show writers basically forcing stannis to kill himself for you. Now you may say you defeated him. But we all know that the writers did that for you. There was no battle. there was a scripted slaughter. And if there to be a real battle in which it basically wasn't just given to them then there would be a lot of dead botons in the snow. Lots of dead on both side. Again my final point reiterated. Stannis was artificially nerfed by the show for the sake of wrapping shit up quickly. And if it weren't for that the battle would have ended very differently. Probably with Bolton win still. But you get my point.
Dreadfort,3acffs,skullshark54,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:45:57 2015 UTC,"Robert is steel. Stannis is iron. And Renly is tin pretty to look at but not very useful otherwise.    Robert was a fat alcoholic man-child, Stannis was a religious maniac who burned his daughter after two inches of snow, and Renly was the only somewhat competent one.    Exactly as you said he didn't put up a fight in the show because the showwriters decided to take his army away and make him do a total 180 on pretty much everything his character stands for.   His character stands for stubborn will and unbending determination to win, no?   Stannis is a military genius you think that he would walk up to winterfell without scouting?   His genius was apparently overestimated.  TWO INCHES OF SNOW? UP IN SMOKE SHE GOES.   And if there to be a real battle in which it basically wasn't just given to them then there would be a lot of dead botons in the snow. Lots of dead on both side.   Lord Roose is a better commander than you give him credit for, then.   That is not Stannis.    TWENTY GOOD MEN? NOW MY BLOODLINE MUST END."
Dreadfort,3acffs,Radient-Red,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:03:34 2015 UTC,The show did Stannis dirty. Regardless of the outcome I at least wanted him to be given a decent portrayal. But nope just a rushed plot and an off screen battle and death. If they had fleshed out the battle and given it more than 30 seconds it could have been great.

Dreadfort,3ae2fb,TornadoWatch,2,Sun Jun 21 06:35:25 2015 UTC,"Our Good Lord's actions at the Red Wedding were absolutely tragic   I disagree. I admire Lord Roose Bolton's actions at the Red Wedding. You see, I support the rightful rule of Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons.  Lord Roose Bolton killed both a traitor and the son of a traitor with his own bare hands that night and his actions should be applauded. I understand that he took an active part in Robert's Rebellion, but I don't honestly believe a Bolton would intentionally follow a Stark unless out of necessity.

Winter is upon them, they are poorly clothed, have no supplies and our Lord will obviously question -with great persistence- anyone who might shelter them.  If they have any sense at all they will walk up the gates and politely beg for forgiveness and to be let back in."

Dreadfort,3aajun,birz89,8,Thu Jun 18 15:13:46 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I am very curious how you can have time to roam the internet about asoiaf but not watch the show or read the books. Also, you have clearly been given some misinformation, so allow me to clear a few things up. Most important is that Ramsay is NOT a bastard. He has been legitimised by Tommen. Calling him Snow or Bastard is unacceptable and we will not stand for it, so beware!  Roose has grown to love his wife Walda,I believe, or at least he is affectionate of her. He obtained the north by being clever (and tactical and ridding the world of traitors along the way) He seems quite content, what with his current position as warden of the north.  I don't know about the books, but in the show there has been a very touching scene between our Lord Roose and his trueborn son Ramsay, in which it is clear that Roose does love him. He is his son, after all. The reason for Domeric's death was a sickness of the bowels, so the maester said.   'A peaceful land, a quiet people.' that has always been Roose's rule. And so he will probably often have peacefull nights. He has earned his claim and title by cleverness and other virtues, and of course by right of marriage his claim is made even stronger. This is a very good claim, so he shouldn't need to fight constantly to keep it, but even if he would his opponents would be no match to his intelligence.  BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY Ramsay is NO bastard, never claim such outrageous things again.  Any other Questions?"
Dreadfort,3aajun,Shadow_Alice,2,Thu Jun 18 15:59:18 2015 UTC,"Roose didnt become warden of the north by deceit, he stayed true to the one king and defeated the usurper robb stark in a glorious duel at the twins"
Dreadfort,3aajun,BrannistheMannis,2,Thu Jun 18 16:44:54 2015 UTC,"Of course Roose Bolton is happy, he has his noble trueborn son Ramsay Bolton who he just married to a beautiful young bride who loves him very much, he has saved the north from people who wanted nothing but ruin for it and its future (The Starks), he has a strapping young wife who is now pregnant, and he has the loyalty of the whole North who adore him like a father as they should with such a generous and noble lord. So of course he's happy."
Dreadfort,3aajun,uncle_unicorn,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:39:27 2015 UTC,I'd like to add to this that Lord Roose has actually said in the past that marrying his wife made him very happy indeed. He was offered his bride's weight in gold by Walder Frey as a wedding gift when Lord Bolton married one of Frey's daughters. She is a very strong lady with good child bearing hips and so it all worked out wonderfully - as it should for such a true and honourable man.
Dreadfort,3aajun,munchenman123,0,Fri Jun 19 16:34:19 2015 UTC,"I'd have to agree that lord Roose Bolton is one of the most interesting characters in ASOIAF. Also I agree that he most likely unhappy. We saw this first in book one, as Roose was struggling to be heard in the war councils of the Northern Rebellion due to his soft voice.     Additionally all the moves Roose has made thus far have shown his discontentment with his current political position. He aims to climb the ranks of the political structure, and yet his quite and cunning nature has allowed him to succeed so far.     Truth be told I am no Ramsay loyalist, however I have a unquenchable interest in his father."

Who does the wildlings hate the most? Olly for killing the bastard Jon Snow. What does the wildlings now have that the Bolton's need? A fleet! House Bolton takes care of that little brat Olly in exchange for the fleet and for the wildlings to bend the knee. A fair deal, but Roose and Ramsay are known to be just that.  Why would House Bolton need a fleet you might ask, after all you can't very well sail up and down Weeping Water all day. The fleet is needed to take care of those Greyjoy's. Baron Greyjoy deserves death for his complete neglect and mistreatment of his son Theon. One of Ramsey's most kind decisions was to take Theon into the warmth after all, treating him with love and respect and even giving him a new name so he could finally be a proud man. Reek needs to know that his so called father and sister will pay the ultimate price for their betrayal of him. It's time to put an end to the horrible House Greyjoy!"

Dreadfort,3a9lip,buuun,6,Thu Jun 18 15:29:49 2015 UTC,"House Bolton seeks no crown, for it values the virtue of humility. Lord Bolton wouldn't be so bold to declare himself King in the North, for instance. Eddard Stark wouldn't have done so either, he dedication to the realm and his duties as Warden outweighed his personal ambition. Besides, what would that title earn us but new enemies?

You forget that Lord Bolton is just that - a lord. He is no king. He bends his knee to Tommen Baratheon, and is Warden of the North at the pleasure of the Lannisters' puppet boy false king.  Of course, I understand a fine man such as Roose Bolton only serves such filth out of pragmatism, and the desire for a peaceful land and a quiet people. There is certainly no shame in this, for it is merely doing the best one can with their situation. However, do not mistake your lord to be the equivalent of a queen."

We all know how she dealt with them. Being totally honest here, we are the strongest house in Westeros but we are also the cruelest. Somehow I don't think she will allow our house to continue to exist, the same reason why Aegon the Conqueror didn't let those cowardly Starks with their 'Kings in the North' continue ruling. Plus, we are the only house in Westeros whose entire history is based on skinning people and wearing their skins as clothes. Based on those to facts alone, it is unlikely that the Mother of Dragons will let us live in peace. Therefore, we must waste no time skinning her, her Unsullied and/or possibly her dragons if she happens to enter the North. I do not want to challenge the authority of our Lord Roose or his heir Ramsay, but this seems like the best course of action against this foreign foe."

They are in a barely repaired castle, they are lacking in food, Winter is here and the White Walkers are on the march.  However, Daenerys currently has lost two of her dragons, doesn't really have control over the one she is with, is separated from her army and surrounded by a horde of horse riding, warrior rapists. I am merely saying she is currently no match for House Bolton. So, even if she does manage to regain her army, she would theoretically would have to launch a land war with the Northern Houses which would quite possibly lead to her being skinned by the Boltons. That said, she may have a chance of taking Winterfell and possibly the North because her experience of sacking cities in Essos and the fact that the Boltons don't exactly inspire loyalty among the Northern Houses (hence the Northern Conspiracy). But this may prove difficult due to the fact that the North is ridiculously large and even Stannis Bartheon, one of the greatest military minds of Westeros, was not able to take Winterfell. Plus, she probably would have her dragons. The two that were locked up have gone feral and unlikely to help her and Drogon is as likely to help her as not. Don't skin me"

Imagine the excitement and amazement of Lord Ramsay Bolton, should he be wise enough to kneel before the Queen of Dragons, and be blessed enough to perhaps even ride one for himself? It is said that Dragons choose their own masters, after all. There is nothing to say a Dragon would not take him as a Dragonrider after all, right?  Surely, there would be no match in all of Westeros, were Ramsay Bolton to fly on the wings of a Dragon after all? I hear the Boltons have a tradition of flaying their enemies alive. I wonder how durable and different the skins of your enemies would be when tanned and cured with real dragonfire? Just a thought.  When the Mother of Dragons comes to Westeros, the land will be purified, by fire and blood. All Lord Bolton would need to do is bend the knee to her, just as he would rightfully to any true heir to the Iron Throne. Even the Martells and the defiant Dornishmen ended up bending the knee in time to the Targaryens. It's a perfectly rational and logical request.  The North could be irrevocably the domain of the Boltons for many blessed generations to come. This is completely doable. All I ask is that they bend the knee to the one true queen of Westeros, heir to the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms."

A dragon is more than a match.  Are you familiar with Harrenhal? Largest castle in the Seven Kingdoms? There's a good reason why most of it is a rubble, and that reason is Balerion the Black Dread. The personal steed of Aegon the Conqueror and Maegor the Cruel, Balerion came from old Valyria before the Doom, and was large enough to swallow a mammoth whole.  I don't mean to provoke. However, let us be reasonable... Should it come down to blows, the North would fall again as it has once before to the Targaryens. My queen has three dragons, for crying out loud. Even the sharpest blades can't touch what is in the air, and crossbowmen's bolts to a dragon are as an ant's bite would be to you.  It doesn't need to be this way, however. Why not bend the knee to a true ruler and queen, and not this Lannister puppet boy that currently sits on the Iron Throne? The North could be safely ruled by the Boltons for generations to come. This isn't a threat: Rather, it's the suggestion that the North may in fact have many wonderful and blessed days under the watch of the Boltons, should they bend the knee to the one true queen of Westeros when she returns.

I'll assemble all info when more is known, including a family tree of course. And by the way, yes, there must be more members of house Bolton, or at least must have been, but none that we know of.

In my opinion this is big hole in Martins work... He give us a lot of back story and history of other houses like Starks, Lannisters, Martells, etc, and then, when new house enters into game, like Boltons, there is nothing... I think Martin in the future should fill the gap about Bolton family because it's very interesting to read history and life styles of all familyes in this universe, every house is special about something and it's described: Targariens and dragons, Martells and their passion, GreyJoys and looting, Starks and their honour and loyality,  but about Boltons, we only know they like to flay and bring death, pain and destruction... But no details, no stories, no history why are they like this, when they started... :(   What do you think? Do you agree with me?

And who was father of his father?    Another Boltom presumably   Who was mother of Roose?   Never mentioned in TV show books or any other source.   How did they live?   by Braething?   How was life of boy Roose, did he have brothers or sisters?   As far as we know nope, and we dont know much about his life except that he carefully preserved his Houses Reputation while always beeing carefull to not be to obvious about it. The Boltons since Generations rule this way, by making everyone fear their cruelty.    What was his hobby? What did they do during days? What is he doing when he is not on battlefield?   Well he likes to cover himself in Leeches for Health Reasons. And he obvious is a huge Troll as we can see when he make it look liek cersei died to enjoy Jamies reaction. I guess he has a very sick humor just like his Son, however hes way more subtle about this. Other than that we dont really know about freetime activity, i guess we could also list falying.   How is life in Dreadfort?   Like life in most Nrothern Castle, just scarier as thats House Boltons Theme i think. We have no much information in the Book about how people live in the Dreadfort.   For how long is Roise Lord of Dreadfort?   Noone knows   Was he good to his wifes?   Only with his latest wife Walda, he states that he kinda likes her unlike his other two wifes. However their is no evidence that he enjoyed torutring people like Ramsay so i dont think he harmed them, his last wife before Fat Walda also died due a fever, so again their is no reason to belive he was cruel or something, he just didnt care about them as much as he do care about Walda.   Is there some other member of House Bolton?    Not as far as we know, at least not alive Members.     It would be strange that this old family have only two members, Roose and Ramsay...   Well Roose had another Son he was probably killed by Ramsay, also he has probably more relatives among the lower houses of the lonely Hills and Sheepheadhills Area, they were just not mentioned so far.  As you see there is no much information about Roose Bolton himself, which is also while their are some wild Theories about him.

Dreadfort,3a5zyp,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:56:32 2015 UTC,"Bolton:       Bolton (i/ˈbɒltən/ or locally [ˈbɜʏtn̩] ) is a town in Greater Manchester, in the North West of England. A former mill town, Bolton has been a production centre for textiles since Flemish weavers settled in the area during the 14th century, introducing a wool and cotton-weaving tradition. The urbanisation and development of the town largely coincided with the introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. Bolton was a 19th-century boomtown, and at its zenith in 1929 its 216 cotton mills and 26 bleaching and dyeing works made it one of the largest and most productive centres of cotton spinning in the world. The British cotton industry declined sharply after the First World War, and by the 1980s cotton manufacture had virtually ceased in Bolton.  Close to the West Pennine Moors, Bolton is 10 miles (16 km) northwest of the city of Manchester. It is surrounded by several smaller towns and villages that together form the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton, of which Bolton is the administrative centre. The town of Bolton has a population of 139,403, whilst the wider metropolitan borough has a population of 262,400. Historically a part of Lancashire, Bolton originated as a small settlement in the moorland known as Bolton le Moors. During the English Civil War the town was a Parliamentarian outpost in a staunchly Royalist region, and as a result Bolton was stormed by 3,000 Royalist troops led by Prince Rupert of the Rhine in 1644. In what became known as the Bolton Massacre, 1,600 residents were killed and 700 were taken prisoner.

I mean they (the show writers) really did him dirty. Stannis is probably the best General in the kingdom (Tywin not being counted) And his army was made to fight like a game of Total War on easy mode. Also According to the aerial shots Stannis had like maybe 200 (being very generous with the quick head count) and probably closer to 100 while the CGi Bolton army had them outnumbered and out horsed at least 3 to 1 and could have easily surrounded his entire force. Yet somehow the scene ends with Ramsay finishing off soldiers on a grassy hill. Stannis Marched from the woods towards the fields, Ramsay Rode from fields towards the woods. Which means for that soldier who surrendered to Ramsay he would have had to flee TOWARDS WINTERFELL AND TOWARDS THE ADVANCING ARMY. Meanwhile according to the show Stannis fled to the woods where apparently they just let him be. So Camera errors and PlotForce aside they didn't even show his death. (and apparently it is confirmed he is dead) which is just the worst possible Tv or movie Sin you can commit."

Dreadfort,39y76u,SerDaloftheVale,2,Tue Jun 16 12:48:33 2015 UTC,"Our most righteous and truly inspiring of lords, awes all those that set their eyes upon him.  Is it not understandable that such a gracious lord is so attractive that the masses flock to his righteous fury?"
Dreadfort,39y76u,hanexar,2,Tue Jun 16 12:53:21 2015 UTC,"Yes ! But I can't for the flayed flesh get back on front page. It's been a while.   Also, some flaying would sort out the cowards hiding among us."

Dreadfort,39yiyv,buuun,12,Mon Jun 15 20:51:55 2015 UTC,"Poor fool never saw it coming. Should have stayed on that shit-stained rock in the Narrow Sea, where he belonged."
Dreadfort,39yiyv,nostriano,7,Mon Jun 15 21:22:27 2015 UTC,That is an apt title for him.  You do our Lords Bolton proud.
Dreadfort,39yiyv,Mediumtim,3,Mon Jun 15 22:53:56 2015 UTC,"Thought it was just fitting, after that pompous and overly long title he's given himself.   What did the Halfman say about his nephew? Not Robert the Second, Aerys the Third. Seems quite fitting for uncle Stannis as well."
Dreadfort,39v8pw,sorzer,139,Mon Jun 15 02:09:04 2015 UTC,Ramsay even accepted that young man's surrender. A true class act.
Dreadfort,39v8pw,Shamhandler,61,Mon Jun 15 05:34:19 2015 UTC,Our True Born Lord put him out of his misery. It was a stab of mercy.
Dreadfort,39v8pw,CharmingRamsayBolton,22,Mon Jun 15 11:45:32 2015 UTC,Undoing his obligation to the false king was.
Dreadfort,39v8pw,Hedoin,12,Mon Jun 15 13:44:24 2015 UTC,Glorious Heir was just doing his lordly duty. He's much more charitable than any Tyrell ho.  Long live the Bolton dynasty!

Dreadfort,39v8pw,TcheZ,77,Mon Jun 15 05:13:00 2015 UTC,Lord Twenty's son. He's even more dangerous than Twenty Goodmen himself.
Dreadfort,39v8pw,hybridthm,33,Mon Jun 15 05:17:02 2015 UTC,"Forty, each good man needs a good man to ride. That way none of the  20 needed are tired when they get there. Lord Ramsay doesn't force march his men into a battle, knowing they'll be exhausted during the fighting. Unlike SOME people"
Dreadfort,39v8pw,mrbibs350,5,Mon Jun 15 05:56:50 2015 UTC,Like that time Roose did at the battle of the green fork. *disclaimer I am as loyal a reek as the rest of you
Dreadfort,39v8pw,NinjaStealthPenguin,13,Mon Jun 15 20:37:33 2015 UTC,You might want to find Sansa and Reek while you're at it. How did you let them escape and kill Myranda? Shame!
Dreadfort,39v8pw,Red-Droid-Blue-Droid,8,Mon Jun 15 06:45:20 2015 UTC,"Are you crazy? if Ramsay, allies with Mel, then mel could resurrect the flayed people, and we'd have a flaying party 24/7 365!  Plus you know, undead flayed army! Ramsay can be pretty good at...convincing."
Dreadfort,39v8pw,Draitex,6,Mon Jun 15 20:25:19 2015 UTC,Melisandre is a liar and a bitch. She burns innocent people for no reason and has no ability to predict the future.  Lord Ramsay WILL wear that filth's skin.
Dreadfort,39v8pw,mrbibs350,3,Mon Jun 15 20:55:31 2015 UTC,"Gentlemen! there is no need for this anger of yours! When I said ally, I meant it the same way, Reek is...Was an ally. Ramsay will carefully, f... work his diplomatic skills with them, and teach the red woman, the error of her ways."
Dreadfort,39v8pw,Draitex,4,Mon Jun 15 21:05:11 2015 UTC,"Though your sentiments are noble and keep with our honored traditions, the truth is that the Red Woman's filthy god has no power in the realm of the Old Gods and the First Men."
Dreadfort,39v8pw,nostriano,3,Mon Jun 15 23:09:44 2015 UTC,"Of course, hopefully Ramsay will atleast get to disipline her, false gods and sorcerry is not to be taken lightly if used against the glorious Boltons.  Our blades are sharp!"

Dreadfort,39v8pw,CharmingRamsayBolton,3,Mon Jun 15 13:01:42 2015 UTC,The silly man and his silly God RhoLOLer. We need to take that bitch Brienne of Tarth alive. Our Lord will be needing a new winter coat.
Dreadfort,39v8pw,TyroneusLannister,4,Mon Jun 15 15:31:23 2015 UTC,He would have enough skin to make a coat for his Lord father and himself from a beast of that size.
Dreadfort,39v8pw,Semper_nemo13,27,Mon Jun 15 16:47:33 2015 UTC,AND reek is showing Lady Sansa how much Lord Ramsay likes to hunt!
Dreadfort,39v8pw,purposeful_lurker,33,Mon Jun 15 05:14:49 2015 UTC,"And what a just and noble Lord he is, to have used his manners and accepted that boy's surrender before he ended his suffering."
Dreadfort,39v8pw,nostriano,5,Mon Jun 15 03:45:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  The pig Stannis would likely have burned the man alive, had the situation been reversed (however impossible or unlikely that may have been--this is a purely hypothetical discussion!).  Our Lord is a paragon of mercy."
Dreadfort,39v8pw,Tagard_McStone,18,Mon Jun 15 23:11:42 2015 UTC,Let's talk about Stannis though. We didn't get a confirm kill. What if Brienne spares him Catlyn Jaime style? Can he make a new army to come back?
Dreadfort,39v8pw,ExoSpecter,8,Mon Jun 15 04:34:13 2015 UTC,I'm glad we didn't see him die. Lord Ramsay still has many secrets to find from him.

Dreadfort,39v8pw,kittenpunter,18,Mon Jun 15 05:20:59 2015 UTC,I just hope our great Lord Ramsay's lady wife is excited to see his victorious return!
Dreadfort,39v8pw,Indeedee,9,Mon Jun 15 03:07:42 2015 UTC,Are we not assuming that the traitor reek and our lord's lady fell to their deaths in their escape? I'm genuinely curious

Dreadfort,39v8pw,TheGreatRaptor,0,Mon Jun 15 03:28:39 2015 UTC,We didn't see that Brienne actually kill him for good. It's entirely possible that Lord Bolton killed her moment before she stroke him dead.

The Northern future is ripe with opportunity, and I'm sure our Lord Bolton will be able to seize it. I cannot wait to see the further development of the proudest house of Westeros.  I am concerned about Reeks transgressions though, and I can but hope the Bitches track down that foul creature, for he has not only killed lord Ramsay's plaything, but taken, nay abducted his dear lady wife Sansa as well.   Knowing the way Ramsay gave her all the love and strength she could ever require, I know she will try to escape and return to Winterfell as soon as possible!"

You see throughout the show that Roose is one of the most pragmatic men in a position of power. It begins with his advising of Robb during his war and continues through the red wedding and his molding of Ramsay. He wants his house and the north to survive.

Dreadfort,398fda,mrbibs350,15,Wed Jun 10 03:33:46 2015 UTC,"This is what really fascinates me with the series and why the Boltons are so intriguing as a House. In the show and books, there are no black and white characters. Everyone is in a muddled grey. Even characters that most root for, such as Tyrion and   Jon Snow, have a certain dark side to them that they either mask or hide. The Boltons appear to be an evil House just by looking at their outward elements, but they're just as ambitious as any others.   Lord Roose Bolton, just like anyone else, is dealt the cards in the beginning and has both advantages and disadvantages. He just knows how to play it right."

They've always been just as brutal as anyone else, and they didn't get to be Kings of Winter through honor -- they were mean enough to make sure nobody (except us) would challenge their rule for centuries.  That said, when we challenged them, we did it right.   The enmity between the Starks and Boltons went back to the Long Night itself, it is claimed. The wars between these two ancient families were legion, and not all ended in victory for House Stark. King Royce Bolton, Second of His Name, is said to have taken and burned Winterfell itself; his namesake and descendant Royce IV (remembered by history as Royce Redarm, for his habit of plunging his arm into the bellies of captive foes to pull out their entrails with his bare hand) did the same three centuries later.

Dreadfort,39405l,Mediumtim,5,Tue Jun 9 14:02:15 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this. The mountain burned children alive, Jeoffrey had children killed and Reek killed children. Ramsay has only ever killed men guilty of grave crimes, like the traitors at Moat Caitlin who killed their commander and the ironborn who invaded his home and tried to abduct his pet against his own will and the Ironborn who betrayed their lord at Winterfell ...  (so many dead Iron Islanders, I only now realize)  Our lord Ramsay might respect the sheer willfulness of the pretender, but I'm sure he is as disgusted by the infanticide as most honorable men."

Our lord and his trueborn heir, on the other hand, have never had the love of the common people. They fear our banner and our words.

Shireen Baratheon died in a horrifying manner to please a god that doesn't exist so her pretender father can fail a siege against a hardened, experience battle commander and Warden of the North. As devoted followers of the old gods, it would behoove us to say a prayer by a heart tree so she may find peace in death.   Stannis Baratheon will see justice for this and for his many many other crimes. Lord Roose and Lord Ramsay will see to it. As for the people flocking to the Bolton banners, let them come. They are seeing the error of their ways and Lord Bolton is merciful and forgiving.   Your devotion to the North and to House Bolton does you credit, friend.

Dreadfort,38zi6n,nostriano,48,Mon Jun 8 03:46:57 2015 UTC,"What do you mean? We've always been the good guys. I'm not sure what you're on about. For the first time, I actually understood what people around this site see in Stannis. Now that I think about it, he burns dissenters and all kinds of innocent people. He even wanted to burn his own son-in-law who was twice related to him by blood. Now, he totally burns his daughter! He is the MANNIS! Admittedly, burning is nowhere near as cool as flaying but I'm just glad that Ramsay's opponent will be a worthy one. His hide will be a glorious one for our trueborn Lord to wear as a cloak."

Dreadfort,38zi6n,EGOO9609,27,Mon Jun 8 07:40:48 2015 UTC,Stannis hides behind a false shield of honor while committing attrocities which portrays his true nature. Our lords are at peace with their own nature which some people are unable to reconcile with their own morally bankrupt nature. When Roose Bolton sits upon the throne they will bask in his glory of truth.
Dreadfort,38zi6n,badattitude4u,25,Mon Jun 8 04:12:41 2015 UTC,"Good is relative. Ned Stark was ""good"". Robb Stark was ""good"". Neither was fit to rule. House Bolton will win because it can, being good is incidental."

Dreadfort,38zi6n,monsterlynn,9,Mon Jun 8 09:22:07 2015 UTC,"We've always been the good guys, you were blind and couldn't see it, that's all.  Lord Roose saved the North from war, and from Robb's naivete.  He sacrificed his own honor to make his house great, and by doing so he brought peace to the seven kingdoms. What did Stannis do ? He brought war, and chaos.  He didn't have the balls to kill his own brother himself so he resorted to black magic, like a coward... Lord Roose had the guts to look in the eyes of the man he was killing, and he did it fair and square without any tricks.  Stannis tried to kill Gendry/Edric and killed his own daughter, even the worst mother in GOT said ""we can't do this"" yet,he who spoke of how much he loved his daughter, did nothing to stop her murder.  Our Lord,on the other hand, brought up and even legimized Ramsay, he found his son the best wife he could ever hope for and always gave him advice on how to rule peacefully."

To kinslay is grave enough, but to kinslay by putting your child to the stake and setting it alight? It truly takes a monster to do such a thing.  I sit happily knowing that neither our good Lord Bolton or Lord Ramsay would ever fall to such darkness."
Dreadfort,390ckl,Hyperiok,8,Mon Jun 8 10:03:27 2015 UTC,"When our Lords must use extreme measures, it is always dealt out as just punishment. This horror from the flaming Stag is simply an affront to everything that a good person holds dear. To take the life of one's sole heir, at the behest of a preening, whore of an Asshai necromantrix, perverts the very nature of kin and the bonds of blood.   Our good Lord Warden had the grace and sense to see the worth in our good Lord and Heir Ramsay, though he came to him by natural means.   That the would-be usurper Baratheon could not see the inherently precious treasure of his own trueborn heir only speaks to his degradation and ultimate unworthiness."
Dreadfort,390ckl,Hyperiok,5,Mon Jun 8 10:16:35 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but to horrifically butcher his own kin for the foul purpose of usurping our good Lord from his rightful place as Warden of the North, appointed by none other than the King? It is unfathomably sick.   For all his talk of the law of the lands, this Baratheon seems awfully eager to both go against the laws of the gods by kinslaying, in order to go against the laws of the kings by usurping. Despicable."
Dreadfort,390ckl,SharMarali,3,Mon Jun 8 10:21:18 2015 UTC,"For certain, this is the crux of the affront to the sensibilities of those that adhere to the rule of law -- both that of nature and of man. This immolated Stag is a monstrous beast lusting after the unlawful crown of the rebellious tyrant at all costs. It sickens me to contemplate what desires his fetid heart harbors."

If our glorious trueborn Lord Ramsay can torch the kinslaying scum's camp once, there's nothing to stop him doing the same sort of thing again. And again."
Dreadfort,390ckl,VanDerVeale,2,Mon Jun 8 17:18:16 2015 UTC,"It was a genious move indeed, but now ... what is left? No food, no siege weapons, dwindling numbers.

Devoted, loving, willing to pay for his crimes with his own flesh and bone and he's lived through seeing his son burnt alive only to find out soon what has happened to the darling princess.  Curse you Stannis, to think I once saw in you a great king. Only our Lord Roose remains fit to occupy the iron throne now."
Dreadfort,390ckl,nixiedust,3,Mon Jun 8 18:27:53 2015 UTC,"The Half-Hand of the false king time and again has remained loyal to him. Though the loss of his sons, the discounting of his council in favor of the fever visions of a foreign witch, and now the betrayal of his rightful affection for the sole heir to Dragonstone.   He would make an excellent bannerman to House Bolton, and perhaps show that creature Reek a thing or two about the true nature of loyalty."

It truly is proof of the pretender Stag's unfitness to rule that he would sacrifice his own blood to the decadent god of a foreign land simply because he was outwitted by a true son of the North, as our good Lord Ramsay has shown with such exemplary tactics. Such desperate kinslaying abominations are surely harbingers of defeat. I take solace in the knowledge that our Lords of the North would never stoop to such barbaric blood magic as this bitter, usurperous, fanatical creature from Dragonstone has done."

The Boltons are somewhat responsible for the last Baratheon heir being burned alive, and they're about to end the House completely. And House Bolton secured the North by marrying a Stark girl, betraying the Lannisters.  The Boltons are the best friends a Targaryen could possibly have. They've done more for Daenerys' campaign in Westeros in one year than anyone else (including Daenerys) has in 20."

It would be character assassination of the worst kind, because even in the books Stannis declares Shireen as his heir. Burning Shireen would undermine the whole character of Stannis and what he stands for."
Dreadfort,38xjfq,Dr_Doctors,22,Sun Jun 7 18:36:14 2015 UTC,"The exact reference, in case people were wondering:  BOOK SPOILERS, PEOPLE   ""It may be that we shall lose this battle,"" the king said grimly. ""In Braavos you may hear that I am dead. It may even be true. You shall find my sellswords nonetheless.""  The knight hesitated. ""Your Grace, if you are dead — ""  "" — you will avenge my death, and seat my daughter on the Iron Throne. Or die in the attempt.""   I don't think he'll do it.  Selyse?  Probably.  That bitch would burn her daughter in a heartbeat, and expect Stannis to be greatful, too."
Dreadfort,38xjfq,Augustus1125,18,Sun Jun 7 23:49:40 2015 UTC,...How did that play out for you?
Dreadfort,38xjfq,mrbibs350,6,Mon Jun 8 02:30:44 2015 UTC,Ramsay knew. He always knows.
Dreadfort,38xjfq,PirateDuchess,2,Mon Jun 8 03:55:52 2015 UTC,"(OOC also) In the books we aren't even to that point yet. Even in the TWOW released chapter (obviously spoilers are coming, people) Stannis is still sitting in camp, Ramsay is still marching on him, and Stannis JUST got a loan to hire sell swords (and poor poor baby Theon).  D&D knows where GRRM is going in TWOW so it's possibly a book spoiler if Stannis does burn his daughter...which, to me, would make sense since Mel has told him multiple times how many people he would forsake for the Throne.   I've never thought he'd be a good king but, murdering your own kid? I guess we got a taste of it when he was willing to murder his brother's child, too (Gendry)."
Dreadfort,38xjfq,badattitude4u,4,Sun Jun 7 18:41:52 2015 UTC,"You raise a good point. The show may very well be overtaking the books by now. It would be a huge game changer. People who would otherwise be rooting for Stannis to take the Iron Throne may well change their tune once his methods for getting there were known. It was one thing when Ser Gregor Clegane killed the Targ children but another altogether for a man to kill his own child. Many like to think of Stannis as completely just but if he does this, that blows that notion into pieces. He's just as Machiavellian as the rest, and in his mind the ends absolutely justify the means.   Edit: As for Mel's hand in this, I would like to think it would motivate Davos to stick a dagger through her heart. I hate that bitch."
Dreadfort,38xjfq,nourez,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:48:05 2015 UTC,"Many like to think of Stannis as completely just...in his mind the ends absolutely justify the means.   This, 1000 times. Total unadulterated justice is cruel and without mercy, a description many would not far from how Stannis deals with people, both those loyal to him and not. He is so set on his rights to the Throne, he actually never stops to think if he would even make a good king (aka ""so busy trying to see if he could, he never stopped to think he if should""). No, it's just anyone who opposes him is evil and worthy of death, and those who want to help? Also worthy of dying for him.  It's a twisted outlook, and he's a cold, friendless man who would have served the realm better by joining the Night's watch (though not as Lord Commander, god no) and going out to kill Others."
Dreadfort,38xjfq,SharMarali,2,Sun Jun 7 19:01:38 2015 UTC,It's not really character assisnation considering he's killed family members before because it helped him get closer to the throne.

I bet he is taking 20 men to burn camp, scatter horses, ruin food and other supplies, etc. You know, soften up Stannis' army in a big way with just a few folks. Our Lord is bold, but he is careful with his own life (he is the rightful heir).  Plus it ties in perfectly with Roose's plan; if Ramsay can ruin their supplies, Stannis will either have to retreat to the Wall, or march. And if he marches? He won't have the supplies to siege to Winterfell and will have to march right past.  And if Roose wants to, he can harry Stannis's men all the way through the North until his sell swords abandon him, his supplies are gone, his few friends lack faith, and his whole effort for the Throne is lost.

He could have not attacked King's Landing. And he could have by passed Winterfell and altogether on his march, or just stayed at the Wall.  But no. The man may be iron, but he is brittle, the way iron gets. He'll break before he bends. I'm sure our Lord Ramsay will enjoy enabling it."

Robb Stark on the other hand only wanted the north to be it's own country, with the north behind im i will never understand why he didn't side with Robb.   Invading Kings landing - i can't see what else he could have done  If he liberates winterfell, the north may rally behind him, he has atleast some bannermen in the north.

Which is laughable. Aryes was the rightful king, dead. Rhaegar was the rightful heir, killed. His heirs? Killed. Stannis can be the rightful heir all he wants, but I think the Baratheons have shown that's a dangerous thing to be. Hope he has a death wish.  Stannis didnt side with Robb because Stannis was greedy for the whole country. That said, Robb did want the North and Riverrun and the Vale. But Stannis wouldn't have let him be king of the Wolfswood. Absolutely unable to bend.  And people want this man for a king. Smh.  I dont care if Stannis is Robert's heir. He'd make a terrible king.   And what is this talk of ""liberating"" Winterfell? Am I suddenly not in /r/Dreadfort?

They both have the right intentions, but would see whole villages and cities burn to protect an ideal. Ned Stark likesld his ideals, too, but he was a better man, unwilling to play politics but would never see a child harmed under his care...or people burned for no crime but having another god.   Ned was a better man than Stannis, but he made similar mistakes. Stannis won't play politics, and Stannis is also cruel and easily led astray by this red woman who had him kill his own brother.

Dreadfort,37jn8s,Paraplueschi,3,Thu May 28 07:25:52 2015 UTC,Perfect answer.  One of GRRM's main thematic points is that humans can out-evil monsters any day of the week.  Bolton culture is prima facie evidence of that.

Dreadfort,37jn8s,Ramsayreek,3,Thu May 28 14:52:00 2015 UTC,"Personally, I really like all the old mythos/legends of the realm.   I want Patchface to deliver messages from the Drowned God. I want Bran to have been fed Jojen paste for prophetic magicks. I want there to be a Kraken. I want to believe in the Lannister Voice passed down from the Trickster. I want the Faceless Men test run of Hardhome to be true. I want more information of all of the Houses that date back to the First Men, including Starks, Blackwoods, Daynes, and if the Boltons have some sort of dark past dating to the Age of Heroes, I am cool with it. I will always have a soft spot for Bolt-On, as it was one of the first farfetched theories I saw that was completely new, that was best described as ""By the Old Gods, this is insane, but completely consistent, and plausible in its own way""."
Dreadfort,37jn8s,faswich,1 point,Thu May 28 18:36:02 2015 UTC,"Great point.  I love the fact that GRRM seeded his mythology with a bunch of stuff, some of which might turn out to be true, but much of which won't.  It would make for a ridiculously shitty fantasy series if everything he put in as old stories or beliefs turned out to be true all at the same time.  So the fact that nobody knows which prophecies are real (because he does uphold many tropes) and which prophecies are bullshit (because he does subvert tropes) both serves to A) keep us guessing, B) make the point that fantasy fiction tropes are both fun and silly, and C) create a world that's realistically balanced in terms of what's destined vs. what's merely random"
Dreadfort,37jn8s,elbruce,3,Wed Jun 3 10:29:00 2015 UTC,"I do not believe in Bolt-on. I think the Boltons are simply more isolated from the customs of the South, believe in the old ways of their house and the North, and have a history of cruelty and violence. The flaying may have to do with the skinchanging of the Starks and the long rivalry between Bolton and Stark houses. Would definitely be interesting to get more information about the rivalry. At the beginning of the series there is only Roose and Ramsay left for House Bolton, and there are 6 Stark children. I am still scratching my head that the Northern families in general don't have more children. At this rate the Sand Snakes and Baratheon Bastards will outlive everyone on numbers alone. shakes head"
Dreadfort,37jn8s,FlayThemAll,6,Thu May 28 19:59:56 2015 UTC,I think it'd be cool if it was martin's plan the whole time. Maybe have his immortality some how mesh with bran's storyline. I also want the Boltons to be more consequential to the story than the northern placeholders that they seem to be right now. Ramsay's quote about bastards rising high in the world kind of sums up the rise of the house since the red wedding. It'd be cool to see their control of the north be legitimized by breaking stannis

Though well past forty, he was as yet unwrinkled, with scarce a line to tell of the passage of time. His lips were so thin that when he pressed them together they seem to vanish altogether. There was an agelessness about him, a stillness; on Roose Bolton’s face, rage and joy looked much the same."

Dreadfort,3747xw,amartz,9,Sun May 24 21:38:46 2015 UTC,Some of the armor in the show is impractical enough without having Renly with antlers and Tywin in a lion helmet.
Dreadfort,3747xw,stratus1469,13,Sun May 24 22:10:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly I always thought of that kind of armor as a banner of sorts. Something the people can rally around when they see their king fighting along side them. I think it'd be kind of important. Robb wouldn't need anything cause he had Grey Wind, but I think like 12-15 inch antlers might be something of an inspiring sight for the soldiers around you (and besides when have the Baratheon bros ever cared about anything besides being flashy on the battlefield). And Tywin was always described as being in more of a commanding position than in the fray, so his helmet wouldn't need to be as practical. I always imagined Rhaegar's dragon as a hood ornament on a suit of all black armor."

Dreadfort,36hakt,ClassicFlavour,7,Wed May 20 08:10:15 2015 UTC,It's only upside down in the show. It's right-side up in the novel.
Dreadfort,36hakt,Spiralyst,3,Tue May 19 20:40:38 2015 UTC,The prospect of getting in to the novels again to find out seems daunting...so here's some artwork done pre-Game of Thrones on HBO. The sigil is right-side up.
Dreadfort,36hakt,Spiralyst,3,Wed May 20 01:51:18 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I think it's looks more badass/menacing inverted. I really enjoy that change in the show."
Dreadfort,36hakt,Spiralyst,2,Wed May 20 04:27:29 2015 UTC,"They might have made the change b/c of how they did the Ramsay/Theon plot.   In the books you are 2-3 chapters into ADWD with a character named Reek before you figure out it's Theon.   In the show they knew everyone would recognize Alfie Allen, so they decided to hide who Ramsay was (Iwan had to tell everyone he was playing a character named 'Boy' until damn near season 4 was out).  Seeing Theon up on that cross, and seeing the house Bolton banner with a right-side-up flayed man might have triggered a very quick recognition of at least what house 'Boy' was from.   Would upside down make that big of a difference? Well, I know tons of show watchers who saw Theon...getting flayed...on a giant wooden cross...after staring at upside down flayed men on Bolton banners for 2-3 seasons, and never put two and two together."
Dreadfort,36hakt,Duh_And_Or_Hello_,2,Wed May 20 04:30:00 2015 UTC,Good perspective. I already knew what was coming so I couldn't see it in that context.
Dreadfort,36hakt,Spiralyst,3,Wed May 20 04:32:59 2015 UTC,^ correct. Red flayed man on pink field.   Roose wears a pink cloak with red embroidered tear drops.

Why shouldn't he confirm Bolton's place as Warden, sanction Sansa's wedding, and just go south?"
Dreadfort,35lhfq,mrbibs350,1 point,Mon May 11 19:22:21 2015 UTC,"Because Roose holds that position from the Lannisters. If he switched sides to support Stannis, the other Wardens would come after him for that."

Dreadfort,35cw65,TommyJawDrop,25,Sat May 9 04:25:43 2015 UTC,"That said, the actors for Ramsay, Theon and Sansa have all had interviews where they talk about a scene that was incredibly hard to film; the set crew was freaked out, and Iwan (Ramsay) talks about how he had to talk himself into the scene by telling himself it wasn't real.   In the books, it's Jeyne Poole getting raped. I dont know how far the show would take this with Sansa. Iwan and Alfie said viewers were going to lose it, and hate Ramsay even more, and hate Theon all over again (in the books, Theon is made to help in Jeyne Poole's rape).  But Sophie has said Ramsay can't be that rough with Sansa b/c of her name, because (in so many words) it isn't Jayne Poole, its an actual Stark and Roose couldn't have Ramsay flaying her and turning the whole North against them. They have little enough control as it is.  So...no idea of this is Sansa or Myranda. Guess we'll find out soon. Can't find the age of Myranda's actress, but I also can't find the quote OP is talking about on IMDB (though I am on mobile)."

Dreadfort,35cw65,TommyJawDrop,10,Sat May 9 13:02:47 2015 UTC,"(Spoiler for books, maybe not for show)  In the book he does. And Theon has a moment beneath the weirwood tree where he remembers himself as Theon long enough to help Jeyne Poole escape.   I think b/c they want Sansa to become Little Finger 2 they might play this differently, but I think Theon will get a moment of redemption and remembering himself, if not in that exact way."

Someone did it before to include Lady Stoneheart (spoiler) in season 4 but she never made an appearance. This is all based of the a 4chan leak (take 1 grain of salt) where someone who claims to have seen the whole season gave rough outlines for each location/character.  Having said that, it seems kinda obvious some sort of rape, flaying fetish bedding will play out in whichever episode has the wedding. I would be surprised if they do outright nudity though."
Dreadfort,35cw65,teh1knocker,1 point,Sat May 9 21:09:57 2015 UTC,That synopsis from 4chan was bullshit. However Ramsay and Sansa do consummate their marriage in episode 6 with Reek watching. This comes from the reliable source recapped.com and not some random 4chan commenter

Yes, when I read the books I was a huge fan of Roose. From the pale, colorless eyes, battle prowess, soft-spoken authority, and penchant for blood-red meats, I was drawn to him as a character. Ramsay is a sociopath at minimum, and Iwan is doing a great job portraying it. I enjoyed his performance in Misfits and here as well.  All that being said, when there's talk of savage rape of a 16 year old and cheering for that fact, I suspend my mantle of, ""Hell yeah go Boltons"" and instead reality sets in.

Basically its four lengths of fabric (I'm not sure what as I bought it a year ago) sowed together to sort of sit on/around my shoulders and come down to just above my feet. Running along the top it has a little rope thing which I can tie together to help keep it on, although it sits quite nicely even being undone. As for the fur its a rectangle of fake fur that is attached at two points near the edges of the top, originally it was attached at the center as well but it came loose and it turns out that its better that way because I can pull it up/away from my neck if I get too hot or cold.  This is how it looks from the back."

Dreadfort,31dhrf,Azor_ash_hi,1 point,Sun Apr 5 12:22:49 2015 UTC,Here's the link of people discussing the Ramsay/Sansa wedding on r/asoiaf. Apparently it's legit:  http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/31fj68/spoilers_all_based_on_the_4_early_released/
Dreadfort,31dhrf,SHAZBOT_VGS,1 point,Sun Apr 5 01:40:44 2015 UTC,all speculation based on the few scene from trailers. In one of them we see knights of the vales entering winterfell.
Dreadfort,31dhrf,khellick,2,Sat Apr 4 07:28:57 2015 UTC,"This time it's more than speculation, apparently. It's leaked information from the people who got the screeners, and from the reaction of the mods of Westeros.org and WOTW, who got to see the screeners, it seems that it's indeed legit. If you want more info about the leaks PM me."
Dreadfort,31dhrf,nk1992,2,Sat Apr 4 08:45:15 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit divided on this. I'm happy because it cements Lord Ramsay's position as Lord of Winterfell, but I'm happy because he would be marrying one of the Stark dogs."
Dreadfort,31dhrf,lotictrance,2,Sat Apr 4 04:17:38 2015 UTC,Why would you be happy about him marrying one of the Stark dogs?
Dreadfort,31dhrf,lotictrance,1 point,Sat Apr 4 15:58:12 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt Ramsay and Sansa will be getting married. If they do, I'm worried for Ramsay's sake -- D&D know the ending and I'm fairly sure at this point Sansa basically has plot armor, she's too important. I'm with you that LF wouldn't touch that arrangement with a ten-foot pole.  I read the threads after the screenings of S05E01, but I don't recall if Sansa herself shows up to Winterfell. I'm thinking what we see in the trailers is what happens -- knights of the Vale go to Winterfell for one reason or another. It doesn't have to mean LF and Sansa go with them, especially now that we have the Alayne chapter from TWOW, which is likely to be relevant to episode 1.   I'm sticking to my guns that Ramsay is going to marry Myranda, who will be posing as fArya. It's the most likely scenario story-wise."
Dreadfort,31dhrf,xxybby,3,Sat Apr 4 15:21:52 2015 UTC,The new Alayne chapters only makes the marriage between Sansa and Lord Ramsay even more likely to happen IMHO. Maybe it's no coincidence Myranda is named that way if she plays the role of the jealous Myranda Royce.
Dreadfort,31dhrf,xxybby,1 point,Sat Apr 4 15:57:10 2015 UTC,"Hm, possibly. It would make sense on that point I suppose.   I hope it doesn't go that way for either character tbh. If it does, I see Ramsay getting killed (obviously don't want that). And I like the way Sansa's going atm."
Dreadfort,31dhrf,shitsfuckedupalot,2,Sat Apr 4 16:19:26 2015 UTC,"Just saying Sansa has no plot armor whatsoever. In fact, she's almost certainly going to die in TWOW.  She wasn't on GRRM's list of favorite characters that he would never kill. That's the big one. Also, she has a chapter in this next book that is supposed to shock us. It's been a while since a really unexpected character death. I feel like sansa's would be the most organic and that's why i'm almost certain she's doomed."

Edit: To add my own two cents, I'm still pulling for the ""Winterfell Worker"" to fill Jeyne's role in some capacity. I think Myranda exists for a couple reasons. First, she's another speaking role for Ramsay to play off of during his adventures with Theon. Seeing Ramsay continually pull off the same antics solely in the company of sullen Bolton men would be repetitive. Myranda makes the scenes more dynamic. Second, most of the shows female characters are strong and sympathetic in some capacity, and this will only continue as we see Cersei's decline in season 5. Myranda is a thoroughly shitty person, shown to be jealous, sadistic and manipulative. She adds variety to a female cast that is heavy on ""damsels finding their own way out of distress.""   The Sansa route is possible, and a lot of the evidence does point that way. It would require a lot of careful plotting by D&D though. I agree with your take that this would mess with the character arc, and let's not forget that it would land Sansa back in the Lannister sphere of influence. That would raise dozens of more questions that the show would need to answer.  So I'm hoping D&D is hiding their hand well and this Winterfell Worker is our ""Arya Stark."""
Dreadfort,2x3sv5,amartz,1 point,Wed Feb 25 14:05:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah like they hid their hand on Lady Stoneheart?   the Ironborn plot has been cut,Jamie is going to Dorne rather the Riverlands. I am almost positive they confirmed Myranda for fake Arya...I remember being outraged."
Dreadfort,2x3sv5,amartz,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:15:53 2015 UTC,"If Myranda does turn out to play that part, I would still much prefer it over Sansa."
Dreadfort,2x3sv5,Hmcykbux,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:29:05 2015 UTC,It would of been nice to just have it be..you know..Jeyne Poole.
Dreadfort,2x3sv5,Hmcykbux,3,Thu Feb 26 03:59:06 2015 UTC,"Nah, too many characters and too many locations will not produce viewers' engagement. By merging all those storylines and cutting some less important they are able to give them time and focus they deserve. I hope they will take advantage of that."
Dreadfort,2x3sv5,Hmcykbux,1 point,Thu Feb 26 12:21:20 2015 UTC,"Mmm,I disagree. A lot of what makes that series so great is that everything mentioned is important. As far as this plot...this is the result of them knowing what happens down the road,and deciding not to set it up.  They casted Jeyne in season 1 and mentioned her(mostly through her father who was also casted)all they would need to do is mention she dissapeared after Ned's ""treason"". If you noticed they half assed this story telling ""strategy"" when it came to the showdown between the mountain and the viper,of course that is a bigger event and plot arc than this...but they just rushed in a few scenes and reminded the audience of him.   Jeyne re emerging as fake arya was subtle...I am gravely dissapointed in the route this show does to that subtility. I understand that the masses just want to be entertained and not think too hard but my god,going out of your way to create new arcs,new characters that dont make sense...AND then replacing concrete characters that re emerge through out the series?   Seems pointless to me,give the shownlys some credit and dont just let the characters announce their intentions.Dont drastically change characters and plots and then worry about how you will fix how this effects later plots AFTER youve already done it."
Dreadfort,2x3sv5,E-Nezzer,2,Thu Feb 26 22:47:42 2015 UTC,"Significant problem that season 2-4 had to face was too many storylines in which characters rarely interacted with more than one important character (that's why they liked to spend SO MUCH time in King's Landing). So, a lot of times, we were basically just jumping from one location to another without giving some storylines a proper attention and characters any noticeable development. Especially s2 and 4 could sometimes get really disjointed in certain parts from a narrative standpoint and eventually fail to merit genuine interest and produce dramatic value. So I'm glad that they decided to make the story smaller, even if they have to make few changes here and there. And these are not the only arcs that are modified; Tyrion's travelling with Varys and is meeting Dany sooner, Jaime's in Dorne, Littlefinger is going to KL, Jaqen is coming back in Arya's storyline etc.  Jeyne Poole would become a random nobody on the show. I'm interested in her fate in the books, because she's important to Theon's growth and development and crucial to his journey. She's not interesting as a stand-alone character. Something like that will work on page, but it will not translate to screen, especially with so little time to do so. Do you really think that people would care about Jeyne's fate? They casted some random extra as her in S1 and mentioned her exactly ONCE. I wouldn't care about her if I haven't read the books. In regards to Mountain, they reminded about him many times throughout the whole series, people knew who he was and remembered him well. So it's quite different from Jeyne who show-watchers doesn't even know exists. I really don't know what you're expecting, honestly.  D&D don't want to just provide an entertainment, they want to provide a coherent story and more of that subtlety - that you are talking about - by narrowing attention and allowing to focus on nuances and details that they not always are able to because there's just too much story to cover. That show doesn't have 26 1h30-long episodes, it has 10 50-minutes long episodes. And it will be a lot more interesting for me to see Theon interact with another significant character instead of fArya and Sansa interacting with Theon and the Boltons than just chilling around the Vale with only LF and with no immediate purpose. And lastly, since they know where this is all going they certainly know what they're doing more than us."
Dreadfort,2x3sv5,14thCenturyHood,0,Fri Feb 27 00:46:58 2015 UTC,"Myranda is a more significant character than Jeyne Poole? Who the hell is this chick? Ramsay's girlfriend? It is just unnecessary. The whole point of them presenting fArya is that they kept the claim alive that they still had Arya Stark as a captive this entire time.  I don't think she is a random nobody,Myranda as fArya will take away a lot of the great things about that story arc.   Also I understand completely,they don't have enough time or the budget to hash out what you can on paper,it doesn't come off the same in a different meduim. I can understand that,but these changes they make...a handful of them seem like its just complicating the story arcs they tried to make less complicated. They've stated they know how the series end,and both mediums will get to the same place just in different ways. Keep that in mind the next time they kill off a character in the show before the books do it (Jojen)    a coherent story and more of that subtlety - that you are talking about -    They must have a different idea of subtlety (The Mountain,Cersei,Qyburn scene)"
Dreadfort,2x3sv5,Hmcykbux,2,Fri Feb 27 03:04:58 2015 UTC,"Ehh, misunderstanding. Of course, I wasn't talking about Myranda, she's a nobody filling in for Bastard Boys and I don't think that will change, will probably be killed off this season. The idea she's going to pose as fArya is IMO certifiably crazy, it won't generate any dramatic interest and tension, so it has no chance of actually happening. I can see some other directions they could go with that character, but her as fArya is not one of them. I'm almost completely positive that they're going with Sansa, it's happening, whether people like it or not and no matter how much non-believers are denying it and lying to themselves. Yes, it's a huge change, but it's also a hugely interesting change and makes sense from a dramatic and narrative standpoint. Every snippet of information we get makes it more and more believable, all we need at this point is some definitive confirmation, which we obviously won't get (probably even in trailers) till season starts airing. And few days ago recapped.com, which provides info concerning celeb nudity on screen - and has been previously 100% on point in their GOT rumours - posted a rumour that a shot of Sansa in a bath from a trailer is actually before her wedding which will take place and will be consummated. Who else would she marry, Harry the Heir? Well, nope, they didn't cast him.   They must have a different idea of subtlety   Probably they do."
Dreadfort,2x3sv5,UnreasonablyDownvotd,1 point,Fri Feb 27 15:35:46 2015 UTC,"You probably read some baseless rumor by a paranoid book fan, because nobody said Myranda is going to take fArya's place.  And I don't think the Ironborn plot has been cut, maybe only contrived and postponed. They can't just forget about the Greyjoys, especially when Reek is still a major character and Yara is still relevant. They might cut the uncles, though."
Dreadfort,2x3sv5,Hmcykbux,5,Fri Feb 27 01:23:44 2015 UTC,"I'm betting that it's going to be ""Winterfell Worker"", seeing as the girl chosen to play that role bears a similar appearance to Arya, and that GoT has kept roles vague in the past (like Iwan Rheon being cast as ""boy"")"
Dreadfort,2x3sv5,Scootamoon,2,Wed Feb 25 16:37:10 2015 UTC,"Iwan Rheon got cast as ""boy"" because his identity throughout the season was a secret. That shouldn't be a case with fArya."
Dreadfort,2x3sv5,E-Nezzer,5,Thu Feb 26 12:35:23 2015 UTC,"I don't like the Sansa switch at all.  That wouldn't make much sense, it would make just a bit of sense, but not much.  It is actually a bit harder and dumber to say Sansa is Arya if you have Sansa than legitimizing her and setting her as Lady of Winterfell.  People say that she is a wanted criminal and would be not accepted and required to answer to the crown, but:  1) The north would really be more into the real Sansa and that could make some Stark bannerman actually pledge loyalty to Bolton, that could make a real massive north strength and independence in affirming Sansa protection and innocence on Joffreys death.  2) Even if she were found guilt and sent back to KL all would be still just fine for Ramsay, as he could re-marry her to him and take Winterfell as Lord anyway, and he could even try to squeeze a son in the process.  This all would be stronger and easier than making Sansa pass as Arya.  And it would blow Allayne+LF storyline to the skies,   I see no point in doing this change.  But, I may be overseeing some interesting outcome and rationalization on this. We'll see."
Dreadfort,2x3sv5,Hmcykbux,6,Wed Feb 25 16:59:53 2015 UTC,"If the speculation about Sansa turns out to be true, I'm seriously in two minds about it:  On the one hand, I liked the ""Alayne"" subplot from the fourth book, and her scheming with Littlefinger to take control of the Vale. It'd be a shame not to have this in the HBO show - that being said, the last season already compressed most of Sansa's AFFC plot into the eighth episode, so there's not really much to do for her. I guess she could be at Winterfell for season five, and then pick up the book-plot from TWOW again in season six. Still, having her end up as a domestic-abuse victim again sorta ruins her character and puts her back on square one, so I'm a bit doubtful about this.  On the other hand, making Sansa the victim of ""I'll even do it with the dog"" will probably be the most crazy extreme thing on the show this far. The internet will explode if this happens, and Ramsay will be light-years more evil than Joffrey in an instant. The fan shitstorm over the Season 4 rape scene will utterly pale in comparison to this. Having the innocent ingenue Sansa end up in this situation is like something Marquis de Sade would've written."
Dreadfort,2x3sv5,BewilderedFingers,3,Wed Feb 25 12:50:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think that marrying Sansa off to Ramsay has to necessarily mean that she will meet Jeyne Poole's fate. She's not an innocent ingenue anymore and she would go to the Boltons out of her own choice as some part of the bigger Littlefinger scheme that she would actively - not passively - participate in. And judging by the fact that they did not cast Manderly and Lady Dustin she could somehow fill in their shoes too. Sophie Turner described her traumatic scene as 6 on 1-10 scale, so she's certainly not talking about that . If she's, indeed, filling in for fArya, it will not happen. And, besides, my overall impression of show Ramay is that he's not as deranged and insane as book Ramsay, seeing how Myranda still has all of her skin attached to her body.  Overall, I like the idea, because this kind of compression of two storylines allows to focus more on specific characters (that also happens with Dany/Tyrion and Jaime/Dorne) instead of jumping from one to hundreds of locations. It makes for a good television even if it's a dramatic deviation."
Dreadfort,2x3sv5,carpe-jvgvlvm,2,Wed Feb 25 17:40:07 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine Littlefinger ever handing Sansa over to the Boltons though, knowing what he knows about them."

You can see the dozens of hooks in the skin map, almost like a Dreamcatcher net, stretching it along the frame. The map seems very old - it only shows the North, with the Dreadfort at the center. I'd guess the map was made back when the North was an isolated kingdom of its own. Maybe it's even older, an ancient relic from the pre-Andal period.  It looks pretty useless as a map, since it shows a very limited northeastern area of Westeros, until you remember that the Boltons were kings in the old pre-Andal days. The borders of this map are the ancient borders of the Bolton kingdom.  The upper and lower ""handles"" of the map's frame are made of human bone."

Dreadfort,2s7wha,scarletcat,58,Mon Jan 12 23:18:53 2015 UTC,"Tortured ? Lord Ramsay merely peeled a few bits and removed a few others (which Reek didn't even need to begin with).  Lord Ramsay has been so merciful ...  He didn't even kill Reek, he just made a few alterations.  He even gave Reek a reward,washed his back and refrained from drowning him....  This thread is unacceptable and in very bad taste."
Dreadfort,2s7wha,FrightFright,14,Tue Jan 13 10:17:30 2015 UTC,"A quiet land, a peaceful people. The motto of our Lord Ramsay's father and surely upheld by the son. These baseless accusations against Our Lord will not stand. If anything, he should be rewarded for not putting that miserable wretch out of his misery. Instead, our merciful Lord took pity on him and brought the wretch into his service."
Dreadfort,2s7wha,-OMGZOMBIES-,5,Tue Jan 13 16:58:42 2015 UTC,Everyone who tries to depict a ill-done image of the glorious and well-bred House Bolton should be beheaded with the highest cruelty.
Dreadfort,2s7wha,omimico,3,Tue Jan 13 19:12:45 2015 UTC,"You've misunderstood my words,i only tried to explain to the OP how merciful our lord Ramsay has been to the turncloak."
Dreadfort,2s7wha,FrightFright,1 point,Tue Jan 13 19:28:30 2015 UTC,"OP is making such wild accusations. Lord Ramsay is a good man, what he is saying makes him lower than Reek. He could be Reek's Reek."

Dreadfort,2s7wha,FrightFright,28,Wed Feb 11 21:55:56 2015 UTC,Ramsay sexually abused him.  And made him do oral sex on fake arya on ramsays wedding night. He has broken half his teeth. He has removed his pride as an archer. His smile. His manhood. His identity.
Dreadfort,2s7wha,NightsQueen,5,Tue Jan 13 00:59:58 2015 UTC,poor thing :( what else happened to him on the wed. night besides that though? he implied there was other stuff but never specified
Dreadfort,2s7wha,charoum,10,Tue Jan 13 03:44:03 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I read it, but I believe that on his wedding night, Lord Ramsay told Reek that since his lips touched his lady wife's sex, he'd remove said lips. He might have also mentioned the tongue, I can't recall."
Dreadfort,2s7wha,remnantsofthepast,9,Tue Jan 13 04:01:01 2015 UTC,"Theon says in one of his chapters that Ramsay wouldn't remove his tongue, because he liked to hear Reek plead and scream."
Dreadfort,2s7wha,charoum,5,Tue Jan 13 05:22:27 2015 UTC,I'm sure his tongue had other uses too.
Dreadfort,2s7wha,charoum,2,Tue Jan 13 05:56:29 2015 UTC,That does imply it is an occasional threat though. Reek just retains enough of Theon to realize that Lord Ramsay sometimes jests with him.
Dreadfort,2s7wha,charoum,4,Tue Jan 13 13:30:12 2015 UTC,But he didn't actually DO it. it was just a threat.
Dreadfort,2s7wha,assainstoilet,5,Tue Jan 13 04:02:21 2015 UTC,"True, Reek snuck away with his lady wife before he could administer proper punishment."

Upon his defeat, Reek and... Arya... will be returned to their rightful places and properly chastised for altering themselves to be taken away."
Dreadfort,2s7wha,Gastrox,-7,Tue Jan 13 13:35:01 2015 UTC,How could he get given oral sex if he doesn't have a pickle?
Dreadfort,2s7wha,Harzoo_zo_Harzoo,5,Tue Jan 13 16:53:34 2015 UTC,Do oral sex as in he went down on the woman.
Dreadfort,2s7wha,VA1N,3,Tue Jan 13 18:41:34 2015 UTC,Ramsay told theon to warm jeyne up sexually  with his tongue

His charming smirk as he informs his Reek that he hasn't unveiled his Reek's true form and name to him is very reassuring that he will guide him every step of the way to the final discovery of his name."
Dreadfort,2s64to,charoum,8,Mon Jan 12 16:04:03 2015 UTC,"One of my favorites,now everytime i read the books i hear Iwan Rheon's voice in my head. ""The britches too Reek,take them off..."" and then he grins. He's doing such a fine job,perfect."

Dreadfort,2s64to,E-Nezzer,7,Mon Jan 12 20:23:49 2015 UTC,"It was hilarious,especially considering how much that trumpet pissed off Theon when he was holding winterfell. But i really can't believe that nobody mentioned "" do eunuchs have a phantom c**k?"" and the sausage scene yet."

Dreadfort,2r9a36,NotSlater,4,Sun Jan 4 10:39:49 2015 UTC,"Because it's set 200 years after the series, I was wondering if it's spoiler free. Surely it will mention stuff with who gets the throne or whatever. P.S. Please don't include spoilers in your response."
Dreadfort,2r9a36,Redruby88,5,Sun Jan 4 22:17:14 2015 UTC,"While we are set 200 years after the events of ASOIAF we can't guarantee a spoiler-free environment as the past plays a big part in the present, just as it does in the canon ASOIAF universe. It may be mentioned, it may not.  Our universe is after ADWD so if you haven't finished up to there then you will run into a chance of spoilers. We try our best to not spoil the books for people as we do have players who are still reading.  I should also mention that we follow the book lore and not the show."

Dreadfort,2qd3e4,Capncorky,16,Thu Dec 25 13:54:49 2014 UTC,"A) Ramsay has no interest in ""inspiring"" Reek.  He is a pet... Reek does what he's told.   B) The consensus is that Grey Worm lost the berries while Reek lost the twig."
Dreadfort,2qd3e4,sixtypercentcriminal,9,Thu Dec 25 14:22:51 2014 UTC,"A) The way I see it, Ramsay likes to encourage Reek when he does well (which is quite rare), such as when he gave Reek a bath as a reward. It might be nice for Reek to have a role model, someone who understands total & utter submission.   B) Well, that's a good point. I would suggest Varys as a better replacement then, but The Spider is far too intelligent for Reek to try to live up to. Did Varys lose both the twig & berries? I forget."
Dreadfort,2qd3e4,FrightFright,9,Thu Dec 25 14:30:59 2014 UTC,"People sure spend a lot of time wondering what's between Varys's legs,when they castrated him they took both the pillar and the stones,i picture a gash,like a woman's.... Sometimes i lie awake at night fearing his gash."
Dreadfort,2qd3e4,sixtypercentcriminal,3,Fri Dec 26 10:34:16 2014 UTC,I'm pretty sure Ramsay only gave him a bath so he could pass Reek off as Theon.   I think Varys lost it all.

Dreadfort,2qd3e4,Kwaurtz,4,Thu Dec 25 16:26:04 2014 UTC,You're suggesting lord Ramsay in his vast array of knowledge of the human anatomy he wouldn't be aware of this fact?!
Dreadfort,2qd3e4,SlumberCat,2,Thu Dec 25 16:29:23 2014 UTC,Not at all. I am merely pointing out that having only berries would seemingly result in a messy puddle of IHOP syrup.

The stump was cauterized and the urethra was kept from healing shut."

Dreadfort,2of50u,Bacon_is_not_france,2,Sat Dec 6 23:00:18 2014 UTC,"Point of the show.  Humans are near the brink of extinction because gigantic flayed monsters came from nowhere and started eating all the humans. They fight back, create huge walls and barricade themselves in. Hundred years of not seeing them and a gigantic one (in the picture) comes and breaks down one of the walls, all hell breaks lose.  It's a good show, I didn't spoil anything except the first 30 minutes so try watching it! I'm not really into the whole anime scene, but my friends insisted and I'm really glad they did.   It has a similar hook to ASOAIF, everybody fucking dies."

It seems in this case, I've gotten a bit of all of it.

That being said, I didn't (as I unfortunately normally do not, along with usernames) notice or note the name of the sub prior to commenting.

Partly because I don't really watch TV (not saying I disagree with it, I just honestly can't do it) and partly because I'm in rural Texas with a 4G hotspot and data use is a concern, and mostly because when I actually do watch a TV show eventually, and it clicks with me, I get so engrossed I can't stop watching until it is done. Example: Breaking Bad on Netflix. Had it not been for that, I'd still to this day have had not seen an episode. (this was prior to living way the hell outside of Austin, mind you, so I had ""proper internet"" and in fact got to try out Time Warner's 300Mbps down/something or other up, service)  The further implication here is that I'm woefully ignorant of current pop culture as far as TV is concerned. But, I can generally figure through it. In this case, I just thought I was in one of the popular subs and thought it was a jab at ... oh shoot... Gordon Ramsey? the chef guy?

Dreadfort,2jvil5,lostBluBird,2,Mon Oct 27 17:48:40 2014 UTC,Nope he was notorious for sticking his hand in people's abdominal cavity and pulling out the entrails. Sounds like a hoot.
Dreadfort,2jvil5,BrannistheMannis,1 point,Thu Dec 4 06:54:12 2014 UTC,"Indeed.  I wish I could remember where I read about the flaying of an enemy's sword hand, so they could never rise up against the king again.  I know the Assyrians were notorious for flaying, and it might have been one of their rulers who did that.  Alas, I cannot find the source.    Regardless, I would totally flay the dominant hand of my enemies, but leave the other intact so they can still work.  And possibly remove their tongues so they cannot speak ill of my rule, but only after they did it once.  You know, striving to be ""just, yet fair"" in my punishments."

Dreadfort,2fuiew,Radient-Red,23,Mon Sep 8 21:46:30 2014 UTC,Meh. I am fine with most of the show changes from the book but I really don't like her character. She literally is just eye candy 'oh I am so twisted teehee how dare that girl act like she's more pretty' and I can't buy that an utterly 'wonderful' rapist/murderer who hunts and kills women like a sport would have her as part of his gang just because she likes to kill too. It just doesn't fit his character. Perhaps I am not the audience she's meant to appeal too as I'm a straight girl but I think there's already plenty of beautiful women in the show already (Natalie Dormer is gorgeous) so she just seems pointless.   ...nearly forgot  I was on /r/dreadfort.

Dreadfort,2fuiew,missdiamandis,5,Tue Sep 9 20:06:58 2014 UTC,"I was okay with her for a little bit, because it was something different, but I didn't expect that she'd be sticking around. Ramsay strikes me as the sort of character that would get bored with a close relationship, no matter how crazy the person is. In fact, it seems more likely that as time goes by that he'd not only be bored with her, but consider her a real challenge, unlike the girls he normally uses, and eventually hunt her. And, just to stir the pot and get her good and pissed, find another psycho girl to hunt her with (assuming that there is no shortage of psychos in Westeros)."
Dreadfort,2fuiew,captainburnz,3,Wed Sep 10 05:02:53 2014 UTC,I can see Ramsay keeping her for a little while. Might as well use one to torture the other and who doesn't like a good shag?  I think he'll do something terrible to her in the end.

Although his mouth is small, Ramsay's lips are wide and meaty, wormy looking, and he smiles a wet-lipped smile. His distinctive eyes resemble Roose's - small, close-set, and oddly pale, like two chips of dirty ice. Ramsay sometimes wears a garnet cut in the shape of a drop of blood in his right ear. Ramsay is a sadist; he is cruel, savage and wild, taking delight in torturing others. He is quite fond of the old Bolton custom of flaying their enemies alive.   -- /r/Winterfell, at your service"

However both are driven, ambitious, calculating, and cruel enough to ensure the survival of the great house Bolton."

He was a good kid, and Roose was regretful that he died, but ultimately it will be Ramsay who carries on the true Bolton lineage.  It explains why Roose forces himself to bed as many women as he can, and why all of his children, save Ramsay and Domeric, have died. Without regular leechings, the blood is caustic to humans.  Ramsay is the chosen one, he is the slayer of the Azor Ahai, he is the song of ice, and he will save the world from the fire that is coming to purge the world by becoming the harbinger of winter, the instrument of the Great Other to save mankind from destruction."

Refuses to kill or release prisoners he cannot provide for but beheads an ally who defies him. Mommy? She can commit high treason though. Love you mum.  He goes on to break a holy oath of betrothal which would naturally lead to EVEN more of his men and allies dying.  The Boltons? Ramsey fights alongside his men -ass bare if needs be- and takes strongholds with minimal losses. He even managed to get Theon -murderer of two innocent children- to do something useful for the first time in his life. Roose puts and end to a war that had norse men killed by the tens of thousands for nothing and gets an actual ruler put in charge of the north. Not a warmongering mommies boy or a yet unborn child of a traitors daughter and a dwarf that don't want to fuck eachother anyway.

A few chapters later,  He joins the war, not happy about it, he thinks that winter is far worse than some brat on the other side of westeros, but a Lord is a Lord. Ramsay tests his patience every day, all roose can do is show him the right way and hope he finds it himself. Walda makes him smile, there arent many things in this world that every make him smile. In an moment, that smile makes him feel more vulnerable than ever felt. He  vows to keep close contact with the Freys.  Roose realises that any goodness in the frey family is in walda. Robbs marriage proposal falls through. Roose keeps close with Walder, hoping to patch things up. A twist of fate makes him meet Jaime. This confirms everything he every feared about Robb, that he is a Mummys boy who lets his petulant mother run roughshod all over the North.   Roose Realises that Robb is failing. Winter is coming, the war in unwinnable. Roose reaches out to walder and Tywin.  The red wedding happens. Roose has lived through enough civil wars to know that winning a crown pales in comparison with the battle to keep hold of it.  Epilogue  Ramsey sits top the Iron throne. The pretenders of Stannis, Lannister, and Whoever the fuck the targaryan is is are all flayed and hung like tapestries. The nights king bows in submission in front of him.

A former mill town, Bolton has been a production centre for textiles since Flemish weavers settled in the area during the 14th century, introducing a wool and cotton-weaving tradition. The urbanisation and development of the town largely coincided with the introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. Bolton was a 19th-century boomtown, and at its zenith in 1929 its 216 cotton mills and 26 bleaching and dyeing works made it one of the largest and most productive centres of cotton spinning in the world. The British cotton industry declined sharply after the First World War, and by the 1980s cotton manufacture had virtually ceased in Bolton.  Close to the West Pennine Moors, Bolton is 10 miles (16 km) northwest of the city of Manchester. It is surrounded by several smaller towns and villages that together form the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton, of which Bolton is the administrative centre. The town of Bolton has a population of 139,403, whilst the wider metropolitan borough has a population of 262,400. Historically a part of Lancashire, Bolton originated as a small settlement in the moorland known as Bolton le Moors. During the English Civil War the town was a Parliamentarian outpost in a staunchly Royalist region, and as a result Bolton was stormed by 3,000 Royalist troops led by Prince Rupert of the Rhine in 1644. In what became known as the Bolton Massacre, 1,600 residents were killed and 700 were taken prisoner.    Image i     Interesting: Bolton Wanderers F.C. | Metropolitan Borough of Bolton | John R.

The year 1506 should be considered its theoretical earliest use in Spain (that is, it made appearance on the standards carried by Philip the Handsome's Burgundian life guards), although about 1525 might be perhaps a more likely estimate. The banner strictly speaking dates back to the early 15th century (allegedly 1408 at the earliest), when the Duke of Burgundy supported the English in the Hundred Years' War. The design is a red saltire resembling two crossed, roughly-pruned (knotted) branches, on a white field. In heraldic language, it may be blazoned argent, a saltire ragulée gules.

Dreadfort,28jwoq,Radient-Red,8,Thu Jun 19 14:19:29 2014 UTC,"The Rolling Stone review of Episode 8:  ""…Ramsay is rewarded with legitimization and lordship by his father Roose Bolton, now one of the most powerful men in the Seven Kingdoms. They even get a heroically shot and scored ride over the hills and into the sunset, as if even the cinematographer and the composer are obligated to bend the knee to House Bolton. History and TV alike are written by the winners.""  (It's a really insightful review, by the way. It goes pretty deep into the nihilist philosophy of that episode and the whole subtext of that Orson Lannister conversation. It suggests that the universe has no purpose, that the lives of humans and beetles are just as meaningless in the end. God/nature/evolution is a cosmic Orson, killing beetles at random with no rhyme or reason. A tale told by an idiot, signifying nothing. In other words, might is the only ""right"" in a purposeless existence, and since Roose and Ramsay are winners, they're also right by every objective metric. Hence the epic music and ride into the sunset, as if the universe is glorifying House Bolton.)"
Dreadfort,28jwoq,Paraplueschi,3,Thu Jun 19 14:19:45 2014 UTC,"Do people actually realize they're riding to Winterfell and not just ""over hills and into the sunset""?"
Dreadfort,28jwoq,Aryman,2,Fri Jun 20 13:50:40 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure most of them realized it was Winterfell - if the recognizable silhouette of the castle didn't ring any bells, the familiar ""King in the North"" music on the soundtrack probably did.   Interesting choice of music, by the way. It really drives home the theme that the Boltons are the new Starks. They've taken their place as the North's protagonists - Roose is almost a new Ned, Ramsay a new Robb, and Reek is...well, a new Theon. It doesn't matter if they're ""right"" or ""wrong"", since these things don't objectively matter. To a blind and indifferent universe, Bolton and Stark mean the same.  (This is what the Rolling Stone reviewer was getting at - the camerawork and music are now glorifying Roose, in the exact same way that Ned and Robb were glorified in the earlier seasons.)"

A)  Dude, this is totally /r/badwesteroshistory. The idea that ""history is written by the victors"" is completely false. If anything, history is written by the literate. If histiory is written by the victors, why are there still Targaryen loyalists claiming that Lyanna loved Rhaeagar, or that Aerys was indeed sane? If history is written by the victors, how ccome the Greyjoys are still complaining about theijr losing of the Greyjoy Rebellion? Also as we all know, many Stark sympathizers still hold the false belief that Robb was murdered at his own uncle's wedding, and that the Frey Frey host broke the guest rites when everyone knows that it was actually Robb who acted hostile towards the freys, and Robb who dealt the first blow at his uncle's wedding prompting the Freys to act in their own defense.

With winter coming at the end of book 5 we have the advantage by holding Winterfell but remember each side has their betrayers. We have the Manderlys ready to betray and Stannis had the Karstarks. In the new TWOW chapter released a while back it showed that Stannis's betrayers were rooted out.

Perma-locked in a cell, dead, dead, lost in the woods, lost beyond the wall, lost in some frozen shithole island.  Our trueborn heir had only one pet, and yet, look how well he takes care of him. Takes good care of his skin, gets him laid, gets him neutered to suppress unnecessary feelings, takes him hunting, amuses him with fun guessing games, gives him regular baths, ensures he's always well fed and warm in his cage.   When those Ironborn scum tried to steal his pet, what did our Lord Ramsay do? He fought them off, bare-chested, with no shield, risking his dear life, displaying incredible bravery and fighting skills wielding weapons in both hands! And he drove the Ironborn scum back to those shit-stained rocks they call home. All this just for a pet Reek.  Truly contrasting from how those arrogant Starks treat their pets."

Dreadfort,27fk28,UserCaleb,10,Fri Jun 6 17:42:30 2014 UTC,"Well, the reason I asked is because you get a lot more Roose in the books than we have gotten in the show so far. Roose is fucking smart. Really smart. Roose knows who and what Ramsay is, exactly. Roose can see this coming from a mile away if it were to happen I think, he even mentions the chances of Ramsay trying to kill him I'm pretty sure. Ramsay is brutal and has his own way of dealing with things, but he still gets them done, and Roose appreciates that.  That being said, Ramsay appreciates his father even though his father is the only person who can tell him what to do. I don't think Ramsay wants to kill his father, he has too much to learn from him still.  Ramsay has a lot to learn if he's ever able to out-wit Roose."
Dreadfort,27fk28,delmarman,5,Fri Jun 6 17:47:23 2014 UTC,"It's definitely possible, but there are so many other people that would theoretically be gunning for the Boltons (Are there any North/Stark loyalists left?) that it would seem a bit out-of-left field. Maybe Reek will pull some shit and deal with Ramsey."
Dreadfort,27fk28,UserCaleb,2,Fri Jun 6 06:55:35 2014 UTC,You'd be surprised how many Stark loyalists there are...  I think it might be about 50/50 for Stark loyalists vs Bolton loyalists.
Dreadfort,27fk28,Ironzorak,3,Thu Jun 19 04:15:54 2014 UTC,"I think Ramsay wouldn't kill Roose, but if they live long enough I could definitely see Ramsay torturing an elderly Roose."

Dreadfort,27fk28,amartz,1 point,Fri Jun 6 14:15:40 2014 UTC,I don't think so. Tywin's a bit of a badass.
Dreadfort,27fk28,amartz,3,Thu Jun 12 17:03:09 2014 UTC,"No, this would not happen.  Hopefully what I'm saying next won't go against the meta, considering what your question is asking....  As cruel and vicious as Ramsay is, he is not stupid. He knows his limits and he knows what will happen if he does try to kill his own father. If they lose the Roose, House Bolton loses an incredibly powerful and clever lord.   He's now Warden of the North. He is now in the favor of the Lannisters for what happened at the Red Wedding, and the Freys are under them. Ramsay knows how clever is father is, and I doubt he would even be able to kill him. Ramsay is not nearly as smart as he thinks he is, but he does know that if he were to kill his father, House Bolton would surely fall.  And another, important aspect: Ramsay is afraid of Roose, and rightfully so. It's mentioned by Reek in the books:  ""This is no man to jape with. You had only to look at (Roose) Bolton to know that he had more cruelty in his pinky toe than all the Freys combined.""  Ramsay has no idea what Roose could possibly do to him if he showed some signs of defection, some signs of ambition. You can look back at certain scenes of the show as well, and it becomes very obvious.  House Bolton FTW"

Dreadfort,276ean,solyarist,49,Tue Jun 3 04:54:52 2014 UTC,"They're the only reasonable House out there.  The Starks are naive dimwits. There's much love in other ASOIAF subs, but I think they are the most boring characters in the whole series. Honour this, honour there but most importantly: dont flinch when you get slaughtered because your naivité pushed you in a hopeless situation.  The dragon bitch is an enlightened teenage girl with an army. Says she's compelled to conquer the iron throne because she's the rightful heir. Bitch be honest: you're a greedy little fuck who gets a hard-on by the mere thought of making everybody in Westeros bow.  Same goes for Stannis. Plus he reminds me of the accountant at my job, that guy's 60+ has the charisma of a glass of water during happy hour yet wonders why he has a new boss every two years when it's an open secret he wants the job so bad. He does solid work tough. The accountant, Stannis not so much.  The Lannisters are the epitome of hypocrisy:   Everything I did, I did for my family. Except smelling my own farts, that's just for my own pleasure.   Tywin Lannister  Except all those times you fucked your own son over and over again. The incest twins score high in the ""sick fuck chart"", yet look down on everybody else. Tyrion is ok tough. He would make for a cool nightstand lamp, with his pink little cock as a switch.  Let me summarize house Martell for you:  REVENGE!!  You're welcome. But let me also summarize every guy at  Greyjoy&Cie Piracy Enterprises ever: ""You didn't pay the iron price, I paid the iron price!""  And then there are the Boltons. They make no attempt to hide their intentions, they don't hide behind false pretenses of knightly behaviour and they make damn sure everybody gets the notice. They are efficient, don't get distracted by love interests and have a kick ass banner.  But perhaps the most important part: Michael McElhatton and Iwan Rheon are amazing actors.

I think this series is one of the few series (literary or televised) where there are no set ""good guys"" (except the Starks who like you said were somewhat cliched) and ""bad guys"".   That being said, how do you feel about Arya (ignore the fact she wants to kill your Lord and his heir)? She's pretty straight forward with what she wants."

Lord Roose is where he is because of your number two strategy--nothing else has helped place House Bolton where it finds itself today.  To take pleasure in sadism will be the end of House Bolton.  It serves an end, and that is all.  In this sense, our friend Tywin Lannister is correct."

They are a well rounded house that excells in all categories of leadership. They are more shrewd than the Lannisters, Tougher than the Baratheons, and more magnanimous than the Tyrells. They are more prestigious than the Arryns, and their sense of family and tradition blows the Tully's out of the water (pun intended, should it please our lords.) They are more dashing than the Martells, and, well, the Greyjoys have absolutely no desirable traits whatsoever for the Boltons to surpass them in. I can think of no greater mercy to a Greyjoy than to relieve them of that shit-stained name. I believe they is the exact sort of change we in the North need to survive the coming winter after the ravages of thick-headed Stark arrogance and vanity.

I reject the Nights King interpretation, not just because of the incident a few episodes back but because it makes it more interesting and because it makes the universe feel like a much larger place with many more mysteries and dangers in it if Roose is a part of another long forgotten magical tradition (one I think he intentionally keeps secret through the collection of and burning of books with information which Roose would prefer not get out.) I like to believe there's more at work than just The Lord of Light vs. The Great Other.  For my own personal head-cannon, I think Roose is at least a thousand years old. He and those like him were leading the famed rebellion against the Starks back then, and he managed to come out of it the sole survivor of his clan of shape shifters. The last of his kind. I imagine they used to be able to take on anyone's skin, but something happened with the nature of their magic, and they became locked into only taking skin of their own bloodline, and only from certain individuals at that. In my mind I don't think of him as Roose so much as I think of him as ""the thing on the Bolton banner."" It's not a flayed man that's House Boltons symbol, it's a portrait of the lords true form."

Directed by French poet and filmmaker Jean Cocteau, the film stars Josette Day as Belle and Jean Marais.  The plot of Cocteau's film revolves around Belle's father who is sentenced to death for picking a rose from Beast's garden. Belle offers to go back to the Beast in her father's place. Beast falls in love with her and proposes marriage on a nightly basis which she refuses. Belle eventually becomes more drawn to Beast, who tests her by letting her return home to her family and telling her that if she doesn't return to him within a week, he will die of grief.

The Tyrells were a bit of a colorless non-entity in the books, but Natalie Dormer's character in the show is one of my all-time favorites.  I also like the Starks, especially the narrations of Sansa and Arya. They're both genuinely interesting for child characters and sympathetic enough to the reader. (The subtle menacing feel of the King's Landing chapters, for example, wouldn't be there if the Stark girls didn't narrate them.)  So, yeah, the Lannisters, Starks, and Tyrells. I also like Stannis the Mannis, but I don't think he counts as his own house."

What makes Stannis so fascinating is that he's such a strict principled character on the surface, but is actually roiling with inner conflicts of all sorts. He loves his daughter, but killed his brother without any regrets. He's a walking contradiction - always strict and fair, but not honorable at all. He'll make human sacrifices and summon demons, if that's what it takes to win.  In his own way, the Mannis is just as ruthlessly opportunistic as any Bolton."

Dreadfort,269vyd,LyzeOfKiel,18,Fri May 23 04:49:19 2014 UTC,"I find Roose to be an incredibly appealing character who in many ways walks a fine line between the natural and supernatural, challenging the reader to step back in a profoundly unnerving way.    ""Roose has no feelings, you see. Those leeches that he loves so well sucked all the passions out of him years ago. He does not love, he does not hate, he does not grieve. This is a game to him, mildly diverting. Some men hunt, some hawk, some tumble dice. Roose plays with men. You and me, these Freys, Lord Manderly, his plump new wife, even his bastard, we are but his playthings.""   The Bolton house is hyperaware that the game of thrones is indeed a game. It hovers close to breaking the fourth wall, as if they are testing the limits of what they know to be a fantastically fictional world. I find it fascinating. The Boltons seem to me to be what would happen if someone from our world was transported into George R.R. Martin's world, and was aware that it was all just a made-up game."
Dreadfort,269vyd,ux4,3,Fri May 23 06:05:22 2014 UTC,"I think the history of the North is one of the most contested and interesting areas in the book.  The Boltons have been playing the game for as long as the Starks, and the fact that they did not come out on top makes them sharp and aware, while the Starks are only beginning to realize the scope of the game.  I agree with you, Roose is incredibly appealing, especially because he is one of the only openly mysterious characters in the books."
Dreadfort,269vyd,ux4,6,Fri May 23 20:18:39 2014 UTC,"Agreed. In that way I find the Boltons, even more than the Lannisters, to be ideal foils to the Starks."
Dreadfort,269vyd,nixiedust,9,Fri May 23 20:46:29 2014 UTC,"The Boltons are two of the best sociopathic characters I've read. Ramsay is the consummate chaotic evil, like the Joker. Who knows what motivates him? He just wants to make people suffer. And Roose's cold calculations are a maddening counterpart to the more passionate players. Their brutality is a punch in the face for traditional Fantasy.  My asoiaf flair, ""Kingflayer"" is both a play on words and an acknowledgement that only the finest victims are worthy of Bolton knives."
Dreadfort,269vyd,holeonthemoon,14,Fri May 23 13:49:16 2014 UTC,"I honestly enjoy the delicious consistency of House Bolton. Any other house, and you're constantly wondering what the characters will do, who betrays them, when and how they'll die, what their twists will be. With House Bolton, I can simply snuggle in for a sure-thing of nice, warm sociopathic perversion.  It's as simple as that really.  As for my ASOIAF flair - speak softly and carry a sharp knife - , I simply combined Lord Bolton's mantra of ""a quiet people"" with Theodore Roosevelt's line about talking softly (also a Bolton trait) while carrying a big stick, and the famous Bolton words ""Our Knives are Sharp""."

And remembering to never raise your voice.  These, and burning the book when you're done with it, are the secrets of a long healthy life."
Dreadfort,264td1,Kliro,3,Thu May 22 03:26:05 2014 UTC,Was he drinking hippocras in that part in the book? I have always been under the impression that our Lord did not partake in alcoholic amusement. Dulls the senses.

Dreadfort,264td1,Banannafay,7,Thu May 22 10:16:32 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I dunno. I'm thinking either A: He's grooming her to be as wonderful as him in all ways, or B: he's pulling a long con and is one day gonna twist the shit out of her love for him."
Dreadfort,264td1,Knuckledustr,2,Thu May 22 16:30:27 2014 UTC,She seems too willful a creature. I'd imagine the latter. Ramsay's always had his own way of doing things.
Dreadfort,264td1,DENNISISABASTARDMAN,9,Tue May 27 16:50:33 2014 UTC,"I found Ramsay having consensual sex a bit unusual too, but I'm sure he'll hunt her down at one point or another.   First he'll let her think she's special."
Dreadfort,264td1,Thzae,6,Thu May 22 12:41:49 2014 UTC,"But isn't she the girl in the first episode, where Ramsay and she are hunting a girl (as equals) and Reek tags along ?   I'm sort of beginning to think of her as a Chekov's gun."
Dreadfort,264td1,Banannafay,4,Thu May 22 13:10:59 2014 UTC,What I found very interesting was that she was on top during the sex scene and she was choking him. It would seem our Lord enjoys being dominated and there is nothing wrong with that.

Then they had a small rod or metal spike inserted in the urethra for months at a time so the flesh wouldn't heal over it. This was a very risky surgery and half the eunuchs apparently died of it.   So, yeah, Reek has the choice between getting infected from his bladder filling up with urine and toxins, or getting raped with a metal spike in his piss-hole.

Sure, Tyrion has been through the shitter, so has Bran, it's hard to even think of a character that didn't put up with some sort of shit. The one who takes the cake though is Reek. I enjoy the Dreadfort because it's GRRM's house of horrors. It just gets worse and worse, but for some reason everytime Ramsay or Roose speaks a smile comes to my face. Everytime Reek freaks it puts a smile on my face as well. The seven dammit they are the most interesting house. Stark? Woof. Tully? Mighty good halibut. Lannisters? Meow. Umber?

That the last few years were marred by inept self-serving lords is a shame, but that should not sully the proud shared history of our two houses. With this wonderful marriage between Bolton and Stark, the blight of the young wolf will eventually become a brief blot in the history books.   Thus, I look at any cheer for the Starks as naught but remembrance for fonder times that once were, and will be again under our lord's guidance. For we are a peaceful land and a quiet people.

Dreadfort,23b70p,CallMeSwedish,6,Fri Apr 18 07:20:04 2014 UTC,They are Lords. And wardens of the North. They're trying to marry Arya so that the common folk in the North will accept them as the new Wardens and accept the fact that they're lords of Winterfell now.
Dreadfort,23b70p,stagfury,1 point,Fri Apr 18 12:37:08 2014 UTC,"But Wardens of the X is literally the official title in Westeros for the highest authority in each direction. Are you gonna say that Lannister isn't a Great House because Tywin is merely ""Warden of the West""?"
Dreadfort,23b70p,awfulgrace,2,Sun Apr 20 06:52:23 2014 UTC,"Not so, the highest title is Lord Paramount. The Warden is the highest military commander. Right now, in the North this distinction doesn't matter, but the Boltons were not made Lord Paramount because Tywin was planning for the son of Tyrion/Sansa to claim Lord Paramount of the North.       For example, Sweetrobin is LP of the Vale, but Jaime Lannister was Warden of the East."

Dreadfort,230amv,thecharlesyesthe,21,Mon Apr 14 14:57:49 2014 UTC,"So, it sounds like it's not THAT much, he certainly won't have wealth comparable to the Lannisters. But Roose doesn't need to propagate anyway since he's immortal, so he might as well get the most bang for his buck. Plus Walda has plenty of skin for Ramsay to play with."
Dreadfort,230amv,Captain_Excellent,11,Mon Apr 14 18:07:35 2014 UTC,"Well no. Common sense dictates that Lord Frey can't give our Lord Roose more money than he has, and Lord Frey is far from the richest lord of these lands. Yet the dowry was quite sizeable, more than most might own in a lifetime. So to say ""it's not THAT much"" might be in danger of underestimating in your quest to avoid overestimating."
Dreadfort,230amv,Ironhorn,9,Mon Apr 14 20:26:39 2014 UTC,"True, true. I guess what I gathered from the askhistorians thread is that noblemen are measured more by their income than their accumulated wealth. Roose got maybe a year's worth of Frey's income, which is certainly nothing to be understated. But it's only a lump sum which will soon be spent (or may already have been spent) on war materials.  Roose saying it will make him ""a very rich man"" implies that he'll be all set for life with that kind of money. However, in reality his aspirations are to amass far greater wealth through his conquest of the North. And obviously when the Flayed Man brings the Seven Kingdoms to its knees, and inevitably sits upon the Iron Throne, that kind of money will seem a pittance."
Dreadfort,230amv,Captain_Excellent,3,Mon Apr 14 20:57:24 2014 UTC,"Frey is not Lannister Rich, but he is far from poor. The Twins are basically two towers securing a toll bridge on a main westerosi trade route. Way more money than The Dreadfort alone produces."
Dreadfort,230amv,Offensive_Brute,3,Tue Apr 15 00:52:17 2014 UTC,"House Frey is one of the richest houses in the seven kingdoms  Besides for the Seven great houses (Stark, Tully, Arryn, Lannister, Tyrell, Baratheon and Martell), Baratheon of Kings Landing(Seperate from Baratheon of Storms End), there isn't too much competition  The only other houses that come to mind are hightower, Redwyne, and possibly some Lannister vassal with Gold Mines (Like the Reynes-If they were still alive)   The Tolls from the Twins can make a house very rich"
Dreadfort,230amv,HypeIsReal,2,Thu Apr 17 04:21:56 2014 UTC,"I'd add to the list House Baelish now that its seat is Harenhal. The lands of Harenhal are supposedly some of the richest in the kingdom. Of course thats probably not the case in the wake of the War of the 5 Kings where pretty much everythings been killed or burnt. Its also supposedly offset by the obscene costs of maintaining Harenhal itself. Still, theres a reason the Crown keeps gifting it to loyal servants. Despite the curse its considered a prize seat."
Dreadfort,230amv,Offensive_Brute,1 point,Thu Apr 17 13:42:50 2014 UTC,"Yeah, i really should change my original post because House Baelish is now Lord Paramount of the Trident   (Stark, Tully Baelish, Arryn, Lannister, Tyrell, Baratheon and Martell)"

Dreadfort,2308vi,IAMA_DragonSlayerAMA,5,Tue Apr 15 03:52:05 2014 UTC,Lord Ramsay has such a good understanding of what it takes to make an exciting hunt (and so much respect for the hard work the girls put forth)! What a wonderful episode. I was worried that Reek might have attempted something against our lord while he was vulnerable but the fact that he didn't hesitate is a great testament to his powers of instilling loyalty.
Dreadfort,2308vi,RevOtisElevator,7,Tue Apr 15 01:36:58 2014 UTC,Ramsay and Locke seemed like genuine friends. I hope this isn't the last time we get to see the two of them together!

That last scene with Arya and Sandor should have left The Hound critically injured and Arya on her way to Braavos. Also, the person Arya kills is the person she just recently killed in the latest chapter reveal from TWOW. Weird."
Dreadfort,22e5jt,Spiralyst,2,Mon Apr 7 20:15:25 2014 UTC,"Yep, it would appear that they're slowing down the Hound/Arya's plotline for the show. It sort of makes sense, since if they kept it on track you'd end up with Arya in Bravos too early. I guess they have to make up some Hound/Arya filler material in the meantime. Can't say I'm mad about that, they have a great dynamic going."
Dreadfort,22e5jt,Rowona,1 point,Tue Apr 8 01:59:08 2014 UTC,"Polliver was killed in the Inn in the books, but in the books he wasn't the one who killed Lommy.  Since Polliver killed Lommy in the show, the way Arya kills him is more like what Mercy did to Raff in the TWOW chapter."
Dreadfort,22e5jt,tenehemia,1 point,Tue Apr 8 09:14:22 2014 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but Polliver died in ACOK by the hands of Jaqen H'ghar. The Tickler is the one who buys it in the inn, and Rafford is the last to die in the most recently revealed TWOW chapter.   In the show they condensed all three of these characters in to two, being the unnamed torturer who dies at Harrenhal and now the redone inn scene."

Crossing the North from West to East on foot would probably take more time than circumventing the whole continent, and it's also much more dangerous.   Her plan is to sneak into the Dreadfort, grab Reek and go back to the Iron Islands. If she tried to do that on foot, she could be detected dozens of miles before even getting close to the Dreadfort (if her forces were mounted the chance would be even higher), and even if she managed to take Reek from the dungeons and escape the castle, the Boltons could chase her with their horses.  I was also skeptical at first, but after giving it some thought, it started to make a lot of sense to me."

Dreadfort,21xyn3,Ramsayreek,14,Tue Apr 1 18:10:44 2014 UTC,"Welcome! I agree with us being the most fascinating house in Westeros. GRRM didn't give the Bolton's dragons because it just wouldn't be fair to the realm. So, I like your theory, but why would Ramsay kill the original Reek? From what I understand, the only reason Theon becomes the new Reek is because the previous one was killed by Rodrick Cassel and co. I don't think Ramsay would kill his pets just because he can, that is too easy. He only replaces them when it is necessary and they die some other way."
Dreadfort,21xyn3,oACHILLESo,8,Tue Apr 1 18:51:27 2014 UTC,"I see what you're saying, but remember that Ramsay's favorite past time was to hunt down girls he captured FOR FUN.   So I do think that Ramsay would kill his pets, if it gave him enjoyment.  He's just that nuts.   Then, add in his hatred and jealousy toward Domeric (who is a Trueborn Bolton, when Ramsay is just a Bastard - which seems to drive his cruelty),  I see no reason why Ramsay wouldn't enjoy making his half-brother his new Reek.  And if that meant he needed to get rid of his original Reek, then so be it.    I think Ramsay jumped on the opportunity to poison Domeric and turn him into Reek out of jealousy/envy/hatred.  We've seen Ramsay already do this to Theon... Ramsay was jealous and hated Theon's entitled cockiness, so he turned the tables on Theon and broke Theon down so much to remove the 'Prince' in Theon, turning him into his pet Reek.    The same applies to Domeric... it makes total sense that Ramsay, given the opportunity, would feel that much more powerful if he could take the trueborn Bolton son (Domeric) and make him his tortured pet.  We also know that Ramsay has little or no respect for the life of others, so he would have no problem killing his original Reek if it served another purpose, which is making his half-brother Domeric into his new pet."
Dreadfort,21xyn3,oACHILLESo,8,Tue Apr 1 19:17:48 2014 UTC,"Ah, ok, that makes sense. My only question then would be, wouldn't Reek and Domeric have to look pretty similar in order for this to work? I mean I know Ramsay can make men look much different than they used to, but a general resemblence would probably be necessary in order for people not to notice. Especially Roose, he would probably know if it was always Domeric around Ramsay and not the original Reek."
Dreadfort,21xyn3,oACHILLESo,10,Tue Apr 1 19:22:32 2014 UTC,"Well, A Wiki of Ice and Fire says Domeric was killed in 297 AL.  We know the War of Five Kings starts in 298 AL.   It's very plausible that Roose never visited Ramsay after Domeric was ""killed"" as just a year later he would be on the war campaign with Robb Stark.  We also know that most people didn't even recognize Theon until they dressed him up in more noble clothing.  When Theon was pure Reek, he was almost unrecognizable.   So this would have been the case with Domeric as well (not to mention the intolerable smell of his bowels, so I doubt anyone would get that close to him).   And anyone of minor importance that may have noticed, why would they say anything and piss off Ramsay?"
Dreadfort,21xyn3,pikpikcarrotmon,6,Tue Apr 1 19:31:58 2014 UTC,"Well, for what it's worth, you seem to have convinced me of this idea haha. Damn now I'm going to go have to do some research myself. Well done RamsayReek, even though that is an oxymoron ;)"
Dreadfort,21xyn3,minimuffins,8,Tue Apr 1 19:43:20 2014 UTC,"Hahaha thanks.   Honestly I have no clue if this is just crazy tinfoil or if GRRM secretly meant us to discover this, but the thing that really got me thinking was the whole 'sickness of the bowels' line in the books.   We never hear this again in the series when people fall ill or are poisoned.    So why would GRRM write that if it doesn't mean anything?   It's just way to large a coincidence that Ramsay's pet is known for smelling horribly (hence the name Reek lol).  And it fits with Ramsay's evil nature.   Just way to many coincidences to ignore IMO.   At the very least, it's fun to think about.   Makes me wonder how many other subtle hidden discoveries there are in the series that no one has really brought up yet."
Dreadfort,21xyn3,pikpikcarrotmon,6,Tue Apr 1 19:52:08 2014 UTC,"I think Tywin is also described similarly and his posthumous stench is legendary. He was likely poisoned by Oberyn, lending credibility to this theory."
Dreadfort,21xyn3,minimuffins,2,Wed Apr 2 04:13:36 2014 UTC,"He was likely poisoned by Oberyn, lending credibility to this theory.   What? Like, a slow acting poison? I've never heard this theory before. While the motivation is there, I don't believe that there's any real reason to believe this is the case. Not to mention that it would be hard to fit into a timeline."
Dreadfort,21xyn3,ioasd,3,Sat Apr 19 05:19:48 2014 UTC,"Read up on it here and here.  The basic premise is that Oberyn poisoned Tywin with Widow's Blood, which plugs you up for its duration.  He did so when they dined together.  Tyrion meets him on the toilet, but after his death, he relieves himself?  It only makes sense if Tyrion literally ripped him a new asshole with that crossbow bolt.  Oberyn knew he was going up against the Mountain, and surely had to know that fight could go sour.  Would someone like him really leave things to chance and allow Tywin to live?"
Dreadfort,21xyn3,ioasd,2,Sat Apr 19 05:34:05 2014 UTC,"Hm. I really had never heard that before. While I suppose it is plausible, I still feel the need to point out that not only was Tywin shot in the intestines, defecation upon death is pretty standard since all of the muscles relax. Every other point that was made does make some sense, though."
Dreadfort,21xyn3,Coniine,3,Sat Apr 19 05:47:42 2014 UTC,"Theon grew up as a ward of Winterfell, an outsider in a city that was entirely slaughtered. People have a hard time recognizing him because no one who has been in close contact with him during his childhood is still alive. The war has more or less avoided the Dreadfort, however, and Roose does his best to keep his own men alive. It would be much harder to hide Domeric, Lord Bolton's esteemed heir, from his own people in his own lands."
Dreadfort,21xyn3,CallMeSwedish,2,Tue Apr 1 23:02:05 2014 UTC,"True, but you could also argue that Bolton's men and everyone at the Dreadfort would not have recognized Domeric at all; He was raised for four years under Lady Dustin's care and then squired in the Vale of Arryn for another three or four years.   And then consider him beaten into a lowly creature with a horrible smell.     Maybe not probable, but it is possible."
Dreadfort,21xyn3,absolutely_disgustin,3,Tue Apr 1 23:20:02 2014 UTC,Asha Greyjoy recognized Theon immediately when he returned to the Iron Islands. He can be forgiven for not reciprocating because he was only a toddler when they last saw each other.
Dreadfort,21xyn3,tacoyum6,6,Tue Apr 1 23:49:14 2014 UTC,"Although I'm not sure that we will get any evidence for or against the veracity of your theory, I think that it's a really interesting idea which adds to the fascinating history of House Bolton. I'd like to think that it could have some truth to it. It's also interesting to note Ramsay's obsession (?) with identity and slipping into new ones (for example Reek) as a parallel to historical Boltons wearing the flayed skins of their victims."
Dreadfort,21xyn3,evanthesquirrel,3,Tue Apr 1 20:46:26 2014 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/n9BOJ.gif  Wow, I didn't even think about comparing House Bolton's history of wearing flayed skins as a parallel to Ramsay's obsession with identity switching.  Makes me more convinced of the theory and of GRRM's (unintentional?) genius."
Dreadfort,21xyn3,DavidlikesPeace,2,Tue Apr 1 20:54:07 2014 UTC,How would Roose not know that the second Reek really was his own son?

IIRC, William Wallace flayed the English sergeant who killed his wife, and tanned his skin into a leather belt. I dunno if that story is true, but I can imagine the Boltons doing something similar."
Dreadfort,20un4f,Radient-Red,3,Thu Mar 20 12:14:36 2014 UTC,"I didn't take it as the Roose man denying that the ancient Boltons wore skins.

Dreadfort,20so2s,AntonioVargas,3,Thu Mar 20 16:03:04 2014 UTC,"He took his pinky in the show. In the books he misses the pinky on his right (like in the show) and two on his left. Though where the new season starts is technically already the first Reek chapter. So he should miss them already. But eh, the show often does what it wants and he can still lose one or more fingers anyway. We'll see. I still think he looks pretty reek-y as is, despite the many fingers."

Dreadfort,20rvvn,Radient-Red,2,Wed Mar 19 01:52:56 2014 UTC,"Going by a line in this trailer, it also looks like Brienne's quest has a different motive in the TV series.    It seems her mission is to find Arya and return her to the capital, so they can safely deliver her to Our Trueborn Lord who needs a Stark wife to unite the North. In the books, Brienne's mission was to track down Sansa, but that whole timeline has been changed since S3."
Dreadfort,20rvvn,trousersquid,2,Wed Mar 19 02:10:21 2014 UTC,"Lol, this also makes Brienne's mission a bit morally shadier on the TV show - instead of finding Sansa, she's now on a quest to find Arya and unwittingly deliver her to Ramsay's loving embrace."
Dreadfort,20rvvn,Paraplueschi,6,Wed Mar 19 02:26:33 2014 UTC,"Possibly... or they cut it so that it seemed that way. Remember, show-watchers don't know that Sansa won't always be in King's Landing... I'd say it's a misdirect."

Dreadfort,20p8wf,Radient-Red,7,Tue Mar 18 12:02:54 2014 UTC,"Roose's increased screentime in S4 probably has to do with the actor's contract - he's been upgraded from a guest actor to one of the main regulars.   (IIRC, the opening credits will now have McElhatton's and Rheon's names, as well as Gwendoline Christie and newcomer Michel Huisman)."

I know a few of my friends who haven't read the books are sometimes confused on how bastardy works in Westeros."
Dreadfort,20p8wf,Paraplueschi,3,Tue Mar 18 09:13:29 2014 UTC,"This is a bit confusing to me - it seems that the shot of Roose riding into the castle yard is the same scene as the one of Ramsay waiting in the yard. Obviously, they meet at the Dreadfort at some point.   What's really puzzling is the image of the open field at Moat Cailin, showing the father and bastardtrueborn son walking towards each another in a tense Mexican standoff. We already know Moat Cailin's surrender is gonna be in the show - we see the Bolton armies, Reek with the white flag, etc etc.   So what's the point of having the Bolton reunion at Moat Cailin, if they already met earlier in the Dreadfort? Why even bother with Moat Cailin at all, since the whole point of that operation was to make way for Roose's return north? Did I miss something, or does nothing here make sense?"
Dreadfort,20p8wf,Paraplueschi,3,Tue Mar 18 13:53:37 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure either, but I'm starting to speculate that they will split forces to root the Ironborn out of the North. Lord Ramsay goes South to Moat Cailin and Lord Roose goes somewhere else, and they later meet with their armies. What I can't understand is how would Lord Roose get past Moat Cailin in the first place before spliitting his forces with Lord Ramsay, unles they turn it into a useless fort in the show."
Dreadfort,20p8wf,CallMeSwedish,2,Tue Mar 18 13:58:19 2014 UTC,"Yeah. The entire purpose with the Moat Cailin operation was to make way for Roose's army to return home - but obviously Roose can already do that, since he's at the Dreadfort in a chronologically earlier scene. Unless you move the Dreadfort scene to the very last episode of S4, there's no real reason to show Moat Cailin at all.   (That, and the iconic father-son reunion on the hilltop will lose a lot of its power if Roose and Ramsay have already reunited a few weeks before.)  We know the Moat Cailin surrender is in, and that the scene will probably follow the ADWD chapter pretty closely (the Ironborn defenders have been cast, we see TheonReek dressed up in Greyjoy armor and holding a white flag, etc etc). So this decision the part of HBO seems a bit strange, to say the least."
Dreadfort,20o4d7,E-Nezzer,6,Mon Mar 17 22:54:32 2014 UTC,"This is awesome. We never got a good description of the Dreadfort in the books, so I'm really looking forward to how the showmakers envision it."

I personally wouldn't like to see a POV from the Boltons since I think it would distrupt the sense of mystery about them.  The subreddit traffic usually picks up during show season, there should be daily posts then.  As far as spoilers are concerned, I'd recommend you stay clear of these parts until you finish the last two books. /r/Dreadfort does not regulate spoilers."

I was thinking that too, I just really enjoy this subreddit, I'm realtively new here and I've been reading threads from 9 month back, it's just a shame there aren't that many new ones that i actually can take part in..  If I get something spoiled it wouldn't be that horrible either."

I think they could have pulled it off if they'd done it subtly, but there's no denying that the color pink has certain connotations to modern audiences that might make the Boltons look ridiculous if worn on the show.  The show makers should, of course, be flayed for their transgressions all the same, but there is a kind of logic to it."

Dreadfort,1v42qn,Cryptophagist,8,Mon Jan 13 15:59:29 2014 UTC,Seems kinda small...
Dreadfort,1v42qn,Space_Tuna,14,Mon Jan 13 19:34:31 2014 UTC,"Seriously, the Dreadfort is supposed to rival Winterfell. It's supposed to have high walls, water-heated living areas, a large garrison,  stables, food stores to make it through a ten year winter, and even a godswood. Not to mention a dungeon spacious enough to hold 100 Reeks. This... I just don't see it."
Dreadfort,1v42qn,Frognosticator,2,Tue Jan 14 22:13:10 2014 UTC,"Agreed. Also, I don't like the forward keep connected by the covered bridge. It seems unstable and flimsy, and doesn't serve much defensive purpose as best I can tell."

Dreadfort,1v42qn,BMan3000,3,Mon Jan 13 15:56:34 2014 UTC,Awesome. Simply awesome.  Is there mention in the books of the Dreadfort and a description that matches this? It's not how I pictured it.
Dreadfort,1v42qn,294116002,3,Mon Jan 13 20:45:40 2014 UTC,All we know is that it is large and very defensible (it held out against siege for years at one point). It's also quite close to a large hilly region and a river (no mountains like what is shown above). That's about it IIRC.
Dreadfort,1v42qn,Frognosticator,2,Mon Jan 13 21:25:10 2014 UTC,"The Starks laid seige to it several times, and it was always a tough nut to crack. If they ever breached it, then it was never a decisive enough victory to rid the Boltons from it. I always kind of assumed it would be a smaller, grimmer version of Winterfell."
Dreadfort,1v42qn,RevOtisElevator,3,Tue Jan 14 22:16:20 2014 UTC,"There are some descriptions in ADWD that fill in some detail. I used the following passage from AWOIAF for inspiration when making my 'Breadfort' last month:  ""The Dreadfort is a strong fortress, with high walls and triangular merlons that look like sharp stone teeth. It has thick stone walls and massive towers.""  I can't wait to see how it is represented in season 4, especially during the title sequence."
Dreadfort,1v42qn,BMan3000,3,Tue Jan 14 00:00:32 2014 UTC,OH BABY! Hopefully it will do justice to our Good Lord's home.

Dreadfort,1v40rr,PNKID,19,Mon Jan 13 18:47:52 2014 UTC,"That is correct, my good Reek.   We see our trueborn heir of House Bolton twice - once when he's meeting his father on a dark field, and once when he's naked and gets slapped across the face by an equally naked Charlotte Hope at the trailer's end.   The gold medal is yours, and you'll only lose your least precious body part."

Dreadfort,1thpmu,E-Nezzer,2,Mon Dec 23 02:02:47 2013 UTC,I looked for any video interview of him and never found it. Do you have a link?
Dreadfort,1thpmu,E-Nezzer,2,Mon Dec 23 03:56:46 2013 UTC,"Here you go.  It was a comedy interview of RTE, it seems. McElhatton is obviously acting in this, so it's not really a relevant interview if you're into GOT."

Dreadfort,1swryn,_Ramsay_Bolton,8,Sun Dec 22 18:37:37 2013 UTC,Why is Reek allowed to wear Lord Roose's beautiful cloak? Why isn't he in his piss-soaked rags?  I'm afraid I have to tell Our Lord about this.
Dreadfort,1swryn,Radient-Red,1 point,Sun Dec 15 12:42:22 2013 UTC,"Yeah, that was the first thing I thought when I saw the pic. It must have stolen from one of the boys while they were asleep. Reek, Reek, it rhymes with sneak."
Dreadfort,1s3hs2,d13go,27,Wed Dec 4 18:55:12 2013 UTC,Original Reek was a stable boy that got killed. His body was claimed as Ramsey and the real Ramsey got taken prisoner at Winterfell pretending to be Reek.
Dreadfort,1s3hs2,Phelim,22,Wed Dec 4 19:30:21 2013 UTC,"When men of stark allegiance were coming upon reek and Ramsay (presumably skinning and  raping a victim). Ramsay gave reek his clothes, horse, ring etc. He told him to go tell his (Ramsays) father. Ramsay then smeared shit on himself and dressed in rags. The winterfell men killed reek dressed as ramsay and took ramsay who was dressed as reek into custody.  Thus the deception"
Dreadfort,1s3hs2,ThereIsNoGod-,15,Wed Dec 4 20:49:35 2013 UTC,"Original Reek does not appear in person in the books. While Ramsay was being hunted by Cassel, he swapped identities with Reek, his manservant. Reek, in the guise of Ramsay, was slain by Cassel. This is why everyone thought Ramsay was dead.   Ramsay, in the guise of Reek, is captured by Cassel and brought to Winterfell, where he gained Theon's trust before betraying him, taking Winterfell for himself and revealing his true identity."
Dreadfort,1s3hs2,VolcanicBakemeat,26,Thu Dec 5 01:34:23 2013 UTC,It's RamsAy. You should also remember to mention his title. Lord Ramsay.

I mean, it was good enough for Robb, Balon, and Joffrey, but not the lord of the Dreadfort?  Then it hit me:  Roose is the Leach King!  That's why it won't work on him.  Truly, the Roose is always one step ahead everyone else.  He's probably already gathering Dragonsglass and working on some sort of anti-Targaryens enchantment as we speak."

Dreadfort,1mxp11,kornork,8,Mon Sep 23 12:26:32 2013 UTC,I really like seeing art that doesn't steal characters' likenesses from the show. Thanks.
Dreadfort,1mxp11,Radient-Red,6,Mon Sep 23 20:28:24 2013 UTC,"Why does almost all fan-art portray Our Lord as a death-pale vampire with long black hair?   He's supposed to have an ""entirely ordinary"" face in the books, totally unremarkable apart from his colorless pale eyes. He doesn't really stand out from a crowd. I can't remember the books ever describing him as a Bela Lugosi lookalike.    (Before the TV show came out, I pictured Roose as looking like Kevin Spacey's character in Seven, but with pale eyes. Michael McElhatton does a good job of showing Roose's mask of sanity, with a few hints that something else might be going on under the surface.)"
Dreadfort,1mxp11,E-Nezzer,4,Wed Sep 25 10:27:35 2013 UTC,"I imagine it's because people tend to imagine Lord Bolton as a creepy-looking (that's a compliment, My Lord, I swear it!) individual because he's such a stone-cold, heartless guy. The vampire look comes about because that's the stereotypical portrayal of ""creepy"" this day and age.   I have to agree that I prefer the more realistic/truthful images of the Warden of the North - but at the same time all art done in honor of the most noble House Bolton is to be appreciated, and I feel that this portrait especially gets across the joyful, celebratory mood of the Dreadfort quite well!"
Dreadfort,1mxp11,Chrisehh,3,Wed Sep 25 23:28:31 2013 UTC,"Yeah, it bothers me as well. He's not supposed to stand out, looking like some comic book villain like most fan artists portray him. This is my favorite fan art of him, closer to what I pictured him to look like, before seeing him in the show, and still pretty similar to Michael McElhatton."

The flayed-man sword was made for the HBO show.   Roose Bolton, in the books at least, is a cold pragmatist. He doesn't strike me as a sentimental guy who would give bad-ass names and ornaments to his family's swords. A tool is just a tool. No point in romanticizing the thing, just stick them with the pointy end.  (He actually uses a dagger to kill Robb on the TV show, not a sword.

As someone who's been on hunting trips, I noticed that Ramsay's tools are totally wrong.   It seems like Ramsay is really bad at flaying. His knife is wrong, his technique is wrong. From what I remember, skinning a dead animal is a more like a slow methodical peeling, not the stabbing-and-ripping that happens to Theon's finger in episode 6. Ramsay isn't a hunter neatly skinning his prey, but more like a maniac tearing off random patches of skin from the victim."

Ramsay is described as wearing a red helmet, with a visor shaped like a flayed human face ""whose mouth was open in a scream of soundless anguish"", when he appears at the end of ACOK.

Dreadfort,1jfqdt,onebigroofiecircle,18,Wed Jul 31 18:41:40 2013 UTC,"The young lord actually prefers the girls to be a bit feral. Their breed isn't as much of a concern as their temper is - the more of a vicious bitch, the better!   As for choice? If the girls chose anyone other than the young lord i'd be shocked (and flayed). They were raised better than to side with ironborn scum.  Grey Jeyne, Helicent, Jez, Alison, Maude, Red Jeyne, Sara, and Willow would rip the heart out of Reek and fight over seconds.   Kyra might only watch, she's relatively new to the kennel."
Dreadfort,1jfqdt,RevOtisElevator,5,Wed Jul 31 18:48:13 2013 UTC,"Eh, there's no sign that Ramsay's ""girls"" are especially feral or vicious. They're highly trained dogs.

Even if he would decide to run away, they'd only really need to catch up with him and pin him down until Ramsay and his men arrive and they seem to do that when playing with him anyway. Reek rhymes with weak after all.  As for the breed...I always imagine kind of basic hunting dogs. Those are the ones that usually pop up in medieval pictures/sigils too."
Dreadfort,1jfqdt,_Ramsay_Bolton,6,Wed Jul 31 20:29:13 2013 UTC,"The dogs that pop up in medieval pictures are usually Greyhounds, which was the favorite breed of the nobility. IIRC, several dog breeds were included under that name, from the big fur-covered dogs we now call ""deerhounds"" to smaller decorative dogs.  I guess I pictured Ramsay's girls as big vicious Rottweilers when reading the book, even though it's ahistorical.  Also, will we see a dog with the charmingly dog-appropriate name 'Myranda' next season?"
Dreadfort,1jfqdt,_Ramsay_Bolton,4,Wed Jul 31 20:46:40 2013 UTC,"Yep. Greyhounds and the like. I can understand the Rottweiler thing,  I have seen some artists draw Ramsays dogs as Doberman even, but...that just clashes a bit too much with my medieval world view.  I will be quite disappointed if we don't get a dog with that name. Actually I'm still afraid we wont get the dogs at all,though I just can't see HBO passing on the whole ""hunting naked women through the forest"" stuff."
Dreadfort,1jfqdt,Danom,2,Wed Jul 31 21:19:21 2013 UTC,"Yeah. These scenes have that combo of fan-service nudity and ""slasher of the week"" shock value that HBO loves. I can't imagine them not picking up on the opportunity.  As for Ramsay's dog breeds...well, historically, medieval lords had a lot of different breeds in their kennels. There were special breeds for each job. We see a bit of this in ACOK, in the scene where Theon is hunting the Stark kids with dogs. (He brings along bloodhounds to track the kids, and mastiffs to kill the direwolves). I imagine that Ramsay's girls are closer to the latter, more of a ""fighter"" breed.   I don't know why I pictured Rottweilers when reading the book. Probably because there's something gentle and noble about Greyhounds that doesn't really fit Ramsay's nature - if he lived today, he'd probably have a pack of Rottweilers or Pitbulls or some other ""gangsta"" breed."
Dreadfort,1jfqdt,joelmiller92,2,Thu Aug 1 13:44:11 2013 UTC,"I also don't think Greyhounds would survive in the northern weather, they have short fur and not a lot of body fat. In colder climates people have to put sweaters on them I believe."

Dreadfort,1i8rjr,Radient-Red,21,Sat Jul 13 22:59:18 2013 UTC,"From what I've collected, there are two popular theories being tossed around:   Theon's torture porn is going to ramp down, and he'll be taken down off the device while Ramsay's sport is introduced. Myranda (Charlotte Hope) will take the role of Kyra and attempt escape with Theon, who will be revealed to be another victim of Ramsay's torture despite her sunny disposition in season 3. Having not gone full Reek-mode, Theon thinks he might actually have a shot again at getting away, Ramsay hunts them down, witnesses Myranda's grizzly rape and murder, loses a toe or a finger to stay in check (flayers gonna flay), and his mental anguish continues. The Reekoning finalizes this season.   My problem with this theory: In book cannon, his attempted escape with Kyra was (I believe) his first and only escape from the Dreadfort, and happened before he ""endures the worst of Ramsay's tortures"", so it might seem jarring to book readers and show watchers alike to have him run for the hills yet again. Because Myranda would be sincere in this context, the showrunners could easily pull it off.   Myranda will not be part of the hunt, but instead becomes a minor character of the Dreadfort and will eventually replace Jeyne Poole, a character not introduced in the show, and would no doubt need to be 18+ for her role as Fake Arya during Ramsay's bedding scene.    My problem with this theory: Fake Arya doesn't need to be a character introduced a season or two (two being the most likely candidate) before hand. I'd imagine the story would pace a lot better if they just waited until the season in question to start Fake Arya's storyline, which in my opinion would have to be the season Theon starts remembering who he is and makes his final, successful escape from Ramsay at Winterfell, bringing Fake Arya along with him.  Note: I have just woken up from a hangover nap, this post may come off as rambling. Sorry in advance."
Dreadfort,1i8rjr,Lonestarr1337,7,Sun Jul 14 02:02:04 2013 UTC,"It could also be more simple and Ramsay will be introduced for the season right during his favorite past time activity. Though I admit it would seem weird for the viewers to see Ramsay hunt the girl out of nowhere when they seemed ""friends"" before. So your first scenario makes most sense, but it does seem a repetitive plot then.  Also with how they established it in the last episode, Theon should be already pretty reekified by the time we see him again next season. Also shouldn't he get his butt moving to Moat Cailin (or wherever) soon? I mean he needs to do that before Roose returns and I can see them using this plot point for Theon next season (instead of more torture).  I can't really see her replacing fake!Arya because, while Ramsay does know she's fake, he is not supposed to. Using a girl he already knows for sure isn't the real Arya seems a bit....weird.   I really hope she wont become one of Ramsays ""bastard boys"" (or rather, girls) as many think. Would just seem OOC for Ramsay to have lady torture friends to me."
Dreadfort,1i8rjr,Paraplueschi,1 point,Sun Jul 14 09:12:55 2013 UTC,Honestly I hope they phase Theon out for a couple of seasons until he becomes relevant again and then we see his devastation as Reek. We don't need a weekly Theon update in the next couple of seasons simply because it is an easy part that can be cut to make room for other stuff. I hope instead they focus on the Bastard boys and Ramsay more instead of making it all about Theon bitching and groaning about his past because it just makes Ramsay's character no better than a faceless torturer rather than a player in the game.
Dreadfort,1i8rjr,Paraplueschi,8,Tue Aug 20 21:21:29 2013 UTC,It seems overly gracious of Ramsay to give a woman he hunts a horse though....hmm.

Dreadfort,1gbcqn,Pinksister,5,Fri Jun 14 10:26:23 2013 UTC,There's also been a moment or two of Simon on Mistfits that uses Atmosphere by Joy Division in the background. Without a doubt Simon's character is a take on Ian Curtis.
Dreadfort,1gbcqn,rockerlkj,3,Fri Jun 14 22:21:23 2013 UTC,"So within the context of the show, is the character based off Ian Curtis just because the writers/producers wanted to have an homage to him, or is Simon trying to emulate Ian because he's a fan himself?"
Dreadfort,1gbcqn,fapbait,3,Fri Jun 14 17:07:48 2013 UTC,That's exactly what's always run through my mind watching Misfits. I like to think it's the latter.

Dreadfort,1g1u4b,generalscruff,27,Mon Jun 10 15:55:52 2013 UTC,"Transcript of last night's letter:  ""Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North.   I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the north, and back to those shit-stained rocks you call a home. On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still in our lands, and flay them living, the way I flayed the twenty ironborn scum I found at Winterfell.  In the box you'll find a special gift. Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him. Leave the north now or more boxes will follow  with more Theon. Signed Ramsay [REDACTED], natural son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North"""
Dreadfort,1g1u4b,RevOtisElevator,7,Mon Jun 10 16:55:43 2013 UTC,"The maester must have been taking down Ramsay's words and presumed to ""correct"" him. I trust he will learn his lesson."
Dreadfort,1g1u4b,BardsSword,7,Mon Jun 10 20:34:33 2013 UTC,"I'm fairly sure Ramsay's letter to Jon was actually sent by Stannis (and Theon). There's strong hints in the spoiler chapter from TWOW.   Even in ADWD, the letter isn't described in the same way as Ramsay's previous letters. It's neatly written in maester's ink, for one. And it doesn't have any pieces of skin as proof. We know that Ramsay's letters are normally written in jumbled serial-killer scrawling, often with blood instead of ink."
Dreadfort,1g1u4b,Radient-Red,4,Mon Jun 10 19:59:48 2013 UTC,The same way I thought Ned was gonna go to the North to meet with Jon and return South. The same way I had hoped the Lord of Light would also resurrect Robb into some terrible wolf-man-beast (that's pretty stupid though). The same way I believed Dany would be in Westeros by the fifth book.  I want to believe...
Dreadfort,1g1u4b,balloseater,4,Tue Jun 11 16:21:49 2013 UTC,Our Lord does not make empty threats! That bastard Jon Snow would better comply.  If he even lives. But people tend to come back quite a lot in the later books.
Dreadfort,1g1u4b,Thuruk,4,Mon Jun 10 16:30:13 2013 UTC,Here is a very nicely rendered version of said letter
Dreadfort,1g1u4b,DesWillenMacht,2,Mon Jun 10 18:47:02 2013 UTC,"My only problem with that is: isn't the ""ink"" described as being brown and flaking? I always thought it was blood."
Dreadfort,1g1u4b,OldClockMan,5,Mon Jun 10 22:16:41 2013 UTC,"Nope, the ""BASTARD"" letter is written in neat handwriting and normal ink.   Which is why I seriously doubt it was Ramsay who sent it, since his hate-letters (as seen in Asha's first chapter) are usually scribbled in dry flaking blood. Not to mention that Ramsay wouldn't know all these specifics about wildling princes and so on."
Dreadfort,1g1u4b,Radient-Red,2,Mon Jun 10 22:21:09 2013 UTC,"Really? I can't find that in the text. In fact it doesn't mention anything about the letter, except the smear of pink wax"
Dreadfort,1g1u4b,OldClockMan,5,Mon Jun 10 22:32:06 2013 UTC,"The letter to Asha is described like this:  The signatures were done in maester’s ink, made of soot and coal tar, but the message above was scrawled in brown in a huge, spiky hand. It spoke of the fall of Moat Cailin, of the triumphant return of the Warden of the North to his domains, of a marriage soon to be made. The first words were, “I write this letter in the blood of ironmen,” the last, “I send you each a piece of prince. Linger in my lands, and share his fate.”  And the letter to Jon like this:  “Might be all a skin o’ lies.” Tormund scratched under his beard. “If I had me a nice goose quill and a pot o’ maester’s ink, I could write down that me member was long and thick as me arm, wouldn’t make it so.”  Also, re-read the Theon chapter from TWOW. You'll see that some of the things Theon tells Stannis are repeated verbatim in the ""BASTARD"" letter."
Dreadfort,1g1u4b,Radient-Red,2,Tue Jun 11 00:19:07 2013 UTC,but why would Stannis or Theon send that letter?
Dreadfort,1g1u4b,megatom0,2,Tue Jun 11 23:42:36 2013 UTC,Because the false king clearly knows he will need the help to have any chance of facing our lord.

Dreadfort,1fwi5w,TheBoraxKid,3,Sat Jun 8 18:40:20 2013 UTC,"The first minute or so is a throwback to the chaotic, escalating themes used in Season 2 when Theon captures Winterfell.  Specifically a very similar theme is used in the scene where he executes Ser Rodrik.  I believe the song is called ""Pay the Iron Price.""  Edit:  If this song indeed is used for Theon learning his name, it's an apt throwback.  ""Pay the Iron Price"" is used in scenes where Theon discovers what it takes to command the Ironborn, that he must be forceful and show strength.  To throwback to that as he discovers he must be submissive is a good showcase of situational irony."

The Starks have forgotten this due to Ned Starks predilection towards diplomacy instead of beautiful violence.  Remember how Karstark wanted to avenge his slain with blood? Such is the way of the North, though some Southron folk may call this brutal, we call it justifiable.  Lord Bolton realizes that he must create the North anew, and rid it from the shackles of Ned Starks obsession with honor and morality.  The folk of the North come first, leave the Southron lords to fight their wars and slaughter their peasants.  The Lannisters care about their gold and leaving a legacy throughout the ages, and are willing to sacrifice thousands of young men in order to reach that end.  Stannis Baratheon is no better.  He believes that he would be some great king, and will slaughter all his men to prove it. Everyone realizes this. The Greyjoys want what they simple cannot have, and this is very counterproductive when considering the wellbeing of their own people.    Lord Bolton did the North a favor by helping to destroy the Wolves, now there may be a chance of peace and the death of Northerners can come to and end.

Dreadfort,1fstu0,balloseater,2,Wed Jun 12 14:38:15 2013 UTC,"Series Roose seems pretty damn evil. He is portrayed as petty and cocky. Book Roose is not. He is brutal and merciless, but his intentions are not 'evil'. He does not joke of less fortunate men or betray solely for the sake of treachery. He is loyal to his house and his family. Or is that what he is really working for?  You can't tell. As far as you know, or anybody knows, his face is nothing but a concrete wall. He never shows the slightest hint of his intentions. Nobody knows but Roose  He is a man who lives in his mind, and has never neglected to sharpen it. He is a tactical thinker and a decision maker. He leaves no space for weakness, no room for useless things like compassion and love, unlike Tyrion who hides his longing behind his cunning character. In this aspect, Roose was better than Robb, as manifested by the Red Wedding.  Roose Bolton is truly a favorite character of mine, and not because of the cruel irony of loving the antagonists of this contemporary tragedy. I love book Roose. His taciturnity and decisiveness in the face of so much chaos is just so fucking badass.  Now I know the writers needed a good segue and audience informant of Ramsey Bolton's identity, but I wish they had not done it at the expense of Roose's character. In the last episode, he is joking around with Walder Frey. I'd like to think that it's mostly for diplomacy, but Book Roose would not bother with the lowly likes of him. He and Tywin knew he was the perfect scapegoat for all the anger. The worst part is that Series Roose decides to share the secret of Winterfell's siege with Walder. For me, any Roose enthusiast would think that's bullshit. Roose keeps to himself, not only the secrets, but the subtleties of daily communication. Nobody ever knew what he was thinking or what he was up to. That's Book Roose for you.  Ramsey, shit, now that fucker is pretty evil."
Dreadfort,1fstu0,Offensive_Brute,1 point,Thu Jun 6 23:03:39 2013 UTC,TIL Roose Bolton is the Don Corleone of Westeros.  Also it was made pretty clear that Roose donst think highly of Walder Frey. That hollow smile he gave when Walder Frey dismissed the potential for reprisal from The Blackfish says it all.
Dreadfort,1fstu0,balloseater,1 point,Tue Jun 11 17:38:45 2013 UTC,"I don't buy that so much because he offered a quip of his own, ""Forever young"". Knowing Roose's character, he wouldn't even bother to let whatever he was thinking known. He only feels the need for others to fear or respect him, not to know he's clever with his wordplay. In fact, what I mention next doesn't support his condescension for Frey.  I know that the fact that Roose spilled his plans with his bastard in the North was used to explain to the audience what was going on, but that is a terrible excuse for a plot device. It dilutes the character and cheapens the work. It was pretty out of character for me.  Wow this was written terribly, but I wrote this while having to leave for school. Bye~"

Dreadfort,1fso3o,TheThirdLevel,16,Fri Jun 7 00:37:20 2013 UTC,Robb's wife was a constant insult to Walder Frey. A message had to be sent not just to the Starks but to all who break their oaths to the Freys.
Dreadfort,1fso3o,TheJediCounsel,6,Thu Jun 6 15:47:46 2013 UTC,Exactly honestly she deserved it even showing up to the wedding. And Lord Walder even gave her all those nice compliments about what's under her dress.
Dreadfort,1fso3o,Thuruk,5,Thu Jun 6 19:33:35 2013 UTC,I think the point of that scene was to subtly imply that Walder Frey knew she was pregnant.
Dreadfort,1fso3o,nyrmduck,3,Fri Jun 7 14:35:27 2013 UTC,"Oh I was thinking more about her firm tatas, but I guess both work."

Dreadfort,1fn01m,Chrisseeh,39,Tue Jun 4 07:37:34 2013 UTC,"I really liked the switch from a sword to a dagger.  One of the reviews of the episode (from a non-reader reviewer) said it nicely:   In a typical fantasy epic, Ned would have been the hero; the only thing heavier than his chain mail was his conscience. Way back in the pilot, Lord Stark taught his boys an important life lesson when he meted out rough justice upon a deserter, saying ""He who passes the sentence should swing the sword."" But sword-swinging is a creaky and clunky way to get things done in a more modern era, one when the line of fate separating those handling the blade and those receiving it is smaller than Roose Bolton's bar tab...The most shocking scene on television in 2013 was a quick and brutal affair carried out with daggers, crossbows, and slithery, secondhand deceit. The Starks prayed to the Old Gods to the very end, but it was their allegiance to the old ways that cost them everything.   Swords are for fights.

Dreadfort,1fn01m,INSANITY_RAPIST,7,Tue Jun 4 21:24:03 2013 UTC,Here it is:  http://www.grantland.com/blog/hollywood-prospectus/post/_/id/78605/game-of-thrones-season-3-episode-9-its-like-rains-on-your-wedding-day  Every week I go to WinterIsComing's round up of reviews (which links to this one) and categorizes them as book-reader and non-reader:  http://winteriscoming.net/2013/06/recap-round-up-the-rains-of-castamere/
Dreadfort,1fn01m,A_Polite_Noise,7,Tue Jun 4 21:32:31 2013 UTC,I always imagined it to be a spear with a massive thrust and then a twist in the heart. No idea why?
Dreadfort,1fn01m,Whowhat91,14,Tue Jun 4 11:35:10 2013 UTC,it very explicitly said he used a sword.
Dreadfort,1fn01m,Manisil,5,Tue Jun 4 15:11:20 2013 UTC,"Yeah thats why I have no idea why it remains in my head as:   Robb on the ground kneeling, feathered with arrows, he looks up with roose mid thrust sporting his pink cape. ""Jaime Lannister sends his regards"" and then bam spear to the heart followed by a twist that kills robb.>it very explicitly said he used a sword."
Dreadfort,1fn01m,Whowhat91,2,Tue Jun 4 16:04:20 2013 UTC,"Have you seen the sword they gave him for the show? The hilt is awesome. I wish the final blow was as it was in the books, with a close up of the sword, cause it looks awesome."
Dreadfort,1fn01m,7V3N,1 point,Fri Jun 7 01:20:23 2013 UTC,"Indeed, the flayed sword."
Dreadfort,1fn01m,Chrisseeh,42,Fri Jun 7 02:26:24 2013 UTC,I takes a real man to wear pink! A Bolton Man!
Dreadfort,1fn01m,95DarkFire,14,Tue Jun 4 11:12:30 2013 UTC,Because our lord is fabulous.
Dreadfort,1fn01m,Chrisseeh,22,Tue Jun 4 12:08:14 2013 UTC,not nearly pink enough
Dreadfort,1fn01m,wjapple,39,Tue Jun 4 11:47:32 2013 UTC,"By the gods man, you can't just throw aniline dyes around as if they weren't a result of Victorian era technology. It'd be madness! Madness and anarchy!"
Dreadfort,1fn01m,Hotseflots,5,Tue Jun 4 13:31:05 2013 UTC,http://i.qkme.me/3tok8k.jpg.
Dreadfort,1fn01m,twitchedawake,16,Tue Jun 11 06:17:57 2013 UTC,"Was anyone else kinda disappointed how... quick it was? I always envisioned this slow and dramatic stroll down the hall among a lane of corpses to a Kneeling Wolf-King, then there would be this cruelly slow press of the sword into his heart, Robb too wounded to do anything and the steel cut into him inch by inch. The The camera pans to reveal The Roose's face, ""Jaime Lannister... sends his regards... /inhale/ twist and Robb's death scream.   In the episode, he just kinda steps in from no where and then steps away. The focus wasn't his betrayal at all."
Dreadfort,1fn01m,Teiris,3,Tue Jun 4 21:51:34 2013 UTC,"I envisioned a quick run through up to the hilt, so they're like nose to nose."
Dreadfort,1fn01m,Turnshroud,3,Tue Jun 4 22:33:18 2013 UTC,"Yeah, seemed off.  But the thing is. Did anyone else think that the sequence starting at Tallisa's stabbing seemed almost as if they hit fast-forward by a few frames? It seemed unrealistically fast."
Dreadfort,1fn01m,vidrageon,2,Wed Jun 5 02:24:10 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I think the only disappointment is because we've built this event up soooo much in our heads, and as we are Bolton fans envisioned an incredibly central role to Roose in the betrayal (which he did have, but now more before than during), but if you read the chapter, it only slows down because Cat cannot process the events going on around her fast enough, and it's incredibly chaotic. In the show, they showed how exactly that event would've gone down - fast, brutal, and mercilessly."
Dreadfort,1fn01m,Enforcer721,8,Wed Jun 5 06:25:18 2013 UTC,"Roose was like: Stab , twist.  flies away"
Dreadfort,1fn01m,HowlandReedsButthole,11,Tue Jun 4 23:03:33 2013 UTC,"I swear I heard him say ""Deal with it"" as he exited."
Dreadfort,1fn01m,vadergeek,3,Wed Jun 5 07:08:18 2013 UTC,"What, did our lord Roose find the Green Lantern ring?   I jest, but a purple cape on lord Bolton is an unusual choice. Pink is more his color."
Dreadfort,1fn01m,Thuruk,4,Wed Jun 5 02:16:28 2013 UTC,Hey now. I've drunk too much and played with knives around people for less than that. I believe the candlelight makes the colour look darker than it is. That must be it.
Dreadfort,1fn01m,Thuruk,7,Wed Jun 5 04:10:49 2013 UTC,I hate you all.  sob
Dreadfort,1fn01m,Chrisseeh,12,Tue Jun 4 12:46:26 2013 UTC,Tissue?
Dreadfort,1fn01m,INSANITY_RAPIST,9,Tue Jun 4 14:09:48 2013 UTC,Yeah right. A tissue?  More like a tissue MADE OF CHAIN MAIL!  AHHHH I HATE YOU ALL

Dreadfort,1fn25m,OldClockMan,6,Tue Jun 4 17:11:06 2013 UTC,-Clap-Clap-Clap- Im sure our trueborn lord would be satified with this.
Dreadfort,1fn25m,Chrisseeh,3,Wed Jun 5 00:21:12 2013 UTC,Somebody needs to sing this and post on youtube. With the original music track and all.

Dreadfort,1fn25m,Smokeebaer420,6,Tue Jun 4 15:45:47 2013 UTC,"We are happy, any way to prove our loyalty to the Warden of the north... and we are only happier that our friends of Frey will be the only other ones joining us... the gods only know how many leagues are between us and Stannis, hopefully all the Freys will survive the journey."
Dreadfort,1fn25m,Drunknreverend13,5,Tue Jun 4 16:02:13 2013 UTC,"Im sure our Frey friends will fight bravely and honorably, and if they die we white harbor men will send our deepest regards to the twins. The north remembers after all."
Dreadfort,1fn25m,Smokeebaer420,2,Tue Jun 4 16:31:01 2013 UTC,"Aye, the north remembers, and the mummer's farce is almost done. Should the Frey men die, we will send as many remains back to the twins as possible, and a pie for all those we couldn't find"

Dreadfort,1fm2ip,Yogurthead,5,Tue Jun 4 02:30:31 2013 UTC,Our Lord Roose is quite the fan of T-Swift.  Although King Joffrey Bieber (I mean Baratheon) is his favorite.

Just a suggestion for someone with more skills than I."
Dreadfort,1fm2ip,RevenantCommunity,-15,Sat Jul 20 12:43:40 2013 UTC,"So, Boltons... how're things going in Winterfell right now?  It would be a shame if your men were being killed and demoralised before Stannis even began his attack... and it would be an even bigger shame if the North knew what you people did and took vengeance...  SO WORTH THE DOWNVOTES"
Dreadfort,1fm2ip,Chrisseeh,14,Tue Jun 4 09:48:45 2013 UTC,This one deserves a lesson of Bolton traditions.

Dreadfort,1fm2ip,Chrisseeh,7,Tue Jun 4 10:40:00 2013 UTC,Yes and where are the ships of your isolated master? Oh yes. Withering in blackwater bay. Along with those thousands of men he threw away.

I bet they'd be shocked and appalled and angry, and sad, and down right depressed. If Robb wanted to be King in The North he should have taken his banner men back to Moat Cailin.

Dreadfort,1fixcj,DarthEwok42,19,Sun Jun 2 16:43:59 2013 UTC,"In his early twenties, I'd guess. From what we know, he was born before Robert's Rebellion, since it's mentioned that Rickard Stark was still the Lord of Winterfell at the time of his birth. So he's definitely older than Robb's generation, though still fairly young - several characters call him ""the boy"".  He'd be around Theon's age, most likely."
Dreadfort,1fixcj,Radient-Red,3,Sun Jun 2 17:22:42 2013 UTC,"Thanks.  That makes sense, I just for some reason assumed he was older when I was reading the books."

Dreadfort,1filx3,gammaltant,5,Sun Jun 2 17:50:38 2013 UTC,Isn't it a mix of different types of spices and sugar?
Dreadfort,1filx3,Radient-Red,3,Sun Jun 2 17:52:04 2013 UTC,"Hippocras tastes like hot, spiced, aromatic wine. Which is what it is. I guess the taste really varies, depending on how much sugar, honey and spices (cinnamon, cloves, ginger, etc) you put in. There seems to be a lot of ingredients in hippocras, so there's probably hundreds of ways to make it.   I've tried something similar to hippocras, a mulled wine called Glühwein. It was fairly heavy, from what I remember, and also a bit similar (but less sweet) to sangria.   Here are recipes for red and white hippocras."
Dreadfort,1filx3,Radient-Red,10,Sun Jun 2 21:35:44 2013 UTC,"Cont'd:  I found this recipe on the ASOIAF cookbook site (yes, this exists) for hot spiced wine. It's basically the same thing as hippocras.  Our Lord Roose is a drinker of hippocras, IIRC, since it's really warming on cold winter nights. In ye olde days, hippocras was used as a medicinal wine. I imagine that Roose Bolton only drinks a particular sort of hippocras (and not the sugar-overdosed sort that Cersei drinks), without much sugar and other unhealthy junk. Roose's wine is probably full of healthy spices like cinnamon, and protein-rich nuts and berries. He seems to be very concerned with what he puts in his body.  In a world of disgustingly obese and unhealthy people, Our Lord is a wonderful paragon of health."

Dreadfort,1fapo6,kayozz,27,Wed May 29 22:13:01 2013 UTC,"All I want is the pink cloak. All we've seen of Michael McElhatton is leather and plate mail. All the other Lords have had at least one doublet and heraldic embroidering outfit.  Just give him this chance.   Smoke-black, criss-crossing quilted doublet, studded with garnets, and sewn with pink thread. Black suede/velvet gloves and boots, with red threaded scroll work. Two black leather pouches worn at the waist-side, made to look reminiscent of bare muscles. Clasped with small, black iron Saltires. One big enough to carry several pieces of prince, and other assorted documents, the other with a handy flask of Hippocras. Matching Sword and Dagger set with screaming, flayed head pommels. Black leather breeches A deep, red-pink cloak, with drops of blood picked out, and fastened with a flayed man on a Saltire clasp, in onyx and ruby. Hemmed in the style of blood droplets, collared with (of course) grey wolf fur.   This outfit brought to you by Bespoke Flayers of Dreadfort, est. 126 AL."
Dreadfort,1fapo6,OldClockMan,5,Thu May 30 04:48:57 2013 UTC,"McElhatton better be using this sword when he ""does the deed"" (and vastly improves the show's quality).   Here is a more detailed look at the Bolton longsword and its design."
Dreadfort,1fapo6,Radient-Red,4,Fri May 31 18:49:28 2013 UTC,"Well that's fucking cool as anything ever. Although, I do think that a flayed head pommel would be better. That looks awkward to hold."
Dreadfort,1fapo6,OldClockMan,2,Fri May 31 19:31:08 2013 UTC,"A flayed head pommel might look more aesthetically cool, though it'd be very impractical. The body is the sword's grip, while the outstretched arms form the crossguard.   Maybe a screaming flayed head on Bolton's signet ring, carved of red garnet, would look better."
Dreadfort,1fapo6,Radient-Red,1 point,Fri May 31 19:46:18 2013 UTC,"Why would it be impractical? Ser Jaime has a lion's head pommel, John Snow has a wolf's head pommel, and again Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail both have lion head pommels.  Here's a sword with a skull pommel, which is fairly similar. That would be much easier to hold than a flayed body sword, as it has a leather grip molded to fit the hand. Also, Bolton's existing sword doesn't even have a pommel, so it would be even harder to wield (a pommel is needed to add weight and balance to a sword)"
Dreadfort,1fapo6,OldClockMan,1 point,Fri May 31 19:55:42 2013 UTC,"Oh, now I see what you mean. I thought you said the flayed body should be reversed, with the head down and feet up (which would be impractical as hell). But yeah, it'd be more easy and practical to have a normal sword grip with a pommel at the end, rather than a whole hilt shaped like a flayed man. And our Lord Roose (may blessings and leeches be upon him) is nothing if not practical.  I like the sword design as a whole, though. It fits the general Bolton aesthetic without being too over-the-top and broadcasting ""THIS IS A BAD GUY"", like a sword hilt of human bone or a cloak of human skin would do.    (Although I imagine that the early Boltons flew the flayed skins of their enemies as banners, and only later changed to a stylized depiction of a flayed man on a flag.)"

I find it pretty unimaginative that they gave the Boltons a boring ""villain color scheme"" of black and red. We've seen it before. Yawn.   The sigil design itself, colors aside, was fine. Although I imagined the flayed man to be a dark red color and with a more detailed flayed face, with bug-eyed features and screaming in agony; in other words, more like a real-life victim of flaying (look for pics of skinned victims of Mexican cartels, at your own risk).   As for the pink background on the banner...I don't imagine a hot pink or rose color, but a desaturated pale pink, closer to the color of human skin. The top-left color on this chart is how I imagine Bolton's pink.   Overall, that is pretty close to how I imagined the Bolton sigil."

Having the Boltons in crimson and pale pink would make them much more visually distinct.   (Not to mention that it's more historically accurate - medieval nobles set themselves apart by wearing colorful silk and samite whenever they could, rather than dressing like the common troops. If they could afford it, they flaunted it. The whole ""historical realism = everyone wears dull greys and blacks"" is mostly a Hollywood idea.)

Dreadfort,1emjwt,The_Ashgale,74,Sun May 19 11:25:23 2013 UTC,"Roose Bolton is an interesting man. Not only does he have the leadership qualities of a northerner, but he knows how to play politics with the Lannisters. The Starks are fine, but they're just too vanilla. Everything is put through their perspective and we're made to think they're the most perfect characters. It all depends on point of view. I wouldn't say the Starks are bad, but Roose Bolton has done a better job of both uniting and protecting the northman since his establishment of Warden. I think he's a smart, interesting and good leader and strategist who gets a bad rap (like Jaime) for what might be considered his finest act. He ended the war.  And Ramsay is just so terrifying it's entertaining."

Dreadfort,1emjwt,Steelshanks,9,Wed May 22 09:08:17 2013 UTC,"You're completely ignoring the fact that Roose enjoys torture and flaying, as well as being perfectly ok with rape"
Dreadfort,1emjwt,mwatson26,8,Mon May 20 20:29:58 2013 UTC,"Rape? He was just claiming first night. It was obviously his right as a lord. Dear me, Watson. Dear me."
Dreadfort,1emjwt,Steelshanks,6,Thu May 23 21:04:33 2013 UTC,"He referred to it as rape though, so it's really rape"
Dreadfort,1emjwt,SaintMune,6,Thu May 23 23:49:29 2013 UTC,"I guess if you want to be really picky about it, but does it really matter? I mean, our lord said himself that she was hardly worth the rope used to hang her traitorous husband."
Dreadfort,1emjwt,_Apostate_,4,Fri May 24 12:27:20 2013 UTC,I agree. The idea of Roose raping Ramsay's mother is the most disappointing detail of House Bolton. I personally choose to ignore it and I really hope it's not mentioned in the show so that I can more easily accept that canon.   As far as the torturing and flaying goes I think it's that bit of horrifying cruelty that makes Roose all the more interesting. It's like I'm watching Saw and he wants to play a gameofthrones
Dreadfort,1emjwt,mwatson26,2,Mon May 20 23:00:27 2013 UTC,"But it's his right as lord. First night.   First night is an effective way of keeping a people submissive, and peace in the grand scheme of things is much more important than the sexual purity of wives.

Remember friend, this is fiction we're talking about, being a good member of society has nothing to do with anything. When I'm reading a book I check my morality at the door and just enjoy it. It's not hurting anyone, so I like to ride the experience. I'll never understand people who all moralistic about imaginary crimes. That's not just a buzzkill, it's also illogical."

Dreadfort,1emjwt,vidrageon,23,Mon May 20 14:31:53 2013 UTC,"In all honesty, when I stopped by this subreddit, I thought all the bolton love was purely ironic. But over time, I've come to see why some people appreciate Roose. Ramsay is just so audaciously cruel that you have to be entertained by him as well.  I still see them as villains, and I am a Stark-lover at heart, but they're damn effective at what they do. Roose feels totally justified in his actions, and as others have said, he did likely save the North from losing a long and drawn out war. Their competence, cunning, and cruelty, makes them incredibly satisfying villains to watch."
Dreadfort,1emjwt,Steelshanks,14,Sun May 19 16:09:11 2013 UTC,"I agree, they're total villains - and some people just like supporting the bad guy. Good guys are boring. When I was a kid, when we'd play, I'd always pretend to be the henchman of the villains, a stormtrooper to Darth Vader, a robber rather than a cop, an orc under Sauron's command. Villains are cool."

Dreadfort,1emjwt,Twelvey,16,Mon May 20 02:51:48 2013 UTC,"I think it's a combination of cold calculation in Lord Roose, and manic psychopathy in Ramsay. Roose is enigmatic, while Ramsay's intentions are writ clear, yet they are both clearly cut from the same cloth. This range of interesting characters, not to mention the interesting aspect of superficially appearing law-abiding and loyal (a quiet land, a peaceful people) in direct contrast with their use of flaying and torture (a naked man holds few secrets, a flayed man none) and underlying cunning adds to it.  Pink is also a lovely colour, and (show only) they have a range of interesting underlings, from Locke, Steelshanks Walton and Bart the bear."

Essentially, anytime you fight a battle, you play a house card.  Eddard Stark has a +4 attack bonus and kills two enemies.  Roose Bolton has a +2 bonus, but if he loses the fight, you get your entire discard pile back, including Roose Bolton.  This allows the Stark player to repeatedly use their best card, every single turn if played correctly.  Therefore, I like Roose Bolton"

The actor who plays Locke is fantastic - I found myself skipping much of Hoat's dialogue in the books because he was just a comical villain, 2D and forseeable. I find that Locke is a great 3D-like character that really shows what is truly important in the world - gold that other 'important' people have imposed on a civilisation, or pure sadistic pleasure...  I dunno, I just like the actor :D"

Dreadfort,1ekku7,YourOldPalHoward,2,Tue May 21 07:57:53 2013 UTC,"I really like Locke. He brings some class/materialism angles into GoT. From the very beginning you can plainly see his seething hatred of highborns. His values aren't material, they derive from his own intrinsic pleasure, pleasure is all there is. He hates that the ""upper classes"" feel they can look down on him (sounds like Ramsay) or buy him with their material wealth. PERFECT Bolton man, he's recently become one of my top five favorite characters.   It also reminds me of the riddle that Varys tells Tyrion. I wonder which of the three men would have died if it was Locke holding the sword. Probably all three of those privileged cunts."

While they're busy attacking Winterfell, let us grace /r/ironislands with flayed men, images of your lord... perhaps with Reek.

Dreadfort,1egiz6,echofinder,20,Thu May 16 16:33:31 2013 UTC,By what methods will we defeat the heathen pretender Stannis the Impotent?   ...by slowly peeling his skin off his body?
Dreadfort,1egiz6,Das_Mime,3,Thu May 16 17:43:12 2013 UTC,"The Karstarks were a sizeable chunk of the Rabid Wolf's army and I see them having no problems supporting the true Warden of the North and the man who helped avenge the untimely death of Lord Rickard. Not to mention having the armies of the Freys and Lannisters at our back only further cements the power of our house.  Short of R'hllor himself showing that stupid un-flayed face of his, Stannis and his red witch are as good as mounted on our Lord's wall."
Dreadfort,1egiz6,Cazraac,6,Fri May 17 06:13:11 2013 UTC,"Well, I imagine Lord Roose is either  a) going to have to father more sons fast  or  b) leave it up to the Freys and Lannisters. Gods know Frey has enough heirs to plant in the North."
Dreadfort,1egiz6,lotictrance,7,Thu May 16 20:25:30 2013 UTC,Roose said he wants no more children.
Dreadfort,1egiz6,Steelshanks,5,Thu May 16 21:06:39 2013 UTC,"Lord Roose, he will take a finger for that.  Lord Ramsay is the only trueborn son our Lord Roose needs."
Dreadfort,1egiz6,Steelshanks,3,Fri May 17 03:54:35 2013 UTC,My apologies to my lord Roose Bolton!

Dreadfort,1egiz6,vidrageon,1 point,Sat May 18 07:45:15 2013 UTC,"When one plays the Game of Thrones, one wins or one dies."
Dreadfort,1egiz6,vidrageon,3,Tue May 21 08:00:49 2013 UTC,"In all seriousness, I don't think he has a plan. I think he wanted to put House Bolton as Lord Paramounts of the North, wed the 'Stark girl' to cement the position, and try to steer Ramsay into something more manageable, or even get him killed after he impregnates the 'Stark girl', but aside from that, he seems to portray a rather nihilistic perspective - he's given up hope of seeing a trueborn son after Domeric died, having expressed a lack of desire for heirs from Fat Walda out of a belief that Ramsay would just murder them (which he probably would). I think, at the end of the day, Roose wants a quiet land, a peaceful people, and he wants Ramsay to harness his psychopathy to more along those lines. Roose watches, observes, and plans, detached from the seeming chaos around him."
Dreadfort,1egiz6,Lymah,2,Fri May 17 21:48:51 2013 UTC,"That is why I believe he does have a plan - those who are detached have the best ability to think critically & realistically. Never thought about RAMSEY's potential children... that would solve the biggest conundrum, wouldn't it? As much as I respect & love our Trueborn Lord, he was not build for governance of realms..."
Dreadfort,1egiz6,vidrageon,3,Sat May 18 07:43:58 2013 UTC,"Roose has found himself in a tricky situation. He took advantage of a political alliance and a well-timed betrayal of a losing cause, all the while sacrificing other Lords' men and keeping Bolton men out of the fray. I think it was opportunistic, if not well-planned and meticulously thought, but now that he is Lord Paramount of the North, and put the Boltons back as the most powerful house in the North, I don't think he has really planned where to go next.   I think he reckons it's better to be Lord Paramount of the North with a legitimised son who is sadistic and unpredictable, than be Lord of the Dreadfort with a bastard who is sadistic and unpredictable."
Dreadfort,1egiz6,Lymah,2,Sat May 18 07:49:39 2013 UTC,"I don't see him as a character that much cares to move farther up the ladder. He knows what he's got and he's content to hold it. He doesn't seem the type to me to overreach, and I think he fears to grab up anything else and become to obvious about it. Taking the North is quite enough attention as it is. Someone is bound to counter him if he goes for more."
Dreadfort,1egiz6,baconfarmer,1 point,Tue May 21 08:07:03 2013 UTC,"I agree with that, I think he's been quite happy with his lot, even if he is opportunistic."
