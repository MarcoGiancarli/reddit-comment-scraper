CyanideandHappiness,399lpw,youre_a_tard,5,Wed Jun 10 18:52:51 2015 UTC,"It may not be correct grammar, but it's sure as hell used colloquially. It's not a dissertation, it's a webcomic.   What some usage authorities consider illegitimate is dropping “to be” and using a PAST participle, as in “the house needs cleaned” or “that child needs spanked.” There’s a good explanation of this in the usage note with “need” in The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (5th ed.).  However, this truncated expression (“needs washed,” “needs fixed,” and so on) is a well-known usage common to many widely scattered regions of the United States. It’s even more common in Britain, particularly northern England and Scotland. I would classify it as a dialectal usage, rather than incorrect.  There are two other ways to say this, both well established and both considered correct: “needs to be washed,” or “needs washing” (which I always heard as a kid growing up in Iowa). Since “washing” in this case is a gerund, meaning that it serves the function of a noun, “the car needs washing” is perfectly logical, like “he enjoys swimming.”  http://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2007/10/need-to-know.html"

Lately they have been the very obvious twist like the house playing the dead guys ribs like a xylophone. It was so obvious.  You guys are known for trying to lead someone into thinking one thing is going to happen and then you do something completely different and completely ridiculous. Like this one did.  I like your work a lot and I appreciate you not getting offended by my comment not many people would have been so cool about it. It wasn't meant to be a malicious comment.

CyanideandHappiness,2wruew,snacksmoto,2,Sun Feb 22 22:38:53 2015 UTC,"Cathy:       Cathy is a comic strip drawn by Cathy Guisewite. It features a woman who struggles through the ""four basic guilt groups"" of life—food, love, family, and work. The strip gently pokes fun at the lives and foibles of modern women. Cathy's characteristics and issues both made fun of and sometimes fed into negative stereotypes about women. The strip debuted on November 22, 1976, and at its peak appeared in over 1,400 newspapers. The strips have been collected into more than 20 books. Three television specials were also created. Guisewite received the National Cartoonists Society Reuben Award in 1992 for the strip.

CyanideandHappiness,2wqkag,bbplay_13,9,Sun Feb 22 06:05:46 2015 UTC,Is there some sort of context for this one I'm missing? Is his reaction in the last frame a reference to something?
CyanideandHappiness,2wqkag,garbear007,10,Sun Feb 22 15:30:59 2015 UTC,I think the joke is that he 'recycled' part of the old newspaper comics by using the art from Cathy.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy
CyanideandHappiness,2wqkag,DBerwick,0,Sun Feb 22 15:44:04 2015 UTC,Sooo this was directed to 2% of people that know this?
CyanideandHappiness,2wqkag,FDisk80,3,Sun Feb 22 23:06:17 2015 UTC,"It may surprise you to learn that newspapers used to be fairly popular, whippersnapper. And while I don't consider this their top material, I often get the feeling this comic is written for their own amusement, more than anyone else. The fact that it's so popular is just a fortunate coincidence."
CyanideandHappiness,2wqkag,DBerwick,1 point,Sun Feb 22 23:09:41 2015 UTC,I still look at Sunday Comics I knew that face look familiar.
CyanideandHappiness,2wqkag,ayoungjacknicholson,0,Mon Feb 23 00:31:05 2015 UTC,"They probably assumed that if you're reading a comic strip, you're probably a fan of comic strips. While I never really cared for Cathy, a lot of people did. It's even been referenced in the Simpsons and in 30 Rock. Comic strips used to be a big part of American culture because everyone read them before the internet took over. Just because you never heard of it, doesn't mean it isn't popular."

Teacher says he can't accept the exam, student says ""Do you know who I am?"", teacher says ""I have absolutely no idea"", student says ""Good"" and puts his exam among all the other exams."
