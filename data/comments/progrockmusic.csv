progrockmusic,3e25kr,runciblemoon,2,Tue Jul 21 11:16:59 2015 UTC,"I love Cardiacs. Tried posting a song of theirs on r/ProgMetal a couple weeks ago but it didn't get much attention.  They always reminded me of a hybrid of Zappa-esque prog and the aggression found in hardcore punk. Though they never considered themselves either.  I really hope Tim Smith is doing okay. I haven't heard anything about him since news of his stroke years ago, apart from that benefit CD Steven Wilson appeared on.  This is a great track from their early years though. I've seen another video from this session of them playing Jibber and Twitch, are there any others besides these two?"
progrockmusic,3e25kr,IceBlueSilverSky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:58:24 2015 UTC,"Cardiacs might just be the greatest band of all time. They've been so hugely influential on so many wonderful musicians -- looking at their list of famous fans is like a who's who of my favorite music. There's just nothing in the world quite like them.   I try to keep posted on Tim's recovery, and it looks fairly certain that he'll never play another gig. He's in a physical rehab program specifically for musicians, so that's cool, and people close to him have assured fans that his mind is still 100% intact. In his words, though, his ""hands are cunts"" at the moment.   As far as that video series goes, they keep saying they'll release the rest of the sessions, but there's no timetable for it that I've seen. They're still getting the online shop back together, and only recently have they started doing re-releases of Cardiacs on vinyl.  But, I mean, of all the ways it could have happened, the founder of Cardiacs having a heart attack after a My Bloody Valentine show smacks of enough irony that I bet he even giggled about it.  Mike Vennart from Oceansize is a huge devotee (he helped organize the benefit album), and funny enough, this week he managed to publish an article about his ten favorite Cardiacs tunes, and why he loves 'em so much. Check it out here:  https://www.teamrock.com/features/2015-07-18/the-10-best-cardiacs-songs-as-chosen-by-mike-vennart  Meanwhile, Tim's guitarist Kavus Torabi has been absolutely tearing it up with his psychedelic outfit, Knifeworld. Definitely worth a listen."

progrockmusic,3e01c7,runciblemoon,2,Tue Jul 21 10:53:53 2015 UTC,"My unpopular opinion that no one asked for:   I find that songs to be kind of relentless. Theres so much reverb on everything, and those pipe organs are blaring the entire time. There seems to be a guitar solo going on from beginning to end, and theres at least 2 voices singing during all of the lyrics. All the while the drums and bass are going nuts. While any one of these things isn't so bad (especially when it's Yes responsible for it), all of them going on at the same time is a bit too much. You barely ever get a chance to breathe over the course of 6 minutes.  Theres a good song somewhere in there, but it's like everyone cranked it up to 100% for the entire song and I personally find it a bit overwhelming.  Bring on the downvotes :p"

progrockmusic,3dw26j,VigilantAlexius,2,Tue Jul 21 02:44:15 2015 UTC,"Snow is a highly contentious item in the SB canon. It's Neal Morse's swansong, and in the lyrics, you can tell it's a goodbye to prog because he found Jesus.   It's sort of a brilliant and tragic parting shot to the prog genre, and you can hear the Christian rock start to creep in, in between the other tunes. You have stuff like ""Welcome to NYC"" which is just a phenomenal, Genesis-y rocking sort of tune, and then you get to ""Wind at my Back"" and you're like ""...wait...oh god no, please Neal don't leave us"""

progrockmusic,3dq4go,noitsice,8,Sat Jul 18 10:25:38 2015 UTC,I've heard this album too many times; this song is necessary to complete the cycle
progrockmusic,3dq4go,nkLottery,6,Sat Jul 18 15:58:26 2015 UTC,"So I guess a lot of fans will know this already but for those who don't, it's no secret that Tony Banks hated this track and didn't want it to make the final cut of the album. This piece is very much a Steve Hackett composition and the resistance he faced when trying to get this, and other songs he wrote, through to the records were the major factor in him ultimately leaving the band.  For me, I think the track works pretty well on the album. It definitely has a very different style about it but I think it has some really nice intricate guitar work on it that fits in well with the ""Old England"" theme of the album. Plus the contrast between the acoustic and electric sections is a nice change of pace.   Personally, I can't see why Banks dislikes it so much, for me it compares very favourably with a lot of the work they were putting out around that time."
progrockmusic,3dq4go,armorandsword,4,Sat Jul 18 14:31:43 2015 UTC,"Reading between the lines of all the interviews I have heard & read, I think the bottom line is that Tony Banks was an asshat to Hackett. You can tell Banks was a bully in the songwriting department, and Gabriel interviews allude to the fact that the 'democratic' nature of the band was anything but -- the most forceful got their way, ie him and Banks, and in many respects Hackett felt an outsider (he and Collins were the newcomers while the three others were childhood friends). In Hackett's interviews he seems to have always resented not being as much of a presence on Genesis albums as he felt he should have been.  In any case, Banks is wrong! After the Ordeal is a great song."
progrockmusic,3dq4go,progodyssey,5,Sat Jul 18 17:05:43 2015 UTC,"The bootleg, ""Selling England by the Session"", has an early version of this track with a very different energy. It's sped up, in a kind of ""Ace of Wands"" way, with a lead electric guitar instead of acoustic. You can really tell how it's a Hackett piece. Would have been interesting if it ended up that way on the album, but the more relaxed version probably fits the flow much better, especially being after Epping Forest."

progrockmusic,3dq4go,JokerLiquid,3,Sat Jul 18 21:40:12 2015 UTC,"I guess it's kinda after the ordeal -- everything happened in Epping Forest. Anyway I like and always have. Hackett's guitar tone & sound was always half the attraction and it's right there in this song. I mean, shit, 'More Fool Me' is on this album and people are picking on 'After the Ordeal'??!"
progrockmusic,3dq4go,progodyssey,2,Sat Jul 18 21:52:52 2015 UTC,"i like ""More fool me"" atleast a hundred times better than ""After the ordeal"". I don't know it's just a very bland and uninteresting piece of music for me."
progrockmusic,3dq4go,JokerLiquid,2,Sat Jul 18 22:46:08 2015 UTC,"To me it's like an English stream flowing through verdant woods. Love Hackett's guitar. Love the flute. More Fool Me I never disliked but in retrospect it's just the first of a long line of insipid Collins love songs. I will take bland Hackett over in-love Collins any day.  Still it's all part of a whole, take it or leave it. I always experienced After the Ordeal as an interlude between Epping Forest and Cinema Show, an instrumental bit that just washes by."
progrockmusic,3dq4go,progodyssey,2,Sat Jul 18 23:34:34 2015 UTC,"Early Steve Hackett pieces had repetitions that weren't necessary, but if you chopped all the repeats from this you'd have a very short piece. You have two atmospheres divided in A and B sections, and the whole thing is a fairly pleasant divide between songs. I think the reason Tony didn't like it is because his part in it wasn't strong. Then again, perhaps he didn't play because he didn't like it.  Consider that Hackett wanted the solo half of Cinema Show taken out, he didn't play on that bit maybe for the same reason. There may not have been much of an album left had they been too headstrong."

progrockmusic,3dr6g5,IlFactotumDeLaCitta,2,Sun Jul 19 23:55:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'd say it was pretty recent, possibly even a reaction to ""big four"" being tossed around in the thrash and grunge genres.

Even 2112 was a great concept, we never really classified them as Progressive like you would the Big 6. I saw them twice in the 70's, and honestly loved the shows because of their level of heavy rock.   Good time to be teen."

progrockmusic,3dnxjr,manaburner,19,Fri Jul 17 20:28:33 2015 UTC,"I love Steven Wilson.  Love his music, his live shows, the musicians he surrounds himself with, everything.  IMO he's the best thing in the prog world right now.  However, for the fast 6 months or so, I've been forming the impression that he is developing a massive ego.  Like a Kanye-size ego.  This record announcement has just jumped that alert level by about twofold.  Look, he's amazing.  He should be proud of his accomplishments and talent.  I just dread him becoming insufferable.  Please, convince me this is all in my mind."
progrockmusic,3dnxjr,kirkt,12,Fri Jul 17 22:35:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree, he's always had a big ego.  Just listen to some of his past interviews."
progrockmusic,3dnxjr,lol-da-mar-s-cool,6,Sat Jul 18 00:36:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's always been a bit insufferable to me. I still like his music, though."
progrockmusic,3dnxjr,nikolaimedtner,6,Sat Jul 18 01:11:55 2015 UTC,I don't really care about egos or how he comes across in interviews.   I listen to the music and I enjoy it. The end. Can't it be that simple?
progrockmusic,3dnxjr,IcemanATCO,2,Sat Jul 18 06:51:36 2015 UTC,Fucking thank you.
progrockmusic,3dnxjr,DoubleChicken,5,Sat Jul 18 19:02:44 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the honesty. While I agree with you on some degree, I believe he always had a massive ego. I mean, how can he not? Porcupine Tree made the kind of music every musician would dream of making. He produced and played for Opeth. Blackfield was dark and soul crushing. And now it's his name on the ballot, and he's showing the world he's the genius behind all this. Yes, he works with amazing musicians, and yes he's well-spoken etc. But fundamentally (and being a musician) I believe ego is what makes these type of musicians excel at what they do."
progrockmusic,3dnxjr,MVolta,4,Sat Jul 18 02:44:50 2015 UTC,"no, I think you are unfortunately correct.  The good news is he is nowhere near as famous (infamous) among the general public, so few will you get into a big stinky argument with you when you mention you like his music.  Even if Steven becomes as insufferable as Kanye, you won't encounter nearly as many insufferable haters as the latter has"
progrockmusic,3dnxjr,kirkt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:47:54 2015 UTC,I asked you - nicely - to tell me I was wrong.  You have not done that.  I am sadder as a result.  I will still give you the upvote because now it means I'm not delusional.  Can we do an intervention?  Can SW be brought back from the brink?
progrockmusic,3dnxjr,metaldood,2,Fri Jul 17 23:03:57 2015 UTC,"I agree. That is the first thing which came to my mind when he announced on Facebook about this limited vinyl release. I also noticed he puts himself in the spotlight and I see his face plastered everywhere including the HCE album book, his website, his facebook page. There are very few pictures of Guthrie or Marco. I know that the page is 'Steven Wilson' and not the 'Steven Wilson Band'. Does this indicate ego? Maybe. Also the way he gives interviews and also his talk on stage while on the tour put me off.  He is smart and talks intelligently but at the same time he thinks what he listens to is the best music ever created. Oh well the fanboys will buy every record regardless."
progrockmusic,3dnxjr,redekker,4,Fri Jul 17 23:38:08 2015 UTC,"But he's always been like that.  My first PT concert was the In Absentia tour and it's the first time I've seen an artist, within a live rock show, to order the crowd to be quiet."
progrockmusic,3dnxjr,ivanover,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:05:48 2015 UTC,"Could you elaborate? Was the crowd too noisy, or he was just being an asshole?"

progrockmusic,3dnxjr,iamvillainmo,4,Sat Jul 18 14:10:12 2015 UTC,"I agree. When I saw him in Denver for the HCE tour, he hand exuded a sense of self-grandeur that was almost repulsive, when you consider the emotions his music usually emits.  Love him but still, that was gross to me."
progrockmusic,3dnxjr,radioactiveToys,2,Fri Jul 17 23:12:37 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that his interactions with the crowd have improved quite a bit in the last ~10 years. He seems to enjoy communicating between songs a little more.  Maybe his cumulative success is getting to his head, but he hasn't really let me down yet."

Before one of the songs, he did ask we be quiet a bit and not yell freebird and shit,  but his paraphrase was ""let us have our snooty musician moment,  please.""  I dunno. I'm sure he's faintly egotistical, but on stage and the time i got his autograph afterwards, he was pretty nice and humble."

Hear that little jingle at the beginning that gets repeated throughout the entire song (da-da-daaa-da) ? Well, this has been the jingle used in every announcement of France's national railroad company, the SNCF, for a few years now. It has become almost synonymous with the company, and almost every French citizen recognizes it immediately.  Supposedly, Gilmour heard the jingle in a train station in France two years ago and fell in love with it, immediately asking for the rights to use it in his upcoming album. French journalists have been nagging us about it for the past two weeks now. I know it sounds like a crazy story, and I do not know if it has been covered in the English-speaking world, but here in France, it's become something of a badge of honor among Pink Floyd fans."

progrockmusic,3ddxc1,O_Matty,3,Wed Jul 15 19:49:38 2015 UTC,"I love Snow, but I've always felt that it tells an interesting story for a disc and a half, then abandons the concept and degenerates into religious nonsense at the end. ""Love will be your ministry"" and all that. The lyrics take a sharp downhill turn at that point (""and my soul has been kissed just because you exist"", anyone?). I think it could be seen as representing Neal's final transition into being completely consumed by Jesus. I haven't really been able to stomach anything he's done since."
progrockmusic,3ddxc1,andyman1125,2,Thu Jul 16 01:15:01 2015 UTC,"He had been a Christian for some time at that point (although clearly things had changed since ""The Water""!), but felt during the making of Snow that God was calling him to make music specifically about his faith, something he couldn't demand of his non-Christian band mates.  He asked whether he needed to go immediately or if he should finish the album, and what would happen to the band.  God's reply was that he should finish the album and then leave, and that the band would continue when he was gone.  (This is all taken from my memory of ""The Making of Snow"".)  About the religious aspect, it's quite allegorical to Neal's personal journey, being a musician who felt that the world wasn't satisfying him, and finding that completion in a higher power.  Like with most of his non-solo work, it sticks with the idea of spirituality, rather than out-and-out Jesus/God/the Bible/Christianity.  As has been noted by other people posting, it helps to make the albums accessible to a larger audience, regardless of their beliefs."

Someone brought up Test For Echo being on there, and that is definitely puzzling.  I definitely think Dream Theater being number one on the list is just ridiculous, but I'll also admit that I'm really only a fan of a couple of DT albums, the rest of their stuff is really underwhelming and boring to me.  Also, this may be my obvious bias showing, but Coheed & Cambria's Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV: Volume 1 | From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness not being on the list is absolutely nuts to me."

I like the love for Transatlantic, which makes sense because they're totally prog-for-the-sake-of-prog. I can't believe The Raven That Refused To Sing was #2 though...it's a decent album, but there is way better prog out there.  Most glaring omissions: all Ayreon, The Flower Kings ""Stardust We Are"" (they have plenty of albums better than ""Desolation Rose""), Frost* ""Milliontown"", The Mars Volta ""Frances the Mute"" (top 10), Seven Impale ""City of the Sun"", The Tea Club ""Quickly Quickly Quickly"", all BTBAM post-""Colors"", Blind Guardian ""A Night at the Opera"", and all maudlin of the Well/Kayo Dot (""Choirs of the Eye"" should be #1)."

Doomsday afternoon from phideaux is phenomenal, and rivals some of these albums as well.   I mean, thank you scientist's album was incredible and I love it.

They showcase (to me anyway) the evolution (one may even call it progression!) of prog rock music.   Here is The Knife, showing the very early stages of prog rock.   This is the Cinema Show, a classic era prog song.      And here is One for the Vine, showcasing a more refined progressive sound.   And with Turn it on Again, we have prog pop.     Keep It Dark is a great example of how New Wave affected prog, giving it a more 'artsy' feel.     And finally, with Fading Lights, we hear 90s prog.   It was hard to label the distinctions between each 'era' of prog/genesis, but hopefully you can hear what I mean."

progrockmusic,3cu8mk,JokerLiquid,18,Fri Jul 10 20:40:27 2015 UTC,"you more or less list the greatest hits of my own feelings about Genesis. They had a strong run of inventive arrangement, intriguing subject matter, stellar performances and stage shows with Gabriel. Plus a superb MC with a genuinely poetic point of view. But the thing that I most like about them is the band's vibe with each other. Deft interplay. Obviously gobs of musical sympathy. Power AND subtlety seemed at the fingertips during that 1970-1976 run.  A lot of the same can be said for Yes, but what it boils down to me is they were most together as a band for that time before Bruford left for King Crimson. The heartbeat of the band was removed. Alan White is a fine drummer, but I just didn't like them as much after that. Granted, Genesis lost Peter- I guess you can think of that as a brain transplant as opposed to a heart transplant (though neither analogy is fair to the remaining members, and I'm exaggerating for sure)- but with Genesis the core band was still intact for a while and continued to make good prog before they went truly pop.   Also I find myself reacting more to Peter's words than Jon's. though I like both as lyricists quite a bit, I feel like Peter's world view is more universal- humor and whimsy play more of a role, for instance. but maybe Jon's is just more subtle and I need to go research that more.  But the power and subtlety comment from before- King Crimson embraced that fully. imho they could rock harder than Yes or Genesis, in a way that was truly interesting. I think King Crimson integrated jazz improv in a way few bands can- so many bands, when they add jazz,  just get jazzy. King Crimson actually incorporated it into their DNA. (although Steve Howe has obviously done the same with his playing style). It's pretty impressive to hear power chords and jazz improv in the same piece and it makes sense.  Of the principle guitarists, Fripp is my favorite, in fact was pretty excited when I realized he was guesting on so many Peter Gabriel solo tracks, way back when I was first getting into both Genesis and King Crimson.  I also find King Crimson's various incarnations uniformly interesting, and creatively there are in a place now that is practically off the map, more in Van Der Graff territory in terms of raw power and inventiveness.  Though I go through moods when only one band will do, I'm going to have to go with King Crimson."
progrockmusic,3cu8mk,YourHostandNarrator,5,Fri Jul 10 21:13:05 2015 UTC,"You nailed the time frame for Genesis. After Steve Hackett left, I like some of the work they did with the three, but it wasn't as profound as that incredible run.   Besides, Peter and Steve have gone on to wonderful careers after Genesis. I love watching live Gabriel, it's mother fucking show time with that guy!  Over the course of their lifetime, I'm definitely siding with the Crimson King for effort in trying all the new things and really delivering!"
progrockmusic,3cu8mk,MCPtz,12,Fri Jul 10 23:10:23 2015 UTC,"King Crimson has the most defining album of progressive rock imo.. but the rest of their work, well it falls flat for me. I feel like Genesis is more consistent, as every album from Trespass to Genesis I really liked. Yes on the other hand has  a much more mainstream appeal, still a great progressive band but I am not sure if they are prog enough for me. Out of those three I will have to say Genesis..  However! My favorite from the era, who are often overlooked, has to go to Gentle Giant."
progrockmusic,3cu8mk,goodyman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:17:06 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you there on Crimson, I just can't get into their stuff past that first great album. Yeah, it was so important to the genre and the industry, but Yes and Genesis both just had so much more material that I enjoyed more than Crimson. I pick Yes over Genesis personally, but its a really tough call."
progrockmusic,3cu8mk,Gadgetman914,6,Mon Jul 13 00:47:55 2015 UTC,"King Crimson, but man that's a tough call.   Obviously you can't really put Close to the Edge against Selling England and expect a clear answer, so I recon the ""best"" would be the group that has put out the most diverse range of exceptional albums.  Everything Yes and Genesis managed to accomplish musically and in ""feel"", King Crimson did at some point. They covered more ground than literally any group that I can think of, all while covering a huge range of musical styles. Lizard is as different from Red as Larks' Tongues is from Discipline, but all of their albums are emotive and technically proficient as the last.   I just feel that if I were to listen to just one band, they'd give me by far the greatest enjoyment... You get jazz fusion, new wave, symphonic rock, early metal, atmospheric and soundscapes, math rock, folk.....  Yes would be my second pick, considering the diversity in Relayer, Drama, and Close to the Edge. Unfortunately they had an era of particularly weak albums in the 1980s onwards, where the KC Discipline-Beat-TOAPP trilogy was strong in my books.   Genesis made small improvements and changes over their career, but if the Genesis 'sound' isn't your thing, there's many other groups that would be a better pick. If we were talking straight lyrics and emotion, though, Genesis would be on top."
progrockmusic,3cu8mk,TerrainTerrainPullUp,6,Fri Jul 10 21:14:01 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree that Crimson wins the 80's. I do enjoy ""Duke"" and ""Abacab"" for what they are, but it pales in comparison to the creativity of 80's crimson. Let's not talk about 80's Yes.  I disagree that they accomplished everything Yes and Genesis did in ""feel"" though.   There's no big climax like the ending of ""CTTE"" or ""Supper's Ready"" in Crimson or the folk/country feel of ""And you and I"" or that ""12-strings interlude"" in ""The Cinema Show"".  I do agree that they covered more musical ground though, probably due to the multiple line-ups they've had over the years."
progrockmusic,3cu8mk,TerrainTerrainPullUp,5,Fri Jul 10 21:32:07 2015 UTC,"Great points!   I suppose KC's epics aren't quite as popular, but I'd personally rank the title track from Lizard and Starless just as high on the ""big climax"" scale."
progrockmusic,3cu8mk,imaginedmind,4,Fri Jul 10 21:48:25 2015 UTC,"Starless is beyond amazing. I agree.   Lizard is a hard one for me, i feel like it lacks a proper ending."
progrockmusic,3cu8mk,MCPtz,6,Fri Jul 10 23:16:41 2015 UTC,"If we look at just that short snippet of time when prog peaked around 1971-1975 I think Yes would probably win, in terms of how many consistently mind blowing albums they put out during that time period, and even until 1977.  Genesis petered out (lol) after 1974 and while they were still good it was nowhere near as good as the material they had on Nursery through Lamb.  Though during that time I would say Supper's Ready is my favorite prog song, period, as that was truly a masterpiece that even outshined close to the edge in my opinion.  Looking at their entire careers though, it's King Crimson.  No contest.  I mean yeah Yes and Genesis kept going past the 70s to a certain extent, but King Crimson never stopped innovating, and never stopped reinventing itself with the changing musical styles that were popular at the time.  They began with the type of psychedelic and cathartic music that was popular at the time (similar category that the Moody Blues was in), then shifted to jazz fusion, then to heavy experimental music, then to a blend of new wave and prog, then to much heavier VDGG style rock after that.  While in terms of individual albums they may not have outshined Close to the Edge and Foxtrot, they've been the most consistently good band across their entire career.  Every decade they are pretty much a new band."
progrockmusic,3cu8mk,imaginedmind,7,Fri Jul 10 22:29:47 2015 UTC,"When i look at Genesis vs Yes i tend to take this approach:  Nursery vs Yes Album = Yes Album (Musical box is amazing though)  Foxtrot vs Fragile = Foxtrot no contest  Close to the Edge vs Selling England = Close to the Edge wins by just a little bit, it's the perfect prog album.  Lamb vs Tales = Lamb convincingly (half of tales isn't that strong IMO)  Trick vs Relayer = Relayer (because Gates of delirium)  Wind vs GFTO =GFTO (because Awaken)  ATTWT vs Tormato = both suck IMO lol  Duke vs Drama =  I like Duke better, but that's me.

I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility.

Beyond that, they've maintained a stable lineup for 40+ years (take that, well, all three bands in OP, since apparently having a revolving door of musicians=prestige) while still evolving musically, and put out eight, yes EIGHT, consecutive top tier albums (2112, A Farewell to Kings, Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, Signals, Grace Under Pressure, and Power Windows all came out consecutively over 9 years, 1976-1985). Of those eight, six are pretty much universally held up as masterpieces (all but Signals and Grace Under Pressure) of progressive rock.   And everything they've released since Vapor Trails has been fucking awesome. They've had 2 duds (Hold Your Fire and Presto) and only Hold YOur Fire is a truly mediocre album. Are you fucking kidding me, 20 studio albums and 18 are fucking awesome?   2112 is probably the best prog album of the 70s, to boot.   In terms of consistency, creativity, and staying power, Rush are the best progressive rock band to ever grace any of your unworthy ears, and British prog rockers can suck their awesome Canuck cocks."
progrockmusic,3cu8mk,186394,4,Sat Jul 11 00:32:40 2015 UTC,"I strongly agree. Rush are the only ones who aged with grace, who kept making good music, whose lyrics are clever as well as evocative, their music complex, but they can still rock out, and they are 3 of the best practicioners of their respective instruments on the planet. Rush beats them all."
progrockmusic,3cu8mk,Oil-of-Vitriol,3,Sat Jul 11 04:17:17 2015 UTC,"Their music isn't really complex though, difficult to play, but harmonically simple (most of the times).  Like i said, it sounds more like long ""Hard Rock"" pieces than prog."
progrockmusic,3cu8mk,CunningStunts,2,Sat Jul 11 15:12:46 2015 UTC,I think La Villa Strangiato and YYZ would like a quick word with you :)
progrockmusic,3cu8mk,Bechimo,5,Sun Jul 12 22:25:51 2015 UTC,"I strongly disagree, i always thought Rush sounded more like a ""Hard Rock"" band than progressive.   They're much more reminiscent of ""Led Zeppelin"" than any progressive band i know. I don't think they're as good as Zeppelin either."
progrockmusic,3cu8mk,Math2S,3,Sat Jul 11 01:33:21 2015 UTC,"I'd agree that they aren't as good as Zeppelin, but I don't know that there is any rock band in the same league as they are besides the Beatles (in terms of acclaim, consistent quality, and influence on subsequent bands). And Rush are definitely a different creature than British prog- they never ventured very far into the ""art rock"" schtick, and British bands definitely don't have as much crossover appeal with hard rock and metal fans (Opeth fans' hard on for Comus aside). It's also important to note that Rush formed after Zeppelin's rise to fame, and their first album didn't drop until 1974 (that album isn't really prog, tbf) at which point there wasn't a rock band on the planet that wasn't borrowing some element of Led Zeppelin's sound.  Rush are very good at obfuscating how complex their music is, a quality which I think contributes to their mainstream crossover. Most of their songs, including their radio hits, change meters frequently (for example, Freewill moves between 7/4, 6/4, 4/4, and 8/4). They did largely abandon unconventional song structures during the 80s, but in ""Beyond the Lighted Stage"" (a documentary about Rush that I recommend to any music fan regardless of their feelings about the band) Geddy Lee explains that, at the time, a prog band abandoning suite-style full side tracks for verse-chorus songs seemed to be a more radical change than continuing to produce albums that fit the formula prog fans expected (and demanded).  Harmonically speaking, Lifeson certainly uses unconventional chord voicings and does venture into modal scales during some solos. They're not as ""challenging"" as King Crimson, but they're not hewing to rock's traditions by any stretch of the imagination.  Beyond that, all three members of the band are world-class musicians. Neil Peart is always mentioned when the subject of ""greatest drummers"" is brought up, as is Geddy Lee when the discussion turns to rock bassists. Alex Lifeson may not be on par with someone like Adrian Belew, but he's criminally underrated by rock fans and prog fans because his playing style never really went fully ""prog,"" something that I think let Rush stay grounded in making good music regardless of perceived genre rather than being consumed by the masturbatory bullshit that plagued so many other progressive bands in the late 70s and early 80s."
progrockmusic,3cu8mk,Math2S,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:06:41 2015 UTC,"I came in here looking for someone to say Rush, and I wasn't disappointed. They're one of the only classic prog bands to never have their legacy messed up, and they somehow managed to stay completely relevant, with people actually anticipating and greatly enjoying their new music (name another classic rock band that's put out a truly fantastic record in the 21st century, let alone three.) Especially considering that their latest, Clockwork Angels, so good that it's actually considered by most fans to be up to par with their 70s/early 80s output, and it's actually surpassed things like 2112 and Moving Pictures for some fans, including myself. They also haven't changed their line up in 40 years and they're still selling out arenas."

progrockmusic,3cu8mk,MpVpRb,2,Fri Jul 10 21:11:27 2015 UTC,"King Crimson by a wide margin in (almost) every possible metric. These comparison only look at studio releases by the official respective bands.  Volume: King Crimson | Genesis | Yes ---|--|---  13 albums | 15 albums | 19 albums  Volume quality (rough estimates):    King Crimson Genesis Yes    8 hours of good music 6 hours of good music 3 hours of good music    Innovation: King Crimson by a wide margin. They were far more unique than the symphonic wave of the 70s and they also started first. In the Court of the Crimson King came out in 1969 and was groundbreaking. Trespass was 1970 and The Yes Album was 1971. Yes has even explicitly said King Crimson were a huge influence.  Keeping it fresh: Almost every King Crimson album is unique from every other King Crimson album while still being identifiable as prog. Genesis and Yes albums get fairly samey if you listen to too many in a short amount of time.   Time from first album to last album:    King Crimson Genesis Yes    34 years 28 years 45 years    Although admittedly KC had two hiatuses adding up to 13 years and Yes had a 10 year hiatus.  Best of the best (albums): Lizard >> The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway > Close to the Edge  King Crimson has like 5 albums without a mediocre track on them while I can't say the same for either Yes or Genesis.  Best of the best (songs):  ""Supper's Ready"" > ""Close to the Edge"" > ""Larks' Tongues in Aspic part 1""  Then there's how long these bands have kept me interested to at least some degree. I was introduced to all three within the same year when I first discovered prog (2005ish). I instantly fell in love with all of them. Yes dropped off after a couple years and only ever occasionally listen to ""Close to the Edge"" or ""Relayer"" or something. After the first few years I'd say I listen to Genesis in waves. King Crimson has been a staple though and I doubt there's been a month in the past 10 years when I haven't listened to at least one album of theirs."
progrockmusic,3cu8mk,DoodleKaboodle,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:45:25 2015 UTC,"For me it's more like:  best album: 1- Close to the edge                   2- Foxtrot                   3- Larks' tongues in aspics  Best Song: 1- Supper's Ready                  2- Close to the Edge                  3- Starless  Best Band: 1- Genesis                  2- Yes                  3- KC  But it's all very close. I listen to all 3 regularly, but i listen to KC the least.  P.S.: KC was the most varied because they've had more different line-ups."
progrockmusic,3cu8mk,TheMisterRedMan,2,Sat Jul 11 00:05:05 2015 UTC,"I could make a case for all 3. Crimson perhaps the most technically progressive of the lot, some later stuff just hasn't been as compelling to me, prog-jazz less prog-rock. Genesis with Gabriel was just phenomenal with the showmanship really adding another layer, but the fall to popdom taints them enough IMHO. So my vote goes to YES, putting out a consistent vision of prog-rock for decades and with Squired recent passing leading to all the ""holy shit was he amazing"" posts they're getting the benefit of the doubt."
progrockmusic,3cu8mk,comickat,2,Sat Jul 11 00:37:19 2015 UTC,"If I were to rank them, I'd say there's a tie between Genesis and King Crimson. I can't decide between them. Supper's Ready is just an amazing song. Foxtrot - Lamb are extremely high quality albums, and I do admit I like some of Phil Collin's 80's stuff (Duke and Abacab). The Larks-Red period for KC is just as good if not better than Genesis in my opinion, climaxing with Starless as their apex song. Their 80's stuff is great too. KC can powerfully pound out instrumentals superbly, but Genesis has incredible vocal sections and an overall stage presence unmatched. I can't decide.  Yes was the first prog band I really started listening to, I started with Genesis and King Crimson a lot later. Tales from Topographic Oceans is quite honestly the greatest piece of music I've ever listened to. It's so much more powerful than anything else I've ever listened to. It wasn't something I got right away, but once it clicked it's completely unparalleled (heh). If Tales was their only album I'd still give it to them, but they also had Close to the Edge, Going for the One, and touting the impressive Gates: Relayer. Yes hands down wins for me, but Genesis and KC are also very very high up there for me"
progrockmusic,3cu8mk,fraghawk,2,Sat Jul 11 01:14:02 2015 UTC,"My opinion of ""Tales"" differs greatly from yours. I think half is good (The Revealing and Ritual) and half isn't that good (The Remembering and The Ancient). With the ""good part"" not being on par with Close to the Edge for me (or Foxtrot or Selling England or Lamb lies down), i feel like it really is a mixed bag."

progrockmusic,3cpnpm,musicman90125,7,Thu Jul 9 19:45:17 2015 UTC,"Yes superfan here, so read through the filter of my bias...  I think people who dismiss it as ""crap"" are judging it in the context of two things--1.) all of Yes's other 1970s output and 2.) all Yes albums with the Squire-Anderson-Howe-Wakeman-White lineup.  Through that lens, I would view Tormato as certainly a weaker album in terms of songwriting, but not a bad one by any means.  For me there's a bit of a cheese factor on Don't Kill the Whale, Arriving UFO, Circus of Heaven.  It's got its strengths though.  Future Times/Rejoice is a solid opener and has a traditional Yes sound.  Madrigal is a pretty, stately Yes instrumental.  Onward is a poignant track, a soothing song, and a beautiful showcase piece for Anderson (and IMO for Benoit David during his run).  I find that Release Release plays with some of the more aggressive / energetic 'rock' ideas that would be better employed on Drama.  The real highlight on Tormato, and the one which holds its legacy in the books is On the Silent Wings of Freedom.  It's a well written, energetic song with a driving rhythm and some legendary bass tone.  Check out that track, Chris's playing is great.  When I heard of Chris's passing, Heart of the Sunrise and this song both started playing in my head.  His tone is undeniably 'Squire' but it's got this flanged/chorus aspect to it that I haven't heard recreated anywhere else; nor by Squire on other records.  It's almost...liquidy...in the most positive and unique way.  This song should be celebrated in memoriam of Chris--for his role on this song alone, Tormato was always a hidden gem to me.  Howe's got some of that same effect on his guitar and his noodling intertwined with the basslines make for an awesome instrumental.  Tormato's got a lot of energy to it, but an underlying cheese factor...take it or leave it it's undeniably Yes and is certainly not crap.  I think it showed Yes simultaneously trying to hone their 70s sound, try to make more concise tracks, and 'rock' harder--a trajectory they would follow and improve upon on Drama."
progrockmusic,3cpnpm,nkLottery,5,Thu Jul 9 20:44:59 2015 UTC,Wow thanks man! I wasn't expecting a fully detailed description like this. I feel we share a lot of the same views about that album. I do agree that it is sorta weak in songwriting terms as a whole but there are a lot of Yes elitist who bash it to pieces for no good reason. Onward is probably my favorite track from it. Mostly because it's a beautiful piece but also because Chris wrote it.  I've been a fan of Squire since I started listening to Yes 5 years ago. Fish Out of Water will forever be in my top 10 favorite albums of all time. So sad we won't be able to experience a Yes with Chris anymore. On a happier note thanks for sharing your opinion with me. Our views align each other very well. Thanks again!
progrockmusic,3cpnpm,mightykingfish,2,Thu Jul 9 21:08:49 2015 UTC,"Check out the Keys to Ascension version of Onward, much warmer sound."
progrockmusic,3cpnpm,sir_percy_percy,2,Thu Jul 9 23:11:39 2015 UTC,"I have always loved the album, I never really understood any bashing of it. The only song I really have an issue with is 'Circus of heaven', but even that's alright. I must be in the minority that love 'Arriving UFO', jeez, Chris (RIP) is amazing on that song. I DO agree though that 'On the silent wings of freedom' is the best song on the album and I think in general, it is an over looked song in their catalog. That song live REALLY caught fire. One of Chris's best moments. Yeah, the songs are shorter, but it doesn't matter, they are good! The remaster also has some excellent unfinished songs from the aborted Paris sessions in '79, from which I love 'Picasso', 'Some are born' and 'Richard'. All good stuff.."
progrockmusic,3cpnpm,mightykingfish,3,Fri Jul 10 05:30:09 2015 UTC,"When I listen to it, I tend to hear Squire and White trying to change with the times, and Anderson and Wakeman not, with Howe floating in the middle.  A perfect example of this is just before the vocals start on Release Release: the rhythm section sounds like The Police, then Wakeman plays a pointless scale with a terrible synth sound.  We get the high energy balls out intro to Silent Wings, but also Madrigal, with tinkling harpsichord behind meaningless lyrics which at that point had become quite stale.    They would pretty much carry on these paths afterward.  Jon would do new age with Vangelis, Rick's keyboard wizardry was anachronistic in the 80s.  Squire, White, and Howe made the new wave inspired Drama album (one of my faves), and further update their sounds to huge success with Asia and Rabin's Yes (the merits of which are a different debate folks).  Whether or not these factions were actual, that's my take.  A group fighting between going all Abacab or settling for Love Beach."

The only real complaint I have about the album is the mixing, the whole thing sounds a bit over-compressed to me, but that's nowhere near a deal breaker. That album proves to me that even Yes at what some consider their ""worst"" is still so far ahead of anything else I've heard."

progrockmusic,3cpnpm,Yoshiman400,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:17:45 2015 UTC,"I ignored this album for a while, probably because I just simply enjoyed the scale and structure of Relayer, Close to the Edge, Fragile, etc. Then when I got Drama last year, I was reminded in the liner notes and other sources about how Anderson and Wakeman left due to creative differences with the others and that Tormato was often derided for Wakeman's unusual synthesizer sounds compared to his other stuff.  So I finally tried listening to it again a couple of months ago. And yeah, it's actually quite palatable in the same way I enjoy Audio-Visions by Kansas. Yes, the songs are shorter, the lyrics are a bit cheesy in places (even for Yes' standards) and the synths can be a bit over the top, but the band still had a lot of energy and the instrumental parts are great (especially the end of Don't Kill the Whale and of course the intro to Silent Wings). And yes, I still don't like it as much as I love Drama, but I certainly don't hate it either. But I can see why Squire, White and Howe were going a bit mad from Anderson and Wakeman. Not every band can make every album perfect."

A dull sounding record and a lackluster performance. It was also a big disappointment at the time for me because instead of making their own dedicated live album they simply re-purposed an already existing King Biscuit performance which had been broadcast nationwide and I already had on tape. There didn't even seem to be any attempt at a remix, either: to my ears there was no discernible difference between my stereo tape recorded off the air and this album--it's like they just copied the two-track master as it stood, pressed it and sold it. Ooof. It was like buying a bootleg! (I think there were some tracks that had not been broadcast but that didn't really balance out the vast majority which had.)

progrockmusic,3c9kol,cauger96,62,Mon Jul 6 04:04:01 2015 UTC,"Ok.  First, weird is different, pretty much by definition.  Part of what makes most pop so boring to us prog fans is that its just so simple, the entirety of the song could be summarized by less than a minute of melody, which is usually picked from a set of commonly used melodies that all pop song use, usually in C major, 4/4 time.  There's nothing wrong with this particular type of melody, but its ridiculously overused, and to us its like hearing the same song over and over and over and over, even if its sometimes with slightly different lyrics.  I hear Katy Perry's Firework and I can't help but think I've already heard this song a bazillion times on the radio since the 1980s.  Honestly off the top of my head, I can already name one song that sounds exactly like that, Pat Benatar's Shadows of the Night.  There's probably thousands of other songs that use the same 4 chords.  My point here is that prog is like a breath of fucking fresh air and our brains are like GOD YES SOMETHING DIFFERENT WHAT IS THIS I WANT MORE OH ITS JUST SO FUCKED UP I LOVE IT.    Secondly, weird is unpredictable.  Predictable music gets stuck in your head and gets old.  Prog doesn't.  Usually.  Even though I've listened to Siberian Khatru more times than I can count (ok, rough estimate, mid to high hundreds), I still fucking can't keep up with them when they get to the part with the chant since they are breaking off into multiple time signatures being played simultaneously between the throbbing synth (or bass?), melodic electric guitar, and their almost freeform sounding shouts DAH  DAH  DOH DAH DOH DAH  And you try and join in with them but because the different time signatures are throwing you off you never quiteDAH  DAH  DOH DAH DOH DAH DOH DAH  Man you don't even have a chance to recovDEHDEHDEH  DEH  DAH  DEH DAH DOH DEH DAH DOH DEH DAH DOH  Sometimes I can get it but not near enough that it ever gets old, and most of the time rather than try and follow along I just absorb that shit until foam starts to drool of my mouth.    That brings me to thirdly, weird is psychedelic.  Prog is a drug.  There's plenty of prog out there that isn't psychedelic and is still weird for the above reasons, but it works like a psychedelic.  Prog evolved from psychedelic rock which was designed to elicit the sensations you get from taking drugs.  And it does this by being weird and generating strange sounds that don't meld with our normal idea of music.  Strange melodies in strange keys that change, notes that sometimes stretch out way longer than any note should be stretched, sometimes ending up a different note than it started, all the while other notes are going through other strange transformations, all criss-crossing each other often in different directions.  It's wild, man.  And we allow ourselves to absorb and be absorbed into that music and literally get high without drugs, though some drugs can enhance the experience, obviously.  Like it's science, man.  There's got to be research done on that.  So yeah, basically what I'm saying is you're crazy, but it's better this way, trust me."
progrockmusic,3c9kol,imaginedmind,8,Mon Jul 6 05:21:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for delivering a thorough response and explanation! And I completely agree with Siberian Khatru. That shit's hard to get right while singing along

progrockmusic,3c9kol,jcwitte,2,Tue Jul 7 14:07:21 2015 UTC,"That was a fun read! Perfectly summarizing and expanding on why I love prog too.  Another thing that gets my goat about pop music is just how little musicianship is involved. It's usually just one singer, whose voice is usually manipulated by computer software, singing against a backing that is completely synthesized. Granted, there are some very talented music producers that know their way around a MIDI and a soundboard, but they hardly get any credit.  Prog, and my other favorite genre, jazz fusion (which are often blended), is a vibrant display of incredibly talented musicians who are also gifted at multiple instruments."
progrockmusic,3c9kol,m2084,10,Tue Jul 7 18:09:36 2015 UTC,"Commercial music has no challenge. In 30 seconds you can figure out a song and judge if it will be a top 40. And the songs are so much alike that you don't really have to pay attention (passive listening) on them as you already mentally approved something similar in the past. The general public is so dumb that they don't get the real meaning of the lyrics (take Born In USA as example) when there's one.  Prog (along others), is varied and unpredictable. As it demands active listening and repetitive hearings to catch all the intricate information, it's challenging and rewarding to 'get' the same song and discover new things each new listening.  But the same Pop pattern can happen in prog as in this sub people have the whole Yes and Genesis discography wired into their brains and are lazy to acknowledge great bands like Can and Magma."

progrockmusic,3c9kol,TripJammer,2,Mon Jul 6 13:20:32 2015 UTC,"Funny thing about the passive and active listening—When I get new music I listen to it passively for a few spins.

I suppose I am doing the prog archeology routine but with neo-prog, having discovered bands like Porcupine Tree and all the amazing new prog bands only within the last few years. I enjoy reading about and following their various spinoffs and family trees. Especially when neo & old school cross paths (eg Big Big Train, and did you know that Steven Wilson's bassist is also Steve Hackett's bassist?). I love shit like that.  If it's a band I've never heard of I want to hear it, am less interested in the old stuff. However I am always willing and ready to be surprised by progrockmusic and a vintage band like, say, England."
progrockmusic,3c9kol,djon_djon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:06:36 2015 UTC,Not to mention that if they're a current band... There's a chance you could see them live.
progrockmusic,3c9kol,3teers,7,Thu Jul 16 16:44:45 2015 UTC,"I take ""weird"" to simply describe something that has little to no regard for social norms and trends. Personally, I find many social trends to be trivial and constraining, especially when it comes to music.  The strength of the prog movement in general is that it escapes from the social constraints of art; it presents music as an abstract landscape of sound. It's about making the landscape colorful and intricate, and occasionally downright bizzare upon first listen. That's not to say that you cannot enjoy it with friends, its just that two individuals must develop an appreciation of the art on their own before enjoying it together (usually).  You must understand this before you show your friends this kind of music. Unless they are very open minded, or very musically inclined, it is going to fly over their heads. Playing Magma is probably one of the worst things you could do in this context, unless of course you're trying to mess with their heads ;)"
progrockmusic,3c9kol,financewiz,3,Mon Jul 6 07:03:54 2015 UTC,"I think it's very interesting for musicians that the attempt to deliberately make ""weird"" music gets more and more difficult as the years go by. I'd say your friends are pretty damn strange for being disturbed by an occult folk album that's probably older than they are. Tch, kids these days.  When I first got into avant-garde, experimental and prog rock music back in the late 70s, I got hit with the ""weird"" epithet pretty frequently. But period weirdbeards like, say, The Residents now sound positively quaint. There are platinum-selling Hip Hop albums nowadays that are several orders of freaky beyond an old Residents album. We got pop music now that has no tonal center and is played entirely on devices that people from the 70s would not recognize as instruments. We have entire genres of music that are all about repetition and texture instead of melody and harmony.  Despite all that, Magma still seems pretty weird, bless them. Make your stodgy, old-before-their-time friends go see 'em live."
progrockmusic,3c9kol,tiensss,3,Mon Jul 6 19:24:08 2015 UTC,Magma and Comus are two of my favourite bands. They are very different from your convetional prog rock in my opinion. Much more innovative and unique.
progrockmusic,3c9kol,Slivlan,2,Mon Jul 6 21:37:10 2015 UTC,"Hm, this is not going to make you feel better exactly, but I'll still say it.  I am not a hardcore prog fan. I've listened to the best of prog, and a rather large part of it I like. But to be honest, the completely weird stuff is not what I like. People are saying, that they like the weird stuff, because you just can't keep track of it, but I for one do not enjoy that. Sure, I hate most pop music, and yes, it is ridiculously repetitive and boring, but nonetheless I do not want to listen to complete strangeness because of that. I love some of the more melodic, easier prog. I love early King Crimson, Caravan, Camel, some not to poppy Pink Floyd for example. Now, honestly, I haven't really been into prog for a long time, I didn't know it existed. I liked just the kind of music that the beforementioned are, but never knew there exist a name for it, I just thought its good music. And I love the more proggier songs of other rock groups like Led Zep and Beatles and Muse etc.  What I'm meaning to say is, prog isn't just about complexity, it's about making that complexity pleasing to the ears. I highly dislike some ridiculously unpleasant non-melodic sounds, which I wouldn't neccesarily call music, but I get through them to listen to the good, pleasing sounds.  And I'm kind of sorry to say that, but yes, I find it strange, that certain people enjoy listening to some really weird prog (I don't mind the lyrics though, just the sounds), similarily to how i find it strange to people enjoying techno or meaningless rap or something similar. But, unlike the others, the ""weird"" prog still sounds like something, that I, too, with further experience might enjoy. Once.  Also, if anyone actually read what I wrote, and feels like he/she understands what I'm saying, feel free to give me some directions about which groups could be the right ones for me."
progrockmusic,3c9kol,Slivlan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:39:42 2015 UTC,"I completely understand where you're coming from. I've been into prog for a couple years now, and in the beginning I was definitely not a fan of the weirder stuff. That's changed simply because I like hearing more and more different lyrics/sounds (although death metal growling and screeching still is a complete turn-off). As for recommendations, I would highly recommend Steven Wilson's ""Raven that Refused to Sing,"" and some 80's Rush could probably be right up your alley!"
progrockmusic,3c9kol,richtestani,2,Tue Jul 7 03:59:52 2015 UTC,"I've listened to some Rush stuff (2112) and altough it is good, it just didn't really drag me in, but I'll give them another go, as for Steven Wilson... He's the guy from Porcupine Tree, right? I've listened to them as well, liking some of their songs, thoroughly disliking most others. Is his solo work different enough?  Thanks though :)"
progrockmusic,3c9kol,jupiterkansas,2,Tue Jul 7 12:16:13 2015 UTC,"To add to this discussion.  Much like Jazz music before it, progressive rock challenges you to listen to the music. Unlike pop music, it requires no thought. Songs are designed to be so infectious that you like it instantly. More and more music is becoming like this where there is no challenge to think but to just instantly like which is probably one reason there are no albums but just singles.  Progressive style music allows a person to enter their world, go on a musical journey and escape in it. The sounds produced can be so elaborate that it gets better overtime as you hear it. Add in Peter Sinfield and you add a new level of imagination.  I love that. When I was younger, the best thing was to put on one of these triply albums and drift away."
progrockmusic,3c9kol,jason_stanfield,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:20:19 2015 UTC,"When you look at the whole history of music, the late 20th century is probably one of the greatest eras of creativity and experimentation, and it really exploded in the 1960s and 1970s.  This is due to several factors but mainly it's because of sound recording technology and newly invented electric instruments. What you and your friends might call weird is simply part of this outburst in experimenting with new sounds and a new means of expression.   What we call ""prog rock"" is generally music that attempts to raise this new electronic music to the same artistic level of acoustic music of the past - the well-entrenched classical and romantic era of composers and orchestras and the well-established world of jazz.   Of course, such ambitions are often filled with pretention and embarassing failures but there's no denying that the great experimentation in electronic sound has produced some amazing results. Some might call it weird, but that's only if they narrowly define what music is. I see it as the greatest flourishing creativity in the history of music - or at least since the printing press standardized musical notation.   tl;dr: Rock music is all about being weird, because that's where you'll find something new."
progrockmusic,3c9kol,Oil-of-Vitriol,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:25:24 2015 UTC,"""I was somewhat shocked to see how genuinely concerned they were about my mental state for enjoying this music.""   Music is literally the only form of art that every individual experiences differently -- the associations made are only through one's own memories and values and emotions. This is why pop music is so simple; it's engineered to be as appealing as possible to the largest demographics with disposable income.  That said, some associations aren't entirely to be shrugged off as coincidental. Music is far more powerful than most people give it credit for having. It can promote healing, and exacerbate pain; it can change your beliefs, and vindicate them; it can recover memories, and cloud them.   People like music that makes them feel good, or reinforces their emotional world view, so if it's particularly violent -- musically or lyrically -- it's easy to see where that concern comes from, particularly from the point of view of someone whose music is peripheral, or wallpaper, or otherwise not a central part of their lives.  If you're concerned about your friends' concern, when it comes up next, just say, ""what I like about this music is X, Y, and Z,"" and address any negative connotations they make individually. Whatever you do, don't insult their music. What speaks to each of us musically is almost involuntary, but it's a deep connection; insulting a fan's music is insulting the fan."

Considering the two you listed I'm thinkin those kinds of bands who share some of the technical concepts of what we typically call prog (skill, varied time signatures/beats, song structure, long songs, concept albums etc) but with a more poppy/traditional rock feel?  The kinds of bands that you're not entirely sure are ""progressive"" but kind of sound like they are.  I would put guys like Tool, Karnivool, 3, possibly Closure in Moscow's newest album. JOLLY, Thank You Scientist, The Mars Volta, and maybe Tides of Man in that group.  I don't know if i'd call this a genre per-say but this is my favorite ... range? of music (since even in this group i've listed theres a decent range of styles).  I love prog rock/metal but sometimes it can get very pretentious or music for the sake of theory more than for making music people want to hear.  On the flip side, I have a hard time listening to much top 40/popular rock anymore either.  The above bands and many others seem to walk the line between the skill and thought we all love about prog and the listenable, catchy songs we mostly enjoy about pop rock."

progrockmusic,3c4gta,spikebaylor,3,Sun Jul 5 14:59:06 2015 UTC,What of theirs have you tried listening to?  One of the things that I enjoy about C&C is their diversity.  They range from pop punk to decently proggy metal.  I would certainly listen to In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth:3 and Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV: Volume I.  Those are (arguably) their best two and show off their wider ranges.  Second Stage Turbine is a LOT more pop/punk influenced.  The two after Good Apollo were still good but a bit more poppy/formulaic in my opinion.  And I have not been able to get into the Afterman albums at all.
progrockmusic,3c4gta,SceneFromaMemory_123,2,Sun Jul 5 19:43:04 2015 UTC,"So far, I've listened The Second Stage Turbine Blade, Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume I, The Afterman: Ascension and a couple of songs from The Afterman: Descension.  I know, that everyone loves Good Apollo Vol. I, and It's considered as their best album, but I dont know... maybe I should give it another try. (I played it once.)  Well, as I said, I want to improve, explore new sounds, etc., so I'll probably go through whole discography (maybe I'll skip Year of the Black Rainbow), but at this point I'm not quite sure I really like them."

I do like it, but its certainly not their strongest.  Id say if you dont like good apollo after a second listen and also dont end up liking in keeping secrets, then they're probably just not your cup of tea.  Im guessing by your name that you are a dream theater fan? If you're lookin for some new things but still with that high skill you get from DT id try out some of the other bands i mentioned in my post. Karnivool (tool like, sound awake is a phenominal album) 3 (similar sound to C&C) closure in moscow's pink lemonade album (all over the place, psychedelic?) thank you scientist (proggy jazz pop sound) the mars volta (noisy with a latin feel) the dear hunter (kind of an indie sound, music goes so well with the stories veing told) JOLLY (maybe 90's alt rock sound but very talented) Seven Impale (very jazzy sound but harsh at times)"
progrockmusic,3c4gta,SceneFromaMemory_123,3,Mon Jul 6 04:09:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much man! Many of names you mentioned, I've never heard before.  Yeah, I like Dream Theater, Rush, Steven Wilson (and Porcupine Tree), Liquid Tension Experiment and sometimes Zappa. I recently started with Haken and Riverside.  I heard many people compares Coheed with Rush, that's one of the reasons I gave them a try."
progrockmusic,3c4gta,spikebaylor,2,Mon Jul 6 13:52:24 2015 UTC,"Hope you find something in there that you enjoy.  I love finding new music.  I was thinking yesterday that both Dream Theater and Porcupine Tree are the two biggest bands for changing my music direction.  DT was first and got me into some prog and guitar virtuoso (including LTE which is just amazing).  A few years later I found PT's In Absentia and it took me further into some prog.  Years after that Pandora came out and I made a PT station... it's been non-stop new music ever since.  Haken is a good place to start I think coming from DT as there is some resemblance.  Also probably Seventh Wonder's Mercy Falls is VERY DT sounding but pretty good.  I'm sure you're not looking for more of the same, but sometimes it helps to start there with minor differences and slowly branch out.  If you find that you like Riverside (or at least his voice, which I love) i HIGHLY recommend Lunatic Soul.  Different from most anything else I've listened to.  I can see the C&C comparison to Rush.  Not so much in sound, but both very ROCK centric with prog influences I think instead of maybe Progressive music that happens to be rock.  Also some of the lyrical themes are fantastical/space opera like.  You may have already gone this way, but you should check out /r/progmetal.  Its certainly not ALL going to be your cup of tea, but like progrock there is a VERY WIDE range of music that people consider prog metal. haken, pt, dt, C&C, and riverside have all been posted there."
progrockmusic,3c4gta,SceneFromaMemory_123,3,Mon Jul 6 15:54:27 2015 UTC,"Just thank you for your help and great music! It means a lot to me! I also love to explore music.  Ye, I feel the same way. Actually, when I found Porcupine Tree I didn't like it that much, but now... They (+ Steven Wilson) are one of the greatest things, I've ever heard! It's just magical.  About Haken and Riverside - I dont know them that much yet, I only listened to one album of each (The Mountain and Out of Myself) and I liked both of them. Riverside fells more ambient kind of progressive rock/metal, and Haken more like Dream Theater stuff."
progrockmusic,3c4gta,spikebaylor,2,Tue Jul 7 13:12:24 2015 UTC,"Awesome I hope you find something of interest in some of what I posted.  Its rare to find someone in my real life friends who cares about music, and when I do we always have differing taste so I never get to talk about music with anyone.  Out of Myself is my personal favorite of Riverside.  His voice is amazing in that ambient/somber mood.  When he tries to get heavier/metal like it just doesn't come off as well.  The later albums try to go more in that direction.  Lunatic Soul is his side project and sticks more to the sort of ambient/acoustic/somber style that I enjoy.  The Mountain is a great album.  Haken is an oddball for me as I like them, but I can't listen to them for very long.  His voice eventually starts to wear on me.  I'm guessing you know, but in case you don't, Steven Wilson is a crazy man and has a lot of side projects.  If you haven't listened to Blackfield (sorta poppy but in a steven wilson way, shares singing/writing duties with Israeli pop star Aviv Geffen) or Storm Corrosion (collaboration with Mikael Akerfeldt from Opeth, one of my favorite albums) you really should.  They are both really good in completely different ways from PT or his solo stuff.  There is also No Man but he isn't the singer... still writes most of it though., and then Bass Communion which I haven't listened to at all."

Not sure if it was because I overplayed them, but currently I find their music very dry and stereotypical.  Don't get me wrong, I respect them greatly for their musicianship and for their ability to ease the listener into the genre.  They just don't seem very unique in the midst of the genre, as in someone else always does it better.    Thoughts? (Pun intended)"

It has its charms, as does a lot of Spock's Beard I've listened to since. I don't see myself desperately getting to know their back catalogue (like I am for, say, Big Big Train), but I keep my eye out for used CDs and will get them eventually. Musicianship is fun and exceptional. The similarities to Gentle Giant are what keep me coming back for more, including on this new track."

While Tales from Topographic Oceans was more or less in the same style as the previous two albums, the change in drummers and songwriting style had given the following albums a more rock-driven feel, making Wakeman's playing feel like overkill on certain tracks (Going for the One, Wonderous Stories, Release Release, etc.)"

While I love Wakeman, it would've been interesting to see what else they could've come up with had Moraz stayed with the group longer.

After shuffling band members and after the baffling complexities of Topographic--which brought out the venom in the critics--these guys essentialy said, ""Fuck you, watch what we can do."" Wakeman quit in the spring of '74, and by Christmas of that same year they had written, recorded and released this album and was touring it and opening their sets with Sound Chaser. If that wasn't an emphatic declaration of what this band was about in those days I don't know what is."
progrockmusic,3bmxbv,death_by_chocolate,5,Tue Jun 30 21:23:36 2015 UTC,"The bass part on Sound Chaser still fucks my mind every time I hear it, holy shit. While I dont consider it to be the best Yes album, it's probably the third best. In a time when Yes was consistently pumping out fantastic albums, third best is, by no means, something to sneeze at. They got so jazzy on this album, too, especially on Sound Chaser. Fuck I love this band."
progrockmusic,3bmxbv,Zinchism,4,Tue Jun 30 16:55:49 2015 UTC,"I love this album. Got into it as a wide-eyed teenager and when I met some dude who said he liked Yes but not Relayer I found it hard to believe such people could exist. I was a devout Relayer fan and still am. Whenever hear it I am still freaked out by how amazingly good Steve Howe's work on this album is. Also continue to be blown away by the complexity and strangeness of the songs, not to mention the sheer beauty. I mean, what other freaks but prog rockers would bury the sublimely beautiful ballad Soon in a 21 minute frenzy of Delirium?  Bless you Mr. Chris Squire for your part in bringing this shit into the world."
progrockmusic,3bmxbv,progodyssey,5,Tue Jun 30 16:16:15 2015 UTC,"While CTTE is maybe the epitome of Yes at their Yessiest, this album stands out so hard. What an amazing release.

progrockmusic,3bmxbv,armorandsword,3,Wed Jul 1 20:15:17 2015 UTC,"I essentially grew up with Yes (born in 1984), but Relayer was an album that took a while for me to figure out.  All my father (who introduced/brainwashed me to the band) listened to was the classic three (TYA, Fragile, CTTE), and the 80s and 90s stuff, leaving me to discover that '73-'80 period on my own.  Tormato and Drama came pretty quickly to me, they weren't as expansive or experimental as the others (arguably).  Going for the One was okay (it would take a while for me to realize the masterpiece that is Awaken), but Tales and Relayer never made sense (and I loved Close to the Edge!).  However, as time has gone on and I've given those two albums more chances, Relayer started coming together for me, mostly because I actually sat down and really listened to Sound Chaser (that song doesn't leave my iPod anymore).  To Be Over is nice, showing the softer side of the band.  And while it still remains a bit tough to sit through, I can easily say that Gates of Delirium is certainly more organized and memorable than anything on Tales (which still seems overlong and forgettable, IMO).  While Relayer may not reach my top 10 Yes albums, it certainly has improved over time for me, and I can finally see why so many other prog rock fans praise it so much."
progrockmusic,3bmxbv,bj_waters,5,Tue Jun 30 19:32:59 2015 UTC,"I'm always glad to hear when folks finally 'get' Sound Chaser. Because this is what that song is about: it's about prowess, and musicianship, and mastery over your instruments and the sounds they produce. It's about having that ability, that talent to do anything you want: the jazzy drum solo, the stuttering bass staccatto of triplets, a screaming guitar solo--accompanied by actual screams--a quiet foggy mellotron movement or a pedal-steel samba and pull it off confidently and precisely. To be able to chase any kind of sound you can imagine without limits. It's a showoff piece--and like a wild west Gunslinger twirling his revolvers and brandishing his bandoliers they came ready for a showdown and a shootout.  It always reminds me of that crazy guitar intro to Close to the Edge which sounds like it's spinning out of control until that moment when they all come to an instantaneous dead stop and those angelic vocals ring out--and just so you'll know it wasn't some kind of happy accident they do it again a few bars later. ""Yup. We can do that."""

They released those three albums in the space of a few short years, TYA in Feb of 1971 folowed by Fragile and finally CttE in September 1972.

I was still in the early phases of exploring progressive rock and picked Relayer up. I first put on side B by accident and my mind was blown. The power of those instrumentals never fail to get my mind racing.

Are there significant differences between the tracks as they appear on House of Yes and their respective studio counterparts? (Hint: NO)."

Then again, I'd be putting Talk and The Ladder in the top 10 and Tales towards the bottom.  I doubt we'll ever come to any kind of consensus on what the best of Yes is, but I knew Stereogum's list was pretty jarring to look at (and thus worth sharing!)."

It's a shame that Yes left him behind in their recent tours, but I heard he has more fun working on his solo projects as he tends to sing a lot more in them than the half hour instrumental masterpieces in Yes.

When Chris began playing that bass line, he had this big shiat-eating grin on his face. That big grin on his face at that moment is what I remember most from that show.

I always wondered - morbidly, I guess - which one of their deaths I'd take the hardest. Peter Banks went and I was certainly sad, but not absolutely devastated.  Now, this.  I have been a drummer since I was 16 as well, and so obviously as a yes fan, I am fond of Bill and Alan. But Chris......  Chris was the real INSPIRATION of this band. He was the very heart and soul. People dropped off the Yes bus throughout their history; some stayed loyal fans throughout.   I personally - for the very first time - ""abandoned"" the band as a fan after the last studio album. It was one of those moments that I saw so many other Yes fans go through with previous studio albums; you know, the whole ""sorry folks, the magic's gone now"" etc. I wondered when that moment would come too, and now I wish I would have hung on just a little longer and been more supportive.

And that being said, is there any one else think it's a massive shame that we couldn't get him (and the rest of Yes) into the RnRHoF before this?  I know that Eddie Trunk has been saying some pretty cool things on his Twitter about it.  I mean, we all knew that the RnRHoF was run by idiots, but after seeing SO MANY musicians express their sadness and condolences, it just shows how idiotic not including them in the HoF is.

At the time, I thought that sounded far-fetched, but now I'm not so sure.   Chris literally owned the band; the rights to the name belonged to him alone. I'm not sure what will happen now legally, but since there are already plans to move ahead without the Big Man, I wouldn't be at all surprised if Wakeman's prediction comes true after all. 20 years from now, we could very well be seeing a Davison-fronted band with Oliver Wakeman on keys, Sherwood on bass, and some fresh young talent filling out the rest of the ranks.

progrockmusic,3bek3w,CamelLoggins,9,Sun Jun 28 14:37:40 2015 UTC,"At the start, it was Squire and Anderson, young and hungry and wanting to play together in a rock band. Together they had the concept of what we now call ""prog"" with Beatles-style vocal harmonies which was always the core of the Yes sound. For me, they're a duo: the Jagger/Richards of prog.  That's still the heart of the band, as you said. Yes will continue on but, with all respect to the current edition, never be the same."
progrockmusic,3bek3w,SinisterMinisterX,2,Sun Jun 28 16:08:43 2015 UTC,"Yes will continue on   Do we have confirmation of this? It seems extremely distasteful. They should do, at most, a few reunion shows with Sherwood on bass to raise money for leukemia research, and then hang it up."
progrockmusic,3bek3w,IlFactotumDeLaCitta,2,Mon Jun 29 16:45:37 2015 UTC,"I assumed they would finish this summer's tour, since shows are already booked and tickets sold. I didn't mean to imply any more beyond that.  I was probably also being melodramatic in the wake of Squire's death. I think I may have said ""Yes will continue on"" just to cheer myself up a bit."
progrockmusic,3bek3w,SinisterMinisterX,2,Tue Jun 30 02:29:37 2015 UTC,"He was the heart, the souls and the backbone. People always complain that Jon Anderson leaving/being excluded from the band meant it wasn't Yes anymore. The real truth though is that only Chris was irreplaceable."

Remove Chris though and you're losing a major instrument, a vocalist and a composer/songwriter. Jon was always an architect but he didn't bring as much in a substantive sense as Chris did. Jon and Chris together were essential for some the albums but I'd wager the band won't be able to progress without Chris."

Just because you don't like religion and proclaim ""Science for the win!"" doesn't make you extremely skeptical.  Take Rush's well-known fixation upon the work of the novelist Ayn Rand. Tracks such as ""The Trees"" make this so-called philosopher's influence on the band fairly transparent."
progrockmusic,3bejc0,ja524309,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:53:56 2015 UTC,"In interviews, Peart has said his views have moderated since then. He recently called himself a ""bleeding heart libertarian"" in the Beyond the Lighted Stage documentary implying perhaps a broadening of recognition for the need for compassion and support for those who need it. I don't mean to imply that Peart would self-identify as a skeptic, merely that his work would be the most friendly to those who do. I should clarify when I use the word skeptical, I mean with the connotations of the modern skeptical movement, also called scientific skepticism, which emphasizes a disdain for any claim not supported by evidence, a loathing of scams and superstition, insistence on critical thinking, and a reliance on the method of science especially as represented by various folks including bloggers, vloggers, and some scientists including Carl Sagan (when he was alive), James Randi, Paul Kurtz, Michael Shermer, Paul Offit, Steven Novella, Rebecca Watson, Richard Dawkins, and until recently, PZ Meyers.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_skepticism"

Their 1996 album THRaK and their 2003 album The Power To Believe (the latter is especially intense, much like TMV and Tool) are in a more metal vein then their other albums, but are very obscure.

If you find you're enjoying the rhythmic interplay of Tool, you might take a look at bands like Neurosis, maybe Russian Circles, and a few of the other alt-metal bands from the early/mid 90s. There are no copycats but you can tell there were some shared influences between them.  As for The Mars Volta, I've heard very few bands that sound like them. You might check out some of Omar Rodriguez-Lopez's solo albums, particularly the ones credited to his Quintet, as those are the most ""Volta-esque"" in terms of the styles of music."

I can give a lot of good metal recs if you're curious.  But yeah Gentle Giant are the bee's fucking knees. Most fun prog band."
progrockmusic,3b89l3,RNGmaster,2,Fri Jun 26 21:42:44 2015 UTC,Too true. Two albums immediately came to mind for me.   Colors - Between the Buried And Me  Crack The Skye - Mastodon
progrockmusic,3b89l3,agentwiggles,5,Fri Jun 26 23:03:12 2015 UTC,"Between the Buried and Me   How about no. Gentle Giant managed to do eclecticism well because they were really really good songwriters who could weave together melodies into songs that were actually songs. BTBAM don't do this. No development of ideas, no flow, just ""hey let's toss the kitchen sink at the listeners to show them how fucking eclectic and technical we are"".  I'm speaking as someone who listens to a lot of prog metal and metalcore, including stuff like Unexpect that people would say is disjointed and eclectic for its own sake, and I cannot understand the appeal of that band, despite listening to each of their albums several times over. I mean, Unexpect are obnoxious but they have songs that are based around themes and riffs rather than a parade of filler ideas and sweep picking. I do like BTBAM's early material, before they decided that Mr. Bungle were the best songwriters ever, but... really, I'm missing the appeal, I guess.  I was thinking of stuff like Psychotic Waltz, Ved Buens Ende, Voivod, Coroner, Atheist, Deathrow, Kekal, Dark Millennium, Garden Wall, Maudlin of the Well, etc. Not very Gentle Giant-like on the surface, but they are similar in that they incorporate eclecticism into dense arrangements that actually have a point, and ideas tying them together.  And Haken and Native Construct have some Gentle Giant influence but, as with BTBAM, they're disjointed horseshit. Native Construct especially."

If I'm using tool as an example of metal, then obviously my scope of the genre is limited. Even when I did listen to metal a lot back in the day. It was nu metal, like deftones, korn, system of a down, rage against the machine (which is more funk/metal) and bands like that.   Don't get me wrong tho, I've definitely dipped my feet into some pretty hard stuff like lamb of god, six feet under, a black rose burial and etc.. but again, besides six ft under, those other bands kind of get laughed at by the metal community. I've heard so many metal heads even tell me lamb of God isn't real ""metal"" but yea, I don't mind. I'm very opened to music, so I don't mind u suggesting bands. I'm just not super into metal, I think there's a time and place for intense music like that. Especially at the gym but I operate at a pretty chill level lol.

It's worth noting however that although they're generally included under the progressive umbrella with Yes and Crimson etc. they have a very very different sound.   I live Kc but I'm no expert, but would recommend their debut album, Red and Discipline as reasonable starting points.

progrockmusic,3b6dym,SceneFromaMemory_123,8,Fri Jun 26 09:57:56 2015 UTC,"The answer is yes, you should listen to them. Stop worrying about whether or not something is progressive. They write great songs.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS6BmrA6dSY"
progrockmusic,3b6dym,intraspeculator,4,Fri Jun 26 12:03:58 2015 UTC,"I'm sure a lot of the hesitation around delving into them for members of this sub is their pop-punk roots. I was 12 when I first started listening to C&C, and at that time my other two favorite bands were Saves the Day and New Found Glory (Saves the Day is still up there for me). But, being that C&C loved Maiden and Rush, the prog and 80's metal sounds crept more and more into their music.   You could say that C&C introduced me to classic prog because I grew up well after those bands had peaked. And that is what's awesome about them."
progrockmusic,3b6dym,Lipofect,2,Fri Jun 26 13:03:08 2015 UTC,Thanks I have been dancing around this band for a while.  What other songs or album would be good to listen to.
progrockmusic,3b6dym,incomplete,3,Fri Jun 26 14:21:53 2015 UTC,"You can't go wrong with the first 4 albums.  Second Stage Turbine Blade is the best. I will always go back to this album. The whole album is incredible. The production is a bit thin because they didn't have a lot of money I expect, with it being their first album. Also worth a listen is the live version of the album from the Neverender album. Especially Everything Evil which is a lot better live than on the album.  My favourite tracks are:  Delirium Trigger - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NItTBfA_BM Neverender - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVVZ5RgIc2M.  My next favourite is In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth 3. It was the first one i heard and I love every track. Its also probably their most accessible album. I think of it as being their Nevermind.   Best Track: The Crowing - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXCsR6tBE-Q  Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV is considered their best album by most people. Its a huge album with a lot of different styles.  Best track: My favourite is probably From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness that i linked above. Next favourite is probably Welcome Home which was their biggest hit. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVn2z5n9Y-k  Finally No World For Tomorrow, their 4th album is great but it suffers because they lost their drummer. They replaced him with Taylor Hawkins from Foo Fighters, and it really shows, sadly. The songs come across as a lot more pop and less complex.   Best Track: No World for Tomorrow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuqbOCXRY9k  Now you probably notice that most of my favourites are more towards the Iron Maiden range of influence rather than the Rush style prog influenced songs, so don't necessarily take my word for it. You should listen to them yourself and make your own mind up. Their style ranges a lot through different influences.  I haven't really listened to much since Year of the Black Rainbow because I really didnt care for it at all.  I do quite like Afterman Descention but i only recently started listening to it. this one is pretty good https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4arymSpmg&list=PL7p6PKDjHI4UKTGEDatELHKE2xB5Tb4Sk  Hope this is helpful!"
progrockmusic,3b6dym,intraspeculator,2,Fri Jun 26 15:07:18 2015 UTC,"The only album I think is weak is black rainbow - I love Afterman! However, the first two definitely show their college punk roots more than later albums, but the songwriting is still strong and there are some amazing classics in there. Delerium Trigger, 2113 etc. Actulaay, 2113 would be a great tune to give someone who wants to hear them at their proggiest. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gcik1ZMTDv8"
progrockmusic,3b6dym,theg33kshow,3,Fri Jun 26 23:09:18 2015 UTC,"If you like Rush, You'll find lots to like in C&C. While not every song has complex time sigs or many other typical proggy pointers, the entire band concept is as prog as fuck, as are their lyrics, and especially song/album titles. Seriously - how can you have an album titled ""Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness"" and it not be prog?"
progrockmusic,3b6dym,theg33kshow,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:05:10 2015 UTC,"To me, they're not prog rock. To others, they are. If you like them that's all that's important."
progrockmusic,3b6dym,armorandsword,-1,Fri Jun 26 14:00:35 2015 UTC,I thought they were considered emo.  I used to call them Coheed and Killyourself
progrockmusic,3b3s82,Veech42,7,Thu Jun 25 19:00:15 2015 UTC,"It has potential.  The weak points are that it's very cliche, and your singing (melodies and harmonies are mostly good though).  It feels like you're trying to recreate every one of your favorite prog moments. It's fine to have influences, but as of now, it's too obvious that you like Yes, Pink Floyd, Rush,etc.  Overall, there's a lot of good ideas in there though, but i feel like you don't expand on your best ideas.  For example on ""Going on a trip"" you have this really good section (i've thought for the longest time) that (Imo) should be building to a great climax instead of simply going back to the chorus. You could reintroduce the chorus melody (has back vocals maybe) in that particular groove and the result would be much stronger. That's only my opinion though."
progrockmusic,3b3s82,JokerLiquid,7,Fri Jun 26 02:18:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for your criticism. I never seriously sang that much until relatively recently but I'm working on improving my voice. Breaking away from my influences in my writing has been difficult but compared to my earlier songs (not officially released) they seem to hold their own better. I really appreciate you taking the time to critique my work.
progrockmusic,3b3s82,JokerLiquid,5,Fri Jun 26 03:21:53 2015 UTC,No problem man! Music writing is my passion in life and i feel like constructive criticism can go a long way in helping one improve. Hope your music gets recognized one day. Peace!
progrockmusic,3b3s82,louis_deboot,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:39:01 2015 UTC,"I think you could also use a slightly more full and sustaining guitar sound. There were a couple times where the sound just felt weak... Not technically, but just in terms of sound. Could be a mixing problem, maybe it's your pedals.  Idk though. Maybe I'm just nit picking.  Good overall though."
progrockmusic,3b3s82,Colawar,3,Fri Jun 26 04:12:46 2015 UTC,"Skimmed through all the songs (i know i know this is a no-no for prog rock haha), pretty solid man. Im going to listen to all of it when I get back. Did you record everything yourself?   Also Heavy Mental Sludge/Existential Craziness is groovy as fuck."
progrockmusic,3b3s82,OreoBA,3,Thu Jun 25 22:25:32 2015 UTC,Yes I did. I played all the instruments and mixed/mastered everything myself. The whole album took me a little over a month to write and record.
progrockmusic,3b3s82,acoustiguy,3,Fri Jun 26 00:47:00 2015 UTC,The first song got me hooked in.  Going to give a listen!
progrockmusic,3b2a61,progodyssey,3,Thu Jun 25 11:46:44 2015 UTC,"Beautiful song. I prefer the House of Blues version. Can't find it on YouTube, but here it is on Spotify."
progrockmusic,3b2a61,chrisrazor,3,Thu Jun 25 15:51:27 2015 UTC,I got to see it performed in 2002. With Wakeman on keys. It's a magical experience to see this song live.
progrockmusic,3b2a61,drowse,2,Thu Jun 25 16:28:00 2015 UTC,"I saw them play it in 1991 - ""Union"" tour. It was by far the highlight of the show for me."
progrockmusic,3b2a61,Dubhan,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:21:40 2015 UTC,When in doubt Spotify delivers:)  (Sometimes)
progrockmusic,3b2a61,drumsarelife,2,Fri Jun 26 00:00:42 2015 UTC,"I LOVE the 10/28/78 version that they did, they should have released that show commercially, it is such a wonderful sounding show. The BBC did a great mix and 'Awaken' is probably it's highlight - Wakeman's keyboards on this particular version are just perfect :)"
progrockmusic,3b2a61,sir_percy_percy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:37:31 2015 UTC,"""High vibration go on"" is one of the best section (both intro and end) in prog history. But this song is uneven. The Wakeman section is too long and the ""working of mans"" melody isn't that strong in my opinion. But i just can't deny the  brilliance of the intro and the Howe section."
