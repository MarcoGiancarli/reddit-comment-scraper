As a seller, it just feels like a personal criticism if you do it in a public forum of the comments section.   We were all new here once, and I have found if I contact a seller and say I will offer you 'x' amount of dollars because I found it for this price over here, most sellers will be happy to work with you. If not, then you always have that other place to fall back on.     If you find someone selling something at a great price, go ahead and comment on that. If you don't think a price is great, just move on to the next post, or PM the seller."

They were added I believe to all 2014 coins and I can't tell from pictures too well but it looks like they don't have them.  Also, this picture ( http://i.imgur.com/Sf31xs3.jpg ) and this picture ( http://i.imgur.com/E8GVV7b.jpg )appears to be a maple with no security lines and no privy mark, ie the little maple with a 14 in it, but in your last picture ( http://i.imgur.com/PWyz19l.jpg ) the privies clearly are there and these must be the security line maples if they have them as they were introduced at the same time.  Confused because there appear to be inconsistencies in the maples pictured."
