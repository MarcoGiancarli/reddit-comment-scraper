StuffOnCats,2ulasg,Corwhuss,10,Tue Feb 3 02:29:01 2015 UTC,"Aww. This reminds me of one of my old kitties.  When my mom was pregnant with my sister, our cat Quarry would never leave my mom's side. As soon as she sat down, Quarry would curl up on her bump and sleep. When Natalie was born, Quarry wouldn't let her out of her sight. She would sleep in the crib, follow her around the house, etc.  When Natalie started walking, Quarry would scoot along the floors next to her and if she fell, Quarry would go comfort her. Nat could drag that cat around, sleep on her, play with her forever and Quarry could not be happier about it. Quarry wouldn't take shit from anyone but my sister seemed to be the ticket. Q died when my sister was 10, but they had a good 10 years together and I don't think I have ever seen such a bond between a kid and a cat.  RIP Quarry, I'm glad you found someone you liked."

StuffOnCats,2u2ghe,Spear253,3,Thu Jan 29 12:34:15 2015 UTC,Yes. I was putting pens around the pistol for a joke on /r/guns and he just sat on top of everything.
StuffOnCats,2u2ghe,jakeinator21,1 point,Thu Jan 29 20:51:55 2015 UTC,What was the joke originally? I was hoping the comments on your original post would explain it but I couldn't find it.
StuffOnCats,2u2ghe,jakeinator21,1 point,Tue Feb 3 22:42:21 2015 UTC,People were using pens to prop up their pistols to take pictures of them. It became a running joke after so many pictures with pens.
StuffOnCats,2u2ghe,monopolyking,2,Tue Feb 3 23:16:29 2015 UTC,"Heh, that's funny. I need to sub to /r/guns now."

StuffOnCats,2u2ghe,RWSchosen1,1 point,Thu Jan 29 12:34:10 2015 UTC,It's one thing to unnecessarily put a weapon in the picture. But why did you have to cock it?
StuffOnCats,2u2ghe,RWSchosen1,4,Thu Jan 29 15:53:01 2015 UTC,The only way to put the safety up on a 1911 is with the hammer cocked. :/
StuffOnCats,2u2ghe,RWSchosen1,1 point,Thu Jan 29 20:56:07 2015 UTC,"He may have kept the weapon in that condition in his nightstand/as a carry weapon. Safety's up, hammer's at full cock, and chamber status is unknown (presumably round chambered?. Rule 1, after all).   I'm willing to bet that the cat photobombed the gun shoot, and the owner got his vengeance by putting pens on the cat."
StuffOnCats,2u2ghe,Wodge,3,Thu Jan 29 16:07:17 2015 UTC,"This is what happened. Mag out and chamber cleared, but the kitty does not understand what rules are."
