You first need to understand that the mind and the brain are two completely different things. The brain is an organ which scientists have been able to map out but the mind still remains a general mystery. To put it as simple as possible I can explain it through the recognition of beauty, because on an evolutionary basis appreciating things like music, art and other such beautiful things is meaningless on an evolutionary perspective but yet we see it happen. You can very easily dismiss this as chemical reactions in the brain but their actual purpose is still more or less unknown. The brain is an organ in which the spirit that is YOU presides. This is all mostly philosophical stuff that involves a lot of pseudo science and in order to understand it one has to perform A LOT of thought experiments and keep an open mind, the realization of the spirit and all that stuff is the result of a number of thought experiments that you have performed within your mind. Remember, electricity was thought to be magic before just because no one could clearly see it."

We are a by product of nature so why would nature want to recognize beauty in itself ? I'm not saying that recognizing beauty is meaningless but I'm asking why have we evolved to recognize beauty ?"
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,1rnoi3,utsavman,3,Mon Mar 3 14:06:10 2014 UTC,"Well, apparently people who could recognise beauty had an advantage over those who couldn't, else we would never have developed that ability.

There are some theories about how recognising beauty can help you in an evolutionary sense, you should see this talk: http://www.ted.com/talks/denis_dutton_a_darwinian_theory_of_beauty"
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,1rnoi3,moderndaycassiusclay,2,Tue Mar 4 14:30:39 2014 UTC,"That was a very lovely video and I enjoyed watching it. But I still think that the recognition and creation of beautiful things has got a lot more going on than just creating beautiful things to appeal a sex partner or that people would appreciate a work of art due to the amount of work put into it. I understand that the tear drop shaped stones explains the origins of art but it doesn't fully explain how art has been branching out itself in the present time. The tear drop stone originally had a purpose but was later on used to attract mates, but what about current art ? there are so many artists who create things only for themselves and continue to do so even if no one appreciates them. A heavy metal musician continues to make metal music even though women don't appreciate heavy metal, also many art forms are not appreciated for the amount of work put into it but the ""feeling"" that's present in the art what is this feeling that people speak of ? And what about modern art ? where a person creates something entirely new and weird with little effort but people are still there to appreciate it, you'd have to be naive to not ask where Salvador Dali got the imagination for his paintings. Yes this video explains the origins of beauty but it doesn't explain the way people have been creating beauty in current times and how we continue to redefine what is and what is not beautiful."

But we aren't freaking out about Internet points. Taking away a thumbnail preview is counter productive, simple as that. People can whine all they want about people karma mining and all that, but I do not care in the slightest. The people are the true moderators of the sub, and what they decide will be seen. If nobody wants the memes, they wouldn't be upvoted so often. Although we have probably seen them before, it's become obvious that not everyone has, so let them get some enjoyment as well. It seems like this whole thing is about quality and karma. The quality is still there, you just have to look for it (or head to true atheism). And nobody should care about karma.  My two cents"

Almost by definition, people don't recognize their own superstitions for what they are! It's always ""my beliefs are completely reasonable and well-founded, that person's beliefs are silly superstitions.""  Asking someone how superstitious they are is more or less like asking ""on a scale of 1-10, how stupid are your sincerely held beliefs?"" The question itself relies on the contradictory assumptions that they know their beliefs are superstitious nonsense, yet hold them anyway."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,1dnw7l,Icarus3,8,Sat May 4 07:13:02 2013 UTC,"Not really.  Some superstitions are impulsive or societal (People trained to do things that are, themselves, not worth anything, but are habit), or are known to the individual as personal comforts.  My mom believes in ghosts to explain her (possibly hallucinated) experiences during childhood.  She also considers it superstitious that she generally adheres to the advice of her zodiac, and her rational is ""It may just be superstition, yes, but on days when I've no idea what to do it tends to give me a direction"".  Number-fears or acknowledgement thereof can be a societal thing, and most people acknowledge those as silly, I think.  In situations that invoke fear or the unknown or the uncontrolled (like a dark evening or some such), people's reactions to otherwise normal noises and sounds is heightened naturally... that would count too, methinks.  Religion is another kettle of fish, and I don't mean to dismiss your point (which I largely agree with), but there's a lot of breadth possible in the question itself."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,1d1vtl,otakuman,7,Fri Apr 26 00:32:41 2013 UTC,"A very good question.   In summation, it's a matter of respect to the slaughtered beast.   Generally, there is no established or authoritative reason for the prohibition. One rationale is that animals are slaughtered in a ritual manner because they are given a higher status than mere vegetation. Thus, to cook a creature in its own blood or its mothers own milk (or even the creature's own milk) is insulting in the face of that; in other words, it adds insult to the injury of slaughter.   Similar prohibitions against inhumane practices exist elsewhere in the Old Testament:   ""But you shall not kill an ox or a sheep and her young in one day."" Leviticus 22:28 ""If you come across a bird's nest in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs and the mother sitting on the young or on the eggs, you shall not take the mother with the young."" Deuteronomy 22:6   Simply put, it's a matter of decency. I can see this prohibition being stated in a sermon today. It is absolutely relevant and I wouldn't want to do it on the ground that it is improper to a point of morality."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,1cncl5,infinitum17,10,Mon Aug 19 07:37:43 2013 UTC,"As a lifelong militant atheist, I nevertheless vehemently disagree with this characterization of Craig. His arguments always boil down to one thing: the origin of morality. He points out that if there is no celestial standard of good and evil, then there really is no such thing as good and evil, which is a compelling argument for people who have not thought carefully about good an evil, and have not realized that they are not real concepts. The burden is then shifted to the atheist to explain a very nuanced moral philosophy to an undecided audience, which is impossible given the time constraints. It's an extremely effective rhetorical tactic, and as he sees it, a good argument, too. It does requires the atheist to either admit that there is no such thing as good and evil, or oversimplify his views to the point of deception. Craig is wrong, but this argument is still an effective one (if still invalid)."

It's being used to marginalize outpspoken atheists, who could perhaps be called proselytizing or evangelical atheists, or activist atheists. But none of these folks want to ban religion, kill the religious, make the pledge of allegiance say ""under no gods"" or make a state religion of atheism. The disanlogies between the ""militant"" atheists and even moderate religious people, who are more radical in their beliefs when you take the blinders off, make this a poor term to use."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,1c9gjs,koera,2,Sun Apr 14 17:35:22 2013 UTC,"Seriously, though, your assumptions (ha) are flawed.   Though your examples don't work too well due to the overwhelming amount of evidence we have on how the earth rotates   Yeah, it's a very good assumption that the Sun will rise tomorrow, because angular momentum is conserved, but it's possible that the Sun will be destroyed by some unforeseen event.  Maybe some gamma ray burst will shoot right at it, or some alien civilization that has discovered faster than light travel will move it into subspace, or something like that.  We strongly and wholeheartedly believe that these things are pure science fiction, but we haven't actually proved that there's no way for something to surprise us like this.  We just know that it hasn't happened yet.  Or, if it did, we've recovered from it without knowing it happened.  Or a bunch of things.   We trust them not to kill us due to a past that implies they won't.   Isn't it possible that one of your friends is secretly a spy sent to kill you?  He'll gain your trust over a long time, and when you've let down your guard, he'll betray you.  You usually assume that this will not happen.  You're probably right, especially if you're not an enemy of a country or crime syndicate.  But it's still an assumption, and it's an assumption that has been wrong before for other people.  There has never been a time when the Sun did not rise as it should have (in the proper latitudes, anyway), but there have been people who were betrayed by longtime friends.  Evidence is not proof.  That's pretty sad, but it's true.  All the evidence in the universe will prove something, but we don't have all the evidence in the universe, and we don't know that there isn't something that will invalidate our results.  We have to make assumptions that what we know is true, because so far those assumptions haven't failed us, and when they do, we'll make new ones.  The only way to actually prove something is mathematically -- and then, we don't know that the math applies to the physical thing.  We know that if this physical phenomenon is governed by this equation, this result applies, but we don't know that it is!  In fact, we usually know that it isn't, because there's some small effect we're purposely neglecting.  We have to make assumptions.  We should just endeavor to make good ones."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,1c9gjs,xiipaoc,1 point,Sun Apr 14 18:59:45 2013 UTC,"As you point out, things that have never happened might happen. As such I might become a single point of governing of naturalistic law by the time you read this reply, and as that governing entity I declare that the sun will be unchangeable by living creatures. Well at least we have the same equation to use to not be able to calculate the probability of both, as they never have happened.   As to people being betrayed and murdered we have some data on the issue and can calculate a somewhat useful probability for that. Which seems to come out as rather unlikely, though I haven't done the math I think it's safe to say so.   However in the end, using common sense when evaluating evidence to try to deal with a practical world and not some puristic mathematical universal mega truth, I think we can be confident that the sun will rise tomorrow, and explain why and still be intellectually honest."

It isn't about ones' beliefs being stronger than the other, and if it was, going to church every day is neither necessary, no proof of anything.  And with all your ""My good ladies,"" the top hat and monocle, you come across as aggrandizing yourself--seeing yourself as a hero.  It is good you stood up for them.  And you deserved that high five, but you're overselling yourself here.  And going to church doesn't necessarily remind you of what you believe because you forget it, it helps you stay in touch with that part of you.  Makes sure you don't lose touch with it.  Anyone can do that, with any part of themselves, if they're not careful--it doesn't mean their beliefs are lesser.  You would've done better to point out that God is the only one fit to judge, the Bible might be written by God but it was translated by man, etc.  Get 'em with their own logic.

There is a difference between not believing something and believing it's wrong.  Most atheists that i know are skeptics, all of them are also agnostics, and most of them are positive atheists. They know they hold the burden of proof to show that a god doesn't exist, but they don't need to prove it with absolute certainty because that is ridiculous. They just realize that Occam's Razor is damned accurate to reality and that it makes god extremely unlikely. That and all the theist arguments are utterly retarded.  Theists often like to use Presuppositional apologetics as a response to occam's razor, then the common response back is this."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,1agcy9,tmnt9001,0,Tue Apr 16 16:38:50 2013 UTC,I'm not sure where you get that from...  I was just stating that Absence of evidence is evidence of absence.  The correct version of that statement usually supports the case of a deity not existing (if it existed there should be some evidence of it's existence).  Did you at least read the link I provided? Here it is again: http://lesswrong.com/lw/ih/absence_of_evidence_is_evidence_of_absence/
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,1agcy9,Yowski,0,Fri Apr 19 15:09:57 2013 UTC,"just because we cannot presently prove something exists with absolute certainty does not mean that such a thing, or evidence for it, does not exist. It may simply mean that we have not yet discovered it. By suggesting that if there is no evidence for something it does not exist, you are saying that until we discover something- it does not exist. This means that until its discovery in 1781, Uranus did not exist because evidence of its existence was absent. Since Neptune was not discovered until 1846, it did not exist until then. Pluto didn't exist until 1930 when it was discovered because there was no evidence of its existence."

If you have read it, here is a hint on what might be causing confusion: evidence != proof.  Anyway, from your answers you seem to be trying to say that (some version of) God exists even though there is no evidence for its existence. Whether or not (some version of) God exists, this:   The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.   is still wrong."

I apologize for ""shoving"" the article down your throat, it is a very good and clear article and from your replies it seemed that you didn't read it. Maybe it was just my confusion.  I will be more than happy to continue this discussion if we can stay on topic. I will address any questions or comments on the subject of absence of evidence being evidence of absence or not.

It's been documented time and time again
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,19ty0n,ShibeBot,3,Thu Apr 11 21:17:55 2013 UTC,"One problem with ""Christian fundamental values"" is that some are good, and some aren't, and we need some way to tell the difference.  Usually, the people arguing for a particular ""Christian value"" don't bother demonstrating why that value is good.  Instead, they just say ""God wants it"", which is silly, because Christians can't even agree on what God wants, or even on an objective method for determining what God wants.  How can Christians expect non-Christians to believe what they're saying when they can't even come up with a consistent story themselves?  You sound like a Christian.  Do you have the same beliefs about God that your parents do?  My guess is probably not.  If not, how can you expect to convince the rest of the world when you can't even convince yourselves?  TL;DR - ""Christian values"" aren't even well-defined."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,193knw,jdylopa,0,Mon Mar 18 21:14:21 2013 UTC,"Precisely.  One of the early lessons scientists must learn is that being wrong is not bad, but not admitting you're wrong is.  I was writing up my master's thesis and realised I had screwed up some results.  I had already published them and hadn't been found out so I could have just gone with it but I fronted up and did some more work to show what I did wrong and fixed it.  I didn't get in trouble and I felt better for doing it because I learnt more.  It is vital that scientists are totally honest and if the results don't match your expectations, so what?  Your expectations made you do the experiment and it proved you were wrong but now you know more.  I've known people who's PhD completely failed, but they still got the PhD because they did the work to show their original hypothesis was wrong. Mine worked out nicely but I don't ever worry about being wrong because all knowledge is good.  Sticking with an idea despite evidence against it is the ultimate scumbag response.  Do some more experiments and if they all keep showing your idea is wrong, drop it and move on to a new hypothesis which fits the results."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,183nmb,saihenjin,47,Fri Feb 8 01:22:21 2013 UTC,It's a factor in a common evangelical argument for the existence of God.

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,183nmb,HerpWillDevour,1 point,Fri Feb 8 09:11:35 2013 UTC,The first law states that the energy of the surroundings (q) equals negative the system's energy (-q). So there is not much you can do with it
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,183nmb,saihenjin,21,Fri Apr 12 02:56:57 2013 UTC,"It's an excuse to lead in to the claim that no ordered states naturally occur from unordered states.  Science meanwhile has told us the second law may be broken on a regional scale while on the universal scale holding true. Hence we can exist and advance and create more order in our realm while the broader universe is decaying around us.  Hopefully ninja edit: Sorry I didn't say how people try to use it as an excuse to believe. It's a counter-evolution argument, we couldn't possible have come from monkeys because science says we cannot eveolve from anything simpler as it would violate the second law of thermodynamics."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,183nmb,HerpWillDevour,17,Fri Feb 8 01:27:08 2013 UTC,"...but it wouldn't, because the law specifically states that it applies only to isolated systems. The Earth is not an isolated system, it receives energy inputs from outside sources in the form of solar energy, cosmic rays, and much more. And besides that, on a cosmic scale, life on this planet hasn't been around long enough to statistically affect our rate of entropy gain over time...  I mean, I know you're not defending that view/argument, but it just baffles me how someone could try to call a science argument like that without understanding what they're using."

Miracles, creation, etc.  We can't prove there is no deistic god which never interacts with the universe after it was  created, because we cannot see outside of our universe.  If the bible is all just metaphor, there is nothing to prove, as they can not use the bible as a source of their belief, their claim rests solely on ""I think, for absolutely no reason, that a god exists""."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,16i6zc,dudewhatthehellman,3,Sun Jan 13 23:22:22 2013 UTC,Burden of proof lies on the believer. Get them to attempt to prove it and laugh at the results.

For instance, if there is a box whose interior can be easily checked, and I tell you: ""prove there's not a ball inside the box"", then you can easily open the box and see. My claim can be either true or false, but it's definitely provable or disprovable."

Here is my evidence."" in this case the evidence would disprove the argument, see? The other party just has to listen to the hypothesis.   Edit: It's a fallacy in fact.   If this responsibility or burden of proof is shifted to a critic, the fallacy of appealing to ignorance is committed"

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,15weyu,takatori,8,Thu Jan 3 19:04:11 2013 UTC,"Actually, that part was just religious propaganda; the priests of Yahweh in the 7th century BCE had a very hard time competing with alternative worship shrines; By claiming that their god forbid to make images, they had the perfect excuse to destroy shrines and centralize worship in Jerusalem.  Hezekiah had tried to vanish images and other gods. He was successful, but tradition was too strong; his son Manasseh allowed alternative cult sites (mostly due to politics; trying to maintain the prohibition was bad for the economy). Two generations later, Josiah came to power and came up with the ""Discovering the book of the Law"" scheme.   By making the people feel guilty about betraying God and abandoning him for other gods and for ""idol making"", he was successful in destroying all the High Places and Asherah trees.  So, worship was centralized, and with this, Jerusalem gained more economic power. (Which didn't last long; a few decades later, Jerusalem fell to the the Babylonians, anyway)"

Example, my wife was (and still is) considering filing a discrimination complaint against her previous employer because they dropped her afternoon hours as a relief cleaner, citing the desire to hire man for security reasons. It was merely thinly veiled work politics - but never the less, the excuse was illegal.  We talked to her Job Placement Manager and she tried to blow it off as legit.  Her explanation included other example of a business that ran night time cashiers and how the company only hired men for that position because ""Men are more likely to stay calm if held up and not panic"" - which is total crap.  They put men in those night positions because women are perceived as easier targets, it has nothing to do with how they react under those circumstances. If anything, men are more likely to try to be a hero.  The actual psychological differences between men and women in the practical world of employment are minimal.

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,14d8qo,CroMag,1 point,Thu Dec 6 15:34:32 2012 UTC,"I always wondered why it is that the innocent party doesn't get to pick the days the guilty party is suspended for - especially since that would make suspensions something to truly be feared...since if you're suspended from school that day, you can't partake in any school-sponsored activities held on that day either.  This way a 3-day suspensions turns into the bully in question missing prom, being unable to play sports the day of the big playoff game, and miss whatever other big party the school's having.  All from one punishment."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,14d8qo,DoubleRaptor,-1,Thu Dec 6 18:34:43 2012 UTC,Wow! That sounds like a much better deterrent than not having to go to school for 3 arbitrary days. I like the way you think.

The image of a high schooler telling on somebody, then going to the internet to boast, is, well, perhaps its better if I don't describe it any further, but how does that sound to you?  Remember that movie where that guy was civil and told the authorities?"
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,14d8qo,graingert,7,Thu Dec 6 23:53:54 2012 UTC,"I don't believe there is a heroic thing to do in this sithation. The bully put the OP in a situation with pros and cons to each course of action, and the OP cjose the swiftest and most effective course of action with the least ramifications. You think anything other than going to a teacher and telling would've been more appropriate? Anything else would have put the kid, who was being bullied specifically because he was gay, right down to the level of the bully.  On top of that, he's mildly boasting about getting the kid suspended.. because the bully was a homophobic asshole that knocked his book in the mud.  This is really a non-issue anyway. OP posted a rage comic about something that happened in high school on the internet. Its over. Done."

CANON lI.-If any one saith, that, in the sacred and holy sacrament of the Eucharist, the substance of the bread and wine remains conjointly with the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, and denieth that wonderful and singular conversion of the whole substance of the bread into the Body, and of the whole substance of the wine into the Blood-the species Only of the bread and wine remaining-which conversion indeed the Catholic Church most aptly calls Transubstantiation; let him be anathema.  CANON IV.-If any one saith, that, after the consecration is completed, the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ are not in the admirable sacrament of the Eucharist, but (are there) only during the use, whilst it is being taken, and not either before or after; and that, in the hosts, or consecrated particles, which are reserved or which remain after communion, the true Body of the Lord remaineth not; let him be anathema.   It seems so clear written like that, and Martin Luther (who came before the above; the above is repudiation of his objections) objected on the grounds that it was obviously preposterous.  But yeah, supposedly this is all explained by the fact that the look and taste aren't what's real, something more ineffable is.  It's the worst kind of legalese wesel-wording."

This doesn't mean that you should believe in it, but it explains why the belief exists.  The short of it (for those that won't click through) was at the time the prevailing worldview was ""dualism"". That everything had both a ""real"" and ""physical"" nature. The ""real"" nature was what actually mattered, the physical mattered not at all. So the wine's ""real"" nature turned into Jesus' blood, it didn't matter that physically it was still wine. This is also why Jesus could be 100% human and 100% divine."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,130cjw,HarryLillis,3,Sun Nov 11 17:05:02 2012 UTC,"Nope, that's pretty much the long and short of it."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,130cjw,blazerz,3,Sun Nov 11 17:07:27 2012 UTC,"It's a reference to The Last Supper, a feast which was the last time Christ ate before he was crucified. It's assumed that being God he was aware of his coming end, so he gave special significance to the feast. He broke bread and poured wine saying something to the effect of, ""This is my body broken for you, this is my blood, spilled for you, do this in remembrance of me.""  This was considered to be a symbolism on Christ's part for his coming sacrifice, that they would break his body and spill his blood to atone for the sins of mankind. The Apostles sitting at the table couldn't have known specifically what Christ meant at the time. Judas and Thomas probably rolled their eyes at each other and shared the thought, ""Here's more of that voodoo mojo schtick.""  I don't know if it's clear that Christ implied that a ritual should be created from this act, but it's easy to assume that he did. However, Christ probably wasn't familiar with the writings of the Greeks because he spent his life in a particularly illiterate part of the Middle East and I don't know whether or not Paul spent any time lecturing Christ or if Paul had read the works of Aristotle.  This specific notion of the Catholic Church, that in performing this ritual there is a divine transubstantiation, is taken directly from the works of Aristotle. Every other Christian denomination assumes this is a symbolic practice and assume no divine intervention is taking place at a human controlled interval. However, the Catholic Church much further past the time of Christ decided that Aristotle's theories for reality were effective ways of explaining their view of reality. Interestingly in doing so they were actually looking for a scientific justification for religious belief, as that was the best science at the time. Now, once they decided that they had figured out that scientific justification they held onto it for another millenium past the time it was a viable idea and some parts of it are still believed, such as Aristotle's Substance Theory in the case of transubstantiation. In fact it wasn't until the 1980s that the Catholic Church decided to unban the work of Galileo and apologise for their crimes against him.  But yes, about Aristotle's idea itself, Substance Theory. It was his response to Plato's Theory of Forms, and must have seemed like a sensible improvement over the theory of forms at the time. So, what is being said when the Catholics adopt this idea is not that the bread and wine's physical matter literally change into human flesh and blood, as in fact the notion behind Substance theory is that physical matter is relatively unimportant. In Substance Theory all things are composed of a Substance and an Accident, the Substance being vaguely equivalent to an object's soul(very vaguely, I only use that word because of my inability to come up with a better one), while the Accident is the physical matter. So basically what is being said is that the bread and wine's heavenly essence is being transformed into the essence of Christ, although the physical matter remains the same.   If they were saying the physical matter actually changed, they'd call that transaccidentation rather than transubstantiation."

When someone dies, religion comforts you by telling you that the person went to a better place -- all the while telling you that you're much more likely to go to a terrible place unless you do everything you're told to do perfectly, so it's not particularly consistent!  When someone dies, the person stops existing.  That's it.  Hard to grasp, but that's what it is.  A person is like a wave in the ocean.  When the person dies, it's like the wave breaking.  The wave's water doesn't disappear, but the wave does.  It doesn't go anywhere.  It just stops existing.  This may not be a very comforting thought, but it's what happens.  So where does a person go when they die?  When a person dies, the person stops going.  But good luck trying to explain that to a person who isn't interested in thinking."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,12b781,cypressgreen,8,Thu Apr 18 16:23:45 2013 UTC,"I struggled with this myself. My little sister died in a car accident almost 7 years ago now (fuck me, it's been that long...) She was almost 18 and she was the person I grew up with. Losing her was devastating for me, especially in the depths of my new found atheism.  I delivered her eulogy, devoid of any religious reference. I reminded my friends and family to be appreciative of the time we had gotten to spend with her. Keep that in your heart when you are sad and you miss your loved ones.  As for where she went, she never really went anywhere. I have begun to think of the universe and the earth as more of a total living organism and we are just its constituent parts. Imagine if the cells in your body could gain consciousness (that's how I think of it.)  When my sister died, the energy that held her together left her body to shoot infinitely across the universe. Or maybe it's hanging around earth.  Her body we laid in a cemetery in northern Louisiana where my grandfather and now uncle are also lain. One day my bones will be there as well with my mother's and my grandmother's and aunt's. Where is she? She is in the tree that grows over the bench where we visit her. She is in the grass that grows over her final resting place. She is soaring in the birds that ate the worms that ate her.  It's tough for me to write this, and I am tearing up to think of how much I miss her. But when people ask you where your loved ones ""have gone."" You can tell them ""She never left. She's still here in the earth and the trees of which she was always a part.""  The memory of your cousin will live on those who knew her, but she has just returned to the universe, no longer separated by individual consciousness. What a gift it is, but what relief to lay it down.  You can either be apart or a part, but not both."

We haven't figured out how everything fits together, but we do know certain specific sorts of damage, suggesting that at least certain parts of your mind map directly to your brain.  And certainly, consciousness can be affected by chemicals in your brain. A person can be rendered unconscious, or have their subjective experience significantly altered, by drugs.  Now, we don't know from a first-person perspective what will happen when we die. But we have enough evidence to make an educated guess. Not just that your consciousness will cease when your brain shuts off, but we can predict certain things that might happen while it shuts off, some of which line up neatly with near-death experiences.  So, generally, we have evidence that when you die, at least if you die slowly while conscious, you trip balls and then your conscious experience stops, and you no longer exist."

It is, as I said, educated guesses. Just because I haven't provided sources doesn't make it speculation.  Which point are you disputing?  You've made a general statement that we don't have much understanding of what consciousness is -- but we do know that changes to the physical (chemicals, brain damage) affects conscious experience, which suggests that consciousness is physical. Most attempts to describe a non-physical consciousness have a hard time dealing with these facts, and the more we learn about neurology, the more certain this seems.  I don't need to point to a specific chunk of your brain and say ""This is consciousness, and when it turns off, you're no longer conscious."" It may not be that localized anyway. It would be enough to say that consciousness is a function of your brain, a thing it does, so a dead brain is to consciousness as a thermited computer is to a running program."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,11h618,toggaf69,2,Mon Oct 15 01:52:41 2012 UTC,Nightfall in Middle-Earth. I think that would be thier most epic album. The whole lyrics are based on The Sillmarillion and it's a very well made album.

She started to believe in demons (and later revealed to a friend of mine that she thought she was one) which made me pissed and stressed me out. My stress led to a short temper, and that was a part of the reason for the breakup. My battle with religion became a personal one as opposed to an ideological one at that point.  So, when I clicked Judith, I had only heard the song once before, I wasn't that into APC.   You're such an inspiration for the ways That I'll never ever choose to be    Holy shit. We had both promised each other to stay sane and stay the same when we started dating, and now she had become what we had both hated. I was hooked instantly.   Fuck your God Your Lord and your Christ    Though she wasn't Christian, her dad tried to convert me by saying that my atheism is just youthful rebellion and the usual shit in that vein.   It's not like you killed someone It's not like you drove a hateful spear into his side    I felt like a wounded animal after that breakup.

This categorization of Satanism (which could be categorized in other ways, for example ""Traditional"" versus ""Modern""), is not necessarily adopted by Satanists themselves, who usually would not specify which type of Satanism they adhere to. Some Satanists believe in a god in the sense of a Prime Mover but, like Atheistic Satanists, do not worship it, due to the deist belief that a god plays no part in mortal lives.""  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanism more info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaVeyan_Satanism   You start with this which just borrows religious icons from Christianity and re-appropriates them, because many of their connotations from Christianity are ""useful"", then you take the christians whose panties seem to be in a perpetual knot, and distill that anger and confusion over a couple of generations and you end up with this.

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,10hzlu,owlesque5,5,Wed Sep 26 16:42:33 2012 UTC,"That's very similar to my experience. I still have depression whether I'm a Christian or an atheist, but it was a hell of a lot more miserable, dark, and confusing as a Christian. After all, if god controls everything, then god knows I'm depressed and isn't doing anything about it, which probably means that I'm not a good enough Christian to gain god's favor, which in turn means that I'm a shitty person, which makes the depression worse...et cetera. I used to have friends tell me that my depression would be ""cured"" if I would just ""give it up to Jesus"" or ""rely on the Lord"" or some such other horseshit.   As an atheist, I don't buy into any of that, which opens me up to things that make much more sense and aren't emotionally abusive. I have depression because my brain doesn't work right. Medicine helps that, as does therapy and my volunteer work with animals. I still have shitty days/weeks, and I have to be very diligent about my mental health upkeep, but it's a million times better than religion telling me that the god who gave me depression would cure it if I weren't so bad at worshiping him."

Lotan, the seven-headed serpent from the sea, was a minion of Yam, the god of sea and chaos. Baal defeated Lotan and later fought Yam.  Scholars say that the parts in the Bible where the seven-headed serpent was mentioned (Psalm 74, for example) are actually of Ugaritic origin, and the god's name was changed to Yahweh. When exactly the name of the serpent was changed to ""Leviathan"" is unclear.  After the exile from Babylon, apocalyptic writing became popular, and many old myths were incorporated in the sacred texts. It wasn't after Christianity that the serpent was striped from its mythological origin to be associated with Satan.  But there's an older tradition with a seven headed snake; The sumerian Epic of Ninurta mentions a seven headed serpent, among other monsters that Ninurta had defeated.  Anyway, if you really want to read awesome stories regarding monsters and heroes, I really recommend you the Epic of Gilgamesh.  EDIT: More details."

You say people are not that observant yet how difficult is it to see two books saying ""Biology"" and ""Evolution"" from (my observation) of the comic it seems op is standing relatively close proximety to the person (since the guy pulled the book out and in arms length). Knowing that if the guy was sitting, he may be eye level to the books. In that case you really don't have to be that observant.        1.) If people are not that observant then we probably would have never left the prolithic age, they seemed to have observed that settling down, and planting crops was better then moving constantly with the animals. aka brings us into the neolithic age. I could give more examples, but this one seems more than enough  B.) ""He would have still tried to proselytize anyways"" this statement could be true, although         1.) OP never stated where he/she was located (Im guessing he, because through my observation of the comic it looks like a he). If it was in the bible belt of America a person may try anyway, although...        2.) Another reason your statement can be wrong is that what if a similar experience happend to the guy in the same day. He may have just given up trying to force it when op came, and saw his books.  C.) ""He probably just had to sneeze"" well that seems like an observation, and from your first point ""People aren't that observant"" you kinda just contradicted yourself their.  So my final verdict, it could have happend using observation, but also a sense of humor helps. Also using OP's name... You're probably wrong."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,1036oi,Simba7,-1,Wed Sep 19 16:27:40 2012 UTC,"You don't understand what 'observant' means. Observant, in this instance, refers to noting two don't details that were unrelated to the guy handing out bibles. Were he asking, he would try to make eye contact, or at least look at the face. The supposition here, then, is that the new testament guy took all the info in at a casual glance, and took a second to process all the information. (A remarkable feat veeeeery few people are capable of. Look up 'encoding' as it pertains to psychology for more info.) I suppose it might have been better to say ""People aren't that observant unless there is a reason to be.""  Top this with the fact that most Christians (yes, even many here in Texas) aren't in denial of scientific evidence, coupled with the fact that these people were handing out NEW Testament bibles indicates very strongly that they are not young earth creationists. A belief in intelligent design does not exclude an old earth nor evolution. I suppose you could argue it is against 'natural selection', since it would have been divinely guided selection or something, but that doesn't really matter here.  Third, it's a college campus. I'd think even the more religious students would understand that biology is a required course for all 4 year degree programs. (Might not apply everywhere, but it does for Texas.)  With this info, I can say with relative confidence that there was almost definitely a different reason for bible guy's reaction that simple textbooks.

Yes eye contact needs to be established, although noting that OP had been walking in the general area of the two men. Its likely that eye contact could have been established before. He may have had the book ready to hand out, although humans have a tendency to be curious, he may have wanted to see what OP was holding. We are uncertain (maybe even OP) whether the bible guy had been discourged or not, the evidence is not there. We can only make assumptions. (Im no fool to a psychological perspective, the encoding process could have been put into short term memory and decoded  relatively quick, since the information noted really wouldn't need to be stored into long term.)   Using Texas has an example, the majority may have an understanding of scientific evidence, but you still have radical believers. Sure the new testament bibles leave out certain details, but if the person handing them out felt a sort of ""learned helplessness"" from a similar situation then he may have not wanted to even try giving it to op.   I understand that even religious students need bilogy in a 4 year degree program, but it doesn't necessarily mean they agree with it.  The information you gave is logical I will give you that, but it is questionable. We where not there to see the situation, we can only give reasons for or against it. The way I see it you have to take it with a grain of salt, it is after all a comic, they are meant to be funny.

After listening to several hours of Alan Watts, however, I will say that the philosophy surrounding reincarnation is far more appealing than any other theistic philosophy regarding the existence of life after death.  It's a belief that I can get behind, because ultimately there is no such thing as an experience of no experience.  So if I'm wrong, and I simply cease to exist after death, what have I lost?  Nonexistence isn't being locked in some dark hole for an eternity -- it isn't anything.

I agree whole heartedly with this sentiment, but I don't think that I should choose my beliefs upon how appealing they are either. I do agree with what you say about non-existence. Obviously the lack of existence is not something one can experience.    So if I'm wrong, and I simply cease to exist after death, what have I lost?

In a belief system where you reincarnate into some different form or as some animal depending on your behavior in life, it really doesn't make sense.  But in a system where a human's consciousness is released upon death, and then somehow incorporates itself into a NEW (not jumping into a pre-existing) consciousness, that can almost be believable.  We don't really know what bits make up  a ""conciousness."" They just seem to be a product of binary synapses.  Now, I've been playing devil's advocate here, but honestly, you can't say there isn't the possibility of consciousnesses being made up of some sort of physical... things. or a series of things. In which case, there could be something in place in this universe that would resemble a form of reincarnation.  I'm just saying, it's fine to not believe in any religion, but to discredit everything someone says out of hand just for the sake of being a religious person is just silly.

We can destroy parts of the brain and still function, but all the charactoristics of personality change dramatically. We can mess with hormones, and increase or decrease trust, irritability, and so forth.  I suppose there could be some sort of consciousness that has no personality, no memory, and no decision making capability, but I'm not sure what charactoristics it would still have to justify ""consciousness"" as a describing word.  Ninjaedit: I'm not discrediting anything because it's religious btw. I have no problem with crazy ideas once in a while either, but they should be recognized as religion and crazy ideas, not as a fact.

If you were to have labeled the Muslim as a fundamentalist, I might not have disagreed, but, with the overall title of Muslim, I have to say that the description is extremely inappropriate and biased. The Scientology guy? Spot on. Moving on. The Christian one is again subjective. It solely depends on the Christian. Fundamentalists would make this statement while others would never say such things. From my understanding, the Buddhist statement is a rough quotation of a Buddhist leader of only one sect of Buddhism. As such, this view does not necessarily apply to every Buddhist or Buddhism as a whole. If anything, this is only the most liberal of Buddhist beliefs and does not account for Buddhist fundamentalists/conservatives/traditionalists."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,zotm2,ShamanChemistry,1 point,Tue Sep 11 08:41:58 2012 UTC,"No creator God, so less of a conflict with rational thinking. While it does have many Gods, the term is meant differently. It would translate better as ""beings who exist in other dimensions where the laws of physics are different"" than gods per se.        In addition it is generally less dogmatic. One of the sayings of Zen Buddhism goes ""if you see the Buddha in your path, kill him."" This is thought to mean that if Buddhism isn't helping you, you should just dump it, which is a very enlightened outlook when compared to the Abrahamic religions; less constrictive, more compatible with freedom. Not only this, but  one of the main goals of Buddhism is to pursue wisdom, which is essentially the polar opposite of the main goal of the Abrahamic religions.      People tend to forget that Buddhism encourages parasitism (monks and serious Buddhists are encouraged to live without working, begging for charity in order to pursue their self-centred desire to escape from reality) and that believing in all sorts of mumbo-jumbo without evidence weakens the mind and makes one susceptible to other myths. I would bet good money that people who ""believe in"" reincarnation are more likely to believe that vaccines are an illuminati plot to give us all autism and that vibrating stones can cure cancer or whatever.

I'm not speaking for all Catholics, but the Catholic church itself stated that, quite clearly. The only reason that they still believe in creationism is because evolution is only a theory and can't be proved. In fact, there are a lot of Christians that believe that Creationism and evolution aren't mutually exclusive, like my parents, who believe that their god set evolution in motion. Also, the whole thing about Christians believing that the universe is only 6000 years old is a very small minority. My parents, and my theist friends all think that's bullshit. Lastly, not all theistic people hate atheists. I get along with a lot of theists. Don't stoop to the levels of bad people.

Or maybe a ghost story to boy scout's on a camping trip.  Back in college I had one professor who was nuts. He had lost all his marbles over the preceding decade, but before that he was a shining genius. So most of the class time was fluff (and he stank a bit), but I was determined to listen anyway and make the best out of it.

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,z8lv0,CommunistWitchDr,5,Mon Sep 3 01:57:28 2012 UTC,"THIS IS OP WITH A SPECIAL EDIT  First off, I noticed that a lot of people here are complaining about how hostile and rude I was to the man who was preaching at the bus terminal.  I would like to address that so people can understand a few things.  Though I recognize the fact that it is the objective of many for us to have positive atheism in our communities, I have to admit that in some cases our deeper, negative, feelings will come up and taint our actions.  That was the case for me here.  Yes I could have handled it better, yes I could have done this in a way that didn't make the street preacher feel like such a loser, but NO I do not regret my actions.  I cannot hide the fact that religious people like him have made life difficult for people like me.  I have been harassed by overly zealous religious people who know I'm an atheist, and I have to take very drastic measures to safeguard my kids from people proselytizing to them without my knowledge.  I know that in my case my experience does not compare to what people in other regions of the US have experienced, but I am justified in my feelings the same as anyone else.  Calling the man an idiot was probably immature, that I will concede, but only that.    I am in the category of anti-theist, and if someone pushes their religion into my life in any way, even just preaching openly in the street, I will push back.  I am prepared to stand up for myself, and in all truth I did not go into this situation looking to make a friend.  I knew he would never accept any good reason for me diverting his attention and I accepted that from the start.  I've looked back on my conduct and will change nothing about what I did, even calling him an idiot despite my mild regrets.  All are welcome to open discourse about how they would have handled it, perhaps a practice for this kind of thing that saves face for all can be developed.  That does not change the fact that what is done is done, and though we all want a much warmer friendlier exchange in the future the fact is that not all will be.  Thanks for reading wonderweirdo"

Rather than be civil about explaining himself, he says shit like ""I just wanted to waste your time,"" and, ""you look like an idiot.""  The rest of what he said consisted of some quite good points, but rather than try to get a message across to this evangelist who might not even realize he's being rude, OP has thrown in some personal attacks that will just make the evangelist angry and ignore any otherwise good points."

He has one thing that makes him happier than anything else in the world, and he wants to share it with everyone.  He's not Peter Popoff shilling his religion for millions of dollars. He's not the Pope relocating pedophile priests and blaming their victims. He's not some African warlord committing genocide and rape in the name of his faith. No, he's trying to give the most important thing in his life to others. So what good does it do to attack him?  It's great that the OP gave up his own comfort to spare his bus stop companions an awkward sermon, and I don't mind that at all. But calling the evangelist an idiot afterward and bragging about wasting his time is not useful to anyone.  Maybe it makes for a great ragecomic, but it won't do anything to decrease the evangelist's resolve. It certainly won't give them a friendly perspective on atheism."

They definitely had some rough times over this and other issues, but they just celebrated their 40th and are adorable in looooove. My mom has become less religious since we kids moved out -- she now believes that Jesus was a nice guy, but not divine. I think when we were growing up she was truly scared of the devil hurting her babies. Not rational, but understandable considering how she was raised.   But 8 or 9 years ago when the Catholic church defended child molesting priests she flipped out. It was amazing. Right after that someone tried to tell her that her grandchildren were going to hell because they weren't baptized and something in her sprang loose. Her exact words were ""That is BULLSHIT.""   Any religion that would send her beautiful and perfect grandbabies to eternal hell could fuck right off. It was beautiful.  At this point she's agnostic, with a little bit of hispanic superstition thrown in. As long as my dad chills out with the Jesus on a popsicle stick type of jokes, she is okay with his militant atheism."

My choices are now:  1. I could believe them (believe in science) and chalk it up to some unexplained force 2. I can go on to disprove their hypotheses using my experimental results.

Ultimately, what is found is facts, data, evidence, and the knowledge of subjects that have been researched and observed thoroughly, analyzed, and tested time and time again to result in something that is accepted by the scientific community as truth. You just cannot believe in science. Science is science. Whether you believe in it or not, factual evidence in science will hold true. The same issue comes up when people ask me (I am from the South, so the tone here is quite clear), ""You actually BELIEVE in evolution?""

Before Jesus, Jews and gentiles didn't have the ability to reach salvation, having only ""an imperfect understanding of the Law.""   God had to find some way to transmit his law to the people without having some human intermediary fuck it up. Simultaneously he had to find a way to rectify the fact that everyone who died with that imperfect understanding automatically went to hell.  So he sent Jesus down. Jesus had two jobs: one, explain the new version, Torah 2.0 to people on earf.  Secondly, Jesus had to die and go to hell so that he could bust all those motherfuckers out and take em to heaven. (see ""harrowing of hell."")  So that's what he did. After bustin them out, he hung around for a while just to prove to the haters that he was legit, then he went up to heaven.   Oh, and then apparently took the time to explain everything to Paul so that he could be the final authority on being a pain in the ass 100 years later.  Makes perfect sense...  Haha just kidding."

They need something to believe in but don't want to believe in God, so they ""believe in science"" which makes no sense as a statement anyway.   If you don't believe in God just leave it at that. Science is true whether you believe in it or not and it's not anti-religion. ""believing in science"" rather than God is like saying you believe in fruits but not cellphones.

In fact, it was by thinking about other beliefs (specifically more ""eastern"" beliefs about reincarnation) that I really began having doubts about the veracity of the Christian narrative I was raised on - why would God condemn billions of people to hell just because they weren't raised as Christians, and why do they have such different beliefs anyway?"

Should the non-religious parent just go along with it and then when the kid's 13 or so, break it to him that they were lying all along so as not to make the other parent mad or introduce inconsistencies?  The fact that they are impressionable is why it's cool for them to get two (or more) sides at the same time, kind of like learning two languages at the same time. The earlier you get multiple perspectives, the better equipped you are at dealing with differing ideas than if you were brought up with only one viewpoint for 13 years and then learning there is more to life than that."

In his defense, he mainly supported it for my mother. I think it's good to at least be exposed to both sides though. My parents: A good example of how the religious and non-religious can live together.   This, to me, is an example of a compromise parents shouldn't need to make. A respectful religious parent shouldn't be against refraining from exposing an impressionable child to religion, a concept a child is ill-equipped to consume objectively and fairly. More impressionable means more credulous and by the time the child is an adult, it'll likely have a religious conviction based only in that childish credulity. The respectful religious parent should respect their child's autonomy to wait till a time the child isn't so unable to think critically.  Unless the child's parents actually believe in two different religions, the child is going to get special preference for one religion because it'll be exposed and re-exposed to that religion for years. That's not fair to the child. It's not fair even if you try to teach the child about other world religions because it's not the same experience as being immersed like the child is going to church with its religious parent.  Having to teach multiple world religions to your child isn't really an 'other side' because it's not the same. It's a 'better than nothing' response (apart from the fact that a child should learn about world religions anyway) to counter the child being immersed in something he or she is not equipped to deal with. Ideally there should be no immersion until the child can be more objective.  And it doesn't compare to learning secondary languages."

I would've said the same thing your wife would have, and I agree that it doesn't really answer the entire question, so I would've tried to elaborate on what a god is, or what some people think their god does/is responsible for.  But I can't imagine how difficult it must be to explain something like that to a five year old.    You also said your daughter came to the conclusion on her own that fairies are imaginary, and you likened gods to fairies, which I think is giving her too much of a biased opinion to begin with.  I like to think that if I ever have a kid I'll try to let her decide on her own what to believe, and if something like this ever comes up, as much as I might want to say, ""Daddy and mommy, for instance, don't believe gods are real"", I think I might leave that out until she's had some time to think about it.  But like I said, I don't have a kid, so really what the hell do I know?  And from your other comments it sounds like your kid is already on the right track to being a great independent thinker."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,y2pg4,AmadeusMop,2,Mon Aug 13 17:49:31 2012 UTC,"What documentary were you watching?   I don't recall the title (and can't find it in my history), but it was supposed to be about the history of religion, yet focused exclusively on the Abrahamic faiths, and wasn't very good even at that imo. Presented much of the Old Testament as fact, didn't provide much evidence for the claims it did make, and kind of pretended like no other religions existed. (Claimed monotheism was invented by the Biblical patriarchs, for example.)"
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,y2pg4,AmadeusMop,1 point,Mon Aug 13 19:44:38 2012 UTC,"Thx. I hear you about poisoning the well, so to speak, by comparing gods to fairies (which I already knew my daughter to believe were imaginary).  It is an interesting question though, because kids (mine, at least) are asking ""is it real?"" constantly. Are monsters real? Are unicorns real? Are pegasi real? Is the Easter Bunny real? Are angels real? Is God real?  I'd imagine most parents tell their children, ""Monsters aren't real (though there are some really amazing real creatures throughout the world)"". Nobody's saying, ""Well, there's no evidence to support any type of scary monster living under your bed."" But from monsters to mythical creatures to the supernatural to God… should the answers change? Should the approach change?  My daughter was asking my mother those questions (fairies, monsters, unicorns, etc.) and asked, ""Are angels real?"" My mom (agnostic semi-Christian), who'd previously been answering, ""No dear, those aren't real,"" switched to, ""Well… some people thing angels are real."" To which my daughter responded, ""I don't think angels are real."" No coaching or anything, but to think about it from her perspective, angels are cartoony things you see during holidays or tv shows full of other clearly imaginary stuff.  Anyway, interesting to think about the supernatural from the perspective of a child brought up on nature documentaries with non-religious parents.  Also fwiw, my daughters know what a hypothesis is (""An idea you can test"", thank you Dinosaur Train). It's super cute to hear them explain what a hypothesis is."

But from monsters to mythical creatures to the supernatural to God… should the answers change? Should the approach change?   Good point.  That's something I never really thought of, but it's probably something simple enough that I should have.  I guess the approach does change, whether it should or not.  When you answer questions about monsters being real, you're saying ""some things are and some things are not"", but when you're talking about God, I guess it turns into a much larger topic that includes things like why humans interact with each other the way we do and how to treat people who live their lives differently than you do.  Or it could turn into that.  I'm going to check out Dinosaur Train later though. :)"
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,y2pg4,gnualmafuerte,4,Mon Aug 13 21:02:20 2012 UTC,"You told her that they were imaginary, then were pround that she agreed. Sorry, but I think your explanation was rather biased and, to be honest, you sound rather like those fundies that try to force religion on their children. We call ourselves free thinkers. Start teaching your daughters to think for themselves, not jist repeat what you say.  </rant>  Again, sorry about that."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,y2pg4,AmadeusMop,4,Sun Aug 12 22:18:09 2012 UTC,"First off, I didn't say they were imaginary. She came to that conclusion on her own, just like she came to the conclusion that fairies were imaginary, on her own. (Though she did go through a funny period when she thought fairies were once real but went extinct before the dinosaurs. After explaining that we had no fossil evidence to suggest they were ever real (and she has her own fossils), she came to her own conclusion.)  Generally we do answer her questions with questions, but in this situation she was asking for a definition. I'm honestly not sure how to explain what a god is to a 5yr old who has never been exposed to the concept.  How would you explain it, in terms a 5yr old would readily understand? I'm genuinely interested.  As far as ""rather biased"", the ""really angry with people"" certainly isn't how most believers would describe their gods. But:   We were watching a documentary about the history of Abrahamic faiths, and to claim that that god unconditionally loved anything makes me think you're not reading the same text as I; and I did say ""usually"". Maybe ""sometimes"" would have been better, but that seems just as disingenuous, as it'd require further explanation imo:  ""Normally people believe their own god (which they think is the only god that actually exists) really really loves them even more than I love you! But sometimes they believe that he sends people that don't believe in him to a place called 'hell' where they're tortured forever and ever.""   Edit: Formatting"

To be fair to the atheists, though, they're not the only group to ignore what we learned from the actions of the character, Jesus.

Not the least of which is 'god hates everyone but us', that's generally involved in every single cult. It's very easy to start a cult on the Bible -- Levi Lestadius, Joseph Smith, Jim Jones etc, the list goes on -- as it's based on the Judaic tradition which had a very strong sense of 'us vs them.' Quite understandable, really, since all the tribes they would encounter would have multiple gods, so theirs had to be stronger and have rules for everyone else and very strong rules for keeping the tribe together, strong and outside influences... outside.  Documentaries? I don't buy that. Really, all you need is to go out, point at something, decide you don't like it and get a soapbox. If you're a good enough talker you'll get followers. If you're really good they'll give you money for the simple joy of belonging in something greater than themselves.  Most folk just want to get through life without fuss, really. So they latch on to pretty much the first thing that sounds good. Every lie drags them deeper as they also never understand or want to understand how easily they can be led and lied to.

I assure you this is not the case. Pause for a moment and consider the implications of ancient desert dwelling people having any concept of what a light-year is, or why it should be spectacular that we can see the light of stars.  The premise is absurd.  I don't know the origins of this particular misconception that your father holds, but I can tell you it must be of relatively recent origin, and that it is not something widely believed by most Christians.  In all likelihood this idea is some sort of post-hoc rationalization for why we can see the light of stars many millions of lightyears away in light of cosmology's discoveries, in the 20th century of just how amazingly vast the universe is, and as a way of reconciling that fact with the creationist beleif that the earth, and indeed the universe itself are no more than 6000-10,000 years old."

If anything, the one thing I got the most backlash for was me saying that instead of going out and hating people, keep religion in closets and actually go out and read the constitution which they think backs them up as far as politics go. The whole 'Keep God in this country and it is going to get better but with athiests (they misspell that a lot) the whole country is going to hell'. I even cited some bits for their convenience, but I got a lot of ""never gonna read"", ""wordswordswords"", etc.. It's THAT kind of apathy that damns a country, not people who are actually doing something. Telling or asking them to read up on their facts is pretty difficult.

God does not exist separate from any part of the universe. There is no God sitting around hoping people believe in him and creating miracles when he so chooses. 'God', as I understand it, is all that is and isn't, was and wasn't, will and will not be. God is a 'real abstraction', the largest Fetish around. A Fetish that, when believed in truly, re-enchants the world with the magic Newton accidentally drained from it.  Of course my friends, my belongings, my country, my planet, my self, my beliefs are not a Bearded White Man. But if I believe that each and everyone of them is imbued with the Spirit of the Divine, then I find I can approach each day, no matter how challenging, with the Will of a Templar, the Love of a Saint, and the Generosity of Santa Claus.   and this video presents a really interesting idea of what god could be, a 7th dimensional being.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FWRndF01xI  happy hunting!"

There would simply be too much for us to understand. We could only understand small pieces of the infinitely greater whole. Viewed under that assumption, it does not seem at all strange that every person would have their own unique view of what God actually is.  Of course, then you have to explain why you're assuming that there's an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent being in existence, which would be another discussion entirely. I'm just saying, I don't find this to be a significant flaw in religious thought, in and of itself."

How does that make any more sense?  I just think a god would have a consistent angle, message, viewpoint. Some believers say He's against homosexuality and that it's unnatural, because God told them that, and they read it in the bible. Some say hate the sin not the sinner, and that homosexuality, probably, maybe, sorta isn't right, but it's forgivable. Other people say that it's irrelevant to God what your sexual preference is.  Why would god give mixed messages like that? You could say, well some are misinterpreting it, or interpreting it in their own way, but what is GOD's original intent and sentiment? Nobody seems to agree on that, which is why there are so many denominations.  You make a good point that it doesn't completely defeat religious thought by itself, but it is enough to create questions, and challenges."

Atheist: I don't believe in the teachings of the Bible.  I consider many  things written in the Bible to be factually and morally wrong.  Xtian: But that means that you're sinning.  Atheist:  I don't believe in sin, so saying that I'm not obeying the Bible would be like if I said you weren't obeying the Koran.  Xtian: But the Koran is wrong, so I don't believe in it.  Atheist: But that's exactly my point.  You don't believe in the Koran, so you don't care if you disobey it.  I don't believe in the Bible, so I don't care if I disobey it.

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,x40ez,Thunder_child0,3,Wed Jul 25 14:24:33 2012 UTC,"Now, I'm a pretty devout anti-theist, so in NO WAY am I defending religion - BUT:  A) Yes, the movies exist, in just the same way as the bible exists - But don't forget that Batman and his Rogues Gallery are just as fictional as Adam and Eve, my friend, even if we find them more appealing. B) Nolanites are INCREDIBLY devout - please visit one of the numerous forums online and read their responses which are unlike any other group of movie fans - Yes, Twihards are pretty devout but nowhere as belligerent. It's not a terribly far stretch to compare their emotional responses to those of religious zealots.  C) Completely debatable. I could go on for hours about all the things I can't stand about Nolan's movies. I don't think he's a write off, but I find his work to be HIGHLY overrated. I absolutely respect someones opinion to feel otherwise - that's a great thing about art, it's ability to inspire dissenting opinions, but people should always remember to respect people's rights to have a dissenting artistic opinion and shouldn't make people feel like idiots for having one.  D) You're right, they don't start wars in the classic definition, but they've inspired people to commit a war of words with people who disagree with them (no, not all of them, just the crazies - but that's the same with religion) but it's hard to deny that TDK didn't play a part in inspiring the actions of James Holmes. What were the first words he said when they caught him in his car? ""I'm the Joker."" That's Ledger's Joker, I'm pretty sure, not Jack Nicholson's. I'm sure this comment will spark a fury, because people don't want to hear it, but there is some truth in it - at least there was in Holmes' twisted mind. Now, in no way do I mean to imply that art should be banned because it happens to inspire crazies to commit horrible acts, (that would be an interpretation devoid of objective ambivalence) but that doesn't mean we can't admit that it happened - the same way that Taxi Driver inspired Hinckley to attempt to assassinate Reagan for Jodie Foster, and Catcher in the Rye played a part in inspiring Mark David Chapman to kill John Lennon.  Is the comparison between religious zealots and Nolanites on equal footing? Absolutely not. Are there some eerie similarities? I sure think so. This comic is just meant to show that it doesn't just take religion for people to act ""religiously."""
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,x40ez,Thunder_child0,3,Wed Jul 25 15:30:04 2012 UTC,"Firstly, I just wanted to say I was unaware that there were people who were that serious and crazy to be completely devoted to the Nolan movies. I myself think that they are the best to come of the Dc movies. I thought that the comic was to show that religious people and people we would consider completely and utterly insane and devoted to something entirely unrealistic. My point was that the religious person was actually worse than the Nolan fanatic. I agree that this comic intended to show that the craziest people in the movie world are less crazy than religious people.  In short, I am thankful to get a comment this in depth. Have an upvote. My comment was only there to solidify the point that I though the comic was there for. I thought that the comic was showing that the crazy people were less crazy than religious people.  Thank you for the response, and I hope that you have a good day."

We praise God to be all loving, but then condemn gays to hell and hate them? It's the thing that grinds my gears. Also, when people are hypocrites at church. They act all saint and nice, yet you see them in parties getting drunk, dressing slutty, premarital sex, try drugs, etc. the way I see it, is that God loves anyone, as long as they are kindhearted and lived a good life, and no, I don't think he is a guy in a white beard stalking us, though one could never know. The whole religion subject is complicated. but I enjoy my religion because it makes me feel whole. And it really pisses me off when people who claim to be Christian do this on this comic.

God's actions cannot be forced, so his actions are necessarily voluntary. Voluntarily acting with foreknowledge of the consequences are the basic requirements for culpability.  If god is culpable, he is malicious, which contradicts divine omnibenevolence.  Further, a god that doesn't act at all is not a god, and a god whose actions are not voluntary is not a god. So the only options available if we are to blame for human suffering, and god exists, is that he is not omniscient.  This area of reasoning is called theodicy.  It's pretty much settled - the consequences of all of the available variables having been thoroughly explored.  Ploughing its avenues is one of the more cerebral ways to lose faith in gods.

I don't care if it's called AD because that's what it's been called forever and to change it is just as silly as the idea that atheists should use a different calendar because we don't believe in god.

Or maybe it was Dedekind.  One of those late 19th century guys. ;p  I have to say, though.  As an atheist, this quote still rings true, even interpreting ""God"" as a personification of the universe.  The integers -- the natural numbers, anyway -- are such general abstractions that they're on a different level from everything else.  If you're going to claim God did anything, it should be the integers.  Even the laws of the universe are subordinate to this."

I don't really see why humans would be incapable of coming up with numbers.  ""Records 4,000 years old show that Babylonians looked at the properties of positive integers (now thought of as 'pure' arithmetic). Diophantus of Alexandria, Greece, revised the system of algebra first developed by the Babylonians. Under the Diophantine method of analysis that evolved around A.D. 250, equations were solved with integers. The problems could involve single equations or systems of equations containing two or more unknowns, but the solutions were always whole numbers""  Taken from: http://www.bookrags.com/research/integers-wom/"
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,wsf0r,droxpopuli,3,Thu Jul 19 04:47:33 2012 UTC,"No, that's not what I (nor Kronecker) meant.  The natural numbers are a foundational part of reality.  Humans came up with a system for labeling them, with the Babylonians presenting one such system (in base 60 because they were weird), but the numbers themselves are more fundamental than even the universe we live in.  It's conceivable for a universe to exist where the physical laws are different -- alpha = 1/136 instead of 1/137, gravity is stronger, the strong nuclear force doesn't exist, there is an extra spatial dimension, whatever -- but it is not conceivable for a universe to exist where the natural numbers don't behave in exactly the same way.  Numbers stand outside of time and space.  9 will follow 8 no matter what you call them.  Humans did not come up with numbers.  Hell, humans didn't even come up with counting; animals have been counting things long before humans even showed up.  Humans only came up with systems for organizing the numbers."

Eventually, they came upon the only vacant place around, a manger. Joseph said that it would have to do, but Mary would have none of it. She saw the animals around, the sheep poop and horse shit, and determined it was too filthy to give birth to her child (not Joseph's mind you, he was just being good guy Joseph so that Mary wouldn't be stoned for having a child out of wedlock). Mary threw a fit.  Now for the miracle deus ex machina: Three wise men showed up, flashed their health inspector badges, and declared the manger to be of sufficient sanitation to be acceptable for delivering a child. Just in time, as Jesus crowned (in terms of childbirth, not because he was some sort of king) and Mary wrapped him in swaddling clothes while a bunch of shepherds had gathered around staring in disgust at all the blood and placenta scattered over the hay-lined dirt floor."

The following options could explain a non-miraculous burning bush:  a) The legend evolved over the 1000 years before the first written record of it  b) Somebody just made it up during the 1000 year period  c) An oral legend managed to preserve the story for 1000 years - but the fire caused Moses to hallucinate  I really don't understand how rational people who don't believe in miracles would think c) is the most likely explanation. Memory is a tricky thing - for example Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Benjamin Franklin all believed they themselves signed the declaration of independence on the 4th of July. An argument a fortiori suggests that people will definitely mess up a legend over thousands of years - it would be a 'miracle' in itself if Moses existed and the memory of the bush was true and the reason behind it all was the hallucinogenic aspect of the fire.  That said, I guess the motivation for people to believe in this stuff is because it would depress them to think that the whole Bible is made up - they want to believe it happened in some way, even if it wasn't 'miraculous'."

You won't find many 'hard' or gnostic atheists on here - that's what you seem to be talking about.   However, being one infinitesimally small step away from being a hard atheist is immensely more defensible than the equivalent on the theist side, and you'll find plenty of those people in here (I'd probably consider myself such).  The stance is something like this: I believe there is no god, but I realise I cannot know there is no god, at least at this stage of scientific knowledge. With the way gods are normally presented/proposed, they are at least almost outside the realm of knowable things. I believe there almost definitely can't be a god. There is no way to prove there is no god, but there's a fair bit of evidence of absence going on. However, if hard evidence were to appear that would prove the existence of a god, I would be willing to change my beliefs.   Note also that this is very very different to just changing beliefs because you've found out there's a powerful being's wrath at stake; for example if I were to find out the Christian god existed in the form the bible teaches and a lot of Christians believe, I would almost certainly have quite a beef with him/her/it/?, which is far from worshipping him, but is would still entail believing in their existence."

With the spread of freethought, skeptical inquiry, and subsequent increase in criticism of religion, application of the term narrowed in scope. The first individuals to identify themselves using the word ""atheist"" lived in the 18th century.[10] - wikipedia  Also, from the greek theos, which is belief in god. And the prefix 'a-', which is translated as 'a lack of', more of less. Thus, a lack of belief in god.  Gnosticism is the idea that we can know if god exists. Same thing, lack of belief that we can know if god exists due to the prefix.  Lacking belief is not the same thing as believing in the lack of. You're wrong, and an idiot."

If the invented idea was at least tied to the proven laws of nature, then its existence would be a tiny bit more probable. But until proven, it's safer to say it doesn't exist."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,v4okz,ctrl_all_del,2,Sat Jun 16 17:54:32 2012 UTC,"Very true, and most agnostics would agree that yes, since there has been no evidence in any way that a god exists, then it's safe to assume that no god exists. But an agnostic accepts the fact that it can't be proven that a god doesn't exist. Therefore you cannot say you know god doesn't exist, only that it's much more likely than the idea that a god does exist."

Yes, you're an atheist, but since agnostic refers to whether or not you can know if there is a god, rather than whether or not you believe in one, you can actually be both. In this case, you've said you don't believe in a god. You've also said that you would believe in a god given the right evidence, implying that you cannot say with certainty ""I know for sure, without any doubt, that there are no gods."" Since you can't say that, you join 99.999% of /r/atheism as an agnostic atheist."

If I was assigning an actual probability to it, I would say that either gods don't exist, or gods have no way to affect anything we can perceive and their existence has absolutely no bearing on anything.

I've been mostly pointing out to the haters with nothing more to say than 'it's bullshit' that the comic is really not going all that far. I don't think the comic was necessarily suggesting that believing in the holy ghost is mentally ill, its just that if you replace those words with 'mental illness', the sentence still makes sense in a humorous way.  Anyway, to more directly address your post, sure, not all people use absolute logic for everything, but for people in situations where it becomes clear their stance is not possibly true, for them to ignore that just because it doesn't make them feel good I would argue is a very mild mental illness because it leads them to a skewed/false world view which can have real impact on their life - i.e. it isn't sane. It would be enough for them to realise they have to be wrong, without necessarily putting any effort into finding out why, for them to earn a badge of sanity from me.  It's a similar thing to how people which a marginally-below-the-accepted-threshold of IQ are considered to have a mental illness of sorts. It doesn't necessarily mean they're bad people and IQ isn't everything, but it's the same kind of thing.  Anyway, I don't mean to say you should go around calling people retarded for things like this, that would be just silly."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,uv90q,Chrisi44,2,Wed Jun 13 01:36:05 2012 UTC,"I can see your point about the thought process you describe can be argued for as a very mild mental disease. However, I really doubt that many Christians think this way. Sure I did, back when I was following Christ, but I was never a very devout theist.   My point is, I think a lot of religious people have never seen anything or tried anything beside their usual religious way of thinking. And this include using circle arguments such as ""Jesus exists - he was the son of God. God exists, because it says so in the bible. The bible is true, because it is the word of God."" Of course this does not make sense to us, as enlightened as we are, but it makes sense for them. I wouldn't call this a mental disease, rather just screwed logic. Comparing this to real mental disorders, let's say OCD or depression, really isn't quite fair. Logic just isn't everything for everyone in this world.  And secondly, I don't think ""marginally-below-the-accepted-threshold of IQ"" is a mental disorder. This might be some kind of cultural difference, but in my book stupidity isn't equal mentally ill. Unless you talk of IQ like Forrest Gump, which I think many would consider some sort of mental illness as he has trouble communicating with others. But that isn't just marginally below in my opinion."

It becomes a disease or illness or problem in my mind when it negatively impacts the life of the person or their peers. But we're just arguing semantics at this point.  Logic isn't everything for everyone, but it shouldn't be discounted or ignored by anyone. In my opinion and experience, if you think logic doesn't apply in a situation, it's probably just because it's difficult to see how, or there simply is not enough information for logic to be useful.   Regarding the IQ thing, I'm pretty sure that certain countries have lower bound IQ limits for the degree of punishment due for crimes, like I heard that somewhere in the US I think, you can't be sentenced to death if you have an IQ below 70. I imagine this sort of puts somewhat of a definition of when just lower than average mental capacity turns into an actual disorder, and I imagine some of the upper end of those people can handle most simple logical constructs."

Although I'd still like to say that religious people enjoy believing in their religion and experience it gives them a lot spiritually. A depressed man does not enjoy being depressed, and he'd very much like to get cured. Just a difference I thought was noteworthy.  2) Pretty much agree with you here  3) I can't really argue with what you might have heard of some place where they practice this. If they do it, fine.

Here's a further clarification of what I meant for you. Cognitive Dissonance is the brain believing two or more things which contradict each other. When two things contradict each other, they CANNOT POSSIBLY both be true. Thus the thought/belief is erroneous, thus mental abilities are malfunctioning. Hence the conclusion of mental illness. The fact that cognitive dissonance is pretty normal brings into question the 'illness' part of the label, but the concept still stands - the mind is making errors.  As for the internally consistent remark; what I was talking about was the contradictions within the bible. Contradictions are the things which define an internally inconsistent thing as being internally inconsistent. Believing in something extra does not make those contradictions go away. It helps you ignore them by bolstering cognitive dissonance."

Thus the thought/belief is erroneous, thus mental abilities are malfunctioning   This is absolutely false. To say that thought ""malfunctions"" assumes some pretty erroneous things about what thought actually is and what mental illness is. If you can find one single expert on earth who thinks that believing two contradictory things is a ""mental illness"" I'll become a Monk.    ""the mind is making errors""   I don't understand this concept at all. How does the mind ""make"" errors? All you can say is that the consequences of propositional beliefs haven't been properly thought through.    As for the internally consistent remark; what I was talking about was the contradictions within the bible. Contradictions are the things which define an internally inconsistent thing as being internally inconsistent. Believing in something extra does not make those contradictions go away. It helps you ignore them by bolstering cognitive dissonance.   None of this explains why believing in the Holy Trinity is internally consistent. The most you can say is that strict English Bible literalists refuse to acknowledge contradictions. This is not cognitive dissonance at all."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,uv90q,Chops_II,3,Mon Jun 11 06:15:16 2012 UTC,"If the mind is holding two concurrent beliefs that are mutually exclusive, the mind is making logical errors. If that's the way the mind is 'meant' to work then it's not malfunctioning according to its 'design', but the logic is still erroneous.  Whether or not someone has thought about their beliefs long enough to realise they're conflicting or not does not change the fact that they do conflict. I conceded that calling it an illness might be going too far, but its still logically unsound and 'incorrect' (in terms of logic / technical correctness) to hold two beliefs which are contradictory.  And yeah - bible literalists are pretty much what the comic is about. They refuse to acknowledge contradictions by hiding behind the 'holy ghost'. Refusing to acknowledge contradictions in thoughts/beliefs they hold is cognitive dissonance and thinking that believing in the holy ghost makes the contradictions go away is further logical fallacy.  I am not claiming the 'holy trinity' is internally inconsistent. For me to do that I would need to specify which interpretation of the 'holy trinity' I'm talking about, which is pointless, because people just adjust their stance to avoid any inconsistency pointed out. This adjustment is a more or less rational way of avoiding cognitive dissonance.   But that's why the comic is referring to the inconsistencies in the bible, not in the belief in the holy trinity itself."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,uv90q,TheReprisalizer,-2,Mon Jun 11 06:27:06 2012 UTC,Not the point that I'm arguing. I don't think that it's fair to make a mockery of religion by outright damning the belief in The Holy Ghost (as this comic does) as a Mental Illness. I thought the whole point of atheism was not to be as prejudiced to someone's beliefs as some Christians are?
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,uv90q,Chops_II,4,Mon Jun 11 02:36:57 2012 UTC,"I like to debate with theists and I will admit that preoccupation does have some psychological baggage of my own attached to it. ;)     In these debates I am often told that I cannot understand the Bible because I do not “have” the Holy Spirit.  Christians believe in the Trinity, three entities that are actually one (I could make a rage comic on this too, and I just might now that I think of it).  Of the three, the Holy Spirit is probably the least defined, and that is saying something, but is generally explained as a guiding force that explains and removes what appears to be contradictions from the Bible.  I find this spectral voice to be the same as someone claiming voices in their head command them to eat dog shit or dance naked in the middle of the freeway.  I realize that this position is not going to be popular with Christians, its actually a inside joke for people that have experienced this conversational road block themselves.  And lastly, its a comic, so I thought it was funny.  I didn't make it to profoundly change lives or live up to any higher moral standard.  I did it for the lulz.     TheReprisalizer, I gave you up votes for your good feedback even if we may disagree on the merits of my comic."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,uv90q,Chops_II,3,Mon Jun 11 03:29:48 2012 UTC,"personally i think the holy spirit is some combination of gut instincts, intuition and euphoria (often brought on by group behaviour, mass hysteria (pun semi-intended))."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,uv90q,Chops_II,2,Mon Jun 11 03:43:55 2012 UTC,"I definitely agree.  The claim is that the Holy Spirit is an external thing in reality which “gut instincts, intuition and euphoria” are not.  You could also add groupthink, confirmation bias and wishful thinking to the list.  All of these are not something outside of someone's own mental processes.  I have yet to hear a universally accepted definition of “God” so the concept of the Holy Spirit is often put on the back burner.  Yet the Holy Spirit IS literally God too, so we have quite the clusterfuck."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,uv90q,Chops_II,2,Mon Jun 11 04:16:27 2012 UTC,"yup yup and yup. the things which people call the holy spirit are not necessarily bad things, they are necessary for day to day life but can sometimes lead us astray, but it's definitely the attribution of these things to some external 'higher power' that is definitely unfounded. ironically it is these things that people call the 'holy spirit' which leads people to fall into believing in the 'holy spirit'. This more or less explains why people say things like ""you just don't understand because you don't have the holy spirit flowing through you like I do"". Response: ""Yeah, actually, we do have those things you call the 'holy spirit'but we just don't blindly and mindlessly follow our own assumptions and instincts, like you do.""  Apparently I can go on and on and on about the subject."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,uv90q,TheReprisalizer,5,Mon Jun 11 04:25:14 2012 UTC,"I don't think that it was the 'holy ghost' that was attacked in particular, just that it was a nice neat and concise place to add the words 'mental illness' into christian dogma.  However belief in things without a shred of evidence (as OP put it, ""the anthropomorphic idealized delusion of a guided belief without any external evidence"") is also pretty much a sign of malfunctioning mental capacity, so attacking the holy ghost specifically in this way is still perfectly fair.  It is ridiculous. We don't need to dance around it."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,uv90q,Chops_II,3,Mon Jun 11 02:41:59 2012 UTC,Thanks again Chops II!  Well said.
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,uv90q,TheReprisalizer,5,Mon Jun 11 03:32:19 2012 UTC,"the whole point of atheism is not thinking that there are any deities. nothing more and nothing less and I chose my words carefully. change the order or anything and it's no longer what atheism means.  atheists tend to be less prejudiced as they tend to come to atheism from a skeptical point of view, however this is only a tendency. Being skeptical gives us the ability to identify unfounded claims when they are presented and that's what i think this comic is doing."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,uv90q,Chops_II,-4,Mon Jun 11 02:45:10 2012 UTC,Sorry I should rephrase that then. As Atheists like to believe they are more tolerant than some Christians surely then a comic like this basically taking the piss out of Christianity and degrading it to a Mental Illness is actually quite disgusting. A mental illness is something that can ruin someone's life for years and at times indefinitely so to use something as serious as that to get a cheap laugh doesn't that feel wrong? You may argue that it's not to get a cheap laugh but this thing is a rage comic.
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,uv90q,TheReprisalizer,3,Mon Jun 11 11:27:59 2012 UTC,Not all mental illnesses are seriously debilitating. Don't make this out to be more than it is. THAT cheapens mental illnesses.

Have you ever seen a comedian? Generally a lot more offensive than this.   Besides, what fucking audience is this? Is this subreddit full of people who would be offended by this? I thought we were generally atheists here? And if you arrive at atheism through critical thinking, you kind of have to agree that believing in something literally when there's numerous contradictions that are constantly being pointed out, is pretty piss poor mental capacity. Does understanding that logic can make two claims completely incompatible  position make me arrogant? Does realising that people who hold two conflicting positions simultaneously are necessarily making an error in judgement mean I have a neck beard? If so, please, continue to define for other people what arrogant means.  Further, to think this comic says ANYTHING about mental illness is really missing the point and just looking for ways to be offended and reject the post."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,ui4pb,letsgocrazy,0,Mon Jun 4 17:37:39 2012 UTC,"To be honest you can say about anything. You're forced to attend school, if you believe you don't want to do that have you got any grounds to refuse? Of course not.  At the end of the day, they made you attend an event because you hadn't properly applied for the dispensation. If anything, the teacher was simply enforcing the rules your school followed.   Your complaints about freedom of belief are juvenile. You didn't have to change your beliefs you just had to sit in a church for a while.   It sounds like rather than learning a lesson you're acting up like a spoiled teenager.   Get a sense of perspective."

The teacher was in the wrong here."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,ui4pb,letsgocrazy,-2,Thu Jun 14 13:22:31 2012 UTC,"They may well be ""protected"" from attending religious events - but they are still children, and if they have been booked in to do something, and proper care, health & safety assessments and staffing numbers have been worked out - then they are pretty much booked in to do whatever it is they are booked in for.  It takes a lot more organising than you might think to organise children, and frankly, your teachers probably thought - fuck you - the rules are the rules, and if you're going to have a last minute epiphany, you can damn well sit through one more afternoon of church."

For example the now famous Jessica Ahlquist sued to have the prayer banner removed from school.    Durkki can sue to remove the requirement of having a parental slip needed to skip the event, making it an opt-in and not an opt-out event."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,ui4pb,0_0_0,2,Fri Jun 8 21:26:37 2012 UTC,My appologies on the assumption.  I think the problem is that this event is opt-out as in you have to go by default unless otherwise specified.  I'm in Canada but I don't think I've been forced to go on any trip.  In this situation if you are Christian (I don't know how they figure that one out) then you have no choice in the matter.

It's just bound very carefully in practice. If you get married in a church, it's recognized by the state. The EvLut church has the power to collect taxes. There's the ""common cause"" tax from which a part goes to the Church -- even though you may not be a member. Churches get subsidies from the state and cities, places of worship are exempt from taxation.  About 40% of all kindergartens are church-run. Religious studies in school (about 2-3 hours a week for 10 years) is mainly Christian. You can be forced to redo a school grade for failing religious studies.   Female priests became possible in the 90s, but is still a highly debated topic. Same-sex marriage does not exist, but you can have a civil union (from the state). We have a bunch of cults, most major one is the Levi Lestavius one, lestadians I think they're called. No TV (though the Internet is allowed, for some strange reason), they're pretty much in every social and powerful group, for example there was an instance of a priest molesting children (strange how this seems to happen continually in religious circles, eh?) where the police were informed but just pooh-poohed the girl and... well, let's not get into that, it's depressing.

Happened to my grandfather's family when he decided that someone who had embezzled 150,000 mk from the church foreign aid should pay it back instead of just being forgiven. I simply don't understand how someone can do that -- how the fuck do you explain to a 6-year-old girl why her friends aren't allowed to play with her anymore?

If she decides to make it happen anyway, then the kid screaming nonstop throughout a church service would end up forcing her to explain to the minister why this is happening, and then to the kid's parents, and probably to school administrators, so it's a fairly effective tactic in terms of making a big stink, and making a big stink is a big step toward eliminating such a problem."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,ui4pb,LeSpatula,1 point,Mon Jun 4 23:07:28 2012 UTC,"I don't see this use of language as implausible at all. The learning curves of English and Finnish differ greatly; when in Finnish one must learn practically the entire language at once, English is a more progressively learned beast and gets more difficult when delving deep into more sophisticated use of the language.  A former Finnish teacher of mine put it nicely by saying that English is like an upside down pyramid where you can get along nicely with little knowledge of the language, whereas Finnish is more like a conventional one where a basic (yet broad, mind you) knowledge of the grammar and vocabulary are initially more difficult to attain but the scientific and technical languages and terminology will be heaps easier to gather afterwards due to their fairly small differences with the base language.  Any and all grammatical mistakes should be attributed to the fact that it's half past two in the morning.  TL;DR: Linguistical differences are fun."

To take such a large jump of beliefs at an easily-influenced age in such a short period of time smacks to me of bullshit hasty decision-making.

Christianity as an ideology and death cult existed before any certain Christ had been devised.  That's why the people who wrote about Yeshua did so many years after the events would have taken place.  It was an account devised to match a burgeoning ideology that already existed.  There is no contemporary account of the events in the writings because no such specific event necessarily took place.  The writers of the christian stories picked an arbitrary point in the past and devised a person to go along with their ideological death cult.  Original believers in christianity believed that the world would end within their lifetimes."

So even if it turns out that Yahweh never claims in the bible to be perfect, I think it's essential to the redemption doctrine that he needs to be otherwise the need for the sacrifice is unnecessary from what I understand."

The Bible doesn't say that God is perfect, and even if it did, it wouldn't define what ""perfect"" means in that context, so you can't make assumptions like that.  Why did God come down in the form of whatever?  Because he wanted to.  He could have done anything else, but he figured this way was better overall.  Maybe because he figured it'd be a better story to tell.  Maybe because he doesn't feel like doing the omnipotence thing ALL the time and would prefer to let the humans do their own thing sometimes.

It could be that such a supposed 'perfect' god takes all forms at the same time, yet the human perception attributes a value to god's appearance.  Thus, the blame of imperfectness is shifted onto the observer(a human) quite handily. It's not much that such a supposed god 'changes', but one of a subjective interpretation inherent in humans.

However, unlike schizophrenia, homosexuality is not inherently reprehensible (for lack of a better word.  I am not at all stating that schizophrenia should be shunned.  It should be met with care and understanding, and treatment), and shouldn't be painted with the same stroke.  The main defense in this case, is not stating that homosexuality happens without our choice (even though it does) and should be defensible for that reason.  Rather, the argument is that homosexuality and heterosexuality are equal, and acceptable, strokes on a more homogeneous layer of human sexuality.  EDIT: spelling"

Could you set up ways to prove to your paranoid self that a particular hospital is safe, and that ""they"" haven't gotten to it?  Could you write and store a letter to your future self that would help you through a psychotic episode, reassuring you that it's the voices you shouldn't listen to, or would your paranoid self assume that the letter is a forgery?"
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,ti5v1,Bryaxis,4,Fri May 11 19:10:17 2012 UTC,"None of that typically works. Delusions are intrusive thoughts. You can't not think them, that's their nature. Further, the schizophrenic brain physically works differently. Without getting too much into it, your brain doesn't filter thoughts and certain sensory information. It would be like taking a massive dose of LSD and then trying to force yourself not to be high after it's kicked in. Any information you encounter gets absorbed into the delusion. If you had written yourself a letter in a non-psychotic state, you'd assume that someone was controlling your brain when you wrote it. You're also not capable of logic, period. You jump from idea to idea without thinking it through. That's why it's such a scary disease and why so many schizophrenics wind up living on the street.  There are people who manage their symptoms better than others and some people who can even ignore their hallucinations. I knew one guy who, with practice, developed ways of figuring out if he was hallucinating but he wasn't highly delusional and still required regular visits. John Nash (the Inspiration for A Beautiful Mind) was only able to really deal with his symptoms after decades of medication and therapy. And even then, he was at the age where symptoms tend to subside.  When we're talking about Schizophrenia, we're really talking about a collection of diagnoses which should really be considered separate illnesses. There's a huge spectrum here where someone could be suffering biologically similar to schizophrenics but only have, say, mild paranoia as a symptom. Some people can get diagnosed with it after only having a couple of well managed psychotic episodes.   A lot of schizophrenics self-medicate with alcohol and other depressants. You can kill psychosis with anything that tends to elevate the amount of GABA in your brain, at least for a short while. The way some people deal with it is by becoming alcoholics, essentially. You need something powerful to reduce the amount of activity in the brain. If you can't reduce it, you're gonna have a bad time no matter how much preparation and forethought you put into it."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,ti5v1,servohahn,3,Fri May 11 23:47:32 2012 UTC,"I heard schizophrenia explained in an extremely elegant way once:  You know how you can daydream about crazy stuff sometimes? Like, you imagine what you would do if a crazy killer broke into the room, or if you could shoot lasers from your hands. But the entire time, you're aware that it's a daydream, not reality, and at some point, you ""snap out of it"" and get back to whatever you were doing. Well, it's much the same if you're schizophrenic, except you aren't necessarily aware that it's not reality, and you can't necessarily ""snap out of it."""

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,ti5v1,Bryaxis,3,Sat May 12 05:35:30 2012 UTC,"It's a legitimate medical use for alcohol. Anti-psychotics weren't really in use until the late 60s/early 70s. Treatments for schizophrenia before that were absolutely barbaric by today's standards. One guy even won a Nobel for devising a new lobotomy technique. Alcohol was definitely preferable to being a semi-sentient vegetable.   Incidentally most modern anti-psychotics are about as damaging to the liver as alcohol. People with schizophrenia, treated or not, have a life expectancy of about 55 years. It's a seriously fucked up disease because by the time you die from it, you've lost all of your social support (family and friends, etc.). Even though it's as insidious as cancer, people don't tend to care about it because people who die with schizophrenia are usually homeless and alone. Who mourns for those people?"

Matt 10:34-37 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own household. He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.  Matt 11:20-24 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not: Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you. And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.  Matt 15:4 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.  Shall I go on?"

But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,t3v6m,Denommus,2,Thu May 3 14:26:16 2012 UTC,"This particular passage is completely out of context. He uses household servants to illustrate the contrast between faithful and dutiful servants, and servants who become lazy and abusive to other servants when the master of the house is away. It's not clear if he's being prescriptive or merely descriptive about how a bad servant would be disciplined in an earthly household, but practical household management strategies aren't the point of the passage. But then again, I'm sure fundies would use this verse to support violent punishment if it suited their purposes. They could certainly use the fact that he didn't condemn such violence when he had the chance as evidence that he didn't think it was wrong. That's still not the same as outright advocating for it, but fundies don't give a shit about pesky little things like nuance and context."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,t3v6m,Icarus3,1 point,Sun May 6 21:37:46 2012 UTC,I don't think there is much of a context that would justify violence and servitude. But ok.
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,t3v6m,Denommus,2,Sun May 6 21:41:18 2012 UTC,"I'm certainly not saying that there is. Just pointing out that in the context of the passage, he's using it as a metaphor that would be understood in the original audience's cultural context. He's not making any direct commentary on the acceptability or unacceptability of the practice itself.  It certainly would have been better if he had taken the opportunity to say ""BTW, beating people is really not cool, just to make that clear."" But we at least, as atheists, can recognize that Jesus (or rather, the author of the book of Matthew since we can't know if this is a real quote from the historical Jesus) was only human. While he was a social radical, he was nevertheless also a product of his own time and cultural context. So it's unfortunate but unavoidable that his teachings weren't perfect."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,t3v6m,Icarus3,0,Sun May 6 22:45:17 2012 UTC,"You illustrate a valid point – while in context these passages do not instruct Jesus' followers to engage in violence, fundies don't give a shit about any nuance or context that contradicts what they want a passage to say. They love finding proof texts to justify whatever they want to do, with no care for whether or not it's actually in line with Jesus' overall teachings.  The violence in Matt 10 describes how some will respond to Jesus' followers, not how they should respond in turn. In verse 16, earlier in the same address to his disciples, he instructs them saying ""Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves."" (emphasis added)  The Matt 11 passage describes condemnation on the day of judgment – it does not advocate, or even mention, humans behaving violently toward each other as this pastor did.  In Matt 15, the Pharisees criticized Jesus for picking and choosing which parts of the Law his disciples follow. He points out that they too pick and choose, and uses the quoted passage as an example of a law they do not follow. He's not saying they should start following it, he's calling them hypocrites for insisting that he should observe certain purity laws to the letter when they themselves interpret the Law instead of taking every single word at literal face value.  Ironic how fundies are so happy to shit on the very book they claim to worship! I wish sane, non-literalist Christians would stand up to them, instead of leaving it to us atheists and then bitching about how we're attacking Christianity. If they want to defend Christianity, they need to defend it against the fundies who make it look so fucked up, not against us atheists who merely point out how seriously fucked up fundamentalism is!"

This was the best answer:   Do not educate them, or expose them to critical thinking, logic or science.  Lie to them constantly about how the world works. Feed them a steady diet of mumbo jumbo dressed up like real knowledge – the jumbo jet in the whirlwind for example – and pretend that it is deep wisdom.  Make them loathe their own natural bodies and functions. Convince them they are small and weak and worthless and need redemption. Tell them everything enjoyable is grievously wrong to even think about, and that their only fun should be in grovelling to an invisible friend.  Ensure that they resent anyone who is not like them in every way – skin color, nationality, political opinion but especially creed. Make such people out to be evil and vile and give them – impotent minorities all – the fictional power to somehow oppress and persecute the vast majority who do think like you.  Teach them to laugh at and dismiss out of hand any faith but their own. Early – early mind you – make sure they are taught the difference between superstitious deadly error – that one raving lunatic in the desert told the truth about a vicious god who killed people, and divine eternal truth – that another raving lunatic in the desert told the truth about a vicious god who killed people.  Instruct them with all severity and import to never question for themselves – to never think for themselves – to never live for themselves – but to seek answers only in one – just one – particular set of semi-literate bronze age folk tales.  Above all – and this cannot be overemphasized – make sure they cannot spell, use correct grammar, or understand basic English words.  That should do the trick.  -David M"

The point of religious pluralism is so that people may worship or not as they will without endangerment to their body or mind. As far as I'm concerned, a person is free to believe whatever they want about other people. However, when one person acts in a way which is hateful towards a religious group, and which endangers the physical or (yes) psychological well-being of another person, they violate both the spirit and the letter of religious pluralism.   In other words, your argument is based on a strawman fallacy. You really don't have anything to argue with me about, unless you're against religious pluralism. Christians are free to believe that everyone else is going to hell (though it directly contradicts the more important teachings and rules, IMO), but they cross a line when they act out against non-Christians."

And you might want to try keeping a more open mind.    Things aren't just correct or true because some scientist says so.  Scientists understand how the things they believe always end up being wrong, after a new theory comes along.  That's why science refers to accepted truths as theory.  Calling science a religion is a fair assessment.    An open mouth learns nothing."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,sw3jy,00fordmc,4,Sat Apr 28 00:16:05 2012 UTC,"A religion is not just any ol’ thing you happen to believe, and its not just anything you believe strongly either.  Every belief-system which is commonly accepted as a religion by both its adherents and its critics is a doctrine of ritual traditions, ceremonies, mythology, and the associated dogma of faith-based belief systems which all include the idea that some element of ‘self’ (be it a soul or portion of consciousness, or memories, etc.) may, in some sense, continue beyond the death of the physical being.  This applies to every religion and only to religion, but doesn’t apply to science at all.  Religion assumes its own conclusions, believes impossible things without reason, and defends those beliefs against all reason to the contrary.  So it can’t help but be wrong to some degree to start with, and any errors will never even be acknowledged, much less sought out or corrected.  So that situation can never improve.  However wrong it already is is however wrong it will forever be.  So faith offers no way to discover the real truth about anything, but it’s a great way to stay wrong forever and never admit it- even to yourself.   Science is completely opposite in every respect.  Rather than any need-to-believe, science is driven by a desire to understand, and the only way to improve your understanding of anything is to seek out errors in our current position and correct them.  You can’t do that if you claim your initial assumptions are already infallible, and you can’t even begin to seek the truth if you won’t admit that you might not already know it, or that you don’t know it all perfectly already.      While scientists themselves may be religious men of many different faiths, their methodology was designed to be the antithesis of faith because it requires that all assumptions be questioned, that all proposed explanations be based on demonstrable evidence, and that all hypotheses be must be testable and potentially falsifiable.  Blaming magic is never acceptable because miracles aren’t explanations of any kind, and there has never been a single instance in history when assuming the supernatural has ever improved our understanding of anything.  In fact, such excuses have only ever impeded our attempts at discovery.  This is one of many reasons why science depends on methodological naturalism; because unlike religion, science demands some way to determine who’s explanations are the more accurate, and which changes would actually be corrections.  Science is a self-correcting process which changes constantly because its always improving.  Only accurate information has practical application, so it doesn’t matter what you want to believe, all that matters is why we should believe it too, and how accurate your perception can be shown to be. Thus, you can’t just make up stuff in science (like you can in religion) because you have to substantiate everything, and be able to defend it even against peers who may not want to believe as you do.  Be prepared to convince them anyway.  Its possible to do that in science because science is based on reason.  That means you must be ready to reject or correct whatever you hold true should you discover evidence against it.   All this stands completely counter to faith, and religious assumptions cannot withstand any of these rigors."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,sw3jy,00fordmc,4,Tue May 1 20:16:52 2012 UTC,"Well. You seem to know everything.   If you'd actually read and comprehended what I wrote, you'd know that that isn't the case at all, and the scientific method is grounded in the willingness to admit that it is wrong, so that it can become less so.   The world must be so boring for you.   ""Isn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too?""  --Douglas Adams   By the way, a scientific system based on peer review requires that we all have faith in the opinions of our peers...   Incorrect.  First off, confidence in careful procedures and in the collection of evidence is in no way equivalent to the unevidenced faith of religion, and to even suggest otherwise is dishonest equivocation.  Second, science is a harsh meritocracy, and anyone is free to attempt to disprove someone's findings.  The peer group is not some close, secretive cabal.    For example, people have been attempting to disprove evolution since Darwin first published.  For over 150 years so far, the greatest minds of the modern age have collectively failed to controvert the essence of evolution, and not for lack of trying!  It is a study which neither requires nor desires faith, and doesn’t even permit it, nor is it needed, because evolution is easily indicated and evidenced, measured and tested myriad ways without it –and even against the harshest scrutiny.  And remember that evidence must be objective, meaning that it can still be verified whether you want to believe in it or not.  Evolution has all that in spades, and is a unifying theory which has enhanced our knowledge of many different aspects of biology enormously, and that’s why so many religious as well as non-religious scientists endorse it.  This isn't a matter of ""faith"" in peer review, because anyone can review anything, and many often do."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,sw3jy,ApokalypseCow,-3,Tue May 1 21:08:55 2012 UTC,"Faith is faith.  You just said they use faith.  It doesn't matter if it's a specific kind of faith.

But, more importantly, I think what you're looking for is /DebateReligion  I said at the beginning that science can be considered a religion Depending on point of view.  And it can.  And there's no debating that.  From a certain point of view, one can consider science to be a religion.  So, if you want to argue about religion, try that sub.  I'm not really interested, and there's nothing to discuss here, anyways.  (Ps - Are you assuming I'm religious, or a theist?  I'm neither.

Faith in an unevidenced invisible sky-daddy and faith in a time-tested, well proven and inherently self-correcting system.  You can't even call it faith anymore at that point - that's confidence.  Remember, all those ""opinions"" are supported by evidence, and opinions without evidence in science are useless.   I said at the beginning that science can be considered a religion Depending on point of view.   Only if you discard everything standard about religion:  the funny hats, the verboten foods, the tithing, the holy books, the dogma, etc etc etc.  From a certain point of view, your mouth is your anus, but I don't see you shoving food up your ass for sustenance (nor do I want to).

Let’s review: It’s self-evident that when I do a physics lab assignment and test out Newton’s laws, I don’t have to have faith. I make observations which either correspond with the laws or they don’t. If I’m unsure, I can ask someone else to observe with me. If we both find a discrepancy, either I made a mistake in my procedure, or I’ve discovered a new property of matter.  To claim that lab work requires faith in science is clear equivocation. At the risk of being highly tedious and pedantic, let me just repeat myself again: confidence in careful procedures and in the collection of evidence is in no way equivalent to the unevidenced faith of religion, and to even suggest otherwise is dishonest equivocation.  One is clearly ""faith"".  The other disallows faith entirely, as I already went over.   I said at the beginning that science can be considered a religion Depending on point of view.   And I demonstrated that no, it cannot, because to be a religion by any useful measure requires certain things that science lacks and simply does not allow.   Are you assuming I'm religious, or a theist?   No, and nowhere did I structure my argument under any such assumption."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,sw3jy,ApokalypseCow,2,Wed May 2 00:52:39 2012 UTC,"Depending on point of view   I suspect that it depends on how one is defining the term ""religion"". Going by the Oxford mass noun definition, ""he belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power"", science absolutely does not qualify.   It is only possible to think of science as a religion if you're using the sub definition of ""a pursuit or interest followed with great devotion"", which it seems to me is a pretty informal, and not very useful, way of defining the term. If the word religion is so broad as to possibly include pretty much all world views, then doesn't it lose it's usefulness as a term for distinguishing beliefs incorporating the worship of the supernatural from those that don't?   Try studying a little philosophy and epistemology. And you might want to try keeping a more open mind.   Just because science relies on some axiomatic assumptions, as all world views and ideas must to one extent or another, does not make it a religious world view.    Things aren't just correct or true because some scientist says so.   I don't think that OP is claiming that's the case.   Scientists understand how the things they believe always end up being wrong, after a new theory comes along.   Really? Always? That doesn't seem true. When, for example, do you expect them to discover that we were ""wrong"" about the Earth orbiting the Sun?  It is true that science is always building on pre-existing ideas, and that because it is a self-correcting methodology hypotheses that are wrong will be found to be so and corrected when possible, but that's mile away from ""always end up being wrong"".   Calling science a religion is a fair assessment.   How are you defining religion? 'Cause you don't seem to have justified that statement based on any of the definitions that I'm using."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,sq0d3,cricketpants,5,Tue Apr 24 20:55:00 2012 UTC,"Hey, thanks a lot for the links.   Here's a thought:   There are very few prepositions in Ugaritic. Thus, those prepositions which do exist are often pressed into multiple duty. Once again (!) the context must determine the meaning. Following are the Ugaritic prepositions and their range of meaning.  b = to, from, in, with, into, with (instrumental), with (material), among, for, after (temporal), while. With the 1st person singular suffix by = in me, etc.  l = to, from, for, to (motion), at (local), at (temporal), to (person addressed), for (advantage), for (purpose), by (in oaths)   I was reading this when a thought came to my mind:  do ambiguous language predispose people to having a religious mindset, or viceversa?  I recall reading that a primitive tribe found somewhere in the Amazon jungle, had only four words for numbers: One, two, three, and many. So they couldn't distinguish numbers four, and five.  The idea of newspeak in George Orwell's 1984 also comes to mind, about the english language being redefined, so that people couldn't even think about subversive stuff. Also, I just remembered the separation of languages in Babel, according to Neal Stephenson's ""Snow Crash"", when the high priest Enki developed the Nam Shub to force people to invent new languages so that they could think for themselves.  Perhaps in a future society there will be no ambiguities in language, so people will understand each other better, and confusion (i.e. in politics) will be much harder?  Just a thought.  EDIT: Oh, I found a scribd book about learning Ugaritic. It's called ""A manual of Ugaritic"". It looks very complete! :)  EDIT 2: Grammar."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,sq0d3,cricketpants,3,Wed Apr 25 04:21:40 2012 UTC,"First of all, I was giving you the course as an half-joke, if you go and really learn Ugaritic, you're absolutely badass!   That said, I suppose all human languages are somehow ""ambiguous"". Prepositions are a classical example of this, as you've seen in Ugaritic, but also in English ""to"", ""on"" etc. convey a lot of meanings depending on the verbs involved. Also this doesn't mean that the language is really ambiguous, only that their meaning is to be intepreted from the context, but the resulting sentence is not necessarily ambiguous at all.  If you want some general hint on the language-thought relationship, you could go reading about linguistic relativity and the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, and if you want an example of an artificial non-ambiguous language like the one you wonder about, you could have a look at Loglan and its descendent, Lojban."

Well, I don't know if I'll have the time, but you're giving me the motivation for it! (Should I study basic hebrew first?)  Anyway, I'll probably just study the very basics, I just want to know what the ugaritic religious texts say, with numbering, of course. The judeochristian Bible has billions of copies worldwide; why can't we have an ugaritic ""bible""? :(  Anyway I think I found another copy of the Ugaritic religious texts: ""Canaanite Myths and Legends"", by JCL Gibson, it's $32 from Amazon.   That said, I suppose all human languages are somehow ""ambiguous"". Prepositions are a classical example of this, as you've seen in Ugaritic, but also in English ""to"", ""on"" etc. convey a lot of meanings depending on the verbs involved.   Yes, but some languages are less ambiguous than others. For example, spanish has the words ""ser"" and ""estar"", which both are translated to the verb ""to be"", but have two distinct meanings: ""Ser"" means something that the subject has always been, like ""this is a chair"". ""Estar"" refers to a temporary state, like ""this chair is broken"", or ""I'm busy right now"" (so the joke ""I'm happy; Hello happy!"" does not apply). On the other side of the coin, English has very specific possessives : ""His / her"" to differenciate the ownership, while spanish only has ""su"" in the case of third person. But spanish adds the singular plural of the object: ""sus posesiones"" = ""his/her possessions"".  But I digress.  EDIT: Wow, I never thought there was a name for the idea I presented! I looked at wikipedia's Linguistic_relativity page, and it's awesome. Also, Lojban is a pretty badass language. I'm sure that's a language that  Vulcans would use :)  EDIT 2: Grammar"

I don't generally go around telling people what I think of their clothes, and I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to be rude to someone wearing one, but you also won't see me going out of my way to be particularly friendly to someone wearing one - both because they don't make me feel friendly, and because the fact of their wearing the garment sends an implicit message of ""this person is not welcoming to friendliness from a man."""

Of course, there are many religions and even sects of Christianity that don't accept that view. They would say that all dead babies WOULD go to heaven.  Actually though, now that I think about it a little more, if we're presupposing the idea of an omnipotent, omniscient God that isn't bound by our perception of time, wouldn't He (or it) have the ability to flawlessly anticipate the future choices of any human life, even from conception? And wouldn't He (or it) then be able to accurately judge whether any fetus is ultimately deserving of heaven or hell?   Just a thought."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,s77fy,Mako_Eyes,12,Fri Apr 13 05:44:50 2012 UTC,"Even better, wouldn't he have known whether you were going to Heaven or Hell even before creating you? If so, does that mean he created some people for the explicit purpose of going to Hell?"
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,s77fy,Amunium,3,Fri Apr 13 06:26:31 2012 UTC,"It's mind-bending, isn't it? In order to be defined as God, He would have to know that some of His creations were going to hell, yet He still creates them. Why would He do that? Wouldn't it be better to just not create those?  It's a pretty huge theological hurdle, and I'm sure most people would start heading for the ""God's ways are not our ways"" cop-outs at this point. The interesting question that it comes down to for me though, is this: let's say you're God. You want to make life (for whatever reason), but you know that it is going to choose to deny you and that it will ultimately wind up in hell. Is it right to deny that being the right to exist, the right to ever make that choice, just because you know what that choice will be?  In case you haven't figured it out by now, I'm not exactly an atheist. I'm not exactly a Christian, either; I just like to have thoughtful conversations about their beliefs."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,s77fy,Mako_Eyes,2,Fri Apr 13 06:43:15 2012 UTC,"Not creating a person is not the same as denying them the right to exist. If so, God is denying an infinite number of people the right to exist every second, as an infinite number of possible people are not born."

He would have to be in a constant state of creation, in such a way that our own minds, limited by our perception of time, can't understand.   I realize that now I'm flirting with the ""well we can't understand God anyway so nyeh"" defense now, but really, when you start talking about existing outside of time, what choice do you have? I can't honestly get my head around the idea of being unbound by time. The best I can conceptualize is a being that exists in a DIFFERENT version of time, that has the ability to interact with ours the way we would interact with a huge painting or tapestry: He can see it all at once."

I understand what you're saying. I think I would say yes because it seems it would be better to not exist at all instead of suffering for eternity with no chance of escape.   My biggest problem with modern day Christianity is the concept of Hell (eternal suffering). It is in no way a just, merciful, or fair concept, and I would not choose to worship a God (even if he existed) who supports that setup while having the power to do something about it. If I remember correctly though, Hell is supposed to be simply separation from God after death and no eternal life with him, not actual eternal suffering, so it's what most people who don't believe in an afterlife think would happen anyway. If that is what Hell is (if it existed), then God shouldn't deny existence to someone because he knows they will end up in Hell. But that is just in my own view- it might still seem like a terrible thing to a God. I don't know and will never know.   I'm also inclined to believe in reincarnation before Hell if I were to believe in souls in the first place (which I don't). Pretty much everything else gets reused- why not souls too?   That's probably enough writing on my part."

Thus, according to Lewis, if escape from hell never happens, it is not because God is not willing that it should happen. Instead, residence in hell is eternal because that is just what persons in hell have chosen for themselves."" There are many more thoughts on the matter from intelligent people here.   Also, I can't help but point out that though you say you'll never know, you will. You're going to die eventually; then you'll know for sure, haha.  Well, unless you just stop existing.

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,s77fy,Mako_Eyes,1 point,Sat Apr 14 00:37:43 2012 UTC,"I have a few problems with deists as well. Are you sure your ""experiences"" weren't delusions? For, how can anyone, really, rely one's life on an experience, intuition, guess or observation? Aren't they quite unreliable? It is the reason which one should rely on; from which one should find the bases for one's believes. I don't understand why someone needs the idea of ""something"" behind all this. Weakness? The continuous need for hope and meaning? Don't get it."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,s77fy,Mako_Eyes,1 point,Sat Apr 14 22:37:34 2012 UTC,"No, I'm not sure that my experiences weren't delusions.   The thing is, I consider myself a very reasonable and well-balanced human being, and I display no indications of any psychological issues, nor do I have any history of such anywhere in my family. Thus, if it was a delusion that I experienced, then it came seemingly out of nowhere.   Now, if I accept that it is possible for such a phenomenon to happen with no apparent reason, that seriously calls into question the dependability of our own brains; the same brain that you are depending on when you are calling on your own experience and reason to determine that there is no higher power. Thus, if I cannot trust my own experience, I cannot trust our reason either, and we're back at square 1.   I honestly don't understand how people can decisively say that there is no higher power. I mean, the idea of a higher power usually presupposes that whatever ""it"" is possesses intelligence on a whole other level from ours, which would seem to make it a piece of cake for it to actively hide itself from us. Saying that something does not exist just because we haven't perceived it yet with our extremely limited senses has always struck me as a very arrogant viewpoint.   I'm not saying that this proves anything by any means; I just don't know how people can believe so strongly that there is nothing out there. It would seem that the most reasonable view would be to admit that none of us are really sure, and remain open to the possibility."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,s77fy,Mako_Eyes,1 point,Sun Apr 15 00:46:35 2012 UTC,"Yea skepticism takes us really far. Wouldn't it be the same to argue that none of us can say for sure that the FSM isn't real. It's possible that is is there. Of course, you're a deist and don't believe in any particular God but in ""something"". By the word delusion I wasn't referring to any psychological issues or mental illnesses. But simply on the impossibility to be sure -- just like you said in the end. To rely one's life purely on one's own experience is solipsism: the world is the sum of a subject's experience thus the world is I. And that's subjective idealism at its madness, I believe. To make myself clear, here's an example of a delusion: one sees a pig and forms an opinion that the pig exists. However, the following day one is informed that the pig was a robot. The pig didn't exist but the robot. That's one example of a false assumption -- a delusion.   Secondly, are you kidding or are you actually comparing experience with reason? I'm sorry. I guess we should get all the philosopher of the world here and let them know that you have solved the eternal dilemma of rationalism and empiricism. Reason is a feature which helps us to gain knowledge from the metaphysical world. Experience, on the other hand, is purely a personal phenomenon which appears to a cognitive subject. One can never be sure that one's experience is correct but, at times, one can of one's reason. See Plato's classical definition of reason if you require more information on the subject matter. I guess by the ""square one"" you're referring to the moment when we cannot be sure of our existence. This is not leading there, your argument is.  Do you actually believe that atheists are grounding their world view on what they have perceived with their limited senses? I beg to differ. With regards to arrogance, I see no higher manifestation of it that solipsism itself. Or the idea that humans would be significant in the universe.   But okay. Let's accept your thesis that we can't no anything about the world which is beyond our knowledge. That's Immanuel Kant's transcendental idealism -- the phenomenal world is the target of our knowledge. Thus, why would you believe in higher power when you can know nothing about it? And I'm not saying that there wouldn't be ""anything"" there. Just that there isn't a God or what you call ""something"". However, we can easily discuss metaphysics, platonic idealism or Hegel's absolute idealism. All these might help but I see no point in the idea of a supreme being.   Now, of course, I can't be SURE of anything. But I see skepticism as a useless strategy in epistemology. Surely, there are possibilities. But there's also the possibility that I don't exist. Yet, I'm not basing my knowledge, life and thinking on that. We should make a clear difference between knowledge (even if it cannot be absolute) and guess, belief or mistake."

Religious people who DON'T believe that God can see what we do in the future very likely do not know their own religious doctrines.

I think they have a huge problem in co-existing. How wouldn't they? If God sees one's future, doesn't he already control it? Or, simply in determinism, the causality which controls everything.

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,s77fy,rjstef,1 point,Sat Apr 14 22:43:31 2012 UTC,"Here's my take on it.  Imagine you have a tv that displays images from a security camera a hundred miles away. It's on a street or something, so you see people passing by, going about their daily lives. Now, imagine that through some metaphysical phenomenon, the images you are seeing are actually 10 minutes into the future. Everything you see on the tv happens in ten minutes, without fail. Now, are you suddenly in control of everyone's actions just because you can see them ahead of time? No, because you're a hundred miles away. Nothing you do affects anything that they do: you just see it first.   That is how they're separate."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,s77fy,TSED,1 point,Sun Apr 15 01:02:53 2012 UTC,"Well, I do understand what you mean. I guess you're a deist? For, I can accept that, in deism they are separate. But in theism they aren't. However, I find this conception rather unnecessary. If God is omniscient, why doesn't he want to prevent evil? Is it only to give man free will?   I think this is the case: your argument seems to highlight the existence of a personal God but mine the existence of God as the same as infinity.  Therefore, theological determinism would be true and, at the same, paradoxical. I wonder, is the God you are presenting a perfect being.  May I say that, this is more difficult when I don't know what you believe in. If you're a Christian it's one thing and if you're a religiously independent deist it's another."

Actually, many religious people accused that song of being sac-religious because it postulates the idea of God being some random schlub you could run into anywhere.  When she sings ""God is great"" that's actually meant somewhat ironic considering he's just some dude sitting next to you on the bus.  What's so great about that?  The real irony is that the whole idea of God becoming human and thus developing sympathy for us, his creation, is basically what the New Testament was all about.  So basically this is a song that talks about the Christian narrative in a pretty positive and contemporary way, and it was very controversial at the time just because conservative Christians could not believe that a catchy pop song like that could say anything deep or meaningful about their religion.  tl;dr:  It's a Christian song, but it's still good even if you're an atheist."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,s6pjq,ccchuros,1 point,Fri Apr 13 19:16:14 2012 UTC,"Well... to reiterate what I said a month ago: in the song she gives God human characteristics, which the lyrics you quoted also show.  He's lonely.  He's sloppy.  He's feeling sad.  She's trying to show us a side to God that would make us sympathize with him, and vice versa.  This is essentially the corner stone of Christianity.  That's all I'm saying.  But even if the song doesn't mean shit, why should that stop me from giving the song an interpretation that gives the song a greater meaning and thus allows me to enjoy it on a different level?  I don't like turning my brain off when I enjoy something.  Some people do, and bully for them.  I don't."

It shouldn't.  I mean, clearly, the idea you are talking about is alluded to in the lyrics of the song.  It was also made a lot more explicit in the music video, as I recall.

For myself, I'm pro-choice for two reasons: because I know I'd want to have an abortion if I got pregnant right now, and because I feel like children shouldn't be made to be born to mothers who wanted to abort them. I see potential but I don't see any value in a lump of cells, so abortion isn't horribly bad to me; but I also have a hard time finding any way to explain why it would be OK. I wouldn't be bothered by it, but it's still difficult to explain why that is when I'm bothered by killing actual, developed human beings. It's a weird area.   I guess the best I can come up with is that I don't think we should force one life full of potential to be ruined for the sake of some future-person; but that sounds pretty awful to pro-life people. Grey area indeed."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,rxhf5,Metalhead2881,14,Sat Apr 7 05:03:41 2012 UTC,"i wrote this in response to a theist once, and i'd like you to have it.  genesis 1:29 states that god created all animals to be herbivores. this suggests that before the flood all animals, such as lions, sharks, and even the tyrannosaurus rex were plant-eating creatures. god then allows the animals to eat meat after the flood. i find no explanation of how every characteristic of carnivores, from razor sharp claws and flesh shearing teeth, to other physical characteristics that are instrumental to obtaining and devouring meat, allowed them to live off of plant material. herbivores have flat, plant crushing teeth and the means to properly digest plant material, the opposite of carnivores can be said in that they lack the enzymes and bacteria in their gastrointestinal system to digest cellulose.  genesis 1:24 - 26 states that god created all the creatures that move along the land at the same time. this suggests that man and dinosaur lived on the earth at the same time. what would account for only their extinction and not ours? if the flood in the age of noah were true, we would not only expect to find all dinosaur fossils, but ALL fossils along the same sedimentary layer of rock across the entire world. such an event of massive destruction would leave obvious proof of world wide death on such an immense scale. as you can see from fossil record, which is divided into epochs of time, their complexities increase, and they are evenly distributed along the geological column.   genesis 7:24 states that water lasted on the earth for 150 days. much, if not all, of the plant life would have died off, leaving little for the herbivores to eat. the only dining option for the now carnivorous creatures would have been the other animals.  but what about the dinosaurs that lived in the water? what happened to them during the flood? there is no way to explain the selective extinction of aquatic dinosaurs while underwater mammals such as dolphins, whales, sea lions, or walrus remain in existence. the only obvious explanation is through the evolutionary process of the dinosaurs being killed off sixty-five million years ago, giving mammals the opportunity to dominate the planet.  in addition to the expanse of fossil evidence used to explain the earth's history, geological evidence provides a similar account. geological studies reveal that the earth contained several variations of a supercontinent that took billions of years of plate tectonic shifting to provide us with the continents we know today. the story of the flood states that the animals were deposited at a single point in mesopotamia to distribute themselves across the entire planet to their natural habitats we know today. if the world appears today as it did in the time of noah, there is no way to account for how specific animals allocated themselves to specific continents or islands. for example; how did all fourteen species of marsupials migrate together from mesopotamia to australia?   there were many well known mesopotamian societies that were established before the time of the flood. akkadian (2340 - 2125 bc), egyptian (3100 - 2700 bc), sumerian (3500 - 1900 bc). if the bible were true, and the flood actually happened around 2237 bc, these civilizations would have been wiped off the planet. also, if the flood did actually occur, china's 5000 year history would not have gone uninterrupted.   the flood didn't happen. noah didn't exist. the bible is a lie."

The government throws millions at the churches each year because of WW2-time contracts, Christianity got it's own subject in school (everyone that opts out get's ""ethics""), churches collect taxes through official channels and the two major parties are constantly peddling to believers, even going as far as denying the existing secular movements inside their parties official accrediting. And that's all just from the top of my head. A lot of the younger and more educated population is either indifferent or very negative towards religion, but Germany is so very far away from being a progressive society, don't kid yourself."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,rg9ip,Karlchen,5,Wed Mar 28 01:14:28 2012 UTC,"There is a difference between things on paper and how the things really are.    the two major parties are constantly peddling to believers, even going as far as denying the existing secular movements inside their parties official accrediting   What What?   The most religious party is the CDU, they are so damn religious that on average 20 out of 230 visit the mass in the ""official"" chapel of the Reichstag. 75% of the once mostly catholic party are in support of criticism against the pope. They have openly  non-believers and protestants in their party. The party program has no connection with christian belief, besides the church tax thing.  You also have to look at the demographics of the biggest parties, older people just carried their believe through time, without really practicing it. You can't take utterances of single nutjobs as the opinion of a whole party.  I don't know what you mean with ""Christianity"" as an own subject, but I know that some schools offer ""Religion"" as a subject. I was on a private school for some time (under the CJD, a christian organisation), where a catholic italian teached religion - whe was the only one believing in god the whole time. Kids where sent to the school because of it's reputation. On a public school I only know of Ethics as an obligatory subject! Imho it's a pretty important subject because it, especially if teached correctly, encourages kids to a basic understanding of free-thinking and promotes more awareness of an open humanist worldview.  I don't know where you are from, I only know that southern and some parts of the southern-west areas of germany are more religious. Where I live even the pastor doesn't really believe in god.   The rest you've listed are nasty remnants of history and/or non-coherent facts. Religion in germany and northern europe is something different from religion in the US. Here, religiousness in a christian sense is an empty shell for something that plays no role in public life. And that's what comics like this are about. You can't compare percentages of believers between the states and european countries, because the quality of it is something completely different."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,rg9ip,Firekracker,2,Wed Mar 28 03:26:48 2012 UTC,"I have no idea where you got that 75% of the CDU are in favor of criticism against the pope, his last visit painted a very different picture. The SPD still denies their Laizist (secular) movement official accrediting because it's not part of their party line. Remember when the SPD was the godless worker-party? The CDU is long gone as the most religious party, everything red actually has serious believers. Some actually ""come out"" with their faith and make a huge deal about how important it is to them. Those people and their voters are not anywhere near old. Both the SPD and the CDU include the desire to ""strengthen the bonds with the churches"" in their programs, which would be meaningless in itself, but the make no effort to close the gaping money sink and appoint more religious figures of power constantly, so there's that. In most parts of the country there's still a Protestant and Catholic subject that's part of the default curriculum, it's a minority that abandoned that institution. Even though they are a minority, there are believers that are perfectly comparable to US levels of crazy. Full-blown born again Christians are having a small boom down here and huge parts of the current 20-something generation are still deeply catholic, actually believing in a god. It's very different once you get out of the former DDR."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,rg9ip,Gloinson,2,Wed Mar 28 09:07:12 2012 UTC,"The worst part about the nonexistent separation between church and state is IMO apart from mandatory religion classes in school that the military rents priests as ""soul carers"" (Seelsorger) who have basically no special training apart from their pastoral training - and highest leaders strive for a closer relationship between Bundeswehr and catholic/lutheran churches. I don't find it acceptable for a guy who would burn me for being a heretic a few hundred years back to lecture me on ethics, after all he obviousy has no idea of them. Oh and let's not forget a crazed family minister who would later be known as Zensursula giving a press conference with a nun and a bishop saying that the consitution basically were the ten commandments in different wording.

Whenever I hear a 'Wort des Tages' or 'Wort zum Sonntag' on Tv or Radio, I wonder why it's always religious people saying 90% bullcrap, but never a philosopher.    That might be due to the fact that philosophy isn't something that really can make up a shitty daily advice on the fly. You know, whenever I hear 'jokes' on the German radio, it is some fucking morning-show, but that doesn't make us a morning-show-humour-country.

I don't know about the CDU/SPU ""peddling to believers"". I haven't seen any of that. From my experience most politicians avoid the topic of religion because it isn't useful anymore; they can only embarrass themselves or upset people."

However in another poll 30% said they were Catholic and another 30% said they were Protestant.  This means that there are Germans out there who are affiliated with a church but don't believe in God.

If God & Jesus are on such solid ground, when why do you have to deny reality & outright LIE to get people on your side? The truth is self-evident - if it was the truth, logic couldn't touch it!  Just like the article I read yesterday about them calculating the date of Noah's flood to 2348 B.C. - nevermind the fact that major societies were thriving before, DURING and immediately AFTER the flood... nope - just keep selling bullshit.  Ultimately, what it boils down to is this: Evolution, science and secular society DOES NOT hurt them in any way - in fact, they ENJOY the benefits of them everyday. From medicine, to food processing, packaging, transport & storage, to architecture, to technology, to transportation, to justice & freedom to worship the god of their choosing.  NO. They want to see an end to it all because they're PISSED OFF that they can't indoctrinate YOUR kids into THEIR faith. They want to force people to believe in their god - because after all, in a secular society, you can call the bullshit for what it is. In a theocracy, if you call the bullshit, you DIE.  It's all about their ""duty"" to dominate the Earth for their god - no matter if it's true or not. Don't they realize that if it isn't true, then it's not God... and if it isn't God they're working for, it's MAN. Narrow minded men who enjoy the comfort and power that comes with getting people to believe a big lie. You don't have to work, and you have a special position that can't be touched, because it was ""given"" to you by the invisible ""creator of the universe""."

Perhaps you should pause next time before you tells someone what subreddits they are or are not worthy of.   Not every atheist is ready to go with the defense all the time like that, either, but I am genuinely sorry that your experience with atheism has made that necessary.  I'm agnostic myself, and despite coming from a family that's 90% hardcore Mormons, my immediate family has always been very chill about religion, as have anyplace I've worked at.  I'm hoping the trend continues, since it lets me just dodge now and then instead of having to defend.  It's silly that we have to defend how we believe.  It's silly anyone should have to, unless their beliefs lead to hurting or subjugating someone else.  (PS, it's sis.)"

Usually i dont see the big jerk subreddits because of a RES filter, but this one isnt filtered, and i saw it rising in the all/top http://www.reddit.com/r/all/top/?t=hour feed. I couldn't stop myself, although i dont go looking for subreddits to troll or anything.  /r/atheism got to critical jerk mass for me when the self-pics thing happened. Thats when it got added to the filter. It got worse than /r/trees. Feels more like /r/shitredditsays come to think of it, a self-confessed circlejerk. I used to find some of the posts funny, more i found the articles on crazy fundies in the US interesting, but its getting drowned in shit posts, often illogical, a lot of popular comments are just bad, plus necessary controversy is not just disagreed with its downvoted to hell and the comments that counter are usually trite one-liners collectively rehearsed a million times. Which of course are hugely upvoted. An echo-chamber, a hugbox, a vast soggy biscuit real atheists are expected to eat?  Whats the point in discussing something if theres only a linear narrative followed and everyone is aspiring to the lowest common denominator, stating the obvious, or worse the biased in one hand, while pointing at the 'opponents' bias with the other. The subreddit is cancer infested.  Religious people are sometimes crazy, and if their crazy gets all up in your shit all the time, i can see why you get mad, but its no excuse for rallying a counter-jerk of your own to practise your own dogma, in their image but different. Its like the /r/atheism hivemind is /r/recoveringalcoholics except its not alcohol its religion, and all the brain damage religion inflicted on their logic is still running unchecked.  Also ranting aside, i agree, the downvote isn't a disagree button, but it is used to collectively shape discussion i think, but once something reaches -4 and the downvotes keep coming you know thats no longer why; you've upset a circlejerk, interrupted a groups fragile equilibrium, and they're mad as hell about it.

It was really interesting - basically, black people are black so they don't get skin cancer, but as humans migrated from Africa into other parts of the world, having less sunlight around made Vitamin D a problem, which is why lighter skin was favorable in those places. What's especially interesting (and I apologize for not remembering the exact details) was that while the difference in pigmentation between Europeans and Africans can be tied directly to one particular allele, Asians actually have the African variant of that allele - in other words, having lighter skin evolved independently in Europe and Asia, and via a different gene locus.

If we assumed every human started white, which they most likely didn't, then the more accurate account of evolution would assert that the people with white skin (as opposed to dark skin) were less likely to pass on their genes on through their offspring.  The surviving members of the human population would thus have a higher frequency of dark skin alleles.  The problem I have with this rage comic is that it implies that this change in skin tone happened over one lifetime or that there was some kind of Lamarckian inheritance of dark skin characteristics."

But in hindsight, at least, you recognize they're hallucinations.  Also, if you're not already receiving psychiatric assistance, you really need it.

It is just really hard not to be scared when staring at the dripping mouth of an alien that wants to kill you.  These events only happen when my insomnia gets bad. Most of my life, I get 3-4 hours of sleep a night, and none on weekends. Sometimes, I end up not sleeping for 1-2 weeks. I only have these events during my week long torture sessions. I have already done the therapy thing, did sleeping medication (it wires me while making me sleepy, I would rather cut off my dick with a bowling ball) and did the anti-depressants. There is not much that can be done, so I just try to manage symptoms, and I am trying to create a tulpa so I can get input from my sub-consious, If that is even possible."

I still have to talk myself out of believing in ghosts when I go back and visit my parents.  I'm sure I was just imagining everything... but it used to be freaky as hell.  Late at night, I'd hear music and talking from our basement ""cubby hole"" storage room.  It was odd because, well, it was a storage room without a TV or radio.  You could hear the music and voices even when home alone -- but never until later at night.  One time, I remember walking up the basement stairs to get something to drink from the kitchen (I was watching TV down there, as the main room was our home theater), turning around on the stairs, and SEEING a ghost.  It looked like a lady in a white dress.  Now, for some reason, actually seeing the ""ghost"" didn't scare me, as it seemed pretty damn benevolent.  I was still freaked out after the fact.  A few years ago, I mentioned the sight to my mother - and she described the exact same ghostly woman because she saw it too.  My brother, a fellow atheist, and I were talking once about how creepy the house we grew up in was... and he saw the exact same ""woman"" on the stairs.    For years, I was convinced.  Then, thank goodness, I read an article on how radon gas can cause hallucinations causing people to see ghosts.  To this day, I strongly suspect that the entire house is full of radon.  Its a nice, solid, scientific explanation."

Ghosts, to me, may or may not exist. The toss-up is the supposed ""evidence"" vs. scientific explanation (of which it cannot be explained).

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,qz6an,alefgard,7,Fri Mar 16 18:51:38 2012 UTC,"I was actually an adult, probably 18-19 and attending an engineering college full time. It's also why I agree with people who say that engineers are more likely to become religious, since I saw so many during my time.  My roommate was a fundamentalist Christian, and I was brought into it by going to Bible studies and church with him (as a way of being social and friendly). When you really start getting deep into Christianity, where it is a fundamental part of your everyday life and not just a general claim you make when you attend your boring sermon on Sunday, it can really get to to you in many ways.  I can remember sitting in the small church. It was a small building, not a megachurch at all, with only a few attendees but they were all regulars and quite devoted. I can remember services with constant music playing, and people waving their arms in the air. People closing their eyes and praying out loud, or falling to the ground and speaking in tongues, or crying, or laying hands on you or just collapsing ""slain in the spirit"". When all this is going on, there are all sorts of emotions you can feel. I could feel elation at times, or feel mysterious forces in the room. I could close my eyes and 'feel' God. The most similar experiences I've had outside of religion would have to be drug induced. I could hear God in my mind, and he would tell me things. They always tended to be things I already knew I needed to do, but they felt so real. God was real. It was obvious and self-evident. I couldn't stand those atheists who refused to open their hearts and let God in.  That's the power of charismatic Christianity and religions. With the right influences and music and emotions, you can easily get results. And for those who don't feel these effects, they pretend to feel or understand, just so they can fit in with their peers. There were times when I was with a group of friends and they would experience the sensation of a demon or evil force nearby. Even when I couldn't feel anything, I would claim I could. I just believed my own faith and vision was insufficient, but I had to trust them and trust God. It would be wrong and evil to speak against the spiritual battles I knew had to be occurring all around me.  I tend to empathize with the 'villains' in these sorts of comic scenarios, because I was once one of them. I was intelligent, but I was immersed in a culture and world that overwhelmed common sense. My wife says I was brainwashed, but I don't think it was quite that bad. But I was only able to open my eyes and really question my beliefs after I had left college and was no longer part of that sort of community."

What sort of things did you hear that .. led you to think that it was a god, and not just your consciousness wrapped up in the heat of the moment? Why would things that you already know, in what I'm assuming is your inner dialogue, convince you at the time? Did you try and apply any rationality at the time or were you so swept up in things? Are there things now, when you look back, that you had wished you had asked yourself?

I mean I even knew that as a kid, he was just my favorite toy. Why don't these religious people get a dog, and talk to their dog? Dogs always listen and they are actually there.

They just don't get it, after all, and probably never will. Sucks to be them.  There is no physical manifestation of the deity, obviously, but it is easy to trick yourself into believing there is. Ignoring coincidence, or labeling normal occurrences as divine intervention is as easy as getting dressed in the morning.   An example might be seeing something you were just talking to God about, and getting goosebumps. You immediately give God an inner wink, nudge, we cool brah, and marvel to everyone about how amazing it was. On the way home you tell God how awesome he is and how much you love him."

It's like being mentally raped. Giving up the belief that you'll live forever is also pretty traumatic. It took me a solid 2 years to come to terms with that.  I come from a massive family (mom is one of 14 kids) that is at least 4 generations deep in being indoctrinated from birth into christianity.  I'm one of maybe 2 or 3 family members, out of over a hundred, that have given it up. It is incredibly hard, even when you have a scientific background.  My brother (a doctor), my dad (an engineer), many others with jobs that require logical, rational thought, are all ""all in"" with christianity still. It defies everything they normally believe. On top of that, many of them, like my brother and dad are extremely skeptical by personality.  But they still can't grasp that they're talking to nothing, walking with nothing. It's not an option to them. I know when I was younger I forced myself to think this way too. I didn't want to disappoint my parents.  Now that I'm on the outside, looking in, I can't believe I lasted so long. It's so unbelievably crazy and illogical to believe something that has no proof at all. If anything positive has come out of it, it's that I know better than to do something that cruel to my kids. Frankly, it's abuse."

That's not to say that I'm a Christian by any means.

We aren't evolved to see the world as it really is. We are evolved to assume there is something out there because that helped us avoid predators (for example).

I think I can say with some certainty that most (if not all) atheists of an intellectual persuasion are willing to admit that they accept that there is a possibility that a theoretical god of some kind might exist.... but only in the same way that a teapot might be orbiting the sun in the asteroid belt.  There isn't any particular reason to believe that a cosmic teapot is orbiting the sun, but we can't rule out the possibility with absolute certainty.   Conversations about god aren't usually about ""god"" - they are about ""God"", with the big G.  When you define the characteristics of God, then that god's existence becomes more and more testable. For instance, I can say with a high degree of certainty that the existence of the literal god of the christian holy books does not exist."

I don't know how well this has been studied, but there are always spikes of reports after popular movies come out and the reports tend to bear resemblances to the movie in subtle ways.   This is very anecdotal, but what I draw from this is that the brain is very malleable thing.  Even a completely healthy brain is subject to many effects that both modify perceptions as they happen and memories of those perceptions.  That's why police interview every witnesses immediately and without letting any of them talk together.   There have been studies that show witnesses that get together as a group end up telling very stories with much fewer differences then those who have not.  Both groups, the control and the test group fully believe that they are telling the truth despite remembering something that didn't happen.   Sorry, I'm rambling. My point is that memories are flexible and perceptions are often wrong.

What I'm saying is that, just like with this other guy, you're going to have a very hard time totally convincing me that there's nothing ""out there.""   Do you believe in ghosts? When I was younger, I heard a sound that sounded like a voice. It said one word that I couldn't even make out and I swear it was right next to my head. At the same time there was a motion outside. Is that enough for you to convince you that there was a ghost? Are you sure that I didn't as a kid just hear my parents say something muffled, and that the wind didn't blow a tree? Or is it just as likely that I, as a 10 year old child, did in fact witness a ghost or a monster. What's more likely.

Can I prove that there isn't an invisible pink unicorn standing in the room? No, no I can't. But I'm pretty sure that there isn't. I'm pretty sure, but can't be certain. Let's say I'm about as certain that there isn't a god as I am about the existence of an invisible tea pot that circles the earth, or the pink unicorn, or leprechauns, or what ever other such nonsense.   Now, why would I believe in something that I'm reasonably sure doesn't exist?  And why would I want to believe in something that hides itself from almost everybody almost all the time, but still has the ability to control things. Why would I want to worship or believe in such a miserable thing that allows a school bus full of children to smack into a concrete wall at 100km/h. Why would I want to believe in or worship something that allows so much death and destruction and evil, all of it in the natural world without any cause by humans.   Honestly, and I say this sincerely - if you're in your late teens or early 20s, this is a time that schizophrenia presents itself. If you are having hallucinations, hearing voices, check with your doctor. Science can and will help you. Praying to some non-existent entity won't get you anywhere, especially if you aren't praying to the invisible pink unicorn (or the teapot, the teapot is also a good choice.)"
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,qz6an,GrowdonTreeman,1 point,Mon Mar 19 18:21:27 2012 UTC,"I appreciate your concern, but I've explored the schizophrenia possibility pretty extensively, and I cannot bring myself to accept it as an explanation. There are too many inconsistencies. I am 25, so I'm past the age where I should be full-on crazy. I exhibit none of the classic signs of schizophrenia (I've never been the slightest bit unsocial, spacey, or paranoid), and many of my friends and family refer to me as the most stable, grounded person that they know. On top of all this, I have had appointments with three different psychiatrists, one of which I scheduled right after an experience with hearing the voice. None of those psychiatrists believed that I displayed anything more serious than mild ADHD. Taking all this into account, and taking into account that only 1% of people are affected by schizophrenia, I cannot reasonably accept this as explanation.  Having studied developmental psychology in college, I know that a 10-year-old has a far shakier grasp on reality than someone even 2 years older, so no, you wouldn't convince me to believe in ghosts with that story. But what if that story had a 20-year-old? What if instead of being late at night, it was mid-day? What if there had been no parents or trees around to account for the voice? I have to say, I would take that story much more seriously.  Also, you seem to be making some assumptions that I'd like to address:   First, you talk as though you must come to a conclusion about a higher power or non-physical entity (or whatever) existing. You've drawn a line in the sand, and you seem to be saying ""I either believe it or I don't."" This seems to me to be a gross oversimplification of the issue. There are shades of grey here. All I am suggesting is that there is something going on here that science cannot or will not address, and that, in my experience, it sure seems like an intelligent interaction with a being of some sort. Now, you don't have to believe that, especially not based on my word alone, but it seems like a pretty big logical leap to just say, with certainty, that there is no possibility of anything else out there.   Second, you talk as though ""it sounds ridiculous"" is a good reason to disbelieve something. It's not. Platypuses sound ridiculous. Flying machines sounded ridiculous. The internet, which we are speaking through right now, at one time sounded ludicrous. You can make your invisible pink unicorn and flying spaghetti monster analogies all day, but when you get right down to it, it's just not a good argument. I'm well aware of how ridiculous my experiences sound, but that has no bearing on whether or not I experienced them.  And finally, you seem to be assuming that I am a Christian. While I do find a lot of Christian theology appealing, and I haven't ruled their explanations out, I do not identify with any particular religion. As atheists have pointed out to me before, my experiences could just as easily be attributed to Zeus as they could be to Jesus (and further, I find that I generally don't really like Christians). As such, I am not suggesting that this entity (or whatever it is) should be worshiped, nor am I suggesting that it is inherently good. Your example about the school bus full of children would seem to suggest otherwise, at least by our understanding of ethics. That is, of course, assuming that this being has some ability to control the world or human actions, which is another assumption that I'm not sure I'm willing to make yet.   Anyway, I'm pretty certain that I'm not crazy. If you have any other ideas about how I can explain my experience, I'd like to hear them. I'm always looking for something that I haven't thought of."

I'd say you jumped to a ridiculous conclusion (as ridiculous as the pink unicorn or invisible teapot). I'd say it's much more likely your mind played a trick on you, rather than saying it's some sort of supernatural entity. This explanation, while not complete (we don't have a complete understanding of the brain, or consciousness), is a much more probable explanation than a supernatural entity.  Google mind tricks, illusions, etc. Watch Penn and Teller. Your brain will be fooled. If some magicians can trick you, and they aren't even in your head, imagine what your brain can do."

I'd spent the whole night rolling hard, and I was coming down during the bus ride back to the hotel.  There were two Australian dudes, a chick from NYC, a British guy, and me from the New Orleans area.  The British guy finds out I'm from New Orleans and starts going off on how ""We deserved Katrina because Americans use too much oil"" and ""You're killing the planet like a bunch of wankers"".  I tried to tell him that I didn't have a car, but he just kept insulting me and saying horrible things.  It was obvious that I was already in a strange mental state, and this guy was bringing up some pretty painful stuff, all of the other people kept trying to get him to shut his mouth, and I'm just trying to keep myself from yelling at him.  He says ""I think maybe seeing all those dead people will show you guys what you're doing to the fucking planet.""  I was about ready to snap, when one of the Aussie guys, who'd not been involved in the conversation at all, leans forward and goes ""Well you know what I Think?  I think that you're a fuckin' cunt!""  And everyone laughed at the guy.  Yeah.  Aussies are cool.  Fuck the British. Generalizations for the win."

The amount of people who can't grasp even basic logical constructs is soul crushing. I mean... I'm not saying I'm perfect (far from it), but this is absolutely insane.  I try pretty hard to pick mildly clever people to surround myself with, but my friends don't always do the same. As a result, I have something like this happen almost weekly...   herp: We don't KNOW how the pyramids were made. The only logical answer is ancient astronauts.  me:umm... that's not a logical answer, much less the only one.  herp: Yes it is. We're missing so much evidence for how they made the pyramids. Ancient astronauts are the only reasonable explination.  me: well... actually we have a pretty damn good idea of how they built them. The logical answer is that humans did it somehow, because we have plenty of evidence that points toward that. But jumping straight to aliens doesn't make sense. Just because we're missing some evidence for how humans did it, doesn't mean it was aliens. A lack of evidence for one thing, doesn't necessarily constitute evidence for another.  herp: stop being an asshole. you're just being rude and an asshole.  me: how am I being rude? or an asshole?  herp: pfft... obviously you must be of low breeding if you can't figure out that you're rude and are an asshole.  me: You make a claim. I point out a major flaw in your reasoning. The worst I did was disagree with you. You then call me an asshole and rude. I ask for an explanation, and you then start insulting my family, and call me rude and an asshole again... Do you not see the issue here?   herp: There you go, just keep being an asshole.

Here's a run down of what happened on mine though this has nothing to do with religion or Atheism   You can read below or go to the post it self  WARNING WALL OF TEXT INCOMING  I want to first start off by saying I am a dude, and I grew up in a very open minded house hold. My sister work for NARAL in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She's the best sister I could have ever asked for, and I love what she does.  So here is the quote word for word of what my friend has said  Him:   Unlike the hacks that devote their lives to getting all of their political news from MSNBC, CNN, ABC, half-witted liberal media comedians (Bill Maher, Jimmy Kimmel, Leno, kieth olbermann, Lettermen... and the list goes on), Huffington Post, Media Matters, etc, I can honestly say that I both heard Rush's entire show live and then read the transcript again later. I would love a liberal to explain to me where he went wrong, because I'm not seeing it. Rush was simply stating that by us tax payers paying for her birth control we are paying for her to have sex. We obviously aren't the ones getting the sex but doesn't that make Sandra a 'slut' since she is wanting the tax payers to pay her to have free-of-responsibility sex? Hmm... makes sense to me. Did the left media call out for Bill Maher, Letterman, Leno, and Kimmel to apologize for their sexist comments towards Sara Palin? And why does the left media get to make sexist comments and still get support from women's rights groups while the right constantly get bashed by women's rights groups and labeled as sexists and misogynists. Hmmm... seems a bit bias doesn't it? This whole birth control issue has been completely fabricated by the left wing. Obama has been shown in the latest polls to have lost many women voters, which is why they needed to fabricate a political issue that 'some' women care about. It is amazing how the left media outlets fail to call out their own when they step over the line unlike many right media outlets which tend not to show near as much constraint such as Bill O'Reilly's (Conservative News Anchor, Fox News) constant criticism of questionable decisions of President Bush. Rush you have my full support and shame on the sponsors that pulled out. Keep on exposing the leftists for the cowards that they are. I'm going to put together a list of Rush's sponsors and contact information. The liberals have started boycotting these sponsors into pulling out. Those of us who are conservative should voice our opinion to the sponsors who pulled out and praise those who are standing their ground.   This is what I responded with.  Me:   Hey NameHere here are my thoughts on the whole thing.    The specific legislation Rush is referencing is the ""Blunt Amendment"" which, if it had passed, would allow employers of all faiths free to ax ANY essential medical procedures to which the executive objects. It's not hard to see how prenatal care for single pregnant women could be in jeopardy. So could HIV testing, in vitro fertilization or vaccines for kids. Birth control should be considered basic health care coverage; while preventing pregnancy IS reason enough to have it insured, many use birth control for reasons OTHER than preventing pregnancy. After pregnancy prevention (86%), the most common reasons women use the pill include reducing cramps or menstrual pain (31%); menstrual regulation, which for some women may help prevent migraines and other painful “side effects” of menstruation (28%); treatment of acne (14%); and treatment of endometriosis (4%). Additionally, some 762,000 women who have never had sex use the pill, and they do so almost exclusively (99%) for non-contraceptive reasons. Many MARRIED women use birth control; otherwise we'd all be part of some frightening Duggar's-esque family of 20. Rush seems to believe that contraception is taken any time a woman has sex; this is not true. A woman takes birth control every day, regardless of whether or not she is engaging in sex, to regulate her hormones. If she continuously misses her dosage it could have dire consequences on her future fertility and health. It's not ""fabricated"" - this agenda is being set by ALEC and women's rights groups are responding in kind.   Hope thing are going well :)   And then here come the shit storm I don't know how to respond to.  Him:   All of the time you spent writing all of that out and yet all of it is completely irrelevant to my post. If you are going to contribute to the discussion please do not de-rail the thread. I’ll address the opinions and misstated facts posted above with hard facts found in evidence, in just a minute, however first let me address the information you posted about Rush. 1.  Have you actually heard the episode of the Limbaugh show and/or read the full transcripts which the controversial statements were made? Judging by your comments, I would say that you are firing off on someone that you know nothing about. Rush Limbaugh was NOT referring to the “Blunt Amendment”. He was referring to Sandra Fluke’s testimony in front of congress. While the “Blunt Amendment” and ObamaCare battling it out may be the spotlight issue and part of the reason Fluke got to speak in front of congress in the first place, Rush’s comments were directly centered at Fluke. Fluke stated that her birth control pills which are being used solely for contraceptive purposes are costing her about $3000 over the course of her law school studies. Anyone ever heard about the $9 a month Sprintec or Trisprintec you can get at either Wal-Mart or Target? Hmmm… she must not be a very good bargain shopper. With those prices she’d be paying well less than $500 over her law school enrollment.  Rush made the statement Sandra Fluke wants her birth control paid for by someone else, meaning that she wants other people to pay for her sex. Doesn’t that make her a slut? It makes her a free loader, that’s for certain. Why the sense of entitlement? Isn’t feminism supposed to be about women standing tall for themselves and not looking for assistance from man, government or any other entity. http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203370604577263271726764402.html  http://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/birth-control-pills  2.  Going back to your statement “Rush seems to believe that contraception is taken any time a woman has sex”. This only reiterates my statement above about firing off on someone that you know nothing about. Rush was using the term “birth control” not “contraceptives” when saying that she was having so much sex that she cannot afford it. Birth control is many different things, not just pills. Birth control can be condoms, spermicides, and even NFP. Rush was simply making the point that she wants the tax payers to pay for her sex life so that she can have as much free-of-responsibility sex as she pleases at someone else’s expense. That would be like tax payers paying for video games so that some people can sit on their ass all day and play video games while others go to work.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control   Now that those issues have been address I’ll address the untrue statements above about contraceptive pills and birth control. You stated that birth control is used by 14% of those that use it to treat acne. This is partially untrue. Birth control is used to treat only one type of acne, and it is considered by most doctors, a last resort, due to possible side effects. Other than that it is used to prevent pregnancy during the use of Accutane (Isotretinoin) because of Accutane’s birth defect side effects. You also said “Birth control should be considered basic health care coverage; while preventing pregnancy IS reason enough to have it insured…” Is it really? It is easy to tell someone else to pay for something if you aren’t the one paying for it, but is it responsible to do so? Why the sense of entitlement? “Many MARRIED women use birth control…” Yeah, you are right many MARRIED women use some form of birth control whether it be contraceptive pills, condoms, NFP, etc. Does that mean that we should make a government mandate for insurance companies to pay for it and/or tax payers to pay for it? Why the sense of entitlement? “If she continuously misses her dosage it could have dire consequences on her future fertility and health…” CONTRACEPTIVE PILLS have consequences on her future fertility and health among other side effects. “It’s not ‘fabricated’ – this agenda is being set by ALEC and women’s rights groups are responding in kind.” This statement is very naïve and needs a strong fact check. If you look back to January of this year prior to the Stephanopolus/Romney interview, contraception was a rarely discussed political topic. During the interview Stephanopolus asked Romney if he believed that a state had the right to ban birth control. After this quick jab by the leftist media, we got Obama trying to force birth control costs on all institutions despite moral beliefs. After that failed we now get ObamaCare funded by the tax payer giving out free birth control and a mandate which requires insurance companies to fork over the costs for free birth control which then will be reflected by their rising premiums which the working class will pick up. To say this wasn’t fabricated is like saying the sky isn’t blue. The liberals saw an exploit and they went after it. It is just that simple.  http://sowellread.wordpress.com/2012/03/01/romney-is-not-the-idiot-here-folks/  I like to keep everything as close to the facts as possible so if you respond to one of my posts please supply the facts necessary to back up your arguments next time."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,qkhvw,DoctaWorm,3,Wed Mar 7 02:57:53 2012 UTC,"Him again:    I believe it is you who has not read Fluke’s entire transcript or perhaps you read it and did a poor job of actually interpreting it. I like to keep things factual and backed by evidence so here is the transcript of her spiel.  http://abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/statement-Congress-letterhead-2nd%20hearing.pdf   Sandra Fluke does not reference herself other than finances, but she advocates for a group of women who want to receive free birth control. Maybe you’re on to something much bigger here… Sandra isn’t a slut she’s the pimp. Let me ask you this… do you not believe in the causes for which you advocate for? If Sandra didn’t believe in the government mandating free birth control she wouldn’t be at a mock hearing in front of congress. As for the comment “Fluke wasn’t talking about sex at all”, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to look at a few excerpts from her spiel, a few numbers and see that something isn’t adding up. Take these next few quotes for example which I will break down and translate for you.  For the sake of your argument, let’s use the NSFG numbers you copied and pasted word for word from paragraph 2 of this website.  http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2011/11/15/index.html   So 86% of women that use the pill do so for contraceptive purposes  Let’s see what Sandra has to say:  “When I look around my campus, I see the faces of the women affected, and I have  heard more and more of their stories. . On a daily basis, I hear from yet another  woman from Georgetown or other schools or who works for a religiously  affiliated employer who has suffered financial, emotional, and medical burdens  because of this lack of contraceptive coverage. And so, I am here to share their  voices and I thank you for allowing them to be heard.”  … and on…  “Without insurance coverage, contraception can cost a woman over $3,000 during  law school. For a lot of students who, like me, are on public interest scholarships,  that’s practically an entire summer’s salary. Forty percent of female students at  Georgetown Law report struggling financially as a result of this policy. One told  us of how embarrassed and powerless she felt when she was standing at the  pharmacy counter, learning for the first time that contraception wasn’t covered,  and had to walk away because she couldn’t afford it. Women like her have no  choice but to go without contraception. Just last week, a married female student  told me she had to stop using contraception because she couldn’t afford it any longer. Women employed in low wage jobs without contraceptive coverage face the same choice”  … and on…  “These denials of contraceptive coverage impact real people. In the worst cases,  women who need this medication for other medical reasons suffer dire  consequences. A friend of mine, for example, has polycystic ovarian syndrome  and has to take prescription birth control to stop cysts from growing on her ovaries.  Her prescription is technically covered by Georgetown insurance because it’s not  intended to prevent pregnancy. Under many religious institutions’ insurance plans,  it wouldn’t be, and under Senator Blunt’s amendment, Senator Rubio’s bill, or  Representative Fortenberry’s bill, there’s no requirement that an exception be  made for such medical needs.” For one let me say that if $3000 is a summer’s salary and you are attending Georgetown, scholarship or not, you have bigger fish to fry. Secondly, if 40% of women of Georgetown report struggling financially because Georgetown doesn’t pay for their contraception… wait a minute didn’t we just say that 86% of the women that use the pill do so for contraceptive (non-health related issues). How much of that 40% is using it for medical reasons. Sandra even states that Georgetown covers her friend’s birth control because she has polycystic ovarian syndrome. Sandra flaunts the issues that her peers face because Georgetown denies them birth control even though Georgetown covers medical related birth control. If Georgetown provides medical birth control, then what else are they expecting? Sounds to me like someone wants their sex life funded. I stick by what I have said. I fail to see how her Georgetown experiences dictate the needs of the real world. It sounds as if her real issue is with Georgetown and not the “Blunt Amendment”. It is not as if there are not legitimate health reasons for using birth control and in many cases those are covered by various insurance companies hired by the private sector. If you actually dissect what you read instead of reading it at a high-level then it isn’t difficult to see that Fluke’s testimony was a loaded pile of shit with a side of “write me a check, please”.  As for your cynical, typical liberal, lowly, snide, sneaky, comment about Limbaugh’s pain medication addiction, at least he didn’t get up in front of congress and ask the government to fund his Oxycontin addiction. I expected better from you.   This was all on Facebook yesterday mind you... I haven't replied since."

Dover is (imho) the biggest legal smackdown of the whole ID (cough...creationism) movement and leaders.    Yes there are current happenings in this regard, but they will almost certainly be smacked down just the same.  There are some cases where they are trying to shoehorn ID into the schools, but there is a mountain of precedent that says teaching creationism in public schools is unconstitutional.  They hardly even try that one anymore.  Also, as a few other people have said so far, biblical literalism is a very modern idea (~200 years...ish).  The early Christians argued greatly over which versions of the gospels and other texts were correct and which were not; they literally assembled the bible book by book over those early post-Jesus centuries.

You're right, of course, the trial concluded in favor of proponents of Science.

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,q12kh,ss5gogetunks,7,Thu Feb 23 01:33:40 2012 UTC,You can make fake bones and grow the meat around them. Prest-o! Synthetic ribs.

The last time I heard about this tech the reporting said they just needed DNA samples, but I figured there would be far more to it than was being told at the time.   Still though, I would be willing to eat this meat. And there's still a possibility of eating previously forbidden meats, from human to endangered species (you could even eat extinct species if the stem cell cultures are started before we lose the last members)"
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,q12kh,HiddenKrypt,1 point,Thu Feb 23 01:39:44 2012 UTC,DNA samples and stem cells I think. Maybe I'm wrong though. As long as I understand it and know that it is actually as safe as it will be claimed to be I will eat it. It is probably going to be even more environmentally sound than veggie meats (although i'll still eat mostly plants)
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,q12kh,ss5gogetunks,2,Thu Feb 23 03:23:57 2012 UTC,"That's pretty much how I feel about it, to be honest. I'm mostly vegetarian as a way of reducing my fat/cholesterol intake (the ethical concerns are a factor to a smaller degree as well), so I wouldn't dive into synthetic meat land or anything.  I'd give it a go though if it comes out the same in the end with everything they've been promising."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,q12kh,HiddenKrypt,1 point,Thu Feb 23 06:03:58 2012 UTC,"It is possible that they will create it without fat/cholesterol. I mean, it won't need either of those if it is lab grown because it will have it's own nutrient distribution system from the lab.  That said fat/cholesterol is part of what gives it flavor. While the thought grosses me out now, probably my favorite part of steak when I still ate it was the fatty chunks."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,q12kh,ss5gogetunks,2,Thu Feb 23 06:10:05 2012 UTC,"I never liked the fatty chunks, but yeah, the fat in and throughout the meat, even the lean portions, is what gives it flavor. they're going to have to solve that issue if they want synthmeat to be competitive with the real thing. Also, I just decided that I really like the term synthmeat. That's what we're going to call it. Because somehow I have the power to decided these things."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,q12kh,HiddenKrypt,1 point,Thu Feb 23 06:12:40 2012 UTC,"Now the thought of fatty chunks makes me sick to my stomach. But I used to love it as a kid. idk why.  that's a big thing I'm going to have to get over before eating synthmeat (I like the term too) but if I can get over that, I will totally try it out. It solves all my moral issues."

Not all vegetarians are rational just like not all atheists are rational.  Test-tube meat seems kind of gross to me but I will still consider it when it is available. I mean there's no real logical reason to be against it.  Also she's wrong, not all stem cells come from abortions. Still though, that part is bad, if you're going to go for no killing at all then abortions would be a part of that. Plus then creatures still need to be kept for the purpose of creating the foetuses that the stem cells come from. Assuming they use foetal stem cells of course."

I did it every night for probably two weeks... It worked."

If I had a flash of fear I would stand my ground and think about it. Instead of running away or turning a light on I'd move out of the dark area slowly while thinking through it.

It doesn't just tell a story, it tells your story.  It forces you to face your fears of the unknown and overcome them if you want to finish it.  One of the best books I've ever read.  I am recently re-reading it now that I found a PDF version (I've lent out three of my copies, only to never see them again)."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,puj8t,KiraWonrey,5,Sun Mar 25 21:47:17 2012 UTC,"Haha.  Even though I'm atheist I was living at my ex-girlfriend's place, a house she claimed had been inhabited by satan worshipers.  Naturally I don't give any fucks.  But, one night we go to sleep and I shut the door.  Upon waking up, the door is wide open and her clothes from the hamper are strewn all about the room.  Then the next day I put a pad of paper on the banister (it's got a very large wooden top portion to it, totally flat) while I'm looking for a pen because I want to take the pad up stairs and jot down some lyrics (musician, etc).  And as I am doing that I come back and the pad is on the floor.  No breeze, no open windows, nothing to explain either occurrence that I could see.  Of course I figure there is an explanation, but it still freaked me out for a couple weeks.  As a side story, her little girl used to watch tv in her room and refused to go to sleep.  So I was like, why don't we try to have the tv downstairs and not let it be a distraction?  She doth protest and claims there are monsters in her room at night.  I'm like, there's no such thing as monsters!  If I had known she meant, REAL monsters, then I would have let her keep the tv."

But where I live they gives us ALL the day off for these sorts of major holidays. Well most of them but I'm not going to bitch about a paid day off.

Go fuck your self-righteous...self.   You would prefer to attack me rather then have a rational discussion about the issue?  You know who else is well known for doing that?"

Besides, our patients are almost all ""out patients"" (not in the hospital, which we call ""house patients""), and they come every weekday for 6 weeks. Treatment takes 15 minutes. There's no reason the clergy can't visit them at home.   I don't know what hospital policy is for in hse pts. It could be clergy gets free parking. However, one could argue that their church should pay for parking passes. It's not like their parishoners aren't donating money to help the poor, needy etc.  I was very respectful. Hard to show that in rage comics - they usually express how you feel, not look. I told him only treatment patients got stamped. We have a lot of folks who would lie to get stamped. Once he pressured me futher, I gave more info to explain why I couldn't stamp it.  Our depatment, not the hospital, pays for the parking out of our own budget. For instance, chemo chooses not to give their pts free parking which I think is wrong.  We have since worked to avoid the pressures and fraud by having the validation done right in the treatment room, so only the patient gets the ticket. I'd even get old patients showing up asking for a ticket to pay for their parking while they go to other appts!!! Not even on treatment anymore!"

Partly, it's because I have a high BS tolerance! LOL I don't let mean and difficult people set me off. I just go home and crank about it! I remember, lo, those many 16+ years ago when I started here. One lady came to the desk complaining that we were way behind. She really upset me and I got teary eyed. She saw that, came back, and said, ""I'm sorry if I was mean to you. I am upset in general right now. I am not the patient - my 10 year old daughter is!""  I learned a very important lesson that day. Sometimes people are mean here just because they are mad they have cancer, or are upset or whatever. It's not personal. We all need to watch our own behaivior, yes, to be sure we are not the problem. But often it's just not you.  I look at a mean patient and say, ""A: this person is just a mean asshole or B: they are mean b/c they are upset or C. they are a mean asshole who is now meaner b/c they are upset! I cannot know which it is, so I will assume B or C.""  Once a ""mean asshole,"" who never spoke a word to me that he didn't have to or crack a smile once gave me a card and a huge box of chocolates on his last day of treatment. He thanked me for making it so much nicer for him.  Lesson there, too.  TL;DR: Treat all the patients like they are your family, neighbors or friends, and as if they are sweeter than pie in the real world. You and they will be happier. Oh, and rage at home on on here!

From the post, even employees have to pay, and I'd assume the doctors also end up paying as well.  The patients don't pay because the place OP works at doesn't want to burden the patients with all those extra costs. If they had to start giving free parking to anyone, then they'd be spending more money on guests and visitors than the patients.  The post shows that religious people expect preferential treatment because of what they do. If ""mental therapy"" was a reason for free parking, then I'd make the claim that any vistor of mine is considered ""mental therapy"" and thus they shouldn't pay."

Clearly you don't have an understanding of evolution. It was a mutation that occurred sometime after Homo erectus, in which the phenotype of ONE individual organism varied to a degree wherein it was distinctly human- either by having a larger brain capacity or something else from what I remember about learning about Human evolution. It wasn't enough to be reproductively isolated- meaning unable to reproduce with any other member of a similar species, OTHERWISE these adaptations wouldn't have been inherited. Essentially, the first Homo sapien was in fact able to reproduce with the early Homo sapien who I believe they were called ""Archaic Homo sapiens"", so reproductive isolation had not occurred and this barely-distinct feature would have been inherited to the Homo sapien we see and love today.  Evolution isn't the reason why Abrahamic religions are incompatible with modern science or, indeed, modern civilisation. It's outdated and entirely non factual. If it was the word of God, he wouldn't put the story of the origin of mankind as just that- a in-factual story. As a believer, I always thought evolution was an extension of God's way of making life. They are DIRECTLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SAME STORY.  Don't kid yourself that God would put out a story for something so FREAKING IMPORTANT.  Sorry about getting back to you so late.

This ranges from abstinence-only sex education (don't have sex ever until after you're straight married, and only to make babies) to comprehensive sex ed (while abstinence is the only 100% effective form of birth control and 100% effective way to avoid getting an STD/STI, here are some other things you can do to prevent them if you DO decide to have sex, this is what a healthy relationship should look like, it's natural to have those urges, it's ok to masturbate, etc).

Where I grew up we had Sex ed in our 5th, 7th, 9th and 10th years, each with increasing detail until the 10th which was pretty much ""don't knock someone up/get knocked up"" and ""don't get V.D."" and here's how.  This was in the '70's.  Given that the hillbilly states are 40-60 years behind the times you can expect them to start teaching it any day now.

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,p1h1w,ThrustVectoring,14,Thu Feb 2 16:55:56 2012 UTC,"The problem with meeting God:  You can't really be sure it's ""THE ULTIMATE GOD"". Let's put it this way: If you're blind and can only see shadows, if God showed himself to you, you would only describe a shadow. If you could see in black and white, your God would be in black and white.  SO far all that our imagination is capable of depicting, is based on our limited experiences. So, how do we know that when we meet ""God"", it will be really God, and not some superdimensional being imitating God?  And how do we know this God doesn't have another God above him?  Unless we're all perfect and omniscient, we are by the very same fact, incapable of recognizing God. In this case, it is the moral obligation of ""God"" to be merciful and understand that we have all the right to be skeptical of any deity - especially a deity that, according to the Judeo-Christian tradition, demands a weekly worship, to inflict unnecessary suffering onto ourselves, to act with bigotry towards non-believers, etc.  if I met God, after having the ""supernatural"" experience, I would not necessarily believe - in fact, it is most logical to DOUBT the experience and question my brain.  Any God who refuses to accept that, is by definition acting in an unethical way - and therefore, is not worthy of the worship demanded to us.  If I met God, I would have to meet him along with at least a huge number of non-believers, with undeniable evidence that can be tested independently."

So when they figured out I am pagan, they start asking me all sorts of questions.  Which I answer to the best of my ability.  It's when they start asking about spells and magic.. that's when I start facepalming. lol  ""Can you teach us how to change our hair color like in The Craft!? Is it an easy spell? I heard they asked real wiccans to teach the actors how to cast that spell!""  LOL ""Yeah sure.  It's called Hocus Manic Panic.  You just need to get a bottle of Manic Panic..  and some ""enchanted"" tap water..  make sure you follow the directions on the bottle though! Every spell has specific directions.""     sighs  Some times I don't know what's more annoying.

And if you're a male atheist, you're pretty screwed. You can argue the reasons for it, but there's a ton of atheist guys competing for a much smaller amount of atheist gals. And it's not THAT much better if you are a female atheist. You're still stuck actually finding the other atheists amid the pool of believers and agnostics.   But I think the biggest one for me is an afterlife. I think it wouldn't be much of a hit if I'd started out as an atheist. But having had a certainty that I was essentially immortal? Shit, that's a difficult one to shake. I've made peace with the fact that everything I am will be snuffed out, and that I'll never see the vast number of people that I've cared about who've died again. That they're not enjoying some kind of heavenly reward for having their life cut short in horrible ways, but instead are just snuffed out. And that I'll be experiencing the same some day. It's even worse for the fact that I was stuck with medical problems. So not only do I not get an afterlife, I'm saddled by default with a more miserable time with this one than most people. Sucks in a whole lot of ways.   But, you really can't choose to believe something just because you want to. Or at least I can't. There's no god, and that's pretty much that. No attempt at belief could ever get me past that fact no matter how much happier it'd make me to be a believer."

I was a baha'i as a kid too and I've rarely met nicer people - and not even in that creepy only-nice-to-avoid-eternal-punishment way.  Maybe you had a bad experience with your group?  I like baha'is, although I'm not one anymore. There are a few things I disagree with, like the obligation to accept any ruling made by the Universal House of Justice on matters of faith, or their rejection of gay marriage  Edit: and, of course, the fact that I don't believe in a god. That's another disagreement."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,ovsko,ss5gogetunks,3,Wed Jan 25 18:57:42 2012 UTC,"Depends on the bahai family and community you were in.  It was very indoctrinating in my experiences.  It wasn't the gay marriage thing that turned me away, it was the treatment of women (yes, still unequal) and the double speak about sexuality.  That gays were mentally ill in particular, but mostly that the joke was you needed to have the ""huhullah"" (sp) open to pages (numbers xyz) where it described sex laws in detail lying between two bahai kids in bed in order to prevent premarital sex.  This was treated like a joke.  Here we were, trying to be good little bahai youth when two others were going at it in the hotel room while we (two girls and a guy) were stuck, freezing, on a balcony.  yes, there is a story in that..."

In fact you were encouraged to leave the faith when you were 15, do some research, and come back if you decided that it was correct.   I decided not to come back. To be fair... I stopped going to the meetings before I really could have accurately judged their content. I stopped going after my mom passed away when I was 9. She was the active baha'i in our family.

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,ovsko,Vorpal_Hammer,6,Sun Jan 29 18:00:18 2012 UTC,"I was raised as a Baha’i, also, forced into attending Baha’i Summer Camp for most of my early teen years.  In my experience, it’s basically a sect of Islam that embraces the idea that all religions are messages from the abrahamic god that have become outdated over time. Using this handy intellectual pirouette, Baha’is get to decide which parts of the older religions are false and which parts are authentically divine. This religion held a lot of appeal for the hippies of the sixties and seventies because of its doctrines of peace and unconditional acceptance and tolerance, but I understand that the Baha’I communities that are still left in the US are basically stagnant these days."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,ovsko,nateatwork,4,Wed Jan 25 16:26:27 2012 UTC,I'm so glad that I am not the only one who says that it is a sect of Islam!  Thank you for validating my point.
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,ovsko,Hyaku-Shiki,4,Wed Jan 25 17:39:06 2012 UTC,"I agree with the communities being stagnant.  That was one of the bigger eye-openers for me that led me to atheism.  The Baha'i Faith was supposed to completely conquer the world.  Seriously.  Entry by Troops and all that.  But it was clearly over.  I finally started asking the right questions. It's really not a sect of Islam, though.  They believe in another prohpet (two, in fact) after Muhummad.  That pretty clearly puts them out of the Muslim fold."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,ovsko,Vorpal_Hammer,2,Wed Jan 25 19:25:33 2012 UTC,"I know that they claim to be an independent world religion, but I am not sure that claiming that makes it so. Many of the teachings and cultural aspects are borrowed from Islam. Not drinking alcohol, for example, or not creating representations of the prophet on canvas or on stage are clearly pulled from the Muslim faith. Furthermore, large tracts of Baha’t writings are flagrantly ripped off. Apparently The Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys, a tablet that is usually included with the Baha’I writings, actually has its origins in Sufi Philosophy. The Mormons also believe in a prophet after Christ, but can we all agree that they are really a Christian sect? I am certainly open for argument on this one."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,ovsko,Vorpal_Hammer,3,Wed Jan 25 21:05:09 2012 UTC,"Honestly, I don't know what else besides claiming it could make it so.  If you take your thinking too far than you end up lumping all the Abrahamic religions together as one group, when clearly they have significant differences.  Eh, I don't really care that much in any case.  Early Christians considered themselves to be Jews.  It wasn't until the culture changed that they thought of themselves as a separate religion."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,ovsko,iFuJ,2,Thu Jan 26 16:58:03 2012 UTC,"And, by the way, I had the same experience as you regarding the much anticipated global expansion of the Faith. I bought into this pervasive sense that that the Baha’i Faith would be taking its place amongst the major world religions any day now. That’s clearly never going to happen; they don’t have the divine mandate that they think they do. The Baha’is have overestimated their historical significance to an embarrassing degree."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,ovsko,Vorpal_Hammer,2,Wed Jan 25 21:16:04 2012 UTC,"It's surprising how much people don't know about various religions. I grew up Muslim and I automatically knew I was right so I never bothered to learn the central tenets of any other religion. It wasn't until college, where I began losing my faith, that I started reading up on (and taking classes on) various religions. I learned so much.  There is a Baha'i temple north of Chicago that I visited a year ago. It's very beautiful and peaceful there. Definitely worth a visit for theists and atheists alike."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,ovsko,Vorpal_Hammer,1 point,Wed Jan 25 18:51:55 2012 UTC,"Agreed.  It's a beautiful temple, and no one will bother you there about religion.  At most, someone may had you a pamphlet (though that's pretty unusual), but people aren't really allowed to speak."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,ot4hu,spinningmagnets,9,Tue Jan 24 02:37:09 2012 UTC,"Athiests and fundies should not marry. As far as becoming sexually involved, in spite of fundie policy to abstain from sex until marriage, we all know it happens sometimes.   If you are an athiest and you are in love with a fundie, just being fuck-buddies until one of you finds the person they want to marry and have kids with is a recipe for heartbreak. Suppose you know you don't want to get married, but she gets pregnant and decides she will not have an abortion?  The whole time you are involved with each other, you are shutting yourselves off from a potential relationship with someone else for whom you would both be happy.   Being involved with someone where there is no possibility of a longtime relationship is just being lazy and trading a short-term itch-scratching for long-term happiness.  The worst case scenario is getting married in the hopes that one of you will change. Then having two kids and getting into hock up to your neck so you can buy a house. Working like a dog for several years, and when the differences are finally just too much to bear any longer, you get divorced.  One of you pays child support and alimony, all the money that was put into the house is now gone, and both of you struggle to make ends meet for years. Your wife marries a fundie, who is now raising your kids about 25 days a month.  Fundies should be in relationships with fundies, and athiests should be in relationships with athiests.  I'm not saying don't be friends, but you are lucky you found out now."

There is a house up the street that belonged to a Jewish couple that moved to Israel, they had two refrigerators and two dishwashers (I can't remember if they had two ranges).    I asked a friend who is a cultural Jew, and she said no dairy and meat is a fence law, TPTB made it to be sure that dairy and meat would never be eaten together. So even if it the meat and dairy aren't related (sheep's milk and beef), or if the dish isn't cooked (turkey and cheese sandwich), you can't eat it if you keep kosher."

I know religious people that use the same plate (it is ok to use a glass plate for both AFTER you cleaned her).  In hebrew the law says (law is the correct word?) dont EAT a lamb in his mother's milk and yes somehow people took it to dont eat meat and dairy products.  The bible is divided into ""pshat"" (simple) - the simple law. ""seter"" (secret) - the meaning behind the words.  So the pshat is dont eat a goat in his mothers milk but the seter (the higher meaning)  is dont eat meat and milk (i dont really know how they got from point a to b).  Jews wait six hours between meat and milk but only two hours between milk and meat (maybe its differant in some streams).  The somarian jews practice th bible ""as written"" (pshat) so they only dont eat a lamb in goat's milk.  Edit: Apperantly its dont cook a lamb in his mothers milk."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,osq1t,ReneBelloq,4,Tue Jan 24 00:07:55 2012 UTC,"If you would like to know the answer, you can read this:  The bible, like any other written work can have a myriad of interpretations. Think like the constitution, there are fundamental disagreements among the people, and even supreme court justices of how it is even to be viewed, before even beginning to interpret it.  So too the Torah. There was a book, and there are set rules of how to interpret the words, some by logical induction or extension, some by less logical, but narrow and highly technical means.  Now, based on this, you can now move forward.  So in the Hebrew verse there are two general elements: Gdi (kid) and Chalev Imo (mother's milk).  Basically, it comes down to, is Gdi a narrow term for a goat's young, or any offspring of domesticated animals(cow, sheep goat etc)? (you can see this type of generality in English like ""calf"" although usually young cow, can also mean young elephant or even whale), and in the conclusion it is interpreted to be a more inclusive (or exclusive, if you will).   Mother's milk is interpreted to not mean ""it's very own mother's milk"" but rather, coming to mean ""in milk from a mother"" as in mammals and not fowl etc. (fowl is biblically (but not rabinically) allowed to be cooked with dairy).  Later rabbinical injuctions added the eating together, even if not cooked. etc."

And I think my interpretation of religion is fairly spot on. Sure, my comment was directed at this verse - but it can be applied to other verses. You can't ignore that the bible was written roughly 2000 years ago and is filled with nothing but rules, laws to govern and anecdotes to back them up.  I mean really, some legitimate interpretations of this verse mean ""you will not get into heaven if you eat a cheeseburger"".    And what of things like Timothy 2:12 -  ""I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man"".    And Leviticus 11:7-8 - ""And the pig, though it has a divided hoof, does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you. You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses; they are unclean for you.""  Given the context that pork can carry certain diseases/parasites that are not easily detectable, it makes sense to tell the ignorant masses of 2000 years ago to just leave these animals alone.

There's a lot of great scholars who have given us a lot of context, but when you get right down to it, no one knows the whole situation. Often, no one knows who should even be credited with writing a particular section.  This is why people who claim that the Bible is the ""literal, inerrant word of God"" are complete morons. Even if you function under the assumption that there IS a God, and that He DID approve of these writings, a huge chunk of the context (and therefore, meaning) has been lost to us over the years."

I'm Jewish, and there's plenty of bad shit Judaism has done, but it's who I am, so I'm not going to abandon it just because I happen to not believe in gods or the Bible.  It supports anti-homosexuality, sexism, a very ancient concept of justice with regards to killing enemies, and more, but Jewish is who I am even though I repudiate all those things.

The prayers may come from prayer books, or consist of the recitation of the Rosary (a 'Rosary novena'), or of short prayers through the day. There are four recognized categories of novenae: those of mourning, preparation (for a Church feast, ending on the eve of the feast), petition, and indulgenced. A given novena can belong to more than one of these categories. They may be performed in church, at home, or anywhere where prayer is appropriate, though some indulgenced novenas do require church attendance. Sometimes, a special candle is lit at the beginning of the novena which burns during the nine days of prayer."""

My husband is also a former catholic who turned born agin in college. Since our marriage, he has moved from kinda-christian to agnositic.

She's in her 50s and I had to teach her to copy and paste a few months ago! LMAO She could save my life if I had a heart attack at work, but she couldn't fight her way out of a computer shaped paper bag w/o help!  I have worked 16+ years with cancer patients and heard all the crap about god healing or working in mysterious ways. Plus a lot of woo treatments. I find no problem with sharing that.  My father died of cancer and my 47 yr old sister, who has 2 little girls, also has stage IV cancer - technically terminal. However, she is doing very well. They told her stage IV kidney is now kinda considered a ""chronic"" illness and not necessarily terminal.  I have great sympathy for my friends, patients, and family who deal with cancer, but there are times when the idiocy of religion in how it relates to illness should be shown.  I am much more at peace with mortality since I have become non-religious, and I bet a lot of other people would be as well. These comics are to provoke thought, not to make fun.  It's sad to see people dying at work and listen to them hope for god to give them a miracle. It can be quite a hard landing when they reach the end. :("

Though there might have been the occasional early adopter before that as it was Vatican 2 which set things in motion. An individual bishop has the right to choose whether to allow the priests the option of female alter servers.   If the choice is allowed, it's then up to the individual priest whether he'll allow them or not. It's interesting to note though that a priest has the option of saying ""no girls allowed"" but he doesn't have the ability to say ""no boys allowed"" for the server position. That said, at least on the level of the bishops I think it's pretty rare for alter girls to be prohibited in the US."

If god is infinitely powerful than he can create an infinitely heavy rock. Now if he were to do this you would have two infinite and equal opposing forces so they negate each other. So God can create a rock he can't lift but the act of doing so would make the rock weightless.  If iirc my infinite rules correctly this checks out.

If you're loving God and others more than yourself and seeking to further God's kingdom thats really all you need. Everything else is important of course; but Jesus said ""If you love me you will keep my commands"" love comes first. If you love your wife you don't have to try to discern what you should do for her, you just know: your love is the catalyst to your actions. The ""rules"" in the bible are, more or less, to help you; but you have to start with the love part.   Also, God doesn't ""send you to hell"" i mean, he does, but that's really your choice. Rather God gives you over to your desires. If you desire to hate him then he says ok, you can be separated from me for eternity, here you go! If you're trying to understand him and build a relationship with him then he'll help you out.   (if you don't want to read this I don't really expect you to, I just like to talk about it)"

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,obj8b,Mako_Eyes,2,Wed Jan 11 14:23:10 2012 UTC,Where do you draw the line on what to believe and why?
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,obj8b,Quadman,5,Wed Jan 11 15:35:41 2012 UTC,"I don't tend to have trouble with the miracles and such (Jonah surviving being eaten by a huge fish, Jesus feeding 5 thousand people) just because, from a logical standpoint, if God is God, then those things are not beyond Him.  I think the biggest problem with people taking the Bible literally is that they specifically apply commandments and directions to themselves without stopping to consider the context or time period in which it was written.   My favorite example is this: Proverbs 25:21-22 says ""If your enemy is hungry, give him something to eat; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, and the Lord will reward you.""  Now, at first glance, that looks like it means ""be nice to assholes and you'll piss them off and God will high-five you."" I mean, 'burning coals' is not a positive-sounding thing to us. BUT, when you do a little research, you find that in those times, when a fire went out, it was very difficult to re-light. As such, it was common practice to give burning coals to your neighbor, who would usually carry it in a clay jar on their head. When you consider this, it drastically changes the meaning of the verse. You aren't being nice to be a smug ass, you're being nice because you really want to help them. Someone who takes the Bible ""literally"" would never realize this.  So I guess, to answer your question, I think about what I know and what I don't know, and I use that to draw lines, particularly with commandments and instructions. For instance, I don't believe that God intended for Levitical laws to be followed after the time of Jesus, and I don't know what exactly Paul meant when he used the Greek word that is most commonly interpreted as ""homosexual"", therefore I do not believe that Christians have any solid basis for all their anti-homosexual tendencies, and I refuse to judge anyone for something that is, as far as I'm concerned, between them and God.  Sorry for the wall of text, but I've given this a lot of thought, and I don't think less words would do it justice."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,o9urb,Mako_Eyes,2,Tue Jan 10 02:51:35 2012 UTC,"That's the only argument that I saw. She talks a lot more about Christians than Christianity, as far as I can tell. Did you see something that I didn't?"
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,o9urb,hmwith,3,Tue Jan 10 03:08:11 2012 UTC,"It was also talking about the tenets of Christianity being hateful, not just Christians (but that too)."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,o9urb,Mako_Eyes,-3,Tue Jan 10 03:16:52 2012 UTC,"I honestly don't see any tenets listed there that can actually be supported by Biblical texts if you have any sort of brain.   Homosexuality is referenced either in a book that no one pays attention to otherwise (Leviticus) or in such vague terms that it's hard to tell if that's even what they're talking about (Romans and Corinthians). It is never once even remotely suggested that it's a mental illness.  I've looked and looked for the verse that specifically talks about sex before marriage, and I have yet to find it. They mention sex OUTSIDE of marriage, but I always took that to mean cheating on your spouse.  Jesus, the very center of Christian faith, drank wine on a regular basis. I don't know how anyone could think that Christianity condemns drinking.  The idea that women are somehow less than men may seem to be Biblically founded at first glance, but with a little light reading anyone can find that it is simply not true.   Also, I don't know of any Christian who would claim that Jesus is a 'scapegoat', even the stupid ones. Christians believe that Jesus died because of OUR sins, and it's all OUR fault, not the other way around.  Sorry for the rant, I'm just so tired of terrible people misrepresenting my religion to the point where people like you come to believe that my religion actually supports their sick behaviors. It's not true."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,o9urb,studmuffffffin,3,Tue Jan 10 07:08:30 2012 UTC,I guess I should be glad I was not raised Christian then.
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,o9urb,zomby_woof,3,Tue Jan 10 08:10:10 2012 UTC,"For starters, just because people often choose to discount Leviticus doesn't mean it's not part of the Bible. There are plenty who agree with all of it. And even more people take to heart the bits about homosexuality, totally disregarding the rest.  ""Sex outside of marriage"" means sex that's not inside of marriage. It could be before one's wed, or it could be with someone other than a spouse. It doesn't matter.  The writers of the Bible speak against excess, not sipping on a glass of wine.  With a little heavy reading, you'll see that women were treated and disrespected a lot throughout the book. For example, men can sell their daughters into slavery?"
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,o9urb,SorryItsMyFirstDay,-5,Tue Jan 10 10:01:00 2012 UTC,"Please show me someone (who is not a Hassidic Jew) who follows the teachings of Leviticus. Please. Show me where these ""plenty of people"" are, because I have never seen them, nor even heard of them.  If we're getting technical, the term used throughout the Bible is ""adultery."" Would you call anything besides cheating on your spouse ""adultery?"" Just seems odd to me.  I don't really know why you mentioned drinking since we don't seem to disagree.  I assume you're referring to the latter part of Exodus, which talks about the details of slavery, including the case in which it is your daughter. This also falls under ancient laws and customs that NO ONE follows anymore. It's just four books later, in Joshua, that a woman named Rahab is elevated to near-saint status, which was completely unheard of in that historical time period, where women were very much still considered property.  I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish here, but you must realize that I am a pretty frequent Redditor who subscribes to r/atheism and still remains Christian. Do you really think you're going to present an argument that will suddenly convince me that my religion is wrong, even after I've spent the last 5 years listening to every argument that atheists put forward? Do you think you're that guy?"
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,o9urb,Nethius,3,Tue Jan 10 10:49:47 2012 UTC,"Please show me someone... who follows the teachings of Leviticus. Please. Show me where these ""plenty of people"" are, because I have never seen them, nor even heard of them.   Churches that condemn homosexuality include (but are not limited to) The Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox churches, Methodist churches, Reformed Church in America, American Baptist Church, Conservative Evangelical organizations and churches, Evangelical Alliance, Presbyterian Church in America, Southern Baptist Convention, Pentecostal churches such as the Assemblies of God, Restorationist churches, like Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons. Leviticus, Genesis 19:5, Romans 1, I Corinthians 6:8–10, and Jude 1:7 are all believed by some to be anti-homosexuality. [source]   If we're getting technical, the term used throughout the Bible is ""adultery.""   No, if we're getting technical, the word throughout the Bible is actually ""porneia"", which is means the same thing as ""fornication"", according to Google Translate and most others. 1 Cor 7:2 is also commonly viewed as clarification that the term means ""fornication"".   I assume you're referring to the latter part of Exodus, which talks about the details of slavery, including the case in which it is your daughter. This also falls under ancient laws and customs that NO ONE follows anymore.   You claimed, ""The idea that women are somehow less than men may seem to be Biblically founded at first glance, but with a little light reading anyone can find that it is simply not true."" I'm discounting that. While you don't personally agree with what the Bible says about women and many people ignore those parts, it doesn't change the fact that the Bible says those things. Also, people follow many other ancient, outdated customs from the Bible.   Do you really think you're going to present an argument that will suddenly convince me that my religion is wrong, even after I've spent the last 5 years listening to every argument that atheists put forward? Do you think you're that guy?   A) I'm not a male. I'm trying really, really hard to not make a joke here about the previous point.  B) I'm not trying to convince you of anything.

Now what if I told you everything you know about him is a lie, and in fact, he was evil and killed millions of slaves. How do you respond? I'm assuming something along the lines of ""No way, there's evidence to prove he was good.""  Well that's exactly how propaganda works. To the oppressed people, such as in North Korea, they only know what the government wants them to know. If the gov is to tell them Kim Jong Il invented the lightbulb and there was evidence generated with no one to tell them otherwise, they would believe this...  People under communist nations/dictatorships were indoctrinated into believing what the government wanted them to believe.. they had NO way to know the truth other than what was said...

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,o8sx5,degenererad,2,Mon Jan 9 22:32:44 2012 UTC,"Actually that's not necessarily true.. While they weren't aware of the many evil things their leaders have done, through my parents' knowledge, the leaders (in Russia specifically) weren't regarded as ""gods"". People merely abided by what the leaders did in large part of fear, (with Stalin) and because they had no reason not to, as they didn't know any better. But they didn't replace gods with their leaders. And maybe some did regard them as deities, they still did not believe in evolution or any other religious facts.

And the newsletters are interesting, indeed - if I were a doctor focused on writing about economical issues in the same time as he was involved in DC politics, not reading through every article of his newsletter which he did not edit seems reasonably petty.

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,o7bi9,mirex0_0,83,Sun Jan 8 12:44:01 2012 UTC,"I deeply respect his nature of ignoring what people want him to say and representing what he truley feels is best. I think he is genuine and honest. I even agree with a fair amount of what he says.  However, the substance of what he stands for in many areas seems naive and dangerous. Ignoring the completely obvious title of this article, it sheds light on why I would be hard-pressed to vote for Ron Paul.  He favors ultimate personal freedom to the point of allowing corporate censorship rather than government censorship. He thinks things like minimum wage, civil liberties legislation, and government education aid are detrimental to society as they impinge on personal rights to run your property how you see fit. He has never voted for anything that contained funding for Planned Parenthood and thought DADT was a good policy.  He thinks that government aided tuition is ridiculous and serves no purpose because, in his words, ""just think of all this willingness to want to help every student get a college education... [when] we don't have any jobs for them."" Apparently education is useless for anything but getting a job; never-mind creating a more intelligent, innovative populace with the ability to better interpret reality."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,o7bi9,gamemogul,27,Sun Jan 8 00:22:48 2012 UTC,"If the government stopped funding tuitions, wouldn't the price of higher education plummet to very affordable levels within a short period of time, probably less than four years?  If colleges know that it doesn't matter how much they raise their prices, the government will still pay for it...they'll keep raising their prices. That's one reason why college tuition fees have grown by over 400% since 1982 (and that's AFTER adjusting for inflation)"
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,o7bi9,BrosephDudeson,13,Sun Jan 8 01:35:26 2012 UTC,"Maybe tuition would drop, but they would probably also cut programs and simultaneously increase the # of students they admit, so you have classes totally filled. The are already core courses that are so overcrowded that one auditorium watches the professor's lecture via webcam in different buildings. Sure, you get the material, but a few decades ago students actually got to know their professors.  Reminds me a bit of some work my bro did after he graduated college. Basically it was a 2 week ""camp"" in D.C. My bro and others taught very rich kids law/history stuff and took the kids out to monuments. The program makes great profits because they don't have to pay the staff (recent grads) much and they also charge a ton of money. 15 years ago when the program started it wasn't for profit, and the people who taught it were people who were much more qualified than my brother--he met them, and they were congressmen or local politicians, community organizers with a lot of experience, etc."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,o7bi9,Azzmo,3,Sun Jan 8 05:11:02 2012 UTC,How would you know that it did not effect your quality of education if you never met a single professor? If you met one on a personal level it might have changed your quality of education.
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,o7bi9,joonjoon,2,Mon Jan 9 16:04:15 2012 UTC,"Tuition would definitely drop. You realize that the same thing that's happened with the housing market is happening with education right? Making free money available for people to buy a good with ultimately always results in a mess, like we have with housing and education.  Maybe some schools would suffer, but schools are independent organizations that need to do their own quality assurance. In the end it would improve overall quality at schools because they would really have to compete on returning value for tuition because people have to be more selective with their money. The glut of free education loans we have is exactly what's causing the problems you describe.  Imagine if government was providing interest free loans on cars. Would you suggest that car quality would suffer if we stopped making free loans?"
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,o7bi9,goal2004,16,Tue Jan 10 23:39:46 2012 UTC,"From here.  Also this.  Here's my ongoing collection of essential facts about Ron Paul:  ==Ron Paul in-a-nutshell==   RP does not believe the First Amendment applies to states, and that they should be able to discriminate based on sexual preference, gender, race or religion if the local populace agrees. (See: http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul120.html) RP does not believe in church-state separation (http://www.freethoughtpedia.com/wiki/Ron_Paul#Ron_Paul_does_not_believe_in_separation_of_church_and_state) RP claims he would not let his religious beliefs influence his public policy. But he has twice introduced ""The Sanctity of Life Act"" which federalizes abortion as murder and says, ""life begins at conception"" which is clearly based on his evangelical christian ideology. (See: http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1096:) RP claims to be a libertarian but imposing his religious ideals upon everyone at the federal level is the antithesis of respect for individual rights. Even his own bible doesn't define life as beginning at conception. RP rejects the theory of evolution as being valid. It's bad enough any educated person would reject the overwhelming evidence, but he is a medical doctor! (See: http://www.freethoughtpedia.com/wiki/Ron_Paul#Ron_Paul:_Fundamentalist_Christian_Creationist) RP also does not believe in global climate change and that humans have any impact on the environment.(See: http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul537.html) RP wants to neuter the Judicial branch of government and make religious institutions exempt from any Federal rulings, paving the way for churches to be above the government in power. (See: http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR00539:@@@L&summ2=m& ) RP wants to get rid of the EPA. There would be no federal oversight of pollution and environmental protection. RP wants to sell off National Parks, Wildlife refuges, National Forests, Nature preserves, etc. The Grand Canyon would be privately owned. (See: http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-3460_162-57328355/face-the-nation-transcript-november-20-2011/?pageNum=3 ) RP wants to get rid of the Dept of Education. No more student loans or grants. No improved educational opportunities for non-rich people. No standards for equal-educational-access enforced.  No national educational standards set. (See: http://www.ronpaul.com/2009-05-20/ron-paul-vs-ed-schultz-end-the-department-of-education-and-the-department-of-agriculture/) RP wants to get rid of the Dept of Agriculture. No more national standards for food safety or regulation of pesticides. RP claims the DOA is ""unconstitutional."" (See: http://www.ronpaul.com/2009-05-20/ron-paul-vs-ed-schultz-end-the-department-of-education-and-the-department-of-agriculture/)   Paul fans will follow up on this with a huge barrage of copy-pasted stuff that does NOT contradict these facts.  Ironically, many Paul followers claim he doesn't flip-flop, but he continually does, especially when it comes to going back and forth between entirely shutting down whole government departments, and then backpedaling and saying, it's only ""after more moderate things have been done"".  Depending upon who Ron Paul is talking to, his rhetoric is more or less radical, but he's never backed off his claims of completely shutting down a huge area of government departments and services, and whenever he's asked about how society would function, his standard response is to evade the question and spew a red herring: ""Why do you hate the Constitution?  None of these things are Constitutional"".  EDIT: It cannot be stressed enough that one fundamental tenet of Ron Paul's policy is that he believes the Bill of Rights does not apply to the states -- He believes it only restricts the federal government.  His followers don't fully-understand the implications of this philosophy.  This means that Ron Paul believes civil rights, gay rights, gay marriage, gender equality, institutionalized racism, prejudice and intolerance, even slavery should be acceptable/rejectable on a state-by-state basis."

You could say that I'm presenting a slippery slope fallacy, but it's not that long of a stretch because Paul is A MEDICAL DOCTOR WHO KNOWS HUMAN BIOLOGY.

These are kind of an attempt at an end-run around Roe v Wade.  In fact, it is so bad that some states only have a single operating clinic.  If the matter were left up to the states, it would be impossible to get a legal abortion in large parts of the country.  It's kind of the same thing for drugs.

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,o7bi9,Reyer,21,Sun Jan 8 05:01:44 2012 UTC,"This is what the EPA Does....  EPA  Actually environmental protections would be MUCH stricter under his presidency and he has been saying the same things since the 80s.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0RB1mVWLQA  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYp5BD-omG4  The problem is that the EPA ONLY LIMITS liability for large polluting corporations. For instance the state of texas and many small fishery owners were denied the right to sue BP because they were protected by the EPA.  The EPA doesn't reduce pollution, it only puts a cap (quite high) on what a company can pollute. Bigger companies get larger caps. What this does is it removes the Market forces that drive companies to invest in green technology. When the EPA tells company X to keep a certain pollution below 100fakeunits, this company has absolutely NO incentive to invest or invent a greener system because they are within EPA regulations. In the Paul approach, companies are rewarded for being 'greener' and the risk of lawsuits for polluting private property owners land/air/water is decreased. These companies are market driven to invest in cleaner technology.  From RonPaul2012 dot com:  ""Eliminate the ineffective EPA. Polluters should answer directly to property owners in court for the damages they create – not to Washington.""  Make tax credits available for the purchase and production of alternative fuel technologies.  This approach keeps market forces driving cleaner technology. Instead of placing a cap and calling it a day. Here is a written interview with him, it may answer more of your questions."

You do realize that the EPA doesn't really do anything and to get around the regulations just requires a large amount of money, right? The EPA is nothing but a tax-payer money pit that doesn't do anything to protect the environment."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,o7bi9,CTS777,8,Sun Jan 8 09:28:03 2012 UTC,"The EPA is nothing but a tax-payer money pit that doesn't do anything to protect the environment.   Aside from the fact that this is patently false (I'm assuming you've never had to deal with them, or get development approvals, or apply for grant funding for an academic environmental study, or a myriad of other things they actually do), Paul's solution is to leave environmental safeguarding to the states. States which are, by and large, cash-strapped as it is and would have next to no chance of effectively funding their own independent EPAs without federal assistance.  Not to mention the abolition of the federal EPA would leave a huge legal gap where enforcing pollution regulations across state lines is concerned. It would be years before new precedents are set, and all the while more damage will be done. Note: there is no maybe in that scenario; industry has proven time and time again over the past two hundred years they will almost always choose the cheaper option when dealing with their waste. And that usually means burning or dumping it with wild abandon.  edit from an afterthought: What's that? The almighty free market will save the environment when consumers take their dollars to ""green"" businesses? Oh, silly me, of course. Wrong. Even though the common person is woefully under-informed on environmental issues even though we have a lot of data in today's world, who do you think will be collating that data in the first place without a federal EPA? It sure would be great for someone to trudge through multiple state EPA websites or publications to find the one nugget of data they're interested in. To say nothing of how vastly different testing and reporting regulations can and would be from state to state without a centralized body governing such things.  Even expert journalists and scientists would find great difficulty trying to find anything of importance, moreso than they do now, which is really the only reason this line of thought is being entertained by the Republican party leadership. They know this will effectively shroud the shitty buttfucking shit their industry backers want to do.  Now, the EPA can and probably should be reformed. Any government institution which has been around for a number of decades is going to have developmental inefficiencies, overlaps, and gaps in its structure. Some by design, some by lack of oversight. For instance I'm all for restoring the EPA's authority and teeth to go after offenders (they've been weakened time and again since its inception in the 70s, fyi). And several other things I don't really have the time to enumerate.  Take a look at how the UK's environmental agency functions; it's pretty efficient and business doesn't cry nearly as much as ours. Same with Germany's -- you can't possibly say their caretaking of the environment is at all light-handed compared to ours. Our businesses bitch and moan simply because they know they'll get attention.  In closing, please try to think critically instead of drinking kool-aid."

I just wanted to share this video where Paul explains his stance on abortion rationally, when he's not pressured into making a 5-second sound bite out a complex issue.  ""Ron Paul voted NO twice, once in 1999 (HR 1218) and then again in 2005 (HR 748) to make transporting a minor across state lines in order to get an abortion a federal crime. ""  http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i0i3s/ron_paul_voted_no_twice_once_in_1999_hr_1218_and/  Ron Paul, voted to keep legal helping a minor (maybe by parents/relatives/doctor/etc) go across state lines to get an abortion, if their state denies them one.  Ron Paul - Doesn't like abortion, but will not criminalize your freedom of movement if you want to go and get one.  Pro-Life Issue: Here is the one fact all Americans need to know. Dr. Paul is the only Republican candidate who has said, ""So while Roe v. Wade is invalid, a federal law banning abortion across all 50 states would be equally invalid."" Abortion is one of the most divisive issues and may always be a divisive issue as long as Americans have freedom of religion and the right to be, think and feel differently. Dr. Ron Paul may be personally pro-life; however, his voting record indicates that, even if a bill attempting to make abortion illegal federally in the U.S. were passed by the House and Senate, Dr. Paul would veto the bill as unconstitutional. Which other Republican candidate has a track record to indicate that?  Would Dr. Paul look to put pro-life judges on the Supreme Court bench? Probably as much as past Republican presidents. The current Democratic President has recently placed two women on the Supreme Court, and new Justices are appointed only when a Justice dies or retires. Six Republican Presidential candidates have already signed the Susan B. Anthony List 2012. Dr. Ron Paul is the safest Republican candidate because he would veto anti-abortion bills at the federal level and support states that chose to protect women's reproductive rights.  His other strong Constitution-based reforms outweigh the small risk that Roe v. Wade would be overturned during his term, returning the power to the states, who can then protect women's reproductive rights, as Vermont has.   Would he truly respect the states' rights on this, considering his strong personal stand? Many progressive states have anti-abortion laws on their books that are not enforceable due to Roe v. Wade. So far, Dr. Paul has written bills to make it possible for states to make abortion illegal in the Sanctity of Life bill. He wrote the We the People Act, which, if passed, would render Roe v. Wade invalid and return powers to the states. He signed the Susan B. Anthony list, which describes federally defunding all abortions and Planned Parenthood.   If Dr. Paul can fix the economic mess, is the slight chance that Roe v. Wade would be rendered invalid something Americans are willing risk for the betterment of the country in many other important areas? We will not ever go back to a time before birth control, morning-after pills, RU 486, the Internet and other advancements. Certain states, even with Roe v. Wade, are extremely restrictive.  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laura-trice/ron-paul-11-point-plan_b_947832.html?ref=mostpopular"

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,o7bi9,emptyhunter,6,Sun Jan 8 07:00:56 2012 UTC,"Reddit, I don't understand your love for Ron Paul.  Have you even looked at his record?  He opposes the right of women to be free to control their own reproductive systems if they happen to live in particular states or other countries, or if they work for the Peace Corps.  He would deny the use of the Federal court system -- and even Federal precedent -- to people discriminated against because of their religious beliefs or sexual orientation. This would also limit the cross-state recognition of same-sex marriages. Some of these bills he cynically calls this the ""We the People Act"".  This includes limits on courts' hearing cases related to abortion, and he has introduced bills specific to these kinds of cases. He also uses the deceptive term ""partial-birth abortion"".  Even though he claims to be a ""libertarian"", he opposes people's freedom to burn or destroy their own copies of the design of the U.S. flag.  He has tried to repeal the Occupational Safety and Health Act.  He would like to make it much easier to decertify labor unions.  He opposes the Minimum Wage.  He would deny the prevailing wage to employees of federal contractors, and remove prohibition on kickbacks in Federal projects.  He wants to severely weaken Social Security.  He has come out against attempts to make the United States more democratic, including the idea of eliminating the Electoral College, even after the debacle in the 2000 Presidential election.  He wants to repeal the ""Motor Voter"" Act, which has made it easier for people to register to vote.  He would repeal significant portions of antitrust law, including the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act, and others.  He would gut the regulatory power of Federal agencies, forcing Congress to micromanage all decisions.  He has tried to make it easier for racial and ethnic discrimination in our society.  He would propose an amendment to the Constitution to gut the Fourteenth Amendment by denying citizenship to people born here whose parents aren't already citizens ""nor persons who owe permanent allegiance to the United States"". That latter part could produce some serious political discrimination, especially if radicals can have their citizenship revoked.  He would limit or try to repeal various environmental protection laws and regulations, including the Clean Air Act, the Soil and Water Conservation Act, and the use of devices that protect the ""bycatch"" of sea life.  He would promote offshore oil-drilling, the construction of more refineries, coal-mining on Federal lands, and block conservation measures. This would further threaten our coastal and internal environments, and further trap our economy in fossil-fuel dependency.  This ""champion of peace"" wanted to prohibit the dismantling of ICBM silos in the U.S.  He would continue U.S. opposition to the International Criminal Court, despite the usefulness of this body for prosecuting war-crimes that are not challenged domestically.  He has promoted the Bricker Amendment to the Constitution, and otherwise sought limit the protections of international law. He would also prohibit U.S. courts from citing foreign laws or policies (other than English ones) in their decisions.  He would end U.S. participation in the United Nations. Failing that he would prohibit or severely curtail appropriations for U.S. payments to the U.N. or its affiliated agencies.  Not having any success there, he has worked to block U.S. membership in the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization.    He would allow more guns in schools and National Parks, repeal requirements for background checks and gun-locks, use Federal authority to nullify state laws regarding concealed weapons, and eliminate many other regulations including prohibitions on gun possession by minors, recent felons, fugitives, addicts, and domestic abusers, and prohibitions relating to semiautomatic weapons.  He would weaken educational standards by using Federal power to interfere with states improving their standards for teacher certification.  He wants to dramatically reduce the tax obligations of people who make inordinately high incomes and who inherit large fortunes they did not earn. Specifically, this includes attempts to repeal the estate tax, and to apply one tax rate to all income levels.  He has favored all manner of other right-wing policies, in the following case with a single bill, which includes provisions for such things as supporting corporal punishment, requiring that young people seeking reproductive care have their parents notified, allowing churches and religious organizations that run ""public"" services to discriminate against potential clients, and moving us back to school segregation: H.R.7955: A bill to strengthen the American family and promote the virtues of family life.  tl;dr - Ron Paul supports just about everything redditors tend to hate, and yet redditors love him like a battered wife.

Yet reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so slightly, and the variations be inherited, which is certainly the case; and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real. How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light, hardly concerns us more than how life itself first originated; but I may remark that several facts make me suspect that any sensitive nerve may be rendered sensitive to light, and likewise to those coarser vibrations of the air which produce sound."

Trigonometry was around 2000 years before evolution was ever theorized, and it is basic math. There is no room for mistakes, so we know precisely the distance between us and the star. Also, most physics is based on the velocity of light, and we have a very, very precise grasp of how far light travels. It's all been tested with a simple equation of S/T that we learn in 8th grade physics so your dad's argument is failed."

She is and she ought to be drowned in baptism… She would deserve, the wretch, to be banished to the filthiest place in the house, to the closets.”  —Martin Luther, Works, Erlangen Edition v. 16, pp. 142-148.   “Reason is the greatest enemy that faith has; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things, but—more frequently than not—struggles against the divine Word, treating with contempt all that emanates from God.”  —Martin Luther, Table Talks in 1569.   “Heretics are not to be disputed with, but to be condemned unheard, and whilst they perish by fire, the faithful ought to pursue the evil to its source, and bathe their heads in the blood of the Catholic bishops, and of the Pope, who is the devil in disguise.”  —Martin Luther, Table Talks (as quoted in Religious History: An Inquiry by M.

The interaction shouldn't be this explosive from the start to someone who didn't do it first. He put claims in her mouth that she's never made (""Every atheist and believer on this planet are wrong..."") He doesn't make an argument at all, he's simply says that her perspective is absurd.   The reason I'm making this point here is because he made his stance clear first without making any arguments in its favor other than declaring it absurd (which I agree, the things he covered are definitely absurd), and then when the girl (whom I assume didn't understand his descriptions and probably doesn't have a clear idea of what her religious beliefs are) replied he just attacked her directly.  I love a good debate, but I hate it when it comes to ad hominem attacks."

It is a functionally worthless position, as it is an unprovable feel-good speculation, based on jack and shit, that can make people feel spiritual without actually requiring any sacrifice (while also allowing righteous indignation when people talk crap about god).  What's amusing is a lot of Christians, when pressed, end up this category as well.  It is as intellectually lazy as it gets.  Fine, if a person thinks there is an unquantifiable energy and they want to call it ""GOD"", hopefully they realize that it is an essentially meaningless designation. /former pantheist"

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,o1bwu,bigwhale,3,Wed Jan 4 07:43:49 2012 UTC,"Sorry about the late reply (just got back from vacation). I sympathize with your view (I shared it myself once) but I've seen what the seemingly benign stuff does. The thing with the religions that you grow up with is that they have been around for a long time. When you are born into a religion, you tend not to take every single thing about it too seriously. Most people (as outspoken as they may be) are quite secular in their actions (they kinda have to be - to exist and function in a technological society).   New religions, cults and irrational beliefs like astrology and homeopathy (and all the rest like the crystal crap, chakras, etc. etc. ad nauseum) have no such governors (or safety switches). For my money they are all (including conventional religion) way down at negative infinity in terms of truth. The new stuff will just get you there faster :p.   The old stuff is more weighed down with historical baggage and its evils  further tempered by at least a few admirable historical figures. It moves slowly, typically only gaining momentum through cult-like offshoots (like the Evangelicals or Southern Baptists or Mormons or Pentecostals or Radical Islamists). They have to waste a lot of time and energy trying to fit some new thing in their goat-herder philosophy of the world before being able to voice a semi-coherent opinion on it. This is good. The old religions have convoluted rules that hobble the fundamentalist to some extent.   The new stuff (being pure, unadulterated garbage) has no such weakness. Intellectually, it is the worst parts of the old religions (superstitious drivel) without a single redeeming quality in return. It adapts to progress, burrowing in like a determined parasite; navigating the nooks and crannies and cracks in knowledge and inventing rules on the fly. New superstitions are extremely difficult to fight because the purveyors are tech-savvy and sometimes even have a superficial familiarity with scientific jargon that they employ ruthlessly to suck in the gullible (Deepak Chopra comes to mind here).   As for being benign, there are countries (India for instance), where leaders actually consult astrologers before taking actions that affect the future of the nation. Without going that far, do you really think people basing their decisions on something like astrology is benign???? Really??   Just as religion, these things are only as benign as their followers' refusal to actually follow their precepts. Someone once asked in r/atheism what atheists would do if religion went away in some distant future. My answer was that religion is far from being the only or even the most significant contributor to irrationality and ignorance on this planet. It is merely a symptom of the actual disease."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,o1bwu,heruka,2,Wed Jan 4 00:48:08 2012 UTC,"Sir, I stand corrected. You have opened my eyes a bit I admit, and the world now seems slightly more foul than it did before :p Well spoken, I guess that they are quite harmful in their very own right"
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,o1bwu,Leo-D,1 point,Thu Jan 5 15:52:40 2012 UTC,"Bravo. It's also worth noting that a lot of practitioners of new age mumbo-jumbo have no qualms about taking money from desperate people. I've seen, first hand, a poor working class mother of a violent and incredibly strong autistic child (I used to be a care worker for him) being ripped off by someone claiming he could cure autism by dicking around with the kid's aura. This woman had virtually nothing, and her situation was desperate enough that she would regularly have to call the police to stop the kid from killing her. I was so angry I could spit."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,o1bwu,TheAwesomeinator,2,Sat Jan 7 17:05:08 2012 UTC,"As a Religious Studies major the point is not to ""disprove"" whatever it is I disagree with but to see how human beings have always and forever (and forever will) co-create meaning in their lives. You observe how these memes operate in people's lives, informing and reinforcing and changing inexorably, all in a multifaceted symphony of meaning and orientation towards and within the world. From that perspective, to care about whether or not these belief systems coincide with one's own reality tunnel indicates little more than a lack of self-confidence in one's own reality. For me the emphasis is on understanding others; I see that as the most important thing in dealing with religion."

And you know what? THAT'S OKAY! Intelligent discussion, and sometimes satire, is literally the only way for us to move forward. You're effectively arguing AGAINST a free marketplace of ideas where all beliefs get examined and put to the test, while arguing FOR a place where everyone has to be quiet and has to treat any kind of bullshit as if it had merit. You're trying to destroy progress!    No, the problem with religion is not the fact that they think they are right, and that they want to spread what they perceive as truth. The problem is the fact that some people (both religious and non-religious) will use illegitimate means to spread their truth - means that have nothing to do with the merit of their ideas. An idea isn't worthy just because the people who believe in it have the means to slaughter anyone who disagrees, an idea isn't worthy because its followers are willing to indoctrinate their children when they're too young to even think about the idea. An idea IS worthy if it can stand up in a discussion and survive any argument brought against it.    And that is ALL new atheism is about - having an open discussion on a level playing field about religion, so that the truth may emerge. And of course, we believe the truth to be atheism, but if it's not? Then, using our methods, atheism will die. And we're fine with that.    As someone else here pointed out, you use any illegitimate methods, like spraying graffiti on a church wall, the new atheism will raise money to clean up the damage. Violence isn't what we're about, destruction of property isn't what we're about, indoctrination is not what we're about. Sorry doggit60, but you're talking out of your ass."

Mr. Old Atheist, you should know atheism isn't a belief, but rather a distinct lack there-of. It's not an assertion, it's a rejection of assertions, so you constructed your own straw man in your discussion with your friend by equating atheism with ""beliefs""."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,nxvu6,Marchosias,2,Sat Dec 31 21:43:47 2011 UTC,"you're nitpicking with my word choice. sure atheism is the lack of belief, but it is certainly a way of thinking. the way of thinking that things need evidence to be considered true or possibly true.  the problem starts when people start to say that their way of thinking is the best and that the world would be better off if everyone thought that way. that's the idea that causes problems."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,nxvu6,Marchosias,6,Sat Dec 31 21:52:35 2011 UTC,"There are ways of thinking that lead to atheism, but atheism isn't a way of thinking. It isn't a worldview. For example, what is inherent in a world of atheists? Skepticism. Otherwise they can be liberal, conservative, like hip hop, like country, enjoy porn, or abstain for the sake of discipline.  Atheism is a small pool relegated to people who already (for the most part) subscribe to skeptic thought, so it may seem like it's a world view, but the only thing inherent in atheism is that you think the idea of a god is silly. From there, it's implies absolutely zero.  It is literally the same as being called a ""a-chessist"" if you don't enjoy chess. All it says is that one thing, though if everyone but people who enjoyed video games enjoyed chess, you may be tempted to imply that being achessist means you like video games. Strictly speaking, it's wrong.  In any case, I do believe that if everyone were skeptical to a reasonable degree (ugh, solipsism) the world would be a better place."

Also, you're a shit-ton less eloquent when you're angry on the internet than when you're making a rage-comic you think everyone will suck you off for, aren't you?  Edit; let me clarify: he said that the world would be better if everyone was atheist. He wasn't in central park, belittling theists, was he? He wasn't even talking to a theist. So in what way was he imposing his beliefs on other people?  You sir, are absurd."

And please don't say that the religions demanded it, as that is a case of people who hold the ""my way of thinking is best""  ideology, perverting the message of their religion to suit their needs.  also, no, I knew I'd be attacked for this comic because many atheists on the internet are just as unreasonable and ignorant as theists on the internet.  he wasn't doing so directly sure, but I'm sure he would given the chance. why not just live and let live?  also to marchosias http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/atheism maybe the definition is a theist conspiracy?"
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,nxvu6,erkTheJerk,3,Sat Dec 31 22:03:01 2011 UTC,"Except it's not perverting the message of the religion... let's start out with the Quran.  Quran (2:244) - ""Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things.""  Quran (2:216) - ""Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not.""  Quran (3:56) - ""As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help.""  Quran (3:151) - ""Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority""  Quran (4:74) - ""Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward.""  Quran (4:76) - ""Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah…""  List goes on and on. Now, onto Christianity.  Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the LORD your God must be put to death.  Such evil must be purged from Israel.  (Deuteronomy 17:12 NLT)  ""If a man lies with a male as with a women, both of them shall be put to death for their abominable deed; they have forfeited their lives.""  (Leviticus 20:13 NAB)  Whoever strikes his father or mother shall be put to death.  (Exodus 21:15 NAB)  If a man commits adultery with another man's wife, both the man and the woman must be put to death.  (Leviticus 20:10 NLT)  Once again, list goes on and on. Do you want me to pull up more violent religious texts? I mean, where do you think this whole ""conversion mentality"" comes from? People don't just wake up one day, and say, ""Gee, you know what, Joe? I think, today I'm going to go out and kill some people because they don't believe in the same god as me!"" NO! The religious demand it. If religion had never existed, then there never would've been ""people forcing their religion on others"". Obviously, sir, YOU don't understand the central message of most religions which is ""Ours is the only true one, kill all others."" How is this difficult for you to understand? Wars and fighting would be prevented if religion didn't exist, and yes we still would have some wars and some fighting, but not nearly as much!  Your distinction between ""religion"" and ""people forcing their religion on others"" is one that theist apologists use way to much, and the funny thing is, if you look at the text, the distinction isn't there."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,nxvu6,erkTheJerk,1 point,Sat Dec 31 22:13:54 2011 UTC,"whats more, all of these wars you reference, they were mostly power battles that leaders used religion to justify. so yea people weaponized it as people are apt to do. just like we weaponized atomic energy, doesn't mean it doesn't have good to offer the world. the leaders of the time would have found some other way to justify the wars and what not. it was a means to an end, not the cause. you saying that if religion didn't exist then there would be no people forcing religion on others is a completely inane statement.  you're digging a very dangerous hole with your arguments here. i suppose i could say if race didn't exist there would be no racial tension/wars/violence, so clearly we should all vote on one race and get rid of the others and then the world would  be a better place. you must agree since that's consistent with your ""if it didnt exist then the problems it causes wouldnt exist"" argument."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,nxvu6,erkTheJerk,3,Sat Dec 31 22:34:25 2011 UTC,"If there was no distinction between races, yeah that'd be great because we wouldn't have any wars. Unfortunately, ""voting"" on one race is just more racial tension, so you are a dumb-fuck.  Just like if there was no religion, it'd be great. However, people do believe in religion, so we can't eradicate religion by starting an anti-holy war. Can you read? Do you understand english? Because I think you're having trouble reading my statement. BIG SURPRISE! I don't want to start a genocide. Just like with trying to remove race distinction, we should try to progressively move toward a world with no religion. Just the same with moving toward a world with no distinction between the sexes or sexuality; a world of just people. However, you obviously can't read, so let me reiterate; you are a dumb-fuck.  Race isn't a problem. The problem is the distinction. By religions very nature, it causes distinction (cue the violent passages which you very conveniently ignored). If religion didn't facilitate violence, it'd be fine! But it does. By it's very texts, it does. The fact that you refuse to see that because you want to be ""suave live and let live atheist"" doesn't help you in the least. It doesn't make you tolerant, it makes you blind.  Also, it doesn't matter that religion was a means to an end in those wars. It's still an evil system because it allowed people to manipulate others into doing their bidding. If there was no religion, Hitler wouldn't have had a scapegoat (the jews) to place Germany's tough times, and the religious texts to back it up.  You may not want to believe it, but just because people used religion doesn't make it less evil. What matters is that it's able to manipulate otherwise nice, smart people into believing in hate and violence. And that's the skinny."

YOU ARE THE PROBLEM!  differences will always exist. ALWAYS. we shouldn't be trying to progress towards a world with no distinctions, that is actually a retarded idea. we should be progressing towards a world where those distinctions don't matter. by saying we should get rid of religion you're just creating a new intolerant stance. you're not saying ""hey i accept that you believe differently then me but were both people so thats cool"" you're saying "" you're beliefs ruin this world so they should be destroyed"" like do u hear yourself?  let me quote so you can read it again   ""Just like with trying to remove race distinction, we should try to progressively move toward a world with no religion.""  so are you saying we should try for a world with no races and no religions. soo how do u propose we get rid of race distinction........ genocide? or more likely you just dont even know what you're trying to say bc you're 16 and rebelling against religious parents or something. i think what you want to say is that we should be moving towards a world where noone cares about race distinctions, just like we should move towards a world where no one cares about religious distinctions.  also no, i didn't ignore the passages. every single one of them was refuted in the link i left for you. good job reading it."

Before I leave you to stew in your own juices (because I've lost all respect for you to even debate), let me pose an analogy. Say someone starts a club. They get a bunch of people, and eventually use that club to start terrorizing their city. Now, it doesn't matter that someone used that club to further their means; that club should still be destroyed because it allows people to be destructive and justify it.

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,nx2wv,SomeLoser0,5,Sat Dec 31 16:32:34 2011 UTC,This is a misunderstanding of what it is to be an atheist and the purpose of good atheist literature.  Good atheist writing is life-affirming and makes you think. It challenges you to constantly consider your own views of the universe and if the author is any good then they invite you to challenge them.   You can read and reread as many different text as you like over as long a period as you like and if are a critical thinker then you should constantly be questioning everything.  This doesn't make a sky-fairy any more likely than a unicorn or pixie though.

How do you mesh Genesis and the larger stories of the bible (Jonah and the Whale, etc) with what we know in science?  If it it all just fable and morality tale, how do you know which parts are literal and which parts aren't?  If that answer is ""the parts that don't make sense with science"" then can't that be said for all the important parts too?  Like the birth and resurrection?  Also if Genesis isn't literal then isn't the whole point of Jesus moot?  (No original sin, no need for Jesus)  Secondly, how do you rectify the brutality, injustice, and vileness of the bible?  Slavery, treatment of women, etc?  How can a religion be about peace and love then endorse all that?  Also with that note, if this is supposed to be the infallible word of god, the one thing he gives to mankind to learn of him and follow him without revision and without amendment and it then go on to have so much content that is both scientifically wrong and morally wrong, how can you as an intelligent, kind, and honest person say you not only support the cause, but are willing to dedicate your life (probably the only one you'll ever have) to it.

So Kent Hovind had a ""theory"" going (had, because he's now in jail for tax fraud) regarding various events that ""evolutionists"" can't explain; for instance fossils, impact craters on the moon, Saturn's rings (dead serious) etc are all explained by this Hovind ""theory"". In that theory is a rather shitty explanation for what caused the craters on the moon - a large ice meteor that concurrently caused Noah's flood.  Now on to the video.

It's the same with these people. They may believe themselves to be true Christians but the question is are they using religion as a rationalisation for their hatred? Do they believe something to be morally wrong because God says it is or because they believe it wrong upon it's own merits, and they views of their specific variation of religion simply run along side their views?

One may as well exclaim ""By Zeus' beard"" for all the actual religious significance such a phrase has."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,nrfi0,SanityInAnarchy,6,Tue Dec 27 00:20:38 2011 UTC,WHAT? Anger directed at theists for less-than-appropriate-reasons is quite common in r/atheism. You've been lied to.
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,nrfi0,SanityInAnarchy,-2,Tue Dec 27 06:33:30 2011 UTC,"It's more common than I'd like, but it's still far less common than the perception. For example, if someone said ""God Bless You,"" and I said ""Actually, I'm an atheist,"" as the atheist does in Dane Cook's ""atheist sneeze,"" that's not necessarily anger or even offence, but the theist could easily interpret it that way.  There's also plenty of cases where anger is warranted and theists don't get why. ""What's the problem? It's just a little school led/sponsored/endorsed prayer to Jesus!"" No, they wouldn't put it that way, but that's because they haven't yet considered what this looks like from the other side."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,nrfi0,yourfacelikesme,3,Tue Dec 27 07:09:37 2011 UTC,"I do actually get annoyed at both. I try not to take it out on the person telling me, but to me, even as a Jew, hearing ""Merry Christmas"" all the time was practically rubbing my face in it, especially when there's the inclusive ""Happy Holidays.""  But I try to hold my tongue.  Unlike the morons who continually post all-caps stuff to Facebook about how proud they are to say Merry Christmas, precisely because they want to rub it in our faces, and how they'll boycott people who say Happy Holidays, and oh by the way, how it's ""Christmas"" and not ""Xmas"", because Xmas is somehow taking the Christ out of Christmas. (The X in Xmas represents the Greek letter Χ (Chi), the first letter in Χριστός (Khristós), which is Greek for Christ.)  But if I say ""And a Happy Holidays to you,"" somehow I'll be seen as the obnoxious one."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,nrfi0,SanityInAnarchy,2,Tue Dec 27 07:16:35 2011 UTC,"I'm maybe a person who throws out the unintentional ""Merry Christmas"" to someone I'm unaware doesn't celebrate Christmas, but personally I would not be offended if someone said ""Happy Chanukah"" to me. I think you could politely say ""Hey, thanks for the gesture, but I'm actually Jewish. Happy Holidays"" and people wouldn't think you're a jerk. They might just say it out of ignorance because, no offense, but a vast majority of people celebrate Christmas.   I am speaking from an American point of view so I apologize if you're in a more Jewish population. I don't mean to offend you, just may offer a point of view that isn't trying to intentionally place their own beliefs on you."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,nrfi0,yourfacelikesme,2,Tue Dec 27 07:47:42 2011 UTC,"I think you could politely say ""Hey, thanks for the gesture, but I'm actually Jewish. Happy Holidays"" and people wouldn't think you're a jerk.   Surprisingly, even at this, many do. Again, there are people who have even more of a kneejerk reaction to ""Happy Holidays"" than I do to ""Merry Christmas.""  For what it's worth, I don't still identify as Jewish, as I no longer believe in God. The point was that even from a Jewish perspective, let alone atheist, it can be obnoxious. If you think Christmas Carols get annoying when they start well before Halloween, imagine what it's like for us?  But this was my point -- I hold my tongue, I try not to let it show how much this bothers me. I still don't think I'm wrong to be annoyed by this, but I do try to remind myself that 99% of the time, I'm not talking to a ""Put the Christ back in Xmas"" moron, but a decent human being who isn't politically correct 100% of the time.  Maybe it would help to imagine a different scenario: Suppose I've just lost someone close to me. Suppose some well-intending person tries to comfort me by saying ""He's in a better place... smiling down at us... You'll be in our prayers."" I have to remind myself that this is meant as a truly kind and decent gesture, but no matter how much I may intellectually understand that this person means nothing but the best for me, I can't help but feel as though I'm being attacked -- as though someone is taking advantage of a grieving person, trying to get me at my weakest. Even if I wanted to take it as it's meant, it serves only to remind me of the philosophical problems with such a heaven, and the cruelties of a god who very likely sent the person we're talking about to the other place. Praying for them... and praying for me, now? What, exactly, would you be praying for? That I stop feeling bad? The grieving process takes time -- I don't want to be instantly happy and forget it ever happened, that'd be disgusting. That this person's soul is saved? Now we're on the topic of salvation, which I find morally reprehensible.  And it's going to look like that wall of text I just wrote, if I respond the way I feel. In the middle of the emotions I'm dealing with at the moment, I'm likely to lash out and let loose the most potent, impassioned, insulting, and hurtful verbal attacks against that person and that religion.  I'm not sure I can explain why I feel that way, other than to compare it to the WBC protesting funerals. Think about it -- suppose I told you that your son (who just died at war) is going to Hell, that you're a sinner, that God wanted him to die because you're such a pervert and this is a perverted nation, etc, etc. I wouldn't blame you for punching me in the face if I said that at his funeral. If you had more restraint than that, what would you say to me, in a fit of grief and rage?  But even in that situation, I would try to have more self-restraint than that. Most people are not the WBC, and even if they've said something genuinely offensive, a kneejerk response probably isn't helpful."

I live in a small GA town, and when I told my friends I was atheist, one of my very good friends, who is usually very open minded (pro-everything that liberals believe in, knew Jesus was a liberal socialist, etc etc), told me right then that he couldn't hang out with me anymore (meaning it wasn't his parents, it was him). Still, none of my other friends cared, so he ended up leaving the group.   I can't talk about religion around any lady who looks older than 50, they'll go on a minimum 10 minute rant about how I'm going to hell when they hear what I believe (or maybe don't believe).  This isn't exaggeration either; it really is terrible down here. The normal religious prejudice for everyone down here is that they are Christian (usually baptist or methodist). If you aren't Christian (not necessarily atheist, you could be jewish or muslim or hindu or whatever else), you have to tell other people when they start to ask your opinion about scripture. This is actually pretty easy for me, Since I've actually read the Bible, and I can give specific examples of why it is bullshit.  TL;DR What you described is nothing like the Bible belt."

They were a little confused since they couldn't think of any times he did that so I reminded them of the flood where he almost destroyed the entire human race and Sodom and Gomorrah. They tried to justify it by saying that God can judge us for our sins. I pointed out that sin could only exist if God decided to stay silent while watching Eve get tempted. You can't honestly expect a person with no knowledge of good and evil to understand that what they are doing is wrong, yet we are punished for it to this day.    At this point they wanted to just cut their losses and leave me with one of their books so I offered to give them my copy of A History of God too and they could learn about how the polytheistic Canaanite religion led to polytheistic Judaism and from there to monotheistic Judaism. The trade was declined, but one of the guys said he would look into it.    I felt pretty good about the whole exchange. I didn't change any minds, but I defended my position solidly where they could hardly think of what to say."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,now2p,Adu_Sir,6,Sat Dec 24 14:58:37 2011 UTC,"Slight suggestion for next time -- Don't say God stayed silent while watching Eve get tempted. That's based on the idea of an omnipresent God, which the Old Testament, at least not in Genesis, had not even hinted at. If you want evidence, right after Eve eats the apple, and has Adam do the same, they hid from God, and he ""called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art though?"" (Genesis 3.9).  It seems like you have a sound argument, no need to discredit it with that particular ""fact."""

Their sense of nationalism did include belief in nothing but nationalism though, so I'll concede that particular point.  Basically though, atheism wasn't a driving force, nationalism was.  Atheism was merely a part of their nationalistic requirements.  To be honest, I think atheism gets confused with humanism a lot, and ""humanist"" would be a better label for many atheists and would more effectively get across their beliefs."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,nld8i,seeasea,-3,Thu Dec 22 06:06:47 2011 UTC,Some might argue that eugenics and its related effects were due to a perverse misinterpretation of how Darwinism works. Its proponents always claimed to be acting in the name of evolution and science.
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,nld8i,seeasea,6,Fri Dec 23 01:30:07 2011 UTC,Is that Darwin's fault?
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,nld8i,ajleece,1 point,Wed Dec 21 19:24:03 2011 UTC,"Welp, it seems I have angered the Gods of Atheism. The discussion was whether or not people have been killed in the name of atheism, I brought a non-direct example. Somehow it got derailed into discussion of ""fault."" That wasn't the point nor what we were discussing. The point was whether or not people, in the name of science and evolution (which many here take to be interchangeable with Atheism), kill. I brought an example. No one refuted the example, it was deflected."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,nlk6c,setrakakan,3,Thu Dec 22 02:12:04 2011 UTC,"I never said it, even when I was a young christian (athiest now), as it originated during the black plague. People would generally have a sneezing fit just before they died (from what I remember), hence people would say 'bless you' as they were about to die. I always sort of thought that saying bless you was sort of wishing for someone to die. But thats probably just my twisted way of thinking."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,nlk6c,greentoof,5,Thu Dec 22 10:59:51 2011 UTC,"Curious fact: In Japan, people who sneeze are obligated to say ""sorry"" because they interrupted everyone else.  However, religion has ingrained in the japanese customs as well. After eating, one must say ""Gochisou sama"", which was the old way to thank the gods (and the farmer, the person who brought the food to the table) for the food.  It's interesting to see how the various religions have infiltrated into people's customs all over the world."

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,nkbwp,UrzaJR,2,Wed Dec 21 02:24:52 2011 UTC,"This reads ""all you other people"" and ""still special enough to single out your particular holiday"".

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,nkepb,KShults,10,Tue Dec 20 22:02:32 2011 UTC,"Another WTF in the Cain & Abel story.  Cain kills his brother over a petty argument.  Cain says ""Mr God, protect me. all the other people will know what I did and hate on me""  Who are all these other people??  If the story is true, then the only others are his parents and his dead brother.  And then, God does a favour to the world's first murder, and places him under a magic protection. Anyone who kills Cain will be killed 7 times in god's vengeance.  Some great morality ya gots there!"
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,nkepb,kent_eh,5,Wed Dec 21 04:21:38 2011 UTC,"its in genesis, ""So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them""  note it does not say how many ""them"" is comprised of.  it then goes on - ""And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply...""    yet later, after he creates adam and eve, eve doesnt conceive cain and abel til after they are kicked out of eden.  also ""... and there was not a man to till the ground.""  so he makes adam , then eve.   basically god made a bunch of hunter gatherers, then a couple of smart innovative people later.  the god of genesis was more like an evolution of the human race condensed into a few pages.    ive half wondered if this wasnt the first description of neanderthals and cromagnons and the like.  just take out the supernatural b.s."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,nkepb,expandingmess,1 point,Wed Dec 21 07:24:25 2011 UTC,"I have no idea why you got downvoted for this. You're right enough, the narrative does mention the creation of more people before Adam and Eve."
aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,nkepb,totally_mokes,2,Fri Dec 23 10:25:06 2011 UTC,"they could say im just interpreting the ""them"" part, but the be fruitful and multiply came before cain and abel and thats what caused me to look at it again; that maybe ""them"" was really a group rather than just two.    i also have considered that adam may have been a lineage rather than one man... because it says he lives like 900 years, then goes on to who he begat and how long they live, it reminded me a lot of the dynastic rulers of china."

This comic isn't entirely as much about the Cain and Abel bit as it is the way the argument was handled though. The kicker comes with why she accepts it, not the actual story.

aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm,nkepb,expandingmess,1 point,Tue Dec 27 17:04:03 2011 UTC,"nah the comic was totally justified.  pretty much any christian ive talked to firmly believe adam and eve were the first and only people, cain and abel magically produce children... etc."
