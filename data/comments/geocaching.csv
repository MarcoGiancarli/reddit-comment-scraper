geocaching,3e4ccg,PComotose,4,Tue Jul 21 21:22:21 2015 UTC,Why are you still using XP?
geocaching,3e4ccg,DoppelFrog,3,Tue Jul 21 21:39:11 2015 UTC,<grin> Because my current laptop does everything I want and when I checked with the Microsoft site (a long time ago) it wasn't powerful enough for Win7 or Win8.
geocaching,3e4ccg,bobri,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:07:57 2015 UTC,"Well then , you should see about getting a new computer. Windows XP is no longer supported by Microsoft, it is EOL. It is unsecure and unsafe to be using for any type of sensitive data handling online (such as internet banking, entering a credit card number into  a website, ect.), because you no longer receive security patched from Microsoft. For example, just yesterday Microsoft pushed a critical update to vista and above patching a security exploit where custom fonts could allow any code to be run with elevated privileges. You are vulnerable to this exploit now, but you aren't protected. You are also unprotected from every security exploit found since 8 April 2014 when XP extended support ended."
geocaching,3e4ccg,Politivore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:03:57 2015 UTC,You're absolutely correct.  But I'm retired so there are always budgetary considerations that cannot be ignored.  Mrs. PComotose has hinted that Santa may be generous this year.

geocaching,3e4ccg,bobri,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:26:32 2015 UTC,"Some progress.  I've tried using FF and IE.  When I was using Chrome I happened to be using an Incognito version so I've loaded Chrome to a non-Incognito window.  When I click on ""Download to GPS"", I now go to a screen that asks me which GPS I'm using.  Garmin is the middle tab so I clicked on that and it told me I need to download a driver.  I jumped through the necessary hoops, downloaded it and installed it.  But when I return to the page with the tabs (and I've done all sorts of things like exiting the browser and refreshing the page) it still says I need the driver.  BUT when I go to download the driver now, the download page now tells me that my Garmin is connected to my laptop so, I think, somehow the driver is installed but www.geocaching.com can't see that.  Sigh.  I'll keep plugging away."
geocaching,3e4vmd,ThePin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:47:18 2015 UTC,I went to Boston for work back in March. It was right after all the blizzards so just going out for a couple caches to get my Massachusetts badge was tricky. Eventually made it over to the Lexington-Concord area and found a great virtual: Revolution (GCH7AE). Lots of Revolutionary War history with this cache and I had a great time making the couple/few required stops.  Also found a TB hotel and a PnG or two near Waltham but nothing spectacular to write home about.

The frequently made suggestion at this point is to find a whole load more of them before placing one of your own.  This isn't meant to put you off by the way!  After you've done a few you'll realise there's so much variety in caches, ranging from a nano stuck on the back of a road sign to the straightforward multi's and the devious puzzles that make you laugh, cry, and amazed all at the same time! (the crying can depend on the number of stinging nettles waded through in the vicinity of the final)  Take your time, choose a wonderful location you want to introduce people to, and then how you want them to get there.  A quality and well maintained cache is always worth it.  (or you could just shove a film canister in an ivy covered tree in the middle of a roundabout)"
geocaching,3dzg9q,A2-,2,Mon Jul 20 20:53:57 2015 UTC,Here's the info form the wiki on hiding a cache
geocaching,3dzg9q,NewberryMathGuy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:10:58 2015 UTC,I've just started too. I tried years ago to find one but gave up coz it was too well hidden. Decided to try a week before my overseas trip to find another one. I succeeded and now I'm hooked.   I didn't have much of a chance to cache in the UK but I've been all over Denmark. Even found a couple during my day in Sweden. (I was meeting an old friend and her kids for the first time in 16 years of friendship and I may have gotten the kids hooked too.)  I'm planning on buying a few travel bugs when I get home and sending them out into the world. I want to start a cache too but I'm going to wait until I've found a few more.
geocaching,3dwmpw,appelmak,14,Mon Jul 20 03:38:59 2015 UTC,"I replace logs and bags on a regular base and just note it in the logs. Nothing to worry about that.  If you want to change the container to a same one which is in better condition, I would just go for it. And note it in the logs. Most COs are more than happy to not have to go out and do this :-)"
geocaching,3dwmpw,MavEtJu,4,Mon Jul 20 03:46:34 2015 UTC,"This.  Someone offered to replace my cache for me when it went missing, since I had noted in the logs that I would be away for some time.  I couldn't have been more grateful!"
geocaching,3dwmpw,QuestionMarkus,7,Mon Jul 20 08:51:36 2015 UTC,"If it's a garbage (film container, pill bottle, key holder etc) cache, which most caches are, they will appreciate a new container and log. If it looks like a cache that the owner actually put some effort into, perhaps emailing them what you did was best."
geocaching,3dwmpw,signal_must_die,5,Mon Jul 20 05:21:05 2015 UTC,"I change out destroyed baggies and logs all the time.  I always make sure to write in my online log entry that I'll send along the old log to the CO if they want it.    I would try to contact the CO first about replacing the entire container, though.  They might want to do that themselves.  Some people in my area wouldn't mind the container swap, others would be annoyed.  But if you don't get an answer in a few weeks, I would say go ahead and replace it."

geocaching,3dwart,frpauldure,3,Mon Jul 20 01:50:04 2015 UTC,"There is a wonderful multistage cache laid out along a trail in Indiana Dunes. The trail is a couple of miles long. After getting about halfway through (which included traversing a ""closed"" section of flooded trail) we realized the sun was going down and the park was about to close. We had to complete the rest of the stages at a run. When we got to GZ it was already quite dark and our search had to be pretty desperately high-speed. Luckily it turned out to be an ammo can and not something smaller. Once we were out of the woods and onto the beach we realized there was more daylight than we thought, but it was still quite a scare."
geocaching,3dwart,False-Dmitri,3,Mon Jul 20 02:33:17 2015 UTC,"My buddy and I were searching for a micro near my house. We searched for about 45 minutes when we started to get frustrated. While having the conversation about wether or not we should just give up my buddy just screams ""SHUT UP"". He then reaches his hand out and grabs the cache from in between us at about head hight. We literally had a conversation with the cache dangling right in front of our faces."
geocaching,3dwart,Mouryom,2,Mon Jul 20 11:30:30 2015 UTC,"I usually check recent log entries to try to find out if a cache has been muggled before I waste time searching. If I see a few DNFs in a row, I usually don't bother.   Well this one time, I didn't, and I spent a fruitless 20 minutes of searching with no luck. It was a narrow strip of trees, maybe 20 feet wide, between a gravel road and somebody's back yard fence. I had checked pretty much everywhere reasonably close to ground zero with no luck. So I pulled up the logs to have a look. Yep. 3 DNFs in a row. As I turned around to head back, I kicked over a discarded planter. Places like this are popular for illegal dumping, and far enough out of the way that they never get cleaned up. Garbage everywhere. Underneath this grotty old discarded planter was the cache.  It looked quite new, which tells me the cache owner probably saw those DNFs and replaced the missing cache recently. And I never would have found it if I'd stuck with my usual routine of checking the logs first."

geocaching,3dwart,tetracova,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:06:06 2015 UTC,"There was this one on Brighton beach in the UK. Classed as very hard to find, a microcache.  Me and my wife searched for that damn thing for close to an hour. We were right on top of it. The logs were full of contradictory reports - many said that it definitely had gone, some said it never had been there. But a few said yes, it was definitely there, you just had to look for it. As the most recent log was one of the latter, we presumed it must still be there.  Won't spoil it for any UK geocachers, but this cache was extraordinarily difficult to find. But right when I was ready to give up, my wife spots something out of place. It was the cache, terrifically difficult to find.  Never felt more satisfied geocaching than when we found that tiny cache.  Persistence is key. There are lots of muggled caches out there and you can see where they would have been hidden, but this cache was certainly well out of sight."
geocaching,3dwart,Rad_Carrot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:12:57 2015 UTC,"My niece and I spent probably an hour hunting for a cache in le Jardin du Plantes in Paris. It was definitely somewhere near hedge maze. We split up, did the maze, hunted over the platform in the middle, walked around the perimeter, tried to look like all the muggles in the area ... We finally gave up and sat down to rest before heading out. We were side by side on the stone wall at the top of the path. I looked down and saw the corner of a plastic container through a gap between the stones. We'd both sat down on that wall more than once during our hunt, but not in exactly that spot.   Nice coda: The cache actually belonged to an American who had lived in Paris for a time. A few months later I was at a local CITO event and met him. I was tickled, as we he, since I was the first American he'd met who'd found one of his French caches."
geocaching,3dwart,HatesVanityPlates,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:20:56 2015 UTC,"Plain sight find:  Was going out for an FTF that was posted ~4 miles from my office.  Extended my lunch and drove to GZ.  Walked through the woods, following another FTF-seeker.  I come to a stop and we're looking around and suddenly he looks at the side of my head and says ""Move slightly right and turn to your 9 o'clock.""  I had been standing right next to the cache, suspended in mid-air.  If I were an inch to the left when walking, it would have smacked me in the face.  Last second find:  During my streak (started due to the 30 Days in August challenge, extended to much more) reached a point where I was at a dozen DNFs for a day.  Was about to give up (as I was over 250 daily finds at the time, as I recall) when my fiancee dragged me out of the house, took me to a ""save this for emergencies"" location, and we managed to find a nano hidden underneath a lamp post plate (not a skirt, but a bolt plate like this) where the nano had been stuck up inside the pole.

It's not really a competitive game, so I don't see any point in lying about having gone somewhere that you didn't actually go just so you can have a high caches found count.   It undermines the spirit of the game, but It doesn't really do much towards ruining the game for other real geocachers, as most of us are only concerned about our own finds. It's kind if like the only person you're cheating is yourself.  If a cache owner wants to go through the effort of verifying their logs, more power to them, as it upholds the integrity of the game.

geocaching,3ddhon,realoldfatguy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:27:36 2015 UTC,"According to the guidelines: ""Virtual Cache Logging Guidelines A cacher must visit the location of the virtual cache site to log the cache online.

These logging requirements could include emailing the cache owner to provide the required answers or posting photographs. Neither answers to questions nor hints should be placed in the logs, even if encrypted."", so logging the virtual cache without visiting the site is against the rule.  Also, reading the cache description: ""However any cacher who logs a find on this cache and has not logged, either in the preceding or following 24 hours, a find on at least one traditional or multi cache within Victoria, will have their log deleted"", that that sounds like an additional logging requirement to me as they are detailed in the cache listing."

geocaching,3ddndt,Jaguilar26,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:55:58 2015 UTC,At $298. The sale price this morning was $219. Good deal but I'll just wait for end of summer or the next REI SALE.
geocaching,3d9uff,ScatterMyCaches,10,Tue Jul 14 17:00:08 2015 UTC,"Noob question, but how does this compare to c:geo?"
geocaching,3d9uff,J5D1C7,14,Tue Jul 14 18:00:57 2015 UTC,I use c:geo and it has most if not all the features of the pro app
geocaching,3d9uff,animere,8,Tue Jul 14 19:01:56 2015 UTC,c:geo is way better.
geocaching,3d9uff,AntiMe,8,Wed Jul 15 01:34:30 2015 UTC,"One nice feature of c:geo I love? The other day I was doing a multi where once I was at stage 1 it said go 60 ft 100 degrees. Opened up ""Go to"" on c:geo, clicked on my coordinates to get my location, typed in 100 in the bearing, 60 ft in distance, and hit compass. It took me right to it. Or, if i'm looking for a benchmark, i just type in the coordinates and hit compass.    Also a HUGE feature is the ability to store the cache and map offline for when i'm in low signal area. Now i store everything I plan on finding by counties. I can also bring up the county list and hit map and it'll show just those listed caches on a map."
geocaching,3d9uff,joshuar9476,3,Tue Jul 14 21:10:55 2015 UTC,"Offline caching has always been in the official app. Navigating by heading and distance sounds interesting - not sure I've seen that feature in the groundspeak app, but I've never actually needed to look for it."
geocaching,3d9uff,MisuVir,3,Tue Jul 14 22:13:15 2015 UTC,The biggest issue for me is c:geo is not on the iPhone. It seems to be android only.
geocaching,3d9uff,takesthebiscuit,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:28:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, same here, I've been a premium member for awhile and used c:geo exclusively on Android but when I switched to iPhone the only decent app that I could find was the GS one."
geocaching,3d9uff,chipolux,3,Wed Jul 15 18:23:00 2015 UTC,"Has more features then the ""premium"" app from GS plus integrates ""other"" games that are not controlled by the Frog from Seattle.  GS could end this insanity tomorrow, just give the premium app away for free to premium members."

geocaching,3d9uff,MisuVir,2,Tue Jul 14 20:24:56 2015 UTC,Why does the free app has the message center but not the pro app?
geocaching,3d9uff,maingray,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:36:21 2015 UTC,It's a newer feature. The paid app is older and hasn't been updated for a while.
geocaching,3d9uff,dormatt13,2,Wed Jul 15 20:36:06 2015 UTC,"There has been quite a bit of confusion and misinformation regarding this topic, so I thought this might help answer some questions. A couple things to note:     The paid app will continue to function. It's not going to all-of-a-sudden stop working, so if you paid for it, you'll still have those features available to you. Trackables for the Intro (free) app is currently in development. I'm not sure about a release date. This chart is applicable for both iOS and Android.   Anyway, I hope this helps. Maybe add this to the sidebar since this is a common question?"
geocaching,3d9uff,Dollarama,2,Tue Jul 14 17:03:17 2015 UTC,We've started using the intro app for most of our family's caching. We only rarely use features like offline lists and we don't do trackables. The intro app interface and map just looks SO much nicer than the paid app.

geocaching,3dbb58,ohsureyoudo,3,Wed Jul 15 07:15:02 2015 UTC,"The CO replied to my message the other day- she was so thrilled we found it and loved the pictures we sent her. She told me she would have a friend head out to check on the cache and see if he could open/fix it, and told us if someone found the cache and was able to open it before her friend could, that she would give us a duplicate of the FTF reward. So kind! :)  As of right now the cache is disabled, her friend couldn't fix it on the spot and had to take it back to his house. As soon as it's re-enabled I will be back there in a flash to reclaim the FTF. :D  A perfect result all in all!"

geocaching,3dbb58,AnonymousDad,2,Wed Jul 15 03:03:08 2015 UTC,"No trick (well, there was a alphabetic lock on it that required we solve a riddle to open, which we did), not a decoy.

For a lot of people, they're only gonna try and find the geocaches in their immediate area, maybe 10km or so from around their home. For a lot of places, there's about 100-300 geocaches in a 10km radius of someone's home.   For me, it's a bit like... I've found all the ones around home... but I don't want to travel outside that ""easy zone"" to find all the others. I'll probably go geocaching for a few days around either side of summer, but otherwise it's just something I'm not fully into."

geocaching,3d8y1l,NewberryMathGuy,2,Wed Jul 15 05:06:10 2015 UTC,It's hard to say. A few years ago there were fewer caches that were quick easy park and grabs. Now you have lots of park and grabs and most states have large power trails. This means a new cacher can quickly go from 20 finds to 1000 finds in a few months in some states. I notice a good number of new cachers that usually disappear before they hit 100 and have met very few people that have gotten seriously into the hobby in the last year or so in my area.
geocaching,3d8y1l,deadcyclo,2,Wed Jul 15 17:44:10 2015 UTC,Heh. Guess both me and the wife are middle class and we have been at it since 2010. We hardly only ever cache during our summer vacation trips and maybe a weekend or two each year. Also we try to log at least one cache when we travel somewhere (not so easy on business trips). Also quality before quantity. I'll take a really cool cache instead of 30 boring caches if I have the choice. Finally since we mainly cache during travels we are always and for ever finding cool places while caching and end up staying for the rest of the day.
geocaching,3d8y1l,ABCDave,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:14:24 2015 UTC,"My theory is that there are two types of cachers: those who stick with it and those who don't.

If someone is middle class for a long time, my guess is that they are super casual but manage to make a handful of finds every year."

geocaching,3d6z40,ScatterMyCaches,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:23:04 2015 UTC,I had the same question. Sometimes when I use c:geo there are caches that will pop up but when I try to look at them on the normal geocaching app they are premium. I can't seem to get any consistency. I'm curious as to if I should just get a premium membership and stick with the free intro app. I've heard it has more maintenances and is watched more than the paid app.
geocaching,3d6z40,TheSnarfy,4,Tue Jul 14 00:34:42 2015 UTC,"Use the free app. It is being updated, the paid one is dead. Essentially gs has realised that making people pay twice makes no sense."

I do not want to use Intro app, because I paid for paid app and some features it offers (such as offline lists or much more available caches) so if I switched to Intro app without Premium membership (which I really do not want to buy because it is not worth it for me, I do not need premium caches and pocket queries), I would lost this ability!!"
geocaching,3d6z40,Vencanator,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:30:41 2015 UTC,"And what about Apple Watch support? Are you gonna add apple watch support to the paid app? I think you should upgrade both apps!

Or maybe you can merge apps and people who used to have paid app would get features they used to have when using paid app (even without premium membership)..."
geocaching,3d6z40,Vencanator,-3,Wed Jul 22 06:40:00 2015 UTC,"Incorrect. The free app for premium does NOT give you access to all geocaches, only traditional, puzzle and multicaches.

It's hard to tell without being able to examine the unit but if im half way into a 5h hike into the mountains and i drop this thing on a rock i don't want the screen to crap out on me.

The 40 & 60 are (were?) great units but felt kind of abandoned (wrt software updates and support) when they were declared ""done enough"". The company shifted priorities to devices hooked to services that could generate a continuous revenue stream.   Is Magellan out of the game now too?"

geocaching,3d1cj0,GiraffeInATree,3,Sun Jul 12 18:36:49 2015 UTC,"I normally place trackables in geocaches that take more time to find, caches like multies and hard mysteries or traditionals with a high terain difficulty. These caches are normally done by expierenced geocachers.   You can try to have your TB placed in only premium caches, but half of the time requests of TB's aren't adhered so they will probably end up in all sort of caches"
geocaching,3d1cj0,otherwise777,2,Sun Jul 12 19:00:59 2015 UTC,I prefer to place in premium caches. This is partially because I'm more likely to find another TB and swap it. Also because I feel like it might be safer and less likely to be kept.
geocaching,3d1cj0,Sketchlynx,2,Sun Jul 12 21:31:58 2015 UTC,"It's a risk of caching. All you can do is make it so that people DON'T want to take your trackable. Drill holes in it, spray paint it, make it unattractive."
geocaching,3d1cj0,funnyfarm299,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:58:44 2015 UTC,"IMO, the problem seems to be people that are new to caching.  Sometimes they pick them up and then aren't totally sure about what to do with them, or they don't visit other caches at all.   Newbies can have premium accounts so it likely won't matter what caches are premium or not.    I've launched bunches of trackables over the years and it's really just about luck.  Especially if they end up overseas.  Personally, I like my TBs to end up in busier caches so they keep moving along.  In the end, you're at the mercy of whoever picks it up."
geocaching,3d1cj0,ohsureyoudo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:45:24 2015 UTC,"This is my feeling on TBs too. If someone will take the time to get a higher difficulty or terrain rated cache, they will be more likely to log the trackable and follow the rules about trading for one and moving it on. The same goes (hopefully) for someone who is a premium member. So a premium cache would be good but you don't know where it will end up. I don't think most cachers actually read the missions of travel bugs."

geocaching,3d1cj0,bobisunreal,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:43:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I believe the owners of caches with an inventory should be responsible for upkeeping that information on a weekly basis, and just have an easier function to remove trackables from an inventory if they are not there.  I think functionality of the actual app would at least improve searching for trackables, even though it wouldn't change thieves."
geocaching,3d1cj0,badchrismiller,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:38:31 2015 UTC,Even if it is owner's who didn't place the TB in their own caches??? I agree if the cache is a TB hotel.
geocaching,3d1cj0,signal_must_die,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:00:05 2015 UTC,"I think so.  It would be more manageable for maintaining inventories.  I think the app needs better functionality for controlling that information.  Or maybe if it's reported missing, it auto sends the item out of the inventory."
geocaching,3d1cj0,badchrismiller,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:31:11 2015 UTC,Minimal to be honest. It would also add more work for those picking up the trackables to do the homework to see which caches are premium and which are not and that's not going to happen in this day of OCD geocaching.
geocaching,3d0rmj,zerochaos56,3,Sun Jul 12 15:36:35 2015 UTC,"If you are looking at inexpensive, you will want a garmin etrex 10/20/30.

It just took me 15 minutes to program 10 caches for a trip we're taking next week.  It does have a serial interface on the top, but AFAIK, it's read-only.  We have, for a while, used this ancient GPS as navigation, and used a smartphone for the cache information.  Might be something to think about (getting a cheap GPS) if budget is a concern."
geocaching,3d0rmj,timatlee,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:57:14 2015 UTC,I would have to recommend at least a etrex 20 so you can program it over usb. The etrex line is pretty cumbersome to program by hand.

geocaching,3ctx1p,MavEtJu,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:51:58 2015 UTC,"I will. The heart of the dispute between c:geo, a free opensource app, and Groundspeak is that the GS API imposes severe restrictions on basic members using any app, be they official or ""trusted partner"" apps. In other words, if you're a basic member, and using the GS app, or Cachesense, for example, you're only allowed to see 3 caches a day or something like that. That is why signal_must_die is saying if c:geo were allowed to use the API (which is closed to ""new"" developers now anyways), it would make c:geo worthless to regular members.

That is only if they always use the Live API, there is no technical reason why their current approach couldn't be used for regular members so they can have access to all data, independent of subscription status with Groundspeak.  I personally don't care too much about that limitation of 3, that is a political decision by Groundspeak. You can see them all on the website, just not via the Live API. Going premium was not a decision for me to get rid of that limitation. Or for seeing premium caches. It was for me to support the people who maintain the database and get access to more of the data.  If I would make a geocaching related app I would not even bother with trying to make it available for non-premium accounts: The Live API supports them barely, the Pocket Queries are not available. Let them deal with the Groundspeak app. Once they decided that it is a hobby for them and want to see more of the world and want go premium and also obtain data from other sources, that are the people who I would target.

If your main goal is something like using your phone for geocaching where there is no cell signal, the paid app is the way to go.

geocaching,3coclt,ScatterMyCaches,3,Thu Jul 9 16:55:50 2015 UTC,"What? I am sorry but this is a nonsense. Maybe Premium users benefit but not basic members using Paid app...  I feel that the only thing you wanna is just all people to get Premium membership instead of basic membership and paid app.  Let me tell you something about this topic (updates of paid app compared to Intro app). Developers states that they have made the decision to direct their app development resources toward the Geocaching Intro app to create an introductory geocaching experience on mobile that can be unlocked into a full geocaching experience with Premium membership. So they are currently focusing their efforts on developing and updating the free Geocaching Intro app which means they will not be adding new features like Message Center to the paid Geocaching app.  And now I would also like to cite another sentence: ""Additionally, the Message Center is a social feature intended to be used by all geocachers.”   What? How can it be intended to be used by all geocachers without update of paid App? What about the users without Premium membership and using paid app? I do not want to use Intro app, because I paid for paid app and some features it offers (such as offline lists or much more available caches) so if I switched to Intro app without Premium membership (which I really do not want to buy because it is not worth it for me, I do not need premium caches and pocket queries), I would lost this ability!!   Is it normal the free app to offer better functionality compared to the paid app? I do not think so, so I would like the paid app to offer at least the same functionality compared to Intro app. Why? Because I paid for the app and paid app now lack the Message Center, Apple Watch support and even better user interface (information about better user interface of the Intro app is directly from Groundspeak Community Manager).   So please think of the users using paid app without premium membership as well an not only of Premium members!"

geocaching,3coclt,ScatterMyCaches,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:29:13 2015 UTC,Yep you got it. It's traditional caches that are D/T below 1.5. The idea is that those will be easiest to find and give new geocachers a good experience.

geocaching,3co1w4,Mouryom,2,Thu Jul 9 12:05:47 2015 UTC,I'm not crazy about the Rubix idea because I've not been able to solve one. Ever. :-( But I like the library idea.
geocaching,3co1w4,dom812,2,Thu Jul 9 14:28:07 2015 UTC,"You would not have to solve the whole cube.  At worst, since the OP said they were only writing on one side, you would only need to solve the face with the numbers.  In actuality, you probably would not even need to do that.  The challenge of a standard Rubik's cube is the physical ordering of the pieces.  You can usually look at one and tell which square goes where (i.e., the corner with white/red/yellow goes in upper right, the square with white/red goes top center, etc.).    The OP might ask the Reviewer for their opinion on type of cache.  It seems to vary - in some locations this would be an unknown, others a multi with a field puzzle attribute."
geocaching,3co1w4,Sabrinacat2,2,Fri Jul 10 00:03:14 2015 UTC,Biggest problem with library caches is demonstrating adequate GPS usage. Make sure you build that in; eg the first stage is a cache outside the library containing directions to the next stage.
geocaching,3co1w4,maingray,2,Thu Jul 9 18:32:18 2015 UTC,The rubix cube should be a mystery cash
geocaching,3co1w4,bafl1,0,Thu Jul 9 16:54:52 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm confused about that because yes you have to solve a puzzle but there are also multiple waypoints. I'm not really sure what the categorize it as.
geocaching,3co1w4,maingray,2,Thu Jul 9 17:15:21 2015 UTC,"Although the lines are blurred between the two, I'd likely recommend a multi with the field puzzle attribute set. The first stage is at the posted coordinates (right? It's hard to tell from the description), and there is a simple field puzzle to get to the final. Multis often have some puzzle elements along the way. A cache fits better as a puzzle cache if there is nothing at the posted coordinates but all the information to find the final is found within the cache listing somehow.  (Plus puzzles are more likely to be ignored by the average player than even multis)."
geocaching,3co1w4,Curran919,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:39:56 2015 UTC,Depends largely on the complexity and difficulty.
geocaching,3co1w4,NewberryMathGuy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:58:43 2015 UTC,"A puzzle can have multiple waypoints as well. So list it as a puzzle, note on the page that it starts at posted and there is a field puzzle to solve. (Side note I hope you have a backup people will use the break apart method on a Rubik's)     A multi starts at posted and should follow simple clues and may contain basic math to solve for stages."

To access the cache, park at the Moccasin Slough park off raggedy point road. Head north east. Its a swamp so you might plan on getting wet. Once you get out of the forest the ground will be less solid. You might have to cross some streams, the ground is not solid on the banks of the streams. The easiest way would be to find the St. Johns river bank and follow it north to the cache. I hid it the day before thanksgiving and the water temp was perfect! Unfortunately I forgot to finalize the cache and it is just now being published however it is still out there and still just as hard to find. Last trip out there took an hour, and I know where it is, so plan accordingly. 30 07 44.58n 81 41 38.92w on google earth. Its in a tree. Good luck! Enjoy the beach!  D5 sounds wrong with this level of detail, but it might still be hard to find, only way to know is to get out there, T5 is more likely to be wrong, there is no need for special equipment like a boat ore climbing Gear.

It seems hard to fathom that multiple ISP have this problem and despite their geographic and network diversity they all suffer a common but individual problem (after all if what you say is true it's unique to each ISP) and not closer to your end of the network connect?

geocaching,3ckcj4,ScatterMyCaches,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:34:26 2015 UTC,"Sure, sorry about that. You may not be able to get the full context without all the other comments:    Thank you all for providing the situational data in this thread. I've compiled what's been submitted here, Facebook, Twitter and conversations I've had with few of you directly so I can effectively communicate the situation with our provider. I appreciate all of your time and effort, and am terribly sorry to hear that your experience accessing our resources has been degraded in recent weeks.  Painting a picture from all of the information provided, I believe ecanderson and cezanne are on the right track with there being a tier 1 ISP routing issue affecting folks in Germany and possibly other parts of central Europe. This is based on posted traceroute (tracert) output of users experiencing dramatically increased latency on middle hops and even packet loss.  In all the examples that I've seen so far, the dramatic latency increases are occurring after your provider hands the packet off to a tier 1 ISP, but before it reaches our provider. So neither of our providers' networks appear directly responsible, but some of the internet backbone peers that both of our providers rely on could be. Of the slow instances that I've reviewed, the traceroute output frequently shows routes that include tier 1 network providers Cogent and NTT. I found a relevant article on backbone/peering concerning Netflix that shows Cogent and NTT with higher latency than other providers and talks about the effect of slowing during peak times. Cogent also appears to have engaged in Quality of Service traffic deprioritization that might be worth noting.  Likely the best and only course of action is to draw attention to the routing issue and hope it gets resolved soon. I've initiated dialog with the network operations center of our provider, Internap, which you'll see in the last couple of hops of the traceroute output that folks have posted. I know that we utilize several BGP peers, which appear to include Cogent and NTT based on network hop naming. While many ISPs have agreements with these providers as BGP peers, it doesn't indicate if that agreement is direct or third-party, but they might have some influence in getting this resolved. I have asked for guidance on this situation and what options are available to us.  With all that said, I would still like to continue collecting more positive and negative experience data from end users in this thread. For those of you including time without specified time zones I'm assuming those are UTC. Since some of you have reported slow load times on Geocaching as well as the Discussion Forums, I would anticipate that load times across all resources at our Seattle Internap facility would yield similar results. It would be helpful to know if the performance is the same on both sites while logged in or browsing as an unathenticated guest. For those that mentioned accessing and tracing seattle.gov when Geocaching was slow to respond, might I suggest tracing origin.rhapsody.com and navigating through their music catalog. Rhapsody is hosted in our space and should have a route much closer to our own.  Traceroute output from positive experiences like UK user MartyBartfast reported, or anyone with a trans-Atlantic connection is also welcome. I'd also like to see output from those of you that have been using proxies or VPNs based out of different regions and are having success re-routing around some of these troubled hops/networks."
geocaching,3ckcj4,ScatterMyCaches,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:05:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  As expected, it's not actually a user ISP issue.   It's with how traffic is routed to your site from various locations through out the world.  As mentioned before, groundspeak being the owner of the problematic netblock are in a far better position to having their network provider pressure the peering points (the problem networks/routers owners) to fix this.      Home users tend to have very little sway with their ISP and most will provide no support other than if it is a direct problem with a home connections.   They certainly are not going to liase with a network provider in another country in order to try and fix access to one site."

geocaching,3ckcj4,bobisunreal,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:48:28 2015 UTC,I'm not on the tech side so I can't specifically report on what was checked. I asked the folks who do that sort of thing if there were any slowdowns happening that we know of.
geocaching,3ckcj4,bobisunreal,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:28:12 2015 UTC,so that just sounds like you only checked for server issues (please correct me if the assumption is wrong).  Can you please talk to your netblock provider and have them investigate issues on their network and if needs be ask them to push it further upstream.  Telling your users to get check with their ISP is just fobbing us off and unfortunately as home users most ISP will not give a care what problems are happening for one individual website.

In that case I put the remainder of the log into a note. Here is one example with the log and note. Plus, maybe most importantly, is nice for me to go back and read about it."
geocaching,3cbkwt,realoldfatguy,3,Tue Jul 7 08:44:46 2015 UTC,"IF I find an interesting cache or one that is well put together and planned, I will write a longer log.  For ""trash caches"" (ie - pill bottle screwed to the back of a tree on a trail), those get the TFTC.  Logs I find worse are these long draw out stories of how they have been finding 800 caches today starting at the butt crack of dawn and they copy and paste the same thing over and over again.      For example:  Another weekend trip to Cedar Rapids to enjoy the great caches in the area. So olkb and FishwomanIa and I talk about making the trip. Once again olkb gets a much better offer and leaves us at the altar. So that meant FishwomanIa and me for this trip. We met up before daylight and headed east bound down I-80 and it wasn't long before the down pouring of rain comes. The forecast was for rain on and off so I was hoping for more of off. That probably didn't turn out so well after reviewing it further.  Our first stop ironically was the same first cache we did about a month ago at the rest stop. Go and get the cache and realize a couple of things right off. Cedar Rapids got a lot more snow this past week than the 515 and the amount of standing water is incredibly high. As the frost line still remains high this makes the ground absorption not as good. So we go inside and get ready for the day and on the way out FWIA tells the worker- guy..""That's a pretty hat""...Really a 'Pretty hat"". The guy replies and says yep a friend got it for me from over in Tama. Well that turn out to be some foreshadowing for how our day would end after spending time in the 319 for the day.   I think I redeemed myself on a few caches so I can change the collection plate back to FWIA for needed to change her prescription on her glasses. I came through on a few for her today. We started the day in just west of 380 and then headed over to ELY and did the trail for a section. Then took Mt Vernon Road and came back to the airport area.   We grabbed a bite to eat on the way from the bike trail to Mt. Vernon. The guy in front of me tells the cashier he wants 250 worth of gas on his card. She laughs and says ""Really' You want $2.50 of gas and the guy says no I want $250 worth of gas on my card. Well that duh look was priceless. FWIA got a custom made sub and I had some chicken tenders and we refueled our bodies and back at it we go.  So after doing the Mt. Vernon HWY and then we headed back to the airport area and it was really raining good. We tried to do a couple of other caches on our list but thought it probably would be better another day when we were dry and happy. One of the caches today we saw lots of maple syrup being harvested. Matter of fact, they need to get out there and empty the bags and it is filling quickly. I took one of the bags off just to get a nice sweet taste and show FWIA what the process was all about.   Other things that happened today were we nearly hit a squirrel, goose and dog. None of those animals were harmed today while caching. Now there were a couple of dead deer that must have been harmed by somebody as the dead carcass was right beside the cache on a couple of occasions today.  So we were wet and cold and decided it was time to head back. FWIA then lets me know she needs Benton County and Tama County. She asked what county is Tama in...I promise I didn't laugh. She says she needs a cache there because it is the county seat. After a quick search there was only one cache that I wanted to get and it was the McFate Memorial cache. So we go in the DO NOT ENTER way and walked over to find our final cache of the day. I couldn't think of a more appropriate cache to end the day with that this one. Afterwards we headed over to Caseys to change clothes and get a bite to eat for the ride home. On the way home ClubMud calls me and distracts me from making the right turn so we missed the diagonal and had to take HWY 65 home. FWIA kept telling me we are going to get snow on Sunday and I refused to agree.   Today was a fun day and we had 69 smileys and 8 frowns. I left several bucknuts pencils in caches. Thanks for the cache-signed log."

In my standard log, I make an effort to name those I was caching with (because occasionally one of us will miss a cache, and can look back through logs to see when we actually found it) and mention something about the search (e.g. ""ACCLanMan went one way, HiDude went another, and I stepped off the cliff staring at my GPS"").  Honestly, straight ""TFTC"" logs upset me a lot less than the ones that include the Tolkein line about wandering, and quote a gazillion and a half stats in EVERY LOG."

For those that are just bison tubes hanging on a fence or on a bush with no real effort at story/history for why it exists where it does and isn't in any sort of area of significance, I'll most likely leave a ""Quick PNG, TFTC!"" and move on to the next in hope of finding something with at least a little local lore attached to it."

Caching isn't a numbers game to me, so I don't care about maintaining accurate stats. I also don't read other people's comments unless I'm having trouble and want to check that a cache his still present and hasn't been muggled.  I do sometimes create caches, but my area is very saturated and it's unusual to find a good spot that isn't already taken.  The place where I expend the most effort is in adding to existing caches. I never just log and leave, I have a bag of swag on me at all times that includes items small enough to fit in the tiniest nano. Where possible, I try to link the gift to the theme of the cache site in some way.  The fun aspect of caching for me is serendipity, so that's what I focus on when it comes to giving back."
geocaching,3cbkwt,Mouryom,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:32:35 2015 UTC,I've always wondered about the people who geocache without logging online. Do you have another way for keeping track of caches you have found? Or do you find few enough that it doesn't matter?
geocaching,3c8ba5,Curran919,7,Sun Jul 5 21:06:09 2015 UTC,"Although it is annoying, that's a minority. Just happened in a sequence! People after them had better logs.  I like the idea behind the cache (in honor of volunteer firefighters) but to be honest from a foreigner's perspective it's a fairly typical cache (ammo can in a stump in the woods.) Maybe there's a nice view or the trail is great, I don't know, but 345 finds and 1 favorite point suggest otherwise. The quality of a cache is proportional with the quality of the log, for the most part."

geocaching,3c703y,Beware_The_Sketch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:41:48 2015 UTC,"I live in southeast Alaska. Living here is pretty 50/50. It's like living on an island. It has its perks like low population, and amazing scenery. But getting out of Alaska/getting stuff here is a huge pain in butt. Sadly we kind of become blind to the scenery. I grew up right outside Denali and saw Mt. McKinley daily and rarely took note. We have to make a point to go out and enjoy it, like hiking, hunting, geocaching, etc. One thing that drives people from the lower 48 (the chunk of states stuck together) nuts is the sun, or lack there of. In the summer the sun only goes down for a few hours here, and most of us can sleep thorough it easily. In the winter the sun is only UP for a few hours. We take lots of vitamin D, and have 'happy lamps' if we can afford it."

That's just in the one small camping area though (I think they call it Area 51). It's a well organized event with a permanent home at a nice rural County Fairgrounds, you can't go wrong."

Will stick with Geowoodstocks and the other events that we enjoy so much :-)"

Which I would say is actually unlikely anyways, as I'm pretty sure the 310 has joystick character entry. :-). I've been caching for years too, maybe I'll learn something; can they upload these ""marked as found"" caches, and there will be a blank log for them to fill in?"
geocaching,3c8hp9,tiikerikani,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:30:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, when you upload the field notes there's a list that you have to click on to edit each log before you post it.

I made this field notes file on c:geo so I had to input some text (which appears when I click ""compose log"", but the interface after upload looks like this."
geocaching,3c8hp9,maingray,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:10:11 2015 UTC,Yes. He doesn't need to have typed anything on the GPS unit. There will still be a nice list on gc.com to click through and edit.

geocaching,3c449f,coreyshep,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:25:57 2015 UTC,"Why the stop of challenge caches, and what were challenge caches?"
geocaching,3c449f,crapplegate,2,Sat Jul 4 17:56:32 2015 UTC,"A challenge cache is a geocache that has additional geo-related requirements that need fulfilled before logging a Find. I'm a fan of these types of caches and feel they bring a new level of difficulty to the game. The most noteworthy of all challenge caches would be the Well Rounded Cacher AKA ""The Fizzy Challenge"".   A post on Geocachings forum claims frustration and misunderstanding of logging requirements, lack of separate cache type, and ""appeals made to GC HQ"" as reasons for stopping challenge caches."
geocaching,3c449f,Sketchlynx,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:35:39 2015 UTC,Ugh! I just found out about Fizzy Challenges last night! There's actually one near me that I've considered considering. That challenge looks EVIL!

geocaching,3c449f,northernpenguin,2,Sun Jul 5 22:53:12 2015 UTC,"And just to clarify... the moratorium is only on creation of additional challenge caches.  Existing published challenges are still valid, and will continue to be at least through the moratorium.  My suspicion is that Groundspeak is going to implement a challenge checker function (similar to the one that already exists at project-gc.com), and after the year, will announce a cache type or attribute specific to challenges, and require new challenges to work within whatever limits their challenge checker has.  I think it's very unlikely that Fizzy, Jasmer, County, DeLorme, etc. challenges will go away."
geocaching,3c449f,tanjental,3,Sat Jul 4 21:10:58 2015 UTC,But but what about the must cache in four time zones on the same day collecting all 81 DT combinations but only on a Thursday while wearing Bermuda shorts caches?

geocaching,3c43tz,Bigmada,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:27:13 2015 UTC,I have a 5D mystery I'm planing on grabbing when the time comes. I've had it figured out for about 6 months just have to make the drive. If not I have about 40 caches solved all over the state I just need to get my butt in gear to get them. My first plan was to do a T5 cache that is in town on the river islands but I was going to wade out since I don't own a boat. The high amount of rain we had this year is making that a no go.
geocaching,3c1a0i,timatlee,16,Fri Jul 3 21:05:23 2015 UTC,Email the CO.  Tell them what you have done and ask if they can provide any guidance.
geocaching,3c1a0i,DiscoWolf,4,Fri Jul 3 21:26:07 2015 UTC,"I'll back this one up.  There is rarely a CO that won't help.  Also looking at who's found it and email them for a hint is also useful and will get you connected with other puzzle cachers.  Out here in San Diego, there was a pretty tight group for a while, I even had a CO drive out to a cache to help us find it after we called for help."
geocaching,3c1a0i,wongun,2,Sat Jul 4 01:39:25 2015 UTC,"I would recommend asking former finders only if the CO will not respond to your questions and you feel you must find this particular cache.  The reason is that a lot of former finders will just give you the coords, or tell you exactly how to solve, and that takes all the fun out of the puzzle as the CO intended.  If you're going to do that, might as well ignore puzzles and only hunt traditionals."
geocaching,3c1a0i,DiscoWolf,2,Sat Jul 4 13:31:52 2015 UTC,I agree if you are going to ask for the answer but asking for a hint or nudge in the right direction does not take away from the puzzle necessarily.  Again taking to other cachers will only get you more involved.
geocaching,3c1a0i,wongun,3,Sat Jul 4 14:12:56 2015 UTC,"I agree, but wanted to warn that a lot of cachers are not good at giving out nudges or hints on puzzles that aren't theirs.  I have had cases where I asked a former finder for a hint, and they completely gave away the puzzle.  The CO will be much more careful with their hints (unless they don't care about the puzzle, in which case, neither should you).  I totally encourage you to work with other cachers on puzzles.  However, I would recommend working with people who haven't already solved it.  Two heads are better than one, and all that."
geocaching,3c1a0i,DiscoWolf,2,Sat Jul 4 14:54:51 2015 UTC,Ya I've seen that too.  Good note of caution.
geocaching,3c1a0i,wongun,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:38:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I did email the CO, and he provided a hint - but I haven't been able to digest it yet.  Thanks for all the suggestions and conversation!"
geocaching,3c1a0i,NewberryMathGuy,3,Sat Jul 4 22:36:22 2015 UTC,No worries. We do not want any threads on specific puzzles. There are lots of good resources. I strongly suggest ePeterso's series to new puzzle solvers.    But even the more experienced puzzle cache solver runs into dead ends. At that point you have a few options: 1. Put it away for a day or two and ponder on it. 2. Recruit help from other local cachers who have yet to crack it. 3. Message the CO. Most active CO's want their caches found and most will give you a nudge.    Good luck!

I was stunned by the interest and the level of bidding on this item, I never expected that, so it has been fun and interesting.  I learned about geocaching and realized from many of the messages I received that probably the younger folks didn't understand the reference to Al Capone's vault so I'll educate on that, it was the 1980's I believe when a hidden vault was found that was believed to have belonged to Al Capone, a network made a huge production in a live prime time television show that millions of people tuned in to watch the opening of Al Capone's vault to see what it would contain, listening for an hour as various people speculated on the possible contents and when it was finally opened....absolutely nothing, not a coin, not a scrap of paper, nothing.  Thus my reference to Al Capone's vault was indicating it could contain nothing.   Thank you to all the people who contacted me informing me what the item is so I didn't end up with a very disappointed buyer who no doubt would have felt deceived (except those rude people who accused me of being a liar and a thief and of knowing what the item was, clearly I didn't and I hope you'll think before you stick your foot in your mouth again).   Lastly, to all those who bid, thank you, I hope you aren't too disappointed. I would also encourage everyone to consider a donation to the organization I was going to share this with, I do NOT represent BEAKS, I do NOT work for them, I have not informed anyone there about this, I have just taken injured birds to them in the past and appreciate what they do, if this can bring them some donations, then it's provided an excellent service.  http://www.beaksbirdkare.org/"""

Also as someone with canning experience can tell you that jar is a newer style and the lid ring is relatively pristine (it would rust and not get a greenish patina)."
geocaching,3bsbex,Damage1200,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:42:38 2015 UTC,It really does look like he went to town on the bottle with a couple matte colors. Sounds like a scam or it actually is a geocache.
geocaching,3bsbex,bloodyhaze,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:23:20 2015 UTC,"The Kerr ""Self Sealing"" Mason Jar was made starting in 1915. Around 1930 they started using a mold for the glass... With the pictures provided no edging can be seen, so there's a chance this Jar is pre 1930.  However, it looks extremely prestine which is odd."
geocaching,3bsbex,31stan,3,Wed Jul 1 20:09:04 2015 UTC,After the tree grew around it could of perserved it.  Also the seller could of cleaned it up.  I woulf take a $50 gamble on buying it.  Not 200 though.

My point is that unless you're going to periodically audit your physical log against the one on the Geocaching site, then how will you ever know how many people really did find it and how many are lying about it? Personally I just don't care. Unless there are actually geocaching groupies that fawn over those people with the highest find counts, then the liars gain nothing by lying except for whatever delusional importance they ascribe to their find count. It's like reddit karma in that way.  Lets also not confuse geocaching with Groundspeak.

If log is missing or soaked etc as one mentioned above thats different. If a cacher just doesnt come properly prepared then thats on them and theyll need to come back with the tools they need to get it.

I've spotted them, but never logged as found. That's not how it works. You have to sign the book. I don't log as found and pout that it was too high. I just go after another cache.

Physical caches can be logged online as ""Found"" once the physical log has been signed.   To be polite, you may wish to message them and ask them to remove the log themselves."

I went out at dawn, found all of them (signed the logs), but just didn't get around to logging them on line until later that day.  I laughed when later that day, his logs showed up going ""crap, I didn't get the FTF on this one..."".  lol  I have joked with him at events, threatening to get a 1/1 cache published right next to his house, but not actually place it, then hide in the bushes and record him frantically thrashing around looking for it.  lol"

Find logs get posted from home."
geocaching,3bpi4g,MavEtJu,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:34:59 2015 UTC,"Logging later is totally fine. But weeks later is generally frowned upon; for instance in some cases COs are very on top of verifying finds in the log. What if you log on the site so late that the physical log has since been replaced and you signature cant be verified, this of course could perpetuate cheating.   Another exception is, now with the summer challenge, logging finds late can be used to achieve the summer challenges which have specified start dates.  Not to say this is what youre trying to do, but just be mindful that when rules get super loose in a community there are people who will take advantage of that. So Id say try to log as soon as you can within reason."

geocaching,3bpi4g,jocke92,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:32:50 2015 UTC,Before the phone based geocaching started you weren't able to log it directly. As such there is nothing wrong with doing it whenever you have time for it.

I was camping in a National Forest outside Crater Lake (no cell signal) and came across a big wooden platform. I thought to myself, ""There has to be a geocache here!"" So I started searching in likely places. I saw a rock that looked a little out of place, picked it up and found the container hiding behind it. I felt pretty proud of myself."

They took upwards of an hour sometimes, though it was a lot of fun.  Last weekend I was in the vicinity of a mystery cache I'd solved, and searched for that without the final coords. I'd remembered roughly where it was from google maps, though I ended up solving the puzzle again after 10 mins of not finding it.  Another time, I was out scouting for a place to hide another cache, and there were a couple of archived caches within proximity of where I was. At the time however I wasn't even thinking about them, and on a whim looked in a guard rail. Lo and behold, there was a tiny nano! It took some sleuth work to figure out what listing it belonged to, as there were some mysteries/multis among these archived. It turned out to be a traditional, which was too close to a firing range/prison and had incorrect coordinates."

Geocaching premium gives you a few more cashes, more details and a wider search area on the sp but most importantly PQs which enable you to do a large area search and then either send to phone for offline use or download as one file for your gps. Gardening gloves are useful to prevent scratching, other than that if you are out in the country then your usual outdoor stuff. Geocoins are trackable items, if you find one you move it to a cashe a distance away and log the code so the owner can see where it is."

geocaching,3bfdx2,Learnincurve,3,Sun Jun 28 19:48:44 2015 UTC,"When it comes to logging etiquette, cache owners really appreciate if you write more in your log than just a simple ""TFTC"". Sometimes CO's put hours of work into their caches (depending on the cache), and when someone finds it only to write ""found it"" or "":)"" it can be very frustrating because it's like their hard work goes unnoticed or unappreciated. When you log a cache you can write about why you decided to go out caching that day, the journey of getting to the cache/locating the cache, if you traded any swag, and then any final overall comments about the cache. The same goes for DNF's (did not finds). Sometimes DNFs can be hints for other users. In your DNF's you can again mention why you went out and your journey to the cache. Then describe your search for the cache. And logging DNFs is a good thing because it notifies the owner so they can check on it. It also helps determine with archiving if it's a ""dead"" cache. I know a lot of cachers that won't even bother logging DNFs, but they do help, and it's not like they decrease stats or anything. So do that too 👍"

It's unique to the person who placed the geocaches  .yes, c:geo will allow you to mark the cache as found  .c:geo is by far the best app for android. Don't bother with the geo god's confusing geocaching apps. Don't pay for an app with an android. Never.  .etiquette perhaps a thank you for a good cache, TFTC for ones that no effort was placed (pill bottle, lamp post skirt, 10 cent containers etc)  .geocaching premium is a tax paid to geogod inc. for those with severe OCD. Not needed if using c:geo. You can download gpx files using browser extensions, cachelist for Chrome is very good.    .don't believe the lies on here, premium only caches can be found and logged with a regular account. see other threads here for details  .none unless it is a 5 terrain cache which indicates special equipment. use common sense if you are hiking a distance  .geocoins are items people regularly steal from geocaches. Okay, they are meant to log and move on to another cache or be discovered at events via a code you enter but the moment they show up in a cache, they go missing"
geocaching,3bfdx2,signal_must_die,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:56:30 2015 UTC,"I would like to note that apps like c:geo make money off adverts but just rip data off the official groundspeak servers. Also there may be underhanded ways to see premium cashes but you shouldn't be able to log them as found on the official site, if there is a work around for that then you run the risk of being banned. I would say that it's not the cleverest thing to admit to doing in a sub that groundspeak employees frequent.  Premium cashes are usually made by people who don't want them found by idiot teenagers just downloading free apps to destroy cashes, sometimes it's paranoia but a lot of the time it's justified."
geocaching,3bfdx2,Learnincurve,2,Sun Jun 28 21:23:12 2015 UTC,"This isn't true: it's perfectly possible to log premium caches (it's ""caches"", not ""cashes"", by the way) without a premium account, and I believe that's by design: so that if a group of people go out together and find a premium cache (because one of them has a premium account) they can still all log it.  Before I had a premium account, I've done it myself! The first time, I looked at the premium cache's description and even though I didn't have the accurate coordinates, I was able to work out where it must be, find it, sign the log, and log it on the web. The second time around, I used an... ""underhanded"" way to find the coordinates. Nowadays, of course, I have a premium account.  But it seems to be perfectly legitimate and accepted to log a premium cache (so long as you can find it) regardless of your status.  On the topic of c:geo - these apps get the same data from the Groundspeak servers that you can get for yourself, i.e. .loc files if you're not premium, .gpx files if you are, as far as I'm aware. As far as I can see they don't do any screen-scraping and so don't violate the terms of use."
geocaching,3bfdx2,avapoet,2,Sun Jun 28 22:01:14 2015 UTC,The workaround for logging premium caches with a regular account is fully endorsed by GeoGod Inc. It's designed that way so that a family of 4 doesn't have to buy 4 separate premium membership accounts.
geocaching,3bfdx2,signal_must_die,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:05:20 2015 UTC,Yes but somebody within your group has to pay.  You are essentially talking about piracy.    I don't understand why people are so tight/cheap. a dedicated gps or a smartphone with GPS in it costs hundreds and the pcs you use for these work arounds can cost thousands. If you can't afford the small amount of disposable income you need to go premium you might want to think about if you can afford all this technology in the first place.
geocaching,3bfdx2,Learnincurve,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:26:23 2015 UTC,"No piracy at all. If GS Inc doesn't want regular members to see premium caches on a map, search, or doesn't want them log them as a regular member, they can stop this. But GS Inc wants people to see premium caches in order to get people to pay the GS tax. GS is evil in my opinion, treat paying customers like crap, lack any privacy controls, and that stupid frog mascot must die."

geocaching,3beg93,TheRipsawHiatus,6,Sun Jun 28 13:43:38 2015 UTC,"As far as I am aware, geocaching is pretty much what you will find on the geocaching.com website. There is an app for i-phones and for android (what I use) there are a few apps. I think these are all just platforms to access the information on the website in a smartphone friendly format. I use c:geo.  Within geocaching.com though, there are all sorts of ways to challenge yourself. There are difficulty and terrain ratings and comments to gauge how tough your finds are. you can view friends stats and compete and message each other that way. there are puzzle caches and multi-caches to step up the complexity and difficulty in various and original ways. There are badges awarded for finding caches in new locations, mile-stone caches or special holidays or time/location based finds. There are published lists and trails or series of caches for which you can earn geocoins or other awards. You can get a prize sometimes for being the first person to find a cache (FTF!). There are the trinkets themselves that you find and I suppose could chose to keep.   And it goes on from there... The most incredible thing about geocaching, I believe, is that it is all user generated and curated and the possibilities are endless for the types of ""containers"", levels of difficulty, secrecy, fun and creativity.  I will add though that geocaching.com has experimented with challenges (more like what you are asking) where there were all sorts of points and awards for random and often user submitted challenges. I don't know how well that took off though. YOu may also what to look at something like letterboxing, or other types of location based treasure hunting games but they are not technically geocaching.   best of luck, and if you do have any new and creative ideas, do share them with the class :)"

(Besides, one of my personal challenges is to not attempt anymore new caches until I've found at least half of the ones I DNF. Haha)  And I'll look a little more into Letterboxing. What little I've read about it sounded right up my alley.   Thanks again!"

It's also possible to then show your full stats or (as I've done) just your badges and belt on your profile on the geocaching website.

geocaching,3beg93,fluffman86,2,Sun Jun 28 18:45:25 2015 UTC,"I tried to get into Ingress a year ago and found the game stale and repetetive. I attacked enemies in my hometown and got told off by my own faction because the were ""planning something"". Well, ok, but how the fuck am I supposed to get XP if I cant attack? Got stuck on level 4 for a month and then uninstalled..."
geocaching,3beg93,cattrain,2,Mon Jun 29 04:19:24 2015 UTC,"Came here to recommend Ingress.

It doesn't even build a map of where you've been like most things do.  Worst of all, you'll never look up from your phone to enjoy the places you go while out."

geocaching,3bbeo1,KalixBlank,4,Sat Jun 27 16:38:50 2015 UTC,"Do a search of your local area, it should show but not give you the coordinates of the premium caches in your area. You can log premium caches without a premium membership via the backdoor. You can use chrome or firefox extensions to download gpx files.  So yes, it's a complete waste of money to fork over for premium membership. Also be careful, the default setting for premium membership is auto-billing. If you must try it, just do it for one month at 3 bucks and see how you like it."
geocaching,3bbeo1,psb0316,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:37:57 2015 UTC,Thanks for the help! I don't mind paying for just a month to try it out but I can't seem to find the option anywhere? 3 months seems to be the minimum.  Is the 1 month option only available in the US or something? I'm from the UK.
geocaching,3bbeo1,Dexiro,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:52:00 2015 UTC,"OP is mistaken. 3 months is the minimum for 10 bucks a month, not sure how this breaks out in UK currency. If you own a handheld GPS unit, a very good chance you get one month free premium membership with it. Even if you bought it years ago.  www.geocaching.com/garmin/freetrial.aspx  And to others, you DO NOT HAVE TO BE A PREMIUM MEMBER TO LOG PREMIUM MEMBER CACHES. Read the thread for instructions."

geocaching,3bbeo1,signal_must_die,3,Sun Jun 28 02:08:09 2015 UTC,"You have to ask yourself first: what do you expect from a premium membership.   Is it just the premium caches? In that case do a three month one and see how much there are around you.  Or is it also for the pocket queries, different maps, and the support of the people who run the website/database you are using?"
geocaching,3bbeo1,MavEtJu,2,Sat Jun 27 21:54:18 2015 UTC,"The app I use for iPhone shows me on the map where premium caches are located, but doesn't give me an exact distance away, or any details. It just says it's unavailable. You should be able to see where they are, just no other details. This would give you an idea of how many are in your area.   On two occasions my friend, who uses a Samsung s4 clicked on the premium caches and kept them up for a few minutes and eventually the app allowed her access to them by some fluke. We've found some premium caches even without being premium members because of that fluke. I know it's cheating, forgive me!"
geocaching,3bbeo1,joost68,2,Sun Jun 28 03:01:22 2015 UTC,"The only reason for paying for premium membership is the ability to make pocket-querrys. I don't care for those premium caches, never search or found one and I don't think I ever will."
geocaching,3bbeo1,basket_weaver,2,Sun Jun 28 12:11:53 2015 UTC,"Is it OK for just, say, myself to get premium, but my partner and friend also log down the caches as well, or would they also have to pay in order to do that?   They will not be able to log the caches, as they will not be able to access them. They could come along with you to find them, but would not get any ""official credit"" for doing so.   Edit: it occurred to me just after posting that when you said log, you may have meant signing the log book, rather than logging them online. I suspect this matter will have differing opinions, but my opinion would be that as long as the cache is respected, anyone who participated in the find is entitled to sign the logbook."
geocaching,3bbeo1,psb0316,3,Sat Jun 27 16:46:31 2015 UTC,"How to search, find and log premium caches as a non-premium member.  1) go to the main page of geocaching.com 2) in the search box, enter where you want to search 3) in the results page, it will show you the results, the premium caches will have ""Upgrade now"". However, it will also list how far and in what direction the premium cache is without giving exact coordinates. 4) However, you can adjust your search settings to tinker with until you within x feet of a premium cache. It's almost like solving a puzzle cache to do it that way and quite fun.  Doesn't work for premium puzzle caches because you need to description of the cache to do that.   ------------To log a premium cache as a non-premium member--------- Simply do this in your browser www.geocaching.com/seek/log.aspx?wp=GC Code   with of course the GC code being the actual GC code of the premium cache.   Enjoy"

I think the other benefits of premium membership make it well worth the little money they want. Bookmark lists, pocket queries, favorite points etc etc."

Edit: as /u/basket_weaver states, non-premium members wouldn't be able to electronically log them in any case.  As far as I know, the only way to find out what premium caches are around is to be a premium member, so I guess you'd have to ask a premium member friend in order to get an idea.  The iPhone app doesn't change, other than the fact that search results include premium caches, if you set it up to do so."

Completely free and legal  2) You can always pay Garmin for City Navigator maps for your GPSmap. Quite expensive.   3) Torrents. Just search City Navigator, download.

geocaching,3b2hjz,richg0404,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:01:21 2015 UTC,I have never used CacheSense so I can't really compare but I have been using GCDroid for over a year and have been very happy with it. I believe that the free version of the app is fully functional for the first month so you can give it a good work out.
geocaching,3b2hjz,tanjental,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:56:17 2015 UTC,"I think you'll find Cachesense and GCDroid pretty similar.  I've used both a little (not extensively), primarily been a c:geo guy.    I'm trying now to use GCDroid exclusively, as a replacement app... and it's going okay.  I tried the same with Cachesense a year or so ago, and found myself missing things I'd gotten used to (the app may have improved since).  A few nice GCDroid features I've seen -- two click ('pick county, pick region') download and install of offline maps, optionally showing the .1mi circles on the map, using the radar from GPS Status (external app).  Neither one does the ""show me the map of this area"" quite as cleanly as c:geo (because they're both tied to the API and its usage limits, and are trying to keep you from hitting those cutoffs).  But for ""prepared caching,"" where you have stored caches/maps, I so far prefer GCDroid a little bit over CacheSense.  One feature I'd like that I've never seen an app do is give me an easy way to start the camera w/o having to exit the geocaching app."
geocaching,3b2hjz,psb0316,0,Tue Jun 30 11:50:49 2015 UTC,geocaching.com too stupid to actually put out a proper app and several that just confuse people so they use c:geo. Their own app won't even find some of their own geocaches like whereigo.
geocaching,3b1fxn,harrigan55,6,Thu Jun 25 04:58:13 2015 UTC,It's a courtesy to ask the CO before a random other finder but obviously you ask friends before CO. Sometimes you have reason that the last finder will be more useful than co

I try to ask the CO first to be courteous, unless one of my friends already found the cache, then I'll shoot them a text.  I rarely ask the last finder, but if the CO doesn't answer or hasn't logged into geocaching.com in a long time (> a year), I'll ask a recent finder."
geocaching,3b1fxn,CompletelyLurker,3,Thu Jun 25 07:26:01 2015 UTC,Yea I don't have any other friends that cache and there's a person in my town that has a signature hiding style.

I've come to greatly appreciate the people to leave a very subtle/vague hint in their find logs to help those who might be struggling. Then it's a whole new puzzle to scroll through all the logs for a clue."
geocaching,3b1fxn,madeofmusic,2,Thu Jun 25 20:09:15 2015 UTC,Yea I was pretty frustrated. I chose the cache for the 2 star difficulty and apparently that's only true if you know the hide style. I appreciate the flair but dang.

geocaching,3aqcbw,nyran20,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:25:16 2015 UTC,I have issues with c:geo too. The compass will randomly spin around even if I'm not moving and the distance will randomly change.
geocaching,3aqcbw,Wolfmanownz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:57:06 2015 UTC,I had the stuck compass yesterday when I was out. I just restarted m phone and it was fixed. I don't know what was the cause. I also have problems with my position jumping around. When I go out with my phone I also learned to take it off power save mode and use the highest accuracy setting for GPS. Seems to fix a lot of my issues since I used to get my location to jump really bad. It still does once in a while but not as bad. Also keep in mind your phone is not going to be as accurate as a handheld GPS so 30 feet sounds about right. I've been able to get my app to get me as close as ten feet before but that's only because I've learned how to read the jumping around and using the sat maps.
geocaching,3aqcbw,black_fox288,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:25:33 2015 UTC,So is it worth getting a dedicated GPS?
geocaching,3aqcbw,black_fox288,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:19:22 2015 UTC,I carry one in case my phone decides to act up but rarely use it.  I also got it a long time ago (bushnell onix 200). I've only had one cache I couldn't find due to equipment failure and that was why I decided to dig out the GPS. Most times though I can triangulate the area of the cache within about 10 ft with my phone by just walking around the area.
geocaching,3aqcbw,MisuVir,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:25:32 2015 UTC,"If it is anything like the iPhone compass, you can run it through a calibration procedure to get it working. Haven't done it for a while, but it used to be waving it around in a figure 8 pattern.   1) Is the compass thing a phone issue, c:geo issue, or owner stupidity problem? ;-)   It probably pulls the compass data from the OS, so it is likely to be a calibration problem. Does your Android have a system app for the compass? Try running that and see if it the compass works.   2) How close do you have to be to a cache before you put your phone down and use your eyes?    Within 10 metres, I'm already looking around for any obvious hiding spots. Usually though, I'll follow my iPhone until it says I'm right on top of it... then go wandering to find the actual cache location.   a lot of ground to cover   Perhaps, but your GPS gives you the general direction and distance while your eyes narrow down the possibilities.   3) If you use your GPS for a phone and select a cache and navigate to it using the compass, on the bottom mine says '+/- 12.8 feet' -- is that good? However this was outside my house with a clear view of the sky.   GPS accuracy depends on your phone. With my old iPhone 4, I'd consider myself lucky to actually lock onto the GPS signal and get within 10m. With my iPhone 5, I've not had a spot of GPS trouble and I'm always dropped within a metre or two of the selected coordinates."

geocaching,3alai7,TheyUsedDarkForces,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:17:45 2015 UTC,I find it's better than Google Maps here in Australia too. We have OSM contributors who add new roads as soon as they are constructed. Meanwhile Google Maps can take months to be updated.

You have no idea if the pole is grounded because if it isn't, your about to become the ground after an unknown amount of time charging up. I almost made the same mistake during an internship, surveying. Assholes like to chop the last 6 feet of the grounding wire and sell it for scrap. Be very careful around poles don't mean to be a debt downer but its a very easy thing to forget or not consider. After all this is very clever."

I don't think hints are needed, just double check to make sure that no acronym might correspond to multiple movies. Also I don't think the pool is too big, as Curran919 might have said, because, yknow, the category.... good category.   Solution is probably 03 83 75 06   09 05 09 95  76 56 48 79   82 78 82 68 ?  You could also use ceremony number."
geocaching,3af5o8,tanjental,2,Sat Jun 20 01:10:12 2015 UTC,You're right. C could refer to both Crash and Chicago which were two years apart.
geocaching,3af5o8,Flying_Video,2,Sat Jun 20 05:28:36 2015 UTC,"I tried just googling ""movie initials ToE"" and found a link that gave me the correct answer back.  Same worked for OFOtCN.  So longer acronyms will become fairly trivial to get.  The shorter acronyms will obviously be much harder to use with the search tactic... but then they'll also frustrate people since they get many more possibly correct answers.  Without any other information, ""C"" could be Cabaret, Cadence, Caligula, Capone, Capote, Cannonball, Cars, Castaway, Casablanca, Chaplin, Cinderella, Clerks, Cloverfield, Clue, .... yadda yadda.  (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films:_C)  I wonder if perhaps taking this tactic, and adding something visual (like a generic head shot of an actor in each one) might work.  You can make this easy (""TG"" and a picture of Tom Cruise), or harder by using less recognizable people and/or actors with smaller, forgettable bit parts (""C"" with a photo of Martin Mull).  One thing I like to do on coordinate puzzles is try to vary the difficulty - make the first numbers in each coordinate pretty easy to get, the last ones harder.  That helps the cacher figure out what to do on numbers they can already pretty much guess (since the degrees are almost always going to stay the same as the posted coord, and the minutes usually within a few digits)."

geocaching,3acsdh,Moderndinosaur,23,Fri Jun 19 12:46:46 2015 UTC,"on a beautiful summer day, I took a bike ride out to a woodsy park.   I followed this tiny path through vegetation until I was close to the cache, and began to look. And a few minutes later, baddabing! Huge ammo can tucked away in the truck of a tree. Inside I found logs dating back 10 years, and some random nick-nacks which also looked pretty old.   It was an amazing moment. In my hands, was a container full of junk, essentially. But in that moment, I realized how geocaching was more than finding containers of random tat, it was about finding these secret objects that only certain people know about, tucked away from the rest of the world. Looking through that log book, reading off names of people i'd probably never meet, I felt like I was part of some weirdo underground cult. It was awesome.  Now get out there and cache!"

My hooked for life caching moment was just this past fall after i decided to focus on caches with lots of fave points. Took me to an alley with seemingly nothing there. Spent an hour there the first time. Determined to find it i came back and found something in a barrier pole. I had to reach in, stick my fingers into theses holes and twist and pull this pvc pipe contraption up and out of the pole. Then i had to wrap a strip of canvas around the pvc to read some instructions which had me attach a magnet to the bottom of the pvc & stick the pvc back into the pipe to catch the metal tube that held thr log. Hard to explain but it was a damn masterpiece of a puzzle & one hell of a design. I was so thrilled leaving there with my Found it smiley."

If u try one thats too hard leave and go do some difficulty 1 caches. And you can always come back to ones you couldnt figure out; we all do. And many times it might take 2+ visits before u finally have the Ah Ha moment. Those are always the best bc the cache usually turns out to have been right in front of u the whole time
geocaching,3aayz3,TheTretheway,6,Thu Jun 18 17:06:02 2015 UTC,If they are going to call in the road trip they should do something different than the usual stuff they always do. Maybe make it do a cache more than 50 miles from your home location.

There's something similar near me, where an entire hill is saturated with caches, but I don't mind it so much because they're all part of a giant puzzle series.  It's set up sort of like a scratch off lottery, where you pick one of several possible cards on the cache page, then have to find the right images in the caches to get a ""BINGO"", which then gives you the coords of the final.   You could theoretically luck out and only need to find five minicaches to complete it, or you might have to hunt all over to get enough.

These are ""replacement caches"" some people take along with them.  If they can't find the cache, they assume it is missing, sign the log and the place it where they think it should be.  I have had people do this to my caches and when I go out to check, find the original cache where it should be.   If you find part of the cache, then yes, I would sign the log and record it as a find (with a NM log as well), but I do not want other cachers replacing or doing maintenance on my caches.  I did find one that had been hit by lightning.  It was a fake bird house on a tree and it was blasted to pieces, some probably 30-40 feet away, along with parts blown off the tree.

What if it's surrounded by poison oak?  What if you forgot your pen?  Everyone has their own opinions.    There are no ""official"" rule on what you consider a find, so you have to do whatever you think is the way to do it.  At the very least, you should probably leave a ""Needs Maintenance"" log."

geocaching,39x9hc,d70,7,Mon Jun 15 15:31:02 2015 UTC,I wished I would have read this last week when I bought the paid app. I kinda feel ripped off.
geocaching,39x9hc,henzeus,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:48:57 2015 UTC,Sorry about that. The full featured app is still fully functional and has some features the free app doesn't have yet.
geocaching,39x9hc,ScatterMyCaches,3,Tue Jun 16 16:28:56 2015 UTC,"I'm inclined to agree with ""Henzeus"" here. I also purchased the full paid app which you would believe would have the same functionality and better features then the free one and would receive more updates first.   If purchasing an app that you pay to support the efforts,  updating should reflect those who bought it. Not that you want to improve the efforts of the free app only to circumvent the paid app and steer people more towards annual subscriptions.  It either sounds like greed or a misleading precedent on paying for a full app.  This isn't how it's supposed to work at all.  Why pay a premium only to find out it's not going to be supported.  That's just bad business.  Worst yet, it kinda leaves a bad taste in the purchasers mouth to find out that they are not getting what they paid for.  That's like a free Netflix showing the shows you want to see and your paid subscription omits them."
geocaching,39x9hc,darkknight131313,4,Tue Jun 16 16:43:57 2015 UTC,Yes. It is more about feeling deceived than the actual dollar amount.
geocaching,39x9hc,henzeus,0,Tue Jun 16 17:01:49 2015 UTC,Sorry about that. That's not our goal. We should probably be better in our communications about what's going on.
geocaching,39x9hc,ScatterMyCaches,0,Tue Jun 16 18:28:49 2015 UTC,"I totally hear you. It's definitely not optimal—but it's also definitely not driven by greed. It's hard switching pricing models after one has been in place for so long. The transition period is weird, confusing and not great for everyone—including us. However, I think in the long run this is the right thing to do. It will be less confusing for everyone if there's just one upgrade path, rather than two.  Like I said though, as of right now, the full-featured app will continue to work as it does now. If you download it, you'll still have all the same functionality.   Again, sorry about all the confusion. We're working on improving our communications so that it's more clear."
geocaching,39x9hc,ScatterMyCaches,2,Tue Jun 16 18:26:27 2015 UTC,"Free App will get updates. Switching to subscription based pricing.  Those who paid for upgraded app, no new updates and support will be dropped.  Pretty clear. And not cool."
geocaching,39x9hc,darkknight131313,7,Tue Jun 16 18:35:48 2015 UTC,"Hello! I can probably answer most of your questions, but feel free to ask if I leave anything out.  So, the short answer: We're only really focusing on developing/updating the Intro app.  There are a few reasons for this:   Geocachers were asking to get full functionality with their Premium membership, rather than having to purchase something else. We thought that made sense. We wanted to include new features in the app (like Message Center) and it's somewhat difficult to update the paid app.   For right now, both apps together give you pretty much everything. In the future, the ""Intro"" app will be the ultimate geocaching toolbox on mobile."
geocaching,39x9hc,ScatterMyCaches,6,Mon Jun 15 19:54:56 2015 UTC,So it sounds like you are transitioning from the app being paid -> free and then only charging for premium.  What would happen to the paid app though? I would think that users who've bought the paid app (like me) would like those features rolled in and if not perhaps a free period of premium to transfer over to the free version. (I already subscribe to premium but feel that there should be a 'balance transfer for paying for the app')  EDIT: I've only just dl'd the free version and dang that map looks good!
geocaching,39x9hc,sjbennett85,3,Mon Jun 15 20:26:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know. That's the only bummer part of the whole thing. I think this is the right move in the long run, but for folks who just bought the app it may not be the greatest experience.   I don't want to say 100% what will happen, because I don't exactly know. Once we have full parity between the apps, we'll figure out the right thing to do."
geocaching,39x9hc,ScatterMyCaches,7,Mon Jun 15 21:11:34 2015 UTC,Maybe $10 off the cost of a premium membership/renewal for those who have purchased the paid app? Although I personally am not going to fret over $10 for a couple of years of enjoyment.
geocaching,39x9hc,slypig,4,Tue Jun 16 02:06:02 2015 UTC,"We're only really focusing on developing/updating the Intro app.   I am fine with this model and am understanding of it but I have a few questions.   Out of curiosity, what makes the paid app harder to update than the Intro app? Since you plan on transitioning to the free app with the premium subscription, is there a timetable in place to phase out the paid app from support any time soon? If/when the paid app is phased out will all of the features (like trackable support and and offline caching) from the paid app be transitioned to the free app?   I apologize if any of these questions seem redundant."
geocaching,39x9hc,ahaaracer,2,Mon Jun 15 23:02:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure since I'm not a developer, but I just think it's quite old, so building the new features into it is more difficult.  The paid app will continue to be supported for quite a while. I don't have a specific timeframe at this point, but it's not anytime soon.  Yep! We won't do anything until the free app is fully capable."
geocaching,39x9hc,ScatterMyCaches,5,Tue Jun 16 16:21:50 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for taking the time to answer several questions on this and being transparent.  I like some of the paid app features without being committed to a subscription. Here is my proposal:   Rebrand the Intro app and make it the only official app while keeping it free. Make paid app features missing from the Intro app an one-time in-app purchase option. Remove the paid app from the stores to avoid further confusion. Find a way to compensate those who have previously purchased the paid app (e.g. 3 free months of premium subscription)."
geocaching,39x9hc,ScatterMyCaches,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:32:02 2015 UTC,"Of course, that's what I'm here for!  I think those are all good ideas. When the time comes, there will be a lot of thought that goes into what we do and how it works—for us and for geocachers."
geocaching,39x9hc,MavEtJu,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:15:23 2015 UTC,"In the future, the ""Intro"" app will be the ultimate geocaching toolbox on mobile.    I would like Groundspeak to set the level to Geosphere and try to beat that."
geocaching,39x9hc,ScatterMyCaches,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:12:25 2015 UTC,"What about Geosphere do you like better than the current intro app? I'm genuinely curious, I've never used it before. The screenshots in the app store make it look a little outdated, plus the last real update was in 2013."
geocaching,39x9hc,stinger503,2,Mon Jun 15 21:18:37 2015 UTC,"A couple features Geosphere has that I enjoy:   Able to see Corrected Coordinates on the ""general map"" (anyone who's tried to do a Geo-Art on the Geocaching App should know that this is a godsend) Links in the logs are clickable. Coordinates posted in logs can be easily clicked to add a coordinate on the map."
geocaching,39x9hc,ScatterMyCaches,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:37:01 2015 UTC,"You can see the corrected coords on the map! Although, in the app, we call them ""Solved Coordinates"" since that makes a little more sense. Anyway, if you solve them on the website, they'll appear in the app as well. You can also solve them and enter them on the app.   Making coords in logs clickable is a good idea!"
geocaching,39x9hc,stinger503,2,Tue Jun 16 16:27:42 2015 UTC,"It's a little hard to explain, example:  This is how Geo-Art appears in the official app: http://i.imgur.com/TTiWg6q.jpg  You have to click each one to navigate to the final and hope that they're in correct order.   Here's that same Geo-Art in Geosphere: http://i.imgur.com/cdg59Pu.jpg  Very easy to see which one is coming up next and you could probably get close enough to the GZ without having to navigate away from this map. Makes the process a whole lot faster.  This doesn't only effect geo-art either, last month I had to scrap plans for a puzzle trail because of this exact problem. It also creeps up during regular caching days where I don't realize I've passed the final as the posted coordinates are no where near me and have to double back.   I'd say 99% of the time if there's a solution coordinate then the posted coordinate is usually useless. It would be nice to have the option to display the solution right on the map as the default."
geocaching,39x9hc,ScatterMyCaches,2,Tue Jun 16 17:16:26 2015 UTC,"Oh I see what you're saying. It would be kind of cool to have it be able to toggle that on or off. We have a few more major things to add before we start working of smaller features like that, but that's a good idea!"
geocaching,39x9hc,Hiienhurtta,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:17:42 2015 UTC,"What I'm really hoping for is that they make the intro app the only official one, remove that intro labelling and add in features for trackables and favourite points. It looks and works so much better.  I think the paid app is a lost case."
geocaching,39x9hc,noreasterner,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:16:57 2015 UTC,Is there a side-to-side list of features for Free vs. Full?   I found this link but it's a bit old (https://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=504) .. and not side-to-side :)
geocaching,39xr3o,rBeepen,5,Mon Jun 15 17:38:37 2015 UTC,"c:geo and Garmin etrex 10.  The smartphone is great for maps and ease of use, c:geo allows you to store caches in case you're out of range and is better than the Groundspeak app in so many ways. If you're using iPhone then Geosphere is the way to go.  Although the Garmin is cheap and basic, it still outperforms a smartphone when homing in on your target cache. Using a dedicated GPS is just so much more accurate, and because the Garmin has a Geocaching function, you still have access to logs,  hints and description as well as the coordinates. A more expensive model would be even better."

geocaching,39wiva,Huomenna,5,Mon Jun 15 11:13:57 2015 UTC,"Ok, this is is a game I can play.  I have braved the usual heights, scuba gear, extreme cold, water/swamps, 6-8 mile hikes, etc.  But none of those were my most extreme effort for a single cache (although many felt like it at the time!)  How about 1200 miles, $1350 dollars, 26 hours, 2.5 hours of mountain hiking, and a very real risk of a bear attack?  For ONE cache?  I was in Anchorage a couple years back and realized I could 'shoot down to Sika' to get the oldest cache in Alaska.  As you probably know, buying a ticket at the least minute is not the cheap way to do it, but whatcha gonna do?  Am I right?  Roughly $1000 later I am the owner of a spiffy round trip ticket to Sitka.  I even had the foresight to book a hotel for another $125 (pretty cheap for a remote island in Alaska during peak season).  Once I got there six hours late (two delays AND an unscheduled aircraft change) I realized I did not book a rental car.  Ever tried to get hold of a rental car on a small Alaskan island during peak season?  $200.  For 14 hours.  It doesn't matter - this is a mission!  Am I right?  So I get in my $$$ rental car and drive down to the trail head for this hike - I am so pumped!  Wait, what is that?  A big-ass sign saying closed?  The trail is closed because they are constructing a dam along the trail and they are BLASTING?  Well, hell's bells.  Time to drive back to town and figure out a plan B.    On the way, I see a construction worker and engage them in casual conversation. I used to work construction...it can be a crappy job, eh?...at least you don't have the heat of the deep south...No, we didn't have to worry about bear attacks, you got me there...Hey, with 20+ hours of daylight, how long do you guys work a day? 12 hour days, 8am-8pm you say? ...So everyone is gone by 8:30 or 9, huh?   Plan B has been formed!  I go into town, kill a few hours, and return to the trailhead around 9, confident there will be no blasting for a few hours.  I still have 5 hours of daylight, so that shouldn't be an issue either.  Grab my pack, some snacks, couple bottles of water, and a flashlight (never hurts to plan for the worst) and head for the trail. Things are coming together perfectly, am I right?  Get to the trail and there is yellow police tape across the trail.  'Must be for the construction' I say to myself, just as I notice a bright orange sign to one side. ""Caution: Bear activity area.  A bear was spotted in this area on _____.  Trail is closed until further notice"".  In the blank is scrawled today's date.  So, at this point I have two choices.  I can realize that this was not meant to be, go get a nice dinner and some beers, sleep in my shitty little un-airconditioned room for 4 hours, and fly back to the safety of Anchorage. Or, I can recognize that I will be hiking on a closed trail  (actually closed twice!) - so no other hikers - that has active bears, on an island with no cell phone signal,  and the nearest hospital is a 2 hour helicopter ride away.  In retrospect, it was a surprisingly easy choice, although I nearly lost my voice from all the singing...for those that don't know, it is supposed to help keep the bears away (or at least from being surprised and angered)."

It's a bluetooth gps receiver. Once paired, you can turn off data, gps, and wifi. The reception is greatly improved from the phone's gps, esp with tree cover. When i lost first one i immediately bought another.   Edit: Forgot to mention that the other nice things is that IF you got a new phone down the road, you can still use the GLO with it."

geocaching,39w5ho,Huomenna,2,Mon Jun 15 07:51:12 2015 UTC,I call it treasure hunting and explain the whole procedure to them. I think almost everyone in my family and group of friends know about it now lll
geocaching,39w5ho,iamvyvu,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:53:17 2015 UTC,"Take them for a walk and then go ""Oh look, according to this app there should be a geocache here""."
geocaching,39w5ho,MavEtJu,2,Mon Jun 15 09:53:36 2015 UTC,I just did this yesterday with a friend of mine. 10/10 would do again.
geocaching,39vvvj,sevend420,3,Mon Jun 15 05:46:05 2015 UTC,I figured it out in 30 seconds. Don't make it more difficult than it needs to be.
geocaching,39vvvj,danp01824,2,Mon Jun 15 20:56:08 2015 UTC,I can tell you that N 42° 42.526  W 89° 03.283 was Incorrect...
geocaching,39vvvj,MavEtJu,2,Mon Jun 15 05:53:24 2015 UTC,"Hrm, that would have been the obvious answer. Surprised it isn't correct.  Edit: Second obvious answer is obvious. Watch out for the owls."
geocaching,39vvvj,MisuVir,2,Mon Jun 15 05:58:38 2015 UTC,Got it right on the first try. Solution is in plain text. You just have to know where to loooooooook.
geocaching,39vvvj,tiikerikani,2,Mon Jun 15 06:15:00 2015 UTC,Got it right on the second try. I loooooked in the wrong place first time.  These sorts of puzzles are fairly standard. They're not puzzles so much as a hunt to find the hidden information. Here's a good solving guide: http://www.geocachingnsw.asn.au/index.php/geocaching/finding-a-geocache/134-tips-for-solving-puzzle-caches.html  P.S. Subreddit rules disallow puzzle-solving threads. Not sure if giving cryptic replies counts as helping. :D
geocaching,39vvvj,MisuVir,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:01:07 2015 UTC,Trying to figure this out for hours and just wanted to know if anyone has done a cache similar to this one. And maybe give the type of puzzle so my brain doesn't explode
geocaching,39vvvj,madeofmusic,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:48:19 2015 UTC,"Clever. Pretty simple if you know where to look, or having a background in web design."
geocaching,39vvvj,StuddedMohawk,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:03:28 2015 UTC,I figured it out in seconds.
geocaching,39vpis,Boghoss2,3,Mon Jun 15 04:39:56 2015 UTC,"I think they would have an advantage, but the casting directors would probably never put them on the show for that same reason.   There will need to be a new show created specifically for cachers-only. Race through multi's, solve puzzles, T5/D5 challenges, then just randomly make them eat something gross for effect."
geocaching,39vpis,madeofmusic,0,Mon Jun 15 22:07:21 2015 UTC,"While geocachers might do well at the puzzle type challenges and the ""needle in a haystack"" type challenges, a lot of the race challenges are physical and artistic tasks.  I've only encountered a few other cachers in the real world, and few of those have struck me as in any way suited for athletic or endurance based tasks."
geocaching,39vpis,kent_eh,2,Mon Jun 15 04:56:22 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm FAR from suited for athletic or endurance, but a lot of cachers from around here are people that do marathons, mud runs, or are former armed forces. They go out every weekend do 10+ mile hikes while caching. I only do their events."
geocaching,39runm,SpyKyle,21,Sun Jun 14 03:38:26 2015 UTC,Doing 100 in one day doesn't really sound that much fun to me. It sounds exhausting and painful. A big part of why I cache is to enjoy the outdoors and to really see new places. I wouldn't want geocaching to feel rushed.
geocaching,39runm,Sketchlynx,5,Sun Jun 14 04:12:45 2015 UTC,"My geocaching philosophy is much the same as yours. The most I've found in one day is 10 and that's because I wanted to see as much as I could in a renowned park during my time there - even then, that took 4 hours (which I have fond memories of!)"
geocaching,39runm,LafondaOnFire,5,Sun Jun 14 04:34:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my personal record is 19 in one day, but they were all along this one good-quality hiking trail in a nice state park and it took me 4 hours as well.   I usually go for quality over raw quantity. Like, if I had a choice between going to a nature preserve with 5 caches or driving along a long road with 50 roadside caches, I'd probably opt for the preserve because it would guarantee that I'd get to hike that day."
geocaching,39runm,Sketchlynx,3,Sun Jun 14 05:16:27 2015 UTC,"I've done it. It's a grind, and I'm not interested in repeating the feat."
geocaching,39runm,dakboy,6,Sun Jun 14 20:55:34 2015 UTC,Just to clarify...there is a challenge cache nearby where I live that requires you to find 100 in a day. That was the main motivation to doing it and I went with my friend and his dad. We were caching for 13 hours and it was a lot of fun and we really enjoyed it!
geocaching,39runm,richg0404,5,Sun Jun 14 18:04:51 2015 UTC,This is the one thing that matters. You had fun. That's what geocaching is all about for me.  But wanting it to be fun is also the reason that I could never see myself getting anywhere close to this many caches in a day. I think my max is maybe 10 in a day.
geocaching,39runm,tanjental,6,Sun Jun 14 21:01:55 2015 UTC,"Congrats, sounds like you had a very busy day.  Not something I could even remotely attempt in my area - no real power trails or anything like that.  Honestly I'm not even sure there are 100 unfound caches in a 50 mile radius of my house."
geocaching,39runm,LicencetoShill007,2,Sun Jun 14 03:51:14 2015 UTC,Plan a Saturday in another area (unless you live way out there)!
geocaching,39runm,ohsureyoudo,5,Sun Jun 14 04:05:47 2015 UTC,The worst part is logging all of them.
geocaching,39runm,electric_paganini,2,Sun Jun 14 16:05:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, trying to add something better than TFTC would be hard after awhile."
geocaching,39runm,bobisunreal,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:40:03 2015 UTC,I am starting with that now! I have some Jurassic Park music in the background to help pass the time. Probably will switch to some POTC music after 20-30 caches.
geocaching,39runm,centech,3,Sun Jun 14 21:12:35 2015 UTC,max i ever did in one day was 160. along the  Delaware canal. the four of us agreed that we probably never wanted to find that many in a day ever again. we cached  from  7 am to 11 pm  plus the 2.5 hours travel time each way lol
geocaching,39runm,realoldfatguy,3,Sun Jun 14 04:16:02 2015 UTC,Uhm... why? This just sounds grueling and not fun.
geocaching,39runm,realoldfatguy,2,Sun Jun 14 17:11:52 2015 UTC,"Did you find all of these caches by yourself or was it one of those ""team caching things""?  If you were there and signed all the logs yourself, then great job!!"
geocaching,39s0vi,Herd_o_turtles,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:53:42 2015 UTC,"When you log it as found, there is an area at the bottom where the TBs you currently posses can be selected from. See for example http://imgur.com/KzTIVhr"
geocaching,39q6h4,LicencetoShill007,12,Sat Jun 13 18:00:10 2015 UTC,"Assuming you are using the official geocaching.com app...well, not directly. But you can add a new waypoint.  When you're in navigation mode (after you hit the 'Navigate to Geocache' button), make sure you have the Map view and hit the little three-dots button in the top right-hand corner. There's an option there to 'Add Waypoint', which allows you to enter another set of coords."
geocaching,39q6h4,guybles,4,Sat Jun 13 18:28:04 2015 UTC,Thank you!  I've been struggling to do multis with the app because once I figure out the next place to go (coordinates) I never could figure out how to nav to the new spot.  I would use the web browser and that was often wrong.  You have just opened up lots of caches for me!
geocaching,39q6h4,dakotajh,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:56:21 2015 UTC,Perfect! Thanks so much!!
geocaching,39n60d,FroggiJoy87,2,Fri Jun 12 22:54:04 2015 UTC,"This cache which is found just off the 5 requires you to actually locate a fossil in order to log the find.  This one is a couple miles south of the 126, but trust me, you will never forget this LPC"
geocaching,39n60d,freeseasy,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:23:56 2015 UTC,"Those look so fun!  Can't wait to see what a 3D/1.5T LPC warrants in SoCal, and a lil' fossil would be the perfect souvenir :)  Thanks!"
geocaching,39jkhc,Curran919,30,Fri Jun 12 04:22:28 2015 UTC,"I think what OP is trying to say is: don't put pens/pencils in the logbook bag as they will poke holes in it. Instead, leave pens/pencils in the cache container itself. That way the undamaged bag remains waterproof."
geocaching,39jkhc,Rids85,-3,Fri Jun 12 13:45:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't know why people are having trouble understanding the problem presented in the picture.
geocaching,39jkhc,BriPerson,5,Sat Jun 13 17:58:34 2015 UTC,Found a smaller one like this recently. Caused the log to be fully water damaged and unsignable since we've had a lot of rain lately.
geocaching,39jkhc,JonesBee,3,Fri Jun 12 04:39:42 2015 UTC,"I saw a rockpaper log in a cache once, and I intend to use one on my own caches eventually. Amazing stuff, you can write on it even if it's wet."
geocaching,39jkhc,sarcasticalwit,13,Fri Jun 12 08:52:52 2015 UTC,Maybe a better PSA is that a Ziploc makes a pretty bad cache?
geocaching,39jkhc,ZodiacalLight,7,Fri Jun 12 05:09:00 2015 UTC,Hopefully the ziploc was inside a decent container.
geocaching,39jkhc,darkknight131313,-11,Fri Jun 12 05:16:18 2015 UTC,Of course it was in a container...
geocaching,39jkhc,pampurio,6,Fri Jun 12 10:55:59 2015 UTC,"Ok I'll be the one to say it. I'm confused about this post. I'm reading this as ""don't leave a pen or pencil in with your log book, if they didn't bring their own they will search the rest of the cache?""    I see pens and pencils all the time in caches. I guess this can happen but a proper waterproof container is really where this starts, not so much the ziploc bag. I see hundreds of caches with ziploc bags and thank god there is a pencil and sharpener in there cause i tend to lose mine ."
geocaching,39jkhc,Sketchlynx,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:06:11 2015 UTC,"I'm confused too, maybe OP is talking about caches made only with a ziplog bag?"
geocaching,39jkhc,takesthebiscuit,-19,Fri Jun 12 10:41:37 2015 UTC,"No container is water proof forever, especially with stupid cachers who cross thread a lid or use walking sticks to find a cache and Pike a hike in it. The plastic bag should be the last line of defense but in most cases is useless since pencils poke holes in the bag, or people close the container on the bag. Keep the pencils in the container, out of the ziplock bag."
geocaching,39jkhc,Sketchlynx,2,Fri Jun 12 11:00:13 2015 UTC,"I saw a bunch of pencil-pierced log bags this past week but none of them had wet logbooks, so idk."
