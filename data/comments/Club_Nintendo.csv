Club_Nintendo,3dncax,Soupbowler64,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:01:39 2015 UTC,Maybe so to try and prevent someone from having a bunch of different accounts registered to one household. Maybe they want to be able to send you freebies for being such a great member.   Maybe  they just never updated their system to handle digital rewards.

Club_Nintendo,3bq90x,TheDoctor_13,7,Wed Jul 1 07:21:08 2015 UTC,"As my flair says, I've been Platinum every year since '08. I was even a part of the proto-Club Nintendo when they gave away the Zelda Collector's Edition back in 2003 and the Phantom Hourglass feather stylus in 2007. It's been a long ride.  In my opinion, Club Nintendo never quite lived up to its potential in America. It always felt neglected compared to Japan, and even Europe at times. The rewards selection was lousy a lot of the time, the digital games selection lacked compelling titles about half the time, and the year-end rewards were downright lazy toward the end. Still though, I got some really cool memorabilia out of it and I'm happy it was around.   My personal highlights from the physical rewards include: life-sized Mario hat, Mario and co. statuette, Mario pin collection, Game and Watch Collection 1 and 2, Game and Watch Ball, ""History of Nintendo Handhelds"" cards, Golden Nunchuk, Zelda game card case 18, and the Majora's Mask puzzle.  I'm sad to see it go, but I'm also excited for what they have planned for the future. They've got to make something cool to compete with the perks of Xbox Gold and Playstation Plus."

Club_Nintendo,3borrx,BooferKing,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:38:17 2015 UTC,I spent over a 1000 coins right before they announced Club Nintendo shutting down. I got a several decent games but I would've rather saved my coins for the W101 or Kid Icarus.

Club_Nintendo,3boo9v,SPNarwhal,5,Tue Jun 30 22:15:04 2015 UTC,Nintendo specifically stated that the GC adapter only works with Smash. Doesn't work with VC or Mario Kart 8.   You can use the GC controller on the original Wii though.
Club_Nintendo,3boo9v,kenniky,-5,Tue Jun 30 22:46:16 2015 UTC,"Gamecube adapter also works on Brawl, though."
Club_Nintendo,3boo9v,outdatedboat,4,Tue Jun 30 23:28:03 2015 UTC,Not on the wii u it doesn't
Club_Nintendo,3boo9v,aidotato5,-4,Wed Jul 1 03:32:01 2015 UTC,Even on the OG Wii it doesn't.  It only works on the Project M Launcher and even then it only controls the Launcher menu and not the game.
Club_Nintendo,3boo9v,inatspong,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:53:03 2015 UTC,"I can tell you that simply by being an N64 game, it does work on the Wii. I don't know about on WiiU, but if I had to guess, I would say no. Running the Wii version on WiiU's Wii mode wouldn't work, though, regardless of compatibility."
Club_Nintendo,3boo9v,inatspong,0,Tue Jun 30 22:25:29 2015 UTC,"Running the Wii version on the Wii U wouldn't work? What do you mean?  The game itself won't work?  I can download the game to my Wii U by using the Wii menu. I just don't know if the GameCube adapter would work on the Wii U running a Wii Virtual Console game.  GameCube controllers definitely would work if I downloaded it to my normal Wii, though?"
Club_Nintendo,3boo9v,_Xaxa,4,Tue Jun 30 22:43:00 2015 UTC,You can run the game using Wii mode on your WiiU but the GameCube adapter will not work.

Club_Nintendo,3bnjuw,rebelalliance08,4,Tue Jun 30 17:55:20 2015 UTC,"I hope that if they do a program like Club Nintendo again, every region gets the same physical rewards. That Toad Treasure Hunter Lamp alone is better than all the physical rewards that were given to North America Club Nintendo members! Not to mention all of the Nintendo Club Japan rewards! I would much rather have a Donkey Kong beach towel than a 3DS game case..."
Club_Nintendo,3bnjuw,ZenChampion,3,Tue Jun 30 17:55:26 2015 UTC,"Sadly, this was my first year using Club Nintendo and now it's gone :(. I really enjoyed it though because I managed to reach Platinum and got a bunch of great items with my coins. I wish they had physical rewards for the elite gift but hopefully they can do that with the next program."
Club_Nintendo,3bnjuw,warmsunlight,2,Tue Jun 30 17:45:19 2015 UTC,"Even though it was my first year as well, I still had a great time, I even did a whole bunch of trades with people. It was pretty successful, but I still pinch myself for not getting Super Mario Land 2, time to get a ROM I guess..."
Club_Nintendo,3bnjuw,Pikasack,2,Tue Jun 30 17:50:14 2015 UTC,"I've been on it since 2012, it's hard to let it go... I'll miss it for sure.  Hopefully the new program will be as great as Club Nintendo."
Club_Nintendo,3bnjuw,FlyingBallWithWings,2,Tue Jun 30 17:54:58 2015 UTC,I was a member day one and for the most part been pretty bummed about the whole program. I rarely care for physical items and most of the games that were offered were ones I have or had no interest in. I did love getting Pikmin 3 for free due to the Mario Kart 8 deal.  I would rather the new system be stuff like that than us getting pencil cases. Or even just getting discounts or eshop credit after a certain amount spent would be really cool to me.
Club_Nintendo,3bnjuw,Shortpants,2,Tue Jun 30 18:55:09 2015 UTC,Late 2013 joiner here. Wished that they weren't shutting it down and just keeping it the same as it's been. It was great as it was.
Club_Nintendo,3bnjuw,IndiGamer,2,Tue Jun 30 19:34:04 2015 UTC,I thought the program was a very nice way to reward us for brand loyalty. Even though the rewards sometimes didn't satisfy people's desires I thought it was very fair. I think the issue with the dissatisfaction on some rewards is in part due to the fact that some people would buy games just for points. I liked to view the program as a way to thank those who were going to buy the games anyway... similar to how if you buy things in bulk sometimes you get a couple extra little ones free.
Club_Nintendo,3bnjuw,iamheadhancho,2,Tue Jun 30 19:42:12 2015 UTC,My final thought: I couldn't get to Platinum. xD Although I did get an exceptional game (3D Land)
Club_Nintendo,3bnjuw,kfs520,2,Tue Jun 30 23:02:46 2015 UTC,"I got lots of free games and cool stuff. I'm sad to see it go, but excited to see what comes next"

Club_Nintendo,3bnjuw,SaitoKojima,2,Tue Jun 30 23:17:42 2015 UTC,"Considering I'm more of ""if I had money to buy games-related stuff, I have money to save for the next game (buy or rent)"" mentality I really loved I could exchange the coins for some physical rewards. Oddly enough I'm not from the US so I have to pay shipment to home.  Still, I got some nice things: calendars and the colored Wii Remote strap set. Then I couldn't keep buying games and had a 3-4 year hiatus. This time the rewards were less physical (even though I got some like the forst smash poster set) but the digital games were enjoyable: NES Remix 1 and 2, Pikmin 3 and now I'm taking a blast from the past with Yoshi's Island.  If I were to compare with the European or Japanese changes the US version of Club Nintendo may have fallen short at times (or almost always, compared to the Japanese) but I still had fun and nice rewards with it.  And I'm still waiting the Smash Bros CD Soundtrack to arrive, so I'm not completely done with Club Nintendo yet.  Final Balance: once Gold, twice Platinum, 45 coins left."
Club_Nintendo,3bnjuw,Filraen,2,Wed Jul 1 01:08:12 2015 UTC,"Hopefully the successor program (for all regions) comes with the same rewards everywhere. Europe & Japan receive better digital rewards, while North America receives better physical rewards."

Club_Nintendo,3bpbp2,TheDoctor_13,2,Wed Jul 1 01:50:28 2015 UTC,"Wii mode isnt that much of a hassle for Mario Golf. As long as he would play it, I recommend it.  Links Awakening on 3ds if you are into Zelda. Lengthy, funny, nice difficulty, interesting story, and is just a ton of fun. Easily one of the best retro handheld games on the list.   Kid Icarus: Uprising. One of my favorite 3ds games now. Sakurai really did great with this series. Humorous, lengthy, intense difficulty, captivating story, and multiplayer make this one a must have for 3ds owners.   Mario 3D Land on 3ds. Definitely one of the better new Mario, save 3D World, makes it so good. Tons of levels, impressive graphics, creative level design, music, and the use of 3D makes this outstanding.  Super Metroid for Wii U. Critically acclaimed as the best in the series (never played it before, but plan on getting it, damn few coins short teasing me. hint hint) Known for its sense of adventure, extreme difficulty, epic boss fights and building your character to new heights, it is written down as a must have on the SNES.  Yoshis Island is a colorful game that is still fun to this day. Dont be mistaken for its crayon like art style, it will kick your ass. Think of any Kirby game. Difficulty spikes out of nowhere to keep you on your toes, unique artstyle, and beautiful soundtrack.  Zelda: ALTTP. This is my favorite Zelda game of all time. I speedrun it every once in a while. Tons of secrets, dungeons, items to help your quest, bosses, and exploration. Never understood the pink hair, but yeah. Best in the series IMO.  Smash Bros. Enough said. How much time and enjoyment I still get out of this is insane.   Super Mario World. Best 2d Mario game, next to SMB3. The cape is my favorite powerup to be in a Mario game because of its uniqueness and practicality. It also introduces one of my favorite characters in the series, Yoshi. Difficulty spikes, accessibility, secrets, and soundtrack still hold up to this day.  Golden Sun. A poorly recognized gem. If you like Earthbound, get this RPG. Fun characters, TONS of abilites, combinations, and customizations, funny dialogue, intense enemy fights, and a lengthy story. Terribly underrated.  Paper Mario. One of my favorite RPG series of all time, this one still stands out (anything is better than Sticker Star, im sorry for your loss on getting that.) This and TTYD, made my appreciation of RPGs grow. Art style, unforgettable partners, can be a bit tricky at times and is hilarious. If you played the M & L series, this has much more charm to it. (not saying that series is bad either, Superstar Saga is good, but PM all the way)  Super Mario 64. First full 3d Mario and it has tons of charm. Level design, challenges to find all 120 stars, and tight controls made this game age well. Just look at all of the nostalgia and reviews this gets. It earned it.  Finally, if your willing to drop coins, Wonderful 101. I wish it was advertised as much as Splatoon. Platinum Games, the people that made Bayonetta, made this so you know there is much to be expected. Unique gameplay, challenging requirements, and a bold soundtrack make this a must have for Wii U owners."
Club_Nintendo,3bpbp2,QThatOneGuy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:56:22 2015 UTC,"Alright thanks. I defiantly should of put which games I own, I already own KI:U, 3DLand.  I know about Golden sun, it is a great game from what I played, probably played more of it then earthbound, haha. We need a new Golden Sun and GS Rep in smash (maybe that will halp us get a new game.  I tried playing a bit of the older Metroid series, their good, but not something I would want to buy, if I have more coins I might. Same with ALTTP, I need to finish ALBW xD  How much is the discount on Wii U VC when you own the Wii version? Paper Mario, especially TTYD is amazing. I actually like Sticker Star a little bit, more than I did then Super Paper Mario anyways.  For coins, I might have to pick up W101, I tried the demo and didn't love it, but sure once I get used to the controls it's a very good game."
Club_Nintendo,3bpbp2,QThatOneGuy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:08:40 2015 UTC,You like SS? more than SPM? are you a masochist? anyway the discount makes the game about 2$ to play on the gamepad. (Is that a yes to W101 or...?)
Club_Nintendo,3bpbp2,QThatOneGuy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:13:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe. I just could not get into SPM at all, the design, the gameplay, the story. Sticker Star is basic yes in terms of story and dialogue, almost a little bit painful. But gameplay wise it seems more of a PM game.  Its a maybe-yes depending on coins."

Club_Nintendo,3batgz,iTookThis1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:13:34 2015 UTC,"Links Awakening on 3ds if you are into Zelda. Lengthy, funny, nice difficulty, interesting story, and is just a ton of fun. One of the best retro handheld games on the list. Im gonna recommend more Wii U games for you, since you have a ton of 3ds games:  Super Metroid for Wii U. Critically acclaimed as the best in the series (never played it before, but plan on getting it, damn few coins short teasing me.) Known for its sense of adventure, extreme difficulty, epic boss fights and building your character to new heights, it is a must have on the SNES.  Yoshis Island is a colorful game that is still fun to this day. Dont be mistaken for its crayon like art style, it will kick your ass. Think of any Kirby game. Difficulty spikes out of nowhere to keep you on  your toes, unique artstyle, and beautiful soundtrack.  Zelda: ALTTP. This is my favorite Zelda game of all time. I speedrun it every once in a while. Tons of secrets, dungeons, items to help your quest, bosses, and exploration. Never understood the pink hair, but yeah. Best in the series IMO.   Super Mario World. Best 2d Mario game, next to SMB3. The cape is my favorite powerup to be in a Mario game because of its uniqueness and practicality. It also introduces one of my favorite characters in the series, Yoshi. Difficulty spikes, accessibility, secrets, and soundtrack still hold up to this day.  Golden Sun. A poorly recognized gem. If you like Earthbound, get this RPG. Fun characters, TONS of abilites, combinations, and customizations, funny dialogue, intense enemy fights, and a lengthy story. Terribly underrated.  Paper Mario. One of my favorite RPG series of all time, this one still stands out (anything is better than Sticker Star, im sorry for your loss on getting that.) This and TTYD, made my appreciation of RPGs grow. Art style, unforgettable partners, can be a bit tricky at times and is hilarious. If you played the M & L series, this has much more charm to it. (not saying that series is bad either, Superstar Saga is good, but PM all the way)  Super Mario 64. First full 3d Mario and it has tons of charm. Level design, challenges to find all 120 stars, and tight controls made this game age well. Just look at all of the nostalgia and reviews this gets. It earned it.  Finally, if your willing to drop coins, Wonderful 101. I wish it was advertised as much as Splatoon. Platinum Games, the people that made Bayonetta, made this so you know there is much to be expected. Unique gameplay, challenging requirements, and a bold soundtrack make this a must have for Wii U owners."

Club_Nintendo,3akusv,RandomNerdGeek,4,Sun Jun 21 04:46:58 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm actually entering because I actually gave my old code to my brother and I'm actually leaving home to go to FSU for Animation and digital arts in the fall and the program doesn't actually start until I begin my sophomore year. So basically I won't have any access to animation which I have a huge passion for for quite a while. I don't have the best equipment to animate either. My computer is pretty old and its ram and cpu are pretty garbage. While flip note isn't Adobe flash or Blender it would be absolutely amazing to be able to animate on the go. I'd certainly take advantage of it and I just love animation so much."

Club_Nintendo,3aa9m3,Sparkastic,3,Thu Jun 18 13:48:51 2015 UTC,"By saying you've played/enjoyed those games, do you mean on the original console, or on the Wii U? It's worth considering to get them again if you had them on the original console.  Edit: Rereading your post, I'd say playing them on the Wii U is very enjoyable, for the very fact that you can play them whilst on the toilet."
Club_Nintendo,3aa9m3,SaveThePatrat,3,Thu Jun 18 14:06:31 2015 UTC,you can play them whilst on the toilet   +1
Club_Nintendo,3aa9m3,matsgd,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:27:07 2015 UTC,I played them all on their original consoles. I own copies for all of the ones I've played. Any thoughts on LTTP vs Yoshi's Island?
Club_Nintendo,3aa9m3,SaveThePatrat,2,Thu Jun 18 18:00:35 2015 UTC,"I don't particularly like Yoshi's Island- slightly weaker graphics and inferior sound. It's better to just go for the original SNES version. You have six more levels though.  LTTP, as always, is great.  TBH though, I'd consider just getting games that you have never played before. More likely than not, with a lot of CN games, you'll just play them once or twice, and ignore them afterwards. With a brand new game, you could at least add an extra few days of playtime."
Club_Nintendo,3aa9m3,SaveThePatrat,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:22:58 2015 UTC,"If I can upgrade Wii VC games to Wii U, can I use the Wii U gamepad for all games intead of using the Wii Classic controller?"
Club_Nintendo,3aa9m3,matsgd,2,Fri Jun 19 11:59:58 2015 UTC,"It depends on the game. You can use it as a display screen for all games IIRC, but as a controller, you'll need to check the individual game listing on the E-Shop."
Club_Nintendo,3aa9m3,danstu,2,Fri Jun 19 16:36:20 2015 UTC,"How many coins do you get per game in the US? You get 250 stars in Europe per game, buying Golden Sun would cost me freaking 3900 stars....  And VC is okay, they think about the controls etc before releasing it so everything should be fine. If you don't own any of the old consoles it's quite fun to play them on the Wii U. If you do own an old console just buy the physical copy :)  You might like Star Fox 64, but you'll need the Classic Controller for that (I'm not sure if you can use a pro controller...)"
Club_Nintendo,3aa9m3,farieniall,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:11:26 2015 UTC,"In US, it was ~50 coins per game, +/- 10 based on the pricepoint of the game."
Club_Nintendo,3aa9m3,N3rKo0,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:34:05 2015 UTC,ds games only gave like 10 coins each
Club_Nintendo,3aa9m3,Darkminno,2,Thu Jun 18 20:41:35 2015 UTC,"Playing on the VC on the Wii's downside is that most of the time, you have to use a Classic Controller. Otherwise, it has a load of good VC games, like Mario Kart 64, Mario Party, and Super Punchout!!  Super Punchout!! is fun and challenging, so you'll be playing for a while. You may even rage quit a few times. But it is all in good fun. Mario Kart 64, as said is fun if you just want to relax."

The two things that has changed are that new games after April won't have codes for stars and that you won't get stars for digital games. Old physical games will still have codes for stars.  To answer your question, they already started that more will becoming along the way."
Club_Nintendo,3a6hvp,Sanchoco3,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:49:56 2015 UTC,According to Nintendo's website you can't submit codes and earn coins anymore. At least here in Europe.
Club_Nintendo,3a6hvp,Regithiel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:20:13 2015 UTC,That's not true. You still can get stars from codes. https://www.nintendo.co.uk/News/2015/January/Important-information-about-the-discontinuation-of-Club-Nintendo-949921.html

Club_Nintendo,3a6pkq,RichieEB,4,Wed Jun 17 17:36:37 2015 UTC,"DSi can play Pokemon Black and White, Black and White 2, Heartgold and Soulsilver, Diamond and Pearl, and Platinum. (Platinum and Black and White 2 being the remakes of BW and Diamond and Pearl respectively) Heartgold and Soulsilver are remakes of Gold and Silver. These are the only games that can be played with your DSi. Your DSi is the equivalent of a Nintendo DS with some extra features.   A Nintendo 2DS is a cheaper version of the Nintendo 3DS, its basically the same console without the 3D features, and without the ability to close like a DS/GBA sp. The 2DS/3DS can play Pokemon X and Y and Pokemon Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby (Ruby and Sapphire remakes) With the 3DS, there are the options of: 2DS: Cheaper, but can't close and no 3D 3DS: regular small model 3DS with 3D XL: Bigger 3DS model that can close and has 3D New 3DS XL: Enhanced 3DS model, faster loading times, much better 3D, longer battery etc.  Not sure what you're talking about with a pokemon crash, as I've never had a DS crash on me like this. Any 3DS/2DS can also play DS games, although it does look ever so slightly more blurry, not a big deal to most people though. Hope this helps and doesn't come out as a giant wall of text on here! Oh and also you should post this at reddit pokemon or reddit Nintendo DS or reddit nintendo 3DS next time you have a question related to a ds/Pokemon"
Club_Nintendo,3a6pkq,Jonarobin,3,Wed Jun 17 17:47:35 2015 UTC,(Platinum and Black and White 2 being the remakes of BW and Diamond and Pearl respectively)   Respectively means separately or individually and in the order already mentioned. Your statement therefore says Black and White were remade into Platinum and that Diamond was remade into Black 2 and White 2.
Club_Nintendo,3a6pkq,kotoandjuri,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:40:31 2015 UTC,oh man you're right sorry Diamond and Pearl are remade into platinum and black and white was remade into black and white 2*
Club_Nintendo,3a6pkq,Jonarobin,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:56:41 2015 UTC,Thanks and I like reading so its fine!  Yeah its a Pokemon Platium for the DSI and yeah it just crashed as I was about to leave the house of my annoying mother. (As you all know how that feels if you played many pokemon series you just want to skip the intros) and basically it froze there sadly. I assumed maybe I needed some memory card or something but the game and console is in good condition so I don't see whats wrong ;/  I was going to post in pokemon but I guess now that I think of it would be best there but I'm slightly new to reddit and only popular one I found was a pokemon itself not a nintendo focused pokemon but maybe that is what the whole subreddit is about since idk any other pokemon on other game consoles.
Club_Nintendo,3a6pkq,Jonarobin,3,Wed Jun 17 17:54:55 2015 UTC,"DS's don't have memory cards. 3DS does come with an SD card though. If its not working, there must be something wrong with your DS or your game. Try googling. Hope it works out!"

At this point, I can't see why they would cancel your order since I was under the impression many items were manufactured based on demand.   It's possible it was canceled based on some violation on their TOS on your part, but they seem to be just deleting accounts for that instead of taking the time to cancel individual orders.  At the very least, talking to them will give you some answers, and if there is no way for you to get your pouch, you can confidently order something else."

Club_Nintendo,39jtob,Andrzej_Jay,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:11:55 2015 UTC,I never quite understood this argument about them wanting to get rid of stock. It costs them more money to ship these items as opposed to just throwing them away. I'm betting on the idea that it was Nintendo thinking that it was a good idea for a goodwill gesture more than anything else.

Club_Nintendo,39efdm,wajyi,3,Thu Jun 11 04:38:30 2015 UTC,"I've redeemed games from at least a dozen accounts, just by trading with other people. Don't worry about it, unless you think one of the accounts you're trading with may be compromised (for example, the dude in the comments below me, offering wayyyy too much for 3D Land, and look, he's a new account and even has ""legit"" in his name! What could go wrong?)    Kid Icarus: Uprising is a great game, part rail shooter and part third-person action game. It's pretty tough to find IRL so I think it's a great value.  3D Land is a great platformer, but if you've got a Wii U (I assume you do,) 3D World is miles better. I'd go for that one instead, unless you really want a handheld platforming experience.  Wonderful 101 is this crazy action/strategy game that kinda defies classification. Platinum has filled every inch of this game with something creative and interesting. It's also getting kinda difficult to find IRL, but it's only $30 on the eShop (compared to $45+ physical.) As rarer games go, KI:U trumps it ($35 eShop, $80+ physical.)  Ultimate NES Remix is a good deal. You can probably get it a little bit cheaper if you keep your eyes peeled over the next few months. It's nothing special, but a bit of good fun in very small bursts. I don't recommend the Wii U NES Remixes at all. It has a couple different games than the 3DS version, and those games (in particular Ice Climbers) suck. The 3DS version is a much better product. Not difficult to find IRL though.  Game & Wario is in my opinion a pretty decent WarioWare-ish game with some solid party game experiences. It's not at all like classic WarioWare, in that you have a limited number of deeper experiences rather than a huge number of very shallow experiences. However, playing those games earns you coins, which you can redeem for random prizes. Those random prizes include, among other things, microgames which you can play one at a time. Or, if you prefer classic WarioWare gameplay, playing all sorts of different microgames, there's the Gamer game, which allows you to play microgames with a twist: microgames on the gamepad, bedroom on the big-screen. Play the microgames on the gamepad while monitoring your bedroom on the big-screen to make sure you don't get caught playing video games after bedtime. It's an awesome experience (and you can even unlock another mode which allows you to play microgames without the bedroom aspect.)  IMO Game & Wario caught a lot of undeserved crap, basically for changing the formula. But it's got a lot of what made old WarioWare games great, and then some. Plus, you get Pictionary and competitive Fronk-launching, great for party gaming or playing with casuals. Not necessarily the best value available for your coins, but don't let anyone tell you it's a crappy game. There was a reason it originally sold for $40 rather than $60. Now it's only $30 on the eShop ($50+ physical.)"
Club_Nintendo,39efdm,scurvebeard,2,Thu Jun 11 13:53:39 2015 UTC,"I used my coins on Game and Wario, and I don't regret it. It's a good multiplayer. Gamer alone makes the game fun and gives it replay value. I recommend it, but i haven't played the others (W101, KI:U, etc.)."
Club_Nintendo,39efdm,jc8700,2,Thu Jun 11 20:16:45 2015 UTC,"As I said many times around this subreddit, my games were wiped out, even those I got from friend's accounts (which had nothing to do with Wii Minis) like SSB and MH4U demo. Same for my Wii U.  They can trace codes somehow and find out if you used multiple accounts. So far nothing happened to me again after the incident (I made more accounts again and redeemed more games), but you better watch out, do not link an account to your eshop and avoid using support until all CN services are terminated."

Club_Nintendo,3964iy,Slovakin,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:06:01 2015 UTC,I put my New 3ds XL in it comfortably.  It's about the same size as the blue/red pouches but plenty big enough to carry a 3DS XL (new or old.)
Club_Nintendo,3964iy,Slovakin,2,Wed Jun 10 00:35:46 2015 UTC,"I can't stop looking at mine every time I take my 3ds out of it. Is so great :') Mine fits perfectly in there too, I have the n3dsxl."

Club_Nintendo,3964iy,Romiress,2,Wed Jun 10 06:26:05 2015 UTC,"Backside is green with classic Zelda 1 sprites arranged in a triforce.  It's definitely a piece of art for fans of the original Zelda.  The bag is a bit more 'canvas'y than the original soft pouches, but it looks like the graphics are pretty permanent.    http://i.imgur.com/YoiDwp1.jpg  That's the front side, pretty much exactly how it looked in the CN description."
Club_Nintendo,3964iy,MikeMania,2,Tue Jun 9 15:09:00 2015 UTC,"Is it the same material/quality as old pouches, if you have them?"
Club_Nintendo,3964iy,JJBro1,2,Tue Jun 9 15:09:31 2015 UTC,"It's not.  It's a canvas type of pouch, a bit stiff compared to the old one.  I prefer the old pouch for feel but this feels a bit like 'dri-fit' material so it might have some water resistant properties (just speculation.)  It is 'dual layer' so there are two layers on each side of the pouch and the stitching is pretty nice on the inside.  It's a solid pouch.  Blown away at the graphics though."
Club_Nintendo,3964iy,koenn,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:16:52 2015 UTC,So the surface could be described as coarse? Is the inside a softer material?
Club_Nintendo,3964iy,kikilc,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:03:46 2015 UTC,"No it's definitely not coarse.  It's more like, a soft tent or something.  The inside is a bit softer.  Neither are soft compared to the original blue/red pouch."

Club_Nintendo,3964iy,luemasify,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:20:41 2015 UTC,"I do too but I have a feeling these will hold the graphics longer than if printed on the original material.

Club_Nintendo,382gbk,markhawker,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:25:56 2015 UTC,It does but it says expiring at the end of month and not the actual date so I'm wondering whether they expire at the month or after the date you redeemed them on
Club_Nintendo,382gbk,markhawker,2,Mon Jun 1 11:47:59 2015 UTC,"Well, it does say ""at the end of"" so I'm not sure how much sense it'd make for it not to be that. You could always just email them to check."
Club_Nintendo,382gbk,markhawker,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:05:08 2015 UTC,Thanks! Don't want to lose any stars before any of the good things come out!
Club_Nintendo,382gbk,markhawker,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:21:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm waiting too. I'm in the UK so have a few months left! I'd check to make sure with Nintendo but if they say the end of the month it'd be pretty annoying not to honour that and revoke them earlier."

Club_Nintendo,37x6lu,LionTurt,3,Sun May 31 03:37:23 2015 UTC,Super Metroid is quite often regarded as the best SNES game ever made. Get that yo! :D
Club_Nintendo,37x6lu,troymcklure,5,Sun May 31 04:27:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I've heard that Golden Sun has a good fanbase and a lot of people want him for Smash too. Will consider Metroid though!"
Club_Nintendo,37x6lu,troymcklure,1 point,Sun May 31 04:37:04 2015 UTC,Have you never played it??
Club_Nintendo,37x6lu,troymcklure,2,Sun May 31 05:07:07 2015 UTC,Nope! Never even played a game in the Metroid franchise either
Club_Nintendo,37x6lu,tetrisabbot,3,Sun May 31 06:21:38 2015 UTC,"Wow, that is seriously the game to start on then!"
Club_Nintendo,37x6lu,marche250,3,Sun May 31 12:19:08 2015 UTC,"The thing with Golden Sun (in my opinion) is that it is a great game only if you have never played an RPG; in my case (which I think is very similar to many others at the time), when I first played Golden Sun years ago, the only game I had played that was remotely similar to it was Pokemon.  Don't get me wrong: I remember Golden Sun fondly and it has a great story, but in terms of gameplay, it is very much a turn-based traditional JRPG. Who knows, maybe you'll like that, but keep that in mind when you make your decision. :)"
Club_Nintendo,37x6lu,Th0raxe_,2,Sun May 31 05:21:59 2015 UTC,"I personally would go with Golden Sun, it was my first choice  until I realized I don't have a Wii U"
Club_Nintendo,37x6lu,Th0raxe_,2,Sun May 31 03:47:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly, both are fantastic games and picking either you wont be let down.  Golden Sun is still one of my favorite RPGs and Super Metroid is my favorite ""metroidvania"" game. Basically comes down to, do you want an action adventure or RPG game?"
Club_Nintendo,37x6lu,best_in_slot,1 point,Sun May 31 14:20:44 2015 UTC,"RPGs are my favorite genre, but from the looks of the comments, people seem to favorite Super Metroid."
Club_Nintendo,37x6lu,Sporkinyoureye,3,Sun May 31 15:55:52 2015 UTC,"if RPGs are your favorite, then i would say Golden Sun.  But like i said you cant go wrong with either choice."
Club_Nintendo,37x6lu,SuperPacmanFever,1 point,Sun May 31 16:06:26 2015 UTC,Metroid hands down
Club_Nintendo,37x6lu,TheRealBowser,1 point,Sun May 31 14:17:57 2015 UTC,"Super Metroid is a classic. It was so influential that a whole sub-category of games, ""Metroidvania"" games, is named after it and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. I've played through it multiple times and it's always great. Buy this one, you'll be glad you did. Golden Sun is good. I like RPGs and I liked Golden Sun. IMHO, it's one of the best RPGs for GBA, but isn't an overall classic like Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VI, and Super Mario RPG. I played it through once and have never been interested in going back. That said, if you're looking for your next game after Super Metroid and want to try this out, it's pretty fun too."
Club_Nintendo,37tx0a,westmelon,2,Sat May 30 10:35:02 2015 UTC,The Animal Crossing Poker cards are surprisingly small.   Didn't expect the Nintendo Sound Collection CD + Booklet to be so nice looking!

When I was a kid I had a Super Mario Bros. jigsaw puzzle using the Japanese box art which I absolutely loved.

Club_Nintendo,375bp7,SuperC142,2,Tue May 26 15:24:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you can. I looked in the orders section, and all it says about my game case is that it shipped. No link to UPS/USPS to track it. Nintendo doesn't think a lot of things through.  My guess is it will be shipped sometime this week or next week."

Club_Nintendo,36wqwo,confusedcsguy,2,Fri May 22 19:25:04 2015 UTC,"Star Fox 64 3D is good, if you like rail shooters (which KI:U has plenty of.)  There's also Sakura Samurai, which is a pretty cool action game that somehow has a lot in common with Punch-Out. HarmoKnight is a good rhythm game, and NSMB2 is passable for anyone who enjoys 2D platformers (but it's not the amazing game a lot of people expect from Nintendo.)  You might also check out this subreddit's trading megathread if you're interested in trading some of your coins towards something else."

Club_Nintendo,36q8t8,bugbits,2,Thu May 21 13:27:27 2015 UTC,"Not always. They may have an exact number of how many they will make no matter what, or how many they can make with the materials they have left, and once they hit that limit they sell out. Not all the pouches might be constructed yet, though."

Club_Nintendo,36q8t8,Walluigi,1 point,Thu May 21 12:18:42 2015 UTC,Selling out is automatic. Removing the actual item from the listing requires someone to do it. West coast it's not even 8AM yet. :)

Club_Nintendo,36pte2,Pikasack,3,Thu May 21 06:09:39 2015 UTC,Maybe they use it and then post it publicly so it seems like they bought for them but not rly.
Club_Nintendo,36pte2,happymath,2,Thu May 21 23:31:13 2015 UTC,Seems like a pretty weird prank to me if you put it that way...

Club_Nintendo,36op3c,BLTspirit,3,Wed May 20 22:53:25 2015 UTC,because they want it to be a surprise for you! Obviously!(i'm joking)

Club_Nintendo,36op3c,Pikasack,1 point,Thu May 21 03:40:17 2015 UTC,What security reasons?

Club_Nintendo,36kx48,MrAdamXD,2,Wed May 20 05:48:46 2015 UTC,Gah. I just spent all my stars on the Majoras Mask night light. Would kill for one of those trophies or that Luigi's Mansion Diorama Figure.  Is there anyway to still get stars?
Club_Nintendo,36kx48,severedgoddesshand,2,Wed May 20 12:09:32 2015 UTC,Old physical games and eBay sellers who don't want to use the codes.
Club_Nintendo,36kx48,Brizven,2,Wed May 20 12:55:01 2015 UTC,But can you register many time the same game if you have multiple code of the same game?
Club_Nintendo,36kx48,ElucTheG33K,2,Wed May 20 15:50:19 2015 UTC,No
Club_Nintendo,36kx48,Brizven,2,Wed May 20 22:41:28 2015 UTC,Is there a list of games that give (still valid) stars? Maybe if there are some cheap DS or Wii games that have code it could be interesting to get them. But most main Nintendo games are in my collection so I've already most possible stars I guess.
Club_Nintendo,36kx48,ElucTheG33K,2,Thu May 21 05:46:23 2015 UTC,"For Club Nintendo AU codes, codes expire 5 years after initial release or 30 Sept 2015, whichever is closer.

Harmoknight excited me, but Fluidity: SC frustrated me often.  It wasn't a bad game, I just didn't play it very well.  Both have a lot of replayability.  If Fluidity: SC ""clicks"" with you, then I might suggest it as a way to relax and have fun.  But if you're looking for excitement, Harmoknight is the way to go."

Club_Nintendo,36555f,thriller007,3,Sat May 16 06:06:18 2015 UTC,"What Nintendo says is correct. However, once they send an item, they can't do anything about it. Basically, if you got banned, but received an email saying your item is being sent, then you will be getting an item.  If you received no email for your order and are banned, then you will not be getting anything."
Club_Nintendo,36555f,Sanchoco3,1 point,Sat May 16 07:46:35 2015 UTC,"I literally just got the Zelda Puzzle in the mail today, and my account was banned since March. I also got a email saying a different item has shipped that was on another account on a different email that was banned at the same time. So, i feel like the physical stuff is shipping even though accounts were banned"
Club_Nintendo,36555f,ncartwright15,1 point,Sun May 17 00:30:32 2015 UTC,whoo! i hope my ac cards get here soon!
Club_Nintendo,36555f,ncartwright15,2,Sun May 17 01:26:12 2015 UTC,"I hope you get them. I was shocked to see the puzzle in the mail, because i didn't order it until it went half off on my main account, which was only a couple days ago. So i went and checked all my other emails and i got 2 different notices and was stoked!"
Club_Nintendo,36555f,Dragonblazer87,-1,Sun May 17 01:40:08 2015 UTC,I have received my physical reward on both of my banned accounts. I'm guessing they had too much inventory and plan to get rid of it.
Club_Nintendo,3644qg,waynetid,7,Fri May 15 23:27:53 2015 UTC,Now maybe they'll start shipping them... :p
Club_Nintendo,3644qg,WillieMurderface,2,Sat May 16 01:33:25 2015 UTC,Guess those price reductions were to clear the stock or people just love good bargains or both!
Club_Nintendo,3644qg,Codename13,2,Sat May 16 05:02:44 2015 UTC,I already made a topic on this. Why doesn't mine show up?!
Club_Nintendo,3644qg,SinikableGiant18,2,Sat May 16 16:28:10 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I ordered another after the price drop. I gave my fourth Card Case 18 to my brother (who's borrowing my Fire Emblem: Awakening, Smash Bros. 3DS, Pokemon Black, Pokemon Black 2, and Zelda: A Link Between Worlds), so I'm in need of another case for some of my newer games."

Club_Nintendo,363i0t,vbatoonlink,2,Fri May 15 20:13:57 2015 UTC,"Yep, he is correct! Also if the game is available on the wii u shop you can pay a small fee, usually like $2, to get the wii u version of the game as well"
Club_Nintendo,363i0t,VanillaG6790,2,Fri May 15 20:37:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, first download it in Wii mode on the Wii u.

Club_Nintendo,362m5m,Orannis0,2,Fri May 15 17:20:33 2015 UTC,The bag is made of a light canvas like material.  It is strong enough to hold everyday items but should not be used for anything heavier.

Club_Nintendo,360o3c,omgsoftcats,2,Fri May 15 15:34:02 2015 UTC,"If it's the only one you ordered, then it's most likely that.  The only way to check was through your account and since that's not possible you can only assume now."
Club_Nintendo,360o3c,Sanchoco3,2,Fri May 15 04:05:09 2015 UTC,"Probably, enjoy it on CN's behalf"
Club_Nintendo,360o3c,saltykun,1 point,Fri May 15 05:29:29 2015 UTC,The same thing just happened to me and I can confirm that the order ID and shipping email order ID are the same.  Edit: The order just came in the mail. This means the deactivated account still got its order way after deactivation.
Club_Nintendo,360o3c,Dragonblazer87,0,Fri May 15 07:02:02 2015 UTC,Yeah mine got banned in April but on Monday this week I got a confirmation email about my messenger bag but it still hasn't arrived yet

Club_Nintendo,35zdg9,SinikableGiant18,3,Thu May 14 20:04:39 2015 UTC,"I doubt they'll restock it, as the whole point of the discount was probably to get rid of their leftovers."
Club_Nintendo,35zdg9,Gamer_Lag,-2,Thu May 14 22:14:23 2015 UTC,"Don't doubt this, but why are people claiming that Nintendo is reducing prices to get rid of excess stock? That just costs them money for shipping. It seems way easier to just give everything all away, or to bury them in a landfill.  But Kyoto companies being Kyoto companies..."
Club_Nintendo,35zdg9,SaveThePatrat,2,Fri May 15 02:02:26 2015 UTC,"Not yet removed from the reward page, so might be temporary... but I suspect it'll be gone from the reward page soon."

Club_Nintendo,35zdg9,bugbits,1 point,Thu May 14 20:22:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I suspect that the 'sold out' is done automatically by the system (when it has X orders accepted), but actually removing the listing is done by a person, which is why there's sometimes a delay."
Club_Nintendo,35zdg9,Romiress,1 point,Thu May 14 20:24:04 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't feel that bad about the price drops now since it was so temporary."

Club_Nintendo,360d0s,Spleenzorio,1 point,Fri May 15 02:21:06 2015 UTC,To avoid confusion I'd watch a video about it. IGN posted one not too long ago when the New 3DS came out
Club_Nintendo,35vrc1,riddlemina,3,Wed May 13 22:34:20 2015 UTC,Please tell me how you did this! I love it!
Club_Nintendo,35vrc1,Zephusa,5,Wed May 13 23:48:26 2015 UTC,"Materials:    *thick posterboard-ish paper (something like an old cereal box would be perfect) *glue/brush to apply *printer with color ink and printer paper *ruler/straight edge *scissors *varnish/brush to apply - foam brush works best (this part is optional, but I definitely recommend it) *sharpie for touch-ups        Directions:    *Cut your posterboard-ish material into 1 rectangle that is 7 3/4"" x 9 1/8"" and 1 rectangle that is 7 5/8"" x 9"".       *Using your ruler, make a mark 1 3/8"" on the brown side/blank side (depending on what you used) of all 4 sides of both rectangles.       *Use the ruler to make a crease on all 4 sides of both rectangles by lining up with the 1 3/8"" marks that you made.  If you don't care about marks being seen, use a pen or a pencil and press hard to make the crease.  If you don't want marks, use something like a paper clip or possibly your scissors if you're careful.  I used the back side of an X-acto blade.  Again, make sure you are doing this on the blank side of your posterboard - this is going to be the inside of your box.       *You should end up with 4 squares on the corners of both rectangles.  Cut 1 side of each square to make flaps that you can fold in.       *Fold along your creases and glue the flaps to the wall next to it, making a box shape.       *Print this image out and trim the sides so you have about a 1/4"" white border.       *Mix your glue with some water (about 1 part glue to 2 parts water) and brush a thin layer onto the top of the larger box.  I'd pre-crease your paper so it's easier to line up.  Put the paper face down and then put your lid on top of that.       *With the lid upside-down, press on the inside of the lid so it's smooth on top.       *Apply a thin layer of the glue mixture to one side of the lid and press the lid to the paper.  You basically do this on all sides, making sure to tuck in the corners before you glue them down.       *You'll end up with 1/4"" white paper that you need to tuck back and glue to the inside of the box.  Again, use the glue mixture so it's not too thick.       *If some on the white is showing on the sides, just use a Sharpie to cover it up.       *If you used a cereal box that has print on the bottom part of the box, you'll want to cover that too.  Do the same thing with a solid color of your choice (or really whatever you want to use) to the bottom puzzle box.       *Apply a couple coats of varnish over the paper.  The ink on the paper will try to resist the varnish, but if you constantly go over the area then eventually it will get tacky enough to stick - you can apply a second, smoother coat after this.  Do the varnish one panel at a time - don't try to do the entire lid at once.       *Allow it to dry and then you're done!          I know some of it can be kind of hard to visualize.  I'll try to do a better/easier guide to follow with pictures over the weekend if you want."
Club_Nintendo,35vrc1,theworstninja,2,Thu May 14 01:03:43 2015 UTC,A picture guide would be great!
Club_Nintendo,35vrc1,ZobmieRules,3,Thu May 14 01:32:00 2015 UTC,Okay.  :)  Give me a minute and I'll try to type out a quick guide-ish thing.
Club_Nintendo,35vrc1,bugbits,2,Thu May 14 00:24:48 2015 UTC,"I didn't really like the thought of storing my puzzle in a piece of paper, so I decided to try and make a box.  I'm pretty happy with how it turned out."

Club_Nintendo,35q824,pkenny72,1 point,Wed May 13 02:53:40 2015 UTC,"Cool cool. I've gotten stuff done at Michaels in the past, but yeah they can be a bit pricey. I'm definitely considering shopping around next time for better deals."
Club_Nintendo,35q824,saltykun,3,Wed May 13 03:04:52 2015 UTC,"This frame (it's recycled plastic and not wood, which I was fine with) and 2 mats cost me a little over $150 Canadian, which was over budget initially but still ""cheap"" in comparison. Other quotes ranged from $200 to $495!  I don't get how there's such a big variation in cost. :\"
Club_Nintendo,35q824,luigiman_7,1 point,Wed May 13 03:13:30 2015 UTC,That's awesome that you shelled out the money to get it done right. I have some art prints that I put in crappy frames and it just ruins the aesthetic of them :( Hopefully I can get it done professionally like you
Club_Nintendo,35q824,Shaner067,1 point,Wed May 13 20:33:01 2015 UTC,"Give it a shot, it's really worth it IMHO! :)  Like I mentioned though, make sure to shop around. Most will give a quick ballpark quote over the phone, then make your way in with the prints."

To be optimistic, it's very different talking to them over the phone vs. chat, so you may still want to give it a shot with customer service on the phone."
Club_Nintendo,35nzmr,Nickthegreat,2,Tue May 12 05:05:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I may give them a call tomorrow then.
Club_Nintendo,35nryx,Mokron,1 point,Tue May 12 00:37:42 2015 UTC,Have you traded coins/rewards? Done anything else that breaks the ToS?  Fastest way to find out would just be to call.
Club_Nintendo,35nryx,Romiress,1 point,Tue May 12 00:38:44 2015 UTC,When's the last time you were able to login?
Club_Nintendo,35nryx,bugbits,1 point,Tue May 12 00:52:27 2015 UTC,The last day Elite Status Gifts were offered.
Club_Nintendo,35md84,kikilc,1 point,Mon May 11 18:12:24 2015 UTC,"Fortunately, I already have the program lol. Someone probably already took it by now"
Club_Nintendo,35md84,Cybermccloud,1 point,Tue May 12 01:12:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I've been waiting three years."
Club_Nintendo,35md84,wbud100,1 point,Tue May 12 03:46:06 2015 UTC,This was quite a treat! Thanks for the code.
Club_Nintendo,35iv6n,joshbenko,21,Sun May 10 20:24:12 2015 UTC,This is the completed puzzle glowing in the dark. I regret not saving up my coins now.
Club_Nintendo,35iv6n,Puzzle_Master,2,Mon May 11 02:42:48 2015 UTC,"Nice! I just got off work, and that picture is better than anything I can capture on my phone. The puzzle is definitely hella cool"
Club_Nintendo,35iv6n,ItsAlkron,1 point,Mon May 11 07:02:37 2015 UTC,Holy crap....
Club_Nintendo,35iv6n,Mattchu12,1 point,Mon May 11 11:36:31 2015 UTC,Eerie. I like it!
Club_Nintendo,35iv6n,Haruon,10,Mon May 11 15:25:47 2015 UTC,I'm regretting so much right now picking the bag over the puzzle.
Club_Nintendo,35iv6n,bugbits,3,Mon May 11 01:29:36 2015 UTC,Whaa? The puzzle just got way cooler :)
Club_Nintendo,35iv6n,_LordLechuga_,2,Mon May 11 00:56:56 2015 UTC,Awesome! What time is it at your place?
Club_Nintendo,35iv6n,annachibo,1 point,Sun May 10 23:03:08 2015 UTC,That's really cool. I'm waiting for mine in the mail; it should come tomorrow. Looking forward to the picture!
Club_Nintendo,35iv6n,ItszBrian,1 point,Mon May 11 02:34:45 2015 UTC,"That looks awesome, thanks for making me regret not getting the puzzle."
Club_Nintendo,35iv6n,kikilc,1 point,Mon May 11 03:51:20 2015 UTC,Holy crap that is awesome. I'm really glad I got it now xD Its going to be awesome after framing it and what not.
Club_Nintendo,35iv6n,Zephusa,1 point,Mon May 11 18:17:21 2015 UTC,Can confirm!! it looks INCREDIBLE  So glad I chose this over the bag!
Club_Nintendo,35iv6n,Shizno759,1 point,Tue May 12 07:23:25 2015 UTC,"Ok, so if someone glued it together because they absolutely cant stand putting puzzles together, would that ruin the Glow in the Dark Effect?  If not then thats great, but if so, Ill deal with it. I hate putting puzzles together."
Club_Nintendo,35ncv9,zabimaru1000,6,Mon May 11 22:35:42 2015 UTC,Literally 0.   These are all the rewards and games that we are making available in conjunction with the discontinuation of Club Nintendo. Be sure to exchange your Coins for games or rewards before 6/30/2015! Quantity is limited on certain items.
Club_Nintendo,35ncv9,Romiress,1 point,Mon May 11 22:36:25 2015 UTC,"None, order while you can"
Club_Nintendo,35ncv9,Gorgeurbe,1 point,Mon May 11 22:48:44 2015 UTC,Nintendo hates america so..lol
Club_Nintendo,35j04y,jmets012,2,Sun May 10 21:08:18 2015 UTC,I haven't heard anything about it yet.
Club_Nintendo,35fe0h,ThorTheNintendoGuy,2,Sat May 9 20:39:25 2015 UTC,just ordered some puzzle glue so I can put this bad boy together and eventually hang it up
Club_Nintendo,35fe0h,ADAMTS_13,2,Sat May 9 21:33:08 2015 UTC,Cool
Club_Nintendo,35fe0h,bugbits,1 point,Sat May 9 21:40:10 2015 UTC,"Is that a specific glue, as opposed to just elmers?"
Club_Nintendo,35fe0h,ADAMTS_13,2,Sat May 9 23:15:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I am not going to glue mine I am just going to frame it without the glue."
Club_Nintendo,35fe0h,ADAMTS_13,1 point,Sat May 9 23:32:12 2015 UTC,Won't it fall apart unless you have a very snug frame?
Club_Nintendo,35fe0h,Ranma_11788,0,Sun May 10 01:17:03 2015 UTC,I am getting a snug frame.
Club_Nintendo,35fe0h,Mireo22,2,Sun May 10 01:19:40 2015 UTC,Yeah there's special glue you just spread over the completed puzzle. It dries transparent. It'll be my first time doing this with a puzzle but everything I've read online says it's easy.
Club_Nintendo,35fe0h,kazoodac,2,Sun May 10 01:18:14 2015 UTC,Kinda wish I had gone with the puzzle over the messenger bag. But oh well.  I did just get my issue of Nintendo Force #14 and it came with a Majora's Mask 3D poster with this image on one side.
Club_Nintendo,35fe0h,kazoodac,2,Sun May 10 01:40:09 2015 UTC,I haven't seen this posted anywhere yet so I apologize if it is already common knowledge but a cool feature of this puzzle is that it glows in the dark. Try it out if you haven't already.
Club_Nintendo,35fe0h,Mil_HouseMD,1 point,Sun May 10 14:21:09 2015 UTC,"I just finished the picture part, but the watercolor edges are killing me! Any tips?"
Club_Nintendo,35fe0h,M1st3rYuk,2,Sat May 9 22:20:02 2015 UTC,What do you mean?
Club_Nintendo,35fe0h,Codename13,1 point,Sat May 9 22:22:08 2015 UTC,"I'm just having trouble with the painted colors and dark areas. Putting together Link, Majora, and the children was much easier!"
Club_Nintendo,35fe0h,M1st3rYuk,3,Sat May 9 22:32:41 2015 UTC,"Keep trying, always do the end pieces first. Sort them by color if that helps."
Club_Nintendo,35fe0h,majingrim,1 point,Sat May 9 23:31:22 2015 UTC,Thanks for posting pics. I have seen these other posts about the puzzle without any pics and it bugged me for some reason.
Club_Nintendo,35fe0h,Codename13,2,Sat May 9 23:19:30 2015 UTC,No Problem
Club_Nintendo,35fe0h,omgsoftcats,1 point,Sat May 9 23:31:31 2015 UTC,"what are the exact dimensions? 10' width, 14.5 length as stated?"
Club_Nintendo,35fe0h,joshbenko,2,Sun May 10 00:07:12 2015 UTC,I think
Club_Nintendo,35iaiv,Kenky,2,Sun May 10 17:25:11 2015 UTC,"Bots don't comment, and since you posted the code in plain text, a bot took it the instant you posted it."
Club_Nintendo,35iaiv,Darkminno,3,Sun May 10 17:44:20 2015 UTC,I highly doubt a bot redeemed a wii code.
Club_Nintendo,35iaiv,1-800-948-8488,1 point,Sun May 10 18:08:11 2015 UTC,Okay.
Club_Nintendo,35iaiv,Darkminno,1 point,Sun May 10 18:33:48 2015 UTC,Well...
Club_Nintendo,35iaiv,KoopalingArmy,0,Sun May 10 17:52:59 2015 UTC,"There's a bit on this subreddit that redeems codes as soon as they are posted. Maybe next time say, ""the first person to comment will be messaged the code""."
Club_Nintendo,35cn2g,mag0man19,9,Sat May 9 00:50:57 2015 UTC,I was under the impression it would at least come in a box. Disappointing.
Club_Nintendo,35cn2g,ixianda,4,Sat May 9 06:09:00 2015 UTC,THAT is 300 pieces? Really? Certainly doesn't look like it...
Club_Nintendo,35cn2g,dearmusic,1 point,Sat May 9 07:46:41 2015 UTC,I am tempted to print out a box for it. Something like this but bigger: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:720860/#files  Probably will end up putting it together and framing it though.
Club_Nintendo,35cn2g,starfall8,1 point,Sat May 9 19:56:45 2015 UTC,"I want to frame it as well, but i don't know how to do it. Can you tell me how to?"
Club_Nintendo,35cn2g,starfall8,1 point,Sun May 10 16:23:39 2015 UTC,"I would go to a craft store buy Mod Podge Puzzle Saver and a foam brush like this: http://www.amazon.com/Podge-Ounce-Puzzle-Saver-Glue/dp/B00178MNRC  Follow the instructions, I think it will go on white at first but will dry clear. After it's dry it should be ready to frame!"
Club_Nintendo,35dwf4,phuc47,1 point,Sat May 9 11:26:22 2015 UTC,Do you have a japanese system...?
Club_Nintendo,35dwf4,Romiress,0,Sat May 9 15:01:35 2015 UTC,Yes of course therefore I ask some one about this game !
Club_Nintendo,35cggj,st1tchy,2,Fri May 8 23:48:30 2015 UTC,Cool. Can anybody recommend the frames they bought? I have like 12 that are still waiting for frames haha
Club_Nintendo,35cggj,SirAhNo,1 point,Fri May 8 23:55:49 2015 UTC,"Well, I personally want the small border (styleline) frames they have. Those are the only style that isn't on sale though. The next size up (trendsetter) is on sale though."
Club_Nintendo,35cggj,sicklyboy,1 point,Sat May 9 00:09:59 2015 UTC,Pics are up.
Club_Nintendo,35cggj,sicklyboy,1 point,Sat May 9 02:39:40 2015 UTC,Are these pre-built frames or custom made ones?
Club_Nintendo,35cggj,sicklyboy,1 point,Sat May 9 02:07:26 2015 UTC,Pre built. About to upload pictures of mine
Club_Nintendo,35cggj,lordpizzapop,1 point,Sat May 9 02:29:32 2015 UTC,"Those look similar to but probably a bit better quality than the ones I've been getting on the cheap from Christmas Tree Shops.  Still waiting for my club nintendo posters, they should be coming in soon though I think.  Just need to figure out where to hang them... I kind of forgot I was getting them and I am seriously running out of wall space."

Club_Nintendo,35cggj,ManaMoogle,1 point,Sat May 9 02:39:06 2015 UTC,Nice!!
Club_Nintendo,35cggj,scurvebeard,1 point,Sat May 9 07:15:07 2015 UTC,"22"" x 28"" is the size for the CN platinum rewards too right? (specifically, LMDM, KIU, and SS)"
Club_Nintendo,35cggj,rickman4L,1 point,Sat May 9 05:02:08 2015 UTC,I don't know for sure. I would imagine it would say on the reward page. It did for the Smash posters.
Club_Nintendo,35cggj,Demisanguine,1 point,Sat May 9 05:23:24 2015 UTC,"Are those the flimsy plastic things they look like? How thick is the backing? The cover looks pretty reflective - is it glass, plastic, what?"
Club_Nintendo,35dbdy,ThorTheNintendoGuy,2,Sat May 9 05:23:03 2015 UTC,"if you don't want to disassemble it then i suggest getting a backing board (some balsa or project and flip the puzzle, then glue the board to it, the you can't flip it then just transfer it and redo it upside down to make it easier"
Club_Nintendo,35dbdy,theflamelord,2,Sat May 9 05:27:01 2015 UTC,Frame it! I have  a few other Zelda  puzzles that I have framed. They look great.
Club_Nintendo,35dbdy,RollingThunderQ,2,Sat May 9 12:24:15 2015 UTC,turn off the lights!
Club_Nintendo,35dbdy,joshbenko,1 point,Sun May 10 20:25:31 2015 UTC,"Frame it, that is what I will do once it gets here."
Club_Nintendo,35dbdy,Oarfishing,-1,Sat May 9 18:30:14 2015 UTC,How its so flimsy?
Club_Nintendo,35dbdy,Oarfishing,-1,Sat May 9 18:32:40 2015 UTC,The pieces don't click together very good.
Club_Nintendo,35dbdy,9753157,1 point,Sat May 9 18:32:55 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'm not so sure. Once I get mine in the mail I will check it out and reply back."
Club_Nintendo,35dbdy,9753157,1 point,Sat May 9 18:37:03 2015 UTC,how bout you try taking a couple pictures of it so we can see what it looks like put together
Club_Nintendo,35dbdy,Nick51705,3,Sat May 9 19:57:12 2015 UTC,Done
Club_Nintendo,35bvb0,Sparkeagle,1 point,Fri May 8 20:39:52 2015 UTC,Cool. Looks like I got my confirmation too!

Club_Nintendo,35bvb0,Evadrepus,1 point,Sat May 9 14:50:30 2015 UTC,"I got mine some time ago.  Took it on a trip to Belgium for giggles.  It really is disappointingly cheap cloth, but oh so very neat.    Live it up when you get it!"
Club_Nintendo,35bvb0,Evadrepus,1 point,Mon May 11 19:43:33 2015 UTC,"Glad you like it, how long did you have to wait after shipping?"
Club_Nintendo,35bvb0,Evadrepus,1 point,Mon May 11 20:54:49 2015 UTC,I received the shipping notice (bought it in Feb I think?) and got it less than 2 days later.
