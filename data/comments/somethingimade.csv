Each hole, except for one.. is based on a 2' by 8' frame..   ripped from a 4x8 sheet of mdf.. typically covered in marine vinyl or outdoor fabric..  some holes use foam, others wood to change elevations.  I have brought the course to three different community celebrations.  Over 450 players so far..  from youngers to oldsters, everyone loves a hole in one.        purchased economy golf clubs and balls online from a miniature golf supply house.  The entire course fits in a 17ft uhaul truck.   Except for the train hole, it can all be set up in 90 minutes or so by one person.  Lots of fun!    (except for the unfortunate router incident...)"

somethingimade,3dzzzd,adonis8,2,Tue Jul 21 16:43:35 2015 UTC,because its common sense to turn off items that you dont need that are causing heat.
somethingimade,3dzzzd,jthing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:23 2015 UTC,"You're obviously another one.  Tell me about all that heat being generated by things that are turned off but plugged in.

I'm just flabbergasted at times by the baseless misconceptions so many people, and then they invoke ""common sense"" when they have absolutely none."
somethingimade,3dzzzd,adonis8,2,Tue Jul 21 17:31:54 2015 UTC,"Well, for starters, the original comment said nothing about the items being turned off and still plugged in. For second, I said to turn off items not being used. I understand that items turned off will not generate heat, which is why I said TO TURN THEM OFF and not unplug them!!! As stated below, items in standby mode will still draw significant heat."
somethingimade,3dzzzd,jthing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:27:47 2015 UTC,"A lot of devices still draw power while in their ""powered-off"" state. Some of these devices while in their stand-by mode still generate waste heat. In some cases, it's non-trivial amounts of heat.  Home theater equipment can do so, in some cases."
somethingimade,3dzzzd,swimnrow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:43:49 2015 UTC,"things that are turned off but plugged in   Standby mode isn't off.  And sorry, but those amounts are in fact trivial, negligible, and any other term of that ilk.  It may be measurable at the source, but it will have no discernible effect on the overall temperature in your house.   I used a Kill-O-Watt to measure the draw of some electronics in the powered off stated.  After 24 hours, the Kill-O-Watt still measured 0 watts.  That means that the item draws less than 1/10 of a watt a day when powered off.  Items that are plugged in but off (not in some ""stand-by"" mode) draw barely perceptible amounts of power and will have no effect on the temperature in your house.  These pettifogging objections to something so obvious are just irritating.  I'm done shouting to the deaf."
somethingimade,3dzzzd,adonis8,2,Tue Jul 21 18:05:01 2015 UTC,I leave my blender running throughout the day because I heard it uses more electricity to start it than keep it on. Is this causing a rise in temperature or am I okay?
somethingimade,3dzzzd,PaulAttacks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:53:45 2015 UTC,"I believe the constant spinning causes an inverse Coriolis effect, assuming a clockwise rotation in the Northern hemisphere.  This serves to draw in heat, concentrating it in the blender, thereby cooling the room.  You should be fine.  If it's still warm, run another blender."

Basically just get a styrofoam box, a few dryer ducts or PVC pipe like mine and any old fan you have. Fill the box with frozen water bottles, ice or ice packs. Put the fan and pvc on the box and trace them, then cut out the holes. I used a pocket knife and that worked fine. Put the fan in facing down and put the pipes or duct in their holes. The air will blow onto the ice and out of the holes! It isn't great but it's certainly better than nothing :)  I think mine might have been better if I had used just one big piece of PVC instead of a few little ones."

somethingimade,3dzzzd,illiller,6,Tue Jul 21 21:17:13 2015 UTC,I don't understand this at all. I'm guessing there's ice in there? Why do you need a styrofoam cooler with tubes coming out of it? Why not just put the ice in a big bowl in front of the fan and have it blow cool air at you? The fan would work much better to cool you rather than cool the room.  Not trying to be a dick here. Just don't understand the purpose of the apparatus.
somethingimade,3dzzzd,theycallmepa1,2,Tue Jul 21 06:45:28 2015 UTC,"the same reason you use a cooler for anything, shit stays frozen/cold much longer. You put ice in a bowl and set it on the counter when its hot it will melt in an hour or so, put it in a cooler and it will take many hours to melt."
somethingimade,3dzzzd,duckhunter,2,Tue Jul 21 13:06:04 2015 UTC,"The ice has a specific amount of energy that it can absorb from the room, first as it melts and warms up and again as it evaporates. The cooler just acts as an insulator, slowing the rate at which the heat can transfer from the room to the ice. But then you cut a bunch of holes in it and mechanically blow air through it and you're now speeding up that melting / evaporating process. Essentially the two act against each other, so why use either?  If you want to slow the transfer of heat from the environment to ice, use a cooler.   If you want to speed it up, blow air over it."

He is retired from the local electrical utility, and we make these lamps from meters that have been replaced with newer counterparts.   We generally use solid genuine mahogany, but we've also dabbled in domestic woods that we are able to cut and mill on our own (the unplaned boards generally need to be 1 & 3/4"" thick, boards thicker than 1"" rough tend to be more expensive and often a crapshoot) like Cherry (a favorite of most folks if stained), Walnut (another favorite), Red and White Oak, Maple, etc. My wood supply is now very full of Sipo, which is in the mahogany family, but much harder; and we've been making a fair number out of that wood presently."

somethingimade,3dq434,shaneguyman,6,Sat Jul 18 10:18:34 2015 UTC,"So the before condition of this floor was awful. My first walk through I was wondering why we weren't ripping it out and laying down new floors. The doorways and corners had been dipped out by the last edger man that worked the floor. The load bearing walls had caused the floor beside it to start sagging. Dents that looked like someone was tossing a bowling ball around the place. Paint and sheet rock putty layered the floor. I had all the things you don't want to see on a floor you're sanding all right on top of each other. We were asked to do a ""quick color change"" on the floor by the builder and our boss, but we don't listen well lol. We manage to remove every blemish, dent, dig, scratch, and gouge from the floor and apply stain with only 22 hours on the job. We ran a serious 36 grit rough paper to get the floor nice and flat and the layers of caked mess on top off completely. We followed this with a very quick 80 grit fine sand with a thinner shock pad than usual. Usually with fine sanding, you're trying to remove the previous more aggressive cut as it leaves very ugly and deep scratches around the edges. This time we only worried about lightening them up a bit. To save time we eliminated 2 steps of the process by adding 1. Instead of following the fine sand step with fine orbital hand sanding to remove any missed scratches and the drum mark along the walls, we ran an orbital buffer in place of it and the 100 grit screen rough buff. The orbital buffer is basically 6 orbital heads (hook and loop pads) attached to a buffer head mount. Running this with 80 grit fine papers done the job of removing scratches/swirls, removing the drum mark completely, and blended the floor better than any standard 100 screen rough buff. We finished the sanding up by running our usual 150 grit screen for a final buff and blend. The stain used is Minwax provincial and it'll receive 3 coats of Poloplaz semi gloss finish to seal it up.   I was honestly surprised at the final product since our time schedule and eliminating 2 steps had me thinking we were about to create an ugly floor, but man was I wrong. From a nightmare to a dream floor in 2 short days."

somethingimade,3dq434,Mr_Zero,3,Sat Jul 18 13:25:15 2015 UTC,"When the time comes to start painting, lay something over all the wood so the paint doesn't sprinkle on the floor.

I can get things like 14k or 18k gold or titanium nibs in many different sizes but that will run ~$400 with half upfront because some nibs are super expensive even though they are just a small piece of metal 1"" long by 1/4"" wide.

somethingimade,3dlqmo,sweetbeauty,3,Fri Jul 17 18:06:24 2015 UTC,I gotta disagree. If you look closely he/she did quite a bit. The fence was redone on the right/back and likely the left as it seems to have a new stain. They got rid of that crappy bush over the fence and got rid of those green wires. Extended and fixed the concrete all around the pool giving more walking space around it. Cleaned up the garden in the back. I think it looks great now.

We actually stayed in touch a good amount during the build and he came by and saw the finished product and said a prayer for safe travels before we left. It was one of the coolest parts getting to show him what we built because it truly was a dream of his to make one. His was going to just be for him and his wife and a traveling blacksmith shop in the back so our design unfortunately doesn't really work for him.

somethingimade,3d8q3o,rbb36,30,Tue Jul 14 11:22:37 2015 UTC,Looks well-designed and I think this is a great idea for educational settings (woodshop/demonstration classes) but I tend to think most woodworkers would not want an extra contraption on their table just to remind them not to get their fingers close to the blade (something they are already well aware of).  You might want to crosspost this to /r/woodworking to get some more feedback from your potential audience.
somethingimade,3d8q3o,nessgreen,20,Tue Jul 14 13:09:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Some of the long-time woodworkers I have talked to have said the same thing -- they already know where the blade is and not to stick their fingers in it. I suspect my target market will be, as you say, dominated by people who have started woodworking within the past few years. (although -- the average age for a table saw injury is 50-something)  On the other hand, I've been using table saws for a bit more than two decades without an accident, and I still like it -- but I am a bit obsessive about shop safety. I've always liked the red zero clearance insert on my saw, because it acts as a warning zone. My thought was to move that red danger marker onto the top of the material.  Still, though, totally agreed that there will be many for whom it is an unnecessary addition.  I love /r/woodworking. I don't want to post there at least until I have the Kickstarter up, and may not post there at all out of respect for their no self-promotion rule. I will probably talk to the forum moderators before I post.  Thanks for the feedback!  Edit: typo  Edit2: change ""/r/woodworking admins"" to ""moderators"""
somethingimade,3d8q3o,FozzTexx,17,Tue Jul 14 13:28:33 2015 UTC,"As a 3rd generation woodworker, I think this is a good idea. I am extremely paranoid and always fairly cautious around the blade, but I can say for sure I have had at least one close call where I was fiddling with rotating something on a crosscut sled and something like this would have definitely helped.  My biggest concern is what happens when something shiny or metal goes under the laser and reflects up into your eye? People might push through plastic or something with some hold downs on it. Also I would want to have a way to mount it to the ceiling so that it's always in the right place and I don't have to keep (re)moving it whenever I change my setup. My saw for the most part never moves, so it wouldn't need more than the occasional minor adjustment to keep the laser in the right place. Also it should turn itself on when the saw turns on, just like my dust collection does. If it was AC powered I could plug it into the same power strip that does that."
somethingimade,3d8q3o,VoxSenex,5,Tue Jul 14 15:11:38 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you should be running the R&D department, haha. The ceiling mount is definitely something I considered; my saw basically never moves either. I thought about the auto-switching as well, and AC power. I want to broaden the product line to include those things, but I'm on a shoestring bootstrap budget, so I feel like picking one design for starters is going to keep me afloat until I can afford to start adding more features and options.  The laser is 5 milliwatts, which is the limit for general availability consumer lasers in the US. It's the same as the lasers that project a cut line on miter saws and circular saws. The holographic optical element further splits the beam into weaker signals, and the dimmer takes the effective power over time even lower. What all that boils down to is that it should be safe even if -- by some unforseen accident -- you were to shine it straight into your eye for a minute or more.  Totally agreed it is a real concern, and one I should figure out how to allay. A person got blinded by a (much more powerful -- probably over 500 milliwatts) laser at Burning Man last year, so I have heard a lot of people talking about it. I spent a fair bit of time looking at the regulations on lasers, and the risks of both the power and the time of exposure. This device is very safe, and I need to be able to communicate that effectively.  Thanks for the feedback!"

But, what if I'm doing a 2 ft rip of a piece of ply or something larger? The times that I have the fence farther away from the blade are the times I'm most concerned about encountering the blade unexpectedly. Would it be able to accommodate this situation?"
somethingimade,3d8q3o,givemehellll,3,Tue Jul 14 12:16:38 2015 UTC,"No, probably not in its current form. There are super long arms on some saws that would work -- like the dust collector arm from Saw Stop -- but those need some kind of very strong connection to the saw to handle the long cantilever. When I'm doing a wide rip, or something vertical like cutting a tenon cheek I move it out of the way, which is why I added the Magswitch. The switchable magnet mount is another part of the issue; the Magswitch is super convenient for people who have a metal wing on the right, but most saws only have 20"" or so of metal to the right of the blade.  All that said, I am revising the design a bit to give it more reach. It currently has about 13 total inches, allowing a Biesemeyer style fence plus a 9"" rip. The revision should add another 5"" or so, but still not enough for ripping down the middle of sheet goods. The goal for now is to keep it cost efficient and let it work on most cabinet and large contractor saws, and for the most common rip cuts. I'll expand the product line once I get enough cashflow to stay afloat.  Thanks for the feedback!"

somethingimade,3d8q3o,wrongwayjay,14,Tue Jul 14 17:44:04 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, this is a well executed poor idea. I applaud your design work, but it is already very obvious where the blade is. I feel that this accessory is unnecessary. And, as someone else pointed out, it will be in the way a lot when trying to cut larger stock or working with accessories like a sled.   Maybe, others would see value here, but i don't. In other posts you have stated that your target audience will be new woodworkers and instructors. I recommend some more market research. At very least, find people in those groups and ask for their honest feedback. (If they see value in the idea, what they would pay for it, etc.)  Sorry to be a downer. I hope i'm wrong. good luck."
somethingimade,3d8q3o,RedGene,7,Tue Jul 14 14:27:54 2015 UTC,"Honest feedback is always appreciated, and I think your view is the biggest risk. All I can say in defense of the idea is that it works well for me, and that others who have been skeptical have changed their view after using it. Of course, I am sure it will not be the best saw accessory for every user.  As for it getting in the way, that actually plays into why the lateral arm is relatively short. I wanted to make sure you could flip off the magnet, pick it up, and set it aside without having it fall over -- then stick it back in place, align it, and turn the magnet back on with minimal hassle (takes a couple seconds). The moderate length of the arm combined with the density of the oak or maple base gives it enough ballast to stand without the magnet turned on when you set it aside, even if you bump it a bit.  In the end, though, your risk assessment is entirely valid and appreciated. Thanks!"
somethingimade,3d8q3o,TheSporkening,2,Tue Jul 14 14:41:04 2015 UTC,"I agree and disagree with you. It is unnecessary and in its current state probably not all that useful, however I would probably consider using it. I know where the thumb removal area is, and I respect it, however having one more visual cue isnt a bad idea. repetitive cuts, late nights, rushing, all things that can cause a biiiiiig mistake. the tablesaw has the least amount of safety guards and equipment, so why not use a laser as one last reminder.            as I posted above, if you could stick it to the wall, or ceiling, then it would be much better off, and be a automatic safety feature"
somethingimade,3d8q3o,RedGene,5,Wed Jul 15 02:57:52 2015 UTC,"This is a great idea, but executed (I think) in the wrong way. Being wood, and cantilevered, it looks like the laser could get misaligned easily, and mounting to the side of the table limits your cutting width, as others have noted.  I think this would make more sense as a metal plate attachment coming up along the plane of the blade, like the clear plastic guards that come on every table. Or maybe mount it to the fence, if you had a precise and easy way to set the arm length?  Either way, kudos to you for coming up with an idea and making something of it."
somethingimade,3d8q3o,captain_jim2,3,Tue Jul 14 13:51:34 2015 UTC,"The alignment is not precise and rigid enough to be, for example, a cut-line marker like on a miter saw (though I do want to get there for a future revision). While that is a limitation for some purposes, it works well for creating a warning zone.  I like the ideas of other ways to go at it, and there are limitations to each. Mounting on the fence would require a quick and easy lateral slide like you mention. Going up through the zero clearance insert like the plastic guards do would preclude non-through cuts (like plowing a dado). And the long wooden cantilever that I settled on exaggerates vibration and risks losing alignment.  Eventually I would like to add more options to the lineup -- assuming this version is successful. For now, though, I only have the budget to focus on one model and this style is my favorite balance of compromises and benefits.  Thanks for the feedback -- I will keep thinking about your ideas and do my best to come up with more and better designs over time."

somethingimade,3d8q3o,CatsAreTasty,3,Tue Jul 14 15:51:07 2015 UTC,"The first big difference is the price. Saw Stop saws are something like $500 - $1000 more than comparable saws from other manufacturers that do not have the reactive technology. Obviously that price is well worth it if it saves your finger, but whether it is worth it in your shop is a question of actuarial risk assessment and amortization of the cost of getting the feature into your shop.  But, I would never try to talk someone out of buying a Saw Stop if they think it is a good choice for them. Quite frankly, this device is not better than the Saw Stop for what the Saw Stop does -- it is incredibly cool and when it saves a finger it is spectacularly worth it. In that event, the question becomes whether the All Ten Guard is a worthwhile complementary good -- and I think it is. The benefit in that case is the reduction in likelihood of setting off your saw. That saves you the $100 for the replacement cartridge, $100 for a new blade, and the downtime while you wait for the cartridge.  There is also the Bosch Reaxx, which has a different mechanism that doesn't damage the blade, I think it is cheaper to replace, and it has two air cartridges in each unit, so you can flip it over and keep working (after you replace your soiled pants). But you're still paying a premium for the Reaxx.  And there may be other reasons why a person wouldn't want a Saw Stop. I have my reasons, which are valid for me, that I'm staying with my Steel City cabinet saw; but I would never run down the Saw Stop or the Reaxx. They're very cool, and anyone who feels they are the right choice should get one. And if that person also wants a visual aid to see where the blade is, they should get an All Ten Guard too.  I think there is plenty of room in the woodworking space for different solutions to the problem. And, being a bit of a safety nut, I'm happy to see all the products out there making my favorite hobby safer."
somethingimade,3d8q3o,michelework,3,Tue Jul 14 16:15:53 2015 UTC,"Well said. I had not heard of that Bosch solution. If you can keep the cost down I can see how your device would be beneficial with a reactive saw.  I don't understand why a go-to argument about the StopSaw is the downtime after an incident. If I had a production shop, and the coin for a StopSaw I'd have at least 2 extra blades and cartridges on hand at all times. Downtime is limited to how long it takes you to replace both."

somethingimade,3d8q3o,scrapbmxrider16,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:12:36 2015 UTC,Saw stop is amazing but you run into issues cutting things like wet wood or basically anything that conducts electricity. When the mechanism activates it costs approximately $100 to replace plus the cost of the blade. This system only cost the original price. If you could hang it from the ceiling then it would be a fantastic extra deturant! Great idea!

somethingimade,3d8q3o,vrbana,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:00:51 2015 UTC,"I'd say those ""eventually""s are in similar time frames. Honda just added the backup cameras as standard on 2016 models. Figure 3 or 4 years before backup cameras are standard on even the majority of new cars. People still buy used cars from the 90's. So... that's gonna be a while before aftermarket backup cameras don't make sense.  SawStop is gaining popularity but I don't personally know anyone that owns one yet. So I think there's quite a while before other blade safety tools are obsolete."

Having the zone marked out as a reminder not to ""go there"" is only one aspect (the one everyone seems to be focussing on). Having yours hands bathed in red light when in the danger zone is another thing altogether."
somethingimade,3d8q3o,BigSlowTarget,4,Tue Jul 14 20:07:46 2015 UTC,"That's a really good point. Thanks, I'll try to communicate that."
somethingimade,3d8q3o,theTreasonist,3,Tue Jul 14 20:21:20 2015 UTC,I wouldnt need to use it but someone might.  Is the base magnetic?
somethingimade,3d8q3o,misterschmoo,3,Tue Jul 14 15:04:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, the base has a switchable magnet -- the yellow thing with the black handle -- made by a company called ""Magswitch"". They make some other quick-adjust table saw gizmos like feather boards. When you turn the black handle it enables or disables the magnet (not electrical, it uses a magnetic shield or something) so it has 95 lbs pull when on and negligible to zero pull when you flip it off. Makes it really easy to move around."
somethingimade,3d8q3o,misterschmoo,2,Tue Jul 14 15:15:27 2015 UTC,"very cool, I see the price for those magnets is not cheap. Would that make your laser gizmo cost over $100?"
somethingimade,3d8q3o,misterschmoo,2,Tue Jul 14 15:32:14 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately it does make it a bit expensive to make them in small numbers. I'm going to have to get the volume up to get the best pricing from Magswitch (who have been really nice to work with). Right now I can sell them for about $80 and make enough to keep going. As I ramp up, I'll eventually get to injection molding, which will let me really get the price down and start to get into retail stores. When that happens I'll be able to move enough units to start to have a real impact on the number of injuries, I hope."

somethingimade,3dacd5,RacerX3888,2,Wed Jul 15 01:33:30 2015 UTC,It does!
somethingimade,3dacd5,Baelorn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:18:14 2015 UTC,That's very well done. As a huge Jurassic Park fan myself I'm sure she'll love it.

somethingimade,3dfqzb,themayker,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:53:59 2015 UTC,"This didn't cost me anything. I used scrap and spare hardware from work. I just used bits of the angle iron for the base mounts. Bolted them on with a larger nut and washer to space them from the body. Then I had some bent steel brackets I cut and bolted to the bases. With some fit and refit I would take them off and bend some more until the bits looked level and facing each other across. Finally laid the angle iron across, measure for how wide I wanted and drilled and bolted them to the angled bits.  They're sturdy as shit lol. Since then I've added rubber spacers larger than the feet of my bases to help absorb wind vibrations, help protect paint and absorb and forward or rearward flex.  The parts on the actual car are cut from my cross bars. I had 2, 8 ft pieces of angle iron from old bolt together metal shelving and the steel brackets went to tractor trailer hub meters that we had extras of."
