Dixie,3e3c7r,CustosClavium,11,Tue Jul 21 17:14:45 2015 UTC,Good rednecks and bad rednecks exist.
Dixie,3e3c7r,SouthernCrossfire,3,Tue Jul 21 17:15:30 2015 UTC,I call the bad rednecks the white trash.
Dixie,3e3c7r,bamahoon,4,Wed Jul 22 04:20:15 2015 UTC,"This might get some negative remarks, but I was raised to consider the term ""redneck"" to be reserved for ""dumb, ignorant, uneducated, close-minded, white trash, billigerent"" folks, as you eluded to.    I understand ""redneck pride"" but anyone that doesn't consider themselves a redneck will almost inevitably look down on those who do.    Jeff Foxworthy and crew might have brought some degree of acceptability to the term, but I think what he really did was skew the line between the traditional definition of a redneck and good country folk, who have gravitated to the sub-culture as a means of self-identification.    That being said, if you like the shirt, wear it! Don't listen to what others say."
Dixie,3e3c7r,NotJohnDenver,3,Tue Jul 21 20:22:08 2015 UTC,"Just like the battle flag, I believe the term redneck can have multiple interpretations; however, I would argue that the term has not evolved to be more inclusive. Historically speaking, the term was applied to just about any blue collar worker. It became offensive in the 70s, and I believe the term used today is less inclusive than historically.  Up here in the Midwest, people claiming to be rednecks are generally city born teens who drive their daddy's truck around. They're loud and confrontational. They sit in parking lots and listen to shitty country music while throwing insults at anyone who drives by. They do not treat minorities well. Most feel the need to brag about their status. They try to act Southern, but it just comes off as some poorly appropriated charactercher.   It was different in the South. Instead of being the norm, the loud and belligerent rednecks were the exception. There was a lot less need to label oneself as a redneck. It was not a point of pride, it was just a thing. Those in the South generally had far more respect for others. Still, most southern folks I know would not want to be labeled as rednecks. They do not like the negative connotations, besides redneck is a title for young males generally. The title does not fit well  to everyone. Many think rednecks nationwide are devaluing historic Southern culture.    It is much more elegant to think of oneself as a ""Southerner"" or simply as ""country folk"". I think those labels encompass more of the positive values of Southern life anyways.   Those are the labels I use when people ask about my background. I drove a lifted truck, listen to bluegrass, smoked a corncob pipe, spent most of my time in the mountains, volunteered with the local fire department, and lived quietly. I would never consider myself a redneck, even though I was part of the same world. I feel it might devalue my way of life to others."

Dixie,3e3c7r,L8sho,2,Tue Jul 21 21:25:07 2015 UTC,Your dad seems to be confusing redneck with white trash. Some of the wealthiest and most educated people that I know are rednecks.
Dixie,3e3c7r,blsmothermon,2,Tue Jul 21 20:41:59 2015 UTC,"Generally, in my neck of the woods, those who self-identify as ""rednecks"" are just loud, ignorant, obnoxious white trash. I was born and raised in the country, lived and worked outside my whole life, can live off the land enough to support a family if I had to, support the Confederate flag, history, and heritage 100%, but I would never identify as redneck and would be reluctant to associate with those who do."
Dixie,3e3c7r,L8sho,5,Tue Jul 21 21:11:06 2015 UTC,"I self-identify as redneck, yet you might not see me as one (by your definition).   I have multiple degrees, an impressive household income, live two blocks from a country club, enjoy reading, cooking, quality wine, classical music and jazz. I attend local symphony events, theater, etc. I also work for one of my state's largest professional firms.  On the other hand, I am most comfortable in old, ratty clothes, either at my river camp (which is a mobile home, effectively in a waterfront trailer park), or at my hunting camp in the middle of nowhere. I suck the heads of crawfish, drink moonshine, ride around in lifted trucks and ATVs, jugfish for catfish, etc. I can also recite all the words of most every Hank Williams song, Jr. or Sr., ever written (even though I don't really listen to such on my own very often) .   I also drive a 12 year old, piece of shit pickup, even though I can afford most anything that I want.   I also do support the Confederate flag, even though I don't own one.  Once again, in my neck of the woods, rednecks are rednecks and white trash is white trash.   If decent, upwardly mobile rednecks weren't a thing, $75K pickup trucks and bass boats wouldn't exist."

There are rednecks with class and money, but those people aren't typically interested in things like symphonies and theater.   For what it's worth, I don't think redneck is the go-to insult for the worst kind of southerners like OP's father makes it out to be. I'd use hick or white trash for that."

Dixie,3e3c7r,TeaPartySilverbug,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:36:45 2015 UTC,"IIRC, ""rednecks"" were originally Confederate soldiers in West Virginia who wore red bandannas around their necks so they wouldn't be confused for yankees. They were looked down upon within the Confederate Army because they were poor, uneducated, and predominately Irish immigrants. After the War on Northern Aggression, most of them became coal miners and continued to wear their red bandannas so they could be easily seen in the mines by their coworkers. This is why the term came to mean a blue collar worker."
Dixie,3e09r4,CustosClavium,6,Mon Jul 20 23:31:54 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Black NAACP member is pro-Confederacy and attended a rally to save a monument in Mississippi. Woman claims that the vehicle she was in was being chased by another vehicle full of blacks who were also at the rally - where she burned her NAACP card - and that the vehicle tried (and succeded) to run them off the road, causing the fatal wreck."
Dixie,3e09r4,Juteshire,3,Mon Jul 20 23:33:52 2015 UTC,"Who in their right mind could possibly think it's right to chase down a car full of peaceful, respectable people for expressing pride in the place they've lived their whole lives and their ancestors probably lived in for generations before them? The people in that silver car are murderers, plain and simple, motivated by an insane and obsessive ideology of hate. Once upon a time, racist groups like the Klan lynched black people for contrived offenses; today, racist groups are encouraging black people to kill each other instead, just to stir up racial hatred and tear apart the South. It's disgusting.  The man who died in the car crash is the most recent in a long line of people who shouldn't have had to die, but did so for the honor and dignity of their native South. It's sad, but I can only imagine it will continue as long as outsiders keep trying to divide the people of the South for their own political benefit."

Dixie,3dvz5w,SouthernCrossfire,3,Mon Jul 20 18:43:20 2015 UTC,"Hard to say. Most folks I know think the proposals are ridiculous and that the agitators need to find some other target.   We have 10 million in GA, 6 million in metro-Atlanta. While it does seem that Atlantans in generally are more open to the idea of removing Confederate symbolism from state (and to some extent private as well) ground, few have openly expressed (to me) any desire to change the mountain. That being said, it's not a Confederate paradise outside of Atlanta. To this day, most people do not care either way, but those who have strong feelings either way are increasingly becoming more vocal about their position.  Where I live, there have been calls to remove the local memorial to the Confederate dead, but that's mostly naive college kids from metro-Atlanta who go to school here. The college has an active Black Lives Matter group who do themselves few favors in getting converts, but surprisingly (to me) is that the majority of those most vocally opposed to Confederate symbolism, from Stone Mountain to private displays of Confederate flags, are not the blacks living near Stone Mountain (an almost entirely black city now) but rather white, metro-Atlantan college kids, many of whom, for various reasons, consider themselves to be anything but Southern."
Dixie,3dvz5w,wwstevens,4,Mon Jul 20 03:58:43 2015 UTC,That's generally the pattern. Most blacks here generally don't give a fuck.

If anything, destroying all of it is deceptive, because refusing to face our history is dishonest to our children- we're not teaching them the truth of what happened."

Where is the moral line after which, once crossed, historical figures are eligible for reverence again? George Washington was a slave-owning Rebel from Virginia, is he somehow less abhorrent than a Rebel Virginian who freed his slaves and fought the Union like Robert E Lee? The only difference between the two men (apart from one freeing his slaves) is about 80 years between the Revolution and the Civil War! You know what was happening 80 years ago?

Dixie,3d2s7u,officerbill_,6,Wed Jul 15 05:29:02 2015 UTC,"I have mixed feelings g about others flying the flag. I lived in rural Indiana and you had high schoolers in pickup trucks flying Rebel flags. I think a lot of it has to do with the ""country boy"" image a lot of rural American easily identifies with. Rural American and the South are very similar, yet only the South has a distance culture. Rural Americans elsewhere just want to identify with something, and hell, its close enough.   Still, many are related to Southerners, or members of their family are, so they latch onto it. I'm in Arizona at the moment, and there's a debate going on now against ying the First National during a celebration of Tucson's 240 years of existence. It generally is, because Southern Arizona was occupied by Confederate troops for short time.  Tucson shares Confederate history. Now, are the people around here flying Rebel flags celebrating that history? Do they have a family connection with Confederate troops? I dunno. I have seen many old ghost town cemeteries where many of the dead were Union or Confederate soldiers who moved west after the War, so it is plausible that local families are honoring the memory of their ancestors.   Generally speaking, I am sure a lot of it is just ""I like country music and Mossy Oak, I need me a Rebel flag!"" or people trying to be badass controversial. When I see it flying outside of the south, I just presume this is why."

I'm always amused by this kind of outlandish ""alternate history"", ridiculous as it is.  On the other hand, even though it's clearly parody, it is kind of intended to make Southerners look like monsters who would never have changed if not forced to by Northerners.

Dixie,3cte3t,Magnoliid,7,Fri Jul 10 16:56:22 2015 UTC,"The flag is without a doubt an important part of our heritage. The South is complex, like the author says; and the fact that the flag is so complex makes it the perfect symbol of the South. It remind us of the flawed ideology that many of our ancestors fought for, but it also reminds us to maintain pride in our homeland and our people, and it ties us to our past. That past contains atrocious mistakes, yes, but it also contains beautiful, uplifting memories. The flag represents that.  This line of argument against the flag - that because it's used by the Ku Klux Klan and Dylann Roof, respectable Southerners shouldn't use it - is patently ridiculous. Countless atrocities have been committed by people who have pledged their allegiance to every flag flying today or ever. We can't blame the flags for that.  If our flag once represented the Confederacy, today it represents much more than that. We don't take pride in every aspect of our history, but we look our historical demons in the eye and take pride in what we have accomplished despite them, and we try to move forward. That's more than most people can say, and I'm proud of that."

It doesn't make one difference if one still exists or not, the one existing is still committing outrageous offenses (all nations do at some point, not trying to spin an anti-american sentiment). People aren't made at the Confederate Flag because its not a Country, but for what it stands for to them. Our flags have all flown over some horrible actions."
Dixie,3cte3t,CustosClavium,2,Sat Jul 11 03:33:57 2015 UTC,"You can argue that, but in the end it represents a country that still exists and has a long history.  The confederacy has a short history of killing american soldiers.  It's just not the same."

Do you just give up on something because a minority, the KKK and their kind, have hijacked it? No. You take that shit back. You recognize the wrong done with it, you recognize the wrong done by your ancestors, bit you celebrate everything else they did right and make that your inspiration. Learn from their mistakes but hold on to their wisdom. Bring about change, yes, but not transformation. We are the South. We always will be. Nothing can make us anything but Southerners, but it can mean a lot to be a Southerner these days and we want it all. So make room for it, but don't throw out all the old stuff, just redefine it for better."

Removing the flag from the capitol signals better relations and greater understanding, and I think a lot of people are immensely proud of the region right now. The new South will have new symbols that unite rather than divide."
Dixie,3ct0xm,Magnoliid,3,Fri Jul 10 16:52:14 2015 UTC,woosh  This is our only symbol. And they're trying to take it from the graves of the dead and they're trying to relocate some of those graves. Disrespecting the dead is the lowest move possible.

Dixie,3ct0xm,TheColorOfStupid,8,Sat Jul 11 03:06:50 2015 UTC,"I left out slavery for a reason. The men who picked up their guns and went to war did not own slaves. The politicians, the men who started the war, owned slaves. All wars are declared by the politicians and fought by the common man. Slavery did not become an issue in the war until January 1st, 1863. A little studying up would do you good."
Dixie,3ct0xm,Vulamond,2,Sat Jul 11 04:00:10 2015 UTC,"Slavery did not become an issue in the war   Then why did all the southern states specifically say it was about slavery and white dominance of blacks from the beginning?     And a third of southerners owned slaves, and those that didn't still benefited from the overall economy.    It's you who need to do a little studying."
Dixie,3ct0xm,TheColorOfStupid,3,Sat Jul 11 04:03:17 2015 UTC,"Slavery was a huge part of the economy. Stating statistical facts is really just not relevant here. In the Civil War, the war goal of the United States was not to liberate the slaves. In fact, the Union passed laws against doing so. At most, Union soldiers could confiscate slaves to work Union camps. The war goal was to reunite the South with the Union. This is why Great Britain was intervening on behalf of the Confederacy. In 1863, however, slavery became an issue in the Civil War. With this change, Great Britain backed out of the newly-announced moral war the Union was fighting. You could almost consider it a crusade, if not for the fact that Union soldiers mostly resented the idea.   The initial reason for secession was states' rights. 20 years before the start of this inevitable Civil War was the issue of nullification, which nearly started the war early. States' rights did indeed include slavery, but it is simply misleading to say that slavery was the cause of the war."
Dixie,3ct0xm,Vulamond,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:17:06 2015 UTC,"In the Civil War, the war goal of the United States was not to liberate the slaves.   In the beginning, but it's undeniable that the war goal of the South was to preserve slavery, because they all specifically said that was the reason for secession.   And states rights definitely was not the issue.  States in the confederacy had less rights than in the union.   The war was about slavery, everyone at the time understood it was about slavery and they all specifically said it was about slavery.    The idea that it was about state's rights is historical revisionism."

We already get only one day per year that we're legally allowed to place our flags in these cemeteries - President Obama saw fit to implement that rule by executive order several years ago - and now even that's being taken away from us. Enough is enough. The revisionism and suppression of Southern history, culture, and pride pedaled by these career politicians is unjustifiable. We aren't asking for much. We just want to quietly and respectfully honor the memory of our ancestors and the beautiful land that they fought for. But apparently that's too much for the anti-Southern ruling class.  I'm rapidly running out of hope. I worry that my children will be taught in school to revile their history and heritage. It makes me sad, but there's not much I can do about it."

Dixie,3bugj1,themadhatter99,2,Mon Jul 13 02:41:56 2015 UTC,"I live between Biloxi and Mobile. So I can give a bit of insight for West Florida.   Biloxi and Mobile aren't mini- New Orleans. There are were both founded by the French prior to nola, and by the same people. As far as the food, architecture, holidays and to an extend lifestyle and urban form they are similar.  However, New Orleans is in a class of its own...   You won't hear French spoken in Biloxi or Mobile, but you won't hear it spoken in New Orleans either.   I would say that really Biloxi and Mobile would be overall  more similar to Baton Rouge than to New Orleans  Historically West Florida extended from Baton Rouge to around Pensacola. A very thin strip along the coast. The historic Orleans Territory was included in the Louisiana purchase as the only bit of land east of the Mississippi. This is essentially when West Florida was born as an independent political unit. Land left over between Spanish Florida and the newly aquired Louisiana.  Throughout the 19th century and into the early 20th before the automobile. Cities along the MS coast were the preferred vacation spots for wealthy New Orleanians and a lot of cultural exchange happened as a result, and this built on and reinforced historic similarities and cultural ties.  It can't be stressed enough how strong of a cultural influence New Orleans had especially for such an honestly small city.  Yes, New Orleans has a lot of crime. A lot. But as a visitor who is aware of their surroundings you shouldn't have a problem. Crime is less in Biloxi and Mobile but still above national average.

I was taught in middle school (maybe high school) in PA that the Emancipation Proclamation only applied to states that had seceded, which included a whole discussion about the fact that the North's intent was not to abolish slavery but rather to maintain the integrity of the Union. Of course the eventually implication of that Union would have been the abolition of slavery, but that's not the same thing. My evidence may be anecdotal, but no more so than yours.

Dixie,3bdvty,CustosClavium,9,Sun Jun 28 08:03:49 2015 UTC,"An independent Southern republic today would be... beautifully complex.  First of all, we would need to be prepared to handle the massive migration that would occur in the aftermath of our independence. A lot of the Northerners in our cities would probably voluntarily choose to retain their U.S. citizenship and leave for the North or West. There might also be an exodus from (or to) South Florida; it's not Southern in any way except geographically, and I wouldn't be opposed to giving it near-total autonomy. I imagine a Southern republic would probably have strong states' rights, so just separating it from Florida as a new state would probably be enough to give the Northerners and Latin Americans there the autonomy that they'll undoubtedly want.  Incidentally, I don't know how strong a president we would even have, again considering that the South is the stronghold of states' rights. One thing we would have to address is the issue of ensuring that black Southerners don't feel left out of the political process; some kind of proportional representation by state in our House of Representatives (or equivalent legislative body) and direct election of our President could help solve that. This would, of course, entail some political upheaval as we ironed out the details under a provisional government.  One of the best things about Southern independence is that we could seize control of our media from Hollywood and produce television and movies locally instead. Our cooking shows would probably be a lot more interesting than those currently on, and we could finally hear Southern accents in a wider variety of shows than Duck Dynasty and Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. Independence would lead directly to a cultural Southern Renaissance, since we would have to literally replace all of the junk that Hollywood has been giving us for decades. The vast majority of movie stars and television personalities today are non-Southern, so we would have a unique opportunity to really start from scratch in that regard."
Dixie,3bdvty,Juteshire,4,Sun Jun 28 18:59:01 2015 UTC,"I really wish someone would do something about the Hollywood thing now. So far the most positive representation of Southerners in the media has been The Walking Dead. But even then, you got these people walking around the backwoods of Georgia for 4 seasons and there wasn't even a Rebel flag anywhere they've been. For real? Have these people been to Georgia? But anywho, the only place people want to see us on TV is a ""reality"" show where we're making fools of ourselves.

Dixie,3bdvty,thabe331,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:14:05 2015 UTC,There would also be a large exodus of military bases and US companies.

Dixie,3bdvty,Juteshire,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:15:06 2015 UTC,"We would probably have to deal with big companies abandoning us, but we could just seize abandoned property and sell it to local companies or businesspeople relatively cheaply. Factories, stores, and other physical infrastructure would end up in our hands whether they like it or not. I suppose they could cut off our access to online markets by refusing to ship to us; that would be a bigger problem. But honestly, it would be almost as bad for them as for us, so I'm not certain that this would even occur.  Trade is a bigger problem. That said, if we remained on good terms with the U.S., we could probably continue trading with U.S. allies worldwide; and if we ended up on bad terms with the U.S., we could attempt to trade more heavily with countries like Russia and China, which have a fairly strong trade network which is explicitly oriented towards countries that the U.S. views as pariahs (for example, Iran is increasingly becoming part of this network). We'd probably be the most democratic country in the network, but even if you find dictatorship distasteful, it's better to hold your nose and sidle up to Putin and Xi than to starve to starve to death.  As for the military, have no worries! The U.S. military, in terms of personnel, is more than 40% Southern. Like the big companies, they can't easily move physical infrastructure, so even if the U.S. wanted to keep its bases and equipment, we could easily seize it; and assuming that most Southern soldiers remained loyal to the South rather than the U.S., we would have a rather formidable military from Day 1.  (I think that we should consider all legitimate potential concerns, because it's more fun that way, at least for me.)"
Dixie,3bdvty,thabe331,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:22:11 2015 UTC,"Iran can be interesting (in this theoretical world and the real one) given sanctions being removed could actually damage Russia's economy which is heavily driven by oil sales.   As for the US military the operations are based out of DC and given who they serve and where the money comes from I'd expect they'd stay loyal to the US. and like a lot of the big companies, I think you'd be surprised how fast they can get most of their stuff moved out. Also the seizure of military equipment would not be a peaceful arrangement.  It'd be interesting to see the quality Chinese companies would send to you. I've not heard very good things about their chemicals.  Once again too, I will be very interested in seeing if Iran is going to remain a pariah as you put it to the western world. I had heard that sanctions against Iran were a godsend to the Russian economy.  I do find it an interesting idea, that if a secession were to occur, economic blockades would be more likely than an actual military attack."
Dixie,3bdvty,Juteshire,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:33:00 2015 UTC,"There are more factors affecting a soldier's loyalty than who signs his paycheck; you have loyalty to your family, your people, your home, your ideals... and then there's common sense. Most Southerners have some pride in their family and where they come from, so I don't need to explain that. But remember that U.S. military spending is encouraged by conservatives, and conservatives rely on the South for political power; a smaller, more liberal U.S. would almost definitely not maintain current levels of military spending. Any Southern soldier with half a heart and a quarter of a brain would flee back to Dixie the moment she became independent.  As for non-Southern companies, they can't move their buildings and they can neither move most of their local employees nor obligate them to help move equipment out of the country. So companies would have two choices: continue doing business in the South, or lose just about everything you've invested in the South thus far. They may flee, but if they do, they'd have to leave everything from buildings to trade secrets behind, and we wouldn't hesitate to take advantage of that.  As for trade, a lot of U.S. products come from China anyway; sure, we'd still suffer some loss of quality in our imports, but again, it's better than starving. Besides, we'd probably be able to get a lot of goods from the U.S., sanctions or not. The border would be long and relatively porous; even Iran, under heavy sanctions and a few thousand miles of ocean away, manages to get goods from the U.S., so we could definitely manage it.  We would face a lot of problems, no doubt, but none that we couldn't muddle through with some time and Southern ingenuity."

I respond to calls for censorship by generating more things to censor. I'm a straight woman, when my boyfriend saw me making the flag he asked if it was, ""for gay people to troll Republicans"" I said no, it could just as well be for the opposite. It can be a ""confederate peace flag"" instead of a battle flag. It's a design that could get overlooked in the rush to take down any red field with a blue cross. The white lines and stars are like roads and houses, neutral infrastructure. The yellow and green checker pattern in the center makes me think of corn fields and Maryland's flag. I enjoy the juxtaposition of the top and bottom of the flag. In the top half the bars are all partially blue (purple and green, are part blue) and 2/3rds of the background in the top is red or half red.

Nobody from the North thinks that. That's something y'all made up. But when we see you rallying behind the confederate flag, all we see is folks rallying behind a symbol that's hurtful to a large group of people who have done nothing wrong and are especially hurting right now.

If folks from the South are looking for a way to repair the reputation of the region, this is it."
Dixie,3b0y5q,JankyFool,7,Thu Jun 25 17:45:22 2015 UTC,"I totally understand how flying the Rebel flag in particular comes across as insensitive, and it's true that we need to have a real conversation about what it means to us and fellow black Southerners.   Unfortunately, it seems the country has made up its mind already, and virtually everything even remotely displaying ties to the Confederacy is being barred and banned. There's absolutely no denying the Civil War was in large part fought over slavery and the Confederacy fought for that disgusting institution. But at the same time, it can't be denied the War was fought for reasons beyond just slavery that were largely concerned with Southern identity and the free will of Southern people. The disparity of the newly industrialized, urbanized North against the old fashioned agricultural South only furthered cultural tensions, and the North's impetus to end slavery came across as tyrannical, unjust, and most of all sinful thanks to the South's twisted interpretation of the Bible at the time. So while none of this excuses the institution of slavery itself, many of the issues associated with the Confederacy's fight, such as cultural disparity and a strong sense of Southern identity, can still be felt today. Ask any Southerner on a rural country street what they think of slavery, and they'll most certainly tell you how depraved and horrifying such an idea is. Ask any Southerner how they feel about civil rights, and you'll  hear them tell you in the eyes of God all are equal.  My point here being that ideas change. We are already seeing it happen even now in the conservative Deep South regarding gay rights. This is where most of the contention about the Rebel flag comes up: yes, our ancestors were wrong, but we know that, and now we think differently. But we're still proud of who we are and who we have been, even our flawed ancestors. George Washington himself owned slaves, but we honor him with the Union's capital city, and use his coat of arms as its flag. Why do we do this, when he committed such a moral sin? Because we know things aren't so black and white; Washington was a great man with great accomplishments, despite the flawed beliefs of his time. This is the way most Southerners view the Confederacy; a deeply flawed state that deserved to fail, but a highly ambitious idea that resonates even still.  And then there are most who just don't take it that seriously. While I've tried not to ramble and get off topic I've found it oddly difficult to explain. I'll sum it up as best I can: the flag represents Southern heritage and identity, and since the ideas of racism and slavery are dead to all (decent) Southerners, Dixie just doesn't associate it with that.  But don't misconstrue this as tone-deaf, I hear what you're saying. I absolutely think it's a discussion we need to have among black and white Southerners. The thing is, I disagree when you say that no one in the North automatically associates the South with racism; this association has been around for a long time, partly due to the South's portrayal in the media, and partly because of the resistance some parts of it put up against the change of the 1950s and 60s. But the level of rhetoric we're seeing here, the vandalizing of Confederate monuments, pulling of Southern merchandise from stores, the historical revisionism happening in which Confederate Generals, many of whom had differing opinions on slavery, are being demonized; it's all extremely antagonizing and comes across as judgmental and condescending. It simply isn't ok to go through the history books and start rewriting it so we view our Civil War the way North Korea views theirs, in which the Great Leaders triumph and the Evil Satanic foes are vanquished; beyond the South and North, this is not the American way.   So without going on forever, I want to say I completely hear you and I think we all want to talk about this. I'm from Kentucky and I want to have a real conversation about our Jefferson Davis statue (mostly because it seems out of place given our State's position in the War...), but first we all have to stop yelling at each other, and try to understand one another."

This is currently a hot topic and is certainly relevant to the South. You are certainly entitled to your opinion and are welcome to express it through conversation here. Free speech is welcome here as long as it is not riddled with personal attacks, racism, or troll-like behavior. Many of us are supporters of the symbols of the Confederacy and hold our ancestors who fought for it in high esteem. You do not have to like that, and are free to disagree and debate as you see fit."
Dixie,3ayi8j,kittenz23,5,Wed Jun 24 15:00:36 2015 UTC,I actually love the Bonnie Blue flag. I know the CSA used it as well but it's a perfect representation of the independence and individualism of the South.  Though I really just wish we could all stop yelling at each other and be able to have a real discussion about the Battle flag and what it means to us.
Dixie,3ayi8j,zacktheman,3,Thu Jun 25 04:43:08 2015 UTC,Considering all the controversy around the battle flag I've recently decided to take it down.   That's sad. It's the opposite of what a Dixie flag bearer would do.
Dixie,3ayi8j,sachalamp,5,Thu Jun 25 11:28:56 2015 UTC,"Well since I took it down, guess I'm not a dixie flag bearer now am I?"

But I like the idea.  https://i.imgur.com/RFTPKRn.jpg  This one keeps the St. Patrick Cross/saltire (basically Alabama's flag reversed) and puts the Bonnie Blue on top of it.

Dixie,3ayi8j,SaveTheSouth,2,Wed Jun 24 22:21:04 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with that flag is that it still has the battle flag on it.  Anything that has the battle flag on it will be tied to white supremacists of the 50s and 60s who used it.  And, whether we like it or not, to many Americans they have become irrevocably connected. So flying that instead would not really help.  The first national flag, the stars and bars, might be a better alternative.  Or perhaps the Blue Bonnie as suggested above."
Dixie,3ayi8j,ADS94,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:28:51 2015 UTC,"I took mine down a long time ago, and I only used it a bit before educating myself a bit more on it. I currently fly General Lee's Headquarter's Flag. I feel it strongly ties itself to the South, but appeals to a higher understanding of the war like General Lee had. The arrangement are the states of the Confederacy, but are done in a Christian pattern, while it maintains the stars and bars. On other occasions, I will fly the 1st National flag (I own the 7 star,9-star,11-star, and 13-star flag). I own the Second National and Third National, but I do not fly them due to the inclusion of the battle flag. I also own a square battle flag, but I ONLY use that in commemoration of my ancestor's service in the army.  I feel if we wish to represent our southern heritage, we need to get rid of the racist rectangular flag all together. Let the racists and bigots take the flag. We should adopt the stars and bars, or continue to strive to find our own regional flag."

Dixie,3ashlb,RootHouston,9,Tue Jun 23 03:46:21 2015 UTC,"My great (x5) Grandfather served in the war. He rode in the Valley Campaign of 1864 and fought in the Battle of Five Forks under George Pickett, along with other skirmishes and minor battles. My 5x great Grand Uncle served in Pickett's Charge and surrendered at Appomattox. I feel strongly that the rectangular flag, the naval ensign, is used by racists through and through and should be considered a racist flag. I feel the Battle Flag of the Army of Northern Virginia (square with a white border) is perfectly fine if used in a historical context to honour those who fought for the South. I feel that the other national flags represent Southern Pride, as they were actual symbols of the nation that we once lived under. The only credit I can give the disgusting racists is that they didn't hijack the Stars and Bars, nor the stainless or bloodstained banner."
Dixie,3ashlb,ADS94,9,Tue Jun 23 12:45:33 2015 UTC,"If a person wants to fly a Confederate flag thats fine with me. Having it on State's property is just a mess not worth arguing. As for the Slavery issue the U.S. flag flew a hell of a lot longer during that time and slave ships flew Old Glory. Also read how the Bankers, Insurance Companies, and Shipbuilders up North profited from the Slave Trade. Many profited and blaming a Confederate flag for people's ills is soothing to a people that worship football and the Kardashian's."
Dixie,3ashlb,FNABolt,10,Tue Jun 23 12:50:35 2015 UTC,"Pretty bad things happened under Old Glory: Indian genocide, Nagasaki and Hiroshima, internment of Japanese Americans in prison camps, medical experimentation on black servicemen, torture, mass surveillance of the American people...stuff happening now, even. Old Glory is also flown by hate groups who want people to think America belongs to whites only. It can be seen by anti-Muslim extreme right-wingers at ""free speech"" protests. Yet 4 years of civil war history makes the South a villian. And you can't just throw the blame of Slavery on the South like it was all our idea and only we turned a profit from it. It's like today how people talk about human rights violations in Asia while wearing their Air Jordan's, or denouncing drug cartels after picking up from their dealer. Yeah. Its fine as long as you get what you want, right?  edit I do agree that, through no fault of honorable institutions like the SCV, dishonorable hate groups have successfully expropriated the battle flag for their own ends. Because of this, the flag on the memorial ought to be replaced . I suggest the 1st national flag of the Confederacy as a fair compromise."

""Well, it's not comparable because the U.S. flag is a national flag, and the rebel flag is not a national flag"". This appears to be a liberal talking point floating around.  What a strawman.  As if it being a national flag has anything to do with the conversation."

Dixie,3ashlb,opa_zorro,3,Tue Jun 23 16:41:10 2015 UTC,"That's what I mean though. The attitude that the confederate flag is evil because it is not the American flag, despite alllll the evils done by America under the American flag, is part of the ""my country right or wrong"" trope."

Dixie,3ashlb,AgInBama,3,Tue Jun 23 10:58:18 2015 UTC,"The ""Stars and Bars"" flag, currently the subject of controversy, was actually the battle flag of Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia.   Damn, I thought NPR was smart enough to know what the stars and bars are. Apparently not.   edit: if you downvoted this, explain yourself. The article is factually incorrect on that point. You can't fairly cover an issue if you cannot get simple facts correct."
Dixie,3ashlb,zacktheman,11,Tue Jun 23 15:47:07 2015 UTC,"There was a fair movement after the Civil War to use the battle flag as a respectful symbol, usually pertaining to veterans. If it had stayed there it probably wouldn't be controversial, but it didn't. Racist shits grabbed onto it as ""their"" flag, and pretty much ruined it for everyone else. All other things aside, it's unusable now just like toothbrush mustaches.   But to address the ""heritage"" angle- It is indisputably rooted to the Civil War, which was about slavery. The ""states rights"" argument is bunk because the right the South was up on arms about was the right to own slaves. So it was about slavery. And I'm not sure why that's a part of history anyone would want to celebrate."
Dixie,3ashlb,AgInBama,8,Tue Jun 23 04:08:20 2015 UTC,I'm proud of the flag because under it our ancestors defended their homes from an unjust invasion. Their resistance to tyranny is worth commemorating.
Dixie,3ashlb,AgInBama,3,Tue Jun 23 07:25:25 2015 UTC,"I agree. The worst thing about the recent anti-Southern rhetoric is hearing these fools say horrible things like ""Sherman's March was completely justified!"". You know Israel has done some morally questionable things lately, but I don't go celebrating the Holocaust. (obviously not trying to compare those two things but you get my point)"
Dixie,3ashlb,AgInBama,2,Thu Jun 25 04:45:51 2015 UTC,How was the invasion unjust?
Dixie,3ashlb,2317,4,Thu Jun 25 03:12:19 2015 UTC,"For the same reason it would be unjust for us to invade any other country because we didn't like them. If that country hasn't attacked you or encroached on your territory, there's no justification to invade and devastate it in the manner which the Yankees conducted the war.  The South had every Constitutional, legal, and moral right to leave the Union and form their own country as they saw fit. The Union invaded simply because they did not like it.  ""Any people anywhere, being inclined and having the power, have the right to rise up, and shake off the existing government, and form a new one that suits them better. This is a most valuable - a most sacred right - a right, which we hope and believe, is to liberate the world.""  -Abraham Lincoln, House of Representatives, 1848"
Dixie,3ashlb,CustosClavium,2,Thu Jun 25 05:13:11 2015 UTC,"The little issue you ignore, and the elephant in the room, is the only reason they wanted to form another country is to be able to enslave and oppress black people at will. That invalidates their right to form a country, when the reason was so illegitimate and unjust."
Dixie,3ashlb,yeahmaybe2,5,Thu Jun 25 05:15:28 2015 UTC,"The North treated black people precisely the same for the entirety of its history leading up to the war. They did not care any more for the plight of black people than the South did.  Nobody is going to defend slavery; it was terrible and immoral everywhere it was ever practiced. But it wasn't illegal or wrong then. The South asked only for the right to be wrong, the same right the US has exercised countless times, from the genocide of Indian populations to the internment of Japanese-Americans to the passage of laws like the Fugitive Slave Act.  The North did not fight the war to free the slaves; Lincoln said he would conclude the war without freeing a single slave if he could. He waited nearly three years into the war to issue the Emancipation Proclamation.  You know what else was an illegitimate reason for forming your own country? Because you didn't like your King. Positively horrible for its time, which is the reason anywhere from a third to a half of Americans didn't support the revolution. If only they could have granted the same freedom to their Southern neighbors."
Dixie,3ashlb,yeahmaybe2,-1,Thu Jun 25 05:32:59 2015 UTC,"They did not care any more for the plight of black people than the South did.   I'm sorry good sir, but that is a blatant mistruth. The north fought long and hard against the spread of slavery into the new states being formed. Why do you think that the Mason-Dixon line was a thing? It was formed precisely due to the north wanting to limit the spread of slavery the best it could. Many of the most powerful politicians in the north were abolitionists, and blacks were essentially equal in the north, where slavery was outlawed in all but the border states.   The North did not fight the war to free the slaves   Perhaps not expressly to free the slaves at the beginning, but it was very much about fighting the institution of slavery, as it was wholly slavery that was the source of the despite between north and south. It was indeed the abolitionists in the north that came out on top to free the slaves. That sentiment did not come from nowhere.    You know what else was an illegitimate reason for forming your own country? Because you didn't like your King.    No, that's not an illegitimate reason. One could argue fairly that the king was oppressing Americans through the entire concept of taxation without any real representation, hence the Americans had the moral high ground to seek their own sovereignty.   The southerners had no moral high ground in the war they fought."
Dixie,3ashlb,yeahmaybe2,7,Thu Jun 25 05:41:40 2015 UTC,"The north fought long and hard against the spread of slavery into the new states being formed.   Yes, because of the 3/5 compromise. They didn't want to lose electoral power to slave-owning states. A political expedient.   and blacks were essentially equal in the north, where slavery was outlawed in all but the border states.   Couldn't own property, couldn't vote, Dred Scot decision, couldn't hold public office in many places, couldn't testify against white men, had to prove their non-slave status with a certificate in some states, the list goes on. Of course, that's just the legal side of it. Blacks were also subject to mob violence and vigilante ""justice"", particularly in Philadelphia and New York City, where whites beat and lynched blacks in the Conscription riots DURING the war.   No, that's not an illegitimate reason.   It was AT THE TIME, which is my point. The patriots had to buck centuries of social contract to make themselves free. Monarchies were supposedly given the right to rule by God to rule, so overthrowing one was an offense to the King and God.   The southerners had no moral high ground in the war they fought.   Clearly, they felt differently. As I've pointed out, the North treated blacks just as badly as the South did. Do you really think that plantations looked like Django Unchained? Jefferson Davis, like many slave owners, taught his slaves to read and write and established legal systems within his holdings, the punishments issued by which he could not increase, but could lessen if he felt they were too harsh. Why did he and others do this? Because they felt that slavery was nearing its end, and the slaves deserved to be prepared for free life.  Who are you to tell all the black soldiers who freely fought and died for the CSA that their right to exist as a country was unjust? Did the blacks kidnapped from their plantation homes and then imprisoned as ""contraband"" by the Yankee soldiers deserve their treatment? How about the women and children forcibly evicted from their homes, which were then burnt along with all their possessions? Is that the same Union that held such a moral high ground over the South?"
Dixie,3ashlb,SouthernCrossfire,-6,Thu Jun 25 05:56:57 2015 UTC,"An unjust invasion? Tyranny? You mean the war that occurred after the south seceded? Funny how that isn't considered treason, but something to celebrate."
Dixie,3ashlb,jpoRS,6,Tue Jun 23 12:29:17 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, even Obama sent a wreath to the Confederate memorial at Arlington during memorial ceremonies.  It isn't as cut and dry as bad vs good."
Dixie,3ashlb,yeahmaybe2,2,Tue Jun 23 14:14:50 2015 UTC,When SC seceded and surrounded Fort Sumter the commander of SC forces sent word to Washington to inform Lincoln that if he attempted to re-supply Federal troops inside Fort Sumter that would be considered provocation and they would open fire.
Dixie,3ashlb,jpoRS,10,Tue Jun 23 13:20:06 2015 UTC,Less than 10% of Southerners owned slaves.  What did the 90% fight for?
Dixie,3ashlb,yeahmaybe2,6,Tue Jun 23 13:15:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understood my question, what did the 90% fight for?  What made a poor dirt farmer who owned no slaves go off to fight? The majority of Vietnam Vets went because of the draft."
Dixie,3ashlb,jpoRS,3,Tue Jun 23 14:19:54 2015 UTC,"Possibly because some Union boys came down and set fire to the family farm, or at least wanted it in territory where their vote didn't matter and their tax money was being used against them."
Dixie,3ashlb,yeahmaybe2,5,Tue Jun 23 14:25:09 2015 UTC,"The slave owner was not the only one benefitting from the slave economy. Of that 90%, some would have been overseers, blacksmiths, carpenters, bankers, etc, all of whom relied upon the slave economy to continue their livelihood. Not just by being employed on a plantation, but because the plantation employed their other clients. The South was an agriculture-based economy, and before the Civil War agriculture relied on slaves.  Think about it, would the South have faced the economic hardship it did after the Civil War if only 10% of the population was effected?  And I'm not saying there weren't ""true believers"", I'm willing to bet most who fought for the CSA felt they were doing what's right. But that doesn't mean that those of us with the benefit of hindsight on the matter can ignore the enormous flaws in the moral reasoning they used."
Dixie,3ashlb,Magnoliid,7,Mon Jun 29 21:11:26 2015 UTC,"You make your points and do so reasonably well. Your first paragraph is well-done. Your last paragraph is  less so.  I would, at another time, take some issue with the phrase ""...enormous flaws in the moral reasoning..."" feeling that it is somewhat over-stated  As to your second paragraph,    Think about it, would the South have faced the economic hardship it did after the Civil War if only 10% of the population was effected?   My answer would be a qualified yes,  the destruction wrought by Union forces, especially Sherman, made life after the conflict difficult.  Simply the loss of male workers would account for a portion.  Also, freed slaves (most of whom remained in the South and usually on or close to their former homes) had to take food and support from somewhere, most had little to no experience providing for themselves so they would have been a factor.  And last, the War was, at least in family tales, a gross transfer of wealth.  Pilfering was rampant and encouraged.  There is a tale of the mother of Harry Truman upon learning that he had been elected and that he would be going to Washington, saying that Harry should check the marks on the silver because it had probably been stolen from the family home by Union soldiers. So, there were numerous factors involved to offset the impact of the effects of slave ownership. Think about it, why did Japan need world help after WWII?"
Dixie,3ashlb,Magnoliid,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:28:21 2015 UTC,"If anything I think calling the ownership of other human beings ""enormous flaws in the moral reasoning"" is understated, but that's not the point. If I can be permitted to go on a bit of a tangent, the position you are taking is why the ""Racist South"" stereotype persists. I know you're not saying that slavery was right, but it is simply not possible to make it a morally defensible position which is what you're trying to do. It was wrong, it is good that it stopped, and that's really all that can be said without sounding an awful lot like the cross-burning crowd. The same could be said about your anecdote about pilfering. The South benefitted from stealing humans from Africa, but disappearing silverware is presented as a grave economic wound. Again I'm going to clarify that I'm not trying to say anything about your personal character, just pointing out an issue many including myself would take with your points.  Back on topic I see most of your points (though some of your implications about the skillset of the newly-freed slaves are troubling), and don't really disagree. But I don't think it disproves my point- the South had the snot knocked out of it because it was all tied up in slavery. If there had been greater economic diversity, the impact would not have been so severe, and arguably the South would have fared better in the War overall."
Dixie,3ashlb,Magnoliid,9,Tue Jun 23 15:13:35 2015 UTC,"You are a thoughtful and considerate correspondent and I appreciate that, however, you need to educate yourself on all aspects of the history of the issues we are discussing.  Including the viewpoint of all sides. Slavery is wrong,  and I'm not trying to make it defensible, only understandable from a historical position.  ""The South benefitted from stealing humans from Africa"" Hardly a complete point. A few quick facts to whet your appetite for a deeper understanding.  Slavery has been a fact in the vast majority of cultures throughout history.  Most Africans were enslaved by their own people.  Most slave ships were Dutch and English, not American or Southern, no Southerner ever set foot on the African continent to enslave another, large amounts of New England wealth was created in the rum/slave trade, only about 5% of slaves came to the South.  ""To the victor go the spoils"" also includes the writing of the history books, so read mainstream American accounts with a wary eye.  The first instance of ""Legal"" ownership of one human by another human on the North American continent was of one African owning another African.  Court records of NorthHampton County Virginia. ""the South had the snot knocked out of it"" Again, hardly, the war was won to a large degree because of mercenary soldiers.  Also to a large degree because of the loss of one general.  Several other factors were also involved. ""the South had the snot knocked out of it because it was all tied up in slavery."" Though not a well-formed sentence, I tend to agree with this thought.  If the south had not been so agricentric it would have fared better.  Finally, I enjoy our debate, but I am on vacation and I currently have a mother, wife and daughter begging me to get off the computer.  So, I hope to pick up again on our tete-a-tete."

I can trace my lineage back to before the civil war, with stories that have been passed down about pioneers, war heroes, plantation owners, and entrepreneurs. I even majored in history at UGA out of appreciation for the subject. That said, I am not proud of everything I'm descended from, and I'm not proud of everything the South has stood for.  Historical appreciation and pride shouldn't be blind. We're supposed to learn from history, and when talking about the Confederacy we should be reflecting seriously on what it stood for. Individual soldiers fought for all sorts of reasons--some good and some bad--but at the end of the day the government they fought for was severely flawed. The Confederate flags represent that government.  Now, the flags don't mean the same thing to everyone. The battle flag in question has been used for good and bad reasons, but at the end of the day it still represents that flawed government that was built so heavily on the institution of slavery. No one should be jumping to conclusions by calling someone flying the flag racist. But the people who do fly the flag should be sensitive to the fact that, to a lot of people, the flag represents the enslavement of their ancestors.  As I said, I love the South. But there are so many wonderful things to be proud of here, including parts of our history, that don't include the Confederacy."

We're supposed to learn from history, and when talking about the Confederacy we should be reflecting seriously on what it stood for.    I agree, but it is factual that it is the victors who frequently write the history.  This is my belief as to why the entire Civil War is something we teach that was simply about slavery.   The Confederate flags represent that government.   If that was the case, why do people still fly them? Are they simply supporting a long ago government? I don't think so.   the people who do fly the flag should be sensitive to the fact that, to a lot of people, the flag represents the enslavement of their ancestors.   The people who see the flag flown should also be sensitive to the fact that the person flying it is most likely not a racist, and is doing so simply because they're proud of being Southern."
Dixie,3ashlb,CustosClavium,3,Tue Jun 23 15:34:56 2015 UTC,"I'll agree that it wasn't simply about slavery; it was complicatedly about slavery. There's a tendency to oversimplify the issues, but slavery was undoubtedly at the heart of it. That wasn't so much an argument as to why people fly the flags as it was a claim as to what the flag objectively represents. You could fly a Braves flag to show your pride in Georgia, but that flag still represents the Braves regardless of what you see in it. Absolutely. That's what I said in the sentence before that one. We're never going to make progress if we can't understand where the other side is coming from. That said, there are many symbols of southern pride. Why insist on the one that is tied to heavily to bigotry and oppression?"
Dixie,3ashlb,yeahmaybe2,3,Tue Jun 23 15:57:44 2015 UTC,"There's a tendency to oversimplify the issues, but slavery was undoubtedly at the heart of it.   Correct, but you're missing all the history that came after the fact, and we need to take it ALL in.  That flag was flown for more than a century after the Confederacy ended.   You could fly a Braves flag to show your pride in Georgia, but that flag still represents the Braves regardless of what you see in it.   Don't be so quick to proclaim that.  There are many of whom that make anti-rebel flag arguments who would claim that the Braves flag represents an intolerance for Native Americans, but that's a whole other story.   That said, there are many symbols of southern pride. Why insist on the one that is tied to heavily to bigotry and oppression?   Great question! I think I answered it somewhat in my first response.  The flag was flown for a lot longer after the fact to represent something entirely different than bigotry and oppression.  However, I would also contend that there are not many other symbols out there that so succinctly represent Southern heritage.  The American South is a place that feels distinctly different than the rest of the country, and a flag invokes a sense of pride that one typically reserves for a nation or an entire culture.  I think this is the kind of pride the South wants to feel for itself."

It's amazing. Then the always easy Fried Okra, corn bread etc. Definitely make the Mint Simple Syrup (makes amazing Mojitos and Julips). His method of cooking pole beans/peas is perfect - it's all about that quick vegetable stock, then the fritters you can make with the leftovers. His other book Bottega is also excellent and I get confused which recipe comes from which.  He's the real deal, his restaurants in Birmingham are well known."

On the other hand statues have implications, and one of them is typically that the figure represented is respected.  In this particular case you have statues that have some historic value (dating back to WWI), but that have lost their intended meaning due to their separation from the original fountain idea.  I think I agree that they don't belong where they are now (at least in the current context), but I would hate to see them destroyed."
Dixie,351z3r,Magnoliid,3,Wed May 6 22:45:02 2015 UTC,"I would personally disagree with removing the statues but that of course is up to UT.  I get that the artists intention wasn't completed with the fountain, I suspect though that these same students would oppose any art depicting a Southerner in a positive light.  I am genuinely curious if these students are mainly Texans or are they from parts of the country?  After they remove Davis will they go after Washington the slave owner next?  They can probably show their tolerance and enlightenment better than by adopting Taliban tactics."
Dixie,351z3r,arktraveler,3,Thu May 7 12:47:40 2015 UTC,I doubt they would oppose statues of William Faulkner or Jimmy Carter. We can probably all agree on some people worth building monuments to.  And I would hardly call splashing paint a taliban tactic..
Dixie,351z3r,Magnoliid,3,Thu May 7 15:47:27 2015 UTC,"I meant Taliban tactics in the sense of removing or destroying longstanding cultural monuments that don't adhere strictly to their worldview.   Faulkner could easily be criticized for his comments on race and his history of marital affairs.   That is the problem.  Everyone has issues especially when the lens that you are using to judge a person is the lens of a 21st century young adult.  I'm no great Davis fan, but he was a Congressman, a Senator, he served with distinction during the Mexican-American War. A war in which the President offered to make him a general in the militia which he refused because he genuinely believed  that militias were areas constitutionally left to the states.   He was President of the C.S.A., while he was no Washington he wasn't a terrible President either.  I personally wouldn't put up a new monument to the man but I would argue against tearing down statues of him.  Once you start with Davis where is your stopping point?"
Dixie,351z3r,arktraveler,2,Thu May 7 16:31:07 2015 UTC,"The key is to present a balanced historical portral of the people. For instance Thomas Jefferson owned slaves, yes but he was brilliant and gave critical help to the American cause"
Dixie,34z784,Heirsteir,11,Tue May 5 19:53:48 2015 UTC,"Well, not to be facetious here, but I'm sure the Indians that early white settlers pushed out of the South also resented their refusal to assimilate.  The story of mankind is cultures rising and falling and their waxing/waning influences.  The Old South and its traditions are slowly passing away and a new identity is forming that is only a little like it once was."
Dixie,34z784,wwstevens,9,Tue May 5 20:14:36 2015 UTC,"I definitely share your sentiment that we should be preserving the culture of the South, but I don't agree with your solution.   The South already has its own language (ok, more of like a few different accents) but it's largely falling out of use because of greater pressure to conform to ""normal"" mainstream American standards, and a similar pressure is happening to local cultures all over the world. I think we should be encouraging kids to speak like they're from where they're from! Part of the reason we are seeing fewer people use a Southern accent is because lots of Southerners don't see it as unique or as an asset anymore, which can we can work to change by being the smart and successful person with a twang (or drawl).   If you're really wanting to distinguish yourself linguistically as a Southerner, I say use a Southern accent!"
Dixie,34z784,oaks_yall,6,Wed May 6 00:59:15 2015 UTC,"I think Spanish would be the wrong solution. Instead keep Southron linguistic quirks such as ain't, y'all, and fixin to in daily use. Our colloquial words baffle most Yankees. If Boston can mispronounce most words and call it an accent and the northeast can use way too many nasal sounds we can keep our sourhron drawl."
Dixie,34z784,jl_snorlax,4,Wed May 6 01:17:00 2015 UTC,"I think we would be doing a disservice to our history and culture to just switch languages. If anything, I think we should go back to ""The Queen's English"". I notice I tend to spell many words more English than American already, likely due to having gone to a private school where all our books seemed to have been donated to us by the 19th Century. Basically, Merriam-Webster just decided Americans should read and write words the way we know them and made a dictionary. That is so typical of American arrogance. Southerners are a people of linguistic poetry, and the old style of English just seems more natural.   Edit:  I also want to make sure the other groups in the South have their native languages and dialects preserved. Like Gullah, French/Creole dialects, and the language of indian tribes in the South.   Culture is strongly tied to language, as language captures the spirit of cultural understanding. We know how much lyrical the Southern way of speaking can be. We love metaphors and similes...saying things like He's as mean as a hornet; he couldn't carry a tune in a bucket; that's rarer than a hen's tooth; they were runnin' around like chickens with their heads cut off... and so on. Our way of speech communicates our character. If we get rid of Gullah, we loose the last cultural link between Africa and american blacks, for instance. There's no other group like them, and they need to be given a fighting chance."
Dixie,34z784,CustosClavium,1 point,Tue May 5 20:22:38 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of Southerners' heritage does not come from the aristocratic families of southern England, or even England at that.   We never spoke ""The Queen's English"" here, and I don't see why we would.   Written language in the lowcountry has preserved older spelling customs to a withering degree, but aside from that there's no real tangent between Southern American English and Oxford English."

They're written in the style of those Idiots Guide to... books, and both are downloadable to iBooks if you're into that. Another one is The South Was Right!. It was written by a Southern nationalist affiliated with the League of the South (a secessionist group) and can be a little hyperbolic in spots. The book is pretty decent if you're willing to wade through the ""Damn Yankees!"" language.  These do not deal with Reconstruction specifically, but it is a significant topic to these titles."
Dixie,346z9y,CustosClavium,18,Tue Apr 28 20:13:19 2015 UTC,"First off, look at the response of the police and local government in the North Charleston murder. As soon as the video was given to them, they immediately arrested the officer and charged him with murder. A similar response could be seen back in August when a South Carolina state trooper pulled over a black man for a seatbelt violation and then shot him when he reached for his license. The officer was fired and charged with aggravated assault and battery.  Why did this happen? Why did the local authorities respond so quickly, so univocally, and so strongly? Some might say that it is because these two incidents were caught on video camera—further evidence that we should make all police officers wear cameras. While I support mandatory police body cameras, I think there is another reason.   The South has a history with race. It's a dark history, to be sure. But it's a history that we talk about all of the time. After the Civil Rights movement we had a very public reckoning with the evils of racism. Public individuals like George Wallace confessed that they were deeply wrong and publicly sought to amend for the wrongs he did. Moreover, as a society, the guilt of the South was not in question, thus its public repentance was necessary for it to continue. Every little boy and girl in the South learns about this history constantly in school. Just about every child in school in Alabama goes to see the Birmingham jail on field trips. Just about every child in Atlanta goes to Ebenezer Baptist Church on field trips. Every child in Memphis goes to the National Civil Rights Museum (at the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. King was killed).   This is not to say that the South has it all figured out now, but the public memory of the evils of the past runs deep. No one in the South would dare say (as the mayor of Ferguson said) ""We have no history of racial tension here.""   Contrast this with St. Louis (where I live, as a Southern in exile) and Baltimore (and similar places). There was never a public reckoning with racism. Back in the 1960s era, the majority ""moderate white"" populations of these cities understood themselves to be civilized and advanced in contrast to the barbarity they saw happening in the South. This made these cities feel good about themselves, ignoring the festering injustices such as red lining and horrific housing conditions. Because they contrasted themselves with ""the other"" of the South, they avoided ever looking at their own communities and seeking justice there.   So, why are their riots in these cities? Because there are many decades of injustice that have been piling up without any acknowledgement, repentance, or reforms. People have been abused for a long time without any one listening to them. A riot really is the language of the unheard."
Dixie,346z9y,EnochEmery,4,Wed Apr 29 04:15:06 2015 UTC,"Very interesting take!   I always figured it was because we, blacks and whites, have been effectively living together since colonial days. We've had our history of turmoil, but we also bore the same burdens after emancipation (namely, abject poverty for all). We have a common history but we've also just plain learned to get along better by necessity.   When blacks left the South after the War, they arrived to new areas as distinct outsiders and never seemed to have been accepted. Just shove everyone in one, really crappy side of town and tell them to figure it out. Being outsiders, they would naturally be treated different, but throw racism into the mix and you have a really bad environment to live your life in. Any aggressive act from white ""natives"", racist or not, would definitely seem racist for sure. It keeps piling up, then BOOM."
Dixie,346z9y,neal-page,3,Wed Apr 29 05:08:10 2015 UTC,"I think those are 2 very good points.  I came to say this. Even though racism does still exist down here, I think we've learned to get along for the most part."
Dixie,346z9y,KangarooJesus,7,Wed Apr 29 06:14:36 2015 UTC,"/u/purple_urkle is on to something with:   Maryland is a very wealthy state but if you make less then $70,000 you get treated like garbage. I think it's Beltway culture that drives the viciousness and decadence of the Delmarva area.    This is absolutely a class-based conflict we're seeing in Baltimore. It's much better described as such than as a ""racial"" conflict. Worldwide the police have had a long history as antagonists when it comes to repressing working class people and working class movements; defending the ruling class, not their communities.   This map says a lot about why the Southerners in Baltimore are rioting and not those in Memphis.  They're more of a minority in Maryland, where whites have had a longer history of actual white supremacy rather than the few cronies ""white supremacy"" in the deep south benefited. In the former Confederate States the only real benefactors of post-reconstruction white supremacist governments were those that compromised the ""1%"" of the Confederacy; the people who didn't have to fight in the war, whose land wasn't burned down, whose families weren't displaced, and who were the 5% of Southern whites that owned more than a couple slaves.   There are countless poor whites throughout the states that were ravaged by the Civil War a century and a half ago. Not so much in the border states of Maryland and Missouri, both of which we've seen riots in recently."

Dixie,346z9y,Montgomrie,5,Wed Apr 29 02:32:43 2015 UTC,"I'd say less urban environments, community oriented culture, no real reason to riot yet, prevalence of  guns deter people from attacking other's property, etc."

Dixie,346z9y,Arkbird443,5,Wed Apr 29 04:42:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's the reason as Memphis has a lot of crowding. Being a city with constant racial tensions and strong racial issues, it's very surprising there's no rioting."

Dixie,33uaox,KangarooJesus,4,Sat Apr 25 18:18:11 2015 UTC,"The Alabama waterdog, generally known as a 'mudpuppy', but distinct from the common mudpuppy is an endangered species of salamander native to Appalachian Alabama. I stumbled upon some reading about them awhile ago, and thought they were interesting little things so I wanted to share with y'all.   I don't know how to really write about a creature, but here're some fun facts:  •The largest documented specimen being a 288 mm long (~11 inches) female, the average adult Alabama waterdog is 5-6 inches.   •The Alabama waterdog is nocturnal, and mostly active during the winter; the species doesn't tolerate warmer temperatures easily. The colder out the better.  •They feed on various invertebrates. Mostly snails, crawdads, and earthworms.   •The species has no known predators; their endangerment in the wild is mostly due to the degradation of water quality.  •The endangered species has no current population estimate, and there are no state efforts to protect the present population, which according to the IUCN is decreasing, and has been since its classification as an endangered species in 2004. :(  Here're some more sources on the critter:  Wikipedia (Surprisingly lacking; maybe y'all can help buff the article up. I might when I get some time later on.)  Outdoor Alabama  AmphibiaWeb  itsnature.org (sorry, this website is hideous but they had a decent summation on the species)  International Union for Conservation of Nature  I would've made an album for y'all to look at, as that might be a little more titilating, but it being an endangered creature and all good pictures were hard to find. I found two nice one's, and one's rather small. Here's a good one, and here is a nice shot of the entire creature, but it's a little small.  It's important that we take care of our natural heritage as Southerners. Thought I'd share this with you, not only because they're neat li'l' things, but because they're a threatened species and it's important we have knowledge of the world around us, and maybe with that we can do something to make it a better place."
Dixie,33uaox,oaks_yall,2,Sat Apr 25 18:18:25 2015 UTC,So glad you posted this! I've never heard of these critters before but it makes me sad that they are an endangered species. I hope there's a group out there dedicated to seeing the mudpuppies survive!

Afterwards, a lot of it had been occupied beforehand and later utterly destroyed -- so reconstruction hit it hard, plus it and NC have gotten a ton of Northern people who refuse to assimilate.  There's still some very Southern parts of the state, just like Maryland and Kentucky, and we'll put it on a map with us, but it just has a lot more Northern influence than the rest of us.

Hampton Roads is the same way and Richmond seems to be heading there. Other than that, the state is rather Southern, most if the piedmont is no different than the same region all the way down to Georgia while the tidewater has only a slightly more aristocratic flavor to it than most of the South. I'm from very close to the middle of the state and I consider myself and my neighbors Southern but I had a rather interesting experience at school in New Orleans: Most of my fellow students were either from the deep south or New york northward. Half thought I was a yankee and the other half thought I spent my time at home watching darkies sweat in the fields. Virginia is Southern, but it's not the deep south and we've been suffering from a long term occupation, even in my part of the state.   Where I'm from lots of folks like to say the difference between a yankee and a damn yankee is the later doesn't leave. That pretty well sums up the situation in the Commonwealth.

It's not necessarily a bad thing that it's no longer southern it's just the way it is.  If the question was one of geography, I don't think there would be any debate. But it's not, it's about contemporary culture.   Edit to add: 'geographically' as in the historic extent of the south."
Dixie,31hnpy,FNABolt,2,Tue Apr 14 05:55:38 2015 UTC,"Well if we're just looking at cultural boundaries, there are parts of southern Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio that are very southern. But even up in Northern Virginia, there are still strong remnants of southern culture, it just depends upon where you look. Find some biker bars or other places popular with the working class and you'll find yourself some of that southern culture you're looking for. It's all the big money folks that came from up North that are diluting things, but if you get yourself away from that, you can still tell you're in Dixie (though sometimes you've got to squint to see it). Hell, there's even a battle flag flying off of 95 near Fredericksburg. You don't see that in areas that have gone Yankee."

We put American music on the map. Over the last half century Northerners have made their mark (mostly blacks that moved North, which I'd still like to find a way to claim as part of Dixie's cultural influence), but prior to that, everything new and uniquely American came from the South. Blues, bluegrass, ragtime, country, jazz, rockabilly, rock & roll...everything came from Dixie. That's something to take pride in. It's also pretty nice having most whiskey distilleries within our borders (assuming Kentucky is being included within one's definition of ""the South"" -- I personally consider it to be)."
Dixie,317tcp,dylanfurr246,9,Thu Apr 2 18:09:38 2015 UTC,"Happening in and around Nashville for sure. Personally, I think Nashville is starting to feel like Atlanta - big and generic.  It's more than just the physical growth and its problems (traffic, sprawl, etc.) Not to sound unwelcoming, but there are so many out-of-area folks there now that it's starting to feel like Any City, not The Athens of the South that it used to be.

I assume that when they wrote the song ""Resort"" was done with a double meaning to reference resorts since that's what they were tearing down the environment to put up and to reference a place the writer would like to go to that was being taken away.  Here's the wikipedia article on it http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Resort_(Eagles_song)   It was the first time that Don, on his own, took it upon himself to write an epic story. We were very much at that time, concerned about the environment and doing anti-nuclear benefit (concerts). It seemed the perfect way to wrap up all of the different topics we had explored on the Hotel California album. Don found himself as a lyricist with that song, kind of outdid himself...We're constantly screwing up paradise and that was the point of the song and that at some point there is going to be no more new frontiers. I mean we're putting junk, er, garbage into space now. There's enough crap floating around the planet that we can't even use so it just seems to be our way.

The banana certainly adds to the piece's provenance, as anything produced before the early 20th century likely would have been photographed with more localized produce, such as a tomato or an ear of corn.

Politeness is important because Southern culture is an honor based culture. It comes from the Scots Irish who settled here. Northerners are raised in a dignity culture. In a dignity culture, each individual has inherent self worth that cannot be taken away. In an honor culture, a person's worth is derived from their status in the community. Speaking rudely decreases social status, bringing dishonor not just on you, but your family. That is why manners are so important in the South."

Dixie,30vytp,dylanfurr246,8,Tue Mar 31 03:36:13 2015 UTC,"If I had to take a serious guess and paint with a pretty broad brush here, I would say that it stems from the North traditionally having a higher proportion of its population living in large cities compared to small towns or the country.   In big cities you can't hope to interact with everyone you come across, and most of those people share the same mindset. In small towns and in the country, you will likely run into the same people over and over and so people are more open and willing to interact with others because of the expectation that they will meet again. Hospitality is necessary if you expect to live in a small town, and historically in the South there have been more people in smaller towns and the country, and the culture reflects that.  Just a thought!"

Dixie,303n1p,Sleazyryder,2,Tue Mar 24 20:29:02 2015 UTC,Check out Goose Creek Symphony.  They mix Blues Jazz and Bluegrass.  Kind of like getting Flatt and Scruggs smoked up and plugged in.
Dixie,303n1p,DixieDesperado,2,Fri Jul 3 23:43:35 2015 UTC,"""Folk music"" is a vague term, which could technically be used to encompass most, if not all, of Americana. What specifically are you looking for? Bluegrass, honky-tonk, western swing..? Usually in America, when people talk about ""folk music"" they're referring to the music of the American ""folk music revival"" as well as the music that was influenced by it, but I wouldn't categorize most of Old Crow Medicine Show's music that way."
Dixie,303n1p,nicholasslade11,1 point,Sun Mar 29 15:34:11 2015 UTC,"I agree, OCMS kinda turned into dance music, but they still have a few songs that actually tell stories, which is what drew me to them in the first place."

Dixie,2zet1b,ADS94,1 point,Mon Mar 23 22:01:47 2015 UTC,I have the rectangular naval jack because it's easiest to acquire (and because it was a gift and I'm cheap). Thinking about ordering a 1st National. Maybe even a tag for my car! I see it flying on a few historical sites around here (Arizona) and no one seems to know what it is or else I am sure they would be protesting daily. Had a very interesting exchange at the only store in the area that specializes in selling flags...ugh some people.
Dixie,2zet1b,CustosClavium,2,Tue Mar 24 17:40:38 2015 UTC,"That's why I buy all my flags and related items from a webstore that has a huge collection for only $5 a flag. Has decals and the like as well, avoids those annoying folk in the stores."

Why? Because the shop owner claimed the rebel flag (which is not what I asked for, I specifically said 1st National) had been appropriated by ""home grown terrorist organizations (sic)"" and was therefor inappropriate to sell. He continued ranting and waving his arms around as he pursued me to the door as I tried to be a respectable lady and excuse myself from his establishment instead of try to continue an argument I did not start.   His google maps page is now decorated in confederate flags ;)"

Dixie,2zet1b,ADS94,4,Wed Jun 24 00:04:21 2015 UTC,I think the battle flag has too much history to ever be replaced.   It would be like replacing the U.S. flag.  Although the South Carolina state flag is pretty awesome.
Dixie,2zet1b,arktraveler,1 point,Wed Mar 18 20:48:15 2015 UTC,"I agree fully. The battle flag is part of southern culture already. You can't replace that, you could only supplement it, and then we'd just have two flags, which defeats the original purpose in creating a new flag. Besides, the way I see it, most new things these days don't turn out so well. I don't trust people to come up with a flag I'd be proud to consider my own."
Dixie,2zet1b,DixieDesperado,1 point,Sun Mar 29 15:45:03 2015 UTC,A lot of history that a lot of people find very unappealing.
Dixie,2zet1b,CustosClavium,11,Wed Mar 18 22:08:57 2015 UTC,"This is what I never get about the pro/anti flag argument. All complaints one can have about the CSA can be pinned on the Union up until 1861 as well. Slavery existed as an accepted institution in the United States from 1776 - 1863, while the Confederate constitution at least had a clause in it prohibiting further importation of slaves to the CSA (progress was a possibility). It's like someone yapping about how they hate cartels but has no problem buying weed on the streets that in all probability only got to them through the efforts of cartels, gangs, and other crime syndicates. Yeah, you didn't get your hands dirty, but someone probably died to get that weed to you...The north is as guilty as the South for slavery that occurred between 1776 and 1863 as the entire Union benefited from the institution of slavery though it was happening in the South.   Ok, so the KKK and other hate groups use/used the flag. So? Same ones also use the Stars and Stripes to drive home the ""this is white america"" point they like to make. Do we just let one group appropriate another group's symbols and leave it at that? Can Christians no longer use the Rainbow as a symbol of God's promise not to flood the earth on a mass-extinction level again because the LBGT community has usurped it in modern history? Should SC remove the crescent from the flag because the crescent is now seen by most as an Islamic symbol?   The sad reality is there is no such thing as a ""good"" nation. You can't look at any country and not find an atrocity or two in its past that was committed under the same national flag it flies today. No one's hands are clean.  Sorry, didn't mean to dump on you specifically, I just got on a tangent! This is a general rant."
Dixie,2zet1b,arktraveler,5,Wed Mar 18 23:25:56 2015 UTC,"Very well said!  I think you are exactly right.  If we don't stand up for our symbols no one else will.  I personally don't care for the ""New South"" thing either.  People have been talking about the New South since the war ended.  Just like with anyone else's history the South changes with each generation, but this is still the South.  We have a rich history stretching back to colonial times.   It should be remembered."
Dixie,2zet1b,arktraveler,1 point,Wed Mar 18 23:56:05 2015 UTC,There is a lot of Southern history that is not good.  What we can do is acknowledge and always remember  it and move forward.   For everything negative thing about our history there is something just as positive.  Also the negative things in Southern history have also happened throughout other parts of the U.S. that doesn't excuse or diminish the faults in the South.  I would rather look where we started and how far we have come.   I can totally understand why some people don't like that flag though.  I just don't see a new flag ever being able to replace it.
Dixie,2zet1b,nayrlladnar,3,Wed Mar 18 22:47:29 2015 UTC,"A tree-centric flag would be nice. Magnolia Grandiflora, Long-Leaf pine, Water Oak would all be decent choices."

Dixie,2zet1b,hungrytacos,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:06:52 2015 UTC,"If we're going with trees, I think a Magnolia, since it's grown in every state IIRC, or (Preferably) a Southern Live Oak. If we don't go with a new flag, the Bonnie Blue could work -- especially since its original incarnation (North Florida) was rebelling against Spanish rule.  Idk, the Battle Flag's just been abused so much in recent history that I can't justify it."

The government somehow managed to put an interstate, a railroad, and an oil pipeline right through the monk's property, which they had initially gotten pretty damn cheap. It became very good and profitable land. Now it sucks because it's marked up by those three things. Convenient. The area has always been heavily anti-Catholic and even the fire department refused to put out the monastery far back in the day. Anything to shoo the monks off has been fair game, but they are stubborn men of Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas, too! Some were students of or taught at the Benedictine Military school down in GA. They ain't going anywhere.  Sorry. Got kinda sidetracked."

Dixie,2y8l1m,Uberrees,-1,Sat Mar 7 18:05:39 2015 UTC,"I don't know why people are downvoting you. The confederate flag, and reasons for southern secession, are nothing to be proud of, and this kind of nostalgic observance of a flag which flew over the enslavement of over 6 million southerners is really messed up, especially given how turbulent race relations are in this region. That being said, the confederacy is an integral part of our regions history, but it is this nostalgic ceremony of this flag that I oppose, not the observance of and respect of our history. For the same reason that waving the National Socialist flag in Germany would be distasteful, the same thing applies here."
Dixie,2y8l1m,Rotundum9,6,Sun Mar 8 05:06:56 2015 UTC,"I think waving the national flag is reprehensible for that reason, I don't find anything wrong with the battle flag, though. The working class of the South carried that flag into battle against an army that was marching on their homes, burning civilian land, tearing families apart, and making an entire nation suffer through starvation and the aforementioned horrors of war.   We should be proud of our ancestors who fought in the Civil War, the vast majority of which did not own slaves, and did so for a just cause.   There's a reason it's oft called ""The War of Northern Aggression"". They didn't do it to free the slaves (that's not to say we didn't secede to ensure a stable slave-based economy), and once they did half-way through the war, Lincoln only freed the slaves he had no legal control over; the slaves in the union remained enslaved 'til after the war.   EDIT: I'm very glad to have another leftist on this subreddit! :)"
Dixie,2y8l1m,KangarooJesus,2,Tue Mar 10 00:52:13 2015 UTC,"That's a good argument, and one that I respect, even more so with you being a fellow dixie socialist! Glad to see i'm not the only red here. Thank you for responding."

If you have an issue with something, you can state it as you did (politely and with some tact), or you can just disregard the situation you are in and people you are around and step on as many toes as possible instead of having something reasonable and measured to say."
Dixie,2y8l1m,CustosClavium,1 point,Sun Mar 8 05:38:49 2015 UTC,"He's probably being downvoted for being acting like a jerk.   This may seem naive, but I don't see how saying ""fuck the confederacy"" is acting like a jerk, unless you harbor confederate sympathies (I am not saying you do). Sure, his tone may have been militant, but I found nothing really wrong with his statement and message, and I think that when discussing the confederate flag, the kind of anger and militancy it brings out in a lot of southerners (especially those of african-american origin), is completely justified, and should be welcomed. I personally am tired of watching people of my state and region characterized as backwards and intolerant, and am even more awestruck when I realize and witness that these characterizations have a good deal legitimacy and truth to them (I do a lot of anti-klan organizing and community work in my town, so I can attest to this first hand). It is therefore my feeling, that we should welcome this kind of militant backlash against celebrations of the confederacy, and we should realize how stigmatizing that flag is to a lot of african-american southerners in the dixie region and community. Every single time we wave that flag up with pride, racial relations and progress in the south take a massive step backwards.  EDIT: And so the downvotes begin, glad to see that showing disapproval of the confederate flag or the confederacy is a unpopular opinion here (not that I would know up until now, I just found this sub and thought it looked neat, me being from South Carolina and all). But this is not the kind of community I wanna associate myself with, its probably just me being a stupid SJW, but i'm out. Nice talking with y'all."
Dixie,2y8l1m,Rotundum9,3,Sun Mar 8 06:10:40 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you on this, but I do hope you do stick around. I, too, am a South Carolinian. As with our state and the whole South, we're a diverse people with many viewpoints and opinions as well as cultures. You are welcome to stay and I hope you choose to, and there are hundreds of other things about the South to discuss here. Just like in real life, some Southerners love the flag, some hate it, and some don't care. You are not obliged to support it here, and not supporting it is okay too. We just ask that whatever the stance, be respectful and mindful that this is, well, /r/Dixie, and more people than not are likely to be in favour of it and won't take well to brash comments as noted earlier."
Dixie,2y8l1m,CustosClavium,5,Sun Mar 8 16:13:56 2015 UTC,"There are quite a few black folks that have no issues with the flag... In fact, the only state that's retained it in their state flag is the same one that has the greatest percentage of black residents, and the issue of keeping it there has been voted on in recent history. Just because you associate it with hatred doesn't mean that's what it represents. That flag is a symbol of the southern culture, region, and identity. Your misinterpretation of it doesn't change that."

Dixie,2xkpck,Montgomrie,6,Mon Mar 2 12:53:30 2015 UTC,"Oh man. I've been working rather heavily on a paper about W. Gilmore Simms, who is an incredible writer. The really awful part about Simms is that he was basically left out of the American canon because he sided with the South during the Civil War.  If you're interested, check out ""Grayling; or Murder Will Out,"" which Poe called one of the best ghost stories ever written. His novels are a touch on the tedious side, but his short fiction is incredible.  Other great stories: ""Lucas De Allyon,"" ""Caloya, or the Loves of the Driver,"" and ""How Sharp Snaffles Got His Capital and Wife."""
Dixie,2xkpck,emptydiner,3,Sun Mar 1 22:44:35 2015 UTC,I think Simms is making a comeback in academia and will perhaps get the recognition he deserves for his literary talents.

Dixie,2xkpck,mt145,6,Mon Mar 2 07:14:15 2015 UTC,"It's always been interesting how much quality literature seems to have come from a region, and is strongly tied to the area. Even if there have been great Midwestern writers, they are not considered as Midwesterners. I wonder what makes region such a strong consideration in one area, and one more or less ignored in the other. For the South, I think it's because to get the whole scope of the human experience, these writers didn't need to look beyond the South. Whether it just be geographically, or the relatively brief history of the American South, there has always been something different about the whole region and the attitude towards it. Thankfully, it doesn't become boring by shying away from issues, but recognizing them. Anyone else have any thoughts?"
Dixie,2xkpck,oklabama,4,Mon Mar 2 15:25:49 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there are a multitude of reasons. Maybe some folks over at /r/AskLiteraryStudies would know.  I haven't studied the issue, but I am sure a large part of it in the South is our roots. We come from the English and the Scots-Irish, and the Celtic side of the coin has a very rich tradition or story-telling and lyricism. Of course, so does the English, but I think you'll find that Southern culture sways further more to the Celtic side of things than the Anglo side. We also are the only Americans to know what it is like to have fought and lost a war on our own soil. That blood, passion, and defeat has soaked down into our land and our eternal, cultural memories.  We remember what we had and what we lost, who we were and who we became. We ache over the agony of it as we still celebrate and suffer the aftermath...all of us do now, black and white. That kind of thing really changes a whole people for generations. Throw in the deeply-woven influence of Christianity, and you have a very passionate, mythical-thinking, imaginative, grieving, struggling, creative, and introspective people as a rule it seems.  I can't think of anyone who embodies that better than Flannery O'Connor myself. That woman had an astonishing imagination and she knew the South like a mother knows a child. I mean, I know every single character she ever wrote into being, because her descriptions are deadly accurate of the average Southerner, down to the bones."
Dixie,2xkpck,emptydiner,3,Tue Mar 3 06:31:41 2015 UTC,"I'm from Chicago, and if you asked me to start naming Chicago (or even ""Midwestern"" in general) authors, I'd have to gather my thoughts before I could just start spitting out answers (other than Sandburg's Chicago Poems, but that almost feels like cheating). Vonnegut mentions Indianapolis in some of his novels, but I don't think of him specifically as an Indiana writer. Ernest Hemingway, one of the most famous American writers of the 20th century, grew up just in the shadow of the Chicago skyline and yet he never put out some sort of ""great Chicago novel."" I'm by no means saying that there are no identifiable works or artists that relate to Chicago or the Midwest in general, but I definitely agree with you that artists from the South, more often than not, have a close and a very conscious relationship to their specific culture, history, and environment that is impossible to separate them from. There are lots of stories like Winesburg, Ohio that are about small towns, but more often than not they are more a statement about city vs. rural life than they are about the specific town or state in which they take place. Literature about/from New York is really the only thing that compares as far as identification goes because it has been such a hub for culture, immigration, business and industry, etc. for so long."

Dixie,2xcm5x,Capricancerous,1 point,Mon Mar 2 06:31:39 2015 UTC,"If you've read his books, you'd know that was irrelevant. Douglas Adams is from earth but still wrote a book about space."
Dixie,2xcm5x,fayettevillainjd,2,Mon Mar 2 13:09:36 2015 UTC,"Really? I think Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice of Men are the only books of his to deal with southerners, and it's about their transitional state on the way to California in the time of the Depression. East of Eden is set explicitly in the Salinas Valley which was his home, and it's in California. I have read the former two I mentioned, and he's just not generally thought of her classified as a southern writer in any sphere that I know of.  Your analogy is neither here nor there."
Dixie,2xcm5x,Capricancerous,1 point,Mon Mar 2 16:21:42 2015 UTC,"but the themes are the same.  if he didn't say it was California, you couldn't have discerned the settings from any Faulkner books.  Red pony is the same way."

Dixie,2xcm5x,Ribald_Partisan,7,Fri Mar 13 13:55:02 2015 UTC,"I really like Walker Percy's ""The Moviegoer"". It's a little too meandering for some folk but it really captures what ennui is like, specifically in the context of a well-off New Orleans family. There are some well written moments that depict South Louisiana nuance and atmosphere that i was particularly impressed with."
Dixie,2xcm5x,CustosClavium,6,Fri Feb 27 15:44:20 2015 UTC,"My favourite Southern author is Flannery O'Connor! Probably one of the best, just not as widely know as I wish."
Dixie,2xcm5x,Ribald_Partisan,4,Fri Feb 27 19:36:49 2015 UTC,She actually is very widely known. I live in Portland right now and you have to fight to get her books at the library. She's in every college American lit anthology.
Dixie,2xcm5x,CustosClavium,2,Fri Feb 27 21:00:11 2015 UTC,"I heard she is well known among english major types, but almost anyone I talk to has never heard of her, whereas they have heard of other Southern authors."
Dixie,2xcm5x,Megafuncrusher,2,Sat Feb 28 19:26:22 2015 UTC,"I've read a handful of her stories and one of her novels, ""The Violent Bear it Away."" Man, she's good. I also recommend a biography on her written by Brad Gooch a few years ago. It's a little dry in places, but it really filled her out as a person for me."
Dixie,2xcm5x,capedconstable,5,Mon Mar 2 05:33:16 2015 UTC,"My favorite book that is Southern would have to be twofold: Wise Blood by Flannery O'Connor and All The King's Men by Robert Penn Warren. The reason I have two books is because one represents the philosophical, cultural, and theological side of the South (Wise Blood) while the other represents political and social interests of the South. Both books are brilliantly written and depict characters and ideas that allow for some very deep thinking to be done by the reader."
Dixie,2xcm5x,godbottle,1 point,Mon Mar 2 01:48:44 2015 UTC,"Seconding All the King's Men.  Nothing really even comes close for me.  Something about Robert Penn Warren's perfectly wistful writing style just sends me away for a while.  What a brilliant, brilliant book, that is not just my favorite Southern book, but just downright one of my absolute favorite books in general."

Dixie,2wy3w0,woodyallin,3,Tue Feb 24 02:58:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know where or how it began, but the concept comes to us from our British forefathers, who themselves just got it from European culture at the time.   Kind of like how calling a female a lady is more polite than calling her a woman.   While sir/ma'am is nowadays used for ""elders"" in a lot of places outside the South, at least as I was raised, you can say it to anyone of any age, though 16 seems to be the minimum."
Dixie,2wy3w0,CustosClavium,2,Tue Feb 24 17:37:56 2015 UTC,"I spent a large part of my childhood living in southeast Asia, and respecting your elders is every bit as important in most countries over there as it is in the South. It's just ingrained in our culture (as well as those of certain other cultures, as I just mentioned). But it makes sense to me -- the older you are, the more experienced you are, and hopefully the wiser too. Even if you think you know better, it's still proper to show respect to those that have come before you, regardless of whether they're right or wrong."
Dixie,2wy3w0,DixieDesperado,2,Thu Mar 12 18:09:36 2015 UTC,"It's a polite way of addressing people. Are you asking where honorifics originated from? They've been around for as long as we have recorded history. Sir and madam are British in origin. It isn't respect based on age, it's a respectful way to address all.   I wonder what you say to your boss, teacher, or customer when replying to them?"
Dixie,2wy3w0,DataSetMatch,2,Tue Feb 24 15:09:44 2015 UTC,"Sir and madam are British in origin.   Well. You can say that those individual words in their current form came from the island of Britain. But we're talking about culture here, so it's important to recognize that a ""British"" ethnicity or language does not exist (yes, you can call the shared elements of culture between the English, Welsh, Cornish, and Scottish ""British culture"", but I'm merely saying there is no unified ""British culture""). There are four nations on the island of Britain with five languages and many dialects of each.   In Welsh, Cornish, and Scottish Gaelic (three out of five of the aforementioned languages) the word ""madam"" does not exist, and nor does any word cognate with it. And syr only exists as a loan-word from English in Welsh.  Madam is a very distinctly French word, as the Wikipedia article you linked says, and it comes from ma dame or ""my lady"".   Sir is a shortened form of the English ""senior"", from the French senior, from the Latin senior. So this concept, even its spelling (and pronunciation) remained unchanged in its Romance origins, and still does today even as ""senior"" in English.  So it's very hard to say these words are of English origin, and much less ""British"" origin.   Are you asking where honorifics originated from? They've been around for as long as we have recorded history.   Not quite. In some cultures, yes. In others, no. In some languages today non-occupational honorific titles still don't exist such as in most of the native languages of North America, and in some Finno-Ugric languages. Other languages that didn't have titles since the dawn recorded history but do now are Finnish, all Celtic languages, North Germanic languages, West and East Slavic languages, and plenty others."
Dixie,2wy3w0,KangarooJesus,3,Wed Feb 25 02:21:59 2015 UTC,"Never called British a language, it's our ties to the British empire that we have the honorifics from.  I hope the op reads your etymology history of the words.    Didn't say all languages ever,  did I?"
Dixie,2wy3w0,DataSetMatch,3,Wed Feb 25 02:30:58 2015 UTC,"Oh, no I didn't think you thought British was a language. Saying the words were ""British in origin"" is just somewhat misleading when you're talking about language, for that reason of it not being one.  And while you didn't say you were talking about all languages ever, you did say that honorifics had existed since written history. When talking about the beginning of written history we're removing ourselves from the context of today's language entirely, so it's simply important to not leave things too ambiguous lest we forget the bigger picture.   What you said was right in the sense of the American South adopting that part of our culture from the British Empire's influence on the region, I was just clearing up some important ambiguities in the details of what you said. :)"

Dixie,2wph5q,CustosClavium,2,Sun Feb 22 23:09:39 2015 UTC,"Gullah or ""Geechee"" is an interesting language from the South, and one that's not been all too well documented by linguists.   It was once spoken throughout the lowcountry of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, down to northern Florida. Today the language is spoken by very few, concentrated around Charleston.   Here's a bit on Wikipedia about the Gullah people and the Gullah language."

I'm not totally positive but I think those are the same Black gentlemen at the Gettysburg reunion on film that mention the units they fought in.  That's the problem. Unless you find a Black CSA pension form or see picture or read a diary, it's hard to track them down.  The South didn't segregate the soliders they had, whether they were slave or free.  Some actually fought in battle, some cooked, some teamsters.    Up until the 1950s you'd see Blacks in the south proudly waving a ANV battle flag. What killed it was Southern Whites grabbing it during segregation.  Not as a show of racism, but patriotism.  Much like the tea party flying the Betsy Ross.  So now if an anti-Tea Party American sees a Betsy Ross flying in a front yard they think Tea Party.  Same with the ANV flag with some Southern Blacks."

However the inland Southern dialect of English is heavily influenced by Celtic orthography and vocabulary. (Why we don't pronounce our '-ng's, and pronounce our '-ow's and '-o's as '-er's.) Some southern words that have Celtic roots (incl. Ulster-Scots, which is really a Germanic language like English) are 'holler', 'hootenanny', 'loo', 'redneck', 'hillbilly', 'blackmouth', 'cracker', 'gringo' (which I know is from south of the border, but it comes from Celtic Southern-Americans influence on Mexico during the Mexican-American war; you should look up the history of that word. Very interesting.) The rebel yell comes from the Celtic war cry too. Also, funny coincidence is that the Appalachians and the Scottish Highlands used to be parts of the same mountain range some million years ago. :)  I love the linguistics of our li'l' corner of the earth.

More white folks were literate, compared to the largely uneducated piedmont, and virtually entirely illiterate mountain regions (the first person in my family to have access to schooling was my grandfather).  And in that region of the south, speaking (a bastardized version of) and writing the queen's English was a symbol of status.   Considering you're from South Carolina this makes perfect sense. My girlfriend has roots in South Carolina, and she writes like that. She also says words like 'directly' meaning 'shortly' which as a mountain boy I find hilarious.

The number of country music superstars (Reba, Vince Gill, Garth Brooks, Blake Shelton, Leon Russell, Woody Guthrie, Carrie Underwood ... many more )  that come from Oklahoma is evidence I believe it's culturally very southern.     The football dominated sports culture is every bit as evident as when I lived in Atlanta. Chicken fried steak, catfish, and any other fried food you can imagine is everywhere, everything outside of OKC and Tulsa is farms.  I think in the last election it was the most solidly red state in the union, with not one county voting for President Obama.  It's also a place that can feel very southwestern, depending on which side of the state you are in.  Tulsa as a city feels like the midwest.

The rest of Oklahoma is less obviously Southern, with Southwest Oklahoma being culturally Southern, but in a much drier climate. Northeast Oklahoma is lot like Missouri.

It's in the Ouachita mountains that, while nice, don't really compare to the Ozarks in my opinion.    edit: eureka springs is kind of like the hot springs of the Ozarks, and I would recommend it over HS"
Dixie,2ndukj,fayettevillainjd,1 point,Tue Nov 25 18:44:42 2014 UTC,On that note what's the best boating lake in Arkansas?   I'll definitely look into Eureka Springs. I just really like the setting of Hot Springs.

Dixie,2ndukj,fayettevillainjd,2,Tue Nov 25 19:04:29 2014 UTC,"I'm probably not the best to ask about boating as I don't do much, but I can tell you about the lakes I know: lake Hamilton is super crowded in the summer.  its fun for partying or putting around and looking at the houses, but not very good for water sports because of its choppiness.  lake Ouachita is less crowded, so better for water sports, but does get a crowd on the weekends, etc.  lake Catherine is the smallest but most secluded lake. best for water sports and fishing I think.  these are all the hot springs lakes.  the only other ones Ill comment on are beaver and greers ferry.  I've only been cliff jumping/climbing at these, but they are both great lakes especially for those activities"
Dixie,2ndukj,oaks_yall,1 point,Tue Nov 25 19:01:27 2014 UTC,"Thank you! I have some friends who go to Beaver Lake (?) I think. IMO scenery is important in choosing a lake to boat in, so Lake Catherine sounds interesting."
Dixie,2ndukj,fayettevillainjd,2,Tue Nov 25 19:06:52 2014 UTC,"my dad lives on lake Catherine.  its pretty and scenic, but pretty small.  honestly, Ouachita probably has better scenery because there aren't any houses on it like Catherine and Hamilton.  I cant remember if there are houses on beaver or greers ferry as we were isolated to just one spot without a boat, but I don't remember any"
Dixie,2ndukj,oaks_yall,1 point,Tue Nov 25 19:11:06 2014 UTC,Well I will look into it more. I haven't heard much about boating over there so I appreciate the insight. Basically our preferred Oklahoma lake dried up so we've been looking for lakes further east haha.

Why was there ever a colony on Roanoke in the first place, when it was known to be a poor location for one and the colonists' intended destination was the lower Chesapeake? (They got there too late for it to make much sense to press on and try to plant further north - but the circumstances of this are mildly suspicious. Were they sabotaged by their navigator? If so, why?) Did the Jamestown colonists find any evidence about the fate of the Roanoke settlement, one way or the other? (Publicly, they claimed the Powhatan had killed them all, but this is implausible and unsupported by any of several colonists' diaries.)  There's a book I like, Roanoke by Lee Miller, which addresses some of these sorts of questions for a popular audience. It's not anything like the final definitive word on Roanoke, but it's a fascinating read."

Hostilities erupted in 1730 with a series of violent incidents prompted by disputes over property rights and law enforcement, and escalated through the first half of the decade, culminating in the deployment of military forces by Maryland in 1736 and by Pennsylvania in 1737. The armed phase of the conflict ended in May 1738 with the intervention of King George II, who compelled the negotiation of a cease-fire.

Florida might as well be cut in two with everything south of Orlando (including Tampa and Miami) being the north. Houston, Texas and Washington are right on that edge. Houston and Texas can make inroads but it doesn't go beyond the Mississippi River and it depends on when the teams are good. The Nationals are too new to make serious inroads.

Atlanta, being the unofficial capital of the new south, had more regional influence, so local stations in a lot of those states picked up Braves games for Television. Also, TBS used to air a lot of Braves game in places far from Atlanta, so it became a team people could watch on a more regular basis for places without a team in their home states."
Dixie,2b9p9b,Phantomcruiser,2,Fri Nov 14 18:48:10 2014 UTC,I don't see why this is even a question.  Have you looked at a map?  Houston is at the very far western part of the south.  Atlanta is right in the middle of the south.
Dixie,2b9p9b,JV19,2,Mon Jul 21 05:06:14 2014 UTC,"WTF are you talking about? Do you not consider states like Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana part of the South? Eastly closer to Houston than Atlanta."

Dixie,2b9p9b,CustosClavium,2,Mon Jul 21 14:53:07 2014 UTC,I went to a game once as part of a field trip. Was not amused. Baseball is just so damn boring. But I had fun eating ice cream out of a tiny Braves hat.   I just remembered being outraged that we didn't see one damn peach tree on our way to Atlanta from SC.   FALSE ADVERTISING  :-p
Dixie,2b9p9b,CustosClavium,-1,Tue Jul 22 20:49:24 2014 UTC,"We just don't care about baseball enough to put much thought into it, and meh, might as well be them. We got more important things to concern with, like SEC football and whoopin' Clemson's ass."

Dixie,27tcaz,CustosClavium,2,Tue Jun 10 19:59:31 2014 UTC,I just found out about the concept of Southern Nationalism and the existence of groups like this. I'm not sure what to think of 'em. Thought it would be nice to get some reactions from other Southerners.
Dixie,27tcaz,SamnitesFall,4,Tue Jun 10 20:01:55 2014 UTC,Xenophobic halfwits.  That is all.
Dixie,27tcaz,bloodraven42,1 point,Tue Jun 10 20:38:25 2014 UTC,"Yeah.   I like the idea of the South as its own nation, but I am not sold in their idea of how that should work. A lot of language and ideas in their plan make me nervous."
Dixie,27tcaz,Neven87,4,Wed Jun 11 01:01:46 2014 UTC,"As much as I love the south, we'd be pretty well screwed. The south typically takes in more federal money than we give, we'd lost a lot of money required to maintain our roads and services. Things would go downhill fairly quickly. Plus we still lack a lot of the production capability of the North, and I feel like enough southerners are loyal to the idea of the USA that we'd lose any civil war as well."
Dixie,27tcaz,fluent_dysphasia,1 point,Wed Jun 11 14:53:33 2014 UTC,"The only way I can realistically see the South as its own nation is if the USA goes belly up and dissolves ""naturally"".   Like in The Postman."
