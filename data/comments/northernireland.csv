They'll let you stay there between 8am and 9pm, they have showers and will give you hot meals and advice.  Step two - get on to the housing executive/ benefits office and get what you can - it won't be paid immediately but you'll get the ball rolling.  Step three - Talk to the Simon Community. They have various hostels around Belfast but if you're under 25 they have a fantastic one on the Malone road beside Methody. They'll be able to support you through your ordeal and the staff are fantastic.  Step four - it may take a while to get into a hostel. Through the welcome organisation you'll be able to get a bed and a hot meal at the night shelter. They'll bus you from the Welcome centre to the night shelter beside Custom House Square where you'll queue for half an hour. They'll let you in and give you a hot meal a chat and a warm bed for the night. It'll do until you get a hostel room.  Source - spent various periods homeless between 16 and 19. Best of luck OP"

OP, in the mean time, consider getting your head down until Friday in a hostel. Here's a list, prices start at about £8 a night and you'll be safe there and able to get cleaned up for work and so on at the very least.  You should hopefully be able to get on the housing list as a priority - definitely speak with one of the charities linked above as they have the experience to help you do that in your interviews with the council.  EDIT: It hadn't occurred to me that you might not yet be 18. If you are, hostels may not take you booking in alone. Let us know if that's the case. Also, assuming you've never lived out of your mother's before, let us know if you would like some advice on renting a room or whatever.

Work out how the homeless shelter system works and what rules you'll need to follow.  You need to get proactive and and start looking into things today.

The NIHE will refer him to hostels, but its purely up to the hostel to accept the referral - usually because there are practically 0 beds on any given night available in this city in all the hostels combined, or they're pre-arranged for someone else.   Definitely decare yourself as homeless, go to their offices on great victoria street, they'll have you meet with their homeless services unit (hsu) who will call around the hostels and try and make these referrals."

You will certainly get assessed and speak to a homeless officer in the office on the day, but unfortunately getting referred directly by NIHE is usually reserved for those in ""priority need"".  If you don't meet the criteria you are fully assessed anyway within 33 days and pointed. In any case, self-referral hostels and saving money for cheap private rental is probably the best bet."

He declined (pride) but he said that the local gym would let him use their showers for free when he told them his situation. They would also use their kettle to boil water for him so he could make pot noodles.  While it may be tempting, try not to get take out food as it will eat in to your low budget. Instead opt for food that you can carry with you and preferably eat cold. Stuff like nuts to stave off hunger, and when you get a chance for a proper meal, include some bread if you can.

Sure, a lot of people with a history of anti social behaviour, but its rare to see that stuff inside the hostel, they're weeded out pretty quickly and asked to leave.

northernireland,3e25fl,PaperChampion_,4,Tue Jul 21 15:46:34 2015 UTC,"No we haven't. It's a perfectly legitimate point to make.  If you are so offended by the anthem of the United Kingdom and the flag of England that you cannot stand in respect to it (yes that includes facing it the same as the rest of your team), what are you doing in England in the first place? If you can live and work in England, surely you can show respect to its flag and anthem regardless of what your political opinions are.  It's a childish act that has needlessly brought up politics, that should otherwise be irrelevant to the sport."

Maybe most folk just think respecting national anthems is the non-douchebag way to behave.  Also - why is this worth a separate post? Already is a McClean thread going and this is just another opinion.
northernireland,3e25fl,skunkd,10,Tue Jul 21 12:58:13 2015 UTC,Is it disrespectful what he did. He stood still and bowed his head. He didn't interrupt the anthem or anyone at the game. Quite a dignified response I think.
northernireland,3e25fl,ClitDoctorMD,7,Tue Jul 21 13:07:59 2015 UTC,"Disrespectful is one of those terms you can call anyone because what is considered respectful varies vastly from person to person. In many cases most people can't even explain why something is disrespectful beyond ""It just is"", it is similar to the logic behind drug laws - ""Drugs are bad because they are illegal and they are illegal because they are bad"""
northernireland,3e25fl,DogShackStudio,-3,Tue Jul 21 11:30:12 2015 UTC,"What would you call the general British public's views on what is respectful in this instance, bearing in mind it's only ever this one guy who has this massive problem with observing the protocol?"
northernireland,3e25fl,skunkd,7,Tue Jul 21 12:09:10 2015 UTC,"I would call it what it is, their views. Why do you think following this protocol is respectful while not doing so is disrespectful?"
northernireland,3e25fl,DogShackStudio,0,Tue Jul 21 12:34:37 2015 UTC,A dignified response to anthems is to observe whatever protocol is there at the time - in this case facing to what presumably is the two team's national flags.

northernireland,3e20hq,PiggySoup,8,Tue Jul 21 15:13:35 2015 UTC,It needs to be a combined community effort to take down flags or murals or even curb painting. Meaning people who live in that area must be vocal about it. Though it's really tough to take down established one.  I know of one instance of residents of new housing development coming together to take down flags etc. I don't think anyone wants to get a mortgage on a home and immediately have that price depreciate because some arse hole painted the curbing.

northernireland,3e20hq,tigernmas,9,Tue Jul 21 13:44:00 2015 UTC,Used by republicans /= The IRA Flag.   The Starry Plough is the symbol of Irish Republican Socialism.
northernireland,3e20hq,PaperChampion_,3,Tue Jul 21 11:30:45 2015 UTC,The starry plough is very specifically a republican socialist flag and/or to do with the irish citizen army organised by james connolly about 100 years ago.

northernireland,3e20hq,DropkickMorgan,4,Tue Jul 21 12:32:26 2015 UTC,"The reason they're up is a complicated one with many points to be made.  Likely the biggest is, most flags go up during the day or in the dark of night, when most people work.  If you take it it down you'll be seen and likely spoken to by your local community representative.  Failing this discussion, the flags will just go back up again.  There was a woman moved in to my street not long ago.  Within a week of moving in she had dug a flower bed in her fromt garden and sitting proudly in the middle was a union flag.  No big deal in EastEastEast Belfast.  Until the next morning she found the brush shaft flag pole snapped in two and the flag rammed through her letter box.  I was told by our 'neighbourhood watch' leader that it was due to house prices and that 'no flag will fly on his street outside of July'.  So I guess it all depends on the community and who calls the shots locally."
northernireland,3e20hq,IrishRam85,4,Tue Jul 21 11:40:04 2015 UTC,Cause they will burn out you’re fucking house down if you say one thing! (but of course no intimidation goes on in any unionist / nationalist areas) lol

northernireland,3e20hq,Caesar3890,10,Tue Jul 21 10:35:52 2015 UTC,Even driving up the falls road you'll only see 1 or 2 tricolors and that's outside an old pub whereas it's abundantly clear which areas are loyalist. It's been making house hunting a pain in the arse. I'm not great on belfast geography and don't really know the areas.

However, are we really saying that in 2015 Ireland/Northern Ireland, it's okay for armed thugs to be firing guns into the air on a public street?!"
northernireland,3dxyin,flytokolob,2,Tue Jul 21 15:15:46 2015 UTC,"Well, I think you're giving a biased view: In my opinion a ""noble act"" is not being a criminal ergo in prison and demanding that you should be treated as anything other than that. Should we all bow to the demands of someone that has taken the lives of others selfishly? I would disagree.  Also, there is a large difference between asking for something like an emblem as opposed to asking for intimidating, armed paramilitaries to be marching and firing rounds. If my mother found out I were in a paramilitary she would be disgusted and would not in anyway ask for it to be celebrated.  Furthermore, I'm confused as to why the police were less involved than on other days of the year that automatically get a horrific reputation when the Orange Order go through organisations like the Parades Commission. What is to stop people like myself from joining a paramilitary group and parading to show respect for someone that has died? Water canons."
northernireland,3dxyin,joufflu94,-3,Mon Jul 20 20:30:54 2015 UTC,"It was a funeral, remember that. I've no doubt that intelligence were monitoring what was going on behind the scenes.

No point sending police in when there is potentially armed men in the crowd, and the young people probably would have started throwing missiles.

I really shouldn't bother entertaining these idiotic comments, but so you're fully aware, what happened at the funeral was that a handful of men in masks shot into the air with guns. Nobody was hurt and nobody was to be hurt. Masked men with guns isn't what anyone wants to see in this day and age at all - and of course the police should work to find those weapons and take them away - but they aren't going to intrude into a crowded funeral to do it, and they certainly aren't going to be shooting people. Do I need to explain why that's a bad thing?   Most of these people will die off anyway soon and nobody will be replacing them - those who still believe violence is a legitimate tactic are in very small numbers. They did unfortunately manage to get a dissident onto the council in Derry, but by and large the overwhelming majority of people of the city totally reject all forms of violence and want nothing to do with any paramilitaries."

What I read on the news earlier, they made it sound like a show of strength by a paramilitary group, and that made me uncomfortable.   But that's not what it was, it was a funeral. It was written into the poor woman's will, this is what she wanted. Yes, instances were illegal. Should the PSNI have broken it up? Absolutely not, that would be fucking insane. It's a funeral, and really the majority of those people were just wearing face scarfs and berets.    Dozens of people wearing military-style uniform, berets and dark glasses attended the funeral in Londonderry.   From the BBC website. It wasn't even a known paramilitary uniform, it was just vaguely similar. That's not illegal. And aside from it being a funeral, the PSNI know themselves it would just be a disaster to potentially start a gunfight within a crowd. They're playing it safe, and biding their time, which in my opinion is the correct course of action.  At the end of the day, yes it's a scary thing to happen in this day and age. Ultimately there was very little the pissnee could do, so they're doing what they can now. But this sort of stuff is on it's way out, probably half those folks aren't even in a paramilitary, just wanted to have a good sizeable crowd for the funeral procession, make it look military.

northernireland,3dxyin,skunkd,2,Tue Jul 21 09:27:16 2015 UTC,"Calling you a moron isn't defensive, and there was a need, because you're trying to convince yourself that such a flippant comment needs to be analysed like I'm Seamus Heaney or something.

They've killed and injured drug dealers in Derry and ordered many others out of the city - you can read all about them here, they've a long list of actions against drug dealers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Action_Against_Drugs  They've since apparently merged with other dissident Republican groupings."

northernireland,3dxyin,ciaran036,-6,Mon Jul 20 21:31:07 2015 UTC,I dont have a problem with people doing this. As soon as something goes wrong though there should be harsh punishments though.  The Government or PSNI can't do anything about this because if they did hell would breal loose as soon as a police office would have went near it.  And really it was peaceful and if thats how someone wants to be remember we should all support that. The media really wants to focus on the balaclava's and guns than what this was. A funeral.
northernireland,3dxyin,redzor,0,Mon Jul 20 17:02:23 2015 UTC,so its fine with you if I go and get a gun illegally? Or is it just ok because its the IRA? Seems there are different rules for the average citizen than paramilitary members. They seem to get let off with everything.

I couldn't care less whether a player sings the national anthem or not, considering most of the players probably aren't British. it was because he turned and put his head down when all the other players looked upwards and faced what appeared to be the flag.

northernireland,3dxfgb,starter5,4,Mon Jul 20 11:32:53 2015 UTC,"He's not making a scene, it's the people that are outraged and offended that have created a scene about it. What does it really matter if he doesn't participate in a national anthem?"
northernireland,3dxfgb,ciaran036,21,Mon Jul 20 11:55:18 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter, he doesn't have to participate, but don't make a scene by turning away in an opposite direction to your team mates. Other players like Yacob, who is Argentinian, probably would rather not have the British anthem played, but he stood there fine. You're playing for a British club, it's expected. Just keep quiet and get on with it."
northernireland,3dxfgb,starter5,-2,Mon Jul 20 12:37:08 2015 UTC,"But I take issue that people feel they have to keep quiet and get on with it. When I was a teenager, I had this same dilemma with morning prayers in school. Do I keep quiet and just get on with it, or should I just not bother saying prayers? For me personally, I struck a balance - I'd put my hands together to show at least some respect, but didn't actually say the prayers out loud. I'd much rather that I didn't feel obliged to participate, but for the sake of not causing a scene I at least pretended. But still I respected those who resisted completely, and still respected the rights of others to pray if they wanted to. Everyone is an individual, let them do what they want as long as it's not hurting anyone.  Perhaps McClean turning his back against the anthem does show a little disrespect though. Nothing that warrants death threats though."
northernireland,3dxfgb,ciaran036,0,Mon Jul 20 13:18:16 2015 UTC,Just keep quiet and get on with it.   That's the worst advice anyone could give.

northernireland,3dxfgb,ronnierosenthal,-1,Tue Jul 21 01:06:35 2015 UTC,That's such a tray bakes way to look at it. Personally I think he should have turned his back and lay on the floor with his face to the ground.

There isn't a 'level' of respect that's warranted here.  Either I'm respecting you, or I'm disrespecting you.  He chose to disrespect.  That's his choice and his problem.  Why everyone has to kick a fuss up about it I really don't know.  It's a national anthem, and this isn't 1940's Germany, you're not required to participate in overt acts of Nationalism, especially if you don't respect the Monarchy/Government of which you're singing to.    It's a free country.  And whilst I personally wouldn't do what he did, he's damn right entitled to act that way if he chooses."

northernireland,3dxfgb,HorriBliss,5,Mon Jul 20 15:49:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly. IF he had just turned in the same direction then it wouldn't have been immediately obvious that he wasn't singing the British anthem; while he could still uphold his own beliefs by not opening his mouth. With the poppy hanlen; it was immediately apparent he wasn't wearing the poppy, while his own actions in this case drew attention to him not joining in with the British anthem.  He has his own principles , but he really seems to be shoving it in everyone's faces for the controversy and for the ""poor me, I'm getting harassed"".

Perhaps he has a similar viewpoint.  That facing the same direction as his team-mates would show solidarity with the anthem, even if he didn't sing?  I'd agree that this would be an issue if he faced the opposite direction, and say that's making an obvious statement, but he didn't do that, he literally stayed put and didn't sing.  Nothing wrong with it, IMO.

An anthem is an anthem and you shut the fuck up when it's on and go along with it. Discuss it after if you need to.   He'll purposely cause controversy on the pitch for controversies sake.

Simply because if can claim ""his people"" in reference to an event that happened before his time then every english person in England can claim offence at his refusal to acknowledge the sacrifice of their grandparents during two world wars.   As the guy at the top of this comment chain said about his wages. How can he play for the big bad oppressors and live in the country of the big bad oppressors yet claim some sort moral ground over a poppy? And be from a city which would have had soldiers that went to war in Europe. That doesn't make sense. Besides the national anthem he has no excuse except being a total wanker. How many Irish men have come and gone without making such a disrespectful show?  He is a wanker and you are defending a wanker.   Edit.

northernireland,3dxfgb,nukz0r,6,Mon Jul 20 12:06:40 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt that his views are as childishly simple as that. I've heard him talk, he's not not a dumb teenager. If he's a Republican, then he wants a United Ireland - power removed from London and given to Dublin instead. The 'Brits out' slogan often seen in Republican graffiti back in the day is about kicking out the British establishment, not about sending Prods back to the mainland.  Do I actually have to explain that to you, or are you just trolling? Because it's seriously difficult to believe that you actually think that Republicans/nationalists actually want ""the planters"" to get the ""hell out of Ireland""."
northernireland,3dxfgb,ciaran036,-5,Mon Jul 20 12:37:28 2015 UTC,I'm simply pointing out the irony of how anti-British he is when clearly he has descended from the Ulster Scots/British.
northernireland,3dxfgb,nukz0r,6,Mon Jul 20 13:08:59 2015 UTC,"It's not anti-British to not want to participate in a national anthem. If he was anti-British, he wouldn't be playing for a British football team.   Also, his surname does not make it all clear who he has descended from, and nor does it really matter."

northernireland,3dzpmw,TheLeftFoot-of-Bobby,0,Tue Jul 21 09:37:50 2015 UTC,Article itself states it's not a mixed estate. The point is this is claiming something that has a special designation.  Nice attempt at deflection though.
northernireland,3dzpmw,Saorail-Trodaire,2,Tue Jul 21 09:40:35 2015 UTC,"It's not in the estate. It's on the outskirts along with other mixed housing.   Not that whether it is  in the estate or not should matter in any way; it's social housing, for all. Fuck your segregation. Just because some sectarian twats don't want to live beside someone from another religion doesn't mean the government should bow down to their demands. It's purely an attempt to keep a Protestant majority in the wider area. Don't even try to justify this."

I must also say to MP Dodds and his office that I saw zero concerns from Dodds or other DUP elected officials about all the 100% violent anti - Catholic sectarian hatred that was evident on loyalist bonfires in the past weeks. Dodds sadly you do not even pretend to be other than sectarian, you mouth about a Shared Future in the press item above but by your repeated actions over the years you are 100% sectarian!

northernireland,3dtklm,EireOfTheNorth,6,Sun Jul 19 13:26:27 2015 UTC,This isn't a scare. It's a viable device 'designed to kill' police.  Not just some kids pranking the peelers. How many kids do you know that are capable of making an anti personnel bomb.

northernireland,3dtklm,warp_spaz,11,Sun Jul 19 15:21:35 2015 UTC,"Um, this is a bomb plot in Lurgan, not the annual 12th of July stuff. Rather than a bit of bigotry and racism this was a move to actively kill police officers [people]. And not just some idle chit chat at the side of a bonfire about it.  I'm not sure that an event that leads to criminality should be banned. London's Mardi Gras leads to public urination, property damage, public drug use [which is mostly ignored, thankfully in my view], public nudity and is one of the most expensive annual policing operations in the world, and is opposed by many, many rich, old residents. But, that's for another day.   There have been numerous bomb plots in recent years. I always remember the north Belfast one where there was a Krakatoa style device found in a shed that was probably going to kill a good few people if it worked. To me, the small, but obviously dangerous threat from these little revolutionaries is very different to the loyalist threat.  99% might not give a fuck - but someone knows who these people are and someone knows where they're getting their training from. This is more of an anti-terror operation for security forces rather than a civil matter for politicians, police, residents, community groups and what not to deal with."
northernireland,3dtklm,cputnik,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:28:37 2015 UTC,"it's two sides of the same coin - a small minority shitting on everyone else  it's not just incidents like this, or the carnage over the 12th. our politicians operate to their republican/loyalist agenda regardless of what is best for all our futures  to take your example, if it was shown that the participants of mardi gras where attending with the intention of causing public disorder - say they caught some peeps with petrol bombs for example - then it would indeed be banned. if every single year the mardi gras inevitably turned into outright rioting, there is no way anywhere would tolerate it. there is not one city in the world that would continue to allow the same crap every year. dont get me wrong...both sides riot on we should crack down equally hard in both cases. anybody rioting has to face a sentence, and not just a slap on the wrist - months in prison  illegal raves are stopped yet bonfires go ahead without any licencing, without health and safety. flags are erected, kerbs are painted without any licence or sanction from the local community.   was it last year when a concrete block was dropped on an officer at the 12th?, and there's footage available of a PSNI engulfed in flame from a petrol bomb. whether it's a direct attack, or a planted device, the desired outcome is the same - to kill or seriously injure somebody."
northernireland,3dtklm,warp_spaz,2,Sun Jul 19 16:52:27 2015 UTC,"If we're talking about the bonfires and the 12th - that's a public order matter and should be dealt with by multiple agencies. And after yet another year of shit - and even more vehemence from Loyalists and young ""City of God"" type hoods - something's going to have to give.  However, the Public Order Act has never sat well with me; especially in a Northern Irish context and personally I think people should be allowed to gather and do what they please and act how they please - so long as they're bringing no direct harm to anyone. You'll notice I said ""no direct harm"" - so I mean that where harm/damage is likely or occurs - I am not supportive.  I do however not have any problems with effigy and flag burning. I feel that while distasteful it should never be legislated against because then governments can use such laws to ban further freedoms of expression and that is a slippery slope. That though, does not extend as far as ""crucify taigs"" because that is an outright threat of violence.   If we're talking about planting bombs and shooting at cops - that's not the same to me - that's going to be an anti-terror operation and will have fuck all to do with the public, politicians, or civil society. M15, the NCA and CID detectives will investigate that. Very different type of operation - and rightly so - it's a completely separate issue.   Now, I'm not saying that people who drop concrete blocks on people, people shooting 9mm pistols out of the Short Strand, people who throw petrol bombs, rocks, golf balls; people who bring AKs onto the street or shine lasers at cops during riots shouldn't face the full rigours of the law.   Personally I think the PSNI should be far more aggressive in such situations. If police had shot the OO man who brought that sabre to a riot, or the guy who brought the AK out in north Belfast I would not take issue.   If they shot a rioter who was chucking a petrol bomb I would also not take issue. That is a clear threat to life and I consider petrol bombs murder weapons. Do I think such aggression would lead to escalation. Certainly. Which is probably why I am not the Chief Super.   But someone attending a bonfire, erecting a flag, painting a curb stone, shouting and being offensive ought not face the same punishments as those people. They are not simply two sides of the same coin, they are wholly different grades of criminality.  There is a clear difference between terrorism and public disorder to me. But one can occur within the other."
northernireland,3dtklm,fire_and_shit,-2,Sun Jul 19 17:28:41 2015 UTC,I agree police need to be more aggressive in them riot situations. They need better weaponry to effectively stop a riot not just contain it

That's probably because of the specific type of post codes that have been rolled out, rather than post codes in general. Rather than something sensible like giving every road or block or something a code, and allowing the house number/name and sometimes street name to do the rest (like UK post codes work), they've given every single house or apartment a unique post code. Not only that, but they're randomised, so two houses next to each other will have very different codes.  This means that, yes, you can write a post code on a letter as the only thing on it and it will get to the right place but 1) if you give out your post code, you're giving out your exact address, which is a bit dodgy for privacy/security (whereas UK post codes can be used for some things relatively anonymously), 2) the post code doesn't help post men or emergency services with locating a place faster, since it's not like saying ""BT12 3AB? Well, I know where BT12 is and the 3s start somewhere around here, so if I aim for there, I should be able to find it"" or something like that - they're randomised so it's zero help in that regard, and 3) it pretty much requires you to be able to google it to find out where something is, so if you're out in the middle of nowhere and are given a post code instead of a full address (which is kind of what the intention was with giving each house a unique number - being able to have all the information you need in one string of numbers), then you're fucked if you don't have internet signal, and no one is going to remember every code for their area, so you can't even ask for directions.

Now I have a Irish/Catholic sounding name and I went to a Catholic school in Belfast.  Do you think me not being religious would have any impact on someone wanting to pick a fight with me because of my name or school? When the kids in loyalist areas threw rocks at our bus filled with kids from a catholic school, do you think they were concerned about anyone on the bus who might not be religious or do you think they just saw the uniform?  Think of the joke about a Jewish person moving to the Falls Road, they're a Catholic Jew, a Jewish guy living on the Shankhill? Protestant Jew.  TL;DR I don't believe in any god, but I have a Catholic sounding name an went to a Catholic school, for all intents and purposes, I'm a Catholic, as far a Northern Ireland goes anyway.

That would be logical and I've no doubt that is the case for most loyalists. But they do have a neo nazi element and have had for a long time.

northernireland,3dnjx3,kind_carrot,10,Fri Jul 17 21:32:36 2015 UTC,"It's an age old catch 22 but there are ways to break out.  (hmm, a bigger wall of text than I realised whilst typing...)  If you've never had a job and got the time spare then considering volunteering. Even if you do a day a week you'll have skills and experience to talk about along with a fresh reference.  How old are you? If you're young then you might have the cheaper wage advantage. (Gonna assume your out of school/uni but not employed yet?)  You need to be creative with your cv if you want it to stand out online but competition is really high online. You don't have formal work experience but you do know how to be a team player from X sport at school. Your a good communicator which is why you were chosen to speak for X events within school or at church when younger.  Your quick to pick things up and learn new skills ie a range of subjects just studied. Look at the buzzwords in the job ads your applying for and build your cv around it. Some recruiters will just scan cvs for keywords that match what the client wants. Try to tailor your cv to each role if you can.  You can build up some evidence for each buzzword generally.  I would advise though that you go out in person and track down a job. Competition online is so fierce that recruiters can throw up ads for min wage jobs with loads of experience and plenty of people will apply and even after short listing some by criteria they'll have plenty to interview.  So get out and actively find one.  Get a nice 1 pager cv printed out and go around the local shops or in town and ask to speak to the manager. If the manager/owner isn't available then ask for their name and when they are normally in. Next time ask for the manager by name and get talking to them to see if they've anything going atm or coming up.  My first job was the local shop doing papers, I just wandered in an asked, they handed me a bundle and that was me (13p a paper). After that I asked in a restaurant in town and became a kitchen porter over the summer. Then asked in a local shop and started stacking shelves and doing till for about 2 years until I left for uni. And even in uni 2 of 3 jobs I had was by wandering in asking for the right person, get talking and see where I could help out.  Don't just drop off cvs though, normally they go into a pile and are cleared out every now and again cos you don't really know how up to date it is anymore.  Get it to some senior enough and preferably in person.  A good tip is to get the owners name and when they're gonna be in and then come back and and casually ask to speak to X.  People sometimes assume you know them and are a bit less guarded. Used to use that on the phone too to get past secretaries and stuff. ""hey can I speak to john?"" passed to john, ""Hello there Mr Smith I'm calling because....""   Bypassing the gatekeeper.  After that it's just charming them into working out where you fit in. ""I'm keen to work here because it's walking distance, I know the store and area very well and it's always seemed like a good place to work when i've been in.""   landed a job with subway as a student this way, new to the city and had never eaten a subway before.  Good luck, keep trying and something will land."
northernireland,3dnjx3,bawbawbaw1,4,Fri Jul 17 19:27:47 2015 UTC,"great response. The part about just how fierce online job applications are really got me, had never really taken that into consideration, but you are certainly right. Gotta step up the game."
northernireland,3dnjx3,DodgyRodge,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:41:59 2015 UTC,"So get out and actively find one.   This.  I've got like 6/7 of my Jobs this way. Online your just another name, If you go around and hand it in then you can put a face to a CV. Much easier to get interviews!!   Also ask friends with jobs to ask their managers!"
northernireland,3dnjx3,kdohgeegee,2,Mon Jul 20 14:56:49 2015 UTC,"Good post.   Volunteering is a good way to get experience, but it won't pay bills. You'll get a good reference though. You can volunteer literally anywhere. Depending on your age, volunteering at say.. a homeless charity or something like that will get you more experience than you can put on your CV.   Go through the job description that they put up with the application - go through each bullet point and show that you can do this or have done this somewhere else. For example, team work is on practically every job description out there - when did you last work with other people to achieve something? Doesn't have to be job related and employers you're targetting will acknowledge this because its a low end position and they expect young people with no work exp to apply. Retail and catering jobs don't want aul people (>21), they cost more to pay and are more likely to get fed up and leave.   A lot of employers put up ""1 years experience"" so they don't get overloaded with applications, its about weeding out people who aren't suitable, it doesn't mean you can't apply. Its different if they ask for 2+ years experience. I've a mate whos a manager at a large clothing retail store and he gets about 4000 applications for each job - half go in the bin because they aren't signed, the rest are sorted to criteria but he will keep good applications that don't have experience but show some sort of intelligence and motivation."

northernireland,3dnjx3,ThyDocco,2,Fri Jul 17 21:32:48 2015 UTC,has it worked for you?
northernireland,3dnjx3,Grant_King,3,Fri Jul 17 22:00:57 2015 UTC,"They're right. Bullshitting in an interview is an art in itself though and its backfired on me a few times even though I can bullshit like a solicitor on crack. Fine line; don't come acoss as the next US president, don't come across as a lazy bastard that relies on management to make every small decision on your behalf."
northernireland,3dnjx3,ThyDocco,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:14:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've stayed in jobs long enough to learn the skills. Everyone bullshits on cv's and in interviews. Just don't go overboard like pretending you can speak different languages."
northernireland,3dnjx3,Grant_King,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:21:57 2015 UTC,"Yep. 19, trying to get a job. Everything I apply for I get turned down for. And of course most companies only let you apply once every 6 months so my options are getting smaller and smaller.  Tried to get into some '2d animation academy'. Got turned down for it as well of course."
northernireland,3dnjx3,ThyDocco,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:57:55 2015 UTC,There's a billion callcentres...
northernireland,3dnjx3,bawbawbaw1,2,Fri Jul 17 23:59:23 2015 UTC,"Call centres won't give you a worthwhile work experience to put on your CV unless you want to continue with sales and customer service jobs (in that case, call centres are actually pretty good to have for work exp). Every employer I've worked for since working in call centres has considered that experience completely irrelevant other than proving I can show up to work and stick with it for a while."

northernireland,3dmx1f,origpenguin,14,Fri Jul 17 15:55:45 2015 UTC,How can it be a hate crime when they're fighting amongst themselves?
northernireland,3dmx1f,cogra23,2,Fri Jul 17 19:10:25 2015 UTC,Because they hate each other.
northernireland,3dmx1f,skitzo1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:30:03 2015 UTC,You beat me to saying this!
northernireland,3dmx1f,Buckenboo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:53:07 2015 UTC,How do you know it is them fighting among themselves?
northernireland,3dmx1f,TheLeftFoot-of-Bobby,2,Sat Jul 18 10:23:58 2015 UTC,"It has been an ongoing feud over the past few years, there were pipe bombs involved the last time it kicked off."
northernireland,3dmx1f,cogra23,5,Sat Jul 18 10:31:22 2015 UTC,I thought the whole point of being a traveller was that you didn't live in a house
northernireland,3dmx1f,NigguhPleeez,3,Sat Jul 18 07:23:22 2015 UTC,They are an ethnic minority. It doesn't matter where they live; they're still travelers.
northernireland,3dmx1f,TheLeftFoot-of-Bobby,2,Sat Jul 18 10:23:40 2015 UTC,Travellers attacking travellers?
