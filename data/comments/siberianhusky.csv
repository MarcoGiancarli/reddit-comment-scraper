siberianhusky,3dwf1t,weiwanggm,2,Mon Jul 20 02:28:05 2015 UTC,"Oof, scary is right.  I can walk right up to mine and snatch her bone away and all she does is give a really sad ""okay"" look.  I can't imagine it being a good thing for a dog to act this possessive over a bone, toy, whatever when their owner is just talking to them."
siberianhusky,3dwf1t,Dreamscarred,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:37:57 2015 UTC,"Max is getting better now. I guess husky is more wild than other dog breeds, and this was his first a few bones as well. He is not crazy any more like before. Just want people aware of husky's wild behavior."

He's very similar to how your Max behaves with bones when he already has them.  If he's trying to steal it from the husky though, he just whines and woofs.  No where near bold enough to steal it from her."
siberianhusky,3dwf1t,spinwizard69,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:04:37 2015 UTC,It isn't like the dog was being aggressive here.   It was More like the dog expressing dissatisfaction with the stupidity of the owners teasing.     There is a huge difference between being vocal and being aggressive.  When I was little kid I had to feed the family dog which was actually a scary thing to do as the mutt was very aggressive when it came to food.  I see nothing in this video that even comes close to being an example of scary behavior.
siberianhusky,3dwf1t,Dreamscarred,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:43:49 2015 UTC,"Gotcha.  I had different experiences growing up, but thanks for the explanation.  My aunt had multiple labs who were all very much like this, but usually a bite would quickly follow.  Playing with frisbees or balls, they would talk like this and then snap if I tried to get it from them.  Though those were also the same dogs that each bit me on the face during different occasions just for laying on a couch. :/"

siberianhusky,3d2h5y,ElimAgate,2,Mon Jul 13 00:11:43 2015 UTC,"What are your favorite tools for running your dogs?   Disc brakes, and snow hooks.  Seriously though, if you're only buying for a few dogs I'd recommend http://www.manmat.cz/en for harnesses. The build quality and design is top-notch - I still can't get my local shop here in the Yukon to make a proper copy of their ""shorty"" distance harness. Manmat sell premade lines too, if you like, but you can build them yourself easily enough. Don't forget to buy a neck line.  I'd really suggest you run them first on trails, before adding the threat of traffic. Until you have a sense of how your dogs behave, can manage the lines, and until you can jump over your handlebars when necessary, paved streets are an unnecessary complication. There's not much of a learning curve, really, but especially when on a bike there are some real coordination issues that take a few outings to be comfortable with."

siberianhusky,3clcaj,30secs2Motherwell,4,Wed Jul 8 20:20:00 2015 UTC,"Trainer gave us a tip for human chewing that worked wonders.   If she bites your arm or hand, gently but firmly slide your arm/hand to the back of her mouth and say ""No biting!"" very firmly. If done correctly, this keeps them from closing their jaw, and is very uncomfortable without being painful.  As evidence, my 2 - year old husky doesn't bite people now unless you initiate 'hardcore playtime' and start full-on wrestling with him. If he does act like he's going to bite, he pretty much just sticks your hand in his mouth and looks at you; no teeth involved."
siberianhusky,3clcaj,GheistWalker,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:25:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this, I've read this suggestion before but it wasn't really explained properly, I'll give it a go."
siberianhusky,3clcaj,FishwUlteriorMotives,3,Thu Jul 9 08:35:34 2015 UTC,"When she chews on something she's not supposed to (you, furniture, etc...) replace that with an appropriate chew toy."
siberianhusky,3clcaj,UnidentifiedFlop,2,Wed Jul 8 20:54:14 2015 UTC,"Man I remember those days. Luna and I would wrestle and have epic battles until she drew first blood (she wins) and I just tired her out (I win)  I actually just put my hand on my huskies head when I tell her no and she doesn't listen. She wasn't a fan and still isn't but it taught her when it was ok to chew on me and when it wasn't. So try to find a word in conjunction with the hand on head to use so she knows what's up.  Now, if you are having an epic battle with her, I bite back and do slow motion karate chops...but that won't help you. Have fun with your huskie. They are the best and worth the struggle"
siberianhusky,3clcaj,Leftyloveshuskies,2,Wed Jul 8 22:45:11 2015 UTC,"Heavy training on sit, down, leave it and drop it.  Before she gets her meals and any treats she needs to lay down and be quiet.  For biting on you, find oil of cloves and put a little on your hands.  When she tries to nibble on you stick your hand in her mouth so she gets a good taste.  Oil of cloves tastes horrible and this stopped bitting for one of my Huskies quickly who was very mouthy"
siberianhusky,3cfc76,Janglespruce,3,Tue Jul 7 13:55:32 2015 UTC,Are you sure he didn't go to 'nam while you weren't looking?
siberianhusky,3cd8t3,Runs_With_Bears,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:28:01 2015 UTC,My husky will not catch for in his mouth. He will catch toys but he is so picky about his foods that he won't just catch them in his mouth.
siberianhusky,3bzexg,MochixMoon,3,Fri Jul 3 11:37:10 2015 UTC,In a somewhat nicer way.... You shouldn't be concerned unless they are eating too little/ too much. It is usually hard to say what their weight will be at this early. Don't stress just keep an eye out for inconsistencies in fecal matter and things like that just to be sure. Female huskies full grown should be at about 45-50 and males about 10-15 more. Your vet would most likely tell you if something is wrong though so you shouldn't stress. Best of luck with your pup!
siberianhusky,3bzexg,uhunteru,3,Fri Jul 3 13:35:58 2015 UTC,"That and they will vary some, like my 18month old male is 75lbs and he is not in any way describable as overweight.  I am sure there are some that run small."
siberianhusky,3bzexg,mr_faust,3,Fri Jul 3 13:50:06 2015 UTC,"If the AKC standard is anything to go by, they say males should weigh 45-60 and females 35-50. Just wanted to point out that smaller dogs than mentioned above are not unusual."
siberianhusky,3bzexg,360glitch,3,Fri Jul 3 14:24:03 2015 UTC,360glitch beat me to it. AKC standard for females is 35-50. Both of our females are in the lower end of that range and are very healthy. Our older male is closer to 50 and he's just tall and lanky. If he fleshes out any more he's gonna be a big boy. I wouldn't worry much if she's eating regularly and a decent amount. uhunteru explained all of that pretty well.
siberianhusky,3bzexg,rednektek69,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:36:43 2015 UTC,Huskies come in different sizes- I've seen/known one that weighed in the 30's and was the size of a small cattledog. Her daughter was even tinier! Dogs also have growth spurts and it can take a couple years before they fill out and grow into their frame. As long as you don't observe any health conditions that might indicate a larger issue. Also don't be tempted to overfeed your husky to help it bulk up!
siberianhusky,3bzexg,lizardfang,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:55:17 2015 UTC,"As long as she is eating her food, I wouldn't worry. My Husky was about that weight when she was 4 months as well. She's 6 months now and finally hitting 20lbs. Just enjoy them while they're young!"
siberianhusky,3bzexg,nexus4144,-7,Fri Jul 3 19:20:13 2015 UTC,"Does the dog eat regularly?    If so why are you obsessing over this.   You are as bad as the parent that stuffs a child with food to realize some sort of image that isn't appropriate for someone growing up.     In other words the worst thing you can do is to fatten somebody or some dog in this case, to make yourself happy."

siberianhusky,3bp2r1,Squidmaker,3,Wed Jul 1 00:13:54 2015 UTC,"My dog loves her deer antlers and water buffalo horn.  Her horn has lasted 5-6 months and she still chews it like it's a new toy.  Deer antlers can last just as long, but stay away from the split-type; they break up too easily."
siberianhusky,3bp2r1,here_to_upvote,2,Wed Jul 1 02:43:37 2015 UTC,I was talking to my vet about deer antlers. She said steer clear. She had a dog in a few weeks prior that splintered the antler and severed a major artery with it. The dog nearly died even with the owner present when it happened.
siberianhusky,3bp2r1,z_ide,3,Wed Jul 1 14:58:07 2015 UTC,"Keep trying different things. What keeps my dogs busy? Meaty marrow bones. Less bone, more sinew and marrow. Your local natural pet store will have them, and if not any farm can get you the goods.   Then I saw you have a Husky. So here's the real answer: you don't. You have two years. Two years of constant pestering. Then they calm down and, if they are like mine, they'll avoid you. Not ""avoid"" avoid (most of the time, god forbid I walk in a room where he's napping), but they'll kind of be content doing their own thing. But the first two years was just a constant explosion of ""PLAY WITH MEEEEE!"" 24/7. Husky puppies are dicks, but they turn into amazing dogs like a Grimm's fairy tale.   Alternately, get another dog. Yeah, I know, not a good idea, but a relevant one. We literally got my Husky a puppy at two years. Which is not to say we got a second dog casually, but two are easier than one. Now I just open the back door and they spend the day beating the shit out of each other (playfully) and I only have to go out there and rile them up enough to start the fight. I can go back inside and take a nap after that. They will go for hours, especially in the winter. It is summer now so he just wants to sleep on the tile and not move out of the range of the A/C, but he's going on five now so his energy level is much diminished. But he raised my second dog like she was his, like she belonged to him. They are thick as thieves and miserable without one another. A lone Husky is tough....a second dog really can help if you have the space, the inclination, and the yard."

siberianhusky,3bp2r1,Sterling_Archer87,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:18:28 2015 UTC,"So, I didn't see an age but hopefully by puppy you're talking over 12 months otherwise I'd be careful with the longer walks while her joints are growing. But in any case, teaching new tricks is always a great way to keep them busy at any age and reinforces hierarchy and value in toys or treats. Tugging/fetching? Make her work for it each time you're in control of the toy/treat. And they don't have to have your attention 24/7... And shouldn't. Get her used to crate training or being left to her own devices so there won't be a bunch of separation anxiety in the future."

They're stubborn, we've found that making ours sit and do tricks before she goes in or out or gets in the car helps build some basic obedience.  They also have a wicked prey drive. Be very cautious about exposure to small animals. Ours has caught opossum and stray cats that wandered into the yard. The neighborhood animals have learned to steer clear.  Also agree about having a companion being a plus. We don't crate our dogs, having each other helps a lot with separation anxiety.  Generally they're smart and goofy dogs. Very rewarding companions."

siberianhusky,3bb1dq,xAy3x,2,Sat Jun 27 15:29:52 2015 UTC,"Poor baby ): is he scared of thunderstorms? We've had a lot on our area recently and lucky mine does fine with all the booms and claps. Fireworks are a whole other story, though."
siberianhusky,3bb1dq,karex102,3,Sat Jun 27 23:30:43 2015 UTC,"No, I just wanted to see how many pillows I could put on him without him moving lol."
siberianhusky,3bbr2m,Misslalapomme,2,Sat Jun 27 18:27:21 2015 UTC,I want to get a cat but I don't know how my sibe will behave. How's it going for you?
siberianhusky,3bbr2m,boywonder1990,2,Sun Jun 28 06:33:34 2015 UTC,I had a cat and a Siberian husky once. I only have a sibe now. Be careful
siberianhusky,3b9zlw,DarthSideus,2,Sat Jun 27 05:08:57 2015 UTC,"My two get along,  but never cuddle.  These two are adorable."

siberianhusky,3b36b5,pikezh638,2,Thu Jun 25 16:22:25 2015 UTC,"You could change your routine and go in the mornings.  Alfred and I run four miles in the morning before I go to work a couple days a week. Yes. It means getting up early, but we both benefit from the cool temps, the lack of traffic and people (we run a newly paved path at the local state park).  Heat is not a major issue here, so we'll do an additional 2-3 mile walk when I get home. I don't think my dog would respond well to anything on his feet.  As your dog matures, the amount of exercise becomes extremely important. A daily two-mile walk is not enough exercise, in my experience.  Al is four and we log about 42 miles a week together. His behavior is amazing at this level of activity.  If you do decide to go with booties, please post a follow-up. I can't picture a husky willing to wear anything like that."
siberianhusky,3b36b5,AlfredsDad,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:45:29 2015 UTC,"Ruffwear has some booties and hasn't disappointed me at all with their quality - I don't have their booties, but I have harnesses and have loved them.  Honestly I'm in Texas and Luna hates the heat, so we run at 11pm-midnight.  She also has grass to run on, so I don't need boots for her.  I'll get some for when I go on long hikes with her though, but I've not done so since the trails near me are all flooded ($&%@ rain).  Also, Chewie is adorable :P"
siberianhusky,3b36b5,Azara1th,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:34:56 2015 UTC,"Oh wow those are expensive, of course quality = price I know. I was not expecting that. We are in Arkansas and it (as you probably call tell since you are in Texas) is insanely hot. It hasn't rained too much here recently, but I knew TX was flooded. Thanks for the suggestion! I will definitely look into this.   Thank you for the complement and suggestion!"
siberianhusky,3b36b5,Azara1th,2,Thu Jun 25 20:38:28 2015 UTC,"Not that bad... Would be worth it to me if they help protect her feet. Of course Luna is a pampered pup lol. Cheaper than a vet bill, at least."
siberianhusky,3b36b5,jps74,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:11:31 2015 UTC,"Of course :). We have a OneTigris Cotton Canvas Dog Pack that we put some frozen water in to help tire her out and keep her cool. It works really well for us. Hopefully we have an easy summer here and this won't be an issue, but if it gets 100F may have to go with this. Thanks again!"
siberianhusky,3b1pl2,Runs_With_Bears,2,Thu Jun 25 06:50:32 2015 UTC,our Huskies are the  same way.....accidentally rattle their harness and they're at the door waiting on ya
siberianhusky,3b1pl2,rednektek69,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:55:55 2015 UTC,"Not only at the door, but sprinting around in little compact circles panting in unison with every step of their paws!"
