Now I will say I was always on the edge ready to tip because my grandfather had always been a very big Paddy, like was on the local newspaper dressed in his garb being called the worlds biggest Leprechaun and our house was always shamrocks the whole thing all year round.

It’s a deeply personal song to me and to other people as well so talking about it too much will only ruin people’s own interpretations. It was one of the first songs I wrote where I never actually wrote it down. I wrote it in my head over the course of a month and that process removed a lot of the pressure of staring at a blank page which I used to do a lot. I played it to Kev and Joey in the back of a van on our first tour and we’ve been playing it ever since.'

My grandparents have passed; my parents are getting more open and better with communication.   I see what's in store for us in the next 15-30 years, and I think they do too. We make time to see each other or have dinner together every few weeks, my dad and I go to things like autoshows and my cousin's little league games; we used to go months with a text or two. My dad talks to me like I remember him talking to my uncles; I refrain from my thoughts on the GOP and he doesn't roll his eyes and ask me how much I ""blew"" on a bigger turbo or new rims.  I know he doesn't notice that I notice, but he's started to say things like ""love you"", and mention how my work makes him proud. I start to get that deep, frission feeling when I think about what my parents have sacrificed for me and how I need to be ready to sacrifice for them, and for the first time in my life I can see what it's going to be like when I can't call my mom for anything. There's going to be a time probably before I'm their age now when I won't hear their voices or feel their hugs. I just want so badly for them to understand how grateful I am (and I know that I'll only be discovering more of how much I owe them) and how it was worth it and I want to live up to that, and it only ""hurts"" more when I realize that my mom literally couldn't care because she would love me just as much if I had fucked everything up from day 1. I'm so lucky to have known and have actual unconditional love and all I can do is resolve to show it back and never take advantage of it or take it for granted ever again."

The OR was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. Then came the most guttural sobs one ever heard, the kind where you can feel the pain through sound. We all swallowed hard & went about our jobs as somberly & professionally as possible. The sound of that dad crying is a sound I'll never forget. Mom stayed with us for three days after, as she wouldn't eat, wouldn't speak.... The husband though, he crawled into that hospital bed next to his beloved wife, wrapped his arms around her, and held her every possible moment. He wiped her tears, kissed her forehead, and it was then that I knew that true love really does exist. They've gone on to have three more babies since then, all healthy.

I think most often of the tech who did our ultrasound that day and had to tell us our sweet baby didn't have a heartbeat any longer.  We were her first patients of the day and she seemed so chipper when we came in.  I can only imagine how the rest of her day went after that and how often she has to give that kind of news.

It's such a thankless job, and more often than not, people want instant answers & instant cures, and are so focused on the end result, they don't take the time to focus on all the in between stuffs.   Short backstory: We'd gone in at 12 weeks for the usual & everything was fine. Good strong fetal heart tones. At 16 weeks, I was starting to feel more movement, small kicks, and still with strong FHT's. Then I started getting sick. Morning sickness was an all day, never ending thing. Nothing helped. I was hospitalized for three days at one point for IV fluids d/t severe dehydration. Went in for a hospital follow up, no heart tones. My doctor, a good friend of mine, didn't have to say the words. I knew. She sent me over to have a Sono, and just like your tech, I was the first of the day. Her name was Ashley, and I'd worked with her years prior. She was so kind. She took a look, and her face dropped. She couldn't find the words that didn't need said. I mustered up a soft ""Noooo"", and completely fell apart. She hugged me.  We've since had our third child, another girl, and she's the apple of my eye. Oddly enough, she was my preemie too, born at 32 weeks.   Congratulations on your upcoming baby! You're in the home stretch, my friend. I wish you the absolute best!!

There are volunteer photographers on hand at hospitals who will photograph the stillborn child for the mother. She kept the photo in a small white frame sitting on the nightstand in the guest bedroom so that he could seem like a part of her life without having to be reminded of him every day. Occasionally a person would spend the night (myself included), ask who the baby is, and like a proud mother explain that she had a beautiful child who left too soon.  For ten years she lived in fear of history repeating itself until she got pregnant.  I visited her and her new baby and went into the guest bedroom to drop off my bag.

Not every failed/prevented pregnancy is the same.    Just like the death of an adult can have varying impact based on context.  The death of robin williams (to chose a recent example) has a different impact than the death of a serial killer.  The natural loss of an intentional pregnancy is different from the termination of an ectopic pregnancy that endangers the mother and would be virtually impossible to carry to term.

In Buddhism it is believed that children don't develop on a separate entity to their mother until after they are born and so their spirit gets stuck in 'limbo'.   Japanese Buddhists responded to this with Mizuko Kuyou whereby parents of unborn children buy a statue of the Japanese God of children Jiso. They dress them up in red bibs and hats and give offerings of food, drink, and sometimes toys. Prayers are said to the spirit child to help in their passing."

Frisson,3dmys7,pleasedothenerdful,5,Sat Jul 18 04:57:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks. My wife miscarried what would have been our third child this week. We'd only realized she was pregnant about three weeks earlier--just enough time to start coming up with potential names and to start planning how to reorganize our lives to make room for this totally unplanned, slightly daunting, blessing.  It was a little scary, as we're not in the best financial shape right now, and our relationship hasn't been that great of late, but our kids are the best things that have ever happened to us. It was impossible not to be excited about another.  Then she started spotting a week ago. She wasn't cramping, and google told us this was pretty common, so we only worried a little. At first.  We got her to the doctor all the same, but they couldn't find a baby or a heartbeat on ultrasound. Urine and blood tests showed she was definitely pregnant, though. That early, sometimes they just miss things on the ultrasound. We told ourselves.  We were wrong.  And now we won't need to figure out how to afford a bigger house, a bigger car, another mouth. Now we won't need to lose all that sleep. Now, all the discomfort of pregnancy, the pain, all the exhaustion of a new baby, the frustration of diapers and bottle warmers at 3am--you feel guilty just for having those thoughts--and all the joy, all we would have had together with this new life...now we won't.  So you paste on a false everything's fine smile for friends you hadn't even told you were pregnant. You don't even know how to bring up the subject, and the first time you try, you see their eyes light up at the word ""pregnant,"" so you hurry to cut off their congratulations and charge through, finishing the rollercoaster sentence you started. All the air goes out of the room. The light in their eyes dies, just as it did in yours.  Thanks for the picture of the statue. It's just right.

I had to break her heart all over again. The pain that a miscarriage can bring is immense, everyone wants to help but at the time it seems like everything they can say is just wrong somehow.

Frisson,3dmys7,MikeyDeez,13,Fri Jul 17 18:06:06 2015 UTC,"Not really in the case of a therapeutic abortion.  You're still left with a woman who's pregnancy was taken from her, and had to cut short the life of her child to preserve her own.

Frisson,3dmys7,QuintusVS,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:51:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, that happens, but were talking GENERALLY here, there are also women who have miscarriages and are relieved their child didn't survive.  Still, my point stands, it's two entirely different situations."
Frisson,3dmys7,FineBenign,6,Fri Jul 17 18:36:28 2015 UTC,"See, it's not ""entirely"" different if a significant number of women would have had the kid in different circumstances.  Different; yes.  But the statue reflecting the woman mourning the loss of a potential child probably fits with most abortions.  I wouldn't say that ""generally"" anyone is relieved that their kid didn't survive unless you have statistics to back it up.  Having to terminate a pregnancy because of economic reasons (for example, can only afford the two kids you have now) aren't ""relieved"" because the fetus is dead and they don't have a kid. They're ""relieved"" that their and their family's lives won't be derailed...doesn't mean they wouldn't have loved to have the kid under different circumstances.  Many women mourn the child they became pregnant with five or ten years early...they would love to give another chance to that fetus."
Frisson,3dmys7,Natetendo83,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:41:38 2015 UTC,"Nope, because with an abortion it is the mother's choice and she most likely didn't support the pregnancy 100% which is different than having a baby you very much want to have taken from you at birth."

If you put on glasses on my face, and I suddenly saw colors I'd never seen before, my reaction to begin with, would not have been ""oh these are nice. What? what?"" I think some of his reaction was motivated by the fact he felt that reaction was expected, since he was being filmed.  Idk how much of a difference those glasses could have been making, but there are no glasses I could put on your face that would make you see more colors, right? It's the same thing.  You just see colors differently than I do.   He may have been taken aback in the belief he was experience color as others do, but he was not seeing new colors. This isn't footage of a guy's reaction after his colorblindness was fixed.  Just like I can't show you a new color you've never seen by putting glasses on your face."
Frisson,3dioxx,ntropi,13,Fri Jul 17 01:31:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert on colorblindness or even on glasses, so this is mostly speculation. But from what I've read it seems like, at least in some cases of colorblindness, when the eyes look at something green, they see both green and brown, but the brain perceives the brown as the brighter or more important color and drowns out the green. Someone without colorblindness also sees both, but the brain perceives the green as the important color and ignores the brown. Both people's eyes are taking in the same light and delivering both colors to the brain, but the brain is choosing one over the other. I think of it like that silhouette image of the lamp in white and two people kissing in black, except you can't choose which one you see.  A lens that filters out that specific wavelength of brown would remove the possibility for a perception fault in the colorblind person. So in reality it wouldn't be showing you a new color, it would be showing you one less."
Frisson,3dioxx,h0uz3_,2,Fri Jul 17 02:56:56 2015 UTC,"Well, brown is made up of a mix of red, green and blue. These are the colors that do have certain wavelengths and brown would be a composition of something like 80% red, 60% green and 40% blue.  The eye only has receptors for these three colors, thats the reason why the majority of people with a color blindness have a problem with red vs. green, that means, green wins over red typically. Still, those people can distinguish a red from a green car.  And: color blindness is typically caused by a genetic defect in the Y-chromosome, therefore almost all colour blind people are male."
Frisson,3dioxx,h0uz3_,3,Fri Jul 17 10:47:48 2015 UTC,"You're correct in thinking that colorblindness is a sex-linked trait and that it occurs more often in males, but your reasoning is a bit off. It is actually caused by a genetic defect on the X-chromosome, not the Y. Since the defect is a recessive trait (meaning that if you have another ""working"" copy of the non-mutated allele, or gene, then you will not experience the effect of that mutated allele), men will more often suffer from it since they only have one X chromosome (genetically, males are XY whereas females are XX). In order for females to suffer sex-linked colorblindness, they would have to inherit two copies of the mutated allele compared to a male only needing one copy.  The Y chromosome is actually so small that it barely codes for anything outside of a testes- determining region. I think there was a study a while back that showed it also coded for ear hair, but don't quote me on that one."

Frisson,3dioxx,xDrSchnugglesx,9,Sat Jul 18 02:41:13 2015 UTC,"I am myopic and in the beginning I was in total denial that it was so bad, and when I got my first pair of glasses I was basically floored. I had to slowly walk around and look at everything. I spent an hour just staring at trees and amazed I could see leaves, like individual leaves, all of them. I could see faces from the distance, and numbers, and ads. It was like someone amped the information level 1000%, it was overwhelming. My dog shocked me because I could see his eyes clearly defined and not as blurry pits of darker brown. I probably said ""holy shit"" a couple hundred times that day.  Don't underestimate how good your brain is at getting you used to what you can, and telling you that's pretty much it."
Frisson,3dioxx,Akoustyk,-2,Fri Jul 17 06:49:54 2015 UTC,"Ya. well technically, it's never just it. We could also have sonar, or magnetic field vision, or heat vision, or any other extra new sense, that is a completely different sensation than we could ever imagine, and any human could see more colors, but all of us think ""that's it"""
Frisson,3dioxx,xDrSchnugglesx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:52:41 2015 UTC,"Because that is it for the basic human. Humans have a default model that can see, hear, taste, feel and smell particular stimuli. We physically cannot sense things that our sense organs are not designed to sense.  In the most basic of terms, you are defective. Your sense of color vision is broken, and these glasses fix it so that you are now a default person. We could maybe invent things that do let us sense things that we normally couldn't, but that has never been done and would only add onto the default humans perception. We may be able to get there, but then we would move beyond basic human."
Frisson,3dioxx,TosieRose,-1,Fri Jul 17 22:30:21 2015 UTC,"You are not understanding. Color doesn't exist. It is a fabrication of your mind. My perception of color is different from yours. It is not like other humans. That doesn't mean it is broken, nor defective. It is not that I am not able to see the color that the world actually is.   It is just I see differently than most people. You could call that defective, just because it is the norm, but then being a genius is a defect also. Or anything that doesn't fit into the norm.   These glasses can't possibly work. Can I put glasses on your face that let you see new colors? No. And that would be a fucking ridiculous thing to think. But for some reason. You are buying this story that these glasses fix colorblindness, when you don't even understand how they work.  It is not possible. It's just not possible. It would violate the laws of physics. Just like putting glasses on your face let you see new colors you've never seen before. They can't do that. It's the same thing. It makes no difference if my color scheme is the same as the majority or not. The physics of how the glasses can work is essentially the same."
Frisson,3dioxx,xDrSchnugglesx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:59:36 2015 UTC,"If color (external stimuli interpreted by our body) is a fabrication of our mind, literally everything any person has ever seen, heard, smelled, touched or tasted is a fabrication of the mind. That argument is absolutely absurd.  You have a defect because your brain and eyes cannot register the same things as everyone else can. You cannot find the numbers easily in those colored dot colorblind tests. You have a lack of ability. Being a genius is not a defect unless you are also Aspergers or on the autism spectrum, which happens of course. This is because there is nothing physically wrong with the body's functioning, unlike colorblindness.  You aren't understanding at all. You can't put glasses on me to see new colors because I already see them all, except rare few like the people with 4 cones can. That is also a defect, but a positive one. It's a mutation. But, I can put glasses on you that filter out a color allowing your brain to view the wavelengths differently than normal, which is how they work. Unless you actually lack the cones needed to detect the colors, you'd be able to see colors that you have never seen before. It will allow your brain to view wavelengths differently. It seems like you think I'm saying the glasses change the actual wavelengths, which is ridiculous.   Also, the fact that you seem to think you know better than the people who probably spent their entire lives developing this, and the people who actually have first hand accounts of using it, is silly. If they didn't work, why would this guy be having such a reaction to purple and green specifically? Do you think he's faking?"

That argument is absolutely absurd.   That is correct, and not absurd.    You have a defect because your brain and eyes cannot register the same things as everyone else can.   All you know about me is that I fall under the category of colorblind, and that statement is false.   If everyone saw like I do, then we would consider YOU colorblind.    You cannot find the numbers easily in those colored dot colorblind tests.   I see numbers sometimes when you do not. You are not very educated on this subject.    You have a lack of ability.   No, I have a different visual perception. It is not a lack of anything.    This is because there is nothing physically wrong with the body's functioning, unlike colorblindness.   There is nothing physically ""wrong"" with my vision. It is just not like everyone else's.   You aren't understanding at all. You can't put glasses on me to see new colors because I already see them all.   No. You don't. There isn't an all to see. Human beings evolved sensors that sense within certain wavelengths of electro magnetic radiation, and ascribes to those wavelengths color, and your system does so in teh same fashion as the majority, whereas mine does not.   Your eyes aren't letting you see all the colors that exist. It is creating them. It could create another, in theory.    That is also a defect, but a positive one.   LOL. You're so fucking stupid. How is how I see not positive? you fucking moron. You're an idiot that's negative for you lol. What a dumbass you are.   But, I can put glasses on you that filter out a color allowing your brain to view the wavelengths differently than normal, which is how they work.   Oh ya? you fucking idiot? They work to let me see more color by filtering OUT color. Holy shit. You should take about an hour thinking about the dumb shit you want to say, before typing it out.   It seems like you think I'm saying the glasses change the actual wavelengths, which is ridiculous.   First of all, dumbass, that's all they can change, is filter out wavelengths. It can't change your eyes, so obviously if the wavelengths of light changing, second of all I never said they magically transform a wavelength into some new one to get a new color. All of that happens in the mind.   I may have weak cones or something like that, I'm not exactly sure with my version, but I could be colorblind for other reasons also. but all you could do is weaken the others to get a different balance, by using filters. You can boost my cones and increase saturation to obtain new colors.   Idk why I have to keep telling you the same shit.   Also, the fact that you seem to think you know better than the people who probably spent their entire lives developing this, and the people who actually have first hand accounts of using it, is silly.   The people making this want money, and there are plenty of dumbasses like you that buy the concept and would buy it.    If they didn't work, why would this guy be having such a reaction to purple and green specifically? Do you think he's faking?   Yes, he is definitely faking, exactly. He is doing an emperor's new clothes/conformity/peer pressure thing. It's like a placebo. He knows that reaction is expected of him, and at first when he puts them on, he didn't know that, then he realized it, and it took off. Then he got tired of it, and asked him to turn the camera off.   You see things like that all the time. It is common with human beings. Hyptnotism is another example.   You are fucking dumb, and I will not waste any more time trying to explain things to not just an idiot of your magnitude, but more importantly, a jerk of your magnitude. So, I won't be reading your comment reply, and therefore will not respond to it.   Maybe you will be able to buy a hat that can make you smarter or something. I'll look out for one for you."

It's all subdued whites and creams, there are virtually no real colors right around him when he first puts them on. When he starts seeing colors, that's when he begins to react.  Just look at him see the purple. That is completely genuine."
Frisson,3dioxx,Akoustyk,-5,Fri Jul 17 06:20:08 2015 UTC,"Ya, but he still should have noticed. Well, I think there is some placebo affect, where he believes it is genuine, and it sort of is a genuine reaction, but if he found those glasses, and nobody was filming and he saw the purple thing, not knowing they were colorblind glasses, he would have thought ""wow that purple thing looks pretty cool in these."" And not ""OMG! that's purple? that's what purple looks like?"""
Frisson,3dioxx,Avatar_Yung-Thug,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:54:48 2015 UTC,"Well duh. If no one was around he wouldn't have had much of a reaction. That's intro to psychology.

Frisson,3dioxx,diredesire,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:01:13 2015 UTC,"What? You'd absolutely see colors you've never seen before. That's the whole point. You're colorblind so you've never seen colors the way I see them. These glasses effectively make you see a color you've not only never seen before, but that you've never seen present in anything before. You may not be able to see green, but you have your own version. These glasses would help you see my version of green.   I'm pretty sure the whole idea is that they are experiencing a new color. I would flip the fuck out if I saw a new color, but the only way that could happen is if I saw a color no human has ever seen."
Frisson,3dioxx,BookEmDan,0,Fri Jul 17 22:22:31 2015 UTC,"You are mistaken. I might see colors no human has ever seen, for all you know. The brain creates color. It is not possible for the glasses to create new colors. Glasses can only filter color.   There is no way he is seeing a brand new color. It is exactly the same whether you give him glasses to see a new color, or whether I give you glasses to see a new color. It's just as impossible.   Your eyes are not letting you see the colors that exist in the world. They are detecting wavelengths of light, and then creating color to attach to them.   My colors are different than yours. We know that. The idea that putting glasses on my face that will let me see new ones is ridiculous.  If your version of green is anything more than a less yellowy or more blue, or even more red version of green, or less, then there is no way I could ever see your version of green.   There are lots of different colorblind, and lots of reasons for colorblind."

Frisson,3dioxx,ratbaby,13,Thu Jul 16 21:40:40 2015 UTC,"Human eyes have different kinds of light receptors (rods and cones). In people with certain types of color-blindness, the sensitivities of these three cones are not as sharp in someone with ""normal"" vision. Basically, the sensitivities overlap at certain areas causing their brains to muddy up the perception of these specific colors. What these glasses do is notch out part of the color spectrum where the three cone cell types overlap most strongly. This effectively causes all the other colors in the spectrum to ""pop"" and increases contrast between them in someone with colorblindness. In a person with ""normal"" vision, they would actually dull certain wavelengths of color.   Here's a link to the company's website where they have cool little pictures that can probably explain it better than some stranger on the internet can."
Frisson,3dioxx,adrian_elliot,3,Thu Jul 16 21:51:52 2015 UTC,Tl;dr these glasses help the colorblind differentiate color that they couldn't before.  Actually seeing color would require a pigment/neurological difference.   (i believe there have been gene therapy in monkeys where they have done this)

Frisson,3daed0,tremens,6,Wed Jul 15 13:50:00 2015 UTC,"So essentially, we started discovering a bunch of new bodies in the solar system, and people started asking ""Hey, are these things we're discovering planets?""  And everyone realized that ""uhhh, we don't really have a solid definition of what a planet is, so ummmm.... maybe"" and so the IAU sat down to write a definition.  Well, it turns out, that you essentially have two options, define a planet in such a way that that there are 8 planets, not including pluto, or define planets in such a way that pluto is included, but possibly up to 200 other solar system bodies would be planets too.  After a lot of debate, the IAU formalized the definition so that pluto was not included as a planet, and coined the term ""dwarf planet"" to describe solar system objects like pluto."

Her music has changed a lot since I knew her personally, and she does excellent work in the studio now. However, I still prefer her music as I knew it originally - her talents in their rawest form, just the piano and her - and I miss the days when my friends and I would eavesdrop on her in the practice rooms writing her first songs.

Why would Atlantis not be able to return and need rescuing?   Edit: I looked it up myself.   Because STS-125 is not flying to the ISS, its crew does not have the added protection of taking safe haven on the station should Atlantis be damaged during flight. To offset that risk, NASA decided to ready a second shuttle on the second pad as a rescue ship, to launch as needed.   Also:   That there are two shuttles on two pads, visible or not, is in itself rare, occurring only 18 times over the past three decades.    Source article"

Therefore, NASA prepped the Shuttle Endeavour and developed a shuttle-to-shuttle emergency in-orbit rescue docking procedure to transport crew from the Atlantis to the Endeavour.

Had they spun too long they could have no only lost consciousness, but died from the gravity induced by spin. And the fact that if they hadn't saved the ship, they would've most likely died as well.

Frisson,3crob5,Zebramouse,3,Fri Jul 10 17:07:53 2015 UTC,"Ah, the debate rages on. The question of whether he was a irresponsible, selfish piece of shit, or a kid with the spirit of adventure is why the book got written in the first place. Krakauer wrote the original article and found that it sparked this huge debate, so he explored the question further, writing the book. If I'm honest, I'd have to admit that there were many, many opportunities for my younger self to have gotten himself killed in ways that would have had people say ""what a reckless idiot who should have thought about how getting himself killed would affect his mother"". Now, I'm a boring guy with a 9-5 who is glad he got to have some adventurers and see things. I have no doubt Chris would have turned out the same if he could have crossed the river.

Roy is one of the guys who takes him part of his way there, who tells Christopher about how he lost his family in an accident. They get along well for a few months, but Christopher goes on his way, and after Roy gives Christopher a bunch of old hunting/camping gear, this happens."

He tried to talk him out of the excursion, and even offered to drive him to Anchorage for more and better supplies, but McCandless demurred and set off on his own. He was never seen alive again by anyone, at least according to his journal."

We don't know. But I expect it was hard no matter what.  He did everything he could, and I'm sure he knows that, and also knows that if it wasn't him, it would have been someone else. I doubt he feels personal blame. But finding out four of five months later that that kid you'd dropped off and forgotten about was found dead, and realising you were the last person to see him, that has to hit hard for anyone, no matter who you are."
Frisson,3crob5,concretebox,2,Sat Jul 11 14:22:34 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you. Did he ever give an interview about it? I wanna know how hard he pushed for him to stay. Surely he tried to make Chris reconsider or at least convey to him that living off the reservation is next to impossible with the gear he had (or lack thereof). His saving grace was the magic bus and he still didn't even manage! Jim must have known. Maybe he thought chris almost wanted to live and die out there, and impeding his desires would have been wrong to him."

From Wiki:   Fastball front man Tony Scalzo came up with the idea for the song after reading journalistic articles which described the disappearance of an elderly married couple, Lela and Raymond Howard from Salado, Texas, who left home in June 1997 to attend the Pioneer Day festival at nearby Temple, Texas, despite Lela's Alzheimers and Raymond recently recovering from brain surgery. They were discovered two weeks later, dead, at the bottom of a ravine near Hot Springs, Arkansas, hundreds of miles off their intended route.[3][4]  About the song, Scalzo said that ""It's a romanticized take on what happened"" - he ""pictured them taking off to have fun, like they did when they first met."""
