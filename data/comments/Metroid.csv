Metroid,3e3dsq,SheeEttin,19,Tue Jul 21 18:01:36 2015 UTC,So basically this is nothing new.
Metroid,3e3dsq,Ucatsuton,15,Tue Jul 21 18:11:31 2015 UTC,So the story around Basin and Dark Samus...   What is basin? Is that just a bad translation? Phazon would fit there
Metroid,3e3dsq,Father_Brain,9,Tue Jul 21 18:20:21 2015 UTC,It's a bad translation accompanied by Games Journalism.
Metroid,3e3dsq,KingBroly,4,Tue Jul 21 19:53:11 2015 UTC,Only explanation I can think of.
Metroid,3e3dsq,joecb91,7,Tue Jul 21 19:55:59 2015 UTC,"I might be out of the loop here, but I saw ""future Metroid Prime"" and I'm already much less pessimistic about Federation Force, though what I've heard about the animation style still has me a bit weary... especially if that would influence a hypothetical future Prime game.    At the very least, this tells us that there IS a main series Metroid game at least semi planned, AND it's looking to be in the Prime continuity, which will hopefully retain the First Person gameplay of the Trilogy.    For me at least, that's really good news compared to the last Metroid news I saw, which was simply about FF."
Metroid,3e3dsq,Xero_K,3,Tue Jul 21 18:22:36 2015 UTC,"Tanabe confirmed last month that Federation Force is meant to flesh out the role of the Galactic Federation in the Metroid universe and potentially explain why Sylux hates them so much.  FF, along with MP3's best ending, will set the stage for the next game involving Samus.    IIRC, those were all thoughts of his, but nothing is set in stone.  Edit:  He also said that he did not consider FF to be a spin off.  It's a canon, main series game, just without Samus."
Metroid,3e3dsq,SecretToEverybody,6,Tue Jul 21 20:37:57 2015 UTC,"Which is a cool idea, I've always wanted to know more about the GF and play as a squad of GF troopers, but man it looks terrible. Why not give us the brilliant looking troopers from Corruption? Silliness."
Metroid,3e3dsq,Anggul,3,Tue Jul 21 22:08:36 2015 UTC,"Tanabe also answered that question, actually.  He said it was due to the small screens of the 3DS.  He said that slender characters were harder to see, so they made them bigger, which somehow led to that chibi-ish design.  I'm not saying I agree or disagree with that, only that he said it."
Metroid,3e3dsq,SecretToEverybody,3,Tue Jul 21 22:12:54 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, I do think that changing up the gameplay is the right way to go with this game. If they kept the FPS style, and meshed that with Multiplayer elements with the Federation, I think that'd edge pretty close to a lot of FPSs like Halo (it's already got some similarities). If they want to explore a different part of the Metroid universe, bringing in some unique gameplay sounds like the right approach.    That said, I hope that when the Prime universe is explored through Samus again, that they return to the Trilogy style.    Sure, another Prime game like those we know and love isn't by any means set in stone, but it's great to see that someone there seems to be moving in that direction. Even a small thing like this means a lot when we've been waiting for some kind of word about a new Metroid game (centered on Samus), and a Prime one at that."

Metroid,3e3dsq,FriendFrog,6,Tue Jul 21 18:48:28 2015 UTC,"Dark Samus wasn't exactly interesting.   Hold up, lemme stop you there. Did you play the games? Dark Samus is one of the most interesting villauns created.    First you gotta know how Phaaze works. It sends off pods of Phazon into other planets. Just as a virus injects its proteins into a host cell, the Leviathan infects the host planet, feeding off its natural resources and growing.  When it matures it infects the whole planet and changes it into a new Phaaze. The process then continues.  This is a planet that acts like a virus. Not only that, but a parasitic one.    Dark Samus is able to carry on its programming to infect worlds and is able to do so. This shit is beyond cool, okay? This fucker is a giant parasite that spread through the galaxy on a planetary scale.    This beast could infect any biological organism and corrupt it to make them work for it. Samus only barely managed to beat it by overloading it with more Phazon.  Don't give me that ""It's not interesting, "" shit."
Metroid,3e3dsq,neoslith,2,Tue Jul 21 20:41:50 2015 UTC,"The X did it first.  Also, wasn't most of that retconned? I was under the impression that originally Metroid Prime was just a big-ass mutated metroid from all the phazon that was in the meteorite."
Metroid,3e3dsq,SheeEttin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:53:37 2015 UTC,"It's still unclear as to why The Metroid Prime could spawn Metroids. The Chozo sealed off the impact crater as to halt the infection of the planet and bide time until it could be destroyed.  Canonically, sure the X did it first, but the Metroids defeated the X Parasite.   Also, X only infected SR388. Phaaze was infecting whole planets."
Metroid,3e3dsq,neoslith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:19:37 2015 UTC,"I thought the X took place long after Metroid Prime. That is, that Fusion was the ""last"" game in the series timeline wise."
Metroid,3e3dsq,LifeWulf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:21:37 2015 UTC,The X Parasite originally inhabited SR388. The Metroids were created by the Chozo to eradicate them (an event that predates any game). Samus' defeat and exterimnation of the Metroids (in Metroid II) allowed the X Parasite to return.

It isn't even recurring enough to be as iconic to the series as Ridley, Mother Brain or even Kraid. It's a lamer version of the alien from John Carpenter's The Thing & like SheeEttin said the X did it better, which is to say it was basically the same thing."
Metroid,3e3dsq,FriendFrog,3,Tue Jul 21 21:11:58 2015 UTC,"It may not be memorable to you, but I will definitely never forget Dark Samus. The X-Parasite was akin to The Thing as it could take on different forms.  Dark Samus could corrupt life forms, not become them. Not really the same.   X-Parasite was small time compared to Dark Samus. It had to rely on others as a mode of locomotion. It couldn't get from planet to planet without a host or means of transport.  Dark Samus is able to get around on her own. It's not just a parasite, it's a virus. It's not living or dead. It just is. It is created to infect and destroy."

Metroid,3e0z3u,TheBlackCat13,5,Tue Jul 21 03:40:48 2015 UTC,"Super Metroid is the standard by which all other games in the series (in fact all metroidvanias) are judged.  You can't really understand the Metroid series, and what they were trying to achieve with the other games, until you beat Super Metroid.  Further, Zero Mission and Fusion (and the Prime games) both reference Super Metroid extensively.    Further, the Prime games are largely self-contained.  They don't really have an impact on the rest of the Metroid series continuity.  On the other hand, Super directly sets up the events of both Other M and Fusion (both of which, at the time they were made, were intended as direct sequels to Super).    So I would strongly suggest you choose Super first.  Then I would play through Zero Mission and Fusion again, since you there will be a lot of things in those games that you missed or didn't understand having not played Super first.  Only then would I get into the Prime trilogy.  The Prime games are incredible games, but I think you will appreciate them much more if you have already played Super."

The gameplay is great, but I find that the soundfonts and graphical quality of the SNES makes the game a bit aged, imo. It is the gold standard by which all other Metroid games are judged though, and definitely the best 2D game.  The trilogy is amazing. MP1 does look last gen in terms of the texture quality and models used, however the great thing is that the art style is so brilliant that it's still beautiful."
Metroid,3e0z3u,Tankmin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:05:42 2015 UTC,"If you won't have money for other games for a while, go trilogy. The first nailed graphics, immersion, exploration, and the game play was pretty solid. Prime 2 imo sacrificed some of the graphical quality and immersion for better gameplay (ie more challenging combat) and exploration. Some of the new gameplay elements were flawed, but it's still a great game. Prime 3 is a lot more linear, and a MAJOR gameplay element (trying to avoid spoilers, but it was only in prime 3) wasn't balanced very well, at least for a decent amount of the fights. For example, I used the newer addition to samus' suit conservatively in a boss fight and had a ton of fun due to the challenge, then I died. I tried again, that time using it as much as possible and the boss could barely move throughout the fight, and I killed it in less than a minute with almost full health. Prime 3 did however add a decent story and I remember some parts were challenging. It was still worth playing. You can't go wrong with super either, very different game from the primes, but if you loved ZM and Fusion you will enjoy SM too."

Metroid,3dwxoy,BoogKnight,10,Mon Jul 20 08:40:22 2015 UTC,The whole game since you land on Tallon IV is a hallucinogenic trip. There never were any Metroids. Phazon didn't exist on the planet. The Chozo ghosts were hallucinations. Most of the creatures were far less menacing sober. Even the fight with Meta Ridley was a hallucination. He escaped and only shows up in Prime 3.  Samus blew up an ancient abandoned Chozo shrine because she was tripping balls. Probably why they didn't count the Prime series as cannon....
Metroid,3dwxoy,DaPurpleHippo,7,Mon Jul 20 18:05:09 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't they count it as canon?

Metroid,3dwxoy,Ucatsuton,2,Tue Jul 21 11:55:30 2015 UTC,Im pretty sure it is still considered canon. Isnt it set chronologically between Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion?
Metroid,3dwxoy,Just_Another_Toker,6,Tue Jul 21 02:16:47 2015 UTC,"So where do you divide things Samus experienced during the game between what's real and what's hallucinogenic? The last gun you get in the game is powered by phazon, so if it's possible for Samus to be touching something that's actually an illusion what if anything do you think is real in the game?   You probably think the Chozo ghosts are hallucinations because you are living in our cosmos. Maybe physical laws are different in their cosmos allowing ghosts to exist.    Was the appearance of Meta Ridley on Frigate Orpheon also an illusion? And what committee decided that the Prime series isn't cannon?"

Metroid,3dz5t5,cartermademe,11,Mon Jul 20 18:41:02 2015 UTC,"I think Nintendo is playing their cards smart with this game (or at least trying to). It's been stated before that Nintendo looks at core gameplay elements before the aesthetics or even the IP. Right now they're looking at popular game categories and finding the best match from their vast catalog of characters. The core gameplay of E-Sports and Sci-Fi shooters have been taken from the Nintendo approach - made accessible through aesthetic and platform - which is how we arrive at Federation Force. If all works as planned, this semi-dormant IP (with the exception of cameos here and there) will find a larger base of fans for potential future games. Is it the puzzle filled action adventure game old fans were looking for? No. That ideal game, at least at this point in time, would not sell. While it would greatly please current fans, it wouldn't leave a lot of financially viable ways to move forward with the series. Nintendo knows they need to branch out with this title, get some fresh faces interested in the Metroid name, keep the community interested and engaged. Best case scenario, we get Metroid Prime 4 with a strong multiplayer mode and community to follow. Put that unused script for Metroid Dread to use as a ""secondary"" release to the main title. Utilize what's already there and make the series a system seller - like it should be. Worst case scenario, we get a couple more titles until the series dies quietly, leaving behind some of the most memorable and well crafted experiences in gaming.

Metroid,3dz5t5,jsrd,9,Tue Jul 21 22:24:43 2015 UTC,"Tanabe is seriously starting to annoy me. He seems really out of touch with fans and he keeps repeating the same easy answers when asked the tough questions. What I find especially frustrating is how he describes the inspiration for the game:   I haven’t seen anything that was focusing on the Galactic Federation against the Space Pirates so it’s sort of that balance. So that’s one of the things I thought and felt like the fans were curious about.   That's the plot of MP3. The plot of that game from start to finish is a conflict between the Federation and the space pirates. Is he not familiar with the plot of the most recent game in the series that he produces? It should be obvious that fans are not at all curious about the story.   ...I also understand that [in] first person shooting games, there are different levels of game players. Some of them are very good; they’re very advanced, and some of them are not so good at it. So I wanted to have a mode where people can all play together on the same reign basically.   So blast ball is a response to a non-issue. Metroid Prime Hunters and Splatoon are fun for all skill levels and they don't require a separate game mode with a giant target. If different skill levels are a concern, how about you actually work on the main game so that it's playable by all skill levels instead of devoting time and resources to a completely separate game mode?  From what I can gather, this game is a poor concept that's been implemented poorly."

I hope he's right..."
Metroid,3dz5t5,PityUpvote,0,Tue Jul 21 11:34:30 2015 UTC,"This article made me grit my teeth at times. The first paragraph alone is not exactly true, they make it seem like it's a fantastic new experience and we should be excited and curious about it, when in reality most people stopped caring about the game a while ago. The absence of Samus after all these years is depressing, the chibi style of the game totally out of place in the Metroid series...  I would have been okay with a side game focusing on the federation, or playing as another character as Samus, but not after Other M. You could compare this situation to Halo 3 ODST, but that game didn't throw the series art direction out of the window, came between Halo 3 and Reach, and ended up being fairly good and true to its franchise."

Metroid,3dz5t5,Commander034,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:23:34 2015 UTC,"Because one character, setting,or any other factor doesn't make an entire series. Mario doesn't always star Mario, Zelda doesn't always have Zelda, Fire Emblem changes every single game, and Kirby doesn't always suck up enemies. Metroid doesn't need Samus to be Metroid."
Metroid,3dz5t5,0megaRidley,5,Mon Jul 20 21:52:46 2015 UTC,"While you do make a good point, Metroid doesn't really have any other characters than Samus herself, and she's been present as the MC in every game. You might mention the other Hunters from Metroid prime Hunters, but they weren't fleshed out enough to make them interesting as a MC. The prime 3 bounty hunters were better but they're all gone, and forget about Anthony Higgs, he's too generic to be a main character."
Metroid,3dz5t5,Commander034,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:17:41 2015 UTC,"Which is all the more reason to explore other characters by placing them in the spotlight of other games. If you view everything from the eyes of lonely samus, then nothing is fleshed out. A marine of the Galactic Federation would have to deal with the inner workings of the GF every time they do anything important and thus provides a new insight that Samus can't provide in the same way.  Some of the missions are going to be colonization, others will be skirmishes with the space pirates, others are going to be infiltration or reconnaissance. The Marines of the GF also allow for the politics between the GF and the Space Pirates to actually be explained instead of having the Pirates be bad because they are bad. Even the space pirate bosses come off as nothing more than mindless monsters in Metroid but the perspective of the GF could provide them with much needed fleshing out.  Samus is a shitty character to do any of that type of exposition since she only works alone and only shoots everything on sight.  Of all the complaints about Federation Force, not having Samus is the dumbest one there is."
Metroid,3dz5t5,0megaRidley,3,Mon Jul 20 23:23:38 2015 UTC,"The problem is : the whole gameplay is based upon Samus' power suit and her ability to get upgrades and ""evolve"". I don't really mind her being there or not (I think they actually confirmed she'd show up one way or another), but without Samus, you won't have the morph ball, the tunnel puzzles, the fast switching between beams (Anthony's super slow Plasma Cannon is proof that even the federation isn't advanced enough to mimic Chozo tech), etc...  Let's say you could remove Samus but keep those gameplay elements, okay, it could still be a Metroid game. But in the other case, removing one means also removing the other one, and if you remove both Samus and the upgrades, can the game still be called Metroid ? What would be left are the music, the graphics and the story, and those are not enough to make a great Metroid game, a series known for its gameplay before anything else."
Metroid,3dz5t5,Commander034,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:47:35 2015 UTC,"The problem is : the whole gameplay is based upon Samus' power suit and her ability to get upgrades and ""evolve"".   No it isn't that at all. Growing stronger is the main aspect of RPGs, not adventure games like Metroid. Metroid is about its atmosphere and exploring new areas. When you get a new power you don't just kill everything, you get new places to explore and that is the main draw.   but without Samus, you won't have the morph ball, the tunnel puzzles, the fast switching between beams   You don't need Samus or her powers to have puzzles and exploration. In fact having Samus and her same specific set of powers limits the design. Why does there always have to be morphball shit? Why does there always have to be super missiles? There is so much stupid shit in Metroid that didn't really need to be kept and doesn't have to keep being used in the same way.  Having someone without all those powers as the protag forces the devs to design new puzzles and environments based on their differentiated abilities and strengths. There are many Metroidvania games and all of them work differently, so why can't a 20 year old series experiment in the genre it created, while everyone else experiments with it?   Let's say you could remove Samus but keep those gameplay elements, okay, it could still be a Metroid game. But in the other case, removing one means also removing the other one, and if you remove both Samus and the upgrades, can the game still be called Metroid ? What would be left are the music, the graphics and the story, and those are not enough to make a great Metroid game, a series known for its gameplay before anything else.   You literally didn't say anything other than tunnel puzzles as an element. I don't think any particular type of level design other than exploration is part of the main aspects of Metroid.  Why are Metroid fans so against change, when literally every other Franchise in Nintendo has changed a lot throughout the years? Both the Wario series and Yoshi series started as Mario games that didn't star Mario and had very different mechanics. Each Zelda game has some big change that makes it feel unique and different. Metroid games feel very samey with a few very good ones. It isn't a surprise the series hasn't sold well since there hasn't been anything new with it since the first Prime. You always do the same shit in each Metroid. How do people like you find doing the same shit over and over enjoyable?"

You and I both know where the conversation is headed when you end your message with something like this. I am not interested in debating with you anymore since I am clearly perceived as someone who doesn't like change (when my favorite game in the franchise is Metroid prime, the game that actually had the balls to change something), and so be it.

Metroid,3dz5t5,Shotokanguy,3,Tue Jul 21 15:58:25 2015 UTC,You've got some gall to claim Metroid is not largely based around exploration...through upgrading Samus' suit with abilities that give you access to new areas.
Metroid,3dz5t5,Squ3akyN1nja,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:51:19 2015 UTC,"He said ...   Metroid is about its atmosphere and exploring new areas.   You can still have a different protagonist unlocking new abilities to open up new exciting areas to explore.    To re-iterate what I think u/Commander034 is trying to say; Samus doesn't ""get stronger"" she ""unlocks abilities and weapon ubgrades"" collected along the way. Her base damage never increases, her Energy (hit points) never increase based on an EXP point based system al-la RPG element. These upgrades are all collectible items you get as rewards for exploration. Items that you can choose to collect or choose to miss entirely.  Most RPG's dont allow you not level up, but in Metroid fusion you can beat the game only using Data Downloads and Core X upgrades. You can even miss ""Bob the missle tank"" using a very intricate frame perfect shinespark.  I agree with u/Commander034 you don't NEED Samus for a Metroid game.  Conserning MP:FF ... Its only the art style that I have a problem with..."
Metroid,3dz5t5,Shotokanguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:11:46 2015 UTC,"At the moment, sure, you could replace Samus with someone else that has some kind of modular equipment with multiple upgrades and abilities. There's no reason to, but you could.   Still, I'd rather see Nintendo fix that by making Samus more of a real, fleshed out character."

Metroid,3dz5t5,0megaRidley,0,Tue Jul 21 02:59:51 2015 UTC,"I know I look like the grumpy gamer who can't accept change, but I actually can. Did you read the part of my message where I said it could be compared to Halo 3 ODST ? But this change doesn't add to Metroid imo, it actually sets the series back a few years.  As for the game looking good, I have to disagree. The 3DS has proven it can run games that look much better than FF, with great art directions. Metroid is one of Nintendo's only series that has a more mature art style (didn't say it was 100% realism, but it was far from cartoonish), and I liked it because of this. It set Metroid apart from Big N's other franchises (and again, I love Mario, Pokémon, etc...), and it didn't need that change. Besides, the art direction itself, while this is subjective, doesn't appeal to me at all, the monsters look bland and cartoonish, and I'm saying that with the trailer running in my second widget.   pretty sad if they aren't allowed to ever do anything different.   They totally are allowed to do whatever the heck they want with their games. And as a consumer, I am totally allowed to give my opinion on said product before the game's release. You could say I can't judge anything before the game comes out, but the trailers and interviews are there exactly for this reason : To give the consumer the best possible idea of what they're getting if they buy the product when it releases. I am not convinced at all by what they've shown so far.  It hurts me to talk about the first Metroid title in years like that, Metroid is my favorite franchise of all time. I don't want to say bad things about it. But I stand my ground : ""We haven't gotten a good Metroid game in over seven years and all we get is THIS ?""  ...I sound too aggressive in this message, that wasn't my intention.

I understand the afk'ing on the dark world bubble but I think it's not that bad. So far it only happened a few times when I was really rushing while trying to explore every room.  After you get the Dark Suit, a few energy tanks and know your way around the dark world health is no longer an issue.  The only time I felt real frustration was with the Boost Guardian: after about 5 or 6 tries I finally managed to kill him but died to the dark world DoT as I was really low on HP from the fight.  Not sure if I like MP1 or MP2 best. I'll finish all 3 Prime's before I make a decision."

Metroid,3dx5he,powermad80,3,Mon Jul 20 15:46:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he was nerfed in all releases after the original. In the original, his boost ability would take half a health tank. The senior producer of the game at the time said he couldn't beat the boss at all without going into debug mode."

Metroid,3dx5he,powermad80,2,Mon Jul 20 16:00:52 2015 UTC,"The trilogy controls don't make too much of a difference since not much of the fight is actually spent aiming at the boss. Most of the fight is in morph ball mode and the trilogy controls in morph ball are identical to the GC ones (except you can jump in morph ball in the trilogy version; you couldn't do that on the GC).   But yeah, in general the Trilogy controls make Prime 1/2 a lot easier unless you really know your way around the Gamecube controls. Metroid Prime 1 had a couple control glitches that were simply game breaking if you utilized them well (namely Rapid Fire and Dash Jump)."

And if apparently nobody else has problems with the beam ammo, I shouldn't have problems with it either, and now I dont! :D  This post wasn't meant to stir up dust, it was a tip for people like myself, who had been struggling with getting into Echoes, everyone should play the game the way he or she wants to."

Metroid,3dx5he,TommygunPT,2,Mon Jul 20 13:48:38 2015 UTC,"Well, hate to break it to you, but Echoes has more or less the same thing.  And I sure didn't hate that part, it gave me a reason to explore old locations with new gear."
Metroid,3dx5he,fpiceail,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:54:28 2015 UTC,Well it's not that I thought it was boring ( if you like Metroid or Castlevania you have to enjoy backtracking somehow) it's just that I did a missile/energytank run before defeating Omega Pirate so when I realized I had to do another one in a short time period it just felt cheap!  Also felt that MP2 was just around the corner so I was a bit eager to be done with MP1.  Since I already know this going into MP2 I probably won't have to backtrack multiple times like I did in MP1.
Metroid,3dx5he,Weltall548,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:59:46 2015 UTC,"The problem with the ammo is that usage/gain can be a bit counter-intuitive. The less you use ammo, the less you will earn, and this doesn't exactly cancel out. On my first time through Echoes I had ammo troubles because I was way to conservative with it: this also made boss fights a lot harder. Luckily, there are more ammo recharge stations in Prime 2 than missile stations in Prime 1 (only 3 in the entire game not counting your ship!)."

The only semi-weird thing to get used to is that the big triggers on the bottom are a bit smaller than the GameCube ones, but it does make it easier to access the ZL and ZR buttons. The C-stick is also a full stick, like the Wii Pro controller or the Gamepad, personally I like it a lot better than the little C-stick on the original GameCube controller.  The top and bottom are painted with a really nice looking metallic paint, and the D-pad is a metallic green as well.

Metroid,3dv9un,Ambience7817,14,Mon Jul 20 02:06:03 2015 UTC,"Her name isn't Metroid, it's Samus :) Anyway, I think you should start with Metroid Zero Mission, which is a GBA remake of the first Metroid (didn't age well). Then you should go to Super Metroid, which is agreed by most to be the best in the series. Afterwards, you should try the Prime games, or at least the first one. You can get it either on GameCube, Wii (all three in a trilogy) or Wii U (all three In a trilogy). Then, you should try Metroid Fusion on the GBA, which is last in the timeline. After that, there's a few things you can do. You can challenge yourself to play Metroid and Metroid 2, which haven't aged too well, you can try Other M on the Wii, which a lot of people hate due to the way Samus is shown as well as contradicting other games, or you can replay :p. If you want specifics on the lore, there's lots of YouTube videos on it. Have fun with the series!"
Metroid,3dv9un,kenzy_5g,3,Sun Jul 19 20:53:24 2015 UTC,"The Wii U Prime Trilogy is the same as the Wii one, just downloadable, FYI. The Wii U one is a better option because the physical Wii game is hard to find and a bit pricey as a result."
Metroid,3dv9un,Ambience7817,2,Mon Jul 20 01:39:28 2015 UTC,"Although Metroid 1 did not age well, I would recommend playing that first. At least up to Kraid's lair. It let's one appreciate fully what Super Metroid is and if you play Zero Mission first (since it controls amazingly), one might dislike Super Metroid's floaty jumps.   If people really can't play Metroid 1 though, I can totally understand. I know how frustrated that game makes me."
Metroid,3dv9un,kenzy_5g,0,Mon Jul 20 02:09:40 2015 UTC,"OP, don't play the original Metroid. You'll get bored after maybe four minutes of gameplay."
Metroid,3dv9un,Ambience7817,7,Tue Jul 21 02:07:17 2015 UTC,"tl;dr: explanatory image  Don't start at Federation Force, if rumors are to believed, Samus isnt in it, or at least not playable. I wouldnt start with it as your intro to the series, it seems to be a spin off series. Instead, I'm going to tell you all about the games, what they are about and where to start, because they deserve that.   What It's All About  The Metroid series is generally about being lost on an alien planet and exploring a map as well as ripping off paying homage to the Alien movies by Ripley Scott. You find power ups and go back to old areas where you saw that something could be done, maybe open up a door you previously couldn't with a new weapon, or reach a power up you saw with new abilities. There is usually a big map that inter-connects with itself at multiple areas (If youve played Dark Souls on PS3/360/PC, its like that). After the introduction at the start of the games, you aren't given any real direction in terms of where to go, just to explore (Fusion and the Prime series are different from this though). You may be given a point on the map that is your destination, but no way explaining to you how to get there. You're lost and need to get the hell out. That's the basis of the games.   Music (skip this section if Video game music isn't important to you)  Its soundtrack is very good, its a perfect backing to being lost and isolated, or full of wonder, or afraid of the dander ahead, or to get your blood pumped when fighting a boss.  Styles of Games  You have 2 styles of games, 3D Halo like FPS (not FPS in terms of call of duty, but more First Person Adventure with shooting mechanics), and 2D Castlevania (side scrolling plat former) like. All the 2D games aren't that long, maybe 8 hours tops each, more like 5 on the first run. The 3D ones are like 18 hours. I recommend 2D first, so when you play 3D, you see why its so highly regarded.   2D Games  Unless you have nostalgia for NES games or enjoy the old school style, start at Metroid: Zero Mission, its a re-imagining of the original Metroid on NES. Its really tight, and controls well, and is considered one of the best in the series. This is the chronological start of the series. On GBA only in the US, but the original NES one is on the 3DS and WiiU eShop.  Super Metroid is considered to be the best in the series, and maybe top 10 of all time by many. I recommend playing this first, because the more floaty physics are a bit off putting after playing the GBA ones. However, its built with these physics in mind, and oh my god its amazing. Easily the best intro to Metroid and what its all about. Start with this game. SNES, or Wii and WiiU virtual console  Metroid Fusion is my first Metroid, so I have a special place in my heart for it. It is the first attempt for a story based Metroid game, and takes out the exploration for a more linear experience. Its still amazing game. It really nails the creepy atmosphere that Metroid is king of, rivaled only by Metroid Prime 2. It has the best controls in the 2D series. GBA and WiiU Virtual console  Metroid II: Return of Samus is a GB exclusive (or 3DS eShop downloadable). I haven't personally played it for more than 10 minutes when I got it for free on Club Nintendo, but I have heard its pretty good, graphics aside. There is no mimimap, and the areas blur together, but hunting down all the metroids and exterminating them sounds super cool. Since the story in metroid isn't exactly important, you can skip it with no real issues, but if you want the full story then definitely play it.   3D  Metroid Prime is probably the best in the series to many, because its the first 3D metroid and it easily deserves it. It took what super metroid was and converted it into 3D, just as good as going from Super Mario to Mario 64. Like super metroid, its easily in the top 10 of all time with Super (metacritic has it at 15th highest rated of all time if that type of thing matters at all to you). That's how good it is. Its on Gamecube and Wii (WiiU digital only as well). Don't play the Gamecube version, its before standardized controls and if you arent used to it you never will be at this point. Play the Metroid Prime Trilogy on Wii or WiiU with the motion controls. I know many people don't like motion controls, but these are easily some of the best on the entire system. Its all super intuitive, it only wants you to point where to shoot, like a mouse on a PC (its as intuitive as using a mouse as well). The Prime series is best played in order, because it actually has a story that is heavily based on the previous games. 3 great games for 20 bucks is an absolute steal on WiiU. If you like physical games it will run you about 50-60 at gamestop.  Metroid Prime: Hunters is a spinoff game (or not?) that takes place between prime 1 and 2 that is super fun. it doesnt control that well going back to it as the DS doesnt have a second analogue stick so ABXY acted in its place, but its super fun in multiplayer. You can skip this game as well, but its perfectly fine. Has some of the coolest characters in the series, but that honestly isn't that hard because Metroid isn't known for new characters.  Metroid: Other M is an abortion of a game a fine game with awful use of characters. If it was another character that wasn't Samus or not in the metroid universe at all it would have been fine. It plays pretty well and looks fun, but it destroys samus's character. Skip this game absolutely.   If you like chronological order, its: Metroid/Metroid: Zero Mission > Prime 1 > Hunters > Prime 2> Prime 3 > Metroid 2 > Super > Other M > Fusion  My Recommended order is: Super > Zero Mission > Fusion > Prime Trilogy in order  No one knows where federation force will take place, but i imagine it will be post prime 3, pre-Metroid 2"

Metroid,3dv9un,Judedeath,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:08:24 2015 UTC,"I hear you, but I understand why. It lost the exploration aspects of metroid. sure, you explore the 6 sectors and the other areas (HUB world, hidden area, etc), but they dont blend satisfyingly. they do have connections, but it isnt during normal play, only during times when you are locked out of returning via story (which was amazing, because it felt like you were breaking the rules, even if it was intended). While it didn't have the exploration, it did nail the creepy and isolated feeling metroid also gives off. That's why its said to be an excellent game, but not a super amazing metroid game, its a great game.   If you want someone to blame, the list is from /v/"

Metroid,3dv9un,1upD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:20:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on every point except on Fusion having the best controls in the 2D series. Zero Mission definitely takes that cake, Fusion is way too clunky, animations take too long in comparison to other games, plus they removed single-wall jumping and infinite bomb jumping (apparently on purpose to prevent sequence breaking, but it doesn't do the controls any good)."
Metroid,3dv9un,Spudtron98,3,Tue Jul 21 08:46:26 2015 UTC,"Ok, a few things.   First the biggest mistake in your post, Metroid is not the name of the main character, it is the name of a species of enemies in the games, the main character who is the player character is named Samus Aran.  So since it isn't out yet I can't really say if Federation Force is a good place to start in the series but currently there is a larger view against Federation Force in the Metroid fan community as it currently appears to be dropping a lot of the things that people really like about the Metroid series such as a Lonely Atmosphere and a open world to adventure and discover in with progress in certain places by lacking items needed to proceed such as needing missles to open certain doors, or double jump to get up to certain platforms. In Federation Force from what we've seen currently it looks like they are dropping those for 4 player monster hunter style gameplay and a mission based system, it could be a good game(idk gameplay doesn't interest me) but it is lacking some things that people think are needed in a Metroid game.  I don't think I'm knowledgeable enough currently to be able to cut down the Metroid story into a good primer for Federation Force as I really need to replay Prime 3 and Fusion where the Federation are more of a thing. A quick overview is that in the future humans have colonies in space, in one such colony lives six year old Samus and her family, the colony is then attacked by this hostile alien race(I am unsure if they are a single race or not) called the Space Pirates lead by one of their Generals known as Ridley, the whole Colony is killed and destroyed excepted for Samus who survives. She is then found by the Chozo a ancient advanced race of Bird People who raise her. The Chozo is how she gets the Power Armor she uses and once she becomes old enough she goes off into the Galaxy to become a Bounty Hunter and the Chozo die off.   I'm sure I'm missing a lot and messing up the story so don't take this as 100% true this is just from memory of second hand retellings of stuff.  In terms of games to play, I don't know what the 3DS Virtual Console is like, but the big two Metroid Games most people point to as must plays are Super Metroid for the SNES and Metroid Prime for the GCN(also released with IMO better controls on the Wii as Metroid Prime Trilogy which is also on the Wii U eShop). After those there are the two GBA games, Fusion and Zero Mission, Zero Mission is a remake of the original NES Metroid. There are also 2 more main Prime games, 2 Echoes and 3 Corruption which along with Prime create a bit of a story Trilogy. There is also Metroid 2: The Return of Samus for the Game Boy I can't speak on that as I haven't played it, Metroid for the NES which is interesting but more of a play if interested in more Metroid go for Zero Mission first kind of game. There are also 2 DS spin-offs, Metroid Prime Hunters which is a Multiplayer focused game that I can't really speak on but people compare Federation Force to it, there is also Metroid Prime Pinball which is a Metroid themed pinball game.  And now for the game I was putting off talking about, there is also a wii game called Metroid Other M that is mostly disliked to hated from what I have seen, I can't speak on it too much as I haven't played it yet, but the sidebar has two links about why it sucks.  I hope this helps and isn't just insane rambling."
Metroid,3dv9un,SarcasticRidley,2,Sun Jul 19 21:08:11 2015 UTC,"Well, it definitely helps, and isn't insane rambling (though it is a little hard to follow).  Thanks."
Metroid,3dv9un,wayoverpaid,3,Sun Jul 19 23:19:45 2015 UTC,"Federation Force is a rather touchy subject, which is why you're getting down voted.  I suggest starting with Metroid Zero Mission for the 2D games, then Another Metroid 2 Remake, Super Metroid, and Metroid Fusion.  For 3D there's the main Prime series, 3 games spread out between GameCube and Wii. I haven't played them yet though so i dunno about them.  Other M had fun gameplay imo but since it's basically ""2D metroid in 3D"" i suggest trying Zero Mission first"
Metroid,3dv9un,Satiie,3,Sun Jul 19 23:57:07 2015 UTC,all the times watching friends play Smash doesn't hear or see the name Samus on the CSS.   how the fuck do you do the 4chan greentext shit arrows?
Metroid,3dv9un,RequiemStorm,2,Mon Jul 20 02:39:32 2015 UTC,"It may be the worst place to start. That isn't to say it's a bad game, since of course we can't know that or not yet. It's a bad place to start because it's a massive departure from the series formula and its themes, as well as the main character, Samus Aran.  I'd recommend starting with Metroid Zero Mission, Super Metroid, or Metroid Prime. Zero Mission the first game in the series chronologically and a remake of the original 1986 Metroid. Super Metroid was the clear standout of the 2D Metroid games, and is widely regarded as one of the best games of all time. Metroid Prime is the first 3D Metroid and is an excellent first person adventure game."

If you have the iron of borrowing a wii or game cube or something,  definitely play the prime series.  Honestly,  they are all great,  though many disagree about Metroid Prime Hunters and Metroid Other M. I'm not here to start that argument,  but I say give them a shot."

And holy moley I just thought of something Nintendo could use for a new Metroid game... Have human Samus go around hunting down robot Samus. Kinda like a reverse Metroid Fusion or something."
Metroid,3dlw9v,Moulinoski,8,Fri Jul 17 22:41:10 2015 UTC,"thats fucking awesome.  Dark Samus, Light Samus, Bio-Samus, Flame Samus, Arctic Samus, etc...  cause if they can download the consciousness surely they could copy it and tweak it."
Metroid,3dlw9v,I-Downvoted_You,6,Fri Jul 17 22:59:00 2015 UTC,"That sounds really awesome and means it can end with Samus dying to save a planet without Samus dying for the series...  Plus it gives a reason to get upgrades after beating bosses, even if there are no Chozo statues nearby.  You could even have a unique gameplay mechanic and have the defeated Samus clones (who were undoubtedly stolen and tweaked by Space pirates, eventually if not in the first game they appear it) become allies that you can control, giving you the ability to be in two places at once."
Metroid,3dlw9v,tccrist,6,Fri Jul 17 23:04:38 2015 UTC,Jeez. Reading that made me realize that this was a way that Federation Force could've shoe-horned multiple Samus's in one place.  :|

Metroid,3dn0yc,MrMxyzptlk123,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:43:09 2015 UTC,Blast Ball is a concept that was already done a long time ago. I remember one of the earliest F2P games was like Blast Ball. Only it was more like HL2's gravity gun.
Metroid,3dn0yc,thegreathobbyist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:41:03 2015 UTC,This looks way more interesting on account of being a completely unique concept and now I want to play it.

Metroid,3dmixu,ryanoh,3,Fri Jul 17 14:02:55 2015 UTC,Yes! This is definitely something I'd buy in a heartbeat.
Metroid,3dmixu,2CATteam,3,Fri Jul 17 14:24:21 2015 UTC,"My biggest concern is that people will be interested but that because of everything that needs to go into it people won't be able/willing to pay for it. For a finished version that's assembled and painted, is a custom controller, lights up and makes noises - what's the theoretical amount you'd pay for that?  The issue is that when these things type of things come out as a pre-order exclusive or whatever the companies make thousands. I'd be making less than 20, so I wouldn't be able to buy in bulk and bring the cost down nearly as much as a giant company can.  Honestly, its going to be expensive, but the upside is you'll be one of the few people in the world who has one of these."
Metroid,3dmixu,2CATteam,2,Fri Jul 17 14:28:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what the maximum would be, but I'd definitely have no problem paying $200-$250 for it."
Metroid,3dmixu,2CATteam,3,Fri Jul 17 16:34:59 2015 UTC,"It might be closer to 300, but it really all depends on how many people can commit to buying from an initial run so I can divide the total cost among them.  EDIT: Or, if that's the price ceiling for people I need to rethink it and take some features out, but I know that I want to keep the controller incorporated. Lights and sounds might be something that just goes in my personal one, or have the option for people with some extra cash."
Metroid,3dmixu,souffle-etc,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:44:28 2015 UTC,"Would the other buttons on the Wiimote (D-pad for missiles,  plus-home-minus buttons for beams and visors, 1 and 2 for map and logbook) also be incorporated?  EDIT: I just noticed the Wiimote on top of the cannon. Nevermind!"
Metroid,3dmixu,ThePhreshKarut,2,Fri Jul 17 18:15:14 2015 UTC,"No worries. Yeah, in that version its literally a wiimote stuck into the model with the A + B buttons remapped. That means in order to change visors or do missiles you have to use your left hand to reach over, which honestly I think is inline with what Samus's would have to do. I am going to look at possibly remapping those buttons, but IIRC its tedious soldering to very, very small parts and I'm not that great of a solderer. I am looking into that though."

Metroid,3dgf3b,Butter_Is_Life,22,Thu Jul 16 14:22:38 2015 UTC,I really like the overdetailed design on the suit. It reminds me of something you'd see on Ghost in the Shell (coincidentally so does Samus).  edit Now that's what I'm talking about.

Metroid,3dgf3b,PIP_SHORT,4,Thu Jul 16 03:16:47 2015 UTC,"Damn, this one kills me because the line work is amazing, but her expression ruins it. If she just killed that thing she'd be looking exhausted and pleased, instead she has ""come into my bedroom"" eyes. I'm glad her pose isn't a porn pose, even though the figure was probably referenced from a porn image.  God damn though, the line work is so much on point.  8/10  edit: it's her suit, which is more evident in the (beautifully done) colored version. Regardless, my criticism stands.  edit 2: downvotes for giving my opinion. This is how Reddit works I suppose. It's against the rules but who cares about rules or etiquette or politeness, right?"
Metroid,3dgf3b,twinfyre,2,Thu Jul 16 10:55:23 2015 UTC,"It looks to me like she's posing for the picture. Have you ever seen those pictures (my mom is a photographer so she takes these all the time) where Some High school senior is standing next to their car and leaning against it? That's probably where this one came from. Samus is making the ""bedroom eyes"" because she probably thought ""oh hey, let's do a flirty pose for this one"".  Or maybe we're both just thinking too deeply into this one. Maybe the artist just wanted to draw Samus in an alluring pose and also draw her suit next to her. I don't really have a problem with that."
Metroid,3dgf3b,ozzAR0th,2,Thu Jul 16 14:41:25 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen the artist say, they've not personally played Metroid. So to them Samus is just a sexy character to draw. And artistically it contrasts well against the heavy, mechanical suit she uses.  I personally don't like how most artists depict Samus but y'know, whining isn't going to stop it, nor does it make the artwork any less badass."
Metroid,3dgf3b,PIP_SHORT,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:45:55 2015 UTC,"Well.... there's other options than just whining, despite how things appear on Reddit.  Offering constructive criticism in a compliment sandwich is generally seen as valuable feedback by artists.  It didn't stop people from downvoting me for giving my opinion, but hey this is Reddit.

Metroid,3dgf3b,ozzAR0th,3,Thu Jul 16 15:25:48 2015 UTC,"indeed, although I'll admit on this subreddit any criticism of Zero Suit Samus, even if it seems relatively tame, seems to always get downvoted to all hell.  It seems our community both has a lot of people who are instantly offended by anything sexy, and those who are so attached to their waifu that any criticism is hated.  Ofc they're likely a vocal minority, and most actual fans lie in more of a middle ground."

Metroid,3dgf3b,FalkenMotorsport,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:54:20 2015 UTC,Fair! Its the conscious mind understanding that an opinion doesn't decide the human that makes a good community. There is more to it than proZSS and antiZSS.

The only way you can figure out is if you have a tri-wing screwdriver to open the cart. The bottom of the actual chip should have a Nintendo imprint on it as seen here.  If it turns out that your copy does have a battery inside, it shouldn't be too hard to replace. You'll just need a CR1616 battery and some tape (electrical tape would be best, but scotch tape was able to work with my GBA Pokemon games with no issue). A small flathead screwdriver or hobby knife will be needed to pry the metal prongs off the battery. Make sure that they are still attached to the circuit board though."

Her last name of Aran may refer to the Aran Islands on the west coast of Ireland. Combining the two gives the meaning: ""She who supplants an island"" or ""She who conquers an isolated area by force.""[6] Pronunciation of the name over the years has varied from either SAMUHS A-RUHN (as in the verb ""run""), A-RAHN (using the ""CAT"" vowel for the first two As and the verb form of ""ran""), but it wasn’t until the release of Metroid Prime 3: Corruption that pronunciation of her name was finally cemented as SAMUHS ERR-EN, and it is likely to remain this way since.

It seemed like you needed to back track every area many times. The dark area draining your energy destroyed it for me.  After playing it recently, I like the game. The bosses are good. Back tracking wasn't nearly as bad as I remembered. Energy for weapons and health are everywhere, so it's not a big issue using either.  I still like Super and Prime 1 more, but 2 isn't as bad as I remember it."
Metroid,3dbovv,macfox717,16,Wed Jul 15 03:58:40 2015 UTC,"The dark area draining your energy destroyed it for me.   That was one of my favorite parts of the game. Unlike most other dark/light world games, the dark world in Echoes was actually scary. It felt like you were entering hell. It was so satisfying when I finally got the light suit and was able to walk around freely and explore in an area that used to kill me just for being there.  What are you thoughts on it now after replaying?"
Metroid,3dbovv,Father_Brain,3,Wed Jul 15 13:18:36 2015 UTC,"That part isn't nearly as bad as I remember. It takes a while to drain energy, and the light beacons are everywhere. The only time it's really an issue is during boss fights, and even then it's not bad.  Early game it slightly stopped me from exploring, until I realized energy pick-ups are everywhere. And like you said, it makes the game more interesting. Sprinting from beacon to beacon is fun, and it makes you feel like you're in the enemy base."
Metroid,3dbovv,macfox717,3,Wed Jul 15 13:26:16 2015 UTC,The only time it's really an issue is during boss fights   Yeah the lack of light crystals for the boost ball guardian fight was a horrible design decision IMO. The Amorbis fight was pretty cool because you had a few light crystals that you could dart between as the fight went on. But the boost ball guardian? It's already a hard boss and they put the player on a timer.

Metroid,3dbovv,Luigimario280,11,Wed Jul 15 13:27:55 2015 UTC,"It's not a bad game, it's just not QUITE as good as the first one, IMO.  The first one felt really immersive and flowed great.  The second tried to be less linear, but as a result you end up having to go through some annoying hoops with world switching.  It has the same problem that Prime does where there are a few ""lots of enemies spawn in this room, you must kill them to continue"" that thankfully Prime 3 finally got rid of.  However because you need to backtrack more, the problem is even more apparent.  However, as far as I can tell it's not universally disliked.  There are people who dislike Prime the most (because it's fairly plain and doesn't have its own identity outside of elements we've seen in super) and people who dislike Corruption (because voice acting and relative linearity.)  No one as far as I know considers it an abomination.  Even though it's my least favorite in the series, I would say it's merely ""very good"" instead of being amazing.  It's very hard to criticize it with any degree of sincerity when Other M more or less rewrote the bell curve."

Metroid,3dbovv,pick-a-spot,2,Wed Jul 15 06:00:27 2015 UTC,They were indeed annoying (and cool).   One well placed charged Dark Beam shot + Missile = OHKO.
Metroid,3dbovv,wayoverpaid,2,Wed Jul 15 13:12:13 2015 UTC,"I played Prime 1 earlier this year and loved it. But I just didn't have the patience to follow this one through.  The problem was it was just 'too prime', you can't up all the Prime variables to the max;  It was less linear which is fine, but when less linear means jumping through the wrong dark world portal to be slowly poisoned, and then respawning enemies that take far too long kill. It becomes an exercise in patience.  I watched a playthrough instead and it seems to get slightly less frustrating as you you progress"
Metroid,3dbovv,Xero_K,2,Wed Jul 15 07:42:06 2015 UTC,"I find it amusing you describe it as ""turning the prime variables to the max.""  Non-linearity and such aren't really Prime variables.  Echoes took a pretty solid formula, and they messed with it in ways which go against what made the first game so great.  One of Prime's core features is a world map that you can fairly easily navigate.  It's an extremely clear map, the locations are highly sensible, and backtracking is fairly straightforward.  You can usually look at the map in 3d and go ""ok, I need to get over here... so I should be looking for something over there.""  You usually felt like the puzzles were obvious and you knew if you could go somewhere or if it was beyond you for the moment.  Prime 2 introduces an alternate world, so now you can't just reason your way through the map based on what you see, you have to assume you need to explore both the light and dark version of the world before you can draw a conclusion about where to go.  This isn't a ""Prime"" thing, it's actually closer to a Zelda thing, except that ALttP you could quickly pop from light to dark via the mirror -- in Echoes you have to take a trek through a portal.  In gameplay, this makes Echoes so much more frustrating.  In Prime you go ""ok, what am I missing in this room?""  In Echoes you go ""ok, shit, am I in the right light/dark world?  Maybe I should check the other copy.""  And then that means 2 more mandatory locked rooms with minions.""  The ""Prime"" variables I think was just how balanced it was.  Not the linear spoonfeeding of Other M, nor the complete lack of direction you get from the first Metroid.  It was just the right level of letting you figure out what to do on your own."
Metroid,3dbovv,Paxtian,7,Wed Jul 15 08:05:13 2015 UTC,"This or Prime 1 is my favorite. It had my favorite boss fight (Quadraxis) and one of my favorite beams and combos (Annihilator and Sonic Boom). The ammo system was fine, and I liked the light/dark elements.    I do need to ask about which version you played, cus if it's the Trilogy one then the two bosses you noted got scaled back quite a bit. If not then kudos for not having too much issue with them.    This game did have a higher difficulty than Prime 1, but the Prime games' gameplay really makes the difficulty worth it. If a game's really enjoyable, I'll be driven to overcome the challenges within, and the Prime games definitely count there."
Metroid,3dbovv,clonetrooper250,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:45:18 2015 UTC,"I played both, and the Trilogy is far easier, for several reasons.  The scaling back is one, but the fact that you can ball jump with the Wii Remote by just flicking it up made the Boost Guardian a lot easier."
Metroid,3dbovv,SarcasticRidley,8,Wed Jul 15 14:47:10 2015 UTC,"Prime 2 is my favorite game out of the whole series. I love the light/dark world mechanic, it effectively doubles the explorative element of the game without feeling like a cheap gimmick. Also, the way Dark Aether's denizens completely tear through A full platoon of Federation Marines and legions of Space Pirates make them seem like a very serious threat, rather than this week's brood of creatures Samus has to slaughter.

So for The Spider Guardian I totally get how it's easier on the trilogy.  The boost guardian seems like it wouldn't matter much. Speaking strictly on the controls, mind you.  If the true difficulty was lowered for the trilogy (I believe it was) then that's a different story I suppose.  Still a great game regardless of version IMO."
Metroid,3dbovv,pueojit,9,Wed Jul 15 17:50:11 2015 UTC,My biggest problem with the game is those rooms where the doors lock and you have to kill the enemies to get out because A. The turn invisible so you can't shoot them B. They take a million hits to kill and C. Because they respawn every time you walk in the room xc

They're easy to kill by using charged Dark (to freeze) and then a missile.   I agree they're really annoying, but it's not nearly as bad as you make it out to be. Unless you're speedrunning."
Metroid,3dbovv,camopon,3,Wed Jul 15 04:08:46 2015 UTC,You encounter them multiple times before you aquire the Dark Visor But there's so many rooms where you can encounter them Really? I need to try that

Metroid,3dbovv,twinfyre,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:10:33 2015 UTC,"I rate it above the third and in a hazy flux roughly but never exactly equal to the first. For me, the best comparisons would be the Zelda games Ocarina, Majora and Skyward. The second is better than the first in some ways and more limited in others - the third apes certain things from the first while adding unnecessary motion controls and repetition, as well as breaking up what previously felt like contiguous worlds into many parts accessed through a fancy but effectively risk free mode of transport.  I still loved Skyward Sword and Corruption despite their failings, and Majora and Echoes may not always live up to the exemplary originals but they are still my favourites with good reason."

Metroid,3dbovv,Glitch1500,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:30:55 2015 UTC,"The biggest complaints that I've seen with Echoes is, that while backtracking is nothing new in the metroid games, every time you have to backtrack especially towards the end of the game you have to go back and forth between the dark and light worlds. Which require a load screen every single time you do so. Towards the end of the game there is a room puzzle that requires like 6-8 light-dark world transitions and is tedious as fuck. This is for a single room. Not very fun of a mechanic, even if it is neat.  The Boost guardian isn't 'hard'. Its broken. At least in the non-trilogy version. What makes it broken isn't that the boss fight itself is difficult, but rather that the arena is too small, the boss is very RNG based on if you get an opening to attack it, and you effectively get a time limit on if you beat it or not based on your constant hp drain. You could do everything correct in the boost guardian fight and take zero damage from the guardian itself and still die due to RNG and DoT.  The ammo complaints are likely just because it was different. I didn't have a problem with the system personally.  Environments are personal taste and will never satisfy everyone.  Difficulty is also personal experience, but the boost ball guardian was inherently broken due to reasons above. Not 'difficult', broken.  There is a bit of sequel-itis going on with Echoes. Metroid Prime is a very hard act to follow. It is heralded as the best 3D metroid game to date and plays, and feels, like a 2D metroid put into 3D. People will always tend to criticize and scrutinize the sequel much harsher than the original, its just human nature.  Overall it was a very enjoyable game with, imo, some of the best looking armor and abilities in the series. Some of the mechanics were extremely fun and the puzzles were rewarding. The very end of the game did feel a bit lacking compared to the rest though, at least for me."
Metroid,3dbovv,duckdotexe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:47:10 2015 UTC,My issue with the ammo system is that in games like Zelda and metroid the upgrades sort of create this power progression like leveling up would in an rpg. Getting the plasma beam and one shoting enemies that once took multiple hits is bad ass.   The ammo system sort of kills this. My first play through I was paranoid about wasting ammo so I didn't use it often. Being a little ammo hoarder killed that sense of power progression until I got the screw attack which let me one shot ING and blast across areas.   My second playthrough I realized that with the reloads and ammo upgrades that such fears were unfounded and I had the opposite problem. I wound up getting the most powerful beams really early in the game and again didn't get that feeling of progression until late into the game.
Metroid,3dbovv,Carconzo222,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:50:57 2015 UTC,"Playing the Prime Trilogy version of it and only beating it a few days ago, I too liked it. I finished Prime 3 last night and I feel like I've enjoyed Prime 2 the most out of the Trilogy, the Space Pirate lore was rich and entertaining at points 'Metroids are not meant to be kept as pets!'. I just disliked the health regeneration rate in the fields. Although, they gave me a reason to actually get up, stretch and go to the toilet/get something to eat, so I guess they were good for something! The Boost Guardian I did on my first shot, I heard it was easier in Prime Trilogy, so I guess that isn't a surprise. The Spider Guardian was a bit of a nightmare, but the flick remote to jump feature in Trilogy was a life saver, and the 'fight' only took 5-10 minutes. I found the Sky Temple keys a lot easier than the artifacts in Prime 1, although I found the artifacts not too bad either, I didn't need a guide and I felt like a badass finding the one in that Space Pirate base with little leads to go on. I hated getting the Sky Key that you had to use the Light Suit to go into the beam for, only because I revisited that area in the dark world 3 times before I actually could get it, so that long trek to the portal was infuriating! Plus, the portal transition cutscene was tedious after a while, but I understand it was to hide loading screens. Sorry for going on a lot, just giving my first impressions on it after recently beating it!"

Tried a few times yesterday but couldn't kill it (was sleepy, reaction time was low).  People say the game is the worse of the 3 but i'm actually enjoying it. At first I didn't like the light/dark world mechanic as it seemed like a lazy way to extend the play time. After completing the first temple I actually enjoy it, it reminds me of games like Soul Reaver where things you do in one world affect the other.  The one think I did not enjoy was having to wait for the health regen on the dark world bubbles.  Sometimes backtracking has been really boring but as an avid Igvania player you know that's part of the game."

Metroid,3dbqw5,RidleyBro,3,Wed Jul 15 19:32:38 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't think that Combat Stilettos fit Metroid as a setting.  Metroid, while full of relatively weird stuff, has always been somewhat of a serious setting. Combat Stilettos works perfectly well in over-the-top settings like Bayonetta or that MGS game with the Cyborg Ninja that slices through robots using a Katana. But on Samus... I can't really take that seriously.  It also depends on how heels are done: I despise Other M's heels because in addition to look horrible they have no reason to exist and can't possibly fit under the armor (and the entire point of the Zero Suit is to fit under the armor!), while I'm more positive of the Smash's heels and I appreciate that the developers took time making them in a way that at least give Samus a reason to wear them. Even then, I'd rather keep the rocket heels in ""not-really-serious"" settings like Smash, where they work fine, but keep them away from actual Metroid games, where they would just look silly.  That, and I just don't like heels in general, I think they're ugly. So I'm probably biased anyway."
Metroid,3dbqw5,twinfyre,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:16:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not going to defend other M on this sort of thing. I found the heels to be a bit strange in other M too.

It's possible that this combined with the medical ability to straight up change a person's DNA (as seen in fusion) that this could very well be an extremely viable theory as gender is literally one chromosome.
Metroid,3detsc,damanlyguy,5,Thu Jul 16 02:32:39 2015 UTC,"I know, I didn't say it is impossible, just that she definitely went through female puberty so the people saying ""oh look she's big and strong so lol trans woman!"" are just idiots.  :x"
Metroid,3detsc,Tagrineth,13,Thu Jul 16 03:03:41 2015 UTC,I'd also argue that it was probably a joke since her being a woman was a big deal when she was revealed at the end.

Metroid,3detsc,0ddBaillie,9,Wed Jul 15 19:22:06 2015 UTC,"This is a game about space, bounty hunting, aliens, spaceships, pirates, planetary destruction and giant pterodactyls. From 1994. Someone really thinks that a man on the development team said ""Let's make her transsexual because why not""?"
Metroid,3detsc,Mortimer42,7,Wed Jul 15 20:36:45 2015 UTC,"Meh.  I don't really see the significance. If this was actually cannon it would be mentioned on other places, as well as her backstory. The ""facts"" this post seems to cling onto it a single throwaway line of ""What is a secret only you know?"" asked to developers. Between a lot of people saying nothing or really obvious stuff that was already in the manual the person in question, Matsuoka Hirofumi, sounds more like he's making a joke.   Still we could have been wrong all those years and bird DNA is a lot more extensive then we initially thought."
Metroid,3detsc,GhostlyPixel,3,Wed Jul 15 19:03:42 2015 UTC,And it should also be noted that he was one of the designers for Samus. He wasn't the designer.
Metroid,3detsc,IrishLink,-2,Wed Jul 15 22:59:25 2015 UTC,It would be mentioned on other places   See Birdo and Vivian...
Metroid,3detsc,Mortimer42,2,Wed Jul 15 19:15:58 2015 UTC,That's from a completely different game. I really don't see what you're getting at. Are you saying they wanted to make that a twist and then back paddled after the controversy?
Metroid,3detsc,IrishLink,0,Wed Jul 15 19:20:45 2015 UTC,"No, I'm just saying that, considering Nintendo's track record of covering up Trans characters (although small), I wouldn't be surprised if the same thing happened here,  either because they decided against it, or were made drop it by Nintendo. It was just an idea on my part, anyway..."
Metroid,3detsc,BearborgOne,6,Wed Jul 15 21:35:36 2015 UTC,"Did he actually say that in an interview?   Yes.   Is it the correct translation?   No. His exact wording was ""newhalf"", which is Japanese slang for a trans woman with a penis. It has somewhat disrespectful connotations, as it's commonly used to describe porn stars or sex workers. In all likelihood, it was a crude joke on Matsuoka's part- especially considering that he was just a background artist on Super Metroid.  Also worth noting: A decade or so later, Yoshio Sakamoto joked that ""We can't have Samus as a newhalf"" when asked by a fan if he would transition Metroid over to Sony consoles instead of Nintendo's."

Metroid,3d9kc1,heart-station,3,Tue Jul 14 15:51:09 2015 UTC,let's be honest here. The main reason we're all mad about the game is the cruddy art style.
Metroid,3d9kc1,twinfyre,3,Wed Jul 15 03:25:30 2015 UTC,I could live with the art style if it was still a metroid game!

That being said, I AM DEFINITELY wanting another Metroid game, but would like its universe to be expanded.  EDIT: typo"
Metroid,3d9kc1,ThePhreshKarut,0,Fri Jul 17 01:47:05 2015 UTC,"Wrong. The main reason we're all mad is that we expected a main Metroid game and got a spin-off.

Metroid,3d9kc1,bandikoopa,2,Tue Jul 14 17:48:47 2015 UTC,There are other games on the 3ds with much better graphics and a lot more going on as far as assets. What we saw wasn't a lack of graphic capability due to the platform.

Sorry about that.   How did the Trilogy DOWNGRADE the graphics?   When Prime 1 and 2 were developed, the extensive particle effects that made the arm cannon look so awesome were not designed to follow an arm cannon that was being pointed around the screen with a Wii remote. It would've taken developers a while to adapt the particle effects, so they unfortunately took the lazy route.  Some water physics were removed too. Plus, all three games had to fit on a single disc! Some compressing had to be done."

Fear not, I'm sure within the next 2 years we will hear about a 'full-fledged' console Metroid game."

Metroid,3d9kc1,GhostlyPixel,3,Tue Jul 14 23:36:26 2015 UTC,"Its okay brother. I understand the concern.  I think Nintendo will put out a suitable game with FF; but it may not be exactly the game that everyone wants (Metroid Prime clone). However, I think it will be more enjoyable to Metroid fans than they expect.  Its the same thing that has been happening with Ocarina of Time over the last 2 decades. Ever since release, Zelda fans have clamored for a similar game and have been very hesitant to accept anything else but that."

I'd love to see them give it another go with that type of style; but be a bit more disciplined with it. -- However, based on the backlash, I think they will eventually give the fans another MP game and avoid Other M at all costs.

Home console gamers that played the most recent Metroid games likely won't return to the series if they have to buy a handheld to do so.   The thing is, this game is not aimed at Metroid fans. FF is aimed at the general 3DS audience (which has a user base around 5x larger than the Wii U user base). Metroid sales have never been stellar, so Nintendo is trying to generate wider appeal for the series. They decided to add in popular gameplay mechanics and chose to avoid developing for their under-performing home console. In theory these decisions should result in higher sales.  Right now we can only hope that FF wins over a bunch of new fans and that Nintendo uses this opportunity to introduce new fans to the roots of the series in the next game."

Metroid,3dbght,MisterDoubleYum,16,Wed Jul 15 06:03:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is wrong if you think they are terrible. They are a very good example of motion control done correctly. I love the motion controls in Prime.  No, you are not wrong if you state your opinion that you don't like motion controls.  As others have said, play with the settings. Change the sensitivity. Change lock-on free aim or whatever. Try out the options and see what you like. Make sure you are 3-6ft from the sensor bar.  Also, you might just suck right now. Like all things in gaming, it takes some practice to get good at it."

In the Wii U settings you set whether it is above or below your TV.  If the controls are not responsive, then there could be a problem with your setup. Maybe you need a new wiimote or sensor bar.   Are there issues with any other games that use motion control? (Though it seems like you might not play many other games with motion control since you don't like it....)"

Metroid,3dbght,plasmabeamonline,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:01:01 2015 UTC,"How about you pull the stick out of your butt and try adjusting the controls. If you don't like the sensitivity, just lower it (I personally put it all the way up). If you don't like the ""resident evil wii"" aiming system just change it to classic FPS controls (that is, move the cursor to the edge of the screen and samus turns). If you don't like the ""lock on free aim"" then turn it off. Plain and simple.  By the way you completely disregarded what /u/MonochromeTyrant said, you seem to think you're here to win arguments or have a discussion. But it's pretty clear that you have no idea what you're talking about. Mess around with options for a little while and you'll find that it controls much better. You might even find that the games are a lot less difficult with the new control scheme. I know I did.   Or if you find the pointer to be jittery, I recommend you change the distance between the wii remote and the sensor bar. It could be a hardware issue you're dealing with here."

Because the Gamecube version doesn't have traditional gamepad FPS controls, rather it actually feels extremely clunky. For example, the left stick moves forward, back, and turns left and right.

Metroid,3d7wm2,sgrantcarr,10,Tue Jul 14 05:12:45 2015 UTC,My understanding was that she was physically mutilated by the suit being surgically removed from her in the beginning but eventually her body is regenerated by the x parasite.
Metroid,3d7wm2,MikeygoBoom,5,Tue Jul 14 06:15:43 2015 UTC,"Official canon is dubious about her fate, though developer interviews imply she is no longer 'Fused' with Metroid DNA (I imagine because they didn't want to be chained to story elements that might not be relevant in future titles).  Much like her Phazon infusion at the end of MP3, she is simply 'restored'... I guess.  If you ask me, her fate is pretty obvious"
Metroid,3d7wm2,einherjrar,12,Tue Jul 14 08:05:17 2015 UTC,"I've always assumed that only her suit looked physically different.  The Metroid vaccine was more or less an introduction of either select genes or RNA specifically to provide X-immunity at a cellular level.  The ice weakness came as a side effect of introducing those specific genes, or from the gene isolation process not being specific enough given the time frame they had to work with to develop it.  I assume she's had a more robust infusion with Chozo DNA but even that never made her appearance bird-like.  Her restoration is implied in the end-game as well since she can now use the ice beam again.  As to why absorbing the original X that infected her would eliminate the Metroid genes, good question."
Metroid,3d7wm2,metroidman388,4,Tue Jul 14 09:45:46 2015 UTC,"I don't deny what you're saying, but until a new Metroid title is placed beyond Fusion in the timeline her fate is anyone's guess."

She is already somewhat Chozo, and then there is the suit, the very definition of adaptability.  Of all things I liked in Fusion was the X-Parasite and her absorbing it, Metroid-like and getting even more powerful.  There are only so many beam weapons we can use(hyper), before there will be a new idea needed.    This was, I felt, an elegant choice."

So the question is really ""when will Nintendo come up with a open 3d exploration game?""  Except, in theory, that's Nintendo's goal for the WiiU entry to the Zelda franchise, more or less.

Metroid,3d2mkt,Plinkman,10,Mon Jul 13 19:31:58 2015 UTC,"Now that I think about it that's a bit sad, but it doesn't change the fact that this year was kind of a let down. Many good things were shown, but we've been waiting for a real Metroid since forever."
Metroid,3d2mkt,JeremyFitzgerald,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:34:19 2015 UTC,"He never actually apologized over it IIRC. he said he was 'hearing us' or ""listening to us"" (conext being the E3 feedback) or something similar."
Metroid,3d2mkt,henryuuk,20,Mon Jul 13 23:26:53 2015 UTC,Here is the official notification from Nintendo sent to employees.
Metroid,3d2mkt,GhostlyPixel,8,Mon Jul 13 01:10:25 2015 UTC,That feels super impersonal. If I were to die in his position I would hope the memo would be a little less spartan.
Metroid,3d2mkt,Jammintk,24,Mon Jul 13 01:45:56 2015 UTC,"That's the official documentation for archival purposes, as well as distribution to shareholders.  A more personal statement will likely be made shortly. Nintendo's got to sort out quite a few things right now."
Metroid,3d2mkt,Error400BadRequest,4,Mon Jul 13 02:36:37 2015 UTC,I suppose that is a good point. I wonder who is going to fill his shoes now. I don't see Miyamoto doing it.
Metroid,3d2mkt,Jammintk,8,Mon Jul 13 02:40:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think Miyamoto would want to do it, but I wouldn't rule it out.  He and Iwata shared a similar vision when it came to making games.   If Miyamoto feels that he must carry the torch in order to keep Nintendo going in the right direction, I'm certain he would take the position.  He would be a great leader, but I know he also wants to make games - something Iwata was largely unable to do after taking the position himself."
Metroid,3d2mkt,Error400BadRequest,9,Mon Jul 13 03:05:04 2015 UTC,I would say Reggie is ripe for the position but it unlikely they would have an American at the head of the company.
Metroid,3d2mkt,Jammintk,5,Mon Jul 13 03:28:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Reggie could probably do it, but he'd be a very tough sell for shareholders.  After all, he was the first Non-Japanese to head NoA. I think it is far too early to consider him a viable head for Nintendo HQ."
Metroid,3d2mkt,Error400BadRequest,5,Mon Jul 13 03:44:52 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I wonder about that. More so whether a non-japanese president would be less tone deaf to the fans, or at least seem less tone deaf. Nintendo has the ability to do some things to lessen the ire of fans. Perhaps offer a free first look at Prime:FF or Triforce Heroes that can be downloaded to 3ds. They've released early snapshots of games before, notably with Prime Hunters for the DS. First Hunt was the most fun I had with a multiplayer DS game until Mario Kart DS.  Ah well, speculation is all well and good, but I bet the new president will be someone we haven't necessarily heard a lot from in the past."
Metroid,3d2mkt,Jammintk,9,Mon Jul 13 03:50:34 2015 UTC,Reggie doesn't speak Japanese. I imagine there could be a slight problem with the fact that the executive producer of a company doesn't speak the same language as any of its main branch employees.
Metroid,3d2mkt,WhatIsThatThing,5,Mon Jul 13 04:09:37 2015 UTC,the only reasonable thing we can hope for is nintendo of america gains more freedom like in the 90s to form new dev teams and start games without oversight from japan
Metroid,3d2mkt,majorasmaskfan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:24:35 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'm pretty sure no one is mad about TH. Zelda fans have a lot to look forward to. FF, on the other hand, is probably all we Metroid fans get for the 30th anniversary after years of waiting for a new game.  EDIT: So it's definitely FF that Nintendo needs to try to prove isn't actually that bad."
Metroid,3d2mkt,BlockyAnubis,2,Mon Jul 13 15:01:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not looking forward to TH at all. There's very little chance I will be able to meet up with exactly two other people to play it multiplayer, and it looks like it won't be much fun single player."
Metroid,3d2mkt,Jammintk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:25:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think Miyamoto is too old to be a CEO. Same with Genyo Takeda; they're both in their mid 60's. I honestly can't think of who would be a good CEO. Everyone is so old in Nintendo that finding a person to lead the company for years sounds very difficult."
Metroid,3d2mkt,flamingviper3175,38,Mon Jul 13 07:03:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's something I never expected to happen. He, in my eyes, was the father of Nintendo. Very sad to hear he's passed. I can only hope that he lived a good life and that the company as a whole will carry on well."
Metroid,3d2mkt,nihilinth,10,Mon Jul 13 01:08:51 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you knew this, but Nintendo itself is well over a century old. He was certainly one of the most important players in the history of the company though"
Metroid,3d2mkt,PhazonZim,18,Mon Jul 13 04:09:38 2015 UTC,he was only 55 man :/ this is literally the first im hearing of any health issues that he's had  im sad
Metroid,3d2mkt,legonro,8,Mon Jul 13 01:22:56 2015 UTC,He wasn't at E3 this year in person due to his health issues. He had surgery soon after and said on twitter soon after that he was progressing well in his recovery. Sad to see him go.
Metroid,3d2mkt,Jammintk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:44:18 2015 UTC,"That was last year's E3. This year he didn't go because (according the Nintendo), he was busy with other business dealings at the home front, and decided that the away team could handle it."
Metroid,3d2mkt,henryuuk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:30:29 2015 UTC,"You are correct. I suppose I was misreading the story. In any case, the illness isn't really new news, but it is still sad to see him go."
Metroid,3d2mkt,Jammintk,15,Mon Jul 13 23:37:09 2015 UTC,"This is a crushing blow to the industry and his shoes are essentially unfillable. Between helping code games like Kirby, compressing the data in Pokemon Gold and Silver so that an entire second game in Kanto could be added, and helping Melee get released ahead of schedule, his hands-on policies created ripple effects that defined the future of Nintendo in a big way. He may have had some odd approaches to things like marketing sometimes but he was nothing short of a giant."
Metroid,3d2mkt,The_M4G,8,Mon Jul 13 02:34:56 2015 UTC,Oh man... I go to sleep for one hour.
Metroid,3d2mkt,twinfyre,10,Mon Jul 13 01:34:36 2015 UTC,I too feel that we have lost someone truly brilliant. The world will greatly miss this terrific individual. I only hope that Nintendo does not suffer due to him no longer being involved.
Metroid,3d2mkt,jbs4bmx,8,Mon Jul 13 02:38:10 2015 UTC,I was worried when he didn't appear in person at E3 but I had really hoped I was wrong. I'm really going to miss him in future Nintendo Directs.
Metroid,3d2mkt,ButteredCopPorn,6,Mon Jul 13 02:56:16 2015 UTC,That's when it will really hit me that he's gone. Whenever there was a Nintendo Direct you can guarantee that he was gonna be in it for the first half of it before Nintendo of America took the second half.
Metroid,3d2mkt,nihilinth,6,Mon Jul 13 06:08:15 2015 UTC,"It pisses me off to read from several posts that they blame the Metroid fans for killing Iwata due to the very negative and even hateful reception of Federation Force.  They also claim, and this I could believe, that Iwata's last public statement was an apology for the way Federation Force was presented at E3."
Metroid,3d2mkt,wreckingcanon,11,Mon Jul 13 04:03:15 2015 UTC,"I don't care what anyone says, and I love the real Metroid games with a passion, but if I'm being totally honest, Bionicle Metroid 4 Kidz and Metroid Prime Air Hockey as developed by Next Level games sounds like it's going to be a genuinely fun diversion/spinoff to prove that Nintendo hasn't forgotten about the franchise and wants to re-drum up interest in it with a younger generation."
Metroid,3d2mkt,bigsphinxofquartz,7,Mon Jul 13 05:17:05 2015 UTC,"Bionicle    Don't you dare bring that up. I still haven't forgiven Lego for replacing that deep, engrossing world with Hero Factory. Especially since it uses some of the same parts!"
Metroid,3d2mkt,LifeWulf,5,Mon Jul 13 13:15:44 2015 UTC,"I thought I was the only one who appreciated just how awesome Bionicle was! I always thought that Bionicle had huge untapped potential in a lot of things, including video games, but it was sadly never fully realized.  The reboot isn't very impressive either..."
Metroid,3d2mkt,BlockyAnubis,3,Mon Jul 13 15:11:31 2015 UTC,"Did you read the comics? They had such good stories, and the ending was never fully resolved. However, it's around somewhere on the Internet in text form. I have read it, but I can't remember much right now."
Metroid,3d2mkt,LifeWulf,4,Mon Jul 13 16:29:24 2015 UTC,"The lore is my favorite part of Bionicle! I have copies of several of the comics, too.  EDIT: It's been a long while since I've read any."
Metroid,3d2mkt,BlockyAnubis,2,Mon Jul 13 17:58:16 2015 UTC,I still have a bunch of the comics going to around the time the Rahkshi were around

I'm considering picking it up on Wii U VC just so I don't have to use a Wii Remote/Classic Controller combo and use the GamePad exclusively as a screen.  Fusion plays fine. I don't really have a problem with the D Pad, but you may have issue with it if you don't like the D Pad on the GamePad.  I'd love to switch weapons using ZR instead of reaching over to the select button. Might be worth it just for that."
Metroid,3d67w0,wildfire359,2,Mon Jul 13 22:49:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah it feels more natural to use ZR as weapon switch, it's probably my favourite feature from the Wii U version. But using the gamepad as a screen is no doubt another huge benefit."

On this Metroid note, I would like to add... I usually dislike older games. Usually dislike 2D games in general. Super Metroid is now my #1 favorite game of all time. Ever.

Metroid,3d304v,pueojit,5,Mon Jul 13 03:45:56 2015 UTC,"I agree. There was a lot of criticism for it being too difficult and having an annoying ammo system but it was everything Prime was and more.  They somehow made the graphics even better, the art direction was phenomenal, the OST was fantastic, and the gameplay and story were some of the best for the time.  And it had Dark Samus, one of the coolest villains in a video game IMO."

Metroid,3d304v,ButteredCopPorn,5,Mon Jul 13 17:52:55 2015 UTC,"People have trouble with the ammo system? ...how? If you use the light beam, the game throws massive amounts of dark ammo at you, and vice-versa. There's even a way to use the beams if you somehow run out of ammo entirely."
Metroid,3d304v,ButteredCopPorn,2,Mon Jul 13 07:58:41 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest problem was during boss battles where the ammo is very limited, like vs the final boss."
Metroid,3d304v,txcrnr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:09:24 2015 UTC,"Strange, I used the Sonic Boom (Annihilator Beam charge combo) on the last form of Emperor Ing and it worked well for me. It's frustrating when you do run out, but there are still ways of getting back ammo."
Metroid,3d304v,kotb,2,Mon Jul 13 23:52:39 2015 UTC,"Well, dark samus gives no ammo at all"
Metroid,3d304v,txcrnr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:48:31 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I haven't fought the final boss in a long time and don't remember it clearly. I didn't complete my last playthrough beyond the final search for keys. That said, I don't recall having trouble with running out of ammunition at any point, but maybe it could be a problem for others, especially those doing a low % run."

Metroid,3d304v,ButteredCopPorn,3,Wed Jul 15 03:05:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly this. I see people give it grief and I scratch my head. It's pretty much the height of the 3d Metroid formula."
Metroid,3d304v,The_M4G,2,Mon Jul 13 22:20:26 2015 UTC,"I loved echoes too, but not as much as Prime. I think that contributes a bit to it being overlooked. I know personally I was hoping for it to be as good as Prime and I didn't enjoy it as much but still loved it a lot. Very few games hit the sweet spot when redesigning an environment that you traverse again, and echoes did very well. I think it's my third favorite in the series behind Super and Prime, and really probably is in my top 15-20 favorite games ever."
Metroid,3d304v,sgrantcarr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:00:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly my thoughts. Both were great, but I liked Prime 1's more ""natural"" feel the most. Still enjoyed 2 and am enjoying 3 now"
Metroid,3d304v,poopnuts,2,Tue Jul 14 03:27:03 2015 UTC,"I'm playing Prime 2 right now for the first time and really enjoying it, even more than Prime. I'm not having any issues with ammo. Sure, it's a bit limited at first but the only places you really need to use it are on the doors and portals and it's easy enough to replenish it. I really like the Dark/Light world mechanic. Reminds me of ALttP.  I don't know if my head was just in a weird place but Prime left a weird impression on me. I'll have to go back and play it again. Can't wait to start Prime 3!"
Metroid,3d304v,sgrantcarr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:56:55 2015 UTC,"Prime 3 feels very... different than the first two. It lacks that feeling of isolation. To me anyways. Still very fun, though. I'm near the end now, I believe."
Metroid,3d304v,GhostlyPixel,5,Tue Jul 14 03:25:09 2015 UTC,"Echoes was my favorite, but oh my god was it easy to get lost. If I didn't have an old Prima guide for the GameCube version when I played through it on the Wii for my first time it would have been a much more frustrating play-through. Especially that final key collecting part."
Metroid,3d304v,PhazonTuxedo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:54:14 2015 UTC,"Echoes is the most difficult Metroid IMO, especially early-game. I feel that Prime 1 is better designed, but I still like echoes more for having the best suit design, most interesting weapons, required higher difficulty for those that are good at the other primes, Dark Samus, and a more threatening antagonist.  Now, imagine the Dark or Light suit with Phazon Suit colors."
Metroid,3d304v,lastpally,7,Fri Jul 17 01:59:13 2015 UTC,For me Metroid Prime: Hunters. I loved that game. Sure it wasn't anywhere near as great as Prime or Echoes but Hunters was fun. Plus I did enjoy the soundtrack and cutscenes.
Metroid,3d304v,poopnuts,3,Tue Jul 14 14:58:18 2015 UTC,"I think it's a tie between Echoes, Corruption, and Fusion, because IMO they are every bit as good as Super and Prime."
Metroid,3d304v,sgrantcarr,3,Mon Jul 13 14:47:27 2015 UTC,"The exploration and upgrades in Fusion were great (as with any Metroid) but the thing that really got on my nerves was how hard the bosses hit. They always seemed to take off anywhere from 1/2 to 2 energy tanks per hit and it just felt cheap. Also, getting 100% felt nigh impossible unless you spent time mastering the timing and moves required to collect some of the expansions. I guess that's good for people who really do love a challenge but the difficulty in Fusion just felt off due to those two things and left me not really wanting to play it again."
Metroid,3d304v,joe_copp,6,Mon Jul 13 22:09:18 2015 UTC,IMO Fusion is only very difficult during the first playthrough.
Metroid,3d304v,sgrantcarr,2,Mon Jul 13 23:31:23 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. I played fusion when I was probably about 12 or 13 and struggled to beat it over weeks. Went back and played it through a week or two ago (23 years old now), and really enjoyed it. The ONLY part I've ever had to Google in a Metroid game was during that play-through though. Right before you unlock the red LVL4 doors, when you're in the AQA water sector. There's a spot where you have to morph ball roll through a wall. You don't break it or anything, its just an intangible wall you roll behind. Completely unassuming. I walked back and forth on that spot for an hour and a half trying to figure out what to do before I gave up and Googled it. Thought it was kinda cheap to put that there. I set off plenty of morph ball bombs near it, and when it didn't disappear, I assumed there was nothing. Oh well, loved every part of it but that!"
Metroid,3d304v,Glitch1500,2,Tue Jul 14 03:36:09 2015 UTC,I remember my brother had to go buy the player's guide in order to get to the level 4 security room.

Metroid,3d304v,Glitch1500,2,Wed Jul 15 12:47:49 2015 UTC,"I thought I had broke the game and gotten into the water area too early, although I think that a lot in Metroid games... took me a good half an hour to go back and try everything before I realized it was a bit you could roll through."
Metroid,3d304v,sgrantcarr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:59:42 2015 UTC,"I was so dreading having to start over, too. I was half mad that there was no indication of a place to roll through, and half relieved that I didn't have to restart."
Metroid,3d304v,malicious-monkey,2,Wed Jul 15 17:50:26 2015 UTC,Finding and figuring out that area was probably the highlight of the game for me in terms of feeling like a badass!

Metroid,3d304v,Shakazulu94,2,Tue Jul 14 03:38:07 2015 UTC,"Definitely Metroid II: Return of Samus. I played that awhile ago and man it was good... I mean it didn't have color or anything but it was still amazing and felt really metroid-y. Got a good 7 hours of Metroid goodness out of it. I don't even like colorless gameboy games generally, it just felt good. Definitely not the best Metroid, but it had lots of good stuff in it."
Metroid,3d304v,wolfen24,2,Tue Jul 14 18:58:02 2015 UTC,It's gonna be Hunters for me. Singleplayer wasn't good but it didn't take a shit on the series. The multiplayer showed me that Nintendo could bring Metroid and arena multiplayer together and have it not feel weird.
Metroid,3d304v,txcrnr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:44:16 2015 UTC,Honestly... (bracing self for disagreement)... prime pinball. It was fun as hell and the table designs were fan-freaking-tastic!!! Loved it!!

Metroid,3d304v,sgrantcarr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:37:35 2015 UTC,"In my unpopular opinion, I think Other M is super underrated. Yeah the game was short, really short compared to other games in the series, especially the prime series but it did a fantastic job of telling more of the story in Samus' life and expanding upon the relationship between Samus and Adam that was introduced in Fusion."
Metroid,3d304v,BlockyAnubis,6,Sun Jul 19 04:04:11 2015 UTC,"It's the most praised Metroid, though"
Metroid,3d1n55,plasmabeamonline,14,Sun Jul 12 20:02:50 2015 UTC,"Something that I've always found clever about this scene. Notice how for a brief moment there's a closeup of Dark Samus' hand as she opens it from a fist? The first time we see Dark Samus, we see Her hand as it closes into a fist It's basically a ""book end"" to Dark Samus' whole story arc."
Metroid,3d1n55,twinfyre,9,Mon Jul 13 01:30:43 2015 UTC,"The only thing that bothered me in the Prime series was that eye, they never expanded on that in the other games."
Metroid,3d1n55,Virus64,10,Mon Jul 13 02:10:18 2015 UTC,"I can't cite a source on this, but I think at the end of prime 2 the eye is visible on DS's hand.   edit aparently it's not entirely gone. Dark Samus does have a eye on each side of her morph ball."
Metroid,3d1n55,twinfyre,3,Mon Jul 13 03:25:44 2015 UTC,It's more than likely that it was a design that got canned while making prime 2. They probably thought plastering eyeballs all over DS would be too Resident Evil
Metroid,3d1n55,thegreathobbyist,10,Mon Jul 13 15:24:22 2015 UTC,"Because apparently being trapped inside a collapsing dimension isn't fatal, but being shot a bunch is, especially when you're inside a giant brain."
Metroid,3d1n55,2CATteam,6,Sun Jul 12 20:25:32 2015 UTC,Referring to the end of Echoes with the collapsing dimension bit?
Metroid,3d1n55,2CATteam,5,Sun Jul 12 20:32:44 2015 UTC,Yeah.
Metroid,3d1n55,RidleySmashBros,5,Sun Jul 12 21:37:05 2015 UTC,"It was an underwhelming end to the whole Metroid Prime/Dark Samus saga. She got way more messed up in Echoes like you mentioned. What exactly about possessing the Aurora Unit caused her to die? Or maybe Samus's Phazon Beam from the PED suit was just too much of a Phazon overload for DS?  In Prime, the essence of Metroid Prime/Dark Samus was only able to be damaged while Samus was standing in a pool of Phazon. I'm thinking that the Phazon beam she used in that fight was weaker than the Phazon Beam from the PED Suit.  In Echoes, Dark Samus's final form could only be damaged after Samus' charge beam absorbed the Phazon particles Dark Samus pelted at her and shot them back. This was probably a weak Phazon Beam compared to Corruption Phazon beam also.  So in Corruption, Samus is able to use the PED Suit and harness the Phazon produced by her body as weaponary. So in a way, Dark Samus screwed herself by corrupting Samus with Phazon. And Samus is on Phaaze, the source of all of the Phazon in the universe and her Phazon Beam via Hyper Mode was probably way too much Phazon than even Dark Samus could handle.  R.I.P. Dark Samus. I wanted you to still be alive but now that I'm thinking about all of this... it doesn't seem likely."
Metroid,3d1n55,metroidmariomega,3,Mon Jul 13 14:00:06 2015 UTC,"I think in MP3, she died just like she did in Echoes (just scattered instead of completly destroyed), but because Aurora Unit was destroyed (and it was symbiotically connected to the planet Phaaze), Phaaze also got destroyed, which means all Phazon will vanish as well and in MP3, Dark Samus is pure Phazon (""Phazon energy-based entity"" and ""Target is composed of pure Phazon energy""). So, it makes sense for Dark Samus to die permanently this time."
Metroid,3d1n55,IrishLink,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:26:59 2015 UTC,"To add to this dark samus was vulnerable to being overloaded by phazon based weaponry, which is the only way you can attack her since samus is locked in hypermode.   To quote the scan of her: ""Morphology: Dark Samus. Phazon energy-based entity. Disrupted by Hypermode attacks. Target is composed of pure Phazon energy and is highly unstable. Scans indicate that Hypermode attacks are capable of disrupting her, likely a result of Hypermode being energized by Samus's body."""
Metroid,3d07r5,RebeccaETripp,13,Sun Jul 12 11:31:55 2015 UTC,does her cannon seem a little out of place?
Metroid,3d07r5,Rekwiiem,12,Sun Jul 12 17:21:49 2015 UTC,It's also on the wrong arm.
Metroid,3d07r5,HJK148,5,Sun Jul 12 19:22:03 2015 UTC,Why does this happen so often?

Metroid,3d07r5,TheStills,5,Mon Jul 13 06:41:00 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty interesting interpretation of Samus' arm cannon, the obvious amputation of her arm leads to some interesting character building - did she lose her arm during Ridleys' attack on her homeworld? Was it a necessary part of her gaining the power suit? Did it happen during a mission, and she since adapted her previous weapon (or made a new one) into an attachment for her suit?  I like the possibilities of the first idea, makes her vendetta against Ridley and the Space Pirates all that more personal."
Metroid,3d07r5,joe_copp,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:10:20 2015 UTC,I always interpreted it as a voluntary part of her augmentation.

Metroid,3d29qj,OffWhiteDonkus,7,Mon Jul 13 00:23:45 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I respect you for standing by your opinion regardless of popular opinion. Thanks for sharing :D"
Metroid,3d29qj,wayoverpaid,2,Mon Jul 13 00:26:47 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Super Metroid could do with a minor remake which makes wall jumping a bit less fiddly and more natural, and makes the diagonal aiming close to fusion.  Though I appreciate how some people really like all the little nuances for speedrunning, but to just play the game is can be very frustrating until you get the hang of it."
Metroid,3d29qj,metroidman388,5,Tue Jul 14 03:05:35 2015 UTC,"I used to think the same thing, as I played the GBA games before Super.  However, after watching speedruns for the game, learning some of the tricks and the overall route, I actually vastly prefer it's controls to ZM (Fusion's controls are inferior to ZM's IMO because you can't infinite wall jump up a single wall).  Once you know what movement options are possible in Super, it starts to feel much faster and much more nuanced than ZM.  Granted there are some improvements in ZM that I miss (restarting a spin jump, a more intuitive wall jump timing, restoring speed booster from shine sparks).  It is a longer learning curve to get the muscle memory needed to dash, jump and shoot simultaneously in Super, but once that happens it's hard to give up that level of control."
Metroid,3d29qj,Butter_Is_Life,3,Mon Jul 13 01:00:14 2015 UTC,"It almost feels like the difference between Smash Bros. titles. Super Metroid feels strange, but there's a lot of technicality to its movement options that I can appreciate (even if I don't quite...enjoy it). Zero Mission and Fusion are more streamlined, user-friendly, and less ""heavy"", but also less technical.  Then again, I prefer Smash 4 over every other Smash game, just as I do with Fusion/Zero Mission over Super, mainly for those reasons of streamlined controls."
Metroid,3d29qj,kenzy_5g,3,Mon Jul 13 23:01:38 2015 UTC,"...You know what? I might actually agree here. I, too, played fusion and zero mission before super metroid."

I didn't feel as acrobatic in Fusion as I did Super."
Metroid,3d29qj,wayoverpaid,6,Tue Jul 14 03:47:20 2015 UTC,"I don't usually bother with the original Metroid, because I could just play Zero Mission.  Hunters is kinda meh too.  It feels like a Metroid Mod for Quake, not like a Metroid game."

Metroid,3d29qj,Weltall548,6,Mon Jul 13 04:59:07 2015 UTC,"Man, I was looking back at the history of the franchise and realized a few things... would it be accurate to say that there aren't that many EXCEPTIONALLY good Metroid games? The only ones that come to mind as being almost universally loved by all fans are Super Metroid, Prime 1, Zero Mission, and, to a lesser extent, Fusion.   Looking back and being critical... -Metroid 1 didn't age very well and is overly cryptic -Metroid 2 is too linear and could have benefitted to having a map. ~50 Metroid minibosses gets old fast so AM2R doesn't really save this game for me. -Hunters only really excelled as a multiplayer game -Prime 2, to many, had very bland environments, turned people off from the beam mechanics and dark world, and generally felt like a lower quality Prime 1. -Prime 3 was very linear in nature, and simplified the formula by turning lots of the game into a shooting range with little Metroid(vania) elements. -Other M was polarizing in terms of storytelling, an unintuitive control scheme, level design, and characterization.  It's not fun to look at one of my favourite franchises that way, but I have to call it as it is; our library is relatively small...  What do you guys think?"
Metroid,3d29qj,TestZero,3,Mon Jul 13 00:07:21 2015 UTC,"Most Metroids are exceptionally good, including Prime 2 and 3. The only truely bland environment in 2 is Agon, and the game is just as polished, detailed, and fun as Prime 1. 3 is more linear, but still had plenty of exploration, and it is a huge exaggeration to call the game a ""Shooting Range"". I'd give Super, Fuson, Prime, Prime 2, and Prime 3 a 10/10. Metroid has more Flawless games than any franchise."

Metroid Fusion  After playing Metroid Prime, Zero Mission and finally Super Metroid, I needed more and hoped to find that in Fusion. What I wanted was more exploration, more getting lost and figuring out how an area is constructed by wandering aimlessly, more loneliness and isolation.  What I got was obligatory talks with a computer that told me exactly where to go, an emotional Samus missing her old captain, and an art style that felt childish compared to Zero Mission.  No, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, and it's by no means a bad game. But it's FAR below Super, Zero Mission and the Prime series for me. I get that they wanted to shake up the formula, but it didn't work for me."

Metroid,3d1ioz,flaahgra012,2,Sun Jul 12 20:28:03 2015 UTC,Have you heard the full version of the Flaahgra fight music? I played the original NTSC Metroid Prime and apparently they shortened the music in that version. For years I thought it was this minimalistic version:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWkcZv9DEac  But then I found out about the full version:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhnrH30411A  Sounds awesome.

Gandrayda's theme was an interesting mix of upbeat pieces and ones indicating tension that really made the Gandrayda fight feel like more than a mash-up of enemies you'd already killed.  I've never fought Flaaghra with the proper theme. I'll probably end up buying Trilogy just to do it.  Darkness (Dark Samus) really does a good job of conveying that Dark Samus is everything you are while simultaneously conveying that she's everything you aren't."

Ing fight music was hauntingly good.  There are so many good boss and combat songs though. I feel like the music in the Prime series was so well composed so it's hard to narrow it down to just one song."
Metroid,3d1ioz,plasmabeamonline,3,Sun Jul 12 19:55:49 2015 UTC,Omega Pirate really does an excellent job of making you feel like you're fighting something massive and insanely powerful.  Ing theme just seems less interesting than most boss themes in echoes IMO.

While I'm glad Capcom is making all this Mega Man merch and making a bunch of cameos happen, keeping him in the public eye and such, to me it's basically lip service. More specifically, I see it as Capcom trying to make amends after the abysmal 25th noniversary Mega Man had (heh, something it has in common with Metroid.)  Merch is great, but there still hasn't been a new Mega Man game since Mega Man 10 in 2010. The X series has been dormant since 2004 (not counting rereleases), and the Legends series... well, let's not even get into the Legends series.  With Metroid, we know there's a game beyond the horizon. I with Mega Man, I only see a mountain of merch capitalizing on nostalgia."

It was risk that so far has had some blowback, but I'd rather Nintendo try and fail than not try at all.   The only thing Mega Man Is getting within the next year is another collection game. That tells me that capcom, at best, is trying to see if there's any interest left in Mega Man (beyond people who became fans in the 80s and 90s) before deciding to make a new game and at worst, has no idea what to do with the series now that the series' main creative force is off working on other projects like MN09 and Red Ash."

I can play those games, and id love a new one, but why bother making one if it's gonna be the same shit as the last ones?  Also - is it really so difficult for people to understand that they aren't the target audience? Hell, if this game appeals to younger gamers, that could mean more brand recognition for Metroid and more fans, resulting in another Metroid game selling better than they normally do  But no, it isn't what I want, so everyone who has worked on it should be fucking ashamed and throw away all the work they've done because I signed a petition... that Mega64 video was spot on"

I don't think the game will be cancelled, nor do I think they'll spend the time and money to throw out the work they have and start anew  You can say what you like, but seriously, if FF sells well despite all the backlash from Metroid fans, that means they took a previously (relatively) poorly selling franchise and just made a ton of money off it - they're not going to suddenly say ""oh my god, they were right, why did we ever make this horrible game that made us a shitload of money???""  You're putting words in my mouth, really - not once did I say it WAS GOING to do well, I'm saying that if it DOES, they won't give a shit what the majority of Metroid fans think, because Metroid fans are such a tiny overall group in the long run for Nintendo that they will not lose sleep over angering that niche group if it ends up reviving the Metroid name and making them money"

Metroid,3cxv4v,Wind123,7,Sat Jul 11 19:27:41 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on all your points; it's baffling how Nintendo's completely ignoring the massive potential of a post-Fusion game.  We Metroid fans have essentially been led along by an 13 year cliffhanger.  Where's the resolution of that story?  What will become of Samus?  A post-Fusion story is so ripe for new storylines, characters, and character development etc. especially considering how Samus is now a fugitive on the run from the Galactic Federation.  Yet Nintendo seems to be focused on giving us spin-offs and in-between games, not a continuation of Fusion's storyline.  A lot of us even want a Prime 4.  Not me, though.  Prime's story is done, and while the trilogy is a fantastic addition to the Metroid series, it should be left alone so the franchise can get a breath of fresh air.  Your idea for a post-Fusion game sounds a lot like mine, actually.  I agree that Anthony Higgs should return; he was one of the few redeeming qualities of Other M, and their partnership/friendship has a lot of room to be explored in a future game.  My idea for a post-Fusion game, involving the both of them, would go something like this:  A little while after the events of Fusion, Samus is attacked by the Federation, overwhelmed, and taken into custody as punishment for the destruction of the BSL station.  The GF removes her suit (nearly killing her) and, unbeknownst to her, take blood samples from her body (even after the events of Fusion, she still carries remnants of metroid DNA within her) in order to restart the metroid breeding program.  They also attempt to reverse-engineer her power suit to mass-produce and outfit their soldiers with; they fail to replicate it completely, but create a close-enough copy.  After a while in custody, Samus is able to escape her confinement, thanks a surprise attack on the facility by a newly-returned space pirate army, who uses a stolen shipment of Metroids to attack the Federation and the civilian populace.  Samus escapes during the ensuing chaos and attempts to find Anthony, who has since retired from the Federation after the events of Other M.  Being her only friend and ally in her situation, he reluctantly agrees to help her.  As Samus tracks down and locates GF-owned metroid breeding facilities on a variety of planets, Anthony can use his credentials to allow Samus to infiltrate the facilities and destroy the metroids within.  Meanwhile, the GF has recently captured Sylux for his crimes against the Federation.  However, with Samus, their most important target, having escaped, they offer Sylux a chance at freedom if he hunts down and captures her (his story can be retconned into having a more personal grudge against Samus, rather than him hating her by association with the GF).  They outfit him with their most advanced prototype of her reverse-engineered power suit; he makes his own modifications to the suit so he appears more distinctly Sylux.  He then tracks Samus across planets, and attacks her throughout her mission to destroy the metroid breeding facilities.  He can even become increasingly rogue against the GF, at points openly defying their orders out of resentment.  Sorry for the wall of text, but that's how I'd like the story of a post-Fusion game to progress.  Regardless, we need a Fusion sequel badly, and hopefully Nintendo delivers soon!"
Metroid,3cxv4v,frozen_coffee,3,Sun Jul 12 02:56:25 2015 UTC,"I dig it. Early run ins with Sylux could be like encounters with SA-X (which everybody seems to remember fondly from Fusion), until you are powerful/power-up'd enough to take Sylux head on... or dont if you go the path of the anti-hero."
Metroid,3cxv4v,Belovedstump,5,Mon Jul 13 16:10:03 2015 UTC,"A lot of people don't seem to like the idea of a post-Fusion game because they picture Samus fighting lots of boring infantry but generic soldiers wouldn't be able to fight Samus. The Feds would have to invent new stuff to get the job done and that's where things get interesting.   The Federation has some pretty big advantages over the space pirates: they've had multiple opportunities to analyze the armor up close, they know exactly what the suit is capable of, they've made more progress in recreating or at least understanding many of Samus' abilities, and as of Fusion they have no enemies besides her.  It's only a matter of time before a lightbulb appears over the head of some Federation engineer and they figure out how to develop counter-measures to her abilities. That's an alarming prospect.  Remember how scary Nightmare was in Fusion? What if he was just the tip of the iceberg? What kind of horrible supertech would they be coming after you with? What happens when the tech gap shrinks and the Varia suit is no longer hot shit?  That's why I still think a post-Fusion game could be interesting."

Metroid,3cyoda,wayoverpaid,6,Sun Jul 12 06:55:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't even think they should have kept the name for the trilogy. I'd rather the games be called Metroid Prime, Metroid Echoes and Metroid Corruption."

There's a real gap in the market for first-person metroidvania games so perhaps this could start to fill this gap when it's finished :)
Metroid,3cx2ij,PointZ3RO,5,Sat Jul 11 15:27:00 2015 UTC,Here's a very early look at the game.

Metroid,3cx2ij,Ram64,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:37:07 2015 UTC,Inquire away whenever you'd like.
Metroid,3cx2ij,JerseyCobra,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:10:49 2015 UTC,"I'm home from work and ready for unscheduled inquiry.  First of all the helmet HUD looks really good, very sleek and very Metroid. Can you help me better understand how the run ability will fit into your project? In a prime game a run ability would take away focus from the environmental storytelling and the player would lose some immersion in the exploration department; making small spaces seem smaller and missing important details. That said this isn't a prime game and you can bend the rules. I'd like to know more about the union of allied worlds, probably still a lot to flesh out with them but its really interesting to me. In Metroid prime's prologue frigate Orpheon hosts a number of creatures Samus will encounter on Tallon IV, this is incredibly effective foreshadowing and plays into the whole exploration theme. We're also faced with massive foreboding that sets the tone for much of the game starting with the scan reports of the parasite queens victims. Are you planning on incorporating anything similar in solitude? Other common design ideologies in Metroid games are civilization vs technology and elementally based environments will you continue these traditions or are you planning to make variations here and there in these areas? Are you planning to use a lock on feature? Are you planning on using sprites or full out models?  If you don't mind I'd like to plot out some silhouettes of Kiera and develop them into a painting to help with the modelling, are you working with any references?  Finally the question I've been too excited to ask, what do you actually want/need done (as far as concept art goes)?   Sorry for asking so much I realize its still very early in the game, Metroid prime was the reason I got into art so in a way I've been waiting for exactly this."
Metroid,3cx2ij,TommygunPT,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:12:16 2015 UTC,"Hey, don't worry about asking. This is the exact reason I'm making development public. I want to get help and to be able to bounce ideas off of people. So running is something I added when I was originally working on the engine itself. I was also thinking about it and whether or not I want it. I do want to have fast-paced combat (faster than in Prime) so the ability to run would help in that regard. Still a bit undecided and I'll leave it for now as it's really too soon to tell if it will be a good addition or not. The UAW is kind of like my version of the Federation. You will only be communicating with one other member of the UAW (your dispatcher, Baker) and only when you are near your ship. The story will include high levels of iron on the asteroid whose magnetic field is messing with communications so you'll only be able to talk to him when you return to your ship (he'll give hints throughout the game so the player can figure stuff out for themselves or make the long trek back to the ship to get some insight from Baker). SPOILER ALERT The UAW will be discovered to be behind the communications failures of the mining crew and will be working with the enemy force you'll discover present on the asteroid. At the end of the game, I plan on having you and Baker having to run from the UAW. As far as foreshadowing, there will be computer terminals in the game's most early area where you'll be able to see some of the logs of the mining crew which will be the storytelling mechanic (you'll find terminals and logs along the way as well as scannable items). For the game's areas, yes, I am planning elemental themes. To give you a good idea of how I'm planning this, it will go like this (sequence-wise): Landing area on asteroid's surface (where the game begins) -> Miner's living quarters (central hub for the other game areas) and where foreshadowing will occur) -> Caverns (rock based and most ""boring"" area) -> Asteroid core (think Magmoor caverns) -> Undecided (don't know what theme I want yet as it will depend on where I want to go with the story) -> Enemy's ship (final boss encounter will take place here). No lock-on feature is planned (I feel that if I'm making the game for PC, then I may as well take advantage of FPS controls). I still don't know if I will use 2d sprites (ala DOOM) or full 3d models. I may even go with a mix (using pre-rendered sprites like from the original Killer Instinct for SNES). It really depends on how much help I get and the skill/talent/time limitations of the people working with me. I'm no artist myself... I don't mind if you want to work on Keira. I actually did already start modeling: http://imgur.com/a/776Yn but I still need her in her armor. As far as needing concept art, I need everything! I actually have lots of offers from various people and I'm trying to get everything organized so it's not a massive chaos. I'm organizing some shared files in Google Drive so that we can all get on the same page: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B6TCsrHLjxSmfmZ3VFB5WnZ6dnBYSWVscEJjQXlMWUFuNG9ENlVjOHBja2w1QlZPLV82bkU&usp=sharing.

Justin Bailey is a coincidence. It's a perfectly ordinary, valid password which just so happens to A) have the correct checksum and B) actually have some useful settings. You can play around with a Metroid password generator -- they'll all show you which bits correspond to Justin Bailey, and by flipping bits you can end up with tons of slight variations of it (stuff like ZUSTIN BAILEY ------ -----7).

Metroid,3cvm5q,TotakaK,20,Sat Jul 11 03:41:59 2015 UTC,I think Ridley not being in Prime 2 was a good thing. He doesn't need to be in every game. (and neither does the shine-spark to you out there making fan-games)
Metroid,3cvm5q,FriendFrog,2,Sat Jul 11 04:10:00 2015 UTC,B-but a games not good if you can't sequence break!
Metroid,3cvm5q,thegreathobbyist,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:27:42 2015 UTC,Is it really sequence breaking if you get an ability specifically programmed for the purpose of doing it?  Especially if it's specifically used for that purpose in basically every game in the series that has it.
Metroid,3cvm5q,tccrist,12,Thu Jul 16 23:34:40 2015 UTC,He doesn't fit into the game at all. The pirate operation is very low key and high command thought about abandoning it. There would be no need for him to go to Aether.

Metroid,3cvm5q,Elusive2000,2,Sat Jul 11 19:11:50 2015 UTC,They probably have an entire division of pirate scientists dedicated solely to bringing their leaders back to life over and over!

Metroid,3ctnqc,Jpriest09,14,Fri Jul 10 18:06:22 2015 UTC,"I've always felt that a game set post-Fusion should focus on a more thoughtful, cunning X.  I mean the Federation was the one who did the surgery on Samus, injecting her with Metroid DNA.  You know they kept some copies of the X around.  Some of that X gets out, and starts infecting high ranking members of the Federation.  They already have cause to want to take Samus down, given what she did in Fusion.  But as the hunter, bearer of Chozo and Metroid DNA, and sworn enemy of the X, it's no shock that they want her dead.  So Samus has to go to ground, hunted by the Federation who is controlled by the X.  To figure out how to eradicate the X for once and for all she'll need to find a Chozo homeworld, maybe the Chozo homeworld, solve the mystery of where the Chozo disappeared to, and find a cure to the X."
Metroid,3ctnqc,wayoverpaid,2,Fri Jul 10 19:23:44 2015 UTC,Nothing would make me happier than figuring out the mystery of what happened to the Chozo. I need this.
Metroid,3ctnqc,sgrantcarr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:01:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, from a storytelling perspective it's also necessary, because Metroid is about exploration.  However Samus is, post-Fusion, a fugitive.  Therefore Samus really needs to go to ground somewhere where she can't be chased, at least not immediately.  From there the story flows.  Plus it helps explain all the architecture being perfectly designed for Samus' suit to unlock.  It was made for her."
Metroid,3ctnqc,wayoverpaid,9,Tue Jul 14 05:16:11 2015 UTC,iirc the Metroids didn't leave SR388 voluntarily. They were captured by other species eg the Space Pirates and brought to wherever they thought they could need them.  you brought me to something interesting btw. What if the Ing were just Phazon-augmented X(-ish beings)?
Metroid,3ctnqc,AuraRyu,6,Fri Jul 10 18:41:03 2015 UTC,The X are my favorite part of the metroid universe. That idea makes me happy. I want them to be everywhere and scarier than actual metroids.
Metroid,3ctnqc,RandyK44,3,Fri Jul 10 20:23:18 2015 UTC,They actually ARE scarier than Metroids but I think focusing on beings more dangerous than the name patrons of the series is not a good idea.
Metroid,3ctnqc,AuraRyu,7,Fri Jul 10 22:39:14 2015 UTC,It would be interesting for a twist where now we have to spread the Metroids to prevent the X from taking over
Metroid,3ctnqc,meetthesharpies,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:15:02 2015 UTC,"Take it one step further: Give Samus a Metroid gun which lets her shoot Metroids instead of Super Missiles, allowing you to defeat the phazon-augmented X, but only by willingly unleashing a Metroid."
Metroid,3ctnqc,tccrist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:44:50 2015 UTC,I never thought of the Ing that way. That's pretty interesting!
Metroid,3ctnqc,BlockyAnubis,5,Fri Jul 10 21:38:40 2015 UTC,"What if the Federation (which is irredeemably corrupt) has been using Metroid derived technology to control the X? Using the X as a race of infiltrators to destroy opposition movements and cripple planets that don't embrace Federation policy. Metroids can then strip the planet clean of life and then be harvested and the life energy can be converted into life-extending drugs and consumer goods for the ""core world's"" by government backed conglomerates. The Space Pirates were funded by the Federation intelligence agencies the entire time so that they would have a convenient fall guy for their illegal and unethical research programs."
Metroid,3ctnqc,jailbot,2,Sat Jul 11 21:23:19 2015 UTC,"According to the official manga (which is actually a pretty good read), the X infiltrated the Federation a long time ago and are still posing as high-ranking members. Only the Chozo have the tech to tell if something is real or an X virus just copied it exactly. This is what galvanized them into action to make the Metroids, since no one believed them of the danger and asked them to leave the council.  It makes sense with the game cannon too. I'm pretty sure Samus wasn't aware of the virus takeover in the manga, just as she isn't in the games. But the GF keeps doing crazy stuff like cloning metroids, covert missions, cloning metroids, killing off their own, and cloning metroids.   But if the GF is made up of X viruses, why would they want more metroids? Well, think about it this way: if the X can research and control or even absorb the metroids like they do with other species, they would be unstoppable and undetectable. The whole universe would be taken over and no one would ever know."
Metroid,3ctnqc,etecoon3,2,Sat Jul 11 09:11:11 2015 UTC,"The way I read it, the Chozo were afraid of the possibility of the X mimicking high-ranking GF members. Old Bird showed his fellow Chozo Elders footage from SR388 of X infection and subsequent imitation, then presented them his solution to this danger in the form of the Metroids, which were then unleashed onto the planet, transforming and evolving over time (after Samus and her GF buddies managed to escape Mother Brain and Ridley along with the Chozo Elders). This was basically the setup for the events of Metroid 2, while the main events of the manga were focused on everything before Metroid 1/Zero Mission. Keep in mind that the Metroids being unleashed onto SR388 was at a time when said planet was still unknown to the Federation. However, since Mother Brain was involved in the creation process of the Metroids, she knew how to reproduce them on Zebes and gave them to the Space Pirates, who then continued experimentation on them.  Now in Fusion, Samus ponders the destructive potential of the X, stating that ""they're only waiting for the hunt to begin"". If the X had left the station by way of the GF troops scheduled to arrive before Samus crashed the station into the planet, eradicating whatever X were still inside the station and left on the planet, then ""galactic civilization would end"".  Moreover, it hardly seems like protocol for research on unknown species to send all available samples to one research facility only. It also forgoes any common sense. If you wanted results and you wanted them fast and efficiently, you wouldn't send all the samples to just the B.S.L. station above SR388 (a place where they could have gotten even more samples fairly easily!), but spread them across multiple research facilities and ask them to focus on different aspects (reproduction, other abilities, maybe even get samples of the Metroid vaccine and find out why exactly this worked and nothing else, what made the Metroids out to be the prime method of containing X - the original records are pretty much lost now that Mother Brain has been blown to hell twice over)."
Metroid,3ctnqc,T33p0,2,Sat Jul 11 13:22:40 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised at all, they've been bringing back a supposedly dead species for almost every game for 29 years now. At this point they probably have a whole sub division of writers dedicated to figuring out how they're gonna bring Metroids back again."

I suppose the slow, methodical approach I take to playing the game might make some parts look easier than others. I also got to be really familiar with the game while I had it for GC, too.  I probably could have done a quick playthrough of the game beforehand to unlock Hypermode difficulty, but I hadn't thought about that when I started the project. Would probably make it a fair bit more interesting to watch, in comparison to everything getting steamrolled, basically."

Metroid,3cryn2,metasponge,7,Fri Jul 10 08:01:58 2015 UTC,"Great article. It covers almost all of the same issues I have with the game.    I, however, find it baffling that they are willing to ignore the almost unanimous acclaim that every game receives upon its release in the West.   I'm worried that Nintendo might be neglecting the western audience due to nationalism/ethnocentrism. This sort of attitude is apparent with the Project HAMMER affair in which American NST developers were ""repeatedly ignored, even being told that they wouldn't understand the reasoning because 'they weren't Japanese.'"" Source.  I think Nintendo is making another attempt to win over the Japanese audience with Federation Force. This game has some similarities with the Monster Hunter games for the 3DS (mobile coop game, large monster trapping, and equipment such as healing items) which are very popular in Japan right now.   If you look at the sales numbers, the Metroid series has been selling around 10 times more copies in the West than in Japan ever since Super Metroid. If the game consistently sells better in one region over another, why fight that? I think it makes better business sense to focus on the more reliable sales demographic."
Metroid,3cryn2,Father_Brain,2,Fri Jul 10 15:43:17 2015 UTC,"Nice article! However, I don't think Castlevania deserves any credit for Metroidvania. It came well after the first Metroid, and just cloned the formula.   which helped form one half of the genre ‘metroidvania’"

The thing that Castlevania did differently is that they made the formula even more nonlinear. Nearly every ability in super helps you get other abilities, but in Symphony, you could go through the whole game and not even get half of the gear."

Like seriously the disparity between how far across her waist is compared to her hips/torso is staggering, reminds me of when I was younger reading GWR and seeing the thinnest waist person."
Metroid,3cnc68,Judedeath,0,Thu Jul 9 07:03:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah agreed, but admittedly Samus' suit has never been accustom to... real bodies. example  But Other M's design and the Smash design kinda just look like a robot Woman, not a suit of armour. It's very odd. Especially as Samus is meant to be a big woman underneath it all."
Metroid,3cnc68,Elusive2000,3,Thu Jul 9 07:06:12 2015 UTC,"Oh for sure, I'm not trying to act like this is unique to this figure, I think my favourite official art is the Nintendo Power cutaway where they were forced to make sure it at least looks like she would fit in it. The upper torso(red part) going out so far I'm fine with as long as they pay attention to the sholders/arms and have that work(the varia balls should be like huge sholder pads) as I can see having a lot of elevtronics and stuff in that part which would make it bigger, which when I see the fits a real person inside redesigns is something that bugs me, they almost always cut that part down(for example the Unreal 4 Samus model) IMO it's like a human body, a lot of the important stuff is up in the torso and that's why on the suit that part is bigger.  Looking at the figure again it's worse than I thought pose wise, I must have blocked out her standing heel to toe. WTF kind of stance is that, if they absolutly can't do an action stance  or landing crouch do a save station stance or something."
Metroid,3cnc68,indyrenegade,3,Thu Jul 9 08:09:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I like the Suit's proportions in most cases, if the arms are a little bit... abnormal, at times.

And yeah I just looked back at my Amiibo and noticed the only parts of her feet that are on the floor are her toes too. If I'm not mistaken the armour should at least weigh... something?

They might have the right to do those things, but I say don't be surprised about the Samus design given that's the most recent interpretation Nintendo has for her. It's not cool necessarily, but it's the way the cookie crumbles with Nintendo."

And even when ignoring that, they didn't ""attack"" the old samus designs, they just used the most recent. AND it was SAKURAI (and his team) who decided that, not Nintendo."

Samus has been seen in more ""elegant"" poses all the time in the Prime series. It's not all strong stances with arm cannons pointing. Ever used a save station? One aspect of Samus is that she's graceful, even in Prime. Especially in Prime.  That said, it doesn't work well for a figure because it becomes lopsided. That's a problem with all of the Smash amiibo and isn't unique to Samus. Their poses were not designed for figures."

There were rumors a couple of months ago of a new Samus amiibo pose after some people spotted some new amiibo silhouettes (Samus isnt circled but she is the pink one) in the background of one of the release videos. Here is a better look at it (right side). Some people think it's just a mistake, that Nintendo was just using artwork, while other argued that multiple Mario amiibos exist, so it shouldn't be any different for Samus.

Metroid,3cnc68,txcrnr,0,Thu Jul 9 17:12:16 2015 UTC,"It's showing her purity, her femininity, the suit presents herself in Other M as being sexulalised in comparison to the other power suit designs, and obviously when they were looking for the right iteration of Samus to use, they used her design from Other M. Not much we can do now."
Metroid,3cnc68,BlockyAnubis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:44:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and tbh the additions they made to the design really improved it. The black ridges and stuff make it feel more mechanical than the plastic looking suit from Other M.  The Design, from there, can't be helped. I just wish the pose was different, more of a fighting pose like some of the other Amiibo. Yet it just stands there... so blank..."
Metroid,3cnc68,txcrnr,3,Thu Jul 9 06:54:53 2015 UTC,"Personally i like the armor and the pose. I always thought the suit looked too bulky with impractical huge shoulders. I honestly like her other m suit cuz it looks more organic than mechanic but thats just me. It looks slim and mobile. I mean the suit itself is formed by her mentally so its not just some heavy armor. I like the pose also personally. This is the pose she enters each battle with. At first i felt that it was a little feminine, but i mean samus is a badass that just so happens to be sexy as well. I feel that this pose makes her look like shes above the other characters, freaking entering the battle like shes some kind of divine being about to tear you another one lol. I do agree there are better poses though.  On the topic of feminism, to be honest, i dont get the fuzz about the zss being oversexualized. I dont think she is at all oversexualized. She wears a skin tight suit cuz i mean what else can fit under that suit of armor? She aint showing cleavage lol. No she doesnt have gigantic racks. No shes not saying much that is sexual. Shes just a badass bounty hunter that just so happens to be good looking. Not a big deal imo. Sorry for the rant."
Metroid,3cnc68,BlockyAnubis,7,Thu Jul 9 09:36:42 2015 UTC,"I kinda wanted to avoid the whole sexualization discussion because I know my opinions are unpopular. I actually take a great deal of issue with ZSS's design, especially in Other M and Smash Bros.  The Skin Tight outfit makes sense, but the Zero Suit doesn't, before she wore a sports bra and shorts, which is what would give maximum mobility and comfort. The Zero Suit covers all her joints and muscles, which in reality would make it HARDER for her to move.  And yeah her tits and hips are gigantic in Other M and Smash Bros. if you think that's what normal or athletic women look like you may need a reality check. I'm fine with her being attractive, she's meant to be a genetically enhanced super soldier so I see no reason why she'd not be attractive, but she's got no muscle mass, giant tits and hips and she doesn't even seem to have athlete's legs.  Her Design reflects sexual appeal more than the idea of the character itself. But yeah it's not THAT big a deal. It's fiction after all. If that's how the creators and fans want it, then so be it. I just don't like it.  And yeah I can see how the pose could work like that, but Samus has always seemed humble to me, not the kind of person with a superiority complex. She's always seemed more like an underplayed servant of good, not a badass mistress of death and destruction.  On the note of the design of the suit, I kinda agree. It definitely feels more organic and flexible, much more suited for the acrobatics Samus does.  But the fact that she generates the suit itself doesn't make it any less mechanical, remember in Fusion how she had to have parts removed and stuff? It's always been very much so a physical suit, it's just generated by her psyche."
Metroid,3cnc68,Axselt,5,Thu Jul 9 09:47:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on everything, pretty much. I just wanted to point out a thought that I had, though.  Since they introduced the idea that she forms the suit through willpower, it would make sense to me that the Zero Suit is used to project the suit outward in all directions. If that were the case, she'd have to wear it in order to be able to wear the armored suit.  I like the idea that she has to get into the suit before each mission better, though. I never liked the fact that she just makes the suit magically appear (from the Zero Suit)."
Metroid,3cnc68,Wensleydale_Gaming,2,Thu Jul 9 13:50:00 2015 UTC,"Neither did I, and tbh the fact that the Zero Suit has only appeared in two main series Metroid games makes it feel... incredibly... non canon? Like they retconned it in for fan service?"
Metroid,3cnc68,IcedKappaccino,2,Thu Jul 9 14:09:36 2015 UTC,"Yea i mentioned the suit being mentally generated cuz the other m suit looks less mechanical. On the sexual aspect, what you said makes sense. However, if you ever wear sportsware, those underarmour covering whole limbs are actually easy to move around in. I mean we dont know how the skin tight suit really is like and all of this is hypothetical but i would imagine it being similar to the underarmour which would function just fine. Sm4sh zss does not have huge racks at all from what i can tell. Theyre not small, but theyre not popping into your face anime style ridiculous either. I mean i look at her and the chest and hips dont seem exaggerated at all. Relative to her size, i personally think nothing is out of porportion. I workout and am fit, and i see many women who have similar sizes relative to their body. All im saying is that it's not a big deal, which you pointed out. Everything seems relatively balanced. I dont have a problem with a bounty hunter that is sexy. I do become concerned when the character becomes sexually centered instead of its roots. However, zss has not reached that point of inexcusable objectification imo.  Regarding the pose, you're right. It may not reflect her character, but i still like how it portrays her to be haha. I mean we can say shes underplayed, but is she capable? I think so. In her universe, she is one of the most powerful being in existence. Her character is different to various players. Prime portrays her as a badass savior who simply waved her hands while walking away to signal farewell. To me, she could totally pull off this amiibo pose. Again, we each have unique portrayals of how samus is. Good discussion man."
Metroid,3cnc68,OurEyesArentReal,2,Thu Jul 9 14:58:18 2015 UTC,The suit IS formed by her mentally... But she doesn't choose what it looks like. If the Chozo designed it with huge ass shoulders (which the Chozo happen to have) then Samus can't just shrink them.
Metroid,3cnc68,BlockyAnubis,2,Thu Jul 9 19:01:09 2015 UTC,"Actually, the huge shoulder pads are symbol of war for the Chozo. The power suit design is based largely on the Chozo god of war.  EDIT: I was trying to clarify that the Chozo don't have gigantic shoulders."
Metroid,3cnc68,twinfyre,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:27:17 2015 UTC,"The whole broad shoulder part is what the Chozo actually look like, and the balls are generators... The Chozo have large shoulders in general"

Metroid,3clmiy,jimbolic,6,Thu Jul 9 03:08:41 2015 UTC,"Pretty cool style. I love how it puts more emphasis on the shoulders in the design. It looks bulky like the varia suit should, but it also has some elegance to it."
Metroid,3clmiy,twinfyre,3,Thu Jul 9 04:29:20 2015 UTC,Yeaah! I totally agree. lots of samus fanart has the tiniest shoulderpad things.like cmon.

I just am surprised that they are going to run this game since I never expected them to actually go through with it being on of the less favorable Metroid games.  Hunters is also not nearly bad enough for them to speedrun as a joke or show how badly programmed it is like Sonic 06

Metroid,3ckxrr,_GS,9,Wed Jul 8 18:40:42 2015 UTC,Something set after Fusion with sprite based artwork is exactly what I wanted from Dread so I am pretty disappointed that they didn't keep working on it.  Would be interesting to see if some images or videos of it ever get leaked.
Metroid,3ckxrr,joecb91,3,Wed Jul 8 20:36:12 2015 UTC,"Tamaki said he is gonna dig more info, so hopefully more interesting stuff comes out."
Metroid,3ckxrr,Butter_Is_Life,4,Wed Jul 8 20:40:26 2015 UTC,"Really interesting video, some points in particular stand out:   Metroid Dread is a codename, looked a lot like Fusion when shown off to internal developers at Nintendo due to the sprite work. Hunters' lackluster single player is pretty much because it was done at the last minute compared to its stellar mutiplayer mode. NST (developer of Hunters) was completely left in the dark about Federation Force and found out the same time we did (at E3)"
Metroid,3ckxrr,Butter_Is_Life,4,Wed Jul 8 20:01:26 2015 UTC,"If you wanna know about why NST is in the dark, check out Tamaki Project hammer video, very interesting."
Metroid,3ckxrr,Butter_Is_Life,3,Wed Jul 8 20:24:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've seen that one. Interesting to see how far they were left in the dark to not even get let known about the project. Real shame how they've been treated. It's one thing to not be given a big handle on projects for making a mediocre game (Project HAMMER really looked average at best), but it's another to be pretty much downplayed and kept from providing input because of nationalism."
Metroid,3ckxrr,KingBroly,5,Wed Jul 8 20:29:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah thats fucked up, what i wanna know the most is what is stopping the 2d Metroids from advancing. Hopefully he uncovers something about why that is happening."
Metroid,3ckxrr,wreckingcanon,3,Wed Jul 8 20:42:59 2015 UTC,Something that I get the impression of from both Unseen64 and a few others (like Tanabe) is that Sakamoto is still in charge of 2D Metroid. So with Sakamoto taking a break from Metroid...there just really isn't any progress on a new one. Hmm.
Metroid,3ckxrr,Unseen64Liam,3,Wed Jul 8 20:51:15 2015 UTC,"Oh i thought i'm the only one who wonders why they keep referencing Sakamoto recently, he stated he doesn't wanna go back but they keep bringing him back as in charge so it doesn't make much sense to me.( I don't mind him coming back as long as he is on a leash)"
Metroid,3ckxrr,VoyagerOrchid,6,Wed Jul 8 21:08:37 2015 UTC,So Metroid Dread actually existed and looked like Fusion...and they decided not to make it. But then they went and made Federation Force.  ...alright

I've been looking to replicate that effect for my own title (aiming a weapon on screen, but only the edges turn the player), so you can imagine my interest in the method used."
Metroid,3cm1k4,wreckingcanon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:41:01 2015 UTC,"Controlling the aiming was written with 3 different C# scrips in unity to preform the same looking as the MP3 cannon movement.

Metroid,3cmibe,xLinkFrostx,10,Thu Jul 9 01:42:13 2015 UTC,"8 years, 10 years, not that different.  My reasoning is, we're getting some great fanmade Metroid hacks and indie metroidvanias, all 2D, because they're easier to make with a smaller team. If we want a detailed 3D Metroid, it's probably going to have to come from Ninendo."
Metroid,3cmibe,malicious-monkey,6,Thu Jul 9 01:59:04 2015 UTC,"It's likely because those are the games people have been playing recently. And tbh the Retro developed Metroid titles are some of the best in the franchise. As much as people argue for Super Metroid, I'd say the Prime Trilogy goes above all other 2D titles.  That said I think it is time for another 2D Metroid title, a WiiU game with hand drawn sprites would be amazing. Pixel Art is cool too tho."
Metroid,3cmibe,ozzAR0th,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:17:21 2015 UTC,I'd love to see one done with hand drawn sprites or pixel art.  They could make an amazing looking game with the current technology.
Metroid,3cmibe,joecb91,3,Thu Jul 9 03:01:42 2015 UTC,Honestly I could go both ways but I feel like an actual 3d Metroid (Prime) game would be a lot more groundbreaking and memorable then a 2d Metroid game. I don't have anything against 2d games but I feel like the gamer and Metroid community would collectively lose their shit over a 3d more so than a 2d again. Honestly as long as its a well-made Metroid game then I'll be a happy camper.
Metroid,3cmibe,sirshredzalot,2,Thu Jul 9 04:03:19 2015 UTC,"Because I mostly grew up with 3D games (I was far too young when I had a Sega Genesis), I am more at home with those games. I actually lose myself in the environment and lose track of reality; that has NEVER happened in a 2D game and I don't think it ever will. 2D games feel more ""gamey"" than polished 3D ones. That does NOT mean that they are bad, Super Metroid is brilliant, but Prime takes me away from Earth 2015 far better than Super, Fusion, or any other 2D game ever will. Not sure if I'm the only one here, but that's why I prefer 3D gaming over 2D.  EDIT: Also, there's an oversaturation of 2D Metroidvania/platformers from indie devs; I'm quickly growing tired of them, personally."
Metroid,3cmibe,ThePhreshKarut,2,Thu Jul 9 06:00:39 2015 UTC,A brand new 3D Metroid adventure would be just what the Wii U needs and it would be the perfect game on the console for many reasons. A 2D Metroid game would alternatively and ironically be perfect on the 3DS handheld and we already have so many great games on that device.
Metroid,3cmibe,Fishy956,2,Thu Jul 9 06:23:52 2015 UTC,But I feel that the 2D games carry a deeper story when it comes to Samus (besides Other M)   What? Sure Fusion had a little bit. But compared to all the scanning and lore from Prime there is no comparison that Prime had more story concerning samus/the chozo/space pirates/federation.
Metroid,3cmibe,AtomKick,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:31:15 2015 UTC,"Other M probably plays a part in that overall perception. People wanted another 2D Metroid and Nintendo delivered that. In that twisted djinn way, I guess!"
Metroid,3cmibe,XenesisXenon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:32:23 2015 UTC,"First a lot of people were drawn into the franchise by Prime. They either heard they trilogy was insanely good or were probably recommended it from a friend. Because Prime really set a new standard for the franchise as a whole I can see why a lot of people are wanting a new Prime game. On top of this, I feel like Prime's style of play is just more appealing to most gamers. The first person aspect of this really helps this. If someone was shown Zero Mission and Prime 1 side by side and asked which one they'd rather play, I reckon it would be Prime 1. The visuals are of course much stronger and in 3D games can offer a much deeper experience than 2D ones.  Also since we haven't had any Metroid in a while (yeah Fed Force Other M... I mean like a good strong staple-like Metroid game), you kinda want it to come back with a big fucking bang. Another thing on this  point is that some people  just really wanna see how awesome Metroid could look with new hardware. It already looked great on the Wii and that system was not very powerful compared to other consoles. Imagine what a Metroid Wii U/NX could look like..."
Metroid,3cmibe,Nintendan95,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:41:34 2015 UTC,I'll take either.  Don't even care.  A new game like Metroid Prime (the first one) with twin-stick controls?  Done.  A new game like Super Metroid?  Done.  Either.  Both.  If Nintendo said we're getting a 3d one for the WiiU and a 2d one for the 3DS I would not be upset at all.  But of course on the 3ds they would undoubtedly have to make use of the 3dness.
Metroid,3cmfhf,wreckingcanon,6,Thu Jul 9 01:19:22 2015 UTC,"What's frustrating is that when you dislike a game, you will go out of your way just to find more things to dislike about it, regardless of how hard you have to stretch to point out the dislike.  This is what I feel like when I see pictures like this.  It's people who go out of their way to turn things that we would normally not give a shit about into some major gamebreaking things.  (Just to point out that I'm using you in the general sense and not specifically talking about the OP.)  When you look at comments like ""the path through the world is unimaginative and dull"", it's really a meaningless statement overall.  It said that you didn't like it, but it doesn't actually have any depth to why you don't like it.  If I'm developing a game, this type of feedback provides no value that I can go back and say WHY.  It's the equivalent of someone responding to why you don't like it to ""Because I just don't like it.""  It's a staple of almost all of the comments that are made in the image as well.  ""The environments are boring, ugly, repetitive and shallow...""  What actually makes the environment not boring that you are somehow missing from the game?    ""Combat is easy, repetitive and dull""  ""The enemies are ugly, with crass colouring and asinine design""  Don't get me wrong, there are worthwhile complaints in this graphic, but it's when they actually describe the actual problem and not just some half-baked negative commentary."
Metroid,3cmfhf,Duese,3,Thu Jul 9 03:32:41 2015 UTC,"I think the details are likely skimped on when criticizing Other M, because that path has been tread so many times and we all know the song and dance now. People just want to beat a dead horse, at this point. However, there are plenty of reviews, articles, and what-have-you with proper, in-depth criticism of Other M, if you really want that sort of thing."
Metroid,3cmfhf,MonochromeTyrant,2,Thu Jul 9 06:29:08 2015 UTC,"I'll admit it's at least enjoyable to beat that horse because M:OM never reaches that ""so bad it's good"" stage and is perpetually stuck in so bad it's bad.  Honestly, if the gameplay was wonderful and the writing was bad, it'd be forgiven. Likewise if the writing was wonderful and gameplay mediocre. It just had the curse of both being a medicore game and a travesty of writing. It will forever stand as a testament that bad Nintendo games happen because of it."
Metroid,3cmfhf,XenesisXenon,2,Thu Jul 9 07:29:44 2015 UTC,"Woooo, CONSTRUCTIVE criticism!"
Metroid,3cmfhf,ThePhreshKarut,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:11:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you've said. Whenever I've criticized Other M, I exclusively focus on story points because that's all I've personally experienced of the game. I haven't played it, and I don't think I'm in a position to criticize how the game feels to play if I haven't done so.   It's really easy to toss out words like repetitive, dull, uninspired, etc. I might have done it before, granted, but I recognize the total...non-value it has.   I mean, heck, you could easily argue that end-game Metroid gameplay is ""easy"" and ""repetitive"" across titles depending on how you stretch the definition of those words to fit your argument. It's almost universally better to point out specific instances.  I recall one little conversation I had over in /r/nintendo. I critiqued how I felt about how A Hat in Time felt....specifically about how the jumps felt to control and how they animated. I think this caught the attention of the developer since another user in the thread pointed out him quoting my comment in a Tweet. We ended up having a pretty nice chat, though, since I went on to provide specific comparisons relating the game's animations to Banjo-Kazooie, and what about how those character animated that I felt was successful, and what I felt A Hat in Time lacked and also was successful with as a player (based on my own experience playing the Alpha).   Maybe he agreed with me, maybe not, but based on how the conversation ended, I at least felt that I came out of the interaction providing constructive criticism rather than ""Hat Girl's jump animations have no weight"". I know most of what we say about Other M will probably not reach a Nintendo developer, but I can at least see why they might dismiss our complaints considering how broad they can be at times."

Metroid,3cmfhf,Duese,-1,Sat Jul 11 19:01:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you for being the personification of my post.     the path through Metroid games has never been as straight-forward as in Other M.  There was always backtracking and exploration, which was non-existent in Other M.    For instance, you say that it's non-existent, if you have actually played the game, then you should know that there is backtracking in it, so your comment is inaccurate.  It's a comment that is made with the specific purpose of making a grandiose claim for the sake of the complaint.  Does it have as much backtracking as other metroid titles, no it doesn't.  It also begs the question of whether you are so myopic in your thinking to believe that it can't be a metroid game without massive amounts of backtracking.   As for the other points, they are valid.  It isn't somebody going ""out of their way"" to find shit they don't like.    Another great example of presenting your opinion an an authoritative opinion on the game/opinions rather than actually presenting it as a critical opinion on the game.     People complain about those exact things in other games that they like very much as a whole package.   I disagree with this entirely.    For example, stating that the ""environments are boring, ugly, blah blah blah"" is just horse shit.  You can like one games more than others but don't insult people into thinking that they are as bad as they are being portrayed in the comment.  Further to that, it talks about them being repetitive which is ignorant on a lot of different levels.  First off, if we're talking about using the same theme across an area, that's been a staple of the metroid series since it's inception.  Hell, if they didn't have general themes in areas, it would actually be a real critical complaint.    So, we have people complaining about repetitive environments despite the game being able to take a single setting (a spaceship) and incorporate everything from green/jungle areas, metallic/industrial zones, frozen/cold themes and even entire fire/hot zones.  I don't know how you could possibly say in your right mind that these zones are repetitive within the game.   You're almost making it seem like there can only be 2 possible reviews on a game - positive or negative -   I have no clue how you even came to this conclusion at all.  Nothing that I said gave that level of polarization of reviews of a game.  Complain about the aspects of the game that were the things you didn't like but don't go out of your way to complain about things that were either incorrect to complain about or that you would otherwise tolerate in any other game, which is the case here.  It's the difference between saying ""The combat was terrible"" and ""the gameplay design for transitioning to and shooting missiles felt very clunky and not very fluid.""  It's about appropriating the complaints to things that negatively impacted the gameplay.   a shitty game with nearly nothing redeeming (which was Other M in the eyes of a lot of Metroid fans).   Just looking through your post history, it appears that you have a personal vendetta against anyone saying anything positive or even neutral about Other M.  It's honestly pathetic.  You are exactly the type of person that I am talking about with this.  You can't even make a post about the game without making some sort of derogatory term.  I even have questions to whether you've even played through the game that you are bitching about just based on your comments.  If I were to ask you for aspects of Other M that you actually liked, would you even answer that question?  I'll give you a hint, any person being rational would be able to answer that question."

It just cemented my view that Prime is the game that is the best 2D to 3D series jump in gaming, I can't think of any that are that close, that are able to stiick to just what the 2D games did without completely changing the format for 3D(looking at you Mario)"

Harmony of Heroes was like a gigantic amount of songs in different styles that, in my opinion, failed to capture the games in order to have more variety of genres/styles.

Metroid,3chk3q,Parax0,16,Tue Jul 7 23:29:21 2015 UTC,"Are you telling me that there is someone making a real 3D Metroid Editor that would allow us to build our own worlds ? Is this for real ? Not just a dream ? You are the most awesome person in the entire universe.  I would like to know a bit more about this project. Are you using Unity/Unreal/another engine as a foundation for the editor ? The UI seems pretty professional and complete, but it doesn't ring any bells.  As for the models that someone would make for the editor, what would the ideal polycount be ? Texture size ? Did the prime games even use normal maps ?  I'm asking because...well, your project looks kind of awesome, and I could, I said could, take some time to work on 3D models for you. I was planning on doing a lot of things during this summer and improving my 3D skills is one of my goals. I love Metroid so damn much, and would love to help out a little.  Here are some of the things I made in the last months, call it a portfolio : http://imgur.com/a/EXiRk"
Metroid,3chk3q,0megaRidley,6,Tue Jul 7 23:59:57 2015 UTC,"haha, yes it's real. It's being built on a custom engine in C++ and the UI is done with Qt 5.4. The UI is far from complete :P I'm only just getting started on it recently, actually. Looks nice thanks to a decent dark skin and some icons by /u/BearborgOne. (The skin's being redone eventually, it's not very good functionally; just placeholder for now.)  For models, remember they're basically just UI elements, so they don't need to be complicated or look amazing. I'm not 100% sure what the ideal poly count is, but I'm going to estimate they should ideally be around <= 1000. Feel free to use a bit more if you want, though.  For textures, hmm... I was thinking models without materials would be simpler to set up, but now that I think about it it's probably the same amount of work either way. Will update the first post. Textures should be a power of 2, probably around 256x256 or 512x512. I can also set up models to render with a flat color + shading, which might be easier. I think setting up anything fancy materials-wise would be overkill."
Metroid,3chk3q,0megaRidley,3,Wed Jul 8 00:19:10 2015 UTC,"I think less than 200 polygons would be more practical, and as you said, those are UI elements, no need to ask too much of the CPU. As for the textures, 256x256 or 512x512 sounds pretty good to me, I'm used to working with 2048x2048 textures so that's a nice change. And as you said², no need to make textures for everything, as long as the icon speaks for itself.  I'm definitely interested in helping you with this project. Wanna use Skype or something similar to make communication easier ?"
Metroid,3chk3q,1upD,3,Wed Jul 8 00:37:16 2015 UTC,"I had a look around some models and from a quick look it seemed like most of the models the game uses are at least a few hundred polygons, with most being around 500-1000. (Important ones go higher; Samus is around 9k.) Plus the editor obviously runs on more powerful hardware than a Gamecube... so that's where I got 1k from. Less is fine though, sure.

Metroid,3chk3q,FriendFrog,2,Wed Jul 8 03:54:51 2015 UTC,"A few places, yeah. Most of the discussion has been happening here on metroid2002.

Just yesterday I was thinking about a game that I'd like to make & was trying to find out how Metroid Prime handled the lock-on system, but wouldn't even begin to know where to start with the actual game's code & google searches weren't helping. Could you explain how the lock-on system works, if it's not too much trouble? I doubt I'd be able to figure it out for myself. Also, out of curiosity, would you be able to tell if there are any random number generators used in the game?"
Metroid,3chk3q,nikovan_smash,3,Wed Jul 8 03:53:07 2015 UTC,"I haven't researched how the lock-on system works. If you can set up an orbit camera, though, then the lock-on system is probably not that much more complicated. (The only other components to it are orbiting player movement + determining what the best lock-on point is.)  Yes, there's random number generators in the game."
Metroid,3chk3q,plasmabeamonline,4,Wed Jul 8 04:03:38 2015 UTC,"determining what the best lock-on point is   This is actually handled by the animation system. Most enemies have one or more bones that have been animated to provide a consistent lock-on point, and aren't connected to any geometry. If there isn't one of those specially-labelled bones, I think it just defaults to the root bone."

I know there are a number of games with lock-on systems, but I don't remember ever having difficulty with Metroid Prime, unlike some other games.  I was thinking of making a system that prioritizes based on closeness to the center of the screen / pointer when the camera is stable, but priority shifts towards player proximity with increasing camera/aim speed. I thought this might be overly complicated."

Metroid,3chsgc,wreckingcanon,10,Wed Jul 8 00:36:47 2015 UTC,"I loved it. It was one of my first forages into online gaming after Runescape, and the first FPS I took seriously.  It had flaws and as you said, hackers ran it to the ground, but it was so much fun while it was in its prime.  A good sequel could finally be the competitive game Nintendo could use to grab people interested in Destiny or Halo, but knowing them, even if a quality sequel would come out it would have no leaderboards, ranking system or whatever. Makes me sad."
Metroid,3chsgc,nikovan_smash,6,Wed Jul 8 02:00:20 2015 UTC,"I still had a few moments from the hacker days that I'm proud of. I was playing as Sylux and encountered a Samus with regenerating health. (most likely press x for full health) They weren't very good, though. They basically just stood there and pumped missiles at me. So I ran up to them with the shock coil and started sapping health. They didn't bother to move around that much (I'm using hacks! You can't kill me!) So the shock coil just kept on sucking more and more energy. Eventually I was sucking so much energy out that they didn't have time to use their cheats.   That's when they died.   Probably my most satisfying moment in online gaming. That is until Smash 4 came along..."
Metroid,3chsgc,twinfyre,3,Wed Jul 8 03:01:11 2015 UTC,What happened in smash 4?
Metroid,3chsgc,twinfyre,3,Wed Jul 8 03:13:23 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you asked.  Smash 4 has a lot of risk reward to it. My two mains right now are Samus and Lucario.   Right now, Lucario is slowly becoming my favorite. His moveset is so diverse that there's a lot of different options and tools to use on the battlefield. Also his aura power makes his moves change with damage. Which can be a challenge to master. My favorite thing to mess around with is his super speed. He has a very small window where he'll attack at the end of it, so I've been trying to sweet-spot it to get better kills. it's also really easy to self destruct with it. One false twitch of the joystick and you could send yourself flying off the stage.  My favorite moment happened just a few days ago when I was playing this Donkey Kong user online. (Mad props to this guy, probably the best Donkey Kong I've ever played) He was beating me six ways from Sunday and I was considering switching out Lucario for Samus (projectiles work best on big characters) but i decided to give him one more match. This time I went all out. We were neck and neck the entire match. Eventually, we were both on our last stocks with really high percentages. I had managed to get a lucky hit that sent him flying up in the air. It was at that moment I realized this was the only chance I was going to get. If I missed this shot, he would surely kill me. Or worse, I would kill myself. I activated my super speed, and flew up to meet him. I don't think he realized what was happening in that brief moment. I'm not a very skilled player. He probably thought I didn't have the skill to pull off a move like that. God knows I thought so. But all the same, I connected. Black lightning lit up the screen, signifying a kill move. Donkey Kong flew off the stage to his oblivion, and I fell down to mine. As I fell past the ledge of the stage, Donkey Kong met his death on the left side. I had won."
Metroid,3chsgc,Nintendan95,2,Wed Jul 8 04:08:03 2015 UTC,I remember one time I was in a 1v1 with a hacking Samus. I think they were using the Lightball (iirc) hack which lets you boost ball around the map at fucking insane speeds; so insane it can cause you to clip through walls and fall out the map. Since it was a 1v1 I was able to do the simple missile push glitch in Combat Hall. I stood in there and saw the guy boosting around too fast for his own good. For some reason whenver he fell out the map it would count as 10 deaths o.O But yeah I won that game with something like 0 v -70 lol
Metroid,3chsgc,nikovan_smash,3,Wed Jul 8 08:54:06 2015 UTC,"Same with me!  I think people liked it so much because it plays a lot like Quake.  The only three things I really like from a sequel is improved balancing between the hunters and the weapons, as well as up to 4v4 or 8 players at least.  A secret desire of mine would actually be something that came from other games like TF2 and Titanfall.  This would be deployable enemies like the alimbic turret as well as spawners for guardians, voldrums, and psycho bits.  Having this could expand the gameplay adn make the multiplayer feel bigger than it really is."

Metroid,3chsgc,Nintendan95,3,Wed Jul 8 03:02:08 2015 UTC,Shame that I never got a chance at playing Hunters online.
Metroid,3chyiv,Kropotki,2,Wed Jul 8 01:28:13 2015 UTC,Sakamoto chose to follow the continuity of the comics and work independently of Retro in establishing the story to Other M.   (from 6:57)  This decision makes no business sense. Why base your story around relatively unknown manga (which aren't officially translated outside of Japan) instead of the backstory from the most recent and successful game?   I know that this game was an attempt to appeal to the Japanese audience but that in itself doesn't make sense because Metroid games have sold much worse in Japan compared to the West ever since Super Metroid. I don't know why Nintendo thought they could magically change that pattern by making the controls similar to the famicom and throwing in references to the older games.  To me it seems like Sakamoto's decision to ignore the american-made games was influenced by ethnocentrism. From the start he had a complete focus on the Japanese audience and this ruined the chances of the game being successful.
Metroid,3chyiv,Father_Brain,3,Wed Jul 8 13:44:02 2015 UTC,"The real problem is that he tried but didn't really succeeded in following the Manga continuity, because the Samus at the end of the Manga is still the same badass bounty hunter everyone knows and love while the Samus in Other M is definitely not. Other M's characterization doesn't make sense regardless of the fact that one knows about the Manga or not.  Otherwise, I don't seem to recall anything that would make the backstory of Metroid Prime (which is very self-contained anyway) incompatible with the Manga backstory, they works well together just fine. In fact, it would be great if they could do it right."
Metroid,3chyiv,RidleyBro,2,Sat Jul 11 00:01:03 2015 UTC,"I don't seem to recall anything that would make the backstory of Metroid Prime (which is very self-contained anyway) incompatible with the Manga backstory, they works well together just fine.   Agreed. Some of the Chozo lore in Prime referred to Samus as ""the hatchling"" and ""newborn"" which implies she was raised by them. That was the first mention of her backstory in the game series I think.  Really it's just random details in Other M that conflict with the Prime trilogy. I don't understand the reasoning behind crafting this universe that goes out of its way to exclude the American-made games."

Metroid,3cckjd,twinfyre,-5,Tue Jul 7 23:19:21 2015 UTC,"The PED is the ugliest suit in the franchise, make all the worse by the Hazard Shield. It's like the modeler who kept adding stupid glowing bits to the Varia suit in each new Prime game wanted to make a suit entirely out of ugly glowing trash, but somebody had the sense to cover it with bits of another rejected suit design."

I remember getting shivers when I walked into a room and the Space Pirate theme started playing, especially in the low-light conditions in the Phendrana Labs.  I also really liked that their guns and scythes were implanted into their forearms, but left their hand intact (besides the beam troopers), that their scythes were glowy yellow energy membrane (or something) like Meta Ridley's wings, and also that their scythes were reversible."

Metroid,3cb9uu,metroidman388,4,Mon Jul 6 16:16:10 2015 UTC,"Standing grounded could work better than floating, but your current standing pose is weak.  I'd watch the scene in corruption where Dark Samus attacks the hunters early on - her walk cycle there might give you some ideas for the stance.  In smash, most if not all floating characters are planted on the ground during a stand and slow walk.  Mewtwo is a good example.  It's important in the games to distinguish an airborne character from a grounded character, as that is super informative on what movement options the opponent has available on any given frame.  A floating stand could be a problem when SHFFLing is involved.  Edit:  It might also help to show the stances from the standard in game camera, as that's what people would be seeing in-game outside of the pause screen.  Be sure to take both sides into account, as AFAIK most characters have asymmetry to their stances.  I'd also study how the assist trophy stands around and moves in sm4sh."

Metroid,3cb9uu,cosmichorror0013,2,Wed Jul 8 02:54:01 2015 UTC,"I agree- The Echoes design was excellent. The feral, ghoul vibe went really well with how she acted maniacal throughout the game. From the random laughing to murdering Space Pirates with her Phazon Spreadshot beam, she was just batshit crazy.  But in Corruption, she's way more calculating and maybe more intelligent too. In Echoes she's more of a creature and in Corruption more of a commander.   And I think her Corrruption design looks a lot like the Light Suit and not just out of coincidence. Look at her death from the final battle in Echoes:  https://youtu.be/PLLz7dqMuTo?t=433  When she puts her hand up to Samus right before she evaporates into Phazon particles, I think she takes the essence of the Light Suit... somehow. Which could explain why she looks like a corrupted Light Suit in Corruption. Just a theory though."
Metroid,3cb9uu,GabTheGreat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:27:23 2015 UTC,"I don't quite think Dark Samus took the essence of the Light Suit, but I do think when she reassembled later she decided to bulk up a bit when recalculating herself. It makes sense it would grow and learn over time, becoming less feral and more intelligent. I prefer how she looks in Echoes, but I think it makes sense for Dark Samus to look more human over time, becoming more like Samus in order to beat her."

Metroid,3c7nw8,OctoberLight,8,Sun Jul 5 17:40:47 2015 UTC,"Metroid Prime   The lore states that pirates brought metroids with them to Tallon IV, but IIRC nothing states that Dark Samus brought metroids to Phaaze.  In fact, according to the pirates Dark Samus refers to Phaaze as her homeworld.  Metroids on SR388 go through a development cycle that leads to an Omega/Queen Metroid.  Metroids on Tallon IV can mature in Hunter Metroids if in the right environment.  I believe that metroids on Phaaze (or exposed to enough of the right phazon) mature into Phazon Metroids.  Those in turn can mature into two separate lines: a Metroid Hatcher or a Hopping Metroid.  The Hopping Metroid line can mature into what is eventually Metroid Prime.  On Phaaze you can see two husks of Metroid Prime in the Genesis Chamber - they're either moltings from Metroid Prime on Tallon IV, or they're separate creatures that died of natural causes.  The Genesis Chamber houses newborn Leviathans, which presumably mature as they travel closer to the planet's surface and are eventually ejected.  My headcannon is that Metroid Prime on Phaze intercepts the maturing leviathan at some point, kills the leviathan core and absorbs its ability to produce phazon, and that Metroid Prime-containing leviathan gets launched into space where it eventually hits Tallon IV.  The obvious hole in this theory is how did metroids get to Phaaze in the first place.  Maybe they slipped through one of the wormholes made by leviathans in the past and colonized the planet.  Maybe remnants from a chozo metroid development project got lost into space.  Maybe the metroids made by the chozo are genetically engineered not from scratch, but from a similar starter species - Phazon Metroids being one of them.   Morph Ball   Could be some universal standard for electronic interfaces in the future.  My guess is ""because video games"".   Neo-Ridley   Unclear as of now.  Presumably the body was preserved as part of the early efforts of a federation bioweapons project, given their involvement with cloning metroids.  As to how it got there, if you go by Other M its the body of the Ridley clone collected by the federation on the bottle ship.   Ship at the end of Corruption   Tanabe, the director of all the Prime games, recently confirmed that it is Sylux's ship.  There's a ton of 'why' floating around because we know next to nothing about Sylux.  All we know is that his ship and weaponry are stolen federation prototypes, he's from a planet called Cyclosis, and he has an intense hatred for the federation and Samus by extension.  It doesn't make sense to you now because it's only a teaser, and the story will by explored in the future if Tanabe has his way.  Once it's fleshed out and we know the details, then you can assess whether it was compelling or believable.    All that aside the series does have its fair share of plot/lore holes - more than I would like.  Most speculation to close up holes will introduce new holes or steer far away from what the games established."
Metroid,3c7nw8,metroidman388,2,Sun Jul 5 19:00:15 2015 UTC,"My headcannon says that the Chozo managed to get a sample of the ""worm"" before sealing the crater and sent it to the Chozos living in Zebes and then they started working from there!  YAY SOMEONE ELSE THINKS METROIDS CAME FROM PHAAZE!"
Metroid,3c7nw8,Nararthok,3,Mon Jul 6 11:51:28 2015 UTC,Well it isn't my own theory or anything but if you haven't yet you should really read this article on the story of Metroid it's really well done.
Metroid,3c7nw8,Judedeath,2,Mon Jul 6 00:25:46 2015 UTC,"My headcanon:  The Chozo found Phaaze long ago with their Skytown Observatory and populated it with Metroids to try to exterminate the Phazon-mutated monsters there. The Metroids, being exposed to Phazon, mutate heavily, including the one that gets stuck in the Leviathan on Tallon IV.  The Chozo reached perfection and transcended or whatever you call that.  The Morph Ball... I don't know. Maybe that design is actually very efficient at keeping out other enemies, such as the Galactic Federation and bounty hunters, but has a strong vulnerability in Samus.  Neo-Ridley is there for the same reason as the Metroids were, because the GF wanted to use him, either as a weapon or just to study him.  Sylux from Hunters is mysterious on purpose, and if/when we get a better explanation on his origin, it'll make sense."
Metroid,3c7nw8,2CATteam,2,Sun Jul 5 18:20:41 2015 UTC,"i argue neo ridley is plain old ridley's deep fried corpse, no need for other M, ridley was extracted from the fire pit by the remaining space pirates hoping their leader could make a comeback... he didn't but some of his flesh and tissues were technically alive. a pirate ship carried the corpse, but was captured by the federation"
Metroid,3c7nw8,xenoghost1,2,Mon Jul 6 09:04:53 2015 UTC,"Alright, this is awesome. I love all these theories. I guess now it's time for my own speculation. The leviathans create wormholes, right? Well a wormhole is a hole in spacetime not just space. That means that the Metroid that would become prime may have been brought to phaaze by Dark Samus. Alternatively, Phaaze may be an extra-dimensional version of SR388. That is, same planet different dimensions. SR388 had X and Phaaze had phazon. The chozo in each dimension created metroids to deal with it, only the ones in phaaze failed their purpose. Morph ball convenience is due to chozo influence on all planets Samus visits.Chozo built that technology, so they made the morph ball with it in mind. Neo Ridley is probably just Ridley falling to X in a raid, but I did hear a theory that the space pirates are an inside job by the federation used to justify its existence. I like to think that the Chozo didn't die, but instead left en masse to protect the universe from something big. Something that makes phazon and X parasites look as dangerous as a puppy. According to MP the Chozo of Tallon IV had eschewed most technology and neighboring Zebes was considered irrelevant until the space pirates took it over, so the Chozo presence there was weak. Maybe, the metroids were only tested on the X, but their true purpose is greater. The metroids are very mysterious, so just maybe...something."
Metroid,3c7nw8,metroidman388,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:36:59 2015 UTC,"The extra-dimensional SR388 is interesting.  Regarding NeoRidley though   Neo Ridley is probably just Ridley falling to X in a raid   What we see in Fusion is Ridley's corpse preserved on ice.  We also see an X parasite enter it, the corpse's eyes light up and it crumbles, then the X leaves.  I believe this scene is the X parasites' first and only contact with Ridley."

Metroid,3c7nw8,leigonlord,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:33:24 2015 UTC,ive seen a theory that the morph ball is so useful is because pretty much all technology is based on chozo tech and they designed the morph ball to use the tech and people dont know how to get rid of the morph ball parts
Metroid,3c7nw8,rolling_simonov,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:56:54 2015 UTC,"here's my take on it:   metroid prime...   the cradle was sealed against the ""worm"". that worm is the leviathan and phazon.  a pirate metroid somehow made it in; perhaps the unique nature of the metroid's abilities allowed if to pass. perhaps as a chozo creation, the system allowed it through...who knows.   it also depends on what games you play. original ntsc version makes it out to be something that rode in on the leviathan. if this is the case, I'd say the pirates broke through into some outlier regions of the cradle, allowed this phazon creature to escape, after which it absorbed metroid DNA from the pirate specimens, and then bolted.    the chozo...   iirc, the manga states that they basically used life extension technology to reach extreme age. after a bit, they basically ended up as a species of old, infertile specimens. its also mentioned that in previous times, the chozo were warlike and expansionistic. can't recall why they stopped being like that, but constant imperial warfare + a caste of life extended leaders could account for the low number of known specimens at present.    morph ball...   zebes and sr-388 are easily explained: both were chozo colonies. prime-pirates could have adapted morphball shaped interfaces in order to better interact with mother brain while she was their client/tool/boss. tallon is likewise explained, as it was a chozo colonial world. God knows why bsl was build as such, but bear in mind that the ball is 1m, which is a fairly common unit.    neo-ridley   when I was a kid, I just assumed samus collected a DNA sample in order to ""prove"" she was owed credits and submitted it with her ""report"" on the whole zebes thing.  the more I think about it, it seems kinda dumb. perhaps neo-""ridley"" isn't ridley at all, but another previously unknown member of his incredibly rare species.   as for why? ridley and his species have the capabilities of a close attack craft. wouldn't you want that? expendable organic drones that can level colonies on their own and have the in-situ tactical capabilities to think on their feet? he's a good weapon if trained and conditioned for it.  I mean, hell, what purpose did serris or nightmare serve? he was on a biology ship...he's a rare specimen."

Metroid,3c3l0z,Mr_Pennybags,16,Sat Jul 4 12:51:30 2015 UTC,Sounds like a call of duty intro
Metroid,3c3l0z,Smaktat,9,Sat Jul 4 17:14:06 2015 UTC,So it’s a sort of tutorial for the real meat of the game as Samus?
Metroid,3c3l0z,Spudtron98,7,Sat Jul 4 14:45:13 2015 UTC,Yeah it's a story intro that lets the audience know instantly that this will be a game featuring Sylux!
Metroid,3c3l0z,ProvenDantheman,6,Sat Jul 4 16:01:57 2015 UTC,"The problem with this is that Sylux stole GF equipment. His race and origin is unknown,  so we don't know if he's an alien or its the suit that makes him look the way he does. Why would Sylux be working with the GF? If he did, why would he go rogue?"
Metroid,3c3l0z,Wind123,8,Sat Jul 4 13:18:11 2015 UTC,"I was writing down a part 2 to post after but I guess I'll address the issues here:)  This is an origin story for Sylux more than anything (not the whole story of the game, it's just a large part of it, discovering who he really is), we don't know sylux's origin or why he hates the federation, that's why I've written this to answer those questions, and the story goes as such:  Sylux was a project by the galactic federation to create a soldier similar to Samus, a walking tank with a suit that works effortlessly with the mind of the user (in Samus' case the chozo suit works with her chozo DNA) to create a walking weapon that can also assimilate the weapons of other races (like Samus can) to be useful in any combat situation. The Sylux project involves bonding a suit to a persons nervous system so they think, feel and control the suit like it's a part of them. The problem is, the suit has access to the users brain, it plays with them emotionally and as now a simple outburst of anger becomes raw power, it's dangerous. Sylux is unstable, and the federation feels the project could be risky, but they want to test it.   I'll save why he hates Samus and the federation for when I actually write it up fully."
Metroid,3c3l0z,TheZaxvo,3,Sat Jul 4 13:32:28 2015 UTC,"I like this. I actually came up with a very similar theory myself. I love this intro.  The interesting thing is that Sylux is officially registered as an ""unknown"" individual, yet Samus presumably (going by how she can access info on Sylux by scanning him in Hunters) knows that his suit is Federation issue. So it really does hint that the Federation isn't telling the whole story to Samus. Maybe they try and pass Sylux off as a terrorist who just happened to steal a prototype? I doubt he is though, since the prototype was presumably very well guarded and secure, and only someone with high security clearance could get hold of it.  Another thought I had: if Sylux was working within the Federation, what stops him from spilling its secrets (Snowden style) now that he's escaped? Unless he wasn't privy to much deep and dark stuff, and his beef with the Feds is more personal than ideological.  I get the feeling that the Federation has sent commando teams to apprehend Sylux time and time again, but none have ever returned (see the intro to Hunters). At the same time Sylux clearly isn't powerful enough to take on the Federation himself (if he was he wouldn't need to look for the Omega Cannon). Without sending an army after him (and drawing massive attention to why they were doing that, and Sylux would just slip away anyway) there isn't much the Feds can really do. Other than sending Samus against him.  (I had an idea for Prime 4 trailer actually. How about an inverse of the live action Other M trailer, with Sylux providing narration as he walks through his backstory?)"
Metroid,3c3l0z,ProvenDantheman,3,Sat Jul 4 15:23:40 2015 UTC,They'd never do that because the internet would explode with hate for anything remotely related to Other M.   I'd dig it though.

Metroid,3c1ybl,ozzAR0th,13,Sat Jul 4 00:34:26 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a good concept that, with work, I could see turning into an actual game. I think it would be especially interesting if the Federation interactions started early on in the game, beginning with a few troops that act as followers, and ending with other GF generals working alongside Samus and leading different groups down towards the Core. Samus' relationship as a bounty hunter with the Galactic Federatoin is something that could be really fun to explore."
Metroid,3c1ybl,etecoon3,7,Sat Jul 4 01:44:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's basically how I envisioned it, but I'd prefer the GF's interactions be kept from the earlier parts of the campaign, to keep that initial feeling of isolation and solitary exploration."
Metroid,3c1ybl,etecoon3,6,Sat Jul 4 01:48:30 2015 UTC,"Either way, I think it is easy to alternate gameplay elements between solo adventure, solo stealth, and group warfare. You already have some elements in place: the changing environments.  Normally, it isn't a good idea for the environments to change randomly, as then it is random if a player can make it through or not, resulting in frustration. However, if the environment changes after set parts in the story, such as when the Space Pirates mess with the machine or Samus defeats a boss and destabilzes a machine, it could change an environment and separate her from the rest of the GF. This way the environments serve multiple purposes: 1) they work as a gate, preventing players from going certain places too early or without proper gear. 2) as you've already said, they serve as a visible change in the environment, making the story really feel as if it affects the world. 3) It makes backtracking through areas even more interesting as the areas are the same but different, with new possibilities. 4) it can add interesting late-game puzzles once Samus can control the environment and switch to certain environments for certain effects.  As far as alternating between stealth and the more traditional adventure mode of play, you can always utilize the Zero Suit as well. We know that Samus can convert the power suit to energy in order to only use the Zero Suit, as well as it automatically reverts to energy when she takes severe damage. This could be a way to willingly switch to a stealth mode, or give a player a second chance to recover health after their suit is completely powered down."
Metroid,3c1ybl,that_dude_you_know,3,Sat Jul 4 02:57:02 2015 UTC,"I think I meant ""randomly"" in the sense of within the story, but in game areas would have set properties for how they would change under Space Pirate control. Like a water based area where the exit is underwater would suddenly freeze over when you get close to the water, causing you to be stuck from progressing in the area before killing off the Space Pirates. Like you said, a lot of the time they'd act as locked doors. But in a much more fluid and believable way than random locking space station doors."

After reading etecoon3's comment , I was thinking of something similar to how Other M looked. I also got the feeling that the environment might not change randomly, but almost on a timer, for example, every X minutes, certain areas may not be accessible and after certain bosses, some routes may be permanently opened/closed. Apologies if unclear."
Metroid,3c1ybl,twinfyre,3,Sat Jul 4 05:15:40 2015 UTC,The idea has shifted constantly between Classic 2D and Prime style to be honest.

I always thought a huge part of Metroid was the alien designs and surviving the hostile nature of alien worlds. If you suddenly only have her fight Space Pirates you're limiting your enemies types quite substantially. You could rejig it so there's maybe some sort of mutagen that forces only a select few aliens to adapt quickly and perhaps make them more aggressive because of it, kinda like Phazon. But just be cautious about suddenly wiping out a large portion of possible enemies."

Honestly, I really like survival type of games, really adds depth to gameplay and with what next generation graphics could make, an extremely fun Metroid that not only involves upgrade hunting, but constantly shifting strategy as well. Like, instead of just using beams and missile combos, the knife (or close combat like Other M does) adds utility that you otherwise wouldn't be able to get with standard beam weaponry. Very neat idea.  Maybe the developers could think of something like this in the next installment."

IMO the first two prime games are better since I like the one large open, fantastic world over the segmented areas in prime 3.  It's just that the pacing of prime and how each areas are separated by worlds make speed running it much harder since there are a lot less tricks to exploit to sequence break as often.  Also the cuts fees and loading times are priminant but it is a ml ore. Cinematic game and the loading for the most part are mostly with doors so it doesn't stop the game play which I appreciate.  Could people tell that I'm not a speed runner we it comes Metroid?  Pikmin is a different story though."

Metroid,3c2914,QThatOneGuy,14,Sat Jul 4 02:17:55 2015 UTC,"Fusion is my personal favorite of the 2D metroids, but Super is what the series is all about.  So despite all my love for Fusion, Super is what you should play first."
Metroid,3c2914,powermad80,6,Sat Jul 4 07:02:29 2015 UTC,depends on how much handholding you want. More=fusion Less=super
Metroid,3c2914,shhh-sippytime,7,Sat Jul 4 04:22:38 2015 UTC,"Super is the better game, but I would highly recommend playing through both of them"

Metroid,3c2914,hunter324,8,Sat Jul 4 15:08:09 2015 UTC,Super.
Metroid,3c2914,MonochromeTyrant,2,Sat Jul 4 02:18:43 2015 UTC,"Super might be considered a better looking game, and I like the environments in super, but Fusion has a more involving story and more suspenseful moments (although that's debatable)."
Metroid,3c2914,LuxShadow1,2,Sat Jul 4 04:30:27 2015 UTC,"Good choice.  Super is an almost perfect game.  It has a few small flaws.  The missile selection is a tad clunky, and aiming is a bit weird, with L and R giving you 45 degrees up and down.  There are definitely parts where you will go ""how the hell could I have known that?""  Be aware that there is a ""run"" button, you'll need it on what's commonly called the ""noob bridge"" a collapsing bridge which is impossible to get past without knowing how to run.  When in doubt, use X-ray vision (assuming you've found it.)  And finally, wall jumping is much harder than it is in a, say, New Super Mario Bros.  Metroid Fusion has easier controls, impressive since it's on a system with less buttons.  Aiming missiles is a bit easier and using them is a tad more intuitive.  There is more of a story, which can be good or bad depending on how much hand-holding you want.  Super Metroid is like Metroid Prime, it really showed a lot of cool things and was a great foray onto a new system.  Metroid Fusion is like Metroid Prime 3: Corruption -- a bit more linear, a bit more story-focused, and with better controls.  Despite that, I like the first one more.  You'll like both.  Enjoy!"
Metroid,3c2914,wayoverpaid,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:33:14 2015 UTC,"Super, then fusion. Super's excellence can't be adequately described."
Metroid,3c2914,Xilean,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:50:31 2015 UTC,"I feel like Fusion is a better introduction to the series. It's linear, the controls are more forgiving, the story is clearer, there's additional characters and more evident plot points other than killing bosses and getting upgrades.   It's a good primer for Super. I wouldn't say Fusion is ""better"" but I think it's a slightly more accessible game. For that reason, you may be able to get into Super a bit easier, and thus enjoy it more probably, if you've already played Fusion.   From another perspective - Fusion is more of a character/plot/event driven game. You'll get invested in the characters and running around the space station trying to deal with everything as it goes to hell. It feels a lot like a movie (you can feel the Aliens/Terminator vibe pretty much throughout the game).  Alternatively, Super Metroid is more of an interactive adventure. It gives you free roam of the world and doesn't ease up. It's less like a movie and more like a true adventure you're participating in actively. Though it's less cinematic, it conveys tone, mood, and atmosphere probably more efficiently than Fusion does. In that respect, it's a lot closer to Prime 1 than it is Fusion.   All in all, I'd say Fusion captures the best of the sidescrolling style of Metroid while doing it in its own linear, cinematic style. And then Prime I captures the best of the first-person style of Metroid while doing it in its own ambient, atmospheric style. Super Metroid combines both."

Metroid,3c2qze,extalentagent,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:47:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, there won't be a Metroid game for WiiU. Right now there's not even a clear plan for a NX Metroid game - it's in pre-production/conceptual right now with a couple competing ideas.   More info: Zelda will be a cross-release for WiiU and NX (a-la Twilight Princess) though they're having trouble making it ""fun"" right now. Big concern internally as it's a deviation from perceived Zelda fans' ""expectations"" and ""perception"" of Zelda gameplay.   Most resources are being shifted to the NX, the internal consensus being that WiiU is a lost cause, and better to spend that money making the NX Wii-levels of successful. Even games that have been in the works for WiiU for almost three years are being reworked for NX. Aim is $199 price point but $250 is more likely at the moment.  NX is for home, not a hybrid. But a lot of Netflix/PS Plus in the intended offering. The NX mobile variant will be separate hardware/software, with similar intentions.  There's a lot of conversation at N right now about how media delivery ownership (i.e. DVDs, CDs, other physical delivery mechanisms of a media license) gave way to digital media downloads as ownership, which gave way to media ""rental"" via streaming - i.e. netflix/spotify/etc. as an all-in paid video service, and youtube as a free music/video delivery service via search. Lots of ""value of individual piece of content versus value of sum total of content"" conversations. NX is aimed to be the first step in marrying the two. NX mobile variant is the second."

And if you want a real challenge, try beating this without a guide. To  be real though, I dont think anyone has beaten this game without a guide. It has a lot of puzzles, not mechanical ones, but story ones. You find stone tablets with something written on it, and its extremly metaphorical (is that a word)? Just a recommendation, if you happen to run out of Metroidvania games. Seriously though, it is extremly hard, and you will die randomly. There are even achievments for getting killed by something you wont expect.  I feel like this game deserves more attention, I see no one talking about it."
Metroid,3bw5oj,KarjarA,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:01:14 2015 UTC,It's in my queue on Steam. I just have to get through the other 300 games first.  I think I have a problem.

Metroid,3bw5oj,henryuuk,21,Thu Jul 2 18:23:18 2015 UTC,"No, but most people that are like you don't spread it around as much, which causes the complainers/defenders their points to be heard more."
Metroid,3bw5oj,MonochromeTyrant,17,Thu Jul 2 18:29:17 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly open to trying the game out but I'm still bitter towards it because we're getting this instead of what we really wanted.  I'm more worried about the Metroid Prime series in general. If Federation Force bombs, it could potentially be the final nail in the coffin. If it succeeds, we may get sequels in the same style. I dread both of those outcomes."
Metroid,3bw5oj,KingBroly,6,Thu Jul 2 19:04:23 2015 UTC,"I'm more worried about the Metroid Prime series in general. If Federation Force bombs, it could potentially be the final nail in the coffin. If it succeeds, we may get sequels in the same style. I dread both of those outcomes.   Honestly, this is a silly concern when one considers Nintendo's history, especially given what Nintendo said at E3 2014 about planning for Metroid's future.  Call it ""neglected"", but the reality is that it's a niche series that's harder to plan for than, say, Zelda. Hence, it can be some margin of time between various games. However, unlike an IP like F-Zero or Earthbound, Nintendo has nothing else in its stable that fills that same genre. If they were done with Metroid -- if a single ""bomb"" was able to effectively kill the IP -- it would have happened with Other M, they wouldn't even be bothering with this title.  What this title aims to do, in my opinion, is increase Metroid's appeal and introduce the IP to a wider audience without watering down the traditional games. If the game succeeds, we'll see more Galactic Federation (or other side-group) spin-offs that serve to expand the Metroid universe -- this won't become the standard for the entire franchise. If it fails, they'll either give it another chance and improve on what they saw as missteps or head back to the drawing board for a completely new attempt at something within the Metroid universe. Either way, traditional Metroid (be it 2D or 3D) isn't dead and it's a bit dramatic of people to be saying so."
Metroid,3bw5oj,KingBroly,-2,Thu Jul 2 19:35:13 2015 UTC,"if a single ""bomb"" was able to effectively kill the IP -- it would have happened with Other M   But Other M didn't bomb (1.31 million copies were sold worldwide). And that's likely because the buzz before its release was pretty positive. Right now the buzz about Federation Force is overwhelmingly negative. The trailer on youtube currently has 71,617 dislikes vs 7,587 likes. That worries me.   What this title aims to do, in my opinion, is increase Metroid's appeal and introduce the IP to a wider audience   If they succeed in doing that then Federation Force will undoubtedly sell better than recent Metroid games. If this new style sells better than the traditional one, then why would they ever go back to the traditional style? Not to mention that the traditional style takes up much more time and resources."
Metroid,3bw5oj,KingBroly,5,Thu Jul 2 20:33:44 2015 UTC,"You're not quoting VG Chartz are you?  Because they're not reliable in the slightest.  Other M never sold over 1 million copies.  It shipped 500k in the US, and most of those are still on store shelves to this day, in Metroid's biggest and most popular region.  Keep in mind they were expecting to sell 1.5 million copies in this region alone of Other M."
Metroid,3bw5oj,MonochromeTyrant,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:46:33 2015 UTC,Other M never sold over 1 million copies. It shipped 500k in the US   Yes I found the number from VG Chartz. So what's your source then?
Metroid,3bw5oj,Ill_Made_Knight,3,Fri Jul 3 10:53:27 2015 UTC,Reggie's interview with Kotaku from October 2010.
Metroid,3bw5oj,MatrixChicken,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:57:26 2015 UTC,That interview took place only 2 months after the release of the game and before the holiday season. It definitely sold more by the end of the year. I think VG Chartz is a more reliable source than an old interview with Reggie.
Metroid,3bw5oj,The_True_Zed,3,Fri Jul 3 11:08:04 2015 UTC,"VG Chartz isn't reliable at all.  Everyone laughs at VG Chartz.  Stores couldn't even sell copies of Other M for $5-$10 on clearance 3 months after launch, let alone $50. It sold abysmally."
Metroid,3bw5oj,MikeOShay,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:49:04 2015 UTC,What better source is there for sales numbers? I would rather trust a website than anecdotal evidence
Metroid,3bw5oj,VoyagerOrchid,5,Fri Jul 3 12:12:39 2015 UTC,"If they succeed in doing that then Federation Force will undoubtedly sell better than recent Metroid games. If this new style sells better than the traditional one, then why would they ever go back to the traditional style? Not to mention that the traditional style takes up much more time and resources.   This argument could be applied to any of Nintendo's IPs. If one style of Mario sells better than another, why do they keep wasting resources on the one with lesser returns? If one style of Zelda sells better than another, why do they keep wasting resources on the one with lesser returns? If Melee was the best Smash game, why did they waste resources making changes for Brawl? If Brawl sold better than Melee, why did they continue to change things up for Smash 3DS/Wii U? If Star Fox 64 was received so well, why did they make Adventures?  My point is that Nintendo, believe it or not, knows what they're doing. IP management is one of their fortes, and they're not known for just tossing aside a genre. Improving upon it? Absolutely. Moving away from it for a while to shake things up? Yes, they do this. People can choose to accept that or make baseless claims about how Nintendo has abandoned or will abandon the traditional Metroid setup and IP."
Metroid,3bw5oj,Waldorf_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:39:42 2015 UTC,"IP management is one of their fortes   I don't think Nintendo managed their IP very well in this case. I think that's related to them not being more in tune with their core fans. They should have known that trying to ""shake things up"" after a wait of 5 years would not go over well. The massive initial negative reaction will definitely hurt the overall sales of the game."
Metroid,3bw5oj,jz88k,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:27:11 2015 UTC,"I can't answer all of those questions, but I know Adventures originally not going to be part of the Star Fox franchise and instead be called Dinosaur Planet with Krystal as the protagonist. But then Nintendo decided that the game wasn't going to sell so they turned it into Star Fox game to boost sales. I can't shake the feeling that Nintendo did the same thing with FF. If Nintendo really knew what it was doing then Other M would have never happened."
Metroid,3bw5oj,rondo_of_blood,8,Fri Jul 3 16:52:55 2015 UTC,"Nah. I'm actually warming up to it. Nintendo games are often better at release than in trailers. Both visually and mechanically. Everyone thought Splatoon was just an online-only eShop title when it was revealed last year, but now it's a full-blown, big new IP with more weapons, maps and modes being added all the time... I think there's much more to this game than many think."

You can state your opinion of the game all you want, but don't spout untrue statements about it being a different game than it is."
Metroid,3bw5oj,lastpally,13,Thu Jul 2 18:46:18 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you define a Metroid game. If the name is enough, then yeah, this is a Metroid game. But if gameplay and such matter to you, then no, this is not a Metroid game."
Metroid,3bw5oj,TotakaK,-4,Thu Jul 2 18:53:21 2015 UTC,"Gameplay matter very much to me. The thing is, we haven't seen everything of this game yet. We haven't seen what these interviews have been talking about. It's far too early to make a judgement on this game yet.  It's very clear that this game will at least tie in heavily with the story of the other Metroid games. And it may very well end up being similar in gameplay to other Metroid games, but that remains to be seen. The fact is, this is not just any old game with the Metroid name slapped on.

On top of that, the song manages to fit in the choir AND the 8-bit elements, merging the different eras of Brinstar themes.  The Metroid Prime intro just fits the feel of the game so well.

Metroid,3bsprv,TheZaxvo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:43:57 2015 UTC,I liked the Other M visual style and gameplay and it was a pretty fun game.  I don't even have a problem with the fact that she takes orders (after all she takes them in Prime 3).    I just don't like the fact that she was whiny.  Other M would actually be good if they re-wrote the cutscenes in a way that fit Samus's character.
Metroid,3bsprv,damanlyguy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:07:04 2015 UTC,"I too liked the visual style and gameplay -- and in fact, I'm in the middle of a hard mode playthrough right now. The gameplay really comes into it's own on hard mode; regular mode was just way too easy I found.  Samus has been taking orders as far back as the original games, if you want to get technical about it. They did order her to SR388 to eradicate the Metroids, right. And the orders she took in Prime 3 fall in line with that. In Other M, however, Adam was giving orders way too frequently and it gives the impression that he doesn't trust Samus or the player.  As for the whining, it was pretty bad. Just overall the plot was too contrived and made little sense, and the fact that Samus' character was so weak just made it worse.  But yeah, the visual style was actually pretty cool and the set piece shown in the artwork is a pretty standout scene, and the art does a good job of calling back to that scene.  In the end, it's a great piece of artwork. My original comment was more just noticing the irony that even the most reviled entry in the series gets fanart."

Metroid,3bs3k4,Darkurai,18,Wed Jul 1 18:21:57 2015 UTC,"The main reason why I linked this was actually because of this.   I've always been thinking about having a battle between the Galactic Federation and Space Pirates. The Metroid Prime series fits between Metroid 2 and Super Metroid, as you may be aware. So it falls under that same timeline, but looking at it from a different perspective. You may be able to see Samus in the game...   This threw me off for a second. Hasn't it been established that the Prime series takes place between Metroid and Metroid II: Return of Samus? Super Metroid is a direct sequel to Metroid II.  If you look in the Metroid Prime instruction booklet, it reads:   But the Space Pirates were far from finished. They immediately split their survivors into two main camps. One headed to Zebes to begin rebuilding their ravaged facility and resuscitating Mother Brain, Ridley, and Kraid. The second set out in search of a planet with powerful energy resources. They didn't search far before they discovered Tallon IV, which was still emanating huge pulses of energy from the Phazon contained beneath the Chozo temple. Entranced by the massive potential of the strange mutagen, they immediately moved in, retrofitting their laboratories, transporters, and life-support systems into the Chozo Ruins.   Then later, at the bottom of the very same page...   The Space Pirates also transported many species to their orbiting ship for zero-G Phazon experiments, unaware that Samus Aran had finally tracked their ship to its low orbit. As they continued with their unnatural experiments, Samus sped toward Tallon IV, preparing to wipe them out once and for all...   These paragraphs always made it clear to me that the enemies that survived the events of Metroid split up, one group becoming the enemies faced in Super Metroid and the other immediately becoming the enemies faced in Prime I. And that Samus followed the latter group after the events of Metroid.   So all of a sudden he's saying Prime takes place between Return of Samus and Super. I'm pretty sure it's a mistake because it makes little sense.  EDIT: Possible theory is that the translation is off. Maybe he meant that Federation Force takes place between Return of Samus and Super, but then that wouldn't put it within the Prime timeline, which is odd."
Metroid,3bs3k4,ryanoh,6,Wed Jul 1 18:29:20 2015 UTC,"There's also really not a lot of time between Return of Samus and Super. It can be assumed that Samus dropped off The Baby™ very quickly after Return of Samus, and the introduction to Super shows that she hadn't been gone long when Ceres Station's distress signal went off."
Metroid,3bs3k4,RidleyBro,2,Wed Jul 1 19:17:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly. In fact, Metroid II to the end of Other M is presented as pretty much a continuous story. One game leads directly into the other. It could be argued that Other M leads to Fusion but I don't think it's that significant to say that Fusion is a direct sequel to Other M, whereas I'd say Super is a direct sequel to II and Other M to Super."
Metroid,3bs3k4,Dubiono,-4,Wed Jul 1 20:37:58 2015 UTC,"Hasn't it been established that the Prime series takes place between Metroid and Metroid II: Return of Samus? Super Metroid is a direct sequel to Metroid II.   I was pretty sure that upon the release of Other: M the Prime games weren't canon anymore, or were ""alternate universe"" stories at best. Am I wrong or did this change?"
Metroid,3bs3k4,Dubiono,0,Wed Jul 1 20:22:18 2015 UTC,"Sakamoto said they weren't canon in an interview iirc but I, and a majority of Metroid fans, don't consider it valid (I've contended that he just meant it wasn't part of the main story, which is true, it's not). Considering there's such little overlap between the Prime games and the main story, whether or not it's actually canon means very little. Though it definitely is.  And, either way, its status of canon still doesn't decide where it falls on the timeline.  EDIT: Sakamoto never said that in an interview, so I guess I just thought he did. I don't think he ever intended to retcon anything. Either way, it's kind of a moot point."
Metroid,3bs3k4,wreckingcanon,8,Wed Jul 1 20:36:53 2015 UTC,"I think that Sakamoto never said that the Prime games weren't canon, merely that while he was doing Other M he didn't take into consideration the events of the Prime trilogy because they were a different story (which makes sense, the Prime trilogy is pretty self-contained and has no reason to affect the events in Other M).  I think this all ""Other M retconned the Prime games"" is just a misunderstanding born from a misunderstood interview and Other M's terrible writing itself. Sakamoto himself most likely consider the Prime games canon, even if he didn't directly work on them."
Metroid,3bs3k4,0ddBaillie,3,Wed Jul 1 21:27:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with this, this makes sense. I don't think Sakamoto ever intended to overwrite or retcon any Metroid again."
Metroid,3bs3k4,The_M4G,2,Wed Jul 1 23:53:49 2015 UTC,Of course he didn't intend to retcon it. Why go out of your way to retcon something whose existence you don't factor into your stories?  And in a way he wanted to retcon the way we interpreted Samus; that much can be said. He stated in multiple interviews that he believed the Prime games gave people the wrong impression of Samus that he wanted to properly convey.
Metroid,3bs3k4,The_M4G,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:10:24 2015 UTC,"The Prime trilogy affects how Samus interacts with the Federation, considering that she is given huge freedoms in Prime 3 compared to Other M.

Metroid,3bs3k4,MatrixChicken,3,Wed Jul 1 23:32:56 2015 UTC,I really just think it has to do with the 3DS. It only has so much processing power. Running 4-man missions without it being completely chopping means they can't make it too graphically intensive I'd imagine.

It's just hard to swallow that it could be another 5 years before we get anything that really feels like Metroid."
Metroid,3buu3a,ArokLazarus,6,Thu Jul 2 12:28:18 2015 UTC,Try waiting nearly 10 years (Super Metroid > Metroid Prime). I saved up my lunch money for three weeks to buy that game when it came out in 2002.
Metroid,3buu3a,SGT3386,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:54:04 2015 UTC,"Hah, that's awesome. And I'm 29, I started with Metroid 2 in the beginning. But I was actually very happy with Metroid Prime(not so much the others in the Trilogy). I agree nothing else really comes close to Metroid 3, but new can be a good thing. Once you've made your Magnum Opus in one style, I think it's good to expand into new territory. Still, the formula at the heart of Metroid isn't present in this new Hunters style game from what I've seen."
Metroid,3buu3a,The_M4G,2,Thu Jul 2 14:35:10 2015 UTC,"I can relate when I started playing prime from the 2d metroids. I was reluctant to try prime, but games do serve a chance. Turned out to be an awesome series.  Same thing with TLOZ Wind Waker. Its cartoony animation turned me off all together, up until recently I played the HD version. Man was I wrong about judging.  I think I'll be giving this new metroid game a chance, like the article said, just approach it at a different angle."
Metroid,3buu3a,legonro,2,Thu Jul 2 17:10:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly, Wind Waker was the same for me and is one of my favorite Zeldas despite how dumb I thought the concept was at first. Nintendo likes to experiment with beloved and well defined work, and most of the time it results in something at least interesting. As a massive Metroid fan, I'll probably never really see this as a Metroid title. But I'll give it a chance and hope to be surprised."

Metroid,3btik7,Seekerman,3,Thu Jul 2 01:56:01 2015 UTC,"This Gamasutra article describes how the developers of Metroid II used the limitations of the Gameboy (4 shades of gray or green, 4-channel chiptune sound, tiny screen) to create a claustrophobic atmosphere of dread and foreboding that underscores the brutal nature of what Samus must do (i.e. commit mass genocide against the entire Metroid species.) AM2R, on the other hand, has none of the same limitations and plays and looks a lot more like Super Metroid or Zero Mission. I think it's an excellent engine for making a Super Metroid-like game, but it doesn't have the same atmosphere as the original. Play both and you'll see what I mean."

The second installment and the first handheld title in the Metroid series, it was released in North America in November 1991, and in Japan and Europe the following year. The story of Metroid II follows the protagonist and playable character Samus Aran, who is sent on a mission to exterminate the Metroid creatures from their home planet SR388 before the antagonistic Space Pirates obtain and use them. The gameplay of Metroid II focuses on killing a fixed number of Metroids before the player can advance deeper through the planet's tunnels.

Such palettes were carried over to the Game Boy Advance but aren't included in Virtual Console titles. The Super Game Boy did have a palette built into it for Metroid II.  The version I'm referring to is based on the cancelled Metroid II DX that Nintendo intended to release for Game Boy Color but never did. Metroid II DX would have been similar to Link's Awakening DX or Tetris DX in that it would have mostly just added color to a previously released game.

Metroid,3bs3gx,k1183,3,Wed Jul 1 19:06:12 2015 UTC,I see... but then that raises the question of how there is a Queen Metroid in Other M. I thought BOTTLE Ship didn't have any environments that matched SR388's ecosystem.  edit: Also are all metroids female? or do males just become omegas and females become queens?
Metroid,3bs3gx,metroidman388,2,Wed Jul 1 19:23:35 2015 UTC,"All metroids on an SR388 ecosystem should mature into an Omega, and some can mature further into a Queen.  Unclear what the requirements are for that.  The omega in fusion and the queen in other m were both clones of the baby.  As to how there was a queen on the bottle ship: could be there was an SR388-like ecosystem that just wasn't disclosed for whatever reason.  Could be the metroid was genetically altered during the cloning process, or something else was done to induce maturation into a queen.  We already know that federation scientists knew how to speed up the maturation process in fusion.  The thing is there are lots of little plot points that don't fully add up if you look for them throughout the series.  The series is mostly known for gameplay, and not an intricate lore.  Attempts to reconcile inconsistencies moves into the realm of speculation and fan theory.  Personally, I wouldn't worry too much about tying in plot lines from other m to the rest of the series, as it introduced much more jarring plot inconsistencies than any other title."
Metroid,3bs3gx,T33p0,3,Wed Jul 1 20:01:16 2015 UTC,Fair enough... It's just Metroid 2 and Fusion are my favorite games and I just wish the other metroid forms would get more attention.
Metroid,3bs3gx,AuraRyu,2,Wed Jul 1 20:09:10 2015 UTC,"Problem being that Fusion, at least in theory, plays an unspecified amount of time after Other M, which means they would have had enough time to figure that out by then. It does not necessarily mean such methods were readily available at the point in time Other M takes place, meaning that for all we know (which isn't much) they would have had to recreate the SR388 ecosystem aboard the Bottle Ship and let the Queen mature naturally. Also it could be entirely possible that said ecosystem replica was housed in Sector Zero, which was detached and blown to hell.   What doesn't quite make sense to me is why the Queen was moved out of Sector Zero before the place was detached. One possible explanation I could think of would be that since the Queen is the most valuable specimen, as it can create additional Metroids by giving birth to them, it was moved out of Sector Zero by virtue of a secret elevator leading to the room we later fight her in.  edit: tl;dr: Other M's focus on story is dumb as hell and poorly executed with logical inconsistencies and other weird shit. For what we know, Samus might as well have hallucinated the entire incident, still being completely distraught over the loss of the baby Metroid. That'd be the ultimate kick in the teeth."
Metroid,3bs3gx,metroidman388,4,Thu Jul 2 09:53:54 2015 UTC,I think they just put the queen in to deliver original fanservice and failed horribly. I get the idea that the animals in the bottleship are clones but the way they got their data is stupid.
Metroid,3bs3gx,Screwattack94,2,Thu Jul 2 01:15:50 2015 UTC,"Yup, lots of poorly done fan service throughout.  Seeing the queen in 3D was pretty cool though; Phantoon was alright; Nightmare just seemed silly, and it steals the thunder from Fusion being your first introduction chronologically."

Metroid,3bohwe,spiralingtides,9,Wed Jul 1 02:03:10 2015 UTC,"No and I never really considered her a Princess either, not to mention when Disney markets her in that line it's always the prettied up Mulan with make up and in that dress from that one scene with the Matchmaker which we all know was not who Mulan was at all."

Metroid,3bohwe,Prodigy-II,2,Wed Jul 1 10:11:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of your list with the single exception of Palutena. She is more of an authority or source of guidance; roles not characteristic of a Disney Princess. The Disney Princess is usually the recipient of said guidance (this applies to Mulan and Elsa just as well.)  That said, I wouldn't be at all surprised if they did it anyways. She would make a wonderful Disney Princess."

Metroid,3bqulx,grey_lollipop,15,Wed Jul 1 12:22:47 2015 UTC,You may want to check the Gameplay footage of FF. It steps away from Metroidvania to become 4 player coop FPS.
Metroid,3bqulx,Screwattack94,14,Wed Jul 1 12:27:34 2015 UTC,"I know. It will probably not be that good in that aspect, but that doesn't make it a bad game.  Kinda like Mario and Mario Kart, totally different games, but both are still good and fit into the Mario universe.  I think that FF is similiar, sure it's not Metroidvania, but just like Mario Kart it makes sense from a Metroid perspective, a game like this is what I would expect a Federation game to be like, the federation would probably not send a single soldier to a planet to exterminate an entire species, destroy a super computer and a few other things, they would probably send a bunch of soldiers and shoot stuff."
Metroid,3bqulx,CMK1982,17,Wed Jul 1 12:35:42 2015 UTC,I jonestly like OPs positivity towards the possibility of Federation Force not being the worst game ever :) Ill giver it the benefit of the doubt and give it a try!
Metroid,3bqulx,Father_Brain,-6,Wed Jul 1 14:21:05 2015 UTC,"Well, Prime is essentially a Metroid version of GoldenEye 64, so by removing the Metroid gameplay elements from the game we get GE with a Metroid skin, and GE is definately is a good game.  The only thing missing now is the Multiplayer from GE, but Blast Ball is quite innovative and actually doesn't seem too bad."
Metroid,3bqulx,Father_Brain,8,Wed Jul 1 15:21:23 2015 UTC,Prime is essentially a Metroid version of GoldenEye 64   Uh...how's that? The two games aren't remotely similar other than both being FPS and having free-roaming levels (and in GE you were restricted to one level depending on your current mission).
Metroid,3bqulx,Father_Brain,-2,Wed Jul 1 16:06:27 2015 UTC,"If GE had been a PC game, Prime could definately have been a total conversion mod for it, sure, they're not too similiar, many FPS games worked that way back then, but I still like to compare the two, and with FF we certainly have a game that brings the series closer to eachother. I guess there are games closer to Prime, but GE is close enough IMO and also happens to be a fantastic game.  If I told you that Nintendo is making a GE style game with characters from Metroid or a Metroid game without metroid, what sounds better? Probably the first since it has metroid added to it, not removed."
Metroid,3bqulx,Father_Brain,5,Wed Jul 1 16:29:27 2015 UTC,"If GE had been a PC game, Prime could definately have been a total conversion mod for it   That would basically require rewriting the entire game.

If I told you that Nintendo is making a GE style game with characters from Metroid or a Metroid game without metroid, what sounds better? Probably the first since it has metroid added to it, not removed.   Yes the first case but I'm still confused why your only frame of reference is GE. Just because they're including multiplayer doesn't make it ""GE style.""   To be clear, you can argue that there are similarities between the two games. However, saying ""Prime is essentially a Metroid version of GoldenEye 64"" is completely false."

Metroid,3bqulx,MasterEmp,-1,Wed Jul 1 21:56:36 2015 UTC,"Does games have to be the exact same to be similiar? No.  I think the best example would be Metroid Prime and Castlevania: Harmony of Despair.  Metroid Prime has a huge open world, is singleplayer, takes place in space, allows you to scan items and has energy weapons.  Castlevania HD has levels, has multiplayer, takes place inside a castle, there's no backstory avaible by scanning and you fight with normal weapons. (I haven't played it however, so I might be wrong, feel free to correct me.)  I guess you do have a point in that they're not that similiar, but IMO, they're not that far away, maybe human-monkey far away? The early FPS genre is very similiar to games like Zelda or Metroid, they both feature exploration, fighting, items to collect and so on. GoldenEye and Prime are definately related, and FF is probably the missing link between them."
Metroid,3bqulx,Donald_Crump,2,Wed Jul 1 17:03:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not certain actually, you have some really good points, but it's probably the way you control the game that is pulling a prank on me.  You see, both games have very similiar controls, I think those controls were common in the past but I haven't played that many old FPS games lately."
Metroid,3bqulx,MasterEmp,2,Wed Jul 1 17:48:53 2015 UTC,"You see, both games have very similiar controls, I think those controls were common in the past   Oh that's absolutely true. GE and the original MP were both on systems that lacked a second analog stick (I'm excluding the GCNs tiny c-stick here). The gameplay is kind of like driving a tank. Of course there's nothing wrong with that."
Metroid,3bqulx,BlockyAnubis,5,Wed Jul 1 17:59:51 2015 UTC,"But there's the problem. Nintendo isn't talking about it like it's a spinoff. They're trying to make it a main-series game. Even worse, they're calling it a Prime game!"

I'm glad they know people aren't happy, but...when a franchise has been away for a long time, did you really expect people to welcome a spinoff with open arms? If there was a Fusion or Prime sequel announced along with it, no one would be mad, I imagine.   Still, the level of negativity has gotten pretty silly, too.

Metroid,3bo711,Puppetute,5,Tue Jun 30 21:12:21 2015 UTC,"Hope so! Really wish a Fusion sequel or other 2D type title would be in the picture. It's clear that Prime is most likely not happening due to high budgets and resources needed and such, but a Fusion sequel could be done on a smaller budget and have a wider appeal (with how many 2D Metroidvania indie titles have surfaced over the years).  Here's hoping to an announcement beginning of next year or end of this one! After all, Samus did pretty much blow up a Galactic Federation base by the end of it, and with this new title being about the GF forces, what better game to follow up with?"
Metroid,3bo711,Butter_Is_Life,3,Tue Jun 30 21:24:24 2015 UTC,"with how many 2D Metroidvania indie titles have surfaced over the years   [Maybe you don't but the quoted comment makes me think you do] People tend to think this proves there's a market for 2D Metroidvania games and I don't think anyone would disagree, but those are indie titles with indie prices that range from $5-$20. It's a much harder sell to get people to buy a Metroidvania title for $40-$60."
Metroid,3bo711,stonefacade,2,Tue Jun 30 21:32:58 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think that a 2D Fusion sequel for $39.99 would sell pretty well, people don't seem to have that much an issue picking up Nintendo titles for full/discount price with a few small exceptions. Indie titles I feel like are a harder sell unless word of mouth, developer reputation, or a small price draws buyers in, but that's just me theorizing, I'm no economist."
Metroid,3bo711,Butter_Is_Life,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:34:50 2015 UTC,"Yep, suppose I'm theorizing the opposite though. Indie titles may be lesser known, but a) most are either multiplatform or on Steam/PC b) easy to impulse buy at prices less than half the price of the Fusion sequel.  But even all that aside, let's not forget, Sakamoto himself doesn't seem all that thrilled to return to developing Metroid."
Metroid,3bo711,stonefacade,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:48:18 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I forgot that a lot of the latest indie Metroidvanias have an easier time on PC, with Steam sales, modding, bigger install base, etc.  I really don't think Sakamoto is required for a Fusion sequel. If he doesn't want to make a 2D Metroid, they could still get Retro or Intelligent Systems involved. I just hope there's no legal binding that prevents a Fusion sequel because of him....."
Metroid,3bo711,Butter_Is_Life,2,Tue Jun 30 22:45:59 2015 UTC,"True. It just seems like one more hurdle for them to jump over, rather than one of the creators pitching the idea to Nintendo himself."
Metroid,3bo711,stonefacade,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:48:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it might not be a legal problem, but maybe one of respect by not bypassing the creator."
Metroid,3bo711,Butter_Is_Life,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:53:34 2015 UTC,That would be an interesting game. Especially if they had a splinter cell of GF forces that teamed up with space pirates.
Metroid,3bo711,Puppetute,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:38:48 2015 UTC,"I seem to be in the unpopular boat here, but my biggest gripe with MPFF is that it's a 3DS game. I've been very disappointed with every handheld game that isn't Pokemon in the last ten years, I'm only holding onto my 3DS right now solely for the purpose of breeding competitive shiny Pokemon. If I'm spending hundreds of dollars on game hardware, it better be modern, the 3DS is a very cheap experience for me; build quality feels cheap, graphics are super dated, the 3D does not enhance my experience, and all the games are super kiddy; I'm a grownass working man, none of this appeals to me. Unless Nintendo can compete with PS4 level quality and maturity (and I feel Metroid can easily be their IP to focus on here in this regard, they've always been exceptionally beautiful and top-notch in pretty much any regard) I just cannot be bothered to give them my money. I feel like I've outgrown Nintendo, their products are all just very toy-like, Metroid and Zelda are really all they've got to keep my attention."

Metroid,3bo711,The_M4G,5,Tue Jun 30 21:52:24 2015 UTC,"I feel like FF has potential but was just announced at the wrong time.  Now is not the time for a spinoff, especially with Metroid starved fans waiting for an excellent prime (3d) game or side scroller.  If Nintendo waited a bit after releasing an actual Metroid game and then released this spinoff the reactions would have been so much more positive.."
Metroid,3bo711,IcedKappaccino,4,Wed Jul 1 02:21:14 2015 UTC,"Sure, but it doesn't help matters that it looks like an N64 game."
Metroid,3bo711,KingBroly,14,Wed Jul 1 13:38:07 2015 UTC,I'm okay with change. I just want change that's good and makes sense. Change for change's sake is not good.

Seems like more often than they would like, they just end up breaking things.  Sometimes change can be very good,but this doesn't seem like the kind of change that would get most of us excited."
Metroid,3bo711,joecb91,2,Wed Jul 1 02:23:07 2015 UTC,"It's just odd to me that they want to ""transform"" the franchise, but then they do a first-person shooter on the 3DS? Hunters did that on the DS years ago. And yet on a platform where Metroid would actually excel more than most games, where you can put all the relevant information on the bottom screen, a traditional 2D Metroid exists nowhere.  Very odd that they would opt out of this very clear opportunity to cater to old (Metroid) and new (general 3DS owners) fans."
Metroid,3bo711,Weltall548,2,Wed Jul 1 02:28:38 2015 UTC,"They don't even need to do a 2.5D game on the 3DS either, so many of us would be throwing money at them for a sprite based game that likely would be inexpensive to make.  You would think that they would have tried to make something taking place after Fusion by now."

Metroid,3bopa0,TTSsox,7,Tue Jun 30 22:22:32 2015 UTC,"Tanabe is quick to point out that he isn’t in charge of all of Metroid. That’s Nintendo producer Yoshio Sakamoto. So while it’s still possible that a Wii U Metroid is in the offing, it just won’t be from Tanabe’s Prime offshoot series.   God. The way they treat Prime like a spin off is downright insulting, it's as if it doesn't deserve to be held in the same regard as the 2D titles.   And then there's Sakamoto being the only hand on Metroid that bugs me. The man's sexist mind is literally poison on the series, and yet Nintendo leaves him in charge. Japanese respect is so weird. They were so willing to throw Gunpei Yokoi under the bus for the Virtual Boy mistake, but they let the Metroid brand be damaged by letting Sakamoto have the full reins? Sheesh."
Metroid,3bopa0,Dubiono,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:02:07 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's wired magazine. I doubt they are the experts on what is a ""offshoot"" story ala Prime versus what Nintendo is actually releasing. Most metroid games haven't had that much overlap, in the grand scheme of things.  So whatever Wired's writer says, that's not a huge deal.  The Prime series is full canon in my opinion."
Metroid,3bopa0,VoyagerOrchid,0,Thu Jul 2 04:07:41 2015 UTC,Nintendo has always treated Prime like a spinoff. Other M was just the first official confirmation. The fact the new game has the Prime name is just another point in that direction.
Metroid,3bopa0,Dubiono,4,Thu Jul 2 04:23:28 2015 UTC,"There seem to be a lot of traditonalists in the Nintendo elite who have become stuck in their ways. Tanabe doesn't strike me as one. From what I've read, he has experience with a lot of different and interesting projects, and probably has a much better idea of ""which way the wind is blowing"" for the gaming world.  Expect this guy to make big changes and do great things if he ever moves up the company's ranks."
Metroid,3bopa0,Wind123,2,Wed Jul 1 00:06:07 2015 UTC,"He makes great games, that's for sure. I've no doubt that this game will be great in it's own right. The funny thing is though, that people see games before they play them, and playing them costs money."

Metroid,3bopa0,Dubiono,-1,Tue Jun 30 23:59:04 2015 UTC,"No, I'm... I'm done. Just reading that crushed whatever remaining hope I had for this series. 2002-2007 was the golden age, and it's over. If there is a future for Metroid, Sakamoto's got his shitty hands all over it. Prime is invalidated as a ""separate canon"", Samus is established as a crybaby who is compelled to take orders from the nearest man, and we end up waiting ten years between games as a rule. It's over."
Metroid,3bopa0,The_M4G,3,Wed Jul 1 00:05:05 2015 UTC,"I mean, the fact that Tanabe wants to continue prime 4 and it IS separate from ""metroid"" (meaning sakamoto won't be involved in Prime) is a good thing isn't it? I'd much rather this situation than them put sakamoto in charge of the prime series as well, no?  I mean, who cares what nintendo calls canon anyways? People don't completely agree with the zelda timeline for instance. I'd say use Nintendo's ""canon"" as more of a guideline, but the community is ultimately the one to decide whats important and whats not."
Metroid,3bopa0,AtomKick,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:36:54 2015 UTC,"Prime being relegated to spin off status cheapens the entire series. What the hell is wrong with Samus having done all of these things? Don't retcon prime, retcon other m!"
Metroid,3bopa0,The_M4G,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:38:25 2015 UTC,"I get that and I agree. I also would prefer a single connected canon and would rather not branch the Prime games from that canon. But honestly if the flipside means games like Other M are considered a different canon than Prime there is at least some upside. Considering we don't know how good or bad non Prime entries will be in the future, if we get more Other M's then it could end up being a blessing."
Metroid,3bopa0,AtomKick,0,Wed Jul 1 15:44:32 2015 UTC,If it's a different canon it means Samus never did anything badass in super Metroid or Metroid II or fusion. It's a terrible idea and the way they're treating the prime trilogy is absolutely insulting.
Metroid,3bopa0,The_M4G,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:45:54 2015 UTC,"I'm confused, where is it in the article that it says Prime is only a ""separate canon"".  An offshoot series doesn't mean it's off canon... And nintendo's official timeline had the Prime games in the series."
Metroid,3bopa0,VoyagerOrchid,0,Thu Jul 2 04:19:52 2015 UTC,With any luck Nintendo in it's state of impending doom starts selling off their less valuable ip. Starting with Metroid. Then someone who cares about it can pick it up.  I wonder how much Metroid would sell for in this day and age...
Metroid,3bopa0,spiralingtides,2,Wed Jul 1 03:16:24 2015 UTC,"I mean Sakamoto was in charge of Fusion wasn't he? Plus I'm pretty sure he was responsible for the combat in other M, which definitely had potential (just held back by wiimote only controls).  Sure there is a lot to dislike about Sakamoto's direction with the series, but I'm not completely counting him out to make another GOOD metroid game"
Metroid,3bopa0,AtomKick,2,Wed Jul 1 15:30:46 2015 UTC,"Sakamoto was penned as the Scenario Writer for Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion. I know he gets a lot of hate and while I certainly believe he's to blame for Other M's script (He wrote it after all), he's not complete poison for the series. His goal with Other M was very specific, characterize Samus and show her emotional side, which didn't go over well at all. When he's taking a more supervisory role and given just the scenarios and overall plot to write, he does good. Just don't give him a role as big as Other M again and it'll be fine."

Metroid,3blfuo,xooxanthellae,12,Tue Jun 30 09:14:52 2015 UTC,"I'll be the asshole to reiterate: this article sheds light on many of the things that make a prime game (and metroid games in general) so amazing.   Very few of these elements work in a cooperative environment. :) that's right. You all know what I'm talking about.   The tight, purposeful level design, the complexity of the consequences that arise from killing (or not killing) certain or all the enemies in a room: all of that is lost when players 2, 3, and 4 enter the room and start bouncing around, blasting all the enemies, and then run to the next room.  I'll stop, because you've all read these arguments before, but it just seems that every analysis of past metroid games I read reinforces the idea that FF is gonna tank, and tank hard.

Metroid,3blfuo,30SecondstoMars,8,Tue Jun 30 11:53:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Prime 3 is okay. It's a decent adventure, but nowhere near the sense of isolation, discovery, and incredibly well-designed and original environments of 1 and 2. Also, 3 is relatively easy, as I did not die once in my first (and only) playthrough of 3. I definitely died a few times in 1, and significantly more in 2.   With that being said, the fighting is arguably more fun in 3, and there are a couple really cool planets/areas to explore."

Metroid,3blfuo,Zankou55,2,Tue Jun 30 14:44:05 2015 UTC,"This article is really interesting and I quite enjoyed it.  But I did take issue with one segment:   In fact, most of the regular enemies in Prime will never attack you directly. If you want a great litmus test for this – walk into any room in Prime and stand perfectly still. Almost every time, Samus can stay there indefinitely without getting hurt.   This is true, but only insofar as they aren't actively hunting you throughout the world.  That doesn't mean that they won't attack you directly.  There are plenty of enemies in the game that will actively seek to do you harm once they discover your presence in the area:   Sheegoths Reaper vines War wasps Beetles Burrowers Shriekbats Jelzaps Magmoors   The only real difference between Pirates and, say, Beetles, is that the radius of ""awareness"" for Pirates is larger.  Once you breach that radius, they will actively seek to engage you."

Metroid,3bnvv6,Arthurbodhi,4,Fri Jul 3 02:32:32 2015 UTC,"I've never taken a look at Dark Souls. The thing that puts me off is that it's an RPG (leveling up), I don't enjoy that kind of stuff. I don't like customization either (i.e. I'd have preferred Splatoon if the whole abilities in clothes thing wasn't there), it always feels like I have a choice between spending more time on gauging gear and customizing my character than actually playing the game, or just choosing stuff randomly / what feels like the best from its description alone (which is often way off). I'm not satisfied with either of those options.  What I like about Metroid games and linear games is that all this tweaking of my abilities isn't MY job, it was the developers' job and I just get to enjoy the end result.  So tell me, do you think I'd like Dark Souls? If it does have customization but to a very small degree, it would probably still be fine as long as the emphasis is put on gameplay first."
Metroid,3bnvv6,ariadesu,2,Tue Jun 30 20:15:34 2015 UTC,"It's fine. Dark Souls is good at giving you enough XP to beat the level without grinding, and also little enough XP to where if you do grind, you won't be able to easily break the game. Partially because the leveling system doesn't buff you very much, but mostly just limits access to certain tactics. They also do a very good job of having all gear be equally good. Just pick whatever gear you want and you'll be fine. There is a weapon upgrading system that you have to use. An un-upgraded sword won't be good enough further into the game. But if you upgrade Sword A or Sword B doesn't matter. Just try both for a minute and upgrade the one you like. Dark Souls is brilliantly made, I feel it's worth venturing slightly outside your comfort zone for."

Metroid,3bnvv6,StellarBull,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:55:46 2015 UTC,Your friend is right. The first game in particular has you traverse the labyrinthine asylum whilst coming across many pathways and items you can't reach without a particular gadget.

Metroid,3bp5ia,cheetahblades,5,Wed Jul 1 00:47:33 2015 UTC,"It is pretty sure that Sakamoto is at least nominally still in charge of the series, and probably also practically. Some don't like that, I in particular didn't like that news at all initially but when I calmed down I came to the conclusion that there's no reason to get desperate just because Sakamoto is still directing the series, at least not yet.  As far as I know Other M was the first time he truly screwed up. Sure, the game ended screwed up specifically because of him and the fact that he had absolute control over everything during production, but still Sakamoto was also the one directing the series since at least Super Metroid, if I recall correctly, and we can safely say that at least with Super Metroid he did a good job.  He has proven that he can make good games, he has also proven that he can make horrible decisions. If he's a smart guy he will have taken the fans' criticism at heart and will work in order to avoid making the same mistakes again; if he's not smart enough I expect Nintendo to be clever enough to rein him in and not let him take complete control over writing and production; if neither Nintendo nor Sakamoto have learned anything from Other M then there will be reasons to be agitated, but this is relatively unlikely.  Sakamoto being in charge again doesn't necessarily means the end of the world. It might, potentially, but there's also the chance that Other M was merely a freak accident and Sakamoto's portrayal of Samus was mostly an error born from terrible writing, and he just tried to tell the story of a badass bounty hunter that can also feel emotions. What we can do at this point is just wait and see and hope that the lesson was learned."

I always felt like I was being told exactly where to go and I never felt lost. Every map was just a simple loop in on itself at best and a straight line at worst.  I think one thing Other M got right was how Samus moved. She felt very agile and mobile. I think this was something that was lost a little bit in the Prime games, as great as they are. Controlling her was enjoyable and I liked the way she moved through the environment.  I thought the combat was okay. Nothing spectacular but I never got bored with it. It was functional and enjoyable. A lot like Super Metroid. That's fine because the 2D metroid games never really had a huge focus on combat. It was there, it worked and it was fun, but I'd never see it as the focus. Other than boss fights obviously.  Really though, if Other M had a well designed labyrinthine map then it would be a great game. Awful story aside of course. I played through it and finished and I think it's an okay game. I don't think it's great or anything but I do think the hate is overblown."

Metroid,3blrq0,etecoon3,9,Tue Jun 30 06:34:29 2015 UTC,"There are some weird lines in Other M, such as the one you mentioned about Samus not having worked with the GF. Tough I wouldn't so much contribute that to genuine retconning and more to the incredibly poor writing.  The theory mostly comes from the narrative dissonance. Samus has singlehandedly brought down planets, tanked entire space pirate bases and wiped out an entire species. If one reflects upon her actions in the ~20 years of cannon that preceded Other M then there is no reason for Samus to be able to do her job if she had PTSD shocks whenever Ridley popped his scaly claws."
Metroid,3blrq0,Mortimer42,3,Tue Jun 30 07:09:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think Sakamoto ever wanted to retcon anything. He was just making a game that plot-wise is unrelated from the Prime trilogy (hence the ""not taking Prime into consideration"" stuff), which is pretty self-contained anyway.  There are already plenty of legitimate reasons to hate on Other M, no need to make up stuff just to hate it some more I think."
Metroid,3blrq0,RidleyBro,2,Tue Jun 30 09:11:50 2015 UTC,Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.
Metroid,3blrq0,Mortimer42,5,Tue Jun 30 09:20:48 2015 UTC,"I hate to jerk on the metroid other m hate circle, but the issue arose with other M and sakamotos vision of samus and the metroid universe. Unfortunately, even after stating metroid prime trilogy as non-cannon, there are still bits of information in other M that conflict other games. Thats why there is such a big argument over it.  Do we take the most recent information as fact or the other previous information stated before?"
Metroid,3blrq0,Dyxlesci,4,Tue Jun 30 06:52:50 2015 UTC,"Non-canon is incorrect. The specific interview where Sakamoto talks about Prime is that Prime is simply a side-story of the ""main series"" (meaning all the 2D games). As to how Other M conflict with other games (which seems a rather bizarre thing to say given how those other games are by Sakamoto, who one would think has a final word on what costitutes a Metroid story. So ""his vision"" basically just means... all the existing Metroid games we've had gotten?)"
Metroid,3blrq0,ApolloGeist,2,Tue Jun 30 10:24:31 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. Has Nintendo said anything official on the subject? Like have they or Sakamoto actually stated MPT as non-cannon?

Metroid,3blrq0,DarkSamus987,3,Tue Jun 30 20:16:17 2015 UTC,"Because Sakamoto is a terrible writer.  Not only does the bad writing contradict Prime 3 but even after the 'Deleter' tries to kill Samus and his unit under orders of the 'Galactic Federation conspirators', AS WELL as GF Scientists trying to create bioweapons from clones, she is still seen working with them at the beginning of Fusion despite being fucked over.  (Also Adam dies but the Bottle Ship blows up anyway)  Almost everything about Other M breaks the canon, which is why it's non-canon IMO. If it had a minimal story it wouldn't have suffered any of this.  Sakamoto is a terrible writer."
Metroid,3blrq0,txcrnr,2,Tue Jun 30 11:11:48 2015 UTC,So I cannot for the life of me remember how the Deleter was dealt with. He was a big problem and then he kind of just wasn't. What happened there?
Metroid,3blrq0,DarkSamus987,2,Wed Jul 1 06:24:37 2015 UTC,"I figured it out! I waded through an online transcript of the game to figure it out.  The Deleter was James, and he was killed by MB. It is right after Samus gets the info from MB (thinking she is Madeline) and then leaves. The Deleter walks up to MB and you hear a gunshot. Turns out, MB can handle herself and killed the Deleter. It is only much later when you return to the area that you discover James' body. Samus treats it just like another one of the troops who died and never points out that he was the Deleter. Unless you connected it to the cutscene almost an hour ago, then you'll miss it.  I've played through this game twice normally, partway on hard mode, and watched the movie version twice. I never once picked up on this."

Metroid,3blrq0,LC_Music,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:19:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about the Primes, but Other M is probably considered Non-Canon because it doesn't star Samus anymore. Once upon a time, Samus Aran was an extraordinarily competent and self-assured power-armored fighter blasting and exploring her way through hordes of enemies. Other M stars a whining, incompetent Daddy's-Girl who has the resources to solve her own problems, but refuses to do so without permission from a father figure. The other games treated her femininity as a character detail that did not affect her competence in any way. Other M stripped off her power armor regularly in order to show off her over-sexualized body, made her reliant on male characters, and decided on a story theme of ""Motherhood."" In short, the protagonist of Other M is not Samus Aran."

Metroid,3blvg4,cleeseula,8,Tue Jun 30 07:22:10 2015 UTC,Yes. We get it now. Successful spin offs have been made.   To give the abridged version the reason it is hated is because of the ill-fitting chibi art style filtered through an engine that makes the whole thing look like a launch title for the N64. On top of that the game ditches the interesting setting and gameplay from the series to presents an utterly generic co-op shooter.  And while I'm not too much of an ego surfer to admit I am wrong I am not holding my breath for this spin off to become the next Fraiser.

You read all the lore and played all the games, and you're okay with that? It felt right? lol"
Metroid,3bhs3a,DarkSamus987,2,Tue Jun 30 11:45:27 2015 UTC,"It bases its strongest plot points on a manga literally nobody ever read. Also we have no idea if the manga is to be considered canon or not. And last - ""You need an AI to be able to control Metroids"". When was this established? Why send them to SR388 without an MB unit? Why grow them on the BSL without an MB unit? And to bring back the supposedly non-canon Prime Trilogy - why grow them on Tallon IV without an MB unit? Why take them to Aether without an MB unit? And don't get me started on the shit about Sector 0."
Metroid,3bhs3a,AuraRyu,6,Mon Jun 29 15:59:07 2015 UTC,"It isn't even completely consistent with the manga. One of the first things Samus does as a Federation member is ignore orders, but in other M she absolutely must follow Adam-senpai's instructions.  Should I use the grapple beam to grapple this rock? Oh, Boss says no? Oh gee, geuss I won't then."
Metroid,3bhs3a,MasterEmp,3,Mon Jun 29 17:29:40 2015 UTC,"I thought that was the one thing that was most consistent with the manga.  Adam doesn't trust her because she ignored orders in the manga, so she follows all of his pointless orders to prove that she's not as petty and rebellious as she used to be as a teenager. It may have been badly localized character development, but it was character development."

Metroid,3bhs3a,MasterEmp,3,Tue Jun 30 12:41:11 2015 UTC,"More like she goes back to being rebellious once she realizes it's the right thing to do at the time. This starts breaking down Samus' relationship with the Galactic Federation even further, leading into Fusion where she basically becomes the galaxy's most wanted outlaw at the end because she willingly betrayed the GF to do what was right.  Metroid II starts the character arc of Samus starting to follow her own beliefs over the GF's orders with saving the Baby. Other M has her try to win back Adam's trust, then take matters into her own hands when the situation calls for it. Fusion has Samus turn her back on the Federation entirely.   If Other M's dialogue was better written, the Metroid II/Super/OM/Fusion character arc would be fantastic, but as is, Other M muddies the waters with Samus' character development more than it clears them up."

Top screen clean and filled with the action, bottom screen with all your information and map.  And, regarding the 3DS part of the DS family, I always thought they could use the 3D functionality for some bosses, maybe. Although that would be an obligatory gimmick...? I don't know.  But I'll keep my faith that Federation Force isn't the only game on the franchise we're getting."

Metroid,3bebkh,hahaha1009,4,Mon Jun 29 23:31:57 2015 UTC,"Top screen clean and filled with the action, bottom screen with all your information and map.   The DS Kirby games did this so right. Super Star Ultra's bottom screen was your health bars, abilities and map, leaving the action on the top screen perfectly uncluttered.    Meanwhile, Squeak Squad's touch-screen inventory mechanic was intuitive, creative, and I'd love to see a Metroid game where you can use the lower screen to drag and drop Samus' gear to combine beams like you could combine abilities in Squeak Squad.  Actually, can we combine both of these and have the bottom screen switch between modes, like Pokemon X and Y's bottom screen did outside of battles? That'd be fantastic."
Metroid,3bebkh,Akran_Trancilon,5,Mon Jun 29 03:58:47 2015 UTC,"Lately I've been thinking that Federation Force is an experiment to see if a Metroid Prime control scheme works on the 3DS, and that we are going to get an actual game later on."
Metroid,3bebkh,hahaha1009,5,Sun Jun 28 17:49:42 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt that. Metroid Prime Hunters worked for the DS. Since the 3DS is just a better DS, then it stands to reason that it should work for both. The new 3DS's knob doesn't need to enter the market to already know that it works as a suitable quality of life improvement. Besides, the Circle Pad Pro basically tested that for them."

Metroid's signature infinite-corridor segments would be great with the extra screen space, as long as the screen isn't double-height for the entire game. Fusion in particular benefitted a lot from making the screen size feel limited, to emphasize that you had nowhere to run.

Theoretically and gameplay-wise, it's extremely similar to Metroid and very clearly takes a lot of inspiration from the franchise, but at any given point there's either too much or too little in your way to impede progress. Items are given to you and you keep going until you find another, new items you get don't seem to help you in any tangible way because the areas in front of you are designed around you having them and focus on now hiding things again. If they force you to go backwards, you take your time and see how you can apply your new powerup to what you've already moved past. I've heard it said that Metroid's backtracking aspect is a flaw, but now I realize it's a huge strength in the series, backtracking allows the player to revisit areas they might have dismissed with a fresh mind and new abilities.

Some people consider the Prime series to be non-canonical.

Metroid,3bhp5m,Bind0fGod,3,Mon Jun 29 09:18:30 2015 UTC,"The Prime games take place on the same timeline, but the stories are different. The Trilogy (plus Hunters) is its own contained story.   At the end of Metroid I, the remaining Space Pirates Samus apparently hadn't killed split up into two groups. The first went about rebuilding their operations on Zebes (becoming the enemies you fight in Super Metroid). The second group head off and establish a colony on Tallon IV, which is how the Trilogy begins - because eventually Samus answers the distress call from Frigate Orpheon while it orbits the planet).  However, after that connection, the Trilogy is more or less contained. Prime 3 doesn't lead into Metroid II or anything. It's just assumed that some time passes between the events of the Trilogy and the events of Return of Samus."
Metroid,3bhp5m,kmeisthax,2,Mon Jun 29 16:02:36 2015 UTC,"Canon or not, Prime is its own Trilogy with its own story. The other titles follow a different story. Both fantastic, but you can play the Prime Trilogy only and never miss anything. Alternatively you can skip the Prime games and not miss much story for the other half of the series. I suppose that is where part of the Prime canon comes into question."

On the bright side I'm gonna ask Game Theorists to do a video on it explaining the lore  along with the science once again behind cloning and it's effects.

Metroid,3bbupb,Bind0fGod,-12,Sat Jun 27 21:51:39 2015 UTC,"Well the Director for Other M said in interviews that Westerners may not be fully versed in the lore leading up to Other M. This refers to the Metroid Manga which was never localized. It really sets up the character of Samus in a way that makes Other M seem right. This is another reason why some consider the ""Prime"" series non-canon."
Metroid,3bbupb,Mortimer42,3,Sat Jun 27 22:02:12 2015 UTC,Isn't that the wierdass manga where Samus fights a bunch of butterflies with shotguns?

Samus, at the time of Other M, has whooped Ridley's ass so hard he needed emergency Space-Pirate surgery 5 times. I'd say she's more than faced her demons, especially seeing as the space dragon in Other M isn't even the real Ridley.   As for the Fedaration, Samus has never come close to blindly following orders, especially ones as riduculous as Adam's in Other M. Hell, on her first shown mission as a Federation soldier she ignores orders of non-interference because she knew it was a bad decision. We see this in Prime 3 as well.  Samus is allowed to have emotions. She's human. (Well, mostly.) But she never lets it get in the way of her mission, except for Other M. The concern in Other M is that her emotions are fundamentally different than the woman we've played as for almost 25 years."
Metroid,3bbupb,Leonhart01,-4,Sat Jun 27 22:47:01 2015 UTC,"I too read the manga and I am with you on this. Other M is the closest game to a lore wise correct interpretation of Samus. Knowing that, I actually like the game (occulting the weird Japanese narration).  Fusion is as well full of cheesy nonsense and stupid features. I don't get why people are complaining around here..."
Metroid,3bbupb,txcrnr,5,Sun Jun 28 07:17:46 2015 UTC,I don't see how manga Samus relates at all... She gets over her PTSD and never acts like a baby. She also gets shit done.

There is an auto aim function that makes all the fights too easy, and if it ever gets hard, there's a concentrate function for that. Dodging is pretty brain-dead, especially against bosses. The difficulty spikes in the game mostly come from suprises (see Metroid Queen). And there is pretty much no reason to use missiles.  Other M can pretty much be compared to Dynasty Warriors in terms of gameplay. Playable but not exciting. The latter lets me slaughter an army of laughable mooks while not pretending to have a story. In other words, it didn't try to trick me into thinking it's any good whereas OM tried so hard to."
Metroid,3bfdwg,twinfyre,3,Mon Jun 29 02:52:18 2015 UTC,I'd like to see either a video analyzing the level design in a Metroid game. Perhaps it could be comparing the way the levels are laid out in Metroid Prime to other shooters of its time. I don't think there's as much to learn from Other M as it's relatively linear.

Bringing the player to the Brinstar of Metroid 1 first, having a small Kraid then surprise the player with big Kraid, showing Old Tourian in the beginning, escaping through Old Tourian in the ending, the game ending relatively the same way except this time the Mother Brain has a body, all that plays into how cool the game design is for Super Metroid.  That's just one aspect though, there's also the sound design. I heard people compare the music to Tourian as the insides of stomach, which is really disgusting and fitting as since Mother Brain is there that's essentially the central hub of Zebes. Idk, I'm rambling now. There's a lot to talk about that game though."

All attempts at duplicating it have ended in disaster; four test subjects were horribly broken and twisted when they engaged our Morph Ball prototypes. Science Team wisely decided to move on afterward.   Not sure if that was Retro giving a sly nod to the physical impossibility of the morph ball or just a mental image they found funny, but reading that logbook entry always cracks me up."

Metroid Prime came off of Super Metroid, which was very heavy on showing you story rather than telling you. Those people who know some secrets in Super Metroid may remember the Crystal Flash ability which demonstrates that the suit can convert matter to energy and vice versa. Often times Metroid doesn't want to tell you something specifically, just give you a general idea and let you fill in the gaps with your own imagination."

Or is she actually just driving a car that looks like it's flying. What about that power suit? Is it really made of metal? Or is it cardboard? I mean, I know it looks like metal, and the ""energy shielding""(it's called energy shielding, but I'm pretty sure it's actually an invisible film of whipped cream that catches bullets.) works in tandem with the armor to protect Samus from damage, but we can't take everything at face value, right? I mean, Meta Ridley might look like a giant metal space dragon, but I bet he's actually an uptight businessman in a suit.   It's not like things look like what they actually are. Right guys?"

MatPat from Game Theory does a great job explaining how the morphball either is impossible, or is very possible and completely unnecessary because humans can crawl.  Secondly, I recall an interview with one of the guys from retro that mentioned how hard the morphball was to implement and how it was almost left out of the game completely. The MP Mb is a sloppy addition that the designers managed to get into the game and then had to explain because it doesn't actually make sense scientifically or pseudo-scientifically but justification was needed because they built a world that had the scanner giving reasons for everything."
Metroid,3bcpez,pemricht,8,Sun Jun 28 10:56:11 2015 UTC,"or is very possible and completely unnecessary because humans can crawl   Try crawling with that heavy suit which besides only has one arm available for use (the other one is the arm cannon). Then the morph-ball makes sense. Samus does crawl in her Zero Suit, as depicted in Zero Mission.  The morphball makes sense (at least from a functional point of view) if we think that a Power Suit user might need to move rapidly and effectively through narrow and/or low areas. The components of the suit (big round shoulders, arm cannon, big chest components...) make it literally impossible for you to crawl while on it."
Metroid,3bcpez,metroxed,5,Sun Jun 28 11:20:40 2015 UTC,"The morph ball exists because Nintendo R&D1 couldn't make a realistic crawling animation on the 8 bit NES for the first metroid.

Though he doesn't mention the large shoulders, I think they ultimately don't add as much as you might think they would just from looking at them. Besides, he ultimately makes the point that, even at the Morph Ball's smallest (Super Metroid), it wouldn't be hard for Samus to to get flexible enough to fit into it, as she has twice as much space to work with as the box that the world record holding contortionist can fit into."

Metroid,3bd6x2,breakmanblues,2,Wed Jul 1 19:33:07 2015 UTC,"Kim Basinger, if she were still young, would be essentially perfect for the role...but that's cheating, since Super Metroid Samus was based on Kim Basinger to begin with.  Currently, my top pick is Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She definitely has the look and the acting range. On top of that, a few of the points she'd need to play Samus (playing a calm, serious character, being able to hold her own in a videogame-inspired action film, and prolific usage of hair dye) are all things she already did in her best-known role, Ramona Flowers in ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World"".  Three other options:  Emily VanCamp While Winstead looks closer to Super Metroid's Samus, VanCamp looks more like the portrayal of the character in Zero Mission. Not only does she have some action roles under her belt, but she's tall enough (5'8'') to at least come close to Samus' height. Also she totally has Samus' eyebrows.  Abigail Breslin She probably looks most like modern Samus, from Prime 3, Brawl, and Other M.  However, at 5 foot 1, and 19 years old, it'd be tough to accurately portray Samus' commanding presence. Maybe in a Metroid 1 prequel?  Alexa Davalos looks more like Prime 1's Samus than the others- the main difference being Prime 1 Samus's slightly less angular chin. (pretend that the white background isn't a backdrop and you can imagine it's Phendrana Drifts too)."
Metroid,3bd6x2,breakmanblues,3,Mon Jun 29 09:38:09 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't necessarily be opposed to some of the more super-mainstream suggestions people are bringing up, like Chloë Grace Moretz, Scarlett Johannson, or Jennifer Lawrence. However, for some reason, I think the actress to play Samus needs to be a new one that few people have heard of, or at least a semi-famous one like Winstead.  The ending of the original Metroid, at the time, was a huge shock. Samus is supposed to be mysterious, her real personality unknown to nearly everyone in the galaxy outside of Anthony, Adam, the Baby, and the Chozo. (also most of these characters were in separate games from each other.) The only other person who knows anything substantial about Samus' personality is the player.  If any high-profile actress (ScarJo for example) was signed to play Samus, there wouldn't be any mystery left. It'd be all over the internet immediately. Sure, everyone already knows the main twist-Samus is a girl- but they can at least try to recapture a little piece of that intrigue. Granted, that may be hard to do when movie marketing is tied so much into the popularity of its stars, but it'd help the actual tone of the movie for there not to be pictures of the actress plastered all over every Metroid-related sector of the Internet."

Metroid,3bbuih,jackdatbyte,18,Sat Jun 27 18:58:05 2015 UTC,"It's not really a fact, just an opinion.  I'd say it's my favorite because it's the most isolating and the most ambient. You learn everything solely from exploration and scans. There aren't any major characters like Samus in the story.   I've always loved Tallon IV out of all the planets in Prime, as well. And the enemies. Even the story of how Tallon IV came to be, how it became corrupted, and how Samus liberated it from that corruption, has always enthralled me.  There's also nothing quite like the feeling when you first step out into the Overworld.   It's really ahead of its time, a masterpiece. I'd contend its the Super Mario 64 of the Gamecube. It pushed further what you can do with 3D gaming, how you can interpret and process a story and a world visually and through the eyes of Samus, and creating a volatile, interactive world that does so much with so little."
Metroid,3bbuih,britreyspears,0,Sat Jun 27 19:13:49 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but the game is just fundamentally better than the other two. Prime 2 and 3 both had to resort to gimmicks like the Dark World and Hypermode to keep them fresh, but Prime itself was so great because it didn't need any of that.  It occurred to me while replaying the trilogy actually, but the level design is also just so impeccable. No matter where you're at, you feel this sense of wonder and excitement about being there in Prime-- whereas Echoes and Corruption can get tedious at times.  Prime just happened to nail everything."

You don't have to look far to find people who could make a case similar to the one you made for Prime 1, for the other games."

Metroid,3bbuih,Zeth_Aran,10,Tue Jun 30 18:30:31 2015 UTC,Most people say that Prime 1 is the best in the series due to its similarities to super metroid. You're never told exactly where to go and you have to do a lot of back tracking and finding things out for yourself. Its really close to the classic that everyone loved without having some gimmick like motion controls or a theme that involves light and dark splitting up. Its just straight up metroid. That's my thought on it any ways. I'd like to hear if other people have any other reasons.

Metroid,3bbuih,bcuziambatman,9,Sat Jun 27 18:58:46 2015 UTC,The whole dark world was so isolating and full of risk. when playing that game you actually feel the danger of the enemies as well.
Metroid,3bbuih,twinfyre,3,Sat Jun 27 21:20:54 2015 UTC,Indeed. The sense of dread whenever I had to go into the dark world was palpable. The increased difficulty added a lot to the danger aspect of the game too.
Metroid,3bbuih,ZetaRayZac,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:44:01 2015 UTC,I disagree. I never felt at risk in prime 2. The huge bubbles of healing light that enemies stayed away from made me feel pretty close to invincible.

Metroid,3bbuih,powermad80,0,Mon Jun 29 21:52:21 2015 UTC,"I am shocked to find anyone that likes Echoes over the other two. I found the areas bland, the back tracking tedious (there's a lot of it and you can't get around all that quickly), the dark versions of enemies far too bullet spongy, and the beam ammo system completely unnecessary considering how strong the enemies are by the end of the game. Especially with how disappointing the Annihilator beam is. Hell, the beams being so worthless because of their limited ammo makes the back tracking even worse because it restricts your ability to simply blow through enemies with a stronger beam the way you can in pretty much every other Metroid game.  Not that Echoes is entirely bad, I played the shit out of it when it first came out. The atmosphere is spot on, the music is fantastic, and the Samus model is a HUGE improvement over her Prime 1 model, with the exception of her arm cannon. If you look at her Prime 1 model long enough, especially after you see Samus with her helmet off, you come to realize that a human body couldn't actually fit inside her armor. Her Prime 1 model is also actually a good bit larger than her Echoes model, which leads into the problem of her arm cannon in Echoes. While they reduced the overall size of her model in Echoes and made it look like a human could actually fit in her armor, they neglected to give her arm cannon the same size reduction. So while it looks fine on her Prime 1 model, it looks HUGE in Echoes and that's always kinda bugged me.  For Corruption I think they gave the Samus model a bit of a size increase from Echoes, not back up to her original Prime 1 status of course, but enough that her arm cannon doesn't stick out nearly as much. It's also possible that they adjusted the size of the arm cannon in Corruption to make it look less huge, but i've never played that one so much that I took the time to examine it that closely."
Metroid,3bbuih,Butter_Is_Life,4,Sun Jun 28 00:24:42 2015 UTC,"I found the areas bland, the back tracking tedious (there's a lot of it and you can't get around all that quickly)   I felt the same way about Prime 1. It was all very nicely done but the areas didn't feel the most inspired, while Echoes I felt was more believable as a planetary landscape. Prime 1 had its share of bullet sponges, and for as annoying as the ammo system in Echoes might have been there was almost always enough ammo to go around.  To me, Echoes felt like more of its own cohesive and well-structured whole while Prime 1 was just taking standard Metroid and doing it 3D."
Metroid,3bbuih,MisterPuck,3,Sun Jun 28 06:49:32 2015 UTC,"I feel the same. Prime 1 was undoubtedly a stellar game, but it has really standard area tropes. Lava, ruins, ice, mines. Prime 2 has a bog, a temple, a technobase, and a desert, each with a bit more variation and originality in architecture and enemy designs. One thing that really stood out to me is that it felt like a place that was still alive. Even though the Luminoth were barely holding onto life, I like the plot of Samus actually saving something tangible (the Luminoth race), rather than just destroying an enemy force again.   I also felt like the backtracking in Prime 1 was a little more scattershot. So many later game, essential powerups had you going to random little alcoves and rooms that just forced backtracking. Prime 2 had all the essentials to get in new areas, and the only backtracking you had to do was for expansions and Temple Keys."

Metroid,3bbuih,MisterPuck,2,Sun Jun 28 19:18:44 2015 UTC,"They ammo is extremely easy to refill, so it's your fault the enemies were bullet spounges late in the game. The backtracking isn't any more tedious than in 1. And how are Torvus Bog and Sanctuary Fortress bland? What makes the Annihilator disappointing? It rips through enemies."
Metroid,3bbuih,The_M4G,2,Sun Jun 28 16:32:45 2015 UTC,"The backtracking is more tedious in Echoes vs the original because there's more of it and it takes longer. I mean literally every area has some point or multiple points at which you have to go back to one of the prior areas to get an upgrade that's otherwise useless except for the one blockade you have to get past.   Torvus isn't quite as bland as Agon Wastes, but it's still bland and tedious to go through. Sanctuary Fortress is actually the coolest area in the game and one of the more interesting ideas.   That said, the Dark World is awful and painfully bland no matter what area your in.   As for the Annihilator Beam, the only enemies it ""rips through"" are the ones that your Power Beam already does. Either the Light Beam or the Dark Beam will do more damage than the Annihilator Beam in any given situation based on what enemy you're fighting. The one exception is when you can use it to super charge a light crystal or beacon, drawing all dark enemies into it and vaporizing them. Otherwise? It's useful for the Emperor Ing and that's it. Add the fact that it takes BOTH Beam ammo types to fire and you've got the worst weapon in the game. If you were to rip out the Beam Ammo system, Echoes would be vastly improved because of it. The only problem with that is that the Beam Ammo system was their way of balancing the game early on, so the first half or so of the game would get a good bit easier. They would have been much better off spreading the beams themselves out more instead of giving you both immediately."

Metroid,3bbuih,GavinTheAlmighty,5,Tue Jun 30 03:35:23 2015 UTC,"Playing through the trilogy (on the third right now), and I'm going to say that I like all of them about equally because each of them have their strengths and weaknesses.    The first one was good, but some of the areas felt straight up unfair to me (the enemies all pushing you into lava in the lava area, for example).  The scans in the first one were the most rewarding.  Every single scan uncovered a bit of story, and I was able to decipher how to beat a boss only from its scans in the first one).    Echoes got me frustrated and stuck more than the other two.  A lot of the boss scans tended to use the phrase ""find a way"" far too much, and I ended up googling almost every boss because the scans didn't give me much of anything.  The areas in 2 were incredible.  I enjoyed exploring in 2 more than any of the others.  The keys mechanic combined with the dark/light ammo mechanic to result in a very grindy feel, which counteracted the wanderlust I got from that game.  Corruption (although I'm still only beginning it) is easily the most immersive for me because the sound quality is much higher than in the other two.  I can get immersed in a game with relatively little regard to graphics quality, but sound quality is a huge component in my immersion. The biggest fallback I have is it feels very linear.  It doesn't feel like there was much more effort put in beyond the areas with quest points.  I want to explore, but there isn't much of anywhere to explore but the other end of this hallway (which the game has told me is where the story is).     TLDR:   Prime: Great scans, poor level design  Echoes: Great level design, poor combat  Corruption: most immersive, but too linear"
Metroid,3bbuih,SarcasticRidley,4,Sun Jun 28 02:01:03 2015 UTC,"Obviously it's entirely subjective, but here's my opinion:  Super Metroid is the pinnacle of game design.  It's as close to perfect as a game as ever been, in my opinion.  Prime replicated a lot of Super Metroid's successes, if not all of them: -Sense of isolation -Excellent ambiance and environmental design -""Show, don't tell"" -Worlds that are unique both in aesthetic and in ""feel"" -Music that is unique in both sound and ""feel"" -Excellent difficulty curve    It then added in some of its own ""tricks"" to differentiate it from Super: -A cohesive narrative (not to say that Super didn't have that, but Prime 1 is more explicit in its exposition, which helps to give it a different feel from Super, which is much more subtle - I prefer the subtlety, but exposition isn't bad when it's done the way Prime did it) -Scanning, which adds significant narrative depth to the game and helps with world-building (similar to the Mass Effect codex), but is also 100% optional, which means that if you don't care to read the text, you absolutely don't have to.    There are a ton of similarities between Super and Prime 1.  Super is the best game I've ever played, so taking significant cues from that game is a recipe for success.  Prime felt a lot like Super, just with more powerful hardware behind it to give it more weight and depth.  That's not to say that Echoes or Corruption are bad.  However, I can point to more aspects of those games that I consider flaws than I can with Prime 1, and I can point to several things that I liked about Prime 1 that aren't repeated in Echoes or Corruption.  If someone told me that they preferred Echoes or Corruption, I'd have no problem accepting that, as all three games are significantly tonally different, and all three have aspects that make them unique despite belonging to the same trilogy.  It all boils down to taste."

Metroid,3bbuih,SupaStaVince,2,Sat Jun 27 20:57:48 2015 UTC,"For me at least, it's a combination of true isolation, lack of gimmicks, the fact that the story wasn't spoon-fed to you (you figure it out on your own through lore scans), and nostalgia goggles.  That's not to say that Prime 2 and 3 aren't great games. It's just that Prime 1 was the best at having that good ol' Metroid feel to it."
Metroid,3bbuih,Boolossus_,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:41:33 2015 UTC,"Personally I found it to be the most immersive among the trilogy, though they are all the most immersive games I have ever played and my standard for immersion is pretty high.

Metroid,3bbuih,The_M4G,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:18:52 2015 UTC,"I believe its the best because the immersion wasn't captured as well in the other two. Playing Metroid Prime at night, in combination with the atmosphere and the music just makes you feel so good."

Nothing wrong with that per se, but when all of the secrets are in the middle of a long linear path and super obvious (""Oh hey, here's a block that you can't break yet!"") it gets needlessly tedious. I'm a bit averse to the brawler fighting system as well, but that's a lot more subjective.  Now I'm not so sure I'll like Ori anymore. Or is it mostly puzzling? Because I can get behind that."

Metroid,3ba0d9,Laughing_Luna,2,Sat Jun 27 16:26:09 2015 UTC,Oh! That explains it. I'm on a tablet right now so i can't mouse over text for the tool tips. I'll check'em out once i have access to a keyboard.
Metroid,3ba0d9,ElliotPenny,3,Sat Jun 27 17:14:22 2015 UTC,"For the difficulty of Prime 3, in comparison to its GC predecessors, Veteran is the equivalent to their Normals and Corruption's Normal is an unprecedented Easy mode in the Prime series.  However, if you're playing the Trilogy versions, then their difficulties are shifted to match Corruption's."
Metroid,3ba0d9,dizziestbeef,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:02:27 2015 UTC,"Huh, did not know that. Thanks for the heads up!"
Metroid,3ba0d9,Laughing_Luna,3,Sat Jun 27 19:56:46 2015 UTC,I also had a ton of trouble with this boss.  A lot of elements of the final form felt very arbitrary to me.  Did eventually beat it though.
Metroid,3ba0d9,SheeEttin,3,Sat Jun 27 05:25:29 2015 UTC,Annihiator beam for the tentacles works really well. It has slight tracking and takes two or three shots each.
Metroid,3ba0d9,Weltall548,3,Sat Jun 27 15:36:17 2015 UTC,"The reason the game didn't tell you that you can absorb Dark Samus 3's cluster shots, is because that's Dark Samus 4 and is its own scan.  If you were going for scan completion, or even just scans of all significant enemies, that one is a real dick move."
Metroid,3ba0d9,The_M4G,2,Sat Jun 27 18:59:48 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding!? Well, if nothing else that's good to know for my next run. I missed a bunch of scans anyway. The first scan-related dick move the game pulled was with the bomb guardian. You have just enough time to scan it before it's possessed, and that's the only alpha double-headed worm in the entire game as far as I could tell."
Metroid,3ba0d9,MisterPuck,2,Sat Jun 27 19:55:56 2015 UTC,Use a charged light beam shot for the tentacles.  Time your jumps to avoid the floor sweep.  Jump up to get in his face to shoot around the leg.
Metroid,3ba0d9,MisterPuck,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:39:36 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll give thpse a shot and see how I do.
Metroid,3ba0d9,AuraRyu,2,Sat Jun 27 14:56:49 2015 UTC,Seeker missiles destroy the tentacles
Metroid,3ba0d9,damanlyguy,2,Sat Jun 27 15:13:08 2015 UTC,"I really liked this boss BECAUSE it was hard. And then there's a worse boss after him. Catching those fucking phazon shots, ugh"
Metroid,3ba0d9,wreckingcanon,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:48:59 2015 UTC,No kidding man. Catching those Phason shots was so janky.
Metroid,3ba0d9,nikovan_smash,2,Sat Jun 27 22:03:08 2015 UTC,"If you're playing the trilogy version, you should know that the ""normal"" mode of Primes 1 & 2 is actually easy mode. ""Veteran"" is the original base difficulty level of the games. One exception is in Prime 2, I believe they made Boost Guardian easier across the board. The only way to play that boss at it's original difficulty is to have a GC copy of the game.  Prime 3 always had the two difficulty modes though. However, ""veteran"" is still more in line with the first two games original difficulty levels."
Metroid,3ba0d9,Laughing_Luna,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:06:22 2015 UTC,I had a hunch that they made Boost Guardian was easier. I was playing MP2 on Veteran and was surprised when I beat it in one go. Goddamn he was a tough customer back on the GC.
Metroid,3ba0d9,joecb91,2,Sun Jun 28 00:24:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he was a bastard. Then when you played him on Hard Mode he became a steel-reinforced concrete wall made of other, smaller, steel-reinforced concrete walls.   Him and Spider Guardian were my least favorite to fight. Spider Guardian just because there's so much crap to do before him and no save station before the fight."
Metroid,3ba0d9,reali-tglitch,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:34:12 2015 UTC,Really!? Whoops :D I thought Hypermode is harder than the GCN version tbh :D
Metroid,3ba0d9,Jakesta7,2,Mon Jun 29 21:33:36 2015 UTC,"I had a lot of trouble with this boss (getting into metroid with the trilogy, actually just beat this boss last week).  ended up using annihilator rapidfire on the tentacles because of the homing and super missiles on the core to avoid using light/dark ammo.    To avoid that laser, just hop into morph ball and do a boost right before he fires and he'll hit the ground with it.  but yeah, this boss is garbage.  Quadraxis was my favorite boss in the trilogy thus far."
Metroid,3b8o3f,tahk0,13,Fri Jun 26 21:32:46 2015 UTC,"I still can't fathom how the people running Nintendo make some of their decisions. They know that lots of people are dying for a new Metroid game like the core games we loved, not off shoots that tarnish the name. Then they continue to make this and other titles that just drag down the name of their franchises.  When this releases and gets mediocre sales the executives will likely think, no one wants a Metroid game, they didn't buy the new one.  I am all for new ideas and games, but there is no reason for this to have the Metroid name or universe slapped onto it beyond a grab at sales from the title."
Metroid,3b8o3f,Toysoldier34,4,Sat Jun 27 08:29:25 2015 UTC,"Idk, a lot of people felt similarly about wind waker and other titles, you know?  I think this was just announced with poor timing, but other than that, I think it might be a little too early to assume anything. Who knows- maybe this is the next title that everyone says ""oh, I liked this game way before everyone else, and you only truly like the series if you like this hidden gem etc etc"" haha :]"
Metroid,3b8o3f,Toysoldier34,15,Sat Jun 27 08:35:30 2015 UTC,"Wind Waker still plays the same as all of the other Zelda games, if it visually looked like Twilight Princess instead of the cartoon style it would be indistinguishable from the others. This new Metroid game doesn't have the same fundamentals to it. It doesn't play like other Metroid games and there is nothing making it a Metroid game beyond the title. The game already existed and was known without the Metroid title.  What made Metroid and the Prime series good isn't just the shooting which is decent at best compared to most titles out there these days, it is the exploration, level design, and advancement that make the Metroidvania genre of finding new abilities to advance and open new areas to places you have been. That side of it sets Metroid Prime apart from Sci-Fi shooters. They showed off the newest Metroid game highlighting all of the weakest aspects of the game and not the defining features we loved."
Metroid,3b8o3f,ther4ven,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:22:28 2015 UTC,We will just have to wait and see. I'm just stoked for blasting balls and hunting down stuff with my friends.
Metroid,3b8o3f,Toysoldier34,3,Sat Jun 27 19:01:40 2015 UTC,"The game can certainly be great and I hope that it is, it would be foolish to want a game to fail. My main point is that the game good or bad doesn't need to be called Metroid and they are calling it that to help boost sales which is unfortunate."
Metroid,3b8o3f,DemoORAS,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:18:06 2015 UTC,"Obviously blast ball has little to do with metroid, but the main game could have depth to it that is very reminiscent of of the main series even though it is a side story.  Heck, Tri Force Heroes was the most fun game I played at E3, but it couldn't exist if Nintendo didn't occasionally tamper with the OG formula of the Zelda games in the first place."
Metroid,3b8o3f,The_M4G,-1,Mon Jun 29 07:37:54 2015 UTC,TELL HIM AGAIN.
Metroid,3b8o3f,Toysoldier34,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:46:35 2015 UTC,"Nintendo knows what fans want and they don't give a shit. It's the only explanation and I've been saying it this whole time. Nintendo makes the games THEY want to make, not the ones WE want. It... doesn't uh, always work very well."
Metroid,3b8o3f,floflo81,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:05:14 2015 UTC,I still just can't understand how the people stay in charge. Any other company would let them go with stuff like naming it the Wii U or all the other questionable things they have done.
Metroid,3b8o3f,PhazonZim,5,Tue Jun 30 06:51:18 2015 UTC,"I like the person shouting ""Oh my God! What is this?!"" near the beginning of the video."
Metroid,3b8o3f,BlockyAnubis,3,Sat Jun 27 08:56:57 2015 UTC,"When I saw Blast Ball I thought they'd realised Hunters wasn't liked for its single player campaign (I know people will disagree) and so they decided to make it its own IP with similarities kept. Just like Secret of Evermore is a spiritual successor to Secret of Mana, but Seiken Densetsu 3 is the actual sequel."
Metroid,3b8o3f,Oduya,9,Sat Jun 27 12:54:44 2015 UTC,"If anyone ""jinxed"" it, it was IGN. They made that ridiculous click-bait article that sadly turned out to be true."
Metroid,3b8o3f,j-schwa,20,Fri Jun 26 22:45:49 2015 UTC,It wasn't that ridiculous. They HUD and lock on system looked exactly like Metroid Prime so they put two and two together.
Metroid,3b8o3f,BlockyAnubis,8,Sat Jun 27 00:11:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had the same thought.  During the Nintendo World Championships, I left the room before Blast Ball started but kept the stream on my laptop.  When I returned, it was in the middle of Blast Ball gameplay and I thought it was a Metroid game at first glance, because of the HUD and such.  It really wasn't a reach to think it could've been a new Metroid title."
Metroid,3b8o3f,DarkSamus987,2,Sat Jun 27 01:57:42 2015 UTC,"""Exactly"" is a massive exaggeration. It resembled the prime games, but it was nowhere near exactly the same."
Metroid,3b8o3f,spiralingtides,0,Sun Jun 28 02:02:15 2015 UTC,It did not look exactly like Metroid Prime.
Metroid,3b8o3f,Oduya,4,Sat Jun 27 08:30:42 2015 UTC,It was hyperbole. Oduya's point is solid.
Metroid,3b8o3f,Bind0fGod,2,Sat Jun 27 11:03:07 2015 UTC,Of course not exactly but close enough to make a connection.
Metroid,3b8o3f,SaiphCharon,6,Sat Jun 27 16:17:14 2015 UTC,Funny video. Still want this game though.

Metroid,3b9d3o,TheForbiddenMuffin,23,Sat Jun 27 01:18:56 2015 UTC,The reason for this style in Zero Mission is because it was meant to recreate the look of style from the Original Metroid.  Samus's sprite did look like that in the original . But it looked too silly so they decided to just make it more modern looking.
Metroid,3b9d3o,Gyper,7,Sat Jun 27 02:24:46 2015 UTC,That is ugly as hell
Metroid,3b9d3o,Weltall548,2,Sat Jun 27 23:13:53 2015 UTC,Reminds me of the pre-Fusion Metroid 4 footage.
Metroid,3b9d3o,Hollis_,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:02:43 2015 UTC,"I'd love it if a new Metroid game had an art style like Zero Mission's promotional art, or maybe with an art style like Marvel vs. Capcom 3 or XIII, as long as the game's still atmospheric."
Metroid,3b9d3o,FriendFrog,-1,Tue Jun 30 19:40:48 2015 UTC,I like how the main complaints about Federation Force are its art style and its name. Kinda funny how many likes this video has...
Metroid,3b9d3o,MatrixChicken,19,Sat Jun 27 01:23:58 2015 UTC,"The video has a lot of likes because it's possibly early footage of a game that was already out.  It's more that people find the early prototype interesting, not that they would have preferred this look.  That said, I think it is cool how it references the original NES sprite, and it would have been cool to have as an unlockable."
Metroid,3b9d3o,metroidman388,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:43:28 2015 UTC,"Having an unlockable sprite would have been cool! But hey, at least it came with the NES game! (:"
Metroid,3b9d3o,KingBroly,6,Sat Jun 27 01:46:36 2015 UTC,"Are those the main complaints? From what I've seen, the main complaints are not about that at all."
Metroid,3b9d3o,KingBroly,3,Sat Jun 27 02:07:10 2015 UTC,The art style is a big one. It just looks terrible. Another is the lack of having to do anything with Metroid.  Another is that it's a spinoff game after 5 years of nothing from Nintendo AND it'll probably be the only Metroid game released during the series' 30th Anniversary next year.
Metroid,3b9d3o,KingBroly,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:04:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get all of that. That's kind of my point. I think the fact that we aren't getting another sidescroller, or Fusion sequel, or at least a true Prime game, but instead a spin-off, is much worse than the art style or name.  At the very least, an accompanied nod toward the actual Metroid game being worked on starring Samus would've lightened the blow."
Metroid,3b9d3o,MatrixChicken,-1,Sat Jun 27 05:10:41 2015 UTC,I doubt it. Fed Force still looks like an N64 game and the chibi art style only highlights how terrible it looks.
Metroid,3b97u0,ITS_ALL_YOUR_FAULT,6,Sat Jun 27 00:26:03 2015 UTC,That's very weird and the first time I've heard of this happening. What are you playing on?
Metroid,3b97u0,SpaceWarriorSamus-,3,Sat Jun 27 00:47:35 2015 UTC,I'm playing on the gamecube. I wonder if the problem is my controller. I haven't tried switching it out.

Metroid,3b97u0,Sludgehammer,13,Sat Jun 27 01:45:44 2015 UTC,Either that or the C stick was cocked over when the GC turned on and now it's calibrated wrong.

Metroid,3b97u0,Jammintk,3,Sat Jun 27 03:23:56 2015 UTC,"To be fair this bug only ever happens on Nintendo hardware. N64, GCN, Wii, and Wii U all have this problem."
Metroid,3b97u0,powermad80,2,Sat Jun 27 08:53:45 2015 UTC,"Not really a bug, it's called the Neutral Position, read it in one of the manuals once.  Calibrates every input's dead zone as wherever all the buttons/sticks are when the controller is plugged in and receives power. Not sure why they do that though. Maybe as a failsafe in case something causes the joysticks to center slightly off?"

Metroid,3b6akv,pwnjones,3,Fri Jun 26 11:07:51 2015 UTC,Some of the item placement had me scratching my head for ages but I had a huge sense of satisfaction when I did find them.

Metroid,3b7ywe,nihilinth,4,Fri Jun 26 18:33:20 2015 UTC,Doubt it. I think Galactic Federation (though bad timing to most people) is just to get us ready for what they're bringing in for Metroid news in the future.  I found it strange they talked about every game at the E3 Direct except for Galactic Federation. They just showed the trailer and moved on to talk about other games. I highly doubt that's all they'll give us and I think we'll see more in the future including Zero Mission coming to Virtual Console and a mainline Metroid on the way.
Metroid,3b7ywe,Bind0fGod,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:40:11 2015 UTC,I hope they bundle it with an official translation of the Metroid Manga companion piece they made.

I try to strike a balance between informative and casual/silly commentary (though it's been getting a lot sillier, lately). I'm about halfway through the game right now. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated."
Metroid,3b7muy,DrBloodlust,2,Fri Jun 26 17:00:23 2015 UTC,"Four episodes in and things look pretty good. Your voice isn't annoying and you seem to know what you are doing. I like that you scan and read/comment on the lore most of the time because that is a significant part of the games story and a brilliant way to transmit it to the player. My only criticism is that you waste a bit too much time. Because you are 100%ing this it is only natural, but you don't have to pause in a room to explain a point or stop and kill mobs if you can just speed past them.   Looking forward to the rest. ;)"
Metroid,3b7tc1,Wind123,10,Fri Jun 26 17:44:30 2015 UTC,"I think the underlying issue with Samus's sexualization and the zero suit is how it also contradicts with her other overall story elements. I'll just list what I think contributes to the problem.   Body. This is really my personal beef with the series, so I might get jumbled here.  But from what I can tell, Samus is consistent in the fact that she's a genetically altered super soldier crafted to be at the peak physical human condition and be a living weapon. What's the issue here? Well, think of it this way. What generally comes in your head when you think of peak physical human condition in fiction? Generally you get bodies from characters like Superman, Captain America, Goku, you know, those kind of guys. Really strong, buff kind of characters. Heck, even Smash Bros. does this with guys like Captain Falcon, Ike, Little Mac, etc. It's easy visual indicators. Since it's fiction, they need to get an idea across quickly through the body. Muscles = Strength. But for most women in games... good luck with that. At the current time Samus has the body of a fictional supermodel. There's no treading across that one. She looks more like a barbie doll than she does a person in recent games (Other M and SSB4). So because of how she's designed, Samus does not have the air of being, well, ""strong"". Not to say she should hulk out or something. I think you put it best when you considered Super Metroid's Samus the best. You can visibly see her muscles, and she's attractive to boot. I think Awkward Zombie's latest ZSS appearances show this off well. But when the body is 100% dedicated to sexyness is when it might become stereotypical, unoriginal, or sexist. Actions. The reason why some people consider the Zero Suit sexist is that, when you get down to it, Samus barely does anything in it. It's usually at the end of each game where you see the thing (or a variation of it), after the game ends. And when she does have the thing on in a hostile environment, she usually only stuns opponents and runs away. Now there are some contradictions to this. ...Well, more like, one. Smash Bros. That's the only game she really fights in the thing, and of course... rocket heels... But in the main series, it's either there for show at the end, or for a stealth mission or something. It's a dissonance between the Normal suit and the Zero suit. Samus isn't really allowed to do anything badass as ZSS. This is probably seen best in Other M. In the suit she's a monster killing machine, jumping around, tearing giant bugs's wings off, dead on shots to the face, all around brutal bounty hunter. But when it comes off she's got a paralyzer. Uh... That's about it. It creates the image that Samus is, well, weak without her suit. Which makes it more like the suit is the badass, not her. Which means that ZSS, or normal Samus, cannot be the strong bounty hunter she usually is. (Again, peak physical human condition contradiction.) What's really funny is, the simplest solution to this problem was here since day ONE. When you typed in Justin Bailey in the original Metroid, you'd start off... without your suit! Samus would be in a leotard and nasely green hair, but have an arm cannon still on your body. You played the game basically the same. Samus could be a badass without her suit on. Also the posing in Other M and SSB4 is ridiculous and only show off her body, so there's that. Design: Now this is a bit more opinionated so I've got it in more a checklist: Heels: One of the more recent additions. They're bad. There's no reason for them to, like, exist. Practicality fails on all fronts when high heels are used. Even the Smash ones, while they have kind of an excuse, have no reason to be high heels. It's just an excuse for Samus to be in heels. Now BOOTS, that would be acceptable. Color: This is a bit nitpicky, but... light blue? Really? In the context that Samus would HAVE to use it for stealth purposes as a last resort, why a bright, light blue? That's pretty easy to see. Those Smash high heels easily make it worse with their flashing lights. Also in Other M they made it less clothy and more latex-y just to show off her curves, wonderful. Armor: Yes, you can make the argument that it shouldn't be armored because it's a ""Space Suit."" But guess what, Samus isn't an astronaut, she's a trained military killer. The regular suit has an upgrade to adapt to outer space conditions (The Gravity Suit, at least in one of the games), so I'd consider normal suit to be more an advanced military armor. And in the military (unless the Chozo are idiots) you generally wear as much back-up armor as possible. And there are a lot of lightweight armor they wear, too. Just, she's on hostile worlds, get a little extra protection, jeez.   So the way to combat possible sexism is release another Metroid game... where Samus is kinda buff I guess... where you can go Justin Bailey with a ZSS and an arm cannon, and give her rocket boots I guess?"
Metroid,3b7tc1,Dr-Sanity,4,Sat Jun 27 01:51:22 2015 UTC,"Starting with 1.  You make good points about what is pictured when one thinks of supers.  I do concede that Samus often looks a tad on the supermodel side and there could be more done to make her inspire the same sense of super like when you see Superman or Batman.  I'll conclude how her appearance works later.  At 2, the peak human condition isn't exactly a match against a strongly eugenic race(s?) such as the space pirates.  When the space Pirates get a foot hold, they start extreme genetic modifications to make an entire subspecies to live and work there.    When their natural armour and weapons are able to hold their own against your cutting edge powered armour, what makes you think going against their elite when you don't have said powered armour a good idea?  Historically, we stopped wearing armour when muskets and guns began to exist(much more recent ballistics armour and Kevlar not withstanding).  Sure I can get skewered easily by all the swords and sabers that everyone is still wielding, but what's the point if my opponent can just shoot through it like tissue?    As for the paralyser, ammo needs storage space, storage space that Samus has no access to without her suit's micro-factories.  As for the alternative, let's assume that power cores for lethal energy/plasma/etc can be recharged, you're still reloading them instead of charging since it takes time and probably specialized equipment that's not exactly conducive to being carried onto a battle field.    So again, without access to reliable ammo without her suit's micro-factories, a paralyzer that charges off of just being moved and/or the ambient temperature and can stun your elite opponent with uber-armour on to go along with their natural armour for a not insignificant amount of time sounds like a practical and affordable idea.  This is where peak human condition comes in: it lets you take advantage of that brief period of time that your assailant is frozen.  As for 3, the heels are just bad.  The SSB4 excuse barely holds up to the heat of an LED - if they wanted rocket shoes/boots, it would have to be platforms and/or ankle and calf mounted.  We are in agreement on the heels.    As for colour, the Zero Suit isn't intended for stealth.  Sure it's not counter-productive outside of colour for that purpose, but it's not meant for it.  What it's used for is to prevent chaffing and pinching from the power suit itself whilst also giving convenient protection from the elements.  On top of that, if Samus crash lands and doesn't have access to her suit, the colouration makes her easier to find by search and rescue.  Red, orange, and yellow may be better for that, but do remember that Humans aren't the only members, and probably aren't the super majority of the Galactic Federation, and other creatures might see blues better than reds.  It could also be more along the lines that blues aren't as common a colour seen en masse on most charted worlds, making the blue able to better stand out.    And to go further on about colours, an astronaut's suit is white to deflect heat away to prevent being cooked, it could be that the suit is blue instead of black or grey to keep cool in hot environments, but still manage to be warm in cooler environments.  And then there's Occam's Razor: the Zero Suit is blue because she wants it that way and has proven herself able to take on great adversity to not care that she sticks out - I mean, her gunship and armour should be indicators of this.  Even if their unique profiles didn't give her identity away, then her colours of Yellows, Oranges, Reds, and occasionally purple with rare instances of other colours should.  The reason that the GF verifies Samus' identity in Corruption is [1] Procedure [2] Better safe than sorry(it's not too far fetched that someone could just make functional replicas of her ship and armour if they really wanted).    Onto the armour itself, you're limiting how you can think of it just by calling it a Space Suit with military upgrades or as just military armour.  What it is, is Powered Armour, colloquially called a Power Suit.  It is an powered exoskeleton built to enhance speed, strength, protection, offense, and tactical assessment in environments as tame as your backyard to extremes as great as submersion in molten and/or radioactive materials and space.  The Gravity Suit upgrade isn't a space-suit, not in the least; the armour can handle space just fine.  What the Gravity Suit does is enhance mobility and stability in environments of high viscosity as well as high and low gravity - the shielding upgrade it also provides is a bonus.  As for what powered armour is classified as, they're classified as powered armour.  To make its scale understandable to those who don't know the leap from heavy to powered, your heavy armour weighs around 60 to 100 pounds.  Heavy Powered Armour can easily weigh 4 or 5 times that.  The jump to mechs/walkers starts you in at half a tonne for light models.  Samus' armour probably weighs closer to 250 to 300 pounds, placing hers in the medium range; the space pirates and GF soldiers as seen outside of Other M are probably wearing light powered armour, lacking the resources and maintenance to field anything heavier en masse.  What also separates powered armour from other armours is that they're built to move that weight for the wearer in addition to anything they may need to move.  The systems in light powered armour can move heavy powered armour, but would strain doing so - forget actually lifting anything.  Light and Dark suits aside, the powered armours are tools of combat before being environmental suits.  This is why they're not optimized for prolonged exposure to super harsh environments, like magma and high amounts of radiation.  The Light and Dark Suits on the other hand don't offer any protections except from the atmosphere of Dark Aether, as seen by their lack of damage reduction.  The P.E.D. is an upgrade to make the suit a better weapon, just like how the Power/Varia/Gravity/etc do.  And now for the greater point.  Yes portrayals of Samus of ranged from Super's brilliant depiction of a mercenary and bounty hunter at peak condition to the god-awful Other M portrayal(Seriously, how the fuck do you go from wearing heels and easily a head shorter than everyone to flat footed and a tad taller than the tallest living guy on the station?).  The way Samus should be portrayed is confident and capable, regardless her apparent physique.    A lot of Zero Mission's and Fusion's end screens show Samus in her Zero Suit, or the stripped down version of it.  But she looks comfortable and radiates confidence doing so.  What's bothersome is when it's shown off with a flourish and pose for the sake of fan-service.  The muscles aren't needed, but they do help with getting the point across of just what kind of person Samus is - just not as well as showing us how she handles herself while not on a job."
Metroid,3b7tc1,Laughing_Luna,5,Sat Jun 27 10:58:39 2015 UTC,"I honestly thought Zero Mission's endings (especially this one) were a really valuable addition to the game. Samus doesn't have to make action poses and wear her armor 24/7, because she finished her mission and gets to relax. If Samus wants to hang out at a bar and wear shorts after blowing up a bunch of Space Pirates, Samus gets to hang out at a bar and wear shorts.   I don't blame her, and neither does this guy"
Metroid,3b7tc1,breakmanblues,3,Sat Jun 27 09:56:58 2015 UTC,"That is absolutely fine. There's nothing demeaning about wearing shorts. It's the Zero Suit, body shape, and objectification that have recently defined her that are getting hate. Personally I wish they'd just go back to this look"
Metroid,3b7tc1,saintjimmy64,3,Sun Jun 28 01:03:44 2015 UTC,What's even more impressive is that they stuck pretty close to Super Metroid artwork for that model. Samus didn't always look like a stock anime character.
Metroid,3b7tc1,mr_johnson22,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:44:21 2015 UTC,Wow. Thats a really good point. Siiigh...
Metroid,3b7tc1,saintjimmy64,2,Sun Jun 28 18:23:52 2015 UTC,"I really liked that look in Prime.   Random thought: at some point, the hair should go back to the strawberry blonde it was in the classic games (It was really brightly colored in Super and Metroid 1; Samus can look tough without having a depressing color palette)."
Metroid,3b7tc1,breakmanblues,6,Mon Jun 29 02:18:21 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I have no problem with her sexualisation. I dont need it, Metroid is great without it, but a little eye candy doesnt hurt (atleast for me). But I can understand why a lot of people dont like it."
Metroid,3b7tc1,KarjarA,6,Sat Jun 27 15:22:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's anything wrong with a fictional character being sexualized. The nature of the action genre lends itself to sexualized characters, men and women alike. In my opinion, the issue with Samus and her sexualization is less that she's made attractive, but that her feminine body is used as a reward.  The end credits scenarios I don't believe are exploitative. They come from a tradition of showing you Samus the Person rather than Samus the Metal Suit. In the original game, it was a surprise, and in subsequent games it certainly did take on the air of fetishization (like in Zero Mission or Metroid II). But it's a minor issue open to interpretation.  It's funny that you mention Other M, because the outfit was the least of Samus's concerns as far as her sexualization in that game went. In every Metroid before it, Samus was strong and sexy, a bad ass who looked fantastic doing it--think of any superhero that doesn't wear form-fitting outfits that accentuate their body. In Other M, her femininity and sexuality held her back; it was a detriment, a weakness.  I don't think Samus has to be an asexual robot. In fact, I vastly prefer a powerful, beautiful sexualized Samus who rarely reveals her body to a silent manakin, or a crybaby desperate for a father and a child."
Metroid,3b7tc1,Doopliss77,0,Fri Jun 26 18:34:53 2015 UTC,"Hrm, very interesting thoughts.  I definitely agree with what you said about Samus being conventionally attractive. That's perfectly fine, just as much as if she wasn't. Looks aren't an issue.  To be really honest, I haven't played Other M. I've seen enough of it to know what the problems are, but are there any particular scenes (other than the Ridley and Sector Zero trainwrecks) that are problematic, in your opinion?"
Metroid,3b7tc1,Doopliss77,2,Fri Jun 26 18:47:41 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I've played it (I got it the morning it came out), but I distinctly remember a scene in which Samus was being reduced to tears because she was frozen in her Zero Suit and Adam was valiantly striding forward to sacrifice himself or whatever. It was the vulnerability of her character that irked me. Previous iteration of her in the Zero Suit showed her as underpowered but stealthy, sneaky, crafty. This just showed her as weak and naked, and very much a woman first, bounty hunter second."
Metroid,3b7tc1,sniktawekim,3,Fri Jun 26 19:21:07 2015 UTC,"and most of the time the game designers are men anyway   Men have the right to creative expression and art just as women do. When we start tearing down all the offensive art, maybe it would be fair to consider ""objectification"", but this is just all too conservative for me."
Metroid,3b7tc1,The_M4G,2,Sat Jun 27 00:49:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly I would prefer Samus be retired for a while if it means Nintendo eventually brings her back and does her right (A lack of Samus isn't my gripe with FF FYI). Her current status as hysterical, large-chested teenager is pretty terrible.  On the other hand though, it goes both ways. Don't unfairly judge anyone by their appearance- just because Samus lately looks more like a pornstar than a seasoned mercenary doesn't mean she is one. She's perfectly allowed to be stunningly voluptuous, the problem is it seems that's all she has going for her now."
Metroid,3b7tc1,mccabre1,4,Sat Jun 27 02:43:41 2015 UTC,"Do you know what astronauts wear under their space suits? Underwear/shorts. I can tell you right off the bat that the power suit is a lot tighter than a modern space suit, and moves around a lot more. The zero suit does actually make sense for this, as does her standard attire after 1, 2, and super. Zero mission and fusion give her a sports bra, gym shorts and combat boots. The heels were dumb in Other M, nobody is defending them. And I still don't understand the rocket heels, but she's not the first game character to have them. If you want to complain about sexualized game characters, go over to the fire emblem or final fantasy subreddit, we're busy discussing chibi halo.   *Edit - This came out more abrasive than intended."
Metroid,3b7tc1,Doopliss77,6,Fri Jun 26 18:08:51 2015 UTC,"True, but when astronauts do a good job, they don't strip down on the moon and show off their assets."

Metroid,3b7tc1,mccabre1,4,Fri Jun 26 18:54:21 2015 UTC,"No, they go back to the ship and take off their suit."
Metroid,3b7tc1,mccabre1,3,Fri Jun 26 18:44:20 2015 UTC,"Ah, I didn't know about the astronaut suits. Interesting.  Blimey, don't get me started on FE though. I really dislike the artstyle of the 3DS games, and the sexualisation there puts me right off. Fun games though, so I guess it's swings and roundabouts :/"

Let's say I finish murdering a whole planet of monsters in order to accomplish some kind of insane objective.  And what people want is to see me in a banana hammock so they can gaze at my muscles.  Um... what?  That's what you want?  (I'm a guy.  The first name is a bit androgynous, I know)  So, if I'm taking on the role of Samus, how is it rewarding to gawk at her?  Obviously she shouldn't be asexual.  I hope no one is saying this.  The Zero suit isn't necessarily bad.

Metroid,3b6ebl,Weltall548,4,Fri Jun 26 10:43:24 2015 UTC,"So the original Metroid Prime on the Gamecube released in America first (NTSC release), and then later Europe & Australia (PAL release). They fixed a   bunch of bugs and tweaked some things for the PAL release.  The most notable PAL change is the narration in the opening and closing cinematics of the game, which is what you were hearing in that first video. Here is the opening narration. It plays at any completion percentage for PAL versions. As for some other PAL differences:     The power suit talks.  The cinematic for when you get the Phazon suit is also different between the versions (Original | New)  There are many tuning changes; enemies like the Sentry Drones and Metroid Prime's final form are harder (more health and damage, Metroid Prime also moves faster). Phazon does less damage in general when standing in it. There are many bug fixes. Scan dashing (the primary speed running technique) is gone. Rooms load more slowly on the PAL version to avoid crashing. The ""Special Thanks"" section of the credits was removed. Many more cinematics are skippable The original version did not show your total missiles count, eg. you would see ""235"" instead of ""235/250"". You now see the total in the PAL version. Similarly, item and logbook completion percentages were not originally shown in the start menu and were added in the PAL version Ridley is now immune to boost ball: you could get him to 25% health in one hit using it originally All of [Flaahgra's Theme]() plays. Originally it was bugged so the first ~30 seconds of the song would loop endlessly while fighting him. There is a pile of Benzedium rocks in front of the lava beam room and  the grapple beam room. This is to prevent getting these items before getting the power bomb, which is otherwise very easily possible. Etc: Many more minor differences like different flame directions for one room in Magmoor Caverns, no Hunter Metroid in phendrana drifts   Most of these changes carried over to the trilogy version. For whatever reason, the intro/outro narration did not; once again only the PAL version had the voiceover. That's why you didn't hear it in your playthrough.  What neither version got was the beta narration by Samus herself, which is a damn shame because it is by far the best intro.   As for that Dark Samus ending: you need to have collected 100% of the items in the game. Seeing Samus take off her helmet is also a completion reward: you don't see that part unless you have collected at least 75% of the game's items."

But yeah, still awesome."
Metroid,3b6ebl,Jakesta7,3,Sun Jun 28 13:28:14 2015 UTC,Prime 2 is a great game. Lots of folks here talk about the difficulty being ridiculous but on the Wii it's not that bad. It drags a bit... Meaning it's a long game. Have fun which ever game you pick up next!!!

Metroid,3b5f23,r1ck14,3,Fri Jun 26 02:56:56 2015 UTC,"There will be no system like in Fusion where Adam is constantly giving you direction on where to go, rather, you'll need to work it out yourself.   While I can understand why you might not like the system from Fusion, it might be a bit difficult for people to know where to go if the maps are large. Take Zero Mission for example: Whenever you find a Chozo statue, you are shown on the map a spot you have  to go. It doesn't show you how, or what is there, but you know where to go.   Also, if this is like Prime, you might want to focus on level design. I was listening to a podcast the other day and the guys on it were talking about how people were afraid that Prime wouldn't be able to pull off a platforming game in a 3d environment.   http://video.wikia.com/wiki/File:Nintendo%E2%80%99s_Struggle_to_Evolve_Metroid_-_NVC_Podcast (at 10:38)  Also, in terms of sound, I know that the original prime sound files are available online:   http://www.sounds-resource.com/gamecube/metroidprime/sound/3672/  I know you aren't trying to be prime, but instead be prime-inspired, but I figure if you want to get in contact with any sound designers you could use that as a reference. IDK.   As for my general thoughts, it sounds pretty cool, but definitely very ambitious."
Metroid,3b5f23,LexLugerChantSample,2,Fri Jun 26 04:27:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the references! I'll honestly have to see how it works out. It's not going to be anywhere near as long as Prime. I'm looking at a 5-hour campaign for the first play through. So I'll have to see how difficult my level designs work out to be before I make a final decision as to how to give the player hints if necessary. I know that I definitely won't have the Fusion ""spoon-fed"" system, but you're right; giving some map-based indication may work out fine. Or at least some scannable points that give you hints (kind of like the library book from Myst). I do feel that with correct and well planned out levels, where the player can see points of future advance not yet accessible, it won't be so hard. I can always have the option to disable hints for players who prefer a challenge."
Metroid,3b5f23,NightSwipe,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:43:44 2015 UTC,"I like the design so far... removing some armor in the leg area would be good as you said. One question I had after reading your overall info was the fact that an asteroid would have local wildlife... maybe the kind of asteroid I'm thinking of is a bit small, but I don't see an asteroid providing enough atmosphere to sustain life that would warrant being shot at and killed.  One idea I had to bolster the beginning of the story was to have whatever asteroid or planet, whatever you make it (maybe a recently founded colony planet that houses miners who suddenly disappeared? This way there would be a reason for not knowing what lives on the planet) have an on-planet security system with cameras, turrets, etc. The security system would give the player cryptic warnings about ""Unidentified threats"" when scanned, concerning the alien race, and the player would know this after perhaps reading some scans from the miners that said the security systems don't recognize the life on planet (asteroid, etc.) as hostile. Something where there is both a familiar kind of threat to the player (modern security) and an unknown threat (alien life). Just my 2 cents, the concept sounds great, sorry for the long post, all the best!"
Metroid,3b5f23,NightSwipe,2,Fri Jun 26 04:00:49 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of a security system. As far as planet or asteroid goes, I don't exactly have my heart set on one or the other. I picked asteroid as I had recently seen news of future plans to mine asteroids. Prime did have a couple of turrets that shot at the player (though some of them were installed by the space pirates) so it will work for sure.  Also, the design isn't mine though I wish. I can't draw at all, and that was an image I found on google just to give an idea of what I'm envisioning."
Metroid,3b5f23,Fershick,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:31:02 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from, understood. Maybe have much of the resistance against the player coming from unmanned drones or the on-planet security system during the beginning of the game, with a few outbreaks of alien life every now and then - a boss battle that takes place (perhaps because one particularly large alien was burrowing and chewed through door controls or something). Then toward the end of the game, once the player knows there is some form of hostile alien life from space on the asteroid, have them come in as the main (stronger) enemy. Again, just a thought. Sounds like you've got a lot of it all figured out, so more power to you!"

That's why they fight hand to hand, they're less likely to bleed from blunt force than from bullets.

Metroid,3b60ds,ImproperDancing_,11,Fri Jun 26 08:53:02 2015 UTC,This. Sanctuary Fortress is easily one of the coolest areas in the entire trilogy.
Metroid,3b60ds,Pyropter,3,Fri Jun 26 09:11:42 2015 UTC,"Imo, Prime 2 did an amazing job of creating environments that felt truly unique and alien!"
Metroid,3b60ds,BlockyAnubis,3,Fri Jun 26 15:55:02 2015 UTC,"IMO the most interesting part of the lore and what will give you the most understanding of the Ing is the Luminoth lore.  It functions a lot like the Chozo lore from the last game, but it's a lot more concrete when describing the events that unfolded.  It sets the stage for how the Luminoth reached the brink of destruction before your arrival.  As for light and dark beams, you should use them as much as possible.  Killing an enemy with one beam will drop ammo for the opposite beam.  This is especially true for crates and ing storage pods.  I haven't read up on actual damage values, but the power beam does seem noticeably weaker in this game compared to the last (at least with rapid fire uncharged shots).  Backtracking in the light world doesn't yield as many missile expansions and whatnot as it did for Chozo Ruins.  Instead you want to comb new areas of the map - especially the dark world - to find missile expansions.  For everything else it's a case of scanning and remembering item-related blockades to return to later."
Metroid,3b60ds,metroidman388,3,Fri Jun 26 09:48:15 2015 UTC,"Echoes is the most divisive one in the trilogy. Some people love it, largely for the atmosphere, the challenge, and the bosses. Others are soured on the near-duplicate maps which exacerbates the feel of backtracking, the muted palette, the ammunition, and various other things.  It sounds like you're in the second camp, and that's fine. I wouldn't try to force yourself to like it more. Enjoy what you can, and be okay with being frustrated by the other stuff."
Metroid,3b60ds,kindarilwraja,3,Fri Jun 26 12:50:13 2015 UTC,"Ammo is easy to refill, since killing an enemy or shooting a crate gives the opposite beam's ammo. You don't need to backtrack much until the last part of the game. You're close to Sanctuary Fortress, the best area ever, and some awesome Boss fights. There's more purpose for staying on the planet in Prime 2 than in Prime 1. Samus is stuck on the planet, and she needs to remove the energy from Dark Aether to destroy it, saving the Luminoth and Herself. And speaking of being rewarding, 2 has more and better upgrades than 1."
Metroid,3b60ds,Weltall548,3,Fri Jun 26 15:57:19 2015 UTC,"If you can't enjoy Prime 2 then you're too far gone I'm afraid, it's the best game in the trilogy"
Metroid,3b60ds,DarkSamus987,2,Sat Jun 27 08:38:53 2015 UTC,"The first time I tried to get into Echoes, I felt exactly like you do. It wasn't until I picked up my save file a while later and accepted that I was just playing it so I could play MP3 that I started enjoying it. Once I let go of the expectations set by MP1, MP2 wasn't so bad. Also the Spider Ball is cool.  I guess that doesn't help you much, but you're not alone in how you feel."
Metroid,3b60ds,Rimas_LXBYA,2,Fri Jun 26 08:47:15 2015 UTC,It has a beautiful empty sorrow to it. It has a few questionable design choices... But it has an atmosphere that other games wish they could match.
Metroid,3b60ds,Bind0fGod,2,Sat Jun 27 01:22:39 2015 UTC,An important gameplay tip: the flow of dark world sections is based around taking the damage and getting health pick-ups from crates and dead enemies.  Inching between light crystals will make these sections torturous when they really don't need to be.
Metroid,3b60ds,Hollis_,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:04:30 2015 UTC,"My favorite moment by far was the Spider Ball Boss Fight.  I love unique boss fights in games, especially games I love.  This was a challenge and I enjoyed it immensely.  As far as ammo use I used Darkburst all day long because of how cool it is, never gave a lot of thought to ammo.  I kept enough for when I needed stuff but you can always farm more.  It just depends on your playstyle.    The lore was definitely not as big as Prime 1, or so it seemed to me, but this game was definitely a lot more ambient.  Dark world light world games generally focus a lot more visually on change and disruption I find."

Metroid,3b44ia,Elusive2000,4,Thu Jun 25 21:39:57 2015 UTC,"But we are talking about ""space"" military.  Starcraft has space marines and lack army soldiers so I'm not sure if space marines are the equivalent to regular marines."
Metroid,3b44ia,LuxShadow1,3,Thu Jun 25 22:35:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly, in agreeing with /u/luxshadow1, I'm wondering if the the name ""soldier"" was a slip up on the writers' part (one of many), since the sissies ahem, ""soldiers"" with Adam were supposed to be an elite squad.  Not to say that they acted like one.  From a purely non-character standpoint, I'd have to go with marines. They have much cooler looking armor (they don't look like techno-mannequins (okay, they actually do look kinda neat...)), which also appears to have a strength enhancing factor(I mean, really, they're basically mass-produced powersuits), judging from the amount of mechanical apparatus, and all that armor has gotta weigh a ton.  Also, they probably have tougher armor, but who cares about that kinda thing?  They also seem to have a waaaay better armament 359.266% of the time. Except of course for those amazing single shot freeze guns that somehow can one shot SAMUS. I mean, where were those things when the space pirates invaded the vahalla?"
Metroid,3b4lat,MrForchevski,3,Thu Jun 25 22:37:53 2015 UTC,"That's enough to be able to beat the final boss, though you may have a tough time of it, primarily because of how low your missile capacity is.

Metroid,3b4lat,Wei_Tzu,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:10:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! I'll definitely look for a few more missile expansions before I progress any further.
Metroid,3b4lat,metroidman388,3,Fri Jun 26 00:04:10 2015 UTC,"Not to give too much away, but IIRC Chozo Ruins is PACKED with missile expansions if you comb it thoroughly.  Phendrana might also be worth another pass with your current upgrades.  You may find it helpful to turn down game music and turn up the sound when searching for missiles, as they have a distinct sound effect whenever you're near one."
Metroid,3b4lat,Pyropter,2,Fri Jun 26 00:24:54 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip! I'm pretty sure my last save was in the Magmoor Caverns so I'm right by Chozo Ruins. I'll definitely give that a thorough search.

Would still retain much of the feel of Metroid while contributing to the plot of the story (though, to be honest, we don't really need to know much about that squad other than what Prime 2 already tells us).  Then again, I've always wanted a Federation/Space Pirate game that's kinda like Battlefront. But that wouldn't really feel very Metroidy.  I just really need that Fusion sequel. That's pretty much it. I can survive without another Prime game for a while."
Metroid,3az8ah,Jacobee125,2,Wed Jun 24 18:10:14 2015 UTC,Your version is much more human than mine. Its so cool to see how people translate the characters we all know but are mostly familiar with via a small pile of pixels.

Metroid,3b0zk3,MemyselFishness,18,Thu Jun 25 02:27:30 2015 UTC,The 25th anniversary came and went without a word. There is no reason to believe the 30th will be any different.
Metroid,3b0zk3,A-Brain-At-Work,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:22:56 2015 UTC,"But that was one year after Other M, nobody really wanted anything that Nintendo didn't have readily available."

Metroid,3b0zk3,downforce,10,Fri Jun 26 03:32:50 2015 UTC,"I would rather see Nintendo take AM2R straight to Wii U as an eShop downloadable title. Price it at $19.99 and see what the market wants based on a 2D offering first.  Metroid is an IP that would probably cost Nintendo money if they  dabble with a Wii U release that isn't a Super Metroidesque smash hit. Every other Nintendo gamer who has no interest in Metroid will be the main factor in future Metroid title because Nintendo won't waste big development money on a title that will only sell 100,000 copies."
Metroid,3b0zk3,SephithDarknesse,2,Thu Jun 25 04:12:41 2015 UTC,"To counter your point, they already did, with the virtual console market, they probably then determined that Metroid Prime Trilogy would be a great eShop title. The way Metroid Prime Trilogy sold allowed development of Federation Force, and probably more."
Metroid,3b0zk3,tccrist,2,Thu Jun 25 04:20:25 2015 UTC,It doesnt cost anywhere near as much manpower to bring the game to the eShop though.
Metroid,3b0zk3,Jakesta7,3,Thu Jun 25 05:55:52 2015 UTC,"Not saying it won't be an eShop, just saying that they already tested the market and are probably not going to take a fan made remake and sell it. (Probably wouldn't want to split the profits with the creators.)"
Metroid,3b0zk3,p0rkch0ps,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:14:15 2015 UTC,"Why bother splitting the profits when you can just hire said fan as a full time Metroid game designer?  Of course, Nintendo won't do that, but I can dream."
Metroid,3b0zk3,Dmav210,6,Tue Jun 30 15:46:29 2015 UTC,"Just being completely honest, it would not be in Nintendo's best interest to burn a Metroid game on the Wii U. The last big game will be Zelda, I keep seeing people in denial about this but it is true. They're a business, they're going to release Star Fox, then Zelda, and be done with big games for this system."
Metroid,3b0zk3,p0rkch0ps,3,Thu Jun 25 05:21:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Remember Wii's swan song? Skyward Sword is the final big release for Wii. Zelda Wii U will likely be cross platform (as will all wii u games) and launch shortly before NX. Reggie confirmed NX will be talked about next E3, so I really wouldn't count on getting anymore unannounced major wii u titles. What has been announced is in devolpment and thats it... Nintendo hopefully has begun working on NX launch titles. They need a strong launch!"
Metroid,3b0zk3,Polantaris,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:41:42 2015 UTC,"If it's a cross platform title then why such an emphasis on the gamepad? Either the gamepad would be coming along to the new console, or you guys are flipping out over nothing. Just because they're gonna talk about it next e3 doesn't mean it's directly around the corner. It could still be 2 years away at that point..."
Metroid,3b0zk3,Jakesta7,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:32:51 2015 UTC,"Emphasis on the gamepad was because it was intended for Wii U and not NX. Gamepad will probably work with NX as I think Nintendo would want to carry over their library to larger audience. I think 2017 is the release date, meaning 2016 will be what we already know is coming. This is what always happens towards the end of their console's life. I'm not complaining, I think Wii U has awesome enough content and it's all exclusive titles. Star Fox 0 is gonna be dope."
Metroid,3b0zk3,LuxShadow1,2,Thu Jun 25 23:30:07 2015 UTC,"They could've been developing it for a while, and it could be cross platform with NX, it does make sense, and it makes even more sense to keep it a secret."
Metroid,3b0zk3,LuxShadow1,2,Thu Jun 25 05:29:44 2015 UTC,"The last big game will be Zelda, I keep seeing people in denial about this but it is true.   That's implying that the Zelda game will even make it to the Wii U. It might not. There's a reason it was absent from E3 this year.  The new Zelda game might be a twofer, being on both the NX and Wii U...but right now it doesn't look like they plan to release it for the Wii U at all, otherwise we would have seen something this year about it.  Face it...the Wii U is dead already. It's their biggest failure next to the Virtual Boy. The Wii U had a few good titles, and that was it. I can count the good titles on my fingers (Monster Hunter 3U, Mario Kart, Smash, Super Mario 3D World, New Super Mario Bros 2, Pikmin 3, Splatoon, Bayonetta 2, and Xenogears). And not everyone will enjoy every one of those. Those are pretty much the only games I would recommend looking at if you had a Wii U. I regret my Wii U purchase, utterly and completely."
Metroid,3b0zk3,LuxShadow1,2,Thu Jun 25 09:15:07 2015 UTC,Completely agree. I get downvoted like crazy if I say that Zelda might even just be in the same boat as Twilight Princess. People don't like the facts.

Metroid,3b0zk3,Wolfhyrr,0,Thu Jun 25 04:56:31 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, Nintendo has stated in the past that they would rather surprise the community and release sooner rather than later, instead of telling us that it is planned to release in 3 years sort of a thing. They wouldn't even reveal it because of bad reactions because they had footage of Zelda U ready, but decided to wait because people are impatient."
Metroid,3b0zk3,blaiseisgood,2,Thu Jun 25 05:01:19 2015 UTC,"They are dwindling down Wii U support slowly though. They only seem to be supporting the system towards the end of 2016, and let it slowly die off, kind of how the Wii went down, but even worse. To me, it wouldn't be within their interest to put a Metroid game now on the WiiU, not with the NX in it's horizon.  I'd like to stay optimistic, and like you said, their is the possibility of a surprise announcement, but it feels like it's just too late to happen at this point, Metroid's anniversary is coming up soon, and it only seems the Federation Force is what we get for Metroid's anniversary."
Metroid,3b0zk3,IHadFunOnce,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:09:37 2015 UTC,"They are dwindling down on new titles. This metroid game could have been in production for over a year and a half.

The thing is they tend to stay there since people try to speculate on a hand full of information. And that's a big part of why there is SO little content. The only things we know is that there is a mission mode and a sports mode. With co-op. And that it has incredibly murky textured chibi characters.  I suppose if they had announced Prime 4: The hunt for the last X core, or whatever it would have been called people would have posted an analysis of the trailer. And even then it would just be a trailer alone. The hype discussion wouldn't be much larger then the controversy we have going on now."

So what's the big deal with them? And why is it such a big focus? Honestly, I'm sick of these ""in between"" games. I want to see where Samus goes AFTER Fusion. New suit, new possibilities. Why isn't there focus on that? Since the last Metroid game: 5 years. Since the last Metroid game in terms of the story's chronology: 12 years. Either way, Nintendo seriously needs to pick up the slack."

That being said... Metroid Prime is amazing.  I'd rank it just below Super Metroid in terms of quality.    It might seem a little dated now, but if you have access to a Wii, do yourself a favor and play it.  It is 100% canonical Metroid and it is extremely fun and evokes a sense of loneliness and mystery that makes Super Metroid so compelling."
Metroid,3b0d2l,doombot813,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:29:42 2015 UTC,"I'm with you with the in between point. Fusion is my favorite Metroid game, story wise (I haven't played MP3 yet, or gone back to read all the lore from MP1), but based on the facts we have, it looks like our next game is Metroid Prime 4, which will start off where MP3 left off, and it's not coming anytime soon.  I think what's going on is that Sakamoto is the ""keeper"" of the 2D Metroid titles, which he wrote and directed, and they are all his babies. I think he's said that he considers Prime to be part of its own timeline in the series, and the games he works on are separate, but I've never seen a source on that.  Anyway, he's currently more interested in working on non-traditional games and although he doesn't rule out working on another Metroid game again, he does not seem to be very interested in making another 2D Metroid the same way he has before.  Without him, I'm not sure if we'll ever see a game pick up from where Fusion left off."

Metroid,3axj22,editorguy117,32,Wed Jun 24 08:18:09 2015 UTC,"I will be honest.  I went through that whole teenage phase of not wanting to play Nintendo games because they were kiddy and whatnot. I then started giving them a chance again by the last few years of high school / first years of college and got hooked, the same magic! It was awesome.  Nowadays, I am kinda tired that everything Nintendo seems to put out has to be cutesy and easily accessible. I do not hate the style, but I think I'm over saturated of Nintendo's palette right now.  Why can't we have a gritty game from the Big N? OoT and MM were both pretty epic and well stylized, while Mario 64 was colorful and cheery! There's no reason to avoid one style over others.  As of right now, I feel like Nintendo is very unbalanced in their decisions. They go ALL the way in ONE way. Back during the N64 and GCN eras they were able to split their creative output and produce games that could appeal to every audience. Now it seems that everything is cheery and even in some cases dumbed down.  Splatoon is a great game. It's amazing. But I honestly feel a little overwhelmed by the super bright, hyper colored graphics. And it's not because the game is overbearing, but because most of the stuff the Big N has put out recently is pretty much like it! Mario Kart, Wooly World, Smash, 3D World. Even StarFox looks very bright and the character models seem to be less realistic and more towards a cartoony style. Which is fine if we look at the game in a vacuum. It looks gorgeous. But when you go back to your Wii U library, everything except Bayonetta and Hyrule Warriors is exactly like that.  I love my entire Wii U library, but the style is getting pretty tiring."
Metroid,3axj22,nikovan_smash,14,Wed Jun 24 08:47:31 2015 UTC,"Why can't we have a gritty game from the Big N?    Well, Xenoblade Chronicles X comes out soon, which I'm looking forward to. To be honest, though, until the teen-to-young-adult demographic gets past the whole teenage mentality of ""I can't play nintendo games it'll ruin my street cred"", gritty games will tend to sell better on Xbox or Playstation. Nintendo needs some sort of assurance that people will buy the same style of games that Nintendo made with Metroid, Zelda, classic Fire Emblem, F-Zero, and Eternal Darkness before the company is going to focus on making more of them. Fire Emblem had to go anime-styled to keep turning a profit, F-Zero hasn't sold more than 500k copies of a game since 1990, and Eternal Darkness...well, I'll just say that ZombiU sold twice as many copies as Eternal Darkness and leave it at that.  There's the real reason. We can't have a gritty game from the Big N because when they do, even if they make a fantastic game, no one tends to buy it as much as they buy Mario Kart or Pokemon. not that I have anything wrong with those series, but that's what's up.  The thing is that even if the entire Metroid fanbase bought a game, it's still not going to be as profitable as Nintendo's other series unless there's a good amount of mainstream/non-Metroid-fans who buy it too, and I don't really see that happening without some aggressive advertising."

Metroid,3axj22,Rimas_LXBYA,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:35:45 2015 UTC,"It's because of the install base. Anyone who exclusively enjoys gritty games has no home on a Nintendo console because realism doesn't look as good as on the other consoles, and heavy hitting serious and gritty games are hard to come by. That leaves only the part of the base that overlaps both gritty and colorful to buy and enjoy their more serious games, and they don't add up.  Nintendo keeps trying to lure them back though, they promoted a serious gritty title, ZombiU, at the WiiU's launch, and I think they own Bayonetta now, but until they can properly maintain a stream of good serious games and break the family friendly only curse that was cast in the Game Cube era and cemented on the Wii, they don't have the install base to make a gritty game actually sell well.  I also think this is why they announced the NX so early as a hardcore console and nothing more. They are trying to squeeze back into the market that Xbox and Playstation hoarded."

Metroid,3axj22,PhazonZim,3,Wed Jun 24 08:41:50 2015 UTC,"I really think that cel-shaded/cartoon-esque graphics fit the Zelda series better than any other style (The Wind Waker is my personal aesthetic-favorite in the franchise, with Twilight Princess being my least favorite in terms of art direction), as the combat is extremely non-realistic and cartoonish (enemies bouncing off of Link's sword rather than being cut, the series' ultra-fantastical boss designs, etc.). I think the more realistic the graphics in a Zelda game are, the more silly the action comes off at times, whereas the battles look perfectly at home in a more cel-shaded title like Skyward Sword.  Federation Force's art style is definitely the least of the game's problems. A non-gritty Metroid title could be really cool, but not when the franchise's intrinsic, core gameplay elements, like exploration and map-scouring, take a backseat to bullet spraying/run-and-gunning."
Metroid,3axj22,ninjakitty7,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:16:27 2015 UTC,"Because Zelda is medieval fantasy, I personally prefer Ocarina and Twilight Princess's more serious art style. It sets the stage for war better."

Metroid,3axj22,breakmanblues,4,Tue Jun 30 03:59:28 2015 UTC,"Nintendo fans seem submissive to having their series cartoonified.   Well, if you remember when Wind Waker was announced, ""submissive"" is the last word I'd use to describe the reaction. People were furious (even though the visual change from OOT/MM to Wind Waker wasn't even as radical a change as the one we're talking about now). After all the negative reactions, Wind Waker comes out to critical acclaim and is now thought of as one of the best action-adventure games ever made. Granted, Federation Force most likely won't ever be considered a classic like Wind Waker, but the fan backlash for both was similar (and if the internet had been this widespread at the time, the Wind Waker backlash would have been much worse.)  Besides the whole Wind Waker ordeal (which seems to have resolved itself now that the Zelda series has multiple flavors of gameplay that people are happy with), Nintendo hasn't ever really taken a character and made them drastically more chibi until the GF troopers here. Their more realistic/humanoid characters, like Captain Falcon, Little Mac, and Fire Emblem characters, have largely kept a similar visual style over the past 20-30 years.   having their series cartoonified   I think a lot of people aren't realizing that this is one game being cartoonified, not the ""series"". If there's still enough fan demand for a traditional Metroid, Nintendo will make another traditional Metroid."
Metroid,3axj22,breakmanblues,-2,Wed Jun 24 10:08:20 2015 UTC,That is true that one game does not mean the whole series. But I have lost quite a bit of faith in Nintendo. I view this art style as a sign of things to come. And when we see Metroid Wii U or NX it might look chibi too.
Metroid,3axj22,Akran_Trancilon,2,Wed Jun 24 11:58:57 2015 UTC,"No, it won't, because Nintendo knows what the fans want. Meaning, that we will get a real and full Metroid game (NOT NECESSARILY PRIME 4) with true graphics. MP:FF is aimed for kids, and for Japan, which is why it is chibi and cutesy. Metroid Prime 4 or Metroid 5 will be aimed towards the fans AND the general audience."
Metroid,3axj22,MemyselFishness,2,Wed Jun 24 19:33:34 2015 UTC,"Another thing to note is the 3DS tends to appeal to younger audiences, and the Metroid series (besides Smash Bros.) hasn't done anything recently to get younger fans interested in the series (which is where new fans come from). If Federation Force gets kids in the 10-14 demographic interested in Metroid, then the next game should come out around the time they're teenagers and looking for something a bit more mature."
Metroid,3axj22,Akran_Trancilon,0,Wed Jun 24 20:57:30 2015 UTC,I don't see why kids 10-14 wouldn't be interested in Metroid Prime 1-3 + hunters. I was back when I was that age :/

Metroid,3axj22,BlockyAnubis,6,Fri Jun 26 04:47:20 2015 UTC,"Japan likes things that are cute. It's ""Kawaii"", which is deeply engrained in their culture, which is really a result of the about-face from being an imperialist warlike nation back in the 30s and 40s. Being Kawaii to them is like what being sexy is to us. It's something desirable. This ranges from adorable cute to sexy cute.  Nintendo has always made characters that could easily be seen as being Kawaii. Pretty much every Mario game ever made has some sort of Kawaii element in it, especially the new ones. And don't even get me started on Kirby. Kirby is just a super concentrated pink fluffball of Kawaii.  Nintendo received some backlash when they Kawaiified Link in Wind Waker. However, the game was ultimately well received in the end, partly because it's a good game, and also because Zelda was a series that was easy to Kawaiify. Most of the games involved a top down view of a sprite. The only games that didn't have that were Ocarina and Majora. The sprite doesn't even look that tall or 'serious', so it was easy to make Link's character Kawaii, especially since he already looks kind of anime-ish anyway.  Metroid however, has thus far been the one series that hasn't been subject to being Kawaii until now. Part of this is that it wasn't as popular in Japan as it was in the West. Another part is that the source material it is based off of is the total opposite of what Kawaii is. Not a whole lot of people find being raped by an Alien monster, being impregnated, and then having it forcibly rip its way out of your rib cage and then eating you, is very attractive. Those who do usually have issues.  Up until Other M, Metroid games, while not having as stellar sales as other franchises, were still relatively successful, and enjoyed high ratings. Other M was not well received, and faced severe backlash. It was the first new Metroid game since Prime 3, and for a less popular series such as Metroid, this was not a good thing.  I'm guessing that Nintendo saw the miserable sales of Other M, and thought, ""hey, if making things cute and cuddly worked for our other franchises, maybe it will boost sales, especially in our home market where they like that stuff"".  Unfortunately, the die hard fans of the Metroid series don't like Metroid for chibi, they like it for a multitude of other reasons, namely that it's a little more mature than the other franchises, it is inspired by really dark films, and its excellent game design.  In short, Nintendo makes things cute because that sells, and when a series isn't selling well, they can either make it cute, take a risk, or scrap it."

Metroid,3axj22,BlockyAnubis,-2,Thu Jun 25 00:23:00 2015 UTC,"I like your reasoning, but I just have to point out that, since it was really annoying me, kawaii doesn't mean cute. It means awesome.

Metroid,3axj22,Laughing_Luna,2,Wed Jun 24 22:35:58 2015 UTC,"My point is that the art style in Zelda wasn't originally realistic or at least consistently realistic. One example where he's (probably) realistically proportioned out of five doesn't really mean that that game's artwork was realistic. Not to mention that the in-game graphics were chubby and cutesy.  And returning to Metroid, that game's in-game graphics were also not the kind of realistic that we see in Super Metroid. Look at Ridley. Aside from being nigh-impossible to identify, he's that level of cute that a pug has. Look at Kraid. What is that, like a horned hedgehog? Hedgehogs are adorable!  Now, what I'm saying is... these sprites were created this way not only to try and convey the artwork, but to also provide functionality. They're bright, to contrast with the dark background and they're big so that you can see them.  Windwaker's graphics are the way they are to evoke that childhood cartoon feel of a child going on an adventure. And yes, because cute things sell in Japan.  Federation Force's graphics are supposedly done that way to compensate for the 3DS's supposed small screen. You can see wider objects better than thinner ones. And the feeling that FF is going for seems to be ""having fun with your team"" which is kind of like a cartoon-ish thing (although not limited to that). And mind you, I'm not too happy about Federation Force.  Plus, some people might actually like the ""cartoony"" style more than the ""realistic"" style. Not to mention, it often seems like the more realistic graphics look outdated a few years later while ""cartoony"" ones look great decades later. So... *shrugs*"

Metroid,3axj22,Mortimer42,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:35:13 2015 UTC,"That’s possible, Metroid has never done well in Japan.   Nintendo their main entries have always had very cute graphics. Kirby and Zelda for instance. Which is not to say they never touch on anything dark ( Majora Mask, and the Zero boss battle for instance ) but the overall tone of them has always been very light. What I fear is that they may use this as an opportunity to boot out the old aesthetics and feeling of the narrative in order to go for a cuter lighter sense of tone"
Metroid,3axj22,uberguby,2,Wed Jun 24 08:52:48 2015 UTC,Well Zelda never had cutesy visuals until wind waker. Then it went back to realistic for a brief time. And it went back to toony and has been that way ever since. I'd say at least half the Zelda games had a darker and more realistic vibe. It's mostly the recent ones that have made a departure.
Metroid,3axj22,kmeisthax,2,Wed Jun 24 12:00:21 2015 UTC,"Say what you want, but really only OoT MM and TP haven't had cutesy visuals. (Zelda and Zelda 2 excluded because of 8 bit and realism and cartoony is hard to achieve.) To prove it just look at the cover art for all the games. Zelda was always cartoony, but TP changed that. If you look at the faces in Oot and MM they are as anime as a 64 bit 3D game could get at the time. Twilight Princess has been the only game that was not cutesy ON purpose. Everyone is calling MP:FF cutesy and chibi, but we only know that MP:BB is. It may not be as nitty gritty as the rest of the primes, but we have definitely over exaggerated the chibi."
Metroid,3axj22,kmeisthax,0,Wed Jun 24 19:29:10 2015 UTC,Anime =/= cutesy though. As for the older Zelda's they wern't overly cartoony either. Compare ALTTP to ALBW http://www.gengame.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/link-albw-change.png
Metroid,3axj22,MemyselFishness,2,Wed Jun 24 22:26:56 2015 UTC,"Eh, the style changes work for Zelda because the art direction is a part of each story.  The whole aesthetic of Zelda is not meant to be stapled down.  Sure some installments will be toony, but unless it's a direct relation to a pre-existing installment, that art direction will be entirely different than a prior (toony)game's art direction.  Mario is supposed to be fantastic, as such, the art direction will not be stapled, it will be bolted to the IP, and that's alright for Mario.  Starfox's art direction hasn't actually changed much.  I mean it has, but not in the same senses of Mario and Zelda.  To understand the roots of the art direction, remember that Starfox is supposed to look like puppets.    Then to understand the overall aesthetic of Starfox, take the Metroid Universe; remove the disparity; remove the barely functioning societies; remove the conditions where an army needs a sole super soldier to go behind the lines; change the depressing atmospheres to a lively ones; change the space pirates(and associates) to a madman wanting only a single system instead of the galaxy; now make everything brighter; now you have Starfox.  For Metroid, the darker and grittier styles fit the over all aesthetic because that's just how the universe is.  The GF doesn't have a rigid foundation, as much as they'd like you to think otherwise.  They aren't a pure entity like the Cornerian fleet is, they have corruption running almost rampant.  The Space Pirates don't care if they capture or destroy a world if they can't get anything worthwhile from it; in fact, they only reason they tried to capture Norion is because it was outright easier for them to send and land a leviathan than it would have been to get a fleet strong enough to at least glass the planet even close to the system, nevermind a ship actually capable of cracking the planet.  Metroid has enough characters(both named and implied) that are entirely self-serving to count as a general population - Samus is one of them.  SF has Pigma and maybe Andross as notable characters that fit that.  If the world is clean and the native society(ies) aren't crumbling and/or dead, it's an HQ world or new.  That's another thing, all of the greatest things to happen in the galaxy that Metroid takes place in, finished dying out with the Elysians; even then, they were already only the edges of the shadows of the Chozo who had faded before them.  The Bryonnians died as a society and a culture before humans even mastered fire, devolving into feral beasts.  The Luminoth are barely holding on and will never see the glory of their golden age again.  If any Ylla or N'kren exist, they don't make it known.  The Alimbics sacrificed everything to stop a cosmic terror.  This leaves the GF and the Space Pirates as the greatest civilizations in the Galaxy, and for all their glory and might, they are mere motes of dust in the legacies of the Chozo, Reptillicus, N'kren, Ylla, and the Luminoth.  SF on the other hand is at it's greatest peak of technology and civilization."
Metroid,3axj22,MemyselFishness,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:18:34 2015 UTC,"So your saying when the game's story takes place in a healthy civilization it should go for bright and cheery art styles, but when the civilization is at war or destroyed it should go for dark and gritty?

Metroid,3axj22,Akran_Trancilon,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:29:29 2015 UTC,"No, but they are conducive to the respective art styles.  It is possible for the peak of civilization appear to be closer to what you'd see in a Cyber-Punk setting and ruins to hold serenity.  Those are no the kinds of feels either is going for.

Metroid,3axj22,Samurai_Sangheili,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:06:08 2015 UTC,"First off: Link was chibi to begin with and later games rendered him in progressively less deformed proportions. Wind Waker went back to super-deformed proportions, but the most recent game in the series (Hyrule Warriors) uses regular proportions. So you may wanna swap the two Link images.  Second: Federation Force has that art style because the artists wanted to get around technical limitations of the 3DS. Before you point out the bevy of other games that have standard character proportions, keep in mind that those games have different requirements and made different tradeoffs. For example, they might have sacrificed texture quality somewhere on the model. Or they might be running at 30 fps instead of 60. Or they might have allocated polycount budget differently. Or their selected art style or character silhouette makes normal proportions look worse than super-deformed ones.  (Remember how Fire Emblem Awakening decided to deal with these sorts of issues by cutting off every character's feet?)"

In which case, Link has always been in super-deformed proportions until Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask.  If you think this isn't fair because 2D console sprites are a technical limitation (even though that's the whole point of my argument...) then I would take a look at Link's Awakening and it's photographs, all of which show Link in a super-deformed proportion and are concept art specifically designed to be shown without animation or placement into a playfield."

Mario is just small bite sized courses, each of them individual from one another. I don't think it's very likely to see a Maker game where you make entire metroid worlds.  I could see a Zelda dungeon maker working, with skins from Zelda 1, ALttP, and ALBW. I can see it working because again, dungeons are mostly self contained. It's not very likely though."
Metroid,3axpta,Wombo194,3,Wed Jun 24 15:37:40 2015 UTC,Sounds like Metroid Maker would bad an appropriately harder game than Mario Maker. :)

Metroid,3axpta,MemyselFishness,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:38:38 2015 UTC,"Good point, but I still think it would be awesome to be able to make your own game or at least world. Though I agree, it isn't very practical. One thing that could work however is something similar to Zelda dungeons. What if you could make a little course of area the player has to proceed through? Kinda like the sectors in Metroid fusion? Sure it wouldn't be anything like a traditional Metroid game (little exploration and back tracking) but it would still be neat. People could even speedrun certain courses. It would be cool to see that."

Metroid,3axpta,TheBrianJ,3,Wed Jun 24 16:04:07 2015 UTC,"A Metroid Maker would certainly be easier to make than a Zelda Maker, considering it's (usually) a 2D platformer like Mario.  I'd love to see one happen, but I have to wonder how it would be done.  Mario is set up in levels, while Metroid has an open world to explore.  Would users be making levels like Mario Maker, but with Metroid elements, or their own planets?"
Metroid,3axpta,SuperNanoCat,4,Wed Jun 24 13:35:40 2015 UTC,Zelda 1 dungeon maker would work pretty wel. It was even what the original zelda was meant as.

Metroid,3aw2i8,that_dude_you_know,6,Thu Jun 25 01:47:56 2015 UTC,Motion Controls actually work really well with Metroid Prime
Metroid,3aw2i8,BlockyAnubis,3,Wed Jun 24 03:10:11 2015 UTC,I found the motion controls to be much better than the GameCube controls. Looking around and movement aren't bound to the same stick which was a bit weird to me. You just have to enable a setting in the game for lock on where it centers your reticle on the lock and it's golden.
Metroid,3aw2i8,fpiceail,2,Wed Jun 24 05:16:53 2015 UTC,"Wait, like it always keeps the reticle in the center of the screen at all times? That I might be able to get behind."
Metroid,3aw2i8,that_dude_you_know,5,Wed Jun 24 05:19:19 2015 UTC,"Sort of. It was a really bad decision, but by default, when you lock on to an enemy with the motion controls, a lock circle goes around the enemy, but your reticle is still free to move around, so you have to lock and also point your reticle at the center of the lock to actually hit what it's locked on to. It's really bad in Prime 1 and 2 because the bosses are built to be hit in small precise spots, and keeping the reticle stable is a challenge. Enabling the setting means that if you lock on to something your reticle is locked to that entity too."
Metroid,3aw2i8,The_M4G,5,Wed Jun 24 05:48:18 2015 UTC,The motion controls for the Prime games were the single best control scheme I've ever used for any game ever.
Metroid,3aw2i8,Zarantyr,2,Wed Jun 24 12:48:07 2015 UTC,"I love the control scheme, but I'm still not sure if it beats a keyboard and mouse!"
Metroid,3aw2i8,Anggul,-1,Wed Jun 24 16:13:47 2015 UTC,"Fanboy nonsense, and you know it. WiiMotes were too small and could easily cause cramps after long periods of play. They also had probably the worst battery life out of any modern controller. They frequently lost connection/malfunctioned if you sat within 2 meters of the sensor.  As for the controls themselves: it's more difficult to steady your aim on an object than either dual-analog controls or mouse aiming. Easily the worst aspect is the turning: To turn around, you have to point the wiimote to the edge of the screen (don't point it too far, because it might malfunction and lock in place!) and watch it slow-turn to whatever you need to be looking at. Again, vastly inferior to both dual-analog and mouse-and-keyboard. The grapple beam? Push the nunchuck forward too fast and it won't work properly.   Basically, a whole bunch of annoying nonsense that you would never have to worry about with the Gamecube control scheme, let alone a modern dual-analog scheme. There is a good reason why the Wii housed pretty much zero competent and successful FPS. Sure, it had shitty CoD ports and the like, but everyone went to consoles that were far better suited for that type of game because motion controls fall flat for anything more involved than Wii Sports.  With the Wii U we are back to a conventional controller (besides the touch-screen gimmick which can be ignored in almost every title). If the WiiMote were any good for gaming, they would have stuck with it. But, alas, it wasn't."

I feel like 90% of my posts on this sub are defending Other M, but someone has to. Yes, the voice acting is cheesy, yes, the story is lame, yes, they reduce our beloved strong, courageous, unstoppable warrior Samus to a scared little girl who for some reason can't be trusted to defend herself, and it's painful.

I didn't like being locked in a room whenever dark pirate commandos showed up, and I didn't like when one of the last bosses stayed invincible for too long.

Metroid,3aw2i8,Kabuthunk,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:06:54 2015 UTC,"I'll insist that every major gameplay mechanic they added-aside from Screw Attack which was genuinely fun and spider boosting- was at best trivial, at worst detrimental. And I'm a huge fan of light/dark world mechanics, these ones just fell flat. They encouraged bad player behavior and didnt benefit the core experience. The world design was repetitive (Oh never saw a desert ruins or a swamp before, let alone smokey purple world where I'll spend more than half the game! The fortress was definitely improved over the Phazon mines, however) and predictable (get to the temple, get the principal update for the world, gather three keys, fight the boss-each world clearly branched from the center hub)  In contrast, Prime 3 was trying hard to be different. It built itself around a drastically different control scheme which makes it harder to directly compare to the others. I've been replaying the all with motion controls which should definitely help 'level the playing field', so my opinion on 3 may change now that it doesnt have the novelty of motion controls  It was still a very good game, dont get me wrong- saying its the worst Metroid Prime is like saying Cars 2 is the worst Pixar, its the worst among masterpieces but still outstanding"

I walked away from it in frustration once, but after I came back it became my favourite Metroid game by far. To me, it is the underappreciated and darker Majora's Mask to Prime's Ocarina of Time. Even though Ocarina is the one with the world duality mechanic like Echoes but nevermind that... Just know that Echoes isn't just harder in the sense of enemies being harder, it outright expects better combat skills, better observation skills and better navigation skills. And better ability to deal with pressure, too."
Metroid,3aw2i8,GhostlyPixel,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:47:43 2015 UTC,"I had a very similar experience with Echoes. I bought it on launch and played it, but got frustrated and turned it off, and didn't touch it for a few years. I picked it up after maybe 4 years and made my way through it... and I loved it. I've played it a few times since, and loved it on the Trilogy with motion controls. It's hard, but in the best way possible, and the lore aspect of that game was one of the best in the Metroid universe. Chozo lore for days."

Metroid,3aw2i8,seyon35,7,Wed Jun 24 13:46:20 2015 UTC,"2's even better. It has more bosses, and they are more challenging. There are more puzzles. There are more upgrades. The areas are better, except Agon Wastes. 3's also extremely good. I think Prime Trilogy is the best trilogy ever."
Metroid,3aw2i8,nettori,5,Wed Jun 24 14:15:41 2015 UTC,"I replay it every few years, and every time I'm surprised at how well it's held up over time."
Metroid,3aw2i8,Zarantyr,4,Wed Jun 24 05:50:46 2015 UTC,"I played it last year in an emulator at a little bit above 1080p (it was rendered at 4x the GameCube's resolution so that the screen ratio was still the same) and the game is absolutely still pretty nice looking. Honestly I only noticed a low-res texture on the solid black lines in Samus' suit, other than that it looked fantastic! Especially for a 13 year old game."
Metroid,3aw2i8,curesunshine,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:54:44 2015 UTC,13 years.... Jesus im getting old. Sill remember being over the moon that after 8 years I got a new Metroid (2 games as I got fusion the same day).
Metroid,3aw2i8,shred802,3,Wed Jun 24 09:03:11 2015 UTC,"I'm blown away at how well these games have aged! I'm not old enough to appreciated how good these games looked back when they were new, but they must have been incredible!"
Metroid,3aw2i8,Skayj2,2,Wed Jun 24 16:22:52 2015 UTC,"The backtracking, and lack of shortcuts to get to places was horrible in that game.  But the final boss made up for all its flaws :)"
Metroid,3aw2i8,Darkjolly,2,Wed Jun 24 07:40:46 2015 UTC,"I fully recommend the wii versions (metroid prime trilogy) if you have a wiimote and sensor bar for your wii u. The controls are, in my opinion, the best console FPS controls of all time."
Metroid,3aw2i8,Albafika,2,Wed Jun 24 15:42:02 2015 UTC,"Don't listen to the haters, Prime 2 is secretly the best one. The original is still the best to just come back to though since it's much more forgiving."

Metroid,3awyby,xLinkFrostx,13,Wed Jun 24 04:11:56 2015 UTC,"Go for the PC emulator. Playing platformers with touch controls is perhaps the absolute worst way to go about things (especially for Super Metroid where some situations would call for you needing to hold down four buttons at the same time), and you'd be missing a lot of atmosphere and immersion if you're gonna be playing the two games on a small screen. Use higan for SNES and VBA-M for GBA.   Also, is there any possible way to home brew a 3DS with GBA roms?   I don't have a 3DS myself, but I assume that it's not too far off from Wii homebrew. From a bit of Google it seems that you can. However, apparently newer firmwares patched the exploit required to launch homebrew software."
Metroid,3awyby,rqaa3721,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:30:01 2015 UTC,I am going to second this. It looks good on a big screen and the controls are easier this way. Quicksaving at any time with one button is also usefull when you try to reach the secret message in Fusion^

Metroid,3awyby,powermad80,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:27:14 2015 UTC,"Also, is there any possible way to home brew a 3DS with GBA roms?

Nothing is close to PSP levels of mod-friendly.   http://wololo.net/2015/06/09/gba-rom-injection-now-possible-3ds/"
Metroid,3awyby,sikaxis,3,Wed Jun 24 11:44:55 2015 UTC,Homebrewing on a 3ds seems like it's still in the work. But I know they have some great GBA emulators on the PSP if you had one.

Metroid,3awyby,Butter_Is_Life,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:09:42 2015 UTC,"LIke rqaa3721 said, avoid platformers on touch controls, good golly. Now, RPGs are great on touch since they're not input heavy, but absolutely go for PC emulator for Zero Mission and Super.   Wii homebrew is a nice alternative if you have a Wii, an SD Card, and the proper controller  (Classic Controller feels awesome for it since it resembles the SNES layout and design)."
Metroid,3awszc,ZobmieRules,5,Wed Jun 24 03:21:02 2015 UTC,I was expecting a game about the fans of Metroid with a name like that.
Metroid,3awszc,samus12345,2,Wed Jun 24 22:44:15 2015 UTC,what kind of game was it? a hack? maybe RPGMaker?
Metroid,3awszc,AuraRyu,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:12:12 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a hack, no... But I think it was actually a GameMaker game! Gonna try another Google search.   Edit: After another fruitless (yet originally hopeful) search, I'm wondering more and more about what happened to it! I'm going to start a total drive search on my laptop to see if that has any files related to the game."
Metroid,3awszc,Wombo194,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:36:26 2015 UTC,"I thought I found it, but it was just an old version of Confrontation. Not what I'm looking for. I refuse to give up though. And when I find it, I'm going to play through it all! (I never got that far in. Only the first boss, which was very difficult.)   Edit: Turns out I never answered your original question! It was a standard 2D Metroid game, but completely original in terms of physics/graphics (it didn't feel/look like any other entry in the series, but it was inarguably Metroid). I would say engine as well, but considering the quality of the game, I doubt the maker was able to code a game engine. It was a software download, so not some random flash game on a website."
Metroid,3awszc,iTookThis1,3,Sat Jun 27 05:31:53 2015 UTC,"I don't know of any Metroid Desperation game, but I do know of Metroid: Confrontation which is a GameMaker game like you said and the title sounds kinda similar.

Some more ice, fire, and jungle levels with metal walls everywhere and no-name human soldiers capturing the deadly ""Ice Beasts?"" What new aspects are being touched on here? There's no exploration of new ideas here, there's only a vague idea of a game stretched beyond blandness. This is basically an arcade mode game you should be unlocking in a REAL game. Shit, Other M is canon and everyone's trying hard to forget that, you think METROID PRIME FEDERATION FORCE is going to include anything new and interesting with all the new aspects of the Metroid universe they're exploring here? It's a baby shit shovelware game thrown in the middle of Nintendo's only mildly serious franchise offering everything nobody ever wanted."

Metroid,3aucr3,PointZ3RO,6,Tue Jun 23 16:37:17 2015 UTC,This quote makes me think of the MM3D press cycle. It was announced complete with release date and less than 6 months later it was completely out.

Metroid,3aucr3,nikovan_smash,2,Wed Jun 24 01:22:12 2015 UTC,I'd buy that day 1 if they ever made it
Metroid,3aucr3,joecb91,38,Wed Jun 24 17:28:04 2015 UTC,"Good to hear that they ""know"" that fans want a straight Samus Aran game, and it is understandable that they would prefer to give us a release date and let us put hands onto it when it's announced.  From what I saw from the announcement, I don't think Federation Force can be compared that well to Wind Waker. Wind Waker's controversy was solely towards its art style. People didn't like the way it looked initially, but it was a Zelda game. You played Link, you traversed a world, you cleared dungeons and found items.  In addition to the distaste towards the art style, it's absolutely clear that Federation Force is not a Metroid game. Not in the traditional sense, anyway. When I think Metroid, and specifically Prime, I think of the isolation. I think of exploring an alien planet drenched in atmosphere and history. I think of the creepy environment, and scanning a Space Pirate corpse and learning that its death was caused by the removal of its internal organs. For reference, this isn't just nostalgia talking. I actually just finished a replaythrough of Prime yesterday, and damn does that game still hold up.  What we're getting in Federation Force, as far as I can tell from the trailer that was seemingly thrown into the digital event and then not talked about, is a mission-based co-operative shooter. To me, this feels almost the polar opposite of what Prime was. This isn't to say that I just want a HD remake of Prime 1. I'm alright with them trying new things. Prime 2 deviated a bit with the ammo system (which I personally disliked) and the light and dark world, and Prime 3 had stackable beam upgrades and other characters with voice acting (Rundas is my main man). This is just far off enough that it can only be called a spin-off.  Spin-offs are not the worst thing in the world. I don't mind them at all, in fact. The only problem with Federation Force being a spin-off is the fact that we're coming out of a 5 year Metroid drought, and the first mention of Metroid in the entire time (outside of the ""We know Metroid exists, don't worry"" we got during an interview last E3) is an announcement for a spin-off that was the most throw-away announcement of the entire presentation. That's what upset me most. I didn't mind Prime Pinball or Hunters in the slightest, but those came out in a time where we were still getting Metroid games fairly regularly.  On a side note, the interviewer mentions that he's not worried about Federation Force since it's being developed by NLG, and "" . . . Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon is fantastic."" I may be alone in this, as I didn't really look into reviews when it came out, but I'm going to have to disagree with him on that. Thinking about it now, it actually makes me a bit more worried for Federation Force knowing that the people behind Dark Moon are developing it. Personally, I felt Dark Moon was a very poor successor to Luigi's Mansion. Funnily enough, in retrospect, the original Luigi's  Mansion was a bit of a Metroidvania. You explored a more-or-less open map, finding keys and abilities, which unlocked more areas in places you've already been. Dark Moon was a mission-based Luigi's Mansion game, with too few generic ghost types. In fact, one of the biggest gripes I had with Dark Moon was that every boss was basically the same type ghost, just possessing different stuff. One of the things I absolutely loved most about the original Luigi's Mansion was the variety of ghost types, and especially all the boss ghosts. Each one was different and interesting, and just exposing the bosses was a puzzle in and of itself.   With that in mind, we'll just have to see how Federation Force turns out. If others shared the same gripes that I had about Dark Moon, maybe they'll take that feedback and integrate the changes into Federation Force. Honestly, it looks like it could be fun, and the petition to have it cancelled is childish and frankly embarrassing. I just wish we could have had an actual Metroid game first, is all."
Metroid,3aucr3,Hellhunter120,4,Tue Jun 23 16:36:34 2015 UTC,The only thing I have to disagree with you on is Dark moon. That game was swag as fuck.

Metroid,3aucr3,Stephanapalooza,0,Tue Jun 23 18:10:31 2015 UTC,"I'll go further and say that the art style isn't the issue despite the crap this Reddit keeps believing. If the demo wasn't about a Legend of Korra episode, I would've been optimistic."
Metroid,3aucr3,Akran_Trancilon,4,Tue Jun 23 20:19:24 2015 UTC,"i think it would have been a lot easier to get past if it wasn't multiplayer. the demo showed the art style itself was more focused on character colors because co-op, rather than giving them all unique details to differentiate them. part of my issue is without samus they could easily be a star wars game where we play as colour coded mandalorian droids. Also if this were a  single player game we wouldn't have to worry about the model as its always off screen, we can pretend to be anyone.   However all the relevant game play is their, and it certainly looks like it plays as a Metroid prime game would."
Metroid,3aucr3,Denazer,3,Wed Jun 24 00:08:55 2015 UTC,"It's a big issue, but it's definitely not the only one.   Also, don't downvote him, people. Opinions aren't bad things."
Metroid,3aucr3,Hellhunter120,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:37:51 2015 UTC,"Bullshit. The biggest issue by far is the fact that it is mission based.

Metroid,3aucr3,Sagotomi,6,Wed Jun 24 18:02:29 2015 UTC,"Does that make the comparison invalid for some reason?  I mean I would understand the logic if Smash Bros had Metroid in the title for some reason, but FF is set in the Metroid world, has Metroid elements, will make Metroid references, heck I'm betting we will see a few actual metroids in there somewhere and probably Samus showing up just for the heck of it. The controls are basically identical to the Prime series too. If it's not a single player game where you play as Samus, is that reason enough to drop the name of the franchise out of the title? Really?"
Metroid,3aucr3,SaiphCharon,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:24:40 2015 UTC,"What, does that mean that Paper Mario should just drop ""Mario"" from the title because it follows only a few of the standards of a ""real"" Mario game? Come on! Not only that, but dropping the ""Metroid"" from Federation Force would require them to change nearly everything about it. It would lose so much of its charm, just for some dissatisfied fan.  Or did you mean that they should just rid the title of the words ""Metroid Prime""? In that case... what's the point?"
Metroid,3aucr3,ThouArtSilly,8,Wed Jun 24 19:40:46 2015 UTC,"See I have heard a lot of people defend this game on the basis that it will pull a Wind Waker and I don't think that holds up.  For starters the gameplay is nothing like Metroid. It is only connected in the sense it is an FPS and on top of that, I don't think this is a fitting art style for the series. Where Metroid differs from Wind Waker is that Zelda is just a fairy tale. It is a simple light hearted tale of hero saving princes. And the Wind Waker aesthetics perfectly reflect that.   Metroid took inspiration from classic horror movies, and that doesn't blend so well with the chibi art style the game has going.   That and I am not a fan of Next Level Games, I think they don't do altogether well designed games. But that's just me."
Metroid,3aucr3,Mortimer42,7,Tue Jul 7 23:46:58 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, have you played through all of Wind Waker?    That game is one of the darker in the series- with the entire world having been swallowed by gods  and pushed under the sea- an entire generation of people turned to stone (most of them evil), and the only survivors living on the islands that remain, with a fishless ocean and the Dark King (Ganondorf) still prowling the seas, kidnapping young girls?  It masks a lot of that in the cartoonish art of the Wind Waker series, but by no means is it ""just a fairy tale"".  It's beloved as one of the best Zeldas because the gameplay was tight and well designed, the game had a ton of depth, and relate-able characters."
Metroid,3aucr3,VoyagerOrchid,7,Tue Jun 23 16:48:45 2015 UTC,"Of course I have played it, it's one of my favorite games. I really like the Zelda series. However the series has flipped around to giant eggs sitting atop a mountain and a talking hat that can shrink you down to a thumb sized creature. What I'm saying is that while, yes there are sometimes underlying darker themes, the overall tone of it all is very juvenile. And Wind Waker captured this beautifully. From the graphics to the moment we get introduced to Link and is forced by his nan to cosplay as the hero of time.  What I fear is that Nintendo may use this to segway a light cartoony shift of tone to Metroid. Which would be a shame because it would clash horribly with the lonely, creepy atmospheres the games got famous for."
Metroid,3aucr3,Mortimer42,2,Wed Jun 24 07:35:36 2015 UTC,"Most reasonable thing I've read in this comment stream.    What I personally somewhat expect from FF at this point- a serious but very military objective based space coop game.  Still with the darker world/universe tones, but with the Galactic Federation perspective- dealing with enemies without super power suits, or morph ball, or even scanners.  And dealing with Space Pirates and a world that wants to kill you, and your squad of 2-3 other teammates."
Metroid,3aucr3,VoyagerOrchid,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:54:30 2015 UTC,"But how dark can one really set the tone with chibis?   It is a akin to dressing up H. R. Giger as a clown, that guy still wont do well at childerens parties."
Metroid,3aucr3,Mortimer42,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:48:54 2015 UTC,"I like how a reasonable conversation on expectations goes so quickly to ridiculous examples that are unlikely to be anything like what we're discussing.    Look, we don't even know the size of them compared to humans.  The ""chibi"" looking suits are basically mechs, with human riders inside (maybe?  We don't even that have information set).  We do know the blast ball ones have riders, and they're not that chibi as people, just the suits have larger torsos/heads.  The human ridrs aren't nearly as ""short or small"".  See the source image: http://im.ziffdavisinternational.com/t/ign_it/screenshot/default/enteringbotjpg-b57705-765w_gk7c.640.jpg  Plus, look at the Chozo R&D concept art from the galactic federation from Prime 3:   http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Chozo_R%26D_Division  Looks like large heads, full suit.  I'm guessing the concept is similar.  I suspect the suits aren't as ""small"" or ""chibi"" in relation to things as people are expecting."
Metroid,3aucr3,VoyagerOrchid,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:58:10 2015 UTC,"It was merely a jest, don't think too much of it.  The screenshot you provide is a large part of the problem I have with the game. It looks as if he has a massive head, and even if it is a mech then that is a helmet the size of his torso."
Metroid,3aucr3,Mortimer42,3,Wed Jun 24 23:27:20 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. What's wrong with a Metroid game that isn't a metroidvania? Paper Mario is still a Mario game, but is it terrible because it plays nothing like the main series? No, it's a great spin-off. I know, I know, ""it's been a decade since the last good Metroid game!"", which is true, but that doesn't mean that a quite possibly great game should be shot down because it isn't exactly like previous games in the series.  We'll see how the game turns out. It sounds like it'll be more than just soccer with guns and Monster Hunter with guns. There's a single-player that we haven't seen, and it's obviously going to have some sort of lore/story, considering it's supposed to explore how the GF goes on. And Samus will even show up..."
Metroid,3aucr3,MatrixChicken,-2,Thu Jun 25 06:54:45 2015 UTC,Thats not the issue. The one issue with MP:FF is the art style. Can you imagine a Halo game with a chibi art style releasing? No.   Metroid is just as serious.
Metroid,3aucr3,Stephanapalooza,6,Tue Jun 23 18:11:15 2015 UTC,"Wait... What, really?! Your problem is with the art style?! I... lol, wow...  Reggie's Wind Waker comparison really is true..."
Metroid,3aucr3,MatrixChicken,2,Tue Jun 23 18:16:21 2015 UTC,"Well like I said in my first comment, different games, different tone you want to set.  Zelda is not the grand heavy epic some would make it out to be. It's a fairy tale, and a light hearted cartoony aesthesis helps support that. Metroid on the other hand is all about dread and isolation. That doesn't work with cheesy chibi styled characters."
Metroid,3aucr3,Mortimer42,2,Tue Jun 23 19:00:02 2015 UTC,"Heard of Majora's Mask? That game sure is cartoony and light hearted, yup. Same with Twilight Princess.  And there's been plenty of aesthetic differences is many franchises, including Metroid. Fusion was a very colorful, bright game.  Not to mention, saying Metroid is a specific way is wrong. Metroid is what Nintendo makes it. You can say this game is different, but don't try to pass judgement until we know more."
Metroid,3aucr3,MatrixChicken,-2,Tue Jun 23 19:10:34 2015 UTC,"Majora's Mask is the odd one out in the Zelda franchise.   It is about an eternal loop of evil guy resurrects and good guy needs big sword so he can save land / princess. It is a fairy tale at it's core. You can dress and hype it up as epic but the core is simple Wind Waker embraced that. Which is why it was so good.  And yes the Metroid games have been very colorful. But the overarching tone and narrative has never been anything light and quirky like Zelda. People can talk up Nintendo all they want but this is a big shift in tone which is where the backlash is coming from. It would be as if the next Dark Souls would be an interactive dating sim, a perfectly fine game, but people don't want it out of a Dark Souls entry."
Metroid,3aucr3,Mortimer42,3,Tue Jun 23 19:41:55 2015 UTC,And how an you know the tone of federation force before you play it? What id it turns out to be sordid and dark to juxtapose the art-style? What if the unspoken bonds with team members makes for the darkest and most emotional scenes in Metroid yet? You don't know.
Metroid,3aucr3,Bind0fGod,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:33:31 2015 UTC,"Well, a juxtapose is often used as a surprise twist. This is what Majora Mask did very well. It presented us with, what we thought to be just another quirky Zelda title, and what we got was the story of a demon before time consuming the planet.   But the problem with Federation Force lies here. Everybody wanted this game to be next Metroid. And Metroid is well known for exactly those dark and haunting moments. So why drag a weirdly out of place cute art style along if that's just what you're going to give people?  Imagine the ending to Spec Ops: The Line where all characters have big cute anime eyes. It would rather damped the severity of the moment.  Then again..."
Metroid,3aucr3,Mortimer42,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:06:56 2015 UTC,"You're taking it out of proportion! Perhaps Federation Force wasn't meant to be quite as dark and haunting as the Prime Trilogy games. Maybe that isn't true, but it's something to consider.  That being said, if something is designed to be very sad or scary, of course huge, anime eyes will ruin the mood!"
Metroid,3aucr3,ThouArtSilly,4,Wed Jun 24 19:23:10 2015 UTC,"Lol, clearly incapable of seeing underlying deep tones if the games isn't shoving it in your face."
Metroid,3aucr3,henryuuk,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:32:42 2015 UTC,"Of course I perceive the underlying darker tones. However this is about the means of presentation. Zelda has always been good exceled at presenting us magical world to quest through and meet strange and funny people. They have always been world bustling with color and joy.  It's is the shift in tone that I'm concerned for here. The game has been about a creepy isolated atmosphere, which doesn't work well with cartoony chibi style."
Metroid,3aucr3,Mortimer42,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:11:43 2015 UTC,"So, lets say they go with this artstyle from now on. And we get metroid games with the same gameplay as before. ?"
Metroid,3aucr3,henryuuk,2,Wed Jun 24 08:29:11 2015 UTC,"That is some seriously impressive spin you're putting on Majora...  The Lord of the Rings is a fairy tale at its core. Evil guy resurrects and good guy needs to throw ring into volcano so he can save land.  Pick any ""epic"" story, simplify it, boom. Fairy tale. This isn't hard...  And you say Majora's Mask is the odd one out... Well, Federation Forces is the odd one out as well, that's what I'm saying...  Wind Waker was a departure from the usual aesthetic of Zelda. That's not what some fans wanted out of a new Zelda title. But it still holds up as a great game today.  Federation Forces is a lesser, but still significant departure from the usual aesthetic of Metroid. That's quite obviously not what lots of fans wanted from a new Metroid. I'm not saying FF will be amazing like WW, but it doesn't look terrible like so many of the salty fanboys are saying, and I'll wait to judge the game until we know more about it.  This whole situation reminds me of Melee vs. Brawl and SSB4... *shudders*"
Metroid,3aucr3,MatrixChicken,0,Wed Jun 24 08:36:50 2015 UTC,"But the Lord of the Rings are exactly that. They are simple stories about magical lands and strange people they meet. There is poetry and songs, or well at least in the original story. And Zelda is the same in many ways. It's all about saving the princess. There is nothing wrong with that, a simple story well told is nothing to be ashamed off.  And this is where Federation Force fails. Because it abandons all the series has build on for trooper chibis.  And really? An odd one out? After the disaster that was Other M and people almost begging Nintendo to just release a simple  2D entry. Nintendo did not need this, they needed a way to mend the wounds Other M left behind. And nobody asked for this title. There is no reason for this game to be a Metroid title."
Metroid,3aucr3,Mortimer42,3,Tue Jun 23 20:55:39 2015 UTC,"Oh that's right Lord of the Rings definitely isn't epic. EL OH EL  You think Nintendo was just like, ""Hey, we could make a main Metroid game, but nah, we'll just make a totally useless game that no one wants with no story!""? Because if so, you're wrong... It doesn't abandon all the series has built on. Tanabe said this game was to explore and expand the Metroid universe by showing is from the perspective of the Galactic Federation. And this isn't some tiny game, either, by the looks of it. Tanabe had the idea for it 10 years ago and was supposed to release along with the New 3DS. They had to be spending all this time on something."

Metroid,3aucr3,Bind0fGod,0,Tue Jun 23 21:59:53 2015 UTC,Not exactly. Yes Zelda is a fairy tale. But Zelda is a medieval fantasy like lord of the rings. Can you picture lord of the rings going for a toon art style?  Thats why Wind Waker had backlash at its reveal. Ocarina of Time while having anime-ish faces was still a more realistic looking Zelda game

Metroid,3aucr3,BlockyAnubis,0,Tue Jun 23 20:21:04 2015 UTC,Lets say MP:FF had samus and had metroid prime mechanics. If Samus looked like this: http://36.media.tumblr.com/1f54056fb2ba93e756bbb48c022c3c1e/tumblr_mpim0ntdpf1qhw77fo1_r1_500.png  Fans would be pissed too.
Metroid,3aucr3,Stephanapalooza,0,Wed Jun 24 08:01:27 2015 UTC,The aesthetics are still a big problem because they don't fit at all for Metroid. But I personally wouldn't be nearly as annoyed as I am now if it was still a legitimate Metroid game in terms of gameplay. FF is just a 4-player coop fps game with the Metroid logo slapped on...
Metroid,3aucr3,BlockyAnubis,-6,Tue Jun 23 16:56:03 2015 UTC,"Actually MP:FF's art style IS it's only issue.

Even if it didn't have samus, I'm sure the backlash wouldn't be nearly as bad. A fair amount of fans would be excited. Me included."
Metroid,3aucr3,Stephanapalooza,6,Tue Jun 23 20:17:57 2015 UTC,"Actually   ????  No?????  I'm finding that the art style is consistently one of the least criticized (and, if you ask me, least criticizable) things about this game.  Let me be frank with you: when I watched the trailer, I genuinely did not even notice that there was anything unusual about the art style. What I noticed was how shallow it looked-- just another multiplayer FPS game, with no hint of any connection to the things I enjoy about the Metroid franchise, other than its name. There was no sign of anything that makes Metroid games different from generic FPS games.  The art style is just about the only thing about this game that makes sense to me. The gameplay is lighter and simpler, shouldn't the aesthetic be as well? This game has no teeth. The classic darker Metroid aesthetic would feel stark and out-of-place. For this kind of game, a lighter art style just... fits.  I don't know how else to say it. The art style is not the only problem with this game, and I'm not convinced the art sytle is even a problem in the first place."
Metroid,3aucr3,thetacriterion,3,Wed Jun 24 15:45:35 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, here's the problems with FF:   It's not at all a Metroidvania game. The context it was released in is abysmal. (I'll explain at the end) The aesthetics don't work for Metroid at all. It's possibly the only game we get for the 30th anniversary of Metroid, which is ridiculous.    The context this game was released in is one of the bigger reasons it gets so much hate. Hunters and Pinball were released under the shadow of legitimate Metroid games, so the fans were happy to enjoy spin-offs along with real Metroid games.  But after years of waiting, and years of hoping Metroid can recover from Other M, what we really need is a real Metroid game. Not a spin-off as the only thing we get for the 30th anniversary of Metroid."
Metroid,3aucr3,BlockyAnubis,2,Tue Jun 23 18:08:29 2015 UTC,"I think you've realistically hit the main points.   It's a different game, something that people weren't expecting.  And still no metroidvania on the horizon.  Very upsetting to fans, for sure."
Metroid,3aucr3,VoyagerOrchid,2,Wed Jun 24 01:20:47 2015 UTC,"People are giving numerous reasons with arguments as to why that isn't true, yet you keep replying the same copypasta with the same screenshot that proves nothing.

Metroid,3aucr3,GieterHero,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:08:13 2015 UTC,"i think the backlash would still be terrible, considering ive only once or twice heard complaints about the aesthetics but many times heard complaints about the lack of a metroid formula  this is literally going to be a run 'n' gun first person shooter, this has zero metroid in it as far as i've seen  that's why people are mad"

Why? Because the of the Wii U's low install base and the lowered cost of doing a sprite title this would be a low risk option for Nintendo that would have a high profit margin since it avoids a 3rd party retailer.  I'd then also like a big budgeted Prime game released for 3DS. The 3D on the new 3DS is much easier to deal with and I would like to have the chance to play a Prime game in 3d.

On the other hand, the indie market has supplied dozens of fantastic 2D Metroid-style games, and when it comes to Prime-style games (or any 3D games like that, for that matter) the market is much dryer, and in all honesty, I feel Retro did 3D Metroid so well that I'd love to see more.

Metroid,3aus7y,connor_g,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:45:30 2015 UTC,"I absolutely adore Metroid Prime, but I feel like with Metroid Prime 3 and Metroid Prime Hunters and the move to more traditional* FPS controls the gameplay really lost a lot of its charm. If I knew I was going to get a new game like the original Prime I would want that, but given the Wii U gamepad layouts and current market pressures, I have a feeling that a new Prime game would be too FPS-y for my tastes, and in that case I'd prefer a 2D game.  *I know stylus controls or screen-pointing controls are not ""traditional"" FPS controls, but mapping two discrete control inputs to Move and Look respectively creates this feeling, whether those two inputs are dual analog sticks, a mouse and keyboard, or analog stick and pointer."
Metroid,3aus7y,ClockworkPepsi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:28:59 2015 UTC,"I'm a pretty new fan to the series... I've played Super Metroid, Prime 1, and I'm tying up loose ends in Prime 2: Echoes.  While my dream is for a console (hinting at NX here...) Prime 4, I believe the best business decision would be a 2D entry for 3DS. We haven't seen a sidescroller Metroid in years, and the 3DS is such a wildly successful handheld, so there's no doubt in my mind that it'd sell like hotcakes. In terms of a more personal reason, I actually like 2D and Prime almost equally. However, I do think the atmosphere in the 2D titles is sort of better. The Prime games have just as much atmosphere, but it's executed in more of a video -game-esque way, and not so much a cinematic way. The music of the Prime games, for instance, doesn't induce suspense or loneliness as much.  I think Super Metroid was more impactful on me, because it was the first Nintendo game I'd ever played that made me feel legitimately nervous and creeped out by the environment. If Nintendo could do that again, I think everyone would enjoy feeling those thoughts of dread and isolation again."

Metroid,3axybo,editorguy117,14,Wed Jun 24 11:53:28 2015 UTC,Nope had no problem with this. It felt like a classic Metroid game in this sense to me.  Lots of back tracking in Metroid games.

Metroid,3axybo,Leonhart01,11,Wed Jun 24 12:55:00 2015 UTC,The magmoor caverns were basically a giant shortcut as soon as you had the grapple beam.

Metroid,3axybo,txcrnr,0,Wed Jun 24 13:36:25 2015 UTC,Metroid for instance. Metroid Prim   Is walking back and forth for a long time really fun gameplay? :s I guess its just me
Metroid,3axybo,Commkeen,11,Wed Jun 24 15:03:26 2015 UTC,"A well-designed Metroidvania game opens up new routes and shortcuts in such a way that you typically don't have to go back through the EXACT same route you just took.  Ideally you want the player to wind up returning to landmark rooms over and over again (like the tree rooms in the Chozo Ruins or the first room in Phendrana), but each time they return they should have a new powerup that lets them explore a new path.  Most of Prime 1 is built this way, but there are a few parts with tedious backtracking like you mention.  The most glaring example is the Boost Ball/Space Jump/Wave Beam segment, where you have to retrace basically the same route through Magmoor Caverns 3 times in a row.  I imagine this was a product of cut content late in development - concept art shows that Kraid was originally going to be in the game, and Magmoor Caverns would be the logical place to put him (especially since it's the only region in the final game with no bosses).  I'm betting that originally you would have taken an alternate route through Magmoor during this back-and-forth, where you would have fought Kraid."
Metroid,3axybo,bactchan,5,Wed Jun 24 16:15:46 2015 UTC,Sorry to tell you bro but that was a deliberate design choice. Part of what made Metroid stand out in the early days was the nonlinear exploration. So you're complaining about a fundamental aspect of a Metroid title. Perhaps you should go play Other M.
Metroid,3axybo,that_dude_you_know,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:45:53 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with not linear, but tedious long walking doesn't make it more fun. There are plenty other ways to approach non linear."

Metroid,3axybo,citizenofgaia,2,Wed Jun 24 17:19:06 2015 UTC,"I actually felt like Prime 2 and Super Metroid both did a better job of leading you than Prime 1 where major power-ups were concerned, and I think people are misunderstanding your point a little bit as dismissing exploration, which I don't think you're doing.   New power-ups in Prime 1 are often in old areas, while Prime 2 and Super both often had essential items in new areas more often than not. I love backtracking, but I'd rather not backtrack to Tallon Overworld 5 times just to get new power-ups. Fortunately, this changed a lot in later game when you opened up a lot of shortcuts between levels. Each area you'd open would eventually have some kind of shortcut between areas, such as elevators between Phazon Mines and Phendrana, or Magmoor and Phendrana, and other combinations.   Prime 2 I love because the most you backtrack is just going back to Temple Grounds to reach the new area. You will have to backtrack, but rarely for essentials but for Temple Keys and expansions, which is how I prefer it. Prime 1 confused me a bit with a random powerup suddenly necessary to get was hiding out in Tallon Overworld or some random room of Chozo Ruins, I get what you mean."
Metroid,3axybo,Mortimer42,2,Thu Jun 25 14:21:00 2015 UTC,"OP sorta has a point.  In Super, you can basically do Brinstar, Upper Norfair, Wrecked Ship, Brainstar again (for item collection), Maridia, Lower Norfair, Tourian with no real diversions to other areas.  In Prime 2, you mostly stay in the region you're in without an over-abundance of backtracking.  Prime 1 has a lot of backtracking.  It's not the worst because the game tells you where to go, but after a while it gets annoying running through the same rooms in Magmoor tunnels again and again."

Metroid,3aw2u0,ThePhreshKarut,3,Tue Jun 23 23:36:25 2015 UTC,"IMO they both are of similar quality.  I haven't played much of Super Metroid, but I think Nightmare is a high-quality boss.  There is some great buildup to it, and the progression of the fight is nice, too, where it activates heavy gravity and its face melts.  The boss fights in 2D games tend to be faster since you can move around more quickly and jump higher.  3D fights are also slower due to scanning.  But I might agree that they can be more impressive.  Fighting Ridley in Metroid Prime is way cooler than in any of the 2D games, for example."
Metroid,3aw2u0,wetterdew,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:54:08 2015 UTC,"I would think its easy to make a 3D boss too easy, and its easy too make a 2D boss too hard. I a 2d game its hard to get mobility, so dodging attacks is a lot harder in a  2d game, Ie if you have to get around the boss you have to get over it or under it. In a 3d game you could make the boss' attack range very narrow making it easy to avoid, and little strategy to beat.   In a 3d game its very easy not to notice a boss that's too easy, but its easy to notice a boss that's too hard, so we would tend to think of those bosses more when we think of a poorly designed boss."
Metroid,3aw2u0,Denazer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:44:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't really say that 2D Metroid bosses are lazily programmed in comparison to 3D Metroid bosses. I suppose that would depend on your definition of lazy programming; but I would consider that to mean variation of movement/attack patterns, response to the player's positions and attacks, etc... Essentially, non-linearity.   Making a comparison of Super Metroid and Metroid Prime, for example, though I've played the former far more than the latter, I generally found Prime's bosses to feel more linear. Though that may just be the case because they were far easier, leading to less of a chance to see their different variations. Like you said, it's way easier to understand the patterns of Prime's bosses, to the extent that you can pick it up during the course of a single fight and never have to put more thought into it. While that may be more enjoyable at times, from a casual stand point, I find that the the complexities of Super Metroid's bosses (Ridley is the best example) provides a lot of replay value. Trying to find better ways to beat bosses throughout multiple playthroughs adds an entire extra dimension to the games for me."
Metroid,3aw2u0,LongNT,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:26:05 2015 UTC,"The Prime Trilogy easily has the Series' best fights, except maybe Prime 1."
Metroid,3aw2u0,Weltall548,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:19:04 2015 UTC,"The bosses in Fusion took a lot of inspiration from other bosses in Fusion, apart from 3 of them. So I find that in general, the 2D metroid games have more repetitive boss patterns, but they still remain fun and challenging at times. The 3D bosses I think provide a good sense of excitement and challenge and really present a good perspective on each boss, especially the final boss in prime 3 for example."
Metroid,3aw2u0,LuxShadow1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:15:15 2015 UTC,"In 2D there are fewer options for the player at any given time: move left, move right, duck/morphball+bombs, fire, charge shot (if you've even acquired that yet!), missiles/super missiles, jump, and wall jump. That's pretty much it. Shooting is restricted to cardinal directions, as well.  In 3D there are literally 129600 (360*360) different ways to aim, 360 different ways to move, and that's on top of the other options already available. More possibilities for player actions=more ability to test player strategy instead of player skill. So it's easier in 2D to make puzzle fights (i.e. little/no mechanical difficulty, but you have to figure out the trick.) or skill fights (90-100% just dodging/shooting). It's hard to have a fight that has STRATEGY instead of SPECIFIC WAY TO KILL BOSS. So, naturally, 3D bosses are usually better, especially compared to platformers. This isn't true if you're going for full-on action/puzzle, but trying to blend them is a lot harder in 2D."

You could call it, S.C.A.N.N.E.R. Special Concentration Amplifier and Nick Nack Examination Receiver thing.  Kinda stupid, but whatever. :P  3) Instead of having the area completely abandoned upon arrival, you could have 2-4 (More depending on what you want) guys there, have 1 guy working on trying to repair the communication systems (They were damaged in a fairly recent attack by the local wildlife) and 2 guys injured in a nearby tent or building being tended to by the last guy. (Everyone else is stuck or lost in the mines or dead) If you ultimately want the player to be completely alone, you could kill off the rest of guys that are alive with another attack while the player is away searching for other miners. (You could even start building a friendship between the player and one of the living miners that's killed to make the situation a bit more sad)"

Still annoying though. I can't remember exactly how the Ridley fight goes but make sure you're using Plasma charge shots most of the time and maybe some super missiles. Plasma charge beam does a fuckton of damage for it's relatively low cooldown and charge time compared to other weapons. You obviously want to jump over that beam he does when he's on the ground but he also fires off a crapload of seeking missiles in the air at times. It might take a while to find it but there's a certain timing you have to get used to for dashing to avoid them. You don't want to dash to early, but not too late either. From what I've learned from hard mode, make every fucking effort you can to save as much health as possible. In most cases it's important to get out of danger during a time where the enemy is vulnerable than to just trade blows with them."

When he's about to lunge (he raises 1 of his arms back I believe), if you time a super missile when he begins the animation you should cancel out the lunge and stun him.  I'm not sure which version you had but you can really cheap it out by hitting him with the boost ball, I have the PAL Prime version - Gamecube (players choice and original works for me) :P  Good luck, but it's not really hard. Just pay attention to animations and how you can exploit them. Make sure you are scanning as well. Sometimes they can reveal a hint that you might have overlooked (I haven't played in a while though so I cannot remember if these bosses contain any hints)  Omega Pirate is pretty easy, you just have to dodge his attacks (just jump over the shockwaves and keep your distance) and when the normal pirates spawn focus on getting rid of them before you carry on with Omega pirate.  When in doubt, just spam the power beam to find out which windows you can make an opportunity to properly damage them. You know they're getting damage when they flash red when you hit them...  Edit: I just noticed you're playing on the Wii version... you are probably missing the weak spot by an inch due to free aim, perhaps. But nonetheless try the above advice.  Keep at it and you will get it eventually."
Metroid,3at9n3,that_dude_you_know,2,Tue Jun 23 11:12:11 2015 UTC,"you can really cheap it out by hitting him with the boost ball   I read about that --- they fixed it in the Wii version.  I have been using free aim but I have switched to locked aim, hopefully that will help. Thanks for the advice."
Metroid,3at9n3,Jammintk,6,Tue Jun 23 17:10:14 2015 UTC,"In the original (possibly not the trilogy re-release), you could spam missiles really quickly by switching back and forth between the missile button and the beam button. That's pretty much how I beat Meta-Ridley."
Metroid,3at9n3,The_M4G,3,Tue Jun 23 13:57:14 2015 UTC,"That works on Game cube 1.0, but not in Trilogy"
Metroid,3at9n3,Jammintk,2,Tue Jun 23 20:57:26 2015 UTC,"It still kind of works in the trilogy release, but only in three round bursts. Still incredibly useful. Definitely the only prime game where missiles are actually threatening."
Metroid,3at9n3,The_M4G,3,Tue Jun 23 23:25:27 2015 UTC,"If they do another 3d game, I hope that they can make missiles feel powerful. They were trash tier in every prime game if used as intended. Missiles aren't ever really useful until you get Super missiles if you can't do the rapid missile trick or don't know about it. I wouldn't mind having a smaller max stock of missiles if they actually did decent damage."
Metroid,3at9n3,Jammintk,6,Tue Jun 23 23:33:51 2015 UTC,"250 has always been a Metroid tradition, I wouldn't settle for less. But they either need to be rapid-fire dumb firing rockets like the games of olde, or they need to be heat seekers with much higher base damage. They were never worth using."
Metroid,3at9n3,The_M4G,3,Tue Jun 23 23:35:51 2015 UTC,"I think you mean 255, but yes, I don't see them reducing the maximum number of missiles. Maybe have missiles do a little higher damage than the charge beam and have them home in on targets, then when Super missiles are introduced, have them still use 5 missiles, but make them fire as fast as regular missiles."
Metroid,3at9n3,Spudtron98,0,Wed Jun 24 00:44:00 2015 UTC,"Right, 255. Jesus, it's been a while since I played one of these."

Metroid,3at9n3,PointZ3RO,3,Tue Jun 23 10:27:08 2015 UTC,"Meta Ridley had me puzzled for a few hours on my first playthrough. The key is patience, biding your time and knowing exactly when to deal damage. Apart from studying his pattern and learning when exactly he can be damaged, my advice would be to backtrack and collect more missile upgrades if you haven't found all of them already. That way, missing isn't always a ""crap...I'm screwed"" moment, and it becomes a small affordable mistake."
Metroid,3at9n3,flaahgra012,2,Tue Jun 23 10:58:34 2015 UTC,I've got 155 missiles...  hopefully that's enough?
Metroid,3at9n3,hatnscarf,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:51:32 2015 UTC,"The maximum number of missiles you can carry is 250, so it may be worth doing some backtracking to make sure you're well stocked for the fight. Without spoiling too much, you'll want quite a few more missiles for what's ahead. There's tons of guides online on where to find missile expansions, although I personally prefer to find them on my own for that satisfaction of discovery. Good luck! :)"

Metroid,3at9n3,badgeometry,2,Tue Jun 23 14:17:14 2015 UTC,"The super missile thing is an odd problem, are you getting a charged shot instead of super missiles? Try to consciously hold down the b button as you're pressing down on the d-pad, that might fix it.  And if you're having trouble landing hits, try disabling 'free-aim' from the options menu; that ought to help you directly hit those weak points."

Metroid,3at9n3,Jammintk,2,Tue Jun 23 16:48:32 2015 UTC,"They're supposed to be a challenge. Trust me, when I was 14 these bosses were the biggest fucking assholes, aside from my math teacher in school.   The biggest boss I had a problem with was omega pirate, but just as everything else, you just kinda learn to beat them and you move on.   My one tip is that if you want to get meta Ridley on the ground very quick, use the plasma gun. It burns his wings off and he slams on the ground pretty quick. Be warned though, he has more health than if you were to get him down using any other type of beam.   Good luck and don't give up!   I can't wait to hear of your struggles with the next boss ;)"

This is great advice ---- I'm going to avoid the plasma beam at first so he will have less health when he lands. Once he lands is when he really fucks me up."
Metroid,3at9n3,The_M4G,2,Tue Jun 23 19:54:08 2015 UTC,"Meta Ridley wasn't too bad, but Omega Pirate was a HUGE pain in the ass, and it's only because of that stupid energy syphon shield he has and it has the world's biggest fucking hitbox and he keeps calling up those damn Pirate Troopers and it took me 20 minutes to beat him on NORMAL mode.  Fuck that guy.  And let me quickly go on a tangent about the grapple beam. For the most part, it's pretty well implemented for most of the game, but there's a bit in Phendrana's Edge were you have to grapple onto two hooks, one after the other. The window for grappling on to the second hook is SO SMALL that I probably fell something like 8 times before I got to the top. On top of that, there were times where I'd finally grab on to the second hook and suddenly Samus is all 'LET IT GO. LET IT GO. CAN'T HOLD ONTO THIS HOOK ANYMORE' and I'd just fall. I'm so glad they ironed out those kinks in MP2.  I feel better now."
Metroid,3apwl0,Steaktacos,5,Mon Jun 22 15:26:49 2015 UTC,"Metroid 1 is considered to have aged poorly, I feel, to a number of factors: password system (#), 30 energy to start, the sometimes ridiculous amount of firepower it takes to kill enemies, and Metroid: Zero Mission (which fits the series' mythology better).  However, I do agree that Metroid is a very good game that should be played with an open mind.  Metroid 2 is, in my opinion, the worst game in the series (##).  I'm not saying it's a bad game.  It's fun, innovative, expands on the story, and was the first game that showed Samus' classic Varia suit design.  To call Metroid 2 the worst game in the series speaks more to the strength of the series than the weakness of the game.  (#) Fun fact: When Metroid was originally ported to the NES, it was a candidate for a battery backup and saving.  It lost out to Zelda, thus marking the first Metroid got screwed over by Nintendo.

Metroid,3apwl0,Sno_Wolf,8,Tue Jun 23 00:06:18 2015 UTC,"Agree 100%. IMO Metroid 1 is still one of the best games in the series and, as long as you're okay with difficulty, the game holds up remarkably well. The core gameplay mechanics are all still very well functioning. Likewise the combat actually has a lot more skill and depth to it due to the lack of diagonal and crouching--requires much more dodging, retreating, bombing, and tactical use of missiles than later games.  Most importantly though, the lack of an automap totally changes the game. The best part about both is the ability to actually, seriously get lost, coupled with serious consequences for death (lose all your health and progress). Ratchets up the tension tenfold."
Metroid,3apwl0,TheSpaceWhale,6,Mon Jun 22 17:06:37 2015 UTC,"Known Metroid 1 hacker snarblam made either an automap or reverse engineered the FDS version save function (or both), and I can tell you that having a map doesn't help you one bit in Norfair."

Metroid 2 i actually played again recently and I was... Surprised at how good it actually is.

Your post really sparked my interest in getting back into these two games. Too bad my backlog is way too big.  The manual described Samus as a ""he""?"

Metroid,3apwl0,PowerForward,4,Mon Jun 22 18:06:52 2015 UTC,"IMO they are both way too tedious to play, starting with 30 HP and then having to grind your way up to full HP (or finding an energy tank in that game session) isn't fun at all. All of the other things like invisible passages that you just have to know about, and enemies going too low for your arm canon is just annoying.  You can definitely feel that it was an NES game, because games at that time was all about extending the playtime by being difficult and/or tedious. Zero mission is 1000 times better than the original.  Metroid 2 is tedious as well, with the lack of color, similar environments, and lack of map it's boring to look at, so I can't be bothered to play it. I can't wait for the fan remake is 100% done."

And missiles are you're friend."

Metroid,3apwl0,spiralingtides,2,Tue Jun 23 13:57:50 2015 UTC,"That wasn't his chief complaint, which was grinding hp.  But yeah, you could find it tedious if you don't like searching for secret passages. Two things, there are patterns to where many secret paths are, often a floor or a wall is destructible in the same place as other similar looking areas, (this being due to how the game was programmed, but is also a feature of the game.) And there no reason that if you find that part of the game to be boring that you don't just use a map.  He also complained that you can't attack enemies that are too low for your arm cannon, but really you just need to drop a couple of bombs.

Metroid,3apwl0,Snearky,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:01:46 2015 UTC,"Zero Mission is objectively the better game in terms of mechanics, yes the original Metroid has not aged well but it does not age poorly in the sense that it becomes trivial to play or anything like that, just inaccessible to people who are new to the games, I think that's the context people use when it has 'aged poorly' and that there is a more easily accessible remake, along with bonuses.   But yes Metroid 1 and 2 are amazing games and are the reason Metroid is held to such a high standard, due to the evolution it has taken from an already fantastic game."

In retrospect, though, I think I would've liked drawing my own map from the beginning if I had thought to use the screen as a scale. A 2D Metroid game where you use the bottom screen to draw or tile a map would actually be kind of fun, charting the area as you explore it.

I wouldn't say it's aged poorly. I still love it. But between it and Zero Mission, especially for someone new to the series, I'll always recommend ZM. Save the old-school for when you're already a fan of the series and just want to be a completionist and willing to put up with the limitations of the older game(s), not when you're first getting started and it might put you off trying the rest of the series.  M2 though, no idea why people wouldn't recommend it. It's fantastic, even introduced a lot of the mechanics that Super Metroid honed to perfection. Only reason I could see is the lack of a map system, which could be tough for new players to get used to. Back in the day we had Nintendo Power with in-game maps printed over several pages, so it was easy to pick up and figure out where you are and where you needed to go without getting too terribly lost.

Going back to the original Metroid, it definitely isn't hard in terms of bosses and enemies, but the controls and physics haven't aged well at all imo, especially in comparison to Metroid II (adding crouch) and Super Metroid (adding everything else). Also, saving through the password method was eh, especially since the NA version of Zelda had save slots. Think the European or Japanese versions of Metroid did too.

I am not asking for a glowing indication, but puts some cracks on the wall or something. I know they can texture breakable objects differently because they had a small bit early on and never used those blocks again.  Metroid 2 was just bland. The 'music' bleeps and boops were annoying and I turned the sound off. The aesthetic bored me and made it difficult to differentiate areas well. I enjoyed fighting the Metroids and the thrill of hunting them. Save stations and refill stations were a bit to far in between for my liking.

If you're looking to change things up a bit, Prime 1 (and subsequently the rest of the Prime series) is/are the game(s) to play. I would stay away from the original Metroid for now because that game is incredibly difficult imo but if you're up for a challenge, suit up.

Metroid,3arjfv,The_M4G,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:07:20 2015 UTC,Yes.  Here's a link  to a few of them.
Metroid,3aqfx6,UneggspectedGaming,24,Mon Jun 22 17:52:06 2015 UTC,That big spider thing from fusion was really difficult when I was younger.   That and spider ball guardian in Ehoes.
Metroid,3aqfx6,Brony_Jim,9,Mon Jun 22 18:41:29 2015 UTC,when I was younger.   This. When I was 10 I couldn't beat that thing for the life of me. I go back nowadays after not playing it for many years and I kill it first try. Same with Nightmare.
Metroid,3aqfx6,kenzy_5g,3,Mon Jun 22 19:50:37 2015 UTC,"Ok I'm stuck on the spider currently, what's the trick? If he catches me even once, I'm screwed."
Metroid,3aqfx6,kaijudrifting,4,Tue Jun 23 00:36:30 2015 UTC,"hoeveel how many energy tanks do you have?   Go morphball in a corner. If he picks you up, spam left and right to ""wiggle"" out of his grasp.   the hardest part is at the end when he's red and space jumps around. Use your charge beam whenever you can and just missile spam.  edit: random dutch snuck in there."
Metroid,3aqfx6,kenzy_5g,2,Tue Jun 23 00:38:48 2015 UTC,The charge beam is important. I'm pretty sure it does much more damage than a missile and you obviously never run out of them.
Metroid,3aqfx6,synthieval,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:29:54 2015 UTC,Beam in Fusion can hit enemies multiple times as it spreads out. Ridley is the most noticeable for this
Metroid,3aqfx6,leshpack,16,Thu Jun 25 02:48:03 2015 UTC,"if the metroids and metroid queen count, then Other M. Metroids because they were fast, aggressive and damaging-- legitimately great. Metroid Queen because how the hell was I supposed to know I'd gotten power bomb?!"
Metroid,3aqfx6,PhazonZim,11,Mon Jun 22 17:58:56 2015 UTC,I'm ashamed to say I haven't played Other M all the way through buy I'd like to. The Zeta Metroids in Metroid II were always pretty tough for me as far as Metroid go.
Metroid,3aqfx6,leshpack,3,Mon Jun 22 18:20:25 2015 UTC,"I'd give it a go. So many people hate it here for so few reasons. I personally enjoyed the story a lot. Some of the decisions to do with Samus' personality were a bit odd but didn't detract from the game as much as most people seem to think. The story was very interesting and added a lot of depth to the game, and the gameplay was pretty fantastic: on par with the best side scrolling Metroids in my opinion.   Just play it through sometime. It's still a Metroid game, and to be honest a pretty true one."
Metroid,3aqfx6,Laughing_Luna,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:50:19 2015 UTC,Awesome! Yeah I've seen some reviews that say that the game is way underrated. I'm playing through Super Metroid right now but Other M will definitely be my next now. Thanks!

Metroid,3aqfx6,txcrnr,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:50:27 2015 UTC,I suggest reading this and watching this and this.  I suggest watching the videos first then read the really long review when you have a couple hours.
Metroid,3aqfx6,Tagrineth,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:38:41 2015 UTC,I have and I played the game too. I hate it and it is an educated opinion.
Metroid,3aqfx6,hsxp,4,Tue Jun 23 17:40:40 2015 UTC,"Even worse, theres a huge bug in Other where sometimes the event flag that gives you power bombs doesnt flag properly. When i did this sequence i guessed power bomb on maybe my 2nd try and it didnt work. Two hours of frustration later i Google searched and found this out.  If it happens you have to reload your last save file because respawning wont go back far enough to reset the event flag."
Metroid,3aqfx6,kotb,8,Tue Jun 23 00:31:40 2015 UTC,Metroid Queen... Until I figured out she didn't like her insides blown up. Then Mother Brain.
Metroid,3aqfx6,Kimihro,8,Mon Jun 22 18:00:52 2015 UTC,"Same for me. I figured out that you can screw attack the fireballs, suck up the damage from the first neck jab attack, and absolutely spam missiles to stun her when she tries to bite. Actually makes for a pretty easy fight in my opinion!"
Metroid,3aqfx6,KelticKnight,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:12:09 2015 UTC,"The first time I fought the queen, I only launched two missiles immediately after the two bite attempts. I had no clue that she would get stunned, so I kept avoiding all the time. It took me about an hour to hit the queen with ~200 missiles. Needless to say, it trained me for the much longer boss fights in later games..."
Metroid,3aqfx6,ShiKage,6,Tue Jul 14 00:50:09 2015 UTC,The only boss that truly gave me a lot of trouble was the NES Mother Brain.  I tried it without save states and I think I hit 32 tries running through Tourian and still having the resources to get through that fight without having to farm.
Metroid,3aqfx6,Hopper2004,6,Mon Jun 22 21:20:56 2015 UTC,Played all the Metroids and only one boss still gives me trouble...Boost Guardian in Hard Mode. All the 2D bosses were easy once I got the pattern down. Mogenar gave me difficulty before I learned to aim. But every...single...time...B.G. I hate that boss.
Metroid,3aqfx6,henryuuk,5,Mon Jun 22 22:13:58 2015 UTC,"Between all of the final bosses? I would say Metroid Prime. Getting there alone is hell. Fission Metroids give me nightmares... The actual boss battle is a little more difficult than other games as well, I feel, as the need to constantly switch weapons while taking care of projectiles it sheds is a little more stress inducing than the other final bosses.  Between strictly those two, though, Metroid Queen, I think."
Metroid,3aqfx6,Xrmy,3,Mon Jun 22 23:21:17 2015 UTC,SA-X in Fusion. That second form is killer. I had to cheat to beat it the first time. I'm ashamed of this.
Metroid,3aqfx6,synthieval,6,Mon Jun 22 21:35:14 2015 UTC,Pretty sure almost everyone beats SA-hornoad by standing on that one spot it can't reach and hitting it then.    It's not like the actual fight is very engaging if you beat it 'right' anyway.
Metroid,3aqfx6,kenzy_5g,2,Mon Jun 22 22:29:07 2015 UTC,As someone who beat 7 of the games in the last year....this wins for me for sure.
Metroid,3aqfx6,Hopper2004,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:19:26 2015 UTC,The second form? I thought the first form was wasaayyyy harder than the second and the second was a joke. Are we thinking of the same thing?
Metroid,3aqfx6,leshpack,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:31:49 2015 UTC,Yeah that second form was stupidly easy. Not sure what he was talking about.
Metroid,3aqfx6,MorphaKnight,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:36:35 2015 UTC,"Oh crap you're right, I meant the first form. Though the second can br tough with how little you have afterwards."
Metroid,3aqfx6,leshpack,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:35:16 2015 UTC,"Na the first form is easy! You just get into a loop of charging up a beam, shooting, jumping over the SA-X, and going again. Only lasts a few shots."
Metroid,3aqfx6,Gyper,3,Thu Jun 25 02:52:03 2015 UTC,Metroid Queen for me. Try firing 200 missiles at her face one at a time and avoiding lunging at you with the space jump. It's only decades now thanks to the internet that I figured you could go inside her..   Then again metroid 2 has always been confusing me in my childhood. It took me 2 weeks to figure out why I couldn't kill the first metroid you meet. I didn't know the select button was used to fire missiles.
Metroid,3aqfx6,SarcasticRidley,2,Wed Jun 24 10:38:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was playing through the originals recently and I guess the instruction manual is essential. The games tell you literally nothing about anything. Even with knowledge from the recent metroid games, its super hard to know what's going on half the time"
Metroid,3aqfx6,Paticus5295,2,Thu Jun 25 02:54:43 2015 UTC,Mother brain from super metroid ... but if you have only 3 E tanks.
Metroid,3aqfx6,SarcasticRidley,2,Mon Jun 22 19:36:46 2015 UTC,THE FUCKING RHEDOGIAN.  I have never been angry at a videogame before. I almost threw my wiimote through a window because of that thing. I spent almost 80 attempts trying to kill that thing. That fucking thing takes out a whole energy tank every time it hits you. And it's fucking fast too.
Metroid,3aqfx6,Ultrawup,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:20:47 2015 UTC,"lol, which time? You had to fight that fucker, like, 5 times. It was annoying as hell"
Metroid,3aqfx6,LordCharco_iii,2,Mon Jun 22 22:28:40 2015 UTC,EVERY TIME
Metroid,3aqfx6,leshpack,2,Mon Jun 22 22:29:40 2015 UTC,"Somehow, I still find the Hive Mecha in Prime exceptionally difficult (on par with Dark Samus in Echoes, for example), even though it's an early-game minor boss."
Metroid,3aqfx6,Rekwiiem,2,Mon Jun 22 21:11:26 2015 UTC,"I'm probably alone in this, but Mother Brain from Zero Mission pissed me off royally before I noticed the little crevice in the top right corner. And Super Missiles. Totally forgot about the Super Missiles."
Metroid,3aqfx6,Brony_Jim,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:31:34 2015 UTC,"I hated Mother Brain in Zero Mission and Nettori in Fusion. They were actually really boring because the bosses didn't move and required plants/turrets to shoot you from your spot into acid.  The way to beat them is to stand in a spot where the projectiles can't hit you, or fall into a rhythm of shoot, jump, crouch etc. Was just kinda boring compared to the bosses that actually move like Nightmare and Ridley"
Metroid,3aqfx6,Rekwiiem,2,Thu Jun 25 02:53:39 2015 UTC,Emperor Ing final form. The fact that your attacks have ammo and the Dark shot is just garbage for hitting him makes that fight so incredibly frustrating
Metroid,3aqfx6,Brony_Jim,6,Mon Jun 22 19:52:58 2015 UTC,I find it easy to use the super missile version of the annil. beam. That usually kills him pretty fast.
Metroid,3aqfx6,antipode,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:59:23 2015 UTC,True but it burns through ammo of both types and he doesn't give you a chance to replenish all that often.
Metroid,3aqfx6,Rekwiiem,5,Mon Jun 22 20:01:35 2015 UTC,The trick is to not miss! Haha
Metroid,3aqfx6,MmmmDoughnuts21,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:30:40 2015 UTC,"If you want, you can actually take him out in just a couple hits by screw attacking into his belly."
Metroid,3aqfx6,Bungus_King,2,Mon Jun 22 19:56:12 2015 UTC,"I saw that, but I usually try to avoid the gimmicky victory on that one."
Metroid,3aqfx6,LordCharco_iii,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:00:53 2015 UTC,In the original the stakes were higher with the lack of save stations and no full energy when you died. So I was more stressed out with Mother Brain.   But in all the games... I'd have to say the Emperor Ing gave me the most headaches.   I have no idea why but I always run out of ammo and health and oh my goodness I'm getting nervous just thinking about it! D:
Metroid,3ark23,heart-station,13,Mon Jun 22 22:54:02 2015 UTC,For me it's hands down Ellen Ripley from Alien and it works out considering she inspired the creation of Samus' character

Thematically excellent, but a little watered down. Sadly the last 2d Metroid.  Metroid Prime: 9/10. Has aged extremely well. Thoughtful gameplay and an incredible attention to detail, from the sound to the level design to the minor details- how about that water drip on the visor?  Hunters: 7/10. An oddity with a DooM style linear but not linear campaign and a cancerous, cheat-addled multiplayer.   Echoes: 9/10. A little more polarizing, but in my opinion it builds on everything that makes the first prime great. Beautiful and solemn atmosphere complimented by stark, ruined lands and alien hellscapes. Also pretty fucking hard in some places if you're into that. Amazing puzzles.  Corruption: 8/10. A very good game in its own right but a few tiny steps backwards from the first two. Slightly underwhelming after all that buildup, but take it at face value and it's still a fantastic game.  Other M: 2/10: well it uh irreversibly shattered the community and plunged us into a never ending cycle of despair and bad news, and has led to the Metroid community not really being taken seriously anymore ever, and serves as the most poignant example of character assassination in video games in recent memory. So that happened."

However, since you started with the newer games, Super Metroid's controls will probably feel less responsive and a bit annoying.   Fusion and Zero mission are incredible. I'm so jealous of you right now, playing them for the first time. Wish I could go back and experience it for the first time again."

Metroid,3alwik,Satiie,5,Sun Jun 21 17:58:36 2015 UTC,"My favorite trick. Do a spinning jump into a wall. As soon as you touch the wall, press the d-pad away from the wall. At the same time press jump again. You will do a wall jump.  A lot of people disagree with me, but finish Fusion first. It's a shorter game, and a simpler one. It teaches you how to play Metroid without throwing you for the sharks. Zero Mission is tough game, and can be pretty brutal in your first run if it's your first Metroid game. It's also generally a better game than Fusion, and it's nice to save the best for last.  First run, no Metroid experience, playing casually and slowly due to the constant fear of the SA-X, Fusion shouldn't take more than 10 hours max. It can be beat in just a few hours though.   Oh, and lest I forget, if you find yourself in a glass tunnel in Zero Mission, lay a power bomb. Nobody ever tells you this, and you never know to ask, but always power the bomb the glass tunnels in Metroid games. It's tradition."
Metroid,3alwik,spiralingtides,2,Sun Jun 21 15:21:45 2015 UTC,"I actually thought that Fusion was more difficult than Zero Mission. Might just be because I've played that one so many times and not Fusion as much. I will agree with you that Zero Mission is the better game, though (not saying Fusion is bad)."

Metroid,3alwik,joecb91,5,Sun Jun 21 17:28:21 2015 UTC,"Just hearing the SA-X walking around terrified me. The moment when the music dropped out and you just hear: ""clack, clack, clack"" of her boots... and then... nothing. run for your life motherfucker"
Metroid,3alwik,Sharzona,3,Sun Jun 21 17:37:03 2015 UTC,"Both excellent titles.  I would probably finish Fusion first, personally, since I find it easier to go from a railroaded experience to an open one.  If you find that you just don't care for Fusion (though it sounds like that won't be an issue), still try and finish ZM, which is a bit more representative of the series.  If/when you finish both, I HIGHLY recommend Super.  As others have noted, the controls are a bit clunkier, but it's still an amazing study in game design/progression - one that you'll find quite rewarding if you hone the right skills in Zero Mission.  Everything I said for Super goes for Prime 1.  Echoes is less elegant but still great.  Corruption is probably one of the weakest entries, but by no means bad.  I'm gonna go ahead and mention Metroid II as a worthwhile candidate for exploration too, even though no one seems to remember or care about it.  It introduced a lot of stuff that people credit to Super or just plain take for granted.  TL;DR play them all, except Other M."
Metroid,3alwik,Mr_Truttle,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:24:39 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're stuck in Sector 2 right after you get the bombs. I got stuck there the first time until I realized that you can do what's called a Bomb Jump by squatting on your bombs in morph ball. They let you get about 1 tile's worth of height. If you're clever, you can time your bomb drops so that you can jump really high up in the air with sequential bomb jumps."
Metroid,3alwik,iamvishnu,2,Sun Jun 21 15:51:50 2015 UTC,It's worth noting that infinite bomb jumps can be done in Zero Mission but not Fusion.
Metroid,3alwik,Mr_Truttle,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:26:17 2015 UTC,Zero Mission is the first in the time-line and Fusion is at the (current) end of the time-line. I'll let you choose which to finish first with this information.

Now I normally finish the game in about 3 hours, amazing how that happens haha. I'd say finish Fusion first, it's more linear and will teach you how to play a Metroid game - the ins and outs of the series like exploration, attacking different enemies, etc. As others have said, Zero Mission is frequently considered better, so save the best for last.   I really love Fusion though, have fun playing!"
Metroid,3alwik,NightSwipe,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:44:44 2015 UTC,"Play Super and Prime trilogy later.

Metroid,3alwik,kenzy_5g,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:10:41 2015 UTC,"I'd have to recommend Super Metroid next. It's a ton of fun and since you are playing through Zero Mission now, you will have fun seeing some familiar areas in the game. If you want more of a challenge, play Metroid II: Return of Samus. It's not as deep story-wise, but I actually really enjoyed it! There's a remake of it called AM2R in the works now that you could check out, but it's unfortunately not done yet. Anything you choose will be awesome to tell you the truth!"
Metroid,3alwik,UneggspectedGaming,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:50:15 2015 UTC,"I'd say play Zero Mission first but it doesn't matter really. Fusion references to Super, and you're not going to misunderstand the game by playing Fusion first so that's up to you.  You are better off finding tips by yourself, the only one's I would say is to learn to wall jump. When you jump into the wall you have to time it so that as soon as you hit it, you are pressing the d-pad away from the wall as well as the jump button.   Also, shoot/bomb the walls, you might find something you wasn't expecting to be there...  Other than that you can learn on the way, and those above tips aren't needed to really beat the game on normal. Metroid games are pretty easy.  And yeah, the SA-X is one scary fucker. Have fun playing with it!"
Metroid,3alwik,DarkSamus987,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:47:19 2015 UTC,Fusion comes why later in the story (chronologically) so I think it's best to finish zero mission first .to not get all the closure in the store and then go back to the beginning...plus i just think ZM is better
Metroid,3alwik,mrabrickwall,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:34:07 2015 UTC,"Play Fusion first. It was released before ZM, and is easier, shorter, and more linear.  After these two, play Super Metroid. It is quite possibly the best in the series, though the controls take a little getting used to coming from the simplified Zero Mission/Fusion controls.  It's worth it to check out other games in a similar genre or style here's a list of some good ones.   Ori and the Blind Forest (currently 40% off on Steam) (PC/Xbox One) Axiom Verge (PC/PS4) Castlevania: Symphony of the Night (PSX) Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow (GBA) Pretty much any other Castlevania on DS/GBA  Guacamelee! Shadow Complex (Xbox 360 Live Arcade) AM2R (PC, remake of Metroid II. Currently in development/incomplete.)"
Metroid,3alwik,Jammintk,0,Sun Jun 21 21:14:17 2015 UTC,"I would say finish zero mission first, then go download this rom http://www.metroid-database.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=5999 this is metroid 2 return of Samus and it is awesome the rom is a hack that added color which makes it look much better and easier to navigate. Once you're done with it I would recommend super metroid next and then fusion. That will complete the 2d ones and then I would go for the prime series."

Metroid,3and63,o_opc,3,Mon Jun 22 01:42:43 2015 UTC,"This makes so much sense to anyone who has played the metroid prime games, but unfortunately to the average player, it's just a reskin of Samus on the level of edgy pit.

Metroid,3and63,leigonlord,2,Mon Jun 22 09:24:17 2015 UTC,"Not very likely. They put Sylux in the game only to hype up a game 3-4 years down the pipeline is the most logical possibility. But that game will appear on a different console so it's quite a confusing matter. No other characters as of now are important other than Ridley or Dark Samus both of which are in the game as a stage boss and assist trophy respectively.  Also, they would probably save up characters since NX will release in like 2-3 years. Another idea is that Sakurai will only do one character for the smash poll. Metroid won't get anything in smash in order to just appease the Metroid fanbase. One character for a year develpoment before NX releases the year after. That will be the last DLC character since Nintendo will probably start working on the next Smash to hype up the NX... They always release a Smash, Mario Kart, Mario, etc. as launch games. So expect the last of DLC for any game to come in 2016."

Metroid,3al0pu,Bind0fGod,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:13:04 2015 UTC,"I have watched all the treehouses for this game. I think it looks surprisingly sharp for what it is. Keep in mind this is an online game and that means cuts to the visuals. But I really like the subtle lighting effects on the arm cannons. I also think this game is a lot clearer than hunters and even though it has a very specific art-style, it looks less muddy."
Metroid,3al0pu,DarkSamus987,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:14:01 2015 UTC,The music in Federation Force's trailer is so bad.
Metroid,3al0pu,call_me_canvas,-4,Sun Jun 21 13:05:17 2015 UTC,"Interesting, a lot of people were unhappy with the graphics of Star Fox Zero, saying it looked like Gamecube graphics. I think that game looks great on the Wii U, but anyway its funny how with this game everyone was so infuriated simply by its existence that the fact it looks the same as Hunters is completely unimportant"
Metroid,3al0pu,pemricht,5,Sun Jun 21 07:00:29 2015 UTC,"It looks very little like hunters. FF has taken a super-deformed ""chibi"" art style that is overly cute and clashes with the series aesthetic. Hunters also had a much darker and more muted color palate that aided the story theming."
Metroid,3al0pu,call_me_canvas,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:47:00 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, returned to downvotes.. I don't necessarily mean the character models, they obviously look different, the HUD and first person elements look pretty similar to me. But yeah I agree the environments and colours are different."

Metroid,3al0pu,call_me_canvas,2,Sun Jun 21 11:04:41 2015 UTC,"What I was trying to say is that side by side, two games with a really similar style (ie Metroid/Sci-Fi FPS) graphically look the same even though one is on a DS and the other is on 3DS.  I thought it was funny how because people were so annoyed with FF as a whole that the graphics weren't even a complaint, whereas with Star Fox Zero, peoples main complaints were the graphics looking like GameCube quality. Also I don't get your lightning in a bottle comment?"
Metroid,3aozv4,LuxShadow1,12,Mon Jun 22 09:23:51 2015 UTC,"What I don't get is why so many people say the game looks good. Leaving aside the cartoony / chibi artstyle, the gane just has horrible textures. The trailer for the most part looks like they polished the visuals of Hunters a bit and called it a day.  And yeah, I know it's a trailer for an unfinsihed game, but I doubt they would overhaul the entire thing. I mean come on, even for a 3DS game we have seen so much better from non-triple A developers."
Metroid,3aozv4,Mortimer42,6,Mon Jun 22 09:37:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe the gameplay style makes it hard to look as good as Animal Crossing: New Leaf, but Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate still managed to make its monsters look nice on the N3DS.  Even if objectively looking at the cartoony/chibi aesthetic, it doesn't look that great. Bravely Default, AC:NL, Fire Emblem: Awakening, Phoenix Wright: Dual Destinies, those games have great aesthetics. Federation Force? Far from the system's bests."
Metroid,3aozv4,Rimas_LXBYA,2,Mon Jun 22 12:14:32 2015 UTC,I think that's also why the game is getting a large slice of bile. After all with the release of the new 3DS one of the first big name titles that gets announced has the visuals that would look passable for a 10 dollar E-store download.

Because it doesn't."
Metroid,3aozv4,The_M4G,5,Mon Jun 22 14:00:20 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say the fallout of this is as bad as after Other M. That shit was bananas. The only thing that is really just dumb is the petition to get the game canceled, that is one aspect that is getting people nowhere.   I do think the apologists are worse. Because there is simply such a jarring shift in both tone and gameplay. It makes it impossible for this game to come out on top, even if the mechanics are good. And yes I know people go ""But it's a spin off!"" but even that is of questionable status after the creator said it ties into the main story.   Personally I'm just puzzled why did not make another 2D entry. Nintendo is well known for platformers, and people would have been over the moon if that's what they had given us."
Metroid,3aozv4,Mortimer42,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:27:51 2015 UTC,"It's not even a bad concept for a spinoff. I've actually always kind of wanted a co op spinoff that puts you in a fed squad in the vein of colonial marines, except better. This game just looks BAD."

Metroid,3aozv4,Zero-Striker,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:18:12 2015 UTC,"After reading all the interviews with the director and watching the treehouse segments... I am 100% sold on this game. It is made by the same mind that made the other Prime games and he has been thinking of making this game for almost a decade. I think the graphics are beautiful personally. I am very excited to buy this. It sounds like Metroid, people who played it say it feels like Metroid Prime... and To me it looks like Metroid Prime.  And besides all of that, it just looks fun. I mean before all of this I always heard yammerings for a co-op Metroid game.  And on the topic of the game-mode BlastBall. It is an EXTRA feature designed to familiarize new players with the controls of the game. It is extra content. Not the base game. Everyone hates tutorials and for once a dev does something to spice it up and everyone blows up.  I wouldn't mind people not liking this game, but it seems they watched half the trailer and made a snap-judgment. I have really looked into this game and the minds behind it really know what they are doing.  I will buy this."
Metroid,3akib6,TheBenjay,20,Sun Jun 21 02:25:01 2015 UTC,"On a side note, I love the data logs in prime when the space pirates are trying to copy Samus' morph ball. It's hilarious how badly they fail."

Metroid,3ajt02,raspberrykraken,2,Sun Jun 21 15:13:03 2015 UTC,It depends on how soon I'm able to give it all the functionality it needs. I'd also like to make a campaign myself but that likely won't be in the initial release. I still need to do a lot of work before even basic editor features are done. I'm thinking about releasing it commercially if it ends up being good enough and I'm able to make a campaign. If this were the case the campaign would be the main feature and the editor would be a bonus. I'd probably still release the editor for free. (Don't quote me on that.)

Metroid,3ah14v,Non-Polar,20,Sat Jun 20 02:40:18 2015 UTC,"Ah, nothing like the first experience. Super Metroid is one of those games that just isn't good for nostalgic reasons, but actually stands the test of time because it's legitimately well made, and atmospheric. Enjoy."
Metroid,3ah14v,FullOfFailure,20,Sat Jun 20 11:36:11 2015 UTC,This sub is full of fans of the Prime games. I think i'm one of few that genuinely believes the Super Metroid is the best game in the series.
Metroid,3ah14v,Andman17,5,Sat Jun 20 21:26:30 2015 UTC,"No, I think Super's better, and I even played prime first. That's not to say Prime isn't good, it's fantastic. There's just something amazing about super that's hard to describe."
Metroid,3ah14v,randomtroubledmind,3,Sat Jun 20 23:20:25 2015 UTC,I played Super first back when it came out. The big thing that killed Prime for me was the controls.
Metroid,3ah14v,Andman17,3,Sun Jun 21 04:39:55 2015 UTC,"You should try Prime Trilogy, it's $20 on Wii U, and the controls were changed to the pointer on the Wii remote."
Metroid,3ah14v,TheBenjay,3,Sun Jun 21 13:44:35 2015 UTC,I have it for Wii. Makes a world of difference. But that does not excuse the original.
Metroid,3ah14v,Andman17,2,Sun Jun 21 15:18:40 2015 UTC,"The Wii controls in prime make it so much better. As far as I'm concerned, Prime Trilogy is the definitive version."
Metroid,3ah14v,randomtroubledmind,3,Sun Jun 21 17:21:28 2015 UTC,I for one hate the Motion Control. Thats why I think Metroid Prime 1+2 are far superior to Prime 3.  Especially when talking about the difficulty level. That Hypermode was just lazy and a bad attempt to encourage people to go exploring the enviroment by lowering the threat that every enemy posess.  I admit that the Chozo spirits a pain in the *** but thats one part of a hostile enviroment.
Metroid,3ah14v,Shivalah,3,Mon Jun 22 09:23:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think I'll ever understand that. I thought the motion controls were great and actually made things better. Did you make sure you selected ""advanced"" in the motion control options? It makes it much better.   As for hypermode, I used it as sparingly as possible. I don't like the idea of wasting energy."
Metroid,3ah14v,randomtroubledmind,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:27:51 2015 UTC,"Wait, what? ""Advanced"" motion control options? What does it change?   (I just borrowed a Wii from a friend a bought a used copy for 5€ from ebay, so I didn't changed any settings of his Wii. PS: His Motion-controller has this motion-control-plus addon-thingy, does this improve the gameplay of MP3?)"
Metroid,3ah14v,Shivalah,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:15:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it ups the gains a bit on the pan and tilt when you move the cursor, but more importantly, it removes the deadzone from the middle of the screen, so every little movement makes your view change a bit. It sounds bad, but it's actually much better. It of course makes little difference in combat as you're locked on, but it makes looking around and turning soooooooo much better. I encourage you to give it a try.   See this post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/2tv9qx/psa_metroid_prime_trilogy_use_advanced_controls/  And no, wii motion plus is not needed nor useful for the prime games. I think the gyro is bad for pointing purposes in general (See Zelda Skyward Sword vs Twilight Princess). The IR sensor is much better suited for that. It pisses me off that the metroid game in nintendoland opted for the gyro (err, wiimotion plus) over the IR pointer. Guess that was to push more of the expensive accessories. Still, the IR sensor is inherently closed loop. The gyro on the other hand acts as an imu and is prone to integration errors.   EDIT: Also remember to swap A and B, so that the B button (trigger) fires the gun. Should have been that way from the start."
Metroid,3ah14v,randomtroubledmind,2,Wed Jun 24 23:21:05 2015 UTC,"Hey Bro, me again ;-)  I am now a owner of a WiiU after missing the Wii, and bought the 20€ Metroid Prime Trilogy (best deal ever!) and tried it out, with the ""real"" lock-on-feature its now not a pain in the ass anymore. I still think the Prime 1+2 controls are superior but now its at least ""playable"" in my opinion."
Metroid,3ah14v,Shivalah,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:35:46 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean by ""real lock on"" but if it's working for you, great! Make sure you use advanced motion and swap A and B. You may find you really like the controls once you're used to it."

Metroid,3ah14v,Shivalah,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:28:05 2015 UTC,"I dislike the controls of it, felt really clunky, if I could play the game with a mouse and keyboard set-up, I would. Even on an emulator it has the console controls."
Metroid,3ah14v,Red-Blue-,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:40:53 2015 UTC,"You can set up kb/m controls for the Prime trilogy by doing an emulated Wii remote. Works pretty good, the only problem I've run into is the reticule doesn't lock to center-screen like a normal FPS, so it does take a bit of getting used to. But once you do, it's quite nice.  [edit]Actually been considering dumping the textures and making some new button textures to match my keyboard/mouse layout. After a few sessions I've memorized them, but it's still handy to have for the occasional brain fart and trying to remember I've mapped Q to the - button and E to the + button, for example."
Metroid,3ah14v,8bitcerberus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:41:40 2015 UTC,"The turn speed feels very slow. I need to drag the courser to the edge, and wait a few seconds for it to turn. I haven't looked into it much, maybe there's a way to get proper m+kb controls."
Metroid,3ah14v,Red-Blue-,2,Tue Jun 23 01:43:34 2015 UTC,"Set the sensitivity to advanced and turn off HUD lag. It starts turning pretty much immediately, speeding up the closer to the edge of the screen you get, more subtle the closer to the center of the screen your reticule is.  Which is where it takes a bit getting used to from a typical FPS, because when you stop moving the mouse, you're still turning. You have to course correct and move the mouse back to center. Been looking for a way to have this automatically happen when you stop moving the mouse, or an Action Replay or patch code in Dolphin to lock the reticule to the center of the screen. Haven't found anything yet, but surely there's got to be something out there.  Setting the IR movement to ""Cursor+/-"" does cause it to jump back to center, but it does so while you're moving the mouse, which causes stuttery movement and makes it basically impossible to select weapons/visors, or anything in the title screen/menu. ""Axis+/-"" is what's needed for proper movement."

Got 99~% (I was missing literally 2 missile packs) last time quite some time ago, no guide. Going for the full 100% this time!  Also, a tip, if you don't mind one: Any time you get a new item, check around the area to see if it might be useful! Until you get the scanner, it's a big guessing game, but man is it rewording to drop a super bomb on a hunch and find a secret."

This was made with nothing, but photoshop and BrawlBox. No Blender, Maya, MMD, XNAlara, etc. There are no shadows or true glowing effect because of it. I dislike how smoke in the background turned out, but oh well. I used SSBB Ridley model for Ridley to be more accurate, then just stretched it to look a lot thinner and more creepy when compared to Brawl Ridley and fixed eyes. And the corpse is, of course, Samus' mother. I used Fusion and the manga as a base for the design. Because she never had a model, i had to make one by myself. I used SSB4 ZSS model (hair) and Madeline Bergman model (everything else). I do remember that she died from getting shot by Ridley, but i like it more this way.

Metroid,3aiv3j,MonochromeTyrant,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:56:46 2015 UTC,"I mean, when they showed it at the NWC that's exactly what I thought Blast Ball was. And that part probably was. And at some point they might have had these two game concepts and saw they could merge them maybe. I dunno. The Federation Force part of the game just looks so... uninteresting. Like even compared to the Triforce Heroes game, it feels like it lacks a lot of depth and polish. But maybe it'll change over time."
Metroid,3ah4av,XxXGodXxX,16,Sat Jun 20 03:15:03 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you wish to accomplish in Prime. If you simply want to have a fun and enjoyable experience, avoid two crash bugs, and like motion controls, then Trilogy Prime is for you. However if you are like me and love to exploit glitches (and possibly speed run) and wish to play on the original system, then GC Prime is for you.  TL;DR Both are awesome. You can't go wrong with either =)"
Metroid,3ah4av,KelticKnight,11,Sat Jun 20 03:41:30 2015 UTC,"I personally have the trilogy and I much prefer it over the originals on GameCube. The trilogy has 16x9 widescreen support which the original doesn't and I enjoy the Wii remote controls by far. The real difference is that the trilogy is hard to find at a reasonable price but considering it's now on the eshop, if you've got a WiiU then it looks like a no brainer to me"
Metroid,3ah4av,luemasify,8,Sat Jun 20 03:33:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as much as I remember loving my original playthrough of Prime on GC, I go back now and wonder how I ever liked the controls. It feels wonky. Maybe Prime 3 spoiled me. All I know is that the Metroid Prime trilogy is the only series released for the Wii / Wii U where I legitimately enjoy the motion controls over a regular gamepad."
Metroid,3ah4av,wirer,3,Sat Jun 20 04:08:17 2015 UTC,I agree the motion controls for prime 3 on the highest sensitivity were amazingly smooth and made the game far more enjoyable to play. Prime 3 and Skyward Sword imo were the only Wii games that felt even better with motion controls and not just some gimmick forced upon you
Metroid,3ah4av,luemasify,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:25:59 2015 UTC,"Red Steel 2 was amazing too, Pikmin 3, Mario Kart...."
Metroid,3ah4av,xooxanthellae,2,Sat Jun 20 17:03:18 2015 UTC,It seems everyone loves the new motion controls for the trilogy. Does trilogy have any content that the originals didn't or the opposite things that didn't return?
Metroid,3ah4av,luemasify,3,Sat Jun 20 04:39:13 2015 UTC,If I remember correctly there's achievements for each game and the management system for that is unified in the game menu. There's an online feature that's basically negligible because you need to have a friend with the trilogy as well and the wii internet service got discontinued a while back. You can also play the Echoes multiplayer mode but overall there isn't much extra content on disc (the extra content came in the form of the artbook etc. that came with the physical copy)
Metroid,3ah4av,hsxp,2,Sat Jun 20 06:22:42 2015 UTC,They lowered the difficulty. Play on Veteran if you want the original difficulty level.
Metroid,3ah4av,henryuuk,5,Sat Jun 20 05:08:14 2015 UTC,Didn't they also remove some sequence breaking options?

Metroid,3ah4av,TheBenjay,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:35:56 2015 UTC,"Also know that the motion controls change some of the way some parts of Prime 1 and 2 work, especially with some of the Morph Ball puzzles. To make the Trilogy versions work like the GC versions, I would suggest turning off the Lock-on Free Aim setting and not using the shake to jump feature in Morph Ball mode."
Metroid,3ah4av,SarcasticRidley,2,Mon Jun 22 03:36:41 2015 UTC,"I know that they fixed glitches in all the games, and made the load times faster in all games (Prime 3 is still really long though)"

Metroid,3ah4av,Zarantyr,4,Sat Jun 20 20:04:13 2015 UTC,"The Trilogy is on the Wii U eshop for only $20 -- fantastic deal. I really like motion control aiming, I think it adds to the immersion. I'm 80% done with Prime 1 and it's been great."
Metroid,3ah4av,Judedeath,3,Sat Jun 20 06:13:02 2015 UTC,huh. ive always liked the gamecube controls. then again ive never really played prime very much on the wii. ive owned the trilogy for awhile and ive hardly touched it. it looks like i should give it a try?
Metroid,3ah4av,Zarantyr,3,Sat Jun 20 11:55:22 2015 UTC,"I would suggest trying the wii controls for a few hours at least(which is how long it took to click for me. One suggestion I can make to possibly help you like it is to switch Lock On Free Aim or whatever that control is called to off, I found that really helped me as it switches from the Prime 3 style locking the camera to an enemy but you still need to aim to Prime 1 style lock camera and aim onto an enemy. It feels way more like you're playing the original Primes on GCN IMO."
Metroid,3ah4av,joecb91,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:46:59 2015 UTC,"alright thanks, ill have to try it out"
Metroid,3ah4av,fpiceail,2,Sat Jun 20 19:38:28 2015 UTC,"I loved using the Wii controls.  I was bugged by a couple of the little changes in Prime. The water effects weren't there and neither were the effects when you charged your beam. Also a couple of logbook changes. But those were all minor enough for me to overlook them.  I knew about the speedrunning thing, but I never did that so it isn't a big deal to me.  Having the real Flaahgra theme was nice too instead of the first 10 seconds on an endless loop."
Metroid,3ah4av,QuantumWings,3,Sat Jun 20 20:07:20 2015 UTC,"A lot of the Trilogy changes are actually from the original Gamecube PAL version, including the Flaahgra theme. The graphics changes were from the Wii, though.  It's really odd reading about the differences between the NTSC and PAL releases. There are obvious things like scan dashing being removed (breaking a lot of sequence breaking), but then there are stranger changes.... Remember the first time you saw a Hunter Metroid? On the NTSC version it was in Phendrana Drifts in one of the ice caves when heading to the gravity suit...that one's removed on the PAL version and probably the Trilogy version."
Metroid,3ah4av,xooxanthellae,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:40:21 2015 UTC,The motion controls in the Wii version are amazing and help suck you into the world. Also I heared that the trilogy can be gotten off the WiiU online store for less than $40.

Metroid,3ah4av,DarkSamus987,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:18:29 2015 UTC,"One thing that the Trilogy version of Prime 2 has over the original GameCube version is lower difficulty. The GameCube version of the game can get ungodly difficult at some points, and those parts were somewhat fixed for the Trilogy release. The Trilogy version is still pretty challenging, just nowhere near as hard as the GameCube version"

It was one of my most played fighters, dunno why, she seemed so badass. I thought she was a guy though. So when my cousin told me Samus was a girl, I was mindblown. xD"
Metroid,3adyjz,TSTUMPMAN,32,Fri Jun 19 10:10:39 2015 UTC,"The GBA metroid games are both incredible.  You can't go wrong with either one.  If you care, Zero Mission is chronologically first in the series and is a remake of the original NES game ( which...I actually don't recommend playing besides to satisfy your curiosity ).  All 2D metroid games are good though, the GBC one was my first foray into the series."
Metroid,3adyjz,TSTUMPMAN,12,Fri Jun 19 10:14:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I think I'm going with Zero Mission then. Is Super Metroid that good? Just wondering :o  Also, where do you save? And how do you get health quicker? I mean I only have 12% of energy and the enemies are somehow screwing me. Especially that one that shoots at you and you see electricity when you're hit. >m<"
Metroid,3adyjz,zombiegamer723,21,Fri Jun 19 10:17:13 2015 UTC,"Super Metroid is fantastic.  It's my favorite one to speed run.  And I personally like a mod for it that emulates the GBA control scheme.  In Metroid Prime, there are save stations that refill health, just use Z to check your map and go to rooms you haven't explored yet.  They're relatively sparse, but never too far away."
Metroid,3adyjz,owenator1234,5,Fri Jun 19 10:21:43 2015 UTC,"They're relatively sparse, but never too far away.   Except for the Phazon Mines.   But if you can figure out how to kill each Space Pirate really quickly (Super Missile for the Charge Beam pirates, etc.), and have a lot of missiles, it's not too bad. I actually had more trouble with Thardus than I did with the Phazon Mines gauntlet."
Metroid,3adyjz,Koog330,3,Fri Jun 19 18:16:32 2015 UTC,"I have a theory that in Phazon mines, they deliberately put save points super far away to stress players out. That combined with the incredible soundtrack just makes the mines an atmospheric nightmare.  EDIT: I also finished the first Phazon Mines section with ~20 HP. I had about 6 or 7 energy tanks that I burned through, and that's about a 2-hour stretch."
Metroid,3adyjz,Zankou55,18,Sun Jun 21 02:03:11 2015 UTC,"Super Metroid is exceptional. It's widely regarded as one of the most influential games of all time, and it doesn't disappoint.  You can save in Metroid Prime at designated Save Stations that you'll come across (marked by an ""S"" on your map) which refill health in addition to saving. Alternatively, hitting most boxes with a charge beam will usually yield at least a little hp."
Metroid,3adyjz,GoldenBoy25,26,Fri Jun 19 12:24:24 2015 UTC,"Zero Mission is the first game chronologically and the best game  in the series, but I think you should play them in this order.  Super Metroid, Metroid Fusion, Zero Mission.  Here's why:  Super Metroid is the hardest of the three to control, since it was made first.  Going from Zero Mission to Super Metroid is going to frustrate you, at least a little bit, and ruin the superb experience of Super Metroid.  Fusion was the next game, and improves on the controls, but is vastly inferior to the other two because of its linear storyline (still a better love story than Twilight and a great game).  Zero Mission's story is set before Super Metroid and Metroid II: The Return of Samus, but it was made last and it's framed as post-Fusion Samus telling her origin story, her ""Zero Mission"" and should be the pinnacle of your Metroid experience.  It is, however, far too short, and you are going to be left with a hole in your heart that can never be filled, just like the rest of us.    Then, and only then, in the darkness and despair of the post-Metroid drought, should you turn to Metroid II: The Return of Samus, because I heard it's really hard, with no map and awkward controls.  Also no colour.  There's a fan remake being done in the style of Super Metroid,  and I'm really excited to play it when it's done and when I can play Zero Mission again on the Wii U VC.  Just my two cents."
Metroid,3adyjz,Zankou55,8,Fri Jun 19 13:19:14 2015 UTC,"Totally agree.  I think it makes sense to experience Zebes through Super Metroid first rather than ZM, too."
Metroid,3adyjz,CKZeni,11,Fri Jun 19 13:52:13 2015 UTC,"That's the way a generation of young gamers experienced it.  Even though Metroid cam first, it didn't do Zebes justice the way Super Metroid did, and then Zero Mission is a callback to Super Metroid more than a call back to Metroid.  So it might seem counter-intuitive, but playing them out of order really makes the mystery and awe of Zero Mission that much better.  You get a double dose of nostalgia that way."
Metroid,3adyjz,billyboy5050,6,Fri Jun 19 14:07:21 2015 UTC,I absolutely agree with this train of thought.  Super Metroid > Fusion > Zero Mission.
Metroid,3adyjz,jsau0125,5,Fri Jun 19 15:35:30 2015 UTC,"Metroid II was my first Metroid game, never even heard of the series before, I got it from a yard sale with no box no manual there wasn't even a sticker on the front, it was just included in a box of random games. You're right about there being pretty much no help along the way but wrong that people should avoid it. It's amazing and a very good example of why metroidvania games are so enjoyable. I never see it get any love though, even with the adorable Metroid that thinks Samus is its mom."
Metroid,3adyjz,Zankou55,3,Fri Jun 19 15:33:24 2015 UTC,"I played original metroid on the nes way back in the day, I was 10, the snes hadn't come out yet. I couldn't get anywhere without getting hopelessly lost back then. Got a game boy when I was 11 and got metroid 2 sometime after that. I loved that game so much, it was the first metroid I actually beat by myself with no guide or help. I was fighting the queen with only 200 missiles and lost so many times it's ridiculous. My first completion time was like 12 hours or something. It will always hold a special place in my heart. I just replayed it last week in my first ever attempt at a speed run, got 3.40 or some such which is great because I've never finished in less than 6. So now I'm just looking for what to shave off to get it under 3 and that is all I want.   TL;DR much love from me to metroid 2"

Prime and Super are two of the best games ever.  But I think starting to Zero Mission is a great idea.  It will give you a sense of the origins of the Metroid story.

Pretty much the most intense experience I had with gaming when I was a kid. That and A Link To The Past's dungeons' soundtrack."
Metroid,3adyjz,Templer_90,5,Fri Jun 19 20:32:06 2015 UTC,"the original NES game ( which...I actually don't recommend playing besides to satisfy your curiosity   Seconded, unless you hate yourself or like balls to the wall challenging difficult old games."
Metroid,3adyjz,Templer_90,6,Fri Jun 19 18:47:30 2015 UTC,"I, personly, would recomend ""Metroid: Zero Mission"". Others would say ""Super Metroid"". Chose one then play the other. After that play ""Metroid Fusion""."
Metroid,3adyjz,jaamfan,2,Sat Jun 20 16:01:56 2015 UTC,I'm going for Zero Mission then. I wonder how long the games are...
Metroid,3adyjz,Davo93,4,Fri Jun 19 14:31:41 2015 UTC,10 hours for the grand tour with all upgrades. 3 hours if you know what you are doing. EDIT: in regard to /u/mylifeonmybike: Speedrun:1h; normal play:3h
Metroid,3adyjz,Bross93,2,Fri Jun 19 10:17:48 2015 UTC,Zero Mission for the GBA is a very good choice.

It's an interesting contrast going from being extremely creepy with unnerving music to a peaceful aquatic area with really calming music. Easily one of my favourite locations."
Metroid,3adyjz,JNguyen96,2,Fri Jun 19 18:27:28 2015 UTC,pretty sure it is. basically same layout and everything
Metroid,3adyjz,Smaktat,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:04:27 2015 UTC,Some of the best music/ambience from any game ever.  Phendrana Drifts and Crashed Frigate especially.
Metroid,3adyjz,prpr_hrdcr,18,Fri Jun 19 10:37:31 2015 UTC,"I remember playing it when I was 12 and being completely freaked out. I thought it was a horror game like doom where you walk in the room the lights flicker and you're screwed. You'll be fine, no crazy pop ups. Metroid Prime is my favorite game. Too bad I can't get the controls to work on my pc."
Metroid,3adyjz,joecb91,8,Fri Jun 19 19:00:58 2015 UTC,"I'm playing it for the GameCube and I enjoy it :3 Seriously I dunno why but it really gives me that creepy feeling.  I don't believe the game has jumpscares at all, but this game makes me easily spooked. Like I'm being watched. :P"
Metroid,3adyjz,BobisOnlyBob,16,Fri Jun 19 22:08:58 2015 UTC,Lemme know what you think of the music once you reach Phendrana Drifts.
Metroid,3adyjz,jaamfan,3,Mon Jun 22 09:23:54 2015 UTC,"I love that track. Whenever I hear it, it always takes me back to the first time I played through the game and the sense of wonder I had when I was exploring the world of Tallon IV."

Metroid,3adyjz,JNguyen96,2,Fri Jun 19 17:36:51 2015 UTC,"Pick up a USB Gamecube controller or you can buy a cheap converter.  I have the one in the second link and it works just fine, but this is the top Amazon result."

Metroid,3adyjz,joecb91,12,Fri Jun 19 21:15:32 2015 UTC,That part of the game made me put the game down for months.
Metroid,3adyjz,Humple3,3,Fri Jun 19 21:50:31 2015 UTC,It is pretty horrifying.
Metroid,3adyjz,joecb91,5,Fri Jun 19 22:23:04 2015 UTC,Ugh... I never liked the pitch black parts. Especially if I had to scan something
Metroid,3adyjz,TyagoHexagon,4,Fri Jun 19 13:02:49 2015 UTC,The Trilogy version on the Wii made it even creepier too.
Metroid,3adyjz,thegreathobbyist,3,Fri Jun 19 13:17:56 2015 UTC,I played the Trilogy version. How did it get creepier? (Never played the original)
Metroid,3adyjz,nickjacksonD,6,Mon Jun 22 15:19:25 2015 UTC,"They made it darker and added a few more enemies.  IIRC, you need the thermal visor to see anything in the Trilogy version, but in the GCN one you can still see well enough with the normal visor."
Metroid,3adyjz,TyagoHexagon,17,Sat Jun 20 00:34:50 2015 UTC,"Enjoy that feeling, it's one of the best things Prime has to offer. Now imagine me playing that when I was around 7 years old. I don't know how I managed to play that game, honestly."
Metroid,3adyjz,GoldenBoy25,5,Sat Jun 20 16:56:06 2015 UTC,I know I didn't. The music of the Parasite Queen and Plated Beetle fight scared the shit out of me as a kid. And that was it until I'd revisit the game later in life.
Metroid,3adyjz,tccrist,3,Sat Jun 20 17:47:20 2015 UTC,"Yup! I was like 11 and once I got to phazon mines I quit for quite a while it was too intense... Now it's my favorite part of the game!! (Besides the first time you enter phendrana, forever my omg moment in a game)"
Metroid,3adyjz,GoldenBoy25,5,Sat Jun 20 19:12:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the music is a really big part of the atmosphere too. I was especially frightened by the dark aether music in Echoes."
Metroid,3adyjz,PointZ3RO,16,Fri Jun 19 11:35:50 2015 UTC,"Enjoy it man. It's one of the greatest games of all time. For your first 2D game, I think it should be Super Metroid. It is probably the best game Nintendo has ever made and frequently appears in the top 10 of best games ever made."
Metroid,3adyjz,Swaggerlisk,5,Fri Jun 19 15:57:34 2015 UTC,"And after that probably Zero Mission because it kept the non-linearity of Super Metroid. (Unless you don't mind having no map, then play the original.)"
Metroid,3adyjz,Koog330,5,Fri Jun 19 16:25:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think that makes sense.  Then Fusion after that.  Even though chronologically Zero Mission comes first, I still would rather play Super Metroid first just because of how influential it was.  It essentially built a genre on its own."
Metroid,3adyjz,GavinTheAlmighty,11,Fri Jun 19 16:36:21 2015 UTC,"The creepiness is one of my favourite aspects about the Prime games. It's not even the environments themselves that are creepy. It's the fact that you are completely isolated, the only voice accompanying you being the robotic tones of your HUD alerting you to things happening. It truly is a masterpiece in terms of its atmosphere.   Just wait until you get to Prime 2: Echoes. I feel the creepiness really hits a new level here, and although Prime 3: Corruption was less isolated than its predecessors, there are definitely some really harrowing environments to explore.   Enjoy Metroid Prime. It's such a great game to get lost in!"
Metroid,3adyjz,Humple3,11,Fri Jun 19 12:00:52 2015 UTC,"I'd say Metroid Prime is particularly spooky because, unlike its sequels, there's pretty much total isolation. It doesn't help that some enemies/areas are just straight up nightmare fuel."
Metroid,3adyjz,OranJ1zz,10,Fri Jun 19 13:14:00 2015 UTC,"Well Lumos wasn't exactly by your side very often. I won't spoil anything for OP by MP2 has some extremely memorable, creepy moments."

Metroid,3adyjz,twinfyre,5,Fri Jun 19 14:27:26 2015 UTC,"I freaked out the first time I fought that Chozo ghost. Not being able to do damage to them (didnt know how) coupled with the extremely loud, unsettling music... Im hearing it now in my head..."
Metroid,3adyjz,Roflha,3,Fri Jun 19 12:05:23 2015 UTC,As soon as I walked into a room and heard the screech I was already booking it to the closest door.
Metroid,3adyjz,Artanisx,10,Fri Jun 19 12:27:27 2015 UTC,Just wait for prime 2. That game scares the crap outta me.
Metroid,3adyjz,Earth_Pony,6,Fri Jun 19 15:52:29 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, that game. The last time I felt pants crapping dread on that level was when I got to the regenerator section of resident evil 4.  I love how every time you go into the dark world you have this sinking feeling of ""I really shouldn't be here""."
Metroid,3adyjz,Wei_Tzu,7,Sat Jun 20 00:36:02 2015 UTC,Plus the logs you find from the troopers was always very off-putting from the get go for me
Metroid,3adyjz,fpiceail,12,Sat Jun 20 05:42:12 2015 UTC,And then Nintendo announces Metroid PRIME Federation Force and you wonder what's wrong with them.
Metroid,3adyjz,darthluigi36,5,Fri Jun 19 13:50:32 2015 UTC,"Well to be 100% truthful, the Prime title means that the story is supposed* to be in the Phazon story arc, so it's still possible that Federation Force is a true Prime title.  In all likelihood however, they used the name ""Prime"" to indicate that it's a 3D first-person style game.  *I say supposed because the Phazon connection in Metroid Prime: Hunters was never explicitly stated, and is a stretch at best."
Metroid,3adyjz,Shayz_,9,Fri Jun 19 20:01:18 2015 UTC,"Frigate Orpheon (the first location of the game) is indeed quite creepy, and eerie. This is far from the most creepy the Prime Trilogy gets throughout, though. Hell, even in the original Prime, there are more spooky places."
Metroid,3adyjz,GavinTheAlmighty,16,Fri Jun 19 22:24:37 2015 UTC,"I loved the Xenoresearch part of Prime 3. That's the part where you are going through an eerie lab with mutated metroids in the containers which freak out at you while you walk past. Meanwhile this music is playing:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJVXIf-UAyg  You get to the end and find the multi-missile item, but its in one of the canisters and you see cords leading to an energy tank. You realize that you have to turn off all the power but the game subtly lets you know that when you do that all the metroids get let out. So you get the item and the power goes out, and lots of the doors lock which makes the route back out of the research station much longer. As you head back you see metroids flying under the floor and in the pipes, and then they start going after you.   That was always the best part of Prime 3 for me."
Metroid,3adyjz,ninger6,11,Fri Jun 19 14:03:20 2015 UTC,"Fuck dude, I had to stop playing for a day to mentally prepare myself for that part when I realized what was happening."
Metroid,3adyjz,Shayz_,2,Sat Jun 20 04:12:07 2015 UTC,THIS OMG
Metroid,3adyjz,ninger6,6,Fri Jun 19 10:34:00 2015 UTC,"Easily the best part of that game.  Corruption was generally an open game with vast environments, and Skytown seems and feels peaceful enough, but that part is really claustrophobic and uncomfortable.  It's a great contrast and you can tell that something is going to happen.  It's wonderful."
Metroid,3adyjz,Toribor,8,Fri Jun 19 12:40:51 2015 UTC,I have a feeling GFS Valhalla was a tad more creepy but maybe that was just me. And a lot of Echoes before it got boring from all the upgrades.
Metroid,3adyjz,pick-a-spot,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:18:23 2015 UTC,"First time playing through MP3 as a kid I stopped at the Valhalla and never played through MP3 again until Trilogy was released on the Wii U (which I then completed the game 100% lol)  idk what it was, but for some reason I got too scared to keep playing."
Metroid,3adyjz,pick-a-spot,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:29:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I went there once and freaked out and left and tried to avoid it for as long as I could. It was a very uncomfortable area of the game, felt like MP3 had just turned into a horror game. I managed to get through it but I was freaking out that I'd get lost and die so many times.   When I play it now I still think I'll get lost a bit but it doesn't freak me out any more haha."
Metroid,3adyjz,scg06,6,Fri Jun 19 15:51:16 2015 UTC,"When you revisit the crashed ship later on the surface of Tallon IV that blew my mind. Half submerged and starting to decay, revisiting that ship was really interesting for me, and the music was spectacular."
Metroid,3adyjz,LSD001,10,Fri Jun 19 13:00:31 2015 UTC,played it for the first time a few months ago.  Make sure you scan everything and read most things. It's worth it
Metroid,3adyjz,zodberg,5,Mon Jun 22 09:28:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I will be sure to read everything as I always felt like it was important. Even in games where reading isn't necessary :p
Metroid,3adyjz,jaamfan,10,Tue Jun 23 02:31:10 2015 UTC,just to clear up any confusion..as this is your first Metroid game as it was mine... the 'space pirates' are like the re-occuring bad guys of the galaxy.   And the thing that looks like a flying Raptor is like one of their top generals and your arch-nemesis.  Metroid lore - for backstory before earlier 2D games; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yokV_IY3k2I  Don't research anymore then this as potential Prime spoilers will come up. Everything else will be revealed slowly throughout prime
Metroid,3adyjz,mslurr,7,Fri Jun 19 14:41:15 2015 UTC,"Few games can match the atmosphere created in metroid prime. You're exploring a hostile planet in the ruins of an entire civilisation. It's incredibly creepy but also beautiful. And the soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard, I envy you going into the metroid prime world for the first time! Enjoy it."

Metroid,3adyjz,the_dinks,2,Fri Jun 19 16:59:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah Samus is a woman because of Ripley, Ridley is named after Ridley Scott, the metroids are based on the face huggers, the evolutions in metroid 2 are based on the different stages of development of the aliens, the fact that you go to the homeworld in 2 is directly tied to the plot of the second film. Even fusion is based on the aliens movie where they clone Ripley to get the queens DNA. Lots of back and forth."

Metroid,3adyjz,DawsonJBailey,5,Sat Jun 20 00:02:01 2015 UTC,"You should watch it as soon as possible. Metroid takes a lot of cues from the series, but it's also a fantastic scifi horror film on its own. I love the 70s-futuristic feel it gives, and the special effects are fantastic. Easily my favorite movie."

Metroid,3adyjz,Operation_Ivysaur,6,Fri Jun 19 18:19:42 2015 UTC,"Absolutely it is. Metroid has historically been a serious highlighting isolation and the things that come with it. The games sported gorgeous visuals in many areas, while also providing many profoundly eerie and unnerving landscapes and situations. You are a lone bounty hunter exploring a forgotten world. Enjoy it!"
Metroid,3adyjz,Shayz_,4,Fri Jun 19 18:57:01 2015 UTC,They're supposed to feel creepy!
Metroid,3adyjz,Jakesta7,5,Fri Jun 19 14:18:27 2015 UTC,"Remember the feeling man. Few games can accomplish the combination effect between isolation, atmosphere and ambiance that Prime has to offer. It's the best game I've ever played.   Being lost in that world is normal. It will feel smaller soon, but exploring the ruins, figuring out how that world was destroyed and becoming more powerful as you progress are all what that game is about. Take your own path and enjoy the ride. It's just you and a power suit in this journey."

Metroid,3adyjz,MatrixChicken,3,Fri Jun 19 22:36:26 2015 UTC,you should try metroid fusion.

Metroid,3adyjz,stringsanbu,3,Mon Jun 22 09:18:04 2015 UTC,oOOOOOh man. prime one is sooooo good. and yeah when i first played prime one i was super creepy. like everyone else is saying. its cause youre alone.
Metroid,3adyjz,Darkblitz9,3,Fri Jun 19 23:29:31 2015 UTC,"My first Metroid game was Fusion. I wonder what it must feel like to play a Prime game as one's first Metroid?  Anyway, have fun! Prime and Prime 2 are among my favorite games of all time. And I definitely agree with you on how creepy it is. It's really immersive and atmospheric in that regard.  If you really like that creepy feeling and want to try a 2D Metroid in the future, I strongly recommend Metroid Fusion. To this day, no game has freaked me out as much as that game has. I think it's the scariest game in the series."
Metroid,3adyjz,InsanityRaptor,2,Fri Jun 19 23:48:06 2015 UTC,"I couldn't be more happy that I started with Fusion, too.  I'd never played a game before that made me generally afraid to move into a new area.

Metroid,3adyjz,Earth_Pony,3,Sat Jun 20 04:19:39 2015 UTC,"I was really creeped out the first time I played that level. I wouldn't call it a scary game though, but the other space pirate areas do have some creepy moments.  Also, Prime was the first game I played of the GCN/PS2 gen, and the area you go to directly after leaving the frigate is one of the things I will remember the most out of all my years of gaming.   After all the time I spent on the N64 and PS1, seeing the Tallon Overworld for the first time was just such a beautiful sight."
Metroid,3adyjz,DragonBall_Zack,3,Fri Jun 19 16:22:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is suppose to be :)"
Metroid,3adyjz,PostOfficeBuddy,3,Fri Jun 19 16:45:48 2015 UTC,Just wait till you get to Metroid Fusion. The creep factor gets much higher there.

Metroid,3adyjz,TurboRex300,3,Fri Jun 19 18:24:41 2015 UTC,"I envy you, I wish I could play Metroid Prime for the first time again. All three Prime games have amazing atmosphere, capturing beauty and loss along with the feeling of unsettling isolation you described. Prime is tied with Prime 2 for my absolute favorite games of all time so I'm glad you're enjoying it. :)  I'm sure others in the thread have said it, but if you have not played Super Metroid, I definitely recommend giving it a go after you finish this one."

Metroid,3ak2k8,MonochromeTyrant,3,Sat Jun 20 23:57:46 2015 UTC,"With that said, I suggest this be added to the side bar.  It's perhaps the most objective AND thorough thing on the game I've ever seen."
Metroid,3ak2k8,Laughing_Luna,-2,Sun Jun 21 00:47:24 2015 UTC,"Oh, didn't notice the videos  Sorry"
Metroid,3ak2k8,RidleyBro,5,Sun Jun 21 00:27:25 2015 UTC,"It was poorly written.  Really, that's the origin of all problems with the story. Sakamoto tried to flesh out Samus' character by highlighting her emotions and weaknesses, but he ended up turning her into a submissive teenager that constantly seek the approval of a man who constantly despise and endanger her needlessly (which, according to previous portrayals really shouldn't act like he does in Other M. Adam's character is just as poorly written and butchered as Samus in my opinion). Problems with Localization (which was also directed by Sakamoto) worsened these problems for the Western edition of the game (constantly bored monologue anyone?).  Not that there is anything wrong with giving a character emotions and weaknesses (this is a common strawman that defenders of the game like to throw around a lot), but the way he did was just poorly explained, poorly explored, poorly handled and wrong in general. Personally I believe that what Sakamoto wanted to show is very different from what he actually ended up making, the wonders of shitty writing. It was a failed experiment that had a lot of potential but ended up in a massive failure. Which is a pity, I would have loved a more narrative focused Metroid."
Metroid,3ak2k8,DarkSamus987,3,Sun Jun 21 00:59:12 2015 UTC,"Short and sweet summary of why Other M sucks:  It betrays the conventions of the series (and good games in general) through bad story, gameplay, sound and level design.  Done."
Metroid,3ak2k8,The_M4G,3,Mon Jun 22 11:11:24 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of things wrong with this game. A. Lot. Of. Things.  Here's one worth mentioning in particular, in case anyone missed it.  It's no secret that in Other M, Samus looks up to Adam as a father figure of sorts. This is in spite of the fact that not ONCE throughout the game does Adam exhibit anything remotely resembling empathy- he recklessly and carelessly endangers his men and Samus especially (in two extremely infamous and distressing instances in particular) and doesn't even acknowledge their deaths. He's honestly displayed as a sociopath, and Samus has some serious Stockholm Syndrome for showing him an iota of respect.  It's also no secret that Yoshio Sakamoto thinks of himself as a father of sorts to Samus. He was there at the beginning, at the drawing board, and is suspected to be the one who suggested ""hey, let's make our badass space hero a lady under the helmet."" Notably, he claimed to be the only one to know where her beauty mark was. Weird, but sure enough in Other M she has a mole or something on her jaw.   So, Adam is her father figure. Yoshio Sakamoto styles himself as her father. Now, Team Ninja is given some shit for this game, but they had nothing to do with the writing, and very little of the game design. Interviews with Team Ninja suggest that he is a nightmare to work with and insisted that he called the shots on pretty much every aspect of the game, from the awful writing, the ""timbre of Jessica Martin's voice"", the incredibly bizarre d-pad single-wiimote control scheme and unfinished FPS function, and the incredibly linear level layout. In fact, I'll need to cite my sources or someone else will, but someone at Team Ninja said that they had to convince Sakamoto not to make it a linear on-rails shooter  Other M is what happens when you give a guy the budget to make his self-insert fanfiction into a videogame."

Isn't consistent with any other Prime game (I mean come on, Prime Pinball got that right), chibi style not really helping it (I don't know why it offsets me so much, besides the obvious. Maybe it makes everything less intimidating?), lackluster designs (NOTHING really stands out here), and on top of it abysmal graphical quality for the 3DS (And from the company that made Luigi's Mansion on 3DS).  I thought people were exaggerating when they were talking about Prime Hunters and it being better than this game, but BOY was I wrong. It's practically the same! (I can't fully tell because it's visual design is simply much better than Federation Force, but whatever).  And don't bring up the argument that it might be improved in the next year. This is E3.

When hunters came out, echoes and zero mission were both announced at the same time, and it was made clear that Hunters was more of a side project compared to Echoes and ZM."

Its multiplayer was also different because it wasn't just going around shooting waves of enemies and each Hunter had different weapons and abilities.

Metroid,3agino,superhanson2,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:24:11 2015 UTC,"Federation Force's release, during a long Metroid drought, is just bad timing. If Federation Force had been released on the DS in 2006 instead of Hunters, I don't think the backlash would have been as negative.  I think Nintendo could probably avoided a lot of the negative reaction to Federation Force if they'd spent 20 extra seconds saying ""This is a spinoff, just to be clear so you guys know this is a spinoff. We're still making a mainline Metroid game later, but this is not it.""  There seems to be a lot of people disappointed that this isn't the Metroid game they wanted, when they should be able to tell Federation Force is pretty obviously a spinoff. A bit of clarity (and a promise that a regular Metroid is coming later) could have helped a lot.  Granted we're on Reddit so everyone would have complained anyway."

I loved the concept of the different hunters and how unique each of them was and each having their own Morphball equivalent gimmick.  Multiplayer was fun...when cheaters weren't involved LOL  I'm much more hyped for FF and am expecting a better game than Hunters actually and IMO pretty much everyone here is overreacting so hard it's silly. Any other franchise, fans would have been overjoyed about the confirmation that their franchise isn't dead, but here, getting a spin-off that explores more of the universe and adds a non-protagonist viewpoint is apparently the end of the fucking world.

Of course I'm not saying it IS linear but compared to the other 2 it's like there's a little less exploration involved, or at least that's how it feels to me.

Mp1 is the worst of the three to me. It had the worst level designs and themes by far of the three.

Yes, they're similar, but the two studios are so artistically oriented that it's likely no more than a tip of the hat, if even. I doubt Irrational (Bioshock developers) looked at Elysia, thinking, ""man, that rail is perfect. I think we could sell games on that alone."" I feel like they actually improved on MP3, making it feel more like a rollercoaster than a rail-shooter, which requires a significant amount of innovation in and of itself, even if the concept was stolen.  Then there's the factor of nothing being truly original. Yes, Metroid innovated this game element, but the source of this inspiration can be seen in inverted roller coasters."
Metroid,3aj6v5,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:02:14 2015 UTC,"Inverted roller coaster:       An inverted roller coaster is a roller coaster in which the train runs under the track with the seats directly attached to the wheel carriage. This latter attribute is what sets it apart from the older suspended coaster, which runs under the track, but swings via a pivoting bar attached to the wheel carriage. The coaster type's inverted orientation distinguishes it from a traditional roller coaster, where the passengers' legs rather than arms are exposed.  The inverted coaster was pioneered by the Swiss roller coaster designers Bolliger & Mabillard in the early 1990s. The first installation came at Six Flags Great America in 1992.  Batman: The Ride opened to much fanfare and was ""cloned"" many times at other parks. The inverted coaster quickly became an industry favorite with custom designs installed nearly every year. The tallest and fastest inverted coaster is Wicked Twister at Cedar Point towering 215 feet (66 m) and reaching speeds up to 72 miles per hour (116 km/h). The longest inverted coaster is Banshee at Kings Island which travels along 4,124 feet (1,257 m) of track.  Other roller coaster manufacturers followed in the footsteps of Bolliger & Mabillard and began working on their own inverted coaster designs, including Vekoma, Intamin and other smaller companies. Intamin has few designs classified as inverted coasters, although they do install inverted coaster trains on some of their launched designs. Vekoma, on the other hand, usually mass-produces the same design (SLC (689m Standard)) with 41 identical coasters – and a few variations of that design – installed around the world.  Also, in recent years, Vekoma has become the first manufacturer to install a family-friendly inverted roller coaster. Giovanola also has a single inverted coaster operating.

Metroid,3af7h9,Whelt,8,Fri Jun 19 17:14:50 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the people complaining are new fans. Between metroids 1-super there was a decent couple years between the three games and then a long development cycle with no metroid games. Hell metroid skipped the 64 all together.  Then we were spoiled with metroid for a few years in rapid succession which is rare for main iterations of any of nintendo's ips let alone the one that missed the second half of the 90s.   So suddenly fusion, mp1, mp2,  zero misssions, hunters, pinball, mp3, and then other m.   I want more metroid too but people need to chill out. This is metroid not megaman. Games usually take a while to come and the last two nintendo consoles got two full metroid games. How many mario and zeldas are released for each console(the actual games not spinoffs and sports)?   Although it hasn't been announced I'm certain that them releasing a spinoff game is a sure indicator that we're getting another metroid game, maybe a prime 4 or an attempt at other m without the godawful story and pixel hunting.   That said I do think the wild backlash against other m has something to do with the delay.  Partly because nintendo was short sighted and got the wrong message from the game ""well guess metroid bubble has burst back into the vault!"". Part of the problem might be that nintendo wants to be extra careful with the next game they put out because metroid is popular but it's more niche than zelda or mario and does poorly in their home market.    I think finally that it might partly be because the story of the game was the creator of the IP's baby and he might have taken the sales failure and critical panning of his game to  heart. He might have enough sway in the company to keep the series on ice for a while almost as if to go ""alright you don't like it, well these are MY toys so if you wont be nice I'll just take them home with me"".  Personally I think it's more the other m tanked and nintendo doesn't want to rush into another metroid half cocked thing more than Sakamoto being a toddler but who knows."

Despite being more linear, probably has something to do with better pacing."
Metroid,3aekx6,Darkjolly,2,Fri Jun 19 14:32:06 2015 UTC,"I'd say Metroid Prime 2 lies in the middle of that dichotomy, in terms of linearity."
Metroid,3aekx6,Swaggerlisk,6,Sat Jun 20 03:59:48 2015 UTC,"This is how I essentially view a true 'Metroid' game. Its the ability to travel to a variety of different environments, testing you skills and abilities based on your current equipment, it's is essentially the main emphasis of Metroid, that incorporates upgrading, exploring, and the individual character of Samus. If you take away Samus, some forms of exploration and gameplay styles, aren't apart of the game any more. Samus' story is apart of the Metroid, she is a descendant from the chozo, and her story is reflected by the chozo's actions, and helps develop the plot of a Metoird game. The metroids' were their creation, and Samus has almost a love hate relationship with the Metroids, sworn to destroy them all in some games (Metroid 1 and 2) but also developing her as a character (Super and Other M... yes, even that game). Samus was pretty much the embodiment of a silent protagonist, that was shaped by the idea of a 'Metroid' game, like the exploration, upgrading you  suit and powers, and  of course the isolation.   Essentially what I mean is that Samus as a character, has her own individual unique abilities and characteristics, that truly test the skills of exploring different environments."
Metroid,3aekx6,LuxShadow1,5,Fri Jun 19 14:29:36 2015 UTC,"Agree with everything you said except for the silent protagonist part. With the exception of Corruption, Samus was never a silent protagonist, she just doesn't have anyone to talk to, which is part of the feeling of isolation that makes up Metroid. Fusion handles this very well (unlike Other M), since she could be talking back to the computer the whole time, but she doesn't, because there's no need to. She's on a mission, not out to chitchat with her buddies (like Other M). The only time Samus speaks is when the story reaches its climax, and she has to speak to the computer/federation."
Metroid,3aekx6,MrKenta,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:49:24 2015 UTC,"Even before that point in Fusion, there are monologues on some of the elevator rides where she reveals a lot about her character and the way she thinks. This characterization is very important in setting the tone of the game, and, while missing from other Metroid titles, feels totally at home in Fusion."
Metroid,3aekx6,Jammintk,0,Sun Jun 21 21:30:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with almost everything you say... except that, while Samus is important to Metroid, she is (and I'm loath to admit it) not integral to it. Anyone else can become the protagonist for Metroid, we just haven't seen it yet.  That said, when I think of Metroid, I think of exploration, powering up, boss battles, hidden blocks to morph ball through... Nothing like an FPS where you set your abilities beforehand or anything.  Edit: After talking to my friend about it... If I were to compare the above to Zelda, that'd mean that Link could be replaced by anyone else... which I wouldn't like. Bringing that back to Metroid, I see now that I really wouldn't want to see a Metroid game without Samus. :/"
Metroid,3aekx6,Moulinoski,2,Fri Jun 19 17:09:11 2015 UTC,"It's not usually the same Link in every Zelda game, though. Yeah, they look the same, but most of them don't even have any character, either."
Metroid,3aekx6,SpahsgonnaSpah,3,Sat Jun 20 01:10:40 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, these are the essentials:   A large free-roaming world A suspenseful sci-fi atmosphere Exploration is required to find power ups Power ups increase your strength and allow you to access new areas"
Metroid,3aekx6,Father_Brain,2,Fri Jun 19 15:28:59 2015 UTC,"Isolation, exploration, and upgrading.  One of the biggest pillars in the Metroid series has been exploration through the use of upgrades. For example, in Super Metroid, you're able to roam around, but there are places off limits to you until you get certain upgrades. Then, when you receive that upgrade, you can backtrack and explore a whole new area and repeat the process of exploring, upgrading, and exploring more until the game is done. That, to me, is the most important part of what makes a Metroid game."
Metroid,3aekx6,Koog330,2,Fri Jun 19 15:17:07 2015 UTC,"I'd say the beauty in Metroid would be Theming, exploration and experimentation. The capacity to control the flow of the game and try new strategies against old enemies. Interacting with the world and learning about it. Getting lost in a massive world much, MUCH larger than you and mastering it.  MP3 Corruption may seem to be more restricted than others, for example, but despite that, it's like ZM gentle nudges of where to go, despite being told what to do, I don't feel restricted by it, mainly because I get a huge area to explore in each planet. It's like playing several mini Metroid games instead of feeling pushed through a straight hallway.  The beauty of this game is the love that they put in it. The effort to create a world interesting to be explored and loved. as YOU discover a new area, many possibilities open up. Enemies, power ups and the life threatening situation. What I've got to say is: It's how carefully crafted it is to become the optimal exploring experience in a rich world."
Metroid,3aekx6,V0ID115,3,Fri Jun 19 16:36:35 2015 UTC,"I think it all comes down to the atmosphere more than anything. The morph ball, missiles/super missiles, screw attack, and all that good stuff is all well and good and they have been in most of the Metroid titles, but at its heart, for me at least, it's the environment and level design.   If there was a Metroid game released without what are now considered the ""core power-ups"" of the series, I still think it would prevail as a Metroid title if the level design had that trademark eeriness and harrowing loneliness to it.   As Samus, you're never an invader. The creatures indigenous to the planets you are exploring are, for the most part, never directly against you. They are simply trying to survive and are attacking in order to protect themselves or their young. A Metroid game is not about storming through a planet killing some army that's against you, it's about landing onto a planet and simply becoming another product of its ecosystem. A new threat for the wildlife to defend themselves against."
Metroid,3aekx6,PointZ3RO,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:33:38 2015 UTC,"But by those checkpoints, Other M suits perfectly?"
Metroid,3aekx6,Rootayable,3,Fri Jun 19 15:25:17 2015 UTC,"Whilst Other M definitely does have some of those concepts, it falls flat on almost every other level. Even if we pretend that Other M is its own stand-alone title with no association whatsoever, it has so many glaring flaws in both its narrative and gameplay.   Even if a Metroid title has all the pieces required to be a good Metroid title, its all in how well those pieces are fitted together. If Super Metroid and the Prime trilogy are an example of all those pieces coming together like a completed jigsaw puzzle, Other M is the equivalent of a half-finished puzzle that someone lost interest in completing with all the remaining pieces scattered around a cardboard box somewhere."
Metroid,3aekx6,PointZ3RO,2,Fri Jun 19 15:38:38 2015 UTC,"Other M's failures had to do with plot and theme, and characterization. By many accounts the gameplay was still fun and just because it's bad doesn't mean its not a metroid game.   Federation Force, by contrast, may end up a very good game but won't really be considered a metroid-style game."
Metroid,3aekx6,TheChocolateLava,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:36:56 2015 UTC,"Would it still be Metroid if it didn't have a screw attack ability?   Well there's Metroid Prime...  In all honesty it's about exploration. And the tools required to traverse a new area. Be it a spaceship, or a planet. Even if you strip away the most iconic abilities if the core gameplay is still intact, it is Metroid.   I'd say if you strip away some of the most iconic abilities you may even get a stronger entry. Because even long time players will be forced to adapt to the strange new world."
Metroid,3aekx6,Mortimer42,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:45:33 2015 UTC,"Everybody has been saying exploration, but I've never felt like I was exploring in a Metroid game. Like you kind of wander in and out of areas, but in the end you're still following 1 set path. Sure there are small things you can do outside of the mission and the required you to  find it yourself, but the worlds aren't very open ended.   For me Metroid is found through the upgrades. Your entire mission is essentially go from one upgrade to the next til you are strong enough to kill the final boss. The entire way though you're skills with each upgrade is tested."
Metroid,3aekx6,yifftionary,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:41:44 2015 UTC,"The level and enemy design, as well as music has always played a huge role in Metroid for me. That's one of the reasons why Other M sucks even if the story turned out so perfect, but it didn't so there's that.  A lot of people hate Other M for the story and Samus, which is true. But also the soundtrack are rehashes of old songs somehow made worse, enemies have no depth to their design and just look really lame, and the levels are pretty  much corridors.  Without any of the decent levels (and this counts for how they are designed for you to explore, how they look and what populates those levels) Metroid would suck, and that's why I'm worried about Federation Force and why I hated Other M.  Of course as well I like to have to find upgrades to progress, good level design makes stuff like that fun where if the levels sucked ass it would just be tedious or somethign."
Metroid,3aekx6,DarkSamus987,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:39:08 2015 UTC,"What about the grossness of everything? Samus is a very fragile being in a world full of acid, lava, mind controlling disease, radiation, mutated tendril covered plants, parasitic alien insect jellyfish that latch onto your face and suck the life out of you, giant mutant insect things with their ribs showing and skeletal spikes and whatnot, creepy Chozo statues with dripping chests that come to life and move towards you slowly, etc, etc. Plus, they way these things all flit, crawl and drift around, it's all really unerving.  I'd say a big part of Metroid is how if you're trying to avoid touching all of this really gross biological stuff and you've just got to keep it away from you with your arm cannon. It's sort of like a survival horror in that respect. Something something primal fears.  Well that's how I see it."
Metroid,3aekx6,earache_my_eye,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:11:02 2015 UTC,"Does a Metroid game need the iconic abilities like Screw Attack, Morph Ball, etc? No, not really. Does it need some sort of abilities at all? Of course.  The key part of the abilities in Metroid is that they are often used both in and outside of combat. Morph ball is used to get into small spaces, but it is also used to dodge enemy attacks. Especially those from bosses. The Ice Beam does a lot of damage, and is especially useful against metroids, but it is also very useful for getting around.  As for what, specifically makes a Metroid game, it's the atmosphere and the progression. Revisiting old areas to get to new places within them is a key part of it. Being able to explore and use a new ability to get to places that were out of reach before is a huge part of Metroid."

Above all though, the music should be as alien and awe-inspiring as Metroid's music has always been.  What I think we'll get is, at best, a new interpretation of the series.  Nintendo's going to want to pull in a whole new group of fans if it plans to keep the Metroid IP alive, and that'll probably mean making alterations to the format of the games.  That could mean anything from increasing the pace of the game (heavier focus on killing a lot of enemies, temporary power-ups, more linearity), changing how you interact with Samus (3rd person or over-the-shoulder so you ""see"" her rather than ""be"" her), changing the progression of the game (no longer going from 'lose all your gear' --> 'super powerful and the planet explodes', but rather accomplishing objectives and being rated), or, I don't know...just generally departing from the canon?  It's really hard to imagine what Nintendo's perception of what customers want will be in 3 years, but I definitely don't feel optimistic."

Metroid,3aeavk,joecb91,7,Fri Jun 19 16:13:14 2015 UTC,"For me, one of the most memorable boss battles was the Parasite Queen from Metroid Prime. It's not a particularly interesting boss battle now, but when I first encountered it, it was amazing.  Metroid Prime was the second game I got for my Gamecube, the first gaming console I ever owned, and my first Metroid game. The only other real video games I had played were SSBM at a friend's house and LoZ: Wind Waker, which I got first. I was young enough that I wasn't really ready for something as creepy as Metroid Prime. (I couldn't handle suspense very well when I was little).   So, going through the Frigate Orpheon, scanning all the evidence of whatever happened there, with these gigantic mutated dead creatures that had appeared to destroy large chunks of the ship. I was pretty creeped out, peering around every corner hoping there wasn't some monstrosity lying in wait. All the information you get from scanning things really put my imagination to work, and gave a good sense of foreboding throughout the whole ship. The first person perspective, which took some serious getting used to, also added to the sense of unease.  And then, when I finally got to the Parasite Queen boss battle, it was terrifying! One of these huge mutant creatures I had been seeing dead was alive, in front of me, and it had acid lasers! The music also really added to the experience, contrasting against the creepy, but quiet ambiance of the rest of the ship. It was terrifying, and I loved it!  The memorable experience I had with my first playthrough of Metroid Prime and other Metroid games after it is probably the main reason Metroid is my favorite series now."

Of course this wasn't the only time it happened in Prime, the Omega Pirate is also huge and Meta Ridley's room is even bigger, but it's the fact that Flaahgra's encounter was the first of its size, at least in the Metroid universe, that was so crazy."

When it went crazy from getting damaged, I panicked along with it because I didn't know how to handle him going so fast. It also didn't help that I tried to fight him underwater in that play through.  Also, all of the SA-X encounters where you are too weak to fight it head on. It really sets the mood when the music drops and you're hiding in a corner hoping SA-X doesn't find you, and the time where she uses the power bomb to break your hiding place...!   If someone ever makes a game out of hiding from the nazis during or leading up to WWII, it better borrow elements from how SA-X felt throughout Metroid Fusion."

Release a technically competent console early with a huge price and risk backlash? Release an intermediate console in two years and have alternating periods of third party support?

Metroid,3adwno,TheBossMan24,2,Fri Jun 19 09:23:13 2015 UTC,You can use this map from Metroid Database  Alternatively if you wish to maintain the scavenger hunt spirit then each empty artifact slot will tell you in which area / chamber the artifact is.
Metroid,3adwno,Mortimer42,4,Fri Jun 19 09:26:05 2015 UTC,"This is really the way to do it. The game tells you exactly what room each artifact is in, so all you have to do is locate it on your map."
Metroid,3adwno,joe_copp,2,Fri Jun 19 09:44:56 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I also think it's one of the more fiddly elements the game could have done without. I mean you went through the story and hunted for secrets. Why go back to just touch a few places and then go back again for no gain other then to open a really big door?  I suppose you could find a secret or two but that's about it. Prime is one of my favorite games, but if I had to criticize it then it would be that the artifact hunt feels a bit... padded. The entire game presents itself very naturally and leaves you open to explore, there is no reason to force people the extra miles if you already collected a bunch / all the regular upgrades."

Metroid Prime Pinball uses the basic mechanics of pinball, along with typical pinball items. New mechanics are introduced, such as wall jumping and the ability to fire weapons.

Metroid,3aao9r,SomeMetroid,8,Thu Jun 18 16:58:09 2015 UTC,"The call out guy got it wrong though, he's QA at NLG. He was a Junior Designer a while back but no longer. The information on NLG still shows that he's a Junior Designer, which means that call out guy doesn't actually know shit and just grabbed the info off of their website which is outdated.   Plus, nobody in their right minds would call out a coworker like that on a public forum. You deal with that internally or you yourself would get put on the target to be fired."
Metroid,3aao9r,Baker_The,5,Thu Jun 18 17:57:04 2015 UTC,"The fact that he pulled his LinkedIn page kinda gives credence to it, though.  Why would he pull his info just because some guy pretending to be him on a random /v/ thread was impersonating him?

Metroid,3aao9r,brainfreeze91,7,Thu Jun 18 20:28:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm willing to bet that part's not entirely true.  He probably just dug up enough info on him to make him scared to continue responding. It seemed pretty unprofessional."
Metroid,3aao9r,Jammintk,5,Thu Jun 18 17:56:43 2015 UTC,"Actually that's a good point, it doesn't matter if that part is true or not, if it scared him to not respond, it adds some validity to the claim."
Metroid,3aao9r,AtomKick,3,Thu Jun 18 17:59:47 2015 UTC,"Plus it also might protect the guy's job. A false alarm might make him scared to post more, which might protect him in the future."
Metroid,3aao9r,Chispshot,0,Thu Jun 18 18:34:18 2015 UTC,"The employee only threatened him with action if he didn't stop. It seems he wanted to avoid bringing it up with the rest of the company.  In that sense, it isn't that unrealistic for the employee to just call him out on 4chan. Especially since it seems like they weren't near each other at the time, he might not have had a quicker way of contacting him."
Metroid,3aao9r,SpahsgonnaSpah,40,Thu Jun 18 19:46:04 2015 UTC,"So tl;dr.  Person claiming to be insider (likely Brad Maxim, Level Designer for Next Level Games as he quickly pulled his Linkdin page minutes after being called out on 4chan) started leaking Federation Force information that lined up with what we later saw at Treehouse and heard in interviews today.   Game had Metroid Prime slapped on it at the last minute was named ""Metroid: Federation Force"". Was thrown in the direct last minute as filler since they wanted Metroid anything in it.  Samus based 3DS game in development, uses similar Chibi style and this game acts as a sort of companion too it.  Samus based Metroid Game is not being made first party, but second party developer. Federation Force features different guns, some you choose at the start of missions, others you find through the battlefield. Shotgun, Heavy Machine Gun, Semi Auto.  Samus shows up several times in Federation Force but doesn't really have much bearing on anything.  Game has lockon system similar to Prime Samus is taller than the Feds Single player has bots take control of the other characters. Game is far more expansive than the trailer shows, though it's a level based game and has very little exploration. Mecha Ridley is in the game. Blastball may be sold standalone as well on the Eshop Missions are the worst part, Campaign is fun.  You can choose skills based on how you play to customize yourself. (Shield if you want to tank for example)   https://archive.moe/v/thread/298802304/#298802891 Link to entire thread"
Metroid,3aao9r,thegreathobbyist,13,Thu Jun 18 15:56:18 2015 UTC,"Oh, she shows up? A shame. I was hoping the 100% ending of Federation Force would be your crew getting shipwrecked and sending a distress signal that Samus would pick up in the next game."

If this is all true though, thank fuck for new Metroid things"
Metroid,3aao9r,AtomKick,4,Thu Jun 18 16:56:38 2015 UTC,Yeah it makes me concerned for the actual samus metroid title's art... why they do this?
Metroid,3aao9r,spiralingtides,7,Thu Jun 18 18:07:53 2015 UTC,"Japanese culture doesn't make cute and serious mutually exclusive. A chibi game can be completely serious and no one will bat an eye. Western culture views cute and serious as a spectrum, so the cuter something is the less serious it is. The chibi art style makes some sense in a co-op game based on a mobile playform because it improves visibility, which imo is extremely important in co-op games.  At least that's what I think there reason is. Not a developer so can't comfirm."
Metroid,3aao9r,dailyapple,5,Thu Jun 18 20:49:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get that, but for me Metroid isn't about just being serious. The metroid games have never been straight up horror games, but the definitely have horror elements in them and I feel thats an important theme that really defines the series for me. Chibi art really doesn't fit that in my opinion..."
Metroid,3aao9r,spiralingtides,2,Thu Jun 18 20:51:40 2015 UTC,"There is a really dark and twisted horror anime called ""when they cry."" It has a chibi art style, but is not really a cute show in any way. Searching for images is disproportionately biased towards the more disturbing scenes, so here's some cover art: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/34/Higurashi_Cover_Art.png Japanese culture doesn't find this style to clash with horror at all. I understand where you are coming from, but I also understand where Nintendo is coming from. This art style works very well in co-op games where it is important to tell who is who, and they don't find the art style clashing at all. They might even be thinking about how weird it is that we are offended by the art of all things.  While I would normally agree the bright and colorful color pallet wouldn't be well suited for an atmosphere of isolation, what we expect from Metroid in general, I don't see any problem with using it for a co-op spinoff based in the Metroid world. The Metroid universe isn't a dark and lonely place. Samus just happens to go by herself into dark places. This isn't a Samus game though, and it's not going to be a traditional Metroid game. It will be a Galactic Federation game, and the art style serves a purpose here. Mostly visibility.  I know it sucks we aren't getting our favorite heroine back yet, but I'm sure that when we do, the art style will be adjusted to fit the style of the game. Something to evoke that sense of isolation that the Metroid series has become so famous for.  I'd also argue that Fusion is straight up horror, but that's a discussion for another time."
Metroid,3aao9r,dailyapple,2,Thu Jun 18 22:07:44 2015 UTC,"Well first i thought we were talking about the rumored 2d metroid starring samus.  But focusing solely on MP:FF, the problem I have is that they are selling it as the ""prime"" universe and are suggesting they want to develop the federation's role there. In that reguard its strange for an artstyle to change from game to game within the same ""universe"". Think about other nintendo titles. Zelda got a cel shaded art style but they lay that out as its own branch of the zelda universe. They didn't make WW a direct story sequel to OoT....  And if we ARE to believe the rumors, MP:FF is supposed to be a tie in to the rumored 2d metroid. If this is true then I just worry that they are also going to go with a similar art direction. And I really don't want that..."

Now we can only hope that they do the right thing.  If I had to guess, I'd say they would keep the cartoony style for consistency, but they would change the atmosphere to be more in line with the traditional Metroid art style."
Metroid,3aao9r,dailyapple,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:32:04 2015 UTC,"Higurashi does not have a chibi art style, it makes a point to be as cutesy as possible at first as a purposeful juxtaposition to the horror sections, which have a very different visual and character design style to them.

It's started to become synonymous with ""not serious"" in my mind. Just a slip of the tongue.  The image I linked to was the cover art from wikipedia. If it isn't legit someone should go edit it.  Its been a while since I saw it, but from my recollection it was a show with a very bright happy art style. And often a very dark happy art style. I don't recall any really drastic changes in character designs when any of them went crazy; always just subtle things like shading and lighting. It's been a while though, and I wasn't really invested in the show so maybe my memory is fuzzy. You seem to have a better recollection of the show so I will just take your word for it."
Metroid,3aao9r,VoyagerOrchid,2,Fri Jun 19 02:25:23 2015 UTC,"This should be official art for the series. This is from one of the serious times, but I'll try to find a better still where the style is more significantly unique."

I don't buy it.  I also don't buy that this was ever not a Prime game. It's not just the name of Retro's original trilogy; Hunters (and FF) makes it clear they use the name Metroid Prime as their brand for any first-person 3D Metroid titles.

Metroid,3aao9r,thetacriterion,4,Thu Jun 18 16:37:34 2015 UTC,"If true, I think they probably just developed it as ""Metroid: Federation Force"" and then they retagged it Metroid Prime instead because it's a spinoff in the Prime universe and Nintendo thought it was important to make that clear/distinct.

Metroid,3aao9r,TweetsInCommentsBot,8,Thu Jun 18 17:31:23 2015 UTC,"I feel like I saw a post recently about an interview with one of the Prime story writers confirming that it was Sylux's ship at the end of Prime 3, and they wanted to feature him in a future game, so there's a definite possibility."
Metroid,3aao9r,t3stdummi,5,Thu Jun 18 17:37:14 2015 UTC,What the hell is so great about Sylux?
Metroid,3aao9r,Lord_of_Phendrana,5,Thu Jun 18 19:05:58 2015 UTC,Nothing other than Tanabe mentioning wanting to feature Sylux hunting Samus as the continuation of the plot from prime 3 to a potential prime 4.

Metroid,3acsg9,Koog330,9,Fri Jun 19 01:39:14 2015 UTC,"This is true, it is possible Sakamoto is working on a 2d Metroid. Like /u/ScionVyse said, he was supervisor on Splatoon, but I don't think that means his hands have been completely full, just look at some other Nintendo devs like Miyamoto who supervise several projects. There's also this, which suggests he might not want to make a game like Metroid again. Who knows, it's certainly possible."
Metroid,3acsg9,Wombo194,6,Fri Jun 19 02:27:45 2015 UTC,"It depends on how busy Sakamoto has been and if he wanted to do more Metroid.   He is a supervisor for Splatoon, and since basically the whole game was made last year, and development on it is still going on, he may still have his hands full."
Metroid,3acsg9,ScionVyse,3,Fri Jun 19 02:05:28 2015 UTC,I heard that Sakamoto was leaving traditional gaming. Was that inaccurate?
Metroid,3acsg9,Ryuutakeshi,3,Fri Jun 19 04:47:46 2015 UTC,"How is Sakamoto still working on Metroid considered a good news?  He's already done enough to turn Samus into a joke, and I don't see how he could kill the series any more than how he did with Other M. The fact that there might also be a Sakamoto title around the corner is no overlook, it's pure fridge horror.  (Yeah, I'm bitter)"
Metroid,3acsg9,RidleyBro,3,Fri Jun 19 08:45:59 2015 UTC,"You need to also remember that Sakamoto, like it or not, was there since the beginning for Metroid and has been arguably the most active person in devoloping many of the story and lore behind Metroid series, which includes Samus' backstory.  Outside of him there's really not many people who even cares much about that really.  Other M was not a good showcase, obviously, but I think dismissing him entirely as of now would be erroneous."
Metroid,3acsg9,ApolloGeist,2,Fri Jun 19 11:17:38 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but if the choice is between keeping Samus characterization from Other M and nothing I'll choose nothing every single time. It's better to have the series dead than ruined.  Unless of course either he or Nintendo grow up some common sense and will revise his vision for the series. Just hiring a decent writer to explain stuff better would have helped with Other M."
Metroid,3acsg9,RidleyBro,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:52:09 2015 UTC,you are putting way too much stock in believing this is somehow the only two alternatives. The Other M route isn't even that realistic given how much people have made clear about what they didn't like about Other M.
Metroid,3acsg9,ApolloGeist,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:15:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right. I was quite bitter when I wrote that, I'm actually mostly willing to give Sakamoto another chance with the series. He screwed up hard last time but he also did not screw up many other previous titles after all, right?  If he's smart, and while he might be a terrible writer it doesn't necessarily mean that he's also not smart, he will have taken note of the criticism of Other M and will work in order to avoid another debacle like that. Especially considering that not doing so would end in a commercial failure just as hard as last time."

Metroid,3abb9p,Father_Brain,6,Thu Jun 18 18:35:18 2015 UTC,"It's beyond me why they thought such a drastic change in style would appeal to fans.   I'm sure this game is not meant for ""fans"", as in, not just for people that have played the Metroid games, but to newer audiences, I can understand the looks, maybe is to make it different to the bazzillion space-manly-marine-dude-bros kind of look that many other games have."
Metroid,3abb9p,citizenofgaia,3,Thu Jun 18 20:54:44 2015 UTC,"If that's the idea then I really wish they hadn't resorted to the cutesy characters. Serious characters can still appeal to kids.   If they wanted to avoid the space marine look then they probably shouldn't have based the game around ""Federation Marines."" If the goal was to have a unique look they could have brought back the hunters or created all-new characters."
Metroid,3abb9p,Laughing_Luna,14,Thu Jun 18 22:18:41 2015 UTC,"I can get over having the spin-off not be a metroidvania and having it play drastically differently, but both Pinball and Other M look more like a Metroid game than Federation Force does.  I mean, with the current designs, the game looks more like a Mii game with a rough Metroid Paint Job.  Nevermind it not even looking remotely like a Prime title."
Metroid,3abb9p,Squ3akyN1nja,6,Thu Jun 18 18:53:48 2015 UTC,At this point I wouldn't be surprised if they announce that the character's are chibi styled to better integrate with Miis. That reasoning makes more sense than the reasoning they already gave. If Miis are involved then this game is basically Metroid Blast 2: Waiting for Samus.

Metroid,3abb9p,SylvanHawk,2,Thu Jun 18 19:53:47 2015 UTC,I'm not seeing what's stand out about it either. It's a FPS co-op game on 3DS. The only significance of that is that there aren't any right now. I remember Quest 64 getting the same sort of hype simply for being a JRPG on N64. But it was crap.
Metroid,3abb9p,plasmabeamonline,4,Thu Jun 18 20:58:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If the art style was consistent with the rest of the franchise, I would absolute forgive the departure from the normal gameplay style and give it a chance. As it is, they've changed too many variables."
Metroid,3abb9p,scg06,7,Fri Jun 19 02:04:49 2015 UTC,"I agree. If it looked like it had strong art direction I'd be genuinely interested. Chibi designs and Galactic Federation troopers ust don't mix.   What's next, Metroid's shaped like Kirby?"

Metroid,3abb9p,VTSvsAlucard,3,Thu Jun 18 20:53:58 2015 UTC,"It looks blocky and hideous, imo.  I really wish they had gone with a sleek aesthetic, at the very least.  But this game is ugly as sin."

Metroid,3abb9p,John_the_goat,3,Fri Jun 19 04:04:32 2015 UTC,One thing I'd like to point out is that even the characters in the single player/co-op modes are mechs/robots. They have hinged joints. You can see in some of the official art that's out.
Metroid,3abb9p,Anggul,4,Fri Jun 19 02:57:46 2015 UTC,"Right, but I assume the guys inside those mechs have the same proportions as the pilots in Blast Ball. The stocky, big head look seems to be common for both the mechs and pilots. It's just silly looking."
Metroid,3abb9p,thetacriterion,4,Fri Jun 19 03:20:54 2015 UTC,"Metroid title slapped on it regardless,  the game didn't really look all to pleasing to me. When they showed Blast Ball as just, well, Blast Ball the game and art style didn't grab me. Maybe if I try it I might find it better but it just doesn't seem that interesting to me and I really dislike the art style. If it truly is meant to take place in the Metroid universe,  then make it look like it is in the Metroid universe. If I don't buy the game, it's not because I'm still annoyed and upset that this is the only Metroid we are getting for a bit, but just cause it doesn't grab me all that much.  Edit: word"
Metroid,3abb9p,Evets616,2,Thu Jun 18 21:52:43 2015 UTC,"The aesthetic style is one that, while fine for other Nintendo franchises, just doesn't suit Metroid. Certainly not the GF who we know are fairly dark. I've wanted a GF game for a long time, but sure as hell not like this."
Metroid,3abb9p,fpiceail,2,Fri Jun 19 16:52:39 2015 UTC,A lot of that is spot on but I think Metroid can work without the feeling of isolation. I enjoyed Hunters and MP:2 multiplayer. I really like the idea of co-op Metroid but the way they have implemented that idea looks horrendous.
Metroid,3abb9p,TehDingo,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:21:20 2015 UTC,The art style is fine. It's the fact that it's apparently an ankle-deep shoot-em-up with no exploration and very little world-building that bothers me.
Metroid,3abb9p,phazon_pronk,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:51:11 2015 UTC,I think it's less that they purposely turned away from the style of the series and more that they slapped the Metroid name on at the last second
Metroid,3acewv,thep_lyn,30,Thu Jun 18 23:37:51 2015 UTC,"No, people were very excited when it got announced along with the DS. It was cool to see a 3d Metroid Prime on a handheld. It was also revealed along with Echoes and Zero Mission/Echoes were scheduled to release the same year."
Metroid,3acewv,Wombo194,6,Fri Jun 19 00:03:01 2015 UTC,Thank you
Metroid,3acewv,Jammintk,20,Fri Jun 19 00:05:49 2015 UTC,"Not really. There's a few reasons for this    A demo (Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt) that was a short multiplayer mode with one map and no characters besides Samus was packed in with the first DS units. This demo was VERY fun. Metroid Prime 2: Echoes was announced around the same time, which was a proper continuation of the series, and was following Prime, one of the best received Metroid Games. Metroid Zero Mission was also announced around this time. It looked like it played really well, especially to fans of Fusion which had come out not too long prior and was very well received.   Basically, Nintendo could have reduced the backlash in two key ways. First, they could have released a demo publicly (on the eShop) to show people how the game plays and that it is fun. Secondly, they could have confirmed what Retro is working on or that there was another Metroid game in development, even if it won't be coming out in 2015 or early 2016.  Reggie did an interview with IGN saying that Nintendo wanted to focus on games that would be out within the next eight months or so for their Digital Event this year, which is why Zelda wasn't shown. Whether or not this means a Metroid title is in development for Holiday 2016 is unclear, but it could be a reason why one wasn't announced."

At the end of the demo, have a cameo and zoom out, fade in the game logo and then fade Metroid over it.  A lot of people were interested in the ""Metroid like"" blast ball, before it was Metroid blast ball."
Metroid,3acewv,electroplankton,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:57:19 2015 UTC,Funnily enough metroids appeared in the original demo but not in the actual game.
Metroid,3acewv,superhanson2,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:15:14 2015 UTC,They also could have made the game look more metroid like and not use chibi characters. That way it would seem like a true spin off instead of a random project with metroid slapped on top.
Metroid,3acewv,SercerferTheUntamed,6,Fri Jun 19 22:46:03 2015 UTC,"The entire kerfuffle about Blast ball/Metroid:FF could have been completely avoided if Nintendo said that they were working on a new title in the main series. No images, no gameplay, no title, nothing, would have be required beyond saying, we're making a real Metroid game, come play these expanded Metroid universe titles in the mean time."
Metroid,3acewv,sikaxis,3,Fri Jun 19 04:16:08 2015 UTC,All I remember was that I was pumped when I first played the demo for prime hunters. I had only played prime and fusion at that point and I couldn't wait to get my hands on the real game. When the game finally came out I was not dissapointed.
Metroid,3acewv,GoldRedBlue,3,Fri Jun 19 01:49:55 2015 UTC,"The only place I know that had a very negative reaction to Hunters was the Metroid board on IGN. To this day, Hunters is still derisively called ""Many Poor Hitmen"" over there.  On the other hand, the IGN Metroid board had (back in the early-mid 2000s) some of the most hardcore Metroid purists I've ever seen on the Internet. These guys criticized Metroid Prime 1 to hell and back. I'm talking about guys like Yodanut, MikesterX, DeicideIII, patper, and a few others I don't remember anymore. Yodanut actually created a website solely to post all his critiques of Metroid Prime back in the day.  They actually considered Prime 2 to be the best game of the trilogy, because it was the game that managed to evoke the most threatening and alien atmosphere that was most similar to Super Metroid in their opinion."
Metroid,3acewv,Anggul,2,Fri Jun 19 03:29:05 2015 UTC,"No, there was no reason to respond negatively. It had the look, it had a bunch of new, really cool bounty hunters, it sounded good."

Metroid,3ae63o,SqeeSqee,2,Fri Jun 19 12:55:04 2015 UTC,"I mean, co-op metroid doesn't have any relevance or ties to the normal metroid formula, it takes away your own personal experience and adventure. But federation force isn't a proper metroid game, so in it's own right, it's okay if it breaks the formula and adds a co-op element. Personally, I'm interested to see what Next level games can expand on this particular formula."

I just have a hard time being enthralled by a ""lobby, then 10 minutes of mission"" kind of game, and that's what it's looking like right now.  I've never really been in to traditional Mario games like 64 or Galaxy, where you have an overworld and little bite-sized smaller worlds all wanting you to complete a specific task, as I prefer games with a rich story or at least progression.  The Legend of Zelda offers this, and to-date Metroid has as well.  But now with Federation Force: Damage numbers? Customized load-outs? Individual missions?  If I want those experiences I'll pop in a copy of Call of Duty.    Now, if the game was more like what we saw in MP2: Echoes, with the troop transport landing, setting up a base camp (point defense style) and then heading out to accomplish objectives near the Landing Zone, I'd be all over that!  You could really feel like you were making progress, while still working cooperatively with your friends/bots.  Maybe as the game progressed, and you and your team traveled further and further from the LZ to complete increasingly difficult missions, they could even have some sort of story.  Why is the Federation having you capture 3 large ice creatures?  Why did the Space Pirates show up and what is their involvement/interest?  Perhaps there's a more secretive reason for your task force to have landed there?   I don't know, there's so many possibilities on the Galactic Federation side, that it'd be a terrible shame to toss that potential aside and just build a basic Co-Op arena PvE shooter."

The gameplay I've seen looks pretty dang boring and sluggish, but I guess that can change. For many fans, including myself, this game is setting the precedent for future chibi Metroid games. I, for one, like Metroid because it avoided that kind of art style and instead opted for a more serious, darker style."

It preserved the atmosphere of Prime, the enemies, the biomes, the soundtrack was either the same or similar, etc. It would have been a pleasant throwback to the golden age of Metroid games. I'd have still been disappointed in the lack of main story games, but prime pinball was an acceptable spinoff to me. FF's tone and art style is a jarring departure from those of the main installments."

If they were trying to guague metroid interest, they would be better off doing literally anything else. Nintendo may make dumb decisions from time to time, but they themselves aren't dumb enough to use the success of some small time spinoff that has completely different gameplay as the main determining factor as to whether they would make another main series metroid game."

I would have loved a proper game about being in a GF squad, trying to do your best when you aren't a powerful alien or a post-human in an alien power suit or whatever, with the same aesthetic style as the Prime games. The troopers we saw more of in Corruption looked amazing.  I don't dislike the graphic style (though this iteration is looking very ugly) but I do dislike the graphic style when used on Metroid which just doesn't suit it."

Metroid,3aax3b,LunarDistortion,0,Thu Jun 18 20:24:48 2015 UTC,"I partially agree, but Zelda fans are a little more toxic than that.  The problem with Zelda fans is that the fanbase has shifted to the point where most of them will eat anything up. Hyrule Warriors has NOTHING to do with Zelda gameplay-wise; it's just that everyone likes the characters, and for some reason that's enough.  What I've seen of the Metroid fanbase is that they don't want to be messed around. They want to continue the dark, hardcore gameplay, atmospheres and world of Metroid, whether it's a main entry or not. They're not willing to compromise for cutesy casual stuff, because they know it's not what they're fans of in the first place. I think this is a very healthy attitude for a fanbase. The Zelda fanbase is being manipulated, hard."
Metroid,3aax3b,LunarDistortion,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:47:34 2015 UTC,"It is certainly overblown, but I still think it was a bad move to bring back Metroid with a spinoff after a 5 year hiatus, especially after how controversial Other M was."
Metroid,3aax3b,LuxShadow1,2,Fri Jun 19 11:19:10 2015 UTC,"Character development issues aside, I personally found that game to be fun."
Metroid,3aax3b,throwawaymetroids,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:43:25 2015 UTC,"I can't comment due to not having played Other M, but it definitely split fan opinion and wasn't a very good note to leave the fanbase hanging on for so long. I think the FF trailer also kinda miffed Metroid fans by not including anything recognizably Metroid. Both of those factors sort of lead to the saltiness and backlash against FF.  I don't agree with it for the most part, but that's my viewpoint at the moment."
Metroid,3aax3b,SylvanHawk,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:43:15 2015 UTC,"EXACTLY!!! No one asked for Federation force, Nintendo could have made this it's one individual and unique IP, and expand on the formula and essentially have limitless options with the games development. Federation force was not the best Metroid game to release after 5 years."
Metroid,3aax3b,throwawaymetroids,0,Fri Jun 19 11:46:38 2015 UTC,"All this anger is really embarrassing to watch as both a long-time Metroid and Nintendo fan. The level of hate directed towards this title is totally uncalled for, and I'd feel horrible if I were one of the developers over at Next Level Games working on this project. Next Level has always delivered quality software, and it's unfair to them to judge their game so harshly almost a year away from its retail release.  Federation Force looks FUN (as long as it has voice chat...and online multiplayer...). Have you watched any of the gameplay yet?   People have mostly been ripping on this game due to the graphical style. I'm not crazy about chibis either, but it makes sense on such a low resolution screen, and the weak 3DS hardware. As you can see from the footage, the game is clearly still in development (muddy temporary-looking textures, some level geometry is missing, etc) and will likely have far greater graphical quality upon release. Remember the Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt demo? The graphics in that demo looked like ass, and the final product delivered some very impressive visuals for the platform it was on. I have no doubt that Next Level can deliver a great looking product, based on their previous work on the 3DS.  Since playing the Prime series I always thought a spinoff where you play as some Federation Marines would be neat. I'll probably be picking it up on the first week. Despite all the impotent rage, I'm sure this game will be a success on release. Save your tears for 2016."
Metroid,3aax3b,SylvanHawk,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:55:59 2015 UTC,The only part of the gameplay footage that looks tolerable to me is the space pirate fight at the end. Everything else looked like a chore. It doesn't help that movement speed and jump height seem to be 75% of what they should be to create a sufficiently exciting and hectic experience. Just my opinion.
Metroid,3afheo,Liamrun,3,Fri Jun 19 18:30:19 2015 UTC,"I don't want to sound like a jerk, but as much as we all felt this way, it's waaaaay past the point of these jokes still be relevant. I suggest we discuss about it instead of keep reacting alone."
Metroid,3afheo,V0ID115,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:45:12 2015 UTC,"First off, this was just an edit I made of some vine; this isn't a legit reaction to the E3 presentation lol. This was just a joke, and one that I think is still relevant. These announcements only happened like 3 or 4 days ago, so I don't understand how the point of the joke is no longer relevant (unless it was severely overdone).   I'd also like to discuss how bad Federation Force looks because i'm not one to simply meme and tell (if you catch my drift). I honestly love the Metroid series and I feel like FF looks like a sub-par iPhone game on the 3DS. From what I've seen, the game doesn't even possess the grittiness, exploration, and progression that all the Metroid games have. What makes it worse is that it's coming out in 2016. I just think that the developers really blew it. We wait 5 years for a new Metroid game & we get...this."
Metroid,3afheo,V0ID115,3,Fri Jun 19 22:50:01 2015 UTC,"(unless it was severely overdone).   Precisely my point, 40~+ reaction gifs to Nintendo's E3 has been popping up everywhere, here also.     Now, back to the actual point. I think it CAN be a good game, however it is being directed to the wrong people. You can't have a serious franchise like Metroid and expect people to accept the goofiness of Blast Ball and just say ""Oki-Doki then :3"". Should it be a stand alone game just called blast ball or whatever, it would attract casual players that would be more interested to buy the game. My faith on Nintendo has died long ago. What I'm interested right now are the studios developing said games."
Metroid,3ad91j,Lord_of_Phendrana,8,Fri Jun 19 04:14:07 2015 UTC,"Online multiplayer FPS + chibi characters + 3DS game to me all seem to point to this game being aimed at young western kids. The problem with the gameplay direction they chose for Federation Force basically boils down to Metroid Prime being a Metroid game first and FPS second, while Federation Force is a FPS first, Metroid game second. They are no more similar to each other than Super Mario World is to Super Metroid."
Metroid,3ad91j,MrKenta,6,Fri Jun 19 04:30:06 2015 UTC,"Funny thing. I recall reading an interview with a former Nintendo developer who told a story about a game they were tasked with making to rival Halo. That game was not in any way a Metroid game. Shortly after Reggie was hired, he came to visit them and asked if the game would actually work. Dev said no and they shifted focus to Resident Evil 4 instead.  I really don't think Nintendo has ever wanted to make Metroid play like Halo. I don't think even they know what they want Metroid to play like. Even FF doesn't really strike me as exceptionally Halo-like.   I think the reason fans compare the two is because they tend to focus around human armored badasses fighting a solo war against alien menaces and visiting and exploring strange, exotic worlds. But really, that's just a broad concept. Halo is very much more about the combat and the shooting, whereas Metroid focuses more on exploration and navigating this isolated environment. Combat takes a back seat in many cases except where bosses are concerned. Most players I see don't stop to kill everything they see in Zebes or on Talon IV. So they have a couple similar elements, but at their core they are widely different, as you say, and I believe Nintendo knows that... to some degree.   And just to touch on something, I wouldn't say Metroid is a more ""American"" game than a Japanese game. America isn't really a good representation of the rest of the world and there are plenty of people beyond our borders who enjoy the thrill and isolation of a good Metroid title."
Metroid,3ad91j,Ryuutakeshi,2,Fri Jun 19 07:59:31 2015 UTC,"American themes are pretty heavy in the series. I never said that the rest of the world was represented by America...I never said these elements are exclusive to our borders either. I am saying though that American cultural elements are deeply integrated in the lore. That it's not the FPS that makes it more appealing to Americans, it's the themes...and by trying to combat those with such contrary Japanese cultural elements is not working.  Also I'm not comparing Halo with Metroid. In fact I explicitly said that was redundant. I'm trying to say that when Prime came out Halo was in the process of setting the standard for FPS multiplayer gaming. And I'm suggesting Nintendo is confused because of this. Not that they don't know the game so much as they have misread the audience.  Sorry I wasn't more clear on all of that."
Metroid,3ad91j,Gmarcott42,5,Fri Jun 19 09:02:43 2015 UTC,"Are you serious?  What's with the Halo hate, or at least the comparisons to CoD?  The games are way more intelligent and nuanced than you seem to be giving them credit for.  I'm a metroid fan, but Halo is also high up there for me.  Would I like to see Metroid turn into Halo?  Of course not.  But that doesn't mean Halo is a dumb, generic FPS.  There's so much story and lore in the Halo universe, it's overwhelming.  I get the feeling you haven't actually played Halo, which is a shame because they are terrific games.  If the Metroid series continues with multiplayer (if its just deathmatch) then it certainly should take a look at Halo.  Excellent multiplayer functions, way beyond the gameplay itself.  Level design, forge, game mode design, etc...  In single player they are certainly different in terms of gameplay, but they may closer than you think."
Metroid,3ad91j,Gmarcott42,2,Fri Jun 19 04:59:30 2015 UTC,"Wow you completely misinterpreted my message. I don't even know where to begin. Sorry if I wasn't more clear, sorry you thought I was attacking Halo...  I love the original Halo and Halo 2 holds a special place in my life, as weird as that may sound. My gamertag was Thardus0 and I wrecked shit up....ah memories. Anyway, my point is that Halo and Metroid Prime are very different games but people used to compare the two relentlessly, and this was back when console wars mattered. I'm saying that's a mistake and they are completely different games. BUT Nintendo's Japanese-centric outlook may not understand that. For they give me the impression that they don't get what worked with the Metroid Prime trilogy at all. I'm saying that's how Nintendo see's Americans and that's how Nintendo see's FPS games in general.  Although I really don't want to get into a debate over Halo, I will argue that Halo is not that deep and definitely nothing ""overwhelming."" But that is a matter of taste, isn't it? Yeah, if it weren't for the multiplayer aspect, Halo would likely have died, and the 2000's would have never seen the surge of online multiplayer FPS that took over the gaming industry."
Metroid,3ad91j,xooxanthellae,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:15:36 2015 UTC,"Ah I see.  Sorry for the misunderstanding.  When I meant overwhelming and deep, I was talking about all the other lore outside of the games.  Regardless of whether you think its any good or not, there's a lot out there.  Metroid just doesn't really have non game sources of canon."
Metroid,3ad91j,Earth_Pony,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:22:29 2015 UTC,There are like a dozen+ Halo books and numerous movies / cartoons. The lore is pretty deep.
Metroid,3ad91j,Anggul,2,Fri Jun 19 08:30:32 2015 UTC,"I think you've summed it up excellently!  There is definitely a cultural component to the improperly marketed recent installments of the franchise.  And I could totally see a company that doesn't quite ""get"" why a game is popular assuming that success is the result of the surface-level similarities to other successful titles.    You'd need to intricately understand the appeal of Metroid games to U.S. fans before you could properly create a new game targeted at those consumers. (Heck, even as fans we have a hard time putting it into words what makes Metroid, Metroid.)  If your culture had no archetype for the ""space cowgirl"" type of character, then you'd probably have a difficult time understanding."
Metroid,3ab5ut,ZapDash,3,Thu Jun 18 17:56:19 2015 UTC,I seriously enjoyed my time with the attraction. Even in single player trying to get master rank. Though co-op and versus were more fun. I really liked the movement options you had playing on foot. And the boss fights were super fun. Defintiely cool.   I hope the game influences Federation Force.

Metroid,3adcof,Shotokanguy,3,Fri Jun 19 04:55:08 2015 UTC,"A reboot in my mind is best suited when there have been years of backstory and you need to clear way for something new. This is why comics do this a lot to clear some of the more convoluted plot elements.   Metroid on the other hand has never really had a very strict story to abide to, and from a narrative perspective is actually quite easy to work with. All you need is a new bounty to hunt and a new location. simple, yet effective ways to tell stories of the many planets that inhabit the universe."
Metroid,3adcof,Mortimer42,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:07:05 2015 UTC,"But this series has never been about Samus just doing bounty hunting. Its always had her trying to prevent the spread of some highly dangerous enemy or creature, usually with Metroids playing a role.  There are themes worth digging into there, too. Metroids can potentially do great things in that universe, but are dangerous if mishandled. They're almost a metaphor for nuclear power."
Metroid,3adcof,SeanRK1994,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:14:44 2015 UTC,"Almost? They're not even a metaphor, they ARE the Metroid universe's weapons of mass destrucion. There's also the sanctity of life thing mentioned earlier. It's one of the few points of characterization from Other M that wasn't complete shit. Samus was shown all the way back in fusion to be opposed to using living things as weapons, or even experimenting on them in general. To me, it's clear that she would rather not exterminate the metroids, but they pose too great a risk. She isn't just saving the universe from the metroids, she was saving the metroids from the universe. She doesn't seem to have the same regard for non-sentient life though, like she believes the X to be. I have a theory on them though"
Metroid,3adcof,Wind123,4,Fri Jun 19 18:59:34 2015 UTC,"Nah man.  I appreciate your points but, as the other posters have said, a reboot works when there's a huge(ly convoluted) story already. Metroid doesn't have that. The plot is fairly simple.  Besides, one of the main issues I had with Other M was that there was too much reliance on nostalgia for the older games, and it sometimes flat out lifted plot points from other games in the series (Fusion comes to mind). It didn't feel like a love letter, but a butchered attempt to tell a story twice.   There's plenty of room in the current storyline for new things. And there actually are intriguing questions which I hope could be answered, especially if Nintendo decides to expand the universe more.  Who is Sylux? What happens to Samus after Fusion? What was the Horus Rebellion?  Samus' origin story would be cool, but I feel as if the series needs to more first well, first."
Metroid,3adcof,Anggul,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:49:27 2015 UTC,I have never heard of the Horus Rebellion. Is that a 40k reference or something?
Metroid,3adcof,Wind123,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:27:11 2015 UTC,"We think so.  One fleet trooper on the Olympus in MP3 is talking to another, and mentions the Horus Rebellion in comparison to the pirate attacks. It's hinted to be a huge battle, since it was the last time before the present that so many Federation fighters had been scrambled."
Metroid,3adcof,badgeometry,2,Fri Jun 19 14:12:03 2015 UTC,"I think what you're asking for could be done with a prequel instead of a full series reboot. Samus' story isn't even that long compared to most other franchise game characters.  We got 4 main series games (for narrative purposes I'm considering NES Metroid and Zero Mission the same game), the Prime trilogy + Hunters, which are effectively one arc, Other M, and Pinball, which is just fluff.  I'd only call for a full series reboot if the next several games were Other M bad.  All that being said, it would be interesting to see Samus' origin done in game form. Don't know how you'd do it, but it mite b cool."
Metroid,3adcof,cephalopodAscendant,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:41:34 2015 UTC,"Do we need to reboot the series? Her origin story could easily be handled without wiping out the continuity we already have. Other missions unrelated to the Mother Brain story arc can be slotted in between the games we already have. The only game that outright needs to go is Other M, and considering all the backlash, Nintendo may choose to let it quietly slide out of canon anyways."
Metroid,3adcof,cephalopodAscendant,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:34:53 2015 UTC,"Slotting in more games between other games would actually make the whole story sillier and more convoluted, IMO. It's already silly that the Prime trilogy happens between Metroid and Metroid 2."

As disappointed as I am that Federation Force is what we're getting, I'm sure it'll be a fine game in the end, and I definitely wouldn't want it cancelled.  Where Nintendo failed was in the presentation.  I thought Squeenix was gonna pull the same thing when they announced a Kingdom Hearts mobile game. I thought that was it and KH fans would have to keep waiting for KH3, but just kidding! Then they showed the trailer for KH3 and the audience lost it.  That's what Nintendo should have done. Unfortunately, you need to have a main title in development to even pull something like that."
Metroid,3aaqgt,badgeometry,2,Thu Jun 18 20:01:44 2015 UTC,"The thing is with your Squeenix example is that now, no one is talking about Star Ocean or that new IP. Everyone is talking about Kingdom Hearts 3. Hell, no one is even talking about the KH mobile game even though it might be good. KH3 overshadowed everything, but the game isn't even coming out anytime soon (probably not for a year and a half or 2 years). That's not good because SE really doesn't need people to be talking about KH3 right now."
Metroid,3aaqgt,Hibbity5,2,Fri Jun 19 03:20:59 2015 UTC,"I mean, even if KH3 wasn't announced, the FF7 reveal would still beat out Star Ocean in hype factor.  And with regards to their new IP, we don't even have a final name. There's really not much people can get excited about except for some concept art. It might even be a completely different game if/when they show it off next year. The KH3 reveal had gameplay.  Star Ocean is still happening, and KH3 hype isn't gonna make it un-happen.  Bringing this back to the big N, if Nintendo did announce a main series Metroid game. A new Metroid is not gonna take away any steam from the Star Fox hype train or the Mario Maker train.

People have been wanting Star Fox for longer than Metroid and we're getting it. People wanted Mother 3. Nintendo has to translate that but they're giving us the next best thing, Mother 1 since it's already translated. People have been asking for a Mario level editor for who knows how long. And we're getting something that far surpasses anything we could have wanted since it has 4 game styles and can exceed what the original games can even do.

And since were on the topic, I feel Nintendo isn't doing the best job with appealing to its more hardcore fan base, like its not awful but it could be much better. They appeal to kids and families extremely well, but it seems Nintendo doesn't wanna also appeal to the more mature audiences. And I don't mean mature as in Rated M I mean mature as in... Not children.  I only hope that their next console also appeals to their more mature audience. Again, not mature as in gorey, violent, rated M."

If that's the case, they should make the game a launch title. It would give people picking up the system incentive to buy the game, which could open the franchise up to people who may have skipped it in the past.  Still, we're not sure when the NX is going to be released, and we don't know anything about Nintendo's plans for future Metroid titles."
Metroid,3aa7f6,masamunecyrus,0,Thu Jun 18 13:36:17 2015 UTC,"Except there's evidence that hints at a 2016 holiday release for the NX, and Tanabe stated that if they started a Metroid game now it wouldn't be ready until 2018/2019 which kinda makes me think that Metroid won't be a launch title."
Metroid,3aa7f6,Chaotix23,5,Thu Jun 18 15:25:44 2015 UTC,"That assumes that they're just now starting.   I'm a huge Animal Crossing fan, and I'm pretty let down on the lack of animal crossing news. I doubt, at this point, we will get an Animal Crossing for the Wii U. Animal Crossing is a system seller, and Wii U has entered its twilight years, I suppose.   But Nintendo has clearly been working on a new console Animal Crossing for a few years, now. It may not be in full production--who knows--but the free downloadable Animal Crossing Plaza channel on the Wii U required that the make HD assets for every single character in the game, plus some trees and grass. In Mario Kart, they further made more assets, and now this Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival game has even more assets. Since I somehow doubt that Nintendo has spent all this time making HD Animal Crossing assets for the amiibo party game, that suggests that there's a dev team working on the next console version.   Metroid could be similar. Who knows, really, but Nintendo always has a lot of projects that it works on in secret. It could have been in development for a while."

We have yet to have a proper 2.5D Metroid game (Smash Bros is 2.5D, Other M isn't.)  Anyway the point is not what arbitrary number we give a game, but that just because a Metroid Prime game isn't currently in development doesn't mean we aren't getting an Other M style game, or a Metroid II remake in 2.5D, or something."

The fact that Metroid Prime 4 is only just now being considered makes me really doubt it could be a launch title.  But honestly I think Metroid Prime 4 SHOULD be a launch title. I think it would interest a lot of gamers who maybe haven't played metroid before, but want the NX at launch."

Metroid,3aa7f6,Lord_of_Phendrana,2,Fri Jun 19 00:16:46 2015 UTC,"Well remember that Prime was released at the very beginning of the GameCube's lifespan.

Metroid,3aa7f6,vhwatgoes,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:00:28 2015 UTC,"I'll give you that it was launched early o  the life cycle, which gives it an advantage.   But the rest of your argument is ""Prime was really good and pretty, so it sold well."" Which is basically what I'm saying, the success of the console is not directly correlated with the success of the game (if the game is good enough).   If an excellent game were released for Wii U, I think the starved metroid fan base would eat that shit up like they did with Prime."
Metroid,3aa7f6,tccrist,3,Fri Jun 19 13:22:33 2015 UTC,"Your right but heres another side of the coin. Now that the suspense has been tightened this much, if the reveal of the next Metroid is nothing short of stellar, it will never live up to the hype built after all this time.

Same goes for their ridiculous marketing with the DS: ""I already have a DS, how is the DS Lite/DSi/3DS/2DS/new 3DS different?""  Nintendo has rarely followed a conventional naming system, and should stick with that plan. People know that the Super Nintendo, N64, and Gamecube are all different systems.

Metroid,3aa7f6,Garbagehead4,-2,Fri Jun 19 15:28:26 2015 UTC,"This is an optimistic view on the situation but that means waiting several more years in addition to the 8 we've been waiting since Corruption. I'm getting too old.  In regards to the Wii U selling on 9.5 million compared to the Wii's 100 million, I feel like that's Nintendo's fault. Why the hell would you rename your new console the same name as your most recent one? And there was no must have titles near launch at all.  Nintendo should go the way of Sega and give up consoles and sell their franchises IMO."
Metroid,3aa7f6,synthieval,2,Thu Jun 18 13:38:19 2015 UTC,"I agree, from a marketing standpoint, Nintendo did an awful job with the Wii U.  It's essentially turned into an awkward tweener system that exists somewhere between last gen and this gen and third party developers never knew what to do with it.   I wouldn't be opposed to Nintendo simply becoming a game maker, but that doesn't seem to be happening any time soon."
Metroid,3aa7f6,legacygrim,3,Thu Jun 18 13:44:32 2015 UTC,"Ideally they could give up the home console war and focus on handhelds. They've always been the best at that and they could focus on putting out better games. And every franchise could be represented well on their next portable.  Pokemon has always been at home on handhelds and the latest iterations are looking great. As a preteen playing Pokemon Stadium 1 back in the day, I never though they would have been able to develop that same level of detail on a portable system. And the latest Pokemon game, PokeTekken, is basically being made by a third party developer for arcades. Pokemon is just one example of a Nintendo IP doing well in outside hands.  Metroid 2D sidescrollers could flourish on the next Nintendo portable. There's really no excuse for them not making one since Zero Mission (2004). How much work does it take to animate pixels and create MIDI soundtracks? (maybe I'm ignorant but it doesn't seem like much) Hell, independent modders have created their own Metroid games since then.   And I would be all for more Metroid Prime: Hunters spinoffs too. With better graphics and more players able to play in matches (from 4 to 10 or something), I could see the games being very fun. And no chibi art direction please.  Mario and Zelda both have portables and consoles down pat."
Metroid,3aa7f6,synthieval,5,Thu Jun 18 13:58:01 2015 UTC,"Here's my other theory on this though.  They literally don't know what to do with Metroid anymore.  Because, what is one of the best aspects of Super Metroid and Metroid Prime - two of the greatest video games ever made? There's no hand holding, and these games respect you as a gamer. Both of these games aren't afraid to let the player fail, feel a true sense of isolation, and experiment with new techniques. They really do rely on the intelligence of you, the gamer. Super Metroid was a game that showed you how to play it as you were playing it. It gave you a new ability and then immediately forced you to use it. You'd then say to yourself ""hey, that's pretty awesome, how else can I use this new tool?"" I've never seen a game perfect this technique so well. Prime 1 came close.  Nintendo knows that this is what made these games so incredible. Currently, video games are in an era of extreme hand holding. Often the first one or two hours spent with a game include a slow tutorial and allows the gamer to become acclimated to their new environment. This movement has all been in an attempt to capture that new 'casual' sector of the market. This divergence, which I believe Nintendo is aware of, is one of the reasons why a new brilliant Metroid game has not been developed.  I don't think that Nintendo knows how to reconcile that sense of loneliness and isolation in the best Metroid games with the new direction many games are taking that very often show the player how to win and doesn't let them fail."

The demo consisted of 3 training modules (something like a short level, a survival mode, and a timed morphball run.) They all got boring eventually, but the demo also came with a multilayer mode with some items that never made it into the final game.  You unlocked the cut scene by getting a high score in all three training modules."

What FF feels like to me, Nintendo:  https://youtu.be/wK4atwOxCZQ?t=19  I can't believe they resorted to naming the characters colors.

Metroid,3aa8ya,Zarantyr,3,Thu Jun 18 15:56:07 2015 UTC,The metroid fanbase is very passionate. we may come off whiny but its cause we care about this game alot :c
Metroid,3aa8ya,Divemissile,4,Thu Jun 18 15:39:36 2015 UTC,You're impressed by a bunch of people whining about a game that's still in development?
Metroid,3aa8ya,SurvivuL,5,Thu Jun 18 23:28:12 2015 UTC,"I think you should be the one fucking your self. Nearly everyone that is complaining about FF has no REASONABLE EVIDENCE behind their complaints. Everyone (including you) has said ""Oh we've waited nearly ten years and this is what we get??"" or ""It doesn't look like a Metroid game, so it isn't one.."". The developers themselves addressed these complaints in many interviews, one of the bigger ones on Kotaku. A dev said that he himself didn't think it was a Metorid game until he actually played it for himself. He goes more in-depth on the article. Their is also a reason it was developed for the 3DS and that's why the game is small and ONLY on 3DS. I really wish all the so called 'Hardcore Fans' would look up more facts about the game and watch more gameplay instead of jumping to shitty conclusions. Thanks for reading."
Metroid,3aa8ya,AtomKick,-1,Thu Jun 18 15:54:06 2015 UTC,"It's Nintendo's own fucking fault dude. If the game really is so great, and really is like a Metroid title, then why the hell didn't they show us any of the good parts? Why did they only show us blast ball and a couple of shitty missions?  Idk how you can fucking blame us for reacting to what we are shown. Its not like we had a choice in that matter."
Metroid,3aa8ya,SurvivuL,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:43:52 2015 UTC,"No it's not Nintendo's fault, dude. They released a small trailer highlighting the main feature of the game, 4 player co-op. AND the game is still in development and is not even close to completion. They released the missions because those are the ones close to remotely finished. I am blaming you for reacting because you all acted like selfish, spoiled, little kids that didn't get what flavored ice cream they wanted. The fans OVERREACTED way too much and the petition is ridiculous and childish. If you want to make a difference, do it with your wallet, that's what matters in this day and age. And I and 5k+ others reacted fine, and are supporting and interested in the game."
Metroid,3aa8ya,AtomKick,-2,Thu Jun 18 23:12:32 2015 UTC,"Look out, your fanboy is showing"
Metroid,3aa8ya,SurvivuL,2,Fri Jun 19 00:09:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fanboy, never played any of the games. I just like the look of FF and hate people that jump to conclusions. Its a large part of what's wrong with society today."
Metroid,3aa8ya,Mortimer42,0,Fri Jun 19 00:34:13 2015 UTC,"I haven't really played any metroid games before, but I'm looking to start now."
Metroid,3aa8ya,hipstercabbage,6,Thu Jun 18 13:43:21 2015 UTC,If you have a WiiU they recently put out the Metroid Prime Trilogy. Prime 1 is one of my favorite games of all time.  Or if you want to start at the humble 2D origins Super Metroid is really good and easy to get.
Metroid,3aa8ya,Moulinoski,4,Thu Jun 18 13:49:22 2015 UTC,I will have to do that. It's really cool that they have all three games for a low price on the virtual console and I've heard noting but good things about super metroid.
Metroid,3aa8ya,thearchermage,4,Thu Jun 18 13:52:30 2015 UTC,Fusion is also on the Wii U so you should definitely try that after Super. I don't know if they've released Zero Mission for purchase but you can probably just emulate that.
Metroid,3abmcy,stealthsock,2,Thu Jun 18 19:55:22 2015 UTC,"Also check out Axiom Verge, which released for PC a couple months ago. It's basically a love letter to the Metroid series, with its own twist on things.  and check out Cave Story as well if you haven't already heard of that."
Metroid,3abmcy,SamusAranX,2,Fri Jun 19 05:40:30 2015 UTC,Isn't it sad to see that Metroid lives on only outside of Metroid?

Metroid,3abmcy,TweetPoster,-1,Thu Jun 18 19:56:46 2015 UTC,"It may be a low-rent indie Metroid, but it's much closer to the 2D games than any Prime."
Metroid,3aahzg,DaleLeatherwood,7,Thu Jun 18 14:59:28 2015 UTC,"Kind of. I just want to know why they weren't already working on it two or three years ago so it could be coming out this or next year. Were they THAT worried about the low sales of the wii u even back then and didn't want to bother with a game?  I'll look forward to a real HD metroid prime game, but I have to question why we don't already have one in the works."
Metroid,3aahzg,Ninjatertl,3,Thu Jun 18 15:11:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  Especially because Retro Studios is up to something.  I doubt they delayed a WiiU game completely.  Maybe they just are not working on Metroid and will announce something soon.  It seems like Tanabe said that he could not get a team for Metroid, so maybe Retro is working on something else."
Metroid,3aahzg,johnnyFyeah,7,Thu Jun 18 15:35:22 2015 UTC,WTF I just got my Wii U in January and people are already talking about next gen...?!?!!!!!!
Metroid,3aahzg,Pringle-Brule,5,Thu Jun 18 17:29:30 2015 UTC,Me too! I'd like Nintendo to give attention to the Wii U for the next few years before focusing on next gen.   I'd rather have a Metroid game late in the Wii U's cycle if anything. But at least I have the Prime Trilogy to hold me over for a bit.
Metroid,3aahzg,AtomKick,2,Thu Jun 18 20:05:17 2015 UTC,You can thank Nintendo later.
Metroid,3aahzg,plasmabeamonline,3,Thu Jun 18 19:53:18 2015 UTC,"Here's to hoping it's HD, Prime-esque, and has compelling multiplayer.  A man can dream."
Metroid,3aahzg,badwolf422,2,Thu Jun 18 15:24:21 2015 UTC,"Seriously, a space exploration adventure with amazing graphics and federation force multiplayer.  If this game launches with the NX, Nintendo will have a successful console that might even outsell the WiiU in the first year."
Metroid,3aahzg,Masterofknees,3,Thu Jun 18 15:36:23 2015 UTC,"It's a little early to say (We don't know what the NX even IS), but I think it's probably for the best as well. Everyone took that delay announcement to mean ""NO PRIME 4 FOR WII U IN DEVELOPMENT! DOOOOOM FOR THE SERIES! METROID IS DEAD!"" I really don't understand that jump in logic.  Despite Smash, the Wii U is a dying console. A Metroid title on it would probably get overlooked by the general playerbase who are focused on other AAA titles and hardware right now."
Metroid,3aahzg,jbs1,5,Thu Jun 18 15:51:13 2015 UTC,"I'd rather that they release it early during the NX's lifespan than they release it late for the Wii U, don't want one of those Twilight Princess scenarios, so yes, given current circumstances I'm fine with it.   It's still a shame that Metroid will miss out on a console generation again, it's kind of unbelievable that Other M has had a similar effect on the franchise as Gunpei Yokoi's death."
Metroid,3aahzg,badwolf422,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:45:06 2015 UTC,"Right, I also agree that it would be better to launch earlier on the NX than later on the Wii U lifecycle.  However, given the state of things, it's possible it wouldn't even be developed for the NX at all, which would be much worse."
Metroid,3aahzg,AtomKick,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:17:50 2015 UTC,"Exactly. This is the twilight of the Wii U, a console practically no one has anyway. A Metroid released now would probably get buried under everything else and sell like crap."
Metroid,3aahzg,henryuuk,0,Thu Jun 18 15:47:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  You hit it perfectly.  Better early on the NX than late on the WiiU.  I will say that I think there is probably another Metorid game in the works, but more likely a 2d side-scroller for the 3DS."
Metroid,3aahzg,henryuuk,2,Thu Jun 18 15:54:37 2015 UTC,"I agree. I'm not in a hurry for a new metroid game so long as its good. There are so many games coming out in the next couple of years, so its not like I'll have nothing to play while I wait.  I'm most afraid that they will try to change the core metroid formula in an attempt to revamp the series or something, and that they will ditch the metroidvania style exploration/collection. But I honestly don't trust Nintendo anymore when it comes to metroid... They'll have to earn the trust back."
Metroid,3aahzg,Chaosbrae,2,Thu Jun 18 19:56:23 2015 UTC,They didn't confirm we WOULD be getting a prime on nx though. That one guy just said it would be the most likely assuming he had to start production on it now
Metroid,3aahzg,devosion,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:31:40 2015 UTC,"Very true, but if they skip the WiiU, even Nintendo is not foolish enough to skip their next generation too.  Not with a key franchise like Metroid."
Metroid,3aahzg,TheLostWolf,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:29:54 2015 UTC,"You say key, but many of the metroids really didn't sell that amazing. It's a mid to low b-list franchise"
Metroid,3aahzg,vhwatgoes,2,Fri Jun 19 15:07:50 2015 UTC,If the NX really ends up replacing the wii u as early as everyone seems to think it will I'll probably be done buying Nintendo consoles. I was really hopeful when I bought my wii u and now two years later I only have 4 games for it. There's no way I'm going to dish out another ~$400 in hopes that I might get to play two or three more games. Nintendo has been making some nasty missteps
Metroid,3a810u,RidleyBro,27,Wed Jun 17 23:17:42 2015 UTC,"I remember Other M, and the savage fracturing of the community in its wake.  I had no idea Nintendo had something worse in store for us."

The dialogue is excellent and really sums up the presiding feelings among Metroid fans at the moment.  Well done!  So yes, I'm less worried about what they'll do next, and more worried that there won't be a 'next'.  Just like Half-Life 3 has no chance in hell of living up to expectations, any proper Metroid game now, no matter how good, would be torn to bits by the fan community.  After long periods of dormancy, I think we forgot that people enjoy different aspects of the series.  It's easy to agree that we dislike something but it takes a concerted effort to find things we appreciate, and that's a level of maturity that I'm afraid is lacking among Metroid fans."

Metroid,3a5ydz,DorgeFarlin,13,Thu Jun 18 08:56:57 2015 UTC,"The worst part is that not buying it may be seen by Nintendo as ""No interest in Metroid"" and kill the series for good. It's illogical and terrible, but wouldn't be the first time a franchise was killed off after a terrible entry that shouldn't have had the name in the first place."
Metroid,3a5ydz,Polantaris,21,Wed Jun 17 22:10:57 2015 UTC,Why do people keep saying this? Nintendo isn't made of imbeciles. They're not some machine that does market research solely by looking at sales data.

Metroid,3a5ydz,henryuuk,0,Thu Jun 18 07:02:18 2015 UTC,"Just because they haven't done it in the past doesn't mean that they won't do it in the future. Nintendo is first and foremost a company. Their goal is to make money. They aren't some magical Gaming God-like entity that will do everything every niche gamer wants. People need to stop holding them up to this magical standard, because they haven't fulfilled most of the expectations in some time. The Wii U is already dead. They need to get their shit in gear and they aren't. They've been making mistakes for years. There's nothing that says that this won't be another one.  Additionally, just because I can't think of a spin off example doesn't mean one doesn't exist. I just haven't paid enough attention to Nintendo in some time, because they have barely anything interesting anymore.  The fact of the matter for Metroid is that Other M was a piece of shit, and after Other M's abysmal failure, we haven't see another real Metroid game since. Instead, we've gotten a crappy Nintendo Land Metroid stamped ""game"", and another game plastered with Metroid at the last second. Currently, Metroid is dead. Everything points to that. They can give all the interviews and ""leaks"" they want, but unless they show us cold hard facts with video showing a legitimate Metroid game, it's true. Interviews with hypothetical situations for making a Metroid game are just that, hypothetical."

""Oh, I guess our fans don't want a 'Metroid' game."" Nintendo has a long long history of going one way when fans clearly want another. Sometimes to the point that it baffles other companies within its own industry."
Metroid,3a5ydz,Chozo_Joe,5,Wed Jun 17 16:37:39 2015 UTC,"so are you saying we should buy the game even though we don't like it? Iwata heard and talked about the fans disappointment after E3, if this trend sticks hopefully they'll hear our complaints about this Metroid spinoff. I seriously doubt that Nintendo would think that Metroid, one of their most beloved franchises, wouldn't have anyone buying it because their spinoff handheld game didn't sell. that's honestly just a stupid assumption."
Metroid,3a5ydz,mmakk36,3,Wed Jun 17 18:08:45 2015 UTC,"You're right. They don't get the assumption that Metroid wouldn't sell because a spinoff didn't sell well.  They get the assumption that Metroid wouldn't sell because the series as a whole has never really been a best seller, especially in Japan (which is who they clearly pay attention to most). It could explain why they're a little wary to continue making games, and could be using this game as a way to test the waters (or broaden the audience)."

Metroid,3a5ydz,ByToutatis,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:07:30 2015 UTC,"I feel Nintendo's model seems to still be based on how gaming was in the 90's.

Gaming has changed drastically from the 90's and Nintendo's model isn't viable anymore at all."
Metroid,3a5ydz,Eddy_Sc,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:26:43 2015 UTC,What is their model?
Metroid,3a5ydz,Frandaman760,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:42:15 2015 UTC,"More centralized, with less player feedback and more focused in the design team's own decisions, also acting like youtubers owe Nintendo something instead of taking the opportunity of turning them into free advertising.  I do have hope that things are changing. A re-release of Mother, this time with an official translation, does smell a bit of ""we are listening to your feedback, sorry for being deaf for so long"".  EDIT: oh, there's also the fact that most of their games seem to still indicate a thought that the core gaming market is still made up of children. Of course, their games at at least really fun children's/family-friendly games, so that isn't really bad, just a characteristic of the company, but still can be seen as an indication of 90's-style work model."

These ideas aren't even remotely familiar with the Metroid brand we know and love, and it seems like these new gameplay styles, should be been created through a new IP altogether, instead of slapping the Metroid name onto the game."

Metroid,3a5ydz,NOBLExGAMER,7,Wed Jun 17 17:53:27 2015 UTC,"It's a spin-off dealing with the Federation, a group that has been present in many of the Metroid games but never really fleshed out, people need to stop acting like this is Metroid Prime 4 and realize it's a side story where you play as a Federation soldier so you aren't going to have the freedoms or power of a professional bounty hunter like Samus. I'd really like to point out as well that Halo did this exact same thing with ODST and it was still deserving of the Halo name in every way yet here everybody is flaying a game before it's even released because it wasn't exactly what they asked for. It's a Metroid game, it may not be the one that you wanted but that's what it is and I'm actually excited for it because of who it involves, who is developing it, and that it lets me play with my friends. I realize a lot of people are pissed about Federation Force but what I think they are really pissed at is the lack of a main series title which I will say they have every right to, Nintendo should have announced or at least teased Metroid Prime 4 after showing off Federation Force but misdirecting anger at a game that isn't even out yet accomplishes nothing. Tell Nintendo that you're pissed about the lack of a main series title but don't berate a game you haven't even played because it wasn't exactly what you wanted."
Metroid,3a5ydz,Frandaman760,3,Thu Jun 18 03:23:16 2015 UTC,"People say they are slapping the name on there but honestly it looks like the game was built from the ground up as a Metroid Prime game. The second I saw ""Blast Ball"" in NWC, I thought of Prime. The controls(how they move), the aesthetics and in particular, the HUD looks made me think Metroid Prime.   And you do realize that Blast Ball is not the whole game, right? Federation Force is apparently the main attraction, and it looks like an multiplayer Metroid game in a similar vein to Nintendo World.    If I had to guess, they wanted to make a multiplayer shooter from the Prime series that they could market to everyone like Splatoon. And this is what they came up with."
Metroid,3a5ydz,LuxShadow1,2,Thu Jun 18 02:37:51 2015 UTC,"Look, I'm willing to give Metroid Prime: Federation Force a shot, accept the different gameplay style and genuinely have a good time. but I will never accept this game being a 'true' Metroid game. I'm sure many other people feel the same."
Metroid,3a5ydz,jacobs0n,4,Thu Jun 18 03:09:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think they marketed it as a 'true' Metroid game. It is what it is, a spin-off."
Metroid,3a5ydz,MasterEmp,2,Thu Jun 18 05:44:10 2015 UTC,"It annoys me that people are making assumptions about the gameplay of Fed Force. We've barely seen 30 seconds of actual gameplay, and half of that was of the minigames within the game (Blast Ball.) This may not be the isolation, adventure, exploration, game we wanted, but it can still be an army-themed, action, exploration, spin-off."
Metroid,3a5ydz,Ninjatertl,4,Wed Jun 17 19:38:58 2015 UTC,"They put out 12 minutes of gameplay yesterday, mate."
Metroid,3a5ydz,MindOverManter,3,Wed Jun 17 23:58:43 2015 UTC,"""12 minuets of gameplay"" and it still looks like the same thing from the trailer."
Metroid,3a5ydz,Ninjatertl,4,Thu Jun 18 01:16:58 2015 UTC,Well then it was a successful trailer.

Metroid,3a5ydz,white-mane,0,Wed Jun 17 21:18:32 2015 UTC,"I commented in another thread yesterday that they should just change the name of the game. That way, work already done on it isn't lost and Metroid can still be awesome without it."
Metroid,3a5ydz,DarkSamus987,15,Thu Jun 18 01:10:42 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping they either:   If they are going to keep the game the same as those videos, take the Metroid name off. If it has to be a Metroid game. At least make it look like one. The co-op stuff playing as the Federation is not the problem, the dated graphics, poor design choices and the fact that 'blast ball' is a part of the game is ruining it.   They can still fix it. Just drop the chibi crap and make it a Metroid Republic Commando or something more authentic to the franchise."
Metroid,3a5ydz,allnose,3,Wed Jun 17 16:04:51 2015 UTC,"I was thinking ""Metroid Dead Space"" would be most appropriate for a Federation title. You're the team that gets sent in before Samus would."

Metroid,3a5ydz,DarkSamus987,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:17:07 2015 UTC,"Hence my second point, since the world of Metroid isn't relative to Federation Force at the moment."
Metroid,3a5ydz,Duese,58,Thu Jun 18 05:40:18 2015 UTC,"Before you continue to call people children and saying that this is ""what we're being reduced to"", how about we look into a bit more than just what's on the surface.  The success or failure of this game can and will effect the possibility and time frame for the next REAL metroid game.  This game is NOT a metroid game and yet it's success or failure is linked directly to the Metroid IP.  Further to that, when a game who has an established IP changes the target audience of that design, it also sets them up for failure.  By turning the game away from being built on a Metroid design and into something ... else... it's creating the possibility of destroying itself as well as the Metroid IP as well.  In the TV world, this game would be moment when Nintendo jumped the shark with the IP.  They are trying to reinvent the metroid IP into something else in hopes of expanding the audience of the game.  Depending on how far away they are jumping, they can and will upset the current audience.  We're in a market right now where longstanding IP's are dominating because they are sticking to their design and target audience.  Everything from CoD to Witcher 3 to Assassin's Creed are building on their own designs to further advance their IP.  This is what we were looking at going into E3, so when the result is so damn far off of the expectation, then there is something wrong.  That's even to the point where they shouldn't have built up the hype of a metroid game to be released at E3 that was nothing more than a glorified FTP game.  When you say that ""people complain that all Nintendo does is release the same games over and over"", it must ignore the subreddit that we're in because Other M, whether you love it or hate it, sure as hell wasn't anything like it's previous releases.  They DID do something different with it but at the same time, it was still built off of the Metroid design.  People begging for the game to be cancelled isn't realistic and they know that.  What they are doing is showing their disagreement with Nintendo's choices with the IP.  Again, it shouldn't be a shock to anyone on this subreddit that people have strong opinions to the point of wishing certain games didn't even exist.  All of this is just feedback to Nintendo and it's feedback being sent to them in different ways and at different levels.  Nintendo will pay attention to that feedback and it will be a factor in their decisions going forward.  It may or may not change their decisions going forward, but this feedback has a strong correlation with the success or failure of their games.  I know this is a lot longer than you probably want to read, but just realize that people can be upset and be justified for being upset.  They don't have to give a game a fair shot and it's perfectly reasonable for them not to.  Nintendo is the one who made the decision and this feedback is the result of that decision."
Metroid,3a5ydz,throwacloset,11,Wed Jun 17 16:24:40 2015 UTC,"This is far from the first time Nintendo (or any company really) has done a spin-off of their own IP.  Mario probably has more spin-offs than mains series titles at this point.  Pokemon has the Rumble and Mystery Dungeon games.  Zelda has ""Link's Crossbow Training"" which is looking to be closest in quality to this game.  Nintendo is no more trying to turn the Metroid franchise into Federation Force than they are turning Pokemon into windup toys.   Also your accusation of Nintendo building up hype for a new Metroid game to be revealed at E3 is entirely false.  The expectations of a new Metroid reveal were 100% fan created.  Nintendo never hyped this game up as a new main title Metroid.  Heck, when they first revealed it at the NWC the Metroid connection was hidden entirely."
Metroid,3a5ydz,Rimas_LXBYA,11,Wed Jun 17 19:30:37 2015 UTC,"Everything you say is valid, but the problem here isn't that a spinoff exists, it's that after a 5 year drought of Metroid games, the first game to come out doesn't even look like it has its usual target audience, and since the fan base doesn't want to buy it, they're afraid that this will either steer the IP to a new cartoony course or falsely make Nintendo think that the Metroid IP just isn't making them money and make the drought longer.  No one here had a problem with Metroid Prime Pinball, a spinoff game that came out when everyone was still happy with Metroid Prime 2 and had no doubt that the series would live on."
Metroid,3a5ydz,StormyWaters2021,8,Wed Jun 17 22:51:45 2015 UTC,"the problem here isn't that a spinoff exists, it's that after a 5 year drought of Metroid games, the first game to come out doesn't even look like it has its usual target audience   Why do we have to keep explaining this point? Every thread is ""it's not like they don't make spinoffs from other IPs"" and ""Yeah, but Metroid hasn't had a proper main-series game in years"".   You're spot-on. We wanted a new main-series game, and a spinoff would be amazing on top of that."
Metroid,3a5ydz,LegacyLemur,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:19:58 2015 UTC,"I have no damn idea.  Remember when Mario is Missing was launched with the SNES instead of Super Mario World?

Metroid,3a5ydz,LegacyLemur,2,Thu Jun 18 00:56:14 2015 UTC,We got Crossbow training for the Wii after the beast that was Twilight Princess.  Its perfectly 100% understandable for Nintendo fans to expect a regular Metroid game. This is your first goddamn HD system and theres been 4 Metroid games on the last two home consoles.  This game would have been fine had it been released after or during the development of a wii u Metroid title. But this is a joke
Metroid,3a5ydz,Dubiono,21,Thu Jun 18 00:52:51 2015 UTC,That petition is the one part of this outrage that I've been fully ashamed by.   Not like it will change anything. Why stop the project this late into development and throw all that money away.
Metroid,3a5ydz,TheBenjay,6,Wed Jun 17 15:02:22 2015 UTC,"Literally all they have to do is change the title and people won't be mad.  Edit: I've thought about this more, and what doesn't need to happen is the removal of Federation Force. People would not be angered when they saw that game if they did what they should have done; revealed a Metroid 5 or Prime 4 that was revealed before FF."
Metroid,3a5ydz,The1calledLabz,14,Wed Jun 17 15:23:14 2015 UTC,"I imagine it's a bit more than the title, as they've probably used the names and likenesses of metroid creatures for some of their assets. Also they would have to rename everything that has to do with the federation to make this a generic non-metroid game."

Especially the people who act like they got betrayed."
Metroid,3a5ydz,Divemissile,16,Wed Jun 17 14:40:02 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it was more than a BIT disappointing.  But the point is the same: it was a shitty E3 showing, and people are treating it like the death of Nintendo.  Thankfully, it does seem like people are calming down and realizing it just was that: a shitty conference."
Metroid,3a5ydz,dickholedoug,3,Wed Jun 17 15:29:32 2015 UTC,"I agree, one shitty conference won't kill the company, especially because of the Nintendo Directs."

Metroid,3a5ydz,igor6661,-5,Wed Jun 17 18:55:54 2015 UTC,Nobody is acting like that. They're stating their dislike for it.
Metroid,3a5ydz,BoopysRevenge,15,Wed Jun 17 16:29:02 2015 UTC,"I've cooled down, and at the end of the day it's impossible to pass judgment on a game that hasn't been released yet. This may not be Metroid in the form we want it, but there will be a 1 player mode and many aspects of the game we haven't seen. Not comparing this game to Wind Waker, but this isn't the first time fans have judged a game ahead of its release. Remember: everyone thought Other M was going to be awesome before it came out.  So in conclusion, everybody needs to calm down. Form an opinion on the game after you play it."
Metroid,3a5ydz,SilverKry,4,Wed Jun 17 16:32:51 2015 UTC,I liked Other M :(
Metroid,3a5ydz,Frandaman760,4,Wed Jun 17 19:36:04 2015 UTC,Gameplay was fine. Pretty much everything else was shit.
Metroid,3a5ydz,qghop,3,Wed Jun 17 20:06:45 2015 UTC,I thought the gameplay was really solid outside of the boss battles. Having to stop and reorient to shoot missiles was a pretty bad idea and it made some of these fights frustratingly difficult.
Metroid,3a5ydz,Rimas_LXBYA,5,Thu Jun 18 02:44:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah. This reminds me of banjo-kazooie nuts and bolts.

Metroid,3a5ydz,johnnyFyeah,3,Wed Jun 17 18:44:12 2015 UTC,"Someone else said it well... Putting the Metroid title on the game is poison. The game is not going to sell well to Metroid fans or non-Metroid fans. Unfortunately that means Nintendo will more than likely see that and say, ""Well they don't want another Metroid game because Federation Force didn't sell well"".   This would in the end (Hypothetically speaking) wind up hurting the Metroid franchise, thus, people want them to not even make the game.   It's not necessarily entitlement (at least from my perspective) but moreso preservation of a mostly solid franchise (with Other M and maybe Hunters being the exceptions)."
Metroid,3a5ydz,sbhunterpcpart,2,Wed Jun 17 18:49:37 2015 UTC,"If only they announced it on a Direct.   Trust me, the backlash would have been 1% of what it is now. With the competitive atmosphere of E3 and excitement levels off the charts, they set themselves up for a monumental crash and burn."

People are going to complain about every change to a series, no matter what. People complained about Michael Keaton as Batman. People complained about Heath Ledger as the Joker, and people complained about some third party company making a first person Metroid game.  But when you fully admit that essentially ""I never got into the series, but seeing how the fans react, I'm glad I haven't.""

To keep you busy in the meantime, here's a fun little spin off game Metroid Prime: Federation Forces!""   I personally wouldn't have been pissed off and more than likely would have checked out the game. But not now because it seems that this game is all we are getting from Nintendo. All we wanted was a confirmation that a new REAL Metroid game is in development. The last game we got was a blemish on the franchise and the wait for a new game to rectify that blemish has been so long. Also that petition is really, really stupid."
Metroid,3a5ydz,Weltall548,2,Wed Jun 17 16:55:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not ashamed of that petition because I don't believe that it will affect whether the game is made or not. I respect its worth as just another market signal through which fans can articulate their desires to a company that has appeared disengaged from us at a time when many other developers have given their long-term fans a lot to cheer for (FFVII, Shenmue III, etc.).  Perhaps it will help lead to the Metroid installment that we all wish for being developed in the near future. I'm not even against an ambitious Federation style light Mass Effect or Dead Space type game but having seen some footage and how lightly it was touched upon  in the Digital Event I am very convinced that this little more than a spin off.  Of course, if I could communicate my opinion to Nintendo I would, but as most of us are just guys on the other side of the world it is excusable that we have to rely on somewhat douchey petitions to give them a sense of how we feel."

I mean... what do they expect nintendo to take from something like this?  Rather than a petition to cancel MP:FF, how about a petition for a new 2D metroid??

If that is what you think makes a Metroid game, Metroid. You're mistaken.   Metroid is a brain game. It is a deep, dark, intricate game that teaches you as you play it. It's a mental puzzle with each piece as important as the next. Every corner of the world, every power up, every boss is a puzzle waiting to be solved.   Metroid is an immersive game where you feel isolated, alone, abandoned. You fight your way through an entire world; driven by the breathtaking scenery, the beautiful soundtrack, and the feeling of accomplishment you get when you find the next power-up or boss.   Metroid is a game where everything you need to advanced is right in front of your face, but you have to be smart enough to put it all together.   Metroid is not a button mashing arcade game where you try and shoot a big ball into a goal.."

Metroid,3a5ydz,Vizria,2,Wed Jun 17 21:08:56 2015 UTC,"It has Metroid in the title. It also uses a similar HUD and features similar movement to Metroid Prime. It also takes place in the Metroid universe and uses Metroid enemies.   Seems like a Metroid game to me, but I guess you could tell that by looking at the title."
Metroid,3a5ydz,Lord_of_Phendrana,3,Thu Jun 18 02:47:53 2015 UTC,Prefect opportunity for an indie developer to come out with an alternative.  I call it:  M'Troid.

Seriously if FF and Blast Ball are about as good as that game, I'll be happy. I get a sense that Nintendo wants to have the GF be more solidified in the metroid universe. Look at how they became more and more involved within the Metroid Prime series: Prime 1: Barely any GF involvement prime 2: Remnants of GF task force Prime 3: Good amount of involvement by GF  I feel like they need to become more prevalent in the series if we're ever to get something after Fusion.

I don't think anyone believes it will be cancelled. Nintendo just needs to see that this is not the route the franchise needs to take.  At this point indie developers know how to make a better Metroid game than Nintendo with Axiom Verge and Reven. It's just too bad that Nintendo is so gung-ho about keeping things ""fresh"" and new all the time. Miyamoto likes to throw that around a lot. Like ""oh I don't know... Maybe if I can think of something knew to bring to the franchise. Until then just play Super Mario Bros. #50 :D please understand!"" Don't fix something that isn't broken, Nintendo. People will pay good money just for HD Metroid Prime or HD F-Zero GX. So just fucking make it."

Metroid,3a5ydz,manlycaveman,2,Thu Jun 18 07:44:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if this situation tells Nintendo anything it would be that the Metroid fanbase isn't worth creating a game for at this point.  Metroid is a series, like Zelda or Mario, and does not mean a specific type of game. While yes, the majority of the games follow a certain format, that doesn't mean something different set in the same universe is undeserving of the series name. If anything we should be supportive of this title and show them how much we're interested in getting more games, especially more main-series ones. There are better ways to voice disapproval/suggestions than throwing fits and creating petitions to cancel a game.  FUCK, we have a new game coming out set in the Metroid universe; we haven't been forgotten! Although with all of these tantrums and this petition to outright cancel the game, I wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo didn't even want to bother with us anymore."
Metroid,3a5ydz,illage2,0,Thu Jun 18 08:50:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if this situation tells Nintendo anything it would be that the Metroid fanbase isn't worth creating a game for at this point.   That's just as bad as wanting the game cancelled, and no offence but you sound like an SJW.  What gives you the right to speak on behalf of the entire fanbase?"
Metroid,3a5ydz,illage2,2,Thu Jun 18 11:37:15 2015 UTC,Haha what. I'm not speaking for the fanbase at all! But imagine you're the one creating a Metroid game and people on the internet are so absurdly nitpicking and obnoxious and making petitions to cancel your game. I personally would lose motivation to even work with the series again.
Metroid,3a5ydz,Vizria,2,Fri Jun 19 04:11:35 2015 UTC,"Oh I get that.  It's very demotivating to see people do that. Its a sad fact of life when it comes to the gaming industry and one of the things people learn very quickly is the ability to not let this kind of stuff get to them.  However I've not seen Nintendo cut a developer out (closing studios etc) when they mess up they allow their developers to make mistakes and they always learn from them.  I don't think we should give up on a proper Metroid game whether it be a new Metroid Prime or the side scrolling one's.  Don't forget we have GamesCom Nintendo could come out and say ""Metroid Prime 4 .... "" then."
Metroid,3a5ydz,isienmai,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:17:44 2015 UTC,Oh yeah of course! I definitely think Nintendo has something in the works as far as a main-series title is concerned. It not being at E3 doesn't mean much really especially with Nintendo's stance toward E3 and their directs in the recent years.   Federation Forces actually makes me excited that there's gotta be something still unannounced. The Metroid series was acknowledged and it wasn't just a costume/mini-game! It's a complete game with a story of its own meant to expand the plot! This can only mean good things in the future. :)

If it succeeds then it's going to be something that's made more of under the Metroid name and have a possibility of having mechanics integrated into the mainline. If it fails then it can be interpreted as the franchise being dead.  There is nothing good that comes out of this game having the Metroid name in it.

It has nothing from metroid, no creatures that can be seen of, no setting or locations, its like if it was gonna be its own eshop $5 game and they said, ""Hey, we can maybe say this is metroid and charge $30!"". Its not megaman soccer, which even if its ass it has the megaman characters. It's not mario paint, which is not a good game, but its filled with mario assets and it was innovative.   It's just a shameful cash in.  Not gonna sign the patition or buy this because I just don't care about it, but it's still a shameful cash in."

I don't play Metroid because of the gameplay, level design, or even for Samus. I love those things, for sure, and I'd have a lot to complain about were they missing, but what I played them for was that lonely, creepy, foreign atmosphere. Metroid Prime 2 is one of my favorite games because of how creepy it was without being a horror game.   Federation Force just lacks that feel that everything had. I just don't want it."
Metroid,3a9lge,DustyMuffinsss,2,Thu Jun 18 15:48:01 2015 UTC,Then this spin off game wasn't meant for you. It's not meant to be a main Metroid. Everyone is just going to have to wait for a main tile for just a while longer
Metroid,3a9lge,drybones2015,3,Fri Jun 19 02:10:00 2015 UTC,"I thought this would be interesting to bring up this video in light of recent events. One of the large retorts that gets thrown around is “if you don’t like it don’t play it”. However this statement does come with an asterisk.  Nintendo has seen sales dwindle on the last Metroid installments. And in all likeness Nintendo is just trying to go for a new angle in order to boost sales after the PR disaster that was Other M. Now if people flat out just do not buy the game it will send the message to the deep sea urchin that runs Nintendo that “Metroid just doesn’t sell well”.   However if it does it will send out the message that people would really like Metroid to remain with the more light tone and chibi / sports style.  This is where the complaints come in. And yes, I understand if you’re in the middle of the fanbase it can be a bit overbearing, but there is value in the angry complaints. But a company of this magnitude rarely understands why these projects go wrong. However if a large percentage of their core fanbase stand screaming at their doorstep, they have no way out other than to address the issue.   This has happened many times in the gaming industry. For instance a lot of people on the Wii U community kept screaming at Nintendo to release Earthbound on the virtual store, until Nintendo had no choice but to address these voices."
Metroid,3a9lge,henryuuk,3,Thu Jun 18 09:01:51 2015 UTC,"Yet they also screamed for mother 3, and got mother 1"
Metroid,3a9lge,Ryuutakeshi,3,Thu Jun 18 10:26:11 2015 UTC,"Well... It's a small step. My point is that large corporations often just look at sales figures. But since the internet is great at throwing a tantrum, and as such creating a PR disaster, it makes an excellent way to brute force a message up to the chain of command at Nintendo."
Metroid,3a7nbb,cereal_bawks,60,Wed Jun 17 21:33:08 2015 UTC,WHY IS SAMUS A CAMEO IN HER OWN GAME SERIES?!
Metroid,3a7nbb,Rootayable,33,Wed Jun 17 23:53:31 2015 UTC,"Well, Master Chief got the same treatment in a few of the Halo games. She doesn't have to be the main character in every game. It's just weird because this is a first for the series."
Metroid,3a7nbb,SALMONerd117,13,Thu Jun 18 00:55:17 2015 UTC,But Halo's lore is really fleshed out and they can afford to have stories revolve around other charaters. Samus is quite literally the face of Metroid.
Metroid,3a7nbb,SpaceWarriorSamus-,16,Thu Jun 18 06:02:48 2015 UTC,And Master Chief was the face of Halo until ODST yet in ODST they actually flesh out the characters of the ODSTs you regularly see in Halo which is what I believe they are doing with Federation Force. The Federation has been in a lot of the Metroid game yet they are always just a supporting character and never really fleshed out but now with Federation Force Nintendo has a chance to expand the lore and mythos of the Metroid universe with giving the player the perspective of a regular Federation soldier instead of a professional bounty hunter.
Metroid,3a7nbb,NOBLExGAMER,13,Thu Jun 18 06:09:32 2015 UTC,"Halo has the Halo Bible, the fully written storyline that they made to give direction to the trilogy so they wouldn't make up the plot on the spot. The universe was fleshed out from an early stage, and it made Master Chief a crucial, yet small roll in the over all storyline. Also, after the second installment in the series, you could play as the Arbiter and the Elites. In this case, ODST is not that big of a leap. But to jump from Samus to a federation soldier is. It's a massive downgrade in power and ability, a prime opportunity to make nintendo's own scifi multiplayer fps, which is most likely what fans had in mind when they thought of a Federation Trooper spin off.  Think about that game for a second. You are not the powerful Samus, and must rely more on skill and survival rather than power and upgrades. You and a few other troopers work together to complete missions that flesh out the backstory or set the stage for the next big Metroid game. Heck, they could even tell the story of why Sylux hates the Federation, which is has incredible story telling potential when done from the point of view of a trooper. That could easily prepare us of the follow up to the ending of Prime 3, and would definitely justify the Prime subtitle. Then the series could get a fresh jump with a new multiplayer mode that takes from games like Doom, Hunters, and Halo and has Fed troopers playing around with Deathmatch, Capture the Metroid, and other cool game modes for some fun FPS online play.  But instead of something that would carry the fantastic visuals and unique style and atmosphere of the series, we were given a chibi party fun time shooter and space fifa for kids. It's no where near what the series should be about. It's such a betrayal when the fans know more about the series than the company who made it."
Metroid,3a7nbb,DaPurpleHippo,-2,Thu Jun 18 07:45:48 2015 UTC,"Also, after the second installment in the series, you could play as the Arbiter and the Elites. In this case, ODST is not that big of a leap.   The Arbiter was still a powerful character though basically to the Covenant what the Chief was to the UNSC and you still played as Chief in that game consistently in ODST it was still a big departure you didn't swap to a different more powerful character you were always just a regular soldier very much like what Federation Forces is doing. It also wont be the first time you're able to play as a different character in the Metroid Games as in Hunters you could play as six other characters besides Samus each with unique abilities and weapons.    But instead of something that would carry the fantastic visuals and unique style and atmosphere of the series, we were given a chibi party fun time shooter and space fifa for kids   Yes it's stylized differently from previous Prime games that doesn't mean it wont have a fantastic story or gameplay and it's still a year before it's release more than enough time to make changes. You're the exact type of person that only takes thing for face value and nothing more, this game is coming from a developer whose games only get better and better and as such this should be a great game and one that I'm thoroughly looking forward to as I understand what it is and what it can be not what I want it to be and not what it isn't."
Metroid,3a7nbb,NOBLExGAMER,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:21:45 2015 UTC,"My point was that comparing Halo to Metroid in this case is nonsense as the Metroid series has been grafted to Samus. I have never played a Zelda game where you weren't Link in one way or another. Metroid is similar.  And if they did want to go this direction and show off federation troopers, why make them look like a joke? Sure it might be a cool game still, but it seriously lacks any wow factor that makes a game worthwhile. It looks like a big gimmick at this point. Maybe i'll eat my words when it comes out, but when we havent seen a decent metroid game in years, this is an insult. There is no hype, no depth, nothing interesting enough to make me think I will ever spend money on this. This game is not just a game anymore. It is a symbol of the relationship between the Metroid fans and Nintendo. They had to have known what was expected from the franchise, and had to have known something like this would not be taken lightly. The execution was dreadful, and the constant teasing that something actually worthwhile was coming is painful at this point. Idk about the rest of us, but I feel let down and discouraged that the series I love is in the hands of people who can't do it justice. And I've heard the argument before that fans should not be ungrateful for the content the devs put out because it's not our game. But we are the ones who experience it and the ones who brought it to where it is, and it is sad that it feels like the fans love this game more than nintendo. Federation Force is honestly not all that bad, but in the context of things it is the worst thing Nintendo could have done with the series."
Metroid,3a7nbb,DaPurpleHippo,-1,Thu Jun 18 08:44:13 2015 UTC,"I really think you and everyone else is angry at Federation Force when you should be angry at Nintendo, which you have every right to be, as they should have announced or at least teased a main series Metroid game alongside Federation Force but looking at Federation Force as Metroid Prime 4 and being angry at what they could have done or what you wanted them to do isn't right it's a spin-off and a really fun looking one. More people need to stop directing their unjustified hate and disdain onto Federation Force is  when it should be directed at Nintendo for no main series game."
Metroid,3a7nbb,NOBLExGAMER,0,Thu Jun 18 08:58:25 2015 UTC,"True. It's bein used as the sandbag for our hate, and I kinda feel bad. I saw Blastball and thought it looked kinda cool, and began resenting it when they slapped on the Metroid logo. Like I said, this game might end up being jjust fine, but right now is just the wrong time for something like this. The Metroid community has been on edge since Other M, and this is not helping. I am still hopeful that nintendo has something nice up their sleeve to redeem the series. We'll see how things play out"
Metroid,3a7nbb,DaPurpleHippo,0,Thu Jun 18 09:09:31 2015 UTC,"I think people are still angry at Nintendo, though.  Sure, it's not the game's fault, but heck the game is here because of Nintendo. Metroid doesn't seem to have the best of luck when it comes to sales, which is where they base their reception off, I suppose."
Metroid,3a7nbb,Rootayable,0,Thu Jun 18 09:44:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly, this fun looking spin-off is here because of Nintendo which is good. What's bad is that there is no main series game because of Nintendo which is what people should have an issue with."
Metroid,3a7nbb,NOBLExGAMER,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:28:04 2015 UTC,"You're the exact type of person that only takes thing for face value and nothing more   But this was supposed to be a trailer to wow us.  It's at E3, a place where it's meant to show trailers of the best bits of a game to get us looking forward to it.  If that was the best that the game is going to offer, then yeah we're going to judge it.  If it's not the best of what the game can off, then wait!  Wait to show something that's going to be really entertaining and exciting!"
Metroid,3a7nbb,Rootayable,-3,Thu Jun 18 09:39:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was though it was only a minute trailer and they didn't put a whole lot in it becasue it's a spin-off something to sate the fans until Metroid Prime 4 which is something that should wow us and have a big in depth showoffy trailer, not a spin-off. Which is smart because I'm sure a lot of you would be foaming at the mouth in anger even more so than before if they made a spectacle of the spin-off."
Metroid,3a7nbb,NOBLExGAMER,-1,Thu Jun 18 10:18:48 2015 UTC,You've played the game and know that what you suggested isn't the case?
Metroid,3a7nbb,TheFullMonty1394,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:16:00 2015 UTC,"But, I wonder if they're going to give the soldiers personalities, or you're just playing as four faceless grunts of the federation?"
Metroid,3a7nbb,Rootayable,0,Thu Jun 18 09:35:37 2015 UTC,"I imagine it's going to be one of those ""you are the soldier"" thing and there will be customization and different heads, torsos, arms, and legs you can unlock and the personality and story is going to come from NPCs you interact with."
Metroid,3a7nbb,NOBLExGAMER,3,Thu Jun 18 10:21:05 2015 UTC,This might be their attempt to finally expand the metroid lore
Metroid,3a7nbb,henryuuk,0,Thu Jun 18 09:33:18 2015 UTC,"Well, I suppose Halo isn't Master Chief's name (amazing if it was). And Samus isn't in the title of Metroid games (apart from II) I dunno, it just feels wrong not having Samus in a Metroid game. Having said that, I'd love the idea of them introducing another bounty hunter like Samus. Like, someone else who was part of the Chozo people: http://rootay.deviantart.com/art/Novus-Orna-Bounty-Hunter-300466383"
Metroid,3a7nbb,Rootayable,2,Thu Jun 18 09:26:41 2015 UTC,"Playing as a Chozo would be really cool, but I feel like it would take away from their mystery. I think a game that takes place after Fusion that lets you customize your own bounty hunter (like how Halo Reach did it) and your bounty is Samus would be amazing."
Metroid,3a7nbb,SALMONerd117,2,Thu Jun 18 17:04:06 2015 UTC,"Of course, the main story would end in your death. Or you end up teaming with her halfway through to take down the real bad guys."
Metroid,3a7nbb,darthluigi36,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:38:39 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting idea, actually.  Sort of...taking on the idea of Hunters (but not nearly as shit) and you're out to hunt Samus, under order of the Galactic Federation, seeing as she's now wanted.  See?  There's so many great places to go now after Fusion, why are we stuck in Prime era?  I can't complain, really.   If anything it's testament to how good Prime is all these years later!"
Metroid,3a7nbb,Rootayable,2,Thu Jun 18 17:43:12 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind more Prime games, because they're really great. But I'm dying to see what happens with the story post Fusion, and there's so many cool possibilities."
Metroid,3a7nbb,SALMONerd117,2,Thu Jun 18 19:00:02 2015 UTC,"Right?  Well, the joy of being a fan is you can let you're imagine run wild!  God, that sounded so much more poetic in my head.."
Metroid,3a7nbb,Rootayable,6,Thu Jun 18 20:25:33 2015 UTC,Why was Solid Snake a cameo in his own game series? See MGS2.
Metroid,3a7nbb,rondo_of_blood,3,Thu Jun 18 12:16:03 2015 UTC,"While I liked MGS2, I recall reading that that game got similar amounts of bashing. The only thing is that Konami actually showed off Snake, so they were able to keep people hyped until they actually got their hands on the game and realized Snake was only playable in a sort of tutorial level that can be skipped entirely."
Metroid,3a7nbb,Moulinoski,5,Thu Jun 18 14:58:07 2015 UTC,"It's not a cameo.  This also isn't a Samus game, it's a metroid game.  And those will be in it."
Metroid,3a7nbb,jkeyc,21,Thu Jun 18 00:41:07 2015 UTC,But Samus IS a Metroid. The last Metroid technically.
Metroid,3a7nbb,Ryuutakeshi,4,Thu Jun 18 00:44:34 2015 UTC,"Nah, Sakamoto said that in the end of Fusion, absorbing SA-X turned Samus back to her original self."
Metroid,3a7nbb,MatrixChicken,4,Thu Jun 18 01:33:35 2015 UTC,Did it? But how would that affect the metroid DNA in any way? That doesn't even match up with what the game tells us.
Metroid,3a7nbb,Ryuutakeshi,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:06:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's really weird. But that's what ol' Saky said, so it's canon. :P"
Metroid,3a7nbb,MatrixChicken,6,Thu Jun 18 02:34:19 2015 UTC,"Ol' Saky also said Prime isn't canon, and that Samus should be a sexist stereotype."
Metroid,3a7nbb,Zero-Striker,5,Thu Jun 18 02:52:11 2015 UTC,"That's true...  Why you gotta make things so hard, Saky?! >_>"
Metroid,3a7nbb,MatrixChicken,2,Thu Jun 18 03:00:52 2015 UTC,"You know, the more I'm hearing about Sakamoto's opinions on the metroid series, the less I'm liking him.  Really seems like that old grandpa you have that still spouts out racial slurs from ""back in the day"" who just needs to be pushed to the corner and ignored for a bit."
Metroid,3a7nbb,just_a_jar,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:56:37 2015 UTC,"He does seem that way now... But he's made so many good games, even the one so many hold up to be the best game ever... It's so weird that he went from all those masterpieces to the turd that was Other M. I think he may have done it out of spite for Retro. Maybe he felt they beat him at his own game. :/  Anyways, I want him back. I want to see a new Metroid game from him, but 2D and with no text other than the intro. :P"
Metroid,3a7nbb,MatrixChicken,0,Thu Jun 18 14:39:49 2015 UTC,"Actually that's a mistranlation, what Sakamoto really ment was that the Prime games events aren't relevant to Other M, which is true since that game only references Super."
Metroid,3a7nbb,Lemon_Girl,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:56:27 2015 UTC,You have a source on that?
Metroid,3a7nbb,dailyapple,2,Thu Jun 18 14:36:40 2015 UTC,"That's what I heard from a few people, mistranslations happen all the time, BUT, forget about it, I actually found a guy who translated the interview again and he actually says this: ""In fact, I have always seen the story of the Primes as alternative and not integrated in the story of the other Metroids, that's the reason they had total liberty when creating it. And Samus was different, tougher."" So in his head, the Prime games aren't canon because he didn't make them, and Samus acted (like every single fucking person though she does) tougher, which is funny because Prime Samus is pretty much Super Metroid Samus, tough with a kind side. So fuck him, he didn't create Metroid anyways."
Metroid,3a7nbb,Lemon_Girl,2,Thu Jun 18 15:03:30 2015 UTC,God damnit I was just going to finish that game tonight
Metroid,3a7nbb,TheFullMonty1394,7,Thu Jun 18 06:21:27 2015 UTC,"The game's like twelve and a half years old and you're on the metroid sub, I'm surprised you've avoided that spoiler :P But I mean come on, the SA-X is an X parasite and you had to have known you'd fight it at some point, does that really surprise you?"
Metroid,3a7nbb,ocshoes,3,Thu Jun 18 07:21:08 2015 UTC,Can you explain what you mean by this?
Metroid,3a7nbb,Galvnayr,7,Thu Jun 18 01:09:11 2015 UTC,"It's sort of a two-parter.   Metroid is a Chozo word that basically translates out to ""hunter"" (or something similar. I don't recall specifically off the top of my head). Hunter is the title that the Space Pirates have given Samus and both she and the Metroid species are basically living bioweapons intended to destroy hostile creatures. In Metroid Fusion, Samus almost dies from the X Parasite infecting her system. DNA from the last Metroid (the baby) is used as a vaccine. Samus then takes on some traits of the Metroid species, such as vulnerability to cold temperatures and the the ability to absorb energy. Since the baby was the previous last Metroid (after Samus killed them all), currently Samus is the last known Metroid in the galaxy."
Metroid,3a7nbb,Ryuutakeshi,3,Thu Jun 18 01:14:59 2015 UTC,"That's pretty neat. However, wasn't the galactic federation cloning/somehow creating artificial metroids  on the station where Samus was in fusion? I'm aware it was blown up but they could be doing it elsewhere."
Metroid,3a7nbb,Galvnayr,3,Thu Jun 18 01:17:44 2015 UTC,"I believe they cloned those from the same DNA they used to create the metroid vaccine, which was used on Samus. Then Samus blew up the station the federation was cloning metroids on and destroyed the home planet of the metroids. She also killed all of the ones on Zebes when she blew that up, and as far as we know destroyed all of the metroids in the Prime series (which I guess isn't even in the main metroid timeline now). So, as far as we know, there are no other metroids but Samus."
Metroid,3a7nbb,Ryuutakeshi,0,Thu Jun 18 01:19:27 2015 UTC,Wouldn't she be considered more of a half metroid  half human?
Metroid,3a7nbb,Galvnayr,5,Thu Jun 18 01:21:57 2015 UTC,"She's part human, part Chozo, part Metroid. It's the closest thing the galaxy has to an actual Metroid species right now.  It also is kinda awesome to consider that the Hunter of Metroids is now herself the last Metroid in existence."
Metroid,3a7nbb,Ryuutakeshi,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:24:46 2015 UTC,How is she part chozo?
Metroid,3a7nbb,Galvnayr,7,Thu Jun 18 01:26:26 2015 UTC,But that's like argueing that Porygon isn't in the Pokemon show.
Metroid,3a7nbb,jkeyc,10,Thu Jun 18 00:54:43 2015 UTC,"(which is stupid since it was Pikachu's fault to begin with)  Porygon has never been the defining character of Pokemon. Samus and Metroid go hand in hand. They are one and the same, even in name. This is why so many people make the mistake of calling Link ""Zelda"". Not every LoZ game has Zelda in it but I can't think of a single adventure that didn't give us the next legend of The Hero. Zelda (the game) and Link are in pretty much the exact same boat as Metroid and Samus."
Metroid,3a7nbb,Ryuutakeshi,6,Thu Jun 18 01:07:11 2015 UTC,"That's actually a really good point.  I think if the game was called Federation Force and just that, people wouldn't mind, even if it was a Metroid game still."
Metroid,3a7nbb,jkeyc,10,Thu Jun 18 01:12:54 2015 UTC,"It would be even better if it was released during an era where Metroid was actively being created and worked on. Side stories are great additions to main stories, but generally need a main story to tie too. This game is tying itself to a game that was made 8 years ago and is not accompanied by another main series title. Right now, FF is the only continuation of the Metroid story we have."
Metroid,3a7nbb,Ryuutakeshi,2,Thu Jun 18 01:17:12 2015 UTC,"This is the root. The game is cool and has metroid stuff, but I am dying for exploration and this places the idea in people's heads that the series may not ever go back to that. If this sells amazingly, what happens to the series then? I'm personally dying for 2D exploration on the 3DS."

Metroid,3a7nbb,Rootayable,3,Thu Jun 18 09:23:29 2015 UTC,YEAH NO ONE WOULD EVER ACCEPT THAT IF IT HAPPENED TO ANOTHER CHARACTER!  LIKE WHAT IF THERE WAS A GAME WHERE YOU PLAY AS MARIOS LITTLE BROTHER?
Metroid,3a7nbb,VicisSubsisto,6,Thu Jun 18 05:22:25 2015 UTC,"Like, sure, Luigi's Mansion didn't have Mario in, but it wasn't called Super Mario Bros: Luigi's Mansion. And sure, Misadventures of Tron Bonne didn't have Mega Man in, but it wasn't called Mega Man: Misadventures of Tron Bonne. They should've just left this as 'Federation Force', and said it was in the Metroid Universe as a spin off game.  Don't CALL it Metroid Prime: Federation Force, because then you're setting out a whole load of expectations that are going to be missed."
Metroid,3a7nbb,Rootayable,3,Thu Jun 18 09:22:09 2015 UTC,"Difference is that 'metroid' isn't Samus her own name.    And there is the yoshi game that has a mario title and where mario is the objective, not the main character    Ps: there is also : mario is missing which only had mario at the end like luigi's mansion does"
Metroid,3a7nbb,henryuuk,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:38:40 2015 UTC,"But, like Zelda, Metroid and Samus generally go hand-in-hand.  Even Hunters had Samus as the main character with other playable characters.  Like, as a lot of people have said, there hasn't been enough character development anywhere else in the series to warrant dropping Samus off completely."
Metroid,3a7nbb,Rootayable,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:53:12 2015 UTC,Zelda isn't in all zelda games and link isn't the same character every time LoZ also has a spin off series which doesn't involve Link.    And this game could exactly BE how they want to flesh out the lore and side characters
Metroid,3a7nbb,henryuuk,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:00:30 2015 UTC,"Zelda might not be in all Zelda games, but Link, though is a different incarnation every time, is the same character, essentially. I can understand wanting to flesh out the Metroid lore, but that can also be done in Metroid games as well, like how Prime did.  Also, this game wouldn't be quite so much of a kick if it wasn't the fact we haven't had a Metroid game in over 5 years."
Metroid,3a7nbb,Rootayable,2,Thu Jun 18 10:11:42 2015 UTC,So you'd rather get nothing then? Even if they happen to be working on a new metroid and this is a tide over?
Metroid,3a7nbb,henryuuk,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:22:10 2015 UTC,"It's all to do with PR and marketing, I suppose. If they are working on a full console title and this is meant to tide us over, they haven't made that clear, and we can't exactly assume."
Metroid,3a7nbb,Rootayable,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:16:41 2015 UTC,Whether this is to tide over or not. It's existance (and much less so its name) does not affect the creation of other metroid games
Metroid,3a7nbb,henryuuk,-1,Thu Jun 18 13:18:46 2015 UTC,Cause it's a side story about different characters .. seems pretty logical
Metroid,3a7nbb,henryuuk,9,Thu Jun 18 09:32:04 2015 UTC,"Would have been super hyped for this. No Samus, she's off doing her own thing but the GF is still taking care of business and it'd be neat to see what they do in the Metroid style of gameplay. Not the crap that we got."
Metroid,3a7nbb,Oduya,22,Wed Jun 17 22:38:10 2015 UTC,I agree that the GF concept is pretty cool and I from the look of it I would probably enjoy the gameplay. I think it could have been a sweet game if they had presented it realistically. But the chibi look is almost ruining the whole thing for me.
Metroid,3a7nbb,Father_Brain,10,Wed Jun 17 22:46:17 2015 UTC,"While I was as disappointed by the reveal as everyone else, all they need to do get to considering purchasing the game is change the chibis. The concept isn't that bad actually, on Wii U with regular character models alongside an actual Metroid title (preferably a 2D Metroid 5), it could have been a great way to expand the lore and a fun way to play co-op with cool powers as an elite Federation soldier."
Metroid,3a7nbb,DaPurpleHippo,6,Thu Jun 18 02:25:20 2015 UTC,"It just looks so underwhelming. And with most of the series having a pretty serious scifi tone, to see little cartoon troopers run around is weird.   Remember this?  And this?  Honestly, for kids some of this stuff is intense and not really expected from a Nintendo classic. Compare it with this and it's a pretty stark contrast. We may be jumping the gun here in some aspects, but really from what was shown off at E3 is a disappointment in regards to Metroid."
Metroid,3a7nbb,just_a_jar,3,Thu Jun 18 08:00:36 2015 UTC,I liked Rundas. :(  And I remember that scene was very shocking the first time around to a younger me.
Metroid,3a7nbb,b3nny09,4,Thu Jun 18 12:02:48 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind a Metroid:ODST where you play as average Federation troops battling the Pirates on the ground while Samus is away. But this game... The chibi art style isn't doing it any favors.

Metroid,3a7nbb,Swithe,5,Thu Jun 18 14:49:23 2015 UTC,Metroids and Samus also appeared in Kirby's Dream Land 3.  Can we call that a Metroid game now?
Metroid,3a7nbb,KingBroly,9,Thu Jun 18 13:26:06 2015 UTC,I'm not looking forward to Chibi Metroids OR Chibi Samus.  This just seems like a serious disregard of the franchise.  Who thought that THIS would be a good idea 5 years after Other M and 8 years after Prime 3?  Just insanity.
Metroid,3a7nbb,Hellspark08,7,Thu Jun 18 01:47:51 2015 UTC,"I'm staying optimistic. I mean, they gave us a Pinball game for Christ's sake, and it was a darn good pinball game. This is just a different thing, and it might just be great for what it is. If it builds interest for the entire series, then more power to it. I'm sure we haven't seen everything there is to this game yet."
Metroid,3a7nbb,KingBroly,5,Thu Jun 18 03:27:14 2015 UTC,The difference here is that Pinball wasn't during a period of dormancy and we knew then that the next game was just over the horizon.  We don't here.

It sounds like it'll be fun to play, and I'd love to see the world more fleshed out from the point of view of the Federation. Accepting this game on its own and not as a 'Metroid' game in and of itself helped."
Metroid,3a7nbb,fpiceail,5,Thu Jun 18 13:42:38 2015 UTC,"Can Tanabe stop drunk driving with the franchise?   The horrendous art style isn't even the worst part about it. Easily the worst part is the mission based nature. You won't be exploring biomes of a planet like in previous Metroid games, you'll be shipped off to standalone levels like in Mario or even Halo....exactly what Metroid was NOT meant to be in the first place.    While the game is more focused on action, there will be some areas for players to explore a bit, although there is no scanning visor.   Good fucking lord. Did Tanabe ever play any of the Prime games? He produced them so you would hope he has, but it really looks like he has no idea why the games were so well received and what made them good in the first place."
Metroid,3a7nbb,CommodoreCoCo,4,Thu Jun 18 00:57:59 2015 UTC,"it really looks like he has no idea why the games were so well received and what made them good in the first place.   Any time people say ""Metroid Prime playstyle"" about this game, I don't think they realize what most Metroid fans liked about Metroid Prime playstyle. They equate control scheme and HUD with playstyle, when that's really only the ""Prime"" part- it is not at all Metroid. It's like calling Mario Kart a Paper Mario game- sure it's got the ""Mario"" but it sure as heck ain't ""Paper."""

Why is it so hard to consider that for once, that the Metroid series doesn't have to be 100% centered around one character, that a combat focused game could be good, that this could be great if PEOPLE WOULD TRY EMBRACING IT FUCK  The mass pessimism really is killing me. I loved Prime. I even sold KI: Uprising to get a boxed copy of Prime Hunters, a game I still play with my brothers every now and then. It's fantastic, and I'm stoked for this entry. Beyond stoked, actually. And the new art style looks cute! I think it'll be awesome to customize my load out and wreck shop on the available planets! Gunsoccer looks fun!  Come on! Give this game a chance!"
Metroid,3a7nbb,Kimihro,4,Thu Jun 18 02:13:17 2015 UTC,I didn't want an action game based around missions.  I wanted a Metroidvania from the series that both created the genre and made the greatest games of the genre.  Fuck Nintendo for thinking this was a good idea after all this waiting.  If they had announced this shitty little spin-off title and then later on made the announcement of an actual Metroid game it would have been fine.
Metroid,3a7nbb,kirbykaz,-3,Thu Jun 18 02:58:25 2015 UTC,"I know you're with the flow and all, what makes what you want so important? The creators keep their inspiration for these games by striking from new angles almost every time. It's how they stay motivated. It's how they come up with something beautiful. Why do we constantly expect the same shit 100% of the time when Nintendo is infamous for doing the exact opposite of that with every new system?  And more importantly, this is not a spinoff to them. This is considered a flagship Metroid Prime title. Does it hurt to consider it as such? Does it hurt to put your confidence in something foreign?"

I'm not saying my opinion is the only opinion that matters, but I'm not going to ameliorate it just because the devs might feel bad.  Had they not ignored Metroid for as long as they have only to announce this garbage Federation Force would have been a non-issue."
Metroid,3a7nbb,Rootayable,-2,Thu Jun 18 03:18:58 2015 UTC,"I could give a fuck what they want. I play it. I experience it.   Again, with the self-centeredness. Me, me, me, I, I, I. This game is their love, their creation that they dared to share. A new slice of Metroid. It's an expression for you to experience, but in its developmental period they had to live this game. You're not that important, and more so they're hoping that you'll like what they're sharing. That you'll give it a chance. An actual chance.  But you won't."
Metroid,3a7nbb,Genxus,4,Thu Jun 18 03:35:27 2015 UTC,"Of course I won't.  Why should I play something that is anathema to me when I have a plethora of other games that I am interested in, as well as games that are actually in the Metroidvania genre to hold me over until an actual Metroid comes out.  Ori and the Blind Forest immediately comes to mind.  What's more though, it strikes me as funny that you seem to have this opinion that the devs can just cook up whatever the hell they want and we are obligated to lap it up, or at the very least not allowed to express our displeasure/discontentment/rage. Literally no form of entertainment media works like that.  Pissing off the people you are trying to sell something to is quite frankly one of the easiest ways to ensure that what you are selling does poorly."
Metroid,3a7nbb,kirbykaz,0,Thu Jun 18 03:49:20 2015 UTC,Why should I play something that is anathema to me   The funniest thing about this whole situation is the way some of you guys are starting to express yourselves over a damn video game.

Metroid,3a7nbb,Kimihro,-7,Thu Jun 18 03:40:43 2015 UTC,This game is chibi bullshit  It doesnt affect you as a casual metroid fan but to the diehard fans who scanned every thing in Prime it's a kick in the head
Metroid,3a7nbb,kirbykaz,7,Thu Jun 18 02:25:02 2015 UTC,"That's rude, man. I'm sorry, but  Fuck you.  I've been playing and completing Metroid games since Super Metroid. I play the games to death when I get them. Until I'm beyond satisfied. I love the look and feel of every game. I get lost in the worlds at my completion times' expense. Scanned everything, restarted if I forgot a boss. Kept saves for the most fun of fights. Don't downplay my being a fan. I'm not the most diehard fan ever but I'm as close as it fucking gets, as I am sure most people on this sub would consider themselves. Metroid is my favorite Nintendo series ever, and as far as I can see, nothing will change that.  You don't even know me. How could you feel comfortable saying that?  What the fuck is wrong with this sub? This place is devoid of optimism, and it's really rearing its ugly head."

Metroid,3a7nbb,kirbykaz,5,Thu Jun 18 02:30:43 2015 UTC,"Not to be devil's advocate, but the Prime series isn't really a by-the-definition Metroidvania style game.  And to boot, scanning isn't even a thing in the 2D Metroid games."

So what does this game offer that would make people want to play it? What does it have that will quench my thirst for more FPS Metroid?"
Metroid,3abblb,b2damaxx,4,Thu Jun 18 19:24:16 2015 UTC,"That is a loaded question, but to put it bluntly it is fun. The gameplay  like a dance between you and space pirates. There is a little bit of cunning especially between other local players. From what i've played there was little to no lag at all."

Or did they split it to the left stick for movement and thumb nub (if it was on an n3DS)/screen to look around?"

Mind you, her crumbling down in front of Ridley after facing him (successfully) for the upteenth time is still weird to me. But that was a prequel comic. To see him again after their one encounter where he brutally murdered her family and friends, I can completely see that happening. After blasting him twenty times, I don't think it matters anymore after that... Although... I think I'd be driven a bit insane thinking ""this guy who killed all my loved ones keeps coming back... what the heck!"""
Metroid,3a6upz,EdgarAllenPoeish,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:28:12 2015 UTC,Not saying the manga was bad it just gave reason to give Samus PTSD in Other M which is... done poorly...  Considering she killed like what... 5 incarnations of him... and each version getting stronger and more mechanized.

Captain falcon walks forward and says, ""Show me your moves."" A couple of people in the back are heard saying ""wtf?""   We then cut to a montage of Samus racing Captain falcon in an F-zero grand prix. We see all sorts of different tracks and machines from the game. The audience begins booing. Myomoto takes a step back from the now angry crowd. We see a quick clip of Samus and Falcon playing soccer with guns on the big screen. And then the fans go berserk. They tearing up mario plushies and burning effigies of myomoto. The theater is razed to the ground.

I know some lead players jumped ship to work at 343 on the Halo series, and others left to start their own studios or join others. At this point, would Nintendo be better off handing the reigns to another 2nd party developer or handling it themselves? Nintendo's shown that they know how to make 2d Metroid games, but not so much 3d. And I think after Other M, Nintendo is scared to go back to ""mature"" Metroid games for a while."

Metroid,3a6ghv,LegacyLemur,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:30:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly. They needed to focus on the WiiU but all they showed was games from last year and 2 games that we didn't know about, and  not overly big games. I dunno what goes through nintendos head in regards to WiiU."
Metroid,3a6ghv,fossilfern,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:43:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Nintendo has not done well with names lately. The DS and 3DS worked, but in both cases, journalists assumed those would be the names, everyone started using them, and Nintendo pretty much just went ""sure, why not?"". Meanwhile, the Wii got mocked incessantly back when it first launched, when people weren't moping about how it wasn't called the Revolution; the Wii U confused non-gamers who weren't sure whether it was an add-on to the original Wii or its own system; hopefully I don't need to spell out why the New 3DS was a terrible name."

Metroid,3a6ghv,BlockyAnubis,6,Thu Jun 18 13:37:57 2015 UTC,The wiiu had the game pad perfect to interact with the game and a need for graphics that could display the systems capabilites. To hear that they have not even made this a priority shows why nintendo is not the same of yesteryear

Metroid,3a6ghv,deegan87,6,Thu Jun 18 15:48:30 2015 UTC,So they haven't even started? Bullshit. Tired of their excuses. There should have been an actual game ready for release this year that was shown last year.
Metroid,3a6ghv,NJ_Yankees_Fan,3,Wed Jun 17 17:59:19 2015 UTC,Perhaps its better that they cut their losses with the Wii U to bolster an explosive Metroid NX launch title. Wasn't Prime 3 in the launch window for Wii.
Metroid,3a6ghv,Old_Army90,3,Wed Jun 17 16:59:38 2015 UTC,Wasn't Prime 3 in the launch window for Wii.   Prime came out about 9 months after the Wii was released.

Since they're basically going to have to go all out on this one (with a three year development time), maybe it could sort of like a Metroidvania Chrono trigger? There could be like five different timelines and they could all effect eachother. Maybe we could even see a little more of Samus' backstory with the Chozo?"

They know damn well that Metroid Prime 4, an actual Wii U Animal Crossing game, and a TTYD sequel would all sell gangbusters. What gives?"
Metroid,3a6ghv,meetthesharpies,8,Thu Jun 18 01:57:39 2015 UTC,"Would all sell gangbusters   Maybe Animal Crossing Wii U, but Metroid is notorious for not selling well in Japan. If you want to say Ninendo doesn't give a half damn about Metroid in particular, then I'd agree. I think this is cold hard finances.  Metroid doesn't sell well, it gets put back. Just like F-Zero.

Metroid,3a6ghv,UnresolvedGamer,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:00:29 2015 UTC,"From what it's sounding like, he maybe wants to make a Metroid, but Nintendo execs don't seem to be fully behind the franchise, and not giving him a lot of support for it, might also explain why Federation Force is weird compared to the other prime games, He maybe wanted something more like Prime, but Nintendo wanted something more kiddy and casual oriented. Basically I wouldn't blame Next Level and Tanable, seems more like people from above's influence.  Not that Federation Force is a bad game, I'll give it a chance, will probably pick it up if I get a 3ds, just seems off compared to the franchises other installments. (The Chibi style is very awkward, along with the Space Soccer thing, very un-Metroid)"
Metroid,3a6ghv,Parax0,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:08:11 2015 UTC,I think Metroid's struggles relate to Nintendo as a whole with their difficulty adapting to HD development. Wasn't DK:TF made with the Wii engine?
Metroid,3a6ghv,bandikoopa,6,Thu Jun 18 03:13:28 2015 UTC,Tropical Freeze was basically a new engine. They overhauled a ton of stuff compared to DKCR to get it running smoothly on Wii U.
Metroid,3a6ghv,scamper_pants,2,Wed Jun 17 17:39:53 2015 UTC,"Dude, Tropical Freeze was on Return's engine, and that was a modified version of the Prime engine. I would expect some difficulty for them stepping out of their comfort zone."
Metroid,3aa9e6,NOBLExGAMER,8,Thu Jun 18 13:46:39 2015 UTC,Makes logical sense. But I'm concerned that this is the studio's vision for Metroid. If they went on to make more Metroid games and kept the chibi style I would be one sad brain.
Metroid,3aa9e6,Father_Brain,-1,Thu Jun 18 14:02:42 2015 UTC,"But I'm concerned that this is the studio's vision for Metroid   Well they did state there were logical reasons behind the art style but I don't see why they couldn't make changes, it's not like they're locked to an art style."
Metroid,3aa9e6,synthieval,3,Thu Jun 18 14:09:58 2015 UTC,Those reasons were bs excuses. Prime Hunters looked fine at the time.
Metroid,3aa9e6,SylvanHawk,-5,Thu Jun 18 14:43:43 2015 UTC,Prime Hunters looked fine at the time   Yes it looked fine at the time which was different from today and on a different piece of hardware. They probably tried just doing another game in the Hunters style and it didn't work so they turned to the current art style.
Metroid,3aa9e6,SylvanHawk,5,Thu Jun 18 15:06:17 2015 UTC,"Better hardware should be able to make an even better version of Hunters. That, or my understanding of computers is backwards."
Metroid,3aa9e6,SylvanHawk,-3,Thu Jun 18 17:57:21 2015 UTC,"That's not always true, the 3DS is superior to the DS yet it can't emulate GBA. Just because something can't work on one platform doesn't mean it will on another."
Metroid,3aa9e6,Mortimer42,2,Thu Jun 18 18:02:53 2015 UTC,How does a choice not to include GBA emulation in the 3ds prove that the ds may be better than the 3ds at supporting a game like Hunters? You've lost me.
Metroid,3aa9e6,hipstercabbage,-2,Thu Jun 18 18:29:27 2015 UTC,"How does a choice not to include GBA emulation in the 3ds   It's not a choice, Nintendo can't get GBA games to fluently run on the 3DS and if they could why wouldn't they? It'd be a huge digital cash cow for Nintendo. The point is just because one piece of hardware is superior than another doesn't mean it can replicate software like it's predecessor."
Metroid,3aa9e6,marioman63,2,Thu Jun 18 18:33:51 2015 UTC,"But we aren't talking about replicating or emulating Hunters. We're talking about making its successor, but with better graphics. That is what this is about. From what I can tell, you're saying that you believe them when they said they HAD to make the characters chibi just to make the game work while an inferior system was able to make a game that looks like Hunters work 9 years ago, and your justification for believing this is that the 3DS can't emulate GBA games smoothly even though it can run games like Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate. I've lost my toucan."

Metroid,3aa9e6,marioman63,5,Fri Jun 19 04:05:48 2015 UTC,A test by making it completely unrelated in every way?
Metroid,3aa9e6,hipstercabbage,-5,Thu Jun 18 13:51:57 2015 UTC,"How is it unrelated? You play a Federation solider in the Metroid Prime universe so it's pretty related to Metroid, take note that the Federation has never really been given much detail even though it been in many of the Metroid games so this is an opportunity to expand it's lore. Just because Samus isn't the protagonist doesn't make it unrelated."
Metroid,3aa9e6,hipstercabbage,4,Thu Jun 18 13:59:37 2015 UTC,"Because all aspects of traditional Metroid games (platforming, finding secrets, getting weapon and armor upgrades, huge maps) are not present in this game. Shooting at shit is the most Metroid this game gets."

Metroid,3aaql1,txcrnr,2,Thu Jun 18 16:40:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, I'll try to add emphasis on the important facts.  But what I'm trying to highlight is that Virtual Reality was rejected by Nintendo because it wasn't ""fun and social"", meaning that those two words are apparently a high priority in their company.  Games like Super Mario 3D World, SSB4, Mario Kart and Splatoon all fit that description, but a dark, atmospheric solo game like any of the Metroid games is completely the opposite.  Is that making sense?  Then think of the Metroid title that we got.  It's bright, it's cutesy and it's got a heavy multiplayer/social emphasis.  If you were wondering ""why"" they would make this kind of change to the franchise, their emphasis on ""fun and social"" should be the answer."

Metroid,3a7jy6,plasmabeamonline,6,Wed Jun 17 21:09:13 2015 UTC,"Here's what I think Nintendo should do now. They've already screwed us over with E3 this year, so I think they owe us something of an apology. How about some Metroid characters in Smash Bros? They're already working on DLC. Metroid's 30th anniversary is next year. Maybe they could bring in a couple of Metroid characters? That would be more than enough for me to forgive them."
Metroid,3a7jy6,twinfyre,5,Wed Jun 17 22:25:12 2015 UTC,"That would be amazing!  But of course, they'd find some way to mess it up by only adding new characters from OM and FF."
Metroid,3a7jy6,BlockyAnubis,3,Thu Jun 18 01:13:23 2015 UTC,I'd love it if they had a short trailer with the Dark Samus Assist Trophy wreaking Phazon induced havok on a 4 player Smash and suddenly cutting to a screenshot like this:  http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/163/c/c/ssb4_banner__dark_samus_by_pixiy-d68sq27.png  Then her boss music starts playing and they show off an incredible new moveset inspired by both Echoes and Corruption.

Metroid,3abm37,the_masked_redditor,6,Thu Jun 18 19:53:20 2015 UTC,"I don't hate Federation Force for what it is. It might be a fun game. I'm more disappointed in Nintendo, because it feels like they don't have much faith in Metroid's formula or gameplay. If Tanabe is struggling to pitch a new Prime to Nintendo, and Next Level really did have to can two other Metroid 3DS prototypes that were more traditional, that speaks volumes to the future of traditional Metroid titles.  I agree, it's childish to put up a petition and lavish hate on Federation Force as some reason for the death of Metroid. It could and may be a good game. Next Level has proven to be a company that makes good games for Nintendo.  Metroid isn't dead, but there's evidence it may well be in critical condition, and that's scary for fans."

I have nothing against NLG, but I do wish this game had either not been developed or not branded and skinned as a Metroid Prime game. It very well may be entertaining. I'm just tired of non-fans (and some fans) saying that fans who find this game's clear departure from the beloved formula distasteful and voice that opinion are crybabies, entitled bitches, and the ""worst fucking kind of people"" that makes them sick to their stomachs."
Metroid,3a9q3x,Ranex_N,2,Thu Jun 18 10:09:33 2015 UTC,I don't think so. I read a comment from the developer and it sounds like he was saying the new game he wants to make is going to have a lot more involvement of the galactic federation or whatever it's called. So this game has a lot of story to prime you for a new entry. Haha pun not intended but embraced. Personally I think it's an excuse for wanting to make a different genre game and not having a lot under their belt so they tie it to the only fame they have. But either way it looks like a new metroid is in the cards. The only unfortunate thing is it will likely be a first person shooter like the other prime games since he said he's not involved in the production of 2d metroid titles.  :\
Metroid,3a9q3x,captain_underpants85,2,Thu Jun 18 11:11:04 2015 UTC,he was saying the new game he wants to make is going to have a lot more involvement of the galactic federation   That sucks. The Galactic Federation is pretty much the worst part of each game they appear in.

Not only does it go against the tradition of strong single player adventure focus, the art style is not at all Metroid. Beyond that, I watched the Treehouse video of the gameplay and it looks to me like the opposite of fun. Movement speed looks comparable to a waddling penguin and the areas look empty and lifeless without the promise of exploration and secrets. I feel like they were hamming it up for the camera."

Even if Federation Force had been a legit Metroid game and not some lame sports arena game, I'd have still been extremely disappointed that it was on the 3DS and not the Wii U.   I'm not saying stop making games for the 3DS. I would love, love, love to have a classic sidescrolling Metroid on a handheld. But save your 3D Metroid games for the home console.   Simply put, 3DS graphics are just looking really dated. And it seems like every few months, you see someone from Nintendo whining about hard it is to make HD games.

Starting off with the Chozo would be an excellent way to introduce a tutorial as well. I'm not sure how I feel about the 2D games being made prime style, however.  In regards to the pad being used instead of visors... that gets tricky. There are some relatively fast-paced scans in the game (bosses, amongst others) that balancing that with smooth gameplay would be rather difficult to do. From an aesthetic standpoint I do like the idea, however. If they can balance it with Starfox, you can't rule it out here.  In regards to melee attacks, I'm not sure how I feel about that. Outside of Smash Bros., it's never really been Samus' thing. I kinda considered the Grapple Lasso from Prime 3 to be a close equivalent to that, however, so perhaps seeing that utilized more would be interesting to see."

Nintendo has neglected Metroid fans for too long and I think it's time they gave us what we deserve.   Metroid 5.    A deep story with tons of lore to sift through. Not a filler arc with samus going to some planet to destroy space Cthulhu again and losing all of her powerups right afterwards. Tons of new powerups. All of the old mainstays are there too. Realistic characterization for Samus. Maybe the game could go into her backstory, give us more information about the Chozo, or even show us what Samus' personality is actually like. A massive world to explore. It could have fire areas, ice areas, technological areas, pretty much every possible world a Metroid game could have, and everything in between. When I'm playing the game, I want to think, ""Wow, am I even halfway through?"" More information on the space pirates and the galactic federation Full 3D environments.

He literally said:    I haven't been able to collect a team or the resources to do it.   That's pretty disheartening. It sounds like over the 5 year hiatus no one has been working on the series in any way (outside of MP:FF). Who's to say if Nintendo will ever feel like making another main-line game?   It's clear that Nintendo is content with releasing Metroid games almost a decade apart. So I'm going to stop getting my hopes up every year at E3 for some news.

I just see nothing about it that screams Metroid. I am also once again disappointed at Nintendo's attempt to interest the Japanese audience in Metroid. According to Tanabe, Blast Ball and the chibi art style was added in to try and get the Japanese audience interested.   I think a spin off following the Federation is a cool idea but this is not the right approach. Something that really examines the war (it is a war right?) between the Federation and Space Pirates has great potential...as a console game. I really don't like the idea of a first person shooter on a handheld."
Metroid,3a63gl,breakmanblues,2,Wed Jun 17 18:04:48 2015 UTC,"get the Japanese audience interested.   Yup. Because that worked so well last time.  Any more things they wanna change for them? Make Samus a guy, or something?"

Metroid,3a63gl,lastpally,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:46:23 2015 UTC,"Call it a hunch, but I think this artstyle was also partially chosen because of performance. It's a shooting game; if it can't run at 60 fps, it's no good. On a handheld like the 3ds (with lacking processing power) you're gonna need to make sacrifices, usually in the graphical department. A simplified artstyle helps a ton. IMO Prime Hunters is one of the ugliest games on the DS for this reason; it tried to replicate something running on far more powerful hardware.  Also, FPS games have NEVER done well in Japan. Making it Chibi/soccer won't change that."
Metroid,3a63gl,K1llerrrCarrot,2,Thu Jun 18 22:31:33 2015 UTC,Umm. Hunters was one of the nicest looking DS games.
Metroid,3a63gl,lastpally,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:21:13 2015 UTC,"I did say it was just my opinion.  Also, how good your fps looks is not very important if the frame rate is low and unstable. Game runs at 30 and even dips below that sometimes. That´s... less than stellar."
Metroid,3a63gl,Father_Brain,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:46:51 2015 UTC,Like you said. The game performance suffered from the underpowered hardware. It wasn't really hunters fault. Hunters would look terrible compare to most PSP games released at that time but I can bet it would have ran great on PSP level hardware. But hunters is a 10+year old handheld game and still look just as good as FF(judging by the trailer) in terms of graphics....without the chibi crap.

It does make more sense as a attempt to appeal to the Japanese and possibly younger audience."
Metroid,3a63gl,RidleySmashBros,11,Thu Jun 18 21:05:50 2015 UTC,"Reposting something I made a thread for that got mostly ignored, but where I try to shed some optimism on the whole thing.  Yes, I'm also a little sad that no Meroid was announced this year, but it has been a day and I guess most people have cooled down (I have), and can look at Federation Force with a clearer head.  Ok, is not a ""core"" Metroid game, this post isn't about that.  Mario can go play tennis, soccer, go to the olympics, race in karts, have party board games, among other bazzillion things, and that is ok for Mario, he is ""generic-ish"" in the sense that you look at him and you can't really say ""this character should only jump on koopas"".  Wich brings me to Samus. Look at Samus' design, super-high-tech-chozo-space-suit-awesome-armor. What else can she do other than save the galaxy time and time again? What can she do that is on par with exploding planets and fighting godzilla monsters other than... well... explode planets and fight godzilla monsters? Race on F-Zero? Help Fox and Falco in Sector Z? nah man. Samus is badass, but that might be a little hard to express if you don't have a comparison point, and here is where Federation Force comes in.  Look, the little gameplay we saw shows a team of 4 heavily armored federation soldiers struggling to capture a couple of hoppers (they looked like hoppers), something wich Samus would have skipped over, or she probably would have blasted them with 2-3 shots of her plasma beam or a power bomb or something. On this aspect, Federation Force is great, the setting we saw was similar to pendrana drifts from MP1, where there were the sheegots and baby sheegots that Samus handed on her own and with no previous information on them, in FF we have a team of 4 guys with (probably) previous information on the creatures, the layout of the terrain, assistance from whatever Federation starship is nearby and who knows what else, they fell down often and had to get help from their teammates, the creatures were giving them a lot of trouble, but in the end after 10 minute or something they managed to do what they had to, something that Samus could have done in like... a minute?  I think Nintendo is actually trying to do it the best way they can, and they have shown us they can do it right (remember Metroid Prime)."
Metroid,3a63gl,PhazonZim,4,Sun Jun 21 20:11:11 2015 UTC,"I just think that timing on this thing was awful. After 8 years since last good Metroid game was released and 10 years since 2D Metroid game was released, we get a spin-off of all things and it just rides on the franchise's name. If it would be announced around 2004-2008, then it would be ok and would be a nice distraction like Metroid Prime Pinball and Metroid Prime Hunters. But not in the dark age of Metroid. Its kinda like Banjo Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts except it at least keeps FPS part of Metroid Prime (which is one of the least important part of Metroid Prime games), but thats it.   None of this is really the game's fault (well, graphics still are kinda ugly for a 3DS game). Its just bad timing. But if it really isn't considered a spin-off, then they completly f***ed everything up because they removed what made Metroid, well, Metroid and instead kept the worst part of Metroid Prime (first person camera and more-or-less combat mechanics)...and Prime designs. Those weren't bad."

That being said, I don't think Nintendo should be exempt from our spite or criticism. They're pretty much the only ones on whom blame can be placed at the moment, and I don't mind saying, calmly and eloquently, that they ought to be held responsible for what many consider a betrayal - if derailing a massive hype train can be described as betrayal, of course."
Metroid,3a63gl,TheZaxvo,3,Sat Jun 20 17:14:56 2015 UTC,I think this may have been one of the biggest hype trains Nintendo has ever derailed.

Metroid,3a63gl,Frandaman760,8,Thu Jun 18 04:25:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying the game is going to be bad. hell it might be a lot of fun. However it felt like a total slap in the face to have it branded as a Metroid game. it completely goes against the serious tone that the Metroid games have always had. And since it has been 8 years since our last good title, this just felt like a huge disappointment. it made me wonder if Nintendo actually still cares about Metroid at all, given our last actual installment,  then the news of this game."
Metroid,3a63gl,zetzo27,4,Thu Jun 18 17:10:58 2015 UTC,"I see no reason to believe that Federation Force was ever not a Metroid Game.   For whatever reason, they didn't mention Blast Ball's connection to Metroid, but it's clear from the hud and gameplay that it was based on Prime's design. And just to say, I wasn't impressed at the reveal during NWC, a few minutes later after watching it I changed my mind. Reminds me of Grifball from Halo, just some simple fun.   So I think the idea that they just slapped the name on their is unfounded. Perhaps they always meant for Blast Ball to be a part of Federation Force, perhaps they were thinking about making it a solo release. In that case, they probably chose not to call it a Metroid game. In any case, it seems to me that both are clearly made with the Prime formula.   Either way, I think both games were designed with the idea of multiplayer first, which is likely why they chose a more colorful design to increase it's marketability. I don't really mind it. I don't see game franchises(even my favorites) as these static things that shouldn't be experimented with.   And I'm fairly certain Nintendo cares about the franchise, it's just never brought the consistent numbers that they would like so it's had massive lulls in game releases.   Honestly, I think this game will sell fairly well and will help garner interest in the franchise, especially among younger generations."
Metroid,3a63gl,MetroAndroid,6,Fri Jun 19 01:19:41 2015 UTC,i'll take this like another metroid prime pinball: a game that i won't play
Metroid,3a63gl,NOBLExGAMER,8,Wed Jun 17 16:17:48 2015 UTC,"Incoming Text Wall:   The game appears to have been designed around a multiplayer experience, which means it's more than likely going to be a lackluster single-player experience for anyone who is unwilling or unable to find someone to play with. Unlike Monster Hunter, which was designed to accommodate both people who hunt alone and those who hunt with friends, this looks like a game that if you're playing alone, you won't have as much fun. Games designed around co-op usually have simplified objectives so as not to hinder the less-skilled players on a team, and to accommodate for a team's possible lack of coordination. Maybe there will be a more robust single-player experience, but I haven't seen it.  Yes, the game has online play, but a lack of voice chat (which has not been confirmed and almost certainly won't be in there) will definitely hinder the experience. When the mission objectives are as focused as we've seen in the trailers and Treehouse demonstrations, not being able to co-ordinate strategies is going to hurt.  The absolute best thing Nintendo could have done so far is to demo what the game plays like as a Single-player game. Instead, they have chosen to only show multiplayer, which is a VERY big mistake. The 3DS is not a multiplayer-focused machine in North America. Even though it's online game and thus the barrier to entry is lower than a local-only game, there are other, more robust alternatives available to current owners. This game, by my estimate, looks like a solid ""7"", but most people don't want to spend $39.99 on 7's. It looks like Metroid Prime Lite, the federation grunts lack the appeal that Samus herself has, the music is generic; nothing about this game looks like something I desperately want to have, or anyone wants to, really.  If there's a true gem of a game buried underneath what we've seen, Nintendo has done an amazing job of hiding it. This game's fate is sealed.   —Sean from off of DK Vine   This seems like it's going to be an okay online multiplayer game, but all the defining single-player aspects aside from basic mechanics look like they've been dropped. Look for instance at Echoes, yes it has multiplayer, but it has a level set-up that's very vertical and claustrophobic and dark, allows you to hide, you can go morph ball into air vents and surprise people, you can get power-ups that last for a short time. There're so many little things that make it feel Metroid.   I've seen lots of people who aren't into Metroid like the game well enough and call those who complain about it whiny, but the ""true fans"" have lots of problems with it that have to do with the context of its release and it (seeming to) go against basic tenets of the series (Metroid has never felt generic or ""phoned in"" unless sequels are inherently phoned in).  As for the voice chat, I didn't even think to ask about it. I assumed it would be in there. If there's not voice chat in this incredibly cooperative online shooting game, that would honestly knock it down an entire point alone for me. You NEED to be able to communicate with your team instantly when every moment can be the difference between life and death.  The best comment to describe how I feel about this game:   ""If you took metroid off the title you would not believe this is a metroid game :(""   —alcidiow    I'm not complaining about the cartooniness, about the lack of Samus, any of that. From the moment I saw it, the thing I found wrong with it is that it fundamentally feels like a completely different game series that they just changed the character models and tweaked the HUD a few weeks before E3. Maybe it'll change and the atmosphere gets better and the trailer didn't represent it well.  The worst part is, it's subtle things that are not easy to convey to others like the fact that it seems to be focusing more on blindly shooting shit and progressing in missions rather than collecting new abilities and exploring a vast world while at the same time touting that this is going to be very Metroid singleplayer-esque experience but with friends. Shooting things has always taken a back seat to more important concepts in Metroid despite seeming to be such an important element.  Lastly, it feels...limp. Aside from one game (you know which), every single Metroid game has perfected (minding the implications of the word ""perfect"") what it set out to do (even true of Metroid Pinball). But everything about the game feels tacked on. Like they got a call last week, ""WE NEED A NEW METROID AND YOU GUYS HAVE THE CLOSEST THING TO IT. HERE'S SOME MONEY. GET ON IT!"" The characters are unimaginative generic clones, not ""new cartoony original characters everyone is complaining about"" as some detractors have implied; they're Samus clones but without the interesting back story. Nearly every change I've seen doesn't add so much as it takes away from the series. This game really doesn't deserve a vitriolic reaction. It deserves a lukewarm reaction. And that's the very reason why we dislike it so much. We're used to excellence. At least with Other M, it was very clear-cut to discuss the problems with others.  It's probably going to be a fun enough game with the multiplayer support, but why did it have to be like this? To use a JonTron quote, ""It's actually nice to see something with a hint of originality, but this is not the way to do it. This should've been called TipTup: Nuts & Bolts! Why slap Banjo-Kazooie on this?"""
Metroid,3a63gl,MetroAndroid,2,Thu Jun 18 03:11:12 2015 UTC,"It's actually nice to see something with a hint of originality, but this is not the way to do it. This should've been called TipTup: Nuts & Bolts! Why slap Banjo-Kazooie on this   There's a big difference between Metroid Prime: Federation Force and Banjo-Kazooie Nuts & Bolts, Federation Force is a SPIN-OFF and acknowledged as such while Nuts & Bolts was a MAIN SERIES ENTRY. Had Federation Force been treated as a main series entry in the Metroid universe I might agree with you but it's not and never was meant to be so holding it to the standard and rules of the main entry Metroid Prime games is unjustified."
Metroid,3a63gl,NOBLExGAMER,0,Wed Jun 17 17:21:04 2015 UTC,"I'd say they're both about equal on the spin-off to main-series-entry scale. If looking at name only, Federation Force moreso because of the Prime moniker.  Additionally, one of my main gripes with Federation Force is that it seems like it's trying to be main series Metroid with co-op (with the very watered-down Prime gameplay) and spin-off Metroid simultaneously and outright failing at main series Metroid and mildly succeeding at spin-off.   What even leads you to believe Nuts & Bolts is a main series entry at all? ""It's on a home console""? Aside from that, I can't find anything leading to that assumption whatsoever. At any rate, I think spin-off games should at least try to keep some of what makes a series work, rather than just throwing together some basic elements of the series and calling it ""Metroid.""  Metroid Pinball was fine; I wasn't angry at all. But this game makes so many angry. Why? There's a reason for it, and it's not ""OH GAMERS SO ENTITLED"" which is the easy way out so many take rather than truly examining the situation."
Metroid,3a63gl,MayorOfRedwood,2,Wed Jun 17 18:09:54 2015 UTC,"What even leads you to believe Nuts & Bolts is a main series entry at all? ""It's on a home console""?   The fact that Nuts & Bolts was presented as such with the advertising leading up to it's launch, specifically this trailer. Federation Force wasn't presented as more than what it was, which is a spin-off, and only was only given a small part in E3 presentation to represent such. Tanabe even said during the E3 stream that this isn't Metroid Prime 4 but just a small side story that he has wanted to do for quite some time now so acting like Federation Force is more than what it is is ridiculous."

Metroid,3a63gl,Crystalline3,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:35:51 2015 UTC,"The world building is good but damn is the game cheesy.  I wouldn't mind a spin off focusing on the Federation, but why like this? It always looked like some eshop title to me, even when it was the painfully generic ""blast ball"""
Metroid,3a63gl,twinfyre,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:55:29 2015 UTC,"Everyone just needs to relax.  Yes, I'm a tad disappointed--and I'm sure the fans are as well--that we're not getting a main series Metroid game made by Retro Studios, and that after all these years they chose to throw a spin-off title our way, but saying the game's going to be horrible, and worse yet, demanding it to be cancelled, is ridiculous.  Who knows? They're probably working on a main series game as we speak. Just because they didn't announce a whole bunch of exciting stuff at E3, doesn't mean they won't announce it soon or some other time.   In conclusion: people are jumping the gun and blowing things out of proportions."
Metroid,3a63gl,Whelt,2,Mon Jun 22 07:21:45 2015 UTC,"I thought It would blow over after a few days, but it turns out I'm still pretty mad. Not only did they create that strange mockery of the metroid series (and said it took place in ""the Metroid Prime universe"" to add extra insult to injury), but they also revealed that they were never actually working on anything Metroid related in the first place. I got a Wii U to play the new Metroid. Now I'm stuck with a $200 smash bros machine. and I'll have to buy the newer model for the exact same reason I bought the wii u. And it probably won't get anything Metroid related anyway."

Metroid,3a63gl,Tankmin,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:30:48 2015 UTC,"I think it looks like a fun game, my only problem with it is how they slapped the Prime name on it. Captain Toad isn't called ""Super Mario: Captain Toad."" I think it would have done fine with just ""Federation Force"" or something similar. I do think it looks like fun, and I do think that hearing a story from a different perspective is nifty."
Metroid,3a63gl,Earth_Pony,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:48:56 2015 UTC,"Watch the treehouse before jumping the gun, it might not be GOTY but it looks really fun! depending on reviews I might buy it with a friend. The biggest mistake was putting it on 3ds. Personally I haven't had good experience with fps games on handhelds due to controls. This would have been perfect on wii u! Better controls, maybe more realistic proportions on the GF troops, etc. The idea of customizing your trooper before going out on a mission, while done before and probably better in other games, will help the game stay fresh. Graphically it would be fine EXCEPT they chose a chibi art style. What the hell? It would have been fine if they were taller, had longer legs, and a smaller helmet. This is a game that takes itself seriously from what I can tell. Can we not get an art style that reflect that? The colors and lighting were much better (especially on other maps) than what they looked like in the shitty e3 trailer."

Metroid,3a63gl,Vizria,5,Wed Jun 17 20:27:40 2015 UTC,I don't get this either. Since when was it necessary for a game to have Samus in it to actually be a Metroid game? There have been enough series that switch up their protagonist every now and then and are still regarded as good entries in said series.
Metroid,3a63gl,Johnthedragon,-4,Fri Jun 19 14:11:37 2015 UTC,But nobody is acting out of pure anger or rage. O_o  All of the posts from fans are actually civil. The only ones who're even going on about irrationality are the ones trying to force people to like the game.

Normally if a game is not what people want, they don't buy it and move on with their lives. :/  I don't like Star Fox, never did. I don't want it. By your logic I should petition to get Star Fox Zero cancelled, right? Screw all those people that might want to play it, right?  Getting this game cancelled is taking away an enjoyable experience from people who may like this style of gameplay. Don't be an idiot."
Metroid,3a63gl,K1llerrrCarrot,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:38:57 2015 UTC,Not buying it isn't the only option. And what do you mean this style of gameplay? It's a freaking skeleton of a game.

Metroid,3a63gl,Johnthedragon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:34:43 2015 UTC,"All I'm saying is that it fills a niche on the system. If you google FPS games for 3DS, you mostly come up with people asking for good ones and other people suggesting backwards compatible DS games, since there are so little available. There is a market for these types of games and the devs are now reaching out to this market. This has nothing to do with the game being good or bad (assuming either one is useless at this point in time).  Don't start talking about quality for a game you (and pretty much everyone else on this planet) didn't play yet. It might be shit, sure, but it might just as well be a very good game. Looking at the developers track record, I'm hopeful. You can assume whatever you want, but don't act like your assumptions are any more than that; baseless assumptions. My hopes and assumptions for this game are useless as well, which is why I don't actually put them out here.  Which brings me to your arguments, which are all terrible. They are all based on this assumption that the game is bad, which I have pointed out multiple times already, is a stupid assumption to make at this point in time. I'm not going to reply to you anymore. I have said the same things at least 3 times. I don't think you're gonna bring up interesting new points for this discussion.  Have a good day."

Metroid,3a57e2,tonicodrea,37,Wed Jun 17 10:09:42 2015 UTC,"The game does look fun. But what's upsetting people - particularly us here on /r/Metroid, is the art style and direction. Metroid has always had a very serious atmosphere, and is one of Nintendo's more realistic franchises, and this game looks very cartoony, and that's just not what anybody expects of a Metroid game.  Even though it doesn't include Samus I'd be ecstatic if we got what OP is suggesting, even if it was on the 3DS with limited graphics, I like that realism better."
Metroid,3a57e2,Koog330,16,Wed Jun 17 10:55:54 2015 UTC,"The game looks ""OK"" but it's not getting me excited. It doesn't feel like a AAA Netroid game, like even Metroid Hunter had.

The labels and tags are what marketers create to manipulate consumers.  - I guess it worked, because you guys are all brainwashed now.  Apparently, If a game isn't 'AAA' then it isnt worth '60 dollars', and therefore must be crap and is worth maybe 5 bucks during a digital-sale or something."

It's fine if a smaller company makes a less 'AAA' game, but don't go around realistically wanting $60 for it. Nintendo and the metroid franchise has so much time and money that they had better make at least a good game, worth ouur $60."

Metroid,3a57e2,CrossFox42,2,Wed Jun 17 20:46:07 2015 UTC,The major problem here is its not a metroid game. It's like they slapped on the title in hopes it would help sell copies.

Metroid,3a57e2,maximumhamburgers,2,Wed Jun 17 13:54:31 2015 UTC,"The game doesn't have a plot. It's just missions like 'Capture this monster'. Have you seen the gameplay video? They spend the whole thing capturing 'ice monsters' (whatever those are) and not much of anything else. No story, just repeat action sequences and blast ball. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wx5now2XJo  Edit: I can't be sure as to whether or not the game actually has a plot, however I still think this was a huge issue with the presentation. It was way too vague. Yes it's coop, yes it's multiplayer soccer, yes it has 'missions'... but is that the whole game? Can we expect a campaign mode with single player? Or is it strictly mini-missions with multiplayer only?   They only just released details on the new Zelda 'three swords' game... confirming you can play online/single player. These are the important details."

Metroid,3a57e2,twinfyre,2,Wed Jun 17 15:57:18 2015 UTC,So this is actually what they originally had planned before they went with the chibi art style? Or did you just create an album of realistic federation related pictures?

If I look past the unusual choice on art style (for a Metroid game, anyway), and how they showed off the Blastball part of the game first (a mistake if you ask me). This could be an interesting spin-off to keep people aware of the series until a real Metroid game comes out."
Metroid,3a66gr,Dubiono,7,Wed Jun 17 16:09:20 2015 UTC,"So it seems the Chibi look was inevitable? Then what about Hunters? That game wasn't the prettiest, but it tried.   Edit: While I'm at it, what about Resident Evil Revelations? That game looked absolutely fine."
Metroid,3a66gr,Father_Brain,18,Wed Jun 17 15:45:08 2015 UTC,"As far as character design goes, the 3DS screens are relatively small. This means there's limitations to where cameras can be placed. A tall character or enemy could be difficult to be display, while a stockier character, like the mech, fits the hardware and fits the game better. It makes it better to play. I'll admit, I thought at the start that it might lose the seriousness of the Metroid Prime series and become a little comical, but once I played it, I believe it delivers on the feel of the other game.   That explanation is bogus. If the proportions in Hunters worked then they could have made it work here.   The design of the game goes against the realistic style that has been established in the Metroid series. They're throwing away the dark and mysterious vibe by having chibi characters and bright, primary colored visors. It makes no sense to me because even in the other spin off game Metroid Prime: Pinball, the characters were presented realistically. I think the best explanation is that this was originally a demo project that they later decided to label as a Metroid game.   I actually like the look of the gameplay, but all of the other Metroid qualities that I've grown to love are simply not there."
Metroid,3a66gr,lm794,4,Wed Jun 17 16:33:24 2015 UTC,"It is absolutely a bogus explanation. I had a small hope the call of fans would reach out enough to change the design a little, but with that explanation I'm afraid he may think it's too justified to bother >_<"

Metroid is about ambiance and has always had a realistic style going for it. This is not the time to experiment with an alternate style.   And yes, this would have compromised their ability to be as large as Metroids are, it would have been preferable to this.

Metroid,3a9k32,AuraRyu,2,Thu Jun 18 09:08:35 2015 UTC,"Playing devil's advocate here.  The interview doesn't ever say that they are making Prime 4, it's just him saying if (although it seems to be a very likely if) it was being made, it would take x amount of time."

Metroid,3a9k32,LuxShadow1,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:55:47 2015 UTC,I think what Tanabe wanted to say is that he'd like to make a new Metroid game because he'd already have an idea what it would be about storywise.
Metroid,3a9jam,Typs59,37,Thu Jun 18 08:27:47 2015 UTC,"Letting yourself be heard =/= crying and attacking the spin off game. You should let your wish for a new main metroid be heard, and let that be the main message.     Right now the message that is being send is : we don't like the 'new metroid game' announcement. Not : ' we don't like the lack of a new 'true' metroid game"
Metroid,3a9jam,henryuuk,-10,Thu Jun 18 11:20:24 2015 UTC,"That's a very good point, but i think the message should be a mixture of both: ""We dislike the federation game because we expected (and want) a new 'true' metroid game, but the game itself is fine"" that way nintendo can easily understand why there was so much hate generated by this game, which would avoid a potential cancelation."
Metroid,3a9jam,quantum_titties,12,Thu Jun 18 11:58:37 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't be a mixture of both, imo.  I want Metroid to get spin-offs. I want Metroid to get more popular because I want more fans to demand it.  What I don't want is axing traditional Metroid games and expecting that to satisfy fans.  That's what I want Nintendo to hear.  What I don't want is to have Nintendo feel the Metroid fan base is too rigid for the game to expand into common popularity."
Metroid,3a9jam,Dubiono,9,Thu Jun 18 13:29:36 2015 UTC,"If Nintendo got the wrong message from the Other M controversy, (when it was loud and clear what the problems were) I don't see them understanding the message behind this."

Metroid,3a9jam,thekamenman,5,Thu Jun 18 14:33:13 2015 UTC,"You have it completely backwards, Earthbound was localized because Nintendo saw it could be profitable for them. Fans were pleading and backing it up with checkbooks. You need to look at this like a company would, you just announced something that you believe people wanted and there was such a large public outcry against it that there is a petition demanding it's cancellation. A company will look at that regardless of the reasoning behind the petition and say, ""oh well I guess people don't want this."" And no more Metroid, Nintendo is infamous for things like this. If you had read the interviews of the director you would see that they are using this as a spring board to build the Metroid universe even deeper and set up for future installments. Bitching and moaning does nothing, Mother fans have proven that they are patient, humble, and grateful for any sign that our series still has some life of another, but most importantly we backed it up with money."

Metroid,3a9jam,NOBLExGAMER,3,Thu Jun 18 15:39:27 2015 UTC,"No, attacking the spin-off game doesn't send a message that you want a new main series Metroid title it tells Nintendo you don't like this new spin-off they are working on. If you want to make your plea for a new main series Metroid title heard blow up Nintendo's Twitter/Facebook and go to their ""Contact Us"" page and tell them you want another main series Metroid game but don't attack a game that isn't released yet and expect it to do the same thing."
Metroid,3a9jam,AbsoluteRunner,0,Thu Jun 18 13:52:55 2015 UTC,no it doesnt. Everyone bitched about Metroid: Other M and all nintendo got was that people don't like metroid games anyone even though fans were perfectly clear about what was wrong with it.
Metroid,3a9jam,NOBLExGAMER,2,Thu Jun 18 14:51:09 2015 UTC,If all Nintendo got from the complaints of Other M was people don't like Metroid they wouldn't have done Federation Force. Complaining to Nintendo that you don't want the spin-off is entirely different from complaining about the lack of a main series entry.
Metroid,3a9jam,isienmai,0,Thu Jun 18 15:09:34 2015 UTC,"I think it could be very easy for nintendo to read mass hate for this game as simply dislike for metroid as a whole. They have no way of knowing if your dislike is legitimate dislike for federation force, or some kind of protest.  If you want your voice heard you should really make it clear what you are saying. Instead of the ""cancel federation force"" petition, a ""create a REAL metroid game"" petition would be much more likely to get the message across."
Metroid,3a9jam,badwolf422,0,Thu Jun 18 11:34:03 2015 UTC,"Good idea! I would love to start a petition like that but, as you problably noticed, english isn't my mother tongue. Is there anyone who could right one or two paragraph explaining why the spin-off created so much backlash? Don't bash the game, just explain that it isn't what we expected, and that we really want a new classic metroid."
Metroid,3a9jam,BlockyAnubis,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:14:11 2015 UTC,"The problem is that petitioning a company has almost never worked for anything. Especially Nintendo, who are legendarily bad at recognizing fan feedback."

Metroid,3a9jam,Satiie,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:57:22 2015 UTC,"The sad truth is, Metroid has the biggest cry babies out of Nintendo's core franchises. Metroid Other: M, ""YOU MADE SAMUS LOOK LIKE A WHINY WOMAN"" (Who cares) Federation Force, ""NOT A REAL METROID GAME"" (But it is) Smash Bros, ""WE WANT RIDLEY PLAYABLE"" (Your fucking crazy....)  Here I am waiting for a new F-Zero game since GX/AX and you guys literally had a full Metroid only a few years ago. While knowing nothing about it, they feel like they have been screwed over by someone doing a service for them. Nintendo doesn't have to make games for YOU. They can always work on other projects and other ip's instead of working on a game that won't sell at all. If you want a game, don't wait around for one, download Unity or some shit and make it yourself.  In all honest, you guys just keep holding your breath in your little temper tantrum. Metroid is not a top franchise at Nintendo and you need to face the reality that Metroid really isn't in need of a new hardcore game. I'm sorry."

I'm sure it will be a good game, nice to hear Metroids and Samus will at least appear in the game somewhere. Still pretty disappointed though, hopefully some adjustments are made to alleviate the situation, after all, the game has awhile to come out, and it really looks far from done. The hints at a new Prime with Sylux is nice, but could go either way and it seems work hasn't even begun on it yet. It's frustrating to hear multiple companies and people in Nintendo have ideas for Metroid, yet this is the one that gets chosen."
Metroid,3a715j,Wombo194,5,Wed Jun 17 19:32:16 2015 UTC,"All I really want is a new 2d Metroid, I've never played any of the Prime games, so I'd have to catch up and play them before Metroid Prime 4. Though, this spinoff game looks cool."
Metroid,3a715j,Divemissile,2,Wed Jun 17 20:43:28 2015 UTC,There are many metroid-inspired games available. I highly recommend Shadow Complex for the 360. Xeodrifter on steam/3DS is also quite good.
Metroid,3a715j,Divemissile,2,Wed Jun 17 20:46:39 2015 UTC,"Those sound cool. I'll check them out, thanks."
Metroid,3a715j,badwolf422,4,Wed Jun 17 21:19:08 2015 UTC,I think it's interesting that this was originally planned to be a New 3DS launch title. I don't think there'd be nearly as much outrage about this title if it was. I think people would be better able to appreciate it as a spin-off game designed to show off the New 3DS while we wait for the real Metroid.
Metroid,3a715j,DuelistDeCoolest,3,Wed Jun 17 19:31:51 2015 UTC,In fact he told me he wanted Federation Force to launch when the New 3DS did and apologized for the wait.    That's not exactly the apology fans are looking for.
Metroid,3a715j,Ryuutakeshi,3,Wed Jun 17 22:18:39 2015 UTC,"Stephen asked some pretty good questions there, but I'm still a little disappointed with the answers. Tanabe kept talking about us understanding the game better when we got our hands on it, but the only thing we can actually experience is the sports mini-game that is so far removed from Metroid that it's so weird seeing the Metroid name on it.   Maybe my thoughts on this game will change when we see more, but right now we're playing a game that doesn't feel like Metroid, doesn't exactly look like Metroid, and has very few Metroid qualities to it. If there's only one mission with Samus and the Metroid species, then it feels more like a cameo than anything else.  I never really wanted to see the Federation from the eyes of the Federation. Other M and Fusion did little to endear the federation to me. I haven't played the Prime games completely yet so I don't have that to go on. I don't really care about the Federation unless we're experiencing it from Samus' perspective and seeing it in person. Doing missions that normally Samus would be undertaking but doing it as the Federation doesn't really do it for me.   (Also, Samus does this shit solo. The federation needs 4 guys to equal one Sammy :p )"

Metroid,3a2ng9,YoshiYogurt,-33,Wed Jun 17 06:35:34 2015 UTC,"I don't agree. Worst smash game by far in my opinion, both casually and competitively."
Metroid,3a2ng9,DLOGD,18,Wed Jun 17 08:02:33 2015 UTC,"Brawl was almost objectively the worst and it was still a great, fun game."
Metroid,3a2ng9,ScrabCrab,-5,Wed Jun 17 10:00:52 2015 UTC,"With a 2gb SD card? Kappa  Brawl was fine, but I think Sm4sh is a bit worse than Brawl."
Metroid,3a2ng9,Zero-Striker,4,Wed Jun 17 13:35:00 2015 UTC,IMO Smash 4 is streets ahead of Brawl
Metroid,3a2ng9,ScrabCrab,0,Wed Jun 17 13:36:42 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm gonna be honest, I'm rather mixed about both games.  Brawl's amazing for modding (PM 4 lyfe.), and it did have some unique tech that were unfortunately removed from Sm4sh (RIP Dacus and chaingrabs.), or overshadowed by the satanic tripping. Tripping and the defensive options SEVERELY crippled Brawl's competitive play.  Sm4sh improved in some areas, but at the same time took many steps back from what Brawl introduced. Basically having no tech skill, shields are much stronger, and ledge hogging was removed.  Sakurai made a lot of silly excuses in Sm4sh, as well. Such as Ridley being absent as a fighter because it wouldn't fit his character if he was resized (WHICH IS BULLSHIT.)  I'll admit balancing's a bit better now, but I'm not gonna say everyone's viable, because that's clearly not the case. Low tiers are low tiers for a reason.  But I'd rather stick to Melee and PM IMO, I'm pissed that both communities aren't getting respect from Nintendo or any help."
Metroid,3a2ng9,Zero-Striker,6,Wed Jun 17 13:50:50 2015 UTC,"I'll admit balancing's a bit better now   It's a lot better. Melee and PM are fine, I play both but if you actually gave smash4 a try you'd see how great it is.  There's more to smash than wavedashing and L canceling. Smash4 has it's own set of tech that's being discovered."
Metroid,3a2ng9,YoshiYogurt,2,Wed Jun 17 15:43:46 2015 UTC,"I've been playing it since release (A bit less now, since I got Dolphin running for Melee.), but most tech that's being discovered is, in some cases, unviable (Or patched out).   I'm saying it's a fine casual game, but it won't really succeed in a competitive 1v1 environment.   What I mean by ""a bit better"" is that they did a LOT of balance changes to characters, but most characters got some unnecessary buffs and nerfs. (Marth, Regular Samus, Falco, and Meta Knight to an extent [He MOST CERTAINLY needed nerfs, but he got too many that weren't even problems] got some real unnecessary nerfs.)  Sm4sh will have it's fair share of unviable characters, as well. People played Falcon back in Brawl's early days, then look what happened."

Metroid,3a2ng9,Zero-Striker,2,Wed Jun 17 13:32:47 2015 UTC,"not really concerned with the ""competitively"" part, as thats one beehive i refuse to poke  but anyways, what new singleplayer stuff are you talking about? are you referring to the new gamemodes sakurai put in? because yeah i agree those are shite  but personally, i think smash4 gameplay itself is just fine. i love the enormous roster, i love how sakurai and sora know how to keep the hype flowing, love the music, the art, and all that other jazz  i mean, if i wanna wavedash ill just shut off the wii u and play projectm, we do have that choice"
Metroid,3a2ng9,legonro,-1,Wed Jun 17 14:12:20 2015 UTC,"Competitive Smash ain't bad, it's not a beehive like most casuals say it is. The communities welcome newcomers!   Yeah, the new gamemodes suck, Break the Targets became a shitty Angry Birds mode, Classic Mode is shit, custom grinding's fucking hell, All-Star mode's unlocked from the start, Smash Tour is just a fucking mess on it's own, etc etc.  In an 8 player environment, the gameplay is fine! But from what we've seen in a 1v1 environment... Ugh... It doesn't work. A lot of people believe that 4-8 player environments are the reasonings for all the silly mechanic choices. Sm4sh will never excell in a 1v1 environment, even with customs.  The roster's great, but I'm still rather ticked off at the lack of a new Metroid rep and the clones. (Specifically Dark Pit and Lucina.) The music is meh. (New remixes are great, but the Sm4sh main theme is fuckin obnoxious as hell now.)  You ARE right about that. If we wanna play Melee or Project M, we play those games. But I think it's the fact that it sort of... separates the communities? Brawl split the community due to it's changes (ultimately doing the opposite of what Sakurai wanted lol.), so the fact that Sm4sh is pretty much Brawl HD is rather obnoxious to fans who want the game to be more fast paced.  It's like Federations, almost. ""Do you want a new 2D Metroid game? Just play Super Metroid."" Is basically the message here.  But Melee ain't dying. We livin til 20XX, baybee."

Metroid,3a2ng9,legonro,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:40:15 2015 UTC,"All of the single player modes in Smash 4 are basically just different menus that all go straight to ""8 player smash with CPUs and items."" The old modes have been bastardized or removed and the new modes are some of the most poorly designed game modes I've ever seen (Smash Tour).   Multiplayer-wise, the combat is as watered down as it has ever been before. The same combat flaws that make it a terrible competitive game make it boring in a casual setting as well. Nothing is safe on shield, recoveries are ridiculous, slow and floaty gameplay... it's just dull. Everything about the game is just dull and soulless."

I would say 3/4 + a mod combining the best aspects of most of them is a pretty good record. Game series have bad entries sometimes, happens to all of them."

Metroid,3a2ng9,Dubiono,10,Tue Jun 16 20:15:11 2015 UTC,Axiom Verge on Steam has been scratching my Super Metroid itch recently.
Metroid,3a2ng9,Wybaar,14,Wed Jun 17 03:47:29 2015 UTC,It's a great game but I need more Samus in my life.
Metroid,3a2ng9,Deandalecc,10,Wed Jun 17 04:30:21 2015 UTC,Slapping the Metroid Name onto this thing is just disgraceful. My Salt Level is through the roof.
Metroid,3a2ng9,CMK1982,5,Wed Jun 17 06:29:59 2015 UTC,The trailer makes me wanna play Star Wars Republic Commandos.
Metroid,3a2ng9,Akran_Trancilon,7,Wed Jun 17 02:16:39 2015 UTC,"And honestly, I would love a Republic Commando style Metroid game where we play as a Galactic Federation Marine, but not with cartoony style they've shown us, and not as the first Metroid game in such a long time."
Metroid,3a2ng9,Ucatsuton,3,Wed Jun 17 11:23:04 2015 UTC,"It's not even good cartoony, I've seen great looking cartoon games.  It's shotty looking, I'm pretty sure republic commandos had better graphics."

It's a shame that the mission the tree house showed us was stupid as fuck. Not knowing what bounty hunters do was bad enough, but since when did marines become trappers?"

Metroid,3a2ng9,GoldenBoy25,8,Wed Jun 17 03:44:58 2015 UTC,Honestly I wouldn't mind this game if it came a year after a Samus oriented Metroid but the fact that its been 5 years since a Metroid game (and 8 years since a good Metroid game) makes it really insulting.

Metroid,3a2ng9,uberguby,2,Wed Jun 17 20:30:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah lol. I'm not even going to bother reading that much about an opinion which is plain and simply wrong. Metroid Prime is Metroid, that's it."
Metroid,3a2ng9,Ucatsuton,2,Wed Jun 17 21:16:57 2015 UTC,"I mean... I can see where the argument comes from? I am attracted the idea of ""Universe A is canon in Universe B but universe B isn't canon in universe A"". But I have a hard enough time getting a discussion going on what ""metroidvania"" means without playing true scotsman to metroid by itself.  Besides which... metroid prime IS super metroid in 3D. I get that there are differences but like... come on, it's getting close to supper time over here."
Metroid,3a2ng9,uberguby,2,Wed Jun 17 21:29:23 2015 UTC,But I'm scared by change! :(
Metroid,3a2ng9,skaalgard,-4,Wed Jun 17 14:47:31 2015 UTC,"They aren't Metroid. They are Metroid Prime. It's a side series. It's a separate, contained story. Otherwise, explain the lack of Phazon, any other Bounty Hunters (In view.) or, sheer amount of other 'side' characters in the other games.   Metroid. The first Metroid, was you, alone, against the world. You were given no friendly signs, no help of any kind. You have no contact with your superiors, because...you don't really have them.   Metroid II: Return of Samus. You are alone. Against the world. No 'side characters'. No yellow rubber line for you to follow. You find your own way. You get the power ups strewn in the planet's crust. You use them to save the Galaxy.   Super Metroid. You are alone. Against the world. You once again face off against terrifying creatures known only to this desolate world. New, and different artifacts are unearthed, giving you even more control and power than before.   Metroid Fusion. This was the game that came out alongside Prime. This was when things started going 'wrong'. It was no longer 'just you'. You were no longer on an alien world. You were commissioned to be a puppet in a geopolitical take-over of a Research Base. (Strangely, this is almost the exact same plot as Other M, with some very minor differences, like the X parasite and, the fact you now know more people than Adam and 'Justin'.)   Metroid Zero Mission. This sent us back to the basics. There was more interaction, as we'd been forced into the Prime universe, as well as the gigantic hint that Adam was not only alive and well, but saving your ass from the shadows. It did however, pit you, almost completely alone again, against the world. It even does us one better, by forcing us into a more helpless situation by taking away the Power Suit.   Not once in any of these games is Phazon mentioned, talked about or, hinted at. Not even in the Instruction Booklets of the early games. In the course of any projected canon you might be able to concoct for their inclusion there is always going to be at least one game that would have to take place after Prime. Most scenarios it's Fusion, others place the Prime series before all of Super Metroid and some even Return of Samus. If that was true. If the Galactic Federation had all that god damned firepower, why couldn't they just wipe Zebes and SR388 completely? Clearly they are willing to sacrifice billions of lives to meet their demands, that would be a cake walk to them. Further, if the Space Pirates had been developing or had any involvement with the Phazon experiments, why in the hell don't they have that power later? There is also no call to say ""Samus got rid of it all"" or ""It all went away"" in any fashion. Because if Samus and the Federation et al, can't rid the galaxy of Metroids, living creatures that seek out their prey aggressively...how on earth could they get rid of an entire substance that's clearly only known to a handful of cultures?  Hence, Prime has to be it's own canon. There's thousands of small little details that are in the Prime games, all meant to bolster and instill life into the backgrounds of the previous games. (I mean you spend more than half the game scanning for 'lore', there's gotta be something in the way of filler.) The problem is that some of those completely redact otherwise established canon.   Again, this is not to say that this is 'bad', or that it makes them less of a game at all. But just because it has ""Metroid"" in it's title doesn't make it 'Metroid'. Mario is Missing, Mario's Fun with Numbers, Mario's Time Machine, Mario Teaches Typing. None of these would be classed as ""canon"" to the Mario Franchise. Even with less pedantry in hand, we have the ""New Super Mario Bros."". Clearly titled with an additional word ""New"" to show how much it has 'changed' or been 'altered' for (what they hope is for) the better.  Mega Man has the X, Legends, Zero, Starforce, Battlenetwork and, ZX series. Almost none of them actually 'exist' together. (Yes, there's plenty of theories on this one, but very little is official past Zero's later years.)   Zelda is also the same way. Sure they title them all ""The Legend of Zelda"", but there now exist three entirely separate 'forms' of the Zelda series. The ""Cartoonish"" Link, which gives us Windwaker, Phantom Hour Glass and, Spirit Tracks. The ""Adult"" Or ""3D"" Link that debuted with Ocarina of Time, and would have some face lifts as he turned up in Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword. Then there's the 'original' Link. The one which spawned as a top-down adventure game, and gave birth to Link to the Past, one of the best SNES games out there. Then that same art-style was reused for the direct sequel Link Between Worlds.   Pokemon is one of the worst at this. There's the Main series, the Ranger, Rumble, TCG, and Mystery Dungeon games. Thankfully we don't have it in the states but there's also Battrio, which is an arcade game all about collecting 'pucks' with pokemon on them.   Further still are there games which bear the same titles, but have no connecting story. Final Fantasy is easily the most notorious of these. Yes there are connecting mechanics, a similar aesthetic and a shared mythology, but for the most part that's where all of the Final Fantasy titles stop being connected. Clearly here the argument could be made that it's these 'mechanics' or the 'culture' that connects them, and gives them their shared title. However these are explicitly not games where 'canon' matters on a larger scale, and thus when they want to make a 'sequel' they just call it ""Final Fantasy X-2"", not even bothering with the next in the numerical sequence.   Metroid, and Metroid Prime can't follow either of these lines of logic. They have a shared mythos for sure, but the wildly different ways that each series takes it is absolutely insane. On top of that, unless you count color palettes alone there's no real 'shared aesthetic'. There are common enemies that have been completely revamped. All the way to the Metroids themselves this goes. The last dredge of similarities in the looks alone are in the fact that most of the enemies have 'claws' or 'beaks'. Hardly a reasonable assertion as there's thousands of games with Birds and Bird-like things, and i can hardly suggest anyone add Billy Hatcher into the cannon of Mario Kart.  The other side of this is that they could share game-play styles. Zelda games are mostly Dungeon Crawler/Adventure games. Pokemon stick to a mostly RPG landscape. Mario, Sonic and, Mega Man have all had their best luck in the world of the Platformer. Metroid has very little in common gameplay wise with Prime.   The two closest ones would easily be Prime 1 and Super Metroid. Common suit, common items (Grappling Hook, Ice Beam, et cetera.), similar reliance on Save Rooms and basic Upgrades. That's almost where everything ends. Prime starts focusing you on Combat/Standing still and shooting/targeting things. Super Metroid throws you straight into a fairly open world, and lets you figure it the hell out. Prime makes you search for little Runes and Lore bits all over the place, feeding you hours upon hours of story. Super Metroid gives you only what you need: You are the Hero. They are the Enemy. They are stronger than you. You need to get stronger. Then you can win. That's what it takes to make a game: A goal to achieve. In Prime, half the time you don't even know if you are completing your objective unless you've looked up a guide or have already played it 30 times. Super Metroid lets you explore and find things as you go, and doesn't force you to go out of your way to find things. Every 15 minutes in Prime is a Morph Ball puzzle, which can be fun, or it can be frustrating because we (still today) haven't figured out how best to display a 3D landscape to a player.   (Many of these arguments might sound frail and loose ended, not actually proving or saying much. That is because i am tentative about expressing this opinion, and fear anything i say that could be taken as 'negative' against the Prime series, will be met with severe hostility.)  There are two final cases i'd like to point out, the first of which is the nomenclature.  Metroid. Metroid II: The Return of Samus. Super Metroid.  Metroid Fusion.  Metroid Zero Mission. Metroid Other M.   These all have the word 'Metroid' in them, yet, they are all stylized fairly uniquely. Insinuating that the title to a Metroid game can be whatever is most fitting to it's title.   Prime on the other hand:  Metroid Prime.  Metroid Prime II: Echoes. Metroid Prime Pinball.  Metroid Prime Hunters.  Metroid Prime III: Corruption. [Metroid Prime: Trilogy]  They all start with the words 'Metroid Prime'.   Mario and Luigi, Mega Man X, Super Puzzle Fighter. All games, with characters shared with bigger, more famous series, that changed their name to make a different 'type' of game.  And those titles in the side series stay super consistent. Hell, Puzzle Fighter just keeps tacking on words.  The only real difference, is that somehow, Prime became more popular than the original series.   My last, and most confounding argument in all of this, is also going to be the saving grace to anyone who manages to open up what i am already guessing is a very downvoted comment, and finds this monstrous wall of text:   tl;dr: Nintendo, in 2010, as Other M was coming out, gave a press release detailing some of the events and timelines of the Metroid Series. Any arguments that anyone could make about this is rendered entirely moot by this statement:    ""The Metroid Prime series is a separate collection of games featuring Samus Aran which has a different concept and game design to Metroid games.""   We didn't get a new Metroid game.   We got Metroid Prime Hunters 2: This time it's 'co-op'."
Metroid,3a2ng9,atra0,7,Wed Jun 17 16:39:31 2015 UTC,In Metroid Prime you're pretty alone no?
Metroid,3a2ng9,Cartossin,2,Wed Jun 17 18:15:20 2015 UTC,"Very much so. Not as much in Prime 3, but even that had its moments of isolation, like on the wreck of the G.F.S. Valhalla. Spooky."
Metroid,3a2ng9,Ucatsuton,0,Wed Jun 17 21:18:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it doesn't ever feel that way. Then when you get to the 3rd one, the game feels almost exactly like Halo with troops and NPCs everywhere."
Metroid,3a5err,ShikiRyumaho,12,Wed Jun 17 10:54:25 2015 UTC,"My kids and I love it. We've played it probably weekly since it came out. For my kids, who have been Metroid geeks since they could hold a controller, they love having their Mii in a  Samus suit and flying the gunship. It has its flaws even for what it is (Samus on foot is sloooooooow) but it doesn't pretend to be something it isn't - its a glorified mini-game to kill time with some identifiable Metroid elements. It also gave me hope that they were telling us ""look, the franchise isn't dead"", though I now know it could have easily have been ""we'll get a bunch of old nostalgic Americans to buy the Wii U just for this game since they won't shut up about it"".   That's part of what is really hacking me off about this upcoming title: you already gave us a holdover game in the Metroid universe that wasn't really a new Metroid game. We don't need another one!"
Metroid,3a5err,SilhouetteLie,3,Wed Jun 17 13:53:59 2015 UTC,It was alright. I wasn't a big fan of it. The plot was terrible and the atmosphere just wasn't the same. I don't consider it canon to the Metroid series.
Metroid,3a5err,Koog330,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:48:46 2015 UTC,"Blast Ball isn't the full game, just something to the side of the main game, which is a co-op shooter more like the Nintendo land attraction.   Video here: https://youtu.be/9wx5now2XJo?t=16m24s"

Metroid,3a6i8w,Ryuutakeshi,21,Thu Jun 18 01:26:28 2015 UTC,"He didn't say it's being held back.   He said that if they began right now, it would take them 3 years, which means they would likely release on the NX.   What we should take away from this is that there is currently no Metroid game in development for either the Wii U or the NX.  Real bummer."
Metroid,3a6i8w,thequirkyturkey,3,Wed Jun 17 17:07:24 2015 UTC,Let's not jump to conclusions. What he actually said was that there isn't a Metroid 'Prime' game in the works yet. There is still hope. Keep in mind that Retro's been pumping out high quality 2D sidescrollers for the last few years. It's possible they're working on Metroid 5.
Metroid,3a6i8w,mccabre1,3,Wed Jun 17 17:22:07 2015 UTC,"And this is the sort of thing they told us three years ago too. There isn't a Metroid game coming out now, and there probably won't be one on the NX in three years either. It's done. We had a good run, guys, but now I guess its time to move on. It's like Nintendo Power's end in 2012. We'll always have the good memories, but that's all they'll ever be. We might get some Metroid Nostalgia from the new smash bros games (if Sakurai allows any Metroid characters to take up all of his Kirby spots) but that's as far as things will ever go. We can't keep holding on to hope that Metroid will be revealed at every E3. That will just lead to more suffering. I say it's time we cut our losses. If a new Metroid is ever anounced within the next 20 years, then it will be a pleasant surprise."
Metroid,3a6i8w,twinfyre,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:21:37 2015 UTC,"That brings up another point, another thing I just can't wrap my head around when it comes to Nintendo's way of thinking.   I've heard it repeated ad nauseam that the Metroid games don't sell extremely well. So I can understand why they might not want to throw a ton of money behind this franchise. It's a gamble. It might not be profitable.   But if they're not going to do anything with the property, why not license it out? Let some other studio publish it. That way they get the reward (if any) but with none of the risk.   They could even go the crowd fund route, like Shenmue 3. Come out and say, ""Hey, we don't feel like there's a big enough demand for this game, so we're going to throw up a Kickstarter. If you want this game, prove us wrong.""   We could have a Metroid game in development by next month if Nintendo was open to either of those options. But neither of those things are going to happen."
Metroid,3a6i8w,thequirkyturkey,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:44:40 2015 UTC,"It's like Nintendo Power's end in 2012.   Well, there's always Nintendo Force. With no ads!"
Metroid,3a6i8w,TheSOB88,12,Thu Jun 18 21:21:31 2015 UTC,So that'd mean the earliest we'd see a proper Metroid game is...four years?  God.
Metroid,3a6i8w,Wind123,6,Wed Jun 17 17:21:11 2015 UTC,And that's only if they decided to start developing it in the next few months.
Metroid,3a6i8w,MrKenta,3,Wed Jun 17 19:04:45 2015 UTC,"That is if they started development soon. That said, this quote was specifically in reference to Metroid Prime. Keep in mind Retro has done a few side scrollers lately. They could be doing a Super style Metroid game."
Metroid,3a6i8w,Jammintk,3,Wed Jun 17 21:22:56 2015 UTC,"I'd be okay with waiting for the NX if it means I get another Metroid Prime.   The Wii U's current library is more than enough to keep me content for a while, even without a Metroid title.   I'm just not going to buy Federation Force on 3DS, as it looks like a shitty game.   You don't have to buy bad games just because they're a part of a favorite franchise.   Skip Federation Force, and move on."
Metroid,3a6i8w,Error400BadRequest,2,Wed Jun 17 18:08:20 2015 UTC,"The thing I found most interesting in what Tanabe stated in that particular interview that's being quoted was ""I haven't been able to collect a team or the resources to do it.""  The way that sounds is that he's been TRYING to get a team and resources together to make a new Metroid Prime, but just hasn't been able to. What that sounds like to me is that Nintendo doesn't want to fund another large Metroid project.  They're fine with a smaller budget Metroid Prime like Federation Force, but nothing that requires a larger budget like another HD Metroid Prime. They probably feel that -- from a financial stand-point -- it would be too much of a risk to do so."

Metroid,3a6i8w,gcook725,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:48:06 2015 UTC,"Well, keep in mind I did say that they aren't working (or going to be working) on a high-budget Metroid Prime game. Could be a traditional style Metroid game in the works.  Though, based on that ""Can you dig it?"" tweet from Retro, I doubt they're working on a Metroid game unless that pun can somehow apply to it. I've seen some speculation that its a new Drill Dozer, but who knows for sure."
Metroid,3a6i8w,Rootayable,2,Thu Jun 18 04:32:54 2015 UTC,"I really don't see why people want to have another Prime game.  Surely the Prime series has come to a comfortable and satisfying close?  A FPS Metroid, sure, but not Prime. Metroid Fusion 2, surely?"

So why don't they do that?"
Metroid,3a71xy,thequirkyturkey,3,Wed Jun 17 19:31:14 2015 UTC,Probably because they don't think it'd sell well in Japan.

Expect metroid related dlcs in other games and Samus cameos in some games (because that sells) and that will be it. We are not killing the franchise, Nintendo is"

As much as I love the 3DS and the Wii U, I would rather wait for something more powerful like the NX to deliver a marvelous adventure. My guess is that the Wii U is as popular as it's going to be. If Nintendo wanted to capitalize off of the true potential of MP4, they would wait until they could produce superior hardware. Recall that this isn't a first for Nintendo, considering that they turned down multiple offers to produce a Metroid game for N64. As a result, we got to experience a fine tuned Metroid Prime, and it is today considered one of the best games ever made."
Metroid,3a8bxm,SylvanHawk,2,Thu Jun 18 16:50:59 2015 UTC,"The people screaming the loudest identify themselves as the biggest fans of the franchise. I don't think Nintendo is stupid enough to see self-identified hardcore Metroid fans expressing displeasure and assume they don't want any Metroid games at all. The truly damning scenario would be no one giving a shit about the weird design choices and then sales being low due to apathy. If anything, this outrage is a sure sign that the Metroid fanbase is hungry and ready to open their wallets for a main story game."
Metroid,3a6bvd,pinelotiile,6,Wed Jun 17 15:58:49 2015 UTC,"I want this game to exist, but I want this game to give live to the Metroid series, I always wanted to know what federation marines actually do."

I hope not... When I read that quote it made me think there might be a single player campaign, and all they wanted to show off this E3 was mulitplayer stuff. Maybe they thought that was more exciting to show the average fan of shooters? Expect the worst, hope for the best :/"
Metroid,3aan2v,swornbrother1,8,Thu Jun 18 15:38:30 2015 UTC,"I think at the very least we should wait until the game, y'know, actually comes out before we decide it's the worst game ever and the death of the Metroid IP like so many are claiming."

I still plan on buying it, though, because I think it looks fun and want to support the franchise."
Metroid,3aan2v,synthieval,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:01:53 2015 UTC,"People keep making this argument. ""It looks fun, let's wait and see if it is before judging""  Very few people doubt that it will be fun! Personally, I'm sure it will be pretty entertaining. The issue is that it's been called a metroid game even though nothin about it short of shooting things has anything to do with metroid in the slightest.   The implications of this are as follows.  1. This could mean that we aren't getting a ""real"" metroid for a very long time if this was meant to be our installment for the next 5 years.    Nintendo could view the negativity and possible low sales numbers as an indication that nobody likes metroid instead of viewing as the desire for a real metroid and therefore put metroid on a hiatus indefinitely.  If the game sells well, that could mean that future metroid games may follow the examples set by FF (chibi, no exploration, multiplayer, etc).    Not to mention that people are bugged by the fact that they get a spinoff after 5 (or 8) years of waiting patiently for either a traditional side scrolling metroid or another 3d prime.   Overall, few people believe the game in and of itself will be ""un-fun"". If the game wasn't under the metroid brand, I'm sure nobody would blink twice about it. The issue stems from the fact that they're trying to pass it off as metroid."

I think if they weren't happy with the direction the series was being taken, they'd make a petition to create the next game in the series, alongside a spin-off.

That doesn't make sense. If it truly is detrimental to the integrity of the series, having another game made alongside it doesn't make it less so. I am all for the Metroid brand being taken off of the game and it being marketed as a new IP. The series has been serious through and through. Even MP Pinball stayed true to the tone and atmosphere of Prime."
Metroid,3a9wk3,SylvanHawk,5,Thu Jun 18 17:09:32 2015 UTC,"I know you're coming from a good place, but when you say that FF is going to ruin the franchise, and that Metroid Pinball didn't, I just can't take that statement seriously.   I don't want to seem like I'm defending Nintendo, because I'm not at all, but you see why people are laughing at the vocal Federation Force denouncers, right?  Edit: To actually address your point though, will FF ruin the integrity of the series when Metroid Pinball already exists? Isn't the purpose of FF to expand upon the other entities in the universe? Wouldn't that be a better fit than ""Pinball""?"
Metroid,3a9wk3,PhazonZim,0,Fri Jun 19 02:39:27 2015 UTC,"I didn't say FF would ruin the franchise at all. I just think it sets a precedent for future games with the same kind of art style and gameplay type which very few fans want from a Metroid game, all the while trying to be canon and ""expand on other entities,"" apparently. Prime pinball did not try to present a new story or bit of lore. It was simply a pinball game with a skin that was very true to Prime 1's atmosphere, and it was quite well made from what I remember of it. It was a diversion and a diversion only. No one would believe that Nintendo would now only make Metroid themed pinball games or arcade games. In the case of FF, though, it is attempting to truly add to the universe in a new style that fans are not particularly happy about. Do you think pinball ended up being a detriment to the franchise? Did you play it?"
Metroid,3a9wk3,PhazonZim,3,Fri Jun 19 03:39:20 2015 UTC,"Mate, it's called Metroid Prime Pinball. I don't have to play it to see that it ticks the same box that FF does.    It uses the ""Metroid Prime"" name, despite being different gameplay-wise.   One aims to expand, while the other exists solely for brand-recognition. A lot of people are arguing that FF exists for brand-recognition, and whether they're right or not, it's a bit hypocritical to say ""Prime Pinball is okay, and not going to send the series in a weird direction, but Federation Force probably is.""  Where is this coming from? If Pinball, Metroid 2, and Other M didn't send it down the wrong path, I honestly don't think anything can. The spin-off title, Federation Force, included."
Metroid,3a9wk3,Mortimer42,0,Fri Jun 19 04:12:02 2015 UTC,"Except Metroid Prime Pinball's design was directly based off of Prime 1. The enemies, level design, and ambiance perfectly mirrored Prime 1. That's why Prime was warranted in the title. I've already tried to explain why Pinball couldn't have sent the franchise on a weird path, while FF can. FF, by your own words, is meant to be canon and be an expansion of the prime series lore, not just a diversion. A stylistic change to a game that is meant to be canon is more influential to the franchise than a small, non-canon expanding diversion that holds true to the art style, if not the gameplay, of the series it is directly spun off of. If that doesn't make sense, I don't know what else to say. I honestly do not think FF ruins the franchise. I do think it opens the possibility for future spinoffs in the same art style, which I and many other fans would not like to see happen."
Metroid,3a9wk3,Crystalline3,2,Fri Jun 19 04:52:46 2015 UTC,"I think it comes down to the fact that, if it doesn't sell well, then Nintendo won't make anymore. If it does sell well, then angry Metroid fans are flip-floppers and don't know what they want. Clearly, if it sells well enough for a sequel, there's a demand.   People should never stop telling Nintendo what they want though.  I've said this elsewhere, but it'll be incredibly interesting to see how it all pans out."

C'mon, you should be able to see the obvious hypocrisy there. Saying we didn't drop hundreds of dollars so we have no right to complain? I've definitely paid a few hundred for all of the Metroid stuff I own, I've bought entire consoles to play Metroid games.   The online petition is dumb yeah, nearly all online petitions are dumb. But last I checked the petition had less signatures than the announcement trailer has Thumbs Down on youtube, so it's clearly a super minority signing it. On the internet even super minorities can look big.   Whining about how other people reacted to something because you didn't react as strongly is so asinine. There is a legitimate conversation to be had about gamer entitlement, and I admit I question how entitled I feel in this matter. But this video you made is contributing nothing of value to that conversation."
Metroid,3a9wk3,crisvok,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:31:54 2015 UTC,"Harsh, but fair.   The thing is, you've straw-manned my statement regarding Mass Effect 3 vs Federation Force. Mass Effect 3 was the tale of one story, spanning three games, accompanied by big promises. To get the full experience, you had to buy each individual game, and the DLC is arguable, but did deliver more story. Bioware were spewing the ""YOUR DECISIONS REALLY MATTER!"" spiel, and were lying.  So not only was this big investment required on your part, but you were lied to about the product.  In the case of Federation Force, I understand where Metroid fans are coming from. I love the 2D Metroids, so I definitely sympathize, but nobody was ever lied to. Nintendo never said ""We're announcing that game you want!"" and then proceeded to announce FF. We weren't lied to, we were let down by our own expectations, and good faith.  I'm definitely not siding with Nintendo here, I want to make that very clear, and I stated it in the video. However, the entitlement comes in the form of intent. Instead of people saying ""Well, I didn't get what I want, and I'm disappointed. Let's start a petition to get a proper Metroid Prime game, and leave the spin-off to anyone who wants it."" they chucked a fucking massive hissy fit, went on e-rampages, and started petitions to get the game cancelled.   They're not the majority, at least I'd like to think they aren't, but they're still taking this disappointment that people are feeling almost universally, and reacting poorly to it.   I've been following the conversation on reddit and other places to make sure I didn't have to make a video telling people how dumb they were, and while there was a LOT of level-headed criticism, and rational discussion, I still saw heavily-upvoted threads full of colossal morons.   I was actually going to cancel the video when I woke up, because I wrote the script at 2am (as you can tell), and then I saw my Twitter feed flooded with stupid rationalisations of bad behaviour, and became inspired again.  I'm not against anyone being angry, or disappointed, it's the ones who take stupid actions who this video is targeted at. By the sounds of your comment, and how you've taken the time to calmly write a reply, that's not you, and I don't think it's a majority of people.  That said, I still feel it was worth making.   I do appreciate the feedback though."

The difference between Zelda and Metroid is that Nintendo acknowledges Zelda much more often. While the last console adventure, dungeon crawling Zelda was Skyward Sword in 2011, they've had a steady stream of side game releases since, including Hyrule Warriors being announced alongside Zelda Wii U to help tide fans over. Meanwhile, this is Metroid's first appearance at E3 since 2009. I didn't sign the petition, and I'm going to give the game a chance simply because it's Metroid and I don't want it to die, but I'd be lying if I said this is what I wanted.

The equivalent for Metroid would be something that resembles a side scroller like the GBA games. MP:FF from what I can see, lacks the atmosphere and other mechanics that make a Metroid game.

The horribly cheesy cartoony graphics don't fit with the style, and the iconic gameplay the series got know for was booted in favor of a sports game.  The weird thing is that people have been wanting a solid 2D or 3D for years now. And this was the critical move, being the game to succeed Other M. They had but to release a regular old 2D game even and people would have loved it. And this is bizarre, because Nintendo is the king of platformers, and even created a new genre within it. The planets aligned for a perfect chance to mend the gap and they went with... Well FF.  And no, that is not ""whiny entitled shits"".

Cartoony images for a Zelda game? How dare you!  Fast forward a couple of years, they made a HD remake for the WiiU. And now it seems that most 'Zelda fans' are convinced that WWHD is the BEST Zelda game ever!  tldr; Give it a chance. While it may not be a 'core' Metroid game. Neither was Link's Crossbow Training.

Zelda has always been a very simple story, overhyped by fans. At the core it's about a hero setting out to rescue a princess with your magical sword against some evil guy. It's a very simple fairy tale and has many places it go from both visual and narrative. And people who always cry about Wind Waker it's art style need to understand that it worked so well because the story from the games was never too serious, and Wind Waker had the visuals to reflect that  Metroid on the other hand is on the opposing spectrum. It is a story about solitude, and exploring a twisted planet. If you cartoon it up you're going to end up with a bizarre mixture that goes nowhere."

Metroid,3a2eez,twinfyre,6,Tue Jun 16 21:23:14 2015 UTC,"""High Command"" from Metroid Prime is the same as ""the ringleaders"" from Other M and Metroid Fusion. You heard it here first."
Metroid,3a2eez,1upD,11,Wed Jun 17 02:48:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've gone way more in depth with the theory, but basically, the galactic federation and the space pirates have a lot in common. Way too much in common. Long theory incoming!   In prime 3 we have the aurora units, They seem like some sort of Galactic federation counterpart to mother brain. This early concept art makes them seem much more closely linked Both sides had phazon based armor with Hyper mode in prime 3 Both sides have an interest in the Metroids. In Super Metroid, the space pirates invaded and stole the baby Metroid immediately after Samus left the space station. Almost as if the Space Pirates knew she was coming.  In later games in the Metroid timeline, the galactic federation spends a lot of time creating bioweapons. For some reason, they seem obsessed with cloning the space pirates, Metroids, and Ridley. (in other m, ridley's cloning was aparently an accident. But why did they bother to take his dead body to the BSL station for fusion?)   The thing that sets the galactic federation apart from the space pirates is what I believe to be the very justification for the space pirate's existence in the first place. The Galactic Federation is run almost exclusively by humans. At no point in the main series games are we ever shown anyone other than a human working in the GF. The Manga shows that there are definitely some non-humans in the Federation, but it also shows that a lot of the higher ups are xenophobic and very rarely let other races in. Which is really strange, because the manual from Metroid 1 says that the federation was made when other races decided to form one big government. But where are the other races?  Here's my conclusion. The Galactic Federation is made mostly of humans. Somehow, humanity managed to get on top of the chain of command. But them being very xenophobic caused a lot of nations to rebel. Think of it like Star Wars but with more moral ambiguity. So how does the galactic federation solve this problem? They create an enemy greater than the rebellion. Something so unambiguously evil that it would unite everyone under the galactic federation's rule. The Space Pirates. But how do they fight this new enemy without an army? They can't allow ""aliens"" into their ranks, they might try to reach the top. So what do they do? Enter the bounty hunter system. The federation employs bounty hunters to fight the space pirates. and the space pirates keep the nations united in fear.   The thing that really fits this whole theory together for me is Samus. Think about this. When she was a child, the space colony she lived on was attacked by the Space Pirates. Ridley himself killed both of her parents right in front of her, and then let her live. This whole thing happened right after the chozo, a formerly warfaring race, left the colony. The Chozo heard the distress signal and came back to pick up the newly orphaned Samus. They then raised her and gave her a planet busting suit that they would normally never use (due to their views on war). Pretty convenient right?   I could keep going with this too. I haven't even touched on Ridley's apparent immortality, or the other connections between the games. One of these days I need to write this whole thing down. Given the direction the Metroid franchise has been going, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch for them to go in this direction."

Metroid,3a2eez,Mosec,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:01:36 2015 UTC,"But... Mother Brain was created by the Chozo, and she defected to the Space Pirates. The Federation was more likely inspired by the design, and probably had some help from the Chozo before they ""disappeared.""  Ridley, simlar to every Metroid in Super Metroid (save for the radiation mutated baby), has been cloned. It's basically how Space Pirates breed metroids, I don't see why they wouldn't do it to immortalize their leader.  Also, I don't think the Chozo even left by the time the Space Pirates attacked and orphaned Samus. Having made friends with a Chozo, and now parentless, he decided to effectively adopt her. Very situational. If she hadn't made friends with him, she'd probably have just been an unfortunate PTSD afflicted human.  The only thing going on here is that Mother Brain incited a full war between the Federation and the Space Pirates. It's not a Federation conspiracy. :P  Also this link justifies Mother Brain's actions given that a major part of her entire existence is to mind control Metroids (also designed by the Chozo) to feed on the X Parasites. The X Parasites being significantly more terrifying than Metroids."
Metroid,3a2eez,memnoc,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:41:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah... the theory is a bit of a work in progress. I haven't really gone so far as to research it completely. All I've got is the games I've played, and the countless hours I've spent reading through the manga and wikitroid (which probably burned a lot of the information into my brain).   One of these days I'd like to sit down and string this all together. maybe make an imgur album about it or something. Despite some of the holes, I do think that the games will reach this point eventually. It just seems so obvious to me when the timeline is all layed out."
Metroid,3a2eez,twinfyre,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:00:13 2015 UTC,"This idea of the Galactic Federation... Controlling the Space Pirates reminds me of [Spoilers] Jurassic Wold, a complicated way to control the antagonist to create bioweapons/super soldiers that's amazing.[End Spoilers]  I love theories like this. Seems interesting, though I'm sure that Samus would pick up on the Federation's work if we consider Other M canon. (As she's seen working with the Federation in Fusion, remember.)"
Metroid,3a2eez,Zero-Striker,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:25:05 2015 UTC,"Possibly. What I think they have is a bunch of excuses to give to anybody who questions things. Like the higher ups definitely are in on this whole ""manufacturing the space pirate threat"" thing. But to lower people, it seems like they're just copying the pirate technology. And to Samus, it just seems like they're creating bioweapons.  My idea of a perfect sequel to fusion would probably involve more conspiracy than anything. Maybe Samus is imprisoned by the galactic federation (after a fleet of ships takes her down) and the game is about her breaking out, recovering her powers, avoiding the guards, and slowly unravelling all of the secrets of the galactic federation. Maybe Sylux could show up from time to time to give Samus cryptic advice on where to go next. Maybe he could work like Protoman from Megaman? It could have the Metroidvania style in the story, but it could also focus on logbook scans, and failed experiments ( you know, classic metroid). Maybe at one point in the game, Samus could open up a portal that would lead her to the Space Pirate base or something? Just to keep environments varied.   Now this next part is just wishful thinking on my part, so if it makes no sense in overall canon, or just sounds really stupid, go easy on me.   The game could end with Samus reaching a large door. At this point all of the data she's collected so far has been confusing and cryptic. She opens the door and it's just this massive room filled with tanks. each tank has the hibernating body of a Ridley floating inside it. We then hear the booming voice of Ridley himself. He reveals that he was never one entity at all. The consciousness of Ridley just jumps from one body to another every time he is destroyed. His real ""mind"" is actually nowhere near the room. This is just one of many different stations where replacement Ridley's are created. Ridley then delivers a breaking speech to Samus that reveals the entire Bounty hunter conspiracy. The space pirates, the federation, the whole thing. Samus drops to her knees in despair as Ridley begins a fight that Samus will never be able to win. And then...  That's all I've got. I'll admit, I just want to see what would happen if Metroid just went full on ""Cosmic Horror Story"". Which is why I wrote out this short ""new game fanfiction"". Obviously, a game with this plot would never be able to appease the entire fanbase, and I've probably angered quite a few people just by writing it. Still it's a fun thing to think about every now and then. Maybe I should write a short story about this along with that other theory some time. Metroid Speculation has always fascinated me. There's just so many parts of the game world that we don't know a lot about."

And we recently learned that it will have both single player and co-op story, so we are definitely buying it. I like how it is so far, and their is always room for improvement. I hope the rest of the Metroid community rethinks their opinions because this game is gonna be good."
Metroid,3a7503,scg06,2,Wed Jun 17 21:08:15 2015 UTC,"I think that the issue people are having with the game (and this is my opinion too) is that it's not a metroid prime game. Sticking the name on it doesn't make it so. If the developers wanted to make a spin-off game set in the metroid universe then that's great news, but don't call it ""metroid prime"" just to shift copies. Call it something different so that people know it's a spin off and not the next game in the 'prime' series.  It feels like they are watering down one of my all time favourite franchises. Of course I'm going to reserve judgement until I see more gameplay, but so far I haven't seen anything that remotely resembles a metroid prime game. It's certainly not a sequel and it doesn't have anything to do with the prime story so why market it as such?"
Metroid,3a7503,Rootayable,0,Wed Jun 17 21:55:15 2015 UTC,"Well in one review the author states it didn't look like a Metroid Prime game until he actually played it. In a interview a developer says that we eventually will see Samus, so she's there."

Would be able to say the same about a bad Metroid game that did feature Samus as the protagonist like Other M? I think Nintendo wants to test Next Level Games with Federation Force before letting them use Samus as a central role in a game as to not diminish her value as a character."

Metroid,3a4dt4,flamingviper3175,13,Wed Jun 17 04:13:43 2015 UTC,You know what you're right. This game is pretty much essential for Prime 4 to happen by expanding the lore. Though it doesn't sound like they've even started Prime 4 yet which is very concerning.
Metroid,3a4dt4,flamingviper3175,2,Wed Jun 17 04:21:15 2015 UTC,"Nintendo has a history of denying and even falsifying information regarding new games.

This actually brings up an interesting plotline though. Right now the federation seems to be leaning more toward the ""evil"" end of the spectrum. Sylux stole federation tech and is using it to hunt Samus, GF's most valuable bounty hunter. What if Sylux is trying to destroy the galactic federation and is using contemptible means to do so?

If nintendo wanted to make a shitty title about metroid, they'd just have gone the way of the NintendoLand minigames. Shitty, not really universe specific. Or used the ones from Other M.   Why bring back prime? Then I remembered the Retro hiring notices, the engineer requests and the title they were working on. It just makes sense!

Metroid,3a2ndk,thequirkyturkey,10,Tue Jun 16 20:54:12 2015 UTC,"Well it seems that Nintendo generally releases past games or does a sale on the VC to coincide with new games. It introduces new generations to exactly what it is that makes the franchise so great and builds hype for everyone else. Trying to build hype for a new Metroid with something like this only has me worried for any new title if this is how they plan to treat the franchise.  In the US the VC already have Metroid (NES), Metroid II on the 3DS, Super Metroid, the Prime Trilogy, Metroid Fusion, and I believe EU has Zero Mission.  And what about the Nintendo Party mini game? And doesn't Smash Bros still serve as a huge franchise advert too?  I'm not arguing with you, your likely right. I also think Nintendo's putting all it's money towards other major projects and they feel the need to add filler in their gaps between major titles."
Metroid,3a2ndk,DaPurpleHippo,8,Tue Jun 16 21:11:28 2015 UTC,"The way I saw it was that the metroid game retro is working on isn't ready for an announcement/trailer yet, so to let fans of the franchise know that they still care, they made a smaller spin-off game to tide them over.  The issue is that there is no confirmation that a main-series metroid game is in the works, so it looks like the spin-off game is what the franchise has been reduced to."

Metroid,3a2ndk,MindOverManter,14,Wed Jun 17 17:04:47 2015 UTC,I can understand this. Just I don't unserstand why it has to be so alien from the entire series. Even Pinball still LOOKED like Metroid. This new game has nothing at all to do with the series outside of the name
Metroid,3a2ndk,kupovi,10,Tue Jun 16 20:38:04 2015 UTC,"This new game has nothing at all to do with the series outside of the name   Heck, I don't care that it's going in a different direction even. But the quality of the graphics shown was just.... bad. Like, bad for the original DS bad, but 10 years later and still that bad?"
Metroid,3a2ndk,th3shark,3,Wed Jun 17 00:05:13 2015 UTC,Keep in mind it's still in development and likely won't show up until early next year. There's enough time to improve the graphics.  Also don't most 3DS games look pretty bad graphically when shown on a bigger screen?
Metroid,3a2ndk,Brutalious,9,Wed Jun 17 16:34:10 2015 UTC,"The Troopers do bear a similarity, as does the universe.  This is probably because a smaller studio is developing this game with different designers and artists, and because to bring in a broader audience, often an aesthetic shift is required. Splatoon would not have been a hit on Wii U if it had been, for example, realistic.  This does not mean they will do this with our hypothetical Wii U title"
Metroid,3a2ndk,Jammintk,12,Tue Jun 16 20:53:38 2015 UTC,Splatoon however did not have a rich universe or backstory to pull from. It's a really successful new IP
Metroid,3a2ndk,kupovi,3,Wed Jun 17 00:58:17 2015 UTC,The gameplay looked almost exactly like Prime.  The enemies looked like they were pulled from MP as well. Don't act like its totally foreign.
Metroid,3a2ndk,dailyapple,7,Wed Jun 17 07:05:59 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but I'm having a hard time believing more people are happy about this game than those that are disappointed.  I don't know anything about marketing or publicity, but it seems to me that it would be better for Nintendo if the game just kept the title ""Blastball"" or whatever with no mention of ""Metroid"".  That said, if you're a developer, you might have noticed that the @jobsatnintendo twitter page announced many openings for graphics artists and programmers at Retro a few months back.  They're clearly working on something, and that's the shred of hope I hang onto."
Metroid,3a2ndk,Flare-Vortex,31,Tue Jun 16 23:39:39 2015 UTC,"Still doesn't excuse the way they did it, on perhaps gaming's biggest stage. They fucked up and upset a lot of people."
Metroid,3a2ndk,Kionea,22,Tue Jun 16 19:34:38 2015 UTC,"It doesn't work so well for us hardcore fans of the franchise... but look at it this way. From a dev's standpoint, or an executive standpoint, you WANT to make your audience happy. Unless your ego is too big and you lose track.  As I see it, all the Nintendo fans in my facebook and twitter feeds are going kinda nuts about ""that new shooter"". They are head over heels with splatoon, and they're gonna jump right into a co-op shooter.   The fanbase is very divided right now. So instead of making a new game and letting it be judged, they're gonna appeal to mass hype to make their product hit an audience. It leaves us fans a little angry, but remember they're just being smart about what they say and what they shut up about.  These are all just theories, and are all what I'd do, or my bosses would do if they were in charge of that franchise and making a proper revival of it.   Delay an announcement and make an inbetween product so Metroid reaches a broader audience without sacrificing the game itself or letting it be compared so much to it's awful predecessor. It would be very effective."
Metroid,3a2ndk,thedoommerchant,17,Tue Jun 16 19:40:59 2015 UTC,"I still think they could have gone in another direction with this to make it less of a stinging blow. The logos for FF/BB are really ""kid friendly"" and look very similar to the Skylanders logo. If they moved to a slightly more mature art style and away from the super deformed GF troopers, they could have made a co-op shooter that looked fun on its own. With the current (admittedly in-development) footage released so far, it looks very simplistic and reductive, and doesn't feel like it is a part of the Metroid universe. None of the enemies or even the troopers themselves were recognizably Metroid."
Metroid,3a2ndk,AnonymousXD2,3,Tue Jun 16 21:26:52 2015 UTC,"Oh boo-hoo. Think about the long-game.  They aren't there to satisfy every single urge a gamer has. They are there to create a successful product and game.  If it takes them time to make Metroid correctly, then so be it. - If it takes a few months for the right time to announce and market the game, then so be it.  Just because its E3 doesn't mean every single announcement has to be present.  Nintendo will do it when they feel its right; and it will rock our socks."
Metroid,3a2ndk,Orphanblood,2,Wed Jun 17 06:32:29 2015 UTC,"Or they just won't do it, like with Metroid Dread. Let's not pretend we're going off of anything more than rumors and assumptions that a real metroid game is even in development at all."
Metroid,3a2ndk,nutella4eva,5,Wed Jun 17 15:04:53 2015 UTC,"Personally, the only hate I can get is that it's only Metroid by name. And that's fine. The said they wanted to expand the Metroid Prime universe since 2013, so to me this wasn't bad news. Heck, I even suspected Blast Ball being a Metroid game since the Nintendo World Championships. Hell, even if it was simply ""Metroid: Federation Force"", I'd be fine with it because I don't think that every first-person Metroid game has to have Prime in the title.  Now, was I left with a bad taste? Yes, but because it's simply a Metroid game with just the title Metroid. But will that sway me from getting it? I think it looks fun, and I wanna get it. Hell, I liked Blast Ball at the World Championships. Hell, maybe that's why Nintendo introduced it as Blast Ball: For people to have a first impression and be like ""Hey this looks really fun. I wanna get it!"" to give them a good impression on it firsthand, and when they revealed it as a new Metroid, people would be even more stoked about it, as opposed to having their fans think ""wtf this looks nothing like Metroid Prime""."
Metroid,3a2ndk,Alfrottos,3,Wed Jun 17 01:29:48 2015 UTC,"I came to this same conclusion almost immediately after the WTF left my face. There's no way they'd just shit all over it like this. Make a small game, get Metroid back on everyones mind, then when it's nearing completion announce the big project.  Granted, if that is their plan it was executed badly, but if it ends with the announcement of Metroid Prime 4 I can forgive the poor planning."
Metroid,3a2ndk,Viper596,3,Wed Jun 17 01:40:25 2015 UTC,"Yep, this makes sense. And it goes along with my thoughts of Nintendo beginning to phase out Wii U support and reveal NX for a launch in Holiday 2016. We will see the true Metroid Prime sequel next summer, folks. Hopefully it will be worth the wait running on a console with specs that are on par or greater than the Xbone or PS4. THAT would be worth these torturous years of waiting. I could only imagine how gorgeous it'd look..."
Metroid,3a2ndk,AuraRyu,3,Tue Jun 16 23:23:40 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping this is the case, because the game in and of itself does not look bad at all. I watched the Treehouse segment for the game and honestly, while I think the rage over the fact that this is what we've had to wait on for quite a few year is fair enough, bashing on the game isn't. Its graphics don't look stellar, but from what I could see the gameplay is good and could even get quite chaotic.   I'm really hoping your theory is correct so we can look back on this and laugh at today, but if I have learned any lesson from today's Digital Event is that I should never get too hopeful :("
Metroid,3a2ndk,AuraRyu,3,Wed Jun 17 02:13:27 2015 UTC,"Naw, if we saw an actual Metroid people would of collectively lost their shit like The Last Guardian reveal."

Metroid,3a2ndk,Maniafest,5,Tue Jun 16 19:21:58 2015 UTC,"The Wikipedia page for the studio confirms it. Also, they've been hiring recently, an engineer, too. So that pretty much confirms it. New game, high technical specs."

People have said that it's just to find out whether there's interest in the franchise anymore, but as a BoF game it'll fall flat on its face. I'm kinda in the middle with this one though. I keep my opinion to myself until I played it because after having tested it I can still hate it to death, like Other M."
Metroid,3a2ndk,DuelistDeCoolest,0,Tue Jun 16 23:07:19 2015 UTC,"I think a Prime sequel will be very acclaimed, even more so after another shooter became really successful.  Federation Force looks like it has very interesting gameplay to offer."
Metroid,3a2ndk,TheBenjay,3,Tue Jun 16 23:22:23 2015 UTC,"This ISN'T the game Retro's working on after all. Also, Nintendo's not really known for keeping ALL the bombs for E3."

Metroid,3a2ndk,theweirdbrosinc,2,Wed Jun 17 01:55:22 2015 UTC,Wait how do you know Retro is making a WiiU game? I really wanna believe
Metroid,3a2ndk,supersmashdude,2,Wed Jun 17 05:52:43 2015 UTC,It looks more like the whole game world is something right out of the skylanders universe. The metroid universe has always been Nintendo's main realistic franchise in terms of art style. This is just pushing it off a cliff while being trapped in a bus.   Also the concept of blast ball in and of itself is really weak. It's doubtful this game will feature any real death match style multiplayer. Anything like the Prime 2 multiplayer would be better than this blast ball rubbish.
Metroid,3a2ndk,GoldenBoy25,2,Wed Jun 17 11:10:08 2015 UTC,"That's what Prime Trilogy was for on Wii U, it was even going for ridiculously cheap the first week."

Metroid,3a2ndk,Jammintk,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:42:59 2015 UTC,"What's interesting is that it's branded Metroid Prime rather than just Metroid, so if your theory holds true they want to remind people that the Metroid Prime brand specifically is returning. This also helps to direct attention away from Other M and its relatively poor reception by reminding audiences of the much more acclaimed Prime titles."
Metroid,3a2ndk,cephalopodAscendant,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:30:31 2015 UTC,"Retro Studios is developing........ Raven Blade....... sorry I don't know why I took things to that kind of level.   But onto your point I'd have to some what disagree with your new fans to the series approach. From an art style perspective it is clearly targeting a younger audience. The style is very reminiscent of games such as the lego games series, Skylanders or Marvel Super squad. Metroid has always being a series that generally finds itself in the T area when it comes to content.   If this game is supposedly an entry point for people to join the series it is so out of touch with what has come before that I don't think people would be able to expect the same kind of experience. Hopefully this game isn't a preview of things to come because I really do love my Metroid.     You can reintroduce a dormant franchise in a way that can still appeal to fans and newcomers alike. Killer Instinct and South Park Stick of Truth are some titles that come to mind. This title is just so distance in terms of presentation to what the Metroid Prime universe has been that fans are like wut? From my perspective this is Nintendo trying to get Metroid to appeal to a younger audience, and I'm currently not too sure what to think of that. I guess they could also be looking to create a subuniverse for Metroid similar to how in comics we have multiple realities and versions of the same character / universe.    If the above is filled with mistakes and doesn't make much sense I'm really tired and found it hard to formulate good discourse."
Metroid,3a2ndk,MunkyUTK,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:04:59 2015 UTC,"If this is the way they want to re-introduce Metroid then I'm not sure it's a Metroid I'll be interested in playing. They alienated most of the hardcore Metroid fans and that is exactly the opposite of a good move because they're the only ones keeping this series alive. This kind of shift isn't going to draw in enough of the ""general audience"" to make shitting on the longtime fans (who are the only fans at this point) worth it.   I have hope for a reveal next year for a proper Metroid, but it's very, very cautious hope."
Metroid,3a2ndk,MisterWoodhouse,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:54:44 2015 UTC,"No matter what, it is still a dumb apporch.  I understand,  develop a new game for a new audience to introduce them into the franchise, but then let the true fans know the franchise is still alive and that this, whatever you would like to call it, isn't it. I would have been more then ok if they did Federation Forces first then said ""To go along with this, retro has another announcement involving Metroid."" I think everyone would have been fine with that and understand that Federation Forces isn't the last we see of the series for a while. I'm not even asking gameplay just something saying it is being worked on. However, if what you say is right and Retro is working on a new Prime game and not something else, then they have to announce it and soon!"
Metroid,3a2ndk,Dubiono,5,Tue Jun 16 21:16:59 2015 UTC,"Then everybody will be talking about that game, and Federation Force will never serve a purpose. The next hypothetical metroid will take the exact same development time, announcement or not.  Think this as: Once in a company the engineers were asked to increase the elevator speed because the waiting time was too high and people were complaining. They couldn't possibly do this, so to solve the problem they installed a mirror next to the elevator. Nobody ever complained again because they were busy looking at themselves while the elevator traveled.  If they announce what they're working on, an inbetween title is pointless. Especially since I think they're trying to make this new game accomplish something. My best guess is either make Prime more popular in Japan or  make Splatoon fans become Metroid fans. Announcing a bigger, badder Metroid just takes away any possible hype.  This was done with Zelda. Talking about the other Zelda takes away the focus from this one. So they said beforehand they weren't going to talk about it, so their other title had more ""room"" so to speak. Nobody openly knows anything about a metroid game, so no similar announcement had to be made."
Metroid,3a2ndk,MisterWoodhouse,3,Tue Jun 16 21:25:26 2015 UTC,"I understand,  but with Zelda we atleast know for a fact a Wii U one is coming, so this one will tie us over. We know that for a fact this 3DS  Zelda title is not going to be it for a while. They could have done the same with Metroid. I see your point, but it isn't like proper Metroid would get released soon. In fact, the announcement of a new Metroid would have most likely boosted the sales of Federation Forces. They could have said ""Metroid for Wii U/3DS is a long time off but untill then enjoy this spinoff title."" That would have actually got me more interested in Federation Forces. Also, unlike Zelda, Metroid hasn't been on a 5 (or 8 to some) hiatus.  Announcing a new Metroid and then on top of the saying there will be a spin off to hold us over for a while would have done much better then what they did.  Edit: forgot a word"
Metroid,3a2ndk,Dubiono,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:41:48 2015 UTC,"I know. This course of action was indeed viable, but I think their decision lies more on their internal affairs and the fact that they're dealing with an extremely pissed off fanbase.  Zelda's audience is pretty much unified, so you can throw everything at them without fear.  Announcing a Prime game, especially if it's incomplete (if it's this game we're hypothesizing, it's had only about  5 months of dev time. It must've only just hit alpha.)   My guess is that they deliberately don't want people to know about this other title. Maybe because of controversy, shitty interviews regarding Other M, etc. Keep the bad press off until you have something awesome to show, not something that's barely more than a prototype.   People would start to ask, and imagine if the release date is in 3 years? That's very reasonable for a game this size, and hype should not be built up that long. Creates expectations, especially in this big of a return. People will also judge this raw, unfinished product as the final thing.  Look at The Last Guardian. Can you imagine what would have happened if what they showed had not been good? If it had had technical flaws? There's a similar expectation for a Prime title. Why not soften the wait for America while trying to get Japan to play it?"
Metroid,3a2ndk,MisterWoodhouse,3,Tue Jun 16 21:51:43 2015 UTC,"Hell, Nintendo hasn't been afraid in the past to say ""here's and announcement"" then show a 3 second CG clip, then say ""this is an unnamed (series) project that we will be talking more about next year"" then release it two years down the line. I like their new direction where very few games are shown at multiple E3s and are often less than a year away from release when they are first announced, but for Metroid right now, they need Retro to come out with some concept art or a logo or SOMETHING that shows that they have something coming down the pipe, even if it is a couple years out."
Metroid,3a2ndk,Dubiono,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:32:47 2015 UTC,No it isn't. Instead of putting effort into making a quality product. You would instead do so little with the amount of potential the series has? Screw off with that crap. It's not a smart move when it's so different from the rest of the series (and not to mention a crap game as well).   I'd also like to see proof that you're a developer.
Metroid,3a2ndk,TotesMessenger,-4,Wed Jun 17 16:32:10 2015 UTC,"At this point, I don't see why Nintendo would bother with a Wii U release. Modern Metroid at it's best will sell 2 million units. Considering how cutting edge the Prime games were by the standards of the day, I have no doubt that a Wii U Metroid would be terribly expensive, and for Nintendo to have it shelved to a dying system's audience sounds like it would be them shooting themselves in the foot. Especially with NX news next year."
Metroid,3a2ndk,el_profe,2,Tue Jun 16 20:05:47 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding? Nintendo's overall strategy was to first fix the Wii U, and now it seems they are trying to please their fanbase. Look at zelda: the main title was not spoken of, but an in between game was announced, for the ones who played a link between worlds. I doubt they would not do the same with metroid: Hush up the main title, release something little in between.  Nintendo has money to spare, and a hit like prime will not only make tons of cash, but also bring competition to sci fi and shooter titles. There's Destiny, Mass Effect, etc. to tackle. If not that, to make their fans stay ""loyal"" to the console by providing that experience within their games.   The Wii U is all but dying, my friend. It might have had a rough beginning, but it's now profiting, quite a lot too.  EDIT: Also, it ocurred to me that other companies are doing the same. The FF7 remake, The Last Guardian... They're all focusing on building on their IPs. It's just not profitable to let one with such potential as shown by the Prime Games go to waste."
Metroid,3a2ndk,tonicodrea,6,Tue Jun 16 20:58:16 2015 UTC,"While I agree that the Wii U had built a lot of momentum over the last few years, the mindset that the Wii U is dying out has already set in. I think it is unlikely that Nintendo will keep pushing the Wii U so hard in a couple years. The real solution is to probably keep developing wii U games, then make the NX backwards compatible and say ""look at this huge library of good shot no one has played because the wii u didn't sell very well!"""

People are focusing on the football thing because it's so friggen ridiculous to have something like that in a Metroid game. If this had released alongside a new stand alone Metroid game, it would be different. But it's been 8 years since we got a good Metroid game, so this feels like a total slap in the face.   Imagine your waiting for someone you love on a corner, you haven't seen them for 8 years and you've just been waiting, hoping they come walking down the street, when suddenly someone rounds the corner who says to you ""my love!""

As I already said, if this game had launched alongside A actual Metroid title, it would be different. However after waiting 8 years, we are given this? It sucks, and people are rightfully upset. Do I think the game itself will be bad? No, but I don't want it, and I especially don't want it labeled as a Metroid game when we haven't had a good one in some time."

Metroid,3a3gmm,dan0314,33,Wed Jun 17 13:02:46 2015 UTC,"Well that further confirms Nintendo is run by a bunch of morons. Yes we wanted a new Metroid and we wanted more Nintendo games with mutliplayer but not like this. We also didn't say we wanted Samus gone. We love Samus. She's Nintendo's only lead female character. She's an icon and removing her from Metroid is an insult.   I know Nintendo really only cares about their Japanese audience but this is just depressing. Other M was an attempt to get the Japanese audience back into Metroid but when that failed and alienated both audiences, they just said ""oh well, guess nobody likes Metroid"". Just because Japan doesn't want it, that doesn't mean the rest of us don't."

It was a huge mistake for Nintendo to even mention they're working on a new system, because people overreact and think the Wii U is dead. I mean, do we even know if it's going to be a home console? It could be a new handheld, since New 3DS isn't really the ""next gen"" handheld.  So no, Wii U is nowhere near the end of its life cycle, especially since Zelda is coming out next year"
Metroid,3a2454,neoslith,2,Wed Jun 17 04:49:24 2015 UTC,"And we don't know what it is other than a gaming platform. Due to its age, it'd be more likely to replace the 3DS."
Metroid,3a2454,ILoveCresps,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:49:37 2015 UTC,Why would they replace the 3DS? They JUST came out with the New 3DS systems this year. And I'm also fairly certain it's been said that the gaming platform they were working on was a new system to replace the WiiU
Metroid,3a2454,notjustinbailey,2,Wed Jun 17 02:54:37 2015 UTC,"Remember the DSi? That's what I see happening to the N3DS XL.  3DS has been out for four years already, and the average handheld lifespawn is about five to six years. It makes more sense, and working with DeNA who specialize in mobile games, to make a new handled platform.    This is pure speculation on my part, but the name NX = Nintendo Xing (Crossing). Being able to play your games across any platform on just one device.  Honestly we won't know anything until Nintendo tells us."
Metroid,3a2454,ILoveCresps,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:59:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I don't think there will BE a new handheld console at all.  To me, the fact Nintendo has stated they are going to make efforts to release games on mobile tells me they realize how risky a handheld system is in the current market. Most people I know with a 3DS barely ever play it, and if they do they're playing Pokemon. Pokemon is the only reason I can see them continuing with a handheld console.  BUT, as someone else mentioned maybe it is a third pillar and will combine the systems in a way?  We really don't know but my bet is probably on the new home console. The WiiU is a sinking ship and Nintendo wants to jump."
Metroid,3a2454,notjustinbailey,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:16:19 2015 UTC,"They said it would be a sort of ""third pillar"" in that both systems will still have games being made for them but there will be another console there too.

People have been waiting a long time for a new Metroid, and what we got was a spinoff that doesn't look like Metroid, play like Metroid, or feel like Metroid.

I mean, I'm really disappointed in this, not what I wanted at all, but it probably isn't even a bad game, but it isn't going to get a fair shot because people are so put off by it being called Metroid, which I think was a huge mistake. That aside, Next Level probably put a lot of heart into it, I'm sure it will turn out better than what we saw today, and it makes me really sad that they won't get any credit for the work that they did. I wanted a new Metroid more than anyone, I'm crushed, but the internet forgets that real people work on these games, and they are probably really proud of it, until people shit all over it just because it was given the wrong name."
Metroid,3a3zj1,XsimonbelmontX,16,Wed Jun 17 03:04:05 2015 UTC,The real tragedy is that I'm sure Nintendo will learn nothing from this mess and possibly throw Metroid under a bus for the next several years.   Just like how they shot down NLG's old idea for a Metroid game which was a 2.5D adventure game because of the criticism from Other M.
Metroid,3a3zj1,XsimonbelmontX,7,Wed Jun 17 03:07:28 2015 UTC,"It's like they only hear the negative feedback. Had they ignored the Other M criticism, we could have had another great game a long time ago. I understand some of the complaints about Other M, for what they did to the story and Samus as a character, but considering gameplay alone, it was actually a really solid game. A little light on exploration, but it took the action of Metroid to a new place, which could have been improved on in a later game, but now it's probably permanently fucked because people had to be shitheads and make it out to be the worst game ever made."
Metroid,3a3zj1,xwatchmanx,9,Wed Jun 17 03:13:59 2015 UTC,"I mean, it still was a horrible game. It's just that Nintendo wasn't really listening to what people were actually angry about.   If Nintendo actually paid attention they would have noticed that people were ok with the gameplay of Other M, and were fine to try it again under better circumstances.   But nope, they have to take everything down with the ship."
Metroid,3a3zj1,XsimonbelmontX,3,Wed Jun 17 03:17:30 2015 UTC,"This is more or less how I feel about it, except I don't mind it being a Metroid game. As a spinoff, it looks cool, and I'll definitely buy it and hopefully enjoy it. But this is NOT the game to bring the series out of five (six when it releases) years of dormancy.  Take a look at Hyrule Warriors, as an example. It's a spinoff that plays nothing like Zelda, but Zelda has always had a steady stream of games, so it's fine. But if Hyrule Warriors was the only Zelda game released after half a decade with no other announced game in sight, people would be angry. It's like when they announced The Bureau: XCOM Declassified. People didn't want a spinoff after all these years, they wanted fucking XCOM. So the developer wised up and developed a ""true"" XCOM game as well."
Metroid,3a3zj1,TheFullMonty1394,2,Wed Jun 17 11:24:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I would be totally fine with this if there was a real Metroid game out too. Which was why when I saw this at first I got excited because the series was back, and there was no way this was the only game. I immediately thought of Hyrule Warriors. Some people were annoyed by that when it was announced, but because a full Zelda was on the way too, generally everyone was ok. HW ended up far surpassing everyone's expectations and being a great game, and MPFF might do the same for all we know, but it still isn't what we love about the series, as HW isn't what we love about Zelda, but the difference is, with Zelda, we don't only have a spinoff to look forward to for who knows how long.   All they had to do was say they are making one. It doesn't have to be a trailer. They could show a black screen, play a little piece of the Metroid title theme, and flash the S logo for a half a second, no date, no platform, nothing, and I would have lost my mind with excitement. Even if it doesn't come until NX, they don't need to go into detail yet, just acknowledge that at some point in the next year or two, we will be talking about a new legit Metroid title."
Metroid,3a3zj1,Model_Omega,8,Wed Jun 17 16:50:47 2015 UTC,"It isn't necessarily the game, it is the presentation. 20 seconds of vague alpha footage and no other details? That's what made us mad. And for fucks sake, just to make us happy, all they had to do was insert 10 SECONDS of a Shadowed a Metroid with pulsating lights accenting the veins and vaguely shadowing the rest of the creature on screen with ""Wii U 201_""beneath it and they would have won E3. Even if it was a lie, it still would have blown everything out of the water from their event and possibly overshadowed some of the other games.  All in all, the studio is working hard on this, and I feel for them. Hopefully they use the backlash in a positive way!"

Lots of folks, myself included, have been watching EA for the last several years and noticing a trend of not so great decisions and shady business practices. It's hard for us to hear somebody talk about EA like they're not the Umbrella Corporation. :)"
Metroid,3a3zj1,Atillia,2,Wed Jun 17 15:20:47 2015 UTC,"Haha true. The most recent example of good deeds by EA is EA Access. Easily one of the best deals in gaming right now, with it only to improve."

Metroid,3a3zj1,Kirbizard,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:39:18 2015 UTC,It does kind of suck for them - I'm sure the game is mechanically sound and fun to play for what it is. They just got kind of screwed over by Nintendo slapping Metroid Prime onto the title - instant hate.
Metroid,3a3zj1,Throw-Me-Again,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:37:44 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of the games they've made, I really think they did Luigi's Mansion massive justice and managed to make the multiplayer mode of that game actually manage to fit the theme of the game super well.  But man, this whole Metroid thing is making me feel really sad for everybody involved, both fans and developers."
Metroid,3a3zj1,vegemonster,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:43:13 2015 UTC,At the same time I feel bad for the devs who were told they were working on a new Metroid game and got stuck with this. I'm sure there's disappointment on a lot of fronts. Probably a bit of a down day at NLG right now.
Metroid,3a3zj1,SupervaleSunnyvisor,2,Wed Jun 17 18:48:23 2015 UTC,I agree. Even the trailer itself felt like it was meant to be underwhelming. It was only a minute long and they had zero development information for it afterwards. It's as if they didn't really want to show it off at all. NLG is definitely not the right developer for a Metroid title. Their track record just doesn't make sense for it. And their style is too cartoon like for Metroid. I feel it's at its best when it has dark gritty graphics with a foreboding atmosphere. Metroid was inspired by Alien after all. So it kind of feels like they took Alien and turned it into a sporting event designed for 10 year olds.
Metroid,3a3zj1,Moonpiles,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:26:49 2015 UTC,"Anyone working on the game has got to be disheartened by the backlash, and that sucks. I hope that they understand though that the fans aren't mad at NLG, they're mad at Nintendo."
Metroid,3a3zj1,thestinkyrat1,-10,Wed Jun 17 19:16:57 2015 UTC,"I absolutely hated Dark Moon. It lacked the portrait ghosts of the first game, and the mission structure was dog shit. Next Level games has ruined two game series so far. I'm not saying I want them to die in a fire, but they can certainly fuck right off."
Metroid,3a3zj1,Moonpiles,8,Wed Jun 17 02:40:17 2015 UTC,So you hate two perfectly good games because it isn't the exact same fucking game you played when you were ten years old. Just fuck that.

Metroid,3a3zj1,Moonpiles,3,Wed Jun 17 03:44:27 2015 UTC,The petition to get the game cancelled.
Metroid,3a3zj1,thestinkyrat1,3,Wed Jun 17 04:21:44 2015 UTC,"That is pretty rude. At least they're trying. I read that they had pitched a single player Metroid based on a desolate planet, but Nintendo rejected it. I feel bad for them now."

Metroid,3a5yfp,citizenofgaia,2,Wed Jun 17 14:16:38 2015 UTC,"I was mostly upset because I felt almost tricked by Nintendo. It might be a fun game, but the way they introduced it as a seemingly new IP at the championship then all of the sudden it's a Metroid game was just really poorly thought out. Although, I think even if it was immediately brought out with the full title at any time, it would be received poorly by hardcore fans.  I was super pissed after I found out because I was at work during the presentation and just kept looking forward to finishing my shift to watch it and hoping that I would find news of a great new Metroid game announcement (My fault for hyping myself up). But like you I have cooled off a bit and caught the treehouse stream where they played it. The blast ball part didn't really look interesting to me in the first place (even while it was still just blast ball) but I do think a four player co-op would be fun. I am still upset about it though because if you see some of the comments I made on other posts I talk about the fact that what really pulls me into metroid is the atmosphere that it puts you in; beautiful scenery, fitting music, and the feeling of being a badass alien murderer and Federation Force just doesn't appear to have that atmosphere. The characters look like they are supposed to be cutesy and shrunken down. To me it isn't going to feel like Metroid and shouldn't have the Metroid Prime title.  As for the stepping stone thing, I agree that it was 100% the intention of this game. During the treehouse stream one of the guys, who i assume had a hand in the game's creation (I could be wrong, I didn't really catch who he was), had said the purpose of Blast Ball was to introduce new players to the Metroid Prime control scheme or at least the mobile version of Metroid Prime's control scheme (I believe he was Talking about hunters but just didn't find the right words). I feel like if they had released a legitimate Wii U Metroid game along side it I wouldn't have been so butt hurt. There really isn't much fans can do except complain about it (which I have done my fair share of on their videos and such) and when people complain others will say they are childish. So hopefully Nintendo will find a better approach to bring in a new audience that doesn't make a bunch of the old audience mad. As for me, I probably end up buying it just like Other M so I can proudly say I own every Metroid game because I love what Nintendo has created and want to show my support for the franchise."
Metroid,3a5yfp,SuperJeeves,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:52:47 2015 UTC,"eh. I would have much preferred if they had actually brought Hunters back over some generic federation dudes. It's more in line with the whole coop aspect of the gameplay while actually making the devs put effort into designs.   And if this was really a reintroduction to Samus's character then I feel like they flopped. New players will see the four player coop and end up disappointed when the real Metroid game comes out, and new players will despise it for not being isolationist enough."

I still feel like there’s a little more work left for me to do in the Metroid Prime series. I can’t say when, but I want to make another one. …Sylux is actually chasing after Samus (at the end of Prime 3), and that’s where that game ends. There’s still more I want to build around the story of Sylux and Samus. There’s something going on between them. I want to make a game that touches upon [it]. I’m also thinking that, in that eventual game between Sylux and Samus that might get made, that I want to involve the [Galactic] Federation as well. So it would be a good idea to release a game like Federation Forces to flesh out its role in the galaxy before moving on to that.”"

Metroid,3a4pqi,thearchermage,6,Wed Jun 17 17:10:14 2015 UTC,That was a fantastic cluster fuck of teamwork. No seriously was having fun just watching it!   From the looks of it you can customize your arsenal to be support each other like shields and health drops. This kinda reminds me of Republic Commando a very wonderful and underrated star wars game that never got it's deserved sequel.
Metroid,3a4pqi,pfaccioxx,2,Wed Jun 17 05:51:36 2015 UTC,"I feel like this could be a Nintendo version of Halo 5, where you have 4 characters in a team, each with their own individual style. Just not with as much of a serious tone to it, since H5s story seems to reach a critical point in the entire saga.  Having pondered the game now, it makes sense that they would introduce this game at this precise moment. The Prime Trilogy got rereleased on WiiU (with a discount at the moment to boot!). And if my hopes turn out to be true, we just might get a little more insight on the Prime universe as a whole. The GF, frankly speaking, can't always count on Samus to be there helping them clean up their messes or deal with dangerous lifeforms. That's where these special task forces come in, comprised of four people on purpose: None of these guys on their own is capable of kicking as much monster ass as Samus. However, in a group of four, they should be able to do exactly that, or at least deal with trouble on a comparable level. That's why you're able to customize a loadout: While Samus is a freaking walking arsenal courtesy of her Power Suit, the GF's suits cannot operate on the same level since they lack the technological prowess of the Chozo, and so each member of the group has to itemize to the team's needs.  And on days off, the soldiers partake in bouts of Blastball to keep their skills from reclining. It promotes teamwork and clever item usage, but also teaches them to be efficient, since they are on a timer.  This is a side of the Metroid and especially the Prime universe we never got to see. We always KNEW the GF and their armed forces are there, they exist, and yet Samus is deployed on the actually dangerous missions because she is the most capable person in the universe to handle threats like the Metroids and the X due to her unique training and equipment. Yet the GF's forces can't just be sitting there, twiddling their thumbs or hiding in shame while Samus deals with supernatural threats or blasts away evil masterminds - no, they take care of the stuff Samus can't deal with at present. I feel like this has the potential to be the Halo ODST of Metroid Prime, and yet people are so eager to just throw it to the wayside.  If it turns out to be bad, oh well, big whoop and everyone was right from the get-go. I can always just try for the three endings I'm missing in Zero Mission or get to playing through both Super Metroid and the Prime Trilogy again."

We're upset that Nintendo thought this was the way to bring Metroid back at E3 this year. They could have pulled a Square Enix, and troll everybody by announcing the mobile shovelware first, then immediately showing off KH3 gameplay, or dropping Chibi-Final Fantasy on us then showing off the FF7 remake.  But no. This is all we get. This is what they think we wanted, what we'll buy, and apparently what their vision of the future of the franchise is.  I guess maybe they're working on something else, a proper prime sequel for Wii U or a proper 2d metroid for handhelds, but if so, why not announce that as well? Did they really think people weren't going to get really mad about this?"
Metroid,3a4pqi,thearchermage,2,Wed Jun 17 14:30:17 2015 UTC,why not announce that as well?   Cos it's deep in development and there not ready to show it off yet and cos it won't release later this year / early next year

Metroid,3a4pqi,pfaccioxx,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:27:52 2015 UTC,"Very good point. :) it sure felt like a spin-off to me, though."
Metroid,3a4pqi,SamusFacepalm,0,Wed Jun 17 15:41:03 2015 UTC,"How? It featured Samus, very heavily story based. Had other characters from the series."
Metroid,3a4pqi,pfaccioxx,3,Wed Jun 17 15:43:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, very heavily story based. As in, heavy-handed with it. Dialogue, monologues. Very little atmosphere. They basically gave Metroid the FF13 ""Destiny is Destiny"" treatment Team Ninja. Those were the guys to hand Metroid over to? Surprise, surprise, Samus gets bigger boobs and has to be saved by all the boys. Overall, it felt like the end of Wayne's World, and they thought, ""remember how Samus talked about her CO Adam in Fusion? Well, here's how WE thought that might have happened!"" POOF daddy issues, babies, cutscenes and weird reimaginings of character origins   Feels like a spin-off to me"
Metroid,3a4pqi,SamusFacepalm,0,Wed Jun 17 15:50:48 2015 UTC,Spinoff doesn't mean poorly made game.
Metroid,3a4pqi,pfaccioxx,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:18:46 2015 UTC,"Even if its fun it still isn't Metroid. It falls into the same trap that Super Paper Mario and Banjo Kazooie Nuts and Bolts did. It could end up as a really fun game, but it has strayed too far from the core values of the series and will be hated for it, regardless of how good or bad it turns out"
Metroid,3a4lxn,Putnam3145,2,Wed Jun 17 04:41:18 2015 UTC,"They don't change their facing because I have completely no idea how to do that, heheh.  I feel like doing something silly like writing an A* program so that it follows a path around obstacles (you can see me intentionally shooting it in such a way that it hits a wall near the end to demonstrate its dumbness), now. The script only changes acceleration direction, not speed itself.  The specific way I wrote the program makes it only missiles that home (no super missiles etc.), but it's literally the removal of a single if statement to ""fix"" that (if you like the kind of hilarity I'm sure would happen with homing wave/plasma beam shots).  Source code (for use with BizHawk)"

Metroid,3a2z65,BlockyAnubis,7,Wed Jun 17 01:22:10 2015 UTC,This is actually pretty good. I like it when people don't make their cosplays TOO bright. This got the shade of blue pretty accurate.
Metroid,3a2z65,Ryuutakeshi,2,Tue Jun 16 21:38:15 2015 UTC,"It may just be the pose that the model has been photographed in, but I like this. It doesn't seem to bring too much attention to a sexy aesthetic, but more of a badass sort of thing.  This pose makes me think: ""OK. Samus is somewhat relaxed while she listens to and considers the terms of a new possible bounty contract, but she isn't completely at ease. She understands the danger ahead and she's been made strong and stoic from her earlier missions. She's carefully considering what she might be getting into, but she's confident in her own abilities and desires a greater challenge.""  Just take a look at the expression on the model's face. I think it really represents what I've come to know and appreciate of Samus while playing through a few of the games. She's just ready to go again. She's all business; her countenance is thoughtful and extremely serious.  The Samus I've played as can't ever completely relax, considering all she's been through. At least this is how I feel.  To me, Samus is a badass. I like seeing cosplay of Samus with the model looking like a badass.  That piercing, semi-vacant look in her eyes is what really gets me along with the posture."

Metroid,3a75ac,Chaotix23,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:44:21 2015 UTC,"Prime 2 was a brilliant game aswell, although I would say that none of the Metroid games are horror... it's more like they inflict fear through isolation and loneliness, something which Metroid Prime captures perfectly."

Metroid,3a2cg8,MisterWoodhouse,2,Tue Jun 16 18:52:55 2015 UTC,"At least with that Other Metroid game they tried to make it a true Metroid title. The gameplay was pretty classic Metroid. I have a feeling people will start considering it not as bad, after this debacle."
Metroid,3a2cg8,SonderEber,0,Wed Jun 17 16:48:46 2015 UTC,"If the story and script hadn't been demonic dumpster fires, it would've been acceptable, but since they WERE demonic dumpster fires, copies of that game ought to be destroyed with big, big rocks."
Metroid,3a2cg8,MisterWoodhouse,3,Wed Jun 17 16:51:39 2015 UTC,"I disagree that they were that bad. But lets forgo story, for the fact they at least tried to keep the core gameplay. Call of Metroid: Federation Ops has tossed any semblance of classic Metroid gameplay out the 100th story window, which then landed on a busy freeway, ran over by numerous 18 wheelers, then swept down the gutter and into the sewer."

Metroid,3a4f89,Lasifer,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:33:26 2015 UTC,"Well they said they started on another Wii U game in November 2013, and there's still the possibility of Retro having multiple teams. I think there's a good chance that Retro's next game is another Metroid."
Metroid,3a24cu,GoldenBoy25,32,Tue Jun 16 17:09:25 2015 UTC,"We can still hope it's a 4DS game of samus ship that you can play in Metroid prime 4 on wii U.  On a more serious though, I just don't get it. No one is happy to see that fucking shit, what did cross nintendo mind by making such ... thing ? Where was the problem of making what we were all waiting for ? That was safe, that was sure, that would have work for them AND for us... I don't get it."
Metroid,3a24cu,Satiie,19,Tue Jun 16 17:13:32 2015 UTC,"one explanation I've heard — and I can't vouch for its veracity — is that Nintendo's Japanese fans aren't particularly interested in Metroid titles, and Nintendo is catering to their Japanese fans more than ever in these relatively desperate times.  no matter the reason, it's mind-boggling and deeply disappointing.  all I wanted from the E3 presentation was a Metroid Prime title that actually deserved to include ""Prime"" in its title.  fuck."
Metroid,3a24cu,8bitOrchid,16,Tue Jun 16 17:50:17 2015 UTC,"Well simply based on sales numbers, that's true. Metroid games don't sell well in Japan compared to other Nintendo titles. Hell they haven't done that well in America either. But that's also because Nintendo doesn't know how to market the series."
Metroid,3a24cu,8bitOrchid,9,Tue Jun 16 18:01:47 2015 UTC,"right.  and I understand that with low WiiU sales, it's important for their longevity to create and hype up titles that market research indicates will sell well.  but then we also get shameless cash grabs like Amiibo-exclusive content and halfassed efforts like the Metroid game in question, and I can't help but wonder what the fuck their marketing department is smoking."
Metroid,3a24cu,8bitOrchid,12,Tue Jun 16 18:10:21 2015 UTC,I really don't like the fact that amiibo has been so wildly successful. Now we will get that shoved down our throats for every game.
Metroid,3a24cu,trillyntruly,5,Tue Jun 16 18:13:03 2015 UTC,"me neither.  I don't understand it at all, but then again, I guess I'm not supposed to, since it seems oriented towards kids.  which sucks.  Nintendo has to know that it has a substantial fanbase among teens and young adults; they just don't seem to think it's a market worth tapping.  I'd say their loss, but it's really ours :\"
Metroid,3a24cu,8bitOrchid,3,Tue Jun 16 18:26:06 2015 UTC,it appeals to kids but in reality it's adult collectors that are buying them up.
Metroid,3a24cu,the_corruption,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:17:23 2015 UTC,"That's a great point that I hadn't given much thought.  I'm sure that Amiibo products comprise a significant portion of Nintendo's current revenue; I just can't help but be disappointed with how far they've fallen.  Of course their flagship franchise titles are almost always excellent, but even that won't save them in this day and age.  At least we have the new Zelda to look forward to."
Metroid,3a24cu,Revalow8,8,Wed Jun 17 03:47:59 2015 UTC,"is that Nintendo's Japanese fans aren't particularly interested in Metroid titles, and Nintendo is catering to their Japanese fans more than ever in these relatively desperate times.   Which is just fucking stupid. They could have easily made this game without slapping the Metroid Prime name on it and it would have had just as much interest. Metroid Prime on this game does nothing but alienate fans of the series. Anyone that cares about Metroid sees that this isn't Metroid. If you want to cater to the non-Metroid fans...why not just make it a new IP. It already looks like Generic Spaceshooter...why not keep it that way instead of bastardizing a respected IP."
Metroid,3a24cu,Ryuutakeshi,6,Tue Jun 16 19:20:40 2015 UTC,"Seriously, this! If the Japanese don't care about Metroid why use the IP anyway?"
Metroid,3a24cu,StimilRetcarahc,2,Tue Jun 16 20:00:11 2015 UTC,If they had called this Federation Force: Galactic Vanguard nobody would be pissed. Hell you could still say it was a spin off of the Metroid universe! But you CANNOT call a Metroid game a Metroid game without Samus! Or Metroids for that matter where are the fucking Metroids!
Metroid,3a24cu,Dubiono,6,Wed Jun 17 21:11:36 2015 UTC,Well that makes sense. Introduce a brand new Metroid spinoff title at an event not taking place in Japan in order to get Japanese players interested in a series they've never cared about.
Metroid,3a24cu,Lord_of_Phendrana,2,Tue Jun 16 19:55:38 2015 UTC,"In a genre they don't care about with a name indicative of a subseries with aspects of said genre.  The only thing I see being appealing in any way is the chibi style, but, even then, that's likely the result of the game not having a serious tone, based on appearances.  I get that people are pissed, but that's no excuse to turn off our brains."
Metroid,3a24cu,idsay,18,Wed Jun 17 01:45:27 2015 UTC,"I know why. They wanted to half ass a way to appease Metroid fans, but the Wii U is a dying console, and Nintendo knew Metroid would be an expensive game to make.   So instead of making that expensive game, they decided to put it on 3DS and slapped the Prime name so they could ""appease American fans"" and at the same time say that Prime is a spinoff series from the REAL Metroid.   They didn't think far ahead enough to grasp the consquences of what they did though, and ballsed it up. I'd rather have no Metroid than this slap in the face. After Other M, this is our appeasement?"
Metroid,3a24cu,pootiecakes,10,Tue Jun 16 17:53:41 2015 UTC,"So, just so I understand, the Wii U is definitely on it's way out? E3 is all about appeasing to the rest of the industry, not just fans. Why wouldn't Nintendo be trying to sell the Wii U while it still has time? Didn't they say that the NX isn't meant to succeed the Wii U?  Here's something else I don't understand about this, I thought Nintendo's pool of cash was large enough that they don't have to worry about going bankrupt for quite some time. So why are they behaving like they need to make these cheap cash-ins. With the recent success of games such as 3D World, MK8, Smash 4 and DKTF, why would Nintendo think they still need to make something gimmicky when people clearly want the games to return to their roots?  My concern here is that due to the success of mobile oriented and free-to-play games, Nintendo is drifting towards that end and is making games which are cheap and easy to make but grab a big initial profit, and can be easily marketable with Amiibo and things such as continued spin-off games and merchandising."
Metroid,3a24cu,Dubiono,3,Tue Jun 16 18:27:17 2015 UTC,"wii u will be fine. it was a niche console when it came out, no one is buying a Wii U to play yet another call of duty. nintendo IP is why you buy a nintendo product.  why they would shit on the metroid IP with this...weird bobblehead blaster master game? no idea"
Metroid,3a24cu,Lord_of_Phendrana,2,Tue Jun 16 18:56:15 2015 UTC,"You made me just realize that they didn't unveil the new Zelda at E3 at all this year because they will likely repuporse this current one to be released on the NX, not unlike Twilight Princess...  Jesus Christ, how very sad for Wii U owners."
Metroid,3a24cu,Dubiono,2,Wed Jun 17 19:34:14 2015 UTC,"Look man, the writing is on the wall. The majority of the games in that event were 3DS focused. They even mentioned the NX information is coming in 2016, as if trying to get us hyped for their next console. The writing is on the wall.   They have a lot of money, but that money isn't eternal. And while games like 3D World and MK8 sold well, the Wii U has a bunch of games that have only done ok in sales terms. DKTF was considered a huge dissapointment you know? And the Wii U is selling, less and less as the months go on. Not only that; the 3DS is running out of steam, and that is Nintendo's most profitable, dedicated system atm. So they're focused on pumping out as much stuff for the 3DS.   It really isn't that big of a concern. Yes, Nintendo is heading towards cheaper games. But Nintendo has always been the kind of company to look for ways to make their games run cheap while being good. But at the moment, their systems, both Wii U and 3DS are running on steam, and Nintendo are struggling to not let them collapse before they move on to NX."
Metroid,3a24cu,joecb91,2,Tue Jun 16 18:36:26 2015 UTC,"That is all very true. I suppose I've personally gotten my moneys worth out of both systems, but I've always had more faith in the Wii U than most. Here's to the NX and hopefully Samus will help reign in a new generation when it comes."
Metroid,3a24cu,DaPurpleHippo,2,Tue Jun 16 18:49:44 2015 UTC,"For Nintendo, ever since the Gamecube, expensive games have always been a niche for them, but that does not mean they don't come out. If the NX sells well, there's still a chance yet we'll have our Metroid dreams come true."
Metroid,3a24cu,henryuuk,3,Tue Jun 16 18:59:09 2015 UTC,You hit the nail on the head my friend.
Metroid,3a24cu,kaijudrifting,3,Tue Jun 16 17:18:41 2015 UTC,"They seem to think that they have to add a new gimmick for every game in a series, but they don't need to do that.  Even if it is similar to what we have all played before, just make it GOOD and we will be happy."

But calling it ""Prime"" (a name with a LOT of weight behind it) and then showing me generic, blocky-looking space soccer is just a recipe for huge emotional whiplash. I'm personally affronted, honestly."
Metroid,3a24cu,the_corruption,10,Tue Jun 16 18:21:38 2015 UTC,You've summed up my feeling PERFECTLY.
Metroid,3a24cu,marioman63,6,Tue Jun 16 18:33:38 2015 UTC,people were fine with metroid PRIME pinball. and hunters.
Metroid,3a24cu,the_corruption,20,Tue Jun 16 19:06:57 2015 UTC,"Hunters wasn't bad and at least mostly felt like a Prime game. It wasn't developed by Retro and didn't have the same quality, but I would have taken Hunters 2 over this any day.  Pinball was an obvious spinoff and it came during a period when we were actually getting real Prime games and so no one really cared that much. If they just announced Metroid Prime Pinball 2 after nearly a decade without a Prime game people would probably be even more livid than they are now."
Metroid,3a24cu,marioman63,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:23:40 2015 UTC,"Hunters wasn't bad and at least mostly felt like a Prime game.   explain how? it too was practically mission based, had individual levels (each planet was seperate from the rest), and focused on combat, not exploration. sounds a lot like federation force to me."
Metroid,3a24cu,DBrody6,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:59:37 2015 UTC,"Hunters wasn't mission based. You went from area to area exploring and had to back track to old areas once you got new equipment. It was very much exploration based. Yes, combat was slightly more emphasized than in the first Prime, but it was still heavily exploration based.  If you think Hunters is anything like Federation Force then I'm not sure what games you are looking at."

You went from area to area exploring and had to back track to old areas once you got new equipment.    im 3 planets in, and so far, there is no hint that i will ever need to return to older planets. when does this ""proper metroid"" stuff start?"
Metroid,3a24cu,just_a_jar,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:10:01 2015 UTC,"Haven't played it in ages, so I can't tell you exactly but I distinctly remember having to go back to one of the stations and it was also mentioned in a review I just read. As you unlock new beams there are doors that were previously locked that you can now open.  As for ""proper metroid"" I'm not really sure how having different planets makes it different. The original Metroid had different zones connected by long elevators. The planets are analogous to different zones. Prime 3 took place on different planets and derelict ships. It might not be as focused on exploration as previous Metroid games, but it is a lot closer to a ""true"" Metroid than anything Federation Force has shown."
Metroid,3a24cu,marioman63,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:50:41 2015 UTC,"i can see the planets marking different zones, but so far, it has felt like each one is a secluded level. it would be like going to brinstar in super, then norfair, then the ship, then meridia, and so on, but NEVER have to backtrack."
Metroid,3a24cu,Teh_Pagemaster,9,Sat Jul 4 03:47:27 2015 UTC,"Metroid Prime Pinball was literally a pinballized version of Metroid Prime. The name actually made sense. You went to the MP locations, killed MP bosses, even killed Metroid Prime itself! The name fit!   I hated that name for Hunters because it had absolutely no purpose being in the Prime series. But the Prime series was the hot thing at the time so they probably figured, fuck it, people will buy it anyways."
Metroid,3a24cu,marioman63,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:44:48 2015 UTC,"apparently all a metroid game needs is samus. pretty sad if a metroid game cant contain samus and be liked by the community. mario gets away with it, why not metroid?"
Metroid,3a24cu,Swaggerlisk,5,Tue Jun 30 04:05:21 2015 UTC,"Note though, that those came out while we were getting regular metroid games with the prime trilogy. Not after 5-8 years of nothing."

Metroid,3a24cu,wreckingcanon,2,Tue Jun 30 04:24:43 2015 UTC,"Well you have to consider that those games were being released alongside the Prime series. We were content with these titles because we were aware that they were spin-offs of a current series. But this game has come out after a LOOOONG hiatus in the Prime series, and as an E3 title at that. Everyone had their hopes up for a real addition to Prime, not this typical mini-game shooter."
Metroid,3a24cu,TheFullMonty1394,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:03:20 2015 UTC,"its a metroid game though, isnt it? oh right, it doesnt have samus, since thats all that matters right? thats why you LOVE other m so much, isnt it?   its super common for nintendo to expand franchises like this. just about every big nintendo series has had a spinoff by this point."
Metroid,3a24cu,Gyper,13,Tue Jun 30 04:30:56 2015 UTC,It's like they just slapped the Metroid Prime label on this game as a sort of buzzword in an attempt to increase sales. I bet it has nothing to do with the actual Metroid Prime story.
Metroid,3a24cu,gotpez,14,Tue Jun 16 19:08:08 2015 UTC,"The game would have been recieved better if they showed a different segment. We got 20 seconds of something. All they had to do was render Samus coming out of her gunship, have a chozo somewhere, or a vague metroid pulsing with energy with 2016 under it and we would be going ape shit."

I know it has its faults, but at least it plays like a metroid game, looks like one, sounds like one, and most importantly ACTUALLY HAS SAMUS in the game. This is just a cash-grab. Nothing about this resembles metroid. They probably should've made that a new ip instead of slapping the Prime name, let alone the Metroid name on it."

Metroid,3a6sy8,thequirkyturkey,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:43:05 2015 UTC,What about a Metroid mystery dungeon aspect where certain areas of the map become randomized? Like a long corridor with some spiky dudes and flying dudes gets random platforms and acid puddles on your way to pick up your varia suit. Or the vertical ones could have random floaty turtle things. Just throwing ideas out there...

Metroid,3a89r9,gameboyzapgbz,3,Thu Jun 18 00:31:34 2015 UTC,"I'll copy and paste what I said in another thread.  Well the last Metroid game was 5 years ago, and it wasn't very good. Some fans like myself have been waiting nearly 8 years for a new Metroid title, some for 11 years because the last 2D entry was in 2004. People have been waiting a long time for a new Metroid, and what we got was a spinoff that doesn't look like Metroid, play like Metroid, or feel like Metroid. Imagine after 8 years of no Zelda games and the first new Zelda game was Hyrule Warriors. Sure it will probably be a fun game, but it's not what people want."
Metroid,3a89r9,Wombo194,-5,Thu Jun 18 00:35:17 2015 UTC,"(My favorite series being zelda) I'd be happy if a zelda spin-off was announced after 8 years and not bitch and moan about getting a new game in the series meaning nintendo is at least doing something noot saying ""This game looks like shit and I'm never going to buy it"" guess what I love the Metroid prime series and seeing this game makes me happy because it gives me hope  I hate people who ask for a game and then when they get what they want with a small twist and they start bitching like it's the end of the world  On that last part this goes to you why?  Why would you even complain this game looks fun from what I've seen and seems to be a Metroid prime multiplayer spin-off that sounds amazing  Also metroid prime was good besides the story"
Metroid,3a89r9,Wombo194,5,Thu Jun 18 00:59:32 2015 UTC,"Good for you that this gives you optimism, too bad it was basically confirmed that no big/real Metroid game is in development.   I hate people who ask for a game and then when they get what they want with a small twist and they start bitching like it's the end of the world   I'm complaining because it's not what I, nor many other people wanted. I wouldn't call FF a ""small twist,"" it's a very drastic departure from what Metroid is. It isn't very hard to understand, and it's my opinion I'm disappointed. It hurts even more that this is made by Next Level Games, who proposed a real Metroid and instead made Luigi's Mansion 2 (which was a good game), which is fine, but it sucks to see that this is the idea that they went with instead.   On my point of it looking fun, I say this because it does look a little fun. I also think Call of Duty is fun, but that doesn't mean I would be ok a Metroid spinoff similar to Call of Duty, or that I think Call of Duty is a great game. It doesn't mean I can't prefer something else, and be disappointed that I didn't get something else. Just because I think it looks a little fun, it doesn't mean the game will be good and worth my money. It's ok for me to be disappointed. Also, if my tone is misleading, I am simply disappointed, and I don't think it's the end of the world."
Metroid,3a89r9,Donald_Crump,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:13:03 2015 UTC,Let me copy and paste something here  What if the campaign makes it one of the best metroid prime games?  We don't know so we should save our criticisms for after the game releases  Plus we're getting a new metroid which is going to be on better hardware (nx) and the game would probably have been at the tail end of the wii u life span anyway  The future is bright be happy and stop being so frustrated over FF us Metroid fans are getting a little something on the side while waiting for Metroid nx

Metroid,3a2or7,Triskiller,16,Tue Jun 16 19:28:46 2015 UTC,"Why is everyone so pissed about Federation Force? It looks like a fun sub game to hold us over for the next actual Samus starring Metroid game.   I think the big problem is that this is a subgame that seems completely disconnected from the Metroid Prime brand, plus it's been 5-8 years since the last actual Metroid title. They can only hold us over for so long."
Metroid,3a2or7,Ryuutakeshi,43,Tue Jun 16 20:17:49 2015 UTC,"It's not necessarily that the game is bad, but what does this do to the Metroid brand that's already been damaged by Other M?"
Metroid,3a2or7,Dubiono,15,Tue Jun 16 19:38:53 2015 UTC,Nothing.
Metroid,3a2or7,henryuuk,7,Tue Jun 16 22:13:34 2015 UTC,"Apparently not, judging by the reactions to the event thus far."
Metroid,3a2or7,Dubiono,2,Tue Jun 16 22:20:04 2015 UTC,"Sorry, i thought we were talking about shit that actually mattered, as opposed to a bunch of 'fans' holding a temper tantrum about something they don't even know any details about.    When talking about what something will do for the future of a franchise, you don't look at fan feedback, you look at what will change with the company making the game depending on feedback. This game is a spin off, so at most what it could mean for the future is that it becomes a spin off series that expands on its own (like Yoshi from Mario) if the game were to do well.    If the game does bad, that won't change anything for the actual metroid franchise, because it is a spin off.    This isn't like with Awakening, where they casualized the series, and then it ended up selling really well, and now the series has been altered because of it."
Metroid,3a2or7,henryuuk,11,Tue Jun 16 22:29:08 2015 UTC,"Are you seriously going to tell me that this is okay especially after Other M was badly received 5 years ago, nothing since then has been announced, and the franchise's 25th anniversary was ignored?"
Metroid,3a2or7,Forgotten_Tacos,-4,Wed Jun 17 00:58:08 2015 UTC,Okay as in : this won't matter for the franchise identity of meyroid in the longrun? Yes
Metroid,3a2or7,henryuuk,5,Wed Jun 17 08:11:07 2015 UTC,"Considering the fact that Nintendo hardly provides any attention to Metroid these days, it definitely does matter in the long run. We had a crappy game, Nintendo sat back and waited, and came back out with this. Everyone was expecting a comeback not a shitty dated looking co-op shooter. So yes it does matter to the franchise identity, considering every game was actually good up until Other M."
Metroid,3a2or7,DarkSamus987,4,Wed Jun 17 08:41:18 2015 UTC,"The thing is, this is about the BRAND REPUTATION, and the representation of games such as Metroid on Nintendo platforms.   This displays a lack of sight on Nintendo's part to support their darker outing with a proper continuation after the mess that followed after Other M. This can damage Nintendo's future endeavours if fans of this type of game don't believe that Nintendo can satisfy this itch in the long run. People then can't justify buying Nintendo systems for games they don't believe they'll get, and sales of Metroid falls by the wayside.   For an already niche series, that's bad.   At least in the case of Awakening, that change is what saved the Fire Emblem series from being demolished."
Metroid,3a2or7,Dubiono,-7,Tue Jun 16 22:39:42 2015 UTC,"Then my question is : lets say this spin off is what ends up saving, but also transforming, the franchise like awakening did. What would your reaction then be ?"
Metroid,3a2or7,henryuuk,8,Tue Jun 16 22:42:02 2015 UTC,"Well that's the funny thing. I don't believe the franchise needed saving at all. Other M was a misstep, but all the franchise really needed was a step in a more traditional direction to appease fans. This is a departure at the wrong time of the franchise's history, and that's bad. It's like making Sonic Boom after Sonic Lost World.   I don't think the franchise needed saving at all. Maybe saving from lackluster sales, but not a critical saving. It just needed a little prob back onto the rail track.  This game will most likely be good, but it will not be given a chance. For starters, it's an FPS on handheld, which is already a strike against it since traditionally FPS have performed poorly on handhelds. It's got a Wind Waker infamy surrounding it too, so now it's gotten off on a bad foot in all sorts of ways possible. It also has the misfortune of being released in the zenith years of the 3DS, when sales are slowing down.   So the odds are so stacked against this game, that it can do little but damage the brand of both Metroid and Nintendo."
Metroid,3a2or7,Dubiono,-2,Tue Jun 16 23:02:52 2015 UTC,"Fire Emblem didn't need saving it either, except from lackluster sales.    Also, if a game is good, but sells badly because of misconceptions and bias, then it becomes 'a hidden gem' Which often ends up bossting series popularity in the long run."
Metroid,3a2or7,henryuuk,5,Tue Jun 16 23:08:54 2015 UTC,"Technically it did. The DS games suffered from lackluster critical reception, and the Wii game was not well recieved at all.   It can become a hidden gem, but at this point in time, Nintendo needs less hidden gems and more normal ones. Especially in a genre they do not give much attention."
Metroid,3a2or7,Dubiono,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:19:17 2015 UTC,"Damaged by Other M? I still don't understand why Other M 'damaged' the franchise. I loved Other M, completed it multiple times. It was fun to play.."
Metroid,3a2or7,Conor3000,3,Wed Jun 17 09:50:13 2015 UTC,"The gameplay wasn't the problem, as most people will tell you. It's the story, and story is still part of the game."
Metroid,3a2or7,Dubiono,2,Wed Jun 17 15:00:09 2015 UTC,"I dunno, to me the gameplay was pretty mediocre as well, mostly due to the clunky D-Pad/auto-aim/missile aim controls and constant dodge+charge spam.  Add in the cutscenes with lackluster plot, forced sequences where you're walking slowly, first-person hunting for pixels, and quick-time events, and you get a game that may not be bad gameplay-wise, but it's one that I don't really wish to replay."
Metroid,3a2or7,NoxTheWizard,27,Wed Jun 17 15:11:34 2015 UTC,"8 years since last good Metroid game 13 years since last 2D Metroid Last Metroid game was terrible.   I honestly didn't expect any Metroid at all, I was placing my bets on 2016 and I think we might still get a real Metroid announced next year or something. But the first new Metroid game in a long time and this is what we get? And it's from Next Level Games, who have proven they can make good games and they make this shit? It would be fine if this was announced along with another Metroid game, but no, this is what we're stuck with for now. NOBODY asked for a multiplayer, action based Metroid game."
Metroid,3a2or7,Wombo194,26,Tue Jun 16 20:06:43 2015 UTC,"I was more happy with nothing.  Then i heard Federation Force and thought of how ODST was a decent Halo spinoff  But after seeing that it was Blastball, i wanted to burn my house down"
Metroid,3a2or7,DaPurpleHippo,4,Tue Jun 16 20:35:18 2015 UTC,Federation Force and Blastball are separate. I'm guessing Blastball is like a separate mode in Federation Force.
Metroid,3a2or7,Moulinoski,0,Tue Jun 16 21:52:18 2015 UTC,"Im saying Blastball looked like a decent game, and very Metroid like. Then seeing that Blastball was on the same engine as Fed Force, it was discouraging"
Metroid,3a2or7,DaPurpleHippo,3,Tue Jun 16 22:40:18 2015 UTC,I still don't understand. If you like Blastball why would it sharing the same engine as Federation Force discourage you? And what about it discourages you from what?
Metroid,3a2or7,Moulinoski,7,Tue Jun 16 22:41:53 2015 UTC,"Because playing as federation troopers in a Coop Metroid game makes me think that nintendo wanted to show off cool graphics and multiplayer scenarios. I was thinking about how it would be cool to roam through Metroid environments with friends and explore, fighting enemies and such. But the cartoony characters and turning a more serious series childish is a shock to me. It's almost the exact opposite of the entire series. On it's own im sure it's a great game, but it's not a Metroid game."
Metroid,3a2or7,DaPurpleHippo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:48:44 2015 UTC,I'm hoping that Federation Force turns out to be a really good Republic Commando clone.

Complaining about games you've never played.  lol  But seriously, the fact that Next Level Games is making it suggests that it probably IS going to be good.  Treehouse was streaming it recently and it looked really fun.  Besides, Nintendo has used the Prime series for spinoffs before, remember Hunters?  This is nothing new for them.  Finally, we've learned before that Nintendo was working on both a 3D, Prime-style game for Metroid and a 2D sidescroller game.  They probably just haven't got enough progress on the 2D project to show it off yet.  Y'all are just overreacting"
Metroid,3a2or7,SomeMetroid,6,Tue Jun 16 21:11:41 2015 UTC,"I'll stop complaining when they have something that people actually want to show. I'm sure Federation will be ok, but there's no reason for the Metroid brand to be slapped on it and I thought NLG could have made something better. Also the fact that the ""Prime"" series is just considered a spinoff is terrible anyways. Really, it looks like an eshop game that would be revealed in a small Nintendo Direct, then released for like $10."
Metroid,3a2or7,Wombo194,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:17:28 2015 UTC,"I'm 100% sure this will be an e-shop title, It looks like a DS game."
Metroid,3a2or7,Forgotten_Tacos,6,Wed Jun 17 01:01:36 2015 UTC,"I think the main reason why people are angry is because it's been 5 years since the last actual Metroid title, and in my opinion, 8 years since the last half decent game, whilst year after year countless Mario and Zelda games get shoveled out to make sales and satisfy that demographic (I understand business is business).  To slap ""Metroid Prime"" on this game in some desperate effort to increase sales is frankly disgusting. As a game on its own, it should hold out well, it looks enjoyable and a blast, but it is not, and will never be Metroid."
Metroid,3a2or7,Feedmybeast1,7,Tue Jun 16 23:15:20 2015 UTC,"It's not a matter of if it is fun or if it is good, it is the way they went about it. It would be fine if the announced this along side a proper Metroid game, or better yet just leave the Metroid name out of it. It would be like if Valve made a new game, need to sell it so they were like ""hmmm lets throw the Half-life name on it even though this game has nothing to do with it."" The hate isn't on the game itself,  it is that it has the Metroid title for no reason and that title could have waited till a proper game for the franchise comes out. Waiting 5 years and finally seeing the name slapped onto something that truly doesn't have anything to do with Metroid is the kicker"
Metroid,3a2or7,John_the_goat,5,Tue Jun 16 21:26:19 2015 UTC,"The problem is that Metroid isn't Zelda. We don't get the annual Metroid game that will try to do better than the last. They might be ""saving the story"" for another game but we don't know when that will be if ever."
Metroid,3a2or7,timelessjr0d,3,Tue Jun 16 21:44:27 2015 UTC,"The game itself on treehouse didn't look bad, honestly it could be a really great game and potentially the best game on the 3ds. However it wasn't Metroid or really in the spirit of Metroid. That's why I am disappointed."
Metroid,3a2or7,timelessjr0d,6,Tue Jun 16 21:48:24 2015 UTC,"The difference is that the zelda series is one of nintendo's biggest gaming franchises. They get a new release pretty much every year. But here at /r/Metroid we haven't had a new game in 5 years. Then we see this multiplayer shooter game with the name ""Metroid Prime"" slapped onto it. Not only is it pointless, it just seems like an utter slap in the face to the fans."
Metroid,3a2or7,twinfyre,4,Wed Jun 17 01:26:14 2015 UTC,"You're assuming there is a Metroid title in development aside from this, OP."
Metroid,3a2or7,Forgotten_Tacos,12,Wed Jun 17 00:54:43 2015 UTC,"Everyone is overreacting... But now after I calmed down, and watching the Treehouse, I have to say it doesn't look that bad at all.

Metroid,3a2or7,Moulinoski,10,Tue Jun 16 20:18:11 2015 UTC,"With Nintendo Land, it's probably expected that if Metroid were represented, it would be as some sort of mini-game.  For a stand-alone 3DS title, it's jarring to be told ""this is the new Metroid!"" and with-hold Samus as the lead character.  Zelda: Four Swords still had elements of Zelda in it. Tingle's Rosey Rupeeland didn't carry the Zelda name on its title trying to make it seem like it was a new Zelda game.   Hopefully, it turns out we're all wrong and Federation Force is closer to Metroid than we're being led to believe."
Metroid,3a2or7,SpahsgonnaSpah,3,Tue Jun 16 21:23:24 2015 UTC,"I mean, the combat in FF does seem sort of similar to Metroid Prime, just with more options."

Metroid,3a2or7,Divemissile,2,Wed Jun 17 01:06:39 2015 UTC,Have you checked how many dislikes the trailer for it on Nintendo's YouTube channel has? Eleven thousand last time I checked. It's crazy.
Metroid,3a2or7,MunkyUTK,2,Wed Jun 17 02:48:28 2015 UTC,"I think people are upset (at least I am) because there's no reason to believe that there is another, better, actual Metroid game coming.  This could very well be the continued bastardization of the series, and that is not something to be OK with.  I mean, all they had to do was show a screenshot of a proper Wii U Metroid game and people would've been happy, or at the very least not pissed off.  Instead, what we got is what appears to be a generic coop shooter loosely based off of Prime Hunters.  Maybe that'll be fun, but if you're wanting a metroidvania experience (as bigtime Metroid fans can be assumed to want) then you're still hosed with nothing to indicate something better is actually out there.    Not to mention the metroidvania genre is the epitome of the single-player gaming experience.   Being required to play with others just isn't metroidvania-y at all."

Metroid,3a5cbk,Plinkman,5,Wed Jun 17 10:20:47 2015 UTC,"This. Today I had a thought. What if this game really sets up the federation as a shady, darker force? I mean in the 2 levels we saw the federation going to foreign planets and collecting animals to research (probably research to weaponize them, ala the space pirates) and we saw the troopers intercept and destroy space pirate supply ships in space pirate territory (they didnt say they were military ships? and the ships didnt shoot back?) If this is the case I like the idea of a cutesy art style, and the game leading the players to thinking they're on the good guys side as they get their hands dirty in nefarious acts... only to end up fighting Samus.  And do people really think Samus wont show up in a Metroid game just because we didn't see her in a trailer?! I'd bet Samus either shows up as a perk that can be called in to help, or as a boss of some sort."

I'm just trying to think of how this game could have an interesting story/fit into the metroid timeline. Has there been any talk of a campaign in addition to the co-op and blastball?  I just think it would be cool for the average gamer to assume they're playing as a ""good guy"" and completing all these hard tasks for the federation, only to find out in the end the organization they did all this work for was kind of a negative force in the galaxy.  Trying really hard to be optimistic..."
Metroid,3a5cbk,thearchermage,2,Wed Jun 17 16:06:00 2015 UTC,"No. Our feelings are valid. I, for one, would like Nintendo to know just exactly how upset I am, and I think I speak for a large portion of the community when I say that.

I'm not saying you have to worship Federation Forces just because it's Metroid, I'm saying we'd probably be more likely to get a proper-looking Metroid by saying ""Thanks Nintendo but what we REALLY want is X, Y and Z"" instead of saying ""Fuck you Nintendo, this isn't good enough!"""

That's why fans are angry."
Metroid,3a78pn,Chaotix23,7,Wed Jun 17 20:10:55 2015 UTC,"Or perhaps read some comments, this has been brought up a million times already.  People dislike it mainly for:  1) A complete and uncalled for shift of tone. From a franchise build on sublime atmosphere we got to chibi Galactic Federation troopers playing football.  2) Completely disconnected from the gameplay people actually wanted.  3) Honestly, after sodding 8 years of waiting since the last title we get... This?  I agree a petition to get it canceled is dumb, but it doesn't make this any less of a cynical meaningless cash grab. If Nintendo had simply made this a completely new IP there would have been far less fuss. Especially since this came tacked with the announcement the next ""proper"" Metroid title will most likely be on the NX."

I know that nintendo is famous for taking conceptual expeditions, seemingly in the name of both art and science at the same time. But they are also famous for doing the same formula again and again, improving as they go because they found something we like and wish to make it better. After Other M it's time to listen up and refine the old formula like we want, nay need. Us bitching about it is cheaper than a focus group and if they refuse to listen. Its time to make it abundantly clear what we want with a petition."

Metroid,3a2rk7,OranJ1zz,8,Tue Jun 16 20:34:31 2015 UTC,"I think the Federation has been trying to emulate Chozo armour designs for a long time now. Sylux's suit is a stolen federation prototype and it has missiles, and powered beams, shields and all that that.  The marines in the game have beams sort of similar to Sylux's in the way they charge and operate, perhaps the designs are related."

Metroid,3a2rk7,Ryuutakeshi,6,Tue Jun 16 21:17:53 2015 UTC,"THEN I'd buy it and play it. Then there'd be a reason for catching those monsters. Then there'd be a story to it. Metroid has never needed much story to drive it, but they always had at least a little.   Though now I'm wondering if Samus has a favorite Blastball team that she roots for."
Metroid,3a2rk7,bigdog54,2,Tue Jun 16 21:23:59 2015 UTC,My head cannon right now is its post fusion after the federation had to remove samus's armor and we're able to reverse engineer it to make new prototypes for the soldiers.
Metroid,3a2rk7,Ryuutakeshi,3,Tue Jun 16 21:31:42 2015 UTC,"Which just makes me envision the eventual fight against the federation in the post-fusion game. Again, this game is making me wish it was something other than what it is."
Metroid,3a2rk7,bigdog54,2,Tue Jun 16 21:34:07 2015 UTC,"Well we now know it seems to be mission based. So maybe there's a single player third game mode that wasn't ready to show or saved (hence the ""development in progress"")."
Metroid,3a2rk7,Ryuutakeshi,2,Tue Jun 16 21:44:09 2015 UTC,"It seems like the main mode IS the single player, judging by the press kit."

Metroid,3a2rk7,TehDingo,2,Wed Jun 17 01:49:26 2015 UTC,"I have a theory:  If this game is set after the events of Fusion, I would expect the Federation to be after Samus for Destroying SR388 and the BSL research station.

Honestly, it's not very appealing, doesn't seem very memorable, and doesn't really even look like Metroid. My guess is that it's probably going to consist of five or six of these levels, and that's it.  I won't pick it up, even if the price drops drastically."
Metroid,3a2rk7,Funspoyler,5,Wed Jun 17 01:57:48 2015 UTC,"To be honest, this looks fun.  Is like they saw Monster Hunter selling millions and tought ""well, how can we nintendize MH?"", and here you go.  I never really liked MH because is so overly complicated, and not to mention the beggining of the Wii's MH really was forgetable (I just coudln't force myself to keep gathering plants and materials omg). But this... this I can see where its going, a simpler formula with a familiar setting.  Keep an eye on this.  Edit: I guess I understand the chibi characters design, for the same reason splatoon is going strong and to differienciate the thing from the pletora of ""Manly Warfare: Testosterone Edition"" stigma of this type of games."

And it's common in Nintendo's design that they develop a game around gameplay and an idea, and find characters/a series to represent it afterwards.  You can reqad the Iwata Asks with Splatoon devs to hear about their process, at one point talking about it being a Mario game.  Similar thing happened with Sunshine.

Metroid,3a6y2e,DanielisAwesome52,3,Wed Jun 17 19:42:49 2015 UTC,"I think its mostly the delivery, the lack of real Metroid news, the fact that we've heard nothing from Sakamoto, the fact that Tanabe (Prime Director) only started talking after the damage from the bait and switch announcement. That's what is pissing me off mostly  But another thing, that would've been a small complaint had it not been in the Nintendo World Championship, but I absolutely hate this Blast Ball crap. It doesn't belong in a Metroid game for any reason, and I knew, I just knew the moment they showed it and made this dramatic event out of it at the NWC it was the next Metroid, I could just tell, and that came with the realization that this things existence means that one of the two devs that could be working on a real Metroid wasn't working on it.  I know this subreddit is flippant about it, but I think theres a few real reasons true fans are upset. Like I said it means half the teams that could've been making our Samus-centric exploration type Metroid aren't doing that. Another thing is other game series don't get spin offs that stand alone like this, they always have some main series game in dev or recently put out to tie the situation together, but right now Tanabe has confirmed theres no Prime game, and won't say whether Sakamoto is truly working on anything. Lastly its been so long without even a hello from Sakamoto anybody who isn't part of the reddit circlejerk has legitimate concerns as to whether or not he's doing anything, let alone anything Metroid/Samus related  I legitimately think the campaign mode may be good, as long as the mission aren't designed solely for four players and can be completed without a massive spike in difficulty just because you don't want to deal with other people and play it solo. I hate the Blast Ball mode, but as long as that's a fully optional side mode it'll be fine. The style is fine for a spin-off, and Tanabe has been saying it was designed with the New 3DS (and to an extent the CCP) in mind so that'll be good for controls.  I do think this is too dissonant to deserve the Metroid Name, maybe if they had called it Galactic Federation Force Prime, and left Metroid out of it I'd feel better about it. Just the fact that there's even a multiplayer mode far removes it from a decent Metroid game, I know Prime 2 had it, and even then it felt super out of place, but the real example is Hunters, it was the worst selling Metroid game (I'm pretty sure Other M sold better) and yet rather than looking at that and going ""hmm the one game in this series that focusd on multiplayer was a huge flop, lets not do that again"" they instead went with their typical ""It must've been a fluke, no way our ideas that drastically changed the atmosphere and fluidity of a series caused that, nope not something Nintendo made, there's no way that's what happened, guess we'll try the samething again, it'll definitely do better this time, now that we're forcing the multiplayer on them, yeah that'll work"""
Metroid,3a6y2e,ZetaRayZac,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:00:07 2015 UTC,"It was obviously never planned to be a metroid game. Which, if the recent interview with kensuke tanabe is accurate, means they have not been and are not working on a metroid game for this console generation."
Metroid,3a6y2e,thequirkyturkey,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:53:15 2015 UTC,"For me, the biggest insult is that it's a sports arena game rather than a single player story/exploration-based game. This E3 has has seen a huge focus on multiplayer games and very few single player games, so Nintendo is not the only offender on that front, but I still don't like it.   I also don't like the fact that it's on 3DS. Simply put, the 3DS graphics are looking dated. I'd love to have a classic sidescrolling Metroid on the 3DS, but I wish they'd keep put the 3D games on the Wii U.  I didn't like the chibi art style, but it was honestly the least of my complaints."

At the same time we should definately not give them compliments for making bad games, but honestly, is Federation Force really that bad? Has anybody played it and said it was a bad game not worth buying? Sure, it does not seem to feature Samus and it seems to have a bigger focus on multiplayer.

There still is no wii-u animal crossing, which I know I was looking forwards to.  It's basically a board game, but from the trailer I don't even know wtf kind of board game. The trailer reminds me of a reading game. It just shows characters rolling dice, landing on spots, reading a card about ""you caught a fish today, move +1 spaces,"" and that's about it. I'm sure there are more mini-games to it than that, but as of now it looks incredibly underwhelming."
Metroid,3a5bpz,tonicodrea,4,Wed Jun 17 10:11:50 2015 UTC,"I admit I siged the petition like an idiot, but now I think about it.... I regret it now.  Even if we don't like a game it doesn't mean a game should be cancelled or banned.  It has a right to exist just like Hatred."

Metroid,3a5raa,Divemissile,3,Wed Jun 17 14:27:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the idea of a co op Metroid seems pretty cool to me. But the mission based structure is stupid.  Spinoffs are OK for Mario, Zelda and Pokemon because we get proper installments on a regular basis, bit we haven't seen a true Metroid in quiet a while"
Metroid,3a5raa,Pureownege75,2,Wed Jun 17 16:00:06 2015 UTC,"For starters, I am not for a petition, but I understand everyone who signs it.  At this point it doesn't matter if MPFS is a good or bad game. It's been 4 Years since Other M. MOM dealt serious damage to the franchise and a lot of fans felt betrayed.  The years went on, and the hope for a new game died a little bit more with every year. 2014 a Nintendo employe said that they are not developing a Metroid and don't plan to do so in the close future. Suddenly, there is Federation Squad. Metroid is defined by lonely exploring a hostyle environment. You pick up items that help you to proceed in different regions. A 4 player co-op FPS that contains a 3vs3 minigame is a slap in the face to everyone who hoped in the last years. It would've been no problem if they would've anounced an actual Metroidvania game to be released after FS. Right now there are two possibilitys.  Nintendo wants to raise awereness of the Franchise and plans to release a new Metroid later, to be enjoyed by the old and new fanbase.  Or they slapped the name on this to get an extra selling point.  Right now I pray for the first. If not Metroid is doomed"
Metroid,3a5raa,Screwattack94,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:55:18 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I feel furious. It's been 11 years since the last 2D Metroid and 5 years since the last Metroid in general, and now they are doing some minigame set in the world of Metroid?  And if that isn't bad enough, Nintendo cancelled 2 Metroid games that probably looked really good.  I don't take the petition so seriously, but honestly, I don't think anyone would look forward much to Federation Force, most people who like it think that it looks pretty fun but that's it."
Metroid,3a5raa,420_spacepizza,2,Wed Jun 17 13:54:57 2015 UTC,"dunno why you're getting downvoted for your opinion. I too have been waiting for a Nintend official 2D Metroid game but unfortunately I am seeing that not happening for a long, long time, if ever. I pretty much glossed over Other M since it was panned by the Metroid community.  I don't think it's unreasonable to be angry a series you love is getting such an uninspired spin-off, or having work in progress games cancelled, in fact it's a pretty natural response."

I do think we'll get our socks blown off by the upcoming WiiU one, but we got shitty soccer until then."

I don't have any bad feelings towards NLG for making a multiplayer shooter - those are a safe bet for a steady profit in this market, it's a good business decision and I'm sure the game will be adequate.  We're just all feeling so let down by Nintendo right now - feeling like they really, genuinely don't care about one of their best franchises. That they honestly think so little of Metroid that they'll slap the name on any old title for the sake of a few extra copies sold. That they don't respect the IP enough to give it even a third the attention they give Mario and Zelda. We all know how fantastic Metroid games can be when they're done well, crafted with care - masterpieces. But they're being careless with it, and they're not doing the series justice. It's just.... disheartening. It really is.  Many are coming to terms with that sincere disappointment by channeling into rage, and aiming it at the only target available: Federation Force."

Metroid,3a231g,TheLostWolf,4,Tue Jun 16 18:51:31 2015 UTC,"Anyone, preferably not a large company. An indie studio, or... Naughty Dog :P I am very partial towards Naughty Dog. Unfortunately I don't think any major studios are interested in buying Metroid because it probably isn't worth much. So most likely it is dead, they wont sell the IP anyway because they want to keep putting Samus in Smash. But idk! I'm not a game industry person! Don't quote me! :P"
Metroid,3a231g,deansan,0,Tue Jun 16 19:13:22 2015 UTC,I feel like Rocksteady could do something with it. Maybe CD projekt red?
Metroid,3a231g,TheLostWolf,2,Tue Jun 16 19:36:26 2015 UTC,Oh my god...yes CD Projekt RED?! I could cry.
Metroid,3a231g,cnskatefool,-1,Tue Jun 16 19:38:39 2015 UTC,Dunno. Maybe start a Kickstarter Campaign and buy the rights off of them. So the Fans can give Metroid the Treatment it deserves?
Metroid,3a231g,PrimeSamus,-1,Tue Jun 16 18:53:06 2015 UTC,At this rate...I can't deny that. We can probably donate as much and get a Japanese lawyer to help us.

Metroid,3a47q2,icemario10,3,Wed Jun 17 02:35:51 2015 UTC,"I am fine with it being part of the Metroid series.  The hate is coming from the fact that after a 5 year wait from the last entry, Other M which was not received that well, turned out to be a spinoff.  Not only was it a Spinoff but a cartoonish and lighthearted style with vastly different gameplay focus and was thrown into the E3 direct as an afterthought it seemed.  We should wait a few days for people to calm down and view it then."
Metroid,3a47q2,wreckingcanon,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:19:59 2015 UTC,Me. I honestly think Blast Ball could've been the F-Zero of competitive arena shooters. But with soccer!
Metroid,3a47q2,InsanityRaptor,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:17:36 2015 UTC,"I want more games exploring the verse, stuff that’s happening without Samus being directly involved. Putting such a thing into this tiny 3DS thing isn’t the right way to go about it."
Metroid,3a2afs,Wind123,10,Tue Jun 16 17:50:11 2015 UTC,"I'm just as disappointed as everyone else, but think of it this way. Zelda WiiU is coming after a 5-year gap of no mainline Zelda console games, during which Nintendo is releasing ports, remakes and spinoffs with Wind Waker HD, Hyrule Warriors, and now Triforce Heroes and Hyrule Warriors Legends. I doubt that Nintendo thinks Federation Force and Blast Ball are the future of the Metroid series. This is probably a holding pattern so we have something to do while Metroid WiiU is in development.  If the eventual Metroid game for WiiU ends up being a lot better because of the added development time, then I don't mind having spinoffs in the meantime. It'd be nice to hear official word, though. Zelda U's development cycle gets a lot of press to reassure people that it's still going strong. Metroid news is mostly grasping at straws in comparison."
Metroid,3a2afs,breakmanblues,3,Tue Jun 16 18:23:58 2015 UTC,"As for your Zelda point, we got a new Zelda game last year (A Link Between Worlds) and it was critically acclaimed as the best Zelda game in a long time. I personally didn't really like it that much, but that doesn't mean it doesn't count."
Metroid,3a2afs,Jammintk,2,Tue Jun 16 21:16:31 2015 UTC,He is only counting the 3D zelda's for some reason.
Metroid,3a2afs,henryuuk,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:59:33 2015 UTC,"I was only counting the mainline console Zelda games, which are usually the ones that generate the most publicity/E3 hype (and sometimes the most sales but not always). I know Link Between Worlds was the GOTY for a lot of people, but the general public tends to see console games as the ""main event"" and handhelds as just something on the side. Not a viewpoint I agree with necessarily, but it's a viewpoint I'm accounting for."
Metroid,3a2afs,breakmanblues,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:55:58 2015 UTC,they even said they were doing something with 2d and 3d metroid. the wii u will get a metroid. every console has had a metroid (except n64). next year will be when we get this generation's console metroid.
Metroid,3a2afs,marioman63,13,Tue Jun 16 20:10:55 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it will be fun. Other M still had fun gameplay, for all it's faults. Wind Waker was still a great game despite the backlash because of it's graphics.  It's that Nintendo are being so shortsighted. The fact they this game tells us that they really missed the mark of what made Other M so bad and what made Prime so good.   For starters. Prime is about exploration, not just shooty-shooty. You're not going to get that on a 3DS. Not only that, FPS never play well on handhelds. The fact that they keep trying, on a handheld without a dual analog stick.  Then there are the graphics. It's clear to me that this is a side project. This is something Nintendo just slapped the Metroid name on to appease people, but they didn't even put a budget to the damn thing because they have no faith in it selling well, because it's both an FPS, and a Metroid game on a handheld.   God, I'd rather there be no Metroid game, than to be saddled with this mess."
Metroid,3a2afs,Dubiono,3,Tue Jun 16 18:08:45 2015 UTC,sure it will be fun  rather there be no metroid game
Metroid,3a2afs,henchred,6,Tue Jun 16 19:31:36 2015 UTC,"Because it's still a slap in the face. Sometimes, I'm willing to sacrifice a good time to be rid of a brand damaging game like this. Other M was fun, but I'd gladly erase it from the world if I could for what it's done to the reputation of Metroid."
Metroid,3a2afs,Dubiono,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:35:35 2015 UTC,"Im sure they wont forget about metroid. I mean look shit like four swords. Same sort of thing, it may have been different but it didnt jeopardise the whole franchise because of 1 different game in the series."
Metroid,3a2afs,henchred,2,Tue Jun 16 19:42:24 2015 UTC,"4 Swords didn't follow an utter failure. While Wind Waker was controversial, it sold well regardless, and was praised. Other M was not praised, it was detested. It was one of the few Nintendo games in recent memory to ever actually go down in price, or into bargain bins.   Sometimes there are just games that come out at the wrong time. If this followed a proper good Metroid game, this rage would not exist."
Metroid,3a2afs,Dubiono,3,Tue Jun 16 19:45:36 2015 UTC,4 swords was also not a stand alone game. It was included with the alttp gameboy advance port
Metroid,3a2afs,henryuuk,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:58:44 2015 UTC,"He's referring to Four Swords Adventures. Whenever people talk about a standalone FS, that's the one they refer to."
Metroid,3a2afs,Dubiono,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:19:28 2015 UTC,Well four swords adventures was also given a chance as we already had precedent of the spin off (and the zelda fanbase is much to busy with the zelda cycle to really start fearing the end of the series every time they do something 'different')
Metroid,3a2afs,henryuuk,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:24:29 2015 UTC,"Yes it was? I mean, Four Swords Adventures came and went without much fanfare, and it really didn't follow a failure. I'm not sure where you're going with this."
Metroid,3a2afs,Dubiono,2,Tue Jun 16 22:29:39 2015 UTC,it came and went without much fanfare because of how hard it was to set up to play 'right' but it is considered a very good game by the fanbase. And a lot of people are really looking forward to 'three sword' soon

Metroid,3a2afs,henryuuk,2,Tue Jun 16 22:25:43 2015 UTC,"Prime is about exploration,   this isnt the first time the name is used in other ways. there is pinball and hunters. this new game is basically hunters in style"
Metroid,3a2afs,marioman63,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:09:14 2015 UTC,"Pinball is that weird game that people forget.   Hunters came out, just before Corruption right? At the time it's hard not to think it wasn't indicative of anything. Yet. Looking back, it makes sense."
Metroid,3a2afs,Dubiono,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:22:16 2015 UTC,"i dont get the hate for FF, since its hunters sans samus. if the lack of samus is the only problem, thats really hypocritical, because other M is a game hated by most of the community, yet you play as samus. it means people care less about the gameplay, and more about who is in it."
Metroid,3a2afs,marioman63,4,Tue Jun 30 04:18:41 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling that Nintendo listens to its fans, but draws completely the wrong conclusion.   If it's any consolation, they do that for all of their series."

Metroid,3a2afs,synthieval,2,Tue Jun 16 19:11:14 2015 UTC,He's referring to Other M
Metroid,3a2afs,Ryuutakeshi,4,Tue Jun 16 19:59:08 2015 UTC,"Even then, Fusion had good storytelling, and Samus' characterization made total sense."
Metroid,3a2afs,Jammintk,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:14:04 2015 UTC,"...not Fusion with a recolour.    Um, I don't know what you have against fusion's story, but while the overall plot may be similar, Samus was a strong and stoic character in fusion, mature and battle-hardened. Her character in Other M was not, and that was the main problem. Fusion actually did more than any previous game to establish the Samus we know and love today"
Metroid,3a2afs,SeanRK1994,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:05:29 2015 UTC,"I've got nothing against Fusion's story. It was great! Fusion was one of the best games of my childhood.  It's just that Other M is Fusion's story repeated, as you said. When I said ""recolour"" I was figuratively refering to this.   Honestly I wish the Metroid series could be more dynamic and original in terms of the story, and more conservative when it came to the gameplay, but Nintendo seems to be generally terrible when it comes to crafting consistent timelines."
Metroid,3a2afs,SeanRK1994,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:36:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm with you on the timelines thing. I agree about the gameplay as well. Give me the same game with better graphics, a different map and environment, and a few new or changed mechanics, with an original story and consistent but growing characters. Is that too much to ask for?"
Metroid,3a2afs,jnb64,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:45:27 2015 UTC,"The game is going to be awesome. A 3DS co-op mission-based shooter? Yes and yes. The fact that it's skinned as Metroid may kill it in the water, since Metroid fans are so desperate for a new sidescrolling Metroid and view anything other than that as cancer."
Metroid,3a3zk8,NameBrandSnacks,2,Wed Jun 17 01:25:42 2015 UTC,"It probably would have. It would have gotten a few groans, but not the seething vitriol that this Chibi style has."
Metroid,3a3zk8,Dubiono,2,Wed Jun 17 01:30:24 2015 UTC,It'd at least look like a metroid game. I have no problem with the concept- the execution is weak and childish.
Metroid,3a3zk8,The_M4G,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:56:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think it can be saved. I don't mind the Chibi style per se (see Father Hunt) but the ""Capture the Ice Beast"" mission looked stupid, and the Treehouse people made the video even worse. Originally I was hoping for Metroid: Republic Commando. After seeing the gameplay, I'm basically expecting Nintendoland: Metroid Edition."
Metroid,3a3zk8,Akran_Trancilon,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:15:59 2015 UTC,It would be a step in the right direction IMO
Metroid,3a4v6g,FlamingJade,5,Wed Jun 17 06:20:59 2015 UTC,The game actually looks pretty interesting.  If it was a Metroid Prime game for the 3DS I think I would be pretty happy with it. - We'll see what we get.
Metroid,3a4v6g,kupovi,4,Wed Jun 17 06:28:20 2015 UTC,"Indeed. I was actually excited at the fact that Nintendo is finally going back to Metroid, so the backlash I saw from fans really got me a little upset. Like I said, we have a tiny fragment of info, and we're tearing away at it and acting like it's horrible, when all we really know is.   We have a new Metroid Prime game. It's on 3DS. It has multiplayer, hunting creatures and soccer.   And that's it. Can we really say that the game is going to be bad this early on?"
Metroid,3a4v6g,kupovi,2,Wed Jun 17 06:31:43 2015 UTC,"Yep. If people actually watched the trailer (and didn't worry about what every one else was thinking). You'd see that there may be some potential in this game. Video 1 Video 2  Its all early in development, but I'm interested in the multiplayer aspect of the game. Most Metroid games are very straight-forward (Samus, alone, on a planet, fighting aliens/pirates)  But this game introduces other characters in the mix; and that element allows Nintendo much more flexibility. The standard trope of Samus isolated and alone is one that may be too tough to depart from. But if they were able to manage it, I'd give the franchise alot more opportunities to grow.  It'd be easy to make a HD clone of Metroid Prime on the Wii U, or even a 2D Metroid title on the 3DS; they may be trying to create something more unique. - And I'm okay with this.  EDIT - Added video"
Metroid,3a4v6g,Pureownege75,2,Wed Jun 17 06:39:03 2015 UTC,"A couple other things I've noticed. There have been very few times Metroid has had multiplayer.   The newest game. Prime Hunters, it introduced new characters, and people liked it. Prime 2. It was just Samus in different colors. Eh.   Along with that, people keep mentioning their ""Chibi"" look, and yet that's just their armor by the looks of it. You can't tell me Samus REALLY looks normal with those ridiculous shoulder pads on her armor."
Metroid,3a4v6g,Pureownege75,0,Wed Jun 17 06:44:10 2015 UTC,"Not a bad game. A bad Metroid game. Took pretty much every defining feature from the series and threw it out the window. It may end up as a good game, but this is no Metroid game"
Metroid,3a4v6g,Pureownege75,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:04:47 2015 UTC,"Err, all I really seem to see in that aspect is no Samus, and multiple people, and like I've said, that's just the multiplayer. Let's wait a little bit before claiming it isn't even a Metroid game."

The last Metroid game damaged the franchise so a spinoff should not be the priority right now. No one wants to play as galactic federation solders! They suck, they are incompetent, and the whole galactic federation are the morons that basically cause both Fusion and Other M to happen in the first place. So I don't see any desire to play as these morons.   If say Metroid still had games and this was coming along with an actual Metroid game it might have been fine. But after so long and this is what you slap the Metroid logo with? Of course no ones going to like it."
Metroid,3a3ybg,rexshen,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:31:09 2015 UTC,"The game is unpolished at this point. It might not turn out great. It has some potential to be a lot of fun, but it won't be the atypical Metroid game others are clamoring for.  I personally want games in the Metroid universe where you don't play Samus. Not saying FF is hitting that nail on the head."
Metroid,3a3ybg,atbigelow,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:09:18 2015 UTC,"For one thing, it looks like it takes everything the series is known for(isolation, exploration, etc) and throws it away in favor of a generic multiplayer shooter. Combine with it being 5 years since the last sign of life from the series(even longer if you want to go back to the last well received game) and a lot of people are upset this is all they're getting."

Metroid,3a2m3f,beestrom,8,Tue Jun 16 19:09:48 2015 UTC,Despite the fact that I am very disappointed with this being the only Metroid title announced at E3 so far.... The game actually looks really fun. Seeing the 4 people playing it and all the different weapons and enemies so far it looks pretty fun.
Metroid,3a2m3f,Tigeryak729,2,Tue Jun 16 19:28:08 2015 UTC,"I'm happy to see a positive response, everyone in this sub seems really upset about the news, but i think it definitely looks like it could be fun with some buds. Nice to see a shooter on the 3DS too, especially when its not call of duty"
Metroid,3a2m3f,Tigeryak729,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:40:31 2015 UTC,"The more I watch the Treehouse footage of the games the less angry I am with them not announcing games I wanted. Like some others said, they will probably hold off on new Metroid until NX at this point. So E3 2016 should be good!"
Metroid,3a2m3f,hamster_of_justice,5,Tue Jun 16 20:19:06 2015 UTC,After I calmed down I have to say... Doesn't look that bad actually. Looks like a fun multiplayer game. Hopefully it's just to hold us over for the big thing with Samus next year...

Metroid,3a4yg2,SSGuy24,2,Sun Jun 21 01:03:11 2015 UTC,"The reasons why are literally everywhere.  Briefly: It's a generic handheld co-op FPS with bad graphics and an uninteresting art style being peddled as a Metroid game when it is anything but, 5 years after the pile of mediocrity that was Other M. But at least it comes with soccer.  Maybe the game play is solid, maybe some people will enjoy it. I will not be one of those people. And calling this cutesy generic sci-fi co-op FPS a Metroid game is a slap in the face to people who enjoyed, and want more of, games like the previous entries in the series.  It's pretty silly to pretend that everyone disappointed in Federation Force wants to murder every Nintendo employee. The people who are legitimately angry because of this game need help for their emotional problems."

Hence the pre-teen freakouts.  My guess is that in 5 years from now, people will play this game and see that it's actually pretty solid. - But nobody will likely give it a chance now; because it isn't ""whats expected""."

It's a real shame that Metroid's gonna be gone for a while, but at least it seems like there's people in Nintendo that are interested in more traditional Metroid ideas. I love what Tanabe had to say about his Prime 4 concepts. But Metroid just isn't a big financial cash source for Nintendo. I was pissed at first, I made my bitchy remarks, but at the end of the day, it's still something, and with Next Level behind it, it'll probably even be fun.  But it just isn't the Metroid I or other fans want. :/"

Metroid,3a2el8,CKZeni,3,Tue Jun 16 18:18:39 2015 UTC,ive been so literally depressed. this announcement really crushed my hopes for metroid. im currently lets playing metroid prime and i might play super metroid at some point today. so atleast i can take my mind off of this.

I'm talking about capital, man power, server space/bandwidth, TIME. is being wasted on what we all feel is going to be a giant, forgettable, fart. These resources should be prioritized on Dread."
Metroid,3a3fgo,baxtermcsnuggle,0,Wed Jun 17 20:53:36 2015 UTC,"But Nintendo isn't making FF. Next Level Games is. Nintendo isn't wasting resources on FF, Next Level is. It's not as if Nintendo or Next Level Games would be making Dread if they weren't making FF."
Metroid,3a3fgo,baxtermcsnuggle,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:19:59 2015 UTC,"Nintendo doesn't have clean hands. They are at the root of everything because they are approving the pitches, signing the checks and adding their input. Thats the double edge of their strict approval system. They know that because of licensing system, it meets their approval and reflects on them. This cutesy smack at Yokoi-sans legacy is nintendo's mistake. They have more stake/reponsibility in this than you say."
Metroid,3a3fgo,baxtermcsnuggle,0,Sat Jun 20 17:24:31 2015 UTC,"No, no, no, you're misunderstanding. You said that Nintendo was taking manpower away from a potential sidescrolling Metroid to put it towards FF. That's simply and unarguably not true. Yes, they're responsible, I never said they weren't. I said Nintendo isn't not making a sidescrolling Metroid in favor of making FF. FF is being produced by an entirely separate studio, and entirely separate group of human beings who wouldn't be making a sidescrolling Metroid under any circumstances whatsoever.  And you're the one smacking Yokoi by presuming to know what he would and wouldn't approve of. Who the fuck are you? Did you know him? Were you related? Are you his reincarnation? Then don't try to score points during your puerile whinefest by invoking the name of a man you know nothing about outside the one game he made that you like.  I really, truly hope you eventually see what a miserable little person you're being right now."
Metroid,3a3fgo,Mr_Tuesday1,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:27:27 2015 UTC,"You wanna talk miserable little people? You should know, you're the grand galactic emperror of miserable little people. Picking a fight based with a perfectly valid opinion likely because everyone seems to be on the ""i dont like this"" bandwagon is as petty as it gets. I pointed out that this is taking all manner of resource. Granted some resources are less than others but the fact remains that the metroid franchise is too weak to make these cheesy side projects the first thing they mention in five years. The licensing and approval process does use manpower as well as money, and means more than you want to give credit for. Gunpei Yokoi built a thrilling, unnerving, exploration based obsession. Amongst other treasures from my youth. The only offense you could have regarding his legacy is if YOU are related to him which i understandably doubt. You wanna argue out of rebellion? Take it back to highschool, puppy. If the public opinion can prevent another unwanted game from saturating the market... it doesn't matter much anyway because nintendo will approve something else that i, as a core gamer, wont care about."

I find it strange that one Chozo stayed behind while the others fled zebes. In ch 6, the hologram message said all the Chozo left. It isn't entirely clear whether the Chozo that stayed behind with mother brain is malicious or not. After the pirate attack, mother brain could have been modified by the pirates already and deceived the loyal chozo. Or more realistically, the loyal chozo would have been killed by the pirates immediately and made a clone out of it to trick Samus. All speculation."
Metroid,39yoh8,metroidman388,3,Tue Jun 16 01:51:10 2015 UTC,"That kotaku article has a ton of fan theory and speculation riddled throughout, with no clear delineation between cannon and embellishment unless you've already experienced the source material."
Metroid,39yoh8,Sno_Wolf,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:55:58 2015 UTC,"To be specific, it's not a kotaku article. Kotaku just copied+pasted the story from neogaf. I just grabbed the link because it was the first result on google. I'm only using it as reference to the Mother Brain part, of which a majority is cited from MP1."
Metroid,39yoh8,mutually_awkward,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:13:30 2015 UTC,"a majority is cited from MP1   That ties back to my point:  MP1 never mentioned Mother Brain anywhere - it was presumably out of commission and still being rebuilt during that time.  The article adds tons of embellishments and speculation everywhere to the point where it's equal parts cannon and fan-fiction.  The article is well written and interesting, but presents itself as fact, and many in turn come to believe that it is all 100% cannon when it is far from that.  I understand the appeal of trying to unify the storyline of the various games and fill in plot holes, but it does so at the cost of altering what little (and good) story we have."

Metroid,39xmrl,DrDongStrong,2,Tue Jun 16 00:44:47 2015 UTC,Armature is made up of former retro employees. I wish they revealed more information about those employees. Because I have no idea what their part in Metroid games were.
Metroid,39xmrl,NewComer22,5,Mon Jun 15 17:42:10 2015 UTC,Its for example the former director of all 3 prime games. But after he leaves Retro to make Batman games he said this: http://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-trilogy-director-everything-we-do-sucks/1100-6407324/  Im not sure what i should think now.
Metroid,39xmrl,DrDongStrong,3,Mon Jun 15 18:22:26 2015 UTC,Oh shit I remember this guy. He said he was very disappointed with the Prime ganes or something. I know as a creator of something you can see all the flaws but he was very harsh about it. Speaking of Armatures library I don't see anything truly amazing here. They look like ports or editions of games by other people. Let's hope ReCore changes that.

There's going to be some form of Metroid at E3. The reaction of Super Metroid at the Nintendo World Championships was so good. They know we want it.

For example, a prequel to Metroid II where they discover that a phazon Leviathan hit the metroid home planet, SR388 thousands of years ago. It has help the X Virus evolve and recently affected the Metroids, causing all the variations seen in Metroid II. They could have then spread to other planets, where Samus must hunt them down before tackling the source in Metroid II. Something like that.  Err, I mean, obligatory complaint about Other M."

Metroid,39lquu,sjminervino,3,Fri Jun 12 17:12:41 2015 UTC,"This looks like something I need to buy. For real.   Now, as an animator, I've got a few critiques. The animation generally looks good, but you've definitely got some float going on in your walk cycles, you'll need to adjust your speed and possibly makes some tweeks to the animation to get it to feel more solid. I think that solidity should be a priority in this game to really bump up the immersion. You should be able to feel the weight of everything, like jumps, grabbing a ladder, firing a gun, all these things need weight, or they feel very fake. The enemies should also have significant reactions to things like getting shot. They could become angry, afraid, or put up protection. But mostly they need some kind of kinetic reaction to getting hit by things. I also agree with /u/jaggedbrace on the gun noise, it needs a little more oomph.  Let me know if you need me to clarify anything, I'm going to watch your video again and think about how much I want to play it."
Metroid,39lquu,GoldenBoy25,2,Fri Jun 12 21:52:15 2015 UTC,"That looks really cool dude.  You're doing great work, thanks for sharing!"
Metroid,39lquu,Kipstopher,2,Fri Jun 12 17:18:22 2015 UTC,"This looks great! I like the visuals and the lighting. It seems like the flashlight will be a necessary tool, and I hope it is. I would like to feel resourceful in a game like this, especially as you pick up more tech, like the jet/jump-pack. I'd be excited to see what else gets added! And now a question, do you lose accuracy or take some kind of penalty from firing backwards? (Which is a cool animation, by the way) Now this might seem nit-picky but I think it'd be cool if a slow backwards motion kept you facing forward while doing a slow backpedal while keeping a stable weapon for firing, while a quick backward motion would be a running retreat with a penalty to backward firing. That was just a thought I had while watching the demo and thought it would be a cool detail to see, as a gamer. Otherwise, this looks awesome. What appeals to me most is the exploring new terrain and the need for new tech which you discover on the journey; always looking forward to what the next ability will be and where it will take you. Keep those things in mind and you'll attract the Metroid crowd for sure."
Metroid,39lquu,dispo916,2,Fri Jun 12 17:20:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for the feedback and ideias! This is exactly the kind of thing I need right now, and you helped me a lot. I'll see what I can do about the penalty for shooting back. There's a huge difference on accuracy if you shoot while running compared to stopping to shoot, but for now there's no penalty for aiming back. Reading your post, I was thinking about reducing the speed movement while aiming back - that would be interesting and make sense in my opinion. It would also improve the combat in a way that is harder for the player to just turn around and run away while shooting. Thanks again!"

Metroid,39lquu,GlamazonAesa,2,Fri Jun 12 22:43:40 2015 UTC,My only critiques are that I think it could use either inverse kinematics or some animation blending for moving up/down ramps & stairs. Turning around also seemed oddly quick.

Metroid,39fvj5,henryuuk,2,Thu Jun 11 19:50:44 2015 UTC,Well you can still use the charge versions when in the opposite worlds. This would work well when combined with sense move in other M.
Metroid,39fvj5,gamerzap,3,Thu Jun 11 19:55:46 2015 UTC,"That doesn't mean anything though... ... ... AFTER prime 2, samus leaves the place that has all the light/dark energy hovering around (and the thing that caused said energy had been 'solved'). So even with the beams still there, there would be no way of refilling them with the right energy. It would be like if Samus got a revolver from IRL Earth, and then never had any contact (direct or indirect) with IRLhumans anymore, nor would her reality be able to make more bullets. She'd have the gun 'forever', but if she uses it, she is gonna run out of bullets eventually, making the gun useless."
Metroid,39fvj5,gamerzap,2,Thu Jun 11 20:09:08 2015 UTC,"What I always assumed is that all creatures have light and dark energy in them, and using one of the beams on them destroys the same type that is being used but leaves the other and makes it more usable by Samus, which is why shooting an enemy with Light beam gives Dark energy and vice versa."
Metroid,39fvj5,Alsenis,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:17:28 2015 UTC,That might be what is happening ON AETHER. but we have no reason to assume light/dark energy is present anywhere else.
Metroid,39fvj5,Anggul,0,Thu Jun 11 21:35:15 2015 UTC,"We also have no reason to assume it's not... Aether split into two, so the same could happen to another planet. But even before it happens who is to say the creatures don't still have that energy? The whole point of my theory was to say that maybe there could be another Metroid game where we get to use those beams."
Metroid,39fvj5,citizenofgaia,0,Thu Jun 11 22:06:10 2015 UTC,"Here is the reason to assume not so : we haven't seen it anywhere else, and the only place we saw those energies, was a planet that was split into dimension counterparts.    if that were to happen in the same way to a different planet, I'm sure that planet would also start having that energy appear. But until then, it is unknown how to obtain said energy/where to get it.    And I STRONGLY doubt they will make another game based on the light/dark world mechanic."
Metroid,39fvj5,Rootayable,0,Thu Jun 11 22:20:20 2015 UTC,I just assume it happened anyways but her visor didn't identify it. Just because we have never seen it doesn't mean it can't happen.
Metroid,39fvj5,TacticalFluke,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:31:44 2015 UTC,"You can visibly see the beam pullin in energy from the environment when it is charging, it would make sense that that wouldn't work outside of Aether if the same energy isn't present."
Metroid,39fvj5,Rootayable,0,Fri Jun 12 09:25:43 2015 UTC,Honestly that looks more like it is emanating energy rather than absorbing it.

Metroid,39fvj5,Rootayable,3,Fri Jun 12 19:50:12 2015 UTC,"We all know that she gets rid of any and all upgrades for Plot convenience, but beyond that here's how I saw it. Samus collects all these various upgrades for her suit and beams and whatnot that end up being helpful for that mission. There's no guarantee that she can make use of all these in the next so they could end up being dead weight which I imagine can't be good for a bounty hunter who needs to be on the move 24/7.   Yeah she has a mini factory on the ship for ammunition, but in the first two Prime games, there aren't a lot of times the ship is conveniently close by. In my 4 run-throughs of Echoes, I think I've only ever used the ship l it ke 3 times.   At the end of Corruption, we see all the Phazon removed from existence (I think?) or something along those lines. Thus the PED suit is rendered obsolete. As for the beams, I can only imagine that since she was working with the Galactic Federation, she gave her Nova Beam to them to study. Who knows really though."

Also, it might mean that there are intergalactic laws that forbid bounty hunters from having unregistered or unlicensed firearms, meaning she uses them illegally on the lonely planets that she finds them, most likely discarding them when she leaves.  Just a thought, I suppose."

Metroid,39fvj5,xwatchmanx,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:05:14 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of the unregistered armaments being illegal, but unfortunately, Other M contradicts this a little bit and nothing yet says that other M isn't canon other than wishful thinking from the fanbase.  I can forgive Fusion because she was on a mission with the GF at the time and probably got rearmed in that particular trip to SR388."
Metroid,39fvj5,malicious-monkey,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:31:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Other M ruins everything. Maybe it's something along those lines, though. Like, maybe it's not exactly those stipulations for carrying weapons, but something loosely like it.

I play for the story as much as for the gameplay and the competitive multiplayer.   Never really cared much for the gameplay of the series.    Even if you don't care for the gameplay. I would highly recommend checking out the HuntTheTruth podcast. It's a really incredible part of the ARG that Halo 5 has going on right now.  https://soundcloud.com/huntthetruth  It delves a lot into the Halo lore but in a way anyone can understand. The stories twists and turns are fantastic. And it's got some big talent there like Jennifer Hale (voice Samus in Metroid Prime!), Troy Baker, and even Keegan-Michael Key. The fact that this podcast made many people in real life question the Spartan Program and even the Master Chief speaks volumes.  It's a great listen even if you aren't a fan of Halo.

I may check out more of the series for Jennifer Hale alone, she's an absolutely phenomenal voice actor. Her work on the Mass Effect series is so balls to the wall amazing that I think I only ever completed one run with the male version of Shepard.  I never did manage to follow Halo very far, call me a ""bratty 90's kid"" but growing up on titles like DOOM and Duke Nukem 3D my mind just feels incompatible with the modern military shooter. A genre where you spent a lot of time taking cover behind various boxes, when all my childhood years have pumped me up for the runny shooty rocket jumpy action.  One question tough, I heard Halo: Reach was supposed to be the final installment. What happened with that?"
Metroid,39b4np,TheNerdyOne_,4,Wed Jun 10 19:14:11 2015 UTC,"Halo is much more similar to the runny shooty rocket jumpy action you describe.  There is no cover system, you rarely even need to take cover until you get to the higher difficulties.  But I personally prefer the story much more than the gameplay, though I like both.  The universe is very rich.  Reach was the last installment under the original developers, Bungie.  Microsoft then made 343 Industries to continue making games."

Metroid,3938i7,TheJediCounsel,9,Mon Jun 8 22:57:52 2015 UTC,"Speaking from a casual playing experience and not from a speed running technique perspective:  I think the part about Ridley that seems so counter intuitive is that you have to spam your missiles into him.   To compare to the Kraid fight, where you're avoiding projectiles and platforming around whereby a single missile to the mouth is typically all you get.... Ridley pretty much requires you to abuse situations where he's less mobile and just pepper him with your payload.  As someone who plays relatively conservatively and tries to avoid using all of my expendables/consumables on a single fight it seemed so... odd... at first."

Metroid,3938i7,BadgerDentist,4,Tue Jun 9 05:11:40 2015 UTC,"they did a great job of making you feel like god at the end when you can just hold R and hyper beam the last boss down   It's the most satisfying moment in Clinton-era gaming. You spend the entire game trying to get the baby metroid. After a huge struggle with Mother Brain the metroid saves you from certain death and attacks her. Then that asshole Mother Brain kills it. Dozens of playthroughs and I still sort of feel angry when this happens, then gleeful about the screech MB makes when you actually start seriously hurting her."
Metroid,3938i7,picopicochu,2,Tue Jun 9 05:24:56 2015 UTC,"It was amazing. I honestly did feel something once the metroid exploded, even though I had just seen it for the first time like 6 minutes earlier. And it sucked out like 7 energy tanks. I don't know my favorite Clinton era gaming feeling was either the first time I ran around bob-bomb battlefield or jumping Epona over that fence.

Metroid,38zale,Grotteland,21,Mon Jun 8 03:23:23 2015 UTC,This is a fantastic theory and I absolutely love it. I only have one issue with it; why would Nintendo produce a game with a giant plot twist and never bother to reveal it? The only way I see this being plausible is if Nintendo tries to use it as a scapegoat for the numerous inconsistencies in the game.

So Samus's breakdown seeing Ridley isn't unjust in that this is only her third time seeing him and she had just gotten closure after seeing him die for absolutely sure in Super (and not fueled by the rage of revenge as she was the last two times)  My only nitpick with this theory is no.6 because Samus's suit has this special property where even the non biological parts are generated from the biological parts, including the plating, missille and bombs (given that she can regenerate them from purely biological X)  Also not really a problem with your theory, but the X are shown to be intelligent, maybe when they are cut from Samus they ignore the Scientists and bide their time in the suit waiting for their trip to BSL and the potential for more hosts. And I just realized none of the Chozo based upgrades (other than the Varia Suit, and even then just its heat shielding) were supplied by the Federation, they only sent the artillery upgrades, ie missiles, bombs, ice missiles, and power bombs, they said they had a plasma upgrade ready but never sent it (Anthony has a Plasma beam in Other M, so thats believable) but every beam, every morph, every movement upgrade are obtained from Core X (all who started from the ones in Samus at the beginning) meaning even if the scientists who saved her life had been infected, it wasn't necessarily them who had been sending upgrades being that all the upgrades are pretty standard issue artillery for any GF outfit."
Metroid,38zale,DanielisAwesome52,2,Mon Jun 8 12:31:53 2015 UTC,"But we also saw the same explosion happen to Ridley in Zero Mission, so she likely thought that THAT was the last Ridley. Also if the manga is canon, which it is according to other M, then she had already killed Ridley even once before that."
Metroid,38zale,Alorha,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:50:57 2015 UTC,"on the prime games, how long did it take you to finish them? it took me 25-30 hours for prime 1, so doesn't it make sense that it took samus that long as well? you ARE playing as her, after all. it doesn't have any sort of story cutscenes or anything to indicate how long you were actually on tallon 5, so the logical assumption is that the mission there is as long as it takes the player to finish the game."
Metroid,38zale,TheFullMonty1394,2,Mon Jun 8 17:07:01 2015 UTC,"I don't see that as the logical assumption, it takes me an hour or less to beat Super Metroid, but there was still a few years in the timeline between the destruction of Zebes and the events of Fusion  I think the logical assumption is because its a video game, and not a second to second retelling of the adventure your playtime does in no way reflect the actual timespan. I mean just look at how often you fly between planets in Prime 3, even if you assume the warp drive is instantaneous (which it almost never actually is in sci-fi) theres a jump cut between leaving the launchpad and exiting the atmosphere, that obviously takes alot of time  Also I don't believe its physically possible for Samus, as boosted by Chozo blood as she is to move and fight for one solid block like it would be assumed if you used just your playtime as the timer. Now whether that implies the saves are stasis pods for some undesignated time of rest, or if the game just ignores her resting in her living quarters in her ship or something ala Pokemon or any RPG type game does that doesn't particularly matter.  Don't get me wrong I love the Prime games, but to jam all three of those missions into a single year or so between her ridding Zebes of Space Pirates and then her ridding SR388 of Metroids, I don't feel its possible purely based on the amount of space travel involved between the three games.  Also considering the cop-out deus ex machina thing that happens when you destroy Phaaze, seemingly explaining why Fusion despite being developed at the same time as Prime, and taking place like four years after doesn't even mention Phazon, the tech developed (in what was supposed to be a year, really? this highly dangerous material, condensed and made safe-ish to use as a weapon, in a year? Despite the wisest race in the galaxy, who developed a Suit so advanced even in a decade of the GF's experience with it they could barely replicate some of its basic functions? being totally wiped from the planet by it? Really?) just kinda irks me. Like that ending detail is what drives the whole ""these games aren't part of the main canon"" thing home for me, because thats essentially the Prime's series version of Mario waking up at the end of Super Mario Bros 2"
Metroid,38zale,Alorha,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:14:16 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, while the gameplay wasn't terrible in Other M, the story was utter trash.  Not the worst thing to grace a game, but shit overall.  Full of plotholes, unresolved strings, denial of agency.  It's shitty fanfic level quality."
Metroid,38zale,LordCharco_iii,2,Mon Jun 8 17:56:33 2015 UTC,"That's the thing alot of those plotholes, weird dialogue choices etc seemed to stem from a lack of a good translation, Ima sound like a weeb but I do enjoy watching Anime in Japanese over English I could sort of tell that Samus' inflections and choice of words didn't really match the feel of the Japanese (I can only go off the provided Japanese subtitle and I believe a fan video series I watched before the game came out for the US for the actual translation though)  But I've been seeing alot of things talking about how Samus' is portrayed in Japan/to the Japanese people, and alot of things like how it seemed odd and over the top ""make her super feminine and motherly"" calling the Hatchling ""The Baby"" is actually hows its been since Metroid 2 for Japan, we lost that in the American translation, so we started calling it the Larvae, the Hatchling, the Super Metroid etc which caused us to lose that whole Mother metaphor thats essentially been building up the whole series. In the US we just flatly attributed the sparing of the Baby as a humane thing to do, a ""for the good of the Galaxy"" when in Japan it has always been because Samus felt like a Mother to it, she didn't dive back into Zebes to save Galactic Civilization, she did it to save her Baby  That also goes towards Adam's portrayal, I think it takes alot of understanding of the average Japanese man (which I don't have, never lived or even visited the country, but I do know everyone says they have a very different way about them due to the culture of Japan) to put Adam's stoicness and seemingly coldness into an understandable perspective. I got the feeling during the English version that Adam didn't give two shits, and that Samus had this almost abusive attachment to him, but I feel like some kind of relationship dynamic a Japanese man would have with maybe his daughter was lost in the movement overseas.   Everything else fit just fine into the Metroid canon, the Metroid breeding itself felt kind of tossed in for the sake of calling it a Metroid game, as did the cold resistance, since apparently even though its their ""one weakness"" massive ship sized explosion can still eradicate them. I didn't mind the Mother Brain clone thing, I felt it wasn't explained very well, because I don't believe the girl was meant to be a direct clone of the Mother Brain from Zebes, but rather an inplication of the telepathic tech or biology Mother Brain had, it is explained I believe in the comics that the original Mother Brain had a telepathic grip on most of the Space Pirates, and the Metroids, and that made the most sense out of the game that the GF would want access to a power like that.  The whole Deleter thing was kind of weird, that felt like one of the devs wanted to make a detective drama but didn't have time away from the Metroid Project so he snuck it into the game for shits and giggles  And lastly I do feel most of the team knew what kind of series they were dealing with, because they took care to provide links to the other games. Like how you fight the Queen Metroid, it was exactly what I felt that fight would be like in 3D, including the addition of the Power Bomb kill. The dried up Ridley corpse and the missing Nightmare body when you revisit the Lab post-credits explainng why both those things were in BSL, even the care taken in the recreation of the final Super Metroid battle, I think that shows at least the Dev team knew they were working on a Metroid game, and maybe the translation team didn't understand that, but the devs did."
Metroid,38zale,Anggul,2,Mon Jun 8 21:40:42 2015 UTC,"I disagree strongly that the devs knew this was a metroid game.  There's too much linearity, moreso than even Fusion.  They threw in fan service, but it's a mishmash, and poorly executed.  Samus doesn't actually deal with any major threat except the queen metorid, which isn't even a story threat until she's slapped in there for the sole reason of ""See, you can fight a metroid!""  MB is taken out by the GF.  Ridley is taken out by other monsters, the Deleter is taken out by... who even knows, once they got bored of that plot they tossed it.  The metroid area is taken out by Adam (so we could take out Ridley... yeah).  At every turn they deny agency and take the point of control out of player's hands.  It's shit game design.  The story isn't good enough to justify the awful gameplay decisions (in terms of gameplay meeting story).  You're right in that it's not the worst thing ever.  But it's deeply flawed, more deeply than I feel you're admitting.  It goes beyond the BS Adam shot in the back, or the varia sequence, or even the awful Ridley bit (jolting the players out of the moment, and achieving nothing story-wise, since someone unfamiliar with the manga has NO FUCKING CLUE why this battle-suited warrior they've been playing is suddenly a useless pile of sobbing).  We deserved better.  Than franchise deserved better.  It's not the worst game out there, but it is unquestioningly the worst Metroid game.  The series would be better if it had never happened."
Metroid,38zale,Elusive2000,2,Tue Jun 9 03:11:14 2015 UTC,"What gets me is they could have justified the breakdown by adding in 2 seconds of flash backs when Samus sees Ridley, or even added one freaking line of dialogue to hint at it early game. I feel like if the game had another year in the oven it would have been the Metroid standard. There is a bunch you can do with a man vs. self conflict and make it resonate."
Metroid,38zale,Anggul,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:19:02 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  I can see elements of I game I would have liked in there.  That actually makes it even worse.  I've said this before: Other M doesn't get hate for being awful; it gets hate for disappointing people who expected better of this series.  People find the Room Hilarious while they hate the Phantom Menace.  It's not because the latter is worse, it's because things are judge based on what we expect them to be.  Other M falls utterly short of the standard fans expect"
Metroid,38zale,Anggul,4,Thu Jun 11 12:27:05 2015 UTC,"I like it. It kinda retcons Other M, without completely ignoring it, and kinda adds to it. Not bad. Not bad at all."
Metroid,38zale,Alorha,2,Mon Jun 8 15:36:36 2015 UTC,"'Submissive to the GF'  If by that you mean 'agrees to go along with their plan because at the time there's absolutely no reason to go against them' then yes. What she did was the reasonable thing to do. She isn't submissive to the GF, she just shares similar goals and helps them. She wasn't going to just say: 'Screw you I'm going to go and blow chunks out of the place and screw your objectives because I can'.  Don't get me wrong Other M had big issues, but that's a commonly mentioned idea that just wasn't one of them."
Metroid,38zale,Anggul,3,Mon Jun 8 13:59:13 2015 UTC,"Agrees to go along with their rather stupid plan... Yeah, she could work with them, but I don't think she would wait until she was almost dead before activating her varia (and even then, only because adam said so), just to stick to a plan."
Metroid,38zale,Alorha,-1,Mon Jun 8 15:20:11 2015 UTC,"That was a daft gameplay mechanic. Realistically she wouldn't actually have it turned off, nor would Adam expect it to be turned off.

You have to believe that the characters are stupid to do it the way they did.  You also lose any sense of acheivement because you don't find or earn anything, your character just flips a switch that was there from the beginning.  The whole Adam/Samus relationship is seriously messed up"
Metroid,38zale,Nibblet420,4,Mon Jun 8 17:59:46 2015 UTC,"I completely agree that it was a stupid way of doing it, at no point did I suggest otherwise.  I'm not saying for a moment that it made sense, what I'm saying is their reason for doing it. It was laziness on their part because they couldn't be bothered with (or perhaps didn't even consider) coming up with a good reason she couldn't progress through that area yet, so they just went: 'Hey it's hot and she hasn't turned on her heat shielding yet which in every game has just been part of the passive functions of the suit!'  It's absolutely nothing to do with the characters Adam or Samus. It's purely gameplay. Silly gameplay, but that's what it is.  The relationship between Adam and Samus is not messed up. People didn't like that Samus was listening to others (i.e being a rational person), least of all a man (because apparently that matters, I bet no-one would have cared if it were a woman), so they started saying nonsense like 'it's an abusive relationship'.  There were various issues with the plot of Other M. Adam treating Samus like any other operative because he wanted to remain professional is not one of them. It made perfect sense, and people really can't cite the infamous 'heat shielding incident' because it isn't anything to do with Adam as a character, it's a quick half-baked justification to stop you from progressing through that zone of the game before you're supposed to.  The squad were on a mission, Samus turned up, their officer asked if she would help and not blow the place up, she agreed because that was the sensible thing to do. There are many plot issues in that game, but this was not one of them. I'm just tired of people always bringing it up with unfounded reasoning.  Want to see what really ruined the storytelling of that game? That painful thumbs-down scene. 'Ooh look at me I'm so rebellious I'm putting my thumb down'. That monologue made me want to bludgeon my ears to mush with the wii remote.  On the other hand, the scene where they had to leave Adam's brother behind was great. It showed Samus when she was younger and more naive, convinced of her ability to do anything because she had grown up being taught that she was amazing. She was and is amazing, but it was really good to see the Samus before the Samus we know, she can't have always been the stoic badass we love. More of the flashbacks should have been about that development, it was interesting, and went some way to showing the ways in which she would have learned her limits while also becoming the hunter we know.  The idea of Other M was a good one. The execution left much to be desired, especially where it was placed in the timeline."
Metroid,38zale,Rootayable,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:17:16 2015 UTC,"The real issue is actually lack of agency.  Samus accomplishes nothing in the entire game.  Every major threat is dealt with by someone or something else.  The story is a giant slap in the face.  And yes, it was a gameplay gimmick, but they chose to mesh the story in with that.  They aren't separable.  The scene with his brother wasn't the worst, but it could have been better.  Really, that's the true tragedy of the game.  There were good elements, but it was all drowning in pretentious shit.  Others have covered why the story is awful in far better detail than I, but the way they chose to present Adam in this story, as opposed to Fusion, is not merely as a CO.  No CO would shoot a soldier in that back (Another awful scene).  This franchise deserved better.  If it was ""Space Shooter Girl has Other People Solve Her Problems"" instead of Metroid, the game would have been forgettable.  It's not the worst thing to grace a console by a long shot, but it is the worst Metroid game, and it didn't have to be."
Metroid,38zale,UberAndrew,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:52:04 2015 UTC,"I agree, they chose to mesh the story with it and it was stupid because it made no sense. I just choose to see that for what it is, a flawed gameplay mechanic separate from the story because it obviously doesn't make sense.  I don't think I can agree on lack of agency. She roams the place, blasting down her enemies as usual. Of course other people do things, that's fair enough. I think the issue is that people are so used to Samus being pretty much the only character and doing absolutely everything, that when suddenly there are other people around who are vaguely competent, they cry 'they're doing everything for her!' Of course there were teething problems, this sort of thing hasn't been done in Metroid before so it was never going to be easy to include the other characters when the main character is such an overpowered badass. I think it's silly to say that she doesn't accomplish anything though. She kills off the major threats, she finds MB, she saves them all when the place starts going berserk at the end, standard fare for Samus.  Like you say, everything could be better. Pretentious shit is definitely the name of the game, and clutters up what could have been such a good storyline. As I said, that 'thumbs down' scene was probably the worst part for me, and 'pretentious shit' nails down exactly why.  The 'shooting in the back' scene was bad for one main reason in my eyes: The way in which she tells him not to go. All screaming and wailing. In the past she might have reacted that way, when she was young and overly emotive. By this point though, she's past all that. It would have been fitting if she had demanded that he stay clearly and calmly, but evidently holding back emotions that she hasn't felt much of in many years. Much like how Adam is portrayed, obviously wanting to show emotion for someone they care about but holding it in for the sake of professionalism. It would have showed how she wasn't completely soulless by this point, but wasn't going to break down like she might have in the past. Her voice could have become more and more insistent as he walked away, never quite breaking like it seems to immediately in the actual scene, but clearly worried to some extent that one of the only humans she had ever had some kind of relationship with was going to blow himself up in the same way he had to let his brother die, all to kill off a nest of the creatures she thought she had put an end to, but the government of the people she had fought to protect had foolishly decided to replicate.  Past that, sodding hell, a shot in the back disabled her suit? I'm pretty sure that suit has taken worse surprise attacks and kept on going. He could have erected some kind of energy field that would hold up against her attacks long enough for him to get through the doors, but no apparently he had some kind of super-chozo-bullets. I don't question why he shot the suit, he obviously knew it wouldn't harm her and just wanted to disable the suit so she couldn't stop him. I question why shooting the suit disabled it at all and why they couldn't have just used a different way of holding her back. It's much like the heat shielding thing. Lazy writing, when it wouldn't have been hard to come up with a good way of doing it. Metroid has always held things back with doors and energy fields, it would, if anything, have been a pretty funny in-joke if he had erected an energy field to stop her from stopping him. She could have battered on the shielding with her full arsenal, and it could have given in and failed just too late for her to grab him and pull him out from the closing doors. She could then have found her true resolve in this place after he had vanished from sight, gritting her teeth and refusing to let the greatest bounty hunter in the galaxy be laid low by an ungrateful, foolish government who she had used her gifts to helped so much and only been betrayed by in return.  The same sort of thing could have been done with Ridley. Rather than have the whole PTSD attack thing which would have made sense had it been earlier in the timeline and she hadn't killed the guy multiple times already, she could have displayed cold fury that he just won't stay dead and keeps on coming back to plague her, the galaxy, and kill those few who she still feels some sort of connection with. It would have been cool to see her go from that cool, quiet attitude she usually displays and gradually get more and more heated as the fight goes on, culminating in a hitherto uncharacteristic shout of enraged triumph as she delivers the final blow.  Alas, so many missed opportunities. Like you say, it didn't have to be. With simple changes like those shown above, they could have taken the concept and made something really great out of it. Sadly they did not. Maybe I'll have a go at re-writing the plot at some point, to fix the silly plot holes and idiocies that ruined what could have been so good. I'll post it for feedback of course, there's no way I could do a good job just by myself, I'll inevitably miss or forget things. Oh, and a lot of Samus's monologue. Bloody hell, that monologue. At the start, in the flash-backs (hence my extreme aversion to the 'thumbs-down' scene). I don't know, maybe it sounded better in Japanese pre-translation? Who knows, but it's awful in our version."

Metroid,38zale,wreckingcanon,2,Wed Jun 10 12:53:52 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest faults of Other M is that it uses a lot of canon and story from the Metroid manga which a lot of people haven't read. Also it's worth noting that Other M ignores the Prime games.  In the manga it's shown that Samus has PTSD when it comes to Ridley, I mean she did watch him kill her parents. Samus thought she killed him in Metroid only for him to return in Super Metroid, where she thought she killed him once and for all, but to her dismay her rival wouldn't stay dead.  And a lot of people has the idea that Samus is a complete rogue who doesn't respect anyone, but even in Other M it shows that Samus has deep respect for Adam, her previous commanding officer. The Bottleship incident was being investigated by the GF and Adam, so of course she'd listen to someone she respected and thought as a father figure. Limiting her weapons made sense, he didn't want Samus to accidentally destroy anything important or harm any survivors until they got a better understanding of the situation. Yeah the Varia suit thing was bullshit, but blame that on bad game design.  Also, Fusion takes place after Other M, so it'd make sense she's be less respectful to submissive to the GF after the events that transpired on the Bottleship.  There are a lot of problems with Other M but not nearly as many as people bitch about. Samus wasn't acting that out of character, she was just acting like how she acts in the manga, which is canon."

Her ""baby"" issues might have been a little overplayed, but I never felt like she was super dependent on someone.  Samus was a trained military soldier, she was just following orders from a high ranking military officer who was also her superior and someone she deeply respected. The gravity and varia suit bit was ridiculous, yes, but blame that on bad game design."

Metroid,390ckp,Mourossonero,3,Mon Jun 8 09:17:20 2015 UTC,"Your inputs should be like so: shot, up, right + jump. Holding R will just increase the likelihood that you diagonal spark, IMO. If you use a charge shot, you can delay your presses a bit, but it's basically frame perfect to go the whole way.   Using a super means you need to be faster, but you have a couple frames of leeway compared to the charge shot.   Amusingly, if you have grapple like in the video, it's actually just faster to jump to the missile, grapple across, and then do a short charge and spark to the ship."

There's a sense of accomplishment I feel when I get to the next one and they typically have been spaced out appropriately. They also act as a good stopping point for when I don't want to game for too long.
Metroid,38ydc2,iamheadhancho,7,Sun Jun 7 22:08:23 2015 UTC,"I would prefer save rooms over auto-save, but my one hesitation is that many if not most Wii U games straight-up crash if the GamePad dies. It might be handy to have the ability to go ""oh shit"" and save real quick if that red light starts blinking.  Maybe there could be a system with save points and quick-saves, where you can quick-save anywhere and reload your game there once, but then if you die after reloading from the quick-save then you have to reload again from your last save point save."
Metroid,38ydc2,Smark_Henry,-3,Mon Jun 8 01:04:17 2015 UTC,Why not both? It could automatically save whenever you reach a save room.
Metroid,38ydc2,GrayMagicGamma,6,Sun Jun 7 22:30:40 2015 UTC,"That seems counter-intuitive. If you're already having to go to the save rooms to save, all autosaving when you get there would do is take away the ability to not save. There are times in Metroid games where you walk through a save room to get to another location and you might not want the game to save every time you do that."
Metroid,38ydc2,Smark_Henry,-3,Mon Jun 8 01:00:59 2015 UTC,There wouldn't need to be an animation.
Metroid,38ydc2,GrayMagicGamma,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:29:55 2015 UTC,at that point youre just taking away something arbitrary; it's still a save room and not auto save
Metroid,38ydc2,legonro,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:19:36 2015 UTC,"Not having to select save from a binary menu would be autosave, and I don't see how taking away something arbitrary would be a bad thing."
Metroid,38ydc2,GrayMagicGamma,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:26:16 2015 UTC,"well then you'd still have the choice of actually stepping into the station, unless I'm understanding you wrong"
Metroid,38ydc2,legonro,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:27:48 2015 UTC,"You would, but that's literally what autosave is."
Metroid,38ydc2,GrayMagicGamma,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:29:44 2015 UTC,"i dont think you understand what autosave is  im pretty sure autosave is the ability to shut off a game at any point, no matter where you are, abruptly, and still be able to return to that point once you turn the game back on  there are no special rooms or stations involved in this process"
Metroid,38ydc2,legonro,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:15:54 2015 UTC,"I understand, and as a developer, have implemented autosave into multiple games. Autosave just means that you don't have to manually choose to save via a menu."
Metroid,38ydc2,GrayMagicGamma,21,Mon Jun 8 20:16:44 2015 UTC,"auto save and save points completely change the balancing of the game. Save points (in the same way as checkpoints for some other games/series) are places from where you have to start again, and thus every part between them is only long challenge. Fail halfway, and you have to start again.    Auto save or 'save wherever you want' would pretty much mean you could just save after every hurdle and 'never' fear having to redo that part.    That said, that doesn't mean autosave/freesave couldn't work for Metroid. personally I don't really prefer one over the other, as long as the game is designed around it right"
Metroid,38ydc2,henryuuk,10,Sun Jun 7 22:19:39 2015 UTC,"This. Save rooms contribute to the survival aspect of the game. Have autosaves or manual saves could disrupt the balance of the game. Save rooms are part of the foundation of the metroid series, and I hope they remain as a series mainstay"
Metroid,38ydc2,DaPurpleHippo,4,Sun Jun 7 23:17:27 2015 UTC,"Personally I like the save point. They basically give you the idea that Samus basically rests there, and I usually use one before I log of.  This means that when I get to a savepoint and shut my system off, Samus is actually resting at the same time as I am, and when I wake up and start the Gamecube, she wakes up as well and is ready to continue her adventures. I might sound a bit silly, but somehow it gives me that much more immersion. It makes the gameplay feel seamless and without any stops or walls that claim ""Your game is being saved.""  I mean then again what isn't more obvious that a huge robot saving your game? Well maybe it's that it fits in the universe. Samus enters the save station and basically rests. They made saving a part of the gameplay. Autosaving (Or a small icon showing the save) can maybe deter you from the immersion and remind you that you are playing a game.  Not quite sure how to put it differently.  I personally vouch for the savestates to continue existing. I like the idea that when Samus is resting, I am resting as well.  Gives that connection I have to characters where I picture being them (Even if I am a man. This goes for many games)"
Metroid,38ydc2,Melos555,10,Mon Jun 8 00:40:34 2015 UTC,"I'd personally be interested in a save system similar to the one in Dark Souls. The game auto saves, but you have to manually rest at your checkpoints. This means that you can stop playing whenever you want, but you can't scum your way through difficult sections of the game."
Metroid,38ydc2,proclasstinator,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:37:41 2015 UTC,"I haven't played Dark Souls but is what you're describing similar to the Elder Scrolls series where you can quick-save and restore your health by resting, but only if there are no enemies around?"
Metroid,38ydc2,Smark_Henry,2,Mon Jun 8 01:06:07 2015 UTC,"Yes but the quick-saves are at specified locations. Think of it this way, if we put the system /u/proclasstinator suggested into Metroid, the game would save constantly, but if you die, you go back to the last save station. So if you get halfway to the next, grab an energy tank on the way, then die, you'll still have that energy tank because of the autosave, but you'll have to start back from the last station you visited."
Metroid,38ydc2,Koog330,4,Mon Jun 8 01:21:44 2015 UTC,"It would be interesting to see how that could work thematically. Hollowing out is the solution in Souls to punish dying when going for an out of the way item, but that isn't really an option in Metroid. I think a straight up suspend feature may fit better: you can quit out of the game at any time and resume later, but if you die you do lose any missiles/E-tanks you got since the last save."
Metroid,38ydc2,Fried_puri,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:25:06 2015 UTC,It would work if they ever made a game where samus her suit auto pilots
Metroid,38ydc2,henryuuk,3,Mon Jun 8 07:58:08 2015 UTC,"For Metroid, I definitely feel that save rooms fit the feel of the game. I don't think an autosave/manual save anywhere system would compliment the style of gameplay that well."
Metroid,38ydc2,Hellhunter120,6,Sun Jun 7 23:43:37 2015 UTC,"I hope they bring back the password system.  Honestly though, I really enjoy save rooms and I think they compliment the Metroid games perfectly. It makes the player feel a little more vulnerable and really forces you to play conservatively which adds to immersion, among other things."
Metroid,38ydc2,Fishy956,2,Mon Jun 8 00:22:26 2015 UTC,Eternal banishment to the arena of MP:2 bosses for you.
Metroid,38ydc2,Elusive2000,2,Mon Jun 8 15:13:28 2015 UTC,Boost Guardian and Spider Guardian were the two worst examples of save stations in the whole series tbh. They were too damn hard and the save stations (from what I remember) were fairly far away. Please don't send me there!!
Metroid,38ydc2,Fishy956,2,Mon Jun 8 15:28:34 2015 UTC,"Fine, just be careful with mentioning passwords from now on."
Metroid,38ydc2,Elusive2000,2,Mon Jun 8 18:27:52 2015 UTC,"i dont think they should add an autosave, it adds to the hardness of the game."
Metroid,38ydc2,Zarantyr,2,Mon Jun 8 01:30:20 2015 UTC,"I would like a ""soft save"" where if your game crashes or if your dog presses the power button (or whatever) then it will remember that spot, but if you are going to  quit or if you die, then it would revert you to the previous save station."
Metroid,38ydc2,MmmmDoughnuts21,2,Mon Jun 8 02:19:08 2015 UTC,"A temporary ""save and quit"" system would be a nice feature.   You can quit whenever you want without having to reach a save room. But that save is deleted when you boot back up. If you die, you go back to the last save room.   That would preserve the intensity and pressure of survival, but allow me he convenience of pick-up-and-put-down play."
Metroid,38ydc2,seyon35,2,Mon Jun 8 02:42:10 2015 UTC,"No, but it'd be neat to have the ""quicksave"" feature that I've seen appear in some Nintendo games now. Super mario land 2 and code name steam both have a feature that lets you save once so you can pick up where you left off, but if you die you still have to go back to a ""real"" save.   I remember getting into many arguments with my parents because I couldn't ""just save it"", quicksaves would have been a godsend."
Metroid,38ydc2,vvf,3,Mon Jun 8 02:46:14 2015 UTC,"many arguments with my parents because I couldn't ""just save it""   You too?"
Metroid,38ydc2,Elusive2000,2,Mon Jun 8 15:11:48 2015 UTC,It got waaaaay worse when I started playing online games like call of duty.
Metroid,38ydc2,vvf,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:25:39 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah."
Metroid,38ydc2,Elusive2000,2,Tue Jun 9 00:15:12 2015 UTC,"Depends on how it's implemented.  A quick save which lets you stop playing in an instant?  That's fine.  Fire Emblem has quick save, but you can't use it to keep retrying.  That's fine.  A quick save which gets rid of Save Points in general?  No.  The ""come back after death"" savepoints should be a treat to find.  Auto/quicksaves should be limited to having to put the console down, or dealing with sudden power outages."
Metroid,38ydc2,wayoverpaid,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:44:25 2015 UTC,"Unless they just put an auto save point as a Save Room that you HAVE to pass through and auto saves every time, it would rob the incredible sense of accomplishment you get when you survive to reach the next Save Room in a tough levels."
Metroid,38ydc2,MisterWoodhouse,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:40:57 2015 UTC,"I really liked the save rooms in Prime. Save rooms kind of have a more ""open"" aspect, as you can save wherever you want, whereas other things such as checkpoints sort of make it seem a little more linear.  Another cool thing about save rooms was that they felt kind of refreshing, like a bit of a ""break"" from the game, with the calming atmosphere inside."
Metroid,38ydc2,PrimeEchoes,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:12:27 2015 UTC,"If save rooms were re-purposed as health refill rooms, maybe. Some combination of both. Taking out save stations entirely would feel very un-Metroid."
Metroid,38ydc2,1upD,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:26:50 2015 UTC,"As long as there's an option to turn it off, I don't see it hurting anyone. Autosaves would be good for the people who want to make some long runs in the game easier, and turning it off would be good for the veterans who are used to Metroid."
Metroid,38ydc2,ShadowMario3,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:45:10 2015 UTC,"I'd love the game to have auto-save areas. Basically, checkpoints.  Ideally, entering the room connected to a save room would automatically save your game there, but entering the save room and getting on the pad would allow you to refill your energy."
Metroid,38ydc2,gnoani,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:12:27 2015 UTC,But what would we do without the five-note save room jingle?!?! That's THE staple of the Metroid series.
Metroid,38ydc2,graffit0,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:01:07 2015 UTC,"It's strange, we are in an age of autosave functions now. I'm currently playing Shadow of Mordor and I actually don't know if it's saved or not.  I feel edgy if I don't have the option to physically save somewhere myself, like Alien Isolation (which very much feels like Metroid again, ironically).  Save points might confuse younger gamers who perhaps have grown up with autosaves, but honestly it fits the Metroid series to get somewhere on your own.  I don't think crashing would be an issue, but I don't have a Wii U. Also, it might not come out for the Wii U.  Save Points are definitely an accomplishment."
Metroid,38ydc2,Rootayable,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:04:33 2015 UTC,auto saves are the worst shit ever.

Metroid,38ydc2,JerseyCobra,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:31:08 2015 UTC,No. The end. That's kinda contrary to Metroidvanias.
Metroid,38ys5z,BlackTopHatGuy,8,Mon Jun 8 00:03:51 2015 UTC,"I would recommend starting with Metroid Zero Mission(GBA), Metroid Prime(Gamecube) or with Super Metroid (SNES). By starting with these you'll get a feel for the games, and you can go back to some more tedious and challenging games (no map, little/no saves) like the original NES Metroid or Metroid II."
Metroid,38ys5z,Leppy33,6,Mon Jun 8 00:42:53 2015 UTC,"Try any of them. Except Other M. That is all you need to know.  Okay, one more tip. Prime series is 3D exploration, the rest are 2D classic side-scrolling exploration. Get lost and enjoy the immersion. There is no particular order you should play them in. These are not heavy story oriented games. These are majorly exploration games. Now go try one and play it already!"
Metroid,38ys5z,JerseyCobra,7,Mon Jun 8 00:28:51 2015 UTC,"As much as I hate Other M, I wouldn't completely ignore it, just don't make it your first game. It's really cheap to buy, so there isn't much to lose."
Metroid,38ys5z,Wombo194,7,Mon Jun 8 01:43:16 2015 UTC,"Many prefer the Trilogy over the GCN games, including me. Also, it's easier to get now that it's on Wii U eShop."
Metroid,38ys5z,AuraRyu,4,Mon Jun 8 12:34:43 2015 UTC,"Start with Zero Mission or Prime, both are great introductions to the series. Then try Super, Prime 2, Prime 3, Fusion, in any order, just whatever interests you the most, or you can play it in order (Metroid 1/Zero Mission -> Prime 1 -> Prime Hunters -> Prime 2 -> Prime 3 -> Metroid II -> Super -> Other M -> Fusion). You can try Metroid II and the NES Metroid, but both are pretty outdated and awkward to play. I wouldn't recommend Other M, but play if it you want, it's pretty cheap. Super Metroid and Metroid Prime are generally considered the best of the series. Super Metroid is fantastic, though a bit clunky now, and Prime is also fantastic. I would recommend the Trilogy version if you can get it on disc or just buy it on Wii U for $20, the controls are way better than the Gamecube controls imo. There's AM2R, a remake of Metroid 2 that has been in development for quite some time. It has around half of the original game remade I think. Other than that, there's Minitroid which is a cool little fan game, not much else. Did You Know Gaming has some cool stuff on Metroid. Here's part 1 and part 2"
Metroid,38ys5z,Wombo194,2,Mon Jun 8 01:50:57 2015 UTC,Don't bother trying to play the first one for NES. Also don't bother trying to play the second one for Gameboy.  Maybe after you've played the other ones and want to visit its roots you might want to give them a shot.
Metroid,38ys5z,that_dude_you_know,2,Mon Jun 8 02:10:41 2015 UTC,"Prime Trilogy, Fusion, and Super are the best. The first 2 games haven't aged well, but 2 is still worth playing, Play Zero Mission instead of 1. I'd play them in release order, and see how the series changed over time."
Metroid,38ys5z,Weltall548,2,Mon Jun 8 03:32:22 2015 UTC,GCN NTSC-U 0-00 is the only way to play Metroid Prime.
Metroid,38ys5z,Interslice4,2,Mon Jun 8 15:55:13 2015 UTC,"I'd start with Zero Mission. It is a remake of the first and it means you don't need to play the NES version, which is super hard and pretty flawed. Also Zero Mission and Fusion are the best feeling 2D games in the series. Then look up the story of Metroid 2. Metroid 2 is probably the worst 2D Metroid game, not a bad game but not a great Metroid game. Metroid 2 expands upon the story of Zero Mission/Metroid 1 and also is the setup for Super Metroid. Then play either Super Metroid or Prime 1. Super Metroid may feel like a step down control wise after Zero Mission so that's the only problem there. If you play prime and liked it then you'll like all the other 3D Metroids (aside from Other M) So play Prime 2 and 3 straight after. I'd save Fusion until last because story wise it's the last in the timeline. It feels very similar to Zero Mission in the way it controls you you'll like that if you liked Zero Mission. You can play Other M whenever you like really. It doesn't matter because you'll immediately want to forget about it anyway.  By this I assume you mean either 2D or 3D. Honestly it very much varies. It's quite the debatable topic. I loved both the Prime games and the 2D ones but my absolute favourites are  Zero Mission and Fusion. So I slightly prefer the 2D Metroid games.  AM2R, Another Metroid 2 Remake. This is a fantastic fan made remake of Metroid 2, although it's still incomplete. You can get a rough idea for the story of Metroid 2 by playing the demo though. I'd strongly recommend it. It feels just like Zero Mission and Fusion which is why I like it so much. If you type JUSTIN BAILEY into the password screen on the Metroid 1, you get to play as Zero Suit Samus in the first game, Also the series is heavily inspired by the art of HR Gigar, best known for the creation of the Xenomorph aliens found in the Alien movies. I really like the Gigar inspirations in the Metroid series."

Metroid,38ys5z,Jammintk,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:00:12 2015 UTC,"I would say play them in canonical order (metroid/zero mission, prime 1, hunters, prime 2-3, metroid 2, Super, (if you really want to) other m, then fusion Play the US versions. But if your talking about challenges, the main few are 100%, time trial, and hard mode. There are some strange ones like 1% and the numerous modes in super. AM2R- pretty much what Metroid 2 would play like on the gameboy advance Other than that, you would have to look into buying a modified cartridge There's a gamecube in fusion  There's a ""lost"" opening to prime which should've been left in  Then go watch the few Did you know gaming on metroid   That's all I got"
Metroid,38ys5z,Virti86,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:53:26 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend Zero Mission as a great starting point for the series. The rest is kinda split into two groups that follow each other chronologically:   The Prime games (Prime -> Hunters -> Echoes -> Corruption)  The non-Prime games (Metroid II -> Super Metroid -> Other M -> Fusion)  If you play the non-Prime games first, that's fine, but Other M makes little to no sense without Super Metroid as context. The console Prime games should also be played in chronological order so you get a sense of what's going on.  Also, no matter what order you play them in, make sure you experience Super Metroid along the way. It's an absolute masterpiece."
Metroid,38ys5z,breakmanblues,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:12:41 2015 UTC,"As most people have suggested, I'd also recommend Super, Prime or Zero Mission to start.  In fact, do those three first in any order, I think you'll find those three really cover all the bases on what the series is about.  And all the others are variants on those.  As much hate as Other M gets, it's only really the story that really sucks, the game isn't actually terrible and plays quite nicely.  It's not nearly as explorative as Super or Prime.  I suppose it's best to think of it as a 3D Metroid Fusion.  Perhaps save it till last..."
Metroid,38ys5z,Rootayable,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:00:01 2015 UTC,not trying to start a debate on if other m was good or not. i played it for maybe 2 hours and i would play it again. do i think its comparable to a prime game? no but there are things about other m that are pretty awesome.

On the other hand, if you are interesting and people like it they will probably watch more. You have to do something different than everyone else and make it fun to watch. Make it short as well, as most people with no prior experience with your channel would not sit through anything more than like 5-10 minutes unless it was really good.

Metroid,38v7ev,Weltall548,2,Sun Jun 7 02:46:42 2015 UTC,"I love love love this game. It presents you with a lot of the same obstacles of the classic Metroid games; tight passages, destructible blocks, platforms just out of reach. And the solutions to these obstacles are totally new and inventive. The game really pushes you to combine your abilities and exploit their mechanics in order to reach new areas. The end of the game plays dramatically different from the beginning, just because of the new ways you will traverse the world."
Metroid,38v7ev,Hellspark08,2,Sun Jun 7 14:59:33 2015 UTC,"It's absolutely wonderful, I'm in love with it. I think the fact it was made entirely by Tom Happ is remarkable, too.  If we're to judge the game by itself, though, I do have some critiques:   Most of the weapons become useless once you get further in the game, even though some you find much later on and are useless from the start. The level design is great but can feel a little empty and underdeveloped in places.  In this respect, some sort of fast travel would have been good, as having to go from Eribu to E-Kur-Mah makes me want to turn the game off.  It's too far!   But those really are the only negative things."
Metroid,38v7ev,Rootayable,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:17:18 2015 UTC,"Still holding out hope that Nintendo's finally going to give us a nibble of something Metroid-related at this year's E3. It's probably a vain hope, granted, but a man can dream, can't he?  Getting back on topic, I picked up Axiom Verge on Steam last week and I'm absolutely loving it, very awesome game. Just wish I could play it with a proper controller instead of my keyboard though, since I don't have a 360 controller and I've heard horror stories about DS3Tool or whatever the PS3 controller adapter program is. But that's not really the game's fault, so I'll let it slide."

Metroid,38v7ev,Rootayable,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:22:47 2015 UTC,"I agree, the bosses aren't nearly as interesting or difficult as Metroid bosses, but this was all made entirely by one guy, so I'll let it slide."

Good game I really enjoyed it."
Metroid,38qasf,GhostlyPixel,10,Fri Jun 5 22:39:09 2015 UTC,I really like how it's almost a minimalist style of Aztec art. It doesn't look super over-done as many Aztec style pieces do.  And the red. Ohhhhh that red. Great accent.  Nice job!

I love the broken visor since it shows the horror on her face, but I feel like she would probably die if she was exposed to the atmosphere of Zebes.  Otherwise, I think it's really good. Nice job!"
Metroid,38oymm,ZippityZoppity,3,Fri Jun 5 17:47:12 2015 UTC,"Haha oh yeah she would totally die. Super Metroid was my favorite, I've played it so many times. No way you make it that deep into Norfair without going up in a puff of smoke. But I opted out of realism to be able to show her expression. Thanks a lot for the feedback. His legs are out of proportion, I was going for a kind of perspective but I failed."

If you're going for a series of ""bad endings""/tight spots for Samus (which I would love) I think one of a Metroid eating her life forces would be pretty cool, with the fangs/talons all digging into her."
Metroid,38oymm,ZippityZoppity,3,Fri Jun 5 18:40:26 2015 UTC,"Gaaahhh I don't know if I could handle drawing a series of Samus basically dying. Having her losing a fight is alright like I did here, but I always imagine a scenario where she emerges victorious somehow. The series this Ridley piece is part of is a Metroid Boss battle series, I've been doing them for so long that most of them are terribad now. I think this is the only one where Samus is severely damaged, I'm gonna take your advice and start working more of the extreme battle damage ones in from now on. When you see Samus getting wrecked in the Kraid one, you'll know that's your fault!"
Metroid,38oymm,WuzabowFuFu,3,Fri Jun 5 19:07:13 2015 UTC,"To me this one looks like she's having a tough time and might die, soaybe not one's where she's for sure biting the dust, but where she may be having a tough fight sounds pretty cool.  I accept full responsibility."

Metroid,38oymm,BadgerDentist,2,Mon Jun 8 15:15:04 2015 UTC,"This is fantastic! If I got to pick something to be different, I'd want Ridley to be a little more differently-colored from the background. I really don't like the candy-purple Ridley, and I respect your guy's look. Kind of like the older concept art! He could just stand out a little more, I guess. Kraid is pretty yellow and green in a cavernous lair, though, so this will probably occur naturally for your next piece."
Metroid,38oymm,ZippityZoppity,2,Sat Jun 6 03:50:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you! And I'm glad you brought that up! An artist friend of mine said the same thing in his critique, but he's not a gamer and never played Metroid so I wasn't sure. I wanted the fight to feel late, almost over. And as we all know, most bosses in the old days got redder and redder as the fight progressed. But you're right! I could have definitely made Ridley a different red from the rest of the background to set him apart, like in the concept art you linked.  That will be crucial when I do Kraid, so I'll make sure it happens."
Metroid,38oymm,ZeroKarasu,2,Sat Jun 6 15:04:30 2015 UTC,"Where was Samus meant to have been standing? The whole floor is lava. Doesn't say anything bad about the picture, just doesn't make sense in terms of the composition."
Metroid,38p8io,BlueKyuubi63,6,Fri Jun 5 18:18:23 2015 UTC,"Hey I like it! You put a lot of detail into it, which is a pain to do in lineart. Although next time, you might want to give yourself a center guideline so that all the suit parts line up on center. The center of the chest piece is offset looking from the rest of it."
Metroid,38p8io,Cronoan,2,Fri Jun 5 19:59:49 2015 UTC,Yeah I usually just free hand stuff without doing guidelines first but I probably should. Thanks for the feedback.
Metroid,38p8io,Cronoan,2,Fri Jun 5 21:29:33 2015 UTC,It's incredibly good for a freehand drawing. Keep up the great work!

Metroid,38hnot,JinormusJ,9,Thu Jun 4 07:32:52 2015 UTC,"Samus is not permanently bonded to the Fusion suit. She explains in the beginning that certain parts of her suit were organic and that she could not remove the suit when unconscious. Because of this they had to be surgically removed. It can still, however, be removed as normal. The SA-X simply copied Samus' DNA off her old suit parts. It's very likely the old Chozo Varia Suit was still sitting in the contaminated pod. Samus is 1/3rd Human, 1/3rd Metroid and 1/3rd Chozo. It's possible that GF may have had more Metroids backed up in another facility somewhere, but it's also possible to have had the Chozo make more Metroids on a different planet since they were nomadic."
Metroid,38hnot,neoslith,4,Thu Jun 4 15:07:12 2015 UTC,"She could not remove the Varia suit, correct? I know she can materialize and dematerialize the Chozo suit at will while conscious, but would the Fusion suit work the same way? Come to think of it: they had ""endings"" showing Samus without the Fusion suit, so I'm assuming it would work the same way, just like it worked with the Aether-origin suits (they were not Chozo, only compatible with Chozo tech). Just a little confused because the Fusion suit was created by the GF medics, while some of the components were actually created from within Samus and her DNA change. I have to double check that last part, but I remember reading that over in the Lore Mega-Article (but again, that's all speculation at best, soooo...). However, if that is correct, wouldn't that mean she could never use (or fit) a different suit? Obviously, if it isn't, then the whole argument is moot But technically... If the Chozo suit was never retrieved, wouldn't it have been destroyed in the impact? And also; don't the X destroy whatever they infect? Or is that only for the organic components? I thought they also destroy-to-reproduce the inorganic components based on what the organic needs (like with Nightmare) Oh yeah, forgot about Chozo. Duh Are there still Chozo alive following Fusion? I thought by this point, they were all virtually extinct. But I agree; Metroids seem to be a pretty easy mechanic to bring back"
Metroid,38hnot,neoslith,6,Thu Jun 4 16:02:48 2015 UTC,"She was completely unconscious and could not take off the suit. Ignoring Other M's bullshit ""concentration,"" the suit was stuck on her. The Chozo Suit and Varia suit are the same item, Varia just being an upgrade. I always saw the X like The Thing (the horror film) where it can copy anything that was organic, but not inorganic. Though it's really not made clear in the game, as you pointed out with Nightmare. The Chozo civilizations span across the universe. It's hard to say if they're all gone. We think this to be the truth as nobody has seen a living one in years, but we only know what we're shown."
Metroid,38hnot,Koog330,2,Thu Jun 4 16:40:45 2015 UTC,"Got it; I just mentioned Varia because it's been her Trademark suit since it was introduced I used that analogy too; I guess we can only leave it up to theorizing since it is never clearly stated in game True, I guess Nintendo never officially confirmed the Chozo were gone, so it could be a possibility they exist somewhere still in the cosmos. I'd like to think it was implied (adds a certain layer of grunge to an overall amazing lore), but you never know   Thanks for the interesting points. Lots of good discussion!"
Metroid,38hnot,rqaa3721,2,Thu Jun 4 16:51:46 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't Adam point out that Nightmare had organic portions, and the X infested these organic parts of the machine, hence the melty face?"

Metroid,38hnot,NoxTheWizard,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:55:40 2015 UTC,"I think Other M's version of the suit feels odd because in most Metroid games we see Samus remove her helmet as a physical item, probably assuming the rest of her suit is like that as well.  Although Zero Mission has the suit 'magically fade away' like in Other M.  Just seems like a cop-out if it's a digitally controller or whatever. I prefer to think of it as an armour."

Samus has also gotten rid of her weakness to cold after absorbing ""herself"". I believe this means that she is more or less the same as she was before the incident with the X, apart from the Metroid DNA that has been spliced to her.  I'm not clear on how these things are supposed to work, exactly, but all Federation upgrades were downloaded to the Fusion suit. The suit was made by them, so I'm not too concerned about the specifics of this. Absorbing X in order to regain upgrades such as the Speed Booster and Varia Suit, however, that makes me really curious. I have no idea how these biological data copies integrate with the suit, and whether or not Samus has been changed to such an extent that she can receive bio-data outside of the suit as well.  I like to think that it's just what remains of the Chozo tech from the original suit, as it was apparently semi-organic already judging by Samus' choice of words in the opening scene. That would make it easy enough to ""restore"" the suit or get a replacement. The original suit is almost certainly destroyed forever, but if Nintendo wants to I'm certain they will hand her another copy from the Chozo. A more interesting route would be to send Samus on a quest to track down still-living Chozo and then rebuild her own armor, piece by piece, in the next game.  Then again, Fusion took the plot in a direction that's obviously kept them from making a new game that takes place chronologically after it, so for all I know this really was meant to ""end"" the regular suit forever. Also: Ridley and Metroids keeps popping up in this series, and most suit upgrades have multiple copies scattered around the galaxy, so the iconic suit should have a copy as well."
Metroid,38hnot,NoxTheWizard,3,Thu Jun 4 16:46:23 2015 UTC,"Good point about there being multiple copies of the Chozo suits scattered around the ruins of planets Chozo had previously inhabited. I'm sure Nintendo will find a way to work the iconic suit back into the series one way or another. But just think..how Fusion included the original suits destruction as one of its plot points.. It was a pretty incredible twist that wasn't explicitly fleshed out in game but makes sense when you think about it. Kind of gives a whole new depth and feeling behind what messed up adventures Samus has been on; it's as if at this point, there's almost nothing she hasn't been through  I agree that Fusion took such a drastic turn from the series that to come up with the new great idea that would fit the Metroid timeline would be difficult, but I'm still excited for what comes next, and I'm sure in the hands of a capable studio we'll be able to see something great"
Metroid,38hnot,Rootayable,4,Thu Jun 4 17:09:52 2015 UTC,"In Fusion it was a big deal, but in Zero Mission they destroyed the original original suit almost casually in a ship crash. I'm certain that Samus can find a new Chozo suit if she needs to.  Potentially she could get more Fed tech, or pay visit to the Luminoth again. Something I like to think about is what it could look like if Samus was forced to get tech from Space Pirates via some uneasy truce, if the Feds make her an outlaw after the Fusion events."
Metroid,38hnot,flaahgra012,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:25:37 2015 UTC,"If I recall, Samus actually willingly deactivates the suit on escape from Zebes just moments before she is shot down. For one reason or another; I don't think it was actually ever destroyed, possibly only disrupted following the crash.  We can see that since in Metroid Prime you are seen wearing only the Basic Power suit after you lose the Varia Battle upgrade during the first sequence."
Metroid,38hnot,flaahgra012,2,Thu Jun 4 18:48:31 2015 UTC,"Hm, you're right. Once she gains the suit from the Chozo ruins, she is able to use the unidentified items as well, and they should have been lost in the crash. Many items that Samus picks up materialize on the Power Suit, then easily dematerialize once they get deactivated. This happens in both Super and Prime, with the Varia.  Up until Other M made it all Power Ranger styled, it looked like the ship was used to materialize the Power Suit. I guess that the armor and other data is stored somewhere in the Zero Suit/Samus herself (possibly with multiple backups in ships and Chozo statues/systems around the planets), and that the Chozo Guardian merely upgraded Samus' Zero Suit (partly organic or filled with fiber/nanotech, judging by Fusion?) to contain a materialization module or something (plus the upgrade for the unknown items)."
Metroid,38hnot,low_kix,2,Fri Jun 5 11:51:04 2015 UTC,"But the Metroid DNA permanently altered her own, didn't she say?  Resulting in her radically different appearance, which makes me think that her power suit was much more organically attached to her than she made it sound, which is why she's now blue?"
Metroid,38hnot,flaahgra012,3,Wed Jun 10 13:31:30 2015 UTC,"I think Metroid Dread was supposed to be a sequel to fusion, and there was that whole ""Metroid Project: Dread is nearing completion"" thing in prime 3, so it sounds like they're planning on continuing down that path with whatever comes out next, especially since there's no missing chapters left between the current games (that we kno of). I'm really looking forward to finding out what happens next, if love to have a game where samus is a on the run from the GF, that would be a good reason for the isolated feeling from the older games to come back."
Metroid,38hnot,TwistedMonkey13,4,Thu Jun 4 08:34:23 2015 UTC,"I too knew about Metroid Dread; however, it was retcon'd back in '06 never to be revisited ever again. As far as I know, Nintendo had the complete story all written out following the events of Fusion with full concepts but nothing ever happened from then on. As far as I know, the Dread MP3 reference was an inside joke with Retro and a subsequent scan right next to the Dread scan in game referred to an in game event called ""The Dread experiment"" which was an advanced mode of transport for the Space Pirates that went horribly wrong  Maybe one day they'll revisit Dread; or introduce its successor. Having the story continue after Fusion really is the only logical progression in the series seeing as there are no more canonical gaps between games.  The Kotaku Mega-Lore article did an excellent job of ""rounding"" off the entire series by ending the Series at Fusion with Samus turning into a hushed myth; the only living Metroid who was also a human being, only to be talked about in the shadows: but the article was based on heavy speculation and a lot of it was only boarderline canonical at best. Fusion's ending was just too loose to end the series right there.  So, until then  Here's to hoping"
Metroid,38hnot,breakmanblues,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:55:12 2015 UTC,I'd love for them to just make more games like the prime trilogy which just go in between other games to expand the universe and introduce new characters.

Metroid,38hnot,FriendFrog,4,Fri Jun 12 09:23:05 2015 UTC,"For now, yes I believe Samus to be using the fusion suit until she can find another Chozo guardian statue, assuming one exists. Samus also is technically ⅓ metroid, chozo, and human. She's definitely wanted, but since the prime series happens before fusion, I'm not sure that's the reasoning of sylux's(?) pursuit."
Metroid,38hnot,joanlopa,6,Thu Jun 4 10:24:46 2015 UTC,"I always thought that having Samus seek out an abandoned Chozo colony to retrieve her old power suit at a temple would be a great way to get some more insight on the Chozo, and would provide a good excuse to have you lose all your abilities at the beginning of the game. Maybe because her DNA is no longer 100% Samus (1/2 human, 1/2 Chozo), the guardian statue rejects her, leaving her with only a Power Suit stripped of the weaponry.  But that leaves some shaky logic though. If the guardian statue rejected her, why would any of the other statues provide her with abilities? Unless, they introduced some sort of crafting mechanic to have you retrieve your abilities. Say, collect X amount of broken Chozo weapon parts, after which Samus assembles and repairs them, creating a new ability. It would be a neat way to expand on the Chozo lore too."
Metroid,38hnot,autowikiabot,3,Thu Jun 4 15:39:03 2015 UTC,"It's the only unanswered lead in the Metroid universe. It could be a foreshadowing to the next game where Sylux mentions that ""he's been watching (Samus)"", and we put the pieces together to know for how long (hint: since MP3). We don't even know if Sylux was following her even earlier than that (maybe even since Hunters) just that he, or whoever is in that ship, has been ""confirmed"" in pursuit of her at one point.  I really doubt the next ""Prime"" Metroid will take place anywhere in between the current timeline, or after the events of MP3; that series was rounded off so nicely in my belief. The only logical conclusion is to continue off from Fusion"
Metroid,38hnot,Virti86,5,Thu Jun 4 16:06:44 2015 UTC,"The way I've really wanted the next game to play out is that all the Metroids are gone except the DNA inside Samus, making her the ""Last Metroid"" (Next game must have Dan Owsen's voice). The Federation now has two reasons to hunt Samus down: one, because she betrayed them and blew up their space station, and two, because her DNA is the last chance they have at cloning any more Metroids. I really like your idea that the Federation sends the Hunters after Samus, but... I don't think Sylux and the Federation are going to be friends any time soon.  Also, I want Samus to have the Metroids' life-absorption ability (she used it against the X Parasites in Fusion, but not against anything else). It'd be a cool alternative to the main series' health pickups and to Other M's concentration mechanic, while requiring you to get up close and personal with foes instead of just shooting them from a distance."
Metroid,38hnot,Rootayable,2,Fri Jun 5 06:21:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's really all speculation; more mention for discussion as I don't really feel strongly either way: I just want to understand the in-depth lore and story behind it all.  Honestly though; for their next Metroid, I'd prefer if Nintendo played it safe and reverted back to the ""Prime"" 3D style and the ""Super/Zero Mission"" 2D style. After the disaster to the series that was Other M, I don't think Metroid fans will jump at the opportunity for a new major mechanic being introduced just yet"

Metroid,38h635,surgingchaos,8,Thu Jun 4 04:30:15 2015 UTC,"I honestly think it's not intentional. Compare it to the logic of someone who says, ""Oh, look how, if the laws of the universe were any different, humanity couldn't exist - surely the universe was designed for us."" Well, that's getting it backwards. We exist because we evolved within those laws, and it took a long time to get to us, and we're not perfect.  Similarly, these routes emerge because they do not betray the laws of the game, because hundreds of people have the time over decades to exploit those laws (and concordant loopholes), and it's hardly an intuitive or sensible path."
Metroid,38h635,deadandmessedup,4,Thu Jun 4 06:19:03 2015 UTC,I second that. It's also not as weird when you take some of the design choices into the larger context of game design.   For instance you'd want to tweak lava physics so you can wall jump because it will be easier for player without the gravity suit to get out.
Metroid,38h635,Mortimer42,2,Thu Jun 4 06:44:59 2015 UTC,"I was thinking this same thing. In my experience Nintendo has always tried really hard to make their games as ""fair"" as possible. Considering how many lava/acid pits are in Super Metroid, I bet during play testing somebody fell into one and there was no way out, and it was probably both very frustrating and ""unfair"". Or maybe they had the forethought to prevent that from ever happening in the first place.  I can see OP's line of thinking but I choose to believe that many/all of the sequence breaks like this in Super Metroid were unintentional. It makes it that much cooler when people pull stuff like this off."

There were not as many developers so when things hit a workable stage they were shipped.    Bug tests werent as common because of money constraints and the contrast to how much pressure to be perfect there is for triple A games today.  Lastly it is a tribute to player innovation.  Things like glitched any%, reverse boss run, and pretty much any of the speed run category were not actually supposed to exist.  Bugs and exploits were found by the players testing the game and playing/breaking the boundaries.   The game devs were just more accepting because ypu cant really recall a game title once it has shipped, and it adds to playability.   Companies now just want super polished product which is why speedrunable games are less common"

Metroid,38e5oq,ninjakitty7,4,Wed Jun 3 21:17:07 2015 UTC,"Fusion still held on to the Metroid formula, just was more linear and accessible to a casual audience. It still worked. But Super was the shining jewel of the series, as it encapsulated all that Metroid is. Fusion was an experiment and it worked, keeping the series fresh without running away from it's core values.  Other M, for comparison, went too far, and was based on a non-Metroid atmosphere and plot. It strayed to far from what keeps Metroid what it is, and that is why it failed."

Metroid,38e5oq,henryuuk,6,Wed Jun 3 22:48:40 2015 UTC,"That is why most consider it the pinnacle of the series. You can't really keep making Super Metroid over and over, or even that becomes stale. Prime could have been an absolute disaster, but it still worked because it sort of felt like the same game from a new perspective. It couldn't have all of the elements of Super, it just couldn't work right. But it did take from Super and give it a whole new feel, pretty much a whole new game in general.  What I'm trying to say is that you dont have to copy everything from Super Metroid to make a good Metroid game. Super perfected the formula, and it would be wise for future Metroid developers to use the game as inspiration for the next. Using Other M for comparison again, it felt like they used Fusion as their inspiration, and it did not work since Fusion was already pretty far from the traditional Metroid formula."

I mean, people still talk about Super Metroid or the Prime games, but as far as frequent titles and high sales, the game isn't a big title in the Nintendo IP cabinet. The C&Ds that have happened lately were the Super Mario 64 HD remake and the Pokemon MMO, both super popular titles in Nintendo's arsenal.

Metroid,38cn1x,FriendFrog,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:22:59 2015 UTC,"So far I think this remake is pretty good, but the dark area & the area right after the speed boost seem like they still need a bit of work. It just seems like the quality of the game started going downhill at those points. The darkness was just annoying & the robots in the speed-boost area were a lot harder than all the other enemies, so I dreaded having to re-enter a room to encounter them all again, which I did a lot because it was needed for some places were you speed boost. It's also been so long since I've played a Metroid game that I forgot about shine-sparking. I remembered it existed, but I couldn't remember how to do it. If I didn't know about shine-sparking I probably would have just dropped the game entirely at that point. The lava in the south-east most part of the map is also really irritating. There are several blocks that look like you should be able to reach to get yourself out of the lava, but the movement & jumping is so limited you have to slog all the way to the left to get out, which can cost a few hundred health.  I'm also struggling to understand the logic behind revealing blocks. Some blocks show you what 'type' they are just by shooting them, others by using missiles & some by bombs. I still haven't figured out what reveals what. It gets very tedious running around shooting in every direction, then spamming missiles everywhere, to spamming bombs everywhere to find the one tile on the ground showing that you need a super-missile to destroy it. There was a flooded area that hid a path to a missile expansion behind foreground tiles. I found it by accident, but I started to think I might need to come back later with the gravity suit & shine-spark something.  I've killed all the Metroids I can find, but can't find the last one in the area: http://s17.postimg.org/e68ikdhdb/What_Do.png"

Regarding revealing blocks: if you shoot a bomb block with your beam, it'll reveal itself. If you bomb any other block, it'll reveal itself. Most Some destroyable blocks have some kind of wear and tear on it so they're visible and easier to spot.  Here's the map where your last metroid is, I marked the path in red from your save station. If I remember correctly, the room before this metroid has a hollow tunnel in the ceiling that you have to morphball into; the opening should be at the left side of the room.  http://i.imgur.com/WzJSMzm.png"

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band the best album ever - it broke down barriers and changed things forever. Super Metroid (despite its problems affecting playability) created the Metroid formula that all Metroids after it would follow.
Metroid,38dqjp,GingeousC,3,Sat Jun 6 18:11:41 2015 UTC,I really want a 2d metroid
Metroid,38dqjp,bli123z,3,Wed Jun 3 23:42:40 2015 UTC,If we're talking a 3D open world with the grit and horror of Fusion then all of my dreams would come true.

Metroid,38dqjp,Werlompa,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:03:38 2015 UTC,"I want a new narrative game, with horror and static environment like fusion (there's room for this to explain sylux and cylosis as a possible setting) but I also want another game focusing on what happened to the metroids and maybe a revisit of zebes.   I don't mind what the theme is, as long as it's done well, which is way more important."
Metroid,38dqjp,Tyrrexel,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:26:45 2015 UTC,"I dunno. I'd love another Fusion, but I feel like if they make another game (and that's a very big if), they should go back to the wild exploration of Super or Prime, then come back for a more linear story-driven game like Fusion afterwards.

I can absolutely agree that it looks like a lot of Metroid's universe was Alien inspired. I'm glad they varied it up with Prime and Other M, but I agree I'm looking forward to a return of the old gritty style. Maybe E3 will give us something to chew on!!"
Metroid,38e45z,Cronoan,2,Fri Jun 5 17:23:21 2015 UTC,"Metroid - directly influenced by Alien. Scifi horror, action babe that kills a scary alien, panties at the end. The (very handsome) nemesis was even named after the director. Super Metroid - IMO probably most influenced by Aliens. It was more of an action game than a pure horror game. We meet the ""Alien queen"" a.k.a. Mother Brain. Fusion - Definitely influenced by Alien IV. Samus becomes a human/metroid hybrid, just as Ripley becomes a human/alien hybrid. The government thinks it can contain and study aliens/x parasites, and they escape and infest the ship. Samus/Ripley has to stop them, and ends up facing a horrifying ""child"" human/alien hybrid/SA-X, and kills it, and escapes the ship. Prime Trilogy - Giger level of design, everywhere."

They're genuises by making it available only by G3 (kinda end of the endgame, I'm only in G1). Though I'm enjoying the game immensely and I still would be without the Suit."
Metroid,389qsm,DrDongStrong,5,Tue Jun 2 20:32:14 2015 UTC,"The suit actually has decent stats, too. ~500 base defense, wellness, and rock steady, with some points in handicraft. I have mine gemmed with sharpness +1 and recovery up, and you could get it up to ~700 defense. Oh, and the zero suit gives you nimbleness and stamina recovery up, as well as some point in handicraft, at the same defense."

Hit 1 and enter to confirm  If you want to skip the space pirate frigate intro, press 4.  This will put you right on tallon 4 at the ship when you start a new file.  Now hit 6 and enter to enter the exceptions menu.  here you can enter a seed or enter items you do not want randomized.  By default these are missiles, morph ball, and bombs.  If you want to add more, type -e and then the numbers of the items seperated by commas.  The item numbers can be found in the Prime1Randomizer_readme.txt.  (Don't forget to add 5, 19, 28 for the defaults if you add more)  Now on the main menu, hit 7 and enter to run the randomizer.  Now hit 8 and enter on the main menu to repack the iso.  This will open up GCR.  In GCR, go to Root -> Save and save the iso where you want it.  Now go to Root -> Rebuild to create the iso.  The iso is now finished.  You can play it on dolphin or on a softmodded Wii with Nintendont.  Also if you want to know where every item is, the log files are in the logs folder in the Randomizer Script folder."

Metroid,380ekb,gnoani,3,Mon Jun 1 13:54:24 2015 UTC,Makes sense.  Softlock generally means the same thing as a game freeze.
Metroid,380ekb,JinormusJ,3,Mon Jun 1 14:45:45 2015 UTC,"No, it's used for when you're permanently stuck somewhere but the game specifically DOESN'T freeze.  The problem with using SA out of bounds is that you get stuck if you don't land on a standable surface (which aren't common on the opposite side of ceilings), and if you don't land on anything you'll just fall forever with no way to stop the SA."

Everyone else is given a specific homeworld and motivation, however vague. This post looks like a bit of creative setting and roleplay about a poor overworked GalFed scientist, but the twist is that it's actually a pretty good backstory made up for Sylux."

It's been years since I've last played either, so I'm probably still remembering a lot of things incorrectly. I need to find the time to marathon these games again."
Metroid,37xv0u,StimilRetcarahc,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:00:45 2015 UTC,"I'd also prefer it to remain restricted to a single planet and have every area be interconnected, but as long as the gameplay style fits the mood of the game, I'm happy. Prime's freedom of exploration was really satisfying, but Fusion was a different style of game, and if you had the feeling of freedom you did in Prime, you'd lose the suspense that Fusion did so well at building.  It'd be interesting to see another gameplay style than anything we've seen in the series so far, but I can't imagine what it'd be."
Metroid,37xv0u,breakmanblues,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:40:59 2015 UTC,"I think the problem that Fusion and Corruption shared was not so much that they weren't complex, but that they subdivided their levels. Areas didn't quite feel like an interconnected world. It at least made sense in Fusion because it was a space station, but I think Corruption felt so strange because, well, it's a series of planets, which would lead a player to think the areas would be bigger. But nope, they were pretty much the same size as any typical section of a world in Metroid Prime. It's a shame because I really thought they did a great job making each area look distinct and interesting otherwise."

I'd also prefer it to remain restricted to a single planet and have every area be interconnected.  I'd also like some completely new abilities. When I was younger, I felt these games' place in the canon was preventing new types of items, but, these days, I feel, whether it's shown or not, Samus can just lose them at some point like she does for most of her non-iconic powerups, especially those not of Chozo origins."
Metroid,37xv0u,StimilRetcarahc,3,Sun May 31 21:54:12 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you want to define ""motion controls"". The shooting/aiming in Prime 3 was incredible and fluid; maybe I would even call it the best controls for a first-person shooter that I've ever played. I would have no problem if those controls stayed in the game. But the controls for the grapple, the pumps, the fuel cells, etc. were all awkward and completely unnecessary. Those can leave for good for all I care."
Metroid,37xv0u,GingeousC,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:11:49 2015 UTC,"You don't really need to wave your arms around for the prime motion controls (at least for the arm cannon alone). Just point in different spots, that's all."
Metroid,37xv0u,Twilix01,2,Tue Jun 2 18:08:31 2015 UTC,I have to disagree wholeheartedly.  Metroid Prime convinced me that the nunchuk and pointer are the best controls for a first person shooter if done like that game.  And you barely needed to move your hands at all even with the motion control.  I was in the same seating position as when I play my 360 and didn't find it much different.
Metroid,37xv0u,dnaod,2,Tue Jun 2 19:45:53 2015 UTC,"Evolving enemies over time, and Space Pirates that try and combat your abilities. The beam-colored Pirates in Prime 1 were kind of like this, but it was so damn obvious. It'd be neat if some Pirates deflected your Charge Shots back at you or need to be killed with Bombs instead of Beams, or other ways to vary their styles of attack as the game progressed. This would reinforce the benefit of scanning, since a Pirate might seem the same, but his new scan color would hint at the need for different strategies.   I just think Metroid is a game that gets way too easy as you make your way to the end game, except with the bosses. Having enemies that get stronger to combat your own acquired strengths would be so damn cool.   Oh, and Speed Booster and Kraid to make a 3D debut."

Metroid,37wul4,Satiie,1 point,Sun May 31 17:08:54 2015 UTC,"Hopefully, the game that will explain that will be announced at E3!  I had figured it could've been a modified version of Sylux's ship (dude might've gotten some upgrades after Metroid Prime Hunters), but I also thought it could belong to Gandrayda.  With Dark Samus gone, I think that Gandrayda could make a good rival for Samus."

Metroid,37wul4,jz88k,2,Mon Jun 1 03:01:53 2015 UTC,No reason to believe there is one. The only reason Dark Samus exists is because of Metroid Prime using her DNA and the Phazon suit to regenerate itself.
Metroid,37wul4,LLamanaro,2,Tue Jun 2 03:25:39 2015 UTC,"Right.  I feel like such a phony.  Metroid Prime's my all-time favorite game, and yet I'm still clueless about Metroid lore."

I'd probably buy it  After a quick check, I could apparently sell my Prime Trilogy discs on eBay, and be well on the way to getting a Wii U and buying the digital copy. 80 bucks for it. 200 on Amazon! Holy balls!"
Metroid,37qbvz,Katamori777,3,Fri May 29 19:47:48 2015 UTC,I'd keep them if I were you.

Metroid,37qbvz,Jammintk,2,Fri May 29 19:58:43 2015 UTC,If you also have Mario Galaxy 2 and Punch Out (Wii) you could sell those and buy digital editions as well to fund even more Wii u money

Metroid,37qbvz,Jammintk,2,Fri May 29 20:05:27 2015 UTC,"Its a shame, the Wii u has some great games but not enough to really make it an instant buy. Mario Kart 8 is fantastic, Smash 4 is great, Super Mario 3D World is the best mario game i've played since before Galaxy, and I'm hearing great things about Splatoon, but four games does not a great console make."
Metroid,37qbvz,blamb211,2,Fri May 29 20:13:27 2015 UTC,"If there are a few more great releases, I'll very seriously consider it. We'll see what happens at E3. As it stands right now, it's just not really worth it."
Metroid,37qbvz,xooxanthellae,2,Fri May 29 20:14:32 2015 UTC,"It was worth it to me when all I knew about was Mario 3D and Mario Kart. The first ever multiplayer 3D Mario game!!! Uh, yes, I have to have that. Everything else has been gravy."
Metroid,37qbvz,xooxanthellae,2,Sat May 30 08:23:47 2015 UTC,"Captain Toad, Pikmin 3, NES Remix 1 & 2, Deus Ex HR, Arkham City, Bayonetta 1 & 2, NSMBU/NSLU, Rayman Legends, Prime Trilogy for dirt cheap, upcoming Mario Maker, Starfox, Devil's Third, Xenoblade Chronicles X, Yarn Yoshi, Fatal Frame V, Zelda U, etc."
Metroid,37qbvz,Jammintk,2,Sat May 30 08:19:52 2015 UTC,Out of your list I would pick Bayonetta 2 and Pikmin 3 as exclusives to get the system for. Everything else is unreleased or really short or not exclusive.
Metroid,37qbvz,xooxanthellae,2,Sat May 30 08:43:39 2015 UTC,"Deus Ex HR & Arkham City are arguably definitive on Wii U -- they make great use of the gamepad.   NSMBU/NSLU is not short, and it scratches that itch if you need more multiplayer 2D Mario.  All those unreleased games except Zelda should be coming within the next 6 months.   Capt Toad, while short, is fantastic. Let's not forget Wind Waker.  I'd say there's currently at least a dozen really solid games on Wii U, with a half-dozen more coming this year. And it's got the best family / couch co-op games this gen.   And it's worth mentioning that with the Wii U VC you can create a save point at any time in old NES & SNES games -- makes it way easier to work your way through classic games.   I'm always ready to defend the little console that could! haha  cheers"

This picture shows all of the American Games with a great majority of their Japanese counterparts, as well as my number of figures of Samus and some other official (and not-so-official) items.   I even managed to get Metroid Prime 1 and 2 signed by Jeniffer Hale, the one credited for making Samus’ voice (grunts) in the prime trilogy, as well as have an additional copy of Metroid Prime Trilogy still sealed (hard to see in the photo I know, but I can post another pic of it if you guys want).  This does not account for the plethora of shirts, posters, guides, and promo displays and multiple copies of the same figures and games that I also own, but I wanted to share the main crown jewels of my collection, to the franchise that changed my life.  I hope you guys enjoy it.

The Phazon Suit and Gunship where gifts from my younger brother, while the Varia Suit was my first Samus figure.  As for the Varia Suit, sadly it does not light up. They made that one (along a rarer Gravity Suit version) before the Phazon Suit, which was given the light treatment.  I also managed to get my hands on a F4F Zero Suit and pre-ordered the Light Suit statue since then."

Metroid,37nb5v,that_dude_you_know,3,Fri May 29 00:05:33 2015 UTC,"Both of them use 3 AA batteries, and they have a switch to turn on the LED lights. I tend to only light them up when I have guests, or when playing Metroid, just to save on batteries.  The don't really drain them to quickly, but the less power they have, the less bright they look, and the arm canon on Phazon Suit specifically can look like it does not have power when that happens.  The bases are also made of a reflective black material so that when look closely, shows more of the lower details, like the underside of the gunship, which also lights up like in the game"

That World of Nintendo Metroid is amazing I couldn't wait to have it! :D I see you have the Metroid Prime Hunters strategy guide, something I plan on buying for my collection...do you know if it comes with a poster?"

Metroid,37o8di,pastalegion,8,Fri May 29 02:30:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly all it really takes is a large interconnected 2d map to explore with progression dictated by the abilities you unlock rather than being broken up into linear individual levels. What you're describing is what makes a Metroid game, the feeling of isolation and remoteness is endemic to the series, not the larger overall genre.  The reason you like Axiom Verge isn't that it's any more of a Metroidvania than a game like Guacamelee, it's that it has so many stylistic paralells to Metroid and was designed very much as an homage to a series that you enjoy."
Metroid,37o8di,ginja_ninja,1 point,Fri May 29 09:07:52 2015 UTC,"I also played Axiom Verge, and loved it, which is why I started playing Super Metroid and came to this sub. After I finished Axiom Verge, I thought it was an awesome piece of art, and that has not changed, but now I see where the inspiration of much of the game came from. The plot however is very original, not to mention epic, and there are several very original tools and weapons. Overall, I think Axiom Verge's style was almost a perfection of the original Metroid style."
Metroid,37o8di,12killthepoor,1 point,Fri May 29 04:53:39 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed AV as much as any Metroid title since Zero Mission, and for mostly the same reasons.  The song for that bottom right area was obnoxious as hell though, and some of the secret/glitch area entrances are basically invisible. I found only one on purpose, the other two I found were by complete accident, k just randomly stumbled into them, and I know there must be more since I'm at 99%."
Metroid,37o8di,BorisAcornKing,1 point,Sat May 30 03:34:25 2015 UTC,"Some games are closer to either side of the spectrum: Axiom Verge is like 90% Metroid and 10% Castlevania, while La-Mulana is more like 20% Metroid and 80% Castlevania with some Zelda II or something thrown in.   It means Cave Story and Dark Souls can be technically in the same genre despite having little in common (besides the brutal difficulty), they just have different ratios of other games' DNA. I'm assuming that Guacamelee takes after more of Metroid's action gameplay than exploration-heavy Metroidvanias do.  tl;dr:  Axiom Verge: METROIDvania  La-Mulana: metroid VANIA"
Metroid,37o8di,breakmanblues,0,Mon Jun 1 08:15:45 2015 UTC,"I really don't like the term Metroidvania. It doesn't feel like it should exist, Metroid and Castlevania are both pretty different. Before ""Metroidvania"" was a thing, it was just action-adventure.  Anyways, I feel like a ""Metroidvania"" must have items/upgrades and exploration. The best ""Metroidvania"" games to me have isolation and minimal story, or story told through gameplay. A killer soundtrack to set the mood is nice as well.   What I hate in a ""Metroidvania"" is a leveling up system, currency, and stats. When those elements are added, it makes it feel more like an rpg, and getting items doesn't feel that great or fun. It also can make the game feel grindy if not done really well. In other words, keep it simple.  I'm going to be playing Guacamelee and The Fall soon. Both are very, very different games yet I've heard people call both ""Metroidvania."""
Metroid,37o8di,Wombo194,6,Fri May 29 02:43:10 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying but you're overthinking it, the term really is just meant to refer to any game where you traverse areas where you need to get abilities and upgrades so that you can reach previously unreachable areas, so any other gameplay elements don't really make a game not a metroidvania, many games from Dark Souls to  Axiom Verge and Guacamelee fit that description, but yeah at that point the term does become a little redundant I guess"
Metroid,37o8di,flaahgra012,1 point,Fri May 29 03:49:32 2015 UTC,"It's a broad label to be sure. I consider Kirby and the Amazing Mirror as a Metroidvania, a gameplay style that alienated some Kirby fans but others loved."

Metroid,37ppm1,Snearky,5,Fri May 29 13:28:28 2015 UTC,"Prime isn't that difficult. Just make sure you have every energy tank, and learn his moves. Switch your beams when his color changes. The second form is easier. You just need to cycle between your visors and stand in the Phazon pools.  Also, did you call the Parasite Queen hard? It's pretty much the easiest fight in the series."
Metroid,37ppm1,Weltall548,1 point,Fri May 29 13:52:36 2015 UTC,"Comparatively speaking, yes, the Parasite Queen is easy. When I first tried playing the game years ago and got stuck, she might as well as been the hardest. That's just the memory I hold on to, and it probably affected my entire outlook on the game. In any event, thanks for the advice concerning Prime. I do plan to give it another go when my mood concerning the game is considerably less sour."
Metroid,37ppm1,DrDongStrong,3,Fri May 29 19:27:31 2015 UTC,Is this an article or a blog post? I'm actually impressed by how little content was actually in this article. It reminds me of when I was in high school and I just write a whole bunch of fluff to fill my essay length requirements.
Metroid,37ppm1,SomeMetroid,2,Sat May 30 00:57:02 2015 UTC,"Seeing as how it's just OP moaning about how they suck at the game (he thought that the Parasite Queen was hard), it's probably a blog post."

Prime 1 was a bit difficult in places for me, but the Metroid Prime boss itself only took 2 tries (although I used GameFAQs for the second form).    Prime 2 is the one that's got me blocked.  I definitely missed many energy tanks because I almost died to the last Dark World boss, even though I dodged (almost) every attack.  (The energy tanks are probably in the dark world because I usually just try to leave there ASAP because I don't like being there)"
Metroid,37ppm1,damanlyguy,1 point,Fri May 29 14:10:00 2015 UTC,"I've heard that Echoes (Prime 2, yes?) is more difficult than the first game, and I'm not nearly in a good enough headspace to try to tackle it. Good luck with it - getting out of tight situation is something gamers are pretty good at. Also, hearing that someone beat the Metroid Prime in only two tries is reassuring. I know I'm making the whole battle more difficult in my head than it really is."
Metroid,37ppm1,Weltall548,1 point,Fri May 29 19:31:10 2015 UTC,Metroid Prime isn't that hard once you figure out the rhythm to the the fight.  Meta Ridley is much much harder IMO.

Metroid,37hbvb,GhostlyPixel,4,Wed May 27 17:12:59 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people will say the wallkick/spazer one. It's mine as well. It's the most obviously placed and it tells the player that the game is designed with sequence breaking in mind.  For the Prime games it was early double jump, using the ship and a side dash to get up to the ledge with the door to the boots. I think that was my first glitched sequence break actually."
Metroid,37hbvb,PhazonZim,3,Wed May 27 17:29:31 2015 UTC,"My first sequence break was early Plasma Beam. I did it because someone mentioned it and said having it early makes the Phazon Mines a lot easier, so I did it and it did. I now always get it early when I play Prime."
Metroid,37hbvb,Julum,3,Wed May 27 17:50:16 2015 UTC,"Early Ice Beam after getting the bombs in NES Metroid. You just have remember what floor to bomb... one leads to the early Ice Beam, the other to a death trap!"
Metroid,37hbvb,surgingchaos,2,Thu May 28 06:14:05 2015 UTC,"I discovered a couple on my own - first isn't much of a break, but you can escape Thardus's room backwards without Spider Ball after he's dead using a scan dash and a ghetto jump together. Iirc, the pickup despawns and isnt retrievable.  The other, I think I was actually the first to find back in the M2k2 days. In Prime Hunters, After you kill the Arcterra 1 boss, the security door that blocks access to Arcterra 2 is disabled. If you have whatever the lava weapon is, you can actually access Arcterra 2 during your escape, and you have enough time to at least activate the short cut in the second area before time runs out and you have to return to your ship.  I don't think the second one is speed run viable though, it doesnt mesh well with proper routing. At the very least, I've never seen a run that uses it."
Metroid,37hbvb,BorisAcornKing,2,Wed May 27 19:24:48 2015 UTC,"My first sequence break was on Metroid Zero Mission when you beat Ridley first then Kraid, skip some Mini Bosses and Mother Brain strats. Thank you Internet!"
Metroid,37hbvb,Mourossonero,2,Wed May 27 22:57:42 2015 UTC,Zero Mission I learned to get the super missiles early once you have the jump ball and speed boost. There's a 3- or 4-screen wide morphball shinespark you can use to get a super missile tank in the middle of Brinstar   (yes I know this isn't the earliest you can get them but i was like 14 and i thought it was cool shut up)
Metroid,37hbvb,tricky_bird,2,Thu May 28 00:13:44 2015 UTC,"Super Metroid: That Spazer Wall Jump was my first one. It quickly became a habit to go get the Wave Beam (Prior to grapple and speed boost) and then skip Crocomire until later on, or go straight to him without the ice beam via the backdoor/blue gate.  Prime: My favorite was going for the Gravity suit early (IIRC), but I only did it once."
Metroid,37hbvb,tmtsquish,2,Thu May 28 04:43:14 2015 UTC,My first one was probably using a Ghetto jump to skip a spider ball rail in MP1's furnace room. (I think that was the location)  Eventually led to early Ice Beam!
Metroid,37hbvb,Foreskin_Heretic,2,Thu May 28 08:20:39 2015 UTC,In Zero Mission I taught myself how to diagnally bomb jump to get Varia suit early and felt like a god.
Metroid,37hbvb,Ichi_sama,1 point,Fri May 29 20:34:28 2015 UTC,Let's see.. There's getting the spazer early through wall jumping in super metroid as well as getting the wave beam early; doing the space/time beam to reset the game; getting super missiles early in zero mission and getting to Ridley's lair early.. I need to exploit more stuff in the Prime games.

Metroid,37gvas,SeniorSophomore,6,Wed May 27 15:18:05 2015 UTC,I guess it depends if you prefer 2D of 3D. If you prefer 2D then Metroid Zero Mission or Metroid Fusion are the most accessible. Super Metroid is a better 2D game but might be a little daunting if you're new to the series. If you prefer 3D then start with Metroid Prime. I'd played a little Super Metroid back in the day but I didn't really get into the series until I played the Prime games.
Metroid,37gvas,Metroid-Prime,3,Wed May 27 16:17:30 2015 UTC,Metroid: Zero Mission is the best intro. For a first game it'll be challenging but not overly difficult and is the start of the story.  Then do Super.
Metroid,37gvas,Laureolus,3,Wed May 27 15:52:02 2015 UTC,"I recommend you start with Super Metroid or Metroid:Zero Mission, and if you end up liking them you can take on the others. Feel free to ask any question you may have."

Other M has a terrible story and is linear, but is common and cheap.  I recommend starting with either Super Metroid, or Metroid Prime if you prefer 3d. Zero Mission is another good start but isn't quite a strong as super."

The problem with it its somewhat linear compared to to other Metroids. Still a great game nonetheless. I recommend others because they are better for people getting into Metroid imo."

Metroid,37gvas,Weltall548,2,Thu May 28 00:50:44 2015 UTC,Just to sum up: i enjoy 2d metroid far more than 3d as i grew up with it. I recommend starting with fusion then moving to zero mission  Fusion holds your hand a lot. It guides you through while still being an interesting game with a horror esc genre
Metroid,37gvas,Deoxysprime,2,Thu May 28 02:15:21 2015 UTC,And I'd be glad to hear news from you! I'm currently playing Super Metroid and I got really happy when I learned some neat advanced tricks I've found on Youtube. Its called the mockball and its very satisfying to perform in order to obtain items that you shouldn't be able to get from the start of the game!
Metroid,37gvas,thebloudymorder,3,Thu May 28 22:40:56 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, to experience Metroid for the first time again. I kind of envy you :)  If you're looking to get into the series and follow chronologically, then I would recommend:   Metroid: Zero Mission (it's a remake of the original Metroid but with better controls and more content. Also a map. And save points. I love the original game, played the crap out of it as a kid and beaten it more times than I can remember, but given the choice between it and Zero Mission, now? I go ZM all the way.) Metroid Prime Metroid Prime Hunters (though you can probably skip this one, the controls are atrocious, especially if you value your hands actually remaining un-mangled.) Metroid Prime 2: Echoes Metroid Prime 3: Corruption Metroid II: The Return of Samus Super Metroid Metroid: Other M (Good gameplay even if linear, mediocre story and terrible voice acting. It's a nice blend of the 2D and 3D play styles. But seriously though, how do you have Jennifer Hale providing the voice work for the Prime games (as little as there is) and NOT bring her back for Other M? Not saying she would have saved the game, but at least she would have saved the acting.) Metroid Fusion   You'll of course be jumping back and forth between the 2D and 3D games this way, but that's how the chronology goes, and they'll be at varying stages of technology (ie: M2 came out on the original GameBoy. Don't let that discourage you though, still a great game and somehow manages better controls and features than the original NES game.)  If you're just looking for one or two to dip your toes in, to see if the rest of the series might interest you, then hands down:   Super Metroid Metroid Prime   That will give you a taste of the 2D Metroids at their peak (Fusion and ZM are pretty much a straight copy of the controls, with a few tweaks here and there. SM just nailed it.) And a taste of the 3D Metroids starting with the best. It had to be, because there was a lot riding on it's success and Retro poured everything into that game, and it shows. I was one of the people crying foul when it was announced they'd changed to first person but I gave it a chance and I'm so glad I did. It handily exceeded every expectation I had for a 3D Metroid.  If you dig those two, then I'd happily suggest you go back and play them all chronologically. It's such a great series and I'm desperately hoping Other M's failure didn't scare Nintendo off of ever trying again. Learn from the mistakes and move on."
Metroid,37gvas,joecb91,3,Thu May 28 10:00:58 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit new to the series as well (been playing 1 maybe 1.5 years), and I'd recommend starting with fusion, it's more linear than the others and it helped me learn what Metroid Platforming felt like and how to play it.  After that I played Other M and we will not speak of that game here.  But seriously, if you're already invested into the series but haven't played too many games you should play it.  If you play it before Prime, it really shows you how good Prime actually is.  Do not play the original metroid for NES.  If you know what metroids are, that Samus is a woman, there's nothing to be gained storywise from that game.  Plus there's no map system and most of the rooms are copy-pasted versions of each other.  That's all I can say based upon what I've played."
Metroid,37f4rc,H00PSHER,12,Wed May 27 04:14:14 2015 UTC,I really love the Prime 2/3 Varia suit. I seriously think that's as badass as it can get.
Metroid,37f4rc,Falcoun1,5,Wed May 27 04:32:33 2015 UTC,There really is something about the classic varia suit. It just looks so clean.
Metroid,37f4rc,shhh-sippytime,1 point,Wed May 27 04:43:18 2015 UTC,"I liked the Prime 1 Varia Suit better than its Prime 2 and 3 incarnations, personally. Specifically, I liked it better because it looked like they slimmed down the suits in the later Primes, which made her look less intimidating.  I think they tried to make the later suits look more feminine, because they slimmed her waist a little, gave her rounder hips (as opposed to the mostly straight hips that Prime 1's suits had), and compressed her torso a little horizontally. They also lowered and shrunk her shoulder balls, which makes her seem much smaller as a whole (compare how she looks with the Prime power suit and the Prime varia suit to see just how much of an impact those shoulders have on her appearance).   Though she certainly doesn't look fragile in the later Primes, she looks more fragile than she did in Prime 1 because she is smaller and looks less intimidating. I feel like Samus deserves the more badass-looking character model."
Metroid,37f4rc,GingeousC,1 point,Thu May 28 15:36:00 2015 UTC,"Plus, the lighting system they used in Prime 1 made the suits look a lot shinier and nice.  In Prime 2 and 3 the Varia suit looked kinda grimy, to be honest."
Metroid,37f4rc,SomeMetroid,10,Sat May 30 23:26:17 2015 UTC,"Never got around to playing Prime 3 fully, but the PED suit looks so cool to me. I'm a big fan of greys and other cool colors, and I think her bright green visit and red helmet make a really nice contrast to it all. I think if Samus got a suit redesign, a suit like the PED suit, plus the Varia pauldrons with the ridges, would look fantastic.  And to add fire to the Varia debate, I think Prime 1 had it best, not that I hate the 2/3 version, I just think 1 did a great job of giving a bulky sense without actually being bulky, whereas 2 and 3 just went for a sleek look."
Metroid,37f4rc,GhostlyPixel,1 point,Wed May 27 04:43:09 2015 UTC,"Idk, the shoulder pads in prime 1 just seemed to bulky.  I liked prime  take on the leg - orbs more, though. I think prime 3 did good work of proportioning them  And it's a bit petty, but I never really liked that middle wedge in samus visor the later primes introduced"
Metroid,37f4rc,pastalegion,7,Sun May 31 14:42:05 2015 UTC,"Absolute favorite? The Light Suit...despite the giant lights in the front. Others I really like include the normal Fusion suit, Varia, PED, and the Phazon suit."
Metroid,37f4rc,SpaceWarriorSamus-,6,Wed May 27 09:02:41 2015 UTC,I think the lights are to make it light in the dark world...
Metroid,37f4rc,txcrnr,8,Wed May 27 12:54:43 2015 UTC,The Gravity suit from Super Metroid.
Metroid,37f4rc,LuxShadow1,3,Wed May 27 11:37:31 2015 UTC,Agreed
Metroid,37f4rc,that_dude_you_know,8,Wed May 27 14:34:17 2015 UTC,The Phazon suit from Prime 1 looks awesome.  I remember when I first got it I just sat looking at the screen for a few minutes appreciating just how cool it looked.
Metroid,37f4rc,MankeyMaster,6,Wed May 27 13:30:53 2015 UTC,For me it's a tie between the dark suit from prime 2 and the light suit from prime 2. They both just look so cool...

Metroid,37f4rc,JinormusJ,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:42:49 2015 UTC,I hate the dark suit sooo much.  It looks like an old rusted version of the normal power suit to me.

Metroid,37f4rc,corvettee01,4,Fri May 29 15:10:47 2015 UTC,If you are going for sleekness then how about the Light Suit?
Metroid,37f4rc,txcrnr,3,Wed May 27 12:53:32 2015 UTC,"Other M's incarnation of the Varia suit, I'm a huge fan of sleek designs. Worthy mention of the Dark Suit from Prime 2 with its transformer-esque shoulder pads that remind me of wheels."
Metroid,37f4rc,kurukito,4,Wed May 27 14:19:51 2015 UTC,"Everybody can hate me, but I really like the dark suit. I do leather working and a little bit of metal smithing as a hobby, and the colors and design match very well with what I do.  Also, the original fusion suit. The blue color is really cool, and the spikes are awesome.  Now I wanna make a leather fusion suit, probably the final one..."
Metroid,37f4rc,Elusive2000,2,Fri May 29 17:40:16 2015 UTC,A Dark Suit cosplay made of leather and metal plating would be pretty freaking badass.

Metroid,37f4rc,Elusive2000,1 point,Sat May 30 21:07:25 2015 UTC,To be completely honest; I have the theory that the middrift plating on the Dark Suit is actually some sort of flexible latex or leather of some sort; there is now way Samus can move like that in some cutscenes if it was completely metal
Metroid,37f4rc,JinormusJ,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:46:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, something flexible of sorts, at least."
Metroid,37f4rc,Elusive2000,3,Sun Jun 7 03:14:06 2015 UTC,"I really liked the Power Suit from the beginning of Prime 1 and Zero Mission. The sleekness, shoulders and chestplate decal were all just very aesthetically pleasing. The classic Varia suit is great too."
Metroid,37f4rc,LinkOnDrugs,2,Wed May 27 21:41:37 2015 UTC,"I do like that one a lot, but the gravity suit is my favorite for that color, and probably nostalgia. With the new Smash, I find myself using the Dark Suit which I like for the colors, and shoulder design in-game.  Finally, I think the light suit's physical design is interesting."
Metroid,37f4rc,VTSvsAlucard,2,Wed May 27 04:32:46 2015 UTC,"Omega Suit from Fusion just carries so much emotional weight. When you finally get it, you feel like such a badass."
Metroid,37f4rc,joe_copp,2,Wed May 27 06:44:28 2015 UTC,Prime 1 Gravity. Closely followed by the Other M Varia
Metroid,37f4rc,Knuxfan24,2,Wed May 27 12:10:21 2015 UTC,"Varia suit in Metroid Fusion... ha! I actually think that the Prime serie made Samus a little too much ""bulky"". I hesitate between Super Metroid Gravity suit, Zero Mission Varia suit, Corruption PED suit (so stylish) and Other M Power suit. I believe that speedrunning the 2D Metroids really made me think that Samus is agile and fast. Would you prefer to control a tank in the next Metroid or a powerful gymnast? I'd go for agility :)"
Metroid,37f4rc,Mourossonero,2,Wed May 27 21:36:24 2015 UTC,Light Suit and PED suit

Metroid,37foe6,LightDragonman1,6,Wed May 27 07:55:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's impossible to have a submissive main character. A main character can be as abhorrent or pathetic as they can possibly be. In fact a character could have no positive traits at all and you could still get an interesting story out of it(Spec Ops: The Line springs to mind).  Now this obviously is not the case in other M. Mostly because it goes against 20 years of cannon where Samus is mostly seen as a person singlehandedly exploring planets and taking down space pirate bases, only to shift too ""NOO! I CAN'T USE ACTIVATE A SUIT THAT WOULD SAVE MY LIFE! ADAM-SENPAI WOULD NOTICE!"".  But rather than doing what I usually do in Other M discussions (IE rail it with sharp points until it bursts into tears) let's instead go for a slightly more constructive debate.  One problem I always had with the idea of a more story driven entry into the series is that you'd need to focus on Samus as a character. And where could you really go with that? After all we have established that she's capable of nearly anything, what flaw could she genuinely have as a person that wouldn't feel weirdly out of place? After all if the flaw is too big it would feel disconnected from the previous games (See Other M Ridley scene), however if the personality flaw is too small then it would feel hopelessly quaint or just silly. Like a supermodel who is considered ""ugly"" because she has a mole on her cheek.   This is not to say that a more narrative driven game is impossible, it’s just that I don’t see many ways where you could really explore what Samus is like as a person."
Metroid,37foe6,Mortimer42,2,Wed May 27 10:13:38 2015 UTC,I'm just going to throw this out there: would a Reboot where we rethink Samus' character to have a flaw(or flaws) that make sense but isn't something that paints her as weak?  Like why doesn't she get some form of PTSD from when she's facing Ridley? Didn't he kill her parents in front of her and destroyed her home? I'm sure that left some deep wounds in her mind somewhere. And part of the plot would be to overcome that PTSD and face Ridley.  That could be seen as week though now that I think about it. But I can't see a character that can just shrug something like that off unless they didn't love their parents in the first place or was fucked up in the head.  Would this work for Samus? I think it would at the very least make her feel more human. But I might be missing something.
Metroid,37foe6,VentusAlpha,3,Wed May 27 15:32:09 2015 UTC,"The problem with a rebooted personality is that we would have to re-think a lot of the gameplay as well. Since the series thus far has always been one of the greatest bounty hunters exploring an isolated environment. Which is where a lot of her defining character moments come from.  I suppose you could make her more of a misanthrope, tough I don't really see how that would change much considering you never really interact with anybody. And even then you'd have to consider retconning some of the better moments in the series.  Tough I don't think it's possible to have a real case of PTSD. Mostly because it doesn't make sense from either a character perspective, or the player. Through the series Samus has stomped Ridley into the dust at least 6 times. There is no logic in being afraid of him after that.  Personally I always pegged her as a strange and bizarre person. She might look human but she only appears as such. After all she was injected with Chozo DNA at a young age and raised by them. If anything her actions and mannerism would speak more from the Chozo mindset, to the point where very little ""human"" remains."
Metroid,37foe6,Mortimer42,3,Wed May 27 17:45:46 2015 UTC,"I think there's such a wide range of emotions that you could explore in a compelling way in regards to Ridley, specifically.  I mean, imagine having the killer of your parents and home not only get trumped by you, but brought back to life multiple times. He just won't stay dead, I think that could present a huge range of emotions. Anger, frustration, maybe a feeling like you're going insane, sadness, there's so many complexities even from a human perspective they could have drawn on with Ridley coming back. Maybe have a dynamic of Samus be both calm and collected, cold and focused, but Ridley stirs up an irrational anger. A dynamic to show her human side without diminishing her character.  And then there's the possibility of, like you said, Samus possibly being quite different from normal humans. Maybe the Chozo were very stoic, seeing life as something not to grieve but as a force that continues. Maybe she is given a different perspective on life from her upbringing that leads her to be in one set way, maybe inquisitive, or stoic, or headstrong, whatever they may be."
Metroid,37foe6,Butter_Is_Life,5,Wed May 27 17:59:28 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of problems with other m.  Not using her upgrades was a gameplay mechanic. People whine too much about this when we all know it's more just to keep the game metroidy.  Besides that the story really was poorly written. There was symbolism that was about as clever and subtle as a brick to the face, and to be quite honest I think it really shows that Sakamoto is at least a little bit sexist. I mean his ideal heroine here is one who is so damn submissive, and weak, and dependent on approval from a toxic father figure. Adam in particular is a tremendous asshole the entire game and the whole while Samus is over him like a lost puppy reunited with it's mother. It really leaves a bad taste in your mouth even without any context at all.   I think if the writing was more self aware they could have possibly pulled off  the approach of making Samus into this weak little girl hiding behind a power suit. The thing is they weren't. We see Adam being a dick, and Samus narrating ""but he was the only guy who wasn't a sarcastic dick to me"". This isn't shown as a twisted perspective of a young woman who lost her family twice and is just looking to reconnect with someone. Instead we don't have an unreliable narrator and Adam is genuinely supposed to be a good guy according to the story.  If the writing was up to snuff we could have had this grand expose of Samus. Her tough exterior is a front but she's able to grit her teeth and overcome her insecurities. We  could see how the loss of her family caused her to twist this professional and superficial relationship with a superior officer into a surrogate father figure. We could have seen her struggle with ptsd from her many adventures. They might have done a better job for using the baby metroid as a surrogate for a mother losing her baby, but honestly this is a thing samus spent all of 5 minutes with so it's kinda eh....    I don't know how appropriate such a narrative would be for a game, especially one of this genre, and it would still stir a lot of controversy, but a well done telling would at least have been defensible.  With context the game has a lot of problems. The story itself rehashes a LOT of metroid fusion. Right down to the secret metroid breeding chamber, and clones of classic bosses coming back for a rematch.   Samus did have something of a personality in the  metroid prime games. She wasn't entirely the tabula rasa on which to project ourselves. What we saw did show her as the stoic, badass. Instead of literally regressing into a little girl when she sees Ridley she sharges head first down a pit and literally shoves her gun in his mouth. We do get a glimpse of a softer side of her at the end of mp3 where she goes to the nearest chozo planet(where she'd feel comfortable), and kicks off her powersuit in order to sort of remember and mourn her fallen comrades in that game.   The game is also flawed in that it is way too deep into the timeline to have Samus deal with things like the ptsd whenever confronting the guy who killed her parents. You know the guy she killed twice in metroid 1/zero mission, once again in mp1 and then again in mp3, and then again in super metroid.  But let's have her deal with this now.  You don't just get over ptsd sure, but it's kinda odd to add this in this late into the series and the timeline.   Speaking of prime, the game also manages to for no real reason at all cut metroid prime out of cannon. Something I think will been rectified with the next game I guess since  this game bombed, but considering that the prime series is often held as a fan favorite and that it brought the franchise back from the dead, it's kind of a dick move on sakomoto's part."
Metroid,37foe6,LonelyNixon,2,Wed May 27 17:40:50 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, one of the biggest problems that I have with a few members of the fan base is related to how they perceive Samus. Why can't Samus be both sexy/athletic and a badass? Another thing is this: Doesn't it make more sense for her to be wearing the Zero Suit (which was meant to be an interface with her Varia Suit) than her running around in a suit of armour while just being in her underwear? People never complained about her being scantily-clad when she first revealed herself, and yet when she got covered up, people started shouting obscenities towards the Metroid team.  Other M has a ton of problems, but at the same time, a sizable amount of the community has to get over themselves. We have real-life people like Ronda Rousey, who is both pretty and the most dominant female MMA fighter in her division. Why can't Samus be both? Why should she have to be pretty but submissive, or badass but ugly?   Anyway, just ranting right now.  Edit: some extra clarification"
Metroid,37foe6,fusionsuitpika,2,Wed May 27 19:52:48 2015 UTC,"It's funny that you brought up Bayonetta, cause when the inevitable Rule 34 art of Bayonetta started popping up, Hideki Kamiya got annoyed. Not because it existed, but rather because it all depicted Bayonetta herself in a submissive position.  But honestly, if I were to think of Samus as a character, she would not at all be like the depiction in Other M, all in her head and unsure of herself. I'd imagine her to be the opposite actually, a very instinctual and self-sufficient, albeit sometimes selfish survivor. Something like Max Rockatansky or, more fittingly, Ellen Ripley.  The thing that annoys me most about the Japanese perception of Samus is that she needs to be an honourable figure, I'm sure we've all heard about the story where Retro Studios wanted to put bounties into their Metroid game, but Nintendo said that a character like Samus would never stoop that low. I wish they shook the image of her being some kind of wandering warrior hero and let her be the Boba Fett she needs to be."

Metroid,377wjv,saintjimmy64,4,Tue May 26 00:54:02 2015 UTC,"Let's be real here, the source material is pretty sexualized.   http://cdn.wikimg.net/metroidwiki/images/f/f1/Zero_Suit_Samus_zm_Screenshot_2.png  http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/metroid/images/5/5b/Zss_backside.jpg  http://www.metroid-database.com/mzm/mzmend6.png  http://www.metroid-database.com/mzm/mzmend4.png  http://www.metroid-database.com/mzm/mzmend2.png  All of this is official art for Zero Mission.

Metroid,377wjv,Hylian_Spud,16,Mon May 25 17:44:20 2015 UTC,"So having sexual identity lessens the character? She's not a badass if she's also sexual? :|  Don't say we. You don't speak for all of us, especially those of us without insanely puritanical views."
Metroid,377wjv,Link1299,13,Mon May 25 17:49:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't get why he has to act like everybody feels that way. I think it's cool that Samus isn't sexualized in the games and stands as a character on her own. But I don't see why anyone should care if other people want to create sexy fanart as well. You can choose to ignore it easily."
Metroid,377wjv,isienmai,2,Mon May 25 18:16:56 2015 UTC,"Or for shame... tasteful sexual images  Maybe that's something we never get a good grasp of samus.  Sex is a part of a character, and being ""sexual"" is not defined as one thing, and not necessarily always a bad thing.  This is pretty good... reminds me of Fey, which would suit her in a way."
Metroid,377wjv,Sharzona,0,Mon May 25 21:42:40 2015 UTC,As in Faye from Cowboy Bebop?
Metroid,377wjv,Sharzona,1 point,Mon May 25 22:40:03 2015 UTC,"To answer anyway yeah.  I've been on a Cowboy Bebop kick lately, and if you were going to sexualize Samus, well I'd think she'd be someone well aware of her talents.  And while she probably wouldn't be as arrogant as Fey I certainly would think she would fuck with guys who hit on her before laying them on their asses out of their own stupidity.  She's still a lady, I never got the impression of anything else.  And ladies can be sexual, hell even charming.  But this doesn't mean she goes around whoring herself."
Metroid,377wjv,henryuuk,1 point,Mon May 25 22:52:10 2015 UTC,"Oh, nice! That's one of, if not my favorite anime.  Their worlds are similar enough that it makes comparisons pretty easy, with the whole bounty hunter in space thing. I haven't played enough Metroid (unfortunately), to know how accurate that is."
Metroid,377wjv,Sharzona,2,Mon May 25 23:41:39 2015 UTC,"Well, unfortunately friend Samus is a mystery to us for the most part.  From my game knowledge, she is as mysterious to others as she is in game, but from my impression is known to have two sides, a sort of sweeter side, that she shows to her friends, and an almost merciless side to her enemies.  Reading the Metroid Prime logs really speak volumes for how much the Space Pirates actually despise and even fear her.    she is seen as compassionate at times however, saving the baby metroid,, and in the case of Fusion, her care to the AI who replaces Adam.  Her unlockable splash art in zero and fusion we get glimpse into her every day life, going to bars for a lonely drink, and often being more womanly than we ever get to see her in the games.    Again, if I had to giver her a voice, I think it would be one much more human.  One who treats her self as woman, similar to the way Fey does but maybe a little more subdued.  Because Fey is a great example of a strong, sexualized female character.  But that whole show is about everything, from art, to music, to combrady, to hardship, to sex.  I would love to see a true cross over, just a day in the life of Samus Aran.  I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't unlike that of Bebop."
Metroid,377wjv,legonro,8,Tue May 26 01:24:33 2015 UTC,"Not at all, I mean look at Bayonetta. Badass and sexual can easily coexist. The problem is that Samus simply hasn't been a sexual character in any of her games (except maybe Other M. I haven't played it so I can't comment). As a result, suddenly throwing sexuality/cuteness in there just feels wrong. Images like this are just completely out of character for her.  Images like this and this, whilst sexual, keep samus in character.  Ultimately it's all subjective anyway and the image you linked is very well done, it just doesn't line up with my(and apparently many others') mental image of Samus."
Metroid,377wjv,igor6661,-2,Mon May 25 18:13:56 2015 UTC,"You can be both, but trust me, when art is done of Samus without her suit in the internet, it's 99% not done in an empowering or positive manner. The purpose of this artwork is to show a cuter more sensitive side of Samus, which it does admirably (which is why I upvoted it) but then it does everything possible to highlight (and exaggerate considering that she's an Amazon of a woman) her sexual characteristics then undermines the importance of who she is and what she has done. It's possible to do both, but her over-sexualization on the internet is getting real old real quick.  This is Samus Aran: http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/metroid/images/d/d8/Samus_Aran_Varia_suit_Super_Metroid_Player%27s_Guide_1994.jpg/revision/20130627200457 Not someone who has an inexplicably sexy/vulnerable position while she sleeps."
Metroid,377wjv,txcrnr,5,Mon May 25 18:00:14 2015 UTC,"We've never seen Samus asleep off mission. She could be femme as fuck and that wouldn't make her less of a badass. Also, canon has changed in the 20 years since that was made."
Metroid,377wjv,txcrnr,-2,Mon May 25 18:02:59 2015 UTC,"She could easily be ""femme as fuck"" but that definitely doesn't change the fact that there's a vast amount of art on the internet that turns her into a sex object, and this is getting awfully close."
Metroid,377wjv,saintjimmy64,2,Mon May 25 18:11:47 2015 UTC,"That hasn't been 'Samus Aran' for several years now, and even then it was only shown like that in a manual, ingame her physic isn't like that."
Metroid,377wjv,txcrnr,-1,Mon May 25 20:11:21 2015 UTC,"You are correct that her model has changed, but that picture is an embodiment of what it means to be a badass planet destroying, monster slaying bounty hunter IMO. It's fine that she's slimmed down and femmed up a bit but when you over-exaggerate that it becomes obnoxious really quickly"
Metroid,377wjv,dickholedoug,3,Mon May 25 20:14:55 2015 UTC,"i cant help but imagine your point is that sexy women can't be powerful  its literally going in the opposite direction of what youre trying to achieve here   that picture is an embodiment of what it means to be a badass planet destroying, monster slaying bounty hunter IMO  It's fine that she's slimmed down and femmed up a bit but when you over-exaggerate that   why? why can't samus be drawn however the artist pleases without somebody piping up and saying that it goes against her power?  you are literally telling me that femme charm and power cannot go hand in hand with each other  you actually said that the best we can do is ""femme her up a bit"" before we need to stop and realize that she's ""strong"" and we can't take it too far  you are fucking your own argument right now"
Metroid,377wjv,Sharzona,-2,Mon May 25 21:51:19 2015 UTC,"the influx of sexualized Samus images cheapens her character. It leads to her being interpreted as a sexy character to some rather than a badass.. And yes, I think portraying her in a way that is meant to please males inhibits badassery. Of course, Nintendo hasn't helped with pushing Zero Suit Samus so much (Conan O Brien: ""is there a birthday suit Samus?"")"
Metroid,377wjv,Hylian_Spud,-1,Mon May 25 18:08:02 2015 UTC,"Just remember this: The creators of the series wanted Samus to be like Ellen Ripley, NOT Bayonetta. Sure, Bayonetta can be sexy and badass, but Ellen Ripley is strong and stoic.  Drawing her to be sexually objectified undermines what she is supposed to be."
Metroid,377wjv,Sharzona,3,Mon May 25 22:07:52 2015 UTC,"Just remember this: The creators of the series wanted Samus to be like Ellen Ripley, NOT Bayonetta.   Oops. Well this is AWKWARD!. Guess we better strip Samus down a bit more then."
Metroid,377wjv,Hylian_Spud,1 point,Mon May 25 22:17:31 2015 UTC,"Right. Yet this scene does not detract from her or hurt her image in any way, similar to the zero suit in Zero Mission. Whereas showing it off and having her drawn as if to make it obvious is he issue. Edit: Also, I should add that the script was originally designed for a male, with this scene still having the character in their underwear. It was to show vulnerability, NOT sexuality."
Metroid,377wjv,legonro,-2,Mon May 25 22:58:21 2015 UTC,"Not even similar. You clearly tried sexualizing her. And since I know your going to argue, you gave her a breast window and them also being pushed up by the doll. I feel like you should at least own up to it but maybe you disagree.   Being in light clothing doesnt instantly mean sexualized. This is sexualized."

Metroid,377wjv,legonro,-1,Mon May 25 17:03:13 2015 UTC,"Massive boobs with plenty of cleavage, exposed legs/ass. Is that even a question? The art is high quality, I just prefer my bounty hunter as a badass than a sexual object."
Metroid,377wjv,Sharzona,12,Mon May 25 17:26:56 2015 UTC,Why not both?
Metroid,377wjv,twinfyre,-18,Mon May 25 18:10:08 2015 UTC,"....really? wow. ummm, well to start, you do realize that sexual objectification is bad right? And it demeans all of the great things she's ever done? Just because a character is female doesn't mean they have to be sexual or a sexual object at all."
Metroid,377wjv,Sharzona,4,Mon May 25 18:18:35 2015 UTC,"The two are not mutually inclusive. Samus can still be an attractive woman, while still being a badass. It's not like it's not canon; We have zero-suit Samus and the famous endings for getting a high completion percentage.  I don't get why this does anything to demean her as a character.. She's not just a one dimensional character that relies on sex appeal, it's just a bonus."
Metroid,377wjv,twinfyre,11,Mon May 25 19:26:58 2015 UTC,"so are you saying that no male characters in video games can be handsome? we'd better do something about captain falcon   wait im guessing you haven't complained about his tight abs, rounded pecs and perfect ass because he's a man and that doesn't fit your quota of complaining about sexualization of video game characters"

Metroid,377wjv,Donald_Crump,-5,Tue May 26 01:00:29 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between being sexy and being over-sexualized, or a sexual object. Pretty characters are fine, handsome characters are fine, but it's when it goes too far that it becomes a problem. Samus has long been objectified because of the fact that she's a woman (just google zero suit samus sans safe search if you dare) whereas when people draw captain falcon in a sexy manner, it's because it's hilarious because people AREN'T (or the vast majority of them) thinking about jacking off to him. I'm not subscribed to r/fzero but i'm guessing that oversexualized Captain Falcon is not a theme there whereas for it has long been an issue for Samus, especially on this sub."
Metroid,377wjv,Oduya,8,Mon May 25 18:34:59 2015 UTC,"so the thought of other people masturbating to fan-art of samus is what ruins your image of her?  seriously man? we've all played the prime trilogy, we've all played super metroid and zero mission, we know samus isn't supposed to be a fucking barbie doll with big titties  but this is fan art, i honestly don't think its right for you to be policing what is and isn't okay for metroid fans to be drawing. if this were the 1800s and we weren't allowed to show ankles, maybe i'd be a little more understanding to your cause"
Metroid,377wjv,Donald_Crump,-3,Mon May 25 18:40:10 2015 UTC,"As I had mentioned, I upvoted the art because it did a good job at showing a cuter more sensitive side of Samus, I just also wished that people would stop hyper-sexualizing her. Yes it is fan art and fans are able to draw her however they wish, I just wish this subreddit would stop encouraging it. And how am i policing it? Just expressing an opinion/wish is considered policing?"
Metroid,377wjv,Oduya,8,Mon May 25 18:43:40 2015 UTC,"Yes it is fan art and fans are able to draw her however they wish, I just wish this subreddit would stop encouraging it.   i really think youre looking at this the wrong way. as far as i can tell, most of the people on this subreddit aren't trying to get hard by looking at samus drawings  hyper-sexualization is honestly subjective, so what you might involuntarily get wet looking at might just be another day on deviantart for someone else  like i said before, most of the people on this sub know that samus isn't supposed to be an object. this is /r/metroid, we've been playing this game since the days when samus was still a 2d sprite  on a pre-rendered background. you're not preaching to a school bus full of horny teenagers when you try to tell us that samus isn't a barbie doll  im not tired of people drawing samus as a sexy woman, because its not what i see on the front page every day. what i am tired of is people acting like ""hyper-sexualization"" of a video game character we're all used to looking at is a real and serious problem, when at the end of the day we're all just looking at OP's particular art style. does she have big boobs? yeah, holy shit call the police because ive never seen a pair of tits in my entire life"

Metroid,377wjv,MocephusRocks,4,Mon May 25 20:46:35 2015 UTC,"But is she oversexualized? You've established that she is definitely sexualized, but how is she oversexualized? What would you consider a normal level of sexualization?"
Metroid,377wjv,Hylian_Spud,1 point,Mon May 25 20:50:43 2015 UTC,"Well that's actually a valid point which I hadn't really considered. I find that art to be over-sexualized while clearly other people don't. So I guess there is no ""normal level of sexualization"" but it's rather subjective."
Metroid,377wjv,MocephusRocks,6,Mon May 25 20:26:43 2015 UTC,"That's definitely a good way to look at it. Personally, something crosses into oversexualization territory for me when said sexualization is gratuitous enough to the point where I no longer find it attractive.

Metroid,377zts,heart-station,4,Mon May 25 17:02:44 2015 UTC,"Neat idea. It'll never happen, but a neat idea nonetheless."
Metroid,377zts,Jugaimo,4,Mon May 25 19:34:28 2015 UTC,Why?
Metroid,377zts,FriendFrog,1 point,Tue May 26 00:38:28 2015 UTC,Seriously?
Metroid,377zts,FriendFrog,5,Tue May 26 00:51:35 2015 UTC,"Yes. Why do you think this would be a good idea? I see a lot of ideas for Metroid games that seem to want the series to be more focused on narrative & it often involves being someone other than samus & seeing ""play as a generic GF grunt"" surprisingly often."
Metroid,377zts,FriendFrog,1 point,Tue May 26 01:16:24 2015 UTC,"not generic, her little sister  I think its a better solution to Metroiding than having her in an explosion again, losing her abilities again and collecting the same powerups again. Or even worse the Other M ""I didn't authorize that, Samus"" approach."
Metroid,377zts,fusionsuitpika,4,Tue May 26 01:30:01 2015 UTC,I didn't realize that you thought collecting the same powerups across multiple games was a problem that needed to be fixed. You just started with a very elaborate solution without mentioning what problems it was meant to solve.
Metroid,377zts,SomeMetroid,3,Tue May 26 03:37:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. It's similar to the supposed ""problem"" with LoZ, wherein people want someone like Zelda to be the playable character.  While it's a neat idea, I always ask people what difference does it make to have Zelda as the playable character, when the game would most likely have the same progression as previous Zelda games. And like you said, it doesn't solve anything, but for some people, just the novelty of a different perspective is enough, when in reality, the game's fundamentally the same, which makes the whole thing pointless.  So really, there isn't any point in doing so, unless there's enough justification for a radical approach just to change a long-standing tradition."
Metroid,377zts,fusionsuitpika,2,Wed May 27 07:20:44 2015 UTC,"Well, having Zelda as the main character might actually make the game play a lot more differently, seeing as how Zelda is much more of a mage character.  It could deal more with using spells and stuff to attack enemies, and not going ""in the fray"" as much; the only magic that Link has used either just powers up his sword swings or acts as AOE attacks or utility stuff (warping out of dungeons, etc.), so Zelda could have a much different repertoire in comparison."
Metroid,377zts,SomeMetroid,1 point,Sun May 31 15:54:51 2015 UTC,"Oh don't get me wrong. I'm okay with having Zelda for stretches of the game, just to show a nice juxtaposition with Link and his adventures. However, at the moment, I can't come up with any justification to make Zelda the only playable character in a mainline game. Maybe because there's no concrete justification that the progression's going to be different (Sheik being the one moving across dungeons), or maybe because there's no justification in the story (the Zelda team has implied some romance in Skyward Sword, but they have yet to outright state Link and Zelda's relationship beyond that, so I don't see why Zelda would all of a sudden just save a lowly soldier like Link).  TL;DR: While I'm not opposed to Zelda being the main playable character in a mainline game, consider me skeptical at the moment, because I just can't come up with a sound justification to make her the lead. I feel like her being the lead would only cause more problems for he Zelda team, as they now have to come up with reasons to justify all the problems that come with radically changing a almost-30 year old series."
Metroid,377zts,fusionsuitpika,2,Wed Jun 10 21:40:47 2015 UTC,"It's not as if I'm suggesting having a whole mainline Zelda game be redesigned around having Zelda as the MC.  I'm not even suggesting that they have to do some shit where she has to save Link or something.  They could just experiment by making a 3DS game and not devote nearly as much time to it, like how MP: Hunters was a side project meant to create a unique multiplayer experience rather than be a mainline game.  I think one of the main problems with Zelda, and Mario, and some other mainline Nintendo series that some people perceive is that there's a general lack of true variation, and what variation is there is often seem as shallow gimmicks.  People often see Zelda or other Nintendo series like Pokemon and see ""Oh, it's Link swinging a sword again, but with motion controls.  Yippee.""  Or ""Oh, it's just Pokemon battles with Limit Breaks.  Yawn.""    Instead of seeing a decades-old series that's improved upon or expanded it's base gameplay while remaining true to it, they see a stagnant reskin of previous titles with stickers slapped on, with no actual differences in gameplay that make it a unique experience (of course, when actually playing some games, this is obviously not the case).  As a result, people often suggest radical changes because they feel like Zelda, or Pokemon's, or Mario's formula has become old news.  TBH I can see where they're coming from at times, especially with the recent Super Mario 3D Landmass or NSMB games.  Also, it's just fun to wonder about hypothetical games and scenarios.  It's not like anybody's saying ""They NEED TO MAKE THIS GAME OR METROID IS DEAD"" it's just fun speculation/thinking.  A more survival-horror metroid game would be kinda fun.  Nobody's required to absolutely justify the funding and time spent to make such a game in order to casually discuss anything about it or ideas associated."
Metroid,377zts,fusionsuitpika,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:22:02 2015 UTC,"I assumed that you wanted a mainline Zelda game to have Zelda as the main playable character, when in fact you only want Nintendo to experiment with a aide project. Sorry!  As for the rest of your reply, I agree with most of it. I think one of the biggest problems that people have with Nintendo is related to brand consciousness. Like you said, if they see Mario or Pokémon, they assume that it's pretty much the same thing for the past 20-30 years or so. While there's some merit to that, what they don't consider is the fact that the company cannot completely change the formula for the mainline games, as all audiences (""casuals"" and ""hardcore"" gamers; god I hate using those terms) gravitate toward those games. They're limited to the confines of tradition for the mainline games as people already have a number of expectations for them, whereas they can experiment more on lesser-known titles (e.g. Kirby games, Super Metroid to Metroid Prime) because the backlash for completely changing the formula wouldn't be as bad as radically changing what makes a mainline Zelda game what people associate it with.  Anyway, I'm okay with hypothetical scenarios, as long as the idea seems reasonable enough. A survival-horror Metroid game would in theory work, given how there are some aspects of the games that have it (e.g. G.F.S. Valhalla). However, if it's something akin to the suggestions of the OP of this thread (e.g. have a GF trooper track down Samus, whilst getting power-ups along the way), then I'll have a ton of problems with it, because it undermines the established norms of the series while at the same time unleashing a plethora of problems and contradictions that weren't there in the first place.  Edit: spelling and autocorrect"
Metroid,377zts,fusionsuitpika,0,Thu Jun 11 04:22:10 2015 UTC,So you don't think Link has starred in enough games? Hyrule Warriors didn't teach you that other characters are fun to play as as well?
Metroid,377zts,FriendFrog,2,Wed May 27 21:32:34 2015 UTC,"No. Hyrule Warriors is not a mainline Zelda game. The characters may be fun to play as, but when the progression's fundamentally the same for all mainline Zelda games, what's the point in changing the characters? To pander to a smaller audience? To prove that Nintendo's ""forward-thinking""? Those are horrible reasons to change things up, and only reek of desperation on Nintendo's part.   You're trying to come up with a solution to a problem that's nonexistent. In fact, by doing so, you're just creating even more problems. So is the Metroid team just gonna give power-ups to GF troops? How does that even work? The point of the GF troops is that they're so incompetent that they have to rely on bounty hunters like Samus (Space Pirates are more competent, but they're still no match for Samus).  How are you even going to justify the story? What's the end-game here? Samus gets captured in the end? Let's not forget that she's quite possibly the most powerful being in their galaxy. Her suit's power is equivalent to that of a nuclear plant. Let's not even talk about her power-ups, because even the smartest Space Pirates cannot replicate the morph ball properly.  Unless you can justify changing Link to Zelda for the whole game, or Samus to a GF trooper, then there's no point. You could switch between the different characters at various parts of the story (see: The Witcher 3), but because the storytelling motifs, gameplay mechanics and progression are consistent throughout the lifetime of the series, then what's the point in changing the whole thing up?  I'd much rather they try to get back the goodwill that they lost by creating Other M by releasing a game that  1) doesn't contradict the rest of the game's almost-30 year legacy   and 2) doesn't contradict what we've already known about Samus for that time period  Just create a game where Samus does what she does best: exploring areas alone, saving civilisations, beating the fuck out of Ridley and the Space Pirates, and just being a general badass with a heart of gold. The hardcore fans will buy that shit up.  Edit: clarification of a few things"
Metroid,377zts,flaahgra012,1 point,Wed May 27 22:25:30 2015 UTC,"Innovative or die. If I wanted a same old Metroid, I'd replay super. They absolutely should not allow their franchises to get stale."
Metroid,377zts,Commkeen,1 point,Fri May 29 03:14:17 2015 UTC,"You didn't even address any of the points that I made. Great fucking job.  Samus having a little sister? GF troops getting power-ups just so that they can match up against the strongest bounty hunter in the galaxy? Retconning a whole 30-year series just because you want to start anew? Thank the heavens you're not a part of the Metroid team. Or maybe you are, since those ideas of yours would have fit Other M."
Metroid,377zts,Stealth_Jesus,-1,Fri May 29 04:19:44 2015 UTC,people want someone like Zelda to be the playable character.   It's either that or a female link. It's just some obtuse feminist thing about wanting more female protagonists in action videogames.
Metroid,377zaj,heart-station,6,Mon May 25 16:59:04 2015 UTC,"I prefer the isolation, honestly. The scan visor is a great way to tell a story without forcing it on the player.  However, as to your other point, I wouldn't mind a few recurring characters. Anthony Higgs for example was a bright spot in the mess that was Other M's story. He was a good character, and from what I understand quite a few others liked him as well. I'd be totally okay with him making a return, if the next Metroid is to be more story-based."
Metroid,377zaj,Koog330,1 point,Tue May 26 14:00:04 2015 UTC,"What was great about the Scan Visor is that it's a way of picking up the pieces of a place that was ravaged without relying on flashbacks and cutscenes (although I know they did maybe one or two in Prime 2, but hardly that many to take away from the game). I love that it leaves it in the hands of the player, rather than forcing them to sit through character development.  I wouldn't mind if the expanded on this in an alternate kind of way, though. Perhaps they could have Samus exploring multiple worlds, and you could also choose to accept missions from characters with specific directives (taking out specific fleets, retrieving certain hidden items, etc). With these sections could have Comm conversations that flesh out these extra characters. They could be optional challenge missions, and would be a nice way to still leave development in the hands of the player, rather than forcing a character to be central to the story or making the game more linear to develop a character as needed. That way, if you want to just experience Metroid in a traditional, isolation experience, you can, but if you want to engage in some other characters who want Samus' help as a bounty hunter, you can experience that, too (so long as it's well written and not overly drawn out)."
Metroid,377zaj,Butter_Is_Life,5,Tue May 26 20:08:12 2015 UTC,What's with you and giving Samus a sister?
Metroid,377zaj,FriendFrog,2,Tue May 26 00:42:36 2015 UTC,Why do you hate sisters?
Metroid,377zaj,FriendFrog,1 point,Tue May 26 00:50:59 2015 UTC,I don't. I just don't see the value in rewriting Samus' backstory of being orphaned at 3 to include a character that was never mentioned before & serves no clearly-defined purpose.
Metroid,377zaj,Deezer509,2,Wed May 27 02:16:24 2015 UTC,Agreed.  You can introduce a sister-like figure without retconning the backstory.
Metroid,377zaj,FriendFrog,2,Wed May 27 17:19:40 2015 UTC,"I think if anything it could be a better idea to introduce a daughter-like figure a la Newt, since Metroid already rips-off a ton of things from Aliens. (I still don't know what the point of it would be)"
Metroid,377zaj,begrimed,3,Wed May 27 18:53:35 2015 UTC,"A tiny metroid that follows you around and can do small tasks like retrieve out-of-reach pick-ups, act as a small energy reserve for Samus, slow enemies down or kill smaller ones, etc., sounds a lot more believable (and frankly, enjoyable) as a companion/sister/daughter/whatever to Samus."
Metroid,377zaj,KarjarA,3,Thu May 28 00:07:51 2015 UTC,"I want the new Metroid U game to be with more optional paths and areas, and I think prime storytelling with scans fits perfect. You can get invested if you want to, scanning everything, or you can just enjoy your Metroid game."
Metroid,377zaj,Laureolus,2,Mon May 25 20:35:41 2015 UTC,"If there's one then more sentient being who isn't a space pirate, you've done it wrong and should go fix that."
Metroid,377zaj,begrimed,2,Tue May 26 16:11:23 2015 UTC,I think adding too much narrative is what warped Metroid at its core and turned it into the weird mess it is today.
Metroid,377zaj,Chip--Chipperson,3,Tue May 26 23:27:58 2015 UTC,"who cares about story, bring on the puzzles."
Metroid,377zaj,doctorvonscience,1 point,Mon May 25 18:26:38 2015 UTC,"I don't care about story.  It usually distracts from the game, and it's way too easy for developers to get caught up in telling the story and putting too much exposition/cutscenes/whatever, which really quickly bogs down a game.  I almost always find myself just pushing buttons to skip through dialogue so I can get back to playing, especially on repeat playthroughs.  Adding more cast members means adding more dialogue to explain who they are, which means more I have to skip to get to the actual game, so I'd be against that too.  Just give me Samus on a planet with things to shoot and gear to find, and some kind of end objective.  That's all you need."
Metroid,377zaj,Deezer509,1 point,Wed May 27 00:00:42 2015 UTC,"I like that you preface this with ""assume it's not Another M situation.""  Because that game did so much damage to the franchise (in my eyes).  Honestly, I would like to see a follow up to Fusion.  You can still have the exploratory gameplay that we all know and love, and still add a mystery story to it.  Put Samus in a new decimated environment that is (seemingly) abandoned and have her piece together the clues.  It wouldn't be that hard.    Back before Other M came out, I would have said that I'd like to see an origin story.  A child-to-teenaged Samus living with the Chozo and learning their badass ways.  But now?  I think that idea would ruin Samus even more than she's already ruined."
Metroid,377zaj,flaahgra012,1 point,Wed May 27 17:23:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly the Metroid series has a great story without being particularly focused on storytelling, there are interesting characters like the 3 bounty hunters in corruption that the game makes you care about despite their little dialogue and the lore found through scanning and just general gameplay is a really cool way to tell the story, in my opinion the prime games did it perfectly and the series as a whole has done a great job of giving samus a personality despite her having little to no dialogue depending on the game, Other M's story was a failure not only because it was horribly written, but also because that kind of storytelling wasn't needed in the Metroid franchise to begin with  tldr: Lore > direct storytelling (in the case of Metroid)"

Metroid,373enk,begrimed,2,Sun May 24 19:59:05 2015 UTC,I heard about retroid but cannot find any info on it  Got any links or threads about it?
Metroid,373enk,Gyper,1 point,Mon May 25 03:31:58 2015 UTC,"No info thread for Retroid was ever made; the devtalk for it only took place in #metconst. The creator isn't working on it anymore either, though I don't know yet if that's truly permanent. He tasked me with finishing and releasing it someday if he never does resume, but finishing it will require ASM that I currently know embarrassingly little of, for as long as I've been doing this. It'll have to wait until I can do it myself, or until I can offload that portion of work onto some other, poor, smarter soul than myself."
Metroid,373enk,begrimed,1 point,Mon May 25 04:35:10 2015 UTC,Didn't you make project base?  I'd imagine you would be pretty well versed in ASM honestly. :V
Metroid,373enk,Gyper,1 point,Mon May 25 07:06:18 2015 UTC,"Right? I can look at raw hex or .ASM files and see what the code is doing, understand it to an extent, make pointed edits, remove portions, bend it around, stuff like that. It's just constructing new code from scratch that still eludes me because I haven't seriously dived into learning about the 65816 processor itself, outside of the context of editing Super Metroid. I'm a slow learner, and tend to lean on the skills I've already got whenever I decide to hack the game for awhile, instead of putting my hacking progress on hold to work on my... hacking."

I don't really know about Super/Fusion, but a lot of love goes out to both Echoes and Corruption. Prime is the clear popular favorite of Retro's games, yes, but I feel like the opinion of Echoes is very polarized; you either love it or you hate it. Alternately, Corruption is just really moderate - it's not bad, but I've yet to see someone praise it above Prime."
Metroid,370rtx,owenator1234,6,Sat May 23 21:34:25 2015 UTC,I like Corruption a bit more than Prime
Metroid,370rtx,snesknight,9,Sat May 23 23:12:22 2015 UTC,"Corruption was really good, it had a lot of fun moments, fun bosses, and interesting characters. The problem I felt was the music was pretty bland for about 85% of the game, and a lot of the scenery felt the same aka boring. I really enjoyed the ideas it had, such as the Plasma canon, and the Acid Rain Hazmat shield, but overall I felt it wasn't as strong as the other two"
Metroid,370rtx,SarcasticRidley,7,Sat May 23 23:57:26 2015 UTC,"music was pretty bland   Apparently Skytown and Bryyo weren't good enough. Apparently Xenoresearch and Valhalla weren't terrifying enough. Apparently Norion and Urtrag's themes didn't feel enough like military bases.   a lot of the scenery felt the same   Have you played Metroid Prime?  Corruption has more variety in scenery than Prime does. It has ice parts, fire parts, steampunk sky city parts, jungle parts, cliff parts, scary spaceship parts, acid rainworld parts, Phazon planet parts, GF military base parts, and the insides of Leviathans. What does Prime have? Fire, ice, a temple, and a mining site. That's it."
Metroid,370rtx,128polygons,3,Sun May 24 02:41:49 2015 UTC,"If you're gonna do it that way, you should do it fair and even.  Prime 1 has a pirate ship part, jungle part, ruins part, lava part, mining part (fire themed), ice part, pirate research lab part, submerged ship part, shrine part, crater temple part, mining part (phazon themed), and Metroid Prime lair part."

But I personally think your going to enjoy Corruption better, because of the way it's structured. It plays itself like fusion in a way, guiding you towards areas whislt still being able to explore at a moderate pace."
Metroid,370rtx,owenator1234,3,Sun May 24 03:10:42 2015 UTC,"I really missed the switchable beams in Corruption. New beams in 1 and 2 felt like new puzzle solving items where a new beam in Corruption was just, or I can do this now while only adding damage to the combat. I personally loved the wiimote controls and love trilogy for adding them to 1 and 2."

Metroid,370rtx,powermad80,3,Sun May 24 04:15:27 2015 UTC,"Seriously. People don't see how great we have it! Look at Zelda! Ever since Ocarina of Time it's basically the same game. Wind Waker, Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword are all Ocarina of Time sequels, not Zelda sequels."
Metroid,370rtx,InsanityRaptor,8,Sun May 24 04:11:17 2015 UTC,"Twilight Princess is the only one that's really similar to Ocarina of Time. Wind Waker and Skyward Sword shook it up a bunch, you say Skyward Sword was too similar to OoT and Zelda fans will look at you funny. And even then Twilight Princess was great."
Metroid,370rtx,powermad80,1 point,Sun May 24 05:00:41 2015 UTC,Hey. When I say like Ocarina of time I mean both Skyward Sword and Ocarina are linear as hell. That's not really Zelda.
Metroid,370rtx,InsanityRaptor,5,Sun May 24 05:06:48 2015 UTC,"That's actually kind of series standard, big open worlds but with a linear progression, the only two nonlinear games in the series are the original NES Zelda and the 3DS Zelda A Link Between Worlds. In fact, Skyward Sword is a polarizing entry in the series, and many of the complaints about it center on how it's too different from the traditional Zelda model among other things, especially compared to Ocarina of Time.  And besides, linearity isn't inherently a bad thing, being linear allows for tight focus and level design, and solid control of progression and difficulty curve."
Metroid,370rtx,powermad80,-3,Sun May 24 05:17:55 2015 UTC,"Ok. But. Zelda is an exploration game right? ""...big open worlds but with a linear progression..."" is the complete opposite of exploration. Which games is the first Zelda game? Zelda one of course. Just because Ocarina started the linear-ness doesn't mean EVERY single game should be that way. I get that a game being linear can make it easier for story progression, but that's just the problem. The Zelda devs always take the easy way out. Imagine if Other M just became the pinnacle of Metroid forever. Nintendo always made games like Other M from now on. How stupid would that be?! Zelda should be about adventure a huge part about Zelda and adventure is exploration. A tour isn't an adventure. The bottom line about Skyward Sword and Ocarina is that they're both tours. Zelda one was crazy! You could get to one of the hardest dungeon as your first challenge. Exploration is what started Zelda and carried it through the NES and SNES era. Why abandon that for 4 fucking generations of consoles."
Metroid,370rtx,InsanityRaptor,6,Sun May 24 05:28:11 2015 UTC,"Just because Ocarina started the linear-ness doesn't mean EVERY single game should be that way   Ocarina of Time didn't even start that, A Link to the Past did - the game considered by many to be the quintessential Zelda experience. It's the third game in its series after the different and unusual 2nd one that didn't work out as well, not too far from Super Metroid's position - they're both the third game in their series (and on the SNES too) that are considered to be the games that define their series. Zelda isn't an ""exploration"" game first and foremost, it's an adventure, a quest to power up and vanquish evil. Yes, exploration is a big part of it, but the game doesn't have to be all nonlinear to allow that. The story progression and dungeon order are linear, yes, but you can still explore the big world all you want with all your gear and find so many secrets, whether they're beneficial to gameplay or not. Heck, I could say Metroid games are technically linear in the same way Zelda games are, despite the huge sprawling world there's a definite order that things are to be done in, you can't find and fight Ridley right off the bat same way you can't fight Ganondorf within the first hour of the game - you have to go find all the powerups, upgrades, etc. and clear areas to progress to that point.  And that's really stupid comparing all OoT-onward Zeldas to Other M, they aren't even remotely comparable. Not every game has to be some nonlinear adventure, and to counter your point, just because Zelda 1 did the nonlinear thing doesn't mean every game has to be like that. I think it's actually a flaw with Zelda 1, it's directionless and crude, being able to bumble into the hardest dungeon of the game at the beginning is not something I'd say as a compliment to a game. A linear game is not a ""tour"" and Ocarina of Time/Skyward Sword are not at all ""tours,"" they're just games that aren't centered around being dropped directionless into a world, you sound like you want Zelda to just be a clone of Metroid. A linear game does not make a ""tour.""  And continuing to talk about Ocarina of Time and Skyward Sword like they're both the same game just proves how little you know about the series, to the more hardcore fans of the series they're as different as night and day. There are tons of people that see Ocarina of Time as the ""Super Metroid"" of the series and Skyward Sword as the ""Other M"" of the series."
Metroid,370rtx,powermad80,1 point,Sun May 24 05:40:06 2015 UTC,"Ok first off, I wasn't comparing Ocarina of Time onwards to Other M. Did you even read my post? I'm not convinced you did. Other M is linear. Fact. Ocarina of Time is linear. Fact. Super Metroid wasn't linear. Fact. Think of this. You can get to Kraid early. As in before getting the high jump boots. A Link to the Past is linear. Fact. Buuuut. Every single human being knows exploration is required to beat it. Also I never said that every Zelda game has to have only exploration. I just said maybe they could stay true to the original while expanding on it, like they did with Super Metroid."
Metroid,370rtx,InsanityRaptor,5,Sun May 24 06:02:24 2015 UTC,"Did you even read my post? I'm not convinced you did   I did, but you got incoherent and rant-y about halfway through so I might have misunderstood a few things. I'm also kind of suspecting that you're just letting nostalgia cloud your views on old vs. new zeldas.   Buuuut. Every single human being knows exploration is required to beat it   You can say the same for Ocarina of Time though. For example, A Link to the Past literally points out on the map where all the dungeons are, even conveniently numbering them in the order you need to beat them in. However, as you know you still at some point need to go out on your own to find the zora flippers so you can swim, which is required to progress. In the same vein, Ocarina of Time makes it clear what area you're supposed to go to next, but at some points you need to go find something for yourself without the game telling you where it is, like for example in Zora's Domain you have to go and find the bottle with Ruto's note in it for yourself. Or in Majora's Mask to get to the fourth and final area you need to somehow figure out that you need the ninja mask to get to the area which is owned by two suspicious horse racers by the farm that you need to race to get the mask, all without being even slightly hinted at.  A Link to the Past is the game that defined the Zelda formula, and even though you don't think so, every further game has expanded upon it while staying true to that formula. That formula is a big open world with plenty of secrets to go around with a linear progression in the plot and dungeons, progressively acquiring new tools and powers to aid combat and exploratory abilities. Look at all the new Zeldas and they do indeed follow this formula faithfully while adding their own polishes and quirks."
Metroid,370rtx,trillyntruly,1 point,Sun May 24 06:12:30 2015 UTC,"Well just so we're clear. I'm not even old enough to have had nostalgia with Ocarina of Time, let alone Zelda one. Oh and don't get me wrong, I don't think Ocarina defined the formula, I just think it perfected it. So yeah. I agree. I want Zelda to go back to the first one, not the third game. But that doesn't mean I think that linearity has no place in Zelda. I just think that maybe we could do with a little less linearity. So um. Yeah! This was actually cathartic. You made me realize somethings I didn't realize myself. Thanks for keeping me company as I slave away doing nothing at 2:30 in the morning. :D"

Metroid,370rtx,deadandmessedup,2,Sun May 24 13:17:17 2015 UTC,"Obviously the series needs to shake some things up in order to not get too stale, however it needs to do the right things too. None of the three you mentioned have any damning changes and they're all at the very least decent installments, but things like the removal of beam switching in Corruption or the addition of beam ammo in Echoes just feel like they restrict you more than previously or take depth out of the game for no reason, which is obviously no fun. Something I'm really not a fan of which Fusion, Hunters, Corruption and Other M are all guilty of is disconnecting zones from each other, it needs to feel like one big world imo, don't put everything in boxes like that, that's not far from just labelling certain sections as Stage 1-1, Stage 1-2, etc.  I feel like the difference between Super Metroid and Zero Mission is how I ideally want things to progress, at least as far as the sidescrollers go. Maybe not as similar as in future games likely won't take place on the same planets, but you get the idea, they play and feel very differently and Zero Mission added a new and enjoyable scenario with the Zero Suit escape, things like that helps keep it fresh. I also liked the idea of Hyper Mode in Corruption, unfortunately they just didn't balance it properly and it ended up being way too overpowered, but as far as the concept goes it's great."
Metroid,370rtx,deadandmessedup,1 point,Sat May 23 22:11:58 2015 UTC,"For sure. I think those kinds of complaints only work if the flaws demonstrate design problems - as opposed to things just being different. Although I prefer Super, Fusion is still a blast, and its more direct paths make sense given the context of working with a duplicitous AI.  Corruption and Echoes... they're a lot of fun, for sure, but I do think some of their design changes go past being ""different"" and actually decrease the pleasure of gameplay. E.g. playing follow-orders for the first hour of Corruption, finding the keys to fight the bosses (instead of just progressing to them) in Echoes."

In the Prime series, it's sort of ""put bomb here then use the thing that just opened/activated to get to another place for a bomb"" or ""use a visor to see something to shoot, shoot the thing.""  In Prime 3, the grapple is used in a new way to pull blocks, but it wasn't utilized in a puzzling way and could have been.  More puzzles like Zelda games or Golden Sun where you had to use your special abilities, but weren't simply time-wasters (like Golden Sun's puzzles were).  I like the more horrifying aspects of Fusion, where each encounter with SA-X is harrowing and tense as you're trying to hide or flee, kind of like how that big black time demon thing would occasionally chase you in Prince of Persia Warrior Within.  I know they're kind of trite, but I think Metroid would benefit from some jump scares and some more graphic death scenes, like when Samus encounters the GF troops on Aether."

Personally I feel like having a map in front of you the whole time would significantly hurt the feeling of exploration, which is kind of a big deal in a metroid game.  Having said that, there is no shame in looking at a map if you get stuck someplace."

Metroid,36x2i3,V0ID115,8,Fri May 22 20:49:52 2015 UTC,"Figure I might as well just copy and paste what I just said in an earlier post.  Regarding sequence breaking, I'm not sure exactly sure how it contributes to Metroid. I rarely sequence break, I've done a few in Zero Mission and Prime but I don't get much out of it. Some complain about sequence breaking being removed from the Metroid Prime Trilogy versions, but this never bothered me, because the Prime games (not as much in 3) were still very open in exploration, or at least it felt like it was.  I don't think sequence breaking is the most important factor to Metroid and the feeling of exploration. I think the most important factors are not being told where to go, and having the option to deviate from a path or backtrack with rewards for incentive. Sequence breaking does add to Metroid though, especially in replayability and speedrunning, and maybe I sequence break more often than I think and just don't realize it, but exploration and getting items and upgrades is enough for me to have a good time in Metroid. When I'm being told where to go (and thus, not isolated and no longer exploring) and I can't explore at my own pace, or even backtrack, it no longer feels like an adventure on an unknown world, which I think Metroid should be."

Metroid,36x2i3,Jammintk,2,Sat May 23 11:35:40 2015 UTC,"I think the discussion is largely academic. On one hand, sequence breaking is explicitly going against the developers' intentions in most games. You aren't supposed to be able to side hop off the ship in Prime 1 to get the double jump, for example. On the other hand, though, sequence breakers, TASsers, and speed runners put a lot of work into finding these exploits and using them to do some insane stuff. Its a shame that these glitches (that most players never even see in the first place) get fixed or patched out in later releases. In a way, it would be cool to keep these kinds of bugs, glitches, or exploits as an archive and allow players who are using the modern versions of the games to keep speed running them with higher graphical fidelity.  The best possible solution is simply to allow a player to go into a debug menu of some sort and roll back the patches made to these games when possible. In the case of MPT, though, I wouldn't be surprised if enough work had to be done to the first two games that it wouldn't be possible to roll back those changes. In the case of other games, for example The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time on the Wii virtual console, there's not really any reason Nintendo couldn't include versions 1.0, 1.1, AND 1.2 in the package as either separate downloads or as a debug switch as long as some disclaimer was made to the layperson saying ""some bugs or content was changed between 1.0 and 1.2, here's a list of changes. Your save won't transfer between versions. Do you want to continue?"""

It's sort of a sense of ""I've out witted the genius at his own game"" (pun completed intended ;) ).

Many problems people, including me, have with the general plot of Other M are due to the fact that canonically, the fact that Other M happens first makes pretty much every decision Samus makes and shock she feels during Fusion stupid as hell. Why the hell is she surprised by anything in Fusion when this all literally happened already? Other M makes Fusion's story worse by association. Beyond that though Other M has many other problems that Fusion did not have which still make it the worse game. Believe me if Fusion had come out after Other M people would be dumbfounded as to why Nintendo was making a Metroid game with the exact same story as before that wasn't a remake."

Also with Samus and Adam, it doesn't fully explain their relationship and past, which is good I think. Other M's story/Samus and Adam's relationship didn't need to be told and explained, it was fine as it was, just backstory. I feel like leaving things a mystery is much better than explaining and describing something, less is more."

You're given permission to get your powers (granted, Fusion's reason for not having them was legitimized). You're given orders. You're told where to go. And you can't do a damn thing outside of the storyline.  Where is the sequence break there? Or is sequence breaking even a thing we should be using to describe the playability of a Metroid game?"

Sure, on your first time you can kind of blaze through the games without exploring much, but it's when players take the time to slow down that they are able to appreciate all the style and atmosphere (and find a few missile packs along the way!).  The games often encourage the player to slow down and take it all in.  I'm not saying that you're wrong (in fact, I doubt many around here would), just that most Metroid fans subconsciously agree that ""exploration"" isn't the best word, but it's still the one that they simply think of first."

Metroid,36q2zt,bj_waters,1 point,Fri May 22 05:38:15 2015 UTC,"Interesting view on isolation. I feel like it can be deconstructed a bit more beyond just the view and opinion of it, but what it can mean for Metroid's world. I don't think Samus has ever truly been ""alone"" or unassisted in any of her missions. Samus has always had help either from the Chozo, Luminoth, Galactic Federation, or some combination of them. Heck, even one of the darker and more ""isolated"" feeling Metroid games, Prime 2, had a living being help you, U-Mos.  But I feel what set them apart from Fusion, Prime 3, and Other M is directive and how overt it is. With Prime 1 and Super especially, you're only given vague hints at how to progress and open the gateway to the end. Everything else is a matter of you figuring things out. Prime 2 got a bit more overt with the Temple Keys and bosses, but even that was just an extension of Super and Prime 1.   I'd argue that the developers DID put up walls that communicate to the player ""YOU MUST HAVE THIS ITEM/DEFEAT THIS BOSS TO PASS"", but it's done in a way that isn't your only possible objective. You can, like you said, explore and overcome the challenges. But you're doing them alone. Not with being surrounded or running into living beings or blatant messages (unless you really like Prime's hint system, which I usually leave off).   I think the theming of Metroid tends to make people say ""this feels more isolated"" when you're exploring areas that were once lived in, but are now destitute (like Prime 1 and 2, and parts of 3), or are only filled with flora and fauna. Prime 2's mission in particular felt so much more dire because the game did a lot of nice ways to show you that the Luminoth were hanging onto their planet by a thread. The statues commemorating fallen soldiers (or even farmers or other Luminoth who were forced into battle out of necessity), dead Luminoth that once guarding various places are spread all over Aether and Dark Aether, and the single room filled with stasis pods of the Luminoth left. Samus isn't fighting with an army or super computer by her side (no offense to Prime 3 and Fusion), but with only the relics of those who failed what she hopes to achieve. It's bleak, but I feel like that is the deeper definition of isolation that I love to see in Metroid titles. It's not so much that you're isolated from any and all possible life, but that you're isolated from any kind of assistance, whether it's in the gameplay by developer's choices, or by the story and the dead Chozo/Luminoth/GF being your only outside help against the forces before you."

You just get put into this world where you're allowed to go in many different directions and that was really cool.   There was also this whole mysteriousness to it because I never ended up beating the game so whenever I picked it up again I always had that wonder about what the rest of the game could hold, and that makes it very intriguing.

Metroid,36q2zt,LuxShadow1,3,Fri May 22 00:03:29 2015 UTC,"A whole lot of great comments here, which I mostly agree with.  Isolation and player-directed exploration are major requirements for the series.  Isolation manifests in Metroid in a few ways.  From an atmosphere perspective, you're totally by yourself in a hostile environment.  It's not like Zelda, where you transition from the civilized areas of towns and shops to the dangerous wilderness and dungeons, where you're on your own.  Metroid takes place entirely in hostile territory.  Sure, there are save rooms and rooms with no enemies... but these aren't civilized places.  They're more like tiny hiding spaces in a dangerous labyrinth.  There's also the gameplay side of isolation, which is the lack of guided objectives.  Most games nowadays give you fairly explicit instructions for ""this is where you go next"", and all you do as a player is deal with the obstacles along the way.  There's nothing wrong with this - it lets you make a more cinematic game - but after a while it can feel like you're just doing someone else's list of chores, instead of being a hero on your own.  The best Metroid games do away with that.  Since you aren't on the radio with ""mission control"" all the time, figuring out where to go next is a puzzle for the player to solve, just like beating a boss or finding a secret item.  (The Prime games do give you objective markers, but you can turn them off.)  This is true even in Fusion, which is often criticized for its linearity.  Yes, Adam gives you objectives... but as the game progresses, you're frequently trapped in situations where your path to the next objective or navigation room is cut off, leaving you to figure out your next move on your own.  The game reinforces this with the narrative, by teasing early on that Adam might not be trustworthy, and by introducing some tension when you get upgrades that Adam didn't expect.  Horror is also an important part of Metroid.  It's not immediately obvious, but just about every Metroid game has some kind of horror-ish segment.  The wrecked ship in Super, the pirate hideout in Prime, a bunch of parts of Fusion...  Horror goes great with an exploration-based game, because it makes you just a bit nervous to open each new door.  Finally, exploration and backtracking are the classic ""Metroid"" design tropes.  Re-visiting old areas makes the world feel like a real place, instead of a hallway full of one-time scripted events.  Whenever you enter a new room, you might see a weird symbol or a strangely-shaped wall and think, ""I bet there's something cool hidden in this room, but I might not be able to find it yet.""  That builds up anticipation and creates player-driven goals - you want to keep going through the game, not because some NPC gave you an objective, but because you want to see what's behind that wall.  However, there's a right way and a wrong way to do backtracking.  If you look at a map of the ""critical path"" through Super Metroid - the basic path to beat the game, without using speedrun tricks - you'll notice that while you frequently cross your path, you don't spend all that much time actually retreading it.  A well-designed Metroidvania game is built as a series of loops and shortcuts, letting you revisit old areas with new abilities without going back and forth through the exact same series of rooms.  There's a Metroidvania called ""Monster Tale"" on the DS that completely fails to grasp this concept.  Every time you get an upgrade, you have to go all the way to the opposite side of the world to use it, unlock a new area and get another upgrade... only to have to retrace your steps all the way back to where you got the first upgrade.  Metroid Prime has a sequence like this - the Boost Ball-Space Jump-Wave Beam sequence that forces you to make the exact same trip through Magmoor and Phendrana 3 times in a row.  This is such a jarring slog in an otherwise well-designed map that it makes me suspect it was the result of cut content (such as a boss and some more areas in Magmoor)."

You HAVE to explore and get lost so you can find that upgrade that opens that door you saw earlier. It gives you the illusion that you are free, and makes you earn your way.  Meanwhile you venture through detailed and beautiful alien environments, collecting scan data and discovering the secrets each new area holds. The scenery is just wonderful and gives you more than just one reason to explore. You actually feel like it's a breathing living world, rather than another level.  Atmosphere is nearly perfected in the Metroid series. The music, the enemies, the story...they all fit together like this wonderful puzzle that you are immersed in and it draws the player in as well. If it were not for technological restrictions, I feel like the next Metroid game that sticks to the series' guns will look and feel truly amazing (granted they dont overload the screen with lens flares and try and make it look ""next gen"")  I think the greatest part of Metroid just has to be the overlaying concept. Lone bounty hunter Samus Aran takes on a crazy mission and saves (or destroys) the planet. It's literally You vs the World, and it's not all in your face and over the top about it.

Metroid,36q2zt,that_dude_you_know,1 point,Thu May 21 18:27:47 2015 UTC,"The isolation, the exploration, the amazing atmosphere, the crazy attention to detail (at least in the Prime games), the aesthetics, the powerups, pretty much everything except backtracking honestly. If there was a new Prime game with the exploration of the first two and the unique and gorgeous locations of the third, plus a fast travel system, I think I would die of pure gaming bliss."
Metroid,36q2zt,NightOwl58,1 point,Thu May 21 23:45:14 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest thing for me is the organic exploration while still providing a high quality, mostly linear experience (i.e. it's not a sandbox).  While I do like the atmosphere and isolation, most Metroid games tend to have a variety of locals, and I think that's important as well."
Metroid,36q2zt,bj_waters,1 point,Fri May 22 01:03:27 2015 UTC,"Puzzles, great music, and depth. I wish Nintendo could do the cinematic shit they tried to do in Other M correctly. But I don't trust them anymore."
Metroid,36q2zt,DatBankai,1 point,Fri May 22 07:44:24 2015 UTC,"Environment and Exploration.  A game's environment often includes that feeling of isolation, but it isn't necessary, as seen in some of the Prime Games.    Exploration, in a alien world, with the music adding to the intrigue of the game, brings really that feeling of Metroid."
Metroid,36q2zt,VoyagerOrchid,1 point,Sat May 23 01:15:15 2015 UTC,"1. The immersion is probably the most important part of it: areas like Green Underworld in Super Metroid or the last mission in Zero Mission (or every area in Prime 1) really draw you in and make you feel like part of the world, but still feel unique and alien in design. The music has to be a perfect match to the environment; songs like Tallon Overworld are fantastic at combining the familiar with the unknown.   2. The gameplay needs to be satisfying and empowering to the player, whether it's with agile, fast-paced combat in the 2D games, hard-hitting gunplay in the 3D ones, or whatever. (One of the best things about Other M is how visceral Overblast was). The player needs to feel like the strongest bounty hunter in the galaxy, with the freedom to explore things without anyone telling you where to go. (Unless you do something clever like Fusion did and give the player more of a sense of vulnerability, which was a nice change of pace for the series.)  3. Last important element: Super Metroid and Prime 1 were basically perfect from a game-design standpoint. Their difficulty levels were extremely well-balanced, they didn't require excessive hand-holding (Super Metroid didn't require any whatsoever), the pacing was spot-on, each powerup felt like an achievement to obtain (even if it was just a missile tank upgrade), and the story felt completely organic. Super Metroid almost never took the controls away from the player once the story started, and the majority of Prime's story told itself through the player's own scan logs.   I defend Other M from a lot of the unnecessary criticism it gets, but one of the things that weakened it for me is how the plot feels like it's forced onto the player. (Rather telling how you can actually watch Other M as a movie. Prime would never work as a movie, because making it one would ruin all three elements of a Metroid game that I mentioned.)  For the record, Metroid Prime Pinball was immersive with great music, had satisfying gameplay, and was really well-designed. Deserves a lot more credit, even if this wasn't in strikethrough."

Metroid,36n2fc,Comemichiamo,3,Thu May 21 08:51:19 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think it's possible to do ZSS well, but it have to focus on stealth and strategy. It wouldn't be typical metroid gameplay. I think it would work for part of the game, a la Zero Mission. I imagine a post-fusion game, were in the beginning you have to infiltrate a federation ship to retrieve your ability to activate your power suit."
Metroid,36n2fc,randomtroubledmind,7,Wed May 20 22:17:28 2015 UTC,"But the thing about ZSS is that those stealth sections are not what Metroid is supposed to be about. Fusion did it well, and so did Zero Mission, but now it all feels too forced... Is it too much to just ask for a regular Metroid game?"
Metroid,36n2fc,txcrnr,3,Wed May 20 22:32:29 2015 UTC,"True. I guess it depends on if you view Metroid as a genre, and not just a series."
Metroid,36n2fc,randomtroubledmind,7,Wed May 20 22:36:24 2015 UTC,Exactly. ZSS needs to be strictly end-game scene. Other M showed that it doesn't work.

Metroid,36n2fc,ONI_Agent_Locke,7,Wed May 20 18:50:50 2015 UTC,The cutscenes would have been the exact same if she kept the suit on but was just stumbling in it instead. The Zero suit made little difference.
Metroid,36n2fc,henryuuk,0,Wed May 20 20:32:41 2015 UTC,"I'd say it made a difference. It further assassinated the Samus Aran character. What was Samus Aran before? A silent, suited protagonist.

Metroid,36n2fc,mothernaturer,17,Wed May 20 18:12:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think the only game to capture the point of ZSS was Zero Mission. It not only gave you a good reason for it, but also made you feel weak but not a sniveling ""baby"" like in other M. (Haha ""the baby"" joke)"
Metroid,36n2fc,txcrnr,4,Wed May 20 18:26:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ZSS isn't the problem, just other m IMO. We need a good Zamus game to redeem her, I'm really really hyping myself up for one lol"
Metroid,36n2fc,mothernaturer,5,Wed May 20 18:34:14 2015 UTC,Honestly I would love something like Zero Mission. If there is any ZSS at all I don't want to stay that way for long as the power suit is so much cooler.  Also its unrealistic for her to do any of what she does with the suit without it.

Metroid,36n2fc,MonochromeTyrant,6,Wed May 20 17:45:27 2015 UTC,"That sounds awesome. And now that I think about it, why has there never been a game where you actually are a bounty hunter? Why not an open-world FPS where you travel around to different planets, hunting down criminals? Maybe have some space dogfights with your targets, things like that. Idk, I think it sounds awesome. Maybe too similar a concept to Assassin's Creed or something."
Metroid,36n2fc,blamb211,10,Wed May 20 17:48:57 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with that is that the game loses focus with such an idea. Like Assassin's Creed, it becomes something big, tedious, and overwhelming. That said, Nintendo could pull it off, but it may be smaller in scope and scale than what people would expect/want out of such a premise."

Metroid,36n2fc,blamb211,8,Wed May 20 17:56:41 2015 UTC,"I hope they don't do separate planets again.  Part of the fun of Metroid is when you're deep in unexplored territory, you find a door or an elevator, and it takes you back someplace familiar.  Then you go, ""these places are actually connected?"" as your brain does the mental gymnastics to map out the connections you've discovered.

Metroid,36n2fc,CaptainKlamydia,1 point,Thu May 21 00:37:55 2015 UTC,I am currently 1/2 way through 2 and have not got to 3 yet.  I know for 1 and 2 I had to make some configuration tweaks to get them running solid because each one had a performance or visor issue that needed to be setup properly to work.  Prime 1 I remember if I had anti-aliasing on it would drop from 60 to 30 on any section with rain. Also save states are weird.  You can only load from emulation if you load your game since it must have to do with memory allocation else the sound would glitch out.
Metroid,36n2fc,Arisalis,1 point,Thu May 21 17:56:15 2015 UTC,"huh, I only had graphical problems with 3, although yeah i had problems with save states, I would get a weird audio buzzing when i loaded them never found a fix, just used save points"
Metroid,36n2fc,CaptainKlamydia,1 point,Fri May 22 00:20:36 2015 UTC,Yeah if you use a save point and then try loading the save state the audio actually comes in.  I think its because the audio is in memory from the game load which sort of makes sense.  It probably also has to do with if the music is the same from where you load in game vs save state.

When filled fully, DS can do one big attack, but it leaves her open for a good while after. SB(moving)- rises in the air just a little and shoots in the direction you're moving. Think Ike's SB but you can't hold it infinitely  SB(stationary)- weak missiles, slightly faster reload than regular samus' UB-pillar(s?) of phazon DB-same as what you have.  -OR what would be super OP-  NB-changes the hunter she's absorbed from the game. Like the monado arts, there'll be perks and flaws to each character and(perhaps) she can only hold it up for a certain percentage of damage taken. SB-either projectile or dash attack (depends on the hunter) DB-return to DS and push nearby players away by a small amount UB-as normal DS, it would summon pillars of phazon.

It's part of an exercise in practicing actually executing some of the random ideas I have. The helmet I'm planning on doing as a custom paint job + some carved foam detailing over an HJC RPHA-10.  I've also got an old Shoei to practice on. I may replace the foam with 3d printed plastic pieces once I have the shape I want solid as well. Sena's older bluetooth headsets for motorcycle helmets are already pretty close to the shape of one the bubbled 'ears' on the sides of the helmet, so with some paint, foam, and a little ribbed hose for looks, I think the result will be pretty good.  I'm trying to take it a step at a time, so I haven't figured out exactly how I want to do the rest, which is part of why I'd like to have some concept art a little closer to what I'd like to do. It'll likely wind up being a combination of Wonderflex, dyed heavy canvas, and 3d printed additions to existing motorcycle armor - anything attached needs to either enhance the armor, not stick out at all, or be able to break away in the event of a crash."

Metroid,36ijtq,Elusive2000,3,Tue May 19 21:14:56 2015 UTC,"I'd say Fusion is full of these kinds of moments. It's really alone in being the game that really characterizes Samus without going overboard. It's simple, soft, and subtle in how they reveal this character. I absolutely love her short monologues, her reflections on the world around her, which up until that point were always left to the player.   However, outside of Fusion, I'd pinpoint one particular moment that really sticks out in my mind, it's when Samus enters Phendrana in Prime 1 for the first time. Ridley flies overhead but we really only get a shot of his shadow. The evil lurking just beyond the mountains reminds us of its presence as the harsh environment sits right in front of Samus. Yet, she continues on without hesitation.  I've always seen this as a defining moment of Samus as the inevitable, the truth, the destiny that will fall upon whomever is unlucky enough to be considered her target. Fast or slow, at whatever rate, Samus will eventually catch up. Her stoic, unhindered pace is scary.   This endurance that Samus exhibits, not only as a character in a narrative but as a vessel for the player, is a strong representative of the survival and endurance capabilities of the human race as a whole. Samus is that human representative, alone against the dangerous, alien lands she finds herself in, just like humanity against the entirety of the universe."
Metroid,36ijtq,andre3googol,1 point,Wed May 20 20:07:43 2015 UTC,"Great analysis. There really is something about the Metroid franchise that manages to capture the idea ""stoic, unstoppable warrior"" that most games just don't seem to grasp.  While I thoroughly enjoy your idea of Samus representing the human spirit and it's constant battle against the dangerous unknowns that constantly surround it, It leaves me with a query.  Samus's backstory informs us that she was infused with Chozo DNA, making her effectively ""beyond human"". Do you find that that notion detracts from the idea of a human struggle against the forces of nature?"
Metroid,36ijtq,andre3googol,1 point,Thu May 21 09:23:25 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think it does the opposite. The infusion of Chozo DNA is a necessary step for Samus to become who she is. It's very reminiscient of the anticipated ""singularity"" of man and machine, except here it's not machine it's Chozo.  Humanity has survived so long because of adaptation, but not just internal adaptation, but external. We didn't just need survival extincts to survive in the wild, we needed tools, we needed armor. We needed ways to protect our weaknesses. In the very same way, the Chozo infusion enhances not only Samus' strengths as a human, but protects her weaknesses (as does her power suit).  It's like, humans will always continue to adapt and will need to do so to survive, but the option to adapt will not always be human. Making the decision to take that option and then using it, however, that will always be human.  In closing, I don't think being infused with Chozo DNA is ""beyond human."" In fact, I think that's very human. Doing what is absolutely necessary to survive."

Metroid,36dlnq,Elusive2000,4,Mon May 18 22:02:31 2015 UTC,"I'm anticipating a dry year from Nintendo, so I'm keeping my expectations low."
Metroid,36dlnq,zalmute,4,Mon May 18 22:15:04 2015 UTC,I'd hate for something as overdone as a new metroid title to get in the way of something awesome and original like Pokemon Cinnamon Version or Mario Party two-hundred and fourteen.
Metroid,36dlnq,IceAnt573,3,Tue May 19 01:23:00 2015 UTC,I know right? People...
Metroid,36dlnq,SpaceWarriorSamus-,3,Tue May 19 02:15:29 2015 UTC,Sad part is there are more assassins creed games than there are Mario party games. Which means there are more Assassins creed games than Metroid games. What a world...
Metroid,36dlnq,OstrichBurgers,1 point,Tue May 19 18:35:05 2015 UTC,Are we back in the Gamecube era? When have there been that many Mario Party games in recent years?
Metroid,36dlnq,GhostlyPixel,4,Tue May 19 03:27:27 2015 UTC,"Even though I'm all for a new Metroid, I'm really scared of what it might be. :\"
Metroid,36dlnq,OstrichBurgers,9,Wed May 20 07:53:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not speculating any kind of story, my only hope is that they enable an option to use an NGC controller, because I just can't use the wiimote and I'd rather not try on the gamepad."
Metroid,36dlnq,notjustinbailey,11,Mon May 18 15:30:45 2015 UTC,Pro Controller and maybe even 3DS as a controller like in Smash 4 would be pretty interesting.
Metroid,36dlnq,OstrichBurgers,-2,Mon May 18 15:34:42 2015 UTC,"I agree, but people would most likely have an NGC controller over a pro or a 3DS."
Metroid,36dlnq,notjustinbailey,4,Mon May 18 16:29:10 2015 UTC,Though even less people will have an adapter. I hope that those will be restocked either way.
Metroid,36dlnq,fpiceail,3,Mon May 18 18:21:26 2015 UTC,"Oh right I totally forgot you need an adapter, but yeah hopefully, cuz there was literally nothing wrong with the NGC controller."
Metroid,36dlnq,notjustinbailey,3,Mon May 18 20:41:10 2015 UTC,"Yea. I would like a GCN style Pro Controller with an extra Z button and plus minus home, but the same layout."
Metroid,36dlnq,fpiceail,3,Mon May 18 20:51:28 2015 UTC,"Clickable thumbsticks as well. The Wii U Pro controller has those (as do the XBO and PS4 controllers), the gamecube controller does not.  By the way, what you're describing ""sort of"" exists: http://wiiudaily.com/2014/05/gamecube-controller-pdp/  Problem is, its 3rd party and it has to plug into the wiimote. I asked a guy at the local EB games if they are any good (they always have a few stocked there) and he says it honestly isn't very well suited for most Wii U games and you'll have difficulty switching between controllers. Also, I believe it counts as a Wii Classic controller despite the Wii U packaging (misleading, if you ask me) so it probably only works in virtual console games and smash brothers.  EDIT: The picture in the above controller is just a concept, but PDP did make the controllers. They look like this: http://image-cdn.gamnesia.com/18547/test__banner-auto-cropping.jpg  Sadly, it looks like there is no unthemed version, but the input layout is pretty much the same as the one seen in the concept."
Metroid,36dlnq,OstrichBurgers,1 point,Tue May 19 00:41:09 2015 UTC,"Yea, I have seen those and they are classic controllers. And PSA, if you want a GameCube classic controller get a hori battle pad. So much better than the pdp."
Metroid,36dlnq,OstrichBurgers,1 point,Tue May 19 01:06:44 2015 UTC,"Not sure whether you are being sarcastic, but the GCN controller doesn't meet modern standards. It has only one shoulder button, the analog sticks do not click down and there is no select button. That's a serious lack of inputs compared to a modern controller. Not to mention that the d-pad is simply atrocious.  Also, on the original controller, the cord was far too short."
Metroid,36dlnq,Wombo194,1 point,Tue May 19 00:37:20 2015 UTC,"It has an L, R and Z button, and playing the original prime games on the GameCube kinda shows how the controller works great for just such a game. The d-pad isn't all that bad, considering the fact that you aren't even using it all that much in the first place. The only thing I'd agree with is the cord being short. What would the select button be used for?   A plethora of extra buttons isn't great, think of the original Xbox controller, remember the white and black buttons? I literally can't think of a purpose for either of them."
Metroid,36dlnq,OstrichBurgers,2,Tue May 19 15:43:49 2015 UTC,"Game pad is surprisingly not bad, in my opinion. It's just a big controller with a screen on it."
Metroid,36dlnq,LifeWulf,2,Mon May 18 15:35:28 2015 UTC,"I find it would be too clunky! I tried using it for SSB4, and I didn't find it very comfortable."
Metroid,36dlnq,OstrichBurgers,5,Mon May 18 16:28:01 2015 UTC,"Smash is a bad example though. For slower games like Metroid Prime or Zelda games, the gamepad works beautifully, the screen is really helpful if done properly."
Metroid,36dlnq,LifeWulf,2,Tue May 19 00:37:54 2015 UTC,"I said in another comment I believe, I played the wind waker HD version using the gamepad and it was a pretty neat experience, the pad itself was a little clunky, but what it did was pretty cool. Like aiming arrows and displaying maps."
Metroid,36dlnq,OstrichBurgers,0,Tue May 19 15:45:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and my hands and fingers are tiny for a man. My other male friends say it fits comfortably in theirs but not for me.   Also, I'd rather be using the Kinect honestly, at least with that gimmick I can keep looking at the same screen the whole time."
Metroid,36dlnq,LifeWulf,2,Mon May 18 19:07:21 2015 UTC,"I have bug hands and though it fits comfortably, its not as great of an experience to play games like smash with, although with the HD version of wind waker it was alright, with the inventory being on the game pad.  I just hope they have options lol."
Metroid,36dlnq,STIPULATE,2,Mon May 18 20:42:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as a regular controller it's... Alright, although reaching the L/R buttons is kinda difficult, at least compared to the Pro controller. But when it's mandatory I hate it, because my neck is always bugging me, and looking down away from the main screen (which is already a dumb idea IMO) hurts it.   And then my friend tells me ""just hold the controller up then."" Right, because that's an enjoyable experience."
Metroid,36dlnq,OstrichBurgers,2,Mon May 18 21:28:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, the shoulder buttons aren't easy to get to even with big hands, its not the most comfortable thing to hold. But its totally suitable for some games."
Metroid,36dlnq,reali-tglitch,1 point,Tue May 19 15:47:07 2015 UTC,"Just not Super Mario 3D World. I absolutely hated that it was mandatory for some levels, like the Captain Toad ones. Except for the gimmicky platforms that you need to touch to get them to move, there was literally no other reason to use the GamePad. Tilting the thing to move the camera only works if you're not trying to look at the larger 40""+ screen in front of you instead of the tiny screen with terrible contrast and colour reproduction on the controller.   I'll agree though that in very specific situations it can be neat, like multiplayer games (playing as Bowser in Mario Party 10 or the NintendoLand games).  I have not played a single player game that's made it worth taking my attention away from my HDTV though. I can only pray that they do a good job with Star Fox. And won't it have to be optional for that, to include splitscreen multiplayer?  ...It better have splitscreen multiplayer. >.>"

Metroid,36dlnq,bearodactylrapist,2,Tue May 19 04:43:29 2015 UTC,"Plot twist: Gothic-horror Metroid game by Konami, where ""Vampire Killer"" plays while you fight Space Pirates with the Whip Beam. Retro Studios is secretly working on a sci-fi FPS Castlevania. In keeping with the influences the Metroid franchise and the Alien franchise had on each other, the Metroid game is directed by Ridley Scott.  on topic though, it wouldn't be a metroid game without metroids in it, and as of Fusion, Samus is essentially The Last Metroid. Whatever game comes out post-Fusion (it hasn't been officially called ""Metroid Dread"" for years, I'll just go with Metroid 5 for now) needs to be the continuation of that story. Besides the four numbered titles, the other games have been: between games 1 and 2 (the four Primes five if you count pinball pinball was hype), between 3 and 4 (Other M) and a remake of game 1 (ZM). The last true chronological entry was 13 years ago with Fusion, and Super was the last one before that, more than two decades ago.  To put it in perspective, the Metroid storyline in the aftermath of Fusion has basically been left unanswered for longer than Half-Life fans have been waiting for a 3rd game, longer than F-Zero fans have been waiting for a new game, and almost as long as Duke Nukem spent in development time.  Now I feel bad for Mega Man Legends fans. 2000-2015, and still waiting. Kids born when Legends 2 came out should be able to drive by now."

Metroid,36dzys,Sometimeshashiccups,24,Mon May 18 17:52:04 2015 UTC,Balance. It makes them less overpowered. It's not like getting more ammo was even that hard though
Metroid,36dzys,PhazonZim,18,Mon May 18 19:09:07 2015 UTC,"I can see that for the Annihilator beam, but the light and dark beam, to me, didn't seem all that different from the ice/plasma beam from Prime 1."
Metroid,36dzys,Sometimeshashiccups,13,Mon May 18 20:16:36 2015 UTC,Exactly what /u/BigSmashy said. In Prime there are many different elements and environments. In Prime 2 there's only Dark and Light. There'd be little reason to switch out of the light beam if not for the ammo.
Metroid,36dzys,PhazonZim,6,Mon May 18 22:01:48 2015 UTC,"I guess so, though isn't it no different than the plasma beam in Prime 1? Cause I know for me after I get it the only reason I switch to another beam is to open a specific door."
Metroid,36dzys,Sometimeshashiccups,19,Tue May 19 00:20:13 2015 UTC,"Plasma beam is end game, that bit is key. Getting plasma beam in Metroid Prime is akin to getting Screw Attack in Super Metroid. It's really power in part to make backtracking much easier and faster.  Light Beam and Dark Beam are not like that and not meant to be."

Metroid,36dzys,txcrnr,16,Wed May 20 06:07:22 2015 UTC,I always thought the door to the plasma beam in super metroid should have been unlocked and just require space jump or some really good wall jumps to get to. That was the only thing in the game that felt like a real obvious invisible(i guess it is visible in this case) wall that the developers put in instead of thinking of something clever.
Metroid,36dzys,BananaSplit2,6,Mon May 18 17:26:00 2015 UTC,That was the door in Maridia that unlocks after you beat Draygon right? Yeah I can't really come up with an explanation for it.
Metroid,36dzys,-Anguscr4p-,2,Mon May 18 17:36:11 2015 UTC,Because the Plasma beam easily allows to one shot draygon by abusing the X-ray beam. They probably didn't want to let that happen.

It should've been just two jumps to guarantee your exit from the sand, not some painfully annoying hope and prayer that I'd get out.  Quicksand and walljump controls are the only bad thing I can say about Super. Anything else might not be very fair to level against it, like a lack of context sometimes (the Power Bomb glass segment to progress, using the Grapple Beam on that boss in Maridia), or being able to know what powerups you've already collected.

Metroid,36dzys,Skullman7809,16,Mon May 18 17:19:56 2015 UTC,"I could see it as the developers just wanting to keep it simple. A lot of Prime 1 seems like it was restrained so that Retro didn't do anything too crazy since a 3D Metroid had never been done before, so they just stuck with what they knew would work. Then with the massive success of the first they realized they could be more creative with it."
Metroid,36dzys,SenpaiSilver,8,Mon May 18 18:18:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was weak. In Prime 2, the Ing steals your stuff. In Fusion, parts of Samus' Power Suit were removed because of the SA-X infection. There wasn't really any explanation as to why she lost her power-ups in Metroid II and Super.

XOXOXO""  Adam's orders were the worse thing about Other M. As we know Samus from the other games, she seems pretty much independent."
Metroid,36dzys,Skullman7809,8,Mon May 18 18:37:35 2015 UTC,"I could be completely wrong for this, but people's (at least one of) issue with Other M is that Samus is taking orders, which makes sense (at least if I have my timeline correct) as Other M is a time when she was still working largely with the federation. Also her relationship with Adam and the federation at this time are hinted at in Fusion."
Metroid,36dzys,Dirigibleduck,4,Mon May 18 22:32:15 2015 UTC,"If you consider the manga canon, she's not with the federation anymore as a soldier, and she even says that she came because of a distress signal.  So as we know Samus we would assume that she's not just the random dumb girl that wouldn't be able to protect herself because of orders that she doesn't really need to follow (she's not a soldier of a federation anymore). What's the worst that Adam can do if she enables her Varia suit?  I don't think that the problem is Samus taking orders, I think the problem is Samus taking dumb orders or waiting for orders like if she was still a soldier of the federation, because the plot asks for it.  If by largely working with the federation you mean as a bounty hunter (Metroid Prime 3 hints it I think) it seems correct (Timeline) , we see that she was contracted to do some work for the federation (going on SR-388 and the BSL Station in Fusion for example).    Now this is a bit of a rant, so be prepared.  It good to be able to have an idea about who was Adam before he died, but the game seemed more flawed than any other in the series because of what we expect from a Metroid game.  For example Samus isn't a princess that just gets kidnapped and move from one castle to another, instead she's the one that gets things done and creates her own opportunities. She sometimes will be guided (Metroid: ZM, Prime series, Fusion) and sometimes will just make her way without getting guided (Metroid, Metroid 2, Super Metroid).  By reading the timeline, Other M will be the 3rd time she meets Ridley (and it's not the Ridley she used to know, unless we get some Assassin's Creed DNA foolery), or the 5th time if you count Metal Ridley. Why does she get PTSD all of the sudden? Even if she was some sort of Batman, getting PTSD only now seems unnecessary.  I also consider that the Deleter is here just to reduce the numbers of character introduced to the game because the devs couldn't find a way to do anything with them so they decided to just kill some characters one by one. Too bad Adam was too occupied monitoring Samus's video feed and not the other's.  On the gameplay side I'd just say that the way you used missiles was a bit of a flaw. Having to go FPS just to pop a missile in an enemy's head wasn't the best way to do it (same goes for the grappling hook) but then again the wiimote lacks a few buttons for that.  End of the rant, if I get some thing wrong please tell me. This is my own interpretation and it may be flawed too."
Metroid,36dzys,FallingSnowAngel,2,Tue May 19 11:54:58 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with her obeying specific orders in this scenario. Why? Because the Federation got there first. But yeah, most of those orders were dumb as fuck. Let her use the Power + Ice + Wave + Plasma beam from the start, dammit! Or the Varia + Gravity suits! Everything! Powerbombs? Well, those are REALLY dangerous, that one I can accept.  But EH. And yeah, the PTSD thing was kind of stupid. I still enjoyed the crap out of that Ridley fight :_D"
Metroid,36dzys,txcrnr,1 point,Wed May 20 06:05:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link of the timeline, I had an idea of how it went but now how it was fully fleshed out. So even after all the events before Other M, she just now developed a sort of PTSD that isn't even apparent in Fusion? It just seems like an apparent story flaw written in by Team Ninja (or whoever worked on Other M)"
Metroid,36dzys,SenpaiSilver,1 point,Tue May 19 13:29:27 2015 UTC,"It just seems like an apparent story flaw written in by Team Ninja (or whoever worked on Other M)   Thing is, Other M was written by Sakamoto!

Metroid,36dzys,SenpaiSilver,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:11:29 2015 UTC,The reason she obeys his orders is because he has the most powerful gun in the universe :P it can disable Samus's armor in 1 shot! Actually... Why doesnt he go shoot Ridley with his 1-shot kill ice gun?!?
Metroid,36dzys,stupiden-gen-ears,1 point,Wed May 20 16:53:15 2015 UTC,Because the plot asked for it?
Metroid,36dzys,SenpaiSilver,2,Wed May 20 18:59:45 2015 UTC,It happens between Super and Fusion. Which it suddenly occurred to me how extra stupid the orders element is since at the beginning of Fusion she says it is the first time since leaving the federation that she is taking orders.
Metroid,36dzys,Skullman7809,3,Tue May 19 02:13:05 2015 UTC,"That is just a plot hole continuity error in Fusion created by Other M. It also gives you that feeling about the federation is the kind of organisation that will not hesitate to make the same mistakes about bio weapons and metroids.  I can't remember if the BSL Station is a federation station, I can only assume it is because of Adam and the other guy's dialogue in one of Fusion's cutescene.  EDIT: continuity error not plot hole."
Metroid,36dzys,The_M4G,2,Tue May 19 11:58:56 2015 UTC,"Aside from calling it a proactive retcon of Other M, I would say it is more a continuity error in Other M than a plot hole in Fusion."

He takes 30 super missiles or 20(maybe 19?) charge beam shots woth ice, plasma, and wave. Count your shots for whichever method you choose, and when you do the required amount of damage, ball up and let him grab you. He'll die immediately.   A final note for anyone who may be new, or struggling with Phantoon (the real hardest boss in the game:p) DO NOT use supers. he gets super pissed. Just charge shot 12 times to his face."
Metroid,36dzys,Butter_Is_Life,2,Tue May 19 02:16:21 2015 UTC,I would disagree that wall jumping is bad in super. It's really not hard at all and it makes sense. Press away from the wall and then at least a frame or so later jump. It doesn't work when you press both buttons at the same time or if you hit jump first.
Metroid,36dzys,Dirigibleduck,5,Tue May 19 07:17:08 2015 UTC,"I hated Super's walljumping when I first started playing the game, but once you get the timing down, it's so satisfying.

Metroid,36dzys,Butter_Is_Life,1 point,Tue May 19 11:32:29 2015 UTC,"If I recall you could single-walljump in Zero Mission as well. Plus you could press both buttons at the same time, so it felt much smoother."

Metroid,36dzys,SomeMetroid,1 point,Tue May 19 00:50:51 2015 UTC,I honestly feel much more restricted by Super's physics. It's not nearly as tight or quick and I just feel overall less in control when compared to how fluid Fusion and Zero Mission are.
Metroid,36dzys,NightOwl58,2,Wed May 20 04:40:08 2015 UTC,Super metroid wall jumping is the best wall jumping imo.
Metroid,36dzys,SargentMcGreger,9,Tue May 19 16:44:46 2015 UTC,To me the atmosphere of prime 2 and 3 just didn't feel the same as it did in prime. It could have something to do with me playing the crap out of it when i was younger but prime's environment just makes me feel really comfortable and i get really excited when i get to see the next area and just enjoy it again. It seems like areas tie together in seemingly natural ways where as prime 2 kind of had a main hub that connected the areas and three had the different planets that actually did have some openable shortcuts but it wasn't as natural as prime's. Don't get me wrong I love all three but like i said the atmosphere just seems way different in the latter 2.
Metroid,36dzys,AuraRyu,7,Mon May 18 17:58:35 2015 UTC,"That's funny. It's the other way around for me. Prime 1, while an amazing game, felt too similar to Super. It's as if Retro just recreated Super in 3D. In Prime 2, they did a lot of experimentation, which can be seen in Light/Dark Aether. Light Aether's peaceful, calming, sort of like a sanctuary (a lot of hostile creatures, but you get my point), while Dark Aether's suffocating and destructive to Samus' well-being.   Prime 3 could have been great, but the problem is that instead of one planet with vast areas, we got many planets with small areas. It still works, but it's less Metroidvania and more space opera and action movie."
Metroid,36dzys,The_M4G,3,Mon May 18 18:30:13 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that 3 has the strongest environments and location wise is the best of the 3. Being isolated to one planet doesn't really translate as well in 3D. Prime 1 did it fine since the environments were so diverse, but 2 had the Agon Wastes and the whole overworld temple area, which were just plain ugly.   Part of the atmosphere from the Metroid series comes from the memorable locations which evoke an array of emotions at once."
Metroid,36dzys,Butter_Is_Life,3,Tue May 19 02:00:50 2015 UTC,"Fair point. SkyTown, Elysia's a gorgeous location.  I just wish we had a chance to explore the worlds more. My main gripe with Prime 3, aside from the lack of backtracking (which is what makes Metroid... Metroid), is the fact that the worlds feel like they would have been just ""large areas"" had they been in one planet. There wasn't really a sense of ""I'm actually exploring a planet."" Instead, I felt like I'm just exploring another large area akin to a Phendrana Drifts or a Torvus Bog."
Metroid,36dzys,ThreeTwenty320,2,Tue May 19 02:10:17 2015 UTC,"I'd say the strongest environment in the Trilogy was Sanctuary Fortress, hands down, when you're going case by case.  Holy shit that area is beautiful and nice to look at."
Metroid,36dzys,Butter_Is_Life,8,Wed May 20 21:09:01 2015 UTC,Prime's environments bore the hell out of me personally. I've played it 3 or 4 times and I still find myself getting lost simply because a lot of the rooms look the same. And it just feels very forest/desert/lava/ice level-y to me. Whereas Prime 3 and to a lesser extent Prime 2 had really unique locations and I loved that.
Metroid,36dzys,Elusive2000,6,Mon May 18 19:11:35 2015 UTC,"Yea I can kinda understand that, I just love the calm and almost peaceful planet. The different places were different enough but I do agree that individual areas are very similar."
Metroid,36dzys,ThreeTwenty320,8,Mon May 18 20:55:05 2015 UTC,Metroid II having no map.  I don't think having no Screw Attack in Prime 1 made you slow though. The pace was good for me.
Metroid,36dzys,blamb211,3,Mon May 18 18:26:19 2015 UTC,"So excited for A Metroid 2 Remake. It looks very promising. Wished Nintendo just remade Metroid II, seeing that it didn't age well, even though it was a better game than the first one.  Regarding the Screw Attack, having it + Space Jump was a godsend in Prime 2. I just felt like Samus was a bit too clunky, whereas in the previous games, she was more agile."
Metroid,36dzys,GingeousC,13,Tue May 19 00:28:09 2015 UTC,Echoes is amazing and my favorite of the primes but I have to agree with everyone else that the beam system is annoying. It's easy to keep your ammo up but it feels like a needless hassle.
Metroid,36dzys,blamb211,6,Mon May 18 18:31:03 2015 UTC,"I feel like it'd be a lot better if there was some kind of guarantee on how much ammo you get out of shooting an enemy. Like, every enemy would drop a small amount of ammo or something. It's such a pain to clear a room full of Ingpods just hoping you might get some ammo out of them."
Metroid,36dzys,joe_copp,9,Mon May 18 22:17:25 2015 UTC,You'll pretty much always get ammo if you shoot the pods with the beam opposite of what you need (light beam produces dark ammo and dark beam produces light ammo). Finding ammo is never an issue after you get both beams.
Metroid,36dzys,x_kuro,1 point,Mon May 18 23:24:07 2015 UTC,"Eh? Maybe the pickups are just clipping behind walls or something then, because I'll be low on ammo, shoot a pod with the respective opposite beam, and nothing seems to comes out at all."

Metroid,36dzys,FantasticTony,4,Wed May 20 02:46:48 2015 UTC,In Prime 2 I really wish Dark Aether was completely interconnected like Light Aether was. It would cut down the number of times you have to sit through the portal transition cutscene and it would make exploring Dark Aether more interesting.
Metroid,36dzys,Masterofknees,2,Mon May 18 23:31:42 2015 UTC,Wouldn't surprise me if that was at least partly because of memory limitations. Gotta go through the portals to load the area you're about to get into.
Metroid,36dzys,Elusive2000,2,Tue May 19 14:46:29 2015 UTC,"You're probably exactly right. This is probably also why you had the elevator cutscenes in Prime 1 as well, but I always liked those for whatever reason, whereas the portal cutscenes always felt like loading screens to me."
Metroid,36dzys,Masterofknees,1 point,Tue May 26 16:28:33 2015 UTC,"The elevator cutscenes were used for loading, yeah. They did look awesome, but like any loading screen, they did get old after a while."

Metroid,36dzys,breakmanblues,6,Wed May 20 02:44:00 2015 UTC,"My biggest criticisms of Metroid as a series is that it has very little character retention. The Space Pirates have Mother Brain and Ridley, but most members of the Galactic Federation and miscellaneous bounty hunters have all been one-off characters - other than the most hated name in the series, Adam Malkovitch.   Please, Metroid, let the next game have a returning character. Metroid could use more faces identifiable with the series, especially for Smash Bros purposes."
Metroid,36dzys,ArchYourBack145,16,Mon May 18 19:05:18 2015 UTC,"Part of what makes Metroid great is the isolation and the fact that no story or anything of the like stops you in your tracks, take that away and you get Other M (granted a better story would at least have made it decent, but never great.) Metroid doesn't need anymore reoccuring characters, and especially not a supporting cast, because that'd take away from what makes the series unique imo, that's also part of the reason Prime 3 feels kind of detached from its two prequels imo.  Besides, no series should change itself just for Smash's sake, Nintendo's franchises don't exist for Smash Bros' sake, it's the other way around."

Heck, I like him better than any of the bland characters from Hunters since he actually has a personality. Prime 3 could've had memorable characters, but they really didn't have enough time to get fleshed out beyond ""Here's a group of stoics, wisecrackers, etc. They'll die thanks to you soon, but at least Rundas has a cool voice."" Sure, Anthony didn't do much special things either...maybe I just like him because he's the only tolerable character in a game surrounded by fools?"

Metroid,36dzys,DsyelxicBob,3,Mon May 18 21:56:34 2015 UTC,My biggest gripe with the entire series is the ice beam making enemies freeze whilst still floating. I love every Metroid game I've played... (ok maybe not other M but that's also the one that didn't have this problem... could there be a connection?)
Metroid,36dzys,GingeousC,6,Mon May 18 21:50:56 2015 UTC,"The explanation is that it is absolute zero.  The properties of atoms nearing absolute zero cause them to actually overlap each other, which causes atoms that are near absolute zero (see Bose-Einstein Condensate) to become overlapped with air atoms, causing a suspension mid air.  While this might cause it to fall a little, the atmosphere on the planets might be thicker and heavier, which could also be why she can jump so high, like jumping in water."
Metroid,36dzys,d1g1tal_Mantra,1 point,Mon May 18 23:50:30 2015 UTC,"Not saying this is your fault, because I don't know who created that explanation, but that seems to raise even more questions. How on earth (or anywhere in the galaxy, I suppose) do you create a projectile that maintains that temperature of absolute zero throughout its entire path and only transmits that temperature to the thing it hits (but not those that it just misses)? Saying ""the beam makes the thing it hits reach absolute zero"" explains away the floating issue, but it now has created more questions that need answering.  Please don't take this as a shot at you; it isn't. I have just always disliked what I feel to be unnecessary explanations of fictional universes. There's this cool sense of wonder when you don't know why something is the case, which can often be more satisfying than knowing what's going on. Ever heard an official explanation of something (like maybe the Zelda timeline, for example) and thought ""no, that's stupid"" or ""even though you made that, you're wrong""? That's kinda how I feel reading this ice beam thing. I'd rather have a mystery than an unsatisfying explanation."
Metroid,36dzys,CrossFox42,1 point,Tue May 26 16:38:53 2015 UTC,"Well, perhaps the reaction doesn't occur until an impact happens. I'm Prime, the Ice Beam still makes ice on things that aren't enemies, so maybe any impact at all causes two chemicals to mix which creates an extreme endothermic reaction which makes it turn to absolute zero."
Metroid,36dzys,Guru_of_Reason,3,Tue May 26 16:47:37 2015 UTC,"I wish that they'd just make it a Gravity Beam instead, it's pretty silly that ice would also completely negate the effects of gravity. Dark Beam actually didn't have this issue since you can handwave it away as ""dark matter suspension"" or something, so Prime 2 is actually the other one that doesn't have this problem, unless you hate Prime 2 as well. :p"
Metroid,36dzys,powermad80,3,Mon May 18 22:22:18 2015 UTC,"I give Prime 2 that... only due to the dark matter random properties, but I really meant those that have ice anyway. I liked Prime 2 alot. So nope don't hate it."

Metroid,36dzys,smite_of_bloodstone,3,Wed May 20 02:34:35 2015 UTC,"It bothered me how little effort was put into differentiating the Beam Troopers in Prime. They were pretty much just recolors, but Power Troopers had a higher rate of fire."
Metroid,36dzys,luemasify,1 point,Tue May 19 15:09:24 2015 UTC,Woulda been nice if they'd fired their actual respective beams
Metroid,36dzys,sEcKtUr8,1 point,Wed May 20 00:52:44 2015 UTC,"It bothered me how some were blatantly more of a threat than others. Power Troopers took two super missiles and a charge shot or two and then they were dead. Ice Troopers only took a charge shot and a missile before they shattered into a million pieces. Plasma Troopers only took a couple charge shots or a few seconds of spamming the regular beam before melting.  But Wave Troopers... Damn. You have two choices: repeatedly hit them with charge shots to stun them (which wastes your time... so much time), or use the wavebuster on them (which wastes your missiles... so many missiles).  TL;DR Ice Troopers are laughably easy, Plasma Troopers are quick to kill, Power Troopers are fairly quick to kill, but Wave Troopers require you to waste your time to save missiles or waste your missiles to save your time. They're easily the most threatening Trooper (and it doesn't feel like that should be the case)."
Metroid,36dzys,bunker_man,3,Tue May 26 16:44:37 2015 UTC,Super Metroid. Springball (such a late item). Could have been sooner.
Metroid,36dzys,breakmanblues,9,Tue May 19 20:19:37 2015 UTC,"Fusion. I know people love it, but it felt so linear to me. Exploration didn't feel as important especially with someone telling you exactly where to go and what to do.."
Metroid,36dzys,Master_Kenth,1 point,Mon May 18 19:03:55 2015 UTC,For real. Fusion was a great game; it just wasn't a good metroid game.
Metroid,36dzys,infinitys-end,3,Tue May 19 07:17:57 2015 UTC,"I don't get this, why does it have to completely adhere to all the Metroid standards to qualify as a Metroid game? The general feel was still there, Samus was there, as was her usual suite of upgrades and mechanics. Fusion had the guts to go and change some stuff up, take the Metroid formula and do something new and unusual, and damned if it didn't succeed."
Metroid,36dzys,DsyelxicBob,2,Wed May 20 05:07:28 2015 UTC,"Mainly it was how they went out of their way to make sequence breaking pretty much impossible. That is one of my favorite things about the 2D Metroids. If you're good enough at the movement system you can figure out different paths through the game.   There's also that annoying computer that's almost always telling you exactly where to go. I enjoyed being alone in some alien environment and having to explore to figure out what to do.  Like I said, I do like the game and have even finished it many times. It just didn't feel like a Metroid game to me."
Metroid,36dzys,Nararthok,2,Wed May 20 16:28:11 2015 UTC,"I'm on the opposite end; I kind of liked how the computer told you where to go. The reason is because even though it does tell you ""exactly where to go"", they key thing is it doesn't tell you how to get there.  Imagine that I drop you in the woods with a GPS and a set of coordinates that I tell you to go to. Easy; just walk straight there. But Fusion (or Prime's hint system, for which I first created this analogy) doesn't do that; a closer analogy would be if I instead dropped you in a maze with that GPS and a set of coordinates. You know where you need to go, but I haven't taken away any of the fun/struggle of you figuring out how to get to that destination.  This succeeded in taking the ""where the fuck do I go?"" moments out of the game without sacrificing the sense of problem-solving and adventure, which, to me, is a good thing. You may disagree if you liked that sense of wandering discovery, but, of course, to each his own."
Metroid,36dzys,DsyelxicBob,2,Tue May 26 16:51:48 2015 UTC,"After finishing the original NES Metroid, you could play through again with Samus not in her armor.  Super Metroid gives a nod to this via the ""quicker and more complete shows you more of Samus without the suit"", but it would have been amazing to let you play through a second time, sans armor."
Metroid,36dzys,Nararthok,2,Mon May 18 18:05:28 2015 UTC,"I would criticize the fetch quests in all three Prime games. The Chozo Ruin keys in MP1, the Temple keys in MP2, and the battery cells in MP3..."
Metroid,36dzys,DsyelxicBob,2,Tue May 19 02:23:25 2015 UTC,"I love Fusion to death. It's my personal favorite because of its grittiness (although I haven't even finished the first Prime game, so I don't know what's in store there). I've played it countless times, but only beaten it a few. Why, you may ask? Double. Fuckin. Boss fight.  I can get the SA-X down pretty well, method wise, but it's so easy to fuck up the Omega, and the grind through the previous fight just to try again is just demoralizing."
Metroid,36dzys,SomeMetroid,2,Tue May 19 06:37:11 2015 UTC,"Super metroid isn't long enough, and doesn't have good difficulty. Atmosphere is great, but its really not the type of game you'd play through with less energy tanks enjoying the ""hard mode."""
Metroid,36dzys,dagens24,2,Tue May 19 09:24:39 2015 UTC,"For years, the only major flaw of Metroid Prime Trilogy was it being almost impossible to find copies of the game... except it's on the eShop for $20 now, so you don't have an excuse.  Super Metroid is one of my favorite games, but some of the abilities (the custom charge beam combos, moonwalking) are more fun gimmicks than they are actually integral to gameplay.  we have ""Green Underworld"" which sounds really similar to Billie Jean, and we have moonwalking, but not one instance of Samus singing falsetto or throwing hats. Missed opportunity."
Metroid,36dzys,Crobatman123,2,Tue May 19 11:45:00 2015 UTC,"Metroid II was the last Metroid game in the series that I completed fully and I have to say that I disliked it, mostly for it being both too linear and too confusing to navigate, perhaps due to the lack of colors and visual distinctions.    There was a great need for a map. Granted, Metroid 1 was probably more of a maze but I played ZM before 1 so I had the advantage of knowing where things should be.    And about it being linear, I would say it is akin to Fusion in where you gradually explore a new encapsulated area and clear it, but I would like more definite backtracking like in the other games in the series. In MP1 for example, you travel from Overworld to Chozo Ruins, fiddle around in Magmoor, Phendrana, back to Overworld, Magmoor again perhaps etc. The exploration value was off the charts. Metroid II/Fusion was just go to Area 1, then 2, then 3, maybe a should trip back to 2, go to 4, etc."
Metroid,36dzys,powermad80,2,Tue May 19 12:44:45 2015 UTC,"The Grapple Beam in Super is pretty wonky, and all of Tourian and the final Mother Brain fight are completely underwhelming.  Fortunately these things were improved in MZM."

Metroid,36dzys,powermad80,2,Mon May 18 23:58:40 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't see this as a flaw at all, just a difference. It tried and damn well succeeded to be different from the rest, try a narrative, try different design. Linearity allows for very tight level design and focus and I felt like Fusion just pulled it all off so well."
Metroid,36dzys,Ill_Made_Knight,4,Wed May 20 04:42:34 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Fusion (see username), yeah you're right. There's only probably one time you can sequence-break, and it only shows you a secret message. Not to mention, the excessive hand-holding (compared to most games in the series)..."
Metroid,36dzys,Rekwiiem,5,Tue May 19 00:06:12 2015 UTC,It was my first metroid. I love it.
Metroid,36dzys,SomeMetroid,2,Tue May 19 00:09:40 2015 UTC,"My situation's kinda similar. It was the first Metroid game I finished. I got a chance to play I, II and Super when I was a kid, but never finished any of those three. Then something with Fusion clicked (maybe because it was on the GBA, plus it had colour unlike Metroid II), and I've fallen in love with the series ever since then."
Metroid,36dzys,Rekwiiem,3,Tue May 19 00:21:25 2015 UTC,"I never really had much of a chance to interact with the others that much, considering I'm not getting anything VC on the Wii, don't have a Wii U, just got a new GCN, and don't have a SNES. I basically just have Zero Mission and Fusion. And wow, they are fun. Planning on getting Prime and Super sometime soon. I've barely played them."
Metroid,36dzys,EmoryM,2,Tue May 19 00:26:09 2015 UTC,"Definitely get a Wii-U. You could buy I, II, Super, Fusion and the Prime Trilogy on the e-shop (and if you're not in NA, you could also buy Zero Mission now; we're still waiting for the NA release of ZM). The only two games missing are Metroid Prime Hunter (only for the DS, but given that they're releasing DS games on the e-shop, it may eventually show up there) and Other M (Wii game; you can buy it as the Wii-U's backwards compatible anyway).  edit: Not to mention, Metroid Prime trilogy's cheaper on the e-shop than most online copies being sold. So if you're okay with digital, you'll be saving a ton of money by buying MP:T digitally."

Metroid,36dzys,1vs,1 point,Tue May 19 02:11:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I wish Nintendo would release a system that really has power and promise in it instead of just adding minimum HD and a Gamepad to the previous one. While the gamepad makes for some interesting mechanics, you also don't get some of the games that are on Xbone and PS4 because no one like to have to add extra stuff for a gamepad."
Metroid,36dzys,DragonBall_Zack,1 point,Wed May 20 02:39:34 2015 UTC,"It's especially annoying because you can actually reach some areas early (Nettori and Yakuza can both be fought early) but the way fusion is designed stops you from sequence breaking by doing that, because beating the bosses early won't give you their power-ups and it won't change your current objective so the doors will still be locked."
Metroid,36dzys,BlueKyuubi63,2,Tue May 19 10:03:23 2015 UTC,the prime series. I never felt like I was quick enough to dodge any sort of attack. Maybe it's just my timing but I felt like Samus was sluggish moving laterally.
Metroid,36dzys,RidleySmashBros,3,Tue May 19 00:08:24 2015 UTC,Did you know that when you're locked on you can double press B while holding a direction on the analogue stick to dash left or right? Dodging is easy as long as you're locked on. Samus does move quite slowly elsewhere though.
Metroid,36dzys,Praeses47,2,Tue May 19 03:43:27 2015 UTC,"Yea, I used that constantly. It's why I was wondering if it was just my reflexs. I was playing on the Gamecube; I'm not sure if that adds anything to the equation."
Metroid,36dzys,nutella4eva,2,Tue May 19 16:43:04 2015 UTC,"I did that all the time, the problem is that the side-dash seemed to dash just a little less than I needed to actually dodge anything. The Ridley fight in Prime 1 seemed easy until he got totally on the ground and constantly dashed at me. The side-dash just never dashed enough."
Metroid,36dzys,Aplombernulp,3,Wed May 20 04:45:21 2015 UTC,"You're right, she is sluggish, especially with the gamecube controllers. That's why I liked the Wii mote because it was a lot easier to jump, turn, and shoot at the same time.

Metroid,36dzys,Forge_Goreman,1 point,Tue May 19 04:16:31 2015 UTC,Exactly! I felt like no matter how many times I double tapped B to side step any manner of projectile I always ended up taking at least a few hits.
Metroid,36dzys,TheBenjay,1 point,Tue May 19 16:43:41 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I always found it to be intuitive, you just had to time your dashes correctly.  Side stepping too early would make enemies lead their shots or follow you, especially with the Pirates.  Maybe you just need to git gud?  jk"

Metroid,36e3y3,friendless789,1 point,Thu May 28 02:35:43 2015 UTC,"My friend and I had so much fun back in 1987 or 88 when we played through it and made the map together.  He played while I mapped.  I was really impressed how consistent everything was and how everything fit together perfectly.  As we got more and more on paper, it was really cool seeing the whole world reveal itself before our eyes.  We really felt like we accomplished something when we were finished.  It's pretty easy, really.  Each square on the graph paper represents one screen.  Start out by moving to the far left of the first passage you start out in.  Pause and count the blocks horizontally; I think (if memory serves) it's like 16 across and 15 down.  Move to the right till you reach the next screen (the next 16 blocks), pause, and mark it on your graph paper.  I think that first passage you start out in is 3 screens across (but it could be 4, I don't remember exactly).  But you'll see that it works out perfectly.  The blocks that make up the world of Metroid make it really easy to count and map.  Establish some kind of legend (symbols for items and doors), whatever works.  Once you get going, it's quite addictive and absorbing.  Just a couple years ago, I played a Metroid hack and did the same process all over again, so many years later, and rediscovered the original thrill.  Give it a try, it's discovery in its purest form.  That being said, I will say that my all time favorite video game ever, hands down, is Super Metroid.  That is truly the apex of gaming.  But I still adore the original.  Nothing will beat the creepiness of the original Tourian."
Metroid,36e3y3,k8track,8,Fri May 29 14:26:30 2015 UTC,Imho it hasn't held up as well as other NES classics. You'd be playing it largely for nostalgia value and that alone isn't really a great driving force for that game.
Metroid,36e3y3,PhazonZim,0,Mon May 18 22:03:32 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think it has held up well, but today's gamers are too easy to stop when challenged and move on."
Metroid,36e3y3,txcrnr,1 point,Wed May 20 22:38:50 2015 UTC,"The challenge is not what I think the problem is. It's the lack of content. With Zelda there's a lot to see and lots of different scenarios. Metroid's world feels largely devoid of points of interest other than power ups. There are only three bosses and they're spread very far apart. You could get the gist of Metroid 1 by watching snippets of it. You wouldn't be missing much. I didn't feel that way about Zelda, there was lots of content and I felt like every dungeon/area provided me with new and interesting content."

Metroid,36e3y3,txcrnr,2,Thu May 21 10:56:30 2015 UTC,"I mean I'm not saying it's a bad game, but it's a game you have to play with the awareness that it's almost 30 years old. It shows its age. Super Metroid doesn't, and Metroid's contemporaries like Mario 3 and Zelda have held up better mechanically. When I try to play Metroid 1 now I find it unengaging. I don't feel that way about many other NES games.  For the record, I'm 27, and I first played Metroid shortly after Super Metroid came out."
Metroid,36e3y3,PhazonZim,13,Thu May 21 11:00:30 2015 UTC,"yes. but don't be afraid to use guids and maps.  Its really hard, and If I had had those helps back when it was new in 88, I would have used them."

Zero Mission is true to the original in spirit, but it's a very different experience.  I wouldn't call the original a must play.  If you've already played through Super, Fusion and the Prime Trilogy, then you might as well check out the original if you're up for the challenge."

The map is extremely ""samey"" and leads to a lot of confusion about where you are.  From an historical perspective, it's interesting as a comparative case - look at what else was being released around that time and you'll see why it's such a fascinating series.  But man, I wish I'd just watched someone play it instead, because that would have been much more entertaining.  I view it the way I view the original Legend of Zelda in comparison to Link to the Past.  It was improved upon so substantially that the original was rendered unnecessary."

Metroid,36dl7g,Pacalakin,16,Mon May 18 15:23:11 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls - Built around player-driven exploration, doesn't push you down a linear path, tons of secrets to discover.  Batman: Arkham Asylum - Has the whole ""get new abilities and use them to find new paths/secrets in old areas"" thing.  Most people like Arkham City more, but I think the atmosphere and level design of Arkham Asylum is more Metroid-ish than Arkham City and the game is a tighter experience in general.  System Shock 1 and 2 - You're in a dangerous place taken over by evil, you have to explore and master the world to survive, and you listen to audio logs that expose the backstory.  System Shock 1 is my favorite because it's very player-driven (you are given vague objectives but it's up to you to figure out ""what should I do next?"" most of the time), but it can be tough to get into because it's very old and has weird graphics and controls.  System Shock 2 is a more linear ""do the objectives that the voice on the radio gives you"" kind of thing, but a lot of people like it better than 1.  Riven (the sequel to Myst) - Has no combat or action of any kind, but does share some things in common with Metroid.  The game's built around exploring the world of Riven, learning the layout, understanding its history, and solving puzzles to unlock new areas or shortcuts - much like Metroid.  You don't unlock new abilities or items for your character, but you instead progress by learning new things as a player, like how certain devices work or how to read the native writing."

Metroid,36dl7g,Bukkithead,1 point,Mon May 18 22:59:49 2015 UTC,I second this.  The first game especially has lots of underground exploration and great atmosphere.  Exploration is rewarded by you finding parts and junk that can be used to make new weapons.  And there are a few paths that can only be accessed once a specific weapon is unlocked.

Metroid,36eelw,henryuuk,12,Mon May 18 19:56:01 2015 UTC,"Are you really questioning the validity of Smash canon? A series known to take liberties to fit gameplay?   For starters,   Ness and Lucas don't even use PK Fire, Thunder, or Starstorm.  Robin can't use Nosferatu as a tactician and can't hold more than 5 weapons at a time.  Shulk's Monado Arts are just buffs in his own game. Smash made up the idea that Shulk has to trade something in one area in exchange for greater power in another. Oh and the Jump and Smash Arts were created just for Smash.  Game & Watch, R.O.B., Duck Hunt's movesets are entirely made up.  Being lighter and smaller in Smash generally means you're faster. There wouldn't be a significant gap in agility between Link and Toon Link otherwise.   What this means for Zero Suit Samus is that she has to be faster otherwise she would be garbage tier."
Metroid,36eelw,IceAnt573,6,Tue May 19 03:42:13 2015 UTC,I'm guessing they meant within the context of Smash? Because power suit Samus in Smash is a lot slower than ZSS. Which is obviously just a gameplay design choice.
Metroid,36eelw,NightOwl58,2,Mon May 18 19:16:46 2015 UTC,"It says ""Without her suit, she loses most of her firepower,  but can fully utilize the speed and agility that she gained as a child training with the Chozo.""  Regardless of the context of smash, it's just kind of strange that she's faster..."

Metroid,36eelw,Skullman7809,3,Mon May 18 19:58:00 2015 UTC,"From a design and balance choice, it makes perfect sense. She transitions from Medium to really light and agile. A similar comparison would be Zelda/Sheik, from Heavy to Light respectively."
Metroid,36eelw,twinfyre,2,Mon May 18 22:35:07 2015 UTC,"But when they state that removing the suit does this it gives people the wrong idea and is an incorrect fact, like the plasma whip."
Metroid,36eelw,twinfyre,3,Mon May 18 23:22:06 2015 UTC,Chalk it up to the rocket boots. They probably increase her speed and jump height somehow.
Metroid,36eelw,twinfyre,2,Mon May 18 23:32:59 2015 UTC,B-but her Power Suit has a rocket pack on the back...
Metroid,36eelw,MonochromeTyrant,2,Mon May 18 23:41:37 2015 UTC,"Have you ever seen these rocket packs used for agility and flying in the canon Metroid games? From what I remember, they only got use as a speed booster that takes a while to charge. That gameplay feature is useful in Metroid, but it would have no place in Smash Bros since you'd never find a long enough distance to run. And even then, your attack with it would be heavily telegraphed, and easy to counter.   Of course there was also the dodge roll in Other M. But people don't like it when I talk about that game on this sub..."
Metroid,36eelw,MonochromeTyrant,3,Tue May 19 03:05:14 2015 UTC,"1st of all she uses it to jump in Smash, second she uses the gravity booster to dodge in Prime 2 when Quadraxis's head explodes."

The downgrading of the Nipplefister and the Autism-Gun from President evil 7 64/132 was insanely unwarranted. I really liked the parts where you play as Moon Man in the 1860's, but once again, they made the rest of the game tedious beyond all belief. 6.5/10 at best."

Metroid,366o6q,Wei_Tzu,5,Sun May 17 02:26:55 2015 UTC,"breaking it down by abilities, I can't really see a jedi beating Samus. Samus' abilities pretty much negate any special powers a jedi has, and the basic jedi weapon is pretty inferior when compared to Samus' arsenal.   First thing, the Jedi's telekinetic powers. Levitating objects in the battle might do some damage, but with Samus' numerous energy shields, a building getting dropped on her would probably only amount to her losing an e-tank and a half. even so, she's no stranger to navigating broken environments. All she has to do is turn into a morph ball, plant a few bombs, and she's out.  Of course the Jedi could try lifting samus into the air, but as we've seen in Samus' second battle against nightmare in Metroid other M (yes I'm going to that game for examples) the gravity suit (or feature, whatever) negates anything that would hinder Samus' movement short of a brick wall.  There's also the minor stuff like the jedi mind trick and limited clairvoyance, but Samus is not weak minded ( at all) and clairvoyance only really works when it's convenient to the plot. So the Jedi might have a chance if the writer of the fight really wanted them to live, and wanted to see a jedi reenact the plot of Nicolas Cage's 'Next'. In which case the Jedi would spend an hour and a half dodging Samus' attacks, then it would turn out the whole fight was a vision, and they'd decide the only way to win is to not play. (or kill Zero Suit Samus in her sleep. But then they'd have to get past the gunship's defenses.) But still, that's if things went really well for the jedi and they were crazy lucky.  A Sith Lord might have a chance, since they have the electric power, which has been known to short out the power suit from time to time, but That's just a chance... I don't know how they would fare against Samus' other weapons.   Now let's have a look at the weapon. The ""lightsaber"". Now, I'm no Star Wars expert. I've only seen the films and only have minor wiki knowledge. But I've never liked the expanded universe anyway, so let's just go with what's been established in the films. The Lightsaber can aparently cut through anything. It can cut through metal, bone, and basically any material (though I have heard rumors that Boba Fett has some type of armor that is impervious to lightsabers. But like I said, extended universe.) This doesn't mean it can cut through anything like butter though. IIRC in the opening of the Phantom Menace, Obi-wan and Qui-gon cut through a blast door by stabbing it and very slowly melting through the center. This means that there are some things that the lightsaber can't slice through quickly. It also shows that the lightsaber cuts with extreme heat.  As for Samus' defense against this, she's got the varia suit. Which is built to survive extreme temperatures such as heat. She still takes damage from lava, but it is noticably halved. Walking through lava causes your energy meter to decrease, but the suit itself takes no damage. It's all the shields.   This leads me to believe that a strike from a lightsaber, while it would definitely drop the health bar, would probably only take out a single energy tank at most. And once it gets to the actual armor, it would have to slowly melt through it, like with the blast door. Also, it's a close range weapon. All of Samus' weapons can be used from a distance.  Now let's get to Samus' weapons. You guys already know most of this, so let me keep this part short. A Jedi rarely wears armor, sometimes they might shield themselves with the force, but I doubt that could absorb Samus' attacks for very long. So please keep in mind that a human wearing clothes would have to deal with each one of these attacks. The lightsaber might be able to block the power beam, and ice beam, but the wave beam and plasma beam would probably be unblockable. The wave beam goes through objects meaning dodging is the only way to go. The plasma beam is a straight line of death, as opposed to a few fist sized energy balls. The missiles could be neutralized with a few cuts from the lightsaber, but most have homing properties, and Samus would probably have about 150 of them. And then we have the big one. The most deadly weapon in Samus' arsenal. The Power Bomb. This weapon is basically a nuke the size of a grapefruit. It is capable of obliterating all biological life within earshot. By the time it's planted, the Jedi is already dead. Take all of that, and the fact that Samus has lock on targeting (something a Jedi would be very unfamiliar with) Dodging, and a morph ball that makes her into a smaller and more agile target.   So yeah, A Jedi knight would basically be dead. Their body would be a pile of dust before they'd have a chance to retaliate."
Metroid,366o6q,twinfyre,3,Sun May 17 07:41:29 2015 UTC,"A sufficiently skilled Jedi should be able to repel or dodge pretty much any of Samus' beam attacks, actually. You already acknowledged the power beam and the ice beam, as being fairly easily reflected or blocked, and the wave beam as necessitating evasive action, but with the plasma beam, and limited precognition, a Jedi ought to be able to block the plasma beam as well. The blade of a lightsaber is composed of plasma itself, so, it makes sense that the plasma beam would be ineffective against that defense. So, really, the most effective weapons Samus has against Jedi are those available to her in Morph Ball mode. There's also the grapple beam, yes, but, let's face it, in all its incarnations, that's probably one of the least consistent pieces of Samus' arsenal in the series.  Now, in the Prime series, however, the light beam would likely be most effective, because of the homing shotgun effect it has when charged. At a sufficient distance, the spread would render the volume of incoming projectiles nigh impossible to effectively block or dodge.  Now, to poke at the gravity suit, a Jedi lifting something with the Force isn't manipulating gravity. The Jedi is literally putting a force upon the body they're moving. As far as we can observe, the gravity suit normalizes gravity across all fluids or vacuum, meaning that Samus has the same force acting upon her through water, air, or vacuum, on any given planet. The Force has shown itself, in the hands of a capable Jedi, to be capable of lifting something outside even Samus' physical capabilities. Additionally, as I said earlier, a Jedi using the Force to move an object is literally applying a force. So, an upwards lift may be canceled out by the gravity suit, yes, but even breaking the surface of water, at least in the Prime trilogy, still has Samus slowing down, either going out of the water, or submerging. This can be hypothesized to be a short time for the gravity suit to calculate, and compensate for, a change in buoyancy, to allow it to project whatever it does to normalize how gravity acts. A horizontal force from, well, the Force, wouldn't not be compensated for as well, because it doesn't operate on a vertical axis like a lift would. So, with proper endurance, a Jedi ought to be able to keep Samus at bay long enough to escape, or pull her close enough to start using their lightsaber more directly. Granted, the latter option would be a very bad thing if Samus has power bombs, but, the possibility is still there."
Metroid,366o6q,Wei_Tzu,2,Mon May 18 12:15:04 2015 UTC,"But what would happen to Samus if she came into direct contact with the lightsaber? This seems to be the deciding moment here. If the lightsaber fails, and only takes out an energy tank, the jedi is now in power bomb range. Thus incinerated. If the lightsaber succeeds, then Samus is dead.  My guess is either the energy tank, or similar to the scene from phantom menace, where the lightsaber slowly melts through."
Metroid,366o6q,kenzy_5g,2,Mon May 18 12:31:48 2015 UTC,"A strike from a lightsaber would probably put a rapid, steady drain on the energy shielding Samus' suit has, followed by quickly heating the armor itself once the shields collapse. So, there would have to be either numerous, rapid strikes, or one sustained strike, but yes, it would leave the Jedi in power bomb range. However, Jedi are capable of moving themselves much faster than a standard human. Not to speedbooster levels, mind, but fast enough they could probably escape the blast radius, if they were to move near immediately. So, really, as much as I love Samus, the Force is what gives a Jedi the edge in combat against her, at least in a one-on-one duel.  One thing I forgot to consider, though, is the blast radius of missiles, supers, and other charge combos as well.  I think that those firmly place Samus into an advantageous position, now, simply because of raw destructive power in some of those. Incidentally, however, I think the wavebuster would be the least effective of any charge combos, due to the fact that a lightsaber has been shown to be capable of blocking and absorbing electricity generated by the Force."

Metroid,36335y,Claymore2106,48,Fri May 15 18:10:22 2015 UTC,"Switchable Beams make them feel more like new tools, whereas stacking beams just feel like Weapon upgrades, I think it would be cool to expand on upgradable switchable beams, where you get a total of like 4 beams, but you also get stackable upgrades for them that give the beams different properties.  So yeah I don't know what I prefer really. They act differently in gameplay so they're hard to compare."
Metroid,36335y,ozzAR0th,15,Fri May 15 18:16:28 2015 UTC,"I would like the ability to freely mix and match beams (like in Super Metroid) but they shouldn't add flat damage to your beam, just effects. For example, Wave goes through walls, but it is harder to aim. Ice would freeze enemies, but would move slower. Plasma would do more damage to armored targets and could melt ice etc, but some enemies would reflect the beam. Some beams would be incompatible with each other, though. Ice and plasma wouldn't work, for example. On top of this system, add a couple of upgrades that do increase beam damage, or add other effects, things like the Charge Beam or Spazer, but maybe give them a tradeoff. For example, the spazer could spread the beam out, but each third only does 1/3 of the regular damage, or maybe it only spreads out when the beam is charged."
Metroid,36335y,Jammintk,3,Fri May 15 20:07:23 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of mix matching beams with different advantages and disadvantages.

Metroid,36335y,mooloor,10,Fri May 15 18:20:44 2015 UTC,"Overall I like the stacking beam upgrades. It kind of bugged me in the original Metroid where if you had the wave beam you were kinda screwed at the end of the game (though there were two ice beams to be found, so that was nice).  In a future Metroid game I'd like to see where you get several different beams and you can turn certain ones on and off in combinations to have different effects."

Thankfully, there are two Ice Beam pickups in case you overwrite the first with the Wave Beam. The wave beam is powerful, yes, but it's functionally useless in Tourian and is usually found around the same time you're ready to move onto there.  Also I believe (it's been some time since I played so I may be mis-remembering) in Super Metroid,  certain beam combinations were just not as good as ones with one less beam in the 'stack' - again, I believe the Wave Beam has some issues and so does the Spazer. Hence why Super Metroid lets you selectively disable these."
Metroid,36335y,BobisOnlyBob,10,Mon May 18 06:20:33 2015 UTC,"I vastly prefer switchable beams since they give some choice in playstyle rather than the same play with straight upgrades.

Metroid,36335y,Elusive2000,3,Fri May 15 18:34:15 2015 UTC,"For a 3D game I prefer the beam-switching, it adds some nice depth to the game and is quick and easy to switch with. Just don't give each beam ammo like in Prime 2.  However, I don't think it'd work well for a handheld 2D installment, unlike the GC Controller and Wiimote the handheld consoles are more limited when it comes to control options, so switching wouldn't be easy, and having to switch screens to do it regularly is unacceptable. I also don't feel the visual indicator showing what beam you've chosen would work as well, in Prime the cannon is right in your face, but on a smaller screen in a 2D dimension it would be hard to make out, and putting a visual indicator on the lower screen wouldn't work well as you'll always want to keep your eyes on the usually fast-paced gameplay. There are a lot of potential problems, therefore I'd prefer if the 2D installments stick with stacking beams as it has in the past."
Metroid,36335y,Masterofknees,5,Fri May 15 21:32:56 2015 UTC,"The beams, as they are in Super Metroid can only really work in a 2D platformer. All of the main effects are pretty useless in a 3D environment.  In 3D, you can not see through walls so you don't know if your wave beam is aimed at an enemy. And from the shooter's perspective the shot just looks like its going up and down, while on the 2D platformer, it looks like a proper"" wave""  In 3D, your plasma beam's ability to pierce enemies would be underutilized since having enemies lined up perfectly in line with your shooting line is a very rare occurrence.  The ice beam's main use in the platformers is to freeze enemies for use as platforms. a concept that is not commonly utilized in a 3D environment compared to the 2D platformer.  The spazer beam in 3D would just gives you more room for error with aiming your shots since the ""bullets"" are so wide and more likely to hit your target without needing to be accurate.  The charge beam works good in 3D since its just a damage upgrade without any effects that are unique to 2D platforming."
Metroid,36335y,GoldenShadowGS,2,Fri May 15 22:16:58 2015 UTC,"Prime's beam switching seems to work better for gameplay balance, using different beams for different situations and giving each weapon its own advantages and disadvantages (like the Ice Beam's slower fire rate in exchange for freezing enemies solid). I really liked using different beams for puzzles in Prime. Then again, getting another level of power stacked onto the beam you already had in Super Metroid/Fusion/MZM/OM was really satisfying (the Plasma Beam was one of the things Other M did right).  Hard to pick, but I think switchable in FPS games and stackable in sidescrollers is a good way of doing things. (and it's how the series is already doing them for the most part)"
Metroid,36335y,breakmanblues,2,Fri May 15 19:47:45 2015 UTC,"It depends. I like the way Prime 2 handled beams, where each beam has a specific use, but the switchable beam in Prime 1 felt somewhat pointless."

Metroid,36335y,henryuuk,2,Fri May 15 18:48:07 2015 UTC,"Stackables are the best. I wish the prime games had stackable beams like Super Metroid, with different combinations having more or less success in certain situations"
Metroid,36335y,The_M4G,6,Fri May 15 19:28:44 2015 UTC,"imagine Prime's weapon selection and swap ""select"" with ""equip"", sounds quite interesting to me. Like equipping Plasma and Ice to make the beam still freeze enemies but accelerate it to Plasma's speed or with Wave to get 3 shots instead of 1."
Metroid,36335y,AuraRyu,1 point,Fri May 15 19:37:37 2015 UTC,"Stackable with the ability to switch beams on and off. It would be nice if not every beam would be a damage up, so that switching on and off some would actually be useful sometimes. Or well, switchable beams like in prime, but with certain upgrades improving all beams would work too."

Metroid,35z336,LimEJET,3,Thu May 14 22:49:33 2015 UTC,In the PAL version of Metroid Prime they added narration at the start. I've always thought it made the opening even more awesome haha.

Metroid,3607u6,Ridley290,3,Fri May 15 01:45:25 2015 UTC,"This could definitely work. Swap out the alien for Sa-X, have random enemies throughout, all the exploration elements of standard metroid games. An unpredictable Sa-X would be the most terrifying thing I've ever seen... As if Fusions Sa-X wasn't bad enough."
Metroid,3607u6,Leaningthemoon,6,Sun May 17 20:22:54 2015 UTC,I've started threads on this exact topic a few times and they never gain traction. It seems there are a very select few that would like to see a 3rd person over the shoulder metroid with a little more adult situations.
Metroid,3607u6,Twilix01,5,Fri May 15 01:42:08 2015 UTC,"I don't like the idea of a useless power beam, as that's been Samus's go-to way of defending herself. Now if you had her in the zero suit for a while, then it would make sense as her emergency pistol is demonstrably piss-poor at taking out enemies."
Metroid,3607u6,breakmanblues,3,Fri May 15 07:09:11 2015 UTC,"I think the Emergency Pistol/Paralyzer would actually work well in a survival horror setting, with the idea that you can't stop enemies, just slow them down.  ...Actually, the infiltration segment of Zero Mission did get pretty tense...  Take Metroid II with the gameplay style of Prime 2, add the stealth elements of Zero Mission, the SA-X scenes from Fusion, and occasionally toss in the third-person perspective from the exploration segments of Other M, and you pretty much already have a survival horror game."
Metroid,3607u6,Skullman7809,1 point,Mon May 18 02:07:49 2015 UTC,Using the pistol to only slow enemies combined with Samus's agility would make for a fun mechanic.
Metroid,3607u6,Galgus,2,Mon May 18 17:25:05 2015 UTC,Alternatively it could be set in the Metroid universe without Samus Aran as the main character.  I kind of feel like there need to be other main characters for the Metroid universe to be explored beyond what she directly interacts with.
Metroid,3607u6,Twilix01,2,Fri May 15 21:22:55 2015 UTC,"I'd be okay with giving that a try, though it would have to be done well or they would probably not want to try that again."
Metroid,3607u6,Galgus,2,Fri May 15 22:27:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the execution of that would be very important with another character.  I'd actually like a game focusing on conflict between the Federation and the Space Pirates, with Samus as more of a legendary background character."
Metroid,3607u6,Twilix01,2,Sat May 16 01:57:12 2015 UTC,"That would be interesting, of course. Particularly if we got to see the point of view of both the Federation and the Pirates."
Metroid,3607u6,Galgus,1 point,Sat May 16 02:37:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was thinking it could be structured with campaigns for the Federation, Space Pirates, and perhaps Samus and...well, in my dream world a Chozo.  The Federation would probably have the most active combat scenes against multiple enemies and a feeling that you have to keep your fellow soldiers from being overrun.  Space Pirates I think would have some focus on melee combat and, perhaps, a degree of stealth attacks.  Samus would be the traditional platforming and fighting off large bosses.  And for the Chozo, well, I'd mostly like it to see them take an active part in the series. I love Chozo.  Perhaps a lone Chozo warrior with a pseudo-mage style of play, with powerful but infrequent attacks and less focus on constant gunning."
Metroid,3607u6,Crobatman123,2,Sat May 16 02:44:52 2015 UTC,"That could work, Like the Hero of Time in pretty much every Zelda game that takes place and was made after Ocarina of Time. Not the main hero, but a big character, almost a model."
Metroid,3607u6,MonochromeTyrant,0,Tue May 19 00:13:30 2015 UTC,Take the opportunity to give Samus a little sister 😃
Metroid,3607u6,Twilix01,0,Sat May 16 18:34:10 2015 UTC,"Conversely, would not it be terrifying if Samus's go to defense could not save her?"
Metroid,3607u6,NightSwipe,6,Fri May 15 10:45:07 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be more annoying than terrifying, personally."
Metroid,3607u6,Pacalakin,2,Fri May 15 11:14:23 2015 UTC,"I'd be annoyed because the basic power beam is always at least a competent means of defense, even if hardly the most efficient or powerful. Even if there was an actual reason provided in-game of why the power beam did fuck-all to everything, it would still make me wonder why it gives me the power beam without the capability to defeat even basic enemies. I state again that your proposal would make much more sense and be far better received if samus was in her zero suit, because the only weapon she has with that isn't designed to kill, it's designed to stun."
Metroid,3607u6,beezle13,4,Fri May 15 15:36:06 2015 UTC,"Have you played Fusion? I played it for the first time when I was a kid (maybe 7 or 8) and it was pretty much a survival horror. Something out there, hunting you, you can't hurt it, etc. The part right after you got Space Jump where you had to get to Sector 2 and evade from the SA-X was terrifying for me, haha.  Jokes aside, I get what you're saying. I don't know about 3rd person though... I feel like Metroid has its place in either first-person or side-scrolling."
Metroid,3607u6,Butter_Is_Life,3,Fri May 15 01:06:46 2015 UTC,"I want it to be a spinoff that takes place in the same universe, where you're a normal Federation troop stuck in a dead space like environment, with the hardest enemies being the things Samus fights on a regular basis."
Metroid,3607u6,TamotsuKun,2,Sat May 16 18:27:56 2015 UTC,"You could make it start like the usual Metroid set up... Lose upgrades, but your beam cannon also becomes disabled. As you venture throughout the planet/station, you slowly begin to regain your suit abilities which grant access to new rooms.  The survival horror part? Self evolving or genetically engineered Metroids. Only near the end of the game would you get your beam upgrades and missiles that would give you a fighting chance to face them head on."
Metroid,3607u6,MonochromeTyrant,1 point,Fri May 15 02:28:27 2015 UTC,"Evolving enemies in general would be great. It'd be a nice way to keep Samus powerful without making her completely god-like, just make the enemies get harder as you progress, make later versions of Pirates act smarter with their weapons, Metroids are now evolved in previous areas, etc. Dynamic enemies would be so cool in Metroid, survival horror or not."
Metroid,3607u6,FriendFrog,2,Sat May 16 22:58:14 2015 UTC,I think fusion did many things right regarding the horror aspect. It just lacked exploration and gave a bit too much story via text which made it feel less isolated.
Metroid,3607u6,Julum,2,Fri May 15 14:12:55 2015 UTC,"It'd be really cool if they made the area something like the start of Super Metroid and the Ceres colony.  You could start off finding a ship that has taken heavy damages. Once you enter the ship and walk through some rooms with numerous bodies laying about, a space pirate ambushes you and, to escape, you jump down a shaft which then places you deep in the ship/station.  I like the idea. I love games with dark, creepy atmospheres and i think Nintendo could do it very well. Just look at Twilight Princess."

Metroid,35zon6,blamb211,6,Thu May 14 21:27:06 2015 UTC,It can work well.  I actually tried to mouse and keyboard the wii version to make it feel like a first person shooter  however it doesn't really work.  There's to much sway and not enough precision thanks to the crappy motion control.    It just makes you wish for a pc port.    BUT visually it looks awesome.  Being able to upscale the game to 1080p and even apply AA makes it look so much better
Metroid,35zon6,Der_Scuple,3,Thu May 14 22:27:47 2015 UTC,"It's more because the motion control is designed to be used with a pointer, not a mouse, and thus functions very differently from a normal FPS even if you try to configure it to use a mouse.  That's HARDLY a reason to call the motion control ""crappy"".  it'd be like if you were using a keyboard and mouse but used the mouse with your foot and complaining about the crappy mouse controls."
Metroid,35zon6,Tagrineth,3,Fri May 15 16:14:57 2015 UTC,Exactly.  I was hoping the emulator might be able to work a bit better but it didn't really.   The one thing that's always soured my experience of an otherwise great trilogy is the wii motion control gimmicks.  (Which they took even further in the 3rd with that Friggen grapple whip that doesn't work half the time and makes you feel like a fool)  Yes you get use to them and I can eventually enjoy the game but that doesn't change the fact playing it with mouse and keyboard would turn an awesome game into a perfect one.   And knowing Nintendo they'll never be even a possibility of a pc port which sucks - I think these games would be perfect on pc

If you have or can find the Wii U GCN 4 port breakout box, it works seamlessly with Dolphin.  I had some slowdown in certain areas when there were a lot of particle effects, but most of the game ran extremely smoothly. For reference, my PC has an intel Core i5 (haswell) 3.2ghz processor, an Nvidia GTX 660 Ti, and 8GB of RAM."
Metroid,35zon6,Jammintk,2,Thu May 14 23:21:39 2015 UTC,I played GC versions of 1 and 2 with a PS3 controller. They both ran decent except for the map screen really chugged as well as getting into and out of water. Phendrana Drifts was alright but Torvus Bog was a nightmare. So much lag.
Metroid,35zon6,AndrewToth,2,Thu May 14 23:48:44 2015 UTC,"On pc you can upscale to 1080p and play with an Xbox pad instead of a wii remote. Works fantastically, but I don't think metroid prime 3 is supported with a pad :("

Metroid,35zon6,Julum,1 point,Thu May 14 22:31:36 2015 UTC,I only ever had some issues with the sound doing some strange delay but other than that it was awesome. I would recommend grabbing a GC to USB adapter so you can get the console experience with the upscaled graphics.

Metroid,35xkvg,MatrixChicken,3,Thu May 14 15:31:23 2015 UTC,I'm glad I'm not the only one who could barely stand NSMBWII's soundtrack. The least they could have done is stop using that damn kazoo song in every other NSMB game as well.

Metroid,35xkvg,FriendFrog,2,Thu May 14 16:37:25 2015 UTC,I don't get why people seem to want a 2.5D Metroid so badly.
Metroid,35xkvg,MatrixChicken,0,Fri May 15 00:51:08 2015 UTC,2.5D in the vein of New Super Mario Bros.  I want the amazing gameplay of the 2D Metroid series with sharp 3D graphics.
Metroid,35xkvg,FriendFrog,0,Fri May 15 00:52:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know what 2.5D is, I just want to know why people would want that when they could have full 3D. I'm guessing it's just nostalgia."
Metroid,35xkvg,MatrixChicken,1 point,Fri May 15 01:08:11 2015 UTC,"Oh. Well, I just really like the 2D Metroids, and they do have elements that aren't possible in 3D games. I know some people don't like sidescrollers, but I'd be extremely sad if Nintendo didn't make another 2D Metroid."
Metroid,35xkvg,FriendFrog,1 point,Fri May 15 02:50:47 2015 UTC,What elements aren't possible in 3D games?
Metroid,35xkvg,MatrixChicken,2,Fri May 15 03:44:57 2015 UTC,"Mostly movement. I'm sure Retro could have done more, but the Prime games lacked shinespark, speedbooster, wall jumping outside of a few areas... Wall jumping, especially, is one of the coolest things to do in Metroid, IMO, but it's not there in the Prime games, and I'm not sure if they could make it work right. And of course there's level design stuff like visual cues and stuff that only works with a fixed camera. Don't get me wrong, I love the Prime games, but I think it'd be a huge bummer if they stopped making the 2D ones."
Metroid,35xkvg,FriendFrog,1 point,Fri May 15 04:13:39 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between 3D & first-person. All of the things you mentioned are perfectly doable in 3D, but much harder in first-person."
Metroid,35xkvg,MatrixChicken,3,Fri May 15 05:37:33 2015 UTC,"Not all of the things... But yes, 3rd person would make a lot more possible. The restriction of 2D makes movement a lot more predictable and easy to learn, though.  lol Let's just face it, I want a new 2D game and you don't. xD"

Metroid,35xkvg,Satiie,2,Fri May 15 16:40:53 2015 UTC,"Well no, Prime series, other M, pinball and others like those are not ""numbered"" metroid. Metroid 1 is on Nes, 2 on GBA, 3 on SNES, 4 on fusion and that's all. Btw you can notice they are all in 2D."
Metroid,35xkvg,FriendFrog,0,Fri May 15 03:19:25 2015 UTC,"Are you trying to suggest there's a correlation between being 2D & being numbered? Zero Mission didn't have ""Metroid 1"" in the intro sequence. I think they just stopped bothering to number the games after fusion, like how they stopped numbering Zelda games after 2."
Metroid,35xkvg,Satiie,1 point,Fri May 15 16:39:58 2015 UTC,"Yes I am. And it's not a suggestion, it's a fact . Not saying that nintendo will keep that for ever but I'm pretty sure it is no accident if it's been like that until now.  And Zero mission is a remake, I guess they just didn't want us to totally forget about Metroid 1 though."
Metroid,35xkvg,FriendFrog,0,Fri May 15 20:38:37 2015 UTC,"Where did you learn this ""fact"" from? You'd have to reference an interview or something first before you'd convince me that's just something other than your own misunderstanding or preference.  The point of a remake is to replace the original. You're just ignoring what I said because it doesn't support your ""all 2D Metroids are numbered"" belief. If Zero Mission came out before Fusion (what I'm sure is the last Metroid to ever be numbered) I'd believe it."

Metroid,35xkvg,ICReality,1 point,Fri May 15 22:25:39 2015 UTC,"Prime came out a bit before Fusion.   It would seem odd to remove the number,  re add it and then remove it again.  To me,  the 2D Metroid games are the official main story games,  being numbered,  while Prime and everything else is side story.  I think this fact is reiterated in Gametrailers' Metroid retrospective somewhere."
Metroid,35xkvg,FriendFrog,0,Fri May 15 23:18:37 2015 UTC,"Prime came out a bit before Fusion.   No it didn't. In the US & Canada Fusion & Prime came out the same day, in Japan Fusion came out 14 days before Prime & in the UK Prime came out 4 months after Fusion. Unless you're living in some other country where I can't find the release date is, Fusion came out first.   It would seem odd to remove the number, re add it and then remove it again.   That would be odd if that ever happened, but it hasn't and probably won't.   To me, the 2D Metroid games are the official main story games, being numbered, while Prime and everything else is side story.   Whether we like it or not, (I don't) Other M is part of the main story. And if that game wasn't numbered, odds are there isn't going to be another numbered game."
Metroid,35xkvg,ICReality,0,Sun May 24 08:59:39 2015 UTC,"Other M was made by Team Ninja.  It is so not a real Metroid game. Bleh.  Zero Mission didnt get a number since it was just a remake of the original game.  That original game was already released back onto the Gameboy Advance simply as ""Metroid"", but known to be under the Classic NES Series.  You can't have the exact same name, if you want your new game to sell, so Metroid Zero Mission was obvious.    Also, all those other games clearly took place in between the numbered games.  Fusion is the very last story in the entire timeline, so all of those games are ""in betweequals"" and not true sequels.  If any game comes out that takes place after Fusion and plays like a classic 2D metroid game, Id bet money that it will be labeled Metroid 5: ""Something METROID"" ala Metroid 3 & 4."
Metroid,35xkvg,FriendFrog,0,Sun May 24 22:15:33 2015 UTC,"What would you say if a 2.5D game came out set after Fusion, made solely by Nintendo and didn't have a number? What would you say if they never numbered their games again just like how they stopped numbering Zelda games at 2? Would there never again be a canon Metroid game?"
Metroid,35xkvg,Masterofknees,9,Mon May 25 01:50:45 2015 UTC,"First and foremost I just hope they keep it simple, no wacky and unnecessary gimmicks, don't make it story-focused, don't have us jump around planets, etc. I feel like it's important to play it safe after the Other M fiasco, otherwise the franchise could potentially go even further down the shitter. Obviously that doesn't mean they shouldn't introduce any new things, new and innovative upgrades and thematically new zones are more than welcome of course, but don't introduce any completely gameplay-altering gimmicks that could potentially hurt the game.   Once they have kicked off the franchise again they can introduce new gimmicks and stuff in future installments, but at this point they need to handle the franchise carefully."
Metroid,35xkvg,Masterofknees,4,Mon May 25 18:42:09 2015 UTC,"With story-focused I mean that the story shouldn't be one of the key elements in the game like in Other M or Fusion where the story decides where you're going rather than exploration. In Prime the story is there, but you can also just play through the entire game without ever reading a single lore scan, if you want to know the entire story you'll need to explore to get it, and as such it's an optional part of the game and not a key element. It's an extremely clever way to tell the story though, you don't need to know the story to enjoy the game but the experience will be enhanced if you do read it, and I do hope they do something similar in the next 3D Metroid installment because it worked extremely well."
Metroid,35xkvg,Koog330,2,Thu May 14 10:56:20 2015 UTC,"I kept hearing people saying scanning was boring and that it was not a good part of the Prime series, but I couldn't get enough of it. I had to scan everything. It was one of my favorite parts of the game and without it I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much."
Metroid,35xkvg,TheArknight,1 point,Thu May 14 22:15:47 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. I just want a clean experience. Simple controls with deep exploration like Metroid usually is.  And with story, I just want something simple like Super Metroid. Just put me on a planet and let me play. They should of course flesh it out a bit more like the other Prime games for a Wii U game."
Metroid,35xkvg,LuxShadow1,2,Thu May 14 22:24:49 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I own a Wii U and love the system.  I have made this claim about other games, but I'll say the same for Metroid. Wait for NX. I know we don't know much about the system yet, but they're already going to talk about it in 2016 with a release in 2017. I believe that means Wii U is on its way out. They've already seen that massive (and amazing) games couldn't pull the Wii U up by its bootstraps. Which is ultimately why I believe they should save their games for their fresh start, NX. Otherwise they are sadly condemning games to mediocre sales due to the sheer fact that the Wii U install base just isn't there.  Long story short, I want a new Metroid but not on Wii U.  In terms of what I want? It's simple. A [single] alien planet to explore. A sense of isolation once again (I don't care for federation troopers). New and interesting upgrades. Passive story (don't shove it in my face with cutscenes and talking)."

Metroid,35xkvg,breakmanblues,3,Thu May 14 11:16:19 2015 UTC,"Their have been very subtle hints of a new Metroid game appearing these past few years (e.g, Reggie Metroid pin scenario, next level games cancelled game, Metroid's 30th anniversary coming up soon, Samus appearing in Monster Hunter as DLC) so It would make a lot of sense to see a new Metroid game show up show up at least on the 3DS, or the Wii U. But at this point, I don't think Nintendo wants to make any major financial risks, and Other M didn't sell well at all, so I think that factor alone has discouraged them from making a new game any time soon. It's more likely we could see one on the 3DS, if it were to happen, but who knows. I'm 99% certain that it we don't hear any Metroid related news in this years E3, we aren't seeing a new game for the 3DS or WiiU. it's their biggest chance to reveal a new Metroid title, and if they don't have one to show off (or at least a confirmation) at E3, we've lost hope."
Metroid,35xkvg,breakmanblues,2,Thu May 14 23:28:43 2015 UTC,"There will bw something. (i.e; Retro's new website, the thing, 30 years of metroid, metroid prime 3 100% ending.) You get the point."
Metroid,35xkvg,Mourossonero,3,Thu May 14 23:30:50 2015 UTC,"Those suggestions sound great. ...honestly I don't want the next FPS Metroid to be a Prime game because they'd have to shoehorn in some excuse for Phazon to be in it (wouldn't be a Metroid Prime game without the Metroid Prime). Just make a FPS Metroid that stands by itself, the Prime Trilogy doesn't need to be touched."
Metroid,35xkvg,breakmanblues,1 point,Thu May 14 12:20:32 2015 UTC,"I think I'm leaning towards a new game that's not in the Prime trilogy myself as well. Just something new. Perhaps we could get what Prime was going to be in early stages, a third-person shooter. That would be awesome!"
Metroid,35xkvg,txcrnr,2,Thu May 14 14:11:14 2015 UTC,2016: Zelda goes open-world and Metroid goes third-person. I like it. Aiming would be weird though; even Zelda games switch to FPS view when you use certain ranged weapons. ...except even in a 15-year-old Zelda game they let you move around in FPS view. not sure what Other M was trying to do there  What I think Metroid in third person would need: Z-Targeting. It'd be fantastic.
Metroid,35xkvg,d1g1tal_Mantra,2,Fri May 15 20:43:11 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine myself Z-targeting in a 3rd person Metroid game... I'm addicted to the sidescrolling, shoot in 8 direction, shinesparking, wall jumping and all the great assets of the genra. I like change but I want the game to retain the sequence breaks and the speedrunning techniques of the Metroid serie. What if the game doesn't ""feel"" like Metroid? Ocarina 64 in space with a Metroid skin might be a great game but not a Metroid. If it isn't broken don't fix it, apply this to the 2D Metroid and 3D Metroid formula and you have games that are very solid. In my opinion, innovation is so... scary. Do you understand my point?"
Metroid,35xkvg,ZKtheMAN,2,Fri May 15 21:06:35 2015 UTC,"Yep. I was just throwing out a suggestion. I was thinking about aiming in particular: In a 3rd person shooter, you can't have eight-directional shooting because you'd be missing out on more precise aiming. The Zelda series' Z-Targeting is basically the same thing as the Lock-On in Metroid Prime, so that part at least would make some sense.   The other options: you could go with a RE4-styled over-the-shoulder perspective, but it would probably limit a lot of the freedom of movement that defines the classic games. It would work pretty well in a Prime-styled game though.  And of course, we could go back to Other M's style of blending 2D and 3D segments and having auto-aim/finishing moves/whatever, because the gameplay tended to be the strongest thing about that game. We could keep the stuff Other M did right without repeating its mistakes.   please rework the fps mode because that was annoying ok thanks"

Metroid,35xkvg,Butter_Is_Life,2,Fri May 15 22:02:29 2015 UTC,They should return to form. Make a 2d sidescroller ( they do can all the pseudo 3d shit they want ) so long as it upholds that tight control mechanic us runners love and need. Controls are number 1. and super metroid is the only metroid game in the franchise that achieved control perfection.
Metroid,35xkvg,Virti86,3,Thu May 14 10:44:22 2015 UTC,"I prefer how Zero Mission controlled. I don't know exactly what it is. Maybe it's just that it felt faster and more fluid. Maybe it's that you didn't have to hit select a bajillion times to get to an item. I don't know exactly what it is.  Not to say that Super Metroid's controls were bad, it actually felt really good. Just I prefer Zero Mission. And I'm not well versed in the many nuances of the movement system, all I really know about is bomb jumping and single-wall jumping.

Metroid Prime blew us away because not only was it a solid game but also because it showcased what the Gamecube was capable of. A 3D Metroid game for the Wii U has more potential than a Wii U 2D game to show off the system's capabilities. If it's on the 3DS, then yes, only then I want a 2D/2.5 D game."

Metroid,35uddz,PhazonZim,2,Wed May 13 16:35:22 2015 UTC,I want to see beam stacking like in Fusion or Zero mission return. Having to swap beams either via the menu (super metroid) or by getting pickups on the map (Metroid II) is super tedious
Metroid,35uddz,leshpack,2,Thu May 14 18:36:51 2015 UTC,Beam stacking works well in sidescrollers but I'd much prefer swapping in prime. I didn't like the stacking system in corruption. I'd trade hypermode for my 4 beams any day.

Metroid,35uv50,Der_Scuple,4,Wed May 13 18:28:15 2015 UTC,"For the first form try to kill tentacles with the special beams to promote beam ammo drops.  Annihilator works well.  I usually try to hit them with supers, as you can kill multiple tentacles if they're clustered.  When he does the skip rope attack, you should be able to time a power bomb to wreck all the tentacles.  Super missiles work well enough for the exposed eye.  For the second form (form 1.5), don't rush to kill all the tentacle holes.  If you wait around and chill, liquid inglets will crawl towards you to hit you.  Just dart around constantly dropping bombs.  These inglets will usually drop health or ammo, so farm them for as long as you can to get yourself back to full health.  I like to farm a bit, then kill most of the tentacles, then farm a bit more to top off again.  At some point the entire room can fill with the toxic air and you'll have to kill off that form - don't know what triggers it.  For the final form, he has a couple of attacks (one in light mode and one in dark mode) where he spawns swarms of small fliers.  If you anticipate it and fire the light or dark charge combo, you can get a TON of ammo and some health.  As for damaging him normally, he seems to block a lot of my attacks by closing his mouth or moving a leg.  Don't really have any advice for that.  This might only pertain to the original release of the game, but you can apparently kill the last form with the screw attack in a few seconds.  It's definitely unintentional, so I doubt it works in the wii release."
Metroid,35uv50,metroidman388,2,Wed May 13 21:21:29 2015 UTC,"I would advise against using the Super Missiles in Hypermode, basically because it is kinda hard to hit. I prefer using the Sonic Boom, as it deals way more damage and it's an instant hit :D  EDIT: Forgot to mention that I was talking about phase one eye part, duh."
Metroid,35uv50,Nararthok,2,Thu May 14 06:47:41 2015 UTC,Take out the tentacles with seeker missiles.  When he portals them through the ground either screw attack around the room.  Or morph and roll around you can easilly avoid getting hit.   Use supers or sonic boom on the weak point.   the real challenge is the final form.
Metroid,35uv50,SqeeSqee,2,Wed May 13 19:29:10 2015 UTC,You can actually time a screw attack for a one-hit kill. No joke

Don't even bother using Super Missiles, you want to end that phase as soon as possible.  Don't forget to recharge your ammo using the tentacles! I found out that using charged Light Beam worked wonders for me, hitting several tentacles in one shot. Dunno about you, but you can try :D  During second phase, focus on getting your energy tanks back at 100%, then during the final phase, uuuuh... DODGE a lot, refill some more light/dark ammo, and spam that Annihilator Beam on its mouth once it becomes light/dark aligned. But before that, shoot at it with Super Missiles if you have any missiles left.  Personally, I had more problems with Dark Samus...

An undulating synth pairs to the lonely croon of a soprano female - is she singing an elegy or a prayer? Hints of electronics ping against the high end of a piano melody, adding a slight edge that prefigures menaces to come, distant and inexorable.

Upper Brinstar laughs in the face of that concept."
Metroid,35shfn,PhazonZim,2,Wed May 13 04:27:11 2015 UTC,I personally liked the Prologue scene from Super Metroid. That song in the background perfectly fits the series too.
Metroid,35shfn,BlueKyuubi63,3,Wed May 13 17:30:27 2015 UTC,Upper Brinestar theme brings back memories if my first time playing through Super Metroid. It's a fun catchy tune and that seems to embody Super Metroid as a whole as another poster said.  The lower Norfair theme is also a favorite. The urgency of the whole reflects that everything is about to go down.   Someone made a comment about the Phendrana Drifts theme from prime so I won't go into that.  Echoes has almost all of my favorites from the series. I used to fire up my game cube and just listen to the opening theme for hours.   The theme for Torvus Bog is so so relaxing and soothing that it belies the fact that that area and it's dark counterpart are home to some of the most dangerous creatures on Aether/Dark Aether.  The theme for Sanctuary Fortress is so vastly different from any of the other music in the Metroid series that it stood immediately. It's robotic sound and synth completely captures the futuristic theme of the area. It also bears a resemblance to a riff from an In Flames song called My Sweet Shadow (I'll link later) that I'm rather fond of.  Edit: coudln't remember Torvus bog and Linked a thing

Metroid,35shfn,BoboBrizinski,3,Thu May 14 17:35:05 2015 UTC,"Several different ones. Phendrana Drifts is mystical and a huge contrast from Magmoor's Lower Norfair music (which you just came from). Lower Norfair's music is great for when it appears in the game. On the way to Ridley. Ridley's battle theme is intense and his screeches add to the effect. Kraid's theme because it is catchy. Mother Brain's Final battle theme from Super because it is the most intense and heart pounding song that there is. It truly makes you feel like it all comes down to this exact moment.  And finally, the song that plays in the background to the prologue scene of Super Metroid. It is dark, mysterious, isolating, yet adventurous and makes you want to explore this vast world that you haven't even been introduced to yet. It perfectly captures the essence of Metroid and what it is about."
Metroid,35shfn,BlueKyuubi63,3,Wed May 13 17:36:59 2015 UTC,My favorite is probably MP1's title intro from the gamecube. I've always felt it kind of got pushed under the rug. It plays when the game boots up before you press any buttons or hit the main menu. here is a link.
Metroid,35shfn,shhh-sippytime,2,Fri May 15 00:05:38 2015 UTC,I always listen to that soundtrack while doing college work. The MP1 intro theme is my favorite too.
Metroid,35shfn,Koog330,3,Fri May 15 13:40:44 2015 UTC,"""Theme of Samus Aran, Galactic Warrior"" is one of the most uplifting, heroic songs in any videogame. You really feel invincible listening to it. I can't explain why Phendrana Drifts is so amazing, but Ice Valley (Phendrana Deep Lake) is a really underrated track. It takes elements from the original and incorporates them into a uniquely immersive house/trance song.   All in all, though, the experience of first landing on the surface in Metroid Prime and hearing ""Tallon Overworld"" for the first time is beautiful beyond words. Nothing else really compares to it."
Metroid,35shfn,breakmanblues,2,Fri May 15 21:14:13 2015 UTC,Lower Norfair in Super Metroid is awesome.  Phendrana Drifts in Prime has a very peaceful theme.  Emperor Ing's theme in Echoes fits the fight perfectly.
Metroid,35shfn,Weltall548,2,Wed May 13 15:42:07 2015 UTC,"Of the games played so far, Kraid's Lair from Metroid/Metroid Zero, the ""main"" SR-388 theme from Metroid 2, and Lower Brinstar from Super Metroid."
Metroid,35shfn,dbutlerjr,2,Thu May 14 03:36:30 2015 UTC,"For background music, Lower Brinstar. Slow and atmospheric, but it still has a distinct melody. For battle music, Rundas. Tense but somber, with some fine guitar work.  For remixes from outside the series, probably the Smash rendition of Norfair. Really mellow, and I love that drop about half a minute in."
Metroid,35shfn,Blueeyedrat_,2,Thu May 14 16:57:03 2015 UTC,"Torvus Bog is a great ambient track. It reminds me of mist and rainfall - the little snare ""ts-ts-ts-TS"" is like little water droplets.   Crashed Frigate is so soothing and mysterious. It suits an underwater journey perfectly. Underwater, the world has a suspended quality, sort of floaty, and everything comes in waves. I think the music captures that sense perfectly with its piano refrains and the high-pitched electronic refrains.   I like the creepy but catchy vibe of the Kraid area."
Metroid,35shfn,BoboBrizinski,2,Thu May 14 17:34:18 2015 UTC,The Metroid Prime 3 credits is one of my favorite scores in any game. The high vocals give that calm/off putting vibe that a lot of Prime soundtracks give. Example of this being Trovus Bog (another of my favorite tracks.)  IMO the entire Prime Trilogy had some of the greatest soundtracks iv heard.

Metroid,35saro,Weltall548,3,Wed May 13 15:39:17 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience. I actually ended up playing Prime 2 first somehow, but it made me want to go back and play Prime 1, and while I was blown away as a kid, I got lost and couldn't beat the final boss.  Playing the Prime Trilogy version this year, I got to 100% it almost entirely without a guide (needed help for the last missile) and finally beat it, too. It's one of those games that aged incredibly well."
Metroid,35saro,Butter_Is_Life,2,Wed May 13 14:27:05 2015 UTC,"I just beat prime 1 for the first time a couple days ago. I didn't 100% it, but 87% in 12:42 isn't too bad either."
Metroid,35saro,ppeettaauugghh66,2,Wed May 13 04:56:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's an overstatement to call Prime timeless, but it's pretty damn close."

Metroid,35sdlt,samus1225,16,Wed May 13 02:43:51 2015 UTC,my biggest gripe is that current gen samus has a constantly changing face. like they spend so much time on blow-up-doll body that they forget to give her facial identity. this is also true in all fan-art. samus has no face!
Metroid,35sdlt,cubosh,7,Wed May 13 03:51:31 2015 UTC,"...huh, I never really realized that. Besides the blonde hair and lean physique, there's no real defining characteristics for Samus. Throw any white, blonde chick into the power armor and it would fit. Kinda sad. =/"
Metroid,35sdlt,MonarKay,3,Wed May 13 04:55:48 2015 UTC,"She has defining features, they're just not very unique.  Samus has a small mouth and very pointed chin."
Metroid,35sdlt,PhazonZim,3,Wed May 13 15:30:54 2015 UTC,You can pretty much swap out Nova and Samus and any other blonde chick in SciFi games and they are all identical basically.
Metroid,35sdlt,AndrewToth,2,Wed May 13 17:00:00 2015 UTC,"Yep. Female protagonists in 3D games almost all have ponytails too, because they're easier to animate."
Metroid,35sdlt,PhazonZim,1 point,Wed May 13 17:03:29 2015 UTC,"That and they are probably more functional than just having their hair down, right?"
Metroid,35sdlt,Welcome_2_Pandora,4,Thu May 14 14:40:46 2015 UTC,that's definitely a factor but it's still not hugely realistic. Samus' hair in particular is funny because it has waaay too much volume for her helmet.  I had to tone it down a lot and put it in a bun to make it work.
Metroid,35sdlt,PhazonZim,4,Thu May 14 14:50:16 2015 UTC,"Hey new visor idea, hair visor. Just all of Samus' hair in front of her face."

Metroid,35sdlt,autowikiabot,10,Thu May 14 14:57:50 2015 UTC,I don't really understand how this isn't canon. It's not like the zero-suit totally invalidates this scene.
Metroid,35sdlt,1upD,3,Wed May 13 04:38:15 2015 UTC,Yes yes yes. This Samus looks much more mature and better fits the character.
Metroid,35sdlt,txcrnr,4,Wed May 13 02:58:14 2015 UTC,I don't know what gave you the idea that you were alone on this one. I see people going on about how they like prime 1 samus better and hate the zero suit in pretty much every fan art post on the site. It's nothing new.  I personally don't care either way. I play Metroid for the exploration and lore. I don't really like to get into the gender politics of it all.
Metroid,35sdlt,twinfyre,3,Wed May 13 07:31:54 2015 UTC,Id say prime hunters face is proly my fav but this one is good too.
Metroid,35sdlt,OranJ1zz,2,Wed May 13 05:27:19 2015 UTC,You are not the only one. This version of Samus is number one on my list even over ten years later.
Metroid,35sdlt,Seekerman,2,Wed May 13 03:31:56 2015 UTC,"I don't like the Prime 1 Samus face. It's aged worse then the rest of the game's look, and it lacks character. I like that Samus has attitude in her expression for the newer games, particularly Brawl and Smash 4"

Metroid,35sdlt,leigonlord,1 point,Fri May 15 16:26:40 2015 UTC,the skin tight outfit makes sense if you think of what its purpose is.
Metroid,35p3m2,liamt4,10,Tue May 12 10:39:38 2015 UTC,"It sounds like the starting a game from a save station, then the title theme to some of the 2D Metroids into the Brinstar theme"
Metroid,35p3m2,pueojit,3,Tue May 12 11:25:47 2015 UTC,I can confirm that.
Metroid,35p3m2,AuraRyu,6,Tue May 12 12:42:44 2015 UTC,"Appears to be this, before transitioning into this.  Bonus: Metroid Prime's delicious version of Samus' appearance, and Metroid: Other M""'s title screen."

Metroid,35ly0f,Butter_Is_Life,40,Mon May 11 16:18:56 2015 UTC,"The GC cutscene is interesting, because while Samus looks pretty phased (heh) at first, she immediately proceeds to do a badass pose. I'm assuming the idea was that the developers wanted the player to feel powerful after acquiring the final suit.  In the Wii version, Samus seems really unsure of the suit, as if she doesn't know whether it's a blessing or a curse. This version fits a tad bit better in the context of the overall trilogy, since we know that the Phazon Suit eventually becomes Dark Samus."
Metroid,35ly0f,spezzle5,10,Mon May 11 18:09:17 2015 UTC,I thought the pose she does in the GC version looked more like her looking around for more danger
Metroid,35ly0f,jrazor2001,9,Mon May 11 18:51:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've always thought the gamecube version was hilarious. At first, Samus is freaking out like her insides are on fire, but immediately afterward, she just strikes a pose."

Metroid,35ly0f,TheFlyingBogey,8,Mon May 11 21:03:55 2015 UTC,"It actually quite bugs me how many things were different between the PAL and NTSC versions. I much prefer the NTSC logbook entries, as well."
Metroid,35ly0f,reali-tglitch,4,Mon May 11 17:04:59 2015 UTC,Wait...there were differences in logbook entries?
Metroid,35ly0f,Thotaz,5,Mon May 11 19:40:04 2015 UTC,Apparently. Even the sound was different. The sound clip 'recorded to logbook' (which I still have trouble understanding) in the American MP2 is in the MP1 Trilogy (PAL) version.  I dislike the PAL versions. Nothing personal.
Metroid,35ly0f,TheFlyingBogey,3,Mon May 11 19:44:33 2015 UTC,"I dislike the PAL versions. Nothing personal.   That's funny, I love the PAL versions, with all of the little extra things they added/changed they feel like the definitive edition of the game, and I guess Nintendo/retro thought the same thing considering that they based the trilogy off the PAL versions.  Of course if you like to speed run I can see why you would hate the PAL versions because of all the fixes they have."
Metroid,35ly0f,fpiceail,5,Mon May 11 23:51:54 2015 UTC,"The sound clip 'recorded to logbook' (which I still have trouble understanding)   It took me 10 years to find out what was actually benign said in that clip. I wonder, besides sound clips and logbook entries, what other differences there are."
Metroid,35ly0f,chazzhay,4,Tue May 12 00:20:15 2015 UTC,"There are a bunch of small differences in the PAL version. Here are a few:   Flaaghra's full theme plays. For some reason, in the NTSC version, only the  first 30 secs of his theme plays on loop. This was fixed in PAL. There is an invisible wall over the rune door shortly before Flaaghra so you can't double bomb jump over it.  The scan point for the hive mecha boss is now actually centered on the boss instead of being underwater. There is a narration in the opening and closing cinematics of the game. A bunch of sound effects are added for the power suit voice. When you lose your powerups at the beginning, you hear it say ""Varia suit malfunction"", ""Morph ball malfunction"" etc. It also says things like ""Recorded to logbook"", ""Poisonous gas detected"", ""Defeat enemies to unlock doors"" etc. You can no longer strafe while in the scan visor. This is to prevent the ""scan dashing"" bug which is extensively used in speedruns. There is now a pile of rocks in front of the door leading to the Plasma Beam, preventing you from getting the plasma beam before getting the power bomb. Another measure to curb speedrunning. Standing in phazon does less damage Metroid Prime's 2nd form moves faster, does more damage and has more health Ridley is no longer vulnerable to boost ball (yet another speedrun nerf) In the NTSC version, the first hunter metroid you find is in one of the ice caves on the way to the gravity suit. This one is removed in the PAL version (not sure why).  Some cinematics, like the first time you see Ridley in Frigate Orpheon, are made skippable. If I recall correctly, there are some others that have been made unskippable. When you skip the cinematic for omega pirate spawning in the NTSC version, you see him break out of the pod in-game. It skips this in the PAL version, which prevents a certain exploit.  Rooms load more slowly in the PAL version. This is to prevent occasional crashes. Ones already mentioned: some logbook entries are different and the cinematic where you get the phazon suit is changed.   So the PAL version just has a bunch of minor differences. The most noticeable changes are the narrations at the beginning and end. Unfortunately, a lot of the changes are meant to deliberately hinder speedrunning, which is very disappointing."
Metroid,35ly0f,SheeEttin,10,Tue May 12 06:24:54 2015 UTC,I feel that it's not to hinder speed-running but just to stop players from accidentally sequence breaking the game which could cause problems for players unaware of what they're doing.

Metroid,35ly0f,Weltall548,5,Mon May 11 23:22:40 2015 UTC,"IIRC, the Logbook entries about the Metroid Prime itself throughout the lower levels of the mines are vastly different, with the GC NTSC version giving very detailed descriptions of the creature and its interactions with the pirates, while the GC PAL/Wii version only saying that the pirates were aware of some sort of life form existing within the crater."
Metroid,35ly0f,nemec,8,Mon May 11 22:54:19 2015 UTC,"The pirates had no way of getting to Prime, since the impact crater was sealed. How could the pirates interact with it? It was a huge plot hole."

To keep it short, I don't get along with them well, was dealing with particularly bad depression at the time, and felt miserable for most of the many hours long car rides between destinations. When 101% Run came out (I had no idea of its existence before release, so I was overjoyed), I fought with the weak internet my uncle's neighbor was letting us steal, got the album downloaded and onto my phone in the course of a day, and used the beautiful tunes to block out the stressful noise of family arguing while in the car.  In addition to being an amazing album (as is all your albums), 101% Run really helped me through a hard week, and will always hold a special appreciation in my heart. Thank you, and I really look forward to your next project. <3  PS: I'm about to go on a 90 minute drive to run an errand for my boss...

Metroid,35n2v2,breakmanblues,3,Mon May 11 22:53:17 2015 UTC,I really like the basic color scheme here.  The only suggestion I have is an update to the banner that includes Metroid throughout it's history instead of just Super Metroid.  Let's show some love to the Prime series!
Metroid,35n2v2,begrimed,3,Tue May 12 21:07:30 2015 UTC,"as far as flairs are concerned, I think this sub is pretty good as-is. Maybe add in Samus, ZSS and Ridley's Sm4sh character icons and a small Artifact icon from Prime. also I would totally use a Crocomire flair"
Metroid,35n2v2,breakmanblues,2,Fri May 15 21:55:33 2015 UTC,"This subreddit looks fine to me, with one overwhelming exception: that banner. ""Level design as a banner"" is a great idea executed poorly here. I'll whip up some more banners like this that use Super Metroid's graphics if people are interested (I'm very good at using Super Metroid's graphics), though I think StevenGuyPierce's banner & mock-up look great too. I didn't actually realize which Samus pic that was until I saw the visor reflection, well played."
Metroid,35n2v2,pueojit,2,Mon May 25 19:43:46 2015 UTC,"I'd say go for it, the more people we have contributing ideas the better. Metroid's level design is one of the absolute best things about the series, and Super Metroid is a standout even among the rest (Plus it's a recognizable classic; something from Corruption or Fusion might not be nearly as iconic as 16-bit Brinstar or Crateria).  If the sub keeps the Super Metroid graphics as a banner, should it be resized? I feel if the banner was a bit taller (by 30-50%), the Metroid logo, Reddit logo and buttons would feel less cramped, and you could see the background a little better. However, if the banner was too big, it'd take up a little too much of the page"
Metroid,35n2v2,SpaceWarriorSamus-,2,Mon Jun 1 07:28:46 2015 UTC,"I think a banner upgrade would be nice, something that reflects the entire series well. Maybe a sidebar upgrade to make it more coherent"

Metroid,35n2v2,twinfyre,1 point,Mon May 11 22:10:31 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with whatever you do with the sub, but just make sure the final product looks nothing like this steaming pile. I had to unsubscribe from that sub just to get the crappy Windows 8, apple background away from my computer. Maybe we could go for the /r/Fallout look? Make the sub look like one giant logbook scan? Whatever you do, don't make it so simple that there is no identity and worse, no sno. The whole Metro tile design needs to die so we can get back to real design."

Metroid,35n2v2,breakmanblues,2,Fri May 15 20:34:04 2015 UTC,Or prime 2's menu screen. That'll make a lot of people mad. It would be as confusing as /r/ooer.

I don't think I'd ever play Metroid once or a few times a month or I'd need a strategy guide, too. Still I understand where you're coming from."

If you have a differing opinion over Other M, that's fine with me. I'll continue to point out flaws in what I feel is not only a terrible game, but a terrible addition to a great franchise when appropriate, such as in a picture of Samus confronting Ridley without freaking out.

Metroid,35jahm,Jammintk,1 point,Mon May 11 04:13:38 2015 UTC,"So maybe just keep him in the saverooms? I mean sort of like Fusion.  But yeah, it'd probably do the game more bad than good."
Metroid,35jahm,Mr_Pennybags,1 point,Mon May 11 12:30:12 2015 UTC,I'm actually in the middle of writing something similar to this featuring Samus 3 years after fusion with Adam as her only companion.
Metroid,35gkmr,Claymore2106,21,Sun May 10 03:39:26 2015 UTC,"Different control schemes, oddly enough. A classic control scheme, which plays how prime 1 played on a gamecube controller, a more modern scheme, which uses the left stick for movement and right for aiming, and the prime 3 scheme, with nunchuck and wiimote."
Metroid,35gkmr,H00PSHER,4,Sun May 10 04:30:02 2015 UTC,"I was kinda thinking the same thing. I really like Prime's classic controls, but the Wiimote is so nice when playing through Prime Trilogy. I wonder if they could add all three as an option. No idea what the Wii U is limited to, in that regard.  EDIT: Also, how would you want world interaction to be handled? Like in Prime 1 and 2, you did stuff by shooting, morph ball etc., but in 3, you had the push, pull, twist, move controls. Whats your opinion on that?"
Metroid,35gkmr,H00PSHER,1 point,Sun May 10 04:46:40 2015 UTC,I like Prime 1 and 2's gameplay on that. Easily. 3 felt really... odd in that manner.

Metroid,35gkmr,PhazonZim,11,Thu May 14 14:43:11 2015 UTC,"Something that Super and Zero Mission have that the trilogy lacks; built-in sequence breaking. It's cool seeing speed runs which use glitches to sequence break, but I really like how it was handled in SM and ZM"
Metroid,35gkmr,zeress1,5,Sun May 10 05:29:00 2015 UTC,"I feel left out since I started with the Prime series, and missed the era of sequence breaking. I've seen some videos about it, and it looks like a hell of a lot of fun. I'd like to see it put in as well, just dunno how well it would work in 3D"
Metroid,35gkmr,zeress1,5,Sun May 10 06:07:59 2015 UTC,"Technically Prime has sequence breaks too, just not by design. I find they're generally harder to pull off and arguably less fun to do while being unintuitive. That doesn't mean they can't be fun to do, just not my preference. In addition they're pretty much all unintended major bugs/exploits rather then clever design choices.   It's the main reason I don't prefer Prime over most of the 2D Metroids as Retro seemed to have progressively been choosing to get more linear with the series."
Metroid,35gkmr,txcrnr,2,Sun May 10 12:57:36 2015 UTC,"I know Prime has it, but like you said they're just bugs. Like I got the Ice Beam early once, but it required getting out of the map, walking on air, and falling/getting stuck/having to restart a whole lot. It wasn't by any measure fun, like I'd imagine earlier sequence breaks were"
Metroid,35gkmr,zeress1,2,Sun May 10 17:31:44 2015 UTC,"Super Metroid has an amazing item location randomizer that is really fun to play and really tests you on your knowledge of sequence breaking (as well as how well you can execute certain bugs). Even comes with a whole list of suggested things you should know with guides on how to them. Might be a bit much for a newcomer, but the listed techniques are still relevant regardless."
Metroid,35gkmr,txcrnr,1 point,Sun May 10 19:42:47 2015 UTC,I'd personally rather have it be more like super than zero mission. Zero mission had pretty much a single way to sequence break where super had so many different ways.
Metroid,35gkmr,zeress1,3,Sun May 10 12:32:57 2015 UTC,Indeed. Zero Mission's sequence breaking felt very clinical and intended by design where-as SM's felt a lot more like you are breaking the game and therefore creatively using the mechanics in your advantage.
Metroid,35gkmr,Nintendan95,2,Sun May 10 12:53:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it breaking the game, more like straying from the original path."
Metroid,35gkmr,OranJ1zz,2,Sun May 10 12:57:51 2015 UTC,"There's a glitch you can do with the x-ray visor that lets you skip all the bosses before MB entirely, but yeah that's the only one I can think of that is legitimately really breaking the game now that I think about it."

Metroid,35gkmr,FriendFrog,8,Sun May 10 06:04:55 2015 UTC,"Samus is a bounty hunter, so I wouldn’t complain if we could get jobs on the side of the main exploration game."
Metroid,35gkmr,Spudtron98,4,Sun May 10 06:10:47 2015 UTC,"Would you want them just to do them, have them be like side things in the game, or quests with item rewards, that need to be completed in order to beat/100% the game?"
Metroid,35gkmr,KarjarA,3,Sun May 10 06:24:21 2015 UTC,"Either one, I guess. Could do it for money if you can accept that there are shops that can sell Chozo level equipment to Samus."
Metroid,35gkmr,Anggul,2,Sun May 10 06:25:29 2015 UTC,"Or currency that allows Samus to ""research"" upgrades. Not necessarily money, but materials, creatures, etc. Maybe have to choose between two different upgrades to create a fairly unique Samus."
Metroid,35gkmr,KarjarA,2,Thu May 14 14:45:10 2015 UTC,"Retro devs wanted to do that in Corruption, but Sakamoto  opposed because apparently he didn't know what a bounty hunter is: http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/08/29/a-space-bounty-hunter-in-texas?page=8"
Metroid,35gkmr,Anggul,2,Wed May 13 18:39:58 2015 UTC,Fucking Sakamoto again.
Metroid,35gkmr,KarjarA,5,Wed May 13 22:18:52 2015 UTC,"Replayability, or atleast side quests with other planets and mysteries to explore that do not contribute to the main game, maybe you get an energy tank or a powerup that isnt necessary. I just dont want to sit at home after 20 hours of Metroid and be like ""Well, that was the Metroid game I waited 8 years for, lets wait another few years now"""
Metroid,35gkmr,Anggul,4,Sun May 10 14:49:21 2015 UTC,"Controls-wise, the second analog stick means we can look around using that like most first person games instead of the terrible 'hold R and quickly look where you need to' system of Prime 1 & 2. Sure I got used to them back then, but going back to them now it's awful.  Also a melee option. One of the best parts of Other M was that the combat involved the suit as more than just protection, you could use that increased strength and durability to fight. It always felt stupid having to constantly backpedal away from things while wearing a power suit that should allow me to grab them and beat them to death or shove my cannon down their throat and blow them apart, or even just bash them away to give myself some breathing room.  They touched on this idea with the additional grapple beam uses in Corruption and that was great, it felt really fluid, I just think they can expand on that idea."
Metroid,35gkmr,Butter_Is_Life,2,Sun May 10 13:47:50 2015 UTC,"I used to think about Meele options in a prime game too, but I dont want it to be an offensive option, as the focus of Metroid is still ranged combat. Maybe a sparta kick to get enemies away from you. Im not sure, I just want Meele to be worse than ranged."
Metroid,35gkmr,Model_Omega,3,Sun May 10 14:53:26 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, guns beat swords. My point is that if something gets in your face you should be able to knock it away instead of backpedalling around the place or grapple it while you blow it's brains out with your gun."
Metroid,35gkmr,xooxanthellae,2,Sun May 10 19:16:03 2015 UTC,"I also want them to showcase how physically strong the suit is, Samus is basically a juggernaut. Im sure she can just rip pirates apart, but then again, doing it from a safe distance is better."
Metroid,35gkmr,Julum,1 point,Sun May 10 20:27:44 2015 UTC,"I agree. She as an amazing powersuit that never shows the physical power aspect of it. Haven't played Other M so I didn't even know about the melee functions. Would be pretty sweet to see implemented, even if in a minor way"
Metroid,35gkmr,tstarboy,1 point,Sun May 10 21:37:14 2015 UTC,"Of course, there's no reason for her to put herself in more danger for no reason, and a gun (especially a missile) will kill them faster than a beating. Just a bit more close-range capability for cramped confines or particularly fast enemies would be cool. It shouldn't replace shooting, but complement it.  It will require implementation of knock-back though. One of the only problems in the Prime games for me is that I just shot a guy with a missile and he was nudged back a tiny bit. How pathetic are these missiles? Add a bit of realism to shooting things, I can put multiple beam shots into something's face and it will keep on moving as if nothing happened."
Metroid,35gkmr,KedovDoKest,1 point,Mon May 11 07:46:38 2015 UTC,"Some kind of keep away option would be nice. Maybe swing the grapple beam around you to push away enemies, or slamming a Charge Shot into the ground as a forcepush of sorts."
Metroid,35gkmr,tstarboy,5,Tue May 12 20:02:50 2015 UTC,Well let's see here... assuming it's WiiU  -Option to use WiiMote/Nunchuk ala MP3  -Ability to take notes on map menu (ie mark down powerups you can't reach yet) either using WiiMote or Gamepad touch screen  -Free flying ship like was planned for MP3  That's about it as far as features go.

The gamepad, motion controls, or the GameCube controller  if you have an adapter for it. (I personally prefer the GC controls over Prime 3's motion controls) I would throw out the Grapple Lasso. I didn't see why it needed to exist. I don't expect anyone to agree with me for this one due to Other M, but I want it to have a story. But a good one that Sakamoto isn't allowed to touch. Keep him far, far away from Samus. And I also want decent amounts of sequence breaking that Nintendo doesn't fix with patches or rereleases."

Metroid,35eu1o,Laraeph,3,Sat May 9 21:51:53 2015 UTC,Someone wanna explain to me what happened and why?
Metroid,35eu1o,Jammintk,4,Sat May 9 22:38:47 2015 UTC,"From out of bounds, he clipped into the room that contains the cannon. The thing is, he made sure NOT to ""transition"" the map to the room he's in. That is, if you look at the map, the game still thinks he's in the previous room, the Temple.  So, when he uses the cannon, he gets shot in an adjacent direction to the room the game thinks he is. Because loading triggers are huge in Echoes, that happens to make him hit a loading trigger for a different room than the one he really is in - that's the game trying to anticipate him going towards another room that is accessible from the room the game thinks he is in.  So the effect of all that, is the room he actually is in (not the room the game thinks he is), is unloaded during the cannon animation. Which cancels the cannon animation improperly, causing him to retain cannon animation invincibility.  ... At least that's the best speculation for now, I believe."
Metroid,35eu1o,txcrnr,6,Sat May 9 23:02:19 2015 UTC,"When Samus is fired out of a Kinetic Orb Cannon, the morphball gains some special properties for a short time. These are insane damage (500,000 per frame to enemies vulnerable to it iirc) and invulnerability.  What Miles does in this trick is load a room with a mothball canon without going through any doors. The game thinks he is in the room he starts in in the video. When he enters the canon, the game freaks out a bit and tries to load the room he is ""currently in"" according the the game (the starting room) but the Metroid Prime games only ever have one or two rooms loaded at a time, so there's no room in RAM for the room he is actually in, so the room he is in unloads as the cannon fires.  Because he doesn't ever hit the end point for the cannon shot, the invulnerability effects applied to the Morph Ball never go away."

Metroid,35eu1o,MilesSMB,2,Sun May 10 03:17:15 2015 UTC,"For a proper explanation about this:  From out of bounds, you load and transition the game to Worker's Path (the room with the cannon). You transition back to Sanctuary Temple (i.e. make the game think you're in Sanctuary Temple; look at the minimap when he jumps on the door). The cannon is activated, and you go back in bounds in Worker's Path. Keep in mind that the game still thinks you're in Sanctuary Temple.  From here, he took the cannon and got fired from it. However, the game still thinks he's in Sanctuary Temple. Adjacent rooms are loaded when you hit invisible loading triggers, and in the case of Echoes, load triggers are absolutely massive, to the point where he hit a load trigger for a different room while being fired from the cannon. So upon hitting this trigger, Worker's Path is unloaded, you regain control of Samus, and retain the state of being shot from a cannon when morphed, i.e. morph ball invincibility."
Metroid,35eu1o,Laraeph,2,Mon May 11 22:43:33 2015 UTC,You forgot to mention the part where I enter a mothball canon.
Metroid,35eu1o,Laraeph,3,Tue May 12 02:27:18 2015 UTC,"Why does the cannon shoot you off into another room like that?  EDIT: Oh, maybe it's because he used it when he was in the other room.  EDIT 2: No, NVM. It shot him in the right direction, but the rest of the room wasn't loaded."
Metroid,35eu1o,Skull64,1 point,Sat May 9 17:40:59 2015 UTC,"Actually, the room deloaded around him while he was in the cannon fire.   That's because the canon shoots him towards another room adjacent to the one the game thinks he is :  look at the map, when he takes the cannon, the game thinks he's in the giant, circular room. So the game deloads the room he's in and starts loading another one. That cancels the cannon animation in a weird way, so he keeps some of the cannon-fire properties, including invincibility, and insane damage (500 000 per frame?) to ennemies vulnerable to it.  Note that this might change the routes for any% and 100% in this game. Because it's so easy and fast to pull off (compared to the old method of doing it anyway), and can do some crazy things (kill the entire adult phase of Chykka instantly for exemple)."

Metroid,35g4le,gOWLaxy,6,Sun May 10 02:43:48 2015 UTC,"Definitely echoes. I feel like retro really went all out with it. Prime one was them taking super metroid and translating it to 3d. Prime 2 was them taking the formula a bit farther to see what they could do with it. In my opinion it took everything that made prime 1 good and expanded upon it. There were more logbooks, more creative enemy designs, less stereotypical environments, and more of a challenge. I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment when I beat the game."
Metroid,35g4le,twinfyre,4,Sun May 10 07:01:10 2015 UTC,3 > 2 >= 1.  I prefer Corruption over Echoes for the same reason I like Echoes a bit better than Prime: more interesting environments and boss battles.
Metroid,35g4le,Blueeyedrat_,4,Sun May 10 06:05:30 2015 UTC,"Prime 2 is like Banjo-Tooie for me. Even though I feel that the first game of both series feels objectively better out of concise level design, the darker nature and expanded, more creative level tropes and art made it stand out.   One thing I rarely see people specifically mention about Prime 2's strengths is the story. Now Metroid I feel has always never paid much mind with story. It's always really simple, and is more in the lore of what is going on in an environment than it is any specific goal.  But I love that Prime 2 balanced story and gameplay so well, for me anyways. I mean, the lore is fantastic in Prime 1, but what was Samus' purpose there? First it's a distress signal, then there's Ridley, then you get your powers back, then you wander around getting items to get into some mystical room under the Temple. I adore Prime, but Samus' goals were all over the place.  I love how the story of Prime 2 felt like it naturally flowed without taking you out of control. The beginning is quite linear at first, funneling you through your first directive, which is to find out what happened to the Galactic Federation. But then it's clear what happened to them was something a lot more sinister, then your abilities are taken, but then the stakes are raised a little higher. U-Mos and the Luminoth I felt were brilliant ways to give Samus a goal and purpose beyond blowing up Space Pirates and Metroids and getting her powers back. The Chozo have always been some mystical, long dead ancestor, but the Luminoth still had a sliver of hope when you arrived. They're at the brink of defeat, locked away in stasis pods. The lore and statues have scans that remind you of Luminoth heroes who were many a farmer or simple denizen who was pulled into the war out of necessity. It felt like you weren't just out to destroy evil, but save what good was hanging on by a thread. I loved that they gave that to you as a goal, but it wasn't as force fed as Fusion, Other M, or even Prime 3 did. You were given your goal, a very noble and tense goal, but you still had this massive, interconnected world that wasn't split up into sectors or planets like Fusion or Prime 3. It was just a little extra kick of purpose that made things feel more coherently goal driven, but it didn't take away from the core of Metroid's gameplay of upgrading and exploration.  I also love how it showed off Samus' emotions and character better than Other M ever could. She shows respect for the dead Captain, closing his eyes after reading his log. She shows hesitation and caution when meeting U-Mos, refusing to lower her arm cannon until she's more sure of his story. She had plenty of character shown through small moments, and it's brilliant to me."
Metroid,35g4le,Butter_Is_Life,3,Sun May 10 20:28:19 2015 UTC,My favorite of the series was 2. I'd give them all 10/10 because they were all great but 2 really stuck out for me.   It gets a lot of criticism for its difficulty and the dark aether lowering health constantly thing but i felt that added to the challenge. My favorite boss had to be Quadraxis. IT was just SO big and the battle required you to be quick because there were no safe zones.
Metroid,35g4le,nintendobutt,3,Sun May 10 00:53:30 2015 UTC,"Corruption. Seems to be an unpopular opinion, but I like what I like."
Metroid,35g4le,Pacalakin,2,Fri May 15 19:40:32 2015 UTC,"Prime was the best version of Super Metroid in 3D.  Corruption was cool cause you could use Samus's ship, and for the Aurora units. But I didn't think it was better than Prime 1.  I didn't like 2 at all. Not sure where that whole Dark/Light mechanic came from but it wasn't a Metroid game IMO."
Metroid,35g4le,raptormeat,2,Sun May 10 03:32:36 2015 UTC,"They're all 10/10 games for me, but Echoes is my favourite. I find it has the best bosses, gameplay, environments, the key hunt was actually really fun for me and the dark world gave it a really good atmosphere."
Metroid,35g4le,Model_Omega,2,Sun May 10 19:44:36 2015 UTC,"I gotta go with Echoes. Everything about it makes you feel uncomfortable which really adds to the atmosphere of Dark Aether. I've heard complaints about the game being way more backtrack heavy than Metroid games aught to, and I do see that, but I feel like it adds to the uncomfortableness you and Samus are put into. The game forces you to revisit areas you don't necessarily want to. Taking small damage in Dark Aether makes you feel really weak and vulnerable since you can never go into a boss with full health which again, adds to the atmosphere. The game is tough! The enemies deal a lot of damage and you can die really easily, which again adds to the atmosphere. Plus the game is kind of a chore to start playing. It takes some mental preparation to get ready for all the stuff they're going to throw at you and even then you kinda don't wanna do it sometimes which makes you, the player, feel uncomfortable just like Samus would in that situation. Which again adds to the atmosphere  TL;DR Echoes has an amazing atmosphere and that's why it's my favourite in the Trilogy and probably the series as a whole"

However, the final collection task from prime 2 blew my mind a bit, because finally my obsession with scanning everything paid off.  For scores I'd say 1 and 2 get 9/10 while 3 gets more like 6 or 7...I was not keen on the planet-hopping, excessive motion controls (compared to 1 and 2 from the trilogy, where the motion controls felt so natural, 3 just seemed to shove them everywhere for the sake of it), the ability to ""control"" Samus' ship (mainly because you couldn't actually control it, you could just tell it to very specific things in very specific circumstances), and the fact that instead of the plot progressing due to the players actions, the players actions were directed by the plot...  Ultimately 2 > 1 > 3"
Metroid,35g4le,isienmai,1 point,Sun May 10 15:19:36 2015 UTC,"First one for sure. The environments feel much more vivid and unique. Places like Phendrana, Magmoor, Overworld and the Sunken Frigate all embody a theme. The colors jump out at you and I feel like the first one is very straight forward, gamer friendly and I can casually pick it up and play whenever and just have a good time. Echoes is a more challenging game and Corruption is more linear and a little bland in it's visuals. Prime is 10/10, Echoes is 9.5/10 and Corruption is a solid 9/10."
Metroid,35g4le,raiders4lyfe24,1 point,Tue May 12 06:43:34 2015 UTC,"The same order than the games were released.  Metroid Prime 1 is just amazing, not much to say about it. Varied landscapes, beautiful music, flawless controls. I could replay this game millions of times. Just perfect.  Metroid Prime 2 was also excellent, with a change of tone, and a much higher difficulty. I have a preference for Prime 1, but 2 is just behind. The light/dark world mechanic was really interesting.  Metroid Prime 3 was a good game too, but it lost the atmosphere that I love so much in metroid games. I didn't really feel alone, and I didn't really care for the other characters. The replayability value is lower than for the other games. But it was ambitious, with flawless gameplay as always, and is still a convincing ending to the trilogy."
Metroid,35g4le,BananaSplit2,1 point,Sun May 17 00:17:52 2015 UTC,"I love them all, but I think prime 1 should get credit for doing it first. Retro was going in blind, but on 2 and 3 they already had established a formula."
Metroid,35g4le,txcrnr,1 point,Sun May 10 12:36:16 2015 UTC,"1, 2, 3. Echoes loses its way emphasizing keys/locks and translation doors and the samey dark world aesthetic, and Corruption plays too casually with its abundance of NPCs, overextended prologue, and late-game escort missions. Prime is just about perfect.  Also, on replaying them all lately, I find the Dark Samus element to be kind of dopey. She's not an interesting antagonist, more an annoyance. Sometimes she cackles. The SA-X is equally superficial, but it at least feels intimidating and dangerous with the avoidance tactics.  Letter grades would be an A for the first and a B for the other two, because they still offer fun gameplay and impressive environment design."

Metroid,35edxh,xooxanthellae,1 point,Sat May 9 15:28:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Personally I think the first bit of Prime 1 is quite a slog, since you can't explore anything without the core basics you have to hunt down like the Morph Ball, Bombs, etc. Just tough out the necessities you get in the Chozo Ruins and the rest should be smoother sailing."

It is possible that they are the offspring of Draygon or separate members of the same species, and are colored greyish.  They slowly sink into quicksand in various Maridian chambers, but can be stopped from doing so when frozen by Samus with the Ice Beam, and killed if shot with the Plasma Beam. They are able to eject projectiles from their tails in a straight line toward Samus, even when hidden under the sand. A unique, seemingly docile group of Evirs also appear prior to Samus' battle with Draygon and, after the creature's death, they drag the remaining corpse beneath the sand. These Evirs are colored green, and possess only four legs rather than six as seen in the greyish variants. These may be caretakers/labor workers and, based on their colors, seem to be more closely related to Draygon than the hostile Evirs.

Metroid,35fcjx,JiraiyaSenpai,5,Sat May 9 20:26:33 2015 UTC,"As others said, Super Metroid isn't a remake of Metroid 1, it's a sequel.  However, it is sort of a spiritual remake. As you've noticed, you revisit Zebes. The first area you see is the LAST area from Metroid 1 (including Mother Brain's busted, empty tank), but you soon start to follow the tracks from the original Metroid - Crateria, Brinstar, Norfair. It's all different, and there's tons of new stuff that wasn't in the original (tons). It's a pretty cool mix of nostalgic with a lot more content, polish, features, etc.  I think this is part of what makes Super Metroid such a great game. It's a fully different game, but in another sense it is kind of a re-do. They got to take a good game that has not aged well at all and kinda-sorta remake it into a legendary game that is still amazing to play today."

Metroid,359sdu,Mr_Pennybags,40,Fri May 8 08:29:16 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's definitely the greatest starter game in the series, but its exploration elements are severely limited compared to Super Metroid or Prime. It does condense the whole Metroid experience into a very nice package, but yeah I'd say Super Metroid is still a better Metroid game."
Metroid,359sdu,ozzAR0th,1 point,Fri May 8 09:05:40 2015 UTC,Agreed.
Metroid,359sdu,JeremyFitzgerald,17,Sat May 9 04:17:54 2015 UTC,"I always felt as if Fusion was the better of the two, with Fusion being the more ""batshit crazy"" secrets and gameplay."
Metroid,359sdu,linktm,11,Fri May 8 13:31:41 2015 UTC,I completely disagree. Fusion is by far better and Super even more better than both. Except for the escape end and the controls I don't really see where are the good points compared to the 2 others.
Metroid,359sdu,Satiie,7,Fri May 8 10:11:30 2015 UTC,"It has the classic zones and bosses, and its fast-paced controls are sweet as hell, so in that regard I agree, it's a remake of the game that every other 2D installment is based off of so that's fairly logical. However, I do wish that the game was longer as it has become hard for me to NOT beat it within an hour. I also think it should have ended where the original game did, the whole Zero Suit escape sequence feels out of place in a game where you otherwise have many different ways to progress, and the Ridley Robot is a very underwhelming last boss as it really isn't of any importance.  It's definitely the best game to introduce someone to the franchise, and I agree in a sense that it's the best representation of the franchise since it has all the classic things in it, but it does also have its flaws. With that said, it is my 3rd favorite game in the franchise, only behind Super and Prime, so I do still love it, it's easily the game I've played the most in the series because of how easy it is to pick up.  Also, it seems that there is a lot of praise for Fusion in this thread, and while it's good it does suffer from a fair share of problems, a lot of them being in common with many of Other M's flaws actually. As far as the definitive Metroid experience Fusion is way off, same for Prime 2 and 3 for that matter."
Metroid,359sdu,Masterofknees,2,Fri May 8 10:19:33 2015 UTC,"problems, a lot of them being in common with many of Other M's flaws actually.   How so?  Edit: Sorry, I thought you were talking about Zero Mission. If you're talking about Fusion's linearity and tendency to lock you on that linear path with arbitrarily locked doors, etc, being similar to Other M, I wholeheartedly agree.  That said, I think Other M was WAY worse about it, and had a whole host of other issues. The gameplay of Fusion itself was solid, with amazing atmosphere (one of the most eery games I've ever played) and some nice original enemy design. The only other flaw I find in Fusion is how, in addition to being linear, it locks you into one specific way of doing everything. You can no longer use well-timed wall jumps to sequence break, etc.. This is the main reason I prefer Zero Mission, even though I love Fusion (which was my first Metroid game)."
Metroid,359sdu,xwatchmanx,3,Fri May 8 13:16:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like I said I still like Fusion, and Other M obviously has a shit-ton of other issues that are damning to it, it was just an observation I made when I replayed Fusion not too long ago, a lot of the flaws from Fusion were carried over into Other M and amplified."
Metroid,359sdu,Masterofknees,2,Fri May 8 13:44:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah. It's funny how people give Other M flack for the same issues, but not Fusion. I guess it's because Fusion was less noticeably intrusive about it. Linearity is definitely a flaw for Metroid standards, but from a regular gameplay standard, it's just a design choice. And many of us kids born in the early 90s who didn't experience Metroid until Fusion came out didn't have anything else to compare it to."
Metroid,359sdu,xwatchmanx,3,Fri May 8 14:23:18 2015 UTC,"I think the difference was that with Fusion, the story they told and the linearity that it brought with it were still well told and well done. Most of it was believable, and even the least believable parts of it (like, to me, the data download to get an ability shenanigans) was still not too hard to swallow. The linearity made sense in the context of the story,  and the story was believable and understandable. So, the linearity was relatively easy to tolerate.   With Other M, you get a rehash of almost every single plot point of Fusion, only now very few of the restrictions and story points are believable. Like, Samus not using her gear because she didn't want to make Adam uncomfortable (because a fiery hell run is TOTALLY comfortable for Samus). Cloning Metroids makes sense (and hey, everyone's doing it!). But cloning Ridley? Why? The story was unbelievable, and poorly told,  and so the linearity that it brought with it was unjustifiable.   Granted, you can go oooon and on about Other M's flaws. But the linearity of the recent Metroid games is a byproduct of the increased amount of story-telling, and when the story sucks  and you didn't want the linearity in the first place, it makes it easy to shit on one game, and defend the other."
Metroid,359sdu,Ad_Hominem_Phallusy,3,Fri May 8 16:53:48 2015 UTC,Fusion was my first metroid game. I remember shitting my eight year old pants at every S-ax encounter.
Metroid,359sdu,RGSagahstoomeh,4,Fri May 8 14:27:14 2015 UTC,"I swear dude, I still shudder at the SA-X encounters, even though I'm 25 now.  Samus' PTSD breakdown over Ridley in Other M doesn't come even CLOSE to the level of PTSD I got over the SA-X. XD I remember being too scared to sleep as a kid because I kept thinking the SA-X was going to hunt me down and kill me."

Metroid,359sdu,Mourossonero,3,Sun May 10 02:27:33 2015 UTC,"a lot of them being in common with many of Other M's flaws actually   I disagree. I can only guess that by flaws you mean things like more linear progression guided by the story, and I can't say that's any flaw at all, I think it was perfectly executed along with just about every other weirder thing that game did to Metroid. Other M just had a smaller for no good reason world and a crap story.  I'm enjoying the praise for Fusion here, it's my personal favorite of the 2D Metroids for all the different things it did so well, though I can agree it's not the ""definitive"" metroid experience also because of those deviations."
Metroid,359sdu,powermad80,2,Fri May 8 11:10:28 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the somewhat slower gameplay of Fusion, for me Zero Mission feels sometimes like it's been sped up 2x, but this is just personal (I can also see the appeal of the quicker progression and faster action).  The linear story of Fusion with the close guidance of the computer is not bad, I liked the story of it, although on the end it feels restrictive. I'd have loved to be able to change around some order just slightly, get a power up little earlier by doing some advanced things (which you'll know once you've beaten it the first time), so just generally have more freedom. This is one of the reasons I often come back to ZM as well, it's definitely interesting to change your playthrough a bit and have more freedom at what and how you want to achieve the general objective.  Also, Fusion inspired my name I use everywhere online, it was my first GBA game (also along the first electronic game ever) and it made a deep impact."
Metroid,359sdu,METROID4,4,Sat May 9 00:02:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's really a matter of what's more important to you in a game. I prefer Super Metroid's detailed art style over Zero Missions, and the music for Super is far, FAR superior. The bosses of Zero Mission aren't as good as Super Metroid, and SM's aren't as good as Fusion's imho. The storytelling in Super Metroid is better, and moreover the story is more interesting. The environments of Super are better too, I wasn't really feeling Chozodia and the pirate ship is little more than serviceable. They don't have the character and story of the Wrecked Ship or Maridia.  For me Super Metroid is the definitive experience because it's the best examples of what makes Metroid special as opposed to simply extremely great."
Metroid,359sdu,PhazonZim,4,Fri May 8 11:24:52 2015 UTC,"I actually agree.  Zero Mission never had anything as annoying as the quicksand rooms, and I much prefer the jumping physics of ZM and Fusion to the floatiness of Super.  I still don't understand why there was a run button.  The only thing lacking in Zero Mission to me is the selection of bosses which Super easily has.  Otherwise I'll take Zero Mission over Super any day."
Metroid,359sdu,Ecto-Cooler,3,Fri May 8 12:19:57 2015 UTC,"Zero Mission is definitely my favorite 2D game in the series for the reason you state.  I think part of the reason that people consider Super the best is the same reason that Zelda: Ocarina of Time is considered the best: It was the original ""innovator"" of its series' modern gameplay style, and since it's been around a lot longer, people have had a lot more time to appreciate it.  My only regret about Zero Mission is how much smaller than Super it is, by virtue of it being a handheld game. I would love to see a game with Zero Mission's mechanics, but as big or bigger than Super Metroid."
Metroid,359sdu,xwatchmanx,7,Fri May 8 13:15:14 2015 UTC,"lifts flameshield  I don't like Super Metroid. Like, I really don't like Super Metroid. The controls are too clunky and floaty, using select to switch items is one of the biggest design flaws in any game I've played, the secrets are too cryptic, and the bosses are too hard. My biggest issue is the conrols, though. I have to stop moving (leaving me vulnerable to enemies) when switching items, and I can't do it when I'm paused. Samus slows down when she jumps, which breaks the flow of movement. Fusion fixed most of the control problems, but was too linear. Then Zero Mission came along and fixed bombhopping and walljumping, as well as bringing nonlinearity back. Super Metroid is a fine game. It brought the series out of obscurity and created a great formula. But Zero Mission perfected it.  peeks over flame shield  Is it safe?"
Metroid,359sdu,theweirdbrosinc,3,Fri May 8 21:39:48 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised no one has mentioned yet that you can rebind the controls. Swapping Item cancel and item select fixes this problem completely. Things may feel slightly awkward when you first start playing the game, but the more you play it and adjust, the more you'll realize that Super Metroid actually offers insanely tight controls. For example, wall jumping, when you get used to it, allows for so much more control than any other Metroid game. See some tower climbs like this or this."

Metroid,359sdu,METROID4,2,Sat May 9 00:08:05 2015 UTC,"if zero mission didnt hold your hand so much, then yeah"
Metroid,359sdu,samus1225,2,Fri May 8 13:20:50 2015 UTC,"I don't like how short Zero Mission is, or how hand-holdy the Chozo statues are.  It's also awkward how the last area is somewhat isolated from the rest of the game, so going back and cleaning up the map with your final upgrades feels like a chore.  The sequence breaking, though, is great.  There are a ton of secret passages that let you skip most upgrades, fight Ridley first, etc.  So even though the game seems quite linear, there's a whole lot of room for experienced players to explore."
Metroid,359sdu,Commkeen,2,Fri May 8 13:30:37 2015 UTC,"Another thing I really love about Zero Mission is that its hard mode is legitimately hard. Many games have their ""hard mode"" be filled with a bunch of cheap deaths and gameplay that forces you to grind out a lot of trial and error just to get from point A to point B.  Hard mode in Zero Mission doesn't have any of that. Deaths are almost always caused by you screwing up somewhere and you really have to play a lot tighter due to the scarce resources you get from items."
Metroid,359sdu,surgingchaos,1 point,Fri May 8 14:56:25 2015 UTC,"Hard mode was hard on that game. It took me probably twenty tries as a kid to beat that eyeball monster that gives you the charge beam, because you have to fight it perfectly and not get hit once while its eye is open."
Metroid,359sdu,GingeousC,2,Sat May 9 23:47:33 2015 UTC,It's the most focused 2D game and I like how I can beat it on the long bus trip I have to take once a month.  Prime will alway be my favorite Metroid.
Metroid,359sdu,Laureolus,2,Fri May 8 15:01:07 2015 UTC,"Zero Mission is incredibly polished, and definitely the best introduction to Metroid for the average player (though I could see the argument for Prime taking that role just as well).  I used to play a TON of Zero Mission back in the day, but I rarely touch it compared to Super and the Prime Trilogy now.  I think the biggest issue with the game is that it's a little TOO streamlined.  When you take speed running strats into account, Zero Mission's movement options are far more limited, and it thus takes you much longer to travel through rooms than it does in Super.  The dash button is clunky, but once you get used to it it's hard to go back.  The issue with streamlining also plays into the game's length - with the game telling you where to go very often, and the bosses being relatively easy missile spam until the boss dies.  Finally, the game is so streamlined and polished that to my understanding, all of the movement options, shortcuts, and sequence breaks were put in by the developers.  IMO Super has a nice balance between intentional and likely unintentional options.  Fusion had a lot of great moments, and probably the best boss fights between the three, but it's always my least favorite.  I think it stems from the constant stop-and-go, consult a navigation room, and don't deviate from the current mission.  In the other games I feel like I can freely explore anywhere on the map and stumble across something cool or useful.  Fusion felt like it would gate you to specific Sectors for plot, and in practice I was practically always in the Sector that the game wanted me to be in.  The environments felt a lot blander too - probably from the abundant plain, man-made rooms.  I also hated that you couldn't wall jump up a single wall."
Metroid,359sdu,metroidman388,1 point,Fri May 8 15:36:02 2015 UTC,"Eh...I disagree. I think getting 100% asks too much of the player, and in turn the game despises you by turning up the difficulty on the final boss ten fold.  It's still REALLY REALLY REALLY good, and the best way to enter the series for newcomers, but at the other end of the spectrum it's not."
Metroid,359sdu,KingBroly,1 point,Fri May 8 14:12:10 2015 UTC,"Not sure why people are complaining about the handholding when the fun is in ignoring that and replaying the game to play it in different ways. In that sense, zero mission is one of the better designed games, moreso than super IMO."

See, IMO, the very fast gameplay mechanics of Metroid Zero Mission are better than those of any 2D Metroid game. Plus wall-jumping against the same wall, guys and girls, we all love it. The morphball shinespark was also neat. Samus controlled more fluidly on that game.  But the athmosphere of the BSL, the fear of the prey vs its predator and the navigation rooms (lol) made Fusion more salient.  This brings up my final point, what is a definitive Metroid experience? Is it the game which has the best gameplay or story or exploration?   Gameplay : I think Zero Mission wins it  Story : Super or Fusion Exploration : Super  Overall better experience...

Both sides would have to race to retrieve the new discovery first. Then, someone would betray their respective leader, delaying them and allowing their sworn enemy to reach the new discovery first.  The group that arrived first would activate the item, and the other group would show up just in time to ruin it. If it was energon it would explode, if it was a weapon of some sort, it would go off but instead of killing people it would just modify them somehow, and if it was a neutral transformer they would just join the respective side and fight everyone else."
Metroid,3561ny,Jedi_Outcast,3,Fri May 8 01:24:23 2015 UTC,"The protoform episodes were the best. So much anticipation, finding out what the new character would be. I remember the Rampage and Inferno ones in particular."
Metroid,3561ny,gediojam,2,Fri May 8 01:30:49 2015 UTC,Definitely. Yeah as a kid I had a really inconsistent schedule so I couldn't watch the episode each day. Felt like I'd always see them build up to something cool and then never figure out what happened because I'd missed something.

Metroid,35916s,Akebouh,2,Fri May 8 13:11:01 2015 UTC,I have looked but I do not know what emulator to get or where to get one. I also have no idea how to use one I had one once for the snes I could not figure out. Same thing for rom I do not know where to get it.  I also don't really want to start the game over. Its also the only snes game i care for.
Metroid,35916s,Akebouh,3,Fri May 8 13:17:06 2015 UTC,"It's not that hard to play on an emulator (google ""super metroid rom"" & ""Emulator snes"" ) Dl SNES9x , use it, launch the rom and play  And because you were playing online i think we can't do anything for you because the rom is on the server and not your computer :/"

Metroid,35916s,Elusive2000,3,Fri May 8 04:08:10 2015 UTC,Looks like maybe a corrupt ROM or a glitch. Because the screenshot is so nice I would assume you're playing on an Emulator? Do you have any save states you could go back to?
Metroid,35916s,InsanityRaptor,1 point,Fri May 8 12:57:12 2015 UTC,I am playing on an online emulator i saved the game when i walk through a door planing to stop for the night. When i cam back the hole map was changed so i don't have a previous save state. If I kill my self in the game it brings me to Samus's ship in the weird map not my last save state.  I really do not want to restart my game what can I do? Thank you

Metroid,3593sm,I-Downvoted_You,7,Fri May 8 03:19:51 2015 UTC,"A game I've heard good things about is Axiom Verge. Heavily Metroid inspired, and it looks pretty fun.  Another, being Xeodrifter. I've played through this one, it's short, but very fun and also very Metroidesque.   Other M has some decent parts, but, not enough in my opinion to play through, or for that matter, even buy. What I can suggest, is play Fusion again. If you played it when it was new, it has to have been almost 13 years.   PS: You're out of your mind, Zero Mission is great."

Still I picked it up for $5 so I can only complain so much. If it's the last one you haven't played go for it. It's...an experience.   Awesome for clearing OG Metroid. Zero Mission is pretty much its own game though beyond a few rooms and the general objectives. The map is completely different, you have new power-ups, hidden routes to discover, and the gameplay is a step-up from Fusion. I'd recommend giving it a go before Other M."
Metroid,3593sm,kirbymastah,3,Fri May 8 08:11:06 2015 UTC,"Replay Fusion, try Other M (just don't expect a great story, just a fun 2D-3D marriage and decent gameplay)"

Well, the SA-X fight was fine, but the second form doesn't even count, the X form was boring, and then the Omega Metroid was rather anticlimactic, and dying at any point set you back before any of it."
Metroid,3563sg,PhazonZim,2,Thu May 7 13:19:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know how commonly known it is, but SA-X's second form can be skipped. If you keep unloading charged shots into her while she transforms she'll jump once and then die. I don't know if it's a glitch but I never actually had to fight her unless I actually decided to wait (not that there's much of a fight)."
Metroid,3563sg,cheetahblades,2,Thu May 7 13:22:26 2015 UTC,"I feel like the Omega Metroid isn't really meant as a final challenge as much as 1) fanservice 2) atmosphere and 3) something to show you just how powerful you are after getting the ice beam, kinda like what they did at the end of Zero Mission"
Metroid,3563sg,Nintendan95,6,Thu May 7 18:33:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the SA-X is one of the main reasons why Fusion is my favourite 2D Metroid game. Everything about it. The sounds of it footsteps. The slow and menacing way it roams the B.S.L with its arm resting on its Arm Cannon. The fact is unsparingly obliterates every door or obstacle with a super missile. The music that plays when it enters the room. It's all so fucking scary and adds this really interesting dynamic to the game that feels so different when you realise you're playing as Samus fucking Aran. I love it. I love it all."
Metroid,3563sg,ZeroKarasu,3,Thu May 7 13:54:08 2015 UTC,"Running from enemies isn't that uncommon. /u/PhazonZim points out some very good examples. But on a whole, the idea of a Stealth-Based game is based on the idea that you don't have the weapons to go in guns blazing."

Every mission is like this. And unlike other stealth games, the missions have a very open-ended exploration feel to them. So it's familiar territory to a Metroid fan. One thing I love about the games is that every challenge has multiple ways to complete it. You could accomplish your mission without being spotted, or you could be like me and knock out every single guard before they see me."

But seriously, we are never really shown Samus outside of these missions. Maybe she meditates until her next mission, maybe she competes in intergalactic arm wresting competitions (complete with backwards hat), maybe she goes to clubs and dances until she gets a new mission. We don't know because we are never shown or told about it. All we know, from the games, is that she was raised by the Chozo after her family was killed and was apart of the Galactic Federation army (or whatever they're called). That's it. Everything else is just player speculation or non-canonical additions.   Samus only trains.   Which gives me thoughts of her playing with miniature train sets, complete with old school conductor outfit."

This way you'll get some nice sharp lines for targeting reticules and such.  For the rest, first, if you're not using a tablet, get a tablet. Wacom tablets are the cream of the crop as far as tablets are concerned, but are a little on the expensive side if you're starting out. The good news is that there are some pretty decent alternatives.  If a tablet isn't in the cards yet, try sketching it out in pencil and paper and then coloring it digitally.  Second, fundamentals. Fundamentals is how you improve as an artist. There are quite a few things an artist has to study, but search for ""Art Fundamentals"" on google or Youtube for a good place to start. And I can't tell you how useful Youtube is for art tutorials.  Third, plenty of reference.

As for Tablet, I'm using an Ugee board because it was an affordable price of $50, it's quite difficult to use properly because it's for right handed people and and I'm a left handed person. It still works out. I don't use Photoshop, Don't know how to use it nor do I have the option of using, I use Krita, a free Drawing desktop.  Money is really tight for me since I'm in college and parents provide for me and college in exchange that I don't work and focus on school. I make due with what I got. Thanks again for the tips."
Metroid,350hco,badgeometry,3,Wed May 6 03:30:47 2015 UTC,"Happy to help man!  The Ugee tablet will be fine to start. Once you get used to working on a tablet you can focus on saving up for something nicer.  I haven't used the program you're using, but I'm sure it's as good a place as any to start!  With respect to Photoshop specifically, they have a subscription program now that's $10/month. If that's still out of your price range, check put a program called Gimp. It's 100% free and every bit as full featured as Photoshop.  Keep practicing man. If you put in the time and effort you'll be every bit as good as the rock stars at Retro Studios before you know it!"

Metroid,34vjpl,kindarilwraja,4,Tue May 5 22:39:24 2015 UTC,You're making me wonder if there's an age difference between those who love Prime 2 and those who are less enamored of it. That you say you were so young when you played Prime just makes me ponder.
Metroid,34vjpl,TheHeadlessOne,4,Tue May 5 00:11:07 2015 UTC,"Let me just say it was a great game, well constructed, and a reasonable followup to Metroid Prime. That being said, I believe it was the weakest of the trilogy by a good margin (one everyone should play)  My problem was, in every way that it differed, it weakened siginifcantly. The new beam system was predictable and boring; Light beat Dark, Dark beat Light. There wasnt any real intuitive learning going on (wave>robots is an interesting relationship you have to discover, for instance-but anything ""Dark ____"" being weak to light beam? not so much) and because enemies were so tanky and resisted opposite energies so strongly, the interesting properties of each beam (light burning, dark freezing) was 99% of the time minor flavor rather than compelling features  The Ammo system was ultimately pointless. The general purpose of an ammo system is to encourage swapping between multiple guns so you dont stick with a single one you enjoy and fail to learn the traits of another, as well as providing unique pickups for the player (loot is fun). However given the nature of Metroid Prime, there are already oodles of pickups and youll be constantly swapping weapon types already due to enemy weaknesses and doors; Ammo is at best trivial because youll have enough and it spawns often enough you wont have to worry about it, or you will run out and be entirely ineffective whenever you need it most-very rarely does it hit the balance required to make ammo systems compelling. This also serves to discourage experimentation with weapon types, because you dont want to waste 20% of your ammo supply on a few charge beams when you arent sure it will actually take out the threat  The Dark world is a nifty idea-I love how its been done in other games like Zelda (all the time really-they love alternate dimensions, be it Dark world of aLttP, the future of LoZ, time travellling in the Oracle titles, even the mini trial zones of TP and SS) but the toxic atmosphere stopped being threatening after you acquire the dark suit. It served to discourage exploration as you were constantly looking for safe bubbles, and the slow heal function of the bubbles often encouraged you to spend minutes at a time chilling out to refill health before your next trip onward. People thought Samus was slow in Prime? She was often virtually Immobile due to the gameplay habits the light gems encourage  The story was practically the exact same as Metroid Prime-another ancient alien race brought to destruction after the ecosystem was wrought by a meteor impact. The world felt very similar as well- Agon Wastes looked awfully similar to the Chozo Ruins, the Bog looked and sounded like the overworld (complete with a sunken high-tech ship-like region) The Fortress was heads-and-tails a better aesthetic and level design over the Phazon Mines (which had a sort of high-tech-fortress feel, but the fortress turned it up to 11) but then you had to go through the Dark version of each world, which all had the same dreary aesthetic. For a series known for its diverse environments, the Dark worlds were woefully predictable and repetitive  And talk about predictable and repetitive. The world is clearly segmented into three distinct 'worlds'. Each one involves three keys to find the boss, which is some large creature eventually infected by the darkness. Every world plays out the same way. In Metroid Prime 3, the setup seems similar-lower the seed's shield, go there, fight a boss, get a hyper upgrade. But you take down all the shields in totally different ways each time  So what did it actually bring new? The Echo visor was totally worthless outside of its puzzles as was the Dark Visor (in contrast, there was an effort to use the X-ray visor to locate breakable walls and such, and the thermal visor did work well to navigate dark corridors)  Oh, and this may be a minor gripe to some, but the scans. There are so many bosses you get only a slight moment to scan or you miss them forever. You better scan every boss immediately, because if you dont get them in 10 seconds the ooze will change them. Oh and you better look in every window and scan just in case youll be locked in a ball form for the boss. Oh and you know how in Quadraxis you need to use the echo visor to grab onto his weakpoints? Halfway through that youre supposed to switch to scan visor, or you'll miss out on a short-lived ""stunned mode"" scan. There are so many of these super easy to miss scans  Credit where its due-it had the best bosses of the series by far (Primes were alright but not very ambitious, Prime 3 were nifty but waaaayyyy too grindy due to being designed around Hypermode) shooting while grappling is absolutely a necessity, and the Screw Attack is brilliantly fun. Ultimately, it felt like it was trying to add on to the first game, but it fails to stand out reasonably enough to stand on its own, and in the vast majority of ways it differs feels pointless at best and tediously predictable and annoying at worst.   There is more to it, I can elaborate or give more critiques if you'd like. I just think that there were so many worthless to terrible mechanics in Metroid Prime 2, and very little that is really fresh, new and well constructed to encourage Metroid-like gameplay  EDIT: Again, to be clear, I am a big fan of MP2. I only bother to get this analytic on games I really really love or really really hate (for 'hate' ask me about Other M, the worst mostly-bug-free game I own) but like when comparing Pixar movies, youve gotta get nitty gritty to distinguish the strengths between them"
Metroid,34vjpl,JinormusJ,3,Wed May 6 02:23:48 2015 UTC,I prefer 2  Just about everything about it was in addition or an improvement over 1  http://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/32leca/why_does_everyone_seem_to_hate_metroid_prime_2/
Metroid,34vjpl,LuxShadow1,2,Tue May 5 19:30:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with you on a lot of points there. To me, Prime 2 gave you a greater sense of danger and isolation, and while their wasn't a lot of variation in terms of the environments, both light and dark aether did look pretty cool at time. I actually preferred Prime 2 over Prime 3, because Prime 3 forces a lot of things down you, and the opening sequence is annoying.  My favourite Metroid game would have to be Zero Mission, since it is a fantastic remake, and I keep it close to my heart."
Metroid,34vjpl,Marec_Kaal,2,Mon May 4 23:28:19 2015 UTC,"I think I have to give it to Metroid Fusion.   It takes super-powerful hunter and turns her into prey that's being hunted at nearly every turn, and until you get later into it and have acquired your abilities, at times you still just have to run and hide. The bosses are widely varied in the various environments, and are challenging to figure out how to beat on your first playthrough. It also gives you a sense of urgency by denying you access to areas that you had already been in and giving you objectives, even though they're usually beating a boss or recovering an ability.  I love the entire franchise, but Fusion has got to be my favorite out of all of it, with Prime following as a very close second.  I recently started games of both Fusion (playing on DS) and Prime (Gamecube), so I'll get back to Prime 2 after I finish the first one. If only I still had my GBA so I could link Fusion to Prime... I don't yet have a Wii or WiiU, so Prime 3 and Other M will have to wait for me."
Metroid,34vjpl,Weltall548,2,Tue May 5 18:23:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with Prime 2 being the best. It's bosses, lore, and poweups are better than 1's. It's also the largest Metroid game."
Metroid,34vjpl,XxenoX,2,Wed May 6 03:49:58 2015 UTC,"It may just be because it was my first Metroid game, but I also prefer Prime 2 over Prime 1 (not by much mind you), and it's my favorite in the series.  I know a lot of people didn't like how the Agon Wastes felt empty, but I really liked how empty it felt considering there used to be bug people there and now there isn't, and I've always been a fan of desert zones.  Even though the dark and light beams could be seen as uncreative, electricity, ice, and fire are not much better, and the ammo never really bothered me (probably because it was my first Metroid).  I know a lot of people weren't too keen on really hard bosses, but at the same time people like dark souls so we can easily equate that to differing tastes.  Besides, they aren't that hard once you figure out what's going on."

Metroid,34nl3o,PrimeSamus,12,Sat May 2 22:20:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe the same conclusion led to the decreased amount of scanning in Prime 3. Personally I think scanning is great, but I can see how a lot of people would rather play the game than read. The thing is though, scanning is largely optional, so I don't get why anyone would complain about it."

Metroid,34np5x,_GS,8,Sat May 2 21:00:51 2015 UTC,"Presumably because metroids are the X's greatest enemy, and the omega metroid is substantially more metroid than Samus at that point in time.  I take it to be similar to the scene with the other SA-X fighting off waves of metroids while ignoring you entirely earlier in the game."
Metroid,34np5x,metroidman388,7,Sat May 2 21:00:59 2015 UTC,"It went for the bigger threat : Omega Metroid. In its eyes, it pretty much saw a mortally wounded part-metroid and an adult Omega (since Queen is only for special metroids) so its instincts told it to attack the biggest threat."
Metroid,34np5x,henryuuk,5,Sat May 2 22:27:11 2015 UTC,"It didn't defend Samus, it just though that Metroid are bigger ennemies."
Metroid,34np5x,Satiie,2,Sat May 2 22:09:12 2015 UTC,"One theory: It saw Samus as a formidable opponent since it retreated from the fight earlier.  Most likely:  It has a higher priority to kill metroids (I.E the restricted labs, it was too busy trying to shoot the metroids and ignores you)  and since it was an Omega metroid, it was more of a threat than you were."

Metroid,34ng98,Tumblr9gagredditor,8,Sat May 2 19:38:11 2015 UTC,"Skipping the Tallon item loss would require one of:   Messing with memory relays so the landing cutscene is no longer active, Warping to a different room than Landing Site from the Frigate, Changing your position in Landing Site before the room finishes loading while you don't have control so you're not inside the cutscene trigger, Some other bizarre glitch.   Basically, you're not going to keep your items without a glitch that would allow you to do MUCH MUCH more than this."
Metroid,34ng98,MilesSMB,3,Sat May 2 21:46:53 2015 UTC,"Does triggering the ""chase after Ridley"" cutscene when you have IS do anything? People have tried that, right? Even though there's no known legitimate way to have IS at that point."
Metroid,34ng98,MilesSMB,5,Sat May 2 22:39:30 2015 UTC,"IS isn't a magical ""glitch everything"" button. That wouldn't do anything."
Metroid,34ng98,Parax0,2,Sat May 2 22:49:11 2015 UTC,Oh. That's too bad. I thought it was really weird and unpredictable when it came to triggering cutscenes with it.
Metroid,34ng98,SkippyJr2,3,Sun May 3 02:01:09 2015 UTC,"It's really not weird when you understand it... it's an old glitch and its effects are pretty well-understood by now. Lots of people seem to think it is capable of a lot more than it is, which I guess is natural since it's a really weird glitch that seems to behave randomly. All it actually does is just activate most things loaded in memory that can be activated by being touched. (There's some exceptions.) So IS is capable of grabbing a missile expansion that you are nowhere near, for example, but it can't activate a cutscene if there is no trigger currently in the room that activates it.  As for the Frigate escape, IS doesn't do anything unless you use boost or spider ball, neither of which you have during the frigate, so it can't do anything during that section of the game. The second thing is when you activate the cutscene trigger to go to Tallon IV, that's it; the cutscene + transition to Tallon Overworld both make you lose IS and it won't carry over and have any effect whatsoever in Landing Site. Third, even if it did and you were somehow able to use it in Landing Site before the landing cutscene starts without Boost Ball, the only effect it would have is... activating the cutscene. So it wouldn't be helpful in that scenario either.  So yeah, it's pretty safe to say IS is completely useless for this."
Metroid,34ng98,Parax0,2,Sun May 3 04:52:07 2015 UTC,"How about the reverse?  Can the initial version of Landing Site be accessed again and IS used to cause the cutscene again and trigger item loss?  Does the state of Landing Site change after you first leave it, when the music changes, or by some other condition?"

Metroid,34k1nj,ODIN111999,2,Sat May 2 02:11:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say soulless. It's just that the iris is too high, and there's no pupil. The red just make it look like a cyborg eye rather then just a regular eye drawn off."

As for her breast, there's nothing to apologize about.  She's well endowed, sure- but they're not ridiculously bloated with diamond hard nipples.  Honestly wouldn't of noticed if you didn't mentioned it.  So ya-  work on your poses."
Metroid,34k1nj,calabhan,6,Fri May 1 22:02:25 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't your pose be a bit stiff is you were sitting on the sloped part of a space ship anyway? I mean your weight has to go some where so you'd naturally adopt a stiff pose to focus all your weight down in to your hand, arse, and feet to make sure you don't slide off the bloody thing."
Metroid,34k1nj,TheZippofan,2,Fri May 1 23:21:43 2015 UTC,"If that's the problem, then alter the ship or the ""set"" entirely.  The subject of the piece is Samus, not anything else."
Metroid,34k1nj,metroidman388,4,Sat May 2 00:41:05 2015 UTC,"haha actually it was kinda a joke like if samus was told to be a pin up model, and she'd not know how to pose and would seem on edge with a sort of ""if you have any ulterior motives I will shoot you""  But i def do need to work on poses being less rigid in general!"
Metroid,34k1nj,metroidman388,2,Sat May 2 00:06:11 2015 UTC,I didn't think the pose was bad at all tbh.
Metroid,34k1nj,PhazonZim,-7,Sat May 2 02:14:20 2015 UTC,"If that's what you were going for, it doesn't translate at all.  If you want to draw a pin-up, don't go half way- draw her as a pin up.  And for god sake, don't try to mix pin up with action shot with pin up.  Those always go horribly wrong.  Again - it's decent work."

I think it's mostly from the back being curled forward and the neck being fairly vertical.  Maybe the head could shift forward a tiny bit?  [Edit] - Oh, and I think her gunship might be a bit small compared to Samus.  I'm looking specifically at the glass panel in the front and the size of her foot to infer scale."
Metroid,34k1nj,eridius,2,Fri May 1 21:47:51 2015 UTC,"The stiffness was to make her look cautious but after reading comments I think stiffness is considered a negative thing, so I may of made a bad choice, being natural with her neck going down and head tilting a bit may of been better choice thanks for tips.  as for gunship it was near this part of window http://i.imgur.com/9zj9WNY.jpg and it looked wrong without out but maybe I can find a better solution someday"

Metroid,34k1nj,txcrnr,-6,Sat May 2 02:13:46 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty nice painting, but honestly, your ""artistic liberties"" actually bothers me quite a lot. Besides the fact that her breasts are huge, you also made her suit not just form-fitting like a normal suit, but literally melded to her body as if it were, say, bodypaint. The way you drew them makes it look like you took a naked drawing, removed the nipples, and recolored it. That's a suit, not body paint. It should have at least have some effect on the actual shape of her breasts (and on the depth of cleavage, etc)."
Metroid,34k1nj,twinfyre,8,Sat May 2 01:36:29 2015 UTC,"Yup I have always liked body suits that form around the body, while we don't have material like that now adays and the canon zero suit doesn't even do that I can easily vision a vacuum packing sort of outfit in the future and I think that it would honestly fit the term ""Zero Suit"" better. It is much easier to just draw them like regular clothing with breasts almost as a single form due to fabric stretching but the cleavage was actually personal design choice as the fold between her breasts act like an arrow to her face, so despite actually taking a lot longer than cheaping out and making the fabric stretch, I think it was worth the time to take it further. Thank you so much for the opinion tho eridius!"
Metroid,34k1nj,txcrnr,5,Sat May 2 02:06:04 2015 UTC,"I get that you're going for a body suit made out of some sort of advanced material that lets it do things we can't do today, such as conform to every contour of the body. But such a suit would still affect her body, not just act like body paint. Remember, this suit is meant to allow her to perform acrobatic movements. While I applaud your ability to draw breasts that have a very natural shape to them (it's surprisingly rare to see that), I can't imagine that she'd be able to do any real acrobatic movement without a lot of difficulty and pain. The suit should serve as a support structure. I guess what I'm saying is that you should make the suit behave as though it had a built-in sports bra (while still remaining a skintight jumpsuit).  All that said, I bet you'd be popular if you decided to start doing NSFW paintings ;)"
Metroid,34k1nj,twinfyre,6,Sat May 2 02:36:36 2015 UTC,"Hmm yeah your absolutely right she'd slap herself in the face with a form fitting suit like this and loose balance unless it somehow restricted certain parts through armor or as you say a sports bra. I have to find a better line between fan service and breaking character. I don't really want to do nsfw stuff, i've always favored the middle ground. Thanks for the candid but respectful response, that's kinda rare haha."
Metroid,34k1nj,that_dude_you_know,6,Sat May 2 02:44:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you for taking my concerns seriously. I knew I'd get downvoted for that first reply, but your thoughtful responses make it worthwhile."

Metroid,34k1nj,Laureolus,1 point,Sat May 2 17:23:42 2015 UTC,"So... because she is ""sexualized"" she won't get hit in the face by her own breasts when she tries to do a flip? I don't think Biology works that way..."

Metroid,34k1nj,Laureolus,2,Sat May 2 04:14:19 2015 UTC,Tbf her boobs don't look like that in the games. They look like they're in a sports bra. I guess OmegaVesko TychoShiel feels like it's crossing the line into oversexualization. Idk.
Metroid,34k1nj,TychoShiel,3,Fri May 1 22:14:03 2015 UTC,"Eh, it varies, even when it's literally the same artist. Look at the Zero Mission ending shots, the third one looks more like OP's while the fourth one looks more like a sports bra."
Metroid,34k1nj,jklljk,0,Fri May 1 22:17:18 2015 UTC,"You're right. I should have said ""it doesn't go down to the cleavage in the games"".  EDIT: I should have said they aren't boob socks, like that_dude_you_know said. I'll bet TychoShiel wouldn't even be complaining if they weren't in boob socks and OP didn't try to bring attention to them in his title."
Metroid,34k1nj,TychoShiel,-2,Fri May 1 22:26:52 2015 UTC,"I like the point you're making, but it isn't even quite so much about how she looks, physically.  Look at the picture. As I said, it's clearly a pinup type of picture. She's posing, like a model. Why would she be doing that? Granted, her character is ambiguous, but this goes against the portrait of the hunter we've been painted by her brief dialogs throughout the games (I haven't played M:OM, so I can't speak for that one).  My point is that I don't fucking care how Samus looks. I don't even REALLY care that she's a woman, except that it would be really progressive if people would appreciate that she's a badass space cowboy moreso than a supermodel.  This image and its ilk, and the ending reward images in certain games of the actual series, and the Zero Suit in SSB, all of them spit in the face of what I loved about the character when I was growing up on the games: that she's a mean, barely-human space rogue with a mission, and with little desire for company. And the more people jack off like this, the more Nintendo seems to listen and respond in kind.  Wall of text, I know, sorry.  Incidentally, breasts that size are stupendously rare for a girl of that build, contrary to what certain media would suggest. They really are overboard, just not to the degree of literal stupidity that most artists achieve."
Metroid,34k1nj,Mortimer42,4,Fri May 1 22:33:15 2015 UTC,"My problem isn't with your ideals.  In fact, I honesty I agree : Samus, even with her power suit, has been sexualized way to often nowadays.  So you want to fix the problem? Thats great!  Pick up a pencil and get started.  Learning how to draw is not difficult, it just takes time.  I don't care how offensive someone's art is. In the the end, whatever that person did as an art is a form of self expression that I, or anyone, are not entitled to dictate.    This isn't necessarily directed at you.  Anyone is welcomed to criticize art.  This is just me blowing off steam towards those who take criticism a bit further and demand that someone's art should be altered or censored because of feels."
Metroid,34k1nj,TychoShiel,2,Sat May 2 00:34:39 2015 UTC,"I appreciate that a lot, thanks. I'm nothing if not critical, but I would never go so far as to demand someone change their art or their values without really wanting to.  I have so much other stuff that I'm busy with, I can't try to pick up art right now. I am a musician, though, and I think my thoughts from this thread is are going to end up in song form pretty soon."

My thought is that Nintendo might be putting her back into some very popular games to increase awareness, in a sense.

Not only that, it's something that you have been interacting with all game long - an Aurora Unit. Very tragic what happened to him, as well.  What I was disappointed with, however, was the lack of a time-down sequence, like at the end of most Metroid games. In fact, the entire game only has one at the middle of the game, and quite frankly it felt really anticlimactic that you don't actually have to flee anywhere, instead you have to fix some circuits. An interesting idea, since it forces you to be careful and precise in a moment of tension, but lackluster as the only sequence in the game.  It's even worse that they went all that way to mirror the ending of Super Metroid - defeat giant brain, then planet planet explodes, and Samus manages to get out in time - but there was no ""This planet is going to explode! Run back to the ship!"". Just cutscene to there!..."

Metroid,34l1wh,Hylian_Spud,8,Sat May 2 02:21:36 2015 UTC,"Well, you can get a SmashBros gamecube controller on amazon for $25.  Prime 2 exists on the Gamecube, but I'm not sure how much that will run used.  For the DS Lite you can get Metroid Zero Mission, which also has the original NES Metroid as an unlockable.  You can also get Metroid Fusion.  Try to find both of those cartridges used.  On the Wii you should be able to get Prime 3 for cheap.  The full trilogy on the Wii might be pricey from what I hear.  The full trilogy was also recently released on the Wii U as a digital download.  The Wii virtual console has Super Metroid as well for $8.  You might be able to play that with a gamecube controller plugged in, but I'm not 100% sure.  You may need a classic controller.  So with your current consoles, AFAIK you have access to all the essential games.  You're only missing Metroid 2 on the original gameboy.  You can also get Metroid Prime Hunters on the DS, but the single player isn't worth writing home about so you can skip it if you're on a budget.  There's Metroid Prime Pinball on the DS as well, but it's just a pinball game loosely based on the events of Prime 1 - no need to buy.  There's also Other M for the Wii, which is arguably the most polarizing game in the series among the fan base.  You wouldn't be missing much if you skipped that one too.  IMO absolute essentials would be Super Metroid and Zero Mission.  Fusion and the rest of the Prime Trilogy are also great if you have the funds for them.  If your budget is super tight, you could always go the emulator route for now for Super and the two GBA games on practically any computer.  Don't know if there's a Wii emulator, but there's a GC emulator for Prime 2, but to my knowledge you need a gaming computer to run that well."

Metroid,34l1wh,AndrewToth,4,Mon May 4 21:51:51 2015 UTC,"Wii is the ultimate Metroid console. It can play every single Metroid game either natively or via emulators (Metroid Prime Hunters is a bit shit on the Wii, but you can play it on your DS by buying the cartridge).  I'd recommend you start with Metroid: Zero Mission for GBA. It's a remake of the original Metroid, but is FAR better as the original is a little dated now. Zero Mission is the first game chronologically.  Then you can play Metroid II for Game Boy Original if you so desire. It's a decent game, I've been playing it recently, but it isn't quite as good as the others. You don't lose MUCH story if you skip it, but its well worth putting a few hours into. I'd recommend playing with an online Metroid II Map though, since the game doesn't include one and is incredibly easy to get lost in because lots of rooms look idential.  After Metroid II, I'd go for Super Metroid for the SNES. This is the first truly great Metroid game, and brings many of the awesome things we love about the series. It develops the story a little too.  After Super Metroid, go for Other M on the Wii. It takes place immediately after and is a new direction for the series. It is 3D but has many of the aspects that made the 2D games fun. It also has the most fleshed out story, with decent cut scenes and voice acting. The combat system is really damn fun and rewarding, if slightly easier than other Metroid games. Some people don't like Samus' character in this game, but I think its decent enough. You can get this on Amazon for 4 quid.  After Other M, play Metroid Fusion for GBA which is my all time favourite Metroid Game. It has a lot of story and some really awesome mechanics. Currently, it is the last game chronologically as well, and has some very cool plot twists.  Once you've completed the series in chronological order, you can go back to the Prime series. These take place between Metroid I and Metroid II, but they have their own storyline. The best way to play the trilogy is on the Wii game: Metroid Prime Trilogy. It is a single disc that removes the shitty gamecube controls from the first two games, and updates all three slightly. Only issue is that it costs an insane amount due to being a limited edition collectors item.  (I wouldn't bother with Prime Hunters, It's a pretty weak game with little/no resemblance to Metroid at all. Especially now the online multiplayer has been disables, its kinda a waste of time).  So, you CAN buy the original cartridges/disks, and their respective consoles/controllers etc, but this is very expensive indeed. Upwards of 200 quid! You can put homebrew (unofficial software) on your Wii, so that you can download the ROMs (files representing each game) from the internet, and play them with emulators on the Wii. You need a GBA/Game Boy emulator and a SNES one. For Prime Trilogy, there are ways of getting the Wii to play games from a USB stick which may or may not have been downloaded from the internet. You will need a cheap Gamecube controller to play the emulators with though: the wii remote sucks for these games.  http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_setup See here for how to homebrew your Wii. It's not a very difficult process. Feel free to PM me to ask any questions about it."

Metroid,34l1wh,theweirdbrosinc,2,Sat May 2 13:00:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, excluding the price of a gamecube controller, you should be able to play the whole series for free! I'd normally morally disagree with something like that, but unless you spend hundreds on a Wii U and 3DS and THEN buy the virtual copies of each game (and even then you won't be able to play them all), it isnt possible to give money to Nintendo for them anymore."
Metroid,34l1wh,theweirdbrosinc,1 point,Sat May 2 13:01:58 2015 UTC,That's a good point. I'll still consider buying them if they are fairly inexpensive though. I like having physical copies.

Metroid,34in1d,Weltall548,9,Fri May 1 13:57:45 2015 UTC,It I remember correctly it skips 99% and just goes straight to 100% or something similar.
Metroid,34in1d,Wombo194,5,Fri May 1 14:36:19 2015 UTC,"The Phazon Suit is one of the 100 items but it doesn't count for a %, so when you collect your last item at 98% it will jump straight to 100%.  The reason for this is: The percentage counter doesn't increment when you collect an item; rather the game determines it based on the contents of your inventory. /u/gnoani had a good example demonstrating that; if you collect all four power bomb expansions without getting the main PB upgrade, then the game will assume you only have the main PB upgrade and no expansions, and all four PBs together will count for 1%. Then when you get the main upgrade, it will jump up by 4%.  With that in mind, remember that Samus loses the Phazon Suit during the ending. That is not just done for the cutscene; the game actually removes the Phazon Suit from your inventory when that happens. So if the Phazon Suit were to count for a %, then the ending would always lower you to 99% completion and it would be impossible to get 100%."
Metroid,34in1d,Parax0,2,Fri May 1 18:36:02 2015 UTC,"Scans maybe? Those are included in the 100% completion goal, right?"

Metroid,34in1d,gnoani,2,Fri May 1 14:57:59 2015 UTC,"Your last item counts for 2%, and yes it's stupid. So when you'll be at 98% you'll have to get only 1 more item."
Metroid,34in1d,Satiie,2,Fri May 1 14:55:05 2015 UTC,"If you sequence break and get a power bomb expansion before main power bombs, picking up a third will cause you to ""lose"" percentage. Apparently the counter doesn't track what you've picked up at all- just what you have- and it assumes that if you have exactly 3 power bombs max, you have main PBs and no expansions.  In case anyone is wondering, the issue is purely cosmetic and doesn't block reaching 100%. The counter corrects itself once you actually get main PBs."

Metroid,34dxlk,sfam64,2,Thu Apr 30 15:08:16 2015 UTC,I have 7 E tanks and 170 missiles. Is that enough? I feel like I've explored every nook and cranny of the accessible areas.
Metroid,34dxlk,Parkmayn,2,Thu Apr 30 15:26:41 2015 UTC,"You mean the Chozo boss in Norfair, right? .I had the same problem. Just forget it for now, you will come back later, I had around 230 missiles, and around 10 e tanks. By the time I had returned, I had a new beam and a new suit, a new gadget (Dont want to spoil). Go somewhere else for now. I thought that I was supposed to kill this boss, as he was perfectly on my path, and I had acces to him. Trust me, you are not even close to beating that."
Metroid,34dxlk,KarjarA,1 point,Sat May 2 15:07:06 2015 UTC,"What beams did you have? You should have at least the Spazer + Wave + Ice + Charge. Someone told me it's possible to get the plasma before the Torizo, but I'm not sure.  Also be sure to use your morph ball like crazy in that fight. You should be in ball form 75% of the time, only exiting to attack."
Metroid,34dxlk,Blan21,1 point,Mon May 4 05:43:35 2015 UTC,"I fully agree with you on this. I've found the majority of fan games just make the game so ridiculously difficult that it misses all the charm and fun of the original. Difficulty can be fun when done properly, but difficulty for difficulty's sake is just silly.  I want a challenge, not the impossible."
Metroid,34dxlk,Viper_H,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:26:04 2015 UTC,You'd probably like Pazon hack or Legacy. They're pretty much equal to the difficulty of the original
Metroid,34dxlk,Gyper,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:20:08 2015 UTC,"From my experience, Phazon hack was much harder than Hyper."
Metroid,34dxlk,metroidman388,3,Fri May 1 18:14:15 2015 UTC,"I'd say that Hyper Metroid just ""holds your hand"" (for lack of a better phrase) a lot less than a normal 2d Metroid game. To me, it's more focused on the exploration aspect of Metroid since the game requires you to trek between zones much more frequently than in SM to be able to progress to a boss room. For me, it resulted in a higher collection % on my first HM playthrough compared to my first SM playthrough."
Metroid,34dxlk,sfam64,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:55:15 2015 UTC,"I don't see ""trekking through zones"" to be exploration, though. The beautty of SM was that there was so much stuff that could be left out and you coukd still beat the game. If I'm ""forced to explore"" to beat the next boss, its less enjoyable than beating the boss first an subsequently finding a weapon i could have used to make it easier (but that i didnt necessarily need).   EDIT: also, the ability to beat the game in more than one order. I like that too."
Metroid,34dxlk,ScrithWire,2,Thu Apr 30 15:58:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely feel the same way. I ended up finishing it only out of perseverance. The creator seemed to think ""bigger is better"" so he made the world huge which made backtracking take very long. I mean the escape sequence is 10 minutes long!"
Metroid,34dxlk,Wombo194,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:09:58 2015 UTC,But the espace sequence was damn awesome. I finished with 30 healthpoints and 5 seconds left. It was so intense I had a headache aferwards. Ouch
Metroid,34dxlk,KarjarA,7,Sat May 2 15:08:48 2015 UTC,the animation showed samus topless? O_o

Metroid,34dxlk,Viper_H,5,Thu Apr 30 15:27:39 2015 UTC,Doesnt she have a zero suit though?
Metroid,34dxlk,FlyingRep,4,Thu Apr 30 16:35:59 2015 UTC,Super Metroid (the base game) was created long before the Zero Suit concept was introduced.
Metroid,34dxlk,mecha_flake,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:50:30 2015 UTC,The justin bailey code was implemented before super metroid.
Metroid,34dxlk,FlyingRep,3,Thu Apr 30 18:16:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, Samus did indeed have clothes before Super Metroid. But the Zero Suit was created for Zero Mission."
Metroid,34dxlk,mecha_flake,6,Thu Apr 30 20:45:42 2015 UTC,"The creator of Hyper Metroid tends to lurk this subreddit.  Also on another note, I'd recommend not using ZSNES , it's pretty outdated by today's standards in accuracy. I'd  recommend using SNES9x or Higans instead."
Metroid,34dxlk,Gyper,0,Thu Apr 30 19:44:30 2015 UTC,"The problem with SNES9x is the errors that comes up with a Xbox controller. ZNES allows you to map your movement to both the Stick and the D pad. (which is awesome) and automatically does 8 directions.  SNES for me, can only do one or the other - and tends to bug out when trying to do 8 directions with the xbox controller.  Also SNES looks very ugly - its as if the default is running some weird graphic filters in an attempt to ENHANCE the game - but it just looks like some dumb iOS game. (all smudgy and cartoony) the best way is no filters, to maintain that calssic look.  I dont know maybe I just have it configured wrong. There was also tuns of sound glitches back in the day when SNES 9x first came out and I have no idea if it was fixed."
Metroid,34dxlk,Der_Scuple,9,Sat May 2 06:29:27 2015 UTC,Odd.  Usually Samus just loses her ability to use all of her powerups when she smashes into a ledge or wall.
Metroid,34dxlk,Troggles,3,Thu Apr 30 15:55:49 2015 UTC,"I found a glitch in the wrecked ship where if you jump off the moving grapple and attempt to grapple onto a side wall, you end up clipping trough the wall and having to reset the game."
Metroid,34dxlk,Parkmayn,3,Thu Apr 30 14:51:06 2015 UTC,Are you sure this isn't a bug with ZSNES itself? The emulator is notoriously inaccurate to normal SNES behavior. Try using SNES9X or Higan and see if the same error occurs.
Metroid,34dxlk,PresidentMagikarp,4,Thu Apr 30 20:21:40 2015 UTC,Legit thought this was a brilliant shitpost talking about Metroid Prime.
Metroid,34e608,PhazonZim,8,Thu Apr 30 12:32:24 2015 UTC,"A few thoughts: - The older Japanese ads in particular are really strange and delightful. - I forgot how great that original American Metroid Prime ad was. - It's quite telling that multiplayer is the only advertised feature of Metroid Prime: Hunters. - It's interesting (and sad) how, starting with Metroid: Zero Mission, Samus becomes far more sexualized than she was previously."
Metroid,34e608,SirMuddyhood,2,Thu Apr 30 14:43:47 2015 UTC,That Japanese Zero Mission one was disgusting
Metroid,34e608,leshpack,1 point,Sat May 2 12:53:18 2015 UTC,"The american Super Metroid commercial was terrible compared to the Japanese one, a trend which seems to persist throughout the video.

Metroid,34elm2,MonochromeTyrant,3,Thu Apr 30 15:44:33 2015 UTC,No.
Metroid,34elm2,Jammintk,3,Thu Apr 30 15:56:30 2015 UTC,Nintendo has previously stated that they don't want to release GBA games on the 3ds VC because it was too difficult to get the performance consistent enough.
Metroid,34elm2,leshpack,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:43:44 2015 UTC,"I dont understand why the 3DS doesn't have a GBA slot or at least a GBA CPU built in. Wouldn't take TOO much room and would open the 3DS to being able to play EVERY handheld Nintendo game ever released. Would be the perfect machine. Alas, here I am with a DS Lite and GBA."
Metroid,34elm2,Jammintk,1 point,Sat May 2 12:59:47 2015 UTC,"Nintendo obviously thought that GBA games would emulate okay on the hardware the 3ds was designed with. If they didn't, they would not have offered those GBA titles as Ambassador games. They likely ran into issues after they had already committed to releasing those ten games, so they had to do some game specific work to make them run well."
Metroid,34elm2,Jammintk,-4,Sat May 2 18:46:38 2015 UTC,Riiiight. What the really mean is they want to give more incentive to buy a Wii U so they can get higher sales. We all know a 3DS can handle GBA games perfectly fine.
Metroid,34elm2,ForneverStar,3,Thu Apr 30 21:51:45 2015 UTC,"It can handle the ten Ambassador games fine, officially, but those don't have any 3ds special features.

Metroid,34d9ro,BlueKyuubi63,7,Thu Apr 30 06:41:10 2015 UTC,"It's really something special. I like that it's not completely intuitive, so it takes the player a short period of time to understand what they've stumbled upon. It fundamentally changes how the player navigates the environment and opens up areas that were previously only accessible to skilled players. This means a less skilled player can then go back and collect missed items at the expense of time. But also the fact that you no longer have to stop to attack enemies makes backtracking super easy. Not to mention it makes you feel powerful without breaking the difficulty of the game.  It's the perfect end game item for a series designed the way Metroid is, yeah."
Metroid,34d9ro,PhazonZim,9,Thu Apr 30 10:32:22 2015 UTC,The SA-X suit from Metroid Fusion. It just makes you feel like such a badass having all your stuff back and getting to use it.
Metroid,34d9ro,Koog330,8,Thu Apr 30 10:49:04 2015 UTC,The morph ball. I waste so much damn time just rolling around.
Metroid,34d9ro,SpaceWarriorSamus-,4,Thu Apr 30 06:01:27 2015 UTC,"In the same vein, when you get the ability to hop while you're a ball, I'll roll and jump through entire rooms just for shits.  Fuck yeah morph ball."
Metroid,34d9ro,SometimesRhymes,6,Thu Apr 30 09:00:57 2015 UTC,"The Super Missile in Prime 1. Damn, it makes you feel so powerful suddenly. Also, at that point in the game, the missile cost is high, so it feels like a pretty big deal to use.  I wish more had been done with the other missile+beam combos. The Dark and Echo beam missile combos were especially cool."
Metroid,34d9ro,BadgerDentist,6,Thu Apr 30 06:27:03 2015 UTC,"By far, the plasma beam. Almost always one of the final things you get, and tears through everything. Can clear a room with a single shot, and it's just so satisfying to use."

Metroid,34d9ro,that_dude_you_know,6,Thu Apr 30 15:36:19 2015 UTC,"I honestly loved the Phazon upgrade to the Morph Ball in MP:3. Rolling around electrocuting everything in reach, then letting the phazon build back up and going in for another round was probably the most OP way to do things. Also it killed Metroids stupid easy, and I hate Metroids with a passion. Terrifying little fuckers"
Metroid,34d9ro,SercerferTheUntamed,5,Thu Apr 30 08:36:28 2015 UTC,Wall jump. I know it's not a suit upgrade but once you finally made your way out of that damn chute with the space jumping goat triplets you've been bestowed the skill that will take you almost anywhere.
Metroid,34d9ro,ScrithWire,1 point,Thu Apr 30 09:23:46 2015 UTC,"The wall jump is like a gift directly from the gods, bestowed to give you unlimited navigational potential. High jump is rendered moot, and so is space jump, and the grappling hook for the most part, too. It even makes the ice beam more of a ""helping hand,"" rather than a necessity. Also the mockball is fucking baller, too."
Metroid,34d9ro,shyPiano,4,Thu Apr 30 16:16:29 2015 UTC,"The visors from the Metroid Prime games are my favorites by far. The way they work, and how they help immersion by making you feel like you are literally inside the suit, just improve the gameplay 10 fold."
Metroid,34d9ro,Model_Omega,3,Thu Apr 30 12:42:13 2015 UTC,"I always got a kick out of the Thermal Visor from MP1.  That kind of stuff shows how much detail is put into the game, by actually carefully mapping and adapting the image to infrared patterns."

Metroid,34c8pr,PrimeSamus,3,Thu Apr 30 01:18:22 2015 UTC,Nope. The only settings I changed was turning off free aim for locking on.
Metroid,34c8pr,PrimeSamus,15,Thu Apr 30 01:19:54 2015 UTC,You NEED to try advanced controls.  I promise it will solve your problems.  Like literally all of them.
Metroid,34c8pr,ParadoxN0W,7,Thu Apr 30 01:25:35 2015 UTC,"Please listen to /u/primesamus... The Advanced controls are so, so, so much better dude. Seriously, it's like using a mouse and keyboard, very little movement required of your hands. I rest my remote hand on my knee and play for hours at a time. I have no idea why that setting is not the default, because it should be."
Metroid,34c8pr,MetroidAndZeldaFan,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:39:19 2015 UTC,I played on default and felt fine. What's different for advanced?
Metroid,34c8pr,ParadoxN0W,2,Thu Apr 30 17:24:33 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, you can enjoy the game just fine with the default control settings. In fact, it may be a more faithful experience of the original GameCube feel as far as navigation is concerned (with the added benefit of moving free-aim). My perception is that the advanced control scheme ramps up the cadence of the game so that movement is much more smooth, directed, and rapid. I feel so much more agile (like Samus!) when I don't have to move my reticle all the way to the edge of the screen before my field of view begins to pan. With the advanced controls, your aiming neutral zone box is way, way smaller such that any slight movement not only adjusts your cannon's reticle but also your screen will track accordingly. I think it makes the game a more brisk and deliberate experience, with more accurate aiming in combat too."
Metroid,34c8pr,MonochromeTyrant,3,Fri May 1 01:32:10 2015 UTC,"Play with the control settings until they're comfortable for you. Also, are you sitting with your hands in your lap? It's possible to play the game doing so, and it makes it a much more comfortable experience.  Edit: I don't know if it's hyperbole or not, but don't ""jerk"" just to shift the view. It's completely unnecessary to do so."
Metroid,34c8pr,MonochromeTyrant,2,Thu Apr 30 00:38:49 2015 UTC,"I'm sitting with my hands above my lap. I'll try playing with my hands in my lap. And I was probably over exaggerating when I said ""jerk"". I do have to move my hand quite a bit to shift the view, though."
Metroid,34c8pr,hairam,2,Thu Apr 30 00:44:44 2015 UTC,"It's honestly how I recommend playing the game. Some people even suggest placing a pillow in your lap and resting your arms on it. As for the view adjustment, unless it's the settings, it should be a simple shift of the wrist."
Metroid,34c8pr,Weltall548,3,Thu Apr 30 00:47:32 2015 UTC,"As others have said, change your control senitivity settings and/or check your sensor bar settings.  Every time I've played corruption or the trilogy, I barely have to move my wrist. Unless I'm doing the grapple beam, at which point I have to hurl the nunchuck arm back and forth to get it to do what I want it to do. Maybe I just haven't gotten the hang of it yet/need to try barely moving the nunchuck...  At the end of the day, I really enjoy the wiimote/nunchuck mechanic for the prime trilogy, especially since you can move samus' head and body individually (and because I love the point and shoot mechanic - adds some more difficulty to the equation and is a good use of the wiimote/wii system)."
Metroid,34c8pr,metroidman388,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:44:45 2015 UTC,Use advanced controls. You only need to move your hand a little with them
Metroid,34c8pr,scg06,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:16:52 2015 UTC,It's murder on the wrists - especially when you have to rapid fire when lock on free aim is enabled.  Easily the reason why I've played corruption substantially less than the other two.
Metroid,34c8pr,Wombo194,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:22:45 2015 UTC,Is it possible to play with the wii u pad or a classic pad? I really can't stand the nunchuck/wiimote combo but I really want to play corruption. I found it quite uncomfortable to use the wiimote like you and I really prefer a pad.
Metroid,349q6t,TheBackspace125,27,Wed Apr 29 12:38:03 2015 UTC,"Every year I hope they announce a new one and I feel let down, but I think there's an important difference to be noted with Metroid and Zelda.  The Legend of Zelda for the NES is extremely iconic. It is the single most iconic game in a series of already very iconic games. Its specific existence is celebrated and marked by Nintendo. Metroid isn't like that, because the most iconic games in the series are Super Metroid and Metroid Prime. Nestroid is noted and celebrated, but not nearly on the scale of Super Metroid.  In that regard, I don't think they'll make a big thing out of the anniversary of Metroid's release. They didn't change the world with the release of Metroid the way they did the Legend of Zelda, but they did change the world of video games with Super Metroid."
Metroid,349q6t,PhazonZim,15,Wed Apr 29 12:56:37 2015 UTC,Anniversary celebrations are usually for the whole series. All of the Mario 25th and Zelda 25th specials werent specific to the NES games.
Metroid,349q6t,MastuDenton,25,Wed Apr 29 14:28:48 2015 UTC,Can we take a moment to remember that Nintendo completely ignored Metroid's 25th anniversary.  What makes us think that they will address the 30th?
Metroid,349q6t,Master_of_Rivendell,11,Wed Apr 29 15:31:13 2015 UTC,a new game they want to advertise. if there is a new release they want to promote then you can bet they will suddenly remember Metroids anniversary
Metroid,349q6t,MastuDenton,0,Wed Apr 29 16:31:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly, Nintendo had had Zelda Skyward Sword to promote at the time. I'm fairly confident we'll see something Metroid related someday."
Metroid,349q6t,MetroidAndZeldaFan,6,Thu Apr 30 17:28:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, but they still use a specific game as a springboard. Hyrule Historia has a special link to Skyward Sword for example, both are part of a grander celebration of Zelda."
Metroid,349q6t,PhazonZim,0,Wed Apr 29 15:31:25 2015 UTC,this sentence makes no sense. i have no idea what youre even trying to convey.
Metroid,349q6t,MastuDenton,3,Wed Apr 29 16:31:55 2015 UTC,Edited for clarity
Metroid,349q6t,PhazonZim,-3,Wed Apr 29 17:17:51 2015 UTC,it still doesnt make sense. How do Hyrule Historia or Skyward Sword have anything to do with Zelda's 25th being based on the release of the famicom game and acting as a celebration of all of the games.
Metroid,349q6t,MastuDenton,3,Wed Apr 29 19:07:18 2015 UTC,"Because they are? Skyward sword tied the whole franchise together and gave it a storyline, they celebrated the whole series with a storyline affirming book and game and used skyward swords release as a backboard for the whole 25th anniversary celebrations"
Metroid,349q6t,Mr_Pennybags,-4,Wed Apr 29 23:21:03 2015 UTC,Skyward Sword did none of those things.
Metroid,349q6t,MastuDenton,5,Wed Apr 29 23:31:26 2015 UTC,"It definitely did. It gave an origin for hyrule, link, ganondorf and zelda, set up the fact that they will always be in this struggle because of Demise, and the book then lays out every game in story order and explains the split timeline."
Metroid,349q6t,Mr_Pennybags,-2,Wed Apr 29 23:42:24 2015 UTC,"It gave an origin for hyrule, link, ganondorf and zelda   you mean rewrote.   set up the fact that they will always be in this struggle because of Demise   information that wanst needed and doesnt affect anything in a positive way.   then lays out every game in story order and explains the split timeline   by inventing a bullshit 3rd split in order to do it."
Metroid,349q6t,MastuDenton,2,Thu Apr 30 00:43:17 2015 UTC,"They won't just say ""this is the year of Metroid"", they'll pick a specific game and go from there. They did it with Zelda and they did it with Luigi. They've shown they don't really care about the anniversary of Metroid though. Hyrule Historia is just another example, because instead of being linked to the first Legend of Zelda is was linked to the release of Skyward Sword."
Metroid,349q6t,PhazonZim,-1,Wed Apr 29 23:16:45 2015 UTC,Zelda and Mario Anniversaries were 25 year celebrations of the series. Skyward Sword happened to be conveniently be released in the same year but it was not the reason for the celebration. Year of Luigi is not even a relevant comparison
Metroid,349q6t,MastuDenton,2,Wed Apr 29 23:30:00 2015 UTC,"Why not? It celebrated the 30th anniversary of Luigi's debut in Mario Bros and two or three Luigi games coming out the same year. I'm not even talking about just anniversaries. Sprites from the original Mario and Zelda are often reused in newer games and promotional materials. How often do you see sprites from Metroid, Zelda 2 or Mario Bros 2? Almost never."
Metroid,349q6t,PhazonZim,2,Wed Apr 29 23:41:15 2015 UTC,"I actually have to disagree with you there. Yes, The Legend of Zelda is clearly the more established series, but let's not forget what a feat the original Metroid is. A non-linear platformer with a huge emphasis on exploration and an entire world to explore (literally) instead of a traditional level by level design. Not to mention the twist ending (which was a bigger deal than it would be today). Nobody else was doing that. They changed a lot about how video games are approached, the same way they did with Mario and Zelda, I think Nintendo has done a lot to recognize just how much of an accomplishment that is. To date, I think it's a safe assumption that after Mario and Zelda, Metroid is still Nintendo's most valuable IP.  I'd be disappointed if they didn't make a big deal about its 30th anniversary.    Of course, I say almost 90% of this out of pure well wishing, Nintendo could competently fuck with us like they have been for like 5 years with this franchise, and it's a shame. The timing is just right though, and I think if there isn't a new game by 2016, well, I guess Nintendo just doesn't care much for Metroid anymore."

Unfortunately this isn't really well communicated, but if properly equipped he's not very difficult. I got destroyed at first,  but after returning with the gravity suit I beat him first try. So make sure you have that; if you still can't beat him, try again and collect more energy tanks before facing him. Remember Ridley is next, and he's significantly stronger."

Metroid,34630d,thedopefish,3,Wed Apr 29 00:50:59 2015 UTC,"Saving allows you to stitch together pieces of multiple runs. You optimize and optimize the first half of it until you get it perfect, saving it. Then you optimize and optimize the second half of it until you get it perfect, meaning that your total time is (the best you've ever done on the first half) + (the best you've ever done on the second half).  Doing it as a single session keeps you honest, so you have to actually achieve that time as part of a single contiguous run."
Metroid,34630d,Shadax,3,Wed Apr 29 01:00:58 2015 UTC,"There is a ""segmented"" record and a single playthrough record.  Segmented means they did it in sections.  So you save, then do the next section, if you mess up, you don't have to start over, you just start from the last save.  I by no means am very good.  I can boost ball and wall jump allowing for some sequence breaking.  Watch a record holder, they do this boost where they get hurt and it launches them across the screen.  They know what rooms to speed boost through.  Its pretty amazing."

The Game Grumps make enough to support at least 5 people. People see this and want to try it as well.   So they start with the games they love like Super Metroid or insert other game here. Then they think hey I'll post this to /r/metroid they'll want to see this. Plus it'll get me more views. But unless it's a really well done play though and the person doing it is charismatic or funny. Then most likely it'll just get down voted. But people still want to keep trying so they keep posting.   Now mind you what I'm saying might not apply to all people. Some may genuinely want to do it out of a labour of love and to celebrate one of their favorite games. But I'm sure a lot of lets players are just people jumping on the bandwagon and trying to make money before this thing dies off. At least that's my opinion.   That said, while I know Super Metroid very well. It's still fun to watch a bad ass speed run. Especially if it's a reverse boss order speed run those are impressive as hell to watch.

Metroid,3476n2,Weltall548,11,Tue Apr 28 21:06:14 2015 UTC,"Hypermode comes at virtually no cost because there's no ammo requirements and health refills are practically everywhere. You also get invulnerability the entire time. My biggest issue with it personally is that it drastically reduces your combat options because it's significantly more powerful than all your other weapons and the game is designed around you using it, which means you're forced to use Hypermode against basically everything. Basically, to my eyes, the situation isn't that hypermode is a strong addition to your arsenal; it's the only decent weapon in an arsenal that otherwise kinda sucks.  The charge combos don't have any of these issues. They come pretty late in the game, they fire very slowly, they have heavy ammo requirements, and you aren't forced to use them in combat encounters because the rest of your arsenal can handle most enemies in the game too."
Metroid,3476n2,Parax0,5,Tue Apr 28 22:10:03 2015 UTC,"I would say in addition to thus, that the Charge Combos are more circumstantial. The Flamethrower and Wave Buster are good at very close ranges, while the Ice Spreader and Super Missile are better long-range.  The Sonic Boom and Super Missile in Echoes are good for single targets, but the Black Hole and Sunburst work better against several targets at once."
Metroid,3476n2,Jammintk,2,Wed Apr 29 01:04:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I only ever used the Darkburst on Chykka and the Wavebuster on the Invisible Drone. Flamethrower and Sunburst got almost no use that I can remember."

Metroid,3476n2,Nararthok,5,Thu Apr 30 07:44:52 2015 UTC,"Super missiles have significant spool-up time, some enemies are immune to them, and a bunch of enemies can dodge them. Flamethrower, Wavebuster, Dark/Lightburst and Sonic Boom are annoyingly expensive.  Hypermode pierces almost all immunities, NOTHING is dodging your charge beam shots, Hypermissiles one-shot bunches of enemies instantly, and the mode is almost free.  And that's before getting into the invulnerability. Some of the most tense moments in the game are utterly trivialized by Hypermode, even in the highest difficulty. The bomb gauntlet at Skytown goes from ""frantic"" to ""boring"" by holding down +. I'm aware that it's optional, but it shouldn't be as powerful as they made it."
Metroid,3476n2,gnoani,3,Wed Apr 29 18:42:55 2015 UTC,"It's not just the strength, but how many perks you get out of it.  For the cost of 1 energy tank (less if you manually disable it early), you get greatly increased firepower AND invincibility.  On my playthroughs I try to use it as sparingly as possible, but on the hardest difficulty enemies love to go into hypermode practically forcing you to do the same to kill them effectively.  I'm personally not a fan of the invincibility.  If you know what you're doing it allows you to win fights easily that would have been a nightmare in the other games.  Granted the game is theoretically balanced around your ability to go hypermode, but IMO it could have been handled a bit better."

Metroid,3476n2,hunter324,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:29:22 2015 UTC,"Mainly because Hypermode allows you to become invulnerable for 10 seconds (as long as you cancel it before you get corrupted) without using any energy, and that's before even factoring its power. This alone can be abused against a good chunk of the bosses to avoid major damage, which the Beam Combos can't do. Also, the ""ammo"" for Hypermode goes up quite a bit with energy drops being everywhere as long as you're below maximum capacity."
Metroid,3476n2,ShadowMario3,0,Mon May 4 15:40:40 2015 UTC,"I see comments saying that it's overpowered but it's optional. the same argument goes for e-tanks, one being the cost of using HP, if you choose to do low percentage runs and avoid collecting e-tanks than the challenge becomes much greater. it becomes more high risk high reward."
Metroid,3476n2,ephellCL,1 point,Fri May 1 07:12:42 2015 UTC,"Hypermode is most definitely not optional. There are a lot of enemies that aren't vulnerable to anything else (especially bosses) and there are a lot of enemies that are extremely resistant to basically all of your weapons other than Hypermode (any Space Pirate that goes into its own Hypermode), and of course obstacles in the environment that require you to use Hypermode to pass. It's integral to the core of the game."
Metroid,342j9k,Amannen1337,7,Mon Apr 27 20:17:14 2015 UTC,I've never understood what those chained up moon things are supposed to be. You can't even scan them.

Maybe the chained up moons are a way of keeping the tides in order?  edit I just looked it up now and there seems to be an answer for it. On this wiki, it says that the moon things were originally space ships made by the reptilicus. I guess that makes sense."

Because the 30th anniversery is 2016, Retro will most likely release the game then. That's why they hired so many people to work for them. There going all out on this one. As for E3, because Zelda Wii U isn't being shown, there's a very big gap to fill. We all know that there is only one game that's just as massive as Zelda.

And I'd love to see Metroid Prime 4 on Wii U, and/or a 3DS port of the Metroid Prime Trilogy.  I also think it'd be cool if Nintendo made a Metroid Prime Hunters 2 for both Wii U and 3DS with the ability to do multiplayer with one person on the Wii U and one on 3DS."
Metroid,344ijd,AuraRyu,3,Tue Apr 28 06:15:07 2015 UTC,The fanbase of Hunters is quite small in comparison to Metroid itself so I don't think Hunters 2 is gonna happen.

Metroid,344ijd,BSent,1 point,Tue Apr 28 11:10:32 2015 UTC,"I think they are going to wait a bit longer before a new game. Recall there was an 8 year difference between Super and Prime 1. Meroid is in a tricky spot right now. From a story perspective, they are kind of in a corner since Fusion. The reputation is tarnished because of Other M. The Japanese developers supposedly aren't a fan of the Prime games too, and metroid in Japan isn't as highly revered as it is in NA. With all these issues, I can see how Nintendo isn't too focused with putting out another Metroid game.  I think it will be longer before they make a new game. I think we'll definitely see something by 2020, but they probably won't announce until 2016 or 2017. Us hardcore fans will always be clamoring for new games, but as more time passes more of the general gamer crowd will be wanting a new game."

Metroid,344ijd,PunyParker826,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:56:10 2015 UTC,"2017 at the earliest in my opinion.  The last we heard was they were in the planning stages last year at E3 for 2D and 3D games.  We know Miyamoto and Tanabe are involved and Sakamoto isn't based on various interviews over the past year.  That's really all we know.  No developer, no timetable, no knowing of what's coming first, nothing about story/characterization/timeline/etc.  A lot of people would like to hope Retro's involved, but Retro can't make Metroid forever without an expansion of sorts which by all accounts hasn't/isn't happening.  I think Metroid would be an interesting challenge for Next Level Games myself, BUT it'd definitely be the most unique and biggest undertaking for that studio.  Since they recently became a 2nd Party Developer for Nintendo, I imagine it could be their next big project since they apparently had a Metroid game shelved for Luigi's Mansion 2.  But since so many questions are still up in the air over the series, I don't know if a return is a good idea at this juncture.  These questions, ultimately have to be answered before Nintendo goes into production of Metroid again or else the series will suffer/die because of it."
Metroid,344ijd,notrichardlinklater,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:11:26 2015 UTC,"I think they're going to make an announcement as early as this year; a release date after that is up in the air, though. There's been too many little hints dropped for there not to be something going on. We already know Retro is working on a project, we just don't know what. A little while ago, they made an official Twitter page, with a single tweet - ""Peekaboo"", and followed a bunch of Metroid databases. A week after that, The Prime Trilogy sale went live on Wii U. Going along with that, Nintendo has been quietly mentioning Metroid again in their promotions, alongside current franchises (""3DS - your center for all the best Metroid, Zelda, and Mario titles"") It could all just be cirumstancial, and would certainly seem so, viewed separately, but put together, I think something's up."

Metroid,33xigu,meepketo,3,Mon Apr 27 23:30:58 2015 UTC,"I just finished the game. Time: 7hrs 32mins Items: 83% I figured I'd give my 2 cents in this thread.  I'm damn impressed with this hack, especially compared to the other SM hacks I've tried.  What I really enjoyed:   The exploration. It was fantastic, even better than the original, to be honest. The order of items. Like the wave beam before the spazer and the grapple beam way before the space jump (unlike the original, which made the grapple obsolete in an hour or so of game time). The new mechanics. The long backwards jump is fun and the spring ball allowing sprinting in morph ball is really interesting. The environments. Open rooms with multiple doors and interesting colors.   What I did not enjoy:   Allowing players to get to bosses they were not prepared for. The gold chozo and Ridley were this way. I thought I was just not good enough, but it turned out in both cases that I missed a weapon upgrade. The bosses took way too much damage before going down. The boss fights ended up being a matter of patience rather than skill. The ridiculously long escape sequence. Like OP said. 10 minutes, really? It took me from Torian into Norfair into Brinstar into Crateria. That's just downright silly. The arbitrarily locked grey doors. This is my biggest gripe by far. These grey doors had no way to show how to open them. From what I could tell, some of the time they opened when I killed all the enemies in the room, some of the time they opened only when I was on the other side, and some of the time they opened when I killed a boss. Very unintuitive and unnecessarily confusing."

Metroid,33xigu,meepketo,2,Tue Apr 28 02:29:09 2015 UTC,"So I'm about 4 hours in, but I haven't gotten very far.  I have 3 energy tanks, 60 missiles, (no super missiles), morph ball/bomb, grapple, charge beam, wave beam, high jump, and x-ray.  I'm lost.  I feel like I've tracked and backtracked every which way, and used the damn x-ray everywhere for hidden passages.  Super missile doors everywhere of course, and one item I cannot figure out how to jump to (very tall room, with breakable blocks across the entire floor).  Please tell me this isn't where I get super missiles...  or how the hell do I get to it? Is this just a wall jump puzzle or something else?    Overall this is the best super metroid mod I've seen.  The story is lacking and so is the guidance.  I feel like I should have seen some bosses by now--I have a lot of items and its just been a lot of wandering and exploring.  Don't get me wrong, that's great, but its starting to feel a bit too much like an empty open world without any big adversaries outside of blocked paths.  The gate system is neat but rarely do I find myself actually encountering a blocked gate and then coming back after I figured out how to open it.    I like that Metroid games give you a bit of that back and forth, and getting a new perspective on old areas with your new abilities, but this one looks like its shaping up to be mainly about that--constantly backtracking.  It doesn't quite have that same progressive feel as the original, because there isn't a feeling of completing zones or areas.  You're not coming back because you remembered an item you couldn't reach, you're bouncing from zone to zone just looking for the next door you can reach or open. It can be a bit much."

All I know of Norfair so far is there's two spots that I start taking damage from heat and turned around, a path down into the lava which i didn't take, and a locked grey door I can reach with my high jump boots but not open.  Not sure if there's another entrance into the zone I should be using at this point."

Metroid,33xigu,Wombo194,1 point,Wed Apr 29 07:50:54 2015 UTC,"hehe... Brainstar. That's some Ball-der-dash :D  Puns aside, great review!  I'm currently doing a live review / stream of Hyper Metroid to let others see what it's about.   I too was really impressed with the wrecked ship reverse order of the power going off (which makes total sense). However, what I don't understand is that when the power is off, all the sudden broken wires are arcing electricity like it's the 4th of July. Where's the continuity? Eh, it's small potatos anyways.  Also, I would like to share a tip / my experience about the first Torizo you fight when first getting the bombs. See, I had a similar experience to you. I blasted all of my missiles to empty and the Torizo was stuck on one side of the spikes going back and forth endlessly. The Torizo wouldn't throw the balls for more ammo so I tried something new that I wouldn't normally do: Bombs. That's right. I used my new acquired ability on the boss and it worked like a charm. The bombs take out the Torizo in one or two hits, so long as you place them near his chest. Personally, I was amazed by this revelation in boss fighting. To me it said, ""hey, in this game bombs are more powerful and much more useful against enemies."" I also enjoyed how the fight was setup that I could not receive any more ammo so I was forced to think outside of the box. Whether this was or was not intentional, I cannot say, but it sure does feel that way."
Metroid,33xigu,Gyper,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:19:00 2015 UTC,Interesting. I didn't think of using bombs nor did I need to. I just sort of jumped over his head when he runs toward you and it makes him hop back and throw more spheres. Maybe it could make the Golden Torizo fight easier. I shall experiment. And would love to see you stream! <3
Metroid,33xigu,Gyper,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:26:16 2015 UTC,"Hey, whatever works, works. I'm more so amazed that you were able to get the Torizo to throw spheres in the first place.

Like the name implies, it is meant to be a base game for hackers to use as an alternate to using plain old regular super metroid.  Hyper Metroid is just one of the first hacks to use Project Base instead of Vanilla physics and there is a few more hacks  in development using project Base as its core.    But if you like vanilla  Super Metroid physics and movement, there are quite a lot of great hacks available."

Metroid,33x87f,Elusive2000,2,Tue Apr 28 22:52:30 2015 UTC,"The only reason Trilogy is ""easier"" than their GC counterparts is due to the addition of the pointing mechanism and the Spring Ball, which made bosses like Boost Guardian and Spider Guardian easier. They still dealt the same damage to you as long as the difficulty was the same (GC Normal = Trilogy Veteran, GC Hard = Trilogy Hypermode).  At 100%, I found Emperor Ing much easier than Dark Samus/AU 313. Once you know how to use Power Bombs effectively, the Body and Chrysalis forms become a cakewalk. My problems with Dark Samus/AU 313 were due to the sheer amount of damage they do if they hit you (mainly AU 313)."

Metroid,33wzyk,SpaceWarriorSamus-,6,Sun Apr 26 13:05:27 2015 UTC,"(Possible Light Spoilers)  From the Metroid Wiki:    While active, the Power Suit bonds with Samus biologically, and cannot be taken off without her cooperation. It has been observed on many occasions that the methods which Samus uses to remove the Power Suit is to have it dematerialize with a bright flash. When the suit is inactive, Samus is able to retain the upgrades within herself until it becomes active again (observed in the events of Metroid: Zero Mission.) But it has also been observed that she can have it materialize at will, (seen several times taking place in the origins manga, once at the beginning of Metroid Prime 3: Corruption and at the start of Metroid: Other M) suggesting that this suit is not meant to be dismantled to be removed like regular armor, and that it is somehow put on or taken off by using an energy-to-matter reaction (it also has been shown that at least the helmet can be removed manually, as Samus demonstrates this in some of the special endings in the series). When this is not possible to do, the Galactic Federation has been able to modify it while she is unconscious. In the first instance of this, they added PED functionality to take advantage of a Phazon infection in her bloodstream. Later, the weaker Fusion Suit is built on the remains of Samus's Power Suit after large portions were surgically removed due to X Parasite infestation.   So it looks like it is biologically bonded to her, hence the genetic material, and she uses willpower or focus or something like that to make it materialize around her."
Metroid,33wzyk,GhostlyPixel,3,Mon Apr 27 03:59:38 2015 UTC,Where is it said that it stole samus' DNA? I didn't think dark samus had any relation to Samus other than the suit?

Metroid,33vstg,twinfyre,3,Sun Apr 26 03:22:21 2015 UTC,"It is in a way, a part of human nature. Phaaze is basically a creature focused on the goal of reproducing. That's humanity at its most basic level. reproduction. The Metroid Prime series is almost a cosmic horror story. Humanity being wiped out by something that is almost incapable of even acknowledging their existence. Like man stepping on an ant on his way to work.   The one thing that separates the Prime games from a true ""cosmic horror story"" is Samus. The one person who can destroy Phaaze. Got a planet that is going to wipe out the human race? Send in a human who has destroyed countless planets before. Samus is the only person who can stand against a tidal wave, and win.   And now that we have a symbol of humanity personified, why not have an exact mirror to that? That's where Dark Samus comes in. She is Samus' equal. She also gives a face to the unstoppable force that is Phaaze. Instead of fighting against nature itself, we're fighting against a visible entity who is pulling the strings.   Here's the real beauty of it though, How does Samus triumph over Dark Samus? She becomes more like her. Corruption is all about Samus slowly becoming the very thing she is fighting. In the most literal way possible. It's ""he who fights monsters"" at its finest.   But now I'm just rambling about literary stuff. Basically, in any form of fiction, we will always project a part of ourselves. and that part of ourselves will reflect the way we think and act."
Metroid,33vstg,twinfyre,1 point,Sun Apr 26 03:38:53 2015 UTC,I find it interesting you mark Samus' corruption as beautiful. It felt to me as if they were trying to make that part of the horror rather than something beautiful.

I'm typically thorough enough to find what's necessary and backtrack.  In the case of Zero Mission (and the other games, for that matter), I made the assumption that the game simply wouldn't present the opportunity to use power bombs without naturally guiding you to the actual power up to begin with. It's like how you can find super missiles before the battle with the Imago with some sequence breaking, but the game leads you to the Imago and your first super missile through normal progression."

Metroid,33rmdr,LightDragonman1,3,Sat Apr 25 17:31:52 2015 UTC,"You know, whenever someone attempts to make anything remotely positive regarding their thoughts on Other M, everyone responds with tons of links to videos and essays explaining why the game is an irredeemable piece of crap.  Personally, while I don't think it's an awful game, it is certainly quite disappointing, and I can only imagine how good it could have been. Sakamoto tried to do something different, and I give him points for that, but he just failed to execute."

Metroid,33rmdr,Greviator,3,Sat Apr 25 08:34:20 2015 UTC,"The writing was garbage and the lack of exploration was insulting. I dislike the control scheme, but I have heard good arguments in its favor.  That being said, I look back on the game fondly. I thoroughly enjoyed it as an action oriented metroid game that mixed 2d and 3d elements decently well. Had they opened up the game more and allowed the player to explore, the gameplay would have been just that much better.  The writing and story (for good reason) needs a major overhaul. Samus needs rewritten, and Adam needed more screentime (maybe utilize the comm's and have him converse with Samus somewhat frequently.) as well as make the Space Marine's a bit more memorable. Also, cut out that ""deleter"" bullshit and make the conspiracy make sense. That being said, I do enjoy how it lines up with Fusion, as it is supposed to. Really, like the Star Wars prequels, it needed a second and third draft to be ready.  Overall, a messed shot and I wouldn't mind an Other M 2 that could improve on the original."

Metroid,33rmdr,Tagrineth,2,Sat Apr 25 01:46:38 2015 UTC,"The Metroid Queen was the climax, the fact that there was a shitty ""find the pixel"" scene shoehorned in after it ruined the last act badly. That whole thing should've just been a cutscene, no control.  Also, while the game had a lot of decent-to-good ideas, I can't personally reconcile the lack of a timing window for Sense-move. The fact that mashing the d-pad effectively makes Samus invulnerable and is the optimal way to fight and dodge everything ruined the combat hardcore."

Especially in metroid - a game about solitude and fighting gross monsters - I would gladly take Samus' awful voice acting over the federation plot any day.  Every time I seen one of those generic space marines I died a bit inside as a metroid fan."

The near brain dead button-mash playstyle, ""I don't have permission to explode everything in sight yet"", required pixel-perfect scanning for something I had no idea what I was looking for in order to progress, etc. The overall gameplay wasn't that exciting compared to previous games.  I didn't mind the overall idea of the game, but I feel like it was done poorly. The narration especially broke off from the ""silent hero"" aspect of previous games.

Metroid,33r2z8,TSMFailSpin2015,9,Fri Apr 24 20:36:39 2015 UTC,A remaster of a mediocre title? No. I'd rather have something new if they are going to release something.
Metroid,33r2z8,Mortimer42,2,Fri Apr 24 20:38:56 2015 UTC,I agree. The only thing I can see being worth the time and effort would be the multiplayer mode itself.
Metroid,33r2z8,MonochromeTyrant,0,Fri Apr 24 21:47:34 2015 UTC,"Given Nintendo's recent flirtation with free to play games on 3ds, i would love to see a F2P Metroid Prime Hunters/Prime Echoes multiplayer game released for eShop. Offer extra character skins based on the various Suit upgrades and other hunters in the main games as paid content and you have a winner in my book"
Metroid,33r2z8,Jammintk,4,Fri Apr 24 23:07:22 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind a sequel.  The multiplayer was a lot of fun, but I'd like them to spend more time fleshing out the single player or cut that part out altogether."
Metroid,33r2z8,metroidman388,2,Sat Apr 25 00:35:03 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, no. It's only redeeming factor was its multiplayer mode, which was pretty kickass back in the day. But the single player was pretty bad in my opinion. It felt so bland, it felt unfinished, and it tried too hard to be a Metroid Prime game. Get from point A to point B, beat a boss that repeats itself four times in the game, run back to point A with a destruction sequence that for some reason doesn't actual destroy anything, go to another area and repeat. I know I'm being critical, it's only because Metroid is my favourite game series,but honestly the single player needed some major fine tuning and extra care put into it. And while a remaster could fix its problems, I don't think its worth putting so many resources into the game when Nintendo could allocate that time into making a new Metroid game."
Metroid,33r2z8,Adz164,2,Sat Apr 25 03:47:50 2015 UTC,"I've been waiting for a new Metroid game with multiplayer as good as that for forever. At this point I don't care if it's handheld or not (3DS does need at least one Metroid though).  The only thing though is that they shouldn't skimp on the single player. That was probably the main weakness of Hunters, as much as I loved it. It's single player was rather weak compared to the other games.  I will say one thing, no other Metroid game has made me feel really alone like Hunters did. Idk why, maybe it was the music, or that it was in another galaxy, but it definitely felt a lot more isolated than the other games to me.  TL;DR I wouldn't mind a remastered version, but I'd rather have a new game that has as good of a multiplayer, but also a much better single player (hopefully they bring back the hunters too)"
Metroid,33r2z8,SarcasticRidley,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:52:08 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer a newer Metroid Prime Hunters on the Wii U, honestly. Hunters was a great game, but the controls required good L&R buttons. I wore mine out with my old ds, and I'd probably do the same with my 3ds if it came to that.   Metroid Prime Hunters is a bit niche too. It's hard to find another person to play against who has a 3ds, an interest in Metroid, and an interest in Metroid multiplayer.   Also, MPH was just fine on its own. The graphics were decent enough for you to tell what was going on, and the multiplayer was solid.  So basically, Metroid Prime Hunters would be much better on a home console, Maybe with double the characters and stages. I wouldn't mind playing as Rundas in a game."

Metroid,33myp2,Weltall548,6,Thu Apr 23 20:53:45 2015 UTC,"Sanctuary Fortress - By far my favorite area of any game ever. The enemies are all interesting, the power-ups are epic, the puzzles are fun, and the music is exceptional. Phazon mines - I actually often forget this level exists, because through my first Prime playthrough, I didn't know about it for so long. As a result, I always enter this area like it's the first time. I always love fighting the Elite Pirates, and the invisible drone, and the beam-specific pirates. And the Omega Pirate fight is so freaking cool. Phendrana Drifts - Here, the thing that makes the area is the awesome music. It instill this sense of awe and wonder, and it feels like you're really exploring a marvelous, hostile, organic world. Phaaze - The feeling of rushing through an area, fully powered, nothing to gain by waiting, blasting your way through alien hordes, knowing that what came at the end was the boss fight of the entire trilogy... Wow. Need I say more? (Yes - that fight was such a letdown. I wish it was more like fighting SA-X, where it's you vs. other you on equal footing.) Pirate Homeworld - Most of this place is just kinda ""meh"", but it has quite a few very rewarding sequences. The Hazard Suit upgrade is nice, the X-Ray visor is actually very, very useful, Gandrayda is awesome, and the demolition trooper rush is just fun. GFS Valhalla - Cool and creepy and all its annoyances make me love it more. Exploring it was rewarding and fun, and I often forget it's required. Elysia - Majestic islands flying through the sky. Breathtaking. Just... Wow. That's about it, though, and since that awe wears off eventually and I've always spent a lot of time there, that isn't all I can say. The area where you get the Seeker Missiles is SOOOOOO COOL. The ship grapple is used pretty well here, and I like it. Magmoor caverns - Again, the music makes this section. The Plasma beam puzzle is really cool and rewarding, and it's just pretty cool. Nothing fantastic, but still fun, especially with the music on. Torvus Bog - As much hate as this place gets, I liked it quite a bit my first time around, and that love has remained. I like the green and blue color palette, and the lower area's music, but that's about it. Tallon Overworld - Same as Torvus, pretty much. I love the rain and the organic feel to it, and the green color palette. Beyond that, though, I feel like it's basically just a way to get between places. Impact Crater - Pretty much just the final bosses' dungeon and nothing else, but I'm okay with that. Chozo Ruins - While the brown and red color scheme turns me off, this place has quite a few memorable locations, like the huge half-pipe rooms, and the lava room, and the furnace, and the room where you fight Flaaghra (?). Temple Grounds - Much like Tallon Overworld, I feel like this is just a way to get from place to place. Its areas tend to blend in with one another, and I feel like it's pretty much forgettable. Agon Wastes - This area just feels totally dead. It just feels like it's filling a need for another area. Bryyo - Ice Bryyo was awesome, but it was too small. I can hardly remember any other part of it, so I guess that's bad. Norion - This was a really small area, and almost all of it felt pretty restricting. Boooooo."
Metroid,33myp2,2CATteam,2,Fri Apr 24 01:54:39 2015 UTC,"I agree, I LOVE Phendrana drifts! The atmosphere is yet to be contended with. The music really helps, like the Downed Orpheon.  Edit: Any idea why those demolition troopers armor is weaker than others though? That seemed a little weird to me.  Edit Edit: Now that I actually think about it, the Demo Troopers are sabotage experts. They have lighter armor to help them move more quickly from place to place. Their job is to be done quickly, something that a heavily armored trooper would be unable to do.  Still though, you think they should be able to fight on par with the others."

Metroid,33lbwk,Ninjatertl,2,Thu Apr 23 14:01:54 2015 UTC,It would be really interesting if we had more canon game first. I already mentionned in other posts how a Musou game would be nice if set during Samus's Federation years or based on wars waged by the Chozos. Other than that maybe an infiltration based game where you are another bounty hunter infiltrating space pirates bases or something like that. I don't know I'm just shooting ideas at random here.  [Edit: Forgot a word]
Metroid,33lbwk,Ninjatertl,2,Thu Apr 23 16:54:33 2015 UTC,No reason a spinoff can't be canon. Kingdom Hearts does it all the time.
Metroid,33lbwk,SephithDarknesse,2,Thu Apr 23 17:09:46 2015 UTC,"Metroid Gear Solid  Take away the Power Suit and make it a stealth action game. You could make it a hybrid of traditional Metroid exploration and stealth sequences, and give Samus some upgrades throughout the game that are specifically exploration based, like climbing gear or an energy grapple (much like Smash Bros' ZSS)  As for weapons, have the standard Safety/Emergency pistol would be the go-to nonlethal option, while other weapons or upgrades could be used for lethal or nonlethal takedowns.  As for the setting, Samus at the end of Fusion quite possibly has the Galactic Federation angry with her and could possibly become wanted herself, so making the antagonists human would lend credibility to a non-lethal play through where it wouldn't make sense for Samus to be a killing machine."

Metroid,33hipq,TectonicImprov,2,Fri Apr 24 12:57:40 2015 UTC,"It might be similar, but it doubt it's the same. Samus' loadout is Chozo tech, and unless Samus allowed the GF to copy it, I don't see them getting their hands on it.  Also, if they did have Samus' gear, how the fuck did a squad of troops get slaughtered by some Dark Splinters in MP2? Disgraceful."
Metroid,33hipq,Leumasperron,12,Sat Apr 25 01:17:44 2015 UTC,"I always thought it was the Chozo in the manga that got thrown across the room (can't remember his name). His armor looks really similar to the power suit, so it would make some sense."

I mean, take away the grey color and what other similarities does it have with the GFS armor? Especially considering that GFS armor didn't even exist until after Super Metroid."
Metroid,33hipq,MC_AnselAdams,2,Wed Apr 22 20:01:17 2015 UTC,"though there weren't any characters from the GF, it was mentioned in metroid 1 that they tried to take zebes by force several times before sending in samus. This guy could be a dead marine from the failed missions before the first game."

Metroid,33hipq,sniktawekim,2,Thu Apr 23 19:19:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly. This is one of my favorite examples of why SM is a great game. Who IS that guy? The question makes the story. If this was Metroid Prime, we'd scan his body and get a 2 page, entirely forgettable story about who he is and why he's there, and no one would ever talk or wonder about it."
Metroid,33hipq,legonro,18,Wed Apr 22 18:52:54 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Prime's scans are never that bad unless its an actual story element.  It was a novel way to introduce story without shoving it down your throat, and to provide background for those who desire it.  I don't agree that the question makes the story.  It serves to give you an element of the stakes: death awaits ahead, but the mystery was never some great thing about Super Metroid.  Super Metroid had many other better things.  It's true that minimalism served it's story well, but what it is is it's gameplay.  It is (arguably) the single greatest 2D platformer ever made.  Perfect difficulty curve.  The right amount of exploration and reward for doing so.  Interesting mechanics that you can master with skill.  While Prime adds a scan mechanic, I don't think it's some egregious outlier, the way that Other M's cutscene-heavy melodramic narrative is, but rather an evolution of the isolation-focused exploration.  It adds rather than detracts.  The scan would be ""Federation solider: deceased / Cause of death, numerous puncture wounds""  Hardly some 2 page entry."
Metroid,33hipq,sniktawekim,8,Wed Apr 22 19:13:52 2015 UTC,"""Unkown Lifeform: deceased / Cause of death, battered until it lived no more."
Metroid,33hipq,Alorha,-1,Wed Apr 22 22:31:49 2015 UTC,"I like learning about the metroid story, but reading the scans in prime was just boring as fuck, imo.  Show, don't tell."
Metroid,33hipq,Elusive2000,8,Wed Apr 22 20:16:56 2015 UTC,"you didnt have to read the scans in prime, you could always just skip em; but you're right, the story would suffer a little bit for it  also, the scans that describe the space pirates' deaths in the early parts of the game set the scene pretty well imo, like the one that mentioned the lack of fluids in one pirate's body and the possibility that it was used for nourishment"
Metroid,33hipq,sniktawekim,2,Wed Apr 22 20:22:29 2015 UTC,"I agree. I really really liked some aspects of the game, like the atmosphere was pulled off really well, and with metroid games, I don't want to miss a thing. I want to get all of the details.   I enjoyed a lot of the scans early on in the game, but as the game went on, I felt like they were getting wordier and wordier without being as interesting, and it felt like it just wasnt worthwhile to read them all, but that irritates me to some degree because I want to experience everything there is in that game."
Metroid,33hipq,Elusive2000,4,Wed Apr 22 20:26:56 2015 UTC,"To each his own.  It's hard to show in a story of isolation, and you could do just fine and figure out what was happening without them.  There was plenty shown.  I will take reading over whatever it was that passed for writing in Other M any day of the week.  Metroid Prime is lauded as one of the greatest gamecube games for a reason: it got the atmosphere right.  Shitty cutscenes or overwrought narrative would ruin that, so it put the background in the background.  Requiring you to read very little."

Metroid,33hipq,Elusive2000,14,Wed Apr 22 18:28:30 2015 UTC,"That sounds awful.  Dark Samus and SA-X both have no reason to exist in Super Metroid.  Dark Samus is a mutated phazon-entity using samus' cast off phazon suit, and the whole source of that was blown up by the time of Super Metroid.  Hell, Dark Samus merged with the aurora unit on Phaaze, and that got blown the hell up along with the planet.  SA-X is the X-parasite infecting Samus' castoff suit... the suit she's wearing in Super Metroid.  It wouldn't be an interesting twist, it just wouldn't make sense, especially since there's literally no explanation for this entity anywhere else in the game.  So even people who didn't realize it didn't make sense wouldn't get any closure.  It's a terrible idea.  And 3-D Super Metroid?  Play Prime, pretty much.  Super Metroid is perhaps the pinnacle of 2D platform design.  You do not improve it by making it 3D.  It wasn't designed to be 3D, and the change can only make it worse.  This is a terrible idea from every angle.  It made me angrier than it had any right to.  I may have problems.  Apologies for the rant.  *Edit: I only mention the SA-X because it's the only other ""dark samus""-esque entity the series."
Metroid,33hipq,twinfyre,2,Wed Apr 22 18:46:52 2015 UTC,"Easy now... I mean no hostility.    Hell, Dark Samus merged with the aurora unit on Phaaze, and that got blown the hell up along with the planet.   Retro has never stated directly that Dark Samus is dead. It's also never said that Dark Samus' particle splitting ability would cease to function without phazon. There are some fans who speculate that the ship at the end of prime 3 is Dark Samus(due to the similar shape to the gunship).   The main reason I thought it would be a cool idea is that it would open up for more games to connect Super Metroid to the Prime series. The Prime games and Super are the best in the Metroid series. Why not make them both have canon that works off of eachother?"
Metroid,33hipq,Elusive2000,2,Thu Apr 23 02:39:54 2015 UTC,"Is it possible, perhaps, though this would still be a terrible way to connect them.  The thing survives planetary destruction to be ended by mini-kraid?  I feel the prime games already did a fine job connecting themselves to existing cannon.  Plus a Super Metroid remake should never ever ever in any circumstance or reality be in 3D.  It could only make the game worse, since it's already the apex of its particular art.  I also meant nothing personal.  I was a bit harsh in attacking the idea, but I suppose I've some really strong opinions on the matter.  Like I said, sort of turned into a rant for some reason.  I probably shouldn't take it so seriously, as this post basically became the same thing."

At least with Flaahgra's Tentacles, you can legitimately think ""Boss scanned, time to kill it"", whilst entirely missing the tentacles at your feet.  As much as I love Prime 1, the asinine scans that are able to be permanently missed sting harder than the scans in Prime 3 of things that appear literally once, and you cannot immediately distinguish them without going out of your way with the scan visor.  Normally because you've killed what seems to be your run of the mill Assault Pirate Trooper while in Hypermode, while in reality, you killed the VERY RARE Assault SHIELD Trooper before it could get its shield up.  Edit: You also still keep your scans into a new game if you're playing the Wii version of the game, so it's literally just a jaunt out to get what you missed on those versions of the games."

Metroid,33j4rc,PhazonZim,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:51:06 2015 UTC,well...looks like they finally gave us something. What was your reaction?
Metroid,33j4rc,MastuDenton,4,Wed Jun 17 05:43:33 2015 UTC,making story the foundation for a Metroid game is a mistake
Metroid,33j4rc,DepthsofNorfair,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:03:42 2015 UTC,How does that reflect on Prime 3 and Fusion?
Metroid,33j4rc,AuraRyu,3,Thu Apr 23 03:32:26 2015 UTC,"While both games have become beloved with age (and in comparison to other games. Looking at you, Hunters and Other M), Prime 3 and Fusion both faced criticism at release for an overabundance of story that detracted from the feeling of isolation and created a handhold-y feel.    The best parts of Prime 3 and Fusion were when the story was minimized, and the player was thrust into foreign and lonely environments (think parts of Elysia and the second visit to Sector 4). A big part of Metroid is that feeling of isolation and loneliness that oozes atmosphere. Metroid shouldn't put us in the middle of a big story, but instead should let us put ourselves in the place of Samus, exploring a lost dead planet, trying to put together the puzzle of what happened there and escape it alive.   Metroid has lore, but it's entirely unessential, and that's part of the games' beauty.   Edit: Elysia not Elysium."
Metroid,33j4rc,AuraRyu,1 point,Thu Apr 23 04:57:01 2015 UTC,Also every moment in Prime 3 you set foot on a new planet. You know what to look for but since you don't know where or when you'll find it you're on your own again.
Metroid,33j4rc,bk-Ratchet_andCrank,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:53:17 2015 UTC,"I see. That's a good way to put it. I didn't know about the criticisms you mentioned, but it makes sense. It also makes me wonder how Other M would have done if they took another year or so to develop the story so that it would be just enough plot, but not enough to ruin the whole Metroid mood(and, y'know, the freaking main character of the series) like it did."
Metroid,33j4rc,SpaceWarriorSamus-,1 point,Thu Apr 23 11:45:08 2015 UTC,"Wasn't there someone who worked on a RPGMaker Metroid game? I mean a good one, not Prime Missions."
Metroid,33j4rc,twinfyre,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:51:32 2015 UTC,The castlevania series is very similar and some of the titles feature very rpg esque elements like level up.
Metroid,33f5gj,turkeygoobler,17,Wed Apr 22 00:45:20 2015 UTC,"I'd go Metroid: Zero Mission. They're all great games, besides Other M and Prime Hunters for the DS."
Metroid,33f5gj,Mr_Tuesday1,5,Wed Apr 22 01:02:17 2015 UTC,What's wrong with hunters?

Metroid,33f5gj,jeffpewpewdash,3,Wed Apr 22 05:25:47 2015 UTC,"It had hella enjoyable multiplayer though, at least for me at the time"
Metroid,33f5gj,Lightfail,3,Wed Apr 22 20:00:29 2015 UTC,I regret not getting around to doing the online multiplayer that much. I feel I missed the best part of that game.
Metroid,33f5gj,jeffpewpewdash,7,Wed Apr 22 23:24:08 2015 UTC,"Prime, Zero Mission, and Super Metroid are all good places to start.  Prime occurs right after the Classic Metroid. Super Metroid summarizes the events of Classic Metroid and Metroid 2 in its prologue. And Zero Mission retcons Classic Metroid and is also Metroid on Easy Mode."
Metroid,33f5gj,Akran_Trancilon,14,Wed Apr 22 02:07:17 2015 UTC,"I would say Metroid Prime for GameCube is a pretty good place. If you want to be frustrated and hate everything, however, the original Metroid is available for 3DS on the eShop."
Metroid,33f5gj,Gladdstone,8,Wed Apr 22 00:53:41 2015 UTC,"I would suggest starting with Super Metroid. All the games are really good at directing you where you need to go, but I'm partial to the SNES game the most. I play it at least once or twice a year just because I love it so much. But there's a reason I love it, ya know?  So start with Super Metroid, then do the Prime games, probably, or play Fusion on the GBA. I think Fusion is supposed to take place after Super Metroid?  The best ones in the series are Super Metroid and Primes, in my opinion. If you need the lore, Zero Mission is a remake of the NES Metroid with updated lore and gameplay and whatnot. Metroid II: Return of Samus hasn't been remade and I've never played it.  Edit for the Bonus: Everyone says the Castlevania games are Metroid-adjacent because you have to travel through a map and collect items to traverse through areas previously un-traversable, but I've never had a good time with the only post-NES Castlevania I've played. I played Castlevania 1 & 2 and I liked both of them.  Metroid is a lot like an open-world Megaman to me? Like instead of a Stage Select you have to traverse a map. But you still get items that make it easier.  Legend of Zelda is similar, as well, in the collecting of items aspect. So in that vein, Darksiders, God of War.  Man I miss original God of War."
Metroid,33f5gj,cynicaldesire,11,Wed Apr 22 01:25:09 2015 UTC,"I feel he should play zero mission before super metroid. It's easier to navigate through and is simpler to control. Definitely play super metroid after though, it's a must."
Metroid,33f5gj,notjustinbailey,3,Wed Apr 22 01:52:07 2015 UTC,"the only post-NES Castlevania I've played   Which one? I greatly enjoyed some of them like Aria of Sorrow, others not so much."
Metroid,33f5gj,rqaa3721,2,Wed Apr 22 02:10:49 2015 UTC,"I had to look it up because I couldn't remember. I got it on PSN and I've tried to play it and I just can't stand it.  ""What is a man? A miserable little pile of secrets."" Symphony of the Night."
Metroid,33f5gj,cynicaldesire,2,Wed Apr 22 13:03:23 2015 UTC,"I agree. Super Metroid is one of the best games ever made, for any system. The game, graphics, and music are all epic."
Metroid,33f5gj,narshe_,3,Wed Apr 22 03:39:15 2015 UTC,"It's important to know that almost none of the Metroid games require you to know the plots of any other title in the series, especially the 2D ones."
Metroid,33f5gj,rqaa3721,3,Wed Apr 22 02:12:06 2015 UTC,"Super Metroid, Metroid Prime, and Zero Mission are all great.  You can start with any of them."

Metroid,33f5gj,Leonhart01,2,Wed Apr 22 07:19:15 2015 UTC,Have to agree with that one.
Metroid,33f5gj,txcrnr,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:59:51 2015 UTC,Fusion is my favorite metroid game. I have yet to play the original metroid and super metroid (it's $60!!!) :(
Metroid,33f5gj,Danthezooman,1 point,Wed Apr 22 04:55:22 2015 UTC,"Zero Mission is the best first pick imo, it has just about everything that Metroid is known for and chronologically it's the first game in the story. After that Super Metroid, it's widely agreed upon to be the best game in the franchise. Then Prime, you'll only truly get to appreciate how well they transitioned the franchise into 3D when you've played some of the 2D entries.  After that you can pretty much pick up whatever game you like from the franchise. It does need to be said that Hunters, Other M and the first Metroid aren't very popular though."
Metroid,33f5gj,Masterofknees,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:20:34 2015 UTC,"Prime. Not because it's the best Metroid game, but because Metroid in a 3D space is easier to access. So yeah. Metroid Prime."
Metroid,33f5gj,InsanityRaptor,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:48:41 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest Zero Mission->Metroid II (you can leave it out and wait for the fan remake of it if you don't seem to like it)->Super Metroid->Metroid Fusion  The prime series I would suggest to play last, just because it's something very different and I don't think going back to a 2D game after prime is the best idea. Playing prime first I would say no to, because then you would miss the feeling of switching from 2D to 3D."
Metroid,33f5gj,Rattlehead1221,0,Thu Apr 23 23:05:38 2015 UTC,"Super Metroid. Although you need to realize its the best game in the series, and will not be topped. If you have a 3ds get the first. Mainly for the feeling and music, to see if it clicks.   Enjoy the games man!"

Metroid,33d2bv,SpaceWarriorSamus-,23,Tue Apr 21 15:23:41 2015 UTC,"It is officially stated somewhere that her age is ""unknown"". Can try to look up the source if needed, but I'm very certain about it because there was a topic like that a while ago.  Some people also suggested that because of the chozo her aging might not be like that of a normal human. That was just a theory though."
Metroid,33d2bv,gamerpenguin,1 point,Tue Apr 21 18:09:03 2015 UTC,"I would guess she ages differently, and even then the Chozo probably didn't know how old she was when they found her, and she may have been too young to remember."
Metroid,33d2bv,_GS,16,Sat May 2 22:02:15 2015 UTC,I don't think its ever officially stated. But 20-30 seems believable

Metroid,33d2bv,Romano44,4,Tue Apr 21 16:59:39 2015 UTC,"It's hard to accurately guess her age considering we have no idea how her Chozo dna affects her aging.

Metroid,33ceyy,Elogotar,5,Tue Apr 21 11:47:40 2015 UTC,I got stuck a little later in Brinstar I think. Probably because I've been abusing walljumping like a fiend on all these grapple walls. Guess I got used to all the shenanigans in ReDesign.
Metroid,33ceyy,theSharkness,3,Tue Apr 21 13:39:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm doing the same thing. I'm not sure, but it feels like wall jumping is easier in this hack than Super Metroid, maybe I've just gotten better at it though. Between that and the way you can just spam bombs to bomb jump instead of having to have perfect timing, I'm getting into places I feel like I wasn't supposed to be yet. I just got to that grapple beam area myself and I've already wall jumped my way to an Energy Tank I don't think I'm supposed to have, lol. I've decided that, just to be on the safe side, I'll save state every once in a while and if I know I'm about to do something I may not be able to come back from."

Metroid,338di6,Flameshark9860,-6,Mon Apr 20 15:11:09 2015 UTC,"You're reading too far into it, dude. This is one of the least sexualized images with ZSS I've seen. The focus is not on her breasts, she's not in a provocative pose, and she doesn't have a stereotypically ""feminine"" build. Just because she's got breasts doesn't mean it's sexual.  This is really good."
Metroid,338di6,Bellstrom,8,Mon Apr 20 16:28:05 2015 UTC,I think the point he was trying to get across was that redditors would complain regardless.
Metroid,338di6,twinfyre,4,Mon Apr 20 19:07:02 2015 UTC,"Artists really don't understand how boobs work. The material would be spread between them, not jammed between them like that."
Metroid,338di6,that_dude_you_know,3,Mon Apr 20 16:53:49 2015 UTC,"lol boob socks  Still, it might just be that Samus is just gettin drawn based on her Smash appearance (in-game). Her render gets it right, but her in-game model messes it up. Funnily enough, Metroid: Other M also gets it right."
Metroid,338di6,Butter_Is_Life,2,Mon Apr 20 19:13:01 2015 UTC,"Her boobs always bothered me in Smash because they looked so strange and unrealistic, now I know why, they look fine in the render."

Metroid,338di6,Butter_Is_Life,1 point,Tue Apr 21 03:40:29 2015 UTC,I'd imagine they'd make a skin tight suit much more comfortable than if the suit wasn't shaped like your body.
Metroid,338di6,twinfyre,1 point,Tue Apr 21 03:46:32 2015 UTC,"True! I think if they're to make sense anywhere, that a skin tight suit might at least make more sense than say a dress shirt or blouse, since it's more likely to be customized to one's body."
Metroid,338di6,Butter_Is_Life,1 point,Tue Apr 21 03:48:32 2015 UTC,"I always thought that was a consquence of Smash being a fighting game that models look exaggerated. Seeing the way characters like Sheik, Marth, and Lucina bend when doing aerial attacks might cause you back pains just by looking at them."

Metroid,33a7if,2CATteam,1 point,Mon Apr 20 23:48:41 2015 UTC,"You know ... I think for many of us who played Super Metroid back in the day, the first descent into Lower Norfair was a rite of passage that gave us goosebumps.  By that point in the game, you would have explored nearly the entire planet of Zebes.  And you would have made a long (but not dangerous) trek through Norfair, now armed to the brim with nearly every upgrade in the game.  Even the regular lava of Norfair could no longer hurt you, clad in the Gravity Suit, and enemies posed minimal challenge.  Then you found the elevator at the end of that room with the deep lava pit and went in after saving at the convenient station ...  To hear the trumpets and the drums for the first time. Daaa ... DUM!  Daaa ... DUM!  The color palette was the same crimson, but the architecture changed.  The muted scarlet glow of Norfair seemed brighter down here.  The lava hurt.  The ground itself lay far, far more broken and uneven.  And the denizens of this bizarre underground ruin seemed to be very, very dangerous indeed.  Instinctively, you knew that you were no longer in an environment of trivial hazards.  Your heart started pounding as relentlessly as the music in your ears.  Daaaaa ... dum ... daaaaaa dum ...  And you seldom had any reprieve in this new danger zone.  Zebesians colored dull brass, resistant to your weapons.  Speedy rippers with rocket tails.  Rooms that filled with lava.  Space pirates that knew kung fu.  All of it reaching a crescendo in front of his door, and you sensed that a titanic struggle awaited on the other side.  The goosebumps started on the elevator down and never quite stopped.  For all of its brilliance, Metroid Prime got this part wrong.  You went into Magmoor and heard the Lower Norfair music immediately.  And this felt ... disappointing, in a way, compared to the surreal experience of Super Metroid.  Maybe I'm being overly nostalgic, but the music of Lower Norfair is almost too sacred to be used as often - as casually - as it was in Prime.  Thank you, Mr. Dillard, for bringing us the goosebumps again."

I'd say the exact same thing about the ""Rocket High Heels."" Samus isn't going to be fighting in the Zero Suit. And if Samus needs a quick boost in the air there are many options. High Jump Boots, Space Jump Boots, Space Jump, heck she could even use Screw Attack for convenience.  If Samus was in a hostage situation and maybe needs stealth she's fuuuuuuuucked. She'd get her ass kicked in the Zero Suit. A good alternative to the Zero Suit would be the final form of the Fusion Suit. As we know the Fusion Suit allows for stealthy and quick way. So yeah.

Metroid,3369l0,Wombo194,14,Mon Apr 20 00:17:20 2015 UTC,"Well one thing you should keep in mind is that the Prime games aren't shooters, they're adventure games.

Metroid,3369l0,Wombo194,2,Mon Apr 20 00:53:20 2015 UTC,"I do know they are adventure games and not just shooters. It seems a bit similar to Half-Life in that there's a lot of exploration and stuff, because it happens to be an adventure game."
Metroid,3369l0,woofle07,11,Mon Apr 20 01:03:49 2015 UTC,"Well Half-Life is very linear, even the first one has you exploring a linear path with set pieces and focus on combat. Metroid Prime 3 might be a bit similar but really they aren't comparable."
Metroid,3369l0,Toysoldier34,2,Mon Apr 20 01:14:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe there could be a sci-fi shooter scale or chart or something. While I do see your point in that Half-Life doesn't have as much exploration as Metroid, it certainly has some. But it definitely is linear, you're right.  My point's kind of falling apart now. :|"
Metroid,3369l0,General_Hide,5,Mon Apr 20 02:00:28 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind, is that the first Prime game comes the closest to the traditional games in terms of tone. It captures the spirit of the game and translates it well into 3D. Echoes is slightly more linear, with not much reason to go back to areas you've already cleared, but still with plenty of stuff to find, and Corruption is even less exploration based. Not that 2 and 3 are bad games, but Corruption especially tends to lean further toward the shooter side of the spectrum."
Metroid,3369l0,Luigimario280,1 point,Mon Apr 20 04:15:23 2015 UTC,"I haven't played the first two on the Wii yet, but part of the reason they are less shooter and more just adventure game is because for pretty much all of the combat you lock onto enemies and aren't needing to aim every shot like in a traditional shooter with the joysticks. With the Wii controller you get a little more free aim, but you still lock on a good amount."
Metroid,3369l0,twinfyre,4,Mon Apr 20 10:34:44 2015 UTC,"The first 2 are way better than the third, just to let you know. I ended up loving the first 2, but feeling kinda meh about the 3rd.  What I want to say is that unless you absolutely hate the third one, you should definitely give the other primes a try, and in order if you care about the story"
Metroid,3369l0,Spinkler,3,Mon Apr 20 00:45:30 2015 UTC,What don't you like about Prime 3? Personally I enjoyed it as much as the other two.
Metroid,3369l0,twinfyre,7,Mon Apr 20 01:22:49 2015 UTC,"Each game delivers different things to the table. Prime 1 is the most rounded of the two, focussing on maintaining the classic Metroid formula while still bringing new things to the table. Prime 2 is a lot more exploration oriented. There's a lot of backtracking, and a lot of lore to sift through. It's also Retro's first departure from the norm. There's a lot of risks in Prime 2. It's my favorite of the series for those reasons. Prime 3 was a huge departure from the norm. There's plenty of characters, epic fights, and varied worlds. You could say that Prime 3 is the action game of the series. I love it for what it is, but there will be people who will hate it for those exact reasons I've listed."
Metroid,3369l0,General_Hide,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:04:47 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that feeling of isolation and loneliness in the first two. MP3 missed that mark by a long way with all the other characters interrupting your story. Not necessarily a bad thing, but certainly not as ""Metroid"" as the others."
Metroid,3369l0,brentendo3,1 point,Mon Apr 20 23:28:46 2015 UTC,There was still a bit of isolation. The Bryyo sections of the game were classic Metroid Prime.

For one thing, I hated the controls. I don't like using the wiimote/nunchuck. I also remember that I didn't care for the way the story was playing out and the overall feel of exploration in this one compared to the others. Again, I would have to replay it (which I plan on doing after finishing Prime 2 again) to give specifics since I don't remember a whole lot of the game"
Metroid,3369l0,twinfyre,2,Mon Apr 20 11:11:54 2015 UTC,Prime 3 was my first game and I love it. Once you get past the starting Federation ship the game really picks up and will suck you in.  I didn't feel like I was missing too much of the story. I knew soon enough that I was supposed to be ridding these planets of Phazon. It's pretty much what happened in the first 2 Primes. Some things you'll miss story wise are little lore details from previous game scans and maybe the origins of the final bosses.
Metroid,3369l0,Jammintk,3,Mon Apr 20 05:39:37 2015 UTC,"You can play the first two. All you need is Prime Trilogy, which is cheap either in retail or in the eshop.  You can play prime 3 without playing the other two, but you should probably go in order"
Metroid,3369l0,TurboRex300,4,Sun Apr 19 23:57:18 2015 UTC,"Prime 3 was made to be a gateway title. There's less of what makes Metroid Metroid, but those compromises were brought in so it could appeal to a wider audience. And it works. Metroid Prime 3 is an excellent game. It can be played by itself, but if you like what you saw, feel free to try out the other games. There aren't really any shocking plot twists in the metroid series, it's more about the experience than anything. You can play any Metroid game in any order.   Just don't play Other M until later. Although Other M was meant to be a gateway title for japanese audiences, it was an utter failure in that regard (I still had fun with it)."

I got to Mogenar and got completely stuck for a reason you'll probably find out. Never managed to get past until a few months ago when I went back in Dolphin with a new save and realised there was a mode that let you actually lock on, instead of just locking the camera. After that it was a breeze. :)"
Metroid,3369l0,scg06,3,Mon Apr 20 03:11:49 2015 UTC,Does the Advanced Cursor modify the way you move the camera and aim apart from the locking on? Because the way you aim and move the camera is quite ingenious and I like it.
Metroid,3369l0,cephalopodAscendant,1 point,Mon Apr 20 04:10:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, apart from the cursor sensitivity. The other two settings have a cursor and lock on when you aim, but advanced just locks the camera to an enemy and lets you aim for yourself. The sensitivity changes when you switch aiming modes, but that can also be set independently."

A lot of features are very poorly emulated and there are a boatload of game specific hacks and workarounds.  Also its sound core is terrible and gets a LOT of sounds and music effects wrong.

Now, some emulators have soft-patching - which is, if a patch is named the same as a rom, it will patch the ROM when it loads it up. I like to do hard-patching, because then I can give it out to others or use them in emulators without soft-patching. Hard-patching isn't even that hard. You can find a neat little tool called Lunar IPS by following this link. It's simple - you load your ROM, load your patch, and Bob's your uncle."

Metroid,336hv2,Spinkler,1 point,Mon Apr 20 06:47:05 2015 UTC,As a console peasant: wat?
Metroid,336hv2,MekkaGodzilla,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:36:54 2015 UTC,"Okay, so bsnes is a cycle accurate SNES emulator. Well, the ""accuracy"" branch is, anyway. This means that it emulates the SNES perfectly, but it requires a good CPU to do so (at least 3Ghz, with a modern design, IIRC). Retroarch is kind of like a front-end for emulators, it can accept different emulator cores so it can run all sorts of emulators. For my description you'd essentially be running Retroarch with the bsnes core (or ""plugin"", if you prefer that terminology).  The beauty of Retroarch is that it allows you to use shaders to modify the video output. If you prefer your game to look like it's being played on an old CRT TV then you'll love this feature. Halation (or phosphor glow) is an effect present on old CRT TVs - it essentially makes neighbouring pixels glow with light bleeding. It looks incredibly authentic when coupled with the scanlines these shaders tend to offer. A lot of these shaders will also curve the screen, although I'm not a fan of screen curve (I strived to get flat CRTs back in the day!), so I personally just prefer a nice CRT scanline shader with halation.  It can take a little effort to find the correct shader (there are different types and not all are compatible with Retroarch) and get it working but I think I have some that are compatible with Retroarch here. If you decide to take this route feel free to reply to one of my messages or hit me up in a PM and I'll send you the one I prefer if I can find it.  Good luck and have fun. :)  edit: I should say that I'm not sure if these shaders are exclusive to Retroarch these days. I've been using it long enough that they weren't supported by other emulators/front-ends when I started but that may have changed since then. You can get SNES9x cores for Retroarch, too. If you're going to use SNES9x I personally recommend still using Retroarch, but hunt for the ""SNES9xNext"" core instead of the SNES9x one. IIRC it's still being maintained where the original isn't, or it's a more current branch or something like that."

Performance depends entirely on your specs, with special focus on the CPU. Looks like Echoes has some minor issues on all systems as well.  You might be able to map the controls to mouse/keyboard if you can get creative. If you get invested in emulation it might be worth it to pick up one of these. I use a PS3 controller when emulating and it works just fine.   If you've got the rig for it, playing gamecube games at 4x resolution with Antialiasing really is the best way to play them. /r/dolphinemulator and the wiki posted above are great sources if you want to do more research on the subject."

Metroid,332hf3,AndrewToth,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:06:37 2015 UTC,I did the exact same thing. This hack has forced me to think outside of the box in some scenarios.
Metroid,332hf3,LSD001,2,Tue Apr 21 02:28:05 2015 UTC,This is pretty good. I'm stuck near the end of the game. Trying to get in the last part of Maridia but the only entrances I can find are blocked by gate 15. Anyone know where the gate 15 switch is.
Metroid,332hf3,AndrewToth,2,Sun May 3 04:20:44 2015 UTC,Just started playing it and I'm already impressed by the design and polish. Why is her helmet blue though?
Metroid,332hf3,LSD001,2,Tue Jun 2 05:28:13 2015 UTC,Just because. Redesign in color scheme all around.

Metroid,332hf3,SpicySpicySpice,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:27:44 2015 UTC,"Like I said on the other thread, it's pretty cool. Good level design and pacing so far. However, not sure what differentiates it from super.  Does anyone have any tips on doing the damage boost? There's a power up that requires it but it is too hard I feel."
Metroid,332hf3,hik4ru,6,Sun Apr 19 07:03:43 2015 UTC,"The little things are different.   It's made from Project Base mod which changes up the Super Metroid engine with some tweaks here and there. For example:    Jump is different in spin and fluidity.  You can now spin in mid-air if you didn't start with a jump spin by pressing the jump button again. Morph ball now feels more gravitated to the ground and less bouncy along with new sound effects.  The default beam in general is now weaker in power but allows more shots to be fired at one time. Also looks different in animation. When Samus hits the ground, there is an added animation frame with sound to make it feel more solid. Hold the RUN button: When you are holding run, you can quickly perform actions that can get you out of a tight spot! For example, hold RUN and then press JUMP. You will automatically somersault, even when you're a morph-ball! (this tip from the read-me document). Some enemies AI are set to be more aggressive and less predictable (Red ledge crawlers will follow you instead of just walking around in one direction). The bomb ability now feels more useful as it is more powerful, easier to use, and able to lay bombs at a faster rate (this allows for easier vertical bomb-jumps as well as forward bomb-jump). Also, new sound effect for bombs. You can now draw energy orbs and missile drops to yourself by charging the beam (familiar to Metroid: Prime).   That's all that I have noticed thus far, haven't been far enough yet to really see what else is there.  Edit: noticed new changes."
Metroid,332hf3,SpicySpicySpice,2,Sun Apr 19 16:27:59 2015 UTC,Super missiles can also be spammed like a normal missile as well.
Metroid,332hf3,krstrahm,2,Mon Apr 20 01:48:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the mention of Project Base, and for keeping this thread engaging for new folks playing! I've just put out version 0.7.1. A few things missing from your list:   Speed Booster has been made MUCH more versatile, and in several ways Running speed is kept when you land from a jump or fall (AKA bunnyhopping) Spring Ball allows you to run in ball form Space Jump no longer 'dies' from falling too far   The readme txt has a more comprehensive list of changes."
Metroid,332hf3,krstrahm,1 point,Sat Apr 25 12:45:10 2015 UTC,"It's been my pleasure! I feel that these mods to Super Metroid are more true of a ""sequel"" than anything Nintendo plans to put out in the near future.  Thank you again for completing my list. I made my list through memory of the game-play.  In order to reach a broader audience, I plan on doing a full stream of both Hyper Metroid and now your latest version of Project Base.  May I have your permission to do so?"

Hard to describe it, but its to fluid I`d say, and doesnt feel powerful. You can listen ""Dragonfood"" or the Ridley part from Metroid Metals ""Boss Medley"", so you know what I mean. Other than that, I liked it"

Metroid,331g6p,ozzAR0th,4,Sat Apr 18 16:19:50 2015 UTC,I miss the shoulder pads but her gun is so awesome.
Metroid,331g6p,RandyK44,5,Sat Apr 18 19:36:22 2015 UTC,And now I finally realize why the Fusion suit (and I suppose the power suit too) always bugged me a little bit. Gotta have them shoulder spheres.
Metroid,331g6p,xjwarrior,3,Sat Apr 18 19:40:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah I love the big old Shoulder pads, but I feel the lack of them in the Fusion suit give it a sleek, stripped down feel. One which I wanted to replicate with the Post Fusion Suit.  I kinda planned the plot for this suit to develop back into a more Chozo-like suit as Samus obtains upgrades for it. Including big shoulders."
Metroid,331g6p,PhazonZim,4,Sat Apr 18 19:43:05 2015 UTC,"It could be polished a bit more, maybe give it a more distinct and interesting silhouette. I'm personally a pretty big fan of her shark-snout chest plate, I usually don't like what fan artists replace it with. It's definitely a good start htough, I think you have a lot of good ideas with this one."
Metroid,331g6p,NekkidSnaku,1 point,Sat Apr 18 21:21:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! It's based on the Fusion suit, which removed the pointed chestplate that the Varia Suit usually has. although I've tried to style it like the Varia chestplate, while keeping the same shape as the Fusion suit."

Metroid,33532c,ozzAR0th,6,Sun Apr 19 17:05:35 2015 UTC,"You and I have a very different definition of the term, ""zero suit""."
Metroid,33532c,twinfyre,0,Sun Apr 19 22:06:53 2015 UTC,That's kinda the point of the redesign. It's meant to be a different view on how the Zero Suit (or just... Samus underneath the Power Suit) should be portrayed.
Metroid,33532c,cereal_bawks,2,Sun Apr 19 22:10:37 2015 UTC,"Samus underneath the Power Suit   I don't see how this redesign allows her to even fit into the Power Suit. Maybe it's just me, but it seems a bit too bulky to fit."
Metroid,33532c,twinfyre,3,Mon Apr 20 00:03:00 2015 UTC,"Also, if this is the zero suit, then what's that skintight material she's wearing underneath it? Negative one?"
Metroid,33532c,twinfyre,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:43:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the suit looks very restrictive. The zero suit is meant to provide as little resistance as possible."
Metroid,33532c,twinfyre,-2,Sun Apr 19 22:20:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how much physical activity you do but skin tight is never better for resistance. Like it works for an acrobat wearing a leotard because the clothing is not going over any joints, but the current zero suit would be much more restrictive than something more akin to military clothing (what I based this design off)  But no it is definitely a large departure from the original so it's gonna conflict with the ideas for the original a bit haha"
Metroid,33532c,PhazonZim,1 point,Sun Apr 19 22:24:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe it would've been better if you based it off of under armour. that's much closer to what the zero suit looks like, and it allows for much more movement than your basic military combat gear."
Metroid,33532c,Mr_Pennybags,5,Mon Apr 20 02:42:26 2015 UTC,"I hate when people have criticism that doesn't extend beyond ""it's bad"". It's really demeaning to the artist. I think the design is good, but it doesn't feel like what it's supposed to be. It's not as streamlined as the zero suit, but not as heavy as the armour-- it certainly doesn't feel like it could fit under the armour. This very much feels like  light armour. It's not dissimilar to the light armor in Mass Effect 1. I think a different pose would show off the design a bit better. Maybe something with a wide, low stance and both feet on the ground?  Don't let people dissuade you from changing up a design because it's a character they really like. There's something to be said about keeping with the spirit of a design, but if that's not your intention then people can get mean-spirited about the direction you take it. I'd say nix it being Samus and push it even further in the tactical direction-- maybe like the Frogs in MGS4? It's a little bit hard to think of a situation where Samus would need this outfit rather than the full armor or the zero suit."
Metroid,33532c,Mortimer42,0,Tue Apr 21 08:07:53 2015 UTC,"I think one of the things that needs a little explaining with my design is that it's not necessarily meant to sit like that underneath the Power Suit, rather it's the undercoating that generates the Power Suit around it, so the main sections are all meant to be for parts of the Power Suit, which is what influenced my design. And yeah I personally really dislike the direction Nintendo took with the Zero Suit, so my design definitely is trying to not be ""Zero Suit-y""  Thanks for the critique though, yeah it's definitely less streamlined, it's meant to be comfortable but also resemble the Power Suit's components (skin tight isn't comfortable, Nintendo)  And yeah The Frogs were actually a big inspiration of mine when thinking about what the Zero Suit should be haha"
Metroid,33532c,InsanityRaptor,3,Tue Apr 21 15:45:19 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but this really isn't very good. The design is bad, the concept is bad, it doesn't look very metroid or very samus Aran at all."
Metroid,331pb2,hik4ru,4,Sat Apr 18 17:45:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry if this is obvious, but what's the difference between headered and unheadered?"
Metroid,331pb2,lizzychret,6,Sat Apr 18 23:10:09 2015 UTC,"Since that other ass wasn't willing to explain, what you're downloading is an IPS patch that you apply to a ROM of Super Metroid. Depending on the ROM you have you'll need to use the headered or Unheadered version of the hack.  From the Readme   If your super metroid ROM is 3,072kb, it is UNHEADERED. If it is 3,073kb, it is HEADERED. You'll need to download the respective version of the hack in order for it to successfully and properly patch."

Metroid,331pb2,Chip--Chipperson,2,Sun Apr 19 01:24:10 2015 UTC,"To maybe entice some of you, I've provided a brief synopsis of the beginning of this game below, as it is fairly different from SM. But first a quick note about installation if any of you are willing to dive into this adventure with me:  The installation only take about 10 min or less, it's described in the readme that come with it. I made another rom folder and called it Hyper Metroid and just copied my super metroid rom into it, then you modify it with the instructions given.  So for any that are curious, I've just landed on Zebes and the story up to this point is: You are a Space engineer, with a specialty in Chozo constructs (presumably). Space Pirates attack and kill everyone in your city/colony, including your husband, following complication lead to the miscarriage of your child.  To seek vengeance, you engineer and build a chozo battle suit. With gathered intel, you locate a space pirate base and eliminate a ""fake"" mother brain. You learn sooner after that the space pirates hope to use Metroids as bioweapons.  Planning to stop them in there tracks, you destroy the metoids of SR388, all but an infant metroid, which you take and plant in an illegal weapons facility. Knowing the Pirates will come for this metroid, you tag it, and when they inevitably steal it away, you track them back to Zebes.  I'm curious as to where this story will go next. I'm not sure if who I'm playing is Samus in another universe, or still reside in the same universe but as another individual that isn't Samus. All the above info is revealed in the intro, so I don't want to give away anything revealed in the gameplay, but I may come back to comment once I'm further into the game."
Metroid,331pb2,Kipstopher,2,Sun Apr 19 05:20:23 2015 UTC,"It's the same samus but different story I assume her parents weren't killed leading to her following in their footsteps, and in the alt universe of this she marries Adam and the rest is in the game"
Metroid,331pb2,LSD001,2,Sat Apr 18 21:19:08 2015 UTC,"Gave it a whirl. Pretty cool. Good pacing and difficulty. I got to the area after Brinstar where you have to damage boost across a gap in Crateria, but I just can't seem to get it. It's a tough trick."

Metroid,334s01,txcrnr,8,Sun Apr 19 15:25:30 2015 UTC,"I still don't see the big deal. If you were to wear a suit like the Power Suit, would you want normal, bulky clothing or a skin tight, thin full body suit under it to give maximum mobility and comfort?"
Metroid,334s01,Please_Hit_Me,-2,Sun Apr 19 16:11:20 2015 UTC,"If you have a big, awesome power suit why would you ever want to take it off in a place where it would help?"
Metroid,334s01,Please_Hit_Me,7,Sun Apr 19 16:22:32 2015 UTC,"Keeping the Power Suit on requires insane amounts of mental energy from Samus, just saying. For an example in Zero Mission where she ""unlinks"" the suit connection, she thought she was safe and the mission was over. It's not shocking that she'd want to take a bit of a breather after having non-stop intense fighting action for hours.  And she wouldn't take it off in the middle of a fight or a mission. What I meant with my message was that you want the best clothing under the armor for efficiency, not looks. It just so happens to be that the Zero Suit design is the most optimal when it comes to maneuverability and comfort while wearing her Power Suit."
Metroid,334s01,Mortis2000,1 point,Sun Apr 19 16:30:49 2015 UTC,I suspect that the bigger issue is the fact she's changed from what used to be a large Amazonian woman so a petite girl with big tits.   I realise it's all about bringing in the demographic you want to sell the game too but it just doesn't fit the character... Especially not in the game which shall not be named.

And if not the Zero Suit, fans would have latched onto and ""sexualized"" any of her other ending suits. In fact, you see it all the time with the Justin Bailey suit. Just give up these inane arguments."
Metroid,334s01,ttopE,-1,Sun Apr 19 16:36:04 2015 UTC,"I understand that it currently is not taking away from the gameplay, but let's be honest, after seeing her in smash bros it's likely that the next game will have some part where you play as ZSS. And there's not really a good reason for that. It's hard to get the same feeling that amazing games like Super and Prime give you when you can't imagine yourself in the game because you constantly are seeing her taking off the suit."
Metroid,334s01,ozzAR0th,2,Sun Apr 19 19:13:18 2015 UTC,"No, that's an unfounded concern and jump to conclusions. Am I going to see Lucina in the next FE game because they added her to Smash? No. Because that's not how it works."
Metroid,334s01,LSD001,-1,Sun Apr 19 19:15:58 2015 UTC,"Is Nintendo more likely to not make a metroid game because it's not popular? Yes. Is Nintendo going to do what will get them the most money from metroid at this point? Yes. Does Nintendo think people want zero suit Samus more? After other m and how popular ZSS is, probably. I think that logically they will put more ZSS in the next metroid game because ZSS is popular and they want to sell this series that is dead to them as much as possible."
Metroid,334s01,ozzAR0th,-2,Sun Apr 19 19:58:33 2015 UTC,"I've always thought that both the endings and the more recent incarnations of the Zero Suit have been harmful to the games overall. Like the idea that a reward for performing well in the game is seeing Samus half naked doesn't gel well with me, especially when she's the character I've just been using for the entire game, attempting to relate to and putting my own personality into hers.  I'd like to see the whole bikini/zero suit thing removed or at least updated to fit the universe and the character of Samus. She's a military trained, genetically engineered bounty hunter badass, not a swimsuit model."
Metroid,334s01,Apnoiac,8,Sun Apr 19 15:48:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if everyone thinks the reward is to see her naked, but rather to see what she looks like under the mask. It's mysterious. The same way it's such a big deal with superheroes or master chief from halo. And you said she military trained and genetically altered? Sounds like she would probably be very physical attractive and therefore attractive to many. Her beauty isn't a hindrance really, it's more of a symbol of power, saying that she is at the top of her game in every way. She still is a hunter badass, regardless of how physically fit and attractive she is or isn't."
Metroid,334s01,ozzAR0th,-3,Sun Apr 19 16:37:34 2015 UTC,Then why do you see more and more of her skin as higher rewards? Why not stop at her with the helmet off? It's obviously to appeal to the average male gamer. And yeah big tits and wide hips are OBVIOUSLY to show us that she's strong in every fashion.
Metroid,334s01,ThreeTwenty320,1 point,Sun Apr 19 16:42:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's necessary, but regardless, seeing her at the end doesn't take away from the gameplay."
Metroid,334s01,ThreeTwenty320,3,Sun Apr 19 19:08:29 2015 UTC,The zero suit I think is needed for the power suit to work kind of like a transfer medium between her body and the suit controls
Metroid,334s01,ThreeTwenty320,-3,Sun Apr 19 16:00:00 2015 UTC,This does not excuse it's design. How it is explained after the fact within the canon is a poor excuse for why it is so sexually designed. And the fact that the Zero Suit has only been in one 2D Metroid game so far really illustrates how unnecessary it is.

Metroid,32wjac,GuBrynS,2,Fri Apr 17 15:54:39 2015 UTC,"The purple, pink, and white are beautiful."
Metroid,32wjac,sheggy123,2,Fri Apr 17 18:51:51 2015 UTC,Definitely my favorite color scheme out of the three. It looks beautiful.
Metroid,32wjac,xwatchmanx,3,Fri Apr 17 23:00:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this was intentional, but the middle one looks like a cross between the varia suit and the fusion suit. I think it would be an awesome design for a game that takes place after Metroid Fusion. I didn't much like the fusion suit in the game when it had the varia and ""omega"" colors."
Metroid,32wjac,xwatchmanx,5,Fri Apr 17 15:36:12 2015 UTC,"Was actually quite intentional. I feel like the fusion suit had missed some potential to really stand out, so I tried making some bio-'tech variant that could bridge that gap :)"
Metroid,32wjac,ionyx,3,Fri Apr 17 15:48:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not at all surprised. :) Great job!  While we're at it, would you mind sharing your inspiration for the other two suits? I'm getting a light suit vibe from the one on the left, and a very obvious gravity suit vibe from the one on the right."
Metroid,32wjac,happy_pie,3,Fri Apr 17 16:53:31 2015 UTC,"I love 1 and 3, 2 I don't like the colour but the design is cool. I think it would look good in an orange similar to the Varia suit."
Metroid,32wjac,PhazonZim,3,Fri Apr 17 19:31:44 2015 UTC,"I love everything about the middle and right except for the shoulder pads. The one in the left is my favorite and I don't think this is intentional, but it looks a lot like summoned skull from yugioh."
Metroid,32wjac,JaxnRdS,3,Fri Apr 17 20:45:50 2015 UTC,"I think they look really amazing, but the shoulders are a bit too large imo."
Metroid,32wjac,BigSmashy,2,Fri Apr 17 21:43:37 2015 UTC,"They remind me of The Guyver a bit. I do like them overall.  I think the last one has a bit of wasted potential to it. The pauldrons don't match the shapes in the rest of the design, they're more organic looking to me. The first two have a cool, distinct chestplate and the third's doesn't stand out against the rest of the suit. It might be worth a try to make it have a bit more character to it.  Overall the first one is my fave. The colours on it are really neat."
Metroid,32wjac,that_dude_you_know,2,Fri Apr 17 11:24:38 2015 UTC,"I really like the left one, great job!"
Metroid,32wjac,Duffman983,2,Fri Apr 17 12:40:13 2015 UTC,Very nice! Love the colouring.  Middle one is my favourite by far. Looks like you've earned yourself a watcher on DA!
Metroid,32wjac,Vornim,2,Fri Apr 17 12:50:26 2015 UTC,The color palette of the 3rd one is nice. I love the purple/blue/red. How would that one look with the standard green visor?  Hnng.
Metroid,32wjac,ForneverStar,2,Fri Apr 17 13:07:20 2015 UTC,Middle one is sick !! Pure phazon suit?? Or metroid suit? Anyhow nice work
Metroid,32wjac,GingerBreadNAM,2,Fri Apr 17 13:09:20 2015 UTC,"If these were included in a new game, I could see them using them going right to left; Default, then the Heat Suit, then a Light Suit.  Idk what I'm saying, hah. These are all great! I would love to see the future possible devs of a new game to be able to see and use these!"
Metroid,32wjac,UboaNoticedYou,2,Fri Apr 17 13:27:37 2015 UTC,I love the one on the left
Metroid,32wjac,markandspark,2,Fri Apr 17 14:04:59 2015 UTC,"The middle one is really interesting, though they're all awesome. The second especially looks like a new Fusion-Suit variation."
Metroid,32wjac,notrichardlinklater,2,Fri Apr 17 15:03:15 2015 UTC,"So have you applied at Retro yet?  Seriously, these are amazing! I love power suit designs that really capture the alien feel that they should. Great color choices too, I really like the purple on white!"
Metroid,32wjac,Darkbane23,6,Fri Apr 17 16:07:58 2015 UTC,"I'm actually about to! I was just bulking up my portfolio a bit beforehand. Honestly, working there is the dream."
Metroid,32wjac,JeremyFitzgerald,4,Fri Apr 17 16:33:36 2015 UTC,"Good luck! And if you get in, perhaps mention that a new metroid game would be cool?"
Metroid,32wjac,LotoSage,2,Fri Apr 17 23:08:08 2015 UTC,"Middle one looks like some high-tech bug/parasite would take control over Samus, her suit and corrupt them. Great."
Metroid,32wjac,Nintendan95,2,Fri Apr 17 17:36:47 2015 UTC,"These are all fantastic, the left being my favourite. I really appreciate the shoulder design on each of them. Do you have names for them? The left gives me an icy vibe(probably the deep purple reminding me of finding the Gravity Suit underwater in Phendrana Drifts in Prime), and thus I want to call it the Aurora Suit."
Metroid,32wjac,2CATteam,2,Fri Apr 17 17:54:35 2015 UTC,"Nice, the middle one looks organic and mushroomy. Pretty cool."
Metroid,32wjac,Syncs,2,Fri Apr 17 17:57:09 2015 UTC,The first one is my favourite. They're all awesome.
Metroid,32wjac,Plinkman,2,Fri Apr 17 21:48:02 2015 UTC,I saw someone link these on my Twitter the other day. I really like the bulk of the first one. She looks a lot more empowering than the standard Varia suit. The second is probably my favourite though. It's just really different and unique compared to most other suit designs and it flows really nicely too. Doesn't look out of place yet it's still really different. The sharp parts at the top of the shoulders give it some awesome little flare.
Metroid,32wjac,KingBroly,4,Fri Apr 17 10:43:57 2015 UTC,"It came up on your Twitter? Sweet :) Heah I think the first one is probably my favourite too, I had designed the second one to look more like a viable upgrade on the fusion suit too. It was certainly hard to design something unique whilst fitting into the Samus design silhouette, but I'm really glad you like them!"
Metroid,32wjac,twinfyre,1 point,Fri Apr 17 12:53:11 2015 UTC,These are probably the best suits I've ever seen on Samus. They all look so powerful and imposing! I love it!
Metroid,32wjac,sniktawekim,1 point,Fri Apr 17 12:15:36 2015 UTC,"I like all of them! Not a huge fan of the color scheme of the first, at first glance anyway, but the overall designs are awesome!   The middle one is obviously the most striking, I definitely got Fusion vibes from it before I even read your description. Third one seems to be getting the least attention, but it feels a lot like a post-fusion gravity suit or something. Really sleek and different without separating TOO much from the source material!   Great work!"
Metroid,32yt6n,Hopper2004,5,Fri Apr 17 21:08:34 2015 UTC,1st. 100%
Metroid,32yt6n,Chaotix23,5,Fri Apr 17 21:19:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input! Would you say the text looks better on the bottom?

Metroid,32yt6n,Zakaro,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:27:57 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thank you! To you like the text on the top, or bottom?"
Metroid,32yt6n,Zakaro,2,Sat Apr 18 22:15:04 2015 UTC,Bottom.
Metroid,32yt6n,Zakaro,3,Sun Apr 19 21:13:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the great comments and advice guys, it's super useful!  Here's the design I have so far. (with corrected colors)   A few more questions before I send it in:    Should the text be on the top or bottom?  Should the text have two lines (like it is now), or should it all be on one line? Two lines stretches the design out more than I like, but having only one looses the emphasis on ""Morph Baller."""
Metroid,32yt6n,Zakaro,1 point,Sat Apr 18 22:23:03 2015 UTC,Perhaps try putting 'I'm a' above the Morph Ball and the 'Morph Baller' below? Could be an interesting option.  But overall I think on the bottom is better.
Metroid,32yt6n,platinumwater,1 point,Sun Apr 19 00:51:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, that was the original intent. But I thought it made the ""I'm a"" look isolated and weird.   But what do YOU think?"
Metroid,32yt6n,clonetrooper250,2,Sun Apr 19 07:53:15 2015 UTC,"It does make it look a little isolated, true, though I think it's still pretty good. Either that or text on the bottom would be my picks, so I'd say go with your gut on that one. :P"
Metroid,32yt6n,sniktawekim,1 point,Sun Apr 19 16:39:34 2015 UTC,"Haha, thanks a lot for the help!"
Metroid,32yt6n,TehEefan,2,Sun Apr 19 19:39:37 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that the colors are slightly off because of how T-Shirt printers print color. The colors would look better and brighter on a shirt.
Metroid,32yt6n,TehEefan,2,Fri Apr 17 21:09:14 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that it would be cool if the letters wrapped around the  ball, but if I can only choose one than 1. gets my pick. 2. is a close second, I don't particularly like the text on the ball."
Metroid,32yt6n,starchase,2,Fri Apr 17 22:57:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought the text on the ball would center the whole design, but it ended up ending up looking terrible. Thank you for the input!!  After seeing this, I thought text around the ball would look great too, but after trying it out, it made it look weird, and with the font it was hard to read."
Metroid,32yt6n,valon800,2,Sat Apr 18 22:18:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that font is best going in lines. :P If it was different, then wrapping around would work better."
Metroid,32w2zh,CptScruffles,5,Fri Apr 17 04:47:09 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, want. I'm hoping that's on Amazon or somewhere."
Metroid,32w2zh,Kabuthunk,2,Fri Apr 17 05:17:12 2015 UTC,"You can find Samus online here for $24.99. Originally $12.99 if purchased in a retail store like Target, but it's really hard to actually find one.   You can also find a bad ass Metroid figure here for $29.99. This retails for $14.99, but again, you'd be hard pressed to find one anywhere."

A LONG way to go and with all the heat nintendo is bringing down on this stuff I don't know if it's worth it to continue (likely will if I just don't release it) but thought it would be a fun project and something I've always wanted to do/play :)"
Metroid,32tdwl,PhazonZim,2,Thu Apr 16 15:48:12 2015 UTC,Awesome stuff!  Couldn't you just. . . change things up enough to make it less of a copy?  A bounty hunter named Frank who can crawl but can't morph into a ball?
Metroid,32tdwl,byscuit,4,Thu Apr 16 19:22:56 2015 UTC,Sure :) Doing this was killing two birds with one stone; Learning the unreal engine to make my own game and also doing for fun :)

The guy literally tries to RAPE you. He pulls out his hard ""prick"" thing and grabs you and humps and penetrates you. So disturbing. I fucking love it!"
Metroid,32w82k,joecb91,2,Fri Apr 17 22:02:53 2015 UTC,That was the only part that really freaked me out.  Now Nightmare and any time you would wind up being chased by the SA-X in Fusion.... Playing through Fusion the first time I did not handle that well.
Metroid,32w82k,dbutlerjr,3,Sat Apr 18 22:53:50 2015 UTC,"The music in Ridley's Lair (Lower Norfair) is very intense and the music in Meridia is kind of creepy, particularly in the Quicksand area.  In the original Metroid/Zero Mission, the music in Kraid's Lair is especially creepy.  I think that it's the music that drives the ""atmosphere"" in the game(s) IMHO."
Metroid,32w82k,GingeousC,1 point,Sat Apr 18 15:17:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Kraid music is creepy at all; I think it's awesome, maybe even pretty in spots (like right before the music loops where the higher piano-y sounding notes play). It has a really cool melody."

Metroid,32w82k,GingeousC,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:54:02 2015 UTC,"Fusion and Prime are the only Metroid games that ever scared me.   Fusion, because the SA-X. I don't think I have to say anything more.   Prime, because of the underwater segments before you get the Gravity Suit. You feel helpless and vulnerable, and the limited visibility only adds to that feeling. Also, something about those Jelzaps sucking you in always put me off."
Metroid,32vk5k,Taekwonbot,16,Fri Apr 17 01:49:53 2015 UTC,"She's (most likely) right handed. Guns are nearly always shot with your dominant hand, and when in her zero suit, she does everything right-handedly. However, she's at least partially ambidextrous due to how often she uses her left hand for everything."
Metroid,32vk5k,H0rrible,7,Fri Apr 17 02:30:25 2015 UTC,"Guns are nearly always shot with your dominant hand   It's technically supposed to be dominant eye, being right handed, but shooting left handed because you're left eye dominant.  Technically."
Metroid,32vk5k,Elusive2000,6,Fri Apr 17 18:36:48 2015 UTC,"Naturally right-handed, but has adapted to be able to capably use her left hand for most things (i.e. ambidextrous).  As said earlier, guns are nearly always shot with your dominant hand, and she is seen in her zero suit using her right hand for most things.  Due to her extensive use of her cannon, however, she has trained herself to use her left hand for many tasks."
Metroid,32vk5k,boomwikity,6,Fri Apr 17 05:45:47 2015 UTC,Left probably. I wouldn't want my dominant hand inside a gun all the time.

Metroid,32vk5k,Jammintk,2,Sat Apr 18 02:18:32 2015 UTC,"if she can phase out her whole suit, then surely she can phase out separate parts of it"
Metroid,32vk5k,SamusAranX,7,Sat Apr 18 03:00:26 2015 UTC,Probably ambidextrous.
Metroid,32vk5k,Wombo194,3,Fri Apr 17 01:51:35 2015 UTC,"Left. She does almost everything with her left hand, it's not hard to assume that it's probably her dominate hand. Could you function with your dominate hand trapped inside of an arm cannon?"
Metroid,32vk5k,SpaceWarriorSamus-,9,Fri Apr 17 01:50:59 2015 UTC,Could you shoot a gun accurately with your non-dominant hand?
Metroid,32vk5k,joe_copp,3,Fri Apr 17 02:31:56 2015 UTC,Is it a cop-out if you truly believe and want to relate to the character some more? I want to say she is ambidextrous.
Metroid,32vk5k,platinumwater,6,Sat Apr 18 00:34:23 2015 UTC,I'm going to play it safe and say ambidextrous.
Metroid,32vk5k,XXXCheckmate,3,Fri Apr 17 01:50:53 2015 UTC,"That's no fun, you must choose :-) and give a reasoning why."
Metroid,32vk5k,XXXCheckmate,8,Fri Apr 17 01:54:05 2015 UTC,Right-handed because that's the hand she holds her gun with.
Metroid,32vk5k,heckler82,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:56:08 2015 UTC,"But you could argue ambidextrous. She has her blaster on her right hand, and I'm pretty sure she holds her stun pistol in her right hand in zero mission. Then she uses her left for grabbing ledges and pulling."
Metroid,32vk5k,slade2501,2,Fri Apr 17 06:54:15 2015 UTC,"well, I immagine that she is right handed as most people shoot one handed with their dominant hand.  However, I believe that she has extensive training in teh use of her left hand due to the arm cannon on her right.  its like signing your name left handed, if you practice enough, you get good at it."
Metroid,32vk5k,pm_your_huge_chode,1 point,Fri Apr 17 11:38:47 2015 UTC,I'm going to say left handed because Samus uses her left hand to do stuff and it appears from the prime trilogy that she uses it to hold/guide the arm cannon.
Metroid,32vk5k,PolioKitty,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:46:19 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go with left handed on this one. While she does use her right hand for shooting (which requires an equal amount of effort for every shot), her left hand is reserved for grappling (requiring a variable amount of force to pull off), leading me to believe her left hand is stronger.  This is based off of her three appearances in Prime, rather than in Super Metroid or Other M (but I mean, OM never happened so it's 3-1)."
Metroid,32vk5k,ladyderpette,1 point,Fri Apr 17 05:02:57 2015 UTC,"Gonna add my vote to the left-handers. It makes more sense to keep her left hand free if it's her dominant hand. Using an arm-cannon is a lot different from, say, holding a rifle. It's a part of her, so I'd assume aiming as a whole is different. Samus never struck me as a sharpshooter anyway. She's not big on finesse. :P"
Metroid,32vk5k,SarcasticRidley,1 point,Fri Apr 17 05:36:02 2015 UTC,"I'm left handed, but shoot with my right.  Samus' cannon is on her right hand, but if she were right dominant, that would mean her less dominant hand is used for everything else.  From what I've seen in the Prime games and others, she does a lot of typing and grabbing things with her left hand. If she weren't dominant with that hand, it would likely be slower.  I'd go with left handed, or ambidextrous, honestly. She's part Chozo, so who knows."

Metroid,32vk5k,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Apr 18 05:06:18 2015 UTC,"Cross-dominance:       Cross-dominance, also known as mixed-handedness, mixed dominance, or increased hand efficiency, is a motor skill manifestation where a person favors one hand for some tasks and the other hand for others. For example, a cross-dominant person might write with the left hand but throw primarily with the right. Ambidexterity is a well-known but rare variant of cross-dominance, but cross-dominant people may also be left or right-handed rather than ambidextrous.  It can also refer to mixed laterality, which refers to a person favoring eyes, ears, feet, or hands on one side of the body. A person who is cross-dominant can also be stronger on the opposite side of the body that they favor; for example, a right-handed person can be stronger on the left side. Cross-dominance can often be a problem when shooting or in activities that require aim, although athletes can still achieve success in sports that require accuracy, like passing in American football and shooting in basketball. [citation needed]  ""Overall, being mixed handed seems to result in better performance than being strongly handed for sports such as basketball, ice hockey, and field hockey. What these sports have in common is that they require active body movements and also an ability to respond to either side. The situation is reversed for racquet sports such as tennis. Individuals with crossed hand-eye preference seem to be much better at gymnastics, running, and basketball because of the way in which congruent and crossed sided individuals position their bodies.""

Metroid,32vrxo,RHB1027,3,Fri Apr 17 02:58:40 2015 UTC,"The hardest thing for me was the map screen.  In all 3 games.  Seriously, a wireframe 2d representation of a 3d space without any shading or whatnot messes with my head.  Sometimes it looks like i'm rotating the map and looking at it from below, which I know isn't right but my head forces me into that perspective.  I spend an inordinate amount of time on the map screens gouging my eyes out.  Other than that though I didn't find mp2 to be too terribly difficult, except for the dark world part right before the boost guardian, and that fight in general was really frustrating since you don't have any safe spots nearby, iirc.  The difficulty of Dark Aether is greatly mitigated by later suit upgrades however, no spoilers though.  edit: I had the original version, sometimes the direction you're supposed to go isn't too clear, and maybe I'm forgetting some boss battles, but it didn't seem too terribly difficult, not to the point where you absolutely need to 100% the items as you go, I don't even think I got 100% on mp2 yet."
Metroid,32vrxo,daman4567,2,Fri Apr 17 03:16:15 2015 UTC,"That's funny, I have been having a hard time with the map screen in MP2 as well. It seems a little different than MP1; maybe smaller (at least the little corner view while playing)."
Metroid,32vrxo,metroidman388,2,Fri Apr 17 03:56:37 2015 UTC,"It's harder than MP1, but how much harder depends on which version you're playing.  If you're on the original NTSC GC version, you'll have the hardest possible experience.  A few bosses (I won't name names) were made easier for subsequent releases of the game."
Metroid,32vrxo,nintendobutt,2,Fri Apr 17 03:01:18 2015 UTC,However the energy drain of the Dark World certainly makes the game difficult. But it makes it challenging and something to pay attention to while playing. It almost feels like the moon from Majora's Mask.

It was cool to see her when she was young and still learning how things worked (especially when they abandon Adam's brother, I thought that was a great scene where she has to learn that even with her power you can't save everyone and do everything without sacrifice), but that section of dialogue was so incredibly painful."

Metroid,32t207,MonochromeTyrant,6,Thu Apr 16 17:56:30 2015 UTC,How should we portray our selfless heroine? Well lets have a scene where she disrespects her commanding officer in an immature and childish way that makes no sense and looks really stupid. Now if you'll excuse me I need to go continue smacking my forehead with a shovel.
Metroid,32t207,urbestfriend9000,1 point,Thu Apr 16 22:59:33 2015 UTC,"Well they were purposely trying to show a contrast between her when she was young and her as we know her now. Good idea as I said, but that scene was terribly executed."
Metroid,32t207,Anggul,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:00:45 2015 UTC,"I felt it was more to emphasize her relationship with Adam, more than anything. She even mentions and does it upon receiving orders from Adam on the Bottle Ship. All in all, it was a very sour note."
Metroid,32t207,MonochromeTyrant,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:08:00 2015 UTC,"I feel like it turned over time from a sign of rebellion, to a sign of respect and adoration. Even though Samus grew up, it was something she still did to show her long bond to Adam. Like when Adam said ""Any objections, Lady?"", it eventually went from him signaling out Samus and sort of an insult since she tended to always disobey, but then just became their own thing."
Metroid,32t207,Lucienofthelight,1 point,Fri Apr 17 23:32:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, especially as again, her relationship with Adam was a good idea except for that terribly executed section.  People say Other M is terrible. Nay, that scene is terrible and stuck in everyone's minds as the focal point of the game because of how bad it was.  The premise was good. Show her in her youth, impetuous and believing she could do anything because she was different, and contrast it to the older, more experienced Samus we've been playing as throughout the games. Show her relationship with Adam as a commander and pseudo-family after she had lost her parents and left her Chozo ones.  I like Adam, he plays an interesting role. He clearly wants to treat Samus specially to some degree, but knows that he can't because that wouldn't teach her or anyone else anything. She might not have turned from the impetuous and unsure youth into the calm, measured woman that we know. Exloring that was such a good idea. People who say all of his scenes were sexist rubbish clearly just missed the point, they were nothing to do with gender at all. Samus could be male and those scenes would have played out the same.  Sadly that accursed scene detracted from what was a great concept."
Metroid,32t207,Anggul,5,Thu Apr 16 22:18:11 2015 UTC,"Eh, sorry, but all of Other M's plot is a steaming pile -- and it wasn't just the execution. Adam and Samus' relationship, throughout the entire game, comes off as some twisted form of father/daughter abuse. And I'm not just basing it off that particular scene, I'm basing it off their interactions throughout the entire game."
Metroid,32t207,MonochromeTyrant,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:10:52 2015 UTC,"He just treated her like he treated every other person under his orders. He was a commanding officer who she chose to follow for the ease of the mission, knowing she didn't have to. It could have been any officer. He spent most of the game directing from the command centre. There is obvious tension because of their past. As I said, he clearly wants to give her special treatment but knows that he can't, so comes across a tad more awkwardly when talking to her because he's torn. As the story explains, he puts his duties ahead of his personal desires. He wasn't acting abusively at all, that's just an over-reaction by people who hated seeing her listening to orders from anyone, when she only chose to do so because it would make things run more smoothly and maintain relations with the Federation. She may be a lone hunter, but she's on the side of the Federation most of the time, she isn't going to piss them off and blow up chunks of their ship for no reason.  Don't bother mentioning the daft restrictions on non-explosives like grapple beam and hazard shielding, that was a gameplay mechanic done in a silly way."
Metroid,32t207,Anggul,1 point,Fri Apr 17 06:39:48 2015 UTC,"This and this are past summarizations of my feelings on the matter. And I fail to even touch on the scene where he shoots her. Sorry, but I just don't see the plot the same way you do."
Metroid,32t207,MonochromeTyrant,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:19:12 2015 UTC,"Yup, pretty much what I thought it would say. The usual.  The gear restriction was a gameplay mechanic. It had nothing to do with his personality or being abusive, it was for gameplay so you didn't just start with everything. Especially the varia part, which is infamously daft and obviously just for gameplay.  Also yes she listened to the guy telling her not to blow up the place they're trying to investigate. That makes sense. She would have to be a moron to start blowing the place up."

I'm keeping my eyes on this thread for developments: http://smashboards.com/threads/samus-1-06-patch-notes.399037/  So far the 100% confirmed changes are the different properties to the forward tilt, and the faster missiles AFAIK.  There's a least one person in that thread who mentioned they'd be doing some side by side testing of pre-patch vs post-patch data.  From my own limited playing, CS might take longer to charge by a tiny bit.  I haven't noticed changes to down throw.  I think Nair is somewhat faster.  It used to hit on Frame 8, but it feels like it might be sooner now.  It seems easier to land, and even to connect with the secondary hit."

I haven't noticed changes to uptilt and downtilt, and I never paid too much attention to recoil time on Charge shot pre-patch.  The bomb damage is definitely the same it's always been.  4-5% on the edge of the explosion, and 9% on a perfectly lined up bomb.  Dropping bombs from full jump height and following up with missile shield pressure seems to reliably secure the 9% hit if the opponent isn't paying attention.  The reddit thread from the video seems to also be updated, with a lot of the speculated changes being deconfirmed:  http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/32oh35/super_smash_bros_4_v106_patch_notes_compilation/"

I just went back and checked the Charge Shot and there is a significant difference in recoil, even in the air.

Metroid,32ltks,Wei_Tzu,16,Tue Apr 14 20:41:13 2015 UTC,"I actually have no issue with Magmoor being a glorified transit hub.  It makes the world as a whole feel more diverse and less ""gamey"" compared to having a boss per world.  From a game design standpoint, it's a great way to gate off everything that isn't Tallon Overworld and Chozo Ruins through a familiar game upgrade.  It also becomes useful for opening up shortcuts as the game progresses.  Making Magmoor bigger and including a boss would be interesting to see, but runs the risk of making backtracking more tedious."
Metroid,32ltks,metroidman388,2,Tue Apr 14 22:55:48 2015 UTC,"I would argue that Magmoor is already tedious for backtracking. Echoes gets around this by making the Temple Grounds very fast for going through to another area, and opening up pathways between each of the three major areas. Corruption avoids this by allowing the ship to land at multiple points on every planet."
Metroid,32ltks,Jammintk,1 point,Wed Apr 15 00:33:55 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I can only imagine magmoor becoming even more tedious if the map were larger unless some major restructuring in the form of new elevators were added.  IIRC half the time you need to go through magmoor to get someplace else you don't have to walk through the entire stretch.  Temple Grounds handled it better, but it was very confusing for me my first time through.  I had issues keeping track of which of the 3 elevators would take me down to which part of temple grounds, but I never got lost to that same extent in Magmoor."

You guys complain about backtracking in echoes, linearity in fusion, and to many ""dudes"" in prime 3. The games are already finished. We don't need to nitpick anymore. Nintendo isn't going to go back and fix those problems, and new fans aren't going to take your little personal issues into consideration when they play the games. So why are we being so immature about all of this? So we can rank the games like a smash bros tier list? To prove eachother wrong? Personal preference is almost everything in the entertainment industry. Some might hate backtracking, others might think it adds to the atmosphere. Some might hate the other bounty hunters, others might think they add personality to the game.  It's childish. And I think it's time we all grew up."

All I offered was a criticism on this one aspect of the game, stating that I see it as a flaw, however minor it may be. If all we're expected to do is nothing but sharing whatever cool new thing we come across here, then I must say I'm rather disappointed by that.

As far as Ridley goes though; I honestly don't know if he would have worked in a Metroid like this. I know he is Samus's Arch-Rival and he's existed as a boss in most Metroid games, but the game was built and based around Dark Samus and the Ing; Space pirates were there, but they played a very minor role in the grand scheme of things whereas they were one of the main driving forces in 1 and 3; Ridley would have been harder to sell in MP2 than in other Metroids unless he was a early Agon Wastes boss, but that wouldn't have worked seeing as that's just the first area (would have severely limited battle mechanics)  Maybe I'm biased because I played Prime 2 first, but I prefer to believe that it aided me in seeing Prime 2 in a light without the ""Original Prime, Best Prime ever, nothing can top it or come close"" light (like a lot of hardcore reviewers have)"

I actually was one of those who listed my frustrations a while back here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/2f364l/frustration_with_echoes_does_anyone_agree_with_me/  Interestingly, I find that the things that some people love about it (the atmosphere, the light/dark dichotomy, the difficult bosses) are the very things that frustrate others.   I do resent being told I'm blind and a sheep. We're all entitled to our opinions, here."
Metroid,32leca,kindarilwraja,-1,Tue Apr 14 23:03:09 2015 UTC,"I get it  I'm the type of guy that likes playing Dark Souls, so... Yeah; that should explain alot  Also, that line was for people who claimed that 2 was the weakest in the series (it's not, that's Prime 3)"
Metroid,32leca,kindarilwraja,2,Tue Apr 14 23:21:30 2015 UTC,"... then that line was for me because I do think Echoes was the weakest in the series in many respects. Prime was a quantum leap forward. Corruption was also a leap insofar as it integrated motion controls and a more fleshed out universe, though I'll hardly deny that the more linear-ish story and interactivity with NPCs was a huge change (and not necessarily a positive one) for the Metroid series. Echoes didn't really push anything forward. It was a good follow-up to Prime, but it didn't add anything new except perhaps the introduction of additional alien races akin to the Chozo (i.e., the Luminoth). And then there's the various gripes I already noted.  This isn't to say that Echoes was bad. It's not. It's a solid game. You could say it's the strongest in the trilogy for difficulty and a dark feel to it, but those aren't what I look for. Being a Dark Souls fan, you apparently do. I just enjoy the other two much more."
Metroid,32leca,GingeousC,0,Wed Apr 15 00:56:09 2015 UTC,"I guess this is where we widely disagree then.  In my opinion; there was already a precedence that Prime 1 and 2 fulfilled that Prime 3 missed the mark completely on. If Metroid Prime 1 is an S-Tier game, then Metroid Prime 3 has to come in dead ""Average"" C-Tier for how it lived up to the series. (MP2 varies widely depending on who you ask, but I say it's also S-Tier)  The controls and the distinct Prime style of game was made for the GameCube controller, and that was something no amount of motion controls and waggling could fix: the Wii-motion controls, while innovative at the time, have really begun to age poorly and the poor execution of the motion sense technology has done more than its fair share at frustrating hardened players (IE, Grapple Beam bullsh*t); there is a reason people aren't flocking to buy a Trilogy but are still willing to experience the originals in their context on the GameCube.  Prime 3, with its inclusion of a supporting cast and commanding officers didn't function as a Prime game, and barely functioned as a Metroid game; Samus is a Bounty Hunter not a marine: since when has she fallen in line and taken distinct orders (besides Other M; that game was terrible). The Bloom lighting.. Don't even get me started. It's a classic ""Don't fix what's not broken"" scenario, and why I view the second Prime installment as nothing short as just a near masterpiece as the Original. It wasn't about innovation; the series was about providing a 3D experience  Prime 3 lacked the distinct Metroid (lonely, dark, different suits, vastly wide exploreable wilderness/caverns) AND Prime style (multiple beams, multiple visors, engrossing boss battles). It was a good Metroid game, and one I happily revisit every so often, but to call it a Prime game in anything other than Plot and Namesake is a huge disservice to the Series. That's not to say it's a bad game; far from it: it's still miles ahead of the average IP, and still a fairly entertaining game to play.  But at this point, I've beaten the dead horse long enough: neither one of us will be changing their minds anytime soon, so we can just agree to disagree. Who knows; maybe in my subsequent playthroughs something will change, something will click and I'll realize the hidden genius behind the game. For now though; I have to hold to my position that it's the weakest in the series."
Metroid,32leca,SamusAranX,1 point,Wed Apr 15 03:02:07 2015 UTC,"I hardly said there was genius in MP3. Innovative leap in some ways? Yes. Genius? No. (The title of genius goes only to Prime, I think.) As I said, the narrative change wasn't necessarily a positive one, and the breaking up of the universe into pieces took away from the exploration feel that, as you said, seems integral to the Metroid universe. I also found the lack of different beams a slight disappointment, but realized that it would have been exceedingly difficult to make beam changes fluid on the Wii-mote. I'd be willing to bet that Retro fully intended to have separate beams but couldn't figure out a way to do so without being too awkward and so integrated them all into one cannon (much like most 2D Metroids, I might add). As for multiple visors, I love sniping the pirate commandos, so no issue for me here, but that's a side issue. All this to say, you're not going to find hidden genius in the game with subsequent play-throughs.  I would argue that calling the motion controls innovative in one breath and then poor in the next isn't entirely fair, particularly when your first argument is that they aged poorly. For the time and the limitations of the technology they had to work with, they were excellent. Others have done better since? Sure, but the technology has changed as well. You can't call Atari 2600 Adventure terrible on the basis of having played Dark Souls or even Dragon Warrior 1. For the time, it was quite the accomplishment. Retro pulled off some of the best motion controls for any Wii game of that style.   I'm really hearing two things from you * first, you're not arguing so much that Echoes is spectacular as much as Corruption ain't all that. I think the main distinction is the difference in atmosphere and narrative, and we've agreed that we look for very different things in atmosphere. * second, you vastly prefer the Gamecube controls over the Wii controls, and that, too, is a matter of preference. I don't necessarily prefer one over the other, personally. They're just different to me, but you obviously like the original better.  In the end, you're right. We're not going to convince each other one way or the other, which is fine. I think we're both basing a lot of our opinions on the feel of the games, and Echoes and Corruption had drastically different feels to them. We each just prefer one over the other."
Metroid,32leca,CKZeni,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:52:01 2015 UTC,"I do have to give you that Metroid Prime 3 had above average motion controls looking back in Hindsight; there are games that subject players to far more terrible abuse. Really the only frustrating thing was the grapple mechanic, everything else was rather fluid and organic.  Shoot, now I want to go play Metroid Prime 3 !haha"
Metroid,32leca,SpicySpicySpice,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:05:15 2015 UTC,Heh. You still won't find anything genius in it. But it's still fun.
Metroid,32leca,JeremyFitzgerald,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:55:40 2015 UTC,"I think Prime 3 still stands up as a Prime game. Similar to how Fusion took the 2D Metroid experience and streamlined it (very successfully, in my opinion), Prime 3 took the 3D Metroid experience and streamlined it. I'm not sure if I had any ""where the fuck do I go"" moments in Prime 3, and I certainly had a couple in Primes 1 and 2. I think this is indicative of good design.  However, that design choice comes with a price: less room for exploration. The hopping between planets part, which I assume was supposed to have made the game feel bigger, actually made it feel smaller for me, because I felt like I was playing in a couple mini-areas rather than one big inter-connected one. I'm not sure if other people feel the same, and it's hard to describe.  I will concede that I hated the direction in Prime 3. In Prime 1 you crash on an alien world knowing nothing about it and slowly uncover for yourself everything that's going on. It felt fluid and organic; you were exploring not because you were told to but because you wanted the rewards it brought. Even the hint system, which I think was brilliantly designed, maintained this, because it never told you to go somewhere (or how to get there), only that ""blah blah blah detected here"", which maintains this type of exploration. And then Prime 3 completely kills it by literally ordering you around. It didn't say ""seismic disturbance detected"" (which makes you curious and want to see what's going on); instead it said ""go here and push this switch"" (which makes you feel like you're just running errands).  To comment on your point about beams and visors, I don't think that inherently takes away from the experience. As I'm sure you'll remember, all the 2D Metroids had stacking beam systems, and it didn't inhibit the gameplay at all. Using a stacking beam system took out unnecessary complexity, and I liked it. It felt old-school. I think the visors were poorly used, though. Specifically the X-ray visor: it was used for maybe ten minutes towards the end of the game, and it never had another use. Metroid is supposed to be about getting items that are more than just for puzzles (e.g. the plasma beam opens new doors and is a useful weapon, and the x-ray visor just lets you see through phazite in one part of the game).  All in all, I think Prime 3 wasn't as good as Prime 1, but I'm not sure if it's better than Prime 2 or not. They both had different problems. And sorry for the wall of text. I have a lot to say about the Prime trilogy."
Metroid,32leca,PresidentMagikarp,3,Wed Apr 15 22:34:57 2015 UTC,huh??? where are you seeing the hate?
Metroid,32leca,Weltall548,2,Tue Apr 14 20:37:01 2015 UTC,This for starters really. It was rather recent and received more than a handful of upvotes  And I've seen more than a couple less mainstream review sites slam on it for more than a couple reasons (thereby losing all credibility with me)  I've seen more than a few people on the sub have ill-will towards it aswell
Metroid,32leca,CrinerBoyz,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:42:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly I've seen quite the contrary on this sub. It seems like if you don't share the opinion that it's the best in the trilogy you get blasted. Same with people who dislike Fusion for any reason.  I love all Metroid games. I even love Other M, with all it's flaws. However Prime 2 was my least favorite of the trilogy, and Fusion is simply not as good as Super or Zero Mission. These are obviously just my opinions and it's fine if people disagree, but just because somebody doesn't like Prime 2 as much as the other Prime games doesn't mean they're hating on it. As much as I enjoyed the other 2 more, I've been really wanting to go back and play Prime 2 again because it's been so long. Just waiting for a good opportunity and finding proper optimization on Dolphin, and I'll be there."
Metroid,32leca,LSD001,3,Wed Apr 15 14:16:24 2015 UTC,"I love MP2. Imo it definitely improved upon the first game; I'd only rank Metroid Prime higher because it came first.  In fact, I'd say almost all changes were improvements. Soundtrack is more badass, more exploring, more power ups (Screw Attack ftw!!!), the key quest at the end was more reasonable than the artifact hunt, overall I thought the Dark World was well done. Personally I didn't think the ammo system was so bad, after all it's not so different from missile ammo, but it did render the annihilator basically unusable. As an aside, I think a lot of people didn't realize you get ammo for each beam by using the opposite.  I think the main complaints boil down to the difficulty of the game (esp a few particular bosses). I absolutely rank it higher than Prime 3.  I don't think ""everyone"" hates it though. I think it's just less praised then Prime and doesn't have anything truly novel (over Prime), so people don't bother defending it as much. Also keep in mind, you see a lot of people complain about the frustrations playing through the game; that in itself indicates even they enjoy it enough to be playing this somewhat old game. You don't see that level of complaints about Other M because people just don't give a shit.   By the way I completely agree with your analysis of Corruption."
Metroid,32leca,LSD001,0,Tue Apr 14 22:24:06 2015 UTC,"I'm just a GameCube die-hard, so my GameCube collection far exceeds any of my other consoles. I'll play Prime 1, 2, (and to a slighter extent 3) till I die. I loved the series.  I guess because I enjoyed it so much and had nothing but praise to give it, I was just kind of taken back by the fact that people would even dare say it's worse than the 3rd; that was my main gripe. I have no problem with people saying they liked the first better, because that's my position: really, I can't choose a favorite, because both games are near flawless masterpieces, but inevitably; if they never made Prime1, we wouldn't have Prime 2, so, respect makes me say 1 is better"
Metroid,32leca,Aplombernulp,3,Tue Apr 14 23:36:16 2015 UTC,"The original Prime had a better sense of isolation... though all of the entries do in their own right. Prime's story drove YOU, rather than you driving it per se. You had to scan to get the full story, but there was a lot of mystery behind it either way. It gives you more of a Super Metroid feeling, which is amazing. It's hard to describe."
Metroid,32leca,badgeometry,3,Wed Apr 15 03:42:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't like the ammo system, no. I also didn't like Aether itself. It wasn't as interesting to me as Tallon IV, and I'd attribute that to the gameplay as well as the art direction.  Prime made you feel like you were moving across continents by giving each region a distinct color palette, biome, and atmosphere. You had a green/blue rainforest, a gold/brown desert, red/orange volcanic caverns, a white/blue tundra, and a grey mechanical mine full of blue radioactive fungus. Everything stood out.  In comparison, Echoes wasn't as diverse. Outside of Sanctuary Fortress, the color palette was watered down to various shades of brown, beige, and grey. This was probably done intentionally to help facilitate the sense of melancholy that the plot expresses, but it just made everything looked washed out to me. Sure, the polygon count increased, but it wasn't as eye-catching. Some of the regions felt a bit samey, too, like Temple Grounds and Agon Wastes (i.e., drab, rocky, lifeless hellholes punctuated with the occasional dead plant and piece of machinery).  This made Aether less fun to explore, and the parallel dimension mechanic didn't help. That was a huge missed opportunity. Instead of warping the world into something twisted that would really sell the ""dark side of Aether"" schtick, all they did was paint everything purple and keep the same level design. I felt like I was trudging through the same environments because I was trudging through the same environments, only with different lighting and enemy spawns. Dark Aether felt incredibly lazy for something that was such a major part of the game. The differences between the two Aethers could have been far more pronounced than they wound up being.  Basically, I feel like Prime gave me a world, and Echoes gave me two sandboxes of equal size and shape, just painted differently. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate Echoes. It's an excellent game in its own right, and the boss fights are among the best in the series. It just wasn't as much of an ""experience"" for me as Prime."
Metroid,32leca,cosmichorror0013,2,Wed Apr 15 04:38:31 2015 UTC,"Because people like to exaggerate its ""Flaws"". I personally like 1 the least, althought it's still a 10/10 game."
Metroid,32leca,TurboRex300,2,Tue Apr 14 23:01:56 2015 UTC,"I didn't like Echoes as much as I liked Prime 1 or Corruption. In fact I didn't even get around to beating it until last summer, even though I've had a copy since release.   I didn't mind the ammo system actually. And Dark Aether being harmful wasn't too bad. But I a lot of the game was seemingly made to be tedious. The shortcut-less backtracking. The bland color palette and identical dark/light layout making it easy to get lost and confused. Frustrating boss battles that were often too long (Chykka) or too dependent on a particular skill (Spider Guardian).   I dunno, the game just never really grabbed me like the other two did. I can see the great level designs embedded in the game, but too often the game just stopped dead for me because of the reasons I stated above. Several times I just got bored and quit which is the reason it took so long for me to beat it.   I mean, I still liked it for being Metroid, but I can't see it being among my favorites."

It has some of the best suit designs in all of Metroid (DAT LIGHT SUIT) and some of the most incredible boss fights in the series as well (QUADRAXIS).  That said, I think some people have some justified hangups about the game. The ammo was an odd addition, but didn't bother me all that much. And then there's the boostball guardian. I mean my god, I'd love to find the designer of that fight and give them a stern talking too. I haven't played Prime 2 in sometime, so those are the biggest things I remember from my first play through all those years ago.  But don't let it get to you man.

I loved every single thing about Prime 2, and the ammo was never really an issue (it respawns easily enough).  And then that feeling once you've gotten the Annihilator Beam and the Light Suit is AMAZING. Dark Aether was such an ominous threat, but you become Samus Aran incarnate terrorizer of the darkness and Destroyer of planets."
Metroid,32leca,kingbingbongboo,1 point,Wed Apr 15 04:09:34 2015 UTC,"I'll engage in good faith, as someone who doesn't hate Echoes but finds it maybe the least of the three...  Ammo I don't mind.  The method of regaining ammo can get a little tedious, but once you figure out how to restock, it's more about strategy than frugality.  Luminoth looked good, sure.  Insecty but graceful.  The backtracking in Echoes, though, is a different beast than Prime, as many of the paths feature ""one-way"" doors via portals available in one ""world"" but not the other.  This often results in convoluted pathways that border on circular.  Not a huge part of the gameplay overall, but noticeable.  The difficulty of certain enemies and bosses I don't mind.  Even on initial release, I didn't have much trouble with the bosses.  As to your point about feeling unstoppable while looking for keys, well, Metroid is a series that found a way to offer key/gates that were never that transparent and mechanical.  Instead, they came as weapons (missiles could pummel enemies or open red doors) or locomotive bonuses (inaccessible ledges reached with a space jump).  Echoes has a set of keys for each Dark World, a final set of keys for the Sky Temple, and a bunch of Lore-Gates.  Prime set up this cheaper gameplay with the Artifacts, but Echoes doubles-down.  Dark Samus is imposing on the first play-through, but she's really just a two-dimensional aggressor.  As a recurring threat, sure, but I dunno... she just kinda stands there, sometimes cackles, shloops up all the Phazon.  There's never any hint of inner choice, like you get with the Baby Metroid or even the SA-X (does anyone else pronounce this as ""sax""?).  There are some definite alterations in game design, and a couple of them - like the key/lock issue - is one of them.  One you didn't quite touch on is that Dark Aether, while moody, gets awfully samey awfully fast, thanks to the monochromatic purple/black color scheme, which flattens the atmospheric diversity of the environments, to say nothing of how Dark Aether environments have the same sort of distant chittery-bubbly minimalist soundtrack.  Imagine something as simple as switching up the purple - Torvus gets dark greened, Sanctuary gets redded (sic).  I won't defend all the shortcomings you list for Corruption, in part because it's time for this guy to sip a White Russian and go to bed, but I broadly agree that Corruption feels less lonely and more directed as a gameplay experience - you wonder if Retro had marching orders to make the game more ""accessible"" for the Wii's more casual target audience.  Still, I got a kick out of the motion controls and thought the bounty hunters subplot provided some effective boss battles and a bit of emotion (not much, but a bit).  And yeah, Aether was the only gorgeous place, but, frankly, the only place that wowed me in Echoes was Sanctuary Fortress.  Agon Wastes and Torvus Bog felt like repurposed dour-er Chozo Ruins and Tallon IV.  Anyway, fair thoughts on your end.  I think you're right-on about the overall atmosphere of the game."
Metroid,32leca,Mortimer42,1 point,Wed Apr 15 06:26:57 2015 UTC,"I like Prime 2, but it felt more segmented and artificial to me. Prime 2 had Hub world and worlds 1-3, and you could see clear distinctions. In Prime 1, it felt more organic. There was no clear world 1 or whatever, elevators were scattered all over the place.  But I agree that Prime 2 is more underrated than it needs to be. I played through it recently in the Trilogy and it is better than I remember, especially when I ""got"" the ammo mechanic and used light/dark beams at all times."

I wouldn't exactly recommend Metroid II to someone experiencing the series for the first time, but it's still a pretty decent game regardless.  Fusion and Zero Mission are excellent games to play. It just depends what you want from the exploring experience. Fusion is very linear due to a computer always telling you where to go while Zero Mission is much more liberal in how you explore things."

I've heard many say they don't enjoy this game and it might be nice to actually have a remake of. However the atmosphere and fear of the unknown is really what sold me both years ago and today  EDIT: As for Fusion I remember not being extremely impressed as a teenager.

Also, Fusion and Zero Mission will only be available on the Wii U eShop. I don't know about Super. Oh yeah, and you might want to look at AM2R.

Metroid,32m4b7,autowikibot,2,Wed Apr 15 13:29:50 2015 UTC,"Vocal fry register:       The vocal fry register (also known as pulse register, laryngealisation, pulse phonation, creak, popcorning, glottal fry, glottal rattle, glottal scrape, or strohbass) is the lowest vocal register and is produced through a loose glottal closure which will permit air to bubble through slowly with a popping or rattling sound of a very low frequency.  During this phonation, the arytenoid cartilages in the larynx are drawn together which causes the vocal folds to compress rather tightly and become relatively slack and compact. This process forms a large and irregularly vibrating mass within the vocal folds that produces the characteristic low popping or rattling sound when air passes through the glottal closure. The register (if well controlled) can extend far below the modal voice register, in some cases up to 8 octaves lower, such as in the case of Tim Storms who holds the world record for lowest frequency note ever produced by a human, a G-7, which is only 0.189Hz.

He has no details other than that and the fact that this site is making a big article out of it and claiming it as a leak is very disingenuous in my opinion. There's really nothing to see here.

Metroid,32lavn,Tertlepower14,3,Tue Apr 14 18:25:45 2015 UTC,"A typical shinespark sequence goes something like this (coming from someone that plays mostly Zero Mission):   Start initial speed boost. Crouch to trigger shinespark. Quickly get to the location the location that you'll use the shinespark. If you need to jump to get there, use the SPIN JUMP (jump & D-pad at the same time). Spin jumping is very important, a bit more on that later. Jump and then very quickly push the D-pad in the direction you want to shinespark. As you spineshark, you'll hit sloped terrain, which will cause you to automatically go back to your speed boost. Make sure you're still holding the D-pad in the direction of the speed boost when it starts back up again or you'll lose your boost. Repeat steps 1-5.   The trick to mastering the ""shinespark multiple times puzzles"" is that you have to spin jump in place if you have to jump to the place you need to shinespark. If you jump and then press the D-pad the game will think you that you'll be shinesparking even though you didn't want to do it right then. Spin jumping in place gets past this problem.  Also be ready to immediately crouch again when you shinespark onto sloped terrain. Some of the slopes you shinespark onto are very small and don't give you much leeway. A perfect example of this is the energy tank in Zero Mission that requires you to shinespark from Chozodia to the Space Pirate mothership. You have to shinespark onto multiple small-sloped platforms that require precise and quick timing.  Hopefully this helps. Good luck, once you master it shinesparking is one of the most fun things I've done in a video game."
Metroid,32lavn,surgingchaos,2,Tue Apr 14 19:13:41 2015 UTC,it also depends on which game you are talking about. Fusion shinespark works differently from super etc.
Metroid,32lavn,Jammintk,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:58:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in super you can't do multiple shinesparks, it costs energy, and the timing for changing direction when you start is really difficult."
Metroid,32lavn,txcrnr,1 point,Wed Apr 15 10:43:24 2015 UTC,"Super Shinespark:   Run till speedboost Hit down to crouch. You now glow. If you jump straight up, you will fly upwards. If you somersault jump, you will not fly and can jump around normally. If you hold R (aim up diagonally) and jump straight up, you will fly diagonally instead.   Each time you fly, you will continue until hitting something solid. It will also expend energy. Finally, if you take too long between crouching and jumping, the shinespark will expire and you'll have to charge another one."

You are fully entitled to having/creating your own backups of your own games, but that's where it gets tricky, as ripping an iso of the disc isn't always as straightforward as people would like. Which is why they choose to download them ('illegally') instead.  As Wombo said, Dolphin is the emulator you're looking for.

Elevator and door transitions are now faster.  Shine sparks  charge up quicker! Samus can do a shinespark slope refresh just like Metroid Fusion/Zero mission. In addition a shinespark charge can be held a lot longer.  While in the middle of speed booster, if you were to jump and land again while continuing to go one direction, the speedbooster state still continues rather than get interrupted.

Metroid,32jkgy,Therap3,4,Tue Apr 14 08:44:54 2015 UTC,"A few places look similair en sevreal enemies act like they did in the original. Other than that, they are very different games. Zero Mission is an excellent remake that really cleans up movement, has a wider variety of upgrades and the game world / map is a lot more diverse.   If you're intrested in how it compares to the original then you're free to check it out for yourself, since completing the game on any diffiulty will unlock the original Metroid title as one of the many bonuses."
Metroid,32jkgy,Mortimer42,2,Tue Apr 14 09:23:27 2015 UTC,"Sweet that's a nice bonus. My other question is since the original takes place on planet zebes and you explore the world, why does super metroid take place in the same world and have you fight (for example) kraid again?"
Metroid,32jkgy,Mortimer42,2,Tue Apr 14 09:47:59 2015 UTC,"Chronologically Zero Mission is the first game in the timeline. As such your mission is to stop the space pirates in this game, and then several years later they rebuild and you have to face them again. Maybe Samus blew up the planet at the end of Super Metroid to avoid that loop.  As far as the bosses go, it is a bit of a grey area in the Metroid cannon. Super Metroid Kraid could be a different Kraid than the one you see in Zero Mission, same race but several of them work with the space pirates.   Ridley apparently has an insane body that can regenerate even after he has been mashed into a pulp and stomped on."

Metroid,32cpgt,PhazonX,8,Mon Apr 13 20:35:10 2015 UTC,I don't like Kotaku at all but if I had to give em credit for anything it was definitely their article on this.
Metroid,32cpgt,DrDongStrong,22,Mon Apr 13 01:08:11 2015 UTC,"Ugh, but there are so many errors with this. The writing while pretty good at points is incredibly speculative  Note: written on my phone so excuse the lack of formatting and occasional punctuation error, etc.   Listing a few major inaccuracies:  1: the chozo never traveled phaaze.  2: the metroids were created to control the x-paracite population due to it's potential for exponential growth and destruction (due to its ability to absorbs the knowledge of its prey, and because of its instinctual parasitic nature) 3: The preservation of phaaze and the destruction of its most dangerous species describe inconsistent moral/ethical perspectives. They are simply contradictory. Additionally, the proposed introduction of the metroids to the phaaze ecosystem isn't a perminant solution to begin with. If phaaze can evolve dangerous species once, it can do it again. 4: The chozo were not always peaceful, their settling on Talon IV was an attempt to live in peace with nature - a marked change of perspective from their past. Not to say that they were a waring species to begin with. Later in their occupation of Talon IV, The Chozo left the physical plane of existsnce still attempting to more clearly see the future and to discover the nature of the darkness that it heralded. They weren't born with some magical prophetic abilities, rather it came about as a result of their slow melding and eventual unity with nature or existence. Point is: THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT PHAAZ WAS BEFORE THEIR OWN EXTINCTION TOOK PLACE. Therefore no ship to phaaz and no introduction of metroids to phaaz.  5: sr388's name. May be speculation on my part here, but I highly doubt that the chozo referred to SR388 as such. This mostly comes from my speculation that ""sr388"" is a ""name"" resulting from a planetary identification system most likely introduced by the galactic federation. Similar to our own naming conventions used to track planets and other galactic bodies. Point is, the chozo didn't speak English/Japanese/etc and the galactic federation & it's naming conventions came well after the chozo extinction. It's highly unlikely that the chozo would name a planet SR388 to begin with, and further that the Galactic federation would then adopt and continue to use that same name.   OK, I'm done lol. There are so many more things wrong with the speculative lore of the article that I'm not going to get into. My knowledge may also be a bit rusty, so check me on my points, but I'm certain that the article's proposed lore is grossly inaccurate. Lastly, I suppose I most dislike the portrayal of the chozo in the piece. Not only does the article unintentionally describe them as a contradictory society lacking in forethought, but it focuses heavily on their warring potential while omitting their spiritual awakening and ultimate unity/ascension - the reason for their extinction as well as the cause for the existence of the ""chozo ghosts"" in Prime 1.     Edt: clarity, grammar, etc."

Metroid,32cpgt,MistaGeez,16,Mon Apr 13 01:14:36 2015 UTC,Some of it is from the games. Some from the Manga and other documents related to the games. A large amount of it is speculative though.
Metroid,32cpgt,DepthsofNorfair,10,Mon Apr 13 03:20:58 2015 UTC,"""Speculative"" is being generous. This article outright ignores things that are explicitly stated in the games. I'd say it's closer to being fanfiction than a ""lore lesson""."

Metroid,32cpgt,Skullman7809,2,Mon Apr 13 21:38:40 2015 UTC,So not all the Metroid games go in order?

Metroid,32cpgt,STUFF2o,2,Mon Apr 13 04:25:48 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  If you ignore the Metroid Prime series, the timeline is   Metroid/Zero Mission > Metroid II > Super Metroid > Metroid Fusion (the order they were released in).  Prime 1-3 are just between Metroid I and II, which makes sense because they were made by a different studio."
Metroid,32cpgt,STUFF2o,1 point,Wed Apr 15 06:10:22 2015 UTC,"Outside of the bit about the Chozo going to Phaaze, and the metroids being created to eliminate Phaaze superpredators, this is a pretty good interpretation.  It does a good job of tying together a pretty loose saga.  So while it's canon that the metroids were created to eliminate/contain the X on SR-388, we do still don't know how metroids ended up on Phaaze.  Either they were brought from SR-388 to Phaaze somehow, or they came from the Chozo.  If there were no metroids on Phaaze in ancient times, there would be no Metroid Prime.  So how did something native to SR-388 end up there, especially if nobody knew where Phaaze was?  Would it be reasonable to swap what the article says about metroids in SR388 and Phaaze? Maybe they were created for SR388, and later the Chozo introduced them to Phaaze.  Also, is what the article says about there being Chozo remains on Phaaze true? Or at least armor?"

Metroid,32btgn,Dark_Jinouga,3,Sun Apr 12 19:49:57 2015 UTC,"Meta Ridley is my favorite. It's just the right length, has just the right amount of weapon-switching, and the end of the fight with the ruins attacking him is amazing (as is the ghosts of the Chozo that've been watching you helping you get into Impact Crater)."
Metroid,32btgn,silverevilchao,3,Sun Apr 12 18:29:51 2015 UTC,"MP have to be Metroid Prime exoskeleton, the fact that you have to be constantly changing weapons, and it actually hurts you a lot... challenging and fun, and you use everything!  I don't really have a big nemesis on MP2, but I would like to mention Grapple Guardian was terrifying, the same with Alpha Blogg... I tend to have high rushes of adrenaline with them... but Quadraxis... HANDS DOWN! SO FUN and an AWESOME reward!   MP3 didn't had a big nemesis till Aurora Unit 313... but Rundas, and Ghor, man... that makes you teary... (fuck Gandrayda lol)  Bonus: The most frustrating history on gaming award goes to Omega Pirate on Hypermode for Trilogy... 2 months, at least 2-3 tries a day... IF from the save point to the Omega Pirate's room I get one point of damage from the plasma trooper in the mid, I would just reset because I knew I was not going to make it..."

Metroid,32btgn,ArchYourBack145,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:54:26 2015 UTC,Meta Ridley jumps to mind because it was such an epic fight the first time I played the game but my favorite has to be Thardus because of how unique the boss is and how that battle is just challenging enough every time while still being fun.

Metroid,32c1af,Jammintk,3,Sun Apr 12 22:13:57 2015 UTC,They did the same thing for COD as well. It's just pandering to fandoms to get views.
Metroid,32c1af,ArchdukeMoneybags,4,Mon Apr 13 02:37:12 2015 UTC,MP2 needs to be higher.
Metroid,32c1af,AuraCorp,3,Sun Apr 12 16:30:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'd personally put it at number one, but for popular opinion's sake at least switch it's spot with MP3."
Metroid,32c1af,Phayzon,3,Mon Apr 13 02:15:37 2015 UTC,That's a fair list. I agreed with most of what they said and I agree that Prime 1 is a tad better than Super
Metroid,32c1af,Fishy956,3,Sun Apr 12 15:07:08 2015 UTC,I'm ok with this list. I like how they explained the deliberation over the #1 slot.   Watching this also made me really want a new (good) Metroid release.

Metroid,32a637,txcrnr,1 point,Sun Apr 12 01:53:32 2015 UTC,I though the were just from different areas of SR-388.
Metroid,32a637,Jammintk,3,Sun Apr 12 05:33:39 2015 UTC,Area 1 was a replication of the SR-388 ecosystem. Areas 2-6 were different climates but not necessarily based on SR-388
Metroid,32a637,TheFlyingBogey,2,Sun Apr 12 08:10:28 2015 UTC,"Yep, I'm pretty sure a large amount of the enemies from Sector 3 PYR come from Brinstar Depths and Norfair."

Metroid,32a637,alpha_alpaca,6,Sun Apr 12 09:54:34 2015 UTC,"The first one seems like it would be too easy to just let them dig then run away before they pop up. The second one was too easy to avoid. You can go into morphball and set the game boy down and nothing much would happen to you. Not very engaging enemies. The last one looks like it could possibly be attached to the environment, like the end of an open steam vent. It turns invisible so there may be another sprite that it hides behind. Maybe an environmental hazard? Like there's an open vent of fuel, so don't shoot or you'll blow yourself up! The fact that you can't kill it makes me think it's an environmental hazard. That could lead to some interesting gameplay like maybe trying to escape an room full of enemies without firing a shot or maybe a stealth approach. Just my thoughts on the enemies. Great find!"
Metroid,32a637,SCHMITTAY,8,Sun Apr 12 04:55:00 2015 UTC,"The ""going invisible"" is due to the sprite flickering every other frame. Since the game runs at 60 fps, and youtube normally runs at 30, it seems to appear and disappear when in game it is only flickering."
Metroid,32a637,Jammintk,2,Sun Apr 12 07:52:03 2015 UTC,"YouTube now runs at 60, but if the video was uploaded before the switch, it will run at 30. Or if the video was recorded at 30, it will run at 30."

Metroid,32a637,txcrnr,2,Sun Apr 12 01:53:13 2015 UTC,What about the desert part of PYR?
Metroid,32a637,henryuuk,1 point,Sun Apr 12 12:50:39 2015 UTC,completely forgot PYR had a desert part. I guess they would have belonged in there but were scrapped cause they weren't needed then. or something like that.

Metroid,329vcj,PokecheckHozu,2,Sun Apr 12 01:27:04 2015 UTC,For real. This works even before you have the Dark Visor.
Metroid,329vcj,-Anguscr4p-,24,Sun Apr 12 23:35:06 2015 UTC,"Is Prime 3 similar in design?   Prime 3 is very different in design in comparison to its two predecessors, whether it's good or not varies a lot from person to person. You're not really going to get the Prime 1 experience again with any other game really.  As for Prime 2, since you're past the Spider Guardian you're really past the most frustrating part of the game, I'd try and finish it if only for the sake of completion, you're not too far off after all. If you get really ticked off at the game you can simply Google where to find the Sky Temple Keys that you'll need later."
Metroid,329vcj,Masterofknees,20,Sat Apr 11 22:59:43 2015 UTC,"Prime 2 is actually my favourite of the series, for it's higher difficulty, better atmosphere and awesome stage design.  Hunter Ing I'll give are pretty bullshit, even with the Dark Visor, but you never have to actually kill any of them, just run from them. Your best shot of taking them out is energizing a crystal/beacon and luring it towards you.  You really shouldn't have issues with ammo as long as you grab the expansions, remember blowing up containers gets you ammo back (for the other type). And don't underestimate the beams as well, charged dark beam shots followed by a missile instantly kill Dark Commandos (helpful tip) and 2 regular shots can kill just about any normal light world.  Chykka is a tough fight I'll give you that, but if you ever go back here are some helpful tips.   When the larva is swimming around, aim ahead and shot normal dark beam shots, if you time right you'll hit it and deal nice chip damage. If you need to replenish ammo kill the shredders it spawns. Don't bother with Super Missiles. At all. It moves too fast and you'll just waste missiles. When Chykka grabs the platform and tilts it, blast it with normal light beam shots, when it starts to sink back hit it with a charged light beam shot. Again don't bother with Super Missiles, waste of time. For the flying form, stick to normal dark beam shots again, timing can be hard since the shots move slowly but it shouldn't be too hard to peg it. And again don't bother with Charged Dark Beam shots or Super Missiles, the first is too slow to hit and the latter the Chykka will break your lock on When Chykka is stunned, use your Seeker Missiles on the back, lock onto the last one to get the full five missiles, and repeat. Dark Chykka is easily felled by Charged Light Beam shots, this is the easiest part of the fight by far. If you're straining for ammo and/or energy, wait for it to spawn Chykklings, these drop RIDICULOUS amounts of pickups   As for the Spider Guardian, you're playing the WiiU Trilogy version, so FOR THE LOVE OF GOD USE THE JUMPBALL BY FLICKING THE WIIMOTE, IT'S SO MUCH EASIER. And take your time in the final phase, you have enough of it.  I wouldn't skip it, even for people that dislike the harshness the Spider Guardian is somewhat the last point of it, and if you stop now you'll miss some truly awesome boss fights."
Metroid,329vcj,Model_Omega,19,Sun Apr 12 01:12:08 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me like you didn't scan Chykka's Larva form to learn its weak point. That phase of the fight literally takes about one minute if you Super missile his belly after scanning.  Also, Chykka's full form shoots out little dudes pretty frequently that should drop ammo reliably. Did you catch the hint text early on? Shooting stuff with dark beam gets you light ammo drops and vice versa.  Based on your fight length against grapple guardian as well it sounds to me like you just aren't scanning stuff.  Edit: also, Hunter ing are noticeably more solid when vulnerable, you might need to adjust your TV brightness. But usually the best way to kill Hunter ing is lure them into safe zones :3"
Metroid,329vcj,Tagrineth,1 point,Sat Apr 11 22:53:47 2015 UTC,Probably.
Metroid,329vcj,Piconoe,0,Sat Apr 11 22:56:52 2015 UTC,"Concerning Chykka, I did scan it, just had trouble getting enough time to hit its belly with even a normal shot, let alone a super missile!  Also with the Grapple Guardian, I did follow the scan advice and waited for it to get shocked on the pillar. It still took me forever. Was there a strategy that I missed?"
Metroid,329vcj,GLaDOSSlayer,5,Sat Apr 11 23:53:11 2015 UTC,"Were you making sure to use the side-dash ability (left or right + B) when locked on to navigate behind him and blast his ass?  Also, it seems like you aren't searching for missile and beam ammo expansions enough. A good hint that there is one nearby is when there is a slight pulsing sound that seems to be coming from a certain location (i.e., it fades in or out depending on your proximity to the pickup)."
Metroid,329vcj,Luigimario280,8,Sat Apr 11 23:58:43 2015 UTC,"I love MP2   Hunter Ing   The strategy I tend to use is to get inside a bubble, wait for it to come close, and then energize it to instantly kill the Hunter Ing."
Metroid,329vcj,jcw801,6,Sun Apr 12 01:33:10 2015 UTC,Was so much better when you got the annihilator beam. Just hit the crystal with it and everything Ing in the room ran straight into it.
Metroid,329vcj,Big_Mazz,1 point,Sun Apr 12 05:05:16 2015 UTC,"Ya know, you can lock-on to a Hunter Ing with the Dark Visor...only takes like 3 shots with the light beam."
Metroid,329vcj,citizenofgaia,6,Wed Apr 15 16:09:55 2015 UTC,"My advice is for people to never go prime 1 -> 2 -> 3, is ""too much metroid"".  Especially after 1.  After 1 you should have played something else, some colorfull happy game or something to ""cleanse"" the metroid feel, so you can come back to it.  Prime 2 is absolutely different from 1, but is great nontheless.  The mistake people make is to expect Prime 2 to be just like Prime, instead of welcoming hte game from what it is. Same with prime 3."
Metroid,329vcj,luemasify,4,Sun Apr 12 05:33:19 2015 UTC,"When I played I hoarded on Light and Dark ammo so much thinking that I would always run out so I ended up never using it (except for the few instances where you can't proceed without it) and ended up finishing the game then thinking ""oh"""

Metroid,329vcj,luemasify,2,Sun Apr 12 02:25:05 2015 UTC,Half-Life and the Fallout series has taught me to conserve ammo like mad
Metroid,329vcj,128polygons,4,Sun Apr 12 02:40:28 2015 UTC,"Well, it seems I'm a little late to this post, but I want to share my thoughts anyway.  First off: you're right, it's hard, and can be frustrating at times. But to me, that's the beauty of this game. It's so intimidating. Aether is dark and creepy even in the ""light"" dimension. Almost all of the time you feel so vulnerable, and that makes stumbling upon a save room that much more satisfying. It's kinda like a horror movie, this feeling of dread and helplessness, and that instict of fighting for survival. Prime 2 reminds me of the 2d games in a way, a similar feeling of loneliness and mystery.   And I totally get why someone wouldn't like that. Anyway, Prime 3 is very different. It's a more linear game, easier (you should pick the hard difficulty, normal is too easy), brighter and has less frustrating parts."
Metroid,329vcj,KedovDoKest,5,Sun Apr 12 15:56:12 2015 UTC,"The next section of the game is a lot better. Torvus bog is kind of a slog, it seems like they decided to put all the annoying bosses in one area. Also, for the ammo situation, if you kill the ""living"" storage containers with the opposite beam, you'll get ammo from them. That, plus the ""swarm"" enemies (nightbarbs, those little seahorse things) are basically just there to let you build up depleted ammo and health. As for the hunter ing, if he gets close to you, shoot the beacon with the light beam and it supercharges it, instantly killing him. This also works with any other ing, including pirate commandos. And yeah, boost guardian is bullshit. He was actually weakened for the wii version, so count yourself lucky."
Metroid,329vcj,Jafoob,6,Sun Apr 12 01:17:33 2015 UTC,"Have you been finding beam ammo expansions? Be sure that you explore each and every room, you can aquire up to 250 ammo, gaining 50 each time. As for the spider ball Guardian, you can actually force the morph ball to jump without using bombs by flicking the Wiimote upwards. Happy hunting, consult an online guide that is what I had to do to keep enjoying the game."
Metroid,329vcj,Wombo194,5,Sat Apr 11 23:36:20 2015 UTC,you can actually force the morph ball to jump without using bombs   Whaaaaaaaat?! I did not know this. Holy fucking shit.

Metroid,329vcj,rezbit-hex,7,Sun Apr 12 01:19:19 2015 UTC,;) yep! I played through both primes in the gamecube so I feel tour frustration. You are nearing a great part of the game where you get the 4th beam weapon which pretty much destroys everything.
Metroid,329vcj,WeightyUnit88,3,Sun Apr 12 00:07:55 2015 UTC,I feel like the GameCube controls make my hand hurt less. For the most part they don't hurt at all. The only real pain in MP2 was the Chykka boss fight the first time. I squeezed L for ages. The aurora fight in Prime 3 always gets my trigger thumb aching.

Metroid,329vcj,chunky_2336,3,Sun Apr 12 16:12:04 2015 UTC,"my wrist aching like I had just been on an extreme and prolonged wanking binge   The first two games were really designed to be used with the gamecube controller, which you unfortunately don't have the option of using for the trilogy re-release.  I'd make sure that lock-on free aim is disabled to better simulate what the games are like on the gamecube.  The bosses and everything are balanced around you not having to adjust or fine tune or aim much at all.  I play prime 3 with lock-on free aim disabled, and it is murder on my wrists.  Either way, take a break and stretch often.  I like the stretches shown here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUyMNyrOHJQ"

Metroid,329vcj,-Anguscr4p-,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:42:11 2015 UTC,"Well as I mentioned before I found it helped immensely with the Chykka Larvae fight, since you can keep your view point but still aim ahead to peg it while it swims.  Aside from that, I always just liked it because it felt better, maybe it's because I played a lot of games that used the WiiMote as a cursor and got really good at it."
Metroid,329vcj,PKThoron,1 point,Sun Apr 12 18:09:34 2015 UTC,"I never use it, and the fact that it's forced in almost all of MP3's boss fights makes them so much more annoying to me."
Metroid,329vcj,JoltZero,3,Sun Apr 12 23:41:11 2015 UTC,"Light and Dark ammo are absolutely not scarce. Believe me, I was all too eager to conserve it on my first playthrough as well and ended up using the Power Beam 90% of the time, but on my second playthrough, I decided to fuck it and just go wild with it. It's kinda cathartic in a way, killing stuff (quickly) with the L/D beams is much more satisfying than with the lame ol' Power Beam and you don't have to switch as often either. If you find the ammo extensions, you shouldn't ever run out of them outside of boss battles.  My greatest issue with the beams is that there's barely any strategical usage of them, since their effectiveness pretty much depends directly on the enemy type you're facing rather than the freezing/homing/piercing/burning properties and whatnot.  Also, worry not: soon enough you will get the Power Bombs and be able to kill almost every generic enemy in one hit."
Metroid,329vcj,Aftershock7,2,Sun Apr 12 12:07:49 2015 UTC,"I haven't played it in such a long time, but I agree; I did not enjoy MP2 nearly as much as MP1 for exactly the same reasons you listed."
Metroid,329vcj,twinfyre,2,Sat Apr 11 22:50:10 2015 UTC,I just beat MP2 a few months ago after started and stopping many times through the years. The final sequence was really cool and the music is amazing. It was well worth the finish for me!
Metroid,329vcj,henryuuk,2,Sat Apr 11 23:52:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, MP2 is my favorite in the series, but I won't deny that it's enjoyment isn't based entirely on personal preference.   The frustrating part is one of the reasons I like it. It doesn't pull any punches with the difficulty. When I was first playing, I kept on dying in a lot of the boss fights like the boost guardian, Chykka, and the spider guardian. So I began switching strategies, and adapting to the boss. Oftentimes I would win by the skin of my teeth. But the victory felt all the more satisfying.  I can't really give any good advice on what you should do next. I could say to just power through it. But if you're really not enjoying it then just skip to prime 3. It's a lot more linear and much more cinematic than Prime 2."
Metroid,329vcj,Aredler,3,Sun Apr 12 00:12:52 2015 UTC,"MP2 is the one I don't remember the most off. I do remember enjoying most of it, but everything just sorta blends together in my mind into some dark mesh of spiderthings    Only thing I really remember was the start with the zombie soldiers and the ending escape."
Metroid,329vcj,kindarilwraja,5,Sat Apr 11 22:54:38 2015 UTC,everything just sorta blends together in my mind into some dark mesh of spiderthings    Yeah that's pretty much MP2 in a nutshell.
Metroid,329vcj,BobisOnlyBob,3,Sun Apr 12 01:27:08 2015 UTC,"No. You are not the only person who feels that way. I ranted about it a few months ago: http://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/2f364l/frustration_with_echoes_does_anyone_agree_with_me/  Having been in this subreddit a while, I've found people either love Echoes or find it frustrating. Those that love it seem to love it either for the atmosphere or for the difficult bosses. Those that find it frustrating do so for various reasons, sometimes for the very reasons that the others love it.  Keep going or skip is up to you, but don't ditch the trilogy. Prime 3 has far fewer of the kinds of things you're finding frustrating. The gameplay feels like a return to Prime 1, though the narrative and sequence are completely new."
Metroid,329vcj,AuraCorp,3,Sun Apr 12 02:09:32 2015 UTC,I found Echoes frustrating and stopped playing - then came back many months later and now it's literally my favourite Metroid title. Echoes is divisive.
Metroid,329vcj,vhwatgoes,3,Sun Apr 12 16:32:30 2015 UTC,"Don't give up. A decent amount consider MP2 the best Metroid Prime game. MP3 is so easy. With 3 difficulties to choose from, it's hardmode is not hard. Maybe just take a small break. Give it 2-7 days. 1 of 2 things will happen: 1 you feel refreshed and enjoy it or 2 you realize why you stopped playing.  Edit: Was super tired when I wrote this."
Metroid,329vcj,AuraCorp,12,Sat Apr 11 22:38:15 2015 UTC,I think MP2 also has the biggest split between people who really like it and people who really don't.

Whenever I'm low on ammo, I just destroy a bunch of boxes (of which there are plenty) with the opposite type ammo and this usually yields enough to get me back to acceptable levels.  I just replayed MP2 a few weeks ago and I never felt the pressure of low ammo.  Also, just as a rule of thumb, there's usually an ammo station near where the boss fight will take place.  As for the Hunters, you're life will get insanely easier when you get the Annihilator Beam after the 3rd boss fight.  Just shoot a light beacon/light crystal with it and Ing will literally kill themselves by walking into the light field.  Don't give up, it's a great game!"
Metroid,329vcj,Llllllong,1 point,Sat Apr 11 22:56:41 2015 UTC,"I do remember finding MP2 more irritating than MP1 early on, but IIRC it does improve.  Concerning the light/dark beams you get ammo for one by killing stuff with the other, so if you can find a swarm of weak enemies and go to town with the light beam your dark beam should refill pretty fast, then switch it up to replenish the light beam too."
Metroid,329vcj,PyroSpark,1 point,Sat Apr 11 23:29:19 2015 UTC,"I feel you. The first time I played it really got to me, on every point on this list.  But the ammo is gotten by using the opposite beam to kill something or open a container, and it's pretty plentiful. I guess if you don't like long boss fights you're out of luck but I really do think that they are all great fights in their own ways, and it's just so cool. It can be frustrating but I think it would be bad to skip all of the amazing atmosphere and equipment!"

Metroid,329vcj,ninger6,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:31:26 2015 UTC,"Regarding the Hunter Ing, you can almost always just ignore them. As far as light and dark ammo go, I don't know what you're talking about. I can only think of a couple of times when you really need to use them outside of bosses. But you should also get creative. For instance, you know those darned Dark Pirate Commandos? Use the dark beam on them. Just use a single charge shot and them blast them with a missile. Dark Metroids? Same. Dark Grenchlers? Hit them with some charged light beam shots. Warrior Ing go down easily with Light Beam but you can usually ignore them. Dark Splinters go down with a couple of charged power beam shots. Sanctuary is where you have to be more careful with your ammo, as you're going to need it more often. Also, kill enemies with the dark beam for light beam ammo and vice versa. This also counts for crates and the miscellaneous ""bio-crates"" you'll find throughout the game. Managing ammo really isn't very hard, I promise. Boost Guardian is hell. Spider Guardian is hell. Let me know if you have any more specific questions. I've played through these games countless times. Also Prime 3 on Hyper Mode = balls hard."

You have to do everything in a particular order otherwise there's some vital scans that will never be able to be scanned, fuck it, scan everything asap it's ridiculous.   The Hunter Ing pissed me off to much especially when I was younger. Don't worry, once you get over the overwhelming atmosphere and collect mote upgrades it's pretty cruisey. However theres SO MUCH backtracking. It's alllllll over the place.   Another thing, first time I battled the Grapple Grenchler I took a solid hour. I was so baffled by the thing."

Metroid,326jcb,txcrnr,4,Sat Apr 11 02:21:27 2015 UTC,Magic and sorcery.  Possibly both.  Prime 2 gave a meaningless line that didn't even attempt to make sense. Apparently storing kinetic energy just lets you float casually through the air.

Metroid Prime 2 is my favorite metroid, too bad you couldn't try it without lag. Yes, you get told what to do a bit, but there's a good deal of puzzles and such left in it. Playing it with hints off might have been the thing to do, since that does require you to explore a lot, and sometimes in places you wouldn't think...  Fusion was my very first metroid so obviously one I enjoyed a lot.  Prime 3 corruption adds a lot of cutscenes and dialogs, so it usually isn't seen as good as the other two primes. It's still a good game tho!  Other M I didn't like but mostly due to small stuff. It's even more closed than Fusion, there's one route and that's it. There are ""forced slow mode"" passages you can't even run. The story is... Fusion's story but with a lot more cutscenes that do not fit in the usual Metroid theme.  Metroid I and II I can't tell, since I didn't really play them. Metroid I is super challenging tho."

Metroid,324uke,SaintOdhran,4,Fri Apr 10 19:52:12 2015 UTC,I never really felt that the Primes did horror (have not played the third yet). Echoes was claustrophobic at times I guess but other than that... unless people found the Ing designs disturbing?
Metroid,324uke,solaris1990,6,Fri Apr 10 21:03:13 2015 UTC,There's a lot more to horror than gruesome or disturbing sights. Being alone in a dark room with things trying to sneak up behind you or grab you is horror too.

It's well-made, terrifying, and distinctly non-reliant on jump scares, but people who haven't played don't understand the terror beyond loud noises. A huge part of its horror is the creeping sense of dread as you nervously manage tons of variables, and the jump scare is just the thing that completely breaks you."

I still didn't feel the sort of ambiguous threat you mention though - when I noticed a threat in the Prime games I could usually just shoot it and promptly eliminate it. It's been a while since I played them, admittedly. Fusion on the other hand I found extremely suspenseful."
Metroid,324uke,solaris1990,4,Fri Apr 10 21:39:17 2015 UTC,"I just replayed Prime after not having played it in years and I felt really anxious in tons of parts. Any time I had to keep my thermal visor or x-ray visor on I felt like I was walking around half blind. The first time the Chozo ghosts popped up made me jump and I got super anxious if I tried to avoid them and just leave the room. The worst was when I was in the Phazon mines and had to walk past the Elite Pirates in stasis, knowing that some of them were going to wake up.  Basically, any time I couldn't see something or had my back to it I was anxious."
Metroid,324uke,Advacar,3,Fri Apr 10 21:56:13 2015 UTC,"Hmm the Elite Pirates in stasis (also I think Metroids?) I had forgotten. They were indeed ominous + created suspense. Overall most of MP1 felt very open and unconstrained for me though although there were stressful bits like the Chozo ghosts.  Echoes was different, especially the underwater world with bad visibility. Claustrophobic and atmospheric but I wouldn't quite equate it with horror where there tends to be a degree of powerlessness if only momentarily."

Metroid isn't scary in an outright sense, Metroid builds the atmosphere to crushing levels, making you tense and fearful for what comes next.  You can't do in-your-face horror when you are playing as a genetically modified super-human in a super-advanced power suit with an energy cannon/missile launcher for an arm. No ordinarily scary creature is relevant in the face of that, only sufficiently deadly prowess and force are going to cause concern."

Metroid,324uke,PKThoron,10,Sat Apr 11 15:23:52 2015 UTC,"I think Metroid can definitely use parts of horror, like it has already done  but a good (classic/standard) metroid game could not do (good) horror for one simple reason : Power.    In metroid you are powerful, in horror you have to be helpless/weak for the true feeling of horror to appear.    This is also why most of the moments of 'horror-like' situations in the metroid games happen near the start. Because you are still weak, either in actual abilities, or cause you have only just started playing the game."
Metroid,324uke,henryuuk,8,Fri Apr 10 19:22:14 2015 UTC,"I don't see why not. The major themes of Metroid are taken from Alien as it is, and the games are known for their incredible usage of atmosphere."
Metroid,324uke,devosion,7,Fri Apr 10 17:23:58 2015 UTC,"I think it could do Horror extremely well. Ever play MP1 or MP2 with the BGM turned off? Pop in a pair of headphones and only have sound effects enabled, and you're in for a hell of a ride!"
Metroid,324uke,souffle-etc,2,Fri Apr 10 17:25:32 2015 UTC,MP2 had some pretty unsettling music tho but you're right to say without the OST it would be hella creepy too.
Metroid,324uke,ninger6,6,Mon Apr 13 17:35:14 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I don't think I'd want Metroid to go for more horror.  Mostly because I'm not a fan of horror, but also because I think horror/action titles have been done a lot lately and I like to think of Metroid as being different than just some generic Alien ripoff that it could have easily been.  I think one big part of that is that Metroid games have (usually) succeeded in providing a variety of environments to explore; not just dark and gloomy ones.  Think about of the serenity and somberness of Maridia or the freshness and lightness of Phendrana Drifts.  When compared to the heat of Norfair or the gloominess of the Downed Frigate, it creates excellent juxtaposition, making the game that much more memorable.  Even Fusion, with all of it's horrific bosses, makes use of this not only between the sectors, but even in the difference between the regular areas and the ""secret"" areas you have to go through when things go wrong (like when the Power was out).  Sure, the Metroid series has made use of excellent, horror-like atmosphere, but to push it further that direction might be sacrificing the variety that the series traditionally provides.  Or so I think."
Metroid,324uke,bj_waters,2,Fri Apr 10 19:43:18 2015 UTC,Beautifully put.
Metroid,324uke,txcrnr,6,Fri Apr 10 21:04:06 2015 UTC,"I'd like it so that it isn't supposed to be a horror game but still has a lot of scary/creepy parts, like how Fusion is. Just a lot more of it. One suggestion I saw on reddit was there's a ZM styled lose-suit-and-run-around-sneaking-trying-to-find-it section but instead of space pirates it's some of the larger monsters you met earlier in the game. Or metroids. I think it would be kind of neat."
Metroid,324uke,notjustinbailey,3,Fri Apr 10 17:28:33 2015 UTC,a part of the world where you have mochroids chasing you and you have no way of killing them. That sounds awful.  Metroids sounds cooler except you can't get them off of you once they latch on.
Metroid,324uke,segwayspeedracer1,3,Fri Apr 10 17:34:13 2015 UTC,"As a child Super Metroid terrified me. Prime and Fusion had their moments of horror but I think some sort of ""horror element"" would fit pretty well in the Metroid games.

Metroid,324uke,fossilfern,1 point,Fri Apr 10 19:47:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Super Metroid scared me shitless when I was a kid.

Metroid,324uke,Carconzo222,4,Sat Apr 11 22:27:36 2015 UTC,I remember Metroid Prime 2 Scaring me to no end. Especially the parts where the dead soldiers that were stung up started getting lifted as you walked into a room. There was always something in the corner of your vision that just unsettled me. And in some ways Fusion was very similar to Amnesia. This unstoppable force running around the base that you had to avoid at all costs because it could annihilate you.
Metroid,324uke,dabocim,5,Fri Apr 10 22:05:58 2015 UTC,I think Metroid shouldn't go any further into horror than Prime and Fusion. I find one of the defining aspects of horror is the feeling of helplessness against all manner of abominations. I don't feel like Samus should be helpless. She's strong and badass.
Metroid,324uke,devosion,5,Fri Apr 10 17:37:38 2015 UTC,"Well Samus certainly isn't helpless, but she's just a person just like any other, running into strange varietys of hostile alien creatures on alien planets. Badass or not, a person in such a situation would have to feel some sense of apprehension and dread, even with the firepower at her disposal. I think working within these ideas, even in subtle ways, would make Samus a more 'human' character as it is, as she really hasn't had much character development outside of Fusion, and the god awful Other M. I'd love to see Samus' character portrayed within horror themes similar to how Ripley is portrayed. Strong, confident, capable, but still very much human against an overwhelming threat."
Metroid,324uke,Anggul,5,Fri Apr 10 18:46:24 2015 UTC,"I'd love a well articulated emotional base for Samus too. If Other M would have toned down the breakdowns, I'd been square with it. Being trapped in a tiny room with Metroid Queen is scary as Hell, especially after seeing Crispy Ridley.  But the key difference I feel between this series and others is that our protagonist is prepared. She's a 6'5 birdwomanhybrid in the strongest battle armor in the galaxy. She solos what entire armies can't do. Isaac Clarke is just a poor engineer in a bad situation. Leon Kennedy in Re4 starts off with just a pistol.  Master Chief faces horrors like them, but he's well equipped, like Samus.  However, take away Samus' suit and Metroid INSTANTLY switches perspective to a horror game. The Zero Suit sequence from Zero Mission was intense, as was anytime the SA-X was onscreen in Fusion. The absolute feeling of helplessness is terrifying. I feel to capture a true horror feeling, Samus would have to be stripped down, or the enemy would have to be something more horrific than life sucking flying jellyfish."
Metroid,324uke,BoogKnight,3,Fri Apr 10 22:32:46 2015 UTC,"The thing is, that isn't true. She isn't 'just human'. She's genetically modified and trained from youth by mystical bird people. She isn't recklessly fearless, she'll assess a situation and know when to be concerned, but she isn't going to react like most people would at all.  What makes her more vulnerable moments so noteworthy is that she isn't vulnerable for the same reasons normal people are. In Fusion for example, the SA-X was so deadly because it had ice weaponry and Samus was part Metroid.   Vulnerability can usually only be created by removing the power suit. With the suit there's very little she can't take on and she probably knows it. Without it she's still a deadly fighter, but she couldn't do much of what she does. Horror in the usual sense requires loss of the suit I feel, as an entire game where the enemies are a hard counter like the SA-X would be a very poorly conceived gimmick indeed."

Metroid,324uke,Plinkman,3,Fri Apr 10 22:33:39 2015 UTC,"It could have some creepier and more atmospheric moments for example when you are infilitrating a heavily armed pirate base, like in Prime where you need to get the thermal vision thing. But full Horror, meh, could work. But it wouldnt be a Metroid game I think, just a horror game with the atmosphere/look of Metroid"
Metroid,324uke,solaris1990,3,Fri Apr 10 19:01:27 2015 UTC,"When I entered the metroid lab in Skytown and bodies started turning to powder before my eyes, that felt pretty horrorish."

Metroid,324uke,SupaStaVince,2,Fri Apr 10 23:18:38 2015 UTC,"None of the other Metroid games hold a candle to Fusion horror-wise. Anyway Metroid could well do with horror elements but the crucial thing is to not sacrifice gameplay (the S-A-X was a great example of this - you are still powerful in relation to most of your surroundings but are nonetheless hunted).  I wouldn't want a Metroid game were saves and ammo were limited and you would flee as often as fight, but in terms of atmosphere and occasionally narrative why not. Actually feeling threatened throughout the game only increases the satisfaction gained by finally vanquishing your foe. Suspense is an emotion which can definitely be well-suited to the Metroid universe (e.g. Nightmare's shadow in Sector 5)."
Metroid,324uke,Wei_Tzu,2,Fri Apr 10 20:57:47 2015 UTC,"I remember back in Prime 3, where you get in that room in elysia, the light shuts of and a bunch of metroids get released and you must backtrack all the way trough this dark corridor filled with creatures trying to suck the energy out of you. Always make me shiver."
Metroid,324uke,Vinkill,2,Fri Apr 10 22:06:37 2015 UTC,I loved that part. Quite the prime example of what Metroid survival horror would be.
Metroid,324uke,RevinKayner,2,Sat Apr 11 02:48:17 2015 UTC,"I remember the first time playing through Metroid Prime when I was a kid I must've been like 8 or 9 . I found Frigate Orpheon to be pretty scary, but everything was fine till I reached the Parasite Queen, who completely wrecked me. I was so freaked out that I didn't play the game for weeks, and I was totally afraid that the Parasite Queen was gonna come outta hiding somewhere and eat me... She was hiding in my closet, under my bed, I was even scared to eat cereal in the morning because I thought it was gonna pop out and get me."
Metroid,324uke,MisterDoubleYum,2,Fri Apr 10 22:20:46 2015 UTC,"I think Fusion has the highest amount of horror elements to it, but the Prime trilogy can certainly build an extremely eerie atmosphere.  An excellent example of Prime building a lot of suspense and atmosphere is when the lights go out. It's a small detail, but when you switch away from the combat visor, that little radar thing in the upper left corner goes away. You don't have that little display telling you where everything is around you, so you have to rely on sight or sound to track any enemies.  Prime 2 has Dark Aether, I don't think any more needs to be said of that.  Prime 3 has Elysia, the Pirate Homeworld, and Phaaze. Elysia is enchantingly beautiful, but the Metroid labs are terrifying. The Pirate Homeworld has stealth elements to it to build tension, and Phaaze is so utterly alien, being a semi-sentient planet."
Metroid,324uke,TrueNateDogg,1 point,Sat Apr 11 04:03:39 2015 UTC,"You forgot about GFS Valhalla in Prime 3. In terms of eeriness, nothing comes remotely close in 3. Especially when you get to the end and hear the AU's message."

I would love a horror esque sequence with Ridley and grittier space pirates. The series has so much good horror potential. I think the space pirates and metroids have what it takes to be truly terrifying. Just needs the right touch. a sequence where you encounter metroids without the ice beam would be great. Or an area where you need to flee from, or hide from Ridley. Maybe have Ridley take on a roll similar to the nemesis in Resident Evil 3 where he could show up nearly at anytime."

Hell, have the Space Pirate fight be something that goes on for a bit, then you fight Riddles or whatever, and he's possessed. Riddles needs to be a bit more threatening, anyway.

Let the player's imagination fill in some blanks, and give maybe a single scary moment or two per game to make it memorable. Nothing extravagant needed, imo."
Metroid,324uke,mcbadassington,1 point,Sat Apr 11 02:02:01 2015 UTC,"I think the series should only take dips into the horror genre, as others have said, horror games are about being weak, and helpless, Samus is not that, she should be able to fight whatever is chasing her.   That said, I think that moments of horror, and helplessness would be cool, as long as there are points later in the game that you give you enough power to fight back and win."

Probably 15-20 play throughs.  I know that's a far cry from the record but I'm proud of it anyway."
Metroid,324qxm,jfr0lang,2,Fri Apr 10 20:47:40 2015 UTC,"Not very impressive but my record in ZM any% is 55 minutes. There are many ways I could improve my run and probably get it somewhere in the late 40 minutes (like doing Ridley before Kraid), but I've never actually read up on the quickest way to beat the game, I just played the crap out of it, especially on vacations, and ultimately got a decent time. I never put much focus on it though so it has happened over the course of several years, if I did practice it every day then it would probably have been possible to get my time with a few months' practice. I feel like everyone should be able to do well in ZM, while its gameplay is faster than the other 2D Metroids it doesn't have the difficult tricks that you find in Super Metroid or the Prime games, so aslong as the dedication is there a sub-50 minute run isn't far off."

Metroid,324qxm,telimonster,2,Sun Apr 12 00:03:04 2015 UTC,"The first speedrun (technically, a TAS) I watched was a Super Metroid one many many years ago (I don't think it's on YouTube anymore). I got hooked on speedrunning for a while after that. At that point I had beaten SM probably over a hundred times (I was about 8 or 9 I think), but I never thought to speedrun anything myself.  Fast forward to two years ago and I start speedrunning with Super Metroid (after beating it a couple hundred more times of course), I'm sure it wasn't as hard for me as most others because I knew every nook and cranny and secret there is to the game. It was fun for a while until I watched more up-to-date runs and got discouraged (my PB got to 52 mins in game). I switched to ZM at this point, because I had a physical copy of it. I've been playing it for a little over a year now, and my PB for that is 37:49 in-game time.  I got a physical copy of SM last week at an expo, so I'm getting into running 100% on SM now. (currently my PB is 1:33 ingame, but I've only done one test run)."
Metroid,324qxm,telimonster,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:22:37 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd like to get into running Super Metroid, but I live in Europe and only have PAL SNES, so it doesn't really make sense to speedrun on it. Recently, I've been playing ntsc version on emulator, but again -  it's not really good for running it fast (game speed is ok, but I have to play with dualshock3 controller, with which it's somehow difficult to perform shinesparks)."
Metroid,324qxm,Snytbaggen,1 point,Sat Apr 11 21:39:46 2015 UTC,"That sucks that you only have the pal version. I got my SM cart for $80 so it's not like you can get the NA setup for cheap. Before I got my cart, I ran in emulator using a logitech precision controller and going from that to SNES controller has been difficult.  What about shinesparking is not working for you?"
Metroid,324qxm,Snytbaggen,1 point,Sat Apr 11 22:32:14 2015 UTC,"What about shinesparking is not working for you?   It's dualshock 3 issue. On SNES controller it wasn't problem for me, but ds3's d-pad must have been constructed in a way, that just makes shinesparks almost impossible, they just don't work. And it's not emulator problem, I tried switching controls to keyboard and then I could do it everytime.  So I ended up playing Super Metroid on my PSP, after setting few settings on snes9x emulator, PSP is able to run SM smoothly, fast and psp's d-pad allows performing shinesparks. Well... someday I will just buy ntsc SNES and SM on ebay, pay hundreds dollars for it, but at least it would allow me to finally play 'normal' version of Super Metroid."
Metroid,324qxm,telimonster,2,Sat Apr 11 23:55:01 2015 UTC,"This might not be an option for you since it's a bit complicated, but what I did was to buy a Japanese copy of the game (a lot cheaper than the NA version but identical to it aside from the case and region lock) and then performed a 60Hz mod to my PAL SNES. If you're comfortable with a soldering iron it's not a very difficult mod to do, depending on your SNES revision. AFAIK there are no differences in how it runs compared to an NTSC console, but I have no idea if it's allowed in the speedrunning community since I only play for my own fun."
Metroid,324qxm,Virti86,2,Mon Apr 13 14:56:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I may consider that, because I woudn't care if running SM on such setup would ""count"" in speedrunning community, since I woudn't be able to compete with pros anyway. I have beaten SM few times casually, but I haven't learn any tricks yet, like mockball or alcatraz escape."
Metroid,324qxm,ChristianSena,2,Mon Apr 13 18:43:03 2015 UTC,"If you have any questions about it or need an NTSC crystal just throw me a message, I had to buy like a 25-pack of them so I have a lot of spares. The alcatraz escape is one of my favorites, all in all it's not that difficult to do but it feels so smooth when you nail it. And I've found that most tricks gets way easier when you're on a setup with no input lag, like a SNES console on an old CRT TV."

Metroid,321scp,Schrodingers_Cthulu,3,Fri Apr 10 20:01:01 2015 UTC,"That's surprising. I was expecting them to go with super metroid for #1 since that one seems to be more popular.   I personally would've switched echoes and corruption around. Echoes is my favorite in the series, but I think prime and super are more iconic, and well made."

Metroid,323624,AuraRyu,1 point,Fri Apr 10 12:18:37 2015 UTC,"I gotta agree.  Gameplay-wise, Other M was decent, I suppose.  No where near bad, I'd say.  The real problem with Other M was the ATROCIOUS mishandling (bordering on manhandling) of Samus as a character and Team Ninja's insistence on her armor falling off every five or so minutes like it was held together with Scotch tape just so they could sneak in a bum shot.  Her voice actress wasn't BAD, per se.  Her mission debriefings and whatnot always sounded very cut-and-dried, but I think the voice direction took it too far and she just ended up sounding disinterested in even being there, lol."

Metroid,323624,AuraRyu,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:59:11 2015 UTC,"Prime Hunters <<<<<<<<<< Other M  Seriously, Other M wasn't a good Metroid game, but at least it could be fun on its own merits. Hunters was... Just bad all around with incredibly samey environments. I was able to play Other M twice and enjoy it overall, meanwhile I've started Hunters three times and still can't force myself to beat it even once."
Metroid,323624,xwatchmanx,3,Sat Apr 11 13:35:23 2015 UTC,"Hunters's campaign was pretty bad, so as a Metroid game it sucked. It was a huge mistake to break the entire game up into little sections, with minimal platformig, followed by a (admittedly fun) boss fight, then a ""OH YOU GOTTA GET AWAY"" sequence. What were those even for? You were entirely capable of returning to the planet afterwards, so what was the point? Were reinforcements coming? Did she leave the oven on?  The multiplayer was spectacular however, and I enjoyed it quite thoroughly. It was like a portable version of Quake! It also did a lot of lore building for the franchise something it, in my opinion, did better than Other M. The different hunters it introduced were all unique with very different mechanics, and it served as a reminder that Samus isn't the only bounty hunter out there. I'd love a game that centered around Weavel or a different hunter, or Samus more directly compeating with another hunter, or maybe one with her on the run and the Federation deploying a hunter to go after her.  For the solo mode, Other M, hands down. But I like Hunters's contribution to the overall Metroid canon more that Other M's."
Metroid,323624,UboaNoticedYou,12,Sat Apr 11 14:50:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think Nintendo hates any of their franchises. Let's be honest, Metroid just doesn't do Mario and Zelda numbers when it comes to sales. That and maybe they don't have as many ideas on where to take the series. Sigh let's look at Other M as an example. It was a much more story driven game which is all well and good but it was poorly excecuted. Samus's character was not at all what it had been in previous games and the voice acting was god awful. The script was a mess and all she did was repeat  what was clearly shown to the player. The gameplay, admittedly, looked pretty decent. A third-person Metroid could abosuletly work if handled with care. But it wasn't...because of course it wasn't. Nobody wants to move a character around in a completely 3D space with a fucking D-pad. And what happened to the exploration? By far the most linear game in the series. So after the disaster that was Other M maybe Nintendo thought it would be best to take a break and come back fresh in a few years. My suggestion? They go back to what made Metroid one of the most respected video game series in the industry. The story should be in the background (and if it isn't it should be GOOD), exploration should be the main focus, if they're going to have voice acting and other characters for the love of everything flesh it out, hire good voice actors, make sure Samus doesn't monolog everything, and give us the old Samus back. Here's hoping that they reveal something Metroid related at E3 now that Zelda is out of the picture (which stings like hell tbh) and if not...well...."
Metroid,323624,SpaceWarriorSamus-,8,Fri Apr 10 05:41:30 2015 UTC,"This user gets it. Nintendo doesn't hate any of their franchises, and if anyone honestly thinks they do hate a series like Metroid, they need to quickly come to terms with the fact that Metroid is a niche series. A niche series that typically does worse in Japan than overseas -- think about that, a game that isn't received too well by their home market.  Nintendo obviously thinks Metroid has a place in its lineup, but they expect a certain quality from it, and for whatever reason -- potentially the more mature nature of the series -- that simply isn't as easy for them as a Mario or Zelda title. People need to come to terms with that and stop pushing such ridiculous notions as ""Nintendo hates Metroid""."
Metroid,323624,MonochromeTyrant,1 point,Fri Apr 10 11:29:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed with all of this. I don't know what the sales figures were for Other M, but it was always sitting around, tons of copies, whenever I poked my head in a game store. It didn't look like anyone was buying it.  I feel like Other M is the primary reason we haven't seen another Metroid for a while. They're too scared to make another one/they can't convince anyone to invest in it right now."
Metroid,323624,ladyderpette,6,Fri Apr 10 14:33:56 2015 UTC,"1/3 of the games in the series are bad. Where as the Zelda and Mario franchises have a small fraction of bad games to good games.   I disagree. The only ""bad"" game in the series IMO is Other M. Both Metroid and Metroid II are great (they just haven't aged well, a problem which is common on their respective systems) with a unique sense of being lost which adds greatly to the sense of isolation (can be confusing, but still worthwhile and great). Prime hunters was good (probably the best FPS on the DS) and while not great, it was still sufficient to be a metroid title. Prime pinball is a spinoff, which both Mario and Zelda have plenty of. And when you said that Mario and Zelda have higher ""good game to bad game ratios"" I'm not sure I agree. Zelda and Mario are both much more mainstream and as a result I don't think they've really delved in to what makes their series great. They also have tons of mediocre or only ""good"" titles, and very few ""great"" titles. Mario has essentially become Nintendo's cash cow with tons of fun but mediocre 2D platformers and spinoff sports games. Zelda is a much better series but still suffers from ""watering down"" the awesome game design aspects such as exploration and combat to make way for story and ease of play (see: Ocarina of Time, Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword). While none of these games are ""bad,"" they're certainly not masterpieces. By contrast, while Metroid has fewer titles (only 10, 11 with Pinball and 12 with Prime Trilogy) each one of those titles other than Other M and Hunters (which is still good) is fantastic. Metroid was an amazing game on the NES, Metroid II was a fantastic follow-up, Super is arguably the best game ever made, Prime is also arguably the best game ever made, Fusion kicks ass, Zero mission is also fantastic, Prime II echoes and Prime III Corruption are both incredible follow-ups to prime. While Metroid takes its time, whenever a metroid game does come out I have complete confidence whichever studio makes it will live up to the much higher standard the series has for itself (especially after the poor critical reception Other M recieved). In this regard, if we have to wait until 2017 or 2018 for another metroid, so be it. I'll still be ready for another fantastic series.  I think the reason the series receives less love is quite simple- it makes less money. And I don't fault Nintendo for this - it's just not as mainstream as Zelda or Mario, and at the end of the day, money is money. As long as they take their time to make great Metroid games, I'd be fine with the infrequency of releases.  Now, Metroid's lack of representation in Smash is another thing altogether and does piss me off, but it's really not that big of a deal."
Metroid,323624,ninjatofu1014,5,Fri Apr 10 12:54:34 2015 UTC,"Besides Retro's games, Metroid games have always been released at a very, very slow rate.   Also Return of Samus is better than the first game."
Metroid,323624,Weltall548,3,Fri Apr 10 14:43:12 2015 UTC,"I would strike II and Pinball from that list. I think Metroid II is way more playable than Metroid. And Pinball is fantastic, for what it is. It's just different."

Metroid,323624,hunter324,2,Fri Apr 10 15:59:01 2015 UTC,"I just think we're in another lull.  I remember when Metroid skipped the N64 and people wondered if we'd ever get another Metroid game.  In fact, go look at this timeline on Wikipedia.  The gap between Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion is 8 years.  Then notice that in the following 8 years, we had 9 Metroid games (of varying quality).  Now it's been 5 years since Other M (or 8 since Prime 3 if you want to count it that way) and Nintendo is struggling to decide what to do with the franchise, just like they struggled after N64.  Sure, seeing Samus in Smash may feel like we're basically putting her on life support, but when the time is right and someone has a great idea to move the Metroid series forward, they'll make a great game and we'll champion that thing like no one's business.  Until then, let Nintendo know we're waiting and then be patient.  At least, that's my plan (I gots plenty of other games to play in the meantime.)"
Metroid,323624,bj_waters,2,Fri Apr 10 21:33:31 2015 UTC,2 isn't bad at all  You need to remember this is a game for the original gameboy.

Metroid,323624,Gyper,1 point,Sat Apr 11 10:42:25 2015 UTC,"Like others say, Metroid doesn't produce the numbers that their other franchises do. It's just a sad fact. And I feel that Other M really hurt the future of the series. Still hoping to see a Metroid game for Wii U though. I feel that both a new Prime and a new side scrolling Metroid game could benefit from Wii U Gamepad capabilities.  As a side note, I'm saddened to see Metroid II and MPH on your bad list. I've wondered if this is the consensus in the Metroid community. I thought Metroid II was awesome, but I got it back in '91 when it was brand new. Maybe it just hasn't aged well. MPH controls were a bit awkward, but it's still a solid addition to the Prime series IMO."
Metroid,323624,ThatSteveGuy33,-2,Fri Apr 10 15:53:13 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say the Metroid is hated by Nintendo, however that doesn't justify some of the messed up bullshit that they have tried to push down our throats.    Yoshio Sakamoto is basically the father of the Metroid series, having been the lead producer and writer for all the Japanese made Metroid titles.  He even has credit in the Retro Studios made Prime series.  This is not really a good thing.  While Sakamoto lead the creation of one of the best Metroid titles, Super Metroid, he also lead the creation of Fusion.  Most of what people say detract from the Prime series, and Other M is the fact that those games are rather linear.  At the same time Metroid Fusion is incredibly linear, with the computer constantly telling you where to go, and roping off areas of the map until you fulfill certain requirements.  Metroid Fusion also really stinks of the terrible writing that is in Other M.  While not really all that bad, and incredibly limited to a few cut scenes in the game, such as the elevator monologues, I can still clearly see the ""whiny bitch Samus"" that we have all come to hate.  Lastly I need to remind you all of Sakamoto's betrayal of the Metroid series when he tried to retcon out the Prime series from the Metroid canon.  His reasoning boils down to that he didn't like the Prime series.  Nintendo doesn't hate the Metroid series.  Yoshio Sakamoto has just taken his child, his series and like a child hates anything that he himself didn't create.  Compound that on the fact that the Metroid series isn't even close to being a big seller when you compare it to any of the Mario games, or especially Smash Brothers, you can see why Nintendo wouldn't want to waste time on Metroid.  Mediocre sales, bad reviews, and a writer who ran his story into the ground all combines to make the Metroid series something incredibly scary for a AAA video game corporation, when you consider all the requirements a modern game needs.  Graphics alone drive the majority of budgets, because no matter who you are, you will look at the graphics of the game and judge it based on that.  Pretty games sell, and that means that an expensive video game will just run the meter up that much further, making an even bigger gamble on the dev's part.  At this point the best thing for the Metroid series might be for it to simply die.  The damage to the reputation might just get worse if Nintendo lets Sakamoto take the reigns again, turning one of the greatest video game franchises ever made into Resident Evil.  A new game regurgitated into the market just to try and get the last bit of blood from the corpse."

You're on a space ship with the woman your woman could smell like. What's in your hand? Back at me. I have it. It's an energy tank with two tickets to that thing you love.

Metroid,31ssiy,PleasePleasePepper,15,Tue Apr 7 21:54:28 2015 UTC,"It's difficult, confusing, and outdated. But if you liked the first Zelda, you'll probably enjoy Metroid NES as well. I would recommend playing Zero Mission eventually though, it's a great game and probably a better way to ease you into Metroid, but go for the NES one by all means."
Metroid,31ssiy,Wombo194,14,Tue Apr 7 22:03:35 2015 UTC,Seconding the call for Zero Mission. It's a great game that captures the feeling of the original while not being as clunky and dated.
Metroid,31ssiy,Russano_Greenstripe,5,Wed Apr 8 00:48:10 2015 UTC,I disagree. The original zelda aged a lot better than metroid 1 and is th hell of a lot more sophisticated by comparison. I love metroid 2-fusion and the prime series but it's a miracle this game became a franchise with a starting game like 1.
Metroid,31ssiy,LonelyNixon,8,Wed Apr 8 13:22:04 2015 UTC,"The original is very good for it's time, but I would stick with Zero Mission. It's just nicer to play. Try the original online, there are a few places that you can play it and if you like it then buy it.   However you shouldn't use a guide to play through the games, especially the Prime series. Exploration is a large and enjoyable part of the series, only use a guide if you are really stuck for full experience of the games. They give you hints as to where to go if you get stuck anyway."
Metroid,31ssiy,plazmablu,6,Tue Apr 7 22:05:46 2015 UTC,I would recommend turning off the hints to start with. The game became 100% better for me when I did (prime).
Metroid,31ssiy,SaffellBot,6,Tue Apr 7 22:24:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly, go for Zero Mission. It introduces some story elements that Prime brought in, it's the easiest of the 2D games, and the callbacks in Super are even better afterwards too."
Metroid,31ssiy,silverevilchao,3,Tue Apr 7 23:59:02 2015 UTC,"Try it out.  If it's too hard and you don't want to use guides, you can just play zero mission first.  A lot of the key upgrade locations are shared between the two (give or take).  When I played that game I was able to use my memories of zero mission to get a rough approximation of where to go.  Also, if you make a map as you go along the game becomes much easier.  I think the manual also had a vague overview map that will help.  Look for a pdf of that if you want."
Metroid,31ssiy,metroidman388,2,Wed Apr 8 01:08:02 2015 UTC,"The problem is I can't just try it out. If I'm getting it, I want it on virtual console, and if I don't like it I'll have wasted my coins"

Metroid,31ssiy,CrinerBoyz,3,Wed Apr 8 15:42:35 2015 UTC,"If you want a more consistent experience, go for Zero Mission. Zero Mission plays closer to Super and Fusion. The original NES Metroid plays more like the NES Kid Icarus than any of its sequels.  But if you enjoyed Zelda 1, then I think you'd do fine with the NES original because it has many of the same ""issues"" as Zelda 1 that act as a barrier for new players (no map or clear guidance for the next objective, unforgiving enemies that can pile up your damage pretty quick, spotty collision detection at times).  NES Metroid is a great NES game, it's just been outclassed by its remake. But if you're all about the 8-bit experience then I'd say go for it. Also keep in mind that Zero Mission has the NES Metroid as a hidden unlockable after you beat the game (I hope that's not too much of a spoiler) so if you buy ZM you'll get two for the price of one."
Metroid,31ssiy,RHB1027,3,Wed Apr 8 01:15:46 2015 UTC,It's a good game. Just saw lay it and find out!

Metroid,31ssiy,bj_waters,2,Wed Apr 8 02:46:23 2015 UTC,"It's mostly bearable, especially with a guide.  The level design is pretty tedious and the punishment for death is fairly steep by today's standards, but there's still plenty to find and explore if you want to go in blind.  Another big killer is the lack of an ingame map, so be prepared to make your own or use someone else's.  However, the game is still very playable, and it's easy to see all the roots of the Metroidvania-style that were refined for later installments.  While I don't know if I'd put it in my top 10 NES games, it certainly still stands as a classic."
Metroid,31ssiy,thratty,2,Wed Apr 8 03:07:48 2015 UTC,"A more talented person than I am could make a case for why it's a great game, but I love the Metroid series, and I've never enjoyed the original."

Metroid,31ssiy,segwayspeedracer1,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:34:08 2015 UTC,"Play Zero Mission first to give you an idea of where to hunt for items. Like, Kraid's level is a nightmare if you don't know where to go, since every room looks exactly the same. I don't think I would ever find the morph ball bombs without having played ZM previously.  The original is tough, but once you understand what you're doing and have a basic idea of where to go, it actually gets kinda fun. I 100% the original metroid on accident. Once you beat Kraid you'll gain momentum and have a blast.  TIP: You can't have both ice and wave beams. And I think you need ice beam to kill metroids."
Metroid,31ssiy,citizenofgaia,1 point,Wed Apr 8 08:42:52 2015 UTC,"Since the answers are pretty much saying both, I would say play Zero Mission first and then the original Metroid that you can access via Zero Mission, this way you'd save some money.

Metroid,31recd,PhazonX,27,Tue Apr 7 16:02:24 2015 UTC,"Ok let's take the most powerful Ing there is, the Emperor, and combine him with the most powerful x-parasite, the SA-X. Then we have the core take the X-emperor over, mutating it even further beyond what the Emperor had become, and how much power the SA-X had absorbed.  So we've got a creature with dark and light bending properties, can mutate into multiple known forms, and use all of Samus' abilities. You'd be looking at something maybe twice the size of the Emperor and looks like an Ing version of Samus. Maybe even something that can't be beaten."

If merely having metroid DNA in Samus made her unable to be infected, then it's not unreasonable to think that an X taking the form of an Ing would be unable to possess a metroid for similar reasons."
Metroid,31recd,GingeousC,0,Thu Apr 9 02:31:22 2015 UTC,"But the SA-X did not instantly die when attacked by larval metroids, and X-mimicking creatures did not die upon contact with Samus."

They're the counterparts to the Luminoth, instead of harnessing and worshipping the light they're creatures of darkness. It was the Leviathan that opened the gates to the different versions of Aether, but aside from that Phazon actually had little to do with the conflict in Prime 2, the only trouble it caused was attracting the Space Pirates and Dark Samus."

My brother said, NO, we're keeping this. He was never that interested in Metroid, though. A couple years later, I decided that I had to prove to myself that I could play that game.

But the main reason I can see to them not releasing games the way they release Zelda is that after Other M was a steaming pile of whatever the word you use for a turd is, and did terribly financially and critically Nintendo are probably worried about releasing a full AAA Metroid game especially with their current financial status. However because the success Metroid is having on the virtual console they will probably get around to announcing and releasing a game within a year or two."

Metroid,31nu3l,TheZets,3,Mon Apr 6 19:30:34 2015 UTC,"I love the idea of a lore series for the Metroid universe, but the pacing of your words is really distracting. I understand that it may just be the way that you talk in your everyday life, but it almost sounds as though you haven't scripted very much, and have to remind yourself every couple of seconds to keep your speed in check.   If you can manage to slow down and take your time expressing yourself, particularly in a video like this which seems to be combining serious content with lighthearted banter, then I look forward to the results.   So these are my notes:   Complete script for each video (multiple drafts. An improvisational/conversational tone can be nice, but in this context it causes awkward pauses and filler words like ""um"" or ""okay"", as well as jumping around from topic to topic which is very unprofessional) Even tone of voice (you don't need to be monotone, but definitely meter yourself. Use a metronome if you want a better idea of what consistent flow feels like) Slow it down (This goes hand-in-hand with even tone. Judging from this video, it can be very difficult for the viewer [at least in the case of myself] to discern exactly what it is that you're saying. If I can't pick out exactly what you're telling me, then I won't be as likely to tune in again even if you've really done your research) Concentrate your ideas (Make absolutely sure that each video has a coherent and specific topic or theme. DO NOT STRAY FROM THIS. If you're doing a video about Mother Brain, don't slide into a discussion about Ridley's serial reincarnations if at all possible. When writing, always come back to the question ""how does this relate to my topic?"")   I apologise if your really weren't looking for advice when making this thread, but I would absolutely love to see this series be the best that it can be. If you do have any further questions, or want to tell me just where I can stick my comments, I'd be happy to hear from you."
Metroid,31nu3l,Bespectacled_Gent,3,Mon Apr 6 21:47:45 2015 UTC,Honestly great advice and this is what i was looking for . Overall this is something thats simple for me to achieve. This video culminated into me litterally slaping together a few bullet points talking for 10 minutes and editing it down to 3.   That aside since I'm seeing amazing engagement and to do it justice I'm going to putting the best possible videos i can make near entirely to the standard of what you advice has listed.  Also that last point gave me an idea of doing individual character histories as it's own sub-series so thanks !
Metroid,31nu3l,TheDuddy,3,Mon Apr 6 22:13:39 2015 UTC,"Looks like a promising start :) As long as you have a clear structure (maybe starting off with the Metroid series timeline, and discuss what lore you'll be tackling first) then it'll be great! If you could maybe talk a little slower that would be great, we're happy to sit and watch for over 10 minutes if it means a clear video, rather than sit for 3 minutes and miss some sentences.  Great start though :)  Hope this helps."

Metroid,31pi33,Hellspark08,5,Tue Apr 7 03:38:40 2015 UTC,"Here are a few games that scratch my itch:   Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet - Imagine a 2D Metroid game where you play as a little flying saucer. Intuitive weapon/tool switching and really nice art style. Explore, kill boss, get new ability, progress. Cave Story - Jump around, explore large areas, blast at things with tight controls. Lots of action with fun story and characters. Dead Space - If Prime was gritty and grimy and scary as hell. Upgrade your weapons and unlock cool suits. I've played through it many many times. The Fall - More of a point-and-click adventure wrapped up in a sci-fi sidescroller. Brilliant ""Lone hero versus corrupt AI"" story, reminds me of Fusion. Lose your abilities at the beginning and get them back by solving unique puzzles. I included this mostly because the atmosphere seems very Metroid to me. The Swapper - Beautiful graphics, eerie atmosphere. This one is all about solving puzzles. Portal fans should appreciate these puzzles. Again, this is included mostly for the atmosphere.   I literally scrolled through my Steam library and picked games that gave me a Metroid-style experience."

There's item randomizers, room randomizers, and even full blown fan-made games in the super engine.  You can try to beat the games on hard mode (if available), or collecting 100% of the items, or trying to beat them under certain times, or beating them with the minimum amount of item pickups.

Metroid,31m845,Jammintk,3,Tue Apr 7 06:03:16 2015 UTC,"I've really been tempted to buy this, but money is tight and I'm also considering getting the Prime Trilogy which is the same price. Been rolling this around in my head since AV was released. It really does look amazing..."
Metroid,31m845,Reddaye,4,Mon Apr 6 16:00:33 2015 UTC,"The critical reception of Axiom Verge has been saying it is very good, but it is missing some of the atmosphere that is common in a metroid game.  I would suggest you get the Trillogy if you don't already have it, as it is three great metroid games that are all probably longer than Axiom Verge."
Metroid,31m845,Jammintk,3,Mon Apr 6 16:27:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I pretty well had myself convinced to get Prime Trilogy just for the sheer amount of content. I've also never played MP3, so that's an added benefit. I've wanted the Trilogy for a few years now but didn't want to pay the insane prices."
Metroid,31m845,Reddaye,3,Mon Apr 6 16:32:22 2015 UTC,"I really really want to pick this game up but I really want this on the Vita. Of course, it's cross-buy but I'm afraid that by the time the Vita version comes out I'll be all done with the game. :/"
Metroid,31m845,ImmatureIntellect,3,Mon Apr 6 17:05:20 2015 UTC,"I just bought a new 55"" TV, brought it home and play this game on it first. Its so fun and even though it's a 2-D oldschool looking game it still looks beautiful on a huge screen. I'm currently hunting down every last secret I can possibly find.   Also, if you get a chance maybe you should try entering a certain cheat code from the Metroid history and see what happens..."

Metroid,31m845,Wombo194,4,Mon Apr 6 21:17:35 2015 UTC,This game is really something else. It's funny how a brand new game can make me feel like I'm 3 years old and fucking around on my SNES on a rainy day. It's fantastic.
Metroid,31m845,Deandalecc,2,Mon Apr 6 18:32:50 2015 UTC,"Aw, only PS4 and PC? Weh. Looks like it'd be right at home on 3DS."
Metroid,31m845,Crabs4Sale,3,Mon Apr 6 21:18:58 2015 UTC,I only hope there's a new metroid title in the works that will blow this out of the water.  not very confident that's happening though.  Is retro studios working on the next installment?  Hopefully they make a 2D platformer ala super metroid to win fans back to the series.  I'm not sure they can pull it off but I'd like more games w/ that style of game play. zero mission & fusion were fun.
Metroid,31m845,Hellspark08,2,Mon Apr 6 22:16:46 2015 UTC,Waiting for it to drop on Vita... Waiting so hard.
Metroid,31m845,AtomKick,2,Mon Apr 6 22:35:23 2015 UTC,"I have been playing it on PS4 and it feels like playing a metroid game. Its fantastic, but at the same time it seems to struggle finding an identity of its own because it IS so similar to metroid. I thought maybe the whole ""drilling through the walls/ground"" thing might make it feel like a new game, but they only allow you to dig through specific tiles (that look the same as other tiles nearby) so it basically just feels like metroid where you search for the hidden tiles you can destroy with your weapon or a power bomb.  So far the boss fights seem pretty easy and a bit on the tedious side. Again I'm not very far but the couple of bosses I've faced were pretty simple. There seems to always be a ""safezone"" where you can stand and not get hit, and then the AI pattern for the boss is extremely predictable, but they have lots of health so it gets kind of tedious.  But the pixel art, for the most part, is fantastic as well as the music/general atmosphere of the game. Its a bit more story focus than metroid (reminds me of cavestory in that way) though you still feel isolated because there aren't any other humans around (that i've come across at least).  Overall if you like metroid games then you shouldn't pass this game up if you have an opportunity to play it. Honestly if they plastered samus in as the main character and called this a ""metroid"" game then I'm pretty sure it would be recieved extremely well. I definitely recommend it to everyone in this sub."

Metroid,31jwvr,2CATteam,25,Sun Apr 5 21:37:59 2015 UTC,"The environments, especially at the start, seem... wrong. Can't put my fingers on it.    The spaceship and chozo stature rooms seems more like a factory. And the Zebes envirements seems... stale and not at all 'alien' like the Super Metroid ones. Not to sure about roidley design... And a lifebar seems against the spirit of the game imo.    Still very impressive though"
Metroid,31jwvr,henryuuk,44,Sun Apr 5 21:35:24 2015 UTC,"If Nintendo were to take up a project like this, I'm sure everything would look more suitable to Super Metroid, but this guy did an exceptional job with providing an idea of what a remake for the 3DS could look like. I was pretty amazed by the whole thing."
Metroid,31jwvr,saxtasticnick,7,Sun Apr 5 22:09:29 2015 UTC,"I agree something feels off. I think part of it, is that the model for samus and the enemies seem cartoon-y and bright, while the background seemed more realistic.  Same thing with the music sort of where like the old brinstar overworld theme was used, but it was a new textured enviornemt. Plus the movement of samus was very stiff.  Don't get me wrong I think it was cool and everything, but it did just feel...off."

Metroid,31jwvr,xxHikari,5,Sun Apr 5 22:42:44 2015 UTC,"Great concept. My understanding is a single guy worked on this, and considering that, it's really good.   Obviously, it's rough around the edges. idk if OP is the creator ot not, but my biggest recommendation is to change the environments a bit. Don't just extrude the existing geometry back, create interesting variations in the rocks and cliffs as they go back. This piece of fan art is probably the best example of this, and perfectly captures the kind of atmosphere at the beginning of Super Metroid.   On this note, I tried my hand at the Maridia Bridge a couple years back. Like many of my projects, it's landed on the back burner and I haven't touched it in forever. However, I think it kind of conveys what I imagined that section of the game to be like, even if it's not yet finished. I took the time to touch it up a bit here so it's somewhat presentable, but again, far from finished."
Metroid,31jwvr,randomtroubledmind,1 point,Sun Apr 5 23:29:47 2015 UTC,"but my biggest recommendation is to change the environments a bit. Don't just extrude the existing geometry back, create interesting variations in the rocks and cliffs as they go back.   This. The rock edges look so unnatural in many places because they are trying to stick to the same shape as the 2D version. Also the breakable walls and stuff just look out of place in a 3D world."
Metroid,31jwvr,the_corruption,9,Mon Apr 6 03:33:15 2015 UTC,Animation isn't very good but I still would accept this. I would accept anything metroid that isn't other m at this point. Even pinball.

I highly doubt that they'd be happy when he releases, what is basically their game with a re-skin, under the Metroid name. No matter if it's free or not. They're still selling Super Metroid on the virtual console. They use of someone else's IP is a copyright violation, Free or not."

Metroid,31jwvr,ImurderREALITY,1 point,Mon Apr 6 01:01:02 2015 UTC,I generally prefer 2D games to still be in 2D. I would much rather see high res 2D art for a 2D Metroid especially if they were putting it on the 3DS. The game just looks much better that way compared to the low res 3D of 3DS games.

Most of the people I know who 'hate' Other M admit freely that they never played it or never played more than 5 minutes of it and simply regurgitate what they heard in a review in an attempt to be a hipster know it all asshole shithead.  I hate the Prime series with a passion, but I'll buy anything Metroid they put out and I won't bitch about it with my wallet either like every other Metroid ""fan"" when Other M turned out to not be Prime 4 and everyone got their panties in a wad."

I love the sidescrollers as well as the Prime series (definitely including hunters) and I havent played Other M yet but plan to when i finish going back through Prime again. I'll decide whether or not to hate it when I finish it.

It's definitely at the bottom of Metroid games to me, but the worst of Metroid is generally better than most other crap out there.  I never played hunters, but I just picked up a New 3ds xl, I'll have to look for a copy.  I read the lore of it a couple years back, that part always interested me."

Metroid,31jwvr,WheezingCross,0,Wed Apr 8 01:25:48 2015 UTC,"Impressive concept but the jumping looks clunky. Samus is supposed to feel light and floaty in Super Metroid. They should have stuck with the original sound effects.   Either way, entertaining nonetheless."
Metroid,31jwvr,MetroidAndZeldaFan,0,Mon Apr 6 02:52:27 2015 UTC,"I understand the desire that motivates a project like this, but this is a perfect example of what happens when you gild the lilly. So many scenes just... lacked the impact of the original. The reveal of the dead scientists and the broken cage is supposed to make you stop and go ""oh holy jesus fuck shit is real"". The eyes adjusting to the darkness and revealing Ridley right in your face is supposed to send a shiver down your spine and adrenaline through your veins. Somehow (and it isn't about animation quality) 3D just... takes the impact away."

Metroid,31kqbe,KommyKat,8,Mon Apr 6 03:09:35 2015 UTC,I fear Nintendo is only looking for main characters of popular titles. Hopefully cool characters like this are at least seriously considered. Another Metroid rep THAT ISNT ANTHONY HIGGS would be awesome.
Metroid,31kqbe,Crabs4Sale,2,Mon Apr 6 03:47:39 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with Anthony? I felt like the parts of Other M he was in were great. Doubtful they'd add rundas though, since they shun the Prime trilogy now. And what about Malcom? He was in the manga and mentioned in other Metroid games."

Metroid,31lx6u,xooxanthellae,15,Mon Apr 6 08:19:29 2015 UTC,"Echoes is kinda an interesting case-most people seem to think it's either the best in the trilogy or the worst. Regardless, I think you should try it. If you're really letting backtracking get in the way of playing a game, you're playing the wrong series."
Metroid,31lx6u,TuxedoRidley,2,Mon Apr 6 12:58:59 2015 UTC,"I've seen a lot more people have it as their second favourite than their first (I'm a 1>2>3 guy myself). MP1 is first 90% of the time, and about as many people prefer Echoes to Corruption as the other way around, usually by quite a margin too."
Metroid,31lx6u,PKThoron,9,Mon Apr 6 18:52:25 2015 UTC,"The backtracking is kind of a defining element of the entire series, though."
Metroid,31lx6u,joe_copp,2,Mon Apr 6 15:35:12 2015 UTC,Yeah this thread has made me realize that the backtracking is necessary for my favorite aspects of the game -- the non-linearity and exploration.
Metroid,31lx6u,jlgTM,6,Mon Apr 6 19:41:49 2015 UTC,"Echoes is even more back tracking than the first game.  BUT that's Metroid, you know.  I would recommend not skipping it.  It's not as good as the first prime.  But it's still awesome.  They really amped up the storytelling aspect, while still keeping the same style as the other Metroid games.  There's a lot of cool moments in Echoes, and there's some interesting mechanics, although some  people find them gimmicky and feel they get old quick.  I disagree, but that's just how opinions work.  There is little overlap between the three prime games, they all stand out on their own as they are only loosely related to each other.  I would say go ahead and give it a try, It's arguably the weakest in the prime series, but it's still a great game, and a solid entry into the series as a whole.  Oh and a final note: I'd recommend playing a few other Metroid titles before trying Other M.  If you want to understand why it's bad, you'll probably want a little more context."
Metroid,31lx6u,gnoani,1 point,Mon Apr 6 08:33:17 2015 UTC,"It's REALLY irritating that you can't start the mandatory collection nonsense until you beat the second main boss. You're not even TOLD about what you're collecting until you're on your way to that boss.  Contrast with Prime 1, which has the artifact chamber accessible from the second you land on on Tallon IV."
Metroid,31lx6u,jlgTM,2,Mon Apr 6 15:13:53 2015 UTC,"Eh, I didn't mind the collection quest.  It doesn't take THAT long, especially because by this point you are fully upgraded.  The riddles are pretty easy so it only takes a couple hours tops.  It also gives you a reason to go back and collect everything you missed, and makes you explore rooms a little deeper.  In Prime one, a lot of the artifacts you can't get your first (or even second) time through the area anyway.  It DOES feel a little arbitrary, but I don't think it's as big a flaw as people say it is."
Metroid,31lx6u,gnoani,9,Mon Apr 6 19:28:56 2015 UTC,"However, the gamecube graphics and the backtracking are wearing on me a little bit.   GAH  Prime 1 and 2 are just about the best looking games ever released for Gamecube, and Other M looks worse."
Metroid,31lx6u,gnoani,-4,Mon Apr 6 15:10:21 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I recognize that it's a beautiful game. But it is a 12-year-old game. My eyes occasionally literally hurt from playing Prime --- I think they are trying to focus to make it look HD and it ain't gonna happen.   I was considering skipping to Corruption on the assumption that the Wii graphics are better (still not HD though so still might not help my eyes...) and considering that it might not be as hard or grindy.   So Other M really looks worse than Prime 1 & 2?"
Metroid,31lx6u,fossilfern,3,Mon Apr 6 17:56:10 2015 UTC,"It does. The art style is uninspired in comparison, and the shaders suck.  Also, Dolphin. Prime looks GREAT in Dolphin, and forget what you've heard, there are no performance issues with the gamecube versions of the games. Anyone complaining about Prime 1 and 2 running like crap on powerful systems are trying to play the Trilogy rom."
Metroid,31lx6u,MC_AnselAdams,12,Mon Apr 6 17:59:14 2015 UTC,"You'd be doing yourself a disservice if you skip Prime 2, its a bloody fantastic game and its FAR better than Prime 3. I think Prime 2 captures the ""essence"" of Super Metroid slightly better than Prime 1.   Other M isn't all that bad either, its not the best but its not the worst."
Metroid,31lx6u,fossilfern,1 point,Mon Apr 6 09:58:20 2015 UTC,May I ask what you do think the worst Metroid game is? Because I agree with you that Other M isn't the worst and I feel like the only one with this unpopular opinion.
Metroid,31lx6u,MC_AnselAdams,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:33:27 2015 UTC,I didn't like Prime Hunters. It's the only Metroid game I truly didn't like.
Metroid,31lx6u,nintendobutt,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:53:47 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'm not the only one. everyone I've talked to loves Prime Hunters and I didn't get it."
Metroid,31lx6u,twinfyre,5,Tue Apr 7 01:03:44 2015 UTC,I just finished Prime 2 and I truly loved every moment of it. Even though it doesn't really make a lot of strides in the trilogy it has a lot of interesting boss battles and the lore of the planet is very nice. There is a slight improvement of graphics in MP2 as well. Its not leaps and bounds but its still better than MP.
Metroid,31lx6u,happy_pie,4,Mon Apr 6 08:36:52 2015 UTC,"in short, no  Metroid Prime 2 is quite easily my favorite game in the series, if not of all time. You'd be shooting yourself in the foot if you tried to play the Metroid Prime series and not play Metroid Prime 2."
Metroid,31lx6u,Satiie,1 point,Tue Apr 7 02:17:00 2015 UTC,I'm sure I'll get to Echoes eventually. Mainly I'm asking if it is bad to play them out of order.
Metroid,31lx6u,Reas0n,2,Tue Apr 7 03:54:05 2015 UTC,"From what I could tell, the only thing that related prime 3 and 2 was a couple of lore entries that explained what happened after you left aether, it was pretty minor. I would recommend playing them all and in order, but if you finish prime and can't wait to play another first person metroid game then just play the third (I am amsuming you own Prime 1 and 3 and don't own Prime 2). Just make sure to play them all Prime 2 was my favourite, but they are all good games  My thoughts on other m are to play super metroid and fusion (they seem to be the only games with clear ties to other m) and then play other m. I thought the other m gameplay was a little fun, but the story was mediocre if not bad."
Metroid,31lx6u,Hopper2004,14,Tue Apr 7 07:26:51 2015 UTC,"Shame on you if you do so. Prime 2 is in my opinion the best of the prime serie and is a tiny bit more beautiful than prime 1.  And wtf dude Other M is also very good, don't listen to ppl you don't know and make your own opinion of it. Yes it's kinda special and I don't want an other metroid like that cause one was enough, but it still very good."
Metroid,31lx6u,FurryWolves,9,Mon Apr 6 09:10:15 2015 UTC,I think OP has the right attitude. He knows the game is bad but he wants to try it anyway. Nothing wrong with that. The game is actually OK. The eye-rolling portrayal of Samus is what is bad.
Metroid,31lx6u,happy_pie,1 point,Mon Apr 6 12:21:51 2015 UTC,Agreed. There's a lot good with it. Just so much more bad.
Metroid,31lx6u,SomeMetroid,3,Thu Apr 9 04:57:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed, prime 2 is amazing, with an amazing mechanic that really changed how you use your beams. Prime 3 is, while still a pretty good game, a let down after the first 2 masterpieces. Also, please don't subject yourself to other m, at least until you play both super metroid and fusion, just to know what good 2d metroid games are suppose to be like!"
Metroid,31lx6u,Womackx,1 point,Mon Apr 6 10:02:48 2015 UTC,"Can you tell me what was the apeal to the limited beam ammo. Prime 2 was my favorite, but the one thing I saw as a flaw was the limited ammo. It made me discouraged from shooting the cool beams, I can only recall a few times when I actualy used the beams. I believe it's not the game, but me because my gaming peraonality is to hord all of the ammo. l  I know the game has a way of restoring ammo, but I don't know if it's efficient and still let's you have a good time with beams without running out of ammo."
Metroid,31lx6u,KingRajRajRaj,2,Tue Apr 7 07:43:28 2015 UTC,"As long as you keep enough to shoot some crates, you can use the beams pretty liberally.  I only ran into depleted ammo once or twice in my playthrough."

Metroid,31lx6u,KingRajRajRaj,3,Mon Apr 6 15:22:35 2015 UTC,"Corruption is the weakest game in the trilogy, in my opinion. Echoes is definitely a harder game, but the way Retro used scans to develop the world there was so much better than the other two games that I would say it's a must-play. It may not tie in very strongly with the 'trilogy' perse, but it's worth it."
Metroid,31lx6u,YouLookBurnt_OrDead,2,Mon Apr 6 17:07:23 2015 UTC,"Truthfully, what makes it a trilogy is its namesake, the Metroid Prime, A.K.A. Dark Samus. Everything else can pretty much be viewed as completely separate adventures.   Oh, and the discovery of Phazon to its destruction. Important."
Metroid,31lx6u,lizzychret,2,Mon Apr 6 17:21:18 2015 UTC,"Essentially, yes. My problem with Corruption is they went too far to close the narrative at the expense of nonlinearity."
Metroid,31lx6u,KingRajRajRaj,2,Mon Apr 6 17:27:10 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong. After playing through the trilogy for the second time, that aspect of it struck me a bit more than it did the first time.

Metroid,31lx6u,KingRajRajRaj,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:12:36 2015 UTC,Dark Samus is pretty bad-ass. You can't skip out on that.

Metroid,31lx6u,henryuuk,2,Tue Apr 7 03:59:27 2015 UTC,"I would say so, simply because you miss Dark Samus' introduction and so the impact of her actions in Corruption have less weight."
Metroid,31lx6u,mecha_flake,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:40:46 2015 UTC,Thanks --- you're the first person to tell me there are important plot elements introduced in Echoes that affect Corruption.
Metroid,31lx6u,AuraRyu,2,Tue Apr 7 16:42:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand where everyone else is coming from by saying there aren't any, but Echoes really does show the origin of a few important things that reappear in Corruption. It's one of those things that's easy to discount once you know Echoes' story."
Metroid,31lx6u,citizenofgaia,3,Tue Apr 7 17:01:28 2015 UTC,NO! All 3 Prime games are masterpieces.
Metroid,31lx6u,pupbleh,2,Tue Apr 7 15:02:12 2015 UTC,"It has quite a bit of backtracking and stuff. Though you could look for a walkthrough when the need for backtracking arises.  All in all though, I think it is best if you make your own decisions and opinions. On both cases.    but if you want to skip Prime 2 for the backtracking... then you might as well give up on the metroid franchise."
Metroid,31lx6u,RHB1027,2,Mon Apr 6 14:06:24 2015 UTC,"Play Echoes. It is a very different game from Prime. It's my least favorite of the three but it has a lot of merit, least of which is conveying to the player how absolutely fearless Samus is. There is a lot of creepy shit in Prime 2.  Also, don't peg Other M as a bad game before you play it. It's not a bad game. It's a good game with some significant flaws but those are almost entirely due to a story that was written without much editorial oversight. The core gameplay and visuals are a blast."
Metroid,31lx6u,JabNX,2,Mon Apr 6 14:07:03 2015 UTC,"The only Metroid game whose story is hard to understand is the one not supposed to be understood, aka Other M."
Metroid,31lx6u,megamarth96,2,Mon Apr 6 14:54:37 2015 UTC,"Every Metroid has backtracking (except other m ,but I don't consider it a ""metroid metroid"" game).  Echoes is a lot harder than prime, the backtracking can be even more dificult because of the switching worlds.  My advice is not to go straight to Corruption (wich also has backtracking), but to play something else instead, something colorful and happy and simple and fun, and THEN go into the very suffocating and claustrophobic world of Prime Echoes, I swear I felt anxiety playing that game the first time, and if that tells you something, it is that it has one hell of an atmosphere.  Also it has Quadraxis, one of the best boss battles ever."
Metroid,31lx6u,megamarth96,3,Mon Apr 6 14:59:53 2015 UTC,"Damn, if only they had colorful happy simple fun games on the Wii U....  ;)"

Metroid,31lx6u,Melos555,2,Mon Apr 6 15:02:46 2015 UTC,"I just beat Prime and have the same decision to make. Personally, I'm on a mission to beat all of the games at least once, but folks keep saying how much of a grind Echoes can be. I guess it makes sense to go in order so I'm gonna do it. I have a feeling the reward of beating it will be worth the grind!"
Metroid,31lx6u,mrabrickwall,1 point,Mon Apr 6 15:43:24 2015 UTC,"I got the Trilogy back in January when it was at 10 euros on the Wii U and I decided to do all three games in a row last month. I already had them on GC/Wii but I didn't touch them for 6 or 7 years at least.  What I can say for sure is that Echoes is the best of the bunch, by far. The game design blows the original out of the water, the boss design is just 100 better (not even kidding on that one) and the progression makes more sense (especially the power-up order, as well as the map layout).  Backtracking is easier than Prime since all areas are connected with each other and have a more ""conventional"" layout. I'm not really sure that you have more of it in Echoes like everybody says. I'd say about the same.  Beam ammo are a wonderful idea because consequently, beams can be much more powerful. So you feel more powerful. It's an important part of any Metroid game and Echoes is the best when it comes to achieving an end-game fantasy (Annihilator Beam + Screw Attack ftw).  And you got this atmosphere too. Prime felt like a walk in the park next to Echoes.  Corruption is kind of a let down after it, because it is trying really hard to ""fix"" the apparent issues of Echoes. Which had none, sadly. Consequently you get an easier game, with more linear zones, few backtracking and fewer isolation. It's still an amazing game, with neat gameplay ideas, but far from the greatness of the two previous installments. The simplification of the arsenal is my main problem with the game though (no super missile ? no alternate beams ? why ? hypermode's not enough ! why do I have 250 missiles that I have no use for ? why do my energy tanks have no use for the final battle ?)"
Metroid,31lx6u,claytonfikes,2,Wed Apr 8 20:39:29 2015 UTC,"prime one and two are absolutely great, other M is not a bad game at all, the reason that it gets so much flack is because of the portrayal of samus being absolutely awful and the dialogue tearing apart the timeline of games, otherwise the game play is really fun"

Metroid,31lx6u,SupaStaVince,2,Mon Apr 6 22:37:50 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Echoes is the worst of the Prime trilogies, no contest really.  But, it's still a great game.  And honestly, there are so few great Metroid games to play, that it would be  (again, imo) terrible to skip it.  It should definitely be played with the others!"
Metroid,31lx6u,Vittas_Nichye,2,Mon Apr 6 16:31:00 2015 UTC,Usually the backtrackings pain is mitigated by the beautiful environments and the music. I'd say not to worry at all when you play.
Metroid,31lx6u,Walfo1,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:35:01 2015 UTC,The backtracking is also what allows for the non-linearity and the exploration. So I realize it is both my least and most favorite aspect of the game haha.
Metroid,31lx6u,TurboRex300,2,Mon Apr 6 19:21:46 2015 UTC,if the backtracking and graphics are getting tiring I'd recommend just taking a little break after Prime (maybe a week or 2) and then go to echoes. MP3C doesn't require prior knowledge of the story but playing them in linear order is how to recommend.but if you really just want to play it right now i'd  go for 3 after priem 1.echoes is pretty much more of the same but corruption (for better or worse)is a lot different
Metroid,31lx6u,LSD001,1 point,Tue Apr 7 02:05:33 2015 UTC,This helps. I think I want something a little different. I can always go back to Echoes.

Metroid,31kw49,FlyingRep,16,Mon Apr 6 01:29:30 2015 UTC,"A game's backstory shouldn't be based almost entirely off of an obscure, nearly unknown piece of media, ever. And it didn't even follow it anyways. Not a single mention of the word ""Chozo"" but plenty of drooling over Mr. Gray Adam.   Even just a good K2-L flashback would have made the Ridley thing acceptable, but we're instead supposed to be okay with Samus turning into a little girl and shitting herself at the sight of an enemy she routinely throws down with. No context. What an embarrassment."
Metroid,31kw49,The_M4G,0,Mon Apr 6 02:55:26 2015 UTC,"It probably WAS based on a decently well known backstory. You have to think, culture and media was a LOT more limited in 1986 (The original release of the first metroid game) so unless you lived in japan in 1986 there is no real way of knowing how well known the media was.  The current internet we have today did not exist then, there was no real way of establishing international culture and media connection. So for all we know it really WAS known quite a lot, and since it's been 30 years since then, nobody is gonna go ""Hey we just made our fifth game of the series, just want you guys to know weve been basing our series off this 30 year old manga"". No, they probably established that from the start, and assumed everyone knew about it all the way through.  EDIT: As I've said before, I'm not DEFENDING the game, it had ATROCIOUS execution, but I see the motivation and justification behind it."
Metroid,31kw49,ThreeTwenty320,6,Mon Apr 6 02:58:52 2015 UTC,The manga didn't come out until 2003 though.
Metroid,31kw49,InsanityRaptor,7,Mon Apr 6 03:18:55 2015 UTC,"Hm. Well. We all know the manga takes place before the games, right? Samus suffering PTSD in the manga makes complete and total sense. Her suffering PTSD in Other M is completely stupid. Look at the Metroid timeline. Other M is right at the end, just behind Fusion. That means Samus faced Ridley four times before Other M. Another thing worth mentioning is she got over her fear near the end of the manga. Then she faced Ridley four times. The whole PTSD would make sense with literally anything else, besides Ridley!"
Metroid,31kw49,InsanityRaptor,3,Mon Apr 6 01:50:48 2015 UTC,"Also, while I know Samus said that Other M was here first mission after becoming a freelance bounty hunter (which would delete the Prime games from the timeline), it'd still not work because she still faced Ridley the original Metroid and Super Metroid. Why didn't she have suffer PTSD in Super Metroid, when she supposedly killed Ridley in the original Metroid? The PTSD in Other M is stupid. They tried to add depth to a Samus in a terrible way. I love the idea of Samus suffering PTSD, especially how they executed it in the manga. But in Other M it's just not necessary or realistic."
Metroid,31kw49,GotACoolName,-2,Mon Apr 6 01:56:30 2015 UTC,"I added a comment a little bit ago, but I had something else to say as well.  If you seperate it into two timelines, they both make sense, but you can't put them into one timeline.  Sakamoto's timeline (Without any of Retro's games) makes sense, showing her with PTSD  Retro's timeline makes sense because she fights the space pirates and Ridley just happens to be a reoccurring antagonist.  EDIT: There's no real way of knowing whether she suffers PTSD in super metroid or not, because there is never any indication of her speaking (outside of opening text in very beginning)"
Metroid,31kw49,InsanityRaptor,3,Mon Apr 6 02:06:14 2015 UTC,"Sakamoto's timeline (Without any of Retro's games) makes sense, showing her with PTSD   It doesn't. Even discounting Prime and Prime 3, in which she's done far more courageous things than fighting Ridley, she fought him at the very least in her first mission and in Super Metroid. Why would the third instance trigger her but not the first two? And no, she didn't have an anxiety attack in Super Metroid. If she did, there would be some indication -- body language, hesitation, anything. Spoken word is only one form of communication, and she was alone throughout Super Metroid, so it wouldn't make sense for her to be monologuing to nobody (like Other M does sigh)."
Metroid,31kw49,InsanityRaptor,1 point,Mon Apr 6 10:11:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah but, if she did. Or if Nintendo says she did, that'd be really stupid. That'd the biggest retcon ever. I'd be kinda pissed."
Metroid,31kw49,Wombo194,-1,Mon Apr 6 02:14:55 2015 UTC,"You also have to remember that they don't consider the Prime series or Retro's games canon for this reason, he didn't believe that she faced Ridley so many times and that she followed a different path, because it WOULD conflict with his vision.  So he made her this way with that in mind. Also, she (In my perspective) believes it's all finally over when Ridley is finally killed in Super Metroid, then when she finds out there is a clone is utterly horrified, relapsing in her PTSD."

Metroid,31kw49,leigonlord,3,Mon Apr 6 02:08:47 2015 UTC,"But Fusion is right after Other M. But yeah, in Metroid and Super Metroid. Why didn't she have PTSD in Super Metroid?"
Metroid,31kw49,leigonlord,0,Mon Apr 6 02:13:20 2015 UTC,"Fusion is the last game of the series, so it is POSSIBLE that she has gotten over her PTSD.  She is still outraged that they had a ridley clone IIRC with a conversation with Adam the computer  I'm not saying that Other M is now a masterpiece nor am I defending it, I'm just saying that it makes a little bit of sense now that I see their motive.  I agree they did take it too far with the PTSD, as ""Oh some falling water, this triggers a memory I had with Ridley"" and they just took it way overboard."
Metroid,31kw49,InsanityRaptor,2,Mon Apr 6 02:11:51 2015 UTC,"You don't just get over PTSD though, I doubt she could have improved her disorder in the 1 or 2 years between Other M and Fusion.   I get the motivation too, good characters have flaws and weaknesses and Sakamoto attempted to give her one through Ridley, but it really should have been different. Like a lot of things with Other M, good idea/concept, terrible execution."

Metroid,31hv4n,MonochromeTyrant,3,Sun Apr 5 07:09:04 2015 UTC,"I'll mirror my YouTube comment here to prove your point:  Pay close attention to the hit counter during the first and second combos. Samus' A-A jab attack doesn't actually have enough hit stun to chain into the second hit, and can be shielded between blows, making her vulnerable to an out-of-shield attack with higher priority. Don't try that in an actual match, or you WILL get hit.﻿"
Metroid,31hv4n,PresidentMagikarp,1 point,Sun Apr 5 12:32:38 2015 UTC,"I did realize this, too. But it shows good uses for the new neutral air that I had not thought of before, and I had also never thought about leading with an up air to start a combo. I would always tend to either dash attack or go for a grand and then forward air or up air. Either way, these are actually pretty good combos you should at least try to learn to improve your playing. I've already found good uses for all of them."

Metroid,31goz4,bj_waters,3,Sun Apr 5 04:45:53 2015 UTC,"Echoes is my least favorite of the trilogy, but I still love all three. Echoes loves to send you to the other side of the planet for the next objective and then send you on a hunt for keys spread across the entire planet just like the chozo artifacts."
Metroid,31goz4,Alsenis,5,Sun Apr 5 06:41:21 2015 UTC,"The time is super long because my son just loved exploring for hours on end.   Raising that kid right, I see. Good man.   I'm playing the Wii Trilogy version on disc and heard that version is a little easier so we'll see.   Mostly, it's just that one of the bosses got a nerf in the damage output department, since said boss was a bit ridiculous in the original GameCube release. Echoes in general is still a fair bit harder than the first Prime."
Metroid,31goz4,MisterDoubleYum,4,Sun Apr 5 00:33:22 2015 UTC,Just playing through Echoes myself on GameCube. Is the boss you're talking about Boost Guardian? Cause he was insane.
Metroid,31goz4,AndrewToth,5,Sun Apr 5 01:51:54 2015 UTC,"It is indeed the boost guardian. IIRC, he does almost a full energy tank if he hits you in his boost ball mode, and the fact that there's no light zone doesn't help. He was toned down a bit in the Wii version."
Metroid,31goz4,KedovDoKest,1 point,Sun Apr 5 03:19:33 2015 UTC,Man he was frustrating. I'm about to face Quadraxis and I'm pumped. So far I really enjoyed Echoes.
Metroid,31goz4,AndrewToth,1 point,Sun Apr 5 08:15:02 2015 UTC,"I still died a few times in the Wii version. I think the Spider Guardian is supposed to be a lot easier in the Wii version, because of the spring ball."
Metroid,31goz4,TerryCavanagh,2,Mon Apr 6 02:23:19 2015 UTC,Eeyup. He hits waaaay too hard for how early in the game he shows up in the original.

Metroid,31goz4,Swaggerlisk,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:04:33 2015 UTC,"I remember playing Prime with my dad when I was 6 years old. It was actually almost 12 years ago to the day. Still probably my favorite game, not only due to the quality but also the sentimental value it has. I'll be playing it until the end of time, and it warms me heart to see that even after all these years kids and their dads are playing it together. My greatest fear is that it will fade into obscurity before I can show it to my (hypothetical) children."
Metroid,31goz4,Pelicanesis,2,Sun Apr 5 21:19:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know what you mean. My son and I experienced Prime together which is awesome, but it's more awesome to watch him play Super Metroid essentially on his own and to try and help him through it. Part of me wants to let him figure it out on his own like I did, but the dad in me enjoys having the answers. :)"

It was really difficult on my first playthrough, so I had to come up with a different approach than what I usually do in Metroid Prime. I had to conserve missiles, find places to hide in and other things like that. That's the thing I like about the hard parts. They force you to shake things up and change your strategies."

These games aged very well is all I can think about.  Prime was ahead of its time in graphics that is for sure.
Metroid,31am4k,Madstoni,1 point,Fri Apr 3 19:47:19 2015 UTC,I did it ! But its really laggy for unkown reason.. And i got a warning from my internet provider and Nintendo for copyrights ..

Unless you used bittorrent to download an iso of mp-trilogy and sent proof of you doing so to nintendo and your prvider,  there is no way in hell that you got a warning."

One day i was selling an Acekard 2i on kijiji  and nintendo e-mailed me to delete my ad or they gonna sue me .."
Metroid,31am4k,GotACoolName,2,Sat Apr 4 00:48:49 2015 UTC,"If you used thepiratebay,  that explains it.  You shouldn't use bittorrent to download things unless you use a VPN.  I recommend you  to get a premium account for a filehoster (uploaded,  rapidgator,  uploadable,...)."
Metroid,31am4k,Coldstripe,1 point,Sat Apr 4 02:20:56 2015 UTC,"Warning from your internet provider?  As for lag there are a number of setting you might have to tweak to get them to run smooth.  Anti-aliasing should be off because it goes crazy slow with any rain particles and it turned on.  Play with the internal resolution settings.   Auto is usually what I do but if the game is slow (<60 fps) then turn it down to like 2x or even 1.5x.  In Prime 2 you have to turn EFB to RAM else you will have visor issues.  I couldn't scan doors which you need to progress.  Also with save states.  They do not work (sound goes out, graphics glitch, etc.) unless you have the game loaded.  I think it has to do with how the assets are in memory."
Metroid,31am4k,Shockie_,3,Fri Apr 3 20:53:43 2015 UTC,"I remember the summer this game came out I had never played a Metroid game before but I recognized it from having played Samus in Smash Bros, so I figured I'd give it a pre-order. Now it's worth double what I payed and has three of my all-time favorite games on it :) Congrats on getting a copy! It's a great collector's item."
Metroid,31am4k,Noahtheboatguy69,3,Sat Apr 4 00:07:36 2015 UTC,My biggest complaint with Trilogy is that it doesn't have the original games' menus. You don't get the proper introductions. :(

Metroid,31am4k,mecha_flake,5,Fri Apr 3 15:20:59 2015 UTC,I am trying to. I am on my 4th or 5th attempt to actually finish the game. I love the themes and the setting can be genuinely creepy at times but the execution just lacks the intuitiveness of Prime 1 or the segmented nature of Prime 3.
Metroid,31am4k,mecha_flake,6,Fri Apr 3 15:29:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe that's why it's my favorite in the series. there's much less handholding, and it's a lot harder. I've already done a 100% run. One of these days I should do a no hint run."

Metroid,31c59j,V0ID115,6,Fri Apr 3 18:29:01 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about combat in general or boss fights? Personally, I see it as a way to break up the ""tedium"" of exploration and give more background to the world and story (note: I love the exploration aspect of Metroid, I simply couldn't think of a better word). While the smaller enemies may be take-it-or-leave-it cannon fodder, I love boss battles, and I would be disappointed to see either absent."
Metroid,31c59j,MonochromeTyrant,4,Fri Apr 3 19:58:28 2015 UTC,"To me they're the second most important aspect only after exploration. They serve as stepping stones along the way, beating a boss makes you feel like you've truly made some progress and all the exploration has paid off. The franchise's most memorable moments also come from boss battles. Mother Brain in SM, Meta Ridley in Prime, Nightmare in Fusion, etc."

Metroid,31c59j,InsanityRaptor,2,Sun Apr 5 07:17:10 2015 UTC,"It's extremely important for the Prime series, almost on par with exploration. In Metroid it's second to exploration. Metroid is known for using weak spots right? Weak spots were executed perfectly in all the Prime games. In games like Super Metroid and Fusion it's basic. Not bad. Disappointing maybe, but that's just what I think. It's also worth mentioning that in my experiences with Metroid, boss fights are like rewards. Rewards for exploring, rewards for overcoming platforming challenges. The more missiles you find, the easier the fights are. It may sound stupid, rewarding the player with less gameplay, but some of the bosses are really hard. It's also very satisfying to shove hundreds of missiles into Ridley's stupid space dragon face (refer to my flair for an example). But I believe a Metroid game without combat, isn't a Metroid game at all. Keep in mind, I draw this from Super Metroid, the original Metroid's whole deal was platforming mixed with combat. Exploration was essential, that game was hard as fuuu! The original Metroid was layered like this: exploration was what mattered the long run. Combat and platforming was the challenge the player experienced during the game, which is why I think the original Metroid is better to pick up and player than any other Metroid game, other than Metroid Fusion. Combat and platforming was a challenge. Like hard as fuck. There I cursed. Happy? I love Metroid."
Metroid,31c59j,InsanityRaptor,2,Sat Apr 4 01:46:31 2015 UTC,They're just as important as exploration to me.

I've been playing a lot of the Metal Gear Solid series, and those games know how to present a boss. They're chock full of little secrets and alternate strategies, so there are many different experiences to be had."

Much more rewarding than just blindly facerolling the super missile button.  EDIT: Typos and whatnot."
Metroid,31c59j,MisterDoubleYum,1 point,Sat Apr 4 15:59:36 2015 UTC,"They add a sort of ""purpose"" to exploring. Getting an Energy Tank is satisfying for two reasons:   Reason 1: You found a secret and that's satisfying.  Reason 2: You won't get your balls rocked when you fight foes.  I almost would say that most of Metroids items are so great because they have both an explorative and a combative purpose. Take the Screw Attack for example. The reason it wasn't as cool in Prime 2 compared to the other games is simple: It lost its combat application. The enemies throughout the game were not designed to be beaten with the Screw Attack, so it feels less empowering than when you get it in the other games and you become a ball of death. I think that Metroid would lose the feeling of gratitude one gets from acquiring items if they dropped combat. I'd say combat is very important to the Metroid formula, and it wouldn't be as good without it, as your increase in strength wouldn't be as noticeable without combat."
Metroid,31c59j,Flaborized,1 point,Sun Apr 5 04:40:07 2015 UTC,"They were amazing in the Metroid Prime games, but not so much in the 2D series. They were sort of tedious sometimes.  But in terms of actual enemies, I think they're absolutely important; a room that you once had to traverse carefully becomes a breeze once you have a certain new item, and it definitely makes exploration all the more worthwhile."
Metroid,31c59j,1vs,1 point,Sun Apr 5 13:13:46 2015 UTC,"Not super important as far as regular enemies go. I like there being some strategy involved and there being some intense encounters but it's not the defining aspect of metroid. However, metroid has some of the most iconic bosses in gaming so they must always have that wow factor."

Metroid,319n0t,Redarmygeneral117,11,Fri Apr 3 02:35:45 2015 UTC,I'd rather have a more fleshed out and recognizable character for Metroid representation.
Metroid,319n0t,SpaceWarriorSamus-,3,Fri Apr 3 03:27:05 2015 UTC,"Like who? (Besides Ridley, he's already a stage hazard/boss)"
Metroid,319n0t,legonro,7,Fri Apr 3 10:33:44 2015 UTC,"space pirate (alt skins would be all of the designs), sheegoth, crocomire, mini kraid, chozo, luminoth, ing, rundas, gandrayda, ghor, etc etc too many good choices"
Metroid,319n0t,legonro,5,Fri Apr 3 12:41:52 2015 UTC,"I could see a chozo, crocomire is way too big, and the rest are about as well known as Sylux to the general public."
Metroid,319n0t,SpaceWarriorSamus-,4,Fri Apr 3 19:21:35 2015 UTC,"well its not like shulk, marth, ike, olimar and company were really widespread family-fun characters before smash"
Metroid,319n0t,KarjarA,4,Fri Apr 3 22:41:13 2015 UTC,"True, but there's no reason any of the metroid cast is a better or worse choice than sylux. I think since the end of prime 3 had (presumably) Sylux chasing Samus. I'd personally love to see Weavel, but that's just me."
Metroid,319n0t,Cerderius,3,Fri Apr 3 22:51:31 2015 UTC,"Like I said before, Dark Samus immediatly comes to mind. Chozo like Old Bird, Grey Voice, and Platinum Chest could work. Yeah they mainly appear in manga but they're still named, and more fleshed out and in fact a bigger part of Samus's life and by extension the Metroid universe as a whole. Mother Brain and Kraid suffer the same problem as Ridley unfortunately. Any other villian hasn't appeared enough in the series or is too generic. That's just my opinion though. I guess it's not my place to be so picky because Metroid representation of any kind would be a blessing."

Metroid,319n0t,Chip--Chipperson,3,Fri Apr 3 03:12:25 2015 UTC,DARK SAMUS
Metroid,319n0t,FallenWind,3,Fri Apr 3 14:33:25 2015 UTC,"IMO it's got to be Kraid or an Omega Metroid. Like the one at the end of Fusion. Though the only potential problem is people will say ""KRAID'S JUST A BOWSER CLONE"". Or a zeta metroid that evolves into an omega for it's final smash. Ionno I'm just spitballin' here. Maybe even Ghor...his specials summon additional machines for him to pair with and give him different abilities."
Metroid,319n0t,icemanvvv,6,Fri Apr 3 16:46:36 2015 UTC,eh.. i hated the other bounty hunters in metroid.... im fine with the smash bros representation.
Metroid,319n0t,alkyjason,2,Fri Apr 3 03:25:42 2015 UTC,"Why not Dark Samus? Reconisable, completely different moveset than Samus, endless possibilities"
Metroid,319n0t,MrTimnTheGreat,2,Fri Apr 3 16:40:39 2015 UTC,That's because Dark Samus is already a character you can get from an Assist Trophy. Also the fact that Samus has a Dark Samus skin.
Metroid,319n0t,SamusAranX,2,Fri Apr 3 17:12:19 2015 UTC,"in my opinion, to get a new metroid character, it needs to fit the smash vibe.  Stylux doesnt really."
Metroid,319n0t,Wind123,2,Fri Apr 3 17:10:23 2015 UTC,Maybe SA-X?
Metroid,319n0t,Nintendan95,5,Fri Apr 3 09:43:25 2015 UTC,SA-X is literally just a copy of Samus. We have enough duplicates in Smash.

Metroid,318vx2,PowerForward,3,Fri Apr 3 16:27:30 2015 UTC,I voted Rundas. If we get anyone from Metroid I'll be happy though.
Metroid,318vx2,NightSwipe,3,Fri Apr 3 02:15:44 2015 UTC,I think that Dark Samus has a better defined moveset that has enough differences that she wouldn't be a clone.
Metroid,318vx2,Wccnyc,0,Fri Apr 3 03:50:29 2015 UTC,"As much as Dark Samus would seem to be a good candidate due to her importance in the Metroid saga and not being of an outrageous size, she probably wouldn't work. The only other Metroid ""character"" besides Samus is Samus without the Power Suit. Dark Samus, while she wouldn't have the same moveset, being a levitating Phazon being, is a literal clone of Samus. I don't want all 3 playable Metroid characters to all be Samuses. There's more to Metroid than just Samus, it's not a one-dimensional series. 2 Samuses were enough. Three is outrageous."
Metroid,318vx2,Jammintk,3,Fri Apr 3 04:57:32 2015 UTC,"You could easily change her enough though. As an example:  Down special: Boost Ball, move forward at high speed for a moderate distance, or down at a 45 degree angle in the air. Dark Samus will bounce off of enemies. When using this move.  Neutral special: Spread Beam (chargeable) firing immediately will make a more focused shot that does less damage, while the charged version fires in a large cone and does more damage. Overall range is less than regular Samus's Charge Beam.  Up special: phazon charge (aimable) Dark Samus pauses for a moment in midair, then charges a set distance in the direction the control stick is held.  Side special: seeker launcher (chargeable) using side B without charging fires a Phason infused missile that is slightly faster than regular samus's missile, but not as fast as super missiles. It also homes in on the closest enemy in front of dark samus slightly. Charging the seeker launcher allows for up to five missiles to be shot. They will prioritize multiple targets if they are available, but if not, will try to hit the same target."
Metroid,318vx2,citizenofgaia,3,Fri Apr 3 20:00:18 2015 UTC,"After thinking about it for a day, I think Rundas would be an excelent addition to the game.   He is BIG, around Bowser size, wich the game lacks (people are also suggesting King Kroll for the same reason) He manipulates ice! No Ice Climbers means no ice and no frozen fighters, Rundas could fill that gap and add some new mechanics to the game. He would add to an underrepresented franchise, other than Samus and Samus, there are no other Metroid characters, and this would be from the best trilogy ever (not that there are many to choose from anyway). His voice and personality are badass, he can surf on the ice he creates! (how cool is that!). His battle theme is absolutely awesome.   edit: also this  || I would also love to see Shovel Knight in, the Inklings (they are so cool!) and Bayonetta."
Metroid,318vx2,Koog330,3,Fri Apr 3 16:59:46 2015 UTC,I'd rather Anthony Higgs. Other M had a lot of problems but he wasn't one of them.
Metroid,318vx2,KarjarA,6,Fri Apr 3 02:14:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe its just me, but I dont find him that exciting. I`d rather play as one of those legendary hunters, or Dark Samus, instead of some random marine. His personaity was awesome, but I think a marine would be boring"
Metroid,318vx2,Koog330,1 point,Fri Apr 3 12:04:10 2015 UTC,"Understandable. Me wanting to see him in Smash has less to do with his character and personality and more to do with him adding more of the Metroid flavor to Smash Bros. As it stands, the series is represented by Samus alone, and the Galactic Federation is a well known entity in the Metroid universe. Higgs would be a solid choice because he adds that representation and that flavor, in my opinion."
Metroid,318vx2,henryuuk,2,Fri Apr 3 12:30:44 2015 UTC,I remember him !
Metroid,318vx2,twinfyre,7,Fri Apr 3 09:31:41 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind having rundas as a playable character. Though I don't think he's as iconic as Ridley is. So I think I'll cast my lot with Ridley.
Metroid,318vx2,SamusAranX,5,Thu Apr 2 23:17:27 2015 UTC,they've literally already said that Ridley won't ever be in smash because a) he's too big and b) they wouldn't be able to represent his flying fight style in smash
Metroid,318vx2,Chubs22095,1 point,Fri Apr 3 05:13:20 2015 UTC,"I think a main reason they won't put Ridley in this smash bros game is because he is already a part of the Pyrosphere stage. Sure they could just have multiple Ridley's, but it would be weird."
Metroid,318vx2,twinfyre,1 point,Fri Apr 3 07:56:49 2015 UTC,"Do you really think weak arguments like that are good reasons?   Sakurai has lied in the past and he'll do it again. Remember when he said smash wouldn't have dlc? Olimar and kirby got resized. Ridley can get one too. Kirby flies, pit flies, charizard flies, and meta knight flies."
Metroid,318vx2,KarjarA,1 point,Fri Apr 3 05:17:24 2015 UTC,"Im pro Ridley, but your second argument doesnt count. Its the proportion. Ridley is menacing, and to achieve that, he doesnt have to big, just a lot BIGGER than his enemies. Kirby and Olimar do look fine, Ridley would have to be the biggest character in Smash. But I dont think thats a bad thing, that could even part of his gameplay. Ridley could be one of the fastes, strongest and most knockback-ish characters, but as a weakness, he is extremly easy to combo and easy to kill since he could be a lightweight. Ridley looks great in a project M mod for him, he just needs some better animations, which is not to hard for the Smash team. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcamzupKKWw"
Metroid,318vx2,twinfyre,3,Fri Apr 3 12:10:26 2015 UTC,"I'll have to disagree with you there. True, Ridley's size is intimidating, but for me it's always seemed like he was a bit more than a large glass cannon. The reason Ridley is such a strong enemy is because he has intelligence equal to or greater than a human. I think Ridley could be the size of Bowser and he'd still work as a character.   As for resizes, the fact that they can resize olimar to be slightly smaller than most characters proves that they can resize Ridley to be slightly larger than most characters."
Metroid,318vx2,KarjarA,2,Fri Apr 3 12:23:19 2015 UTC,"Ill have to disagree too, I always thought Ridley is menacing because of his size and look, but thats just my opinion"
Metroid,318vx2,henryuuk,-1,Fri Apr 3 12:37:50 2015 UTC,Commenting for when I'm home
Metroid,318vx2,twinfyre,3,Fri Apr 3 09:31:18 2015 UTC,Very well. I accept your challenge. I look forward to it even. I've been waiting for Ridley for far to long and I know every argument in the book. I could take all of you Ridley haters on if I wanted to.
Metroid,318vx2,henryuuk,0,Fri Apr 3 19:27:59 2015 UTC,"First falacy : I am not a Ridley hater, I am merely not a Ridliever as yourself. I want Ridley in the game myself, but I have not succumbed to using fake arguments, straw-man and sweeping generalizations to pretend to get my point. That said, when I read this on my cellphone, it seemed to be a longer comment. Looks like I was mistaken.     Sakurai has lied in the past and he'll do it again. Remember when he said smash wouldn't have dlc?     Sakurai never said there wouldn't be DLC, he merely said he wasn't convinced of the concept and they weren't working/planning on it back then. There is no proof to mention he/they were lying when that statement was made. The closest thing to a 'lie' they MIGHT have done, is that Mewtwo was the only one they were making at that point, however that seemed to have been mostly to make the : ""Lucas comes out of nowhere"" joke fit even more. And could still technically be correct. In both cases it is hardly comparable to them saying they tried, but weren't able to make a satisfying ridley concept going.   Olimar and kirby got resized. Ridley can get one too.   AAAAH the eternal fallacy of the ridliever, I almost started to miss it when it was revealed he wasn't in SM4SH. See, the issue here isn't so much that you are wrong, in fact you are quite right about that.    The issue is that you are making the wrong statement. Kirby, olimar, meta knight, Dedede and so forth all got a nice scaling up, yes. But so did the rest of their franchise fighters. Kirby,MetaKnight and Dedede are all still comparatively the same size to each other . In the same vain, Mario and Bowser are the same size to eachother as when bowser isn't boosted by some powerstar or kamek magic    With Ridley and Samus, this doesn't work. Samus is already amongst the highest characters in the game thanks to being a pretty big/long human and having her suit on. It also wouldn't be a minor change of height like with TP ganondorf~TP Link vs Brawl ganondorf~Brawl Link, but rather would mean scaling Ridley down to about half his size or smaller.    Also, Sakurai actually never said he was to big, but said his design didn't fit being made to fit. His big wings, long tail and thin arms in between would have to be redesigned, which he doesn't like to do with a character that isn't outdated.     Kirby flies, pit flies, charizard flies, and meta knight flies.     I'll actually admit I don't fully agree with the : ""Ridley's way of fighting wouldn't be comparable"" that Sakurai gives. Mostly because seevral characters fight different tbh. Ganondorf is actually never slow in his own game, he just walks menacingly, but as soon as he tries to strike, most of the time ganondorf are atleast decently fast.  Though I do have to say that : Kirby and dedede don't fly, they ""hover/float"" by inhaling so much air. Their aerial mobility in both smash and in their own universe is hardly comparable to someone like Ridley. Last time Meta Knight was given as much 'flying ability' as in his franchise he became a god. Pit actually CAN'T fly on his own, AT ALL. It's all magic that only works temporary  Charizard can fly in the pokemon franchise, and is pathetic in smash. And I think that might be partly what Sakurai meant, they wouldn't be able to make him fly freely like Ridley can do in metroid, and it might end up looking pathetic. (Personally I actually do think Charizard's aerial limits are sorta stupid seeing as he is the only flying type pokemon playable in smash )    But like I said at the start, I actually do think the : ""He has to FLY!!!"" Sakurai mentions is either a bit nitpicky, or just a small part he decided to say as a big point.    Personally I fully accept Ridley COULD be done. But I also accept that some things SHOULDN'T be done."
Metroid,318vx2,twinfyre,1 point,Sat Apr 4 06:41:06 2015 UTC,"You my friend are my favorite type of person. You are so convinced that your argument has no holes in it whatsoever. This is going to be so much fun.   I want Ridley in the game myself, but I have not succumbed to using fake arguments, straw-man and sweeping generalizations to pretend to get my point.   Cool. Neither have I.    Sakurai never said there wouldn't be DLC, he merely said he wasn't convinced of the concept and they weren't working/planning on it back then.   Fair enough. I suppose I'll give you that one.    Kirby, olimar, meta knight, Dedede and so forth all got a nice scaling up, yes. But so did the rest of their franchise fighters. Kirby,MetaKnight and Dedede are all still comparatively the same size to each other . In the same vein, Mario and Bowser are the same size to eachother as when bowser isn't boosted by some powerstar or kamek magic With Ridley and Samus, this doesn't work.

It also wouldn't be a minor change of height like with TP ganondorf~TP Link vs Brawl ganondorf~Brawl Link, but rather would mean scaling Ridley down to about half his size or smaller.   First of all, Bowser's size varies from game to game. As does Ridley's You've heard this plenty of times, but evidently it hasn't sunk in yet. So let me remind you. In Metroid 1, Ridley is practically the same height as Samus. In Super Metroid Ridley is quite a bit taller than Samus, but his wings are tiny for some reason (physically, he shouldn't be able to fly. But I digress). Now In the Metroid Prime series his size varies drastically. During the final battle at the impact crater, Ridley is Samus' height while standing on all fours. However his wingspan is much larger (physically correct). Oddly enough, he is much larger in Prime 3, as we can see Samus fit in his mouth during the freefall battle. Possibly due to Phazon's influence? All in all Ridley's size never stays the same. and him being larger than Samus is not always his defining characteristic.  But I like your idea of only Comparing character with their counterparts in their own videogame universes. So I'll do the same thing with a few other Smash bros characters. jigglypuff is officially one foot tall. Charizard is five foot seven. and if you want to see for yourself here's an accurate height chart You can see that Squirtle is also out of scale, but he's not in smash 4 yet so let's just leave him for now.  Also to pour extra salt, here's ROB in the pikmin universe. I'd say that's a pretty good in universe comparison.  Long story short, Ridley is completely plausible. If he were voted to the top, I don't see any reason why Sakurai couldn't put him in the game, short of bitterness towards fans. I had a field day with that new Ridley project m mod that came out a while ago and I think Ridley's size was portrayed just fine there. Honestly, the size jokes are getting old and immature by now, and they lack self awareness."
Metroid,318vx2,henryuuk,0,Sat Apr 4 08:22:24 2015 UTC,"First of all, Bowser's size varies from game to game.      Bowser has a single 'normal' size and lots of different boosted sizes depending on what is boosting him.     In Metroid 1, Ridley is practically the same height as Samus     Ow ok, i'm looking forward to playing as this    I hope you realize NES metroid is no longer canon and was retconned with Zero mission, where Ridley looks like this     All in all Ridley's size never stays the same. and him being larger than Samus is not always his defining characteristic.     His size varies in all games, very true, but he is never less than double samus her size except Metroid I (which, again, is no longer canon, and he was only that way because of limited hardware at the time) Even his medium stage during Other M is much bigger than samus if it would be standing on 2 feet.     Pokemon  sizes    Pokemon's have varying sizes, this is canon within the pokemon universe, both in the anime, manga and games. In fact there are entire 'mini-quests' based on this principle. They aren't 'characters', they  are species, and the pokedex sizes are an estimate (not to mention the pokedex is famous for not making sense, like Ponyta being able to jump over the eiffeltower)     Also to pour extra salt, here's ROB in the pikmin universe. I'd say that's a pretty good in universe comparison.   That's called a reference, congratulations. ROB doesn't exist as a character in the pikmin universe.    .  I must say, you being surprised by the existence of a reference to a real world object in a game filled with them and you remarking that fantasy animals are not all the same size across their entire species certainly have opened my eyes though /s    Tip : if you really want to fight the 'size comparison', then look at ganondorf and Link in Twilight Princess.  they are pretty much the only people from the same canon universe that aren't scaled right. TIPTIP : don't listen to the above tip, cause I already have some counters to that ready too. TIPtipTIP : Even if I didn't, scaling Ganondorf , or whoever back a little still doesn't change the fact that it isn't just size that Ridley has against him, but his own proportions too.     Project M     yeah I've seen lots of those. and they opened my eyes. Before I actually didn't fully believe Sakurai tried, now I see he did try, but merely came to the natural conclusion. Such a pity though, all my old movesets for Ridley seemingly not happening until he gets a redesign in a new metroid or something.    B-b-b-BONUS   You my friend are my favorite type of person. You are so convinced that your argument has no holes in it whatsoever.      Except I had already remarked on several of the holes in my own comments, and addressed them in the first comment. My 'argument' has holes in it, sure. but at least my argument isn't just : ""Nah it can work"" > 'people give counter argument' ? > ""Nah, these vague previous (often unrelated) things that have happened disproof it somehow""     You say the : ""Ridley is too big 'joke' "" is tired by now, I say people thinking scaling characters like kirby, dedede, olimar up, so they fit for the game is the same as scaling a character like Ridley down is just as, if not more so, tired by now, and merely shows a limited level of understanding towards characterization, design and so forth.    I liked the : 'friend' part though, and choose to not see it as a sarcastic remark."
Metroid,318vx2,twinfyre,1 point,Sat Apr 4 08:52:05 2015 UTC,"Dang. Did I make you mad? Sorry. Anyway...   Bowser has a single 'normal' size and lots of different boosted sizes depending on what is boosting him.   super mario sunshine. nothing boosts him. More than double mario's size  Super mario galaxy. Nothing boosts him. More than double mario's size  In Smash bros, bowser is double Mario's size. as he should be. which leads me to my next quote.   His size varies in all games, very true, but he is never less than double samus her size except Metroid I (which, again, is no longer canon, and he was only that way because of limited hardware at the time)   Need I remind you... Bowser is quite literally double Samus' size in smash bros. Put Ridley at slightly the same size as bowser, and you're done. Even so, I already made a rebuttal for this in my previous comment. So let me just plug that in for you, since you weren't listening.   During the final battle at the impact crater, Ridley is Samus' height while standing on all fours.   Of course I did also go on to mention wingspan, but I'm sure a Meta Ridley sized Ridley could work with slightly scaled down wings just a bit larger than super Metroid Ridley. Meh, you'll probably take this quote out of context for your next comment anyway.    Pokemon's have varying sizes, this is canon within the pokemon universe, both in the anime, manga and games.   Not too different from characters in the Metroid universe. Isn't it a bit odd how zero suit samus and suited samus can be the same height while Zero suit is wearing heels?  Or you know, that other Ridley crap?   That's called a reference, congratulations. ROB doesn't exist as a character in the pikmin universe.   Yeah he kind of does. Unless you want to sit here and argue semantics for another two hours, you can't deny that in Pikmin 2, you can pick up the disembodied head of ROB. Reference or not, his head is still there.

Such a pity though, all my old movesets for Ridley seemingly not happening until he gets a redesign in a new metroid or something.

More than double mario's size     Galaxy ending Bowser was being boosted by the Grand Shine. He shrinks back to normal size immediately afterwards. Even in the Galaxy mini-serie he was being boosted by the grand Powerstars (M&L:BiS even goes into detail to explain bowser has an area in his body that can allow him to grow when in danger, by overclocking his adrenaline to boost himself, however he can't really activate it himself, so Mario and Luigi have to do so when he is in mortal peril during the game)     Need I remind you... Bowser is quite literally double Samus' size in smash bros.      Sorry but ... what ?!?! Samus comes up to his eyes. She is at about 80% of his height    I didn't even begin about actual full body size, I had only remarked on his HEIGHT so far And Ridley on all fours might be the right height, but then he would be about as wide as an entire platform on stages like battlefield, and his hitbox would be humongous. Not to mention in almost all time we see him, he is sloughing over.    Power suit has a thickness to it itself too, it's logical that ZSS with her heels would be roughly the same size. and again, making minor adjustments to someone's size that are maybe a change of 5% is not even comparable to a minimum reduction and redesign worth over 50% of his body (and that is if we take one of the smaller Ridley designs)     Yeah he kind of does. Unless you want to sit here and argue semantics for another two hours, you can't deny that in Pikmin 2, you can pick up the disembodied head of ROB. Reference or not, his head is still there.

Also, Subspace emissary actually remarks on this itself it seems, cause it shows a real life rob size compared to Olimar in a cutscene, but the other robs are smaller than that one. Which is cause the Rob in smash is not an IRL R.O.B. but the CHARACTER R.O.B.     Because a fan recreation of Ridley made by an amatuer is somehow proof that a team of professionals can't do a good job? can you honestly tell me this looks terrible?     I think it looks awkward as fuck yes. And has removed a lot of me wanting him in smash. I sincerely hope that if they ever put him in they just go the Brawl-Pit route and make their own full redesign for him. however, since Sakurai already said he doesn't want to change the design of an 'active' character beyond minor details/touch ups I fear that won't happen."

Metroid,314jrc,calabhan,4,Fri Apr 3 16:39:57 2015 UTC,"Gender: Male  Character: Commander Adam Malkovich  Reasoning: Adam Malkovich is a pivotal character in the Metroid series. From his introduction in Metroid: Fusion to his appearance in the renowned Metroid: Other M, Adam Malkovich has proven that he can stand together with icons such as Mega Man, Sonic, Mario, and every Metroid fan's favorite lady, Samus Aran.  To further sell this idea, I've devised a move set for Adam.  Standard Moves: If Snake can't make the roster, Snake's moveset from Brawl could very easily be rolled into this character with very minor modifications.  Neutral, Forward, Down, and Up B: Unauthorized - Adam pulls out out his communicator and says ""You are not authorized to use that attack"". Since Malkovich could deliver authorization orders from anywhere to anywhere in the Bottle Ship, it effects the whole stage. Characters hit by this attack will not be able use the corresponding Smash Attack until the next match, or until Adam authorizes it using one of his Taunts.  Up Taunt: Adam speaks into his communicator and says: ""I'm authorizing the use of that attack."" Authorizes any and all previously unauthorized attacks.  Forward Taunt:: ""Any objections, Lady?"" (Heavy emphasis on the ""L"" in ""Lady"".)  Down Taunt: Adam does what he's best known for in Other M, and just sits down and plays a DS for 30 minutes.  Final Smash: Sector Zero - Adam jettisons the ice-resistant Metroid research facility with him in it into that stage. Character's hit by this attack are instantly KOed, including Adam. When Adam is KOed from his Final Smash, he loses all of his stock. In a timed match with infinite stock, he loses 10 points. Adam is the first to be KOed from this attack.  I think these moves will not only make Adam a fun character to play as and against, but also perfectly encapsulate the things that make Adam Malkovich such a great character and why he's so fondly remembered by fans of the Metroid series."

Metroid,314jrc,IceAnt573,5,Thu Apr 2 01:16:03 2015 UTC,It's easier to scale up than down. People seem to forget that Kirby's height is 8 inches.
Metroid,314jrc,ABCsofsucking,1 point,Thu Apr 2 07:56:14 2015 UTC,Exactly.   Olimar (along with others) was scaled up so that he would be visually formidable to the rest of the cast.  Part of the reason Ridley is intimidating is because he's a giant fucking space dragon.  Scaling Ridley down so that the rest of the roster would be formidable to him would be akin to neutering him.    I really don't know why people refuse to understand this.  Edit- I would also like to point out that the makers of Super Metroid poked fun at this concept when they made mini-NES Kraid precede giant -punch-through-the-floor Kraid.
Metroid,314jrc,calabhan,0,Sun Apr 5 00:37:07 2015 UTC,"It's also for balance purposes. If Olimar was his actual size and he retained the same range, he would be one of the most broken characters since a lot of characters' attacks wouldn't reach him."

Metroid,314jrc,nutella4eva,4,Wed Apr 1 23:46:44 2015 UTC,"I voted for a Metroid. The actual creature. I mean, it makes perfect sense in my head. Smash needs more recognizable metroid characters, so why no the creature the game is named after? Could be the size of the Last Metroid from SM (is already a trophy doesn't it?), but you could say ""how is gonna fight without arms or legs?"" Well, Bowser Jr. doesn's fight with his arms or legs either and is one the funniest character to play with. So I was thinking on something like a pro Luma without Rosalina, but Metroid attacks could use its full body. Think about it: neutral B= Charge then projectile, side B= electric projectile, up B= great floaty recovery, A and tilts = fangs attacks, smashes =electrified fangs, maybe no so great throws, but you take health from the opponents when throw and so on... The final smash would be a queen metroid/metroid prime transformation or eating enemies to win. They could make a completely original moveset for him. I dunno, maybe is just too bizarre. The main trouble I find with this idea is the lack of eyes on a metroid, so the expressions would be weird... I know, I know, let me dream!!

Metroid,314tpc,Nintendan95,1 point,Thu Apr 2 15:28:45 2015 UTC,Imagine a Metroid as a playable fighter....ok now I want
Metroid,314tpc,luemasify,13,Thu Apr 2 21:01:12 2015 UTC,Amen to that. I've wanted Dark Samus as a fighter for ages. People who say she would just be a clone of Samus don't seem to be paying much attention to how she fights in the games.  Here is what I posted in the ballot.
Metroid,314tpc,ZeroMachine,5,Thu Apr 2 16:01:53 2015 UTC,"This. Honestly people. It's not like Dark Samus is SA-X or Dark Link, whose movesets would be identical in every way. Dark Samus has her Phazon Pillars, Phazon Wall attack, Dark Echoes, etc, etc. She deserves so much better than clones like Dr. Mario, Lucina, etc. to be honest."
Metroid,314tpc,Colrex,2,Thu Apr 2 18:49:09 2015 UTC,And a final smash where she fuses herself to the Aurora Unit would make everyone piss their pants
Metroid,314tpc,katrinapestoso,5,Thu Apr 2 18:59:32 2015 UTC,"Or she could transform into Metroid Prime, her original form, and start wrecking everyone's shit with shockwaves and stuff."
Metroid,314tpc,SomeMetroid,3,Thu Apr 2 20:12:47 2015 UTC,Exactly! They could   Use the Aurora Unit to blast the enemies with its laser and summon Dark Echoes to help out. Use the Aurora Unit to send Leviathans crashing against the screen Merge with the Aurora Unit and control it for a set period of time Summon Dark Echoes and fire a laser (basically Samus' Final Smash but that would be a little boring)
Metroid,314tpc,Colrex,2,Thu Apr 2 19:12:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I think the dynamic between Samus and Dark Samus would be similar to the dynamic between Ness and Lucas. Yes, they share some moves, but the shared moves are not identical and most of their moves are different (e.g. Ness doesn't have that awesome Up-Smash that Lucas does)."
Metroid,314tpc,ZeroMachine,7,Thu Apr 2 19:24:42 2015 UTC,I think the chance of Dark Samus making it on the roster is almost zero mainly because she's already in the game. The same goes for Ridley.
Metroid,314tpc,The_Lama,2,Thu Apr 2 03:18:26 2015 UTC,"This ballot will carry over to the next game, it isn't just for Sm4sh DLC.  EDIT: Apparently some here disagree, this has been officially stated on both the Japanese version of the site and during the Direct."
Metroid,314tpc,TheNerdyOne_,0,Thu Apr 2 20:27:19 2015 UTC,Crazier things have happened.
Metroid,314tpc,ONI_Agent_Locke,-1,Thu Apr 2 17:12:17 2015 UTC,"I think she should be in the roster. Like you said, she's already in the game. The resources are there. Why not turn her into a playable character? They don't really need to create a character from scratch."
Metroid,314tpc,Colrex,10,Thu Apr 2 18:58:15 2015 UTC,Sylux  is better since he's not a clone character like Dr Mario lucina  dark pit ganandorf lucas.
Metroid,314tpc,wreckingcanon,-16,Thu Apr 2 01:38:01 2015 UTC,"we all know how lazy sakurai is, i'm sure he'd jump at the chance to reskin samus and call it a day. if garbage like dark pit got in, dark samus would definitely make it in."
Metroid,314tpc,srslybr0,10,Thu Apr 2 02:11:55 2015 UTC,"Dark Pit and Lucina were originally going to be alternate skins. They decided at the last minute of development to give them a few unique moves and make them separate characters. No characters got cut to make room for those two. Sakurai dedicated a huge amount of his life to Smash Bros, calling him lazy isn't too cool."
Metroid,314tpc,Oduya,9,Thu Apr 2 02:43:40 2015 UTC,"It's not only not cool, its incorrect."
Metroid,314tpc,zephyrdragoon,2,Thu Apr 2 06:53:28 2015 UTC,I'd actually say he's one of the most hard-working developers out there. He literally almost worked himself to death making Melee!
Metroid,314tpc,SALMONerd117,3,Sat Apr 4 19:14:14 2015 UTC,"I would like a space pirate, but not sure if they would choose a character that is not really a single character. So Sylux would probably work well."
Metroid,314tpc,ChozoVisionary,2,Thu Apr 2 11:37:23 2015 UTC,"Allow me to throw my OPINION in as well  Dark samus isn't a clone. The way she fights is only similar to samus in that they both exist using the same technology, however samus is human and uses it like its meant to. Dark samus on the other hand has corrupted all of the equipment to serve her as she (she?) sees fit, ex. Phazon arm cannon (shoots phazon short distance but powerful) her phazon barrier (reflects missiles and causes small amounts of nearby aoe damage (not spammable/hold-down effect)). So she very well could be VERY different from samus if they wanted her to.  So now would they put the time into making her good?  Probably, Nintendo despite not releasing new metroid games really likes the franchise, plus they put effort into metroid in smash before (they remade zero suit samus TWICE to make sure she was unique).  She would be a great character and would get more hype for the metroid franchise. Am I worried they would mess her up? No. They have plenty of reason not to make dark samus as dull as the rest of clones (which isn't that dull anyway).  Plus this might get some extra attention to the game retro studios (the creators of metroid who have been working on SOME game for 2 1/2 years (metroid hasn't had a new game for 5 years (excluding other M))) may release sometime next year.  Sorry for being so long winded, but thanks for reading this far."
Metroid,314tpc,KolbyKolbyKolby,2,Tue Apr 21 05:30:05 2015 UTC,"I voted for Dark Samus. I feel she could be like Samus, but faster, with much harder phazon based hits. but very light and gets knocked off easier."
Metroid,314tpc,that_dude_you_know,2,Thu Apr 2 03:18:43 2015 UTC,I voted for Gandrayda from Metroid Prime 3.
Metroid,314tpc,minicyberking,1 point,Thu Apr 2 15:01:01 2015 UTC,"Edit: Posted comment on wrong thread. But I may say, Dark Samus seem like an easy option. Heavier clone."
Metroid,314tpc,Colrex,1 point,Thu Apr 2 02:09:36 2015 UTC,Dark Samus is actually faster than regular Samus.
Metroid,314tpc,Colrex,1 point,Thu Apr 2 19:30:36 2015 UTC,"Dark Samus is the Metroid character that deserves to join the roster the most. Maybe somewhere down the line the other hunters could join but Dark Samus needs to be at the top of the list. She is a main character in a trilogy, and she has Phazon moves that don't limit her to a potential clone, etc. The resources are there thanks to the assist trophy, so there's no need to spend that much time and money creating the model in comparison to completely new characters that are not in game."
Metroid,314tpc,KarjarA,1 point,Thu Apr 2 19:32:01 2015 UTC,"Now i regret choosing Ridley, but seriously though, the 2 best choices cant be in the game for some stupid reason, Sakurai just doesnt want Ridley even though its clearly possible (Project M Ridley mod, which looks great), and Dark Samus is an assist trophy."
Metroid,314tpc,Obsidias,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:55:57 2015 UTC,"Along with the other hunters I think that a Federation Trooper, Luminoth, and Chozo would be great options!"
Metroid,314tpc,sniktawekim,1 point,Thu Apr 2 22:04:14 2015 UTC,"I feel like samus is the single strongest character in the metroid universe, so stage bosses should be able to be viable."
Metroid,314tpc,TheDunsparceKid,1 point,Thu Apr 2 22:20:01 2015 UTC,"As for Ridley, i was a supporter myself, but we know what Sakurai said about him was in a way of conclusion on why isn't he playable, and i doubt he would change his mind about it.   I wouldn't put it past him. He's changed his mind plenty of times. In Brawl days he said that an Animal Crossing character would never be playable. For this Smash, he also said there'd be no DLC characters."
Metroid,314tpc,beywiz,1 point,Fri Apr 3 18:46:24 2015 UTC,Maybe dark samus could have a very projectile centered playstyle like megaman/samus in METROID.
Metroid,314tpc,zephyrdragoon,-1,Thu Apr 2 00:50:50 2015 UTC,"She won't get in. She's literally a clone of Samus. It's more likely than another hunter or Rhundas/Ghor get in, or a Luminoth."
Metroid,314tpc,Mr_Pennybags,1 point,Thu Apr 2 06:56:17 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say she has to be a clone, she can have a phazon attack based moveset, heavy spread attacks, she doesn't have to be anything like Samus who is melee/projectile based."
Metroid,314tpc,Colrex,1 point,Thu Apr 2 12:43:39 2015 UTC,"She's not a clone though. It's not like Dark Samus is SA-X. Dark Samus is not a Dark Link for example, whose moves are the same as regular Link's. The ""clones"" are identical and their series already have a crapton of characters. Metroid only has Samus. Ridley won't be added. The other hunters could be added eventually. But the one character who deserves it the most is Dark Samus. She's not a secondary character. She's the antagonist in a trilogy. She's freaking Metroid Prime for crying out loud.  Dark Samus obviously should have an arm cannon attack, but there's no need to make it a copy of Samus' charge beam. Aside from obvious beam she could split up like in Metroid Prime 3. She could also have a corruption attack that does damage over time.  attack. Don't forget her close range Phazon Wall. Phazon Pillars. Obvious Morph Ball but perhaps using Ball Boost as her Dash Attack.   As you can see, there's no need for Nintendo to restrict her to a mere Samus clone."
Metroid,314tpc,zephyrdragoon,0,Thu Apr 2 18:43:57 2015 UTC,"She's close enough that she'd be a clone character. Faster and weaker or slower and stronger than samus, with minor changes to some moves. She wears a suit samus wore, she's got an armor cannon, she turns into a ball. These are all things samus does, that samus does in smash already.   If DS gets in she'll have changes like, screw attack has more horizontal but less vertical movement, missiles travel faster but home less, super missiles have a constant speed instead of accelerating, charge shot is similar to mii gunners side smash, and she lays more powerful bombs slower.   She'll have the same relation to samus that ganondorf has to captain falcon, IF she gets in."
Metroid,314tpc,metroidmariomega,2,Thu Apr 2 19:07:35 2015 UTC,"not necessarily, her up+B could be a short term flight like lucario, its how she gets around in prime. her forward+B could be the scattershot  beam or the constant boost ball moves she uses in echoes. Down+B could be something similar to greninja or lucario's subtitute except with a dark samus echo instead of the substitute doll. Those are just her specials there are still a ton of her original attacks from Echoes and Corruption that could be used for smashes, tilts, and aerial moves"
Metroid,314tpc,zephyrdragoon,0,Fri Apr 3 01:42:38 2015 UTC,"Then there's nothing to identify her as a Metroid character besides her appearance. She'll just be an amalgamation of a bunch of other characters with no style. Sure she could have Lucario's B Up, Yoshi's B Side, and another counter move (sakurai pls no) but then she becomes a pseudo mii fighter, with a bunch of random moves she's not known for."
Metroid,314tpc,Colrex,2,Fri Apr 3 01:55:50 2015 UTC,"Have you even played Metroid Prime Echoes and Corruption? Be honest. Either you don't know what you're talking about or you just hate the idea of Dark Samus being in the roster. First, according to you she's too similar to Dark Samus. And then when people give perfect options for moves from the games she appears in you say she has no style? Another Mii Fighter? Even though the moves would actually be from her boss fights in the Metroid Prime Trilogy? Ganondorf's moveset is nothing like any of his attacks in the Zelda games. Dr. Mario has pills. Wow. Wolf has a slightly modified moveset but that's it. He doesn't have a boss fight with those moves though, does he? Do characters like Fox and Falco have those moves in their games? Oh... Yeah. No. Dark Samus does though."
Metroid,314tpc,zephyrdragoon,0,Fri Apr 3 02:32:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I do hate the idea of her being added. She'll be a boring clone, a novel character at best and a palette swap at worst. I'd much rather we get a new character from a different series. All of the moves you've listed are moves that yoshi, sonic, robin, or the mii-gunner can do.   Dr. Mario has pills by the way, but its rather irrelevant, we're not talking about any of those characters, they just happen to be clones of each other. It doesn't matter where her moves come from, you can list every single aspect of her, it doesn't change the fact that as a fighter she will be very similar to samus."
Metroid,314tpc,Colrex,1 point,Fri Apr 3 02:56:40 2015 UTC,"Luigi shouldn't be a character because he's just Mario's brother so their movesets could've been the same. Oh wait. They are different. Dark Samus can be different too. Dr. Mario. A stronger, pill hurling Mario. Still exists. Falco and Wolf shouldn't exist. Moves similar to Fox's. Oh wait. Slight variations. Even if Dark Samus was similar which she isn't, she could exist as a playable character. Roy and Lucina should never have existed, they are similar to Marth. Oh. Fire and different sword mechanics but essentially the same movesets. Even a those small differences allowed them to exist. Lucas should never have existed, similar to Ness right? Pichu shouldn't have existed.  Ganondorf's moveset is basically the same as Captain Falcon's. Their weight and power are different. Ganondorf still exists. He should have an original moveset. Yet they relegated him to a clone. Lucario pretty much replaced Mewtwo. Floaty, long distance rolls. B. Yet you don't consider him a clone or similar to Mewtwo. Dark Samus is faster, stronger, and has different attacks than Samus does. (Pillars, Shockwave, Turbo boost ball, Dark Echoes, Scattershot Beam, Phazon shield) Dark Pit. 1 ""original"" move, differences in power. Still exists.   Dark Samus needs to be playable."
Metroid,314tpc,zephyrdragoon,0,Fri Apr 3 02:46:56 2015 UTC,"They're are so many incorrect things in that post.    Luigi and Mario have different move sets.  Dr. Mario is a model swap of Mario, he took insignificant amounts of time to include, and he is not any stronger. Fox and Falco were different enough in melee that people chose to play one over the other in competitive settings. Wolf is more different compared to Fox than Falco is. Roy is gone, and when he was present he was different enough from Marth that no one played him competitively. Lucina took an insignificant amount of time to include.  Lucas and Ness are surprisingly different compared to eachother. You've clearly never played both.  Pichu had a unique mechanic, it damaged itself.  Ganondorf isn't much of a clone anymore, in melee you could have made that arguement, not anymore. Even then people still chose to play one or the other in competitive settings.  Lucario is not a clone, how many times am I going to have to say this. You're grasping at straws here. His only similar move compared to Mewtwo is his neutral B, a charged projectile that grows in power as you charge it. How many other characters share that same move? Wii fit trainer, Samus, Greninja, Robin, Rosalina, Shiek and arguably both Links.  Dark pit is in the same situation that Dr. Mario and Lucina are in.    Putting in dark samus is a waste of a good opportunity, a slot that could be taken by a unique character. Honestly, there are no good metroid characters to add."
Metroid,314tpc,Colrex,1 point,Fri Apr 3 04:06:47 2015 UTC,"Dr. Mario, Lucina, Pichu, Lucario, Ganondorf, Lucas, Roy, Falco and Dark Pit are clones. They're as close as you can get. If Dark Samus was to be added they should not restrict her to clone status. That'd be insanely disappointing. Wolf was a clone with variations in his moveset but they weren't enough to make him an entirely different character. Dark Samus' moveset options are a lot better than Wolf's slight variations and every other clone's identical moves with simple number differences.   She has Dark Echoes, Phazite Pillars, Scattershot Beam, Phazon shockwave, Phazon shield, Pulse Beam, Turbo Boost Ball, Aurora Unit/Leviathan Collision for her Final Smash.  Besides, seeing how the resources for her are already there thanks to the assist trophy, they don't need to start from scratch. They can just modify a few things and continue until they turn her into the playable character she deserves to become."
Metroid,314tpc,zephyrdragoon,1 point,Thu Apr 2 19:27:32 2015 UTC,"Lucario is not a clone, what are you talking about?  Dr. Mario is a model swap of original Mario, Lucina is Marth without his one mechanic, Dark Pit is a palette swap of Pit, none of these characters took a significant amount of time to put into the game. Ganondorf and Falco have come into their own as different characters. Wolf had more drastic variations to his moveset than any clone before him.   Dark Samus doesn't have a wider variety of options than other clones, she still shoots things and turns into a ball, her most obvious difference compared to normal samus is her blue/black color scheme, and that's intentional. She's a foil to samus, equal in every way save her goals. Her main, and likely only meaningful, change would be her charge shot.   Take a good look at her assist trophy, a really good look, and compare it to samus's model. It's poor in comparison, assist trophys have a paltry number of polygons compared to actual characters. Dark Samus's assist trophy looks like Chrom, from Robin's final smash. They'd have to completely remake her model if they added her, from scratch.   And whoever is downvoting me, what am I being downvoted for? It's not a disagree button, I'm literally half of this conversation."

Metroid,315cbx,tfwnomatlab,3,Thu Apr 2 02:50:20 2015 UTC,"Yes! Of course I had other ideas too! Why not include goomba from Mario? Or no better, that cute flying cat head that turns into a one eyed monster in Kirby? Oh oh oh I got it! Since we are talking Metroid: a Ripper! Yes! That useless flying creature that does nothing but fly! B+up tp fly! B+down to fly and B+sides to fly! So much moves. But seriously, Space Pirates are basic ennemies from the franchise, not important characters. And technically, Space Pirates are already in the 3DS version: The Ki Hunters are space pirates. Though I recognize the number of moves a space pirate could have I don't know if we could say that they represent the franchise that much. I'd go more for a hunter, like Weavel that I'd see being able to separate is body in half, use it's blade for CQC and it's main gun being more of a grenade luncher than a beam weapon it would make it different than Samus. But hey that's just my opinion! You're beautiful!"
Metroid,315cbx,wolfen24,2,Thu Apr 2 15:01:28 2015 UTC,It could always be Ridley's bodyguard. That way it's a specific non-generic enemy
Metroid,315cbx,txcrnr,2,Thu Apr 2 18:01:18 2015 UTC,"They are too generic, like... putting a shy guy or a koopa troopa as a playable fighter.  Honestly, the only characters that ""could"" fit on smash and are somewhat reconizable besides Dark Samus are Sylux, Rundas and Gandradia."
Metroid,315cbx,citizenofgaia,3,Thu Apr 2 20:24:11 2015 UTC,Sa-x?
Metroid,315cbx,KarjarA,2,Thu Apr 2 21:02:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe. I think SA-X shoulnt be really considered, is just a Samus clone."

Metroid,315cbx,KarjarA,2,Thu Apr 2 21:01:40 2015 UTC,"I think any of these characters would be a good fit: Space Pirate, Rundas, Ghor, Gandrayda, Weavel, Noxus, Sylux, Trace, Spire, Kanden, Federation Trooper, Luminoth, Chozo."

Metroid,311jej,Russano_Greenstripe,10,Wed Apr 1 11:32:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with Fission Metroids.  They'd change color and split so you had to keep switching beam types. And if you're surrounded by a bunch of them, you would have to switch after each kill.  The only relief was to just morph and power bomb."

Metroid,311jej,FreemanC17,3,Wed Apr 1 13:25:17 2015 UTC,I always thought fission metroids because being colorblind I never had any idea what I was supposed to be using to kill them except for power bombs.
Metroid,311jej,turumbarr,3,Wed Apr 1 16:22:09 2015 UTC,"I've never found Hunters to be much of a challenge at all. Fission metroids are horrible. And putting them in that platforming sequence? UGH.

Metroid,311jej,joecb91,2,Wed Apr 1 17:29:31 2015 UTC,None. There's a quick and careful way to kill everything once you figure it out. The worst I can imagine is getting ganked by 4-5 fission metroids. Then you can just panic power bomb.

Metroid,31061s,Hellspark08,4,Wed Apr 1 02:17:40 2015 UTC,"For me depression and a lot of changes in my life sort of jostled my motivation and creative drive. Treatment and therapy have helped me a lot and I am getting back into the craft. Not sure if this relates to you or not. But it is understandable how life can move on and shifts of interest or responsibilities can take away from things such as doing art work.   I fell out of art for a while and am starting again. It took a lot and I feel like I was behind while my fellow artists were creating amazing things and I was being left in the dust.  I look at a lot of peoples works online and am amazed and intimidated by the talent and creativity, but in a way it motivates me to try even harder and to get better. Everyone was once a beginner and working your way up takes time and work but it is possible.  If you wish you never stopped drawing, it's not to late to start again."
Metroid,31061s,OranJ1zz,3,Wed Apr 1 06:06:16 2015 UTC,"I think it mostly has to do with my current setting in life. I doodled and sketched constantly when I was in school. Every notebook had pages of tanks, mechs, planes, guitars, and video game stuff. Maybe I just didn't want to be in class, but I loved drawing. I fell out of that habit when I graduated 8 years ago. Suddenly I had tons of other things to fill my time, mostly working. I just don't ever find myself sitting at a desk with nothing but a pencil and paper. There's always a computer or smartphone within reach, and I typically don't sit still for very long.  My life is going through a lot of rapid changes lately, and it's hard to be inspired by anything. Who has the time? All I do is work and sleep, and the days just evaporate. I don't really feel depressed, but I am way more apathetic than I ever was, especially when it comes to being creative. Guitar was a huge part of my life too, but I don't really feel like playing anymore. I was actually playing concerts and jamming with people all the time, with thousands invested in amps and equipment. Now it all collects dust.  Going through all this old stuff has been a wake up call, that's for sure."
Metroid,31061s,OranJ1zz,3,Wed Apr 1 06:34:14 2015 UTC,"It's totally understandable what you are saying. A lot of people feel the same way about these things including myself. Work, responsibilities, and even school can get in the way of a lot of things and make each day feel like a monotonous grind. And when growing comfortable (or rather accustomed) to monotony, inspiration and hobbies can often fade into obscurity.   As for time, its hard to say it but sometimes you gotta make time to do these things. Whether is is drawing, playing guitar or whatever. Really shitty assumptuion but lets say you work 8 hours a day, sleep 8 hours a day. That still leaves you with 8 hours a day to do stuff. Ok, I guess I did not take into account commuting, eating, and whatever else. Not saying you gotta spend every hour of your day constantly doing something ""productive"" (it is important to take breaks), but the point is there is usually a tiny bit of free time in the day that you could do something in.   Lastly, depression can manifest in many ways. Things like losing motivation and enjoyment in previously enjoyed activities, apathy, and oversleeping are not uncommon in depressed people. I'm no psychologist, but if you feel like you need to, it's not a bad idea to see a professional about these kinds of things if you really feel like they are impacting your life.   It is important to take into account interests and things can change with time. You eight years ago may not be the same person as you today."

Metroid,310ipq,FlyingRep,3,Wed Apr 1 04:00:49 2015 UTC,2) That game is non-canon. Sakamoto says it is but fuck Sakamoto.
Metroid,310ipq,AuraRyu,2,Wed Apr 1 08:16:32 2015 UTC,"1) Unknown. It was never said.  2) Because that is how Sakamoto always pictured Samus. The games that Sakamoto believes to be canon don't have much in the way of cut-scenes or character development, so fans came up with their own view of the character, gaining more ground with the Prime series which had more development than any games before it.  3) Hopefully Nintendo will have nothing to do with the fan-made AM2R. Anything they would do with it would be to stop it being made (as it makes them no money). It will come out when the sole developer (who also has a life outside of making AM2R) is done, but no scheduled date yet.  4) I'm not sure I understand the question. The only difference between the two suits seems to be that the one she got in the Chozo ruins on Zebes is able to access certain features her previous one was unable to.  5) I mostly answered this in 2, but his view of Samus is very different from what Retro did with the character and so to jive with his interpretation, he needs the Prime series to be non-canon."
Metroid,310ipq,PiLovesDeadpool,1 point,Wed Apr 1 10:54:17 2015 UTC,"So in order to fulfil his personal interpretation of Samus' character, he makes 3 of the best games in the series noncannon? And then makes Other M? Screw(attack) that guy! Fire his butt!"

Metroid,310d6f,Hellspark08,7,Wed Apr 1 03:23:51 2015 UTC,"But WAIT until you are hopelessly lost.  Not just a few minutes, or backtracking and confused.  Even if you run through an area three times, keep at it. You'll start picking up clues and blow your way out of the area.  That aspect of...""where the...what was that...wait a minute this is new.

Metroid,310d6f,boneidol,3,Wed Apr 1 15:29:57 2015 UTC,"Metroid Prime actually got me into the series, so I believe you picked a good start!  In my opinion, the Prime games exceed more in the immersion department. Get lost in the world. If you're curious about something, scan it. Just find out little tidbits as you can and learn about the world. I spend a lot of time with my scan visor up when I'm sure the area is clear of enemies. That's what I found fun."
Metroid,310d6f,MastuDenton,2,Wed Apr 1 03:28:19 2015 UTC,The prime games literally give you vague directions to the next powerup every so often unless you turned this feature off (its on by default)  If you were playing super met or something i could understand but the prime games do give you a suggested direction to look.
Metroid,310d6f,FlyingRep,1 point,Wed Apr 1 08:03:05 2015 UTC,"My favorite metroids were the 2D platforming ones, and that's where it started for me.  Trying downloading/buying/emulating Super Metroid, Metroid Zero Mission, and Metroid Fusion. I embraced that as the true metroid type, and the prime series were good because you felt like you WERE samus as she was telling the story rather than just playing as her.  Also, in the prime series, you gotta read the logbook, A LOT. And the will give REALLY subtle hints to where you gotta go besides the obvious."
Metroid,310d6f,dickholedoug,-4,Wed Apr 1 04:04:38 2015 UTC,"If you're having that much trouble with prime metroid might not be for you.

Metroid,310d6f,txcrnr,3,Wed Apr 1 15:56:37 2015 UTC,I don't really think there is a non-dickish way to say that the part that he is bad at is the main part of the game.

Metroid,310d6f,dickholedoug,1 point,Wed Apr 1 16:38:05 2015 UTC,Because what I said could sound like someone being a dick. Not that my intention was to be one.

Metroid Prime guides you through the entire game by telling you where to go on the map for each item in the order they should be collected. Just make your way to the room on the map that has the question mark over it, get the item, then wait for the next hint.

Metroid,30wcui,Mortimer42,3,Tue Mar 31 07:20:02 2015 UTC,Samus is stronger because she was designed that way; people often try to feel proud that their favorite is stronger while it really doesn't mean anything.

Metroid,30uj4e,jonnyvice,2,Mon Mar 30 21:50:41 2015 UTC,I like zero mission but I have to ask- what makes it better? To me it's just a smaller amount of what makes Super Metroid so good.
Metroid,30uj4e,Afro-Ninja,3,Mon Mar 30 23:15:05 2015 UTC,"The controls are better, the movements feel more realistic or less ""floaty"" than SM, and it revitalized all the great aspects of the original while adding a few key upgrades to the core. I also think ZM was more challenging than SM was.  Then the extra content after the original end-game was really awesome.   I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I recently did a run-through of all the 2d Metroid games, and played SM, ZM, and Fusion all pretty much back to back, and ZM stuck with me as being more fun, more challenging, and more memorable."
Metroid,30uj4e,StormyWaters2021,3,Mon Mar 30 23:32:15 2015 UTC,"I dunno  I like the floaty controls honestly,   it feels like I have much better total control of Samus overall  Also not to mention , those cool ass power bomb beam particle attacks and crystal flash and a bunch of other cool moves that we never saw again."
Metroid,30uj4e,Gyper,2,Tue Mar 31 00:35:24 2015 UTC,"Oh don't get me wrong, SM is an amazing game. I won't knock it for a second. I just think ZM is better, from my perspective at least."
Metroid,30uj4e,StormyWaters2021,2,Tue Mar 31 00:38:21 2015 UTC,"It's a different planet than earth. It would make sense that there could be less gravity, especially after seeing how floaty the first Metroid game was and the fact that it's the same planet."

Metroid,30uj4e,V0ID115,1 point,Mon Mar 30 23:39:49 2015 UTC,One thing people are forgetting is that playing Super Metroid after Metroid or Zero Mission they will have better atmosphere because at the beginning of Super you see stuff that looks like where you were in the original.

Metroid,30quie,BoogKnight,2,Mon Mar 30 02:34:30 2015 UTC,Is it just me or does the 3ds VC port of Fusion not have this lag? I just got to the final bit of the game and I realized that it wasn't chugging every time I used the diffusion missile.

Metroid,30ma1m,crayolaclock,5,Sat Mar 28 23:48:47 2015 UTC,They've outright said they aren't making a new f zero though. No solid news on Metroid
Metroid,30ma1m,Bob-Kyle,3,Sun Mar 29 00:18:29 2015 UTC,"Plus, Samus is still a regular feature in Nintendo fluff pieces, while our arrogant friend Captain Falcon doesn't get much attention from top brass. They will give us something for Metroid, but F-Zero is probably dead."
Metroid,30ma1m,MisterWoodhouse,3,Sun Mar 29 02:20:46 2015 UTC,I don't believe for one second that the company which has been like Oprah with tossing gimmicks everywhere for two straight console generations can't think of a single gimmick to shoehorn into a particular game...
Metroid,30ma1m,MisterWoodhouse,2,Sun Mar 29 16:25:43 2015 UTC,only racing franchise thats fun :(
Metroid,30ma1m,Chip--Chipperson,0,Sun Mar 29 16:59:22 2015 UTC,"I will never understand why ""racing games are so boring"" is such a common sentiment. The act of driving in and of itself is so inherently visceral and fun that I really don't understand why so many people find racing games unfun.  F-Zero ain't even the best future racer anyway, not while there's Wipeout and Nitronic Rush/Distance."
Metroid,30ma1m,TheStills,2,Sun Mar 29 03:13:42 2015 UTC,"I mean thats fine. I dont define myself as the conventional gamer so I wouldn't assume that someone would understand my madness. Why F-Zero is fun to me is because i love murdering the racers that are close to me in the standings, I also love learning where to boost on the maps and hoping i dont hit a damn barrierr  with zero health.   I havn't played Wipeout but I have played Nitronic Rush, but I didnt find anything about it that I found fun.  Theres 7 billion people on this planet and you found the one guy that makes his own rules in a game."

Too bad Nintendo literally completely abandoned 2D because 3D polygonal gaming was the new benchmark every game had to use for the time. I bet Metroid was going some bullshit in the same vein of Castlevania 64 and Nintendo just realized how shit it was going to be and cancelled it. We could have had Metroid's answer to SotN, but nobody was making games like that for N64."

Metroid,30nhn0,TheFlyingBogey,5,Sun Mar 29 20:51:21 2015 UTC,"Locked on free aim means your screen is locked in position at whatever you target, but you can still move the cursor. It actually makes certain things difficult in MP1, primarily the Incinerator drone and the stalactites in Phendrana and Magmoor."
Metroid,30nhn0,JakMon777,1 point,Sun Mar 29 21:56:00 2015 UTC,Oh god that's what it is?! This changes everything!!! Thank you I am so tuning this off
Metroid,30nhn0,TheFlyingBogey,3,Sun Mar 29 23:35:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's a little annoying, I think because the games weren't designed for you to free aim all the time. I think MP3 makes you free aim all the time (not sure, haven't played it enough) but it works because it was designed from the ground up with motion aiming in mind."
Metroid,30nhn0,JakMon777,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:47:15 2015 UTC,"It would make sense, I mean I'd keep it on to take advantage of areas where free aim is better, but the trade off just isn't enough to warrant having it like that all the time. I'd keep it on for MP3 though since that really does benefit from it!"
Metroid,30nhn0,TheFlyingBogey,1 point,Wed Apr 1 10:53:25 2015 UTC,"your reticle will lock to the middle of the screen when you press the z-button. so, it becomes very similar to how metroid prime on the gamecube functioned.  by default, the wii version of the game still ""allows"" you to miss even though you're locked on. the screen will follow your target, but you can shoot wherever you want."

Metroid,30oh5v,Afro-Ninja,2,Sun Mar 29 06:42:42 2015 UTC,The only solution I found needed the eShop version and you had to move the blank save onto your console using the vWii mode and for some reason the game then reads the tokens from the vWii.  Haven't tried it out though so I can't even confirm that works for sure.
Metroid,30oh5v,AuraRyu,1 point,Sun Mar 29 06:48:44 2015 UTC,"From what I've gathered I think I can copy my save file to SD, load into dolphin, activate a cheat code, save, and move the file back to my wii.  BUT, in order to do that I need both the MPT rom/iso and the actual code to enable this :/"

Not only has she explored the locations physically, she's explored their history, the cultures that have lived in them, and the events that led to their current state.

The two doors here lead to the Speed Booster and Wave Beam, but you need the Grapple to get the wave beam (unless you can reliably wall jump).  From the bubble room, if you head down and left you should fight a sub-boss.  Keep going down and left and you should find the Grapple beam.  Go back and get the wave beam.

Metroid,30gbzw,twinfyre,2,Fri Mar 27 22:02:43 2015 UTC,"It's because the traditional Power Suit design, as good-looking as it is, isn't anywhere close to being anatomically accurate. If the suit's breast plate had its width reduced, it would let her shoulders rest in a less impossibly broad stature and give her a much better range of arm movement without suspension of disbelief.  I believe /u/PhazonZim took this approach to her model of Samus, and the design retains its iconic shape while still looking like something a human could reasonably fit into."

You kind of have to suspend disbelief to accept that Samus in her power suit can turn into a sphere. This is an alternative design. Who cares if it fits under a power suit in your opinion? It's inspired by Soviet/Roscosmos design - so it's already inherently ripping Samus out of her Nintendo built universe and putting her in some alternative place.

And phazon had a very useful : ""when original source is removed, all is removed with almost no negative effects for anyone involved"" thing going on.    However, seeing as the Chozo DNA didn't gave her any ""strange"" external features, there is no reason why metroid DNA would have to do so, and it seems that the only thing metroid DNA gave her in the long run was being able to absorb X parasites, and maybe absorb life energy from other beings through contact too."

As for the Metroid DNA, I was under the impression that when she absorbs the SA-X at the end of Fusion, it restores her DNA to pre-X infection. Alongside that, even the post-game reward art shows her looking normal."
Metroid,30cran,MonochromeTyrant,2,Thu Mar 26 15:28:23 2015 UTC,"The post game art is not really known whether it is after fusion though, or if it is even 'stuff' that happens.

Metroid,309dmp,mecha_flake,6,Wed Mar 25 16:06:03 2015 UTC,"I really like the idea of continuing the storyline of Metroid. Maybe the galactic federation tries to kill her, and hires everyone to kill her, so she basically has no partners anymore. And then they could expand on the chozo thing, and expand the relationship, after she finds some kind of chozo temple, and she understand now how much the chozo`s have done for her, and that they were the only true ""good guys"". I know this isnt told very well, but I hope you get the idea"
Metroid,309dmp,KarjarA,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:02:02 2015 UTC,It is where I used to think the storyline was going until Metroid Other M failed to be the heavy hitter that Nintendo was expecting it to be. Even Metroid Other M seemed to hint strongly that Samus' relationship with the GF was changing - that aspect of the story did a great job of setting up Fusion.
Metroid,309dmp,mecha_flake,3,Thu Mar 26 14:18:55 2015 UTC,What do you mean about her being changed? It's been a while since I played the game.

So at this point, she is on the run from the Galactic Federation(If she chooses not to face them for what she has done)."

Metroid,309dmp,mecha_flake,9,Thu Mar 26 13:52:37 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, her suit is now fused to her because of the x-parasite attack. I believe she also changes her opinion of the galactic federation."
Metroid,309dmp,Auxe,13,Wed Mar 25 18:20:26 2015 UTC,"I'm going against the grain here, so please keep an open mind. I really enjoyed Metroid Fusion, but I feel it's way over-praised.   The story of Fusion was really good. It added a lot to the game play and helped it to stand out from the story-sparse rest of the series. That being said, I feel like the points the author brings up as benefits are actually problems, at least for me.   First and foremost, having a central hub. I've railed against this before, so I won't delve too deeply. Suffice it to say, I felt disengaged every time I was instructed to go back to the main hallway and take another elevator. It ruined the feel of a Metroid game to me.   Second, the idea that you were assigned missions to carry out. I love the classic games where you have nothing and know nothing. You're here to track down and destroy, and you've got a gun and armor. You have to find your way through the maze, picking up items and tracking back to see what you can access with the new equipment. Fusion was mostly a glorified Mario game. ""Go to Point A. Then go to Point B. Now go to Point C.""  The game is fun to play, but every time I play it I wish they had done it differently. I love the contrast of the steel-walled rooms and corridors with the standard model of rocky tunnels and caverns. I just wish they'd made the spaceship less centrally-focused and avoided the main hub aspect that I find so abhorrent. A spaceship can easily be constructed as a web of interconnected hallways and rooms, rather than a grid with a hallway running down the center.   I also wish they'd not have forced your hand in what to do and where to go. The story can unfold without being herded like cattle down a chute."
Metroid,309dmp,StormyWaters2021,7,Wed Mar 25 19:02:19 2015 UTC,"I also wish they'd not have forced your hand in what to do and where to go. The story can unfold without being herded like cattle down a chute.   This is probably my biggest gripe about Fusion as well, and why I think Zero Mission is superior over it (at least until it too suffers the trappings of linear Metroid in the post MB portion).   Thanks for the well written opinion piece"
Metroid,309dmp,zeress1,4,Wed Mar 25 19:36:32 2015 UTC,"I played these two back-to-back, and with the immediate comparison I felt like Zero Mission was absolutely better."
Metroid,309dmp,StormyWaters2021,3,Wed Mar 25 19:51:00 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I think a change in layout was necessary for a new (sidescrolling) metroid game to succeed.  If fusion had a similar grid layout to previous games and was less linear then it wouldn't have felt different enough from the original, super, or zero mission, and as much as I loved those games I really hate when a developer just remakes the game over and over (the only recent Mario game I've enjoyed was Galaxy).  Second both the linearity and the hub make sense storywise.  Samus isn't exploring a planet or an enemy base this time, she's in a spacestation, one specifically made for research much of such isn't available to the public, and as such Samus is only given access to areas once it is clear that the x have spread there.  And as for the layout, as a research lab a certain degree of isolation is necessary between environments in order for results to be valid.  If that's not a good enough reason then consider the ISS, it isn't a grid it's a collection of modules that are centrally connected because that's how it makes sense to build a large construct in space.    And lastly, the scary bits that really pull the game together require that the player feels an investment in the character which I at least wouldn't have gotten without the interactions with Adam and Samus' internal monologue.  tl;dr I think fusion is best and makes the most sense as it is and that its haters never wanted a ""new"" game, only super metroid with a different paint job"
Metroid,309dmp,ManikMedik,5,Wed Mar 25 21:17:48 2015 UTC,"Before we get started, I'd like to mention one thing:    its haters never wanted a ""new"" game, only super metroid with a different paint job   I don't think anything I said earned me the pejorative ""hater"", as I feel I made a well-reasoned argument as to why I don't feel Fusion is worthy of the praise it receives. Please try to avoid this type of language if you're interested in honest discussion.   In response to your first point - that changing to a linear model with the design of Fusion - I feel that there are plenty of ways to change a game in better ways than this. To name a few things that could've been added as examples might include visors (which were added to newer games), more puzzle-solving (like we found in Prime), or a system wherein your character grows outside of equipment - perhaps a leveling system or skill trees. Not that any of these are necessarily the right answer, but rather that other options do exist outside forcing a linear plot onto the game. Keep in mind the series is largely defined by a feeling of isolation and an interconnected map that can be explored as desired. This was a drastic change.   Your second point - the contention that a hub makes the most sense in a space-based research station - seems specious to me. Laboratories don't isolate different sections by building entirely new buildings for each project. The rooms are separated primarily by airlocks and other similar barriers. It may have been easier to construct in this manner, but they'd likely connect each sector with hallways so a trip ""next door"" didn't mean ""go upstairs, then down the hall, then back downstairs"". That seems like an extraordinary waste of time for the presumed researchers. Not to mention the fact that security locks aren't contingent on the separation into discrete zones. Any individual door could be security-locked as needed.  Lastly, there are plenty of ways to make games scary that don't require a linear level-design. I'm not saying they should have scrapped the story and the dialogue - quite the opposite if you read my original post in which I said I loved the story. They just should've let it evolve as you explored a space station that was better-designed and less linear.   TL;DR: I disagree and feel that the decision to make the game linear was a poor choice and made the game much less ""Metroid"" to me. I felt like - as I said before - a cow being pushed down a chute."
Metroid,309dmp,StormyWaters2021,2,Wed Mar 25 21:42:08 2015 UTC,"While I don't know if we could reach an agreement on which game is best, you're right that hater is entirely the wrong word, I was attempting to lump ""people who think fusion should be more like super"" under a single term and made a poor choice.    That said, I think we have different ideas of what bsl was like before Samus' arrival.  The raised security between each sector, the contrasts between sectors, and what you find after in NOC after fighting the security robot the second time (sorry about the vagueness, don't know how to do spoilers on my phone) make me think that bsl wasn't a very collaborative space and that many of the people who worked there didn't necessarily know or have access to what was going on elsewhere on the station.  However, that's entirely speculation around a question to which without developer input there is no right answer.  And to be clear, while I think the linearity added to the story in fusion and made sense there, I don't believe that super or any of the other games would be better if they were more like fusion, and I actually hope that future games are more along the lines of super.  Fusion was great and will probably always be among my favorite games but that doesn't mean it should define the series.  I like spicy food but that doesn't mean I want all my food spicy."
Metroid,309dmp,ManikMedik,3,Thu Mar 26 11:45:06 2015 UTC,"I was attempting to lump ""people who think fusion should be more like super"" under a single term and made a poor choice.    No hard feelings! Rarely does anyone ever admit to a mistake of any kind, so kudos to you!   As to BSL, I fully understand your point. It's not entirely impossible that it could be so heavily segregated and maybe they did that intentionally, though I think it was more of a gameplay decision than a decision of the realities of space-station laboratory layout schemes! :P   I like spicy food but that doesn't mean I want all my food spicy.   Absolutely! I won't for a moment say that Fusion isn't a great game, and I recently bought it on GBA because it's a great experience.   What I'd really like to see is a traditional Metroid game - in the vein of my favorite (ZM) game - but with more story elements. I don't know how to do that while maintaining the sense of isolation, though adding a Prime-style story where it all unfolds by scanning terminals and whatnot would be an excellent blend. You make it a classic Metroid game with the deep and compelling story told optionally.   Let's just agree that the series as a whole is amazing and iconic."
Metroid,309dmp,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Thu Mar 26 19:13:08 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm in the process of playing through the prime trilogy for the first time (grabbed it for $10 on the wiiu estore :D) and so far I've really liked the scanning mechanic.  It just feels like something Samus would do.   Let's just agree that the series as a whole is amazing and iconic.    Absolutely.
Metroid,309dmp,ManikMedik,0,Fri Mar 27 02:13:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you, a lot of people have shifted to stories being what makes a videogame game.. but for me it will always be the puzzles.

Metroid,309dmp,Chip--Chipperson,0,Thu Mar 26 03:29:46 2015 UTC,"What puzzles? Super Metroid was more like a scavenger hunt. I never solved a puzzle, I just found where to go. The Prime games had actual Puzzles.  Fusion's enemies are extremely difficult compared to Super's pathetically weak enemies. And don't try to call this ""nonsense"", because Metroid has always had a focus on Exploration AND Combat.  And there WERE instances in Fusion where you had to find your way."

Metroid,309dmp,MisterWoodhouse,2,Wed Mar 25 17:27:19 2015 UTC,"I love metroid fusion. I know it's not considered the best metroid game due to how linear it is, given metroid's roots, but I like that despite it being straight forward, even though at first you are given some direction, exploration is still a really imporant aspect of the game, sure, you can't do like skyrim and ignore the main questline for 3 years doing side stuff, but at least it doesn't constrain you to a single hallway like Other M did. There is still a feeling of discovery of places, thanks to the MASSIVE secret areas. Some are as small as a room, while others are as huge as a sector. All that gives the game a feeling of amplitude while not restraining the narrative or sacrificing the player the feeling of freedom."

Metroid,309dmp,LC_Music,-6,Wed Mar 25 19:38:10 2015 UTC,I dont really count prime as metroid games...i completely forgot about them
Metroid,309dmp,StormyWaters2021,7,Wed Mar 25 21:32:12 2015 UTC,"I think the Prime games - in addition to being spectacular games in their own right - are the perfect examples of how to transition from a 2d game to a 3d game.   You had isolation and loneliness on a hostile planet. You had a huge world to find your way through, piecing together information. You had armor and weapons to acquire, unlocking new zones and allowing access to areas previously too-dangerous. There was platforming and puzzle-solving. Plus cool, cinematic boss fights.   Tag on some really interesting story uncovered by scanning things and I think Metroid Prime completely nailed the transition to a different medium."
Metroid,309dmp,LC_Music,-9,Wed Mar 25 22:19:55 2015 UTC,Prime has nothing in common with what makes metroid cool. Its so lacking in atmosphere

Metroid,309v1m,LuxShadow1,2,Thu Mar 26 03:02:41 2015 UTC,"E: Prime Corruption was pretty easy, but I would have to say Zero Mission.  H: Now this is a little interesting because a lot of metroids can get challenging in a lot of different aspects (e.g. bosses, areas to explore, difficulty levels, health and suit upgrades). So one that probably stands out to me is Prime Echoes, but only because the game had a lot of really high learning curve bosses and the dark aether exploring and environments made surviving a little challenging."

AI tells you where to go, what to do, what your objectives are ... simple as it comes.  Hardest was Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. Not only is that game a labyrinth dialed up to 11, but it has a disconnected dark world with hidden entrances/exits, an ammo system that is brutally limited with drops, and the dark worlds environment is toxic. I repeat, the dark world's environment is toxic!!!!!!!  That game frustrated the crap out of me. Then I beat it, and felt like a god."
