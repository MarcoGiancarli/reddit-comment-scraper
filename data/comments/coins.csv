coins,3e2wbx,mozeqq,4,Tue Jul 21 15:23:31 2015 UTC,"Very nice coins. I don't think this would go as whole for a good price, because they are very different coins. Some of them can be almost worthless(I am looking at you commemorative roubles), some around 10-20$(English, German around WWI coins, few others) and some can be worth more(Italian 5 lira, Russian/Polish 10 zlot.), but you have a lot more coins than that and the conditions vary very much. I see circulational coins that are sold for pennies and pre 1800's coins worth definitely more than few pennies(3 grossus 1597 from Riga). I would suggest identify each coin, see the price its selling with similar condition(e.g. on ebay) and try to sell it for a similar, maybe lower price on ebay/local online auction site/reddit. But that can take too much time if you need the money fast. It's gonna be tricky. I think if you take it to an LCS I'm afraid they are going to lowball you hard, because they will see it's very diversified collection and you have no idea what is there. IMHO this is not a goldmine, but you know - 10$ coin+20$ coin+5$ coin and few more and BOOOM! You have 100$ worth of coins(this is a mental shortcut not actual coin valuation)."

For reference, you could send that coin to Midwest Refineries for them to melt it down, and they'd pay $1015 for the gold content alone. You could sell very quickly to a collector for at least $1100, possibly more depending on condition.   Sell on /r/pmsforsale or /r/coins4sale, or eBay if you have a good account with them. There are also other coin/bullion trading forums online you may want to consider.   That 1855 $50 coin needs to be authenticated and graded, as it is extremely valuable if real (think new car to modest house price range). Many members here would be glad to help you with that if you don't have another, more scrupulous, coin shop around to submit it for you.  Is there a mintmark on the 1925 $20? If so, it is also pretty valuable. Depending on condition, those cents could also be worth a decent amount."

He's absolutely correct in that you should be careful selling online. However, over in /r/pmsforsale and /r/coins4sale, we have had a seriously huge volume of transactions, and several sizeable transactions - without a single major issue, and very few small issues.   Additionally, there are a number of very prolific users than you can pretty much count on to do you right in a transaction. Personally, I can state that my reputation on those subreddits is of far greater value to me than I could ever hope to gain by ripping someone off on a trade even if I were so inclined. There are quite a few users there with extensive transaction histories that I'm sure feel similarly.   There are definitely risks inherent in doing business online. However, speaking as someone who has both bought and sold on those subreddits on a volume well into the five-figure range with a success rate well over 99%, I would assert that it's well worth the calculated risk when compared to selling to a local shop, especially considering that yours seems to like low ball offers.  Basically, be careful and do your due diligence, but you'd be ill-advised to completely avoid online venues for liquidating your collection."
