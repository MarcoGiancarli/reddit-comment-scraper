I've read about a number of serial killers who rented rooms to seniors and killed them for their benefits. It's amazing how long these schemes can go too. One case I read about only ended when a man ran out of the house wearing nothing but a dog collar. The neighbor finally reported it, but nobody seemed to notice the revolving door of geriatric tenants or the half dozen SS checks in the mailbox."

Even if that were the case, I'm fairly confident that the human lung can withstand being forced to expel the air inside of it. ALL OF THAT BEING SAID, why the fuck would she die without air in her lungs? When you breath in, your lungs are sending air into your bloodstream, it's not like this thing sucks the air from out of your blood or anything."

Eventually the operator decides to open the seal and these women just lie there like lifeless barbie dolls, sometimes you can't even tell whether they're breathing. Slowly over time, you watch their lungers start to pump air, faintly at first until a minute later it's become stronger and you realize they haven't killed her.
