I heard he didn't like the direction of the character and Lena wouldn't allow me any creativeness on the character so because of that, he left.  Guess he couldn't make it on his own and is running back to a bridge he burned.... I kinda hope they don't let him come back."
girls,3bghd2,decoyq,5,Mon Jun 29 12:37:01 2015 UTC,"To be honest, it would be an interesting storyline for Marnie after just getting engaged to Desi for Charlie to just show up, especially after how ridiculous she's gotten with Desi. I feel like Charlie would call her on all her obnoxious shit and it would potentially be a way for Marnie to become a likable character again."
girls,3bghd2,secondandfive,3,Wed Jul 1 05:02:46 2015 UTC,That wedding can't happen. I hate Desi. I wish they would have let Desi go after he doesn't show up and leaves Marnie to perform by herself. That was a nice moment for her.
girls,3bghd2,Christianne78,3,Thu Jul 2 19:56:01 2015 UTC,What about Ray? The series began with Ray and Charlie being besties...even going so far as to have Ray chew Marnie out in episode 2 or 3 (I forget) about being a terrible human to Charlie. Fast forward 4 seasons and now it's he who has an unrequited love for her.  Charlie returning I think would cause more strife in that relationship than with Desi. But my bet has always been that Desi won't be returning...that after being ripped a new one by Ray he will have run off.

girls,39k95r,TheMeatball,48,Fri Jun 12 13:29:11 2015 UTC,"I think it's largely because of Reddit's not-so-secret undercurrent of misogyny and anti-feminist views. Lena Dunham is pretty outspoken and open about sexuality and her body, which isn't the petite supermodel ideal that reddit likes.  Which is a shame, because I think the humor on Girls is right up Reddit's alley."

girls,39k95r,LRGinCharge,13,Sat Jun 13 05:40:14 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but the double standards I see on Reddit not even in those subs is astounding. I've seen a girl post in r/relationships about how she tried to be patient with her boyfriend who wasn't interested in sex for 2 years, but since he wasn't working on it she had to move on. She was torn apart by men who said she should've tried harder, been more understanding, etc. But I've also seen in r/marriage men talk about their wives not wanting sex, and all the comments are immediately ""Divorce her, you have needs, you shouldn't apologize for it."" This is just one tiny example. Jokes about all women being sluts, or all women being gold diggers abound on reddit with thousands of upvotes every day. If you say anything about men in a generalized way, you are torn apart."

girls,39k95r,cupcakesarethedevil,0,Tue Jun 16 01:18:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't even understand how the show is considered feminist. Before Jessa's abortion, but Marney equates getting pregnant to being irresponsible. Hannah tries to quits her job for feminist reason rather than communicate displeasure and leaves out of embarrassment. Marney, Shoshana, and Jessa, all try to marry rich despite hating their partners at one point or another. Hannah is frequently upset with Adam in the season 1 and 2 despite having no idea what she wants. Everything about Marney not getting over Charlie in season 3, and Marney's bitter mother.  Hannah's relationship with her mother, aunts and cousins is terrible. Mimi-Rose makes some kind of feminist art professionally and is shown to be the most manipulative person ever. Adam's sister must be forcibly carried to the hospital out of stubbornness to give birth on her own terms. Other than addressing these topics head on I am not sure the message of the series is all that liberal or feminist."
girls,39k95r,iwpoe,5,Mon Jun 15 08:40:14 2015 UTC,"Well,feminism doesn't mean ""we have to say that every woman is always right"" feminism mean that women are normal people like men,they have flaws and they can do some very bad or stupid things like men does. Also,Hannah sure hasn't a body of a top model,but she isn't afraid to show it,and she doesn't feel sorry for it. The characters often have casual sex,and no one calls them s***t or judge them for that. Hannah is a very feminist writer (we see this in Iowa). Mimi-Rose chose the abortion and she doesn't feel sorry for it,because it's her free choice,and only her can decide what to do with her body. Those are only some of the examples of why Girls is a feminist show."
girls,39k95r,iwpoe,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:49:57 2015 UTC,"Mimi-Rose chose the abortion and she doesn't feel sorry for it, which is fine, but she also doesn't feel bad that she didn't even consider that Adam might feel bad enough to present it to him well, which is why she's, as she proves later, a bad person and lover."
girls,39k95r,TheMeatball,2,Tue Jun 30 04:08:47 2015 UTC,"Yes she was wrong not telling Adam of the abortion,but she was right thinking that it was her own choice to make...i'm sure Adam would have let her do it,so she could have tell it to him,but at the same time,they were together since just a few weeks,maybe she was afraid to say something like that to him."

girls,39k95r,iwpoe,2,Tue Jul 7 08:33:22 2015 UTC,I agree. I guess Lena Dunham is an outspoken feminist and through some transitive property people label her show to be feminist too.
girls,39k95r,FakeColours,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:00:19 2015 UTC,"I think you've come to equate feminism with 'women never having negative feelings in life', which is silly. Why isn't having difficulty getting over charlie compatible with feminism? Why is family strife not acceptable in feminism (as opposed to in general)? Why can't you marry someone you sometimes hate (or even marry for money) within feminism? Why is being bitter incompatible with feminism? Why is Adam's sister being taken to the hospital because she's risking herself anti-feminist? Mimi-Rose is a loon who does superficial performance art because she's a loon. A woman can be a loon and feminism still make sense.  Trying to prevent the subordination of women as a class is simply not the same as trying to prevent all discomfort suffered by women at all times and all places. All that strings these examples together is some woman is either uncomfortable or making others uncomfortable."
girls,39k95r,glaceauglaceau,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:06:59 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with you that the show is intentionally uncomfortable to watch and it tries to walk the line so that both sides of the controversy it creates can be argued.   But I definitely see a lot of tropes that feminists criticize in modern movies and TV shows present in Girls. The most common tropes I see criticized are as follows:     Female characters are one dimensional Females characters are needy/dependent on men Female characters cannot get along with other female characters/are to emotional to make decisions   The first point is usually the result of having a small cast and only one or two female characters that end up representing all women everywhere and having a more plot based less character driven story. The show definitely doesn't have a problem with few female roles and hardly any overarching plot and therefore has room for many multi-dimensional characters.  I would argue that just because it shows them having more than one feeling or worldview makes frequent occurrence of the next two points all the more scathing. In other words, despite all of there different experiences, enviroments and temperments, the girls lives still largely all revolve around the men they are interested in or are in romantic relationships with."
girls,39k95r,FakeColours,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:15:18 2015 UTC,"The ""characters"" you would generate with this scheme would be themselves one-dimensional golden flawless non-sense. Those tropes exist because people are often needy and dependent on their partners and don't always get along. The question is whether the women in girls are only that, not whether those tropes are present. The show succeeds in executing its concept insofar as it portrays women who work through dependence (though Marnie clearly isn't there yet, however she's a trope inversion of the ""perfect girl"", so they're playing some kind of long game with her) and come through conflict with renewed friendship.  While your list of verboten tropes makes your list of scorned plot points make more sense, your core idea about story-writing is ideological and pig-headed, possibly even self-blind. These characters do not ring as false, and if they are then that's where you should focus your critical energy, and their ultimate trajectory seems to point in a good direction (except Marnie, maybe, it depends on whether she can become self-aware and act on it). You would have media write stories as if they were ideological tracts about the best way to live."

In any case, I really do think the anti-feminism is a big part of Reddit's dislike for the Lena Dunham and by association, her show. If you search her name, the top results are stuff like MensRights, TheRedPill, TumblrInAction, etc. All the anti-feminist communities. There's an active opposition to that kinda of viewpoint on Reddit, so it's hard to have a discussion about an outspoken feminist and her work without that subculture dominating the conversation.  Just my view."
girls,39k95r,punklee,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:39:26 2015 UTC,"I didn't equate misogyny and anti-feminism. I would also disagree that being anti-feminist makes you inherently intelligent. I feel like you're using a very narrow and specially tailored definition of feminist to rally against for some reason.  Lena's character is definitely unlikeable, the flawed protagonist is one of the reasons I like the show so much. Real people are flawed and unlikeable sometimes. They fuck up, they do selfish or hurtful things and have to deal with the consequences. I like seeing stories like that instead of the flawless hero who is just being misunderstood left and right.  You have a problem with ugly people loving themselves? Should they just wallow in self pity?"
girls,39k95r,paint-by-numbers,9,Tue Jul 7 17:41:56 2015 UTC,"Well to try and add to this discussion, even though I'm probably not the target audience( I'm a straight guy, early 30's) I like the show.  I'm not sure it has anything to do with feminism. I think it's as simple as people just don't like the characters. Lets be honest, the majority of the Girls are unlikable. Marnie is a straight up bitch. Hannah is selfish and self centered. Jessa and Shosh are probably the ones with the most likable qualities, but Shosh is probably a bit too quirky for some peoples tastes and gets little air time. Jessa is fantastic though. Not only the best character but also the hottest by far IMO. Anyway, Hannah is the main character and the last season focused on her and also mainly on Marnie and Desi who are two of the most superficial characters ive ever seen on a tv show.  So for those reasons I think that's why people dislike the show, they hate the characters."

girls,39k95r,nodevon,3,Tue Jul 7 18:38:52 2015 UTC,"In the first few seasons of Breaking Bad, Walt is contrasted with Marie. As a member of the audience you hate Marie for being selfish and shop lifting and denying it, while you continually find it in your heart to forgive Walt for each murder because you see it wear on his conscience and deep down you hope he will overcome his pride to save himself and his family. In Girls in the very first episode Hannah hardly hesitates to steal the money her parents left for the maid and skips off into the sunset. Essentially, people hate pettiness."
girls,39k95r,cupcakesarethedevil,2,Tue Jul 7 18:50:29 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of Girls. And I think you bring up a good point about other shows having unlikeable characters, too. I think, though, that Girls is more superficial, or at least for those who aren't willing to give it a chance it seems like it doesn't cover real issues. I've seen Breaking Bad and it seems to cover a lot more ""deep"" subject matter such as family, sin, regret, etc."
girls,39k95r,AntithesisRex,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:56:33 2015 UTC,"Characters need to be entertaining first and foremost being as it is a tv show, and if you're going to have unlikeable characters, they need to have something else going for them. TV and film is filled with unlikeable characters, but the most popular ones are entertaining+compelling+interesting, and there is usually a charismatic actor playing the role. A number of the characters and storylines on the show are usually missing at least two of those things, in some instances they are missing all of them. I think that is the problem.    On top of that, Lena Dunham is a controversial person that not everyone is going to like. Some people think she only has a show due to personal connections, some people can't handle seeing someone who doesn't fit the typical actress mold be on tv(and be naked), and some people think she is a pedophile/false rape accuser after her book came out. Some people find her to be flat out annoying in the general sense. I feel like this covers the general reasons why some people dislike her, and also the show."

If I were to describe the plot points of it to you, dropping out of school, getting drunk and hanging out of prostitutes, you might be convinced its a bad book for teenagers and think reading it should be discouraged. While in reality, the author isn't saying doing any of those things is a good idea either. Essentially every character in Girls acts selfishly at one point or another and those scenes taken out of context make it appear like Lena Dunham,as the writer, endorses those actions. In addition, her persona outside of the show feeds into their confirmation bias."

girls,37stmr,b0l,4,Sat May 30 03:05:39 2015 UTC,"It's not short for anything. I have a 40-ish year old friend named Marnie, actually."
girls,37stmr,AthenaQ,3,Sat May 30 17:16:14 2015 UTC,"Marni(e) by itself is a common jewish name, pretty sure its just marnie!"
girls,37stmr,colourswhileisleep,3,Sat May 30 18:00:48 2015 UTC,Upvote for this awesome list of Marn- names.
girls,37stmr,pizzamarie,3,Sun May 31 00:06:28 2015 UTC,"Probs Marnacle.  Show's over guys, move on.  It's Marnacle.  We're done here."
girls,37stmr,pizzamarie,1 point,Sun May 31 00:06:49 2015 UTC,"I have a cousin who goes by Marnie and her actual name is Marlana. But as others said, I think Marnie is simply Marnie."

girls,37stmr,WolfVamp826,-1,Fri Jul 17 05:57:30 2015 UTC,Margaret?  Googled Marnie and there's a Hitchcock movie named Marnie where the character's actual name is Margaret.

girls,37m5j6,winstonfiore,3,Thu May 28 17:08:22 2015 UTC,If you like that scene watch the show! You will love it and it just keeps getting better.
girls,37m5j6,stinkyoldcheese,2,Thu May 28 18:46:22 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you have far surpassed the Adam character in emotional maturity then. That is a very good thing! lol  Yeah, if that clip affected you, then you would definitely like the Hannah/Adam story line, which has been a main part of the show so far. Also, I think that Adam Driver is at his most entertaining/interesting in Girls, so you would probably like the show if you are at all into his work.   It looks like the new HBO Now has a free trial week that you could use if you have the products to watch it. Hopefully they get to a point where you can sign up for it on any device/computer."

girls,34vlf0,Jehnay,15,Tue May 5 01:55:55 2015 UTC,"That's Darth Adam. More like, ""The narcissism's strong with you."""
girls,34vlf0,fujbuj,3,Mon May 4 23:36:32 2015 UTC,Love this. I didn't think I could be more excited for Star Wars!
girls,34vlf0,igotcivilrights,3,Tue May 5 00:29:33 2015 UTC,As if Adam Driver wasn't already amazing.
girls,34vlf0,ruetaine,0,Tue May 5 15:32:49 2015 UTC,Who is Adam Driver? What was he on before?
