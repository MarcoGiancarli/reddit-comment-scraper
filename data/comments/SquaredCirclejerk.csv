John Cena is good, yeah 8/10 when he has a Steen or a BryDan to carry him.   I think I speak for every demographic when I say that as a fat sarcastic unshaven guy, Kevin Steen represents all of us. Pushing him to the moon is the best way for WWE to cater to me I mean everyone.

So much so that it is actually dangerous to put heels together because its possible to put someone over by just being marginally ""less bad"".  Put it this way Luke Skywalker is a sissy and if it wasn't for Darth Vader Star Wars becomes un-compelling.  So a heel without an angle is buried plain put.  The causing of friction between those three (steen, the Celtic warrior, and the Bulgarian) is also a step back since it sets back their current storylines, and confuses the viewers while risking a possibility of an organic face turn.  So you basically have 4 heels without any active story line and one of them is the champion of this whole debacle...  Like it or not unless they cut out the promos and fake friction and just wrestle good matches this wrestling promotion will be under constant scrutiny until the demise of the company."

You just get tired of hearing the same uninformed shit repeated as gospel, and it gets to you. I never used to be the guy who argued on the Internet. I'm a grown man with a job and fiancée. I don't want to take wrestling this seriously. I just want to kind of dummy out, drink beer, and have somewhere to bullshit about the matches with. But I can't stomach another fucking 10,000 word essay on how Steen is buried or how the Bellas are ruining women's wrestling or how racist Vince McMahon is. That place has broken me."

Back to the point, what do I think of Steen being buried by having to tap out to literally the worst submission of all time? Well, I think that's a shame. I think Cena needs to grow up and start putting young talent over (not like he did at Elimination Chamber though, that wasn't convincing enough). It's shit like this that reminds me of 2000 WCW and convinces me that literally no one will still watch McBlind's shitty fucking product in a few years because of alternatives like NJPW (DAE G1?), LU (DAE cinematography?), and ROH (DAE Cheeseburger?)...obviously TNA doesn't count because it'll be dead within the next year.
