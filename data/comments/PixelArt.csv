Dithering is like that; basically, a way to use two colors close together, but slightly offset, to create the illusion of a third color.  It is useful for shading.  :)"

PixelArt,3e2gio,croakiee,4,Tue Jul 21 13:13:57 2015 UTC,"Well, to be honest, I feel like that decisions is largely based on the context of the character. As it is here, standing alone against a solid background, I personally feel like the colored outline is far better. The black outline here especially against light shades like the hair and such really seem to make it less smooth and clean.   But if you're using this as a game character you'll have to try it in multiple scenes/colors you intend to use and assure that your character has plenty of contrast without the dark outline so it doesn't get lost in the mix. Otherwise possibly the outline would be necessary.   I really like your art style, it's really unique and your colors are great, I think either way you go you have a really solid sprite, I love it, keep it up!"
PixelArt,3e2gio,Coldn,2,Tue Jul 21 14:42:38 2015 UTC,"They will most likely just be in a text box next to dialogue, so I'll probably go with the colored outline. Thank you very much, this was very helpful!"

I'd avoid it. position the dirt pattern so it doesn't have 4 weird bumps near the grass don't shade things like the house the way you did.

PixelArt,3e0grv,FekketCantenel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:02:21 2015 UTC,"pixel art is a very specific medium   Certainly, in the days of early video game development, there were very real and specific limitations on how many colors could be displayed at once...but to be fair, I'm not creating assets for an NES, Genesis, or PSX game!  Modern systems can display millions of colors and if the aesthetic you're going for can take advantage of that, then why not?    why did you change your approach?   I just felt like it, really.  Sometimes that's all it takes!  That's not to say I won't create more ""traditional"" pieces in the future, of course - one of their advantages is that they can be created and iterated much more quickly than pieces touched up with low-opacity highlights and shadows."
PixelArt,3e0grv,KevoMojo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:14 2015 UTC,"This conversation quickly turns into a ""what is pixel art"" conversation. In this sub-reddit we follow Cure's explanation of what qualifies something as pixel art.  You're not really taking advantage of modern systems/technology. There's no anti-alias on the edge of your creature which just leaves jagged lines. Even more accepted pixel art don't have those jagged edges, because they can't be hidden by engine anti-aliasing. What you've done is block out rough shapes using the pencil tool and then treat them like masks. This is why you have 7K colors. You instantly forfeit a majority of your control in pixel art when you opt to use dirty tools. Control is very important in pixel art. Using the low opacity brush creates a lot of very noisy spots, it's very apparent on the open hand. The edge of the webbing on his hand gets the same lighting as the top of the hand. And the bottom of the foot get's lighting. This lack of attention to details, the extremely large color count and the approach you've taken really just disqualify this as pixel art. And while I'm very aware that mediums evolve and we should be open to this, there is only so much a medium can deviate from it's origin before it becomes something else. For example, clay sculptures can't be made with cement.  This feels like a rushed effort. Spending a little more time on this without relying so heavily on short cuts could result in a truly terrifyingly beautiful piece.  I really hope this didn't come across as rude, or read in an angry voice. It's hard to hear something you created isn't what you think it is. You intended for it to be pixel art, but you have a definition that is a bit different than others. Sorry."

The second darkest shade on the ogre seems too light. This creates a really harsh juxtaposition between the last couple shades. It makes the darkest shade look more like random blocks of color that are cutting the ogre apart, rather than shading.   Try making your second darkest shade a bit darker, expanding it, and removing some of the darkest shade you have now (leaving it only in the darkest crevices of the ogre's body). Then, add some dithering like you do between the ogre's skin tone and the first green you use for shading.  Shading is one of my weakspots but I hope that helps!"

I'm not sure what you're using to animate (apologies I'm not familiar with much other than photoshop) but at least on the idle animation, increase the time between frames entirely and depending on your number of frames, possibly increase time between ""breathes"" or ""bounces"". I think that's a really simple change that would make it less ""bouncy""  Some of the same could probably be used for the stabbing animation as well, when the blade draws back, hold it there an extra frame before stabbing, and maybe an extra frame after the stab.   Anyway, just trying to provide some advice, just keep in mind the timing of your frames is nearly as important as the transition inside the frames themselves. Good luck and I like your sprites :)"

Also, the background is messy and is drawing a lot more focus then the actual gate itself.  Overall: B+. Could easily be improved with a few atmospheric changes."
PixelArt,3due8o,Braddyapples,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:34:24 2015 UTC,"What am i doing wrong ? I would really like some criticism. I wasn't too happy with how the gate looked, so I put it in a vibrant context, using all kinds of effects to take the focus off it a little."

PixelArt,3dtxez,CheezieCrakerz,5,Sun Jul 19 14:51:31 2015 UTC,"Work without black line outlines is, in my opinion, much harder than work with outlines. While you've certainly got a good start going, you might more readily see flaws if you start using outlines. It will also help distinguish your foreground, focused areas so you don't accidentally focus too much on background things like the boar's front-left leg."

PixelArt,3dwyrz,AsuMagic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:50:50 2015 UTC,Another medium meaning vector art or a less precise raster art form.  In pixel art every pixel makes a difference and when you're making such large pieces (128x128) for smaller parts of the whole. Doing some quick math and even quicker (messier) google-fu it looks like you character's arms are gonna be on a 384x? canvas.  Why did you choose pixel art?

Also the saturation on the background is WAY too high and it's going to clutter up your screen and make actual game elements less visible.  I would try either bumping the character's resolution up or the backgrounds down so that they fit together better.
PixelArt,3dr7aj,AuraTummyache,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:22:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for answering! I will experiment with both scenarios and let you know!

One option would be to make the character's resolution higher, but the background's resolution lower. This would amount to the same thing as focus in photographs (less detailed, ""blurry"" background to aid focusing the eye on the main subject). Now they're exactly the other way round, so it feels like the background is the main subject and the character is ""out of focus"""

You can add small scars or pock marks using the shadow tone. Use some jagged shapes to create hairs that stick out. Look at some anime or pokemon images for reference (they have really interesting techniques for 2/3-tone hair).  Feel like the shading on the hat could do with some work too.

You could also try playing around with facial expressions, duplicate some of the frames and keep the mouth but change the eyes/brow a little for these frames.  The cartoony look lends itself well to over exaggerated facial gestures, make the most of it :)"

Other than that, maybe adding some shading on the neck would do the trick. Also on both views the shading might be a bit too light to be really noticeable when the character is seen at a smaller scale.    Your front view looks really good in any case!"
PixelArt,3dp6n4,OIIOIIOI,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:45:14 2015 UTC,Yeah I had the heights right and I still wasn't happy and then  I just started messing around and wound up uploading this one.   The shading is a good tip! I have a outlined version with darker shades.   My main problem is I just don't feel like it's the same character. The head just looks all wrong to me. I don't know though. Thanks for the feedback!
PixelArt,3dp6n4,Lyfultruth,2,Sat Jul 18 14:08:57 2015 UTC,"The profile of the head is not anatomically correct. Even at this scale, there should at least be shadow beneath the ear to suggest a jaw line. The ear is also too far forward. Anatomy in general feels a little too off, even for this resolution and stylisation. None of that applies to the forwards pose.   Don't assume you have to use the same pixels for the nose in the front view and the profile. It is likely more readable to have a single light pixel in the profile for a nose than it is to have 3 dark pixels for a nose."

PixelArt,3dlecz,BurritoEclair,3,Fri Jul 17 10:57:42 2015 UTC,"I understand this.  This is a personal project of ours we're taking very seriously. Their are technically seven people working on this. The three co-founders of the team, two programmers, and two engine developers. The game will be completed in full regardless of what happens. We are trying to aim for something that will be fun, yet at the same time not outside our ability.  One of the things that I mentioned, us making video game mods. This is way harder than making your own game. You have to reverse engineer someone else's code, figure out formats, abiding by someone else's limits, and then find ways to compile it. For us to have spent two years on a mod, and still having some members work on a certain mod to deliver to our community must show we're dedicated to completing something, no matter what the cost and time.  In the event I am wrong about everything I said and the project is cancelled, a payment will be given. I can't assure you an amount at this point; all I can say is we'd discuss it. It'd be worked out. We would not use the assets you made until payment is delivered if the project was cancelled in any project what so ever."

He's made some great things to begin with, but nothing that has really fit with our envision for this game. He also knows some programming, though he hasn't yet contributed to this project in that way as of now; in the future he may.

I think it'd be cool if there was a little more in the background. Although I think they look good the way they are, have you considered varying the eyes more since they all have basically two black pixels for pupils except the big guy?  Theyre all so different but their eyes are all the same, maybe its a deliberate style?"

The left most one was my first and I tried to have a very basic style along with shading but it's slowly evolved into the farthest left sprites. Do you recommend anything when it comes to eyes on such a small scale?"
PixelArt,3ddk2k,Nosearmy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:37:52 2015 UTC,"i have no pixel art experience, I'm just a fan and I do some drawing of my own, but I guess you could play around with different colors, I love the Green eyes on the big guy, and feel free to make them nonsymmetrical, or even two slightly different sizes, on the same character. But the more I look, you may be right, the scale may just prevent too much variation on the eyes.  Anyway, love it the way it is."

I think it'd work if you are doing some puppet work like I did here for much higher res art.  Things look a lot nicer rendered through JSON instead of exported as a gif. At least with phaser.js  It has a pixel perfect mode, but I think that works better with larger layered pieces that don't require rotations. Rotations never really work too well with pixel art. Tis it's nature."

PixelArt,3dah19,AsuMagic,2,Tue Jul 14 19:32:45 2015 UTC,"You might want to either ditch the black outlines, or add a little more depth to the blade.  Real blades have a sharp crease down the middle that makes one side brighter than the other. Like this sword I drew for Pixel Dailies a few days ago.  Also the handle is a little bit too long I think, if only by 2 or 3 pixels.  I think the color choices and the fundamentals are pretty great, if the object itself is a bit drab.  Sometimes a shoddy dagger has to look boring though.  Only real improvement, without changing the design entirely, would be the shading on that blade.  It's looking very flat."
PixelArt,3dah19,AuraTummyache,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:31:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I've tried adding a light source from the top left so I did add some shading to the handle as well : http://i.imgur.com/EfDH2z1.png - I believe the shading should be okay now, I don't really know. By the way, your sword looks pretty good, I especially like the shadowing."

PixelArt,3d5kjl,mmwafflez,2,Mon Jul 13 18:22:39 2015 UTC,"I really like the design, but I think it might be a little bit too simple.  It's also a little too obvious how you're ""cheating"" by flipping the sprite and coloring in certain parts (his hair is backwards when he's turned around for instance.)  It would be cooler if a little more effort was thrown at it.  It certainly does not look bad, but it does not look as good as it could in my opinion.  If it were me drawing it, I'd add some shading just all over the place, fix the top of the head on the side frames, add some more detail to that belt, and try to do something more interesting with the face.  Always a big fan of the goat legs though, that's a personal favorite of mine."

The composition is really nice too!  If I had to give one observation it's that you shouldn't be afraid to use more contrast on objects and characters, it can really add depth, especially at 1x pixels.   I thinking adding more warm colours into your highlights will definitely ground the characters in the environment more as well.

PixelArt,3d1c1d,Timvdlinde,3,Mon Jul 13 03:49:06 2015 UTC,"I made some alterations to the middle barrel that I think might improve it, generally rounding off the shading and offsetting your 'lightest' value to be a little more central improves the sense of depth, adding a bit of shading underneath any extrusions helps bring them out a bit too, as well as some stylistic curving of the shadows. Try and keep your outline semi-consistent with the shading of the interior and your logo will read better if you add a bit of shading around it, too.

PixelArt,3d2wa5,Tzun,2,Mon Jul 13 02:23:52 2015 UTC,"Well originally on the something awful forums, pixel wars was created in which people would create sprites of their faction members and maps in ms paint and edit the map to place their units then upload in a post with a comment of their moves then the opponent would copy that picture and edit their guys to tell a story by back and forth copying and editing. Eventually the community split and now the main board is called picture wars. I was pretty into it about 6 years ago or so but have since fallen off. I don't know how active the community is but the last forum was picture wars.net. However, it could have moved since then. Googling it and looking for a forum that has what I described above is a good place to start.

PixelArt,3d3pwl,silentSpector,2,Mon Jul 13 11:29:19 2015 UTC,I think you might need some sort of overlay layer early on to help sculpt the highlights and shadows. Especially to match the style of your base sprite. Get rid of the 1px outlines if everything is 4px.  Do you make any pixel art or is this programming practice?
PixelArt,3d3pwl,BurritoEclair,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:34:06 2015 UTC,"Matching the base sprite is not a hard requirement. Eventually I want to extend this to generate an entire humanoid (arms, legs, torso, etc.)... I'm using the base to help guide shape and proportions.  In this case, the contrast between the base's 4x4 and my program's 1x1 seems weird.   It might work if I had a 1x1 base but I don't know. I guess in general it's good to keep a consistent ""pixel"" size.   help sculpt the highlights and shadows   This is the part of your comment where I really want advice... how exactly would you add highlights and shadows to a flat sprite like this? If you can describe the technique in a series of logical steps then I can probably codify it.  Also curious what you mean by overlay layer, the script actually builds two images; the one you see as output and a hidden ""map"" that is used to define different regions of the 64x64 square. Each region defines what type (color) pixels can be drawn in that part of the image.   Do you make any pixel art or is this programming practice?   Not seriously, I'm just a fan. I'm probably much better at making art via code vs. drawing anything freehand :D"

PixelArt,3d311p,Tzun,2,Mon Jul 13 03:05:12 2015 UTC,"First thing to work on is to clean up your outlines. Basically, eliminate any 90 degree corners you see and smooth out the lines as you go. Also, there are lines in the wings that portray folds in the skin (I think) but you could probably do that with shading, since it stands out a lot as an outline.   Next thing is that you're using a lot of colors. Narrow down your color palette to about 16 colors. My general rule of thumb for color palettes is 3-5 shades per basic color, so a darker shade for shadows, a mid-range color, and maybe a highlighting color, and an additional two colors for just in case something comes up during the process.   A lot of your shading is banding, where it follows the outlines. It doesn't really define the shape of the dragon. As it stands, the dragon looks 2D, not 3D, so perhaps practice shading with geometric shapes like cylinders and spheres and then try applying that to the pixel.   Anatomy is my weakest area. However, there are a few things that don't make sense in this sprite. I believe you may be missing a line that separates the left wing arm from the chest, since it looks like one whole awkward piece right now. Also, on the right wing, the gray part (which is the fleshy arm I assume) doesn't quite line up with the wing shape. A good thing to reference for this are bat wings like here or here.   This is a pretty quick overview of what I see at first glance. I'd love it if you could provide the pixel art at the original resolution/size since it helps for people like me who look at the pixel in their own programs to find smaller details.   If something confuses you, please ask!"

PixelArt,3d16hs,UnnamedProject,2,Sun Jul 12 17:47:05 2015 UTC,"After talking with a couple of friends, we've agreed on starting an online project where we will help promote artists works and build a community around them, so that you can talk with other artists with a similar mindset and connect with the fans who find your work worth sharing.   How would it be different from DeviantArt ?"
PixelArt,3d16hs,nounoursheureux,2,Sun Jul 12 19:51:31 2015 UTC,"Hello there, that's a good question.   Deviant art is more like a gallery where users submit their content and then it's seen by whoever accesses it. Unless you're specifically looking for it, you won't stumble upon DA. Ask people who aren't into the digital art environment and they won't know what Deviant Art is.   We want to help by promoting the pieces so that the average Joe gets to know the who the artist is and why they make the pieces of art. I've personally read extensively about digital marketing and would like to give advice on subjects like the personal branding of the artist and what their target audiences could be, for example. We'd like to host courses and give those with the skill the ability to help others, and those with the passion the tools they need to grow in their career.  Another thing is that Deviant art is mainly graphic and does not allow the submission of any music oriented files. According to their FAQ ""[they] currently have no plans to include music within [their] galleries."" We want to get involved with music and writing also so that you can have your artwork as the album cover for an upcoming artist, or your lyrics on a song.  I first got to know about this whole digital art world years ago thanks to DA, and I love how big they've become since, but they don't market to the general public, and that's where we want to help. We want to build a community around the artists, not a community for artists only.  Again, we're in planning stages and this is still slowly being shaped, therefore we want to hear what the artist perspective is as they hold the leading role in the whole project.   Any thoughts? :)"
PixelArt,3d16hs,kolkurtz,2,Sun Jul 12 22:16:59 2015 UTC,"You might have your work cut out. As soon as an artist gets to a professional level they need to STOP sharing. If you are good at something you don't give it away for free. You might do better trying to connect people who need pixel artists with the actual artists. Jobs are not so easy to find and briefs are often badly specified. The whole pixelart tutorial thing is already covered. As to communities of non artists, they just share things to their social media if at all. I think you have a decent idea but it has way too much competition and not enough USP. It is a pain trying to host your art in different places, trust me."
PixelArt,3d16hs,kolkurtz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:40:49 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for your input. I sincerely appreciate it.

I don't think there's any problem in giving any credit where it's due.

PixelArt,3cwhp6,silentSpector,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:23:22 2015 UTC,"I think this requires either someone to take the lead and make decisions (theme, perspective, palette) or for a series of voted threads to be made leading up to the ""event"".  A big problem with this sort of thing is creating both a consistent style (a style guide will help) and quality (C+C through out, very limited ""good job""ing). I know Pixelation or PixelJoint were doing this for a platformer game (I even joined in a little), and maybe it's best suited on a forum instead of stickied on a sub reddit. Regardless I think it's worth a try if enough people are willing to work together.  Whomever is organizing the project needs to do a few VERY important things. First make sure everyone is aware of the intent of this project, is credited (making something and editting), accept that if they plop something down and say they don't want to finish it someone else CAN finish it and will be credited as a co-creator.  MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS STUFF PLEASE."
PixelArt,3cwhp6,BurritoEclair,2,Sun Jul 12 01:20:52 2015 UTC,"This.

I just finished this one up last night, so I thought I'd share. The following is the same as the description on my DA, but it's pretty good explanation so I thought I'd just paste it.  I've been on a huge GW2 kick lately, so I thought I'd do some fanart of my main character in the final armor/weapons I'm aiming for! Here is the reference image. It will take a HUGE amount of work (especially the sword, which is over 1100g and I feel rich if I have 15g), but it's going to be SO rewarding when I get it!  I'm pretty near to having all of the armor I need, and to the materials I'll need to craft the backpiece. We'll see if the game holds my attention long enough to even get that sword!  So here are the stats:   Head: Wreath of Cooperation (gemstore skin, obtained) Shoulders: Ascalonian Protector Pauldrons (dungeon armor, obtained) Gloves: Priory's Historical Gauntlets (faction armor, obtained) Chest: Carapace Breastplate (quest/achievement reward, not obtained) Legs: Carapace Tassets (living story reward, not obtained) Feet: Branded Greaves (random loot, obtained) Back: Light of Dwayna (crafted item, not obtained) Sword: Infinite Light (crafted item, not obtained)   Not pictured:   Torch: Tonn's Brazier (crafted item, not obtained) Greatsword: Tonn's Claymore (crafted item, not obtained)"

I really like the power lines and the sky. The clouds look great. The color palette is makes the situation feel bleak, dry, and post apocalyptic. The people are interesting, definitely not bad at all.   I would put parallax backgrounds with a skyline or other distant objects like broken down or over grown houses and roads and hills and stuff  Depending on the style you're going for, maybe focus on perspective and conveying volume. You can also covey distance and importance by making distant or unimportant things less detailed or covered in a thin fog (or slightly blurry but that doesn't usually look good to me with pixel art) you may want to add a shadow on the columns on the opposite face of the direction to the sun and curve the shadow from the road portion as it goes along the curved (if the column is supposed to be cylindrical) surface  For example, the sides of things in different places and the lines on the sidewalk seem to be at the same angle to the camera and the columns supporting the highways seem flat (this may be desirable depending on the attempted style of the game.)  Try to make sure every part of the wall casts a shadow, it seems some parts were left out. If you can get the people to cast a shadow too that may look good"

EDIT: Here's a 15 minute edit just dulling down the outlines, with more time I would have used different colors for different outlines to make it easier to read. In the end you want to try to use less outlines and use different shading instead. Lastly the wood... I'm not a great pixel artist (or artist at all) and I'm terrible at doing a big textured surface like wood, water, or grass etc. My only recommendation there is to just crop the image to take focus away from the wood and bring all the focus to the cup.

May I ask,  What inspired you to do pixel art?   I personally don't know where to start. I did a box tutorial. That's as far and ""good"" as I've gotten. Lol!  I'd like to eventually make bustling pixel cities. :D    Also, what is that supposed to be behind the bar? Is that a staircase? =)"
PixelArt,3cs0xk,lazylearner,2,Fri Jul 10 09:22:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I don't know what inspired me... I remember back in 2012 (when I was 11) I started playing loads of retro games and decided I wanted to get into pixel art. But, like most 11 years olds in relation to anything, I quickly lost interest. However, this year my interest was rekindled when  I discovered my first ""decent"" artwork from October 2012.   In terms of where to start, I just saw designs I liked, copied them and then changed them in varying degrees of significance before they became my own. After that I started doing work without reference, like the drawing above.   My two best pieces of advice are;   If you're doing something you love, but being criticised for stealing from other artists (even if its original work) then you're doing it wrong.   -Casey Neistat  -and-   You'll learn more from recreating a Picasso brush stroke for brush stroke than you'll ever learn from an art class.   -My dad told me this but I'm fairly sure he didn't invent this expression.  EDIT: Didn't see the question at the bottom. Although they do look like stairs (I thought that myself) it's meant to be the liquor shelf. Something to be improved upon when detailing."

PixelArt,3cs442,Godcantfindausername,6,Fri Jul 10 09:22:43 2015 UTC,"While I've only done a few pixel art animations, my process goes like this: Photoshop CS4 Create document at the size of the sprite Rough in the key poses on separate layers Breakdowns and inbetween drawings also on separate layers (Keep my layers in Photoshop ordered correctly) Clean up all drawings, flipping back and forth often to check consistency of proportions and volume Add some visual interest in choice spots to make it more engaging to watch Export using ""Save for Web and Devices"" as a .gif set to loop forever and scaled up to 400% using ""Nearest Neighbor"" interpolation.  Ta-Daa! You're done.  This is for making a gif. If you are making a spritesheet, you're going to export it in a very different way.

PixelArt,3crb5o,JefferyTheWalrus,2,Fri Jul 10 04:09:11 2015 UTC,This was resized incorrectly. The building blocks that create your piece should all be the same size.   An unresized piece should be composed of 1x1 squares (pixels) A 200% piece should be composed of 2x2 squares (pixel clusters) A 300% piece should be composed of 3x3 squares (pixel clusters)     Your resize has areas of 2x3 which doesn't make any sense. Resizing to weird numbers like 234% will give you cluster size inconsistency.

PixelArt,3cktrt,jgkling,2,Wed Jul 8 18:13:59 2015 UTC,The cake and the icing are good. Nice roundness and palette overall.   The candle has an issue. The slightly darker shade of white that you've used in the middle live if pixels indicates shadow and so needs to be on the same side as the shadow being cast (the right). So just make the right-most line of vertical pixels the darker shades one and that might improve things.  Also you may want to make the top of the candle the same angle as the the top of the cake. Make stick with just red for the too of the candle and see.   Keep it up though!
PixelArt,3cktrt,BlueEyedBassist,2,Wed Jul 8 18:57:57 2015 UTC,"I was a little confused when making the candle because it was a cylinder, like the cake. I know that the light is supposed to ""wrap around"", so I made both the right and left sides of the candle bright. This was made awkward by the fact that it's only 3 pixels thick, so I'll try out the darker colors on the right side, that'll probably look best. Thanks for the input! I'll post the updated version in a bit."
PixelArt,3cktrt,secv808,2,Wed Jul 8 20:01:49 2015 UTC,"Here is my updated version, with second candle. Your advice to go with strictly red on top really did make SUCH a huge difference - that one pixel made the candle look much more realistic. My only question is whether or not the shading on the second candle should be exactly the same as the first, or maybe if everything should be a step higher or lower on the palette given its different position on the cake? Thanks again for your help."

PixelArt,3ch8pl,barodapride,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:03:50 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not sure of regular pricing. But I need the practice. Depending upon what you want done, I'd charge a very small amount per piece if you want to Pm me."
PixelArt,3ch8pl,Tzun,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:20:47 2015 UTC,"Pricing I've used in the past is the employer will give me a piece they want, say a 12 tile tile set of size 16x16. I would tell them how long that would take me in hours, say 6 for this example. We would decide on an hourly wage and multiply that by how long I thought it would take to do."
PixelArt,3cfa1e,anmoln,2,Tue Jul 7 13:36:28 2015 UTC,Looks great! Only criticism would be that the tiled brickwork in the background clashes with the hand drawn environment.
PixelArt,3cfa1e,Morrinn3,2,Tue Jul 7 13:56:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it came to me too. But doing all the brick thing without tiles seems quite tiring task to me. Though will try to change it."

PixelArt,3cf72f,crumpled_sandwich,2,Tue Jul 7 14:50:03 2015 UTC,Yeah unless you are willing to pay someone for several hours of work to repaint the image you aren't going to find an easy way to digitize the image the way you are looking for.
PixelArt,3cf72f,StarchyToast,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:45:04 2015 UTC,"I would be willing to Try and re-make this into pixel art. If you could do one thing for me it would be to take a better photo of this picture, I am already pretty far into this project though."

PixelArt,3c4u38,JefferyTheWalrus,18,Sat Jul 4 20:13:03 2015 UTC,"I quite like the overall aesthetic.  Some of the items look a bit flat and out of place - specifically the rocks, logs and the box out front. Also the red container doesn't line up correctly."
PixelArt,3c4u38,Maklite,3,Sat Jul 4 21:39:38 2015 UTC,"Love it!  Very cute, and faithful to the source material.  Might be a good idea to add a little shadow under the fallen ""S,"" though.  Currently, it looks kinda flat."

PixelArt,3c4u38,jz88k,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:48:03 2015 UTC,Be sure to share it when you've done that!  I expect afterwards it'll look perfect!  I really dig your pixel art style.
PixelArt,3c4u38,NonCarer,3,Sat Jul 4 23:05:37 2015 UTC,"I know you didn't put a CC tag on, but I would suggest less bold outlines. You could try either removing them in some places, and/or turning them to darker versions of the colors they border instead of such a dark blackish color. I think that in isometric especially, bold diagonal outlines can be distracting.  Sorry if you feel this criticism is unwarranted/unwanted. I like the piece overall."
PixelArt,3c4u38,NonCarer,5,Sat Jul 4 23:40:46 2015 UTC,"I can see where this advice is coming from, but in this case I wanted to match Gravity Falls' animation style, in which things have dark outlines."
PixelArt,3c4u38,ProbablySentient,5,Sat Jul 4 23:48:45 2015 UTC,"Ah, I hadn't seen Gravity Falls so I didn't really know what you were going for. I looked up some stills from it though, and it looks like you did a good job."
PixelArt,3c4u38,ProbablySentient,3,Sun Jul 5 00:18:51 2015 UTC,"Nothing I make could ever do that show's background art justice, but I try."
PixelArt,3c4u38,stadsport,2,Sun Jul 5 00:44:41 2015 UTC,"This is so good, you've really transferred the aesthetic from the cartoon really well.   If I was pressed to give feedback I'd say you have a definite lighting direction on everything but the cabin walls, which at the moment all appear to be shaded the same regardless of direction, which throws me off a wee bit.  That being said it's still absolutely awesome :)  (Also I just realised this isn't C&C, whoops)."
PixelArt,3c6gb9,craigeatscrayons,2,Sun Jul 5 07:44:15 2015 UTC,"Hey guys.  This is a little animation I made for the iPhone game, 'Dinofour'. It's got such a lovely response from people so I thought I'd share it here.  Animation is not really a strong point of mine, so any feedback regarding that could really help me with future projects, as well as any relevant tutorials you could recommend.   Thanks :)"
PixelArt,3c6gb9,superfahd,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:48:17 2015 UTC,"I gotta say, this is adorable! What's the game about? I don't have an iphone. Any chance of an android release?"
PixelArt,3c6gb9,superfahd,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:03:57 2015 UTC,"The game is about four dinosaurs each with a special power that they need to utilize to overcome challenges. I'm not sure if you ever played The Lost Vikings on Super Nintendo or Sega, but the concept is basically the same. Kind of.  I requests for an Android version probably at least 10 times a day! It's definitely something I'm looking at doing in the future. :)"
PixelArt,3c6gb9,JefferyTheWalrus,2,Sun Jul 5 20:50:56 2015 UTC,I loved the Lost Vikings. Looking forward to the android version of you ever make it

PixelArt,3c9yo2,PixePaysPokemon,2,Mon Jul 6 06:45:40 2015 UTC,"Looks like you scaled and pixeled over a drawing. This isn't necessarily a bad practice, but make sure the drawing follows form and has a sense of space or the whole piece falls apart. This piece, specifically, lacks the depth that makes sprites interesting- mostly because of your choice to only ""shade"" around the edges, as a means of outlining, instead of using the darker shade of each color to give the character some shadows, which would definitely add a three-dimensional look."
PixelArt,3c7bdt,StraitCurrent,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:39:19 2015 UTC,Do you have a blog or anything for the game?   Looks like something I'd like to play! I loved Doom 2 and 3.

You can find it here: http://blog.straitcurrent.com/  Doom 2 was the primary inspiration for the game, or well, brutal doom was. I don't want to simply copy doom though, trying to take it in another direction. A cleaner, crisp pixel style, for example."

PixelArt,3c7202,Zichu,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:56:09 2015 UTC,Thats really awesome. The only thing I would change is the color. It looke more gold than bronze. Bronze tends to have a more brownish color. Just google search bronze and see if u can manipulate your palette to suit that color

PixelArt,3c40go,Lite-Black,4,Sat Jul 4 15:41:50 2015 UTC,"You have colour and shadow right, it's just you're using an anti-aliased brush on photoshop (or whichever program you're using) rather than a pixel / pencil tool. Pixel art emphasizes the pixel to pixel contrast, yet you're using a tool that hides that contrast under blurry edges. Try making another piece but only with the pencil tool or aliased brush."
PixelArt,3c40go,Priestbob,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:49:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip, will look up which brushes have no AA, or how to turn them off etc . I did use the pencil tool, when I started adding detail (which is when I realised it might be useful to ask for advice here, as it seemed maybe pixel-arty). Can see how more control can be had without AA.  also, I think a lot of the AA comes from using the marquee and lasso tools, I'll try using the line tool to outline block shapes instead."
PixelArt,3c40go,Edgekid,2,Sat Jul 4 22:51:48 2015 UTC,Pencil tool instead of brush tool. Right click the brush and click the pencil.
PixelArt,3c3nfl,Baewii,2,Sat Jul 4 13:24:10 2015 UTC,I would be very grateful if you could give me an idea how you did the same scene but at different times of the day! This would be very helpful to me!

PixelArt,3c2oxo,robil11,2,Sun Jul 5 10:03:58 2015 UTC,"This is more of a weapon design criticism than the artwork itself (which is quite good), but the handguard is a bit close to the handle, not leaving much room for a hand, and the hilt is rather straight and not very ergonomic. Here's an example of an ergonomic sword handle. Otherwise, I agree with the others, it's good, but the blade looks like it should be shifted left a tad.  Keep it up!"

Still having a bit of motion sickness/dizziness while playing which I think is from the background passing by so quickly, also fairly frequent crashes after dying or purchasing a revive...

PixelArt,3by2hy,eriophora,19,Fri Jul 3 05:42:12 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that pixel art isn't so much an end result as it is a process.   This isn't really pixel art since you didn't use any pixel art techniques - you just had a program do it. Pixel art is something you build pixel by pixel with complete, precise control over the outcome."
PixelArt,3by2hy,digitalsalmon,-2,Fri Jul 3 06:09:54 2015 UTC,"I agree that pixel art is about being selective and precise - but bare in mind that the medium is still moving forward and shifting - with Photoshop's dither pattern tools it's becoming more straightforward to automate aspects of the art. We're entering a grey area with these techniques (and the art from OP), and whilst it might not fit the purist 'pixel art', its fair to label work like this with its own title; something like 'progressive' or 'modern'. I'm sure an art expert could clarify/find a more fitting term. (:"
PixelArt,3by2hy,eriophora,5,Fri Jul 3 13:08:35 2015 UTC,"I don't really mind tools that still give you fine control. Fill buckets, et cetera. Those are quite useful and can helpfully speed up the process. With such tools, you know exactly what the tool is going to do and there is no imprecision.   Photoshop's dither, I believe, picks colours for you automagically, so I'm not a huge fan of it. I haven't used it, though, so I could be wrong. I also tend to be of the school of thought that dither ought to be used sparingly in pieces - with the exception of severely limited palettes, I can't imagine a need for a dither tool in anything I've made.   Personally I'd say this work is ""pixelated"" or even ""pixel art-inspired,"" but not pixel art."

PixelArt,3by2hy,secv808,3,Fri Jul 3 17:30:10 2015 UTC,"Color reduction is normally looked down upon in the pixel art community since it cheapens the art form, considered as lazy, and the end results hardly look good.  There are successful pixel art that do use color reduction, but it's used as a starting point before going in and spending the time to clean up the messy areas and refine details.  There's still a lot of clean-up work that needs to be done in your piece if you wish to take it further and have a learning experience of the art form. The process that I would suggest you take if you want to spend more time on it would be take the original work, grayscale it, reduce size and color, refine the values/shading, then bring in colors and do any further details that should be done.  Nice work otherwise."
PixelArt,3by2hy,skittlefuck,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:56:48 2015 UTC,Yeah just reducing/refining the color palette and doing some light cleanup would qualify this as pixel art. Pixelated or downressed is the category it's in at the moment.

Naturally, pixel art won't scale that well, but on a 21-inch 1080p monitor, it was hard to make out at the current resolution of the image. (That's what I'm basing my criticism off of after all.)  After I scaled it down some more, it looked great! So, if it's going to be smaller, I think you have nothing to worry about."

I can see that solid blocks of color is what you're going for, and it seems to work with everything but the wall. I guess being too big of an empty space makes the wall look.. well.. empty. In a way that breaks the illusion for me, like it's out of place despite being the right dimensions.  The second is that (and it could be my imagination) but the sprites look like they're off on their angles for an isometric projection. I get that from the feet. I could be wrong guy though.   The third is nitpicky as hell but the crate near the bottom counter looks out of place, falling in the middle of the 4 tiles. Like it should be flush with the display counter. As it is, it's in the middle of the floor and breaks the isometric illusion for me. The other crate near the checkout counter doesn't break it for me because I can't try to line it up with any other objects."

PixelArt,3bx5de,YagoTheFrood,2,Thu Jul 2 21:51:23 2015 UTC,I think you should try staring with a looser sketch to start with. It will help you get all the basic parts down and then you can refine that to pixel outlines etc in another layer. Hopefully that will help you work faster. That means a) you'll be able to finish more quickly or b) you can spend more time on specific techniques/experiment more in the same work hours.

If you really want to ensure it's clear even to those few that wouldn't already get it, you could have items flash once or twice when they first appear there. That kind of visual communication is a lot more elegant than the word ""inventory"" next to the inventory."
PixelArt,3bvb9t,adventurerh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:33:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot! Yes a lot of the stuff you see is placeholder, especially the toolbar. The idea about having the items flash is great though, I will probably do that so thank you! I will post a new video soon.

I thought I'd update everyone to say that my 2player-1keyboard arcade game, Steg and Rex is now out! I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed developing it!

PixelArt,3bsbqn,LeadLined,7,Wed Jul 1 19:19:15 2015 UTC,just look like different aesthetics to me. Like the first one just as much as the second as I can see them both being used in completely different games.
PixelArt,3bsbqn,3scap3plan,2,Thu Jul 2 10:04:24 2015 UTC,"I see what folks are saying regarding it arguably being an improvement. There is definitely more detail in the newer tiles, though I think them not seeing it is a testament to how solid your previous tiles were, despite not being as detailed. It had a minimalist feel to them and looked damn good."
PixelArt,3bsbqn,thorgi_of_arfsgard,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:47:06 2015 UTC,"Its hard to say this an improvement, both are very nice scenes which stand up well on their own. Hard to say one is an improvement on the other unless youve mixed up the images and meant the one with shadows to be the improvement."
PixelArt,3bsbqn,geoface,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:42:47 2015 UTC,"I mean the tiles on the floor. If you look at the actual tiles on the floor there is a huge improvement in details. The shadows are just from Unity.  EDIT: This might be a better comparison, This is the tiles you see in the original image. http://imgur.com/aS3CIH5"
PixelArt,3bsbqn,Clasm,2,Wed Jul 1 22:21:23 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you are going for. In the old image, the floor looks like it's made of massive carved stones, perfect for the inside of a temple. The new images look more like (comparatively) thin tiles that might have been used for an ancient outdoor patio."
PixelArt,3bsbqn,Simon_of_Belmonts,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:26:32 2015 UTC,How did you make shadows on 2D drawings with Unity?
PixelArt,3bsbqn,Simon_of_Belmonts,2,Thu Jul 2 09:11:21 2015 UTC,"It's Psuedo 2D. Basically everything is a quad with the sprite as a texture. The world is built in 3D. But the camera is still orthographic, at a 60 degree angle.  It's a time consuming process, has a significant performance hit (unless you are light baking), you need to Stretch quads based on the camera angle or they will appear squashed, and issues with Unity's lighting system mean it's not great for everything. For instance Point light shadow bias settings don't work in Unity and has been an issue for over 2 years. So If you want to add a sprite character they will look like they are floating(peter panning).   Here is how the set up would look in engine. The files for the original are on a storage drive so I mad ea quick mock up. http://i.imgur.com/9Rxa9ac.png"

That's why I took 70 screenshots from them. Seeing all images together you can notice the color pattern repeating, also some facial features, so this way the illusion of variety is lost a little. It is from the Demo."

As far as improving it, the only thing that really catches my eye is the inconsistent sizing of shadows on some of your buildings. The building on the bottom left, for example, has virtually no shadow, where a rock that's about the same size (in the middle-ish) has a very large shadow on the ground. Nitpicky, I know, but just wanted to give some feedback because this looks great."

PixelArt,3bltk8,BNMotive,3,Tue Jun 30 06:58:03 2015 UTC,"Nicely drawn, but the lighting and values make it visually noisy/confusing. Overall, it's too light so areas tend toward being on the same plane of depth. I had a hard time figuring out that she had a mechanical arm and where the front arm was to start.  Inner outlines of dark colors also make the image noisier. Especially on the mech arm, dark inner lines tend to flatten the object without strong shading and with so many lines on the arm it flattens to a pattern rather than an arm projecting into space.  Also, I'm not sure if you did it on purpose but the image is a jpeg which is a bad thing for pixel art since compression ruins the color palette. PNG is best.  I added some darkened areas to the sprite in this image (https://i.imgur.com/W1t8xFd.png) to help with reading the form of the character. It's low quality, but the main idea is to create more contrast between the front arm and the rest of the character and to increase the range of values."
