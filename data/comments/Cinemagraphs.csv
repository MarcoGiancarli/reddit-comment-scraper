Our brains have a funny way of glossing over these transitions if the visual is intricate enough.   Composition will also be a huge determining factor for file size, as the amount of area that gets masked in the loop directly correlates to file size. There's also the option of increasing the speed of the footage slightly to cut down on frames, but that might not be an option in this case.   Here's one I just made that only uses 12 frames (I think) : http://ryanjbush.tumblr.com/post/123440118575  Hope that helps some!"

Cinemagraphs,3cw6er,SteveCFE,15,Sat Jul 11 13:26:31 2015 UTC,He meant noisy as in when you look at it you can hear the noise it makes in your head. Not noisy as in compression artefacts :P

Cinemagraphs,3cszi5,bankyVee,5,Fri Jul 10 15:05:47 2015 UTC,awesome. I remember wasting hours away in the arcade playing spy hunter. The cinemagraphs in Shenmue are like high art compared to GTA or most other open environment games.
Cinemagraphs,3cszi5,SpaceGhost211,2,Fri Jul 10 19:01:31 2015 UTC,I loved that damn punching game. Can't wait for the third installment.
Cinemagraphs,3cszi5,carpwrist,3,Fri Jul 10 21:06:02 2015 UTC,I will never not upvote Shenmue content.
Cinemagraphs,3cszi5,starshadowx2,-4,Fri Jul 10 23:53:14 2015 UTC,"How is this a cinemagraph in any way? It's just a looping gif, and not even a good one.   A cinemagraph is a high quality gif or video that is very smoothly looped. It's more than a well looped gif, though; it should be beautiful as a great photograph, evocative like a movie, and more alive than either.   smoothly looped, and good resolution"
Cinemagraphs,3cszi5,theumpteendeity,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:11:42 2015 UTC,"It's debatable if they're cinemagraphs or not, I guess in a strict technical sense, they're not. I made this animations myself, they do not exist in the actual game. I did not freeze the background or alpha channel or rotoscope anything to achieve the animation. What I did was create a static image of a game with zero animation, and zero frames, cut out bits and pieces of the images and manipulate them piece by piece, via perceptive, sheer, rotation, lighting, frame by frame, layer by layer, individually. . All these animations are original, and if you were to play the actual game, you see that they do not exist so, it's technically not a cinemagraph because I did not make these from any sort of video, but only from one single static image with extreme and highly time consuming manipulation, in some cases taking actual days to complete. And I did it without Photoshop, I used Gimp to create everything."
Cinemagraphs,3ct3gh,orbojunglist,4,Fri Jul 10 15:35:30 2015 UTC,"Really good, how do you keep the snowflakes moving without having the people move?"
Cinemagraphs,3ct3gh,Smirk27,10,Fri Jul 10 16:02:16 2015 UTC,"They were already quite still in the scene, only very small areas of movement needed fixing (slight ghosting heads/hands etc)   The Hamlet one I made a few days ago needed more, when things you want to mask move underneath things you want to keep...you just have to brace yourself for a long time animating individual snowflakes etc to stop your masking standing out too much as everything passes behind it."

Cinemagraphs,3ct3gh,CodeMcK,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:04:54 2015 UTC,"So if spartan boys are sent out to kill a wolf to show their manliness or whatever, why was he made the leader of them if that's just the ritual?"

Cinemagraphs,3ct3gh,handsome_mcstabby,7,Sat Jul 11 04:20:17 2015 UTC,Athenian democracy was developed around the time of the famed Battle of Thermopylae but Athens and Sparta are two different places and Sparta maintained a tradition of hereditary kingship for some time afterwards.
Cinemagraphs,3ct3gh,Niccalo,2,Sat Jul 11 06:07:40 2015 UTC,"Basically what CodeMcK said, the final act of becoming King and proving you ain't no bitch is to go into the wild with nothing and come back with the wolf carcass"
