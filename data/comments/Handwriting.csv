Handwriting,3e52j6,logic92,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:43:56 2015 UTC,"When you're writing with your wrist, your forearm isn't usually moving much. When you write with your arm, it does. If you imagine wearing a watch, it would have to move as you are writing. If you write entirely with your arm, the watch would move with every stroke of the pen, with your wrist not moving independently of the arm."
Handwriting,3e52j6,Colonel_Limits,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:19:03 2015 UTC,I'm genuinely curious to know who here actually writes just with their arm? It seems like a technique for calligraphy more than handwriting to me. Are there really people here arm-writing notes and journals and forms at the doctor's office?
Handwriting,3e65dx,icyflamez96,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:40:13 2015 UTC,"It might be ""hard"" but I'd say, why practice doing something other than what you actually want to be doing? Just practice writing words, at the size you want, with your arm, if that's what you want to be doing. You might be really bad at it at first, but slow down, be patient, and practice - you will get better quickly..."

You seem to have the problem that I did... some of my letters looked great and others were awkward looking and stuck out like sore thumbs. Your 'M's and 'F's stick out to me as your strongest letters, and there are a bunch of other ones. Bring down the tail more with your 'q's, lose that thing on the 'b's, etc. Just find a style you want to emulate and fine tune your own according to that style.   Also, this is a big thing- be consistent with the angles of your letters. Whether you want to straighten them out or do them at an angle, or whatever, just make sure it's all the same. Don't rush yourself! Practice (and patience) makes perfect! :)"
Handwriting,3e19sh,cursivecommentary,2,Tue Jul 21 04:37:29 2015 UTC,"I think your cursive is attractive and will become very beautiful if you intently practice improving it. I would suggest a slightly less aggressive slope. And your letters tend to be collapsed, you need to either write them larger or focus on making more space inside the cursive lowercase ""r"", ""e"" loop, ""a"" loop, ""d"" loop, and so on. You should see a healthy amount of paper within those letters. Good luck and post a progress photo after a while :)"

Handwriting,3dxo3n,biez,2,Mon Jul 20 13:54:16 2015 UTC,"As for pens, I understand perfectly your problem and it is solvable (yay!). My writing changed a lot in the past two years and I struggled a lot with my fountain pen. Everything changed when I bought a new nib. I had a (damaged) gold/supple/medium nib and I changed it for a steel/hard/fine nib and it is a lot easier to use in my present situation and with my scribble that is smaller than previously.   I can't specifically recommend a brand or another. I've been writing with a Parker Sonnet for a very long time, but for any quality pen from a big brand (Schaeffer, Waterman, and so on) you should be able to choose and change your nib at will (I still have my old gold nib and can change back whenever I want).   Paper is really a struggle. I feel that notebooks' paper has been going down in quality and I really hate that. I often have bad surprises. The solution for me is writing on printer paper when I take notes in a lesson (and sticking to the same paper brand since I don't want to have to go through 500 sheets I don't like). When I need a notebook (taking notes when visiting museums for example) things are hard. I tried Paperblanks but they drink up the ink and blot. Moleskine don't drink but their pages are see-through. A library near my home used to sell noname carnets that were really good but stopped, I regret not having bought a bunch."

Here are a few improvements, for print:  t: horizontal line 2/3 up, not 40% up; e should not go that high; why is that c so closed?; w is too rounded; the o is too large in general; now the more I look at it, the size of some side-by-side letters is often disproportionate, very good example is the word ""looks"".  For cursive, reads much better, most of your transitions are good, some are not standard (check this out (link)). Just slow down your speed for a little while and it is going to improve with practice."

On the other hand I was here to say there is quite a bit of unfinished business with your handwriting!  Unclosed letters (example letter a), straight strokes where it is supposed to be curves and the opposite, overlapping strokes, curved angles where they are supposed to be sharp and the opposite, and same letter strikingly dissimilar throughout the text.  I came here to suggest you go back to basics, work on your form, write the alphabet a few hundred times, practice pairs of letters (transitions between letters), then start writing. But hey, if you like your style, make it your own, my friend."

This is literally the reason I posted here, I needed to know be made aware of things that I don't see--thank you for pointing those things out (especially the closing of letters and straight/curve/sharp strokes).  I will definitely work more on my penmanship.    I think one of my personal problems is that instead of practicing the alphabet, I like to practice words (and make tweaks).  For example I would write the word Thank You a 100 times, and make changes until I find one that I like--then I would use that version in the card I was writing.  I think that was expressed here again with words like Metropolitan, space, at, and headphones (since I wrote them more than once).  The way I would write them ""officially in a letter"" is still evolving until I find the one that I want to use--maybe that's a bad habit I should break.  But now for the real question, do you find my writing to be pretty?"

Going with a more standard form could help. Then, some rounded letter sometimes need a little bit more love (more defined balls, ex.: a, e, o, probably caused by speed).  This is a mix of script and cursive writing, do you realize it? It looks like either a) lazy script, or b) ignorant cursive.

Handwriting,3dms0p,pippsqueak,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:58:20 2015 UTC,"More than anything, what works for me when I want to change my handwriting, is this three step process: Form, Function, Flow.   FORM. Focus on one letter at a time. Choose a form of the letter you want (looking at other people's handwriting is like a shopping trip: ""Ooh! Nice lowercase G! I gotta get that!""), then work on it... over and over again. Until it's habit. FUNCTION. Once I've gotten the individual letterforms the way I life them, I exclusively write with the cursive upright rather than slanted, for a couple of weeks at least. That way I get the letterforms to work together (so to speak), with no worry about the individual forms nor whether it's yet perfect. FLOW. Once my new handwriting is a nice little habit, I slant the handwriting to how I prefer it. Within weeks of starting the process, I've got what I want.

Handwriting,3djkph,Pepperfection,2,Fri Jul 17 07:58:03 2015 UTC,To add to what others have said. Go for a rounded a not the kind that gets typed. Practice some cursive and you'll likely begin getting a little more flow to your handwriting. The letters will connect sometimes and they'll look less precise.
Handwriting,3dlmiw,asusan,2,Fri Jul 17 07:09:23 2015 UTC,"The most common grip is a triangle grip: the index finger, middle finger, and thumb each touch the pen in a triangle around the barrel, with the index finger on top. In this grip, the very tip of middle finger is not actually touching the pen but is underneath it, so the middle finger actually contacts the pen between the tip and the first knuckle, supporting the pen's weight. The thumb is also only very lightly pressing, really just to prevent the pen from falling out of the grip. The index finger is resting on the top of the pen - you should be able to lift and ""tap"" the pen with the index finger as if it were a salt shaker that needed to be tapped to get the grains to fall out. Tapping the index finger before each word or sentence is a great way to ensure you don't end up with a death grip.  It might be helpful not to think of this even as a grip - the word grip implies tension. This is more of a ""cradle"" for the pen!  Once you understand this comfortable, loose way to hold the pen, you can begin to practice with it, going very slowly and deliberately. It will feel weird. You need to constantly be sending your fingers the signal to be relaxed and light. Write with your wrist, not your fingers. Since you are used to a ""death grip,"" this really requires continuous conscious effort to relax as you write. Do not focus on writing beautifully as you do this. Your letters will be ugly and your lines will be squiggly. Its ok. Practice this intently for 10 minutes twice a day, and your nerves and muscles will learn quickly.  It may be good to use a pencil, gel pen, or fountain pen for this training period, since those require almost no pressure in order to write. Ballpoints are not so good for this practice."

The arm of course does provide the left to right motion as you move across the page, but that's just about getting the wrist into the optimum position.  Make your downstrokes as downward contractions of the wrist, keep your fingers and hand relaxed, and you'll be in pretty good shape."

Your lower case r's - especially when they are in the middle of a word, look like v's, or strokes of other letters. Work on making your r's (inside a word - the ones at the beginning of words look okay) more distinct and r looking. That would improve readability a lot.  All your letters are kind of the same height.  Try making the tall parts of letters like b, d, f, h, l, t taller so there is more contrast.  It also looks like your writing goes below the baseline in places where it shouldn't. Like the letter e - all of that should be above the baseline. Only letters like g, y, etc should touch below that."

Handwriting,3dc5sv,Nebuleon,2,Wed Jul 15 15:51:06 2015 UTC,"Allow me to answer this question with something that goes against its letter, but goes with its spirit.  While writing the important material onto paper does make you remember it better, you don't have to write every single thing on the one sheet you bring to the exam. You could alter your method, first writing everything onto multiple sheets of paper at your normal writing size, then picking the things that you remember the least, annotate them (underline, highlight, corner quote, whatever), and figuring out with the amount of annotated text if you actually need to write small to cram it onto one sheet.  You can also use your own flavor of shorthand to transcribe long words if you remember what they are but need reminders of things that are related to them.  Then, odds are that you won't need that tiny writing to begin with."
Handwriting,3dc5sv,Nebuleon,3,Wed Jul 15 04:04:38 2015 UTC,"That's the method I'm working with now. I condensed about 50 pages worth of material from the last 4 weeks down to about 15 (lots of repeated information and white space) and then down to 4 main pages. I can easily condense that down to one page of small handwriting. Most of what I'm writing is laws and formula derivations. It's much easier to fill up a page with formulas, variables, and graphs than trying to explain a concept. Only problem is deriving equations takes many lines :("
Handwriting,3dc5sv,Nebuleon,4,Wed Jul 15 04:11:23 2015 UTC,"Ah, so you know the ways of information concentration after all.  I already know that using a regular pencil would give you way too thick lines, or require lots of sharpening. But instead of going to pens, I'll stay with pencils and  recommend a mechanical pencil, so that you can quickly erase mistakes you made while preparing the sheet.  As for the thickness of the lead, I think 0.5 mm is just fine, and it's a very common size to boot, but you might want to go with 0.3 mm (for example, JetPens: Pilot AirBlanc mechanical pencil). However, I don't know how often the leads break at that small size -- or, to protect the lead against exactly this, the hardness is brought up while the boldness suffers."

Handwriting,3d7f8j,Flameslicer,4,Tue Jul 14 02:40:35 2015 UTC,"I say this a lot to people, it often doesn't really sink in: when you practice handwriting: slow ridiculously down and don't be thinking about the meaning of your words, think about shapes. How tall is the t, how round is the hump in the h or n, how high is each lowercase letter, what angle are your vertical lines. Seriously. Make each letter correctly, and go as slowly as you need in order to accomplish that. Move onto the next letter. Take five minutes to write a sentence. That slow. I'm not kidding. Speed up when you can do it faster without damaging your letter forms. I say this because your example says ""slow script"" and surely, it is not slow enough :)"
Handwriting,3d7f8j,deltadeep,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:04:34 2015 UTC,At the same time I think its worth mentioning that if you go too slow you lose a lot of the natural flowiness which makes it look really forced.

You just can't jump straight to mastery and will constantly hold yourself back if you expect elegance during the learning process. You have to accept that in the beginning and even after a fair bit of practice, it's gonna look forced and take a long time to produce. Edit/addition: what you're doing when you learn better handwriting is retraining the neuromuscular pathways in the hand and arm to new patterns, this is literally like a baby taking its first steps - it takes time for those neurons to develop and the muscles to adapt and they don't do it if you go too fast and thus just trigger your old pathways."

Practice writing while you consciously and continuously send a relaxation signal to your finger joints - this will force you to use your wrist and arm and develop those muscles.

Handwriting,3cusqm,ControlYourPoison,7,Sat Jul 11 03:57:09 2015 UTC,"It's Spencerian Script.  It was developed in 1840 and started to become common around 1850, until it became standard for business.  That started to change in the 1920s when typewriters became common and around 1925, most schools switched over to the simpler Palmer Method.  I started kindergarten in 1977 and had lots and lots of instruction in Palmer.  Like everyone else.  I adapted Palmer a bit for note taking and faster writing and have been at it for a long time now.  Currently, some schools teach a kind of hybrid italic script called Getty-Dubay that's halfway between printing and writing.  I don't like it at all.  Maybe because I'm old and set in my ways, but there's nothing elegant or beautiful about it.  It looks terrible.  I think Spencerian is gorgeous and I've been tempted to learn, but it won't touch my Palmer for note taking."

Handwriting,3cusqm,red_sky33,4,Sat Jul 11 06:05:19 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but looking at this picture, I can tell that your reason is probably the most correct. You can see the heavier ink deposits on capital letters when the writer had to dip the pen nib, leading to certain letters being very chunky and inky and interspersed between many thinner ones as the ink was used up.   The writing style may not have changed immediately after the switch to fountain pens, but the change in ink delivery method really changed the outcome."
Handwriting,3cusqm,Deksloc,3,Sat Jul 11 06:18:40 2015 UTC,"It's not because of ink deposits after dipping the pen, it's deliberate. It's a well-known pointed pen script called 'Spencerian.' They're lots of resources available to learn how to do it at r/calligraphy."

Handwriting,3cusqm,Deksloc,2,Sat Jul 11 07:00:50 2015 UTC,"No, it doesn't have to do with how much ink is in the pen.  It depends on the pen's nib, which is common to both dip pens and fountain pens.  Most modern pens have a fine or extra fine point, which leads to a consistent line when you write.  Older pens and some fountain pens have wider nibs - usually called oblique - where you can vary the weight of the line as you write.  It works the same way whether it's a fountain pen or a dip pen.  I've been using fountain pens since 1994 and have a few oblique nibs in my collection.  They're fun to use, even when writing in Palmer."

Handwriting,3cwbgo,Haweraboy,3,Sat Jul 11 09:06:16 2015 UTC,"Despite your writing being in print for this image, the flow of line 8 suggests that you might benefit more from writing in cursive. For that, you could look at The Palmer Method or Loops and Tails, both also found in the sidebar.  But, whether you continue in print or in cursive, the ""quick enough"" print writing in your sample exhibits some problems that need various corrections before you can write legibly at that speed, whether in print or in cursive. Looking solely at line 8, you have issues with:   baseline alignment; ambiguity with links ('w[ri]ting', word 1, can read like 'wnting'); making proper loops ('g' in 'writing', word 2, can read like 'writins'; 'be[co]mes', word 3, can read like 'bewms'); making proper stems for letters ('m' in 'becomes', word 3, which appears to be just a squiggled line); and skipping letters altogether ('becom[e]s', word 3; 'th[i]s' or 'thi[s]', word 5).   Do you want to continue in cursive or in print? I would tell you to practice certain important shapes, but some shapes are more important in cursive (e.g. getting 's' and 'r' right) versus in print (e.g. 'o' and 'm' being important base shapes)."

I want to have clean, non messy print handwriting that feels more efficient than the one I have now for notes so I can actually read them later. But I want a clean cursive as well for when I need to write quickly.  What would you say the best thing to do to improve both of these is?( I e choosing a font I like and base it around that, starting from scratch etc)"
Handwriting,3cwbgo,Nebuleon,2,Sat Jul 11 19:30:51 2015 UTC,"To help you with both print (main) and cursive (secondary), I'd say start with print. Having a good print will give you a good start in cursive, once you become aware of the entry and exit points of letters. Those are very important.  You can start simple:  Make half a line of slow 'o's, and then half a line of slow 'm's. Below that, write a full line of fast 'o's, and then a full line of fast 'm's. But while making those, pay extreme attention to the strokes. Start your 'o' at the top-left, make a circle counter-clockwise ending at the top-left, and move your wrist (or arm) one length of 'o' to the right. Start your 'm' at the top-left, then make a line down, a zig-zag to the same height as the 'o' then back down, and another zig-zag, and move to the right just a bit to make enough space between letters.  Then examine your lines of fast letters. Are they misaligned? Are most of the 'o's unclosed? Are the 'm's still squiggles? If either of those is still true, make another half-line of slow ones to use as a template, then another line of fast ones.  Then, you can move on to all the other letters that are based on them. 'a' is just an 'o', starting at the top-right corner, with a downward tail at the end. 'd' is 'a', but going up before going back down. 'q' is 'a' with a longer tail. 'g' is 'a' with a tail, curved to the left.  'n' is 'm' with one less zig-zag. 'r' is 'n' with a zig and no zag. Once you make more letters, one full line of fast ones at a time, you can start making lines of words instead, to practice moving your wrist (or arm) to the right precisely as much as needed to enter the next letter. ""anonymous"" is a good one, having 3 'o'-shape letters and 3 'm'-shape letters.  You can do the rest easily after practicing the basic motions.  Cursive will join those exit and entry points together, except for letters like 'r' and 's', which have their own shape in cursive for better connections.  Happy writing!"

It's more practical to just handwrite everything and make one image link than try to describe things in text and refer to shapes in an image constantly.  But yeah. A ""number context"" (like that 555-1212, where you expect everything to be a digit) is different from an ""all-caps context"", where an upper case 'i' written as | cannot really be confused for a lower case 'L', and all of that is different from a context in which you mix all sorts of characters together. I tend to add serifs to my ""I"" all the time, and in non-number contexts add those strokes to ""1"". In a mixed context you could also add a middle dot inside your 0 (zero), if you also write Ø in Norwegian, if I recall correctly.  And as for your original worry, about the Helvetica-style 9 and g, I doubt that would be an issue if your baseline alignment is at least decent. My 9 (refer to the sheet) could also be confused with 'q', but so far that has never happened. In the end, take whatever is easier for you to write, and if your baseline alignment is a bit off, working on that would also make everything else more legible too."

Handwriting,3cq3h7,Nebuleon,2,Thu Jul 9 22:59:08 2015 UTC,"In type design, the italics are differentiated from the romans using slant, construction, detailing and sometimes width (beyond the pure optical adjustments). Slant is more important than width and construction, but there are also upright italics. A “true” italic usually takes cues from handwriting, and the traditional form is one where each letter is written without lifting the pen. Typically the arch of the italic letter “n” start at the baseline, whereas the roman model start much higher and is a separate stroke from the first stem. Now, handwriting is technically italic/cursive already, so to make an italic companion to an already italic style you need to differentiate them somehow. The most obvious method is to draw the “roman” fairly upright, and the “italic” fairly slanted. This can be exaggerated by also making the “italic” narrower. If the difference is not clear enough, you can introduce different shapes for the italic letters: single-story a/y/g, descending f, cursive s etc. Clearly different variants exist for most letters, and in cases where they might look the same in both styles (like “c”), you can try to introduce a seriffed terminal in the “roman” style.  Another method: Typewriters only had one style available, so they marked emphasis with underlines or overstrikes to simulate bold letters."

Handwriting,3ck1ae,aLurkingRedditor,10,Wed Jul 8 15:42:24 2015 UTC,"Go write ahead. Here are a few tricks that could help.  The K and F should be by far the largest letters. I attempted to have ""de la"" at one half the height of the other minuscule letters, in particular the e and a. The d and l can extend a little more. I personally like my d's having no loops, but you might want to try them looped to see if you prefer it. The capital F is done in three strokes, first, the loop as the base, then, the top cross stroke finishing sharply downwards, and finally the short cross stroke also finishing sharply downwards. Lastly, try and keep everything on an angle that is about 45 degrees to the lines."

Handwriting,3ci59z,rexbovum,2,Wed Jul 8 19:12:30 2015 UTC,"Since you say you're taking cues from Spencerian, I'll go ahead and give pointers from that angle. Firstly, go whole hog. Treat your handwriting practice like calligraphy practice.   Consistency in letter height (for example, the height of your lowercase letters, the ""x-height"" is all over the place). When practicing, I'd advise you make your lowercase letters span the entire height of the rulings, so you develop good habits of keeping everything consistent in height. You can start miniaturizing from there. Consistency in slant/angle. Again, your slant is all over the space. Print Spencerian guidelines and lay them underneath your looseleaf paper or something.  Consistency in letter formation. How are you practicing? Focus on one letter at a time. All your a's need to look identical. Don't settle. Repeat for all 26 miniscules and 26 majuscules. Do them again. Spencerian manuals also break letters into ""groups"" by similarity. Mebbe follow that so you can see better progress in chunks at a time.   Write big and write slow. Others will disagree vehemently, but I think at the size you're writing at, focusing on arm vs. finger-writing is only distracting you from the meat and bones of it all.  Keep up the good work! Never stop improving!"
Handwriting,3ci59z,Precocious_Kid,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:05:22 2015 UTC,"You're right about needing to stay on the baselines. It makes an otherwise good handwriting look sloppy. The slant is also a little inconsistent, but not overly so.  My only critiques would be the lack of slant on your capitals (i.e., they seem to stand straight up) and your capital ""I""s look a little too much like ""F""s.   Time to start working on developing your numbers and punctuation characters."

Handwriting,3cgjcm,moethedog88,6,Tue Jul 7 19:05:22 2015 UTC,"I stumbled upon /r/calligraphy a number of months ago and immediately fell in love with the art. I read their wiki, bought some dip pens and ink, and began practicing various broad nib scripts. Shortly after I discovered /r/fountainpens and decided to spring for a really nice fountain pen and practice my handwriting along side of calligraphy (make the distinction that calligraphy and handwriting are not the same thing).   With regards to the development of my day-to-day handwriting, I saw an immediate jump in quality as soon as I wrote with a fountain pen. By pulling from resources online and LOTS of practicing, I shortly accomplished a cursive hand that I am very happy with so far and even have received a few passing compliments on.  I recommend you explore those subreddits and the resources they link to get your own feel for what exactly you want to do. Do you want to write broad nib calligraphy? Or something a little more elegant?"
Handwriting,3cgjcm,Sr_Rainbow,6,Tue Jul 7 19:22:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I'd love to develop both my day to day handwriting, as well as calligraphy skills -- pointed pen appeals to me more, but both styles are beautiful. I'll certainly continue to poke around here a bit more and maybe make an investment in a fountain pen. I used to have one, and I remember loving it.   Congrats on your progress!"
Handwriting,3cgjcm,BluePanda88,3,Tue Jul 7 23:49:45 2015 UTC,"Research is key. For me, I developed a better cursive from my practice of pointed pen calligraphy. Specifically Spencerian. Though I suck at it, Spencerian calligraphy led me to find the Palmer Method of handwriting, also known as business handwriting or business script. This has now become my everyday writing  http://imgur.com/kXsVN1T  I would recommend finding resources like the ""Calligraphy Bible"" for more references to different scripts and like up videos on how people write a cursive that you like.   Also, practice is essential. I try to practice everyday on my penmanship. You won't be writing like a pro in just a matter of days, it takes weeks and sometimes even months to perfect a script, whether that be broad calligraphy or pointed calligraphy. Same goes for handwriting.   And remember, perfect practice makes perfect. Good luck, and most importantly, have fun!"

In that thread of mine (which I made after months of practice reading, getting the consonants and vowels down, and writing), your writing is between styles 1 and 2, but as you get faster in writing for your constructed language, both in letter selection (picking the correct letters for the word you're about to write) and in writing the shapes, you will want shapes of consistent dimensions that you can write quickly, so you will prefer unstretched shapes."

It's most noticeable in words like 'Reddit' on the first line - note the differing angles of the vertical strokes in the R and the d. The best way to correct this is just regular repeated drills - you may also find it useful to use slanted guidelines for reference. Overall, though, a very lovely hand, with a nice touch of character to it!"
Handwriting,3bw6mf,Omfinite,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:04:34 2015 UTC,"I've been practicing Palmer Script for about 2 months now, so I still have some way to go on improving it. I see the consistency issue and definitely agree, thanks for the suggestion and the criticism! I appreciate it!"

Handwriting,3bxnf9,Naign,2,Fri Jul 3 00:22:59 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I really like the way you write ""Q."" Secondly, I don't see a lot of sample posts showing how speed affects your writing, so I really liked seeing that. I laughed at ""breaking point"" because I imagined someone writing insanely with veins popping out of their head!! Hilarious.  Anyway... As for your question, your handwriting is definitely very neat and legible (so long as you haven't hit your breaking point, haha!). For left-handed writer I think that I would have never have guessed that you are left-handed at all if I just read the first sentence in passing. Iguess that I am used to seeing much more angled writing if the writer hasn't really made strides to improve their writing.   But I think that you are really on the right track here. If your mission is to make your handwriting a little bit more legible then I think that you only have to see which parts of your writing that you really want to improve on. I would suggest writing out a sample paragraph of something and really analyzing how your writing each letter as you go. Because you said you're left handed I think that you should  definitely paying a lot more attention to how you're gripping the pen and how you're forming each letter.  And if your goal is to be able to read your handwriting even if you've written it fast then maybe you can even think about having an alternative style to write with if you have to take notes quickly. What happens to my handwriting is that I develop a lot more letter connections in order to write more efficiently but still maintain legibility. Perhaps you can even just alter your current slow style and develop a fast style to write with.  I think that this could be a good idea because your slow writing is already very legible.  Good luck practicing and don't hesitate to ask me or others if you need suggestions or help!"
Handwriting,3bxnf9,collegeshenanigans,2,Fri Jul 3 06:57:54 2015 UTC,"Hi, First thanks for the advices. At the breaking point speed I think the problem is that I hold the pen too hard maybe and I can't keep up with the movements of my arm, and yes I was just writing like crazy lol. I will try to improve in connections while trying to keep legibility, which is hard for me at some speeds. Thanks."
Handwriting,3bxnf9,Nebuleon,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:09:10 2015 UTC,"More info: I'm left handed, I have yet to correct my posture (I cross my arm over the paper and turn the notebook to the right, Which I know is wrong and I'm trying to fix it).  I'm not trying to write in any fancy style, I try to write in a clear way to be able to read it fast later..  I have doubts If it's even possible for other people to understand my ""fast"" handwrite and If my ""slow"" handwrite could be consider good...  Sorry if I have any grammar mistake."
Handwriting,3bw8n2,amarylles,3,Thu Jul 2 17:44:08 2015 UTC,"I also agree with slowing down.  I might be assuming things, but looking at your handwriting, it seems as if you write very quickly. I mean, look at poor letter ""Z,"" hanging on for dear life because you didn't put him on the line! :( Look at your two samples of writing. While there are definitely similarities, it looks very rushed. You start connecting letters but then in the next sentence you disconnect them. It's as if you said ""Right, I have to make this neat, so let me slow down a bit writing this next sentence.""  I write quite quickly with some variation between letters  depending on the situation as well. But if you want to improve, I would slow down and be conscious of what you're doing. Watch your hand as you form words. See how you're gripping the pen and make notes on what you think you can improve on.  The things you might want to ask yourself are:   How do I want my writing to appear? Fun? Flirty? Meaning business? Down-to-earth? Traditional? I like to think of different types of writing having their own personality, with the letters being clothes in a wardrobe that really bring out their unique style! Search this subreddit along with the ones listed in the sidebar, or go on dafont.com or elsewhere for inspiration. Practice and develop a style that you think will work for you.  Am I willing to dedicate my time to making it better? How much time will you set aside to practice on your handwriting? If you want to really make it better, it involves some work (as I'm sure you know). Some people pick up writing different styles easily, while others struggle to keep their letters consistent.   These are some things that I think you should think about. People constantly ask ""How can I make my sloppy handwriting better?"" and go in circles because they quit after they can't keep their writing consistent, but the answer lies in yourself wanting to practice, practice, practice with dedication! You can start out emulating a style and practicing it, or you could even go back to elementary school alphabet drills and work on consistency. It's up to you!  I believe that one should feel comfortable with their handwriting, because it's a part of them! It's another way to express yourself.  Hope you post back when you've improved and developed a style you think suits you~ Do not hesitate to ask me or others for more help!  Good luck! ★"

Handwriting,3bvswu,hermajestysanicegirl,3,Thu Jul 2 15:42:47 2015 UTC,"I think that you should make a list of things you like and dislike about your handwriting, because your letter style is fairly consistent, which brings me to believe that you are writing comfortably in this style.  Example things you should ask yourself/do when you're making said list:   Do I like this style overall, or do I want to change it? If I want to change it, will I make drastic changes or will I just pick out a few things I want to change? Copy a paragraph of something and circle letters or letter connections you don't like with a different pen color. I think that this would be really fun to do and help you figure out where your problem areas are! Maybe you could even ask a friend to analyze it for you as well, and see if there are any crossovers in things you both didn't like. Wouldn't that be fun! I want to do that now too. Am I willing to be dedicated? If you really want to improve, it's important to practice!    Lastly, I always suggest to search through this subreddit and the ones on the sidebar or go to font sites like dafont.com for inspiration.

Handwriting,3bvswu,BluePanda88,2,Fri Jul 3 13:29:28 2015 UTC,"What I would do is look up how to hold your writing utensil and make sure you have a good grip and form. Then I would look up some pictures and/or videos of people writing scripts/penmanships that you like and try to copy and memorize how they write them or how they look, you can add your own personal style later.

Handwriting,3bwpy1,Uncle_Erik,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:35:10 2015 UTC,"I personally cannot write in cursive that well, so I can only talk about my experience with print. I write pretty quickly because my style does not require any fancy things, only letter connections that help efficiency when I am writing notes.  However, from what I've heard from many people who have studied writing cursive, it really is muscle memory. There was a girl in one of my classes that wrote notes exclusively in cursive and I was amazed at how fast she was writing. I asked her and she said that she just practiced a lot and it basically became second nature to her.  So I think the trick here is to practice a lot in the style that you are interested in. Once something is muscle memory you won't even have to think twice about how you're forming the letter at all.  Good luck with your handwriting journey!!"
Handwriting,3bsx31,s0525mg2,6,Wed Jul 1 21:52:38 2015 UTC,"Hi! There are a couple things that I noticed that you could probably work on.  Firstly, and most importantly, I see that you have some trouble connecting the letters. In ""brown,"" you add an extra dip before you transition into the ""R,"" making it look like it says ""boraum"" or something. You do the same thing between the ""W"" and the ""N."" Similarly in ""over,"" you added another dip before the ""V,"" making it look like a ""W."" It is less obvious in ""fox,"" but it is still apparent. Also, you seem to have had a problem connecting the ""Q"" to the ""U"" in ""quick."" You connected the tail of ""Q"" directly up to the ""U"" and I'm not sure how to explain it other than I think it looks a bit odd. In the same word, you dotted the wrong line and it looks confusing to the eye because of your connection problems.  Next, there seems to be some minor problems with sizing. See ""jumped"" - the ""J"" is large, while the ""P"" is teeny tiny. Also, there is some discrepancy between your sample letters to the left and your sample writing to the right. So one thing you can work on is consistency as well.  Finally, I'm not sure what you want to do with your writing. If you want to be better at cursive, then I would suggest to work on letters that you've kept printed (e.g. A, C, D, M... etc) and practice writing them in a cursive style. If you want it to be a mix of cursive and print, then I would suggest to still work on learning how to connect the cursive letters since you seem to be struggling with it.  Overall, I would suggest learning the basics of cursive because your writing has a lot of unnecessary bumps that make it look very confusing!   Good luck with your practices~ ♫"

Handwriting,3bruz5,Pix3lheart,2,Mon Jul 6 04:26:08 2015 UTC,"For me, at least, the biggest part of fixing things so far has been identifying what needs to be fixed, so you're already off to a pretty good start in that department!  Your lowercase e needs some paying attention to, particularly when it comes in the middle of the word. In the multiple times you wrote ""meaningless"" in the last stanza, there are quite a few times ""less"" looks like ""6ss"" or ""yes"" looks like ""yos"". It seems you don't quite finish the e most of the time and it ends up looking like an o or a hyphen (-). (e's are problems for me too, mine end up looking like i's without the dot.)  Speaking of i's though, be mindful of those as well, there are a few times yours have a tendency to look like colons ("":""), particularly in the last stanza (though I'm sure at that point your tired hand may have been attributable to that). Don't forget to go back and dot the i's as well.  The changing of the hand position so frequently could just be that you're gripping your writing utensil too tightly. Your fingers fatigue and you subconsciously move them to help alleviate said fatigue. So be conscious of how tightly you hold the pen/pencil and see if that helps at all.  Along those same lines with the hand cramping, it really helped me to learn the basics of the Palmer Method (see the sidebar on a computer, if you haven't found it already) and learning to write with my arm instead of my hand. It has all but completely alleviated my problems with hand cramping, but it takes some getting used to, and may feel weird or uncomfortable at first (it did/does for me at least). You're not going to break the lifelong habit of writing with your hand instead of your arm overnight.  Finally, find some paper (check out the sidebar) that can be used to work on spacing (vertically spaced lines (or just take the time to draw them in yourself)) and consistent letter size (horizontally spaced lines). I've been using Manuscript paper (like a composer or musician would use to write music (and you can find that freely available online and just print it off if you don't want to go buy a book of it)) the last few days and it has really helped me with working on my capital letter forms and I've already noticed slight improvements in my letter heighth consistency.

Handwriting,3bj95b,ziplyon,3,Mon Jun 29 17:58:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, it does. Finer lines look more crisp and clean. Broad nibs can be more difficult to control, resulting in sloppier words. I find that monoline handwriting looks best with a fine/medium (0.7/1.0) nib and black ink."
Handwriting,3bj95b,azylee,2,Mon Jun 29 19:22:30 2015 UTC,That does make sense. A finer pen allows for a clearer definition of letters as well as adequate spacing between them. I guess I never really gave it much thought.
Handwriting,3bj95b,One_Left_Shoe,3,Mon Jun 29 19:36:09 2015 UTC,"Depends. Fine pens can look crisp and clean, provided your handwriting is pretty good. For fountain pens, broad nibs tend to write smoother, have better shading from the ink, and can be more forgiving of a shaky hand. With a fine nib, any shakes, stops, or wavering will be very apparent. You can't see those small squiggles as well in a broad nib pen.  As far as spacing and letter definition, that really has to do with your personal hand-writing. The general rule of thumb is to start by writing an 'e'. If the loop in the 'e' isn't visible or very distinct, you need a finer nib."
Handwriting,3bj95b,One_Left_Shoe,2,Tue Jun 30 04:59:22 2015 UTC,"on that note, judging by your writing sample, your 'e' collapses in the 1.4 and 1.0 nib. Personally, I think the .7 looks best for your handwriting."

Sorry to prod, but I saw that it's some sort of marriage contract - congratulations, if you're getting married soon!   Anyway... You have to sign it? Do you want to practice your signature, or do you just sign it in print or something?   Firstly, I don't think it would help to look for only one letter to emulate if it's something you want to use in your everyday signature/handwriting. I think it would be helpful if you did some sample handwriting and really analyzed it to see how you can change it and see which ""K"" would look good with your handwriting. I'm not sure if I'm being clear or not! I think that working on your handwriting as a whole is another story though, so I'm not sure if you're looking for something temporary that you won't use outside of signing that document.  But first, if you want any suggestions on that, it would be good for you to post any handwriting samples you have of your regular writing and/or signature. That way, others can see how they can help you! Otherwise, I think that maybe you could look up some fonts or even browse this subreddit along with the related subreddits in the sidebar to see if you can find a style you really like via others' posts!"

Handwriting,3bfyvn,Nebuleon,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:26:22 2015 UTC,I like the half-linking a lot! Any tips for practice?
Handwriting,3bfyvn,azylee,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:17:29 2015 UTC,"It's pretty difficult for me to say exactly what I do while half-linking, but I can see that:   I exit the paper a lot less; linking occurs the most between letters that end at the baseline (i.e. _) and start at the top of the lower-case letters (i.e. -); I switch to using the cursive 's' and 'r' in certain places but not others; because of the different entry point, 'ms', 'ns' etc. lend themselves well to cursive, but not 'ts', for example; I tend to prefer using unlinked 'or' and 'vr' because those links are awkward to me.   To start, you should try to make the basic shape of 'li': a straight line down, then, instead of exiting the paper, make a curve to the top of 'i', then back down, and dot the 'i'. Following that, try making 'lu', 'ni'/'mi', then 'bs'/'cs'/'ds'/'is'/'ms'/'ns', 'ts' (probably unlinked also), 'ir'/'er' and other pairs you can find that link well.  Even in my regular print, I do linking when the end of a letter and the start of the next one are at the exact same location, as you can see in this image of 'fi'. But then half-linking takes this linking and forces certain pairs of letters to end and start at the same place through the use of quicker cursive forms."

But it was on unlined paper, and your other sample (image, comment) is on lined paper and is much better regarding that, but then the horizontal spacing is weird on 'quick'. It looks like it was written 'q u i c k' compared to the rest of the sample.  Letter shapes aren't too bad. 'v' and 'r' in 'over' look similar, though; 'g' looks written like 'q' in 'dog', but I do see that you write your 'q' with a bar... that's something I haven't seen much.  Maybe while working on making your horizontal spacing consistent, that will also improve the consistency of the shapes."

That's definitely something I took little note of, but I can see now, looking at other's handwriting, that it goes a long way in making your handwriting look neat. Any tips on working on that spacing? Should I just get some fine graph paper and practice on that?"
Handwriting,3bckgk,Nebuleon,3,Sun Jun 28 13:45:36 2015 UTC,"I'd say no for the graph paper, unless you want your writing to look like ...  fixed-width fonts used for coding, where 'i' and 'w' have the same width   You just need to make yourself aware of the entry and exit points of each letter as your wrist moves from one to the other. How much you need to move to the right and raise the pen depends on each letter pairing. I'd suggest working on lined paper, writing the pattern ""aabacadaeaf ... babbcbdbebf [...] ... zuzvzwzxzyzz"". (You could do the capitals as well, either ""AABAC ..."" or ""AaAbAc ..."".)  If you do it right, you will encounter some pairings that you don't need to move much if at all to complete. 'fi' would be the first of those pairings, where the stroke ending the 'f' (the horizontal stroke ending to the right) leaves you at just the right place to start the top of the 'i'.  Here's a quick Gimp sketch of how I do this fi with and without a descender. You can introduce this feature to your handwriting to help control the spacing: too much spacing and the link looks too large, and not enough spacing and the link looks too cramped and becomes illegible."

Handwriting,3bbwse,Toast-in-the-machine,3,Sat Jun 27 19:17:32 2015 UTC,"I think the best way to start practicing is to look for uniformity. Try making the letters always look the same everytime you write them, and there are a lot of exercises you can do to train that. This will make your handwriting 1000% better right away. And once you have a good consistency, you can start practicing script styles with much more ease than trying to just copy a font right away"

Handwriting,3bbwse,lesserweevils,2,Sun Jun 28 00:44:21 2015 UTC,I think the point of arm movement is to avoid planting the side of your hand on the table and picking it up to move every few letters.   Try resting the fleshy area before your elbow on the desk. It acts as a pivot while your hand slides from side to side. The weight of your hand should rest on the 4th and 5th fingers.

The thing is, I've got the 'not planting the side of your hand on the table' thing down, but not the pivoting thing.

Handwriting,3b45jt,spitanus,2,Thu Jun 25 20:37:24 2015 UTC,I would check out the fountain pen subreddit. They are very active and have a bunch of guides to getting your first fountain pen. Also check out their new user thread. Another great resource is the Goulet Pen Company's Fountain Pen 101 videos.   But I'd be happy to give you a couple recommendations! For a pen less than $30 you should check out the Lamy Safari and the Pilot Metropolitan. Those are two of the most popular beginner pens (and the safest to get on amazon). The metro is definitely more professional-looking. A popular recommendation for the ~$50 range is a TWSBI. They are really fun and cool looking pens for the price. The next price range is usually around $120-$150. That's where the gold nibs come into play and you have a lot more quality choices.   The great thing about fountain pens is that they can last you a lot longer than a year. Many people tend to buy their pens for life! Let me know if you want any more recommendations or have any questions :)
Handwriting,3b45jt,rathermediocre,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:29:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot! Which kind of pens are we looking at in the $120-$150 Range?  And what's the difference in normal nibs, and gold nibs?"
Handwriting,3b45jt,rathermediocre,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:33:31 2015 UTC,"It's a little more difficult to give recommendations in this range because there are a lot more variables. Typically fp users kind of know what specific things they prefer. Like the stiffness of the nib, how much ink it holds, the type of filling mechanism, demonstrator or non-demonstrator, size, style, body material, and other things. And of course, inks can definitely affect how a pen writes.  I'll name a few modern pens in this range that are popular on reddit. They all vary a little bit so you can see a range of options. Lamy 2000, Pilot Custom 74, and Pilot Vanishing Point.  I would do a little research on nibs (and everything else) before you buy a pen for more than $100. I think some websites can do a hell of a better job explaining this than I can! There are a lot of different types of nibs, but the main ones are stainless steel, 14k gold, and 18k gold. Typically gold nibs feel a tad more ""flexible-ish"". They have a little give to them as you push down (most times). Gold nibs usually last longer too. Steel nibs are cheaper and harder to ruin, which is why they tend to be on more beginner pens.  That was a super general explanation but thats the main idea. I hope all these details don't turn you away from finding a pen! It can seem overwhelming at first, but in the end you'll find something that looks and writes exactly how you could ever want."
Handwriting,3b45jt,SalAtWork,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:23:44 2015 UTC,If you've never used a fountain pen before.  I suggest getting this cheaper one from Office Depot to decide if you like the difference in feel.  Cheap few bucks to prevent spending 100 on a pen you may not even like to use.
Handwriting,3b45jt,SalAtWork,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:29:39 2015 UTC,To note.  This is NOT the final pen.  But rather a way to see if you like fountain pens at all.

Handwriting,3axvax,dongen,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:15:02 2015 UTC,Your 'P' in your signature shot is missing the bottom serif so it doesn't match the 'P' right below it. Your A's are so unique! I LOVE the lowercase 'z' in the final pic. It's beautiful!
Handwriting,3axvax,CaptainCoral,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:13:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comments.   The uppercase As with loops at the top are based on Arrighi's As, which you may find in his Operina. They're written with one penlift:). You are right about the uppercase P_s. When there's less room, such as in the signature, I use a more compact form with a foot serif. When there's more room, e.g. at the start of a sentence, I use a more liberal, wider form. The latter form needs more work because is sometimes makes the whole _P look unstable. The z is inspired by one of Arrighi's z_s, which has a tail and is simply beautiful. As it turns out, the _z in the ""quick brown fox"" is followed by a lowercase y, which doesn't happen in Arrighi's writing and which requires some care because the tail of the z runs into the tail of the y. I usually solve this by first writing the y and then filling in the z, making sure the tails form a mirror image. This ""right-to-left"" writing is also needed for the ampersand, which you can see in the main body of the text: it's drawn without a penlift."

You were supposed to start at +/- 7 o'clock of the upper circle, moving the pen in south east direction and finishing the bottom circle in clockwise direction. The result of this operation was a degenerate delta, with a large lower part and a tiny tail, the end of which provided a natural entry point for the upper circle.   Next you were supposed to complete the upper circle by starting at the 7 o'clock position of the upper circle and completing it in clockwise direction.    When you practice a bit, you can also do this without a pen lift. You start at the north west oft the lower bowl, complete it in counter clockwise direction, continue into the upper bowl and complete it in clockwise direction.

Here's my attempt: http://imgur.com/vezDcnb  Oddly, I was taught to never join letters with a ""backwards tail"", i.e. g, j, q, y, and z. I have no idea what form of cursive it is.  Also, as I'm left-handed, I find I have to write with the paper at an angle so I don't write slanted. Oh, and I still suck at writing lower-case Ses and Zs."

Handwriting,3aqvxe,lhyeit,2,Mon Jun 22 19:52:17 2015 UTC,"If you can write quickly and painlessly, it's fine.  I think you have one of those adapted ""ballpoint grips"" as I call them. Ballpoints work better at higher angles in contrast to fountain pens. When I got one, I wondered if the classic tripod was developed with fountain pens and their lower writing angle in mind. Switching frequently between the two results in me producing a thin, inconsistent line with the ballpoint.  As an experiment, have you tried holding the pen so that the tip points up towards the writing line instead of downwards as you currently do? Putting your hand below the writing line would prevent smudging (but may or may not be comfortable)."

Bravo to you for wanting to improve it.    I am no expert by any means but I might suggest SLOWING DOWN when you write, it isn't a race to the end of the sentence. Be purposeful about how you form each letter and think about the shape you are making as you write. Also in my opinion capital letters look much cleaner and are much easier to form neatly when you are printing. If you are going to print anyway do it in all capitals and it will look better. I always think it looks more adult as well. Printing with lowercase letters always comes across to me as something that a child wrote.   Stick with it and practice and you'll see improvements."

Handwriting,3agfjm,MyCatBandit,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:16:33 2015 UTC,"My advice is get a pen pal and get a fountain pen.   My handwriting wasn't great in HS and now I'm 25 and my writing is really good, especially for a man.  Since I was a kid, my grandmother sent me letters with $5 in them. I never really appreciated them but I found myself bored after I graduate from College and wrote back to her. Ever since I've written her letters at least once a week. When you are writing a letter legibility is crucial. So I really took my time and with practice my writing got better.   It was also during this time that I discovered fountain pens. Although antiquated, fountain pens don't require as much force when writing. Ballpoints require pressure on the page to draw the ink out while FPs use capillary action and gravity allowing the writer to just touch the tip of the nib to the page. Not to mention you can write a lot more without getting fatigued."

It's probably because, when you speed up, the old muscle-memory starts to kick in again and you fall back to old habits.  Most likely you'll need to slow right down, focus on getting your letter slant uniform and regular (it's already quite nice, IMO, so it wont take much), but mostly it's your letter sizing that needs the most work, I think.

Just take your time with it, make it nice and pretty, you'll find that you'll eventually write nicely and it'll be easier and faster.  One of the things that really helped me when I tried to improve my handwriting was focusing on the slant and spacing. It made me slow down and think about how I placed the letters on the paper. I don't know if it'll work for you, but if you're all out of ideas, it might be worth a try :)  Good luck, OP. I'm sure you'll get it soon. It doesn't look too bad. :)"
Handwriting,3adfy8,irritable_sophist,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:40:39 2015 UTC,"Try a paper with a wider rule. I think you have 5mm quadrille there, which is probably too narrow. Or else try leaving an empty row between your lines of writing, possibly using two rows for each line of text.  It probably won't improve the shape of your writing (or not much) but it would be more legible, and might lead to more productive practice."

See ""h?y"", line 2, word 2; ""??"", line 2, word 4; ""l?a?s"", line 6, word 5.  In general, it looks like print, but a lot of links look like you're wanting to start cursive everywhere. This is most visible in ""Monroe"", line 7, word 5.  This, in turn, makes certain instances of 't' appear to be 'cursive f' too. See ""Monfe"", line 5, word 4; ""fook"", last line, word 4; ""frip"", last line, last word.  Some loops are missing almost completely, such as those in ""charcoal eyes"" (read as ""chorcowl cycs""), line 7, words 2-3; ""She"" (read as ""Shı"" or ""Slu"", this one is semi-cursive), last line, word 1.  To improve, you will first need to slow down while writing. Then, switch fully to print, while paying attention to the following letters' shapes:   'a': this one must have a counter-clockwise semi-circle before the tail; 'e': this one must have a counter-clockwise circle before continuing downwards; 'o': make sure to complete a circle, and that the circle's height matches that of the other lowercase letters; 'r': not cursive! start at top, line down, curve up-right (similar to 'n' but stopping early); 's': not cursive! start at top-right, two zig-zags; 't': start at top, line down, exit paper, start at left, line right.   'n' and 'u' look ambiguous right now, but that's because of the other letters' shapes being wrong. Try some 'n' and 'u', but don't concentrate on those.  Do some practice sheets of whole lines of the same letter (""a a a a a a"", then some sheets where you alternate the letters (so ""a e o r s t"", you can randomise the order too) and some sheets of this prose again but paying more attention to the letters."

Most of the problems with it come from over-tightening when putting it back together. Don't do that and you'll be fine.  You will need bottled ink, it doesn't take a cartridge. It's a fairly large pen, so good if you have large hands, not so good if you like smaller pens, from a comfort point of view, it suits my hand perfectly.   I recommend it. Does depend on what you want out of it though. It doesn't have a flex nib, so you won't get lots of line variation, although for $20 you can get swappable nibs, I'm planning on picking up a 1.1mm nib for myself soon just for some line variation."

They give off a different vibe, I suppose. It makes me feel uncomfortable to look at them within the piece you wrote down because they stop the flow, and not in a good way.   Another thing would be to try to keep your slant consistent.  The rest of your capitals look perfect with the rest of your writing though. Those capitals are interesting because they extend below the line.   Also, is there any reason why you varied the size of your capital C throughout the piece? I noticed that the first time you wrote it, it was way smaller. I only ask because you wrote L two times and they're the same size. So another thing is to keep your capitals the same size.  Nice job!"

Handwriting,39x8yc,irritable_sophist,6,Mon Jun 15 15:27:05 2015 UTC,"There shouldn't be any noticeable tension in your fingers.  Have you done many exercises without a pen in hand? If you're having trouble, it really is best to work for at least a day or two without touching one. See fig. 10 in the full book (unfortunately, the site you're using still only has a fraction of the manual online). Try especially the exercise of relaxing the muscles in your hand and letting it fall gently to the table, onto your third and pinkie fingers. If the heel of your hand is resting on the table, lift it up as slightly as you can. Or try the exercise again, but lead with your fingers when you let your hand drop, not with your wrist.  Once you feel comfortable with your hand in that position—so that it is relaxed, looking much as the illustration in fig. 10, and easily moveable using the whole ""apparatus"" of your arm—then insert your pen. You should have to do very little more than stick it in between your thumb and forefinger using your left hand. Almost no pressure is required to hold it there. And you should be able to move your hand just the same as you had done when it was empty.  One thing that might be happening to cause your heel to drag when you relax your fingers is that you're gripping the pen too closely to the nib or point. Doing this angles your forearm downward from the elbow, driving your wrist or even part of your forearm into the table surface. If your fingertips are less than an inch (or a couple centimeters) from the table, definitely grip further up the body of the pen.  Would it help to think of yourself as perching your arm lightly on the two points of your elbow and little fingers, with your forearm the span of a bridge between them? With Palmer, it's often best to think of the whole ""machine"" as much as its parts. Try, using your shoulder and forearm, to move your hand in circles on the table while both your elbow and wrist are touched down to the surface. Feel the resistance between the skin of your wrist and the tabletop. Try the same thing with your wrist hovering over the table, using your fingernails (all but the thumb) as your forward rest. Likely you can get a smoother, more consistent motion. Try the same thing, but use only your third and fourth fingernails—of the ring and pinkie fingers. Your hand may naturally rotate a little toward the right side of your hand when you make the switch. The tips of your pointer finger and thumb may come together without your making them. If you feel relaxed after doing this, you may well be in a good position to write.  I hope one or more of these tips can be of help. I'll be around if you have any questions, or if something didn't make any sense."

But thanks anyway.  I had done the various preparatory exercises, including the one with dropping the forearm on the desktop to get the arm position.  There has to be some tension someplace in the hand/wrist/forearm, in order to keep the hand from just flopping around and going wherever. Could it be the forearm, keeping the wrist cocked slightly back? That seems to work better than having the whole weight of the hand resting on the fingers."
Handwriting,39x8yc,hcoos,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:48:02 2015 UTC,"Of course the muscles must be doing some work—and so must tense somewhat—but experientially, I feel no tension while at rest or writing.  Could you elaborate on what you mean by ""keeping the wrist cocked slightly back""?  When I write, the forearm, wrist, and hand all form about a 15 degree angle with the table (each rotated slightly toward the pinkie side of the hand), with the weight borne nicely by the elbow and the two small fingers. There is very little clearance between the wrist and the table, but the wrist never more than brushes the surface. I do not feel limp in the forearm—it, after all, has to do much of the lateral movement, and cannot laze about—but I do not feel tensed either, even after a couple hours of writing.  I would be concerned about felt tension at this stage, as it is likely to cause cramp later on."
Handwriting,39x8yc,hcoos,2,Mon Jun 15 21:40:07 2015 UTC,"OK. When I use words like ""tension"" and ""force"" and ""energy,"" I almost always mean the pure physics concept, literal-minded nerd that I am.   the weight borne nicely by the elbow and the two small fingers.   This gets at what I was trying to ask. The tendons of these two fingers are under tension, as they are not fully relaxed?   Could you elaborate on what you mean by ""keeping the wrist cocked slightly back""?   In fig. 25 here the back of the hand makes an obtuse angle with the top of the arm. This could be either because the fingers are supporting weight, or because the muscles of the forearm are holding the hand cocked. I think you've answered that it's the fingers bearing the weight."

To my tastes, you could improve by increasing the ratio of size between the vertical extenders and the rounded portions of the letters--the stem of your ""b"" for example is barely taller than the rounded ""o"" portion.  Same for your ""q"".  I would aim to make the ascenders and descenders twice as long as the rounded portion.  See here for an example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascender_(typography)"

That is, the part of a lower-case letter that is taller than the font's x-height.  Ascenders, together with descenders, increase the recognizability of words. For this reason, British road signs no longer use all capital letters.   Studies made at the start of the construction of the British motorway network concluded that words with mixed-case letters were much easier to read than ""all-caps"" and a special font was designed for motorway signs.

Handwriting,38v2lt,vialeon,4,Sun Jun 7 02:02:35 2015 UTC,Heres how it works.  The fleshy part of your forearm sits on the edge of the table while your elbow is off the desk about an inch. The movement comes from the shoulder upper arm and mostly the forearm. The elbows are bent at right angles and the chest is square infront of the table. A good way to see if you are doing it right is to do the running oval drills from the palmer method.  The whole arm means that you are using the forearm upper arm and shoulders in one motion. Most of the movement actually comes from the fleshy part of the forearm that sits on the desk.

Handwriting,38kftz,santasmic,2,Fri Jun 5 16:08:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This is really helpful. I hate my uppercase G, so it helps to know what's wrong with it!! :)"
Handwriting,38kftz,santasmic,2,Thu Jun 11 16:21:56 2015 UTC,"I really like your handwriting as it is and I find it's quite similar to my print except yours is much more consistent, especially with keeping the letters all on the bottom line. The size is nice and readable as well, so that's a good start. I would stick to doing it more upright if you're going to keep it mostly print. I think print looks better upright while cursive/script looks better on a slant.  As far as making it a bit fancier, I find that there are certain letters that I like to make a bit more unique or put more flourishes on. (Flourishes are the curving lines extending off of letters, especially capital letters. They are more popular in calligraphy.) Some letters you might like to add flourishes to are E, G, H, J, K, R, and S, as well as f, g, l, q, and y.  Some of the most unique handwriting styles in my opinion are ones that use a mix of print and cursive letters. In order to make the style completely your own, practice some cursive letters and find which ones come most naturally to you. These ones that I find I use in my print sometimes are f (which you already do anyways), k, r, s, and z. (And as far as uppercase: F, G, H, I, J, N, S, T, and Z.) However not all those letters I use are used in a traditional cursive way. I like to modify the way I write G, H, and I sometimes; I just kinda make it up as I go along and when I see other people's handwriting. Inspiration can come from anywhere.   And some letters I like to make a bit more ""loopy"" than others or emphasize the loops. When I write those letters tend to be A (loop at the top), H (start at top left making two loops in the lower left and upper right in one smooth motion), J, L, R, S, W, Y, and Z. (Lower case: b, e, f, k, l, q, r (in cursive, at the top left corner of the letter), and y.)   Certain letters that I think you may want to specifically practice improvement on are the following: G - you can make this one really fancy M - same with this one ^ d - try doing it in the cursive style starting from the middle instead of the top h - try looping it q - ^ s - try connecting them to your other letters for a smoother look y - try looping  The bottom line: It's all about experimentation and finding what YOU like. Since we have such similar writing styles I just thought I'd tell you what I do but of course you need to find what works for you. And practice, too! Make it fun by writing out some of your favourite quotes or song lyrics in pretty coloured pens. Or try different kinds of pens and papers (I LOVE using fountain pens).   Another tip: try writing with brush pens (Tombow ones are my favourite). They increase your confidence in your handwriting and they're handy for addressing envelopes or whenever you need to write something a bit fancier.   Best of luck to you! Please post your progress, I'll follow your posts. :)"

Handwriting,38kuhp,SMetzsch,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:33:47 2015 UTC,"Decent, but you don't close your 'a', 'g', 'q'; your 'k' looks like your 'h'; and these may raise ambiguity in some words.  Line 2 word 1, ""What"", reads as ""Whut"".  Line 2 word 4, ""think"", reads as ""this"", but it looks more like you actually wrote ""this"" instead of messing up the ""nk"".  Line 2 word 5, ""of"", reads as ""2f"" (lower case 2 + f).  Line 3 word 2, ""handwriting"", reads quickly as ""hanelwritihy"".  In the alphabet, 'b' looks like it could also be a '6'; 'o' would be better done starting from the top and going counter-clockwise (because right now it looks like a snail, and this may explain the lower case 2 in ""of"").  You seem to start many letters from the bottom (especially 'p' and 'N'), when the more natural way to write them is from the top. The more consistent start point makes your wrist move more consistently from letter to letter, which would help your vertical alignment as well."

It's like someone writing their notes with a calligraphy pen... it's totally the wrong way to write anything that you need to be able to read (work duties) with efficiency.   Since they are using 90% of the space on the line, they should go to double-spaced lines. As it is, the eye doesn't have a visual cue for following the text without getting confused by everything around it. The descenders are going down 75% into the line below in some cases! Why not just skip that and scribble all over your text instead? It would have the same effect... The lowercase R is accentuated in a bad way. Especially on the line 'Finalize Numbers'... the 'ber' combination is nearly unreadable and looks like 'lrr'. The tails are a nice flourish, but because they literally look like everything else in the font, they appear to be part of an actual character, so again, hard to read.   Sorry, this comes off as really negative, and it's not my intent... it just brought out my critical side.  All of that said, as art it really is a beautiful font.

Handwriting,37l67r,handwrittenfont,1 point,Sun May 31 10:47:51 2015 UTC,"I used a dip nib and iron-gall ink though.  nibs and holder are dirt cheap, you can easily buy a couple different ones to experiment with. Spitzfedern ( Pointed nibs) can produce these hairlines and big shades, Kugelspitzfedern / Pfannenfedern (Ballpoint nibs) are easier to write with but produce a fairly thick line (like a fountain pen) and are not that flexible.  Iron Gall ink is amazingly well behaved - no feathering / bleedthrough, absolutely waterproof and great hairlines - but it's acidic, it will corrode your nibs and eat the paper over the course of a few hundred years.  heaven't heard anything good about flexible fountain pens. You are limited to fountain pen friendly ink, flex is very limited and if you press too hard and ruin your nib it can be quite expensive to get a new one. Afaik they are also prone to railroading, and once the inkflow is disrupted, it's a pain in the ass to get it going again."

While there are similarities the most prominent letter that stands out is the reddit user's 's' in his username, this is not reciprocated in the note. The word 'THE' is written in block capitals in both and there are considerable differences. Lastly, he writes his number 7 differently, that's a big clue.   Nothing can be taken from this though as they may have consciously changed their handwriting or it may have changed over the space of a year and a half. The different thickness of pen also doesn't help with the analysing and the constant changes between block capitals and lowercase is throwing me off."

Handwriting,37gvqk,Ihavesiftedthistles,2,Wed May 27 19:17:06 2015 UTC,"If it is the same person, they at least put a little thought into making the letters differently. It's hard to say.  The capital E's - in the original letter the vertical line connects to the bottom ""rung"" of the E, then two separate strokes are added.  It looks like the response note was one downstroke, with 3 separate strokes for the rungs, most notably in the word ""THE"".  But all the other ones look a little like the writer WANTED to connect the lower rung to the top, but didn't.  The numbers are different. The original's ""5"" looks like one stroke, and it ""loopy/curvy""  The response's ""5"" are 2 strokes, and not as round.  The 7 is different but that's an easy one.  Also on the lower case ""u""s - the original did not use any ""tails"" but the response did.  Then again - the lower case ""y""s - in both letters, they share the same height with the rest of the word.  If anything, the response letter did a good job of making it hard to tell if it was written by the same person by using all caps. If they had used lower case, there would be a lot more to go off of.  Both seem to have the same lack of slant - straight up and down writing except ""I have the note"" which slants to the right as it is emphatic.  Note to self: learn proper terminology for parts of handwriting.  I'm sure the parts of the ""E"" are not called ""rungs"""

Only my ink was different.  It's gotten a LOT better.  Enough that one of my roommates saw my handwriting and started to practice, too!  One of the first things I did was print out this NY Times article and practice with it right on the paper: http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/09/04/opinion/20090908_opart.html?_r=0  I gained a lot of insight here.  Some of the blurbs and illustrations communicate so much more than an explanation could, for example it shows how our brains process mostly the top halves of lower-case letters, and by extension much legibility is added by keeping their tops aligned.  I'm still new to this, but it seems to me that handwriting at any level is a trade-off between attentiveness, speed, and quality.  Gaining some clues on how to allocate and prioritize those resources helped me a lot at the start.  Good luck!"

The writing utensil, ink, and paper you use don't make your writing good, consistency and uniformity do.

Handwriting,375c39,lolpierandom,1 point,Mon May 25 05:10:09 2015 UTC,"I agree/disagree with this somewhat. Letters don't ALL have to be the same. I look at letter combinations. All my ""th""s for instance have the same look, but t's or h's elsewhere are different somewhat… But perhaps to start, it would be good to gain control in general, so maybe it's not bad advice."
Handwriting,375c39,lolpierandom,9,Mon May 25 11:25:45 2015 UTC,"It looks like you're starting some letters at the top and others at the bottom. If you draw a series of lines quickly (like this: ||||||) you'll probably find that starting every line at the top is neater than alternating between the top and bottom. For this reason, when printing it's recommended to start most letters at the top (except possibly d and e).  Here's a chart I made. Most letters are made in one stroke for speed. The letters are grouped by shape instead of alphabetically because they're made with similar movements. Handwriting is a skill based on muscle memory so you may find practising these shapes/movements helpful. Make sure to clearly distinguish the height differences between letters like a, d and g and stick to the baseline.  Letter formation is extremely important in cursive. The joins depend on it. If you decide to learn cursive, many of the letter formations are similar to the print letters in my chart so hopefully you won't have too much trouble.

I recently bought a nice pen and some nice paper for my next semester. I do a pretty good job keeping up with my pens, so I decided it was time.

If you're switching to a fountain pen, perhaps give cursive a shot? This page looks like it's written in ballpoint- cursive is much more enjoyable to write in fountain. If you stick with print, perhaps try working with practice sheets or just copying blocks of text (like the weekly writing practices) slowly. Practice is really the only thing that will improve your handwriting. If you focus on making your handwriting look better first, speed will come with time."

Cursive is something I plan to practice over summer, so I'll definitely do that. I learned in late elementary school, but that was about 12 years ago.  This was written in ball-point pen, the good 'ole Paper-Mate. Actually, the ball-point is one of my least favorite things to write with, specifically this cheap one that comes in a box of 60 for less than half the price of a decent pen.  This summer I plan to practice as often as I can, which I suspect to be 5 or 6 times a week. I'll try some practice sheets."

I'm probably picking up some Noodler's next.  But yeah, it's a good pen/ink combo, definitely enjoyable to use."

Your extremely false assumption is that all prostitutes in Thailand (or prostitutes in general) are abused women is entirely incorrect. 99% of them become prostitutes because they can make more money doing that than they can working in a farm or factory or shop. Yes, there are women who are forced to do it and there are children working as prostitutes as well, but they are a minority. Sex workers in general choose that industry because they have no skills and come from poor areas where advancement in society is difficult. A woman with no skills can earn a lot of money as a prostitute.  While you may not like it, and obviously hold erroneous and biased views of sex workers, the vast majority are not victims of violent criminal gangs or children. They are by and large poor women doing whatever they can to survive in the world. And women have been doing this since the beginning of humanity.   Your attitude towards sex workers is far more harmful than anything their customers are doing. It is people like you that turn these women in to criminals when all they are trying to do is earn a living. I swear to god if you come back with some idiotic comment like ""they are all abused"" or ""they should get training in some kind of trade"" or ""the government should arrest everyone who visits prostitutes"" I'll probably track you down and smack you in the face because if they could do that they probably would have already. Your judgemental attitude is destructive. These women live in shit countries under shit circumstances with little hope for anyone, especially poor women, many of whom have children to care for. They are doing what they have to do in order to survive and making good money for it.   You might not like it but no one really cares what you think you pompous fuck."

Most of those women were sold into it as a child, a family of twelve won't really feel bad about selling one kid because it's food for eleven for a week or a month and they know the kid has a decent chance of survival. These men and women get rent and some money to send home but choose it they did not.

In the US, and possibly other places, many sex workers do have skills and/or training for other professions, but those jobs are in short supply, don't pay well, or don't work around other aspects of the woman's life, like children, or trying to continue her education. Your assumption that sex worker = unskilled person is pretty insulting.  And yes, many sex workers are children or victimized by violent gangs or boyfriends (sometimes fathers) who are basically pimps The average age of entry for sex workers is 13, and even here in the US there are a lot of girls out working who should be in high school or middle school. Tricks don't care. If anything, they get pissed off at the girls for ""making them"" feel guilty about it, but they fuck them anyway."

If your issue is that your notes are ultimately useless for revision because they're just a rehash of textbook/lecture slides, taking this advice and reassessing your notetaking style, rather than your handwriting, is a good idea.  I used to type/write everything out as well, then started doing this. Keep your notes fairly general without too much detail, and later on, see if you can further elaborate on a concept in a textbook/lecture from looking at what you wrote down. It's a good way to encode things in your memory differently and also gives you a nice way to gauge what you truly know. If you can, come up with a general structure for notetaking (I've come up with my own and use a lot of bullet points, I'm sure Google could help you here) and stick to it.  You'll also find notetaking this way makes the act of practicing your handwriting through notetaking a much more productive and less stressful ordeal. You can focus on making things look good when you're not scrambling to scribble every little thing down ;)"

Make up your own shorthand for those kinds of terms and not take notes in the form of a hierarchy of materials.   If that doesn't make sense, PM me."

I know there are a couple of books written on it but I think this is a case of over thinking it.  Test it out for a while by just using mind mapping while reading some chapter to give it a test run. Another technique is to outline the chapters the night before on the right 2/3's of a regular sheet of paper before the lecture and during the lecture enter any additional notes or ideas on the left 1/3 of the paper during class allowing you to more fully involved in the lecture.  The same can be done with the mind mapping.  I used this method in college and still use it today 30 years later."

Handwriting,36xjhe,kaptainkek,4,Sat May 23 06:31:13 2015 UTC,"a) Wonky vertical alignment.  In line 2, starting at ""for"", the writing has been lifted from the baseline. Line 4 is all off the baseline, starting again at an 'f'. Not sure what happened with the ""Thank you!"" and ""Have a nice day!"" lines. That last one is going upwards as well.  As for letters misaligning, see ""on"" (line 2 word 8) with its 'n' raised above the 'o'; ""handwriting"" (line 3 word 4) with the 'w' going up, the 'iti' starting down and going up again.  b) Inconsistent letter shapes.  Instances of 'd' in ""wanted"" (line 2 word 2) and ""could"" (line 2 word 9) do not extend upwards, so they read like 'a'. Other 'd' are fine.  'e' in ""help"" (line 2 word 6) and in ""nice"" (line 6 word 3) are not even looped, so the surroundings can read like a 'u' (hup, niu).  'i' in ""skills"" (line 3 word 5) and ""nice"" (line 6 word 3) are not dotted at the right place at all, so it can get confusing to read quickly.  ""find"" (line 4 word 2) is especially problematic, because you have an extra loop after 'f' that could be an 'e', you then dot the 'i' and use the same vertical line as the start of the 'n'! So it can read quickly as ""feid"" with a weird connection from 'i' to 'd'.  c) Half-linking  You may get more out of any practice you make by temporarily dropping half-linking, switching to full print or full cursive. Going to print would make you very acutely aware of when your wrist ends a letter and must start the next one ('a' as o + tail ends at the bottom right, so you make your wrist raise your hand before the next letter; 'b' ends at the bottom left, so you make your wrist raise your hand diagonally, etc.) Going to cursive would make you connect every letter.    With all that said, you could probably make a practice sheet, repeating these words over and over on 2 or 3 lines each:  on on on on one one one one once once once once adage adage adage adage could would could would error error error error  And others you particularly struggle with. Maybe ""find"" should go in there too. Stop when you're satisfied with how an entire line turns out, and then write a note in prose again.  Good luck!"

Handwriting,36qz9c,simmiedude,1 point,Thu May 21 14:03:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the pen, although at £120 it's a bit much for me at the moment. I have a Lamy Safari at the moment since I'm just getting into fountain pens.  The Spencerian script looks a bit different to this; it's smoother and less rugged if you get what I mean. Will I just have to make it my own style?"
Handwriting,36qz9c,simmiedude,10,Thu May 21 14:06:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, your best place to start is with the Spencerian Script and go from there. It will get you used to making long wavy lines, making soft (thin) and hard (wide) lines and such. It takes quite a bit of work to get the muscles adjusted to this kind of cursive. I would also take a look at the Chancery Cursive script also for more harsh line variation. This script can be done with just about any pen, but works best with an italic nib.  Will you be able to get decent practice from your Safari, but one of the key things in the form of cursive you see in the video and Spencerian is the ability to flex the nib of the pen. If I am not mistaken, the nib in the video is modified to work in a specific manner, so even my Pilot Falcon wouldn't be able to achieve the same results shown in the video. Your second best bet would be to get a Noodler's Ahab ($25, not sure about your region). This will give a decent flex pen for the money."
Handwriting,36qz9c,TheEpicSock,3,Thu May 21 14:15:30 2015 UTC,"The guy in the video has a Falcon modified for extra flex and finer hairlines. What you can do for a similar pen is to get some Zebra G nibs and stick them into a Jinhao x750/x450, or (better) to get a dip pen holder (an oblique one if you want to learn Spencerian) and some nibs for like 20 bucks total."

The only things I'd say are:  a) Beware the size of your print letters. Your printed alphabet lines start out with big letters and end up small. I ignore the spacing here, because that's more owing to the fact that you started to realise you couldn't fit the alphabet if you spaced it as much as between 'A' and 'B'.  b) Print '4' (cap-height style) reads more like a 't' at quick glance. I'd make it more like the ""cursive cap-height style 4"" for quick reading. [edit: In ""number context"", e.g. inside a phone number, your current print '4' would be quicker to read.]  These are very minor, and I already enjoy reading your cursive (I don't usually enjoy reading cursive)."

Handwriting,368y8b,JaneOLantern,4,Sun May 17 23:04:12 2015 UTC,"From my knowledge, this is one of many previously common contractions of words used back in the day. 'y' was, as others have noted, a substitute for the 'thorn' (þ) character. Other common contractions included: a 't' on top of a 'y' to indicate 'that' and a 't' on top of a 'w' to indicate 'what'. N.B. My understanding of these contractions comes largely from David Harris' 'The Art of Calligraphy' to take this with a grain of salt!"
Handwriting,368y8b,SirScribe,2,Sun May 17 10:54:47 2015 UTC,"The thorn is pronounced like the modern ""th"", so ""the"" would be ""þe"". As people got lazier with their writing, the thorn started to break apart and look more like a Y, and thus ""ye"" as ""the"" was born!"

Handwriting,369aiv,AuspiciousApple,3,Sun May 17 12:46:20 2015 UTC,"Change the way you write. The standard. Usually I write with the pen resting on the finger left of the pinky but I can manage the middle finger if I want to. Always remember to stretch your hand when it starts cramping. Do massages to it. Try and rub the joints. Do the stretching thing where they crack if needed. Press them flat against the table with your arm parallel* (should be perpendicular) to the table and the fingers all stretched. Anything to get them to reset. I hope these tips helps. I usually do one of these or shake my hand, keep them loose and just shake them like if they had no strength.  Ah, these tips are for the cramping. To get it more legibly I would recommend you practice with a random book on how to write speedily but with accuracy. Practice makes perfect. Say the words in your head that you want to write if needed and imagine how they will look. If you have the argument in the head imagine it as it is already written and try to get your hand to follow what your mind is imagining. Don't know how well it would work for you but it's worth giving a try."

How do you grip the pen? Do you grip very tightly or press down very hard? A pen with a thicker grip section may help. If you press down too hard, try switching to a gel pen, rollerball or even a fibre-tipped pen. They tend to work with less pressure than a ballpoint. I personally prefer liquid ink because pressure isn't necessary to write, only contact with paper.  Look into exam strategies as well. Spending a few minutes to plan an essay outline (I only ever wear a watch during exams) helps. Other tactics can help you save time or make better use of it. The goal is to get as many marks as possible so for instance, there's no point in wasting precious time on a question you can't answer. Circle it or fold the page over and try again after answering everything you know. Skim over all the questions at the beginning and ration a reasonable portion of time for different sections, e.g. 1 hour for multiple choice and 2 hours for essays in which each essay takes 30 minutes, etc. Make sure to work through the exam at a pace where you'll reach the last questions. Spend more time on questions that are worth more and less on questions that are worth less and so on."

Handwriting,363g10,Titoandthemonkey,5,Fri May 15 19:53:22 2015 UTC,"If you head over to /r/fountainpens you can get a lot of information.  But anyway, with a ballpoint you need to push down to actually write with it. Roller balls require less force and fountain pens don't need any pressure at all because fundamentally fountain pens are a controlled leak of ink.  I've recently bought a pilot metropolitan (or MR depending on where you live) and I absolutely love it. Here is some pictures just to see If you like it http://imgur.com/a/hzOn5 . Its a Japanese made company called Pilot and is very good quality. Another good starting pen is the LAMY safari, which comes in many colours and nib sizes which are interchangeable between the LAMY pens. I'm sure there is many other starting pens but off the top of my head these are the two I know of.   Im not sure if you like a thin nib or wider nib, but in most cases , the thinner the nib the more ""scratchy"" it may be and that could put you off using a fountain pen, but you should research it because Asian brand pens usually have thinner nibs than wester nibs ( so for example a medium would be a fine in western pens).  The great thing about fountain pens is that there are so many inks to choose from, and you may end up spending a lot of money on them haha. Noodlers and diamine inks are quite popular and fairly inexpensive depending where you live. Parker quink is a good workhorse ink but you will have to research into it because there is honestly such a wide variety of inks to choose from.  Furthermore, its true inks can affect how your pen works as they can be wet or dry inks, or lubricate your pen. There are also waterproof inks or inks which will last longer than the paper. So again a bit if research into inks might be more useful than me blabbering on.  The paper you use is also another factor. I'm sure you've used cheap paper you can buy in bulk which is fine for ball points, but using a higher density paper can greatly improve your writing experience as often is the case with the right combination it feels like writing on butter.  But writing with a fountain pen will ease up the pressure on your hand and you may feel more comfortable using it and that may give more of an incentive to write and practise more. Also it is a well tested fine writing instrument which could be attractive to you and help you with your improvements. However fountain pens do not magically improve your handwriting. That's what hard work is for.  I hope this can be of use to you!"

If you do like the look of the pilot metropolitan, I have a medium at the moment and it honestly isn't so thick and may be OK for you handwriting, but if you go on here http://www.gouletpens.com/nib-nook you can see samples of different pens and their nib sizes.

Handwriting,363g10,Canthros,1 point,Sun May 17 00:24:45 2015 UTC,"I'd go as far as suggesting a Pilot Varsity as a first pen.  After all, if you don't like it, you're out less than $10 for 3 of them, they come all inked up and ready to go, and, when they're empty, you just throw them away.

At least that's what I would do, but I'd probably go the Photoshop way since that would be ""faster"".

The dissertation question I posed was:  ""Interrogating Torture: To what extent can it be argued that the use of torture as an interrogation technique during the War on Terror was an integral part of the United States of America's intelligence gathering?""  The evidence shows that the the use of torture in interrogation rarely, if ever, provides actionable intelligence.  Although I can understand the drive behind the interrogators to do everything humanly possible to produce actionable intelligence, I personally find the practice profoundly distasteful; more-so as it yields little result."

Handwriting,35njjm,x-ta-sea,2,Mon May 11 23:36:03 2015 UTC,"Your shapes are quite legible!  However:  You start your lines with pretty big letters and end them small. And your capital letters before lowercase letters don't end on the baseline.  A perhaps more complex thing is that your handwriting is half-linking (generally print, but linking a few letters at a time as if they were cursive). I can see that more readily in [gra]ndfat[her] (line 9 word 2), p[ro]m[pt]ly (line 10 word 2) and [ju]d[ge]d (line 10 word 4). Your shapes look quite different if they're being half-linked. I can read grandfather as grandfatlwr due to the loop in 'e' being missing. 'q' in quartz (line 9 word 5) looks different from the one in quick (line 8 word 2). The 'r' in over (line 8 word 6) is outright cursive, but the one in grandfather is a regular 'r' half-linked into the next 'a'.  Your lines of prose are relatively well-aligned and similarly-sized vertically (except for a few words, like antique on line 10 whose 'n' is the same size as the entire 't'). Your alphabet, however, is not."

Handwriting,35kr2j,Hoihe,2,Mon May 11 08:15:36 2015 UTC,"in grade schools they teach you the running hand method with c-ties (or a tilted alternative), that might look nice, but you can not write fast enough with it, or without spoiling the outlook.  the aim of the running hand is that you raise your pen from the paper as rarely as possible. the proper running hand: you fully write the word, then put on the apostrophes - starting from above - and then you go to the next word.  i personally stop mid word at a c-tie and put on the apostrophes before i go to the next letter. its somewhat faster and its still legible."
Handwriting,35kr2j,Poefi,1 point,Tue May 12 07:26:15 2015 UTC,"My native language is French, which has many kinds of accents (é, è, ê). In French, you have to be careful to write the correct accent, and not something that ends up looking like a straight line up or a straight line across (ē), so it slows you down.  If Hungarian has only one kind (´), you can make the accents faster by pretty much not caring if you make double straight lines up, or single lines across.  However, I'd recommend not going too fast, realising that making accents does inevitably slow you down, and instead focusing on making the accents from their lower-left corner, to the upper-right corner. That makes lowercase accented letters (á, é, í, ó, ú) almost equivalent to the upper-case letter U in terms of pencil exit point while using print handwriting. That allows you to figure out where to move your wrist for the next letter to start. You can then make practice sheets where you write things like 'UaéaUaéaUmámUmám' to practice. Note how the U ends at the same place as the accent.  You could also write unaccented words first, then write all the accents once you're done writing one word, a bit like cursive writers do with lines on 't'/'x' and dots on 'i'/'j'."

Handwriting,35hlj7,gndowns,6,Sun May 10 15:18:17 2015 UTC,"You're correct, using your arm is correct. This person is merely writing in the style of Palmer script, not using the method."
Handwriting,35hlj7,cae388,1 point,Sun May 10 16:40:32 2015 UTC,"Slight finger movements are acceptable for ascenders and descenders. But yeah, the person is lifting way to much which suggests they are planting their wrist too heavily which prevents easy lateral flow of the arm."
Handwriting,35hlj7,MiaLovesGirls,1 point,Sun May 10 21:11:09 2015 UTC,"You're right. And you don't reposition your hand, you reposition the paper under it—though that might have been impossible, as the writer looks to have been holding the camera in his left hand. The only parts of your arm to touch the desk should be your ""rest"" fingertip(s) and your elbow, or a point just above your elbow if you're especially skinny. And you shouldn't be repositioning more than once or twice a line—certainly no more than once on paper as small as what was being used.  It looks like the Palmer script was copied (minus the 'r' and the simplified descender on a final 'y'), but nothing of the method—a lot of wrist and finger movement which Palmer did not recommend. His method is meant as a compromise between speed, stamina (lack of cramp), legibility, and respectability (in the context of a late 19th century business place); the speed and stamina are lost when you ignore the first few chapters, which describe full-arm movement."

Handwriting,3543gg,macena,1 point,Thu May 7 00:22:15 2015 UTC,"I did consider this but I checked on the smallest device I had, my phone, and it was still reasonable to read. When you say column width do you mean on the website or the page size? Line spacing is something I have considered, I currently use Rhodia Dotpad paper which I believe is 5mm spacing, I may double line it and see how that reads. Thank you for your feedback though, I really appreciate it!"
Handwriting,3543gg,macena,1 point,Thu May 7 00:43:27 2015 UTC,"Sorry, English is not my first language, so it got confusing. I was actually talking about the proportion between the real paper and the site's image. In my 15"" laptop, your handwriten text is 5.8"" wide, so your words end up small (for me, at least). Your Dotpad is 8""x11"", right? This means the word-width is reduced to 72% of its original size.   I believe it would improve reading if you maintained the original paper size in your blog, maybe using 1"" margins each side, so you would get a 6"" width, the same as the site's image width. Maybe you could ask your friends in different monitors if they can read it easily or they also think it's a bit small. Good luck on your blog!"

Handwriting,3543gg,GraseCul,1 point,Thu May 7 13:35:23 2015 UTC,"When I try to read it I find my eyes straining. Multiple times I've begun a paragraph, and then I just don't want to continue. I'm on a 1080p LCD with a healthy set of eyes. Font smoothing normally handles text very well, so that I can read even very tiny fonts, but images don't benefit from that same smoothing.  It looks like you are scanning your pages, bumping up the brightness and contrast (to remove the dot grid?), and then uploading them at a larger size than you're actually displaying them at in the site. This causes the browser to scale them down to fit, which uses anti-aliasing, but only a bit. So in the end, the firm strokes come out clearly, but when you combine the level tweaks and scaling, the light strokes get very distorted.  Honestly, my biggest problem is the main gimmick of the site... reading a scan of handwritten text is very difficult unless it is at a resolution that allows your eyes to follow it with the same accuracy as a piece of paper sitting on the desk in front of you. This is just a suggestion, but have you considered using a javascript zoom plugin? Like the ones on shopping sites where you mouseover the image too see it zoomed... this might be a good application for that."

Upon squinting and trying, I think it's ""nothing""  I also think there's a thing you're doing with your ""e""s where it spills over into other parts of the word and makes it really hard to read.  ""Even"" looks like ""exen""  ""Between"" looks like you were crossing out a mistake in the word.  It also seems like the ""ink"" is too thick for the style you are writing in - if you were doing the same writing with a smaller point, it might look a lot better, like in the 2nd and 3rd lines.

The 4th word (much) looks like ""mucn"" - maybe you did that because of the large descender of ""My"", though. The 5th word (better) looks like ""letter"" with an extra loop. The 8th word (I) looks like it could be a lower case 'b'. The 9th word (write) looks like it could be ""writi"" that you forgot to dot.

Slow down, and focus on making lines straighter or perfecting the curve of a letter. My favorite letters to write are capital B's because I find them fun, and I can write them so many different ways, so I end up practicing B's far more than I practice any other letter.  Also, with taking your time, take your pen off your paper. I notice in your writing, your first ""F"" in your first sentence honestly looks like a D with a line through it. This is because you're writing fast, and so you conjoin just about every line of the F into one stroke. Take your time and take your pen off your paper.  Practice. Practice, practice, practice. Seriously. If you're not doing anything and/or if you're bored, just pick up a pen and paper and start writing. Gibberish. Look at other people's handwriting and take some mental notes.  I'm not saying you have to truly dedicate time to having better handwriting, though it doesn't hurt, I'm saying that if you have a few minutes to spare or you're in a boring class or meeting, just start writing.

Don't underestimate its importance because it prevents letters from deteriorating when writing quickly! There is a reason why young children are taught to start most print letters at the top (except 'd' and possibly 'e'). If you draw a series of lines at top speed like this ||||||| you'll find that it's neater to start every line at the top compared to if you alternate between starting at the top and bottom.   I'd suggest these letter formations.   In my opinion, good handwriting is all about movement within and between the letters.

Handwriting,3486dq,DiLisioMatrix,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:51:12 2015 UTC,I normally write it slow and it still turns out like this. This is my normal handwriting and Spanish is not my native language or something I am learning its the writing exercise for this subreddit.
Handwriting,3486dq,Nebuleon,3,Wed Apr 29 22:30:26 2015 UTC,"Pay attention to the vertical size and alignment of the letters you write.  Some letters you write are shorter or taller than the average. For example, see the last word of line 2, and the 2nd word of line 6. The result looks inconsistent because then the shorter letters look smooshed.  Likewise, the base line of some letters is too low. For example, your 's' everywhere looks too low, and so does the 5th word of line 7.  Also pay attention to your letter shapes. You have a lot of letter shapes that require knowing the target language (Spanish) to read in context.   Lines 1 and 2 contain these words: bruta, astuta, prostitutas. Because you write 'a' and 'u' similarly, and the letters 'a' and 'o' are not always closed well, they can read as brutu, ustutu, and prustitutus, or as brata, astata, and prustitatas. Lines 1 and 2 contain these words: gente, virgenes. Because you write 'e' with a very large bowl, they can read as gonto and virgonos. Line 2 contains these words: Hay virgenes. Knowing only 'hay', 'virgenes' could be read as 'viryenes'. Knowing only 'virgenes', 'hay' could be read as 'hag'. The letter shapes are similar, and you don't close your 'g'.   So I'd start with exercises to close letters, and then exercises to align your letters vertically. Those two things would make your handwriting much more legible."

Just keep at it, you're going to be creating new neural connections and that's why it's an annoying thing, like learning anything new. Also try to do a lot more with your right side, I read that it helps because it trains your brain to use the non-dominant hemisphere of your brain and in theory should help with your endeavour. IE: Use your right foot/leg as the dominant one when walking, when you eat with knife/fork, etc."
Handwriting,346qee,JJKirby,1 point,Wed Apr 29 12:31:53 2015 UTC,"So when I was first learning to drum, my teacher gave me some exercises to improve my non dominate hand. It may sound like it isn't helpful, but try these using your non dominant hand: Throw a ball in the air and catch it, throw it against the wall and catch, play catch with someone. Use it to eat, and maybe use it to control the mouse. When doing super common things you normally use your dominant hand for, switching it up can actually make a huge difference. You'll begin to think about using it a lot less, and writing with it will begin to feel less foreign."

Handwriting,348jbj,extralean,2,Wed Apr 29 04:47:04 2015 UTC,"Try for more uniform letter height. The word 'doesn't' in the first line has an 'o' with nearly double the height of the loop on the 'd' directly preceding it. Also consider working on your letter spacing in individual words. The letters before your 'd's and 's's tend to crowd them, which makes for hunchback letters and funky looking words."

It soon went away but had some long-term consequences in cursive teaching. (A step toward ball-point, wrist-and-finger writing.) Here's a copy book from a similar hand. (They were all knock-offs of French and German systems, if I remember.)  In the U.S., at least, most cursives in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were not too many steps removed from Spencerian, the best-known of these derivatives being the much simplified Palmer Method. A search for ""penmanship"" in about the 1900s and 1910s will bring up many others that look almost exactly the same—though few others used Palmer's lowercase R. If you leaf through these books, you'll find that much of the text is devoted not to letterforms, but to technique—that is, what you're doing with your arm, how you're seated, and so on. If you want to go down that rabbit hole, be prepared to invest hours with handwriting like a six-year-old's all over again.  Diligent searching can turn up online scans of old parish and census records, back when they were done by hand, and from a variety of places. This PDF, for example, goes over some common letterforms found in Norwegian records of about 1700-1900.  You may also be interested to see the manuscripts and notes of (mostly) well-known authors at the British Library and elsewhere. See, for example, these letters by Charlotte Brontë. Or poke around a scan of the only remaining manuscript copy of John Milton's Paradise Lost, courtesy of the Morgan Library in New York (not written in Milton's hand, of course, as he was blind at the time and dictated the entire thing, including revisions).  (You'll find that many of these old manuscripts, letters, etc., are written in sloppy hands—go search out Dickens for some real scratch!—but that's only to be expected. After all, every minute spent improving one's handwriting is a minute spent not improving one's writing.)"

Handwriting,33vpla,TheHockeyist,6,Sun Apr 26 02:09:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its not good. It's readable, but very difficult in some places. You completely drop letter forms in places, making words look unrecognizable. Slow down and make sure every letter is being formed, and make letters distinct from one another. You're missing 2 letters from ""when"" and the word ""average"" looks like ""avege"" to me, and that's just a couple things. Your handwriting looks like short-hand writing, which is fine if you're the only one to read it. If other people have to read it though, you need to make it clearer."
Handwriting,33vpla,yetanotherr4ruser,1 point,Sun Apr 26 04:55:35 2015 UTC,"aveage... many people have had problems with r in my writing. Especially when it's after a or e, I tend to draw it as a stroke that's connected to the previous letter and headed out toward the upper-right. When it's before a letter (often a or e), I often draw it as a small, hard-to-see curve that smoothly goes into the next letter.  And when? All the letters are there. The h often ends up with a horizonal stroke at the bottom, especially when it's before e. The e is drawn as a loop, and the n is drawn as a bit of an wide arch hanging downards. So it's perfectly fine for me.  And according to this comment... maybe I do need to slow down a bit? One of my best friends has no problem with this either... but I'm actually surprised at how illegible you guys think it is. Seriously. Sigh..."

You can also get your points across quickly and clearly to your professors if they can identify words quicker. Your handwriting unfortunately lacks the ""shapes"" our eyes are used to seeing.  Like others have said, slow down, and develop your letters. I may suggest buying a graphing notebook and using it to start defining your letters better."

Handwriting,33vpla,Nebuleon,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:33:36 2015 UTC,"I do have to read some of your letters for about 10 seconds to know what they are, and then reform the word from all the letters. I also have to read some of your sentences word by word and have to reform the sentence with guesses as to what the words are. That's definitely not good.  As examples (with line numbers starting after the line containing ABC...Z abc...z):   Line 2 ends with something that looks like ""wLa"". I couldn't figure out what that was, even after a minute. Line 4 word 7 looks like ""wll"", but I had to reform it to ""well"" to make it a word. Line 4 contains a sentence that I thought read like ""Sometimes o silver me problems as well, but not too much"". I had to reguess at the third word (gives), then re-read the sentence a few times before it made sense. Line 5 starts with something that reads quickly like ""If I'm really 2 Lucy, may Lttcs turn into dots"". I reguessed ""2 Lucy"" into ""a lazy"" or ""a hurry"" before continuing on, re-reading the sentence to make sure it made sense after each guess. Then ""may"" into ""my"", and ""Lttcs"" into ""letters"". Line 6 word 5: That word (really) also reads as ""easily"" with a reversed s, which also makes sense as it's an adverb. Line 7: I thought ""It's my parents Who I with show it's almost perfect"" was a single sentence before reguessing, and then I figured out it's ""It's my parents. When I write slow, it's almost perfect.""   ""This is slower."" is good. ""This is average."" reads like ""aveage"", with the 'r' seeming to be completely missing. ""Trs is tut."", well, that was too fast."
Handwriting,33tha8,Fade_0,2,Sat Apr 25 13:49:17 2015 UTC,"Hmm, if you're going to be writing small like that, perhaps a pen with a thinner tip may be a worthwhile investment.  It could really help to add some distinction on letters such as ""e, or p"" and some others where the loops are so close to other parts of the letter that they look solid.  Quite a few letters are incomplete.  Character spacing is decent, especially for writing so small.  So a thin tipped pen and slightly more time spent completing certain characters is about all I can offer."

That said, it looks like you are on the right track. There's several good things to say about it: it's pretty consistent, very legible, the spacing is nice, and the slant is good. The only thing I would say to work on is making it look less forced, which will come with time. What I mean by that is the letters don't flow together very much.

Handwriting,339x8d,Fade_0,1 point,Sat Apr 25 13:22:24 2015 UTC,"Your handwriting is quite small so that my be affecting your letter form. Its still eligible but perhaps taking more time and more fluid strokes will make everything nicer.   I'm not too sure since me handwriting isn't great but perhaps bigger and wider can help you. Also you have a fountain pen , perhaps try cursive when you have time to practice and think more about how the letters are formed  I think on a website loops and tails have some nice worksheets with individual letters to practise one.  BTW, I'm planning on buying the pilot metropolitan, but I am unsure if the fine is too fine and is it smooth?"
Handwriting,339x8d,nofun123,1 point,Sun Apr 26 14:04:06 2015 UTC,"The Fine is close to a EF on western pens. It runs smooth enough to be written with, but its nip does dig into RHodia paper and is sort of scratchy. I don't personally see it as all that much of a problem for me, but people with larger writing will have issues with it. Also depends on paper/ink - not sure if Diamine writes wet or dry.  Personally it's a solid 8/10 pen for me, but it still needs to be smoother and wetter.   Thanks for the advice, I'll try writing slightly larger but the dig-into-paper of the Metro might make it somewhat hard. I'll still try though.  Check your post history, you use Vision Elites? I used the .5 BLX's before switching over to the Metro. Great pens, loved them before I got the Metro (which isn't nearly as smooth btw for comparison)."

I decided to get some ink, then some paper to use it with, then finally decided to get a pen in case the Parker actually didn't work. Slippery slope.   I ended up sticking to fp's because I loved the ink color, the scratchiness (the Visions were sometimes too slick), and the look of the Metro. Also because the nib looks dope asf. I still carry my blue-black BLX with me every day in case I run out ink or have to use cheap paper or something."

If you prefer, you can de-loop letters with descenders (e.g. g and y) and lift the pen after those letters. If you prefer to loop them, keeping the downstrokes straight will help.

Especially if they like your style of writing. I went more towards the calligraphy side of writing, but it all depends on what the couple wants. It took me a solid 30-40 hours worth of work to finish all of mine. Some words of advice for your possible future endeavor:   Get a printed list of the addresses (I had a hard time reading some of the names and addresses) Time yourself writing a few addresses and find a rough estimate of how long it'll take you Make sure you get those envelopes in early enough to give yourself plenty of time to finish them (I stayed up until about 2 am a few times trying to get them finished) Ask for extra envelopes. This is so you can see how the ink reacts to the envelope and in case you mess a few up (I messed quite few up unfortunately)   Hopefully, this will help you out a bit. I'm not trying to discourage you from attempting it, but wanted you to know what you're getting into. Let me know if there's anything else I could help you out with on this. Also ask around at /r/calligraphy to get some advice from some others that have done this sort of thing. Good luck!"

And one of those people are the ones that asked. So, I've actually written out thousands of envelopes for his realty company, just not for a wedding. So, I've got my timing and system down, but, I do need to be more careful with penmanship, ink, and paper. I've never met these people, and I don't want them to be disappointed. I told them I would do it for free (as a gift) but they sent a $200 check with my friend as a bribe (I think).  I just don't want to wreck someone's special day."
Handwriting,32tnu6,LuneMoth,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:30:28 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't think of it as a bribe. Sure, someone offering to do something for free is an awesome thing but, other people just feel more comfortable paying them for their time and effort and skills. Besides, after the quick search I just did on prices with professional calligraphers, $200 is a freaking steal.   You should have a little more confidence in yourself. These people have seen your handwriting and they enjoy it enough to want it on their wedding invitations. They aren't going into this blind. They've already seen what you can do. And who cares if the person receiving doesn't like it? There's always going to be someone that doesn't like a thing. My dad has a saying that's always stuck with me, ""If everyone liked the same thing, there wouldn't be enough of it."". Meaning, not everyone is going to like the same thing. Not everyone is going to like your handwriting aka ""the font Bill & Lisa used on their invitations"". But, like I said, who cares? It's not their wedding, it's not their choice. The only people it really matters to are the bride and groom, and they've already seen what you can do and are willing to pay you for it.  I found this while looking into pricing, thought it might be useful to you should you decide to do it."

Handwriting,32unxt,devlincaster,3,Thu Apr 16 23:44:21 2015 UTC,This. Only ever use cursive if you're writing several English essays in a row and the marks are basically coming from your length (I.e. more pages = more info = more marks).  All other subject tests should have enough time for you to print slowly and still finish. Hehe marks come from planning and being concise anyway. Better to print slowly and not have to cross out things than write fast and have too much time at the end.

Handwriting,32sa7h,Moochi,3,Thu Apr 16 08:40:50 2015 UTC,I honestly don't think the second line is that much better than the first.  Both look like you're in a hurry when you write. It's gonna take time but you need to practice writing single letters over and over and over. And do it slowly. Your letters vary a lot in size. Small letters should be roughly the same size and same with capital letters. Also you're not writing on the line. Some letters are floating above the line and some are below.   So some individual letter suggestions - some of your i's are just two small dots. Make it larger. Actually a lot of your letters are very small . It's very hard to write that small and making them look nice.

That was extremely hard because I liked to write ""i's"" and ""t's"" in lower case.  Once I was able to do that consistently, I worked on having a uniform height to my letters. Such that the tops were well aligned.  Finally, I am still working on having sharp orthogonal lines to my letters. I have a natural habit from cursive to never lift my pen, which looks bad when writing in caps.   Ultimately caps is slower for me, but I make the effort because I enjoy how it looks and it matches my mental image of my handwriting."

Handwriting,32ivp4,rrcasao,12,Wed Apr 15 03:00:41 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing, partly based on the handwriting and partly based on the picture, that you're an artist. I personally think the style is nice... it's clear that you are spending time on it. The issue is what others have said, though... If you're going to use the guidelines on the paper, use them properly. By purposefully 'drawing outside the lines', you are throwing away hundreds of years of experience in typesetting.  Consider that serif fonts are used for body text because the serifs (when looked at as an entire line) form a sort of pseudo line or hint that helps the eye move along as you read. Using serif fonts AND greater line spacing makes it even easier to read, though you obviously can't fit the text in the same amount of pages. The common line spacing that you see in books has been arrived at over time because that's what works best for most people.  So while we may not write in serifs on paper, the lines are effectively giving the same hint to the reader. In your case, you are putting yourself into your handwriting, and you have decided on the artistic flair of letting the lines overlap. It's original, and I could totally see if being a useful technique in a comic book (not all of the time though), but when you're talking about school work, you need to strive for readability.  Remember, school work is more about communicating your thoughts to your teacher, rather than artistic expression. I know, it sucks, but it's the truth. Unless you're in a Montessori school or something, your teachers don't want you to express yourself this way because it makes their job harder. For me personally, I went through a phase like this, and when I stopped thinking ""this is so stifling"" and just looked at it as a challenge to communicate more effectively, I found that I poured my artistic mind into other areas. I spent more time on wording especially, and also less traditional thinking. In the end, I was MORE happy with my work because it felt more original AND it communicated my thoughts properly. It's possible you'll find the same in your case.  Whatever you do, don't lose this style. I think it's interesting, it's just that schoolwork isn't the correct venue. :)"

You want to get a good range of motion but have your arm supported so it doesn't take you too much effort to support your arm. Otherwise you'll tense up and things get messy.

Don't worry about fluidity, but be aware that a signature that doesn't have multiple lines (e.g. the Raza above the Rehman) is much more practical  Once you've got one or two you like, add some flair with curles and swooshes or an underline to each and then pick one to practice.

Because I am a lefty I hold the pen upside down so the nib it down onto the paper, and then at a 45 degree angle for better  leverage on the brushing style. Remember that hobbiton brush was made to ancient, and written with feather quill, so look at some fonts and google 'there and back again' to get a few images of Bilbo's handwriting and go off from there.

First we learned printing, then the down-and-flick printing to prepare us to join it all together, then at 7-8 we were writing full cursive. Not always pretty, but still joined. At least in my school people who still wrote in print at 10+ year old had the piss taken out of them, and I wasn't at a posh school by any stretch of the imagination.  The complete takeover of computers and handheld devices for even the most minor notes and work related things has turned my handwriting to dogshit, but it's still joined up and I still instinctively associate printed handwriting with that of a very young child."

IIRC, we started printing at age five and handwriting at age seven.  All assignments had to be completed by hand and your writing was criticized if it wasn't neat.  Things have changed, though.  These days, it's all about making the children take standardized tests to ""prove"" that the school is doing a good job.  I worked a year as a substitute teacher and the children were constantly drilled on math and English.  To be fair, what they learned was good.  But there was no history, geography, art, music, or any of those things that children should learn.  When I was young, we spent one year learning California history (I grew up in California) and we took field trips to the missions and other historical sites.  It was so wonderful and so much fun.  Today, kids are just drilled on what is going to be tested.  I think it is very sad.  As for Queen Victoria, it sure looks like she was writing on top of a ruler."

The first year of school was just print handwriting, but then they started teaching it (same way they taught print, with exercise books etc) and by year 3 it was basically required to write in cursive. Kind of like, you can choose if you do it or not, but you should stick with cursive. Some older teachers in my secondary school even went so far as to tell me they'd much prefer if I didn't write in print. Over the years, it has died down a bit (most people I graduated with didn't write cursive), but kids (I have young cousins) still have to learn cursive. To this day, I can still kind of write it, but it's messy, haha."

My Norwegian is not particularly good, but it seemed like fun. I guessed ""gråblå"" to mean gray-blue, or grayish - something like that - given that grå = gray and blå = blue. I get the feeling that theres certainly some figurative language I missed in translation. There were various other educated guesses that I'm not terribly sure about.  Edit2: I actually gave up on the word ""klodernes"" and asked a friend. He claims its not even Norwegian, so I guess it's a word that has fallen to the wayside since 1893? He said it could be globe or sphere if it was anything like Danish...  .  I gaze at heaven high,  I see the gray-blue clouds,  I see the blood-red sun.  .  This is how the world is,  Because this sphere is home.  .  A raindrop!  .  I see the lordly manor,  I see it's thousand windows,  I see its lofty steeple.  .  This is how the Earth is,  Because its home to Man.  .  The gray-blue clouds blot out the sun.  .  I see the well-dressed lord,  I see his smiling lady,  I see their sweating horses,  .  Where the gray-blue clouds do cry.  .  My own rather rushed handwritten version  So how'd I do?"
Handwriting,31v3rw,GFKnowsFirstAcctName,2,Wed Apr 8 14:19:05 2015 UTC,"It seems like a mostly accurate translation! This is absolutely anything like Danish, as modern written Norwegian has gradually drifted away from written Danish since 1814 or so (not that the two languages weren't actually different back then ... it's a long story). You missed a couple of plurals (herrerne - the gentlemen, damer - ladies, etc.) and confused a few words (skyene blir tunge - the clouds become heavy) but then again, this is rather different from the modern Norwegian you've probably studied before!  PS. I left out the final few lines of the poem, as I ran out of space:  Jeg ser, jeg ser . . . . Jeg er vist kommet på en feil klode! Her er så underligt . . . ."
Handwriting,31v3rw,GFKnowsFirstAcctName,2,Wed Apr 8 15:16:57 2015 UTC,"Cool beans! Most of my understanding of Norwegian came from conversational use with a 2nd generation immigrant to the US with whom I haven't spoken in a year or so. I can hear and understand at a decent level (it honestly sounds a lot like English - Germanic/Nordic root languages are the best), but my speaking accent, and ability to read/write it are dreadful. My friend used to joke that I spoke Norwegian like I was trying to speak Swedish with a Spanish accent. It isn't pretty.  Edit: There were some things I intentionally warped the translation of. I changed the first and last lines in order to achieve a loose rhyme that would just barely stick around in the reader's head long enough to resonate. And in the original I think the  horses are tired, not sweating, but sweating seemed to work better.  Edit2: Yeah - the one thing I always struggled with regardless of format in Norwegian was spotting plurals. I can handle numbers (especially thousand - thanks to the phrase ""tusende takk"" :P), but nonspecified plurals were always a bear.  Edit3: Apologies for the insane quantity of edits. I did this before my morning kaffe. The other one I intentionally mistranslated (I think?) was ""blodige"" -> ""blood-red"". Pretty sure that one just translates to bloody. However, in English, blood-red sounds far less stilted, and has the bonus of mirroring the hyphenated format of ""gray-blue""."

It's kind of an art, writing; to look interesting and attractive in itself, but also to portray some of the inner being of the artist.  It's not just making letters well, though that's how it's done; it's about creating an expression for yourself that shows understanding and discipline.   I've advised others on this subreddit about finding the center of your body from which all movements come; then understand your neck and shoulders, and how they go about 'hanging' your arms, wrists, and hands; then you want to kind of ""dance"" big movements with your arm, writing huge letters on air, and gradually pull it down to miniscule expressions on the page.    Sound like a lot of work?  Yeah, I guess.  I'd think it wouldn't be long though, before you felt rather different about writing; and your writing would look different too.  Bigger, for sure, no matter what else happened.  Also, a lot of people have already studied this kind of thing, and their ideas are not bad.  So I look at other people's writing and see if there's something good I can borrow; it's never going to come out exactly as they do it anyway, so it's not stealing.  ""Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery"".  Almost all of this advice is equally applied to music, incidentally.  Writing is rather close to being a performing art.  In my opinion, anyway.

In fact, mine was so bad that I had to have occupational therapy to fix it because it was affecting my school work. I spent about two years as a high schooler learning to write without my hand exploding in agony.   Yes, posture is important. Sitting up straight and not curling your wrist around the page prevents pain and helps keep your hand steady.   Additionally, try practicing with a .5mm mechanical pencil for a while. Write slowly, and make really large letters until you can start making things smaller.   Hope that helps a bit."
Handwriting,31lahj,FlyingChange,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:46:37 2015 UTC,"Late reply I know, but growing up I would hunch over a lot since I was a lefty. It definitely affects the shape - for me it caused me to curl my hand down so I could see what I was writing and that leads to some awkward angles and a bit of wrist pain. I did a lot of art in high school and drawing/sketching really helped me get rid of this problem. If you're interested in trying something like that, get a sketchbook and just sketch large stuff a lot, it will help develop a more natural grip when you're using your whole arm to draw long straight lines and more importantly get you in the habit of leaning back (you do this so you can easily switch from looking at your paper to the object without moving your head much). Hope that helps a bit and good luck!"

My EDC bag has about 2 dozen pens crammed into a pocket, most of them are various colors of these:   Papermate Flair, Ultra Fine - for nice tight crisp lines. They take a good amount of pressure to get the ink flowing, but the felt tip is nearly indestructible and the ink never runs out.  Papermate Flair, Medium - for big fat bold lines. They're cheap and ubiquitous, good for everyday coarse writing but also great for blocking color into lineart or a quick side note on a page. Also, lots of colors!  Sharpie Pen, Fine Point - for lineart these have better ink flow than the Papermate Ultra Fine, but the felt tips squish and they can sometimes bleed.   And mechanical pencils, because precision!   Alvin Draft-Matic - in 0.9, 0.5 and 0.3mm sizes because why not? good old clicky eraser - because those little mechanical erasers are the worst.   I was a Zebra pencil user for the longest time, but the Draft-Matics' balance is just perfect and the knurled metal is nice and grippy.

Handwriting,30z1b3,Oncotic,2,Tue Mar 31 23:02:26 2015 UTC,"I have a handwriting much like yours, which tends to do the same things if I am not thinking about it. Consistency is always very difficult to work on if you don't significantly try to change the way you write.  I say experiment with your handwriting. Try slanting it a bit like this and placing the letters closer together. Try and copy handwriting that you think is neat. See how they write it. Try and match the rhythm in which they write. I find that if I stick the letters closer together, it is easier for me to maintain consistency in letter sizes because the letters are often right next to each other very close.  Most of all you need to practice. There's no quick fix to making your hand write well. It requires building muscle memory, and that takes a lot of time and focus to achieve."
Handwriting,30z1b3,deltadeep,2,Wed Apr 1 03:00:32 2015 UTC,"It's pretty simple: write as slowly as you need to in order to make the letters perfect. This will be very, very, very slow. Speed up only when your letters can remain perfect, or maybe 98% perfect. Perfect means: each lowercase letter is the same size, each uppercase letter is the same size, all letters are evenly spaced, all loops are nicely rounded, everything that should touch the baseline actually does touch it, every downstroke has the same angle. Et cetera. Really, just focus on writing absolutely perfect letters no matter how long it takes you, for at least 20 minutes a day (two 10 minute sessions is good)."

Handwriting,30uhqc,WhereverSheGoes,10,Tue Mar 31 02:43:04 2015 UTC,"I started teaching myself cursive and modern calligraphy in October. In January I started making my friend's wedding invitations. Two things I've learnt: however long you think it's going to take you, double it; and buy 20% more supplies than you think you'll need. Mistakes will happen!  I bought a couple of calligraphy books, read a ton of stuff online (there are SO many resources out there) and practiced a good 20 hours a week, maybe more.    For the cursive in particular, I did a lot of googling and learnt to differentiate the different styles of cursive (Wikipedia is pretty good at explaining this). I found the style that I liked the best and bought children's handwriting books from Amazon/eBay. I felt silly at first, but it's a great way to learn. I also found lots of free practice sheets online - Google things like ""teacher handouts handwriting practice"". Pinterest is a goldmine for worksheets too.   There's no getting round the practice though. Every time you pick up a pen, write in cursive, no matter how crappy it is to begin with. I also did a lot of practice just sitting in front of the TV, jotting down words and phrases from whatever we were watching (the practice sheets from when I was watching American horror story are pretty weird!) hope that's useful. Good luck!  EDIT: here's my two latest projects, one cursive handwriting, one modern calligraphy. My handwriting was a little more rounded than yours when I started but otherwise pretty similar. It's taken me about 5 months to get to here:  http://imgur.com/rBAI8mZ http://imgur.com/BsSCV3T"

For cursive I use uniball micro deluxe pens - they write very smoothly and are nice and fine. Berol do a range of handwriting pens that we were given at primary school to learn to write (in the UK) they're very easy to learn with, if a bit thick for my liking.   For calligraphy, I'd recommend a straight pen holder (left handers actually have an advantage over right handers when it comes to copperplate/modern calligraphy because of the steep angle it's written at) I'd start with a Nikko G nib and some Higgins eternal ink. As someone mentioned below, molly suber thorpe's modern calligraphy book is a very good place to start and recommends and explains everything you need. I'd also agree with the comment that modern calligraphy is easier to master in a shorter period of time than cursive. It's contemporary/slightly messy features are more forgiving of any mistake, and allows your personal style to show through."

Handwriting,30sp4y,Hypercake,8,Mon Mar 30 11:37:13 2015 UTC,"Others talked about the benefits of a fountain pen over a ballpoint.  Here's a quick summary of what you get at different price points.  I'm a cheap fountain pen aficionado.  Fountain pens are sort of like stereo equipment:  log(cost) is loosely related to quality, but individual variation among lines is greater than the bulk trend.  Really cheap stuff tends to be poorly made because of all the cost engineering that goes into the process -- but then, there are some great writers to be had in the Jinhao or Hero lines, if you know which one to try.  Products in the $20-$30 range tend to be optimized for one aspect of the pen -- for example, Nemosine's Singularity ($20) has a fabulous nib and feed, but the body is inexpensively made of fragile plastic.  So they're great to write with, but aren't particularly tough.  Lamy's Safari ($25), and Al-Star ($35) lines have interchangeable nibs and tough bodies -- but at least the Safari and Al-Star don't seal well, so they tend to run dry in some climates, especially for intermittent use, and their nibs are passable rather than great.  Kaweco's Sport line ($20-$30) has great nibs, good feeds, and a nice seal (so they don't run dry), but they're little tiny pens that some people like and some don't.  Hero, Jinhao, and Baoer are Chinese companies that charge $4-$10 for their low-end pens, and they're hit-or-miss: the designs are innovative and interesting, but the quality control isn't so hot so you may end up having to tweak your pen.  Most of these pens are designed to last a few years but not necessarily a lifetime.  In the $100 range you start to get pens that don't have any major design compromises in them.  These are pens that are hand-tested at the factory and individually tuned, so they write very well out of the box, with no major design drawbacks.  These are pens like the Pilot ""Vanishing Point""  (a click-to-write ballpoint), Sailor's ""1911"", or the Parker Sonnet (more conventional cap-and-pen designs).  These pens are meant to last multiple lifetimes, and easily can (with just a small amount of maintenance).  Above that price point you're into hand-crafted pens (e.g. Edison Pens) or status items that aren't necessarily better writers, but offer some blingy cachet.  A good fountain pen will ""just write"" and require minimal (but non-zero) maintenance.  Good ""starter pens"" that write well but won't break your wallet include the Kaweco Sport, the Pilot Metropolitan, the Nemosine Singularity, and the ever-popular Lamy Safari.  These pens tend to just write as delivered.  The cheaper pens (like the Baoer 388, a $6 ripoff of the Parker Sonnet) may deliver good performance, but may suck coming out of the box, so if you're not willing to tinker you should stick to the $20 range pens."

Handwriting,30sp4y,IllegalMonk,2,Sun Apr 19 05:19:46 2015 UTC,"So, now that I know more about pens, any ink recommendations? I'm planning to get a Pilot Metropolitan soon."
Handwriting,30sp4y,drzowie,2,Tue Mar 31 08:36:16 2015 UTC,"Cartridge inks are most convenient -- you just slap a little ampoule into the pen and write till it's empty, then put another one in.  But there is limited selection, and it's an expensive way to buy ink.  Bottled inks are cheaper and come with more variety.  To use a bottled ink you lower the nib and feed of the pen into the ink and draw ink up through it like through a straw.  To do that you need a pen designed for it, or a cartridge pen (like the Metropolitan) with a converter -- a cartridge-like reservoir that can suck up ink.   Converters come in several forms.  The one for the Metropolitan is a squeezy sac made of silicone rubber, with a metal brace around it.  You plug it in like a cartridge, then squeeze it like a regular squeeze bulb.  When you release the sac, it sucks stuff (air or ink) up through the feed.  Then you screw the body back together.  I do that to my Metropolitan maybe once every week or two, but then I don't write more than a couple of pages a day.  I use Noodler's Bulletproof Black in my Pilot Metropolitan.  It works best when diluted 1:1 with water, which means you're basically getting twice as much ink as you think.  A $13 bottle of NBB will last you through a year or two of note-taking.  (I also keep some of their Black Swan In Australian Roses loaded in a different pen, for letter writing).    There are a Hell of a lot of inks out there.  Noodler's is my favorite brand because the guy who hand-formulates the inks (Nathan Tardiff) optimizes different types for different applications.  Most fountain pen ink you'll find out there doesn't actually stain the paper -- it can wash off with water.  Noodler's ""bulletproof"" line reacts chemically with the paper to stain it permanently even though the ink itself is water-based.  Their ""bad"" line is even more permanent (it's impervious to laser attack).  Their ""Baystate"" line is probably the most vibrant ink you will ever encounter, and it can stain practically anything.  They also have antifreeze inks, indicator inks, invisible inks, highlighter inks, etc.  The downside of Noodler's inks is that they often require a little dilution or tweaking to work well in particular pens.  They tend to run a bit ""wet"", and some are rather ill-behaved.  (The Baystate line is notorious for ""feathering"" -- spreading through the paper -- although you can tame it by diluting it).  Other lines include Diamine, from England, and Iroshizuku, from Japan.  Both offer vibrant colors in a wide variety, and have more uniform characteristics than the Noodler's stuff.  But they are water-washable, which I don't like one bit -- if I take the trouble to handwrite something with a fountain pen, I want it to be permanent.  You'll want to play with different colors, brands, and formulations of ink, so it's worth it to try ink samples from some of the online vendors.  A bottle will typically give you a year's supply of ink (two years', if you dilute) for $13-$15.  Many of the pen stores will sell you ink samples for $1-$2 each, with enough for a couple of pen fills.  That's an expensive way to buy ink for the long haul, but a good way to find stuff you like without blowing $100 on ink."

Handwriting,30sp4y,Lereas,5,Mon Mar 30 13:11:31 2015 UTC,"Fountain pens let you have a much wider array of ink choices as well as nib thicknesses, so that is one difference.  Also, they just feel different when you are writing...with ballpoints you kinda have to press down, while with a fountain pen they tend to glide over the paper more. This let's your hand be more relaxed and you can write more and longer.  Finally, writing with a 'nice' pen can let you take it slower and more carefully than you may otherwise, but that part depends on the person"

They really do write marginally better, and you do get your choice of inks. Does it write 100 times better? No. Do you get more inks? Maybe, but does it matter? Not really. Does it have the same effect as owning a Mercedes? Yes.   Edit: I fucking love fountain pens though, don't get me wrong.

Ebay, pen shows, or specific pen dealers/nibmieisters trade in these sorts of things.  —However, if you want to just fool around for a bit first, go to your local art store and buy some dip nibs and try them out. Dip nibs suck a lot compared to a quality 100 year old Gold nibbed pen that has been restored, but you can get an idea.  You can also try getting a Noodlers Ahab, which is a modern, steel flex pen. Some people like them, I think they're pretty crappy. You just can't pay 20 or 30 bucks and expect the quality to be there.  Good luck!"
Handwriting,30me0d,besthuman,2,Sat Mar 28 20:11:43 2015 UTC,Dip nibs are more flexible than fountain pens. Don't buy a pen just for the sik flex!111!!!1 because you'll destroy it.
Handwriting,30me0d,applicat,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:41:29 2015 UTC,"This is true. However, there are some fountain pens that can get pretty close without damage if used by a skilled hand. However those are rare, expensive and require skill. It also depends on what you want to write. Dip pens are a good start, but having a fountain pen to practice form with or use as a general writing tool is nice."

I do a lot of math so being able to write Greek letters is an important part of my handwriting. Will it just come naturally when I am used to this style of writing? I already know how to wtite greek letters (and to be honest they look better than my Roman letters because I learned them later in life and made an effort to figure them out properly), but I am concerned about writing letters like xi and zeta in this style."

You would benefit a lot from simply practicing perfect letterforms at a slow, patient pace for a while. Make all your lowercase letters the same height, use the same slope angle on all your downstrokes, carefully close each loop that should be closed, etc.  For what it's worth, in terms of making spot improvements, I have the hardest time reading your cursive ""r"", ""f"", and ""z."" For ""r"", they often look like un-dotted ""i""s - there is no actual boxy shaping to top like a normal cursive ""r"" should have. In ""the hour I first believed"" I would have no idea what ""hour"" said (""howl?"" ""hirui?"") unless I had the context, because the ""o"" is not closed on top and this ""r"" issue.  For your printed words, whats most odd and hard to read is that you switch to slanted, loopy cursive letters sometimes, for your lowercase ""t"" and ""l"" even when the rest of the letters are vertical and non-loopy.

They're slightly different inside, or the parallel is, so that it just doesn't fit the same.  You can also identify them because the real con-20 is a metal tube with a spot cut out, not a metal strip bent around the sac.  If you can get it in the pen and it doesn't feel like it's going to come out easily, that's good enough, but I have had to continue refilling old cartridges with a syringe (I have only one con-50, in another pen).

Handwriting,302s4d,Idiotechnicality,2,Tue Mar 24 00:24:36 2015 UTC,"This is beautiful. Beg pardon — I'm going to try to articulate something tricky and elusive and exciting to me. This will be a complicated endeavor for both of us, for at least two reasons: it's a very esoteric concept I'm trying to communicate, and I'm just fucking insane when it comes to crafting clauses in my communication.  Here we go.  This writing example, specifically — as opposed to [contrasting example indicating a universally ""perfect"" cursive wherein every letter and ligature is deployed identically every single time] — is exactly what (I believe) many of the much-more calculated ""lettering""-style / ""big-calligraphy""-style / ""sign-painting""-style / ""Coca-Cola-logo""-style attempts at clarity and consistency in text are striving to resemble. If those delicately, painstakingly-designed systems of consistent curves and spacing and weighting are any kind of ""visual metaphor"" for something else — which, they clearly are, duh — I think the specific writing style you're demonstrating here is much closer to the actual target of that metaphor than, say, [some general abstraction of 'textbook-perfect' cursive] would be.  I'm going to come at that again, now from a different direction.  So, I practice calligraphy. I can arrive at what looks like evidence that I have an impeccable natural ability to write ""perfectly"" at normal-handwriting-speed. The specific mechanism that facilitates success in these endeavors is simple: your brain instantly recognizes that this word was clearly written at normal-handwriting-speed... and, secondarily, strikingly, happens to be perfect. (Just to give you a concrete example, the same applies to — say — the handwriting in the Declaration of Independence.) This is an illusion, and operates on how deftly I deploy techniques like ""the stroke gets lighter where the pen must have been moving faster"" and ""the curve reflects a realistic deceleration, redirection, and acceleration of the pen,"" and so on. When I properly simulate these (and other) various context-clues that the human brain uses to judge the speed of the writing... well, naturally, the human brain completely misjudges the speed of the writing, and the effect is complete.  I totally made you think that I have impossibly-excellent handwriting. But, I don't.  That work of calligraphy is really more like a drawing, where the precipitating subject of the drawing is [some imagined, metaphorical, abstract concept of the ""perfect"" depiction of that word having already been written down] and, incidentally, the arbitrary style in which I have created this drawing is ""Resembles Effortless,"" in the same way the arbitrary style in which a forger signs a document is  ""Resembles Legitimate.""  Now. All of that was said with the intention of providing you with a very specific framing and context for the word ""resembles."" The specific way I mean the word ""resembles"" at the end of that previous paragraph... that is the actual point of the paragraph. I wrote the whole goddamned thing just to provide your brain for that context of the word ""resembles,"" because that's the ""resembles"" I'm using at the very beginning of this post, and again now:  I believe the thing that [lettering / sign-painting / Coca-Cola logo] is trying to resemble is your specific handwriting, as exemplified here — and not the abstraction of ""perfect, textbook"" cursive that it is so often imagined to be.  That's all.  I could go off on epic musings about the oh-so-many various validities of this philosophy versus the validities of alternative philosophies, validities and philosophies that all happen behind the scenes of oh-so-many various lettering and calligraphy deployments... but we have now gone through 3,500 characters of this, beaten a horse into a dead pulp, and all because I felt like I needed to provide you with context for why my instantaneous reaction to your post was ""hey, rad — it's rare to see an example of the real thing.""  (...of course, this is all predicated on the assumption that you actually did write this at-speed, and that you yourself aren't also employing calculated, ""artful"" deceptions, which — if that's the case — damn, well fucking played.)  tl;dr: this submission demonstrates a particularly useful point of reference for the original inspiration behind many lettering styles, which is easily-and-often misinterpreted by the artists learning those skills"

Handwriting,2zholi,simmiedude,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:29:58 2015 UTC,Righty here and can confirm that my handwriting indeed smudges with a pencil. This is why I use pens most of the time. Pens just flow better in my opinion and they look nicer. Pens are also more practical since rarely do I ever find pencils in stores and such on a daily basis. My handwriting changes depending on the size of the pen or pencil I am writing with though...

Never had a problem with English though.  Overall, I prefer pens. Most pencils annoy me because they wear down inconsistently. Every other sentence will look different because I will stop and rotate the pencil to a less-worn side of the lead."
Handwriting,2zholi,afparana,1 point,Thu Mar 19 03:50:10 2015 UTC,I'm an OT and handwriting support specialist. I like pencils for learning formation and developing motor control (helps place pressure) but as adults we tend to use pens for greater speed and fluidity- you may write more quickly and have less control due to the fact you're not needing to apply press to the paper when compared with a pencil-

Handwriting,2z7d5t,Ihavesiftedthistles,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:08:13 2015 UTC,"The Falcon is, as you said, probably the only ""modern"" pen which allows for Spencerian customisation. However, if you don't mind buying secondhand, a lot of early 1900s pens (say Waterman) will be able to write like this without any modification, starting at about $150-$200. This is a nice site which sells such pens, restored to working condition (I'm not related to the owner of the site in any way).   That aside, you do have beautiful writing. I hope the effort that goes into writing your essay like this pays off, grade wise.  Edit: After seeing your post at /r/fountainpens, I have a suggestion about ink and paper choice. To avoid feathering (the ""crawling"" of ink resulting in a furry appearance), you can change either the paper or the ink. The problem with Spencerian nibs is it's inherently scratchy to start with, and has a tendency to further dig into the paper when you work its flex magic, damaging the paper and allow ink to get into the deeper ""unpolished"" layers, aggravating feathering. You can either use better paper (Clairefontaine and Rhodia notebooks are both quite nice), or a different ink (Noodler's Black is excellent in this regard, even writing on shitty paper like newspaper with minimal feathering)."

Handwriting,2z7ugz,belgiangeneral,2,Mon Mar 16 09:55:30 2015 UTC,"As promised, some (sadly crappy) photos of my whiteboard work. (I've somehow never realised that the rooms are too dark to take decent photos.) I find a very rounded script works best. The hardest thing at first is keeping your lines straight, but it sounds like you're practising hard.  I also recommend (unlike my examples) to keep the lines short. I really should be dividing my board into three, instead of two. It means the tails of your sentence doesn't go everywhere. In the days of the blackboard, teachers used to rule lines up in pencil to keep things straight. You can see the lines but the students cannot.  Take the time to look at the board from the back of the room, they usually cannot see the bottom 1/4 - 1/3.  Go and get a marker ink refil pot like this. Whiteboard markers run out really fast otherwise.  Have you actually taught a class yet? I rarely get the time to focus on my board writing in the room due to the behaviour of students in one of my schools. In fact, the only time I can really focus on writing well is if I get to the room before the class starts. Even if a class is behaving well you need to write fast so you can keep an eye on your class. You just cannot keep your back turned away from them for long, either for behaviour or to answer questions.  In saying this, thank you for ensuring your board writing is legible. Students have commented that I am one of the few teachers with easily readable handwriting."

Yeah, it's not very easy to write in straight lines, and boardwork in general isn't very straightforward for a beginner, but I'm practising. Yep, I've taught about eight hours by now, and during those hours I really haven't been able to think about my boardwork because I'm focusing so much on classroom management and just being nervous in general.   The marker refill tip is fantastic, I didn't even know such a thing existed.   Thanks for providing pics of your handwriting; it looks very similar to my on-paper handwriting, but for some reason my board writing is way sloppier at the moment. But I'll be practising!"

Handwriting,2z6nca,Hydroxone,3,Mon Mar 16 01:15:53 2015 UTC,"Not a left-hander, but I've heard of a few things that people do:   If you don't care about line variation stuff, but have trouble with smudging, you could use a dry writing fountain pen and use an ink like Noodler's Bernanke Black. If you want line variation, you could either tilt the paper sideways (my geometry is a little fuzzy on this, but I think either direction should work), or even just a little bit clockwise since right-handers (including me when I'm writing with a flex pen) often turn their paper counterclockwise to get a good flexing angle. Backhand scripts (slanting the letters the opposite direction), while being atypical, can actually be quite beautiful. Again, though, you might have to use a quick-drying ink."

The steel nib in the Metro is flexible enough for SOME variation, but by no means a flex pen.  I personally write with the nib point facing right with the hand and paper at a 45 degree angle. Once I started doing things this way, I noticed a dramatic improvement. From there it is simply practice."

My writing has always been horrid, plus i really want to get into calligraphy. I've made a lot of progress so far, just by fixing the way i hold my pen. Its going to take time i know. Me and my gf had a spiral and we were just writing back and forth to each other for a few hours last night which was fun. We also copied a few styles from this subreddit, in an attempt to get an idea of style and flow. We discovered she needs a lot more practice than i haha. She holds then pen completely wrong and at to high of an angle, had her fix it and it immediately improved her writing. But she's having trouble remembering sometimes. Its not easy you have to force yourself to look at how you're holding it anytime you need to write something but that's how you get used too it."

Handwriting,2yo3n8,CelestinaMello,6,Wed Mar 11 11:58:06 2015 UTC,"I think this is an important reminder that people across all ages have had a range of handwriting ability. We often associate the generations before us with excellent handwriting, when this is simply not the case for all people in all walks of life. It's much harder to escape that mythos that filters how we view and assume about writers of the past, because often the best preserved works that we can reference often have the neatest handwriting. Or which were preserved for sentimental value, and had much more time and effort placed into them.   I think it's important for everyone here who seeks to improve their hand to remember that most people never had particularly nice handwriting. It's an art evolved of many hours of practice and hard work. The two most important things are that it's legible, and you like how it looks, and feel comfortable writing things down and showing people what you've written. Everything after that is a matter of perfecting the skills that you have and pushing what boundaries you can find.   Maybe it's been said to death before on a number of different posts, but I feel it's an important point to remember."

Prisoners will hit you up for cash and favors.  They will also angle for you to help them when they get out - they will want to stay at your place.  And they already have your address.  Further, they share all this information with prison friends.  So if you let one convict into your place, you will end up with a string of them.  Expect your stuff to go missing and possible identity theft.  They'll also bring drugs into it.  I know I sound like a jerk, but it's best not to get involved.

To start you have to find a style you like and look for a stroke chart, a guide that shows you the order and direction of the strokes, the mosre common styles have more charts available, and after that its just a matter of practicong.  This particular style wouldnt be suited for a pencil, since you need the flat point (italic) to create the line variation seen here, you could start with something like spencerian script if you fancy style like that, it helps you understand cursive flow better, or if you like this style better you could get a calligraphy pen or a fountain pen with an italic nib, goth and foundational are great style to improve your understanding of the shape and proportions of letters,  also they look great and make for awesome birthday cards.

If you want to be super strict about not combining style you could always just google ""script chart"" and youll see a bunch that you can pick and practice. The good thing about starting with something like foundational or palmer is that you get to understand proportions and the way a certain character is drawn, so when you see a variation on that style you can understand how its drawn, the stroke order and so, so you dont have to find a stroke chart for every one of them.

However, there are fountain pens with ""flex nibs"", which offer some line variation while also being portable. The reason that I put ""flex nibs"" in quotes is because they aren't really comparable to the line variation that you're going to get from a dip nib for a much lesser price. Additionally, a fountain pen doesn't give you the advantage that an oblique holder does. The good part about this is that a decent flex nib and oblique holder and ink are going to run you less than a decent flex pen.    That said, if you really want the advantage of a flex nib, I'd recommend getting one from Desiderata if you're willing to spend a bit more money, or a Noodler's Ahab if you're not.

In some of your л's, the beginning hook (where you go slightly down before going up to the top of the letter) is completely missing. It should ALWAYS be there for legibility purposes.

Handwriting,2xvld2,deltadeep,1 point,Wed Mar 4 15:40:10 2015 UTC,"Stop writing like you normally do, and start writing slowly, and really seeing at what you're doing as it hits the page. You're probably writing with all your focus on what you're saying and just trying to the get the text to keep up with your internal dialog. Don't do it that way. Go into practice mode and write the same sentence or paragraph over and over. Look at what you're doing. Fix it when it looks wrong. Beyond that, there are plenty of specifics (make all letters with equal height and spacing and slant, make each part of the letter appropriately and carefully curved or sharp, etc)"

Handwriting,2xvz57,deltadeep,1 point,Wed Mar 4 17:02:22 2015 UTC,"Would I be correct in assuming that you tend to hold the pencil very close to the tip? (just a guess from the strokes in your writing). Either way, I would try holding your pen/pencil further up a tad. If you are using pencil a lot, I highly suggest getting a mechanical and put some 2B lead into it (it is softer and darker so you would need much less pressure for the graphite to get onto the paper).  If you do indeed hold the pencil very tightly and close to the tip, I assume you usually rest your wrist on the paper as you write? I am frustratingly working at reversing this bad habit from my own writing. It is difficult to undo habit, but it is worth it.  So, I would try a few things: -hold the pen/pencil slightly higher up. -use a triangle grip, but a very light one. Be extra loose with your grip to practice this, but your hand should really not be tensed up. -I have also found that writing slightly bigger (I also tend to naturally write quite small) really helps in improving ones writing.  Lastly, as is always suggested :) write slowly and focus on the letters. That will switch you from the instinct/habit of writing in your normal style/posture to really focusing on your letters, just as you would do for a drawing or sketch.  I'm no handwriting expert, but those are just some tips that I have seen help my own handwriting in my recent journey towards improvement."

Handwriting,2xkpxo,g3t0nmyl3v3l,29,Sun Mar 1 17:17:00 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised you are getting complaints about your handwriting as this is pretty good, I think, but could be improved of course.  A few observations:   There is almost no difference in form betwen your ""v"" and your ""n,"" and your ""m"" and your ""w."" Work on making your ""n"" and ""m"" a rounded top hump and make your ""v"" and ""w"" a rounded (or sharp) dip. In general, I think legibility is improved by eliminating loops on ascenders of letters like ""d"", ""l"", ""t"", etc - go straight up and come straight back down over the line instead of looping. Same with the descender in letters like ""p."" And don't loop the right side of your lowercase ""a"" - just make it a straight line. You already do this in some letters here and not in others - be consistent. Also related: it can improve legibility to not loop at all on the descender for letters like ""g"" and ""y"" - just drop the descender, add a little curve, and then lift the pen to start the next letter back up above the baseline. Basically: avoid loops as much as possible except when they are core to the letter (like a lowercase ""f"" which requires the looping as part of its basic shape) Your ascenders go too high and hit the letters above them. Look at ""h"" in ""handwriting."" Try to keep the max height of your letters a bit below the top line so they interfere less with the prior line. The tops of your ""a"" and ""g"" are not closed. When there is a gap on the top of those letters, they become confusing. The eye as it reads text scans the top of the letters and gathers a lot of information from them - make them correctly. This is also why its important for ""m"" to be formed well with nice rounded humps, because it can easily end up looking like many other letters. The hole in the center of letters like ""e"" and ""a"" and so on is called the ""counter."" Your counters are rather small and could sometimes be confused for loops (sometimes a lowercase ""e"" looks like a messy looped ""i"" - see the e in ""based"" in your example). In general, larger, well-formed counters is a big boost to legibility. As others have said, your slope is a bit extreme. You could write more vertically, or you could introduce more spacing between your letters to compensate, but that will make your words quite wide. Try to avoid slashing through your counters as you connect to the next letter. For example, the ""p"" in ""tips"" - you cut straight through the counter to connect to the ""s"". Connect from the bottom or top of the counter only, not through the counter. Write very slowly for a while, with immaculate attention to legibility. Speed up only when you can do so without compromising. IMO this is actually the single most important thing, and most people skip it because they are impatient. Only the combo of patience and practice will lead to results."

I don't think the following terms are typically applied to handwriting -- they're for typefaces -- but I'm not sure how to communicate what I wish to say otherwise.  What would greatly increase your legibility is a higher x-height compared to your caps-height and ascenders. x-height. That part is really the 'meat' of the letter, what distinguishes it from the next, so keeping it larger, both in size and in relation to the surrounding letters, will really help legibility.

Also, either slant all your letters or none at all (Slanting makes it more attractive). What I do to improve is I usually spend an hour or two each day writing out the alphabet, capitals and lowercase over and over until I like the way it looks. Once I have the alphabet down, only then do I start writing words, and eventually sentences.  Also, I don't know what you used to write this with but it looks to be a little thick so you can't see your loops on your l's, f's and h's so try using a finer pointed pen."

Handwriting,2x91hh,PointAndClick,9,Thu Feb 26 22:19:03 2015 UTC,"I studied handwriting analysis for 2 years in college, here is my interpretation:  1) From the exaggerated loops on the letters such as M and N, we can clearly tell this is female handwriting (as opposed to the more masculine sharp versions of the letters).  2) The handwriting isn't all that neat, and there is a visible mistake 7 lines down (the writer forgot to capitalize the first letter of the title). This indicates that sender is not very concerned with perfection, perhaps showing an internal feeling of adequacy, from some sort of high level of achievement.  3) The use of underlining for emphasis is a characteristically British trait (while seen in other countries, most cultures have their own unique way of emphasizing words). This is not the strongest correlation, but it does help guide analysis.  4) The lowercase f's are a dead giveaway for a pretty tight age range, around 20-25 years old. This is because, back in the 90's, many European countries decided to switch the difficult and unusual cursive 'f' out for the block letter variant when teaching script in schools. This change stood for a few years until the most recent graduates began entering the workforce, where employers complained about the new and unfamiliar 'f's, and the change was reverted. There's actually a pretty interesting story to that whole thing, if you want to read: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursive_F   But in summary, I'd say the person who wrote this is a woman, possibly famous, from Northern Europe, and in her early twenties.

Slowing down forces you to put conscious effort into the details of the letters--to make decisions about how tall, slanted, loopy, or angular you want each feature to be. Practice these features and make them CONSISTENT. Good handwriting is consistent and legible. The rest of the styling is totally up to you.   Once you have that figured out, then you can work toward speeding up to regular speed.

Four fingers overhanded and with the paper tilted away from me so I'm practically writing upwards (still along the line of course). Right hand for power and grip, left hand for guidance and precision. I don't know but that's the best way I can put it. Extremely inefficient but I've happily made it work for me.  Edit : Album"

My favorite pen right now is the Pilot Custom Heritage 92. It retails in the US for $220 but you can order it from Japan for ~$120US. Fantastic pen.

Try picking some font that you like (sans-serif would be a good choice), then trying to copy it onto line paper. Take a few minutes, do this a few times, then post your results.

Handwriting,2wz9kh,diet_gingerale,4,Tue Feb 24 11:36:39 2015 UTC,"Sorry, yeah, pretty much what /u/orion24 said - your fingers should always be relaxed. If you see any whiteness at the tip of your index finger, or if the first knuckle is going concave, you're gripping too hard. Your fingers are there to support your pen and to hold it steady. Use your whole arm, from your back to your forearm (but not your wrist, really) to move the pen. And definitely start slow! I'm trying to rebuild my handwriting myself for pretty much the reason you listed - it used to really hurt my hand to write for a long time so I rushed through it and ended up with really messy looking writing. Good luck!"

Handwriting,2wz9kh,orion24,2,Tue Feb 24 15:37:35 2015 UTC,"Likely. A lot depends on your hand position, grip, etc. but the utensil plays a role too. Try to find a wet writing pen and using that for a bit. I personally get more pleasure out of writing with a fountain pen, but a good rollerball would help your finger pain as well. I like Pilot G2. Avoid ballpoints, as they require more pressure. Be aware of your hand position as well. Try to keep your fingers bent naturally over the pen, rather than scrunched up and over flexed. And as other commenters suggest, write with your arm and shoulder from a comfortable position relative to your writing surface."

Pay attention to the slant, letter height and spacing. If these are consistent your handwriting will look very neat.  The formation of letters also makes a difference when writing fast.

Handwriting,2wq9dv,lesserweevils,2,Sun Feb 22 04:10:03 2015 UTC,"How is your handwriting ""too solid""? Looks great to me.  Feathering depends on how much ink flows out of the pen, the quality of the paper and the ink itself. Very wet or broad nibs tend to feather more than a fine or extra-fine, for example. Less absorbent paper is resistant to feathering but also makes ink dry slower. Finally, some manufacturers make feather-resistant ink (e.g. Noodler's X-feather) as well as quick-drying ink.  I haven't had any feathering problems with fine/extra-fine nibs on cheap notebook paper. Minor bleedthrough, yes, but no feathering."

My suggestion for your cursive is to try for more consistency, and to work on some letters like your c's and t's. Also, your cursive looks like it's just letters where you accidentally didn't lift your pen to write the next letter, in other words, I don't think it has enough 'flow', if that makes sense. Here is a good place to get the gist of how to connect the letters. I really love how you wrote the word ""hate"" (I acknowledge the irony) so I think you can get there!"
Handwriting,2wjfes,Corpius,10,Fri Feb 20 11:57:05 2015 UTC,"Handwriting is situational. I think you get a pass for note-taking, and developing the ability to write quickly while others are talking will stand you in good stead in the workplace, too, even if nobody can read it except you!   I'll recommend that you take your notes however you need to during class, then during study time, re-write your notes, incorporating additional material from reading or other research. During the re-write, you can pay attention to your handwriting, plus you can add diagrams, color code, or whatever else will help you retain the information for later."
Handwriting,2wjfes,KimberlyInOhio,5,Fri Feb 20 15:33:16 2015 UTC,"I just want to tack on at the end with note taking..   Take your notes at whatever pace you need to in class, because that's important, and the very act of taking notes helps to solidify the information. If you have time after class, sit down with your notes and rewrite (as was said) them for organization and clarity. This helps to solidify the information even more. Use your notes to form study questions, etc. This will allow you to have the most effective study notes you can get. Additionally, learn to abbreviate. This is a hard one for me, since I feel like I'm bludgeoning the English language when I truncate everything, but it will tremendously improve the quality of notes because you can jam more notes into less time.  Of course, when you have time, make sure to look at those study questions I mentioned from before separate from the notes and answer them. Then check yourself from your notes. This is one of the main features of the cornell note-taking system, which even has a special format and layout for your note paper. It's so popular there are notebooks that have the layout already done for you. This type of studying from your notes will be invaluable and with frequent restudy can improve recollection of the material significantly. From around 1% recollection to 50%.

Handwriting,2w9mqc,looroll,1 point,Wed Feb 18 16:44:10 2015 UTC,"Apologies for the late reply. I don't think there's much you can do besides practice the sort of handwriting you'd like to end up with, be it cursive or print. Browsing this sub and the related subs are generally pretty helpful if you want something to base your style on. /r/fountainpens and /r/PenmanshipPorn are especially good for regular writing. Fountainpens has a lot of writing samples, and generally, the people there have lovely cursive. PenmanshipPorn has all sorts.  Find some poems, or quotes, or do the weekly-ish handwriting practice posts, which coincidentally have cursive templates that you may be able to use, and write them out. Speed may be a necessary sacrifice.  Here's the first one to contain the aforementioned template, along with some other advice.  If you'd rather just have a nicer print instead, I think generally, all you'd have to do is attempt to regulate the form of your letters. As in, giving them all similar heights and sizes. This may help, and you could copy them or something if you need to.  On a side note, what do you mean that it's painful? I'm a leftie too and I write the same way, but it doesn't particularly hurt to write any other way. It just feels odd.   Hope this helps!"
Handwriting,2w9mqc,looroll,2,Thu Feb 19 03:49:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the awesome reply!   I've been spending the day practicing my cursive and I may try and do a total transition from print to cursive. I also just went and bought a few different nice pens and dot paper notebooks.   Yes, If I don't write ""overhand"" I tend to get legitimate pain in the ball of my wrist after just a few words. I may bring it up to my physician next time I go."
Handwriting,2w9mqc,looroll,1 point,Thu Feb 19 05:01:58 2015 UTC,"That seems a wise course of action. Could be some sort of strain.   If you're interested in paper, I've heard that séyès paper is pretty good for maintaining regular script. It's also known as french-ruled, and is a little like graph paper, but for writing on. I believe there is a specific method to using it, but I'll have to get back to you on that. Link to a template, and a short explanation of the paper."

Handwriting,2w70s0,pacylap,1 point,Tue Feb 17 20:27:24 2015 UTC,Hi Pacylap ! To learn copperplate I would actually recommend 55° degrees slant lines. The size and number of the lines obviously depend on the nib you are using. ;) Please keep in mind though that Ductus doesn't support slant lines with nibs under 1 mm.
Handwriting,2w70s0,WhereverSheGoes,1 point,Tue Feb 17 22:24:52 2015 UTC,Is that something you could update? It's already awesome but slant lines for pointed pen styles would be the icing on the cake!
Handwriting,2w70s0,WhereverSheGoes,1 point,Tue Feb 17 23:05:20 2015 UTC,"Well I definitly have to look into that. For the moment, under 1mm, slant lines cause performance issues. The smaller the nib is, the more lines you will have on the document and the more elements will be processed by Ductus, because each line is actually processed, and in this particular case, you have thousands of them :)"

Handwriting,2w5f63,Dave_Real,1 point,Tue Feb 17 02:47:36 2015 UTC,"Hello! This is my declaration of my intention to improve my handwriting. I have always been embarassed by my handwriting and envious of those who write in beautiful script. I got into fountain pens and I figured it would be a good time to improve my cursive.   This is an example of fairly careful cursive writing when I slow down.  My print is not much better!  I am left-handed and write with a ""hook-grip"". I intend to change this as my ultimate goal is learning Spencerian which required an under-hand grip.   This is my under-hand writing. This is taking a long time to write. I am unsure How to get a forward slant in this method. Also I am getting smudges everywhere. This will take time to learn!  I have ordered Michael Sull's ""American Cursive Handwriting"". Hopefully this will provide some guidance.  I notice I crook my head to write like this.  Written with Noodler's Ahab 54th Massachusets ink. With goulet nib (needs adjustment)  [On margins]  Forgot most of my cursive capitals!  My ""r"" is the worst. They look like ""u"" half the time... ""rupture"""

The fleshy area before my elbow rests on the desk. In this position my pen naturally points towards the upper right. Then I tried (and failed) to pull all the downstrokes parallel to the direction of the pen, which should work very well with a straight dip pen for Spencerian."
Handwriting,2w5f63,Uncle_Erik,1 point,Tue Feb 17 03:44:06 2015 UTC,"Why change?  I'm a lefty, I hook my hand and I rest a pen on my ring finger instead of my middle.  A number of teachers criticized it over the years, but I got on just fine in school.  I've been writing this way for nearly 40 years and it's fine.  Go with what feels comfortable and don't change just for the sake of changing.  Unless writing with a hook is causing a problem, there's no need to change."
Handwriting,2w5f63,rushoydom,1 point,Tue Feb 17 07:37:28 2015 UTC,"Well, I do notice my hand beginning to cramp after a few pages of writing, but It's mostly for the purpose of getting into fancier script in the future. It's not possible to get the required line variation using a hook. Different lefties have different solutions. Some even turn the page 90 deg."
Handwriting,2w5f63,Shibboleeth,1 point,Tue Feb 17 17:51:19 2015 UTC,"Good luck on reaching your goal! Another lefty hook writer here. I've somewhat learned to write underhand but I don't utilize it too often but still practice it once in a while, as it is still faster for me to hook-write. I really like throwing people off with my underhand writing, as it has a pretty strong leftward slant, as opposed to the regular rightward slant."
Handwriting,2w5f63,TheHockeyist,1 point,Tue Feb 17 08:43:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm really struggling with a consistent tilt. It's much more difficult with a clockwise turned page. When the page is straight,  each line is perpendicular to your vision and it's easier to get a consistent lean as you don't have to concentrate as hard on vertical position on the page. Similarly, turning the page counter-clockwise (like a proper right-hander) means you can draw parallel to your vision in order to get the proper tilt and only worry about your letters falling on the same vertical position. A clockwise page means you have to concentrate both on keeping the letters on the line and getting the consistent slant. Unless I'm misunderstanding something, it's going to take a lot of practice to get right."

Handwriting,2vu6ql,skim-milk,5,Sat Feb 14 14:12:49 2015 UTC,"I've been on the receiving end of a couple of these letters and they all seem kind of desperate. They're not classy; they speak for a Victorian perspective on dating. That's no fun. They can be sweet, yes, but part of the deal is working up the courage to talk to the person. Would the date be a series of passed notes, too? Spelling and handwriting are fine skills to have, but don't matter in a relationship."
Handwriting,2vu6ql,271828182,15,Sat Feb 14 14:22:16 2015 UTC,"We haven't been a culture that communicates exclusively via face to face verbal information exchange for centuries, why on earth do people have this kind of attitude towards letters like this?   Why is a handwritten letter worse than flirting via text message, email, instant messaging, Facebook, or any digital form of writing back and forth? People didn't stop writing each other letters because it's trashy or tacky, they stopped writing letters because we've moved on to digital letter writing."
Handwriting,2vu6ql,besthuman,19,Sat Feb 14 18:39:53 2015 UTC,"Each to their own. Personally, I appreciate little anachronisms like handwritten notes. For me spelling, but perhaps not handwriting do matter in a relationship. If you sent me a note/email/text with high school spelling mistakes, quite simply, it is not going to work out.  For lots of people, the anxiety is out of a fear of rejection. Even the askee can succumb to anxiety or nervousness, only regretting that they rejected him or her after the fact. Once we are past the first opening social salvos, this risk is significantly mitigated. We have both expressed our interest in one another, from an emotionally safe distance. (This is one reason why online dating is hugely popular) The first date has a completely different character than the first introductions.  And yes, there is a certain amount of desperation fueling something like a note. I am desperate to meet you, but am addled by the thought that you are out of my league. Asking you in person is simply not possible for me, but out of desperation I will play the one card I can: write you a letter. Some men or women would find that romantic.   There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so."

Handwriting,2vu6ql,ch4rr3d,-41,Thu Apr 16 10:18:24 2015 UTC,I'll bet you get your chance. Her boyfriend can't possibly be good enough for her. (I love this story and her note!)
Handwriting,2vu6ql,wordgirrl,5,Sat Feb 14 03:44:52 2015 UTC,"Not sure why all the downvotes. This was my thought exactly.   ""I would love to, but I have a boyfriend""  ""Ok, I'll wait"""
